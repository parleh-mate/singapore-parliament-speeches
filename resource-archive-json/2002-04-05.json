The\r\n\r\nGovernment  also  very  quickly set up  the  Economic  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee  to review our economic policies to revitalise  the\r\n\r\neconomy,  and  remake Singapore.  So the Government  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  tardy since the General Elections.  In other words,  we\r\n\r\nhave not been sitting on our hands.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister  whether we could convene  Parliament  one\r\n\r\nmonth after the General Elections, so that Parliament can  be\r\n\r\noperationally  ready  in case there  are  urgent  matters  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss?   I  am sure Members of this House are  fully  aware\r\n\r\nthat  many  issues happened after the General Elections,  and\r\n\r\nthis  House  has  got  no opportunity to  discuss  all  these\r\n\r\nissues.   Therefore, I would request that  following  General\r\n\r\nElections in future, at least a month, we should all be sworn\r\n\r\nin and this House will be ready to tackle urgencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question, Sir, is whether this is going to be\r\n\r\nthe trend.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I do not think we can predict what\r\n\r\nwould  be the trend in the future because nobody can tell  us\r\n\r\nwhat is going to happen in the future.  While we can set some\r\n\r\nrules, I do not think we should be so rigid as to say that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  should  meet  immediately one  month  after  the  General\r\n\r\nElections  (GE).  There could be many reasons why  we  cannot\r\n\r\nmeet  immediately.   But  if there are  important  or  urgent\r\n\r\nreasons  that we have to meet immediately after the GE,  then\r\n\r\nthere  is  no doubt that the Government will seize  upon  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to do so.  But, here, we cannot commit  that  in\r\n\r\nfuture  we will have a sitting one month after the GE.   Much\r\n\r\ndepends  on  the  circumstances.  I think  the  less  we  tie\r\n\r\nourselves  down with rules, the better it is.  We  should  do\r\n\r\nwhat is necessary, what is useful, and what is important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, immediately after the GE, there are many issues\r\n\r\nto  be  settled.  Many of the programmes that the  Government\r\n\r\nput up before the GE are ideas that we should pursue, and  we\r\n\r\nneed  time to thrash them out; we need time to think  through\r\n\r\nthe  major issues, and in this instance, for example, the key\r\n\r\nchallenges we face today are economic restructuring  and  the\r\n\r\nnew  threat  of  the terrorists.  So these are  the  two  key\r\n\r\nchallenges  and therefore these are not issues  that  we  can\r\n\r\nimmediately come back to Parliament after the GE and  settle.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot solve the problems even after the Budget.  It will\r\n\r\ntake  some time for issues to be studied and to come out with\r\n\r\nprogrammes to resolve some of them.  We cannot resolve all of\r\n\r\nthem even in the Budget in May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LAND RECLAMATION OFF PULAU TEKONG</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Impact on Malaysia)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational Development what is the situation regarding the land\r\n\r\nreclamation off Pulau Tekong and its possible impact  on  the\r\n\r\nMalaysians.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there have been many reports in the\r\n\r\nMalaysian media alleging that our land reclamation works  off\r\n\r\nPulau  Tekong and Tuas will impact Malaysia in various  ways.\r\n\r\nWe are surprised by these recent allegations since\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  land  reclamation policy is not new.  Given  Singapore's\r\n\r\nsmall  size, it has been our long-standing policy to  reclaim\r\n\r\nland from our territorial waters so as to meet the demands on\r\n\r\nland use.  I will address these allegations in my response.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is concern that our works may encroach into\r\n\r\ntheir  territorial  waters,  or somehow  shift  the  boundary\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore  and Malaysia.  We have  stated  that  the\r\n\r\nreclamation works are carried out entirely within our  waters\r\n\r\nand  that  there  is no encroachment.  The reclamation  works\r\n\r\nalso  cannot  change the territorial boundary  in  the  Johor\r\n\r\nStraits.   This  boundary was defined by  fixed  geographical\r\n\r\ncoordinates  since 1995 in an Agreement that was  signed  and\r\n\r\nratified by Singapore and Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern raised is that the reclamation works at\r\n\r\nPulau  Tekong  will affect the shipping lane to Pasir  Gudang\r\n\r\nPort  by  making  the shipping lane narrower  and  shallower.\r\n\r\nSir,  this  is not the case.  The existing shipping  lane  to\r\n\r\nPasir  Gudang  Port  lies in the deep water  channel  between\r\n\r\nmainland  Singapore and the islands of Pulau Ubin  and  Pulau\r\n\r\nTekong.   Ships going to our Sembawang Wharves also use  this\r\n\r\nshipping lane.  The current reclamation works at Pulau Tekong\r\n\r\nwill  not  reduce or otherwise affect the existing  width  of\r\n\r\nthis  shipping lane.  The shipping lane is not made shallower\r\n\r\nby  the reclamation works.  The Maritime Port Authority (MPA)\r\n\r\nregularly  monitors the siltation levels within the  shipping\r\n\r\nlane  to  ensure  that the channel remains  deep  enough  for\r\n\r\nnavigation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Tuas, our reclamation works are about 7\r\n\r\nkm  away  from the shipping lane to Tanjung Pelepas Port,  so\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  possibility that our reclamation would  affect\r\n\r\naccess to Tanjung Pelepas Port.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to address allegations that the\r\n\r\nreclamation  works at Pulau Tekong will increase the  current\r\n\r\nflow in the Johor Straits, cause flooding in Johor and affect\r\n\r\nthe  fishermen's  catches.  Hydraulic modelling  studies  are\r\n\r\ndone for our reclamation works to assess the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimpact  of  reclamation on currents, tidal  flows  and  water\r\n\r\nquality.   They  indicate that the reclamation  at  Tuas  and\r\n\r\nPulau  Tekong  will  not  have  an  adverse  impact  on   the\r\n\r\nsurrounding waters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, water quality in the Johor Straits has also\r\n\r\nbeen jointly monitored on a regular basis by our Ministry  of\r\n\r\nthe  Environment  and Johor's Department of  the  Environment\r\n\r\n(DOE) since 1991.  The results show that the water quality in\r\n\r\nthe   Johor   Straits  has  remained  unchanged  even   after\r\n\r\nreclamation works have started.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has acted within its rights and\r\n\r\nobligations  under  international law  in  carrying  out  the\r\n\r\nreclamation  works.  During his visit to  Malaysia  in  March\r\n\r\nthis  year, DPM Lee had indicated that if the Malaysians  had\r\n\r\nconcerns  about  the effects of the reclamation,  they  could\r\n\r\nsend  us  a  note  and we would consider it.   The  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment is still waiting for a note from the Malaysians to\r\n\r\nunderstand their concerns more fully.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, notwithstanding the\r\n\r\nlegality  of Singapore's reclamation works, there appears  to\r\n\r\nbe  a  perception across the Causeway that we ought  to  have\r\n\r\nconsulted before we undertook these works.  May I ask whether\r\n\r\nthere  is any basis for such a request or expectation in  law\r\n\r\nand  also  whether this observation of Rule No.  1  has  been\r\n\r\nbilateral.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, to answer Mr Iswaran's question,\r\n\r\nlet me first explain to the House why we reclaim land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a small country. We are about 680 sq km.\r\n\r\nWe  need  land.  When Habibie said that we are a  little  red\r\n\r\ndot,  he  was not too far off the mark.  If you look  at  the\r\n\r\nmap,  you  will  see Singapore in relation  to  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  Malaysia is about 330,000 sq km.  So we are  less\r\n\r\nthan 1%, about 0.2%, the size of Malaysia.  Our population is\r\n\r\ngrowing.   Our need for land for schools, factories,  housing\r\n\r\nis  growing.  That is the reason why we have to reclaim land.\r\n\r\nWithout  reclamation,  we would not have  Marine  Parade,  we\r\n\r\nwould  not  have East Coast Parkway, we would  not  have  the\r\n\r\nairport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout  reclamation,  we would not have  Jurong  Island,  we\r\n\r\nwould not have space for industries.  Without reclamation, we\r\n\r\nwould  not have Marina South to expand our CBD.  So  that  is\r\n\r\nthe  reason why we have to reclaim land.  We are  not  a  big\r\n\r\ncountry like Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our reclamation is not a secret. We do not do\r\n\r\nreclamation quietly and sneak it through and suddenly we have\r\n\r\nthe  barges going to Pulau Tekong to reclaim land.  Our plans\r\n\r\nare approved in Parliament, in this House.  They are reviewed\r\n\r\nin  all our concept plans.  In fact, the reclamation of Pulau\r\n\r\nTekong  was reviewed in the 1991 Concept Plan, 11 years  ago.\r\n\r\nThe concept plans are revised every 10 years, and in the 2001\r\n\r\nConcept  Plan  which we released last year,  the  reclamation\r\n\r\nplans  are  still there.  Any member of the  public  can  get\r\n\r\naccess to these plans.  If you are not in Singapore, you  can\r\n\r\njust  click on to www.ura.gov.sg and you can see these plans.\r\n\r\nSo  these are not secret plans, neither are they carried  out\r\n\r\nsurreptitiously or just on the spur of the moment.  As I said\r\n\r\nearlier,  we  have looked at reclamation and we have  carried\r\n\r\nout reclamation since the 1960s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise, we are a small country, we need land. We\r\n\r\nhave  been reclaiming land for a very, very long time.   Even\r\n\r\nthen,  after all the reclamations for the last 40  years  and\r\n\r\nall  the  reclamations that we are going to carry out  within\r\n\r\nour  territorial  waters, we will still be a  small  country,\r\n\r\nstill smaller than Malaysia.  So it is rather surprising that\r\n\r\nthese  allegations come out at this particular point in time,\r\n\r\nthat  we  are thwarting their port development, that  we  are\r\n\r\naffecting their waters, or affecting them in many other ways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated earlier, our reclamation works are done\r\n\r\nwithin our waters, in accordance with international law.   We\r\n\r\ndo  not  encroach on Malaysian territory.  They do not affect\r\n\r\nnavigation  in  the Johor Straits.  They do  not  narrow  the\r\n\r\nchannel.   They  do  not  affect  the  water  quality.    The\r\n\r\nreclamation works that we do are a result of our own need for\r\n\r\nland.  So I do not see why we have to consult Malaysia  on  a\r\n\r\nmatter of sovereign concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, Malaysia was thinking about reclaiming\r\n\r\nsome  land off Johor, in the Straits.  This was not too  long\r\n\r\nago,  and  the planned reclamation was very extensive.   They\r\n\r\ndid  not see the need to consult us, neither did we make  any\r\n\r\nnoise about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So given this, the fact that we need to reclaim, given\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  we  have made studies  to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nreclamation works do not have an impact, is it necessary  for\r\n\r\nus  to consult?

For  example,\r\n\r\nthe  contractors  are  required  to  make  use  of  siltation\r\n\r\nscreens.

It is a policy that the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof Health introduced in March 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to-date, only one patient has been\r\n\r\ncharged full cost for four days of overstay in Class B2  ward\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  General  Hospital  (SGH).   Despite  financial\r\n\r\ncounselling  given  to  the patient,  she  chose  not  to  be\r\n\r\ndischarged home after she was certified medically  fit.   The\r\n\r\nreason  she  gave  was that she did not want  the  hassle  of\r\n\r\nreturning  to  SGH  for  her  daily  outpatient  radiotherapy\r\n\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take this opportunity to explain our policy on\r\n\r\noverstayers   in   acute  hospitals.   Patients   should   be\r\n\r\ndischarged  from  the acute hospitals when  it  is  medically\r\n\r\nassessed that they no longer require inpatient medical  care.\r\n\r\nPatients who still insist on staying in the hospitals  should\r\n\r\npay  the  full cost of their extended stay.  In this way,  we\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  heavily subsidised beds are  taken  up  by\r\n\r\npatients who require inpatient care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing this policy, I would like to reassure\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  that  we have put in place several  safeguards.\r\n\r\nFirst,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  hospitals  certify patients that they are medically  fit\r\n\r\nfor discharge based solely on medical grounds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, my Ministry is aware that some families may\r\n\r\nface  difficulties  in looking after patients  at  home  upon\r\n\r\ntheir  discharge for various social reasons.   Some  patients\r\n\r\nmay also require step-down care.  As such, the hospitals will\r\n\r\nassist  the  patients  and  their  families  to  arrange  for\r\n\r\nplacements in step-down facilities, or home medical, or  home\r\n\r\nnursing,  for  these patients.  Patients and  their  families\r\n\r\nwill  be given sufficient time to make the necessary domestic\r\n\r\nadjustments.   Full  cost  would only  be  charged  from  the\r\n\r\nseventh  working day after the patients have  been  certified\r\n\r\nmedically  fit  and  after the hospital has  placed  them  in\r\n\r\nappropriate step-down care facility, if necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> May I ask the Minister of\r\n\r\nState  whether it is appropriate to implement the new subsidy\r\n\r\nfor  overstayers ruling as there is, at the moment,  still  a\r\n\r\nshortage  of  nursing homes and community  hospital  beds  to\r\n\r\ndischarge  these patients?

It  is  only  when  all\r\n\r\narrangements  can  be made, and there have  been  seven  days\r\n\r\nsince the time the doctor has certified that the patient  was\r\n\r\nmedically  fit  to leave, it is only at that point  will  the\r\n\r\npatient be charged full rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to\r\n\r\ndischarging  of patients, is it because of the  present  case\r\n\r\nmix policy, meaning there is a specific period of stay that a\r\n\r\npatient  will  get subsidy from the Government,  after  which\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  no subsidy?  So I am wondering  whether  the\r\n\r\npatients  are being discharged for this purpose to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  the hospitals do not have to pay on their own to  treat\r\n\r\nthose overstayers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this policy has\r\n\r\nnothing to do with case mix.

The problem of overstaying, if I may  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  of State, if I am correct, is very  subjective\r\n\r\nbecause,  really, medicine is as much a science as it  is  an\r\n\r\nart.   So,  are there going to be very clear fixed parameters\r\n\r\nin  which you can determine that a person has already reached\r\n\r\na stage where he should be home and therefore if he stays any\r\n\r\nfurther he should be considered an overstayer?

As a  rule,\r\n\r\nand in fact all the doctors are very compassionate people,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  imagine that they would want to discharge  a  patient\r\n\r\nwho  is not fit to be discharged.

But\r\n\r\nas  far  as bus companies are concerned, they treat Saturdays\r\n\r\nas  similar to weekdays.  If I may give you some examples  of\r\n\r\nthe  streets around this area.  Hill Street, for example,  on\r\n\r\nweekdays,  in the morning, bus volume is about 164 per  hour,\r\n\r\nie, about two or three buses every minute.

We have built roads and roads are\r\n\r\nexpensive.  We  do not want to under-utilise  the  resources.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we are extremely selective when we decide on which\r\n\r\nroads to impose bus lanes.

I\r\n\r\nhave decided that there is nothing wrong to have more of  the\r\n\r\nsame, so long as the more reflects diversity of perspectives.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Sir,  I will be coming from the  perspectives  of\r\n\r\nchallenges and opportunities in these trying times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a time of great change and challenge for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Singapore today is faced with the greatest threat\r\n\r\nto  its competitiveness than any other time in its history as\r\n\r\nan independent nation.  After September 11th, we must be more\r\n\r\nsecurity conscious.  The threads of our multi-racial  society\r\n\r\nmust  be strengthened.  As we strive to remake Singapore,  we\r\n\r\nmust embrace dramatic transformations that will ripple across\r\n\r\nmany sectors of our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A seemingly endless wind of change ahead, but behind it\r\n\r\nall,  lie  abundant opportunities.  So how can the  workforce\r\n\r\nstay relevant?  And how can Singapore remain competitive?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To combat the challenges and build on the opportunities,\r\n\r\nI  would  like to propose four key points.  The  first  deals\r\n\r\nwith   stakeholders,  namely,  the  workforce,  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity  and the Government.  The second looks at  boosting\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial  culture and spirit.   The  third  calls  for\r\n\r\nbuilding  a  tradition  of charity.   The  fourth  hails  for\r\n\r\nsolidarity in change efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economic gypsies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, workers have to be prepared to embrace the role of\r\n\r\neconomic  gypsies.   I  term  it  that  way  because   market\r\n\r\nvolatility  and shortened business cycles will  mean  workers\r\n\r\nhave to change their jobs and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwork environments ever so often, to stay employed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore now faces increased international competition\r\n\r\nfor  foreign capital, investments, and export markets.   This\r\n\r\nis  a  result  of the liberalisation of the former  communist\r\n\r\nbloc  countries such as China, Russia and Eastern  Europe   - who also have a lower cost base.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also beginning to lose our traditional\r\n\r\ncompetitive  advantage. Knowledge and technology have  become\r\n\r\ncheaply available and portable in the KBE.   Our growth  rate\r\n\r\ncan  be  expected to be halved from the heady  days  of  near\r\n\r\ndouble-digit  growth. Workers' earnings will consequently  be\r\n\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Frog in heating water</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merely adapting to change is dangerous and misleading.\r\n\r\nIt  is  like a frog in water that is slowly heating  up.  The\r\n\r\nfrog  will  keep changing its body temperature  to  suit  its\r\n\r\nsurrounding.  Contented, the frog goes  off  to  sleep.   But\r\n\r\nbliss turns to disaster, eventually it gets boiled alive.  So\r\n\r\npeople  must  do more than just adapt to change.   They  must\r\n\r\njump  out  of their changing world, take charge and  dare  to\r\n\r\nventure into new territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Ensuring viability of our businesses in the new economy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the workforce, let us now turn our attention to\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   To  survive and remain competitive,  businesses\r\n\r\ncannot afford to carry surplus capacity on a long-term basis,\r\n\r\nwithout  matching growth periods.  They must  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nshed  excess  capacity, be it manpower  or  otherwise,  in  a\r\n\r\ntimely   manner.    Businesses  today   face   pressures   of\r\n\r\ncompetition  to  reduce costs and will invest  only  in  cost\r\n\r\neffective locations.  Singapore is severely lacking  in  land\r\n\r\nand other natural resources which tend to push up our costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workforce, traditionally hardworking and\r\n\r\ndisciplined, must be flexible and realistic to retain what is\r\n\r\nleft of our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompetitive edge.  Workers must realize that unemployment  is\r\n\r\nhere to stay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore transits into a KBE, we face the challenge\r\n\r\nof  structural unemployment.  I understand that for a country\r\n\r\nto  achieve KBE status, at least 65% of its workforce has  to\r\n\r\nbe  in  the  skilled  category.  In  Singapore,  our  skilled\r\n\r\nworkforce only constitutes 59%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our race to reach full KBE status, we may have to\r\n\r\nfill this gap with foreign talent.  This will only worsen the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  the structurally unemployed issue, as  it  takes\r\n\r\ntime  to retrain people for new jobs that require new skills.\r\n\r\nThose  affected must therefore be prepared to  turn  to  less\r\n\r\npleasant  or  lower  skill  jobs,  traditionally  shunned  by\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Others, including professionals, may  have  to\r\n\r\nlearn  to  be innovative and become self-employed, and  offer\r\n\r\ncompetitively priced services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing the full brunt of this vicious cycle are the\r\n\r\nexecutives.   In  1997, I was approached by several,  whom  I\r\n\r\ncall  the  PEMs  -  they are, basically,  the  professionals,\r\n\r\nexecutives  and managers  -  who had lost their  jobs  during\r\n\r\nthe  financial crisis.   Many of them are casualties  of  the\r\n\r\ndotcom  bust and ongoing restructuring of our finance sector,\r\n\r\nhighly skilled and trained.  But they are a vulnerable group,\r\n\r\nwith no avenue to seek redress.  PEMs comprise a sizable  40%\r\n\r\nof the total retrenched workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to put my support behind this group and\r\n\r\ninitiated   SPEC,  a  co-operative  of  PEMs.    My   friends\r\n\r\nquestioned  my  move  to champion the  cause  of  executives,\r\n\r\nreminding  me  that  my father, a retired  Labour  MP  and  a\r\n\r\nfounding  member  of  the NTUC, had  battled  the  plight  of\r\n\r\nworkers.   But,  Sir, this cohort of our  workforce  is  fast\r\n\r\nincreasing,  and  they  do not enjoy the  slew  of  financial\r\n\r\nassistance  and rebates handed out by the Government  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers, which I fully support.  Sir, I shall be calling upon\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to appropriately do more in some  areas  and\r\n\r\nless  in others, as befitting the role of Government in  both\r\n\r\ngood and bad times.  The Government has allocated a $178,000-grant to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEC to conduct job placement and other training schemes  for\r\n\r\nthis  group  of  people, but I think more  can  be  done  for\r\n\r\nretrenched executives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest another way to help this\r\n\r\ngroup of people, especially those who are above 40 years old.\r\n\r\nIt  is  difficult for them to find re-employment, because  of\r\n\r\nemployers'  preference for younger workers.  One  alternative\r\n\r\nto  re-employment would be for the Government  to  help  them\r\n\r\nbecome  self-employed.  PEMs have a wealth of  knowledge  and\r\n\r\nexpertise,  and many years of valuable working experience  to\r\n\r\noffer.  The Government can facilitate the PEMs to offer their\r\n\r\nservices  to  SMEs  or other businesses that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwould   like  to  support.   The  Government  can   encourage\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  employ  the services of  PEMs  by  granting  a\r\n\r\nsubsidy, but  for only a limited period of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Lee had given his view on subsidies yesterday. My\r\n\r\ntake on his comment is that giving subsidies is tantamount to\r\n\r\nrobbing  Peter to give Paul.  In this instance, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  persuade  DPM  Lee  that  in certain  situations,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  jia-you, to get the car going.  For  my  Malay\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  it  means tambah minyak kereta.   Otherwise,  we\r\n\r\nwill  keep  running  on the same spot and  we  will  be  non-starters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way is to organise these PEMs to take up\r\n\r\noverseas postings under a subsidised funding scheme.  We  can\r\n\r\nprepare and encourage this group of PEMs to venture overseas.\r\n\r\nFrom  my  understanding,  many  companies  in  China  require\r\n\r\nexpertise  and experienced operations managers to  help  them\r\n\r\nrun  their  businesses.   In these companies,  they  actually\r\n\r\nemploy  a  lot of young MBAs, but these companies still  feel\r\n\r\nthat they lack experienced operations managers.  So, this  is\r\n\r\none area where we can actually help our PEMs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of PEMs can actually become the nucleus for\r\n\r\nthe  eventual  emergence of portfolio managers.   They  could\r\n\r\nform an \"outsource industry\" to meet the needs of businesses.\r\n\r\nSuch an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustry  could thrive and flourish in the New  Economy,  and\r\n\r\nhelp to make Singapore more cost competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to propose that some form of\r\n\r\nminimum  legislation be put in place to protect  PEMs.   They\r\n\r\nare  not  covered  by the Employment Act.  So  they  have  no\r\n\r\nrecourse  to  the  Ministry of Manpower if they  are  treated\r\n\r\nunfairly by their employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conciliation Service Unit, set up by MOM after the\r\n\r\n1997 downturn, offers some consolation, but is not sufficient\r\n\r\nto   help  settle  a  retrenchment  or  termination  dispute.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  it  is timely to consider a review of the Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  Act, to make provision for the aggrieved executive\r\n\r\nto  be  represented in an Arbitration Court, for  termination\r\n\r\nand dismissal issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be sure, Sir, I am not seeking redress for executive\r\n\r\nunion  representation.   To do that will  be  to  hamper  the\r\n\r\nflexibility  of  doing  business in Singapore.   Our  desired\r\n\r\noutcome is to have minimum legislation to protect the  rights\r\n\r\nof every stakeholder in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President, in his Address to this House,\r\n\r\nemphasised  the  need  for  us to strengthen  the  spirit  of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  and  risk  taking,  as   a   platform   for\r\n\r\nSingapore's future competitiveness.  May I also add  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  require as many of our best and brightest  to  take  up\r\n\r\nthis  challenge,  if  we  are to  succeed  in  building  this\r\n\r\nplatform.   And to this end, our Government must  once  again\r\n\r\ntake the lead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must correct the current imbalance in the\r\n\r\ndistribution of local talent between the public  and  private\r\n\r\nsectors,  to  boost the spirit of entrepreneurship  and  risk\r\n\r\ntaking  in  Singapore.  Ironically, it has not been  seen  to\r\n\r\ntake  the risk of doing this, while exhorting the virtues  of\r\n\r\nrisk  taking.   The best and brightest among  our  young  are\r\n\r\nstill  being educated and nurtured, at great public  expense,\r\n\r\nfor  safe jobs in the comfort zones of Government service and\r\n\r\nGLCs.  Worse still, many of able body and mind,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho eventually retire from  service on mandatory grounds, are\r\n\r\nre-absorbed into the service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must practise more of what it is\r\n\r\npreaching  on this issue.  Notwithstanding the problem  of  a\r\n\r\nlimited local talent pool, the Government must be bold enough\r\n\r\nto allow the private sector a larger share of this pool.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  retiring  officers,  who  are  still  fit  for  re-employment,  can be encouraged and facilitated to  start  new\r\n\r\nbusinesses  or become active equity investors in  businesses.\r\n\r\nA  good many of these talents can be drawn from the top brass\r\n\r\nof our Armed Forces. Instead of giving them the security of a\r\n\r\nsecond  career in the cocoon of the Government and GLCs,  why\r\n\r\nnot encourage them to become risk takers and wealth creators,\r\n\r\nin  line  with our objective of strengthening the  spirit  of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further enlarge the entrepreneurial talent pool, the\r\n\r\nGovernment can also award scholarships for higher studies  to\r\n\r\ntop   students,   based  on  their  aspirations   to   become\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.  Returned scholars could be asked to  work  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  or  GLCs for up to five years, after  which  they\r\n\r\ncould  be  released  to the private sector  to  pursue  their\r\n\r\ndreams, perhaps with some help from industry and Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in our midst in this Chamber, we have a reverse\r\n\r\ntrend  in  Minister  of  State Ng  Eng  Hen,  who  started  a\r\n\r\nsuccessful medical practice in the private sector and is  now\r\n\r\ndrawn into the Government to contribute.  But this is a  good\r\n\r\nthing  to happen for Singapore, because it demonstrates  that\r\n\r\nif  we can nurture the private sector, with the creame de  la\r\n\r\ncreame, we will always be assured of a minefield to roost our\r\n\r\ngolden  goose.   MOS  Ng,  please do  not  think  that  I  am\r\n\r\nshowering  you with flattery, but I only wish to emphasise  a\r\n\r\npoint to all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may argue that good entrepreneurs need not be from\r\n\r\nthe  brightest and the best.  I would argue that if Singapore\r\n\r\nwants to produce a few winners and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanother  Sim  Wong Hoo, then it must cultivate the  brightest\r\n\r\nand   the   best.   By  and  large,  the  majority   of   our\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs   can  be  the  mums  and  the   pas   of   our\r\n\r\nheartlanders,  but  in uplifting the entrepreneurial  culture\r\n\r\nand quality, there is no denying that we also need the best.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tend to have a pre-qualified definition for success\r\n\r\n-   all  the  5  Cs.   But  let  me  relate  an  incident  my\r\n\r\nentrepreneur  friend told me about.  One morning,  she  drove\r\n\r\nher  daughter to school, something she had not been doing for\r\n\r\na  while.   The  principal, who knows  her  as  a  successful\r\n\r\nentrepreneur, was surprised to see her and asked her why  she\r\n\r\nwas  not  at  work.  Amused by the query, my  friend  replied\r\n\r\n\"Well  I have made enough money for the year and have decided\r\n\r\nto  quit  my  job.\"  In fact, she had just  quit  her  dotcom\r\n\r\ncompany that went bust.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pre-conceived notion here is that she had time to\r\n\r\nferry  her daughter because she may have lost her  job.   But\r\n\r\nthe  principal may or may not be having this notion  that  my\r\n\r\nfriend  thinks the principal has.  The point really  is  that\r\n\r\nthe  meaning of success is relative and a matter  of  choice.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  must look at the entrepreneurial world  through\r\n\r\nexperimental  eyes.   Give  room  for  trials  and   courage.\r\n\r\nCourage  does  not  mean having no fear.  Courage  is  taking\r\n\r\naction despite fear, and this, to me, is success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President has also spoken of the need to\r\n\r\nmaintain  and strengthen our social cohesion, as  we  upgrade\r\n\r\nour  economy, and the income divide widens between  those  at\r\n\r\nthe  top  end  and  the  lower end.  The  world's  wealthiest\r\n\r\ncountry, the United States, is also a country of great income\r\n\r\ndivide.   But  the  social cohesion of  American  society  is\r\n\r\nstrong, partly because of their great charitable institutions\r\n\r\nand the generosity of America's rich, in reaching out to help\r\n\r\ntheir less fortunate compatriots.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of the American charity is best illustrated\r\n\r\nby  Bill Gates, the world's wealthiest person with a reported\r\n\r\nnet worth of US$56 billion, but who has also given away US$20\r\n\r\nbillion to charity.  I am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno fan of Bill Gates, but here is an example of a businessman\r\n\r\nsupporting the community in which his business thrives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Asian values of philanthropy are not lacking in the\r\n\r\nleast.  The first generation of Overseas Chinese in Singapore\r\n\r\nlike  Lee Kong Chian, Tan Kah Kee, Tan Tock Seng and Run  Run\r\n\r\nShaw  were all charitable towkays who had given back much  to\r\n\r\nsociety,  especially  to  help the  less  privileged.   These\r\n\r\nphilanthropists   have   set   up   foundations   and   built\r\n\r\ninstitutions that have benefited many Singaporeans.   Witness\r\n\r\nthe former Nanyang University and The Chinese High.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we should celebrate Singaporeans who do well,\r\n\r\nlet  us also urge those who are well-off, to take a leaf from\r\n\r\nthe  great  American tradition of charity and generosity  and\r\n\r\nfrom  our Asian philanthropy values, in reaching out  to  the\r\n\r\nless  fortunate in our society.  In so doing, social cohesion\r\n\r\nwill be strengthened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, Sir, we are all aware that Singapore is at\r\n\r\nthe  crossroads. The challenges we are facing  are  daunting,\r\n\r\nbut by no means insurmountable.  As a nation and a people, we\r\n\r\nhave been at the crossroads and turning points many times  in\r\n\r\nour  history.  Yet, each time we have overcome the  odds  and\r\n\r\nemerged  stronger.  I am confident that we will rise  to  the\r\n\r\noccasion  and  emerge victorious again.   Strong  leadership,\r\n\r\ntransparency,  meritocracy, hard work  and  flexibility  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to give us the extra edge, not only to survive  but\r\n\r\nwill keep us ahead of many of our competitors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a nation, we must soldier on with a positive mindset.\r\n\r\nAs the Government, we must provide bold initiatives that will\r\n\r\nfacilitate the PEMs and budding entrepreneurs.  And  as  good\r\n\r\ncorporate citizens, we must always remember to give back what\r\n\r\nwe  have reaped.  In a nutshell, the President's vision  must\r\n\r\nbecome a shared dream of all Singaporeans.  I urge that there\r\n\r\nwill be fuller discussions and public debates on this vision,\r\n\r\nso  that  all  of us will own this vision and be inspired  to\r\n\r\nalways be hopeful.  For in hope, we find the way\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  remake Singapore into a fine nation, not just in form but\r\n\r\nin spirit and soul as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I support the motion moved\r\n\r\nby  Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, Member for Marine Parade GRC, to  thank\r\n\r\nthe President for his Speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the view of the President and some other\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  House that Singapore is now  at  a  crucial\r\n\r\ncrossroad.

Threats from the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group  have\r\n\r\nnot  abated  in  the  Philippines.

All these are the capital we have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are still handicapped by several factors.\r\n\r\nWe  are small.  We have only 682.3 square kilometres of  land\r\n\r\nbereft  of natural resources, and a tiny population  of  3.26\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do not in the least doubt that we can and\r\n\r\ncertainly will overcome the difficulties facing us now.  When\r\n\r\nSingapore   was  born  as  a  nation  36  years  ago,   these\r\n\r\nlimitations were already there.  In fact, a large part of the\r\n\r\ncapital  that I mentioned earlier were absent then.  We  have\r\n\r\nsucceeded in creating the Singapore that it is today  despite\r\n\r\nsome  quarters predicting that we would fail.  In fact,  some\r\n\r\neven hoped that we would collapse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a historical abnormality happened. We have\r\n\r\nsurvived.   And what is more, we have prospered.  We  can  be\r\n\r\nthankful  and  proud  because Singapore  is  an  oasis  in  a\r\n\r\ntroubled region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why and how did this happen? Singapore's survival\r\n\r\ndepends  on two factors - external and internal factors.   As\r\n\r\nis  the  case with other small nations, Singapore's  rise  or\r\n\r\nfall  is determined to a large extent, about 60%, by external\r\n\r\nfactors and 40% by factors within the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not the United States of America, or China which\r\n\r\nare  sufficiently large to depend on the people's sources  of\r\n\r\nwealth and dynamism of efforts.  America's economy forms  27%\r\n\r\nof  the  world's  GNP.  China, with its  population  of  1.29\r\n\r\nbillion and vast land rich with natural resources, can depend\r\n\r\non  the  efforts  and  wealth within the country  to  support\r\n\r\nitself in hard times.  Singapore cannot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation three decades ago is different from the\r\n\r\npresent.   The  bipolar world and the Cold War of  the  1960s\r\n\r\nwere  to  our advantage when we were viewed as supporters  in\r\n\r\nthe  Western powers' struggle against communism.   Hence,  we\r\n\r\nenjoyed the inflow of capital which developed our industries,\r\n\r\nand this region saw support for anti-communist governments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such strategic considerations have helped the economies\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Brunei\r\n\r\nto  grow.   ASEAN has been hailed as the unmatched shield  of\r\n\r\nstability  in  the  region.  The basis of  development  which\r\n\r\nbegan  from  these strategic considerations  has  produced  a\r\n\r\ncircle  of  dynamism which benefited the region.   Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhich has more obvious internal advantages and adopts correct\r\n\r\npolicies and approach, has been able to move far ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is now a unipolar one. The struggle against\r\n\r\ncommunism has ended.  The concern of the West has shifted  to\r\n\r\ntackling their biggest political and economic rivals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is considered as a side which is able to pierce the\r\n\r\nunipolar  comfort of the United States?  Although  Europe  is\r\n\r\nseen  as  an  economic  rival, it is  still  counted  as  its\r\n\r\npolitical  ally.  So is Japan.  This puts China and  militant\r\n\r\nIslam as the biggest challenge to US world supremacy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the way the US conducts its international\r\n\r\nrelations, many are of the view that the challenge from China\r\n\r\nis  a long-term concern while the challenge by militant Islam\r\n\r\nis more pressing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me explain. In its effort to counter\r\n\r\nthe  threat  of the Soviet Union, the US rallied  its  allies\r\n\r\namong Muslim nations.  It helped Iran under Shah Phalavi  and\r\n\r\nstrengthened   groups  opposed  to  the   Soviet   Union   in\r\n\r\nAfghanistan   apart  from  cooperating  with   several   Arab\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political challenge of militant Islam to the US\r\n\r\nbegan  when  Iran  fell into the hands of the  mullahs.   Its\r\n\r\nattempt to make Iraq a buffer against Iranian influence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nended  with  the emergence of Iraq under expansionist  Saddam\r\n\r\nHussein.   Now  Iraq  has still not been completely  crippled\r\n\r\nafter Operation Desert Storm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Afghanistan, the government power fell into the hands\r\n\r\nof the Talibans who opposed Soviet occupation of the country.\r\n\r\nThe  new  Afghan leadership later provided safe haven  to  Al\r\n\r\nQaeda  and  Osama Bin Laden, the person responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nattacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Palestinian-Israeli conflict is actually political\r\n\r\nin nature.  George Habash of the People's Liberation Front of\r\n\r\nPalestine  is a Christian.  So are several other  Palestinian\r\n\r\nsenior  leaders.  However, the existence and violent  profile\r\n\r\nof  Hamas, Hizbollah and Al-Aqsa groups have placed  militant\r\n\r\nIslam  as a challenge to the US.  The western media  is  also\r\n\r\nresponsible for such portrayal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of migrants from Muslim countries in North\r\n\r\nAfrica, Middle East and Pakistan to France, Britain, Germany,\r\n\r\nDenmark, and the social conflicts which have arisen  from  it\r\n\r\nhave also increased the concern of European countries on  the\r\n\r\nphenomenon  called Islam. These countries, though  well-known\r\n\r\nas  protectors  and  advocates of human  rights,  have  taken\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  protect  their respective  interests.   Turkey,\r\n\r\nsince  Mustapha  Kamal Attaturk's era,  has  been  practising\r\n\r\nsecular  policy  and  identifies itself as  part  of  Europe.\r\n\r\nUntil  now,  its attempt to become a member of  the  European\r\n\r\nUnion has still not become a reality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A line seems to have been drawn by the western world\r\n\r\nagainst Islam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our country, the events sparked by the Jemaah\r\n\r\nIslamiyah  incident,  the emergence of KMM  in  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nLaskar  Jihad  in  Indonesia as well as  Abu  Sayyaf  in  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines show that the threat of global terrorism  affects\r\n\r\nus and our neighbours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, what is the link between the geopolitical\r\n\r\ndevelopment in the world and Singapore?  If a major  part  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's future is determined by external factors,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  means  that  we  have  to think about  it  seriously  and\r\n\r\nrationally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a secular country. Muslims form 15% of its\r\n\r\npopulation.  It is surrounded by Indonesia where Muslims form\r\n\r\n88%  of its 228 million population and Malaysia where Muslims\r\n\r\nform  53%  of  its 22 million population.  Events  that  take\r\n\r\nplace  in the world and our neighbouring countries will  have\r\n\r\neffects  on Singapore.  Does this mean that Singapore  should\r\n\r\nbe  suspicious of Islam?  Statements made by our leaders  are\r\n\r\nclear.   Singapore  is not suspicious of Islam.   But  it  is\r\n\r\nworried about militant Islam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is not only the concern of Singapore,\r\n\r\nbut  also  other  countries such as Malaysia  and  Indonesia.\r\n\r\nLikewise  with  Muslim  majority  countries  such  as  Egypt,\r\n\r\nJordan,  Pakistan  and Algeria.  They are  also  fighting  to\r\n\r\ncontain the influence of militant Islam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should expand our network and cooperation with\r\n\r\nmainstream  and moderate Muslim countries.  They  can  become\r\n\r\nour  friends.  At the same time, we must stop the  inflow  of\r\n\r\nmilitant  Islam and prevent elements of militant  Islam  from\r\n\r\nspreading  in our country.  It is the seed of division  which\r\n\r\ncan threaten our racial harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economically, we are facing China with its formidable\r\n\r\neconomic  challenge.  Many Members of the House have  touched\r\n\r\non  this  matter.   In  this region, Malaysia,  Thailand  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia  can  offer an alternative with much  lower  costs.\r\n\r\nAll  these and many more that I am unable to mention form 60%\r\n\r\nof the factors that contribute to Singapore's survival.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we may not be able to change the external\r\n\r\nfactor.   It is beyond our control.  But this does  not  mean\r\n\r\nthat we should not do anything and let it grip us.  We should\r\n\r\nmake efforts to make them work in our favour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I studied geography. Those who are familiar with the\r\n\r\ntopography of a desert know that an oasis does not  exist  on\r\n\r\nits   own.   Its  existence  and  greenery  are  due  to  the\r\n\r\nunderground water that flows\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhundreds  of  kilometres to it.  The water flows  slowly  and\r\n\r\nthough we cannot see it, the water flows non-stop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is like an oasis. To remain as an oasis, it\r\n\r\nneeds   to  create  a  network  which  channels  sources   of\r\n\r\nproduction and expertise from all over the world. Through the\r\n\r\nexternal  wing,  regionalisation, the carving  of  niches  in\r\n\r\nexternal markets, the setting up of strategic branch  offices\r\n\r\noverseas,  the entry of talent and our networking with  post-industrial  countries, we create a network which becomes  the\r\n\r\nlifeline of our country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to concentrate on the other 40% - the\r\n\r\ninternal factor.  We need to rediscover our strength, explore\r\n\r\nnew areas, change our way of analysing and solving problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to strengthen our unity, increase our sense of\r\n\r\nbelonging  and  stakes  of  our  people.   We  need  to  have\r\n\r\nconfidence in ourselves and our capability.  It is  a  factor\r\n\r\nthat can prompt us towards progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore brand enjoys an international standard.\r\n\r\nWe  should  fully  use it.  The success of  SIA  and  PSA  in\r\n\r\nairline  and port industries can serve as a model  for  other\r\n\r\nindustries.  We should have more models of this kind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, two years ago I was in Belgium, a European\r\n\r\ncountry which has a high cost of living.  It has been able to\r\n\r\nmaintain  its economic development by carving certain  niches\r\n\r\nin  the  European and world economies.  Its small and  medium\r\n\r\nsized  enterprises  (SMEs) produce  special  and  world-class\r\n\r\ngoods.  You may have heard the term 'boutique chocolate'.  It\r\n\r\nis  a  special chocolate, delicious, unique but the price  is\r\n\r\nten times that of ordinary chocolate.  Many people love it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is the case with its restaurants. It has one-star to\r\n\r\nthree-star restaurants.  The three-star restaurants  are  not\r\n\r\nbig  restaurants.  Some are run by couples with an assistant.\r\n\r\nBut I have been told that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncooking  is delicious and the ambience is fantastic.   Diners\r\n\r\npay premium amount to enjoy the service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Sydney, there are also similar restaurants which are\r\n\r\nextraordinary.  Those who want to go to the restaurants  have\r\n\r\nto  book three months in advance.  There is only one menu and\r\n\r\nit  does  not  change but the restaurants  are  crowded  with\r\n\r\ncustomers every night.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to stress here is that we should not blame\r\n\r\ncosts  only.  Generally, to compete with our rivals, we  need\r\n\r\nto lower our costs.  But for special high-cost industries, we\r\n\r\ncan still increase demand by being creative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the oasis which is called Singapore has to\r\n\r\nget  a  formula and model from the experience overseas.   The\r\n\r\nformula and model are like underground water that gives  life\r\n\r\nto  the oasis.  If this can be done, I am confident that  the\r\n\r\nship  which is called Singapore will continue to sail in  the\r\n\r\nsea of success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nspeak in support of the motion to thank the President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My being here is about maintaining hope in our younger\r\n\r\ngeneration.   Three  other Members of  this  House  who  were\r\n\r\nnaturalised Singaporeans have spoken of how they  cast  their\r\n\r\nlot  with  Singapore.  I, on the other hand, am a Singaporean\r\n\r\nborn  overseas to expatriate Singaporean parents in  Sarawak.\r\n\r\nI  spent  my  early years in Kuching and Kota  Kinabalu,  and\r\n\r\nlater  in  KL.   In  the political aftermath  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nindependence, circumstances forced my parents to move us from\r\n\r\nSabah  to KL, while the racial riots there in 1969 sent  them\r\n\r\nback to Singapore.  Despite having to take a paycut each time\r\n\r\nand  to  start all over again in their career each and  every\r\n\r\ntime,  Singapore was still home and that is where they  went,\r\n\r\nbecause they knew that here, in Singapore, success would  not\r\n\r\ndepend on one's race and religion, but on hard work and equal\r\n\r\nopportunities for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember how funny it felt having to renounce my\r\n\r\nrights  to  a  foreign  passport and  to  take  the  oath  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship  again  despite  having  being  registered  as  a\r\n\r\ncitizen  since  birth.  After nine years in  our  schools,  I\r\n\r\ngladly served NS, not only because I now possess the pink IC,\r\n\r\nbut  because  I felt that this was a place I was prepared  to\r\n\r\ndefend  because  it  had  given me the  opportunity  to  make\r\n\r\nsomething of my life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After BMT, I was assigned to do social work among\r\n\r\nsoldiers  convicted of consuming controlled drugs.   Many  of\r\n\r\nthese so-called Hokkien ping were basically what I felt  were\r\n\r\nvery  good people, who had just strayed onto the wrong  path.\r\n\r\nThey taught me to appreciate all my blessings, and made me to\r\n\r\nreflect  on the need for opportunities to get it right  first\r\n\r\ntime, and also how difficult it was to come back on course if\r\n\r\nyou did not get it right first time.  For these soldiers,  NS\r\n\r\nwas not about learning to defend Singapore, but a struggle to\r\n\r\nget  back  on  track  in their lives and  a  struggle  to  be\r\n\r\naccepted  back into a society which had already branded  them\r\n\r\nas failures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, while studying to be a paediatrician, I suffered\r\n\r\nmany   reverses  in  specialist  examinations.   But  I  have\r\n\r\ncolleagues who believed that I deserved a second chance,  and\r\n\r\nwho  believed and supported me, and eventually,  I  became  a\r\n\r\npaediatrician.  These experiences taught me valuable lessons:\r\n\r\nFirstly, you must believe in yourself and you must believe in\r\n\r\nyour dreams to succeed.  The second was that, to succeed, you\r\n\r\nneeded  people  who believed in you and who are  prepared  to\r\n\r\ngive  you a second chance.  The third was that when you fail,\r\n\r\nyou  must  be prepared to be disappointed, but you  have  the\r\n\r\nresilience  to  fight on, and perhaps be  laughed  at  for  a\r\n\r\nwhile.   The fourth was that when you fail, you must confront\r\n\r\nyour  faults and weaknesses, and be prepared to try something\r\n\r\nnew or to risk repeating your mistakes again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, as a doctor treating chronic illnesses, such as\r\n\r\ndiabetes  in  children, I come to know that my patients  will\r\n\r\nonly get serious about looking after themselves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  they  have  accepted the diagnosis and understand  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  a lifelong condition that will not go  away,  but\r\n\r\nwhich they can battle and overcome.  Such patients respond to\r\n\r\ntreatment  better  and  faster once they  have  embraced  the\r\n\r\nchallenge  of  tackling the disease for  themselves  and  get\r\n\r\nserious about taking control of their own lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this situation is analogous to the process\r\n\r\nof  reinventing  Singapore, in that  we  need  to  undergo  a\r\n\r\npainful  restructuring of our economy and reinvent  ourselves\r\n\r\nas  a global city.  Our young people must buy into their  own\r\n\r\nversion  of  the  Singapore dream.  They will  need  to  help\r\n\r\nremake  Singapore many times within their own  lifetime.   We\r\n\r\nneed  to support them in their efforts, even if they  do  not\r\n\r\nget  it right first time round.  We need to imbue in them the\r\n\r\noptimism  born not of cocky arrogance in their own abilities,\r\n\r\nbut  in  a  deep  and binding belief that they  will  triumph\r\n\r\nwhatever  the odds because their forebears did so.   We  must\r\n\r\nteach them not to underestimate the competition, but also not\r\n\r\nto give up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that, in remaking Singapore, we need to create\r\n\r\na  national psyche that emphasises three aspects:  Firstly, a\r\n\r\nspirit of optimism and inquiry that seeks new challenges  and\r\n\r\nnew   opportunities  and  a  culture  that  recognises   that\r\n\r\nsometimes  failure is a necessary stopover  on  the  road  to\r\n\r\nsuccess.  Perhaps, in Singapore, we are too hard on those who\r\n\r\nfail the first time round.  Secondly, we need to have a sense\r\n\r\nof  humility about our present successes, one that recognises\r\n\r\nthe  need  to  continually  improve  and  commit  oneself  to\r\n\r\nexcellence.   And, thirdly, in echoing many of my  colleagues\r\n\r\nin this House, I believe that we must create a national ethos\r\n\r\nthat  emphasises the individual's obligation to active  civic\r\n\r\nmindedness and civic service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To instill this spirit of inquiry and a thirst for\r\n\r\nchallenges, we need to imbue in younger Singaporeans the idea\r\n\r\nthat  they  too  can  be  the authors of  their  own  success\r\n\r\nstories.  They do not need to follow the generally recognised\r\n\r\nGovernment model.  We need to communicate the stories of role\r\n\r\nmodels for economic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuccess  that  will resonate with our young.  Some  of  these\r\n\r\nmodels may not be the ones that we would recognise.  We  need\r\n\r\nto train our young to think business right from the start, to\r\n\r\nthink leadership, to think a \"can do\" spirit, right from  the\r\n\r\nschooldays.    I  know  many  of  our  budding  entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nactually  started doing business even in the  NS  days  using\r\n\r\nhandphones and pagers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can encourage this simply by allowing our young\r\n\r\npeople  to plan and run their own fun fairs and magazines  in\r\n\r\nschools,  sell  souvenir  T-shirts in  college,  run  service\r\n\r\nprojects   and  incubate  businesses  even  while  they   are\r\n\r\nschooling.   I know there are one or two of my CDC colleagues\r\n\r\nwho  actually have already done so.  At the tender age of 21,\r\n\r\nthey  have  already become CDC counsellors because they  were\r\n\r\nprepared  to throw in their two cents worth.  We  should  get\r\n\r\nthem to develop gadgets as part of their school projects, and\r\n\r\nhelp  them patent inventions and bring them to market.  Never\r\n\r\nmind  it  is not a commercial success.  I too have a  patent.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  a  commercial success but it saves  my  hospital\r\n\r\nmoney.   There is a thrill in learning the skills  needed  to\r\n\r\nget  a group of people to work together to raise money or  to\r\n\r\ncomplete  a project for the good of society.  This  sense  of\r\n\r\nachievement and confidence gained will spur our young  people\r\n\r\non  as  social and commercial entrepreneurs later.   Learning\r\n\r\nhow  to  run  service projects, whether locally  or  overseas\r\n\r\nvolunteers,  will  also ignite a spark of  social  conscience\r\n\r\nthat  will  often  blossom into a lifetime  of  volunteerism.\r\n\r\nLearning how to run these things, inter-school, inter-college\r\n\r\nor  inter-community also teaches our young people skills  and\r\n\r\npromotes   social  cohesion,  attributes  sorely  needed   in\r\n\r\nSingapore's future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who have left school prematurely, schemes to\r\n\r\nbring  them  back  to school, or at least to  bring  them  to\r\n\r\nformal  learning,  such  as YMCA Project  Bridge,  should  be\r\n\r\nencouraged.    Perhaps,  we  also  need  to   consider   more\r\n\r\neducational support for those who would succeed if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey only have a little bit more help in our school system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to inspire our youths by showing them heroes\r\n\r\nthey  can understand and identify with, heroes not only  from\r\n\r\nSingapore, but from this globalised world that they can apply\r\n\r\nto Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History buffs may know the lessons of Venice and Hong\r\n\r\nKong  vis-a-vis  Shanghai, and they  may  also  realise  that\r\n\r\nLondon is still a financial centre despite the decline of the\r\n\r\nBritish   Empire.   But  when  it   comes  to   our   younger\r\n\r\ngeneration,  they may be more inspired by the men  and  ideas\r\n\r\nbehind household names, such as Nokia, McDonald's, IBM,  Sony\r\n\r\nand Samsung.  They need to hear how Steve Jobs and Bill Gates\r\n\r\nmade their way, and their fortunes, and how the inventors  of\r\n\r\nvelcro, post it pads and the humble zipper seem to have  come\r\n\r\nupon  the  great discoveries they made their fortunes.   They\r\n\r\nalso  need  to know the nature of the competition,  and  that\r\n\r\nChina  now  produces modern washing machines  that  can  also\r\n\r\nchurn butter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to hear also about our own Singapore role\r\n\r\nmodels.  Not only do they need to know the stories of  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister, CK Tang and Lee Kong Chian, but also about Creative\r\n\r\nTechnologies, our own poets and painters, our own  innovative\r\n\r\nmushroom  growers, internationalised prata  and  popiah  skin\r\n\r\nmakers,   orchid  exporters,  aeroponic  vegetable   growers,\r\n\r\nfishball makers and, yes, even our entertainers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all the possible role models for our young people\r\n\r\nare  well  known  to  the media.  One of  my  own  grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders, a Mr Tay, started out as an apprentice in one of our\r\n\r\nlocal  shipyards,  then struck out on his  own  to  become  a\r\n\r\nsuccessful subcontractor to shipyards.  Although he is mainly\r\n\r\nconversant only in Mandarin, he now has business interests in\r\n\r\nMyanmar, Batam, and even in Australia.  His is an example  of\r\n\r\na  local  SME  made  good,  despite his  own  limited  formal\r\n\r\neducation.  I believe many can learn much from his example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these examples to be effective, they need to be\r\n\r\nwidely  known.   They  need to become part  of  the  myth  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Our young people need to hear the stories of  our\r\n\r\nlocal  role  models, not just to be aired on occasional  news\r\n\r\nspecials,  but to be propagated in our magazines,  serialised\r\n\r\ninto  TV dramas, made into comics and perhaps even made  into\r\n\r\ncomputer games, and made into part of our local folklore.  We\r\n\r\nwould also do well to have a young businessman's council,  or\r\n\r\na young inventor's chat show.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should consider the road less travelled to be no less\r\n\r\nvalid,  especially  when they lead  to  success.   We  should\r\n\r\ncelebrate those who clawed their way back to success from the\r\n\r\nranks   of   the   scholastically  challenged,   either   via\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial  ladder  or  via  an  alternative  scholastic\r\n\r\nladder.   The knowledge that your own countrymen  have  tried\r\n\r\nand  made it, even though they may have tasted failure  along\r\n\r\nthe  way,  this  is  powerful stuff.  This is  about  winning\r\n\r\nhearts  right  from  an early age.  We must  tell  our  young\r\n\r\npeople that they should not be like the proverbial frog in  a\r\n\r\nwell thinking themselves superior to others around them.   25\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  my  mother,  then a teacher,  told  me  she  had\r\n\r\nstudents who had never been to Orchard Road.  Just before she\r\n\r\nretired, she told me of how her current students in the  very\r\n\r\nsame  school  were  now comparing travel notes  about  China,\r\n\r\nAustralia and the USA.  However, we should make sure that our\r\n\r\nchildren  do  not  just become ugly Singaporeans,  known  for\r\n\r\npassing  loud  comments  about the relative  backwardness  of\r\n\r\nplaces that we visit, because pride comes before fall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my travels as an advocate for diabetes knowledge, I\r\n\r\nhave  realised  that whatever lead we Singaporeans  think  we\r\n\r\nhave  in technology or language or ability to understand  the\r\n\r\nlocal  culture obviously is fast disappearing.   Our  biggest\r\n\r\nstumbling block may well be a misplaced confidence in our own\r\n\r\nadvantages.  Our regional neighbours are at varying stages of\r\n\r\neconomic  development.  Some may seem backward, but some  are\r\n\r\nalready better than us in certain areas.  We need\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  teach  our  children to be humble  when  we  visit  these\r\n\r\ncountries and to learn from them, to appreciate the  cultural\r\n\r\ndiversity,  and to be inspired to see these as new  lands  of\r\n\r\nopportunity, new lands where they might want to do business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should continue to send our young people abroad for\r\n\r\nschool trips, even in these troubled times because we need to\r\n\r\nopen  their  eyes to poverty, to opportunities  for  service,\r\n\r\nopportunities  for commerce and to understand the  people  of\r\n\r\nthe  region  better.  We should encourage  the  work  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  International Foundation to send  more  people  as\r\n\r\nvolunteers representing Singapore.  Surveys by the SIF showed\r\n\r\nthat young people who had done overseas volunteer stints were\r\n\r\nmore  likely to be volunteers in Singapore upon their return.\r\n\r\nThese   people   will  not  only  develop  a  greater   civil\r\n\r\nconsciousness towards our own citizens, but they will also be\r\n\r\nbetter  able  to function as global Singaporeans,  rooted  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  yet  able to take on  jobs  and  do  business\r\n\r\nglobally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how about ourselves, this current generation, as\r\n\r\nchange  agents  for  a  better  Singapore?   As  the  current\r\n\r\ngeneration  of adult Singaporeans, we can do a  lot  more  to\r\n\r\nshow  our  young  that  they  can  have  confidence  in   our\r\n\r\ngeneration yet.  Let me just offer three suggestions before I\r\n\r\nclose:  Firstly, if you are a boss, consider hiring an  older\r\n\r\nworker.   He or she may have been retrenched, but  may  still\r\n\r\nhave  an  agile mind and an able body.  Sure,  you  could  be\r\n\r\nwrong.   You may have to sack him soon.  But if you take  the\r\n\r\ntrouble to consider the individual and not just the age,  and\r\n\r\nput  yourself in his shoes, you may realise that one day, you\r\n\r\ntoo  might  want someone else to give you a chance  to  prove\r\n\r\nyourself.  Young or old, degree or no degree, I find that  it\r\n\r\nis actually the job attitude that makes the difference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, let us not price ourselves out of the market\r\n\r\nwhatever our field is.  We must consider that we cost more to\r\n\r\nhire than most other people in the region, so whatever we are\r\n\r\ndoing, let us aim for excellence, let us aim to deliver value\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  money.   Quality always commands a premium, but  working\r\n\r\nsmart enables you to charge less and yet earn more.  Once you\r\n\r\nhave  tried a new chicken rice stall that is as good  as  the\r\n\r\nold  one but gives you more chicken for the same dollar,  you\r\n\r\nmay  not  want to eat at the old store anymore.   In  Europe,\r\n\r\nEasyjet is flying rings round established airlines because it\r\n\r\noffers  good  value at low cost.  SIA and PSA  are  companies\r\n\r\nwhich,  to  my  simple doctor's mind, need to  consider  what\r\n\r\ntheir consumers are saying about their perceived value,  even\r\n\r\nthough they may currently be at the top of the pile.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, when in a position to decide or administer a\r\n\r\npolicy,  consider if there is something you could do to  make\r\n\r\nanother  Singaporean's life easier, his business  less  of  a\r\n\r\nstruggle.   The  provision  of more temporary  heavy  vehicle\r\n\r\nparks  in  the  light  of  our  slowdown  in  public  housing\r\n\r\ndevelopment comes to mind.  Our civil servants and  statutory\r\n\r\nboards  do  need to consider that together with our  business\r\n\r\ncommunity, we, together, represent Singapore Inc, and our aim\r\n\r\nis  to  make it happen, not tell each other why it cannot  be\r\n\r\ndone.   I  am  sure  that preservation  of  policy  aims  and\r\n\r\ntransparency can co-exist with compassion and flexibility  in\r\n\r\napplication of policy.  It may take a little effort, but that\r\n\r\ncan and should be the Singapore cachet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans love food, so permit me to use one last\r\n\r\nanalogy.    Singapore   is  like  an  established   up-market\r\n\r\nrestaurant  in a neighbourhood that is seeing a  lot  of  new\r\n\r\neateries  spring up.  Our items on the menu are good,  but  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit pricey.  We need to ask ourselves whether we  can\r\n\r\nreally  keep  attracting the business  by  just  giving  good\r\n\r\nvalue,  or  whether we will need to lower prices to  survive,\r\n\r\nand  whether we need to put completely new items on the menu.\r\n\r\nI  think  we need all three, and fast.  Maersk and  Evergreen\r\n\r\nevidently  feel that good price outweighs good service.   How\r\n\r\nmany more out there feel the same?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion of Thanks to the\r\n\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.18 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry and</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport the Motion of Thanks to the President.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>We will prevail and emerge flying</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming in at the tail end of the debate, I have had\r\n\r\nthe  privilege of listening to my colleagues' thoughtful  and\r\n\r\nimpassioned views on what Singapore needs to do to go forward\r\n\r\nand  thrive  in  a  very different world.  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\ncomment on two priorities which stand out in the debate.  The\r\n\r\nfirst,  on  what we need as individuals and, the  second,  on\r\n\r\nwhat we need as a society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Twin priorities</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Singaporeans have to be more self-reliant, more\r\n\r\nrobust  as  individuals, less dependent on Government.   Many\r\n\r\nMembers have expressed this need for greater resilience.   Mr\r\n\r\nSeng  Han  Thong  called for a camel spirit, not  an  ostrich\r\n\r\nspirit,  among third-generation Singaporeans, and Dr Ong  Seh\r\n\r\nHong  called for flying dragons, not earthworms - all  these,\r\n\r\nno  doubt, adding to the diversity of the new Singapore  eco-system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we have to redouble our efforts to stay together\r\n\r\nas  a  people.   Government has to engage  Singaporeans  and,\r\n\r\nparticularly,   young   Singaporeans,   more   actively   and\r\n\r\ndemonstrate that it is sincere in doing so.  But Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave  to  themselves  take ownership of efforts  to  build  a\r\n\r\nstrong  Singapore society to enhance our multi-racial compact\r\n\r\nand  carry forward the Singapore Cause that Mr Khaw Boon  Wan\r\n\r\nspoke about.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>A new culture</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the views expressed by many of my\r\n\r\ncolleagues on these two priorities.  At the core, we  need  a\r\n\r\nnew culture, a new spirit, to take Singapore and Singaporeans\r\n\r\nforward in a new and very different world.  We need a culture\r\n\r\nof rugged economic individualism.  But it has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be a culture that sees value in every citizen, celebrates\r\n\r\nalternative  paths  to  success, and  preserves  a  deep  and\r\n\r\nabiding  sense among all Singaporeans that we share a  future\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no choice but to go the way of economic\r\n\r\nindividualism.  We have to encourage individuals to  do  well\r\n\r\nin the marketplace and earn great rewards.  We need many more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  willing  to stand out, do  things  differently,\r\n\r\ntake a risk and occasionally go against the tide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need this new culture not only to succeed in\r\n\r\nthrowing up a stronger core of entrepreneurs, but to  develop\r\n\r\na more innovative people.  It will be what gives us advantage\r\n\r\nagainst  the  competition  and enables  us  to  achieve  good\r\n\r\ngrowth.   This  new culture will take time to evolve  and  it\r\n\r\nwill have many implications for Singapore society.  How do we\r\n\r\nensure  that those who do well in the market and earn  higher\r\n\r\nincomes  will  not feel they stand apart from and  above  the\r\n\r\nrest?   How far should we intervene in the market or seek  to\r\n\r\nmoderate the consequences of the market, whether through  our\r\n\r\nfiscal policies, HDB subsidies or a social safety net?  These\r\n\r\nare not trivial questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many societies have succeeded in preserving a true\r\n\r\nspirit of togetherness and cohesion while holding to a spirit\r\n\r\nof enterprise and economic individualism.  In most societies,\r\n\r\neconomic  individualism has worked against  social  cohesion.\r\n\r\nAnd   policies  and  attitudes  aimed  at  preserving  social\r\n\r\ncohesion  have  often worked against a culture of  enterprise\r\n\r\nand economic individualism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans have the most enterprising culture among\r\n\r\nthe  advanced  countries.  In strictly economic  terms,  they\r\n\r\nhave  outperformed the rest.  They have been able  to  do  so\r\n\r\nbecause, more than other societies, Americans accept the free\r\n\r\nplay of market forces.  Individuals are more willing to adapt\r\n\r\nto  changes, develop the next product, find the next  market,\r\n\r\nlook for the next opportunity.  Americans accept as fair that\r\n\r\nindividuals be rewarded in the market for their energies  and\r\n\r\ntheir enterprise.  They also welcome the best\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  brightest  foreigners into their society,  give  them  a\r\n\r\nplace and make them feel at home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US has a wider inequality of incomes and wealth than\r\n\r\nmost  societies. But Americans tolerate inequality  and  even\r\n\r\nregard  much  of  it  as  fair because  of  the  reality  and\r\n\r\nperception  of social mobility in the US.  It is  a  powerful\r\n\r\nand  popular ethos - that anyone can get ahead if he puts  in\r\n\r\nthe  effort.   Contrast with Europe.  Because there  is  less\r\n\r\nsocial  mobility  in  European societies,  there  is  greater\r\n\r\npopular  demand in Europe for government to fight  inequality\r\n\r\nthan there is in the States.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans' non-egalitarian attitude to capitalism,\r\n\r\nand  their greater acceptance of creative destruction in  the\r\n\r\ncorporate  world,  has produced superior  economic  outcomes.\r\n\r\nFor  every NTT  DoCoMo or Vivendi,  there are many more  Wal-Marts, Intels and Microsofts.  More important, jobs in the US\r\n\r\nhave  grown  more rapidly than in any other advanced  society\r\n\r\nover  the  last  two decades.   And they have  had  a  faster\r\n\r\nincrease in average productivity and standards of living.  It\r\n\r\nhas  produced better results for the majority, not  just  the\r\n\r\nwealthy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But American society is not cohesive. They rally\r\n\r\naround magnificently in crisis, as September 11th showed, and\r\n\r\nhave  a fervent  belief in certain American ideals - but  the\r\n\r\nUS  is  otherwise  not  a  tightly  bound  society.   Wealthy\r\n\r\nAmericans  make large contributions to charity, as  Madam  Ho\r\n\r\nGeok  Choo  has mentioned, but it does not change  the  basic\r\n\r\nreality  of  a somewhat disparate society.  The affluent  and\r\n\r\nthe  upwardly-mobile live their lives quite separate from the\r\n\r\nless-skilled if they wish, moving out to the suburbs and even\r\n\r\nout of the cities altogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japanese are most unlike the US in social culture.\r\n\r\nThey shun individualism and place a premium on modesty, group\r\n\r\ndecision-making, and on sharing the credit.   They  succeeded\r\n\r\nas   a   people  for  40  years,  caught  up  with  the  West\r\n\r\neconomically  and  surpassed the West  in  some  areas.   But\r\n\r\nJapan's system of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsensual decision-making and its highly egalitarian culture\r\n\r\nare  now  holding it back.  The system is geared to  avoiding\r\n\r\npain,  which  means  avoiding reform.  Farmers,  construction\r\n\r\ncompanies  and corporate dinosaurs have greater influence  on\r\n\r\ngovernment  policies than the needs of the  overall  economy.\r\n\r\nThere is a profound loss of confidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Europeans have a more congenial and cohesive culture\r\n\r\nthan the US.  They are also  absorbing lessons from the US on\r\n\r\nhow  to  create an environment for growth, although of course\r\n\r\nthe  Europeans would not say they are learning from  the  US.\r\n\r\nThey are cutting taxes, trying to roll back the welfare state\r\n\r\nand putting in place US-style capital market discipline.  But\r\n\r\nthe  differences between  Europe and the US  lie  deeper,  in\r\n\r\nthe  culture and outlook of individuals on either side of the\r\n\r\nAtlantic.  Unlike the US, the Europeans view the world  as  a\r\n\r\nzero-sum game - one person's gain is another's loss.  And  so\r\n\r\nthey  seek to preserve the status quo.  It is a culture  that\r\n\r\nblocks  out  newcomers, start-ups and up-starts,  those  with\r\n\r\nideas  and innovations that can unseat the incumbent  players\r\n\r\nand generate growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So although there is great egalitarianism in European\r\n\r\nculture,  and a genuine concern on the part of the successful\r\n\r\nfor those lower down the economic ladder, the system produces\r\n\r\nless  growth, fewer jobs and higher unemployment.  It  is  an\r\n\r\negalitarian   culture  that  does  not  produce   egalitarian\r\n\r\noutcomes, especially for those without jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Embracing the Market</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have to embrace the market and\r\n\r\naccept  the inequalities thrown up by the marketplace  if  we\r\n\r\nare  to succeed in generating growth and creating jobs in our\r\n\r\nnext  phase  of  development.  We  cannot  shrink  from  this\r\n\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a city-state, competing with cities within\r\n\r\ncountries.   They are not just cities, but cities  that  draw\r\n\r\nthe best talent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the most energetic people from across their countries and\r\n\r\nregions.   Cities  like  London  and  Zurich  within  Europe,\r\n\r\nShanghai and Guangzhou  drawing from China, New York and  San\r\n\r\nFrancisco  drawing from the world.  Over half of  New  York's\r\n\r\nresidents are either foreign-born or children of parents  who\r\n\r\nare  both  foreign-born.  Native New Yorkers do not  begrudge\r\n\r\nthe  presence  of foreigners who have settled  in  the  city.\r\n\r\nThey  know  that  New York throbs because it attracts  talent\r\n\r\nfrom  around the world in business, the professions  and  the\r\n\r\ncreative arts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to be the hub in Asia for business, small and\r\n\r\nlarge,   and  a  Mecca  for   talent.   We  have  to  develop\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  of  all  talents and spur  on  Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nsucceed.   But  we  also  have  to   move  further  ahead  in\r\n\r\nattracting  foreigners with the ideas, skills and connections\r\n\r\nthat  can contribute to Singapore's growth and vibrance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should continue to shift the emphasis of our tax\r\n\r\npolicies from redistribution to growth.  We have to move away\r\n\r\nfrom  the  egalitarian  approach.   We  should  give  greater\r\n\r\nincentive  for  anyone with the ability, guts and  energy  to\r\n\r\nsucceed to go as far as he can.  That way, we can succeed  as\r\n\r\na  country, generate more growth and more jobs.  It is not  a\r\n\r\nzero-sum game.  It is not a matter of favouring the  rich  or\r\n\r\nthe  clever,  but  of favouring a future of better  jobs  and\r\n\r\nbetter  incomes  for  all.   If  a  Singaporean  entrepreneur\r\n\r\nbecomes  a  billionaire,  our  \"Gini  coefficient\",  as   the\r\n\r\neconomists  put  it,  will \"worsen\" - we  will  have  greater\r\n\r\ninequality  -  but  we should be happy as  his  success  will\r\n\r\ncreate more jobs and better incomes for  others.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Strengthening Our Social Compact</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the market philosophy that we need for future growth\r\n\r\nwill not be viable in Singapore if we do not work hard on our\r\n\r\nsocial  compact.  We have to overcome the problem  that  many\r\n\r\nother  societies have faced, where economic freedom  has  not\r\n\r\ncoexisted  well  with social cohesion.   We  can  do  so,  by\r\n\r\nbuilding on our past strengths, preserving the trust  between\r\n\r\npeople and Government, and exercising\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstrong leadership wisely.  For the market-based philosophy to\r\n\r\nwork  and  be  accepted, Singaporeans who do very  well  must\r\n\r\nengage with and show concern for the rest of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot recreate the environment that threw up the\r\n\r\nsense of commitment to community that our early pioneers had,\r\n\r\nor   the   extraordinary  spirit  that  Singapore's  founding\r\n\r\ngeneration  had in building a new nation.  But we  will  find\r\n\r\nways  to  strengthen civic attachments and a sense of  shared\r\n\r\npurpose among all our citizens.  We have to do so through our\r\n\r\neducational institutions, our community organisations and, as\r\n\r\nRaymond Lim emphasised, through a more vibrant civil society.\r\n\r\nAnd  we  have  to  strengthen the  heartware  of  multiracial\r\n\r\nrelations,  as  Mr  Iswaran  and Mr  Ahmad  Khalis  spoke  on\r\n\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Social Mobility</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to work hard to preserve a sense of\r\n\r\nmobility  in Singapore society, especially through education.\r\n\r\nEvery  citizen  must know he is getting an  equal  chance  to\r\n\r\nimprove  himself  and  develop  his  talents.   We  have   to\r\n\r\nintervene earlier to help children from lower-income  groups.\r\n\r\nWe  have to raise standards of pre-school education so as  to\r\n\r\nnarrow  the gaps, as best we can, at the starting line  where\r\n\r\nchildren  begin their school education.  My colleagues,  Sir,\r\n\r\nhave  spoken  also of the importance of providing  a  \"second\r\n\r\nchance\"  to those who do not do well in school.  We  have  to\r\n\r\nexpand the paths to tertiary education, and provide the  full\r\n\r\nmenu  of  opportunities for life-long learning.  We may  even\r\n\r\nhave to provide classes for Members of Parliament seeking  an\r\n\r\nupgrade  in Cantonese karaoke.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need more varied heroes in education, who make good\r\n\r\nregardless  of how they started.  Like the ITE graduates  who\r\n\r\nmake  it  through polytechnic, some even through  university.\r\n\r\nOr  people like Mohamad Saberi Bakar who, not daunted by  his\r\n\r\nindifferent 'O' level grades, decided to catch up in his mid-20s by working hard for a diploma, then an advanced diploma\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  IT - his study room was the Changi Airport waving gallery\r\n\r\n-  and eventually went on to get his computer science degree.\r\n\r\nHe  now  works as an engineer.  Mr Saberi told The New  Paper\r\n\r\nthat  he  was  tired  of  the  \"underclass\"  tag  and  people\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that, as a Malay, he would have no opportunities.\r\n\r\nIn  his own words, \"Everyone has a chance  in Singapore.   No\r\n\r\nmatter  who you are  or what your background or race is.   It\r\n\r\nis just a matter of grabbing that chance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Redefining success</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, ultimately, Sir, we have to measure success not by\r\n\r\nwhether you get a university degree.  Everyone who puts  full\r\n\r\neffort into going as far as he can, and developing the talent\r\n\r\nhe  has, is a success.  Every ITE graduate who holds  down  a\r\n\r\njob  and  looks  for ways of upgrading his skills  every  few\r\n\r\nyears is an unqualified success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We inherit an East Asian tradition that reveres\r\n\r\nscholastic  success.  We also inherited an  education  system\r\n\r\nthat  was  geared  to  producing the  intellectual  elite  in\r\n\r\nBritain.   The  combination  of East  Asian  values  and  the\r\n\r\nacademic bias of the British system was a potent combination,\r\n\r\nand  has shaped attitudes among generations of parents.   All\r\n\r\nthat  mattered  to the British were your \"O\"s  and  \"A\"s  and\r\n\r\nwhich university you went to.  It is very different from  the\r\n\r\ntradition  in several European countries, where students  who\r\n\r\ngo  through  the technical route suffer no stigma.   We  have\r\n\r\nchanged   our   system  over  the  years,  built  world-class\r\n\r\ninstitutions in our polytechnics and ITE.  ITE graduates  got\r\n\r\njobs  faster  than university and polytechnic graduates  last\r\n\r\nyear,  and with good starting  salaries.  But some old social\r\n\r\nattitudes remain and we have to change them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to remove the sense of failure among those who\r\n\r\ndo  not  make it all the way up the academic ladder.  But  we\r\n\r\nhave  to avoid going the way the British have since done,  of\r\n\r\nconverting  polytechnics into universities and  creating  new\r\n\r\ndegrees  -  in sports, tourism studies and so on  -  so  that\r\n\r\nmore  people  can make it through university.  We  should  be\r\n\r\nhonest and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npragmatic  in  our  education agenda.   We  should  recognise\r\n\r\ndifferent  abilities  and give them each the best  chance  of\r\n\r\nflowering.   We  should avoid lowering standards  and  giving\r\n\r\nstudents a false sense of academic achievement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must continue to show compassion to families and\r\n\r\nindividuals who end up in distress through no fault of  their\r\n\r\nown  or  no lack of effort.  But we should continue to  focus\r\n\r\nthis  effort at the local level, through the CDCs  and   CCCs\r\n\r\nand  through  voluntary actions by private organisations  and\r\n\r\ncitizens.  That way, we develop strong local community  bonds\r\n\r\nand  ensure that assistance goes to those who are willing  to\r\n\r\nput  in  the  effort to help themselves.  That way  we  guard\r\n\r\nagainst a culture of dependence on the state.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young must have opportunity to contribute to the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   They have to develop the instinct of wanting  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  something  much  larger  than  themselves.    Our\r\n\r\nschools  are  providing a range of activities  to  make  this\r\n\r\npossible, whether through local projects or regional ventures\r\n\r\nthat  bring students face-to-face with the realities of  life\r\n\r\noutside Singapore's prosperous, comfortable conditions.   The\r\n\r\nenthusiasm of many of the students is remarkable.  One school\r\n\r\ngirl, Liu Xiaojun, 17, borrowed from friends to fund her trip\r\n\r\nto  East  Timor  recently  on  a humanitarian  mission.   Her\r\n\r\nfather,  a  technician, had been retrenched before her  trip.\r\n\r\nXiaojun  has now found a part-time job as a piano teacher  to\r\n\r\nrepay her loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Taking the Road Less Travelled</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need a breed of young Singaporeans with a spirit\r\n\r\nof  inventiveness and an ability to take failure  in  stride.\r\n\r\nMore  of  our  young have to be willing to be unorthodox  and\r\n\r\ntake  the  road  less  travelled.  They must  learn  to  take\r\n\r\nknocks, be prepared to run into a rut from time to time, know\r\n\r\nhow to get out of it and look for another way to get ahead in\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will take time to develop a more enterprising spirit\r\n\r\nin Singapore, a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwillingness to be different, and think differently.   But  it\r\n\r\nis  not  totally absent among our young.  The eight  national\r\n\r\nsailors  in  junior  college, university or  early  in  their\r\n\r\ncareers,  who  recently  put a hold  on  their  education  or\r\n\r\ncareers  in order to train full-time for the Asian games  are\r\n\r\nan  example of this new spirit.  One of them, Stanley Tan,  a\r\n\r\n27  year-old   who   had completed his Bar examinations   has\r\n\r\ndecided  to postpone his legal career until after the  Athens\r\n\r\nOlympics.   As he put it, \"I want to see how far  I  can  go.\r\n\r\nFrankly,  I  am looking at 30 or 40 years of a legal  career.\r\n\r\nTaking  some  time  off is a drop in the  ocean.\"   They  are\r\n\r\ntaking  time-off to do something they can do well in, and  do\r\n\r\nsomething which they take passion in doing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we should not try too hard to develop\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs,  or  to  build  an  entrepreneurial   culture.\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurs  are self-made.  But we have  to  provide  more\r\n\r\nspace  for our young to develop a free-spiritedness  that  is\r\n\r\nlacking  in  Singapore  today,  and  that  is  essential  for\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial society.  We should avoid being,  as  Mr  Gan\r\n\r\nKim  Yong says, a perfectionist society.  The Chinese have  a\r\n\r\nsaying, clear water has no fish (qing shui wu yu).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree in spirit with Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Assoc. Prof.\r\n\r\nLow Seow Chay, Mr Chew Heng Ching and other MPs who felt that\r\n\r\nthe excessive amount of time that our students spend in\r\n\r\nexamination preparation is not ideal.  It is especially not\r\n\r\nideal for our more academically able, to prepare for both\r\n\r\ntheir \"O\" and \"A\" levels in a space of three years before\r\n\r\nproceeding to university.  It will not prepare them well for\r\n\r\nthe future.  It is one of the reasons why the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation has embarked on a review of the structure and\r\n\r\ncurriculum for the upper secondary and junior college levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are no easy solutions to the problem of\r\n\r\nexamination  pressures in a society whose very strength  lies\r\n\r\nin  being meritocratic and achievement-oriented.  We  do  not\r\n\r\nwant to water down our standards, or lose the transparency of\r\n\r\nthe assessment system which allows all students to compete on\r\n\r\na fair basis for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentry  into schools or the tertiary institutions.  I am  sure\r\n\r\nmany of my colleagues in Parliament would join us in thinking\r\n\r\nthrough the changes which can be realistically achieved,  and\r\n\r\nwhich represent real improvement  over our current system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Building on Strong Foundations</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have come this far over 40 years\r\n\r\nbecause of extraordinary feats of leadership. We are building\r\n\r\na  new Singapore on a strong foundation - an aspiring people,\r\n\r\na  system of multiracialism and meritocracy that still  makes\r\n\r\nus  special, a labour movement that favours growth  and  good\r\n\r\ngovernance,  fair and transparent.  It has given Singapore  a\r\n\r\nstrong brand name in every capital  across the world.  No one\r\n\r\nseriously thinks of us as a little red dot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot erode these assets, the core of our social\r\n\r\ncapital.  But we need new capabilities to succeed against the\r\n\r\ncompetition, and to keep our sense of well-being as a people.\r\n\r\nThese  new  capabilities will require us  to  evolve  a  new,\r\n\r\ntougher  social  culture.  We can do  so.   We  are  a  young\r\n\r\nsociety,  still mobile, without encrusted values and  habits,\r\n\r\nstill engaging our future with vigour.  We will prevail,  and\r\n\r\nemerge flying dragons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving\r\n\r\nme  the  opportunity to speak on the motion which I  rise  in\r\n\r\nsupport of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President's Address is a timely and sobering\r\n\r\nreminder   of  the  most  serious  challenge  that  confronts\r\n\r\nSingapore since independence.  Rarely have we been faced with\r\n\r\nan  uncertain future that requires the complete  resolve  and\r\n\r\nsingle-minded  determination of the nation to overcome.   Why\r\n\r\nare we so despondent about the future?  It does not take much\r\n\r\nto see why.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, unemployment is hovering around 5% and\r\n\r\nrising.  Many of those who are unemployed are the middle aged\r\n\r\nand not very highly educated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither  are  they in tune with the demands of the  knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy.   Even as I am speaking now, I know for a fact  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  many, including those in the GLCs,  who  are  now\r\n\r\nbeing  retrenched or about to be retrenched  because  of  the\r\n\r\npresent  state  of  the  economy.  We are  speaking  here  of\r\n\r\nworkers who are robbed of their dignity and pride to  earn  a\r\n\r\ndecent  living, not by circumstances of their  own  choosing,\r\n\r\nbut  by  forces beyond their control.  Sir, we  are  speaking\r\n\r\nhere  of the ineluctable sweep of the forces of globalisation\r\n\r\nthat  have taken many countries by storm.  The breaking  down\r\n\r\nof  trade  barriers would mean that for many, the  goods  and\r\n\r\nservices that are now being produced, can be produced cheaper\r\n\r\nelsewhere.   For  many of the emerging economies  with  their\r\n\r\nteeming  masses to feed, this would be a welcome  opportunity\r\n\r\nindeed  to  provide  cheap labour and  to  offer  lower  cost\r\n\r\ncentres of production.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, for others, the availability of\r\n\r\nalternative  venues  of operation would  mean  that  they  no\r\n\r\nlonger  appear  as  attractive to  foreign  investors  or  as\r\n\r\ncompetitive as the foreign rivals.  What results  then  is  a\r\n\r\nsteady  flight  of  capital  or a  continuing  relocation  of\r\n\r\noperations  to  other  venues which are cheaper  to  operate.\r\n\r\nWhen  this  happens, it is often the workers of  closed  down\r\n\r\noffices or factories who suffer.  We see this when the labour-intensive  industries  here started to  relocate  to  cheaper\r\n\r\nproduction  centres  in Indonesia, Malaysia  and,  in  recent\r\n\r\nyears, in China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who have had the good fortune of visiting\r\n\r\nChina  recently will attest to the rising and growing Chinese\r\n\r\nindustrial might.  This newfound confidence among the Chinese\r\n\r\nthat comes with the rising level of wealth and the opening of\r\n\r\nthe  country is something which is self-evident.  And greater\r\n\r\nstill  will  be  the  confidence  of  the  Chinese  as  China\r\n\r\nintegrates  itself  further  into  the  international   trade\r\n\r\nthrough  the  WTO  in  the  hope of  becoming  a  first-world\r\n\r\neconomy.  The China that we know of today is a very different\r\n\r\nChina  that  we knew of when our pioneers first stepped  foot\r\n\r\ninto that country 20 years ago or perhaps earlier.  Then they\r\n\r\nwere\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neager  to  learn from us and looked upon us for guidance  and\r\n\r\ninvestment capital.  We know that they have since moved on to\r\n\r\nbecome  like  a  giant vacuum that sucks  up  new  investment\r\n\r\ncapital  in  Asia.   With a critical mass of  more  than  one\r\n\r\nbillion people and offering cheap labour in a huge market, it\r\n\r\nbecomes  increasingly  difficult  to  justify  why  investors\r\n\r\nshould  choose Singapore as a preferred choice of investment.\r\n\r\nChina  has  now  become our most awesome  competitor  in  the\r\n\r\nmarketplace for investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how should we deal with global competition and its\r\n\r\neffects?   For many, the natural instinct is to fight  it  by\r\n\r\nshutting  out foreign import.  We have, in Singapore,  chosen\r\n\r\nthe path of riding the wave of globalisation.  Rather than to\r\n\r\nresist  it,  we  open  up our market to outside  competition.\r\n\r\nFrom  finance to manufacturing and services, there is nothing\r\n\r\nhere that is protected from competition.  Foreign parties who\r\n\r\nfeel  that  they can produce cheaper and perform  better  can\r\n\r\nexpect  to do business here.  For many, the process has  been\r\n\r\npainful.    The consolidation of financial services to  brace\r\n\r\nitself for competition from foreign banks will see more  than\r\n\r\n2,000  jobs  being  lost in the process.   Sir,  we  are  not\r\n\r\ntalking  of  some  statistics here.  We are talking  here  of\r\n\r\nfathers and mothers without a job and an income to bring home\r\n\r\nso that there will be food on the table and the bills will be\r\n\r\npaid.   Not  only  that,  with  the  hollowing  out  of   our\r\n\r\nindustries, more jobs will be lost.  Indeed, even if  we  are\r\n\r\nable  to  hunker down and wait through the present  storm  of\r\n\r\neconomic  recession, there is no assurance that life,  as  we\r\n\r\nknow it, will be the same again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his Address, the President did reiterate that in\r\n\r\norder  for  us to stay competitive, our business  environment\r\n\r\nmust be highly conducive.  In keeping with this objective, we\r\n\r\nhave stated that our infrastructure must continue to be world-class  at competitive cost and our spirit of enterprise  must\r\n\r\nbe  strong.   I  have  no problems with  the  broadly  stated\r\n\r\nintention of our Government.  However, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo have some reservations about how far a focus on continuing\r\n\r\nto  improve our business environment is going to take us.  In\r\n\r\nthe  present  climate,  I  see that  there  are  three  major\r\n\r\nconsiderations in this approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I believe we are at the present level of\r\n\r\ndevelopment   of   our  infrastructure  where   any   further\r\n\r\nimprovements would only bring about a diminishing  return  on\r\n\r\nour  investments.  The fact remains that economic outlook for\r\n\r\nthe  region  will  continue to remain weak in  the  next  few\r\n\r\nyears.   We  are,  as  they  say,  a  good  house  in  a  bad\r\n\r\nneighbourhood.  As long as there is no obvious upside in  the\r\n\r\noutlook  for  the  region,  any further  improvement  to  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  is  going  to only provide  us  with  limited\r\n\r\ngains.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to foster a strong spirit of enterprise\r\n\r\namongst Singaporeans requires a milieu that supports  it.   I\r\n\r\nam not that optimistic, Sir, in this regard.  Over the years,\r\n\r\nwe  have not actively nurtured the growth of a strong body of\r\n\r\nsmall  and  medium enterprises.  Instead, we have  chosen  to\r\n\r\nfocus  strongly on the GLCs as providing the engine of growth\r\n\r\nof  our  industry.  For many of these GLCs, it is  said  that\r\n\r\nthey have an unfair advantage on our local turf.  It was  not\r\n\r\ntoo  long  ago only that we learn of a GLC going  into  roast\r\n\r\nmeat  business  here as well.  It is arguable  that  for  the\r\n\r\nGLCs,  the yearning for contracts and business to stay  alive\r\n\r\nis   not   of  the  same  extent  as  the  small  and  medium\r\n\r\nenterprises.   The relative weakness of these desires  should\r\n\r\nalso  arguably mean that our instinct, at least for the GLCs,\r\n\r\nfor  enterprise and business will not be as well-honed as  it\r\n\r\nshould have been.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, when you have the best of brightest\r\n\r\nbrought  up  in an environment that looks down  at  failures,\r\n\r\nwhose primary pursuit of university education is to get well-paying secure jobs, and to avoid taking risk, one is not  too\r\n\r\nhopeful  that  you can raise from this rank  of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmany more successful entrepreneurs.  Besides, even if we  try\r\n\r\nto nurture in our young the spirit of enterprise, our ability\r\n\r\nto raise them in sufficient numbers is largely constrained by\r\n\r\nour lack of critical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmass.  Both China and India have population sizes that exceed\r\n\r\na  billion  each.   We have four million.  Sir,  how  can  we\r\n\r\neffectively compete in number with human talent?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, looking primarily internally, as our\r\n\r\nGovernment's  approach seems to suggest, for new  initiatives\r\n\r\nto  re-orientate our economy may inadvertently  cause  us  to\r\n\r\nlose our broad focus.  Let me illustrate.  We have identified\r\n\r\nthe  life sciences as the next wave for our economy.  In this\r\n\r\nregard,  we  are  committing much of  our  resources  towards\r\n\r\npreparing  our  people  for this undertaking.   We  are  also\r\n\r\nspending much time and effort building up infrastructure  for\r\n\r\nresearch and development in life sciences in Singapore.  Yet,\r\n\r\nwe  know  that the centres for cutting edge research in  life\r\n\r\nsciences  are to be found in the west.  Brave as our attempts\r\n\r\nmay  be,  it will be many more years, Sir, before Singapore's\r\n\r\nresearch  and  development centres in the life  sciences  can\r\n\r\ncome up to the standards of the west, if at all we get there.\r\n\r\nSir, there are many who have asked the question of whether or\r\n\r\nnot,  we are better off if we had just leveraged on the  more\r\n\r\ndeveloped  science  industry of  the  west,  either  by  more\r\n\r\nintensive  collaboration or direct investment overseas,  than\r\n\r\ntry  to establish a separate physical base in Singapore.   My\r\n\r\nfear is identifying new growth areas for our country may well\r\n\r\nembark us on a physical expansion of resources that will give\r\n\r\nus a very limited outcome, when we may be better off building\r\n\r\nup our R&D industries overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some years ago in this Chamber, I had suggested\r\n\r\nthat  for  us  to  survive  in this  country  into  the  next\r\n\r\nmillennium,   we   must  increasingly   look   overseas   for\r\n\r\nopportunities.  Here, I am not just referring  to  industrial\r\n\r\npark  developments  or  investment into  areas  that  we  are\r\n\r\ncomfortable  with.  I am referring to, as I have  alluded  to\r\n\r\nearlier,  investments into the new areas  such  as  the  life\r\n\r\nsciences and info-communications technologies.  We have, over\r\n\r\nthe  years,  built up a substantial amount of reserves.   Our\r\n\r\nbudget  surplus between FY96 and FY2000 was in the region  of\r\n\r\n$17.535 billion.  Like a prudent farmer, we intend that these\r\n\r\nreserves be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstored for use in difficult times when the harvest is not  so\r\n\r\nplentiful.  Again, like the prudent farmer,  we  should  also\r\n\r\nconsider using these reserves and husbanding our resources to\r\n\r\nlook  to new sources of revenue if what we bring in from  the\r\n\r\nfield  is  not  enough to provide for the  family.   With  an\r\n\r\naccumulated  surplus of approximately $17.535  billion,  that\r\n\r\nis, in the last term of Parliament, we could use some of that\r\n\r\nmoney to buy a substantial stake, if not, a controlling stake\r\n\r\nin  some  of these carefully chosen world-class companies  or\r\n\r\ncompanies with world-class potential.  We could then leverage\r\n\r\non  our  ownership  of these companies by  tapping  on  their\r\n\r\nmanagement  and technology know-how and in particular,  their\r\n\r\nability  in  brand  management and promotion  to  give  us  a\r\n\r\nheadstart  in  the new growth areas that we have  identified.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words,  Sir,  besides developing  our  bio-medical\r\n\r\nexpertise,  we  should  perhaps acquire  leading  bio-medical\r\n\r\ncompanies  and be plugged in immediately into the world  bio-medical grid.  We could use this opportunity to send our best\r\n\r\nand  brightest to learn from them, and hopefully,  from  this\r\n\r\nexperience,  we  could  build on a new  generation  of  young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  are savvy about the ways of  international\r\n\r\nmarketing and investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the present time, where the flow of information\r\n\r\nand  mode  of doing business is substantially different  from\r\n\r\nthe  pre-Internet era, we must learn to think out of the box.\r\n\r\nIncreasingly,  we have to ask ourselves whether  there  is  a\r\n\r\ncontinuing  need to ensure that companies be rooted  here  to\r\n\r\nserve the economic interests of Singapore.  In looking at the\r\n\r\nmodel  that I have proposed earlier, we could perhaps own  or\r\n\r\ncontrol  a  Fortune 500 company, headquartered in the  US  or\r\n\r\nEurope,  but  allow it to be an outpost for  Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\ngain the relevant experience needed to keep Singapore in tune\r\n\r\nwith  the demands of the international market place.  In this\r\n\r\nregard, we should perhaps take a leaf from the NUS, where  we\r\n\r\nlearned recently that they have, presumably to stay relevant,\r\n\r\ntaken to setting up outposts outside of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we are able to externalise our economy\r\n\r\nsubstantially  and  draw our revenue from this  second  wing,\r\n\r\nthere will be less pressure on us if the Singapore economy is\r\n\r\nnot  doing as well.  In fact, a thriving second wing  derived\r\n\r\nthrough prudent investments and acquisitions could well allow\r\n\r\nus  to have some inefficiency within our own economic sector.\r\n\r\nWe  do  not, for instance, have to be so ruthless  in  making\r\n\r\nthat segment of our workforce, the uneducated and middle-aged\r\n\r\nworkers, redundant because they are not able to compete  with\r\n\r\ntheir  counterparts in India, China or Indochina.  That  way,\r\n\r\nwe  can  keep  a  healthy balance between the  need  to  stay\r\n\r\ncompetitive to make a living, which our investments  and  our\r\n\r\nstakeholdings outside of Singapore can provide, and the  need\r\n\r\nto provide employment and to carry those Singaporeans who may\r\n\r\nnot be able to look after themselves, without having to worry\r\n\r\nabout cost efficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we are serious about pushing our people to\r\n\r\nconsider the world as our workplace, wherein to live  and  to\r\n\r\nwork,  I  think we must be prepared to make some adjustments.\r\n\r\nI shall dwell on one, ie, education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is widely known that amongst companies and\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  there is one stumbling block  in  sending  staff\r\n\r\nmembers  overseas, and that has to be with the  education  of\r\n\r\ntheir   children.   Every  parent  in  Singapore  knows   how\r\n\r\nimportant  the  second language is, and how important  it  is\r\n\r\nthat they must do well in the second language if they are  to\r\n\r\ndo  well  overall in school.  No serious parent will disagree\r\n\r\nthat  taking a child out of Singapore and placing him  in  an\r\n\r\nenvironment  where the second language is  hardly  spoken  or\r\n\r\nwritten,  will  have  a major impact on his  second  language\r\n\r\nability.   Hence, for parents with school going children,  it\r\n\r\nwould almost be impossible to send them overseas, unless  the\r\n\r\ncentres  of posting have Singapore style schools,  or  unless\r\n\r\nthey  can be assured that their children will not be severely\r\n\r\ndisavantaged when they return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that the Ministry of Education has a policy\r\n\r\nof  providing dispensation with the second language  for  the\r\n\r\nchild  for  a  year, if he went overseas and  did  some  time\r\n\r\nthere.   However, for many parents, that may not  be  enough.\r\n\r\nThe time has now come when the Ministry should perhaps review\r\n\r\nto see if they should be more flexible on the second language\r\n\r\nin  order to ease at least one worry amongst Singaporeans who\r\n\r\nmay  choose  to  answer the call of the  Government  to  work\r\n\r\noverseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in overcoming the challenges ahead, we will have to\r\n\r\nrely  on the larger home grown corporations since it is these\r\n\r\ncorporations  that  will  have the wherewithal  to  meet  the\r\n\r\ndemands  that these challenges bring.  Here, the  GLCs,  with\r\n\r\ntheir  resources and close proximity to the Government, could\r\n\r\nwell  be  suited for the work.  Much has been  said  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse about the role and performance of the GLCs.  Long after\r\n\r\nthe rumblings and grumblings in Parliament are over, there is\r\n\r\nstill this rather common perception that GLCs could have been\r\n\r\nbetter  run  and should preferably not be staffed  by  senior\r\n\r\nmanagers  who  had spent the better of their careers  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  service.  There is a common perception that  part  of\r\n\r\nour  problem has to do with the policy of keeping  our  civil\r\n\r\nservice  young.  What do we do with bright young senior  army\r\n\r\nofficers  who  we  retire at 45 or,  for that  matter,  young\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretaries who have served their time in  service?\r\n\r\nIt  has  been  said  that for many, they  find  their  second\r\n\r\ncareers in the GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no doubt as to the mental ability and the\r\n\r\nintegrity  of  civil servants who are seconded or  chosen  to\r\n\r\nspend  their second career, or some say retirement years,  in\r\n\r\nthe  GLCs.   However,  one  wonders whether  the  skill  sets\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  running a public organisation are the  same  as\r\n\r\nthat  of  running  an organisation that is  oriented  towards\r\n\r\nmaking  money.    Can we effectively move from  the  role  of\r\n\r\nbeing  a   guardian  to  being  an  entrepreneur  whose  sole\r\n\r\nobjective  is to go out and earn more money for the  company?\r\n\r\nIt  would be to our good fortune if they are able to make the\r\n\r\nmental switch.  But then again,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  if  they are not able to and are just content to  coast\r\n\r\nalong?   Typically,  in the West, if a  large  public  listed\r\n\r\ncompany  goes  through a bad patch, the CEO  and  the  senior\r\n\r\nmanagement  run  the  risk of losing their  jobs.   They  are\r\n\r\nassessed  by their current performance.  It does  not  matter\r\n\r\nwhether  they had been good in the past.  What should  matter\r\n\r\nis  how they are currently fairing compared to CEOs elsewhere\r\n\r\nof  similar companies.  Our difficulty here is the assumption\r\n\r\nthat  the talent pool is limited in Singapore and, therefore,\r\n\r\nif the civil servant has proven himself to be good at running\r\n\r\na   Ministry, he should, at the same time, be good at running\r\n\r\na  large  corporation.  There is a common perception that  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  it  is the same group of men circulating  amongst\r\n\r\nthe various corporations.  And unlike the civil service, they\r\n\r\ncould  well be there for the long haul.  Many have  commented\r\n\r\nto  me  that  the GLCs may turn in bad results, but  for  the\r\n\r\nsenior management, life goes on.  If the perception is  true,\r\n\r\nis this how we want to run these corporations and expect them\r\n\r\nto be world-class companies?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if part of the problem lies in our policy of\r\n\r\nkeeping the civil service young and, of course, the uniformed\r\n\r\nservices  young, we should perhaps now begin to  review  this\r\n\r\nproblem  to  see  if we should extend the retirement  age  of\r\n\r\nsenior officers, whether they be in the uniformed services or\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service.   Not  all of  the  developed  countries\r\n\r\nsubscribe   to  this  policy.   Embarrassingly   enough,   at\r\n\r\ninternational  conferences, we often find our civil  servants\r\n\r\namongst the youngest in the crowd, and sometimes by a  margin\r\n\r\nof  more than 10 years.  Something must be said of experience\r\n\r\nand  age.   No  amount  of  brilliance  can  be  an  adequate\r\n\r\nsubstitute  for  experience.  By pushing back the  retirement\r\n\r\nage  for  these very capable officers, I think we would  have\r\n\r\ntaken  away  the pressure to provide for their retirement  in\r\n\r\nthe private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no denying that we are at the most\r\n\r\nimportant crossroads of our nation's history.  It is  not  an\r\n\r\nexaggeration to say that our future destiny will depend  very\r\n\r\nmuch  on how we are able to resolve the present crisis.  Over\r\n\r\nthe past few days\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  debate  in this Chamber, I have heard remarks  and  pleas\r\n\r\nthat our Government and indeed our civil servants listen  and\r\n\r\nnot  just  hear the comments and suggestions on  how  we  can\r\n\r\nbetter  position Singapore for a better future.  I  sincerely\r\n\r\nhope  that  this time round, we will come out of this  crisis\r\n\r\nstronger  and better, with our bearings and policies enjoying\r\n\r\nthe full confidence of the people, because our Government has\r\n\r\ntaken serious account of the concerns of the silent majority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of Community Development and Sports (Mr Chan Soo Sen) (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion of\r\n\r\nThanks to the President moved by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days ago, I discussed with my grassroots leaders the\r\n\r\nPresident's Address and the debates in Parliament so  far  on\r\n\r\nthe  motion  of  thanks to the President.   These  grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders  told  me  that having heard the President's  Speech,\r\n\r\nthey  were  a  bit  worried.   And  having  heard  the  views\r\n\r\nexpressed   by   the   various  MPs,   they   felt   somewhat\r\n\r\ndisappointed.   Because  the President's  Speech  sketched  a\r\n\r\nscenario  of  a  sea  of  roaring waves  beset  with  crises.\r\n\r\nSubsequently,  when they read the reports in  the  press,  it\r\n\r\nappeared  as though all the MPs were suggesting that everyone\r\n\r\nshould be self-reliant.  They felt that the Government seemed\r\n\r\nto  have  flinched. They asked me whether the Government  had\r\n\r\nforgotten the strong mandate given to them by the voters some\r\n\r\nfive  months ago, with the understanding that the  Government\r\n\r\nwould bring them through the crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These grassroots leaders were very close to me, and that\r\n\r\nwas  why  they  were  so  candid in  telling  me  their  real\r\n\r\nfeelings.   This might well be the voice from  the  heart  of\r\n\r\nmany  fellow Singaporeans.  Of course, we must reassure  them\r\n\r\nthat the Government has been thinking of ways and means,  all\r\n\r\nthe  time, to solve the problems of its people.  If  they  do\r\n\r\nnot  believe,  then they should listen to what  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Lee Hsien Loong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  said  yesterday  about  the  measures  to  be  taken  to\r\n\r\nrestructure  and reform.  They would know that the Government\r\n\r\nhad put in a lot of thought.  The Government has also set  up\r\n\r\na  few  high-level  committees to  look  for  solutions,   in\r\n\r\nconsultation  with private and people sectors.  However,  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  we are facing are really very tough  ones.  These\r\n\r\nare  very  arduous and formidable challenges that  cannot  be\r\n\r\nsolved  by the Government alone.  Therefore, my parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues here have suggested that all of us, from  the  top\r\n\r\nto  the  bottom, must be united and strive for self reliance,\r\n\r\nso  that we will be able to cross this sea of roaring  waves.\r\n\r\nIf  we are not willing to help ourselves, then no matter what\r\n\r\nthe Government provides, in the end it will be of no avail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember a story about a man who was so lazy that the\r\n\r\nonly thing he was willing to do was to open his  mouth to  be\r\n\r\nfed  and  to hold out his hands to be dressed.  One day,  his\r\n\r\nwife  had to go back to her own village to visit her parents.\r\n\r\nBefore she left home, she made a big biscuit and tied it with\r\n\r\na  string around the neck of her husband.  She told the  lazy\r\n\r\nman,  \"If you are hungry, just open your mouth and   bite  on\r\n\r\nthe  biscuit.\"  A week later, she returned home to  find  her\r\n\r\nhusband  dead.  He had only managed to eat the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nbiscuit nearer to his mouth. He was too lazy even to use  his\r\n\r\nhands to reach for the part of the biscuit farther away  from\r\n\r\nhis  mouth. As a result, he died of starvation. So, if we  do\r\n\r\nnot help ourselves, whatever the Government does, it will  be\r\n\r\nquite useless in the end.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to continue with our success, we must change\r\n\r\nthis mentality of relying and depending on the Government  to\r\n\r\nsolve  all problems. The President's address devoted much  of\r\n\r\nits volume on the people factor.  We are reminded that if  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  succeed, we must struggle and fight.  In Singapore,\r\n\r\nopportunities are still abundant and everywhere.  So long  as\r\n\r\nwe are prepared to work hard, there will be achievements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that, in order to tackle these new challenges in\r\n\r\na new economic and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolitical situation, all of us in Singapore, from the top  to\r\n\r\nthe  bottom, should  make some adjustments to our mindset and\r\n\r\nmentality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues here have already made some suggestions.\r\n\r\nAllow me to  summarise these adjustments as three kinds of \"a\r\n\r\nbit   more\",  namely,  a  bit  more   courage,  a  bit   more\r\n\r\nmagnanimity and a bit more care and concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start with `a bit more courage'. This means that\r\n\r\nwe  must  dare to innovate, dare to lead.  We must decisively\r\n\r\nseize  opportunities that come along, and be  courageous  and\r\n\r\nresolute  in  whatever we do. Otherwise, you will  lose  your\r\n\r\nopportunity.  This is a big problem for Singapore, because we\r\n\r\nare blessed with a good natural environment. For example, our\r\n\r\ntemperature here is quite constant. The weather will  be  the\r\n\r\nsame  as  today,  and so will the day after.   There  are  no\r\n\r\nnatural disasters to worry about.  As a result, there may  be\r\n\r\na  sense  that  if we do not work today, we can  always  work\r\n\r\ntomorrow, and if not, we can always wait until the day  after\r\n\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not so elsewhere. In China, if you go to Huang\r\n\r\nShan  (the Yellow Mountain), today, you see the peak and  you\r\n\r\nmight  see  sunrise. But just a while later you may  not  see\r\n\r\nthem because they are covered by the fog and clouds.  So, the\r\n\r\nmoment  the fog is dispersed, you must immediately seize  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to take in the magnificent view,  otherwise  you\r\n\r\nmay  just  miss the most fantastic scenery you could  see  in\r\n\r\nyour life.  But, in Singapore, there is no thick fog. We  see\r\n\r\nthe  same  scenery day in and day out. Seizing an opportunity\r\n\r\nto  view  certain  scenic  spot does  not  seem  to  be  that\r\n\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also dare to venture, dare to adjust, dare to\r\n\r\nadvance  and dare to retreat. We must never be too swayed  by\r\n\r\nconsiderations of minor gain and loss, and hesitate over what\r\n\r\nmove  to make or shilly-shally.  We must remember that  paths\r\n\r\nare  made  by  men  walking over them.   If  we  want  to  go\r\n\r\nsomewhere and there is no access road, create your  own  way.\r\n\r\nSo, if we want to start a business, use the road\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat we have created for it. There is of course a cost to it,\r\n\r\nbut then this is what entrepreneurship  is all about. You can\r\n\r\nrecover  the cost by charging others who use the road started\r\n\r\nby you.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we must dare to express ourselves. We must also\r\n\r\ndare  to  take responsibility for what we say.   Whenever  we\r\n\r\ntell  our young professionals that  the Government is  asking\r\n\r\npeople to make suggestions and contribute ideas, their  first\r\n\r\nresponse  is  inevitably, \"Where are the  OB  markers?\"   Are\r\n\r\nthere  any  out-of-bound areas?  When we keep thinking  about\r\n\r\nthe  out-of-bound areas, then we might just as well  shut  up\r\n\r\nand do not talk. So in that way, we would not be able to have\r\n\r\na good exchange of ideas.  In my view and experience, so long\r\n\r\nas  we speak according to our conscience, in the interest  of\r\n\r\nthe  nation and our fellow citizens, it should not be  deemed\r\n\r\nto  be out-of-bound even if we hold views different from  the\r\n\r\ngovernment.   That  is my experience as a civil  servant  for\r\n\r\nmore than 20 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we must dare to face failure. We must remember\r\n\r\nthat  failure is the mother of success.  So when we  start  a\r\n\r\nbusiness,  we may make some mistakes and lose some money.  So\r\n\r\nlong as we learn from these we can treat the losses as though\r\n\r\nyou  are paying the tuition fees to learn.  So, when we  fall\r\n\r\ndown,  pick  yourself up, lift up your head  and  try  again.\r\n\r\nHongkongers are full of such adventurous spirit. So they have\r\n\r\na  proverb: `A great gentleman can bend and can be straight'.\r\n\r\nTo  them, there are only temporary set-backs but no permanent\r\n\r\nfailures.  Take one step backwards, and you get more space in\r\n\r\nfront  of you. So, taking a step backward today may mean  few\r\n\r\nsteps  forward  in the days to come. You can start  all  over\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also dare to learn new skills, to go into new\r\n\r\nindustries,  new ventures.  We must be able to turn  quickly.\r\n\r\nYou  must remember that heaven never seals off all the exits.\r\n\r\nEvery cloud has a silver lining.  There is always a way  out.\r\n\r\nOpportunities and success are out there waiting for you. .\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is not to be too agitated by noises or the comments\r\n\r\nfrom our neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must not be unduly troubled by what they say.  We must put\r\n\r\nthe  truth  in perspective.  We must remember that  important\r\n\r\nissues must be solved with reason and enlightenment.   So  if\r\n\r\nwe all have a little more courage and can do all these things\r\n\r\nthat  I  have  suggested,  then I think  we  will  have  more\r\n\r\nconfidence in ourselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we must have `a little bit more magnanimity'.\r\n\r\nWith a little bit more magnanimity, we shall be able to\r\n\r\naccept divergent views from other people.  This may be\r\n\r\ndifficult.  As it is often said that too many people generate\r\n\r\ntoo much noise, it becomes chaotic. But, remember, there is\r\n\r\nalso this saying that \"among three people walking together,\r\n\r\nthere will be one who is good enough to be my teacher\". In\r\n\r\nother words, there is always someone from whom we can learn\r\n\r\nsomething.  So we can talk, we can debate, we can discuss,\r\n\r\nand from all these we will all learn something from one\r\n\r\nanother. So long as we  are magnanimous, listen to and\r\n\r\nwilling to accept the views of others, then we will be able\r\n\r\nto find order in chaos.  Even in a chaotic state, we can\r\n\r\nlearn a lot of things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not judge a person by his success or failure\r\n\r\nalone.   We  should not reckon the person by the  clothes  he\r\n\r\nputs  on.  Today, we are successful, we wear branded  clothes\r\n\r\nand drive a luxury car. But, you cannot guarantee to have all\r\n\r\nthese luxuries forever.  Many of our fellow citizens argue in\r\n\r\nforum  page  that we must have broader yardsticks to  measure\r\n\r\nsuccess  or failure, and not by money alone.  And success  or\r\n\r\nfailure  is  not permanent.  Many of us like to sing.   There\r\n\r\nare  two  lines in a very popular song by the name  of  Gujue\r\n\r\nzhao  Jin  Chen (Ancient Moon Shining on Today's Dust)  which\r\n\r\nsays, \"Victory and defeat cannot last very long; rise or fall\r\n\r\nhappens  in  a  flash.\"   So  we are  successful  today,  but\r\n\r\ntomorrow we may fail.  So this is the turn of tide.  When you\r\n\r\nsee  somebody fails, do not say that he is finished,  because\r\n\r\ntomorrow  he  may  rise  up  again.   So  we  must  be   more\r\n\r\nmagnanimous in this sense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we must dare to accept talents from\r\n\r\nother places who can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontribute different styles and ideas, and who can supplement\r\n\r\nour shortcomings with their strong points. We must be able to\r\n\r\nleverage on their greater abilities to our benefit.   But  we\r\n\r\nnormally look only for their shortcomings, and say, \"Look, we\r\n\r\nare  better than they are.\"  But, few would recognise others'\r\n\r\nstrength  and  learn from them. If we can  learn  from  other\r\n\r\npeople's good points to strengthen ourselves so that we  will\r\n\r\nhave  a  good team and a strong community.  If there  are  10\r\n\r\npeople with the same ability, their combined strength is  one\r\n\r\nmultiplied  by 10.  But, if they have different capabilities,\r\n\r\nthen their combined strength is 10 multiplied by 10, and  you\r\n\r\nhave 100 - this is what we call \"synergy\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are magnanimous, we will be able to understand\r\n\r\nand  hence  tolerate  the  different cultures  and  different\r\n\r\nreligions.  We must realise that \"all roads lead to Rome\", we\r\n\r\ncould  reach  the  same  goal by different  means.   We  must\r\n\r\nmutually respect one another.  We must strengthen our  mutual\r\n\r\ntrust,  and  fortify the foundation of racial  and  religious\r\n\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also esteem the wisdom and strength of the\r\n\r\nmasses  and  the  community.   Although  not  everyone  in  a\r\n\r\ncommunity  has high education, he or she knows the  needs  of\r\n\r\nhis  or  her  own  community better.  We must encourage  each\r\n\r\ncommunity to resolve its own problems using its own ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans. We must not crave for a new Government ministry to  be\r\n\r\nset  up  just  whenever we are faced with a new problem,  and\r\n\r\nthen  complain that there is too much bureaucracy.   Once  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  new ministry, we must have new procedures.  Once  we\r\n\r\nhave procedures, we cannot escape having bureaucracy.  So  if\r\n\r\nwe  have  too  many Government ministries, we are encouraging\r\n\r\nmore  bureaucracy. Since we all dislike bureaucracy, we might\r\n\r\nas  well  go  and  solve our problems ourselves  rather  than\r\n\r\nasking  the  Government to set up more  ministries  and  then\r\n\r\ncomplain: \"Why is there so much bureaucracy?\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, is to have `a little more care and concern'. We\r\n\r\nmust remember that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew  economy is full of roaring waves, and people,  including\r\n\r\nourselves,  will  get tired or injured.  When  this  happens,\r\n\r\nwhere  do  we  go back to?  We should go back to our  family.\r\n\r\nBut  many  of  us  feel that our family  structure  has  been\r\n\r\nweakened.    When the young people are urged to set up  their\r\n\r\nfamilies,  they  say,  \"Where do we have  time?\"   These  are\r\n\r\nmatters  that we must consider seriously.  We must strengthen\r\n\r\nthe family fabric.  We must not forget that the family is the\r\n\r\nbasic building block of the society's foundation.  It is  our\r\n\r\nemotional  support and our focus of care.  The  family  is  a\r\n\r\nhaven  for  us  in  the towering waves of  the  oceans.   So,\r\n\r\nhowever  strong the ship may be, in the face of the  towering\r\n\r\nwaves in a storm, we must find a haven.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, more care means we must take care of the man-in-the-street, our little men, the ordinary citizens. The\r\n\r\ninspiration from our popular local song Xiao Ren  Wu  De  Xin\r\n\r\nSheng  (Voices from the Hearts of the Little People) and  the\r\n\r\nhot-selling local films,  Money No Enough and I Not Stupid is\r\n\r\nthat  we  should not forget the ordinary and less  successful\r\n\r\ncompatriots among us. We must remember that the prosperity of\r\n\r\nour nation and the opportunities that bring up the successful\r\n\r\nones  among us are actually created through the joint efforts\r\n\r\nof everyone, including the not so successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our society, about 90% of our people are ordinary men-in-the-street, and they contribute very greatly to our\r\n\r\nsociety.   We must not forget them.  We must not  forget  our\r\n\r\nroots.   We must also propound the fine traditions  of  self-help - that is, the more successful ones should help the less\r\n\r\nsuccessful  ones to catch up, and cope with   the development\r\n\r\nof the society and the nation.  In the traditional societies,\r\n\r\nthis  is very important.  The places that our ancestors  came\r\n\r\nfrom,  like  Indonesia,  China,  India,  have  this  kind  of\r\n\r\ntradition.   During the colonial days, the  colonial  masters\r\n\r\ndid not care much about the life or death of the people under\r\n\r\ntheir  rule. Yet, this spirit of self-help and self-reliance,\r\n\r\nenabled our society and the various communities to carry  on,\r\n\r\nto  survive and prosper. However, when the Government becomes\r\n\r\ntoo successful and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoo efficient, the people begin to look to the Government for\r\n\r\nhelp, and then this spirit of self-help and self-reliance  in\r\n\r\nthe  community  becomes weakened.  So I  feel  that  we  must\r\n\r\nrediscover  the communal self-help spirit and  tradition,  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  could have more care and concern among our  people.\r\n\r\nWhat  we want to see more is problems solved through the care\r\n\r\nand concern coming from within the community, and not some ad\r\n\r\nhoc  measures  dished out by the Government through the civil\r\n\r\nservants.   We  must  also  care  for  the  retrenched,   the\r\n\r\nunemployed  and the less fortunate people among  us,  because\r\n\r\nthey are also part of our community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when I was in Shanghai two weeks ago, I\r\n\r\nexchanged  views  with  a  Chinese unionist  on  helping  the\r\n\r\nunemployed and retrenched. He told me, \"In China, we  try  to\r\n\r\neducate  the community that a worker has been retrenched  not\r\n\r\nbecause  he  is not good enough, but because changes  in  the\r\n\r\nlabour  market  has caused his job to be lost.  So  this  can\r\n\r\nhappen  to  anyone, including you and I. Hence we should  not\r\n\r\nlook down on the retrenched and the unemployed. Tomorrow,  it\r\n\r\nmay  well  be  us.  So, we should help each other. Show  some\r\n\r\ncare  and concern for them, they will feel they have not been\r\n\r\nforgotten by society, and they will have the courage to start\r\n\r\nall over again.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we can learn from this attitude, and show a\r\n\r\nlittle  more care and concern for others.  We must  also  not\r\n\r\nforget our elders. As it is said in Chinese, \"Honour your own\r\n\r\nelders  and  extend it to other people's elders.   Love  your\r\n\r\nyoung  and extend the love to other people's young as  well.\"\r\n\r\nWhile it is good to look after my own family,  we should look\r\n\r\nbeyond that. We should transcend our family to look after and\r\n\r\ncare for other people, beyond our family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to promote volunteerism in our society. We must\r\n\r\nencourage more people to volunteer in social works.  We  must\r\n\r\nstrengthen  our  social heartware. A little more  courage,  a\r\n\r\nlittle more magnanimity and a little more care and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcern can go a long way in strengthening our social fabric.\r\n\r\nStart  from  a little here, a little there and build  up  our\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion.  Then,  we will  be  moving  in  the  right\r\n\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can find inspiration in the Presidential Address.\r\n\r\nMove  forward courageously, and get rid of our kiasu  (afraid\r\n\r\nto  lose)  and kiasi (afraid to die) mentality.  We  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  be  bold  and  courageous,  but  with  caution  and\r\n\r\nprudence.   Then  we can reach the state of baijia  zhengming\r\n\r\n(letting a hundred schools of thought contend).  We can  then\r\n\r\nlay  the strong foundation for our future development in  the\r\n\r\nnew  century.  Some 100 years ago, the founders of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncame  from  various  parts of Asia. On  the  basis  of  three\r\n\r\n\"little  bit more\": more courage, more magnanimity  and  more\r\n\r\ncare  and  concern for the people, they have  built  up  this\r\n\r\nmiracle  in the form of a prosperous Singapore. Let us  adopt\r\n\r\nthe  same kind of spirit to develop a better Singapore in the\r\n\r\nnew century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion of Thanks to the\r\n\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

They also understand the reasons, such as  merger\r\n\r\nand  acquisition,  company relocation or restructuring,  cost\r\n\r\ncuttings  or  poor business.  There are many  reasons  why  a\r\n\r\nperson can or cannot get a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njob  in the market.  Obviously there is no one solution  that\r\n\r\nwill  solve  all the problems through getting  jobs  for  the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is encouraging to note that we have tried to help to\r\n\r\nalleviate the unemployment problem by setting up a  Job  Task\r\n\r\nForce  and  a Career Centre providing job placement  and  job\r\n\r\ncounselling  service  under MOM.  NTUC also  spearheaded  the\r\n\r\nSkills Redevelopment Programme and set up a JobLink centre to\r\n\r\nhelp  fellow workers to find jobs and to provide the relevant\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must encourage our workers to continue to learn and\r\n\r\nupgrade  their  skills.  However, we must also realise  that,\r\n\r\nbesides  skills, there are other factors that  determine  the\r\n\r\nemployability of our workers.  We may not be able to  find  a\r\n\r\njob  even though you are highly skilled during the recession.\r\n\r\nIt  is true that there are workers who have managed to get  a\r\n\r\njob  after they have gone through some skills training.  But,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, there are also many of them who still cannot\r\n\r\nfind  jobs  even though they have obtained their  new  skills\r\n\r\ncertificate.  We need to find a better and more efficient way\r\n\r\nto match skills training that would bring more workers to the\r\n\r\nnew  jobs.  The most common question that the workers ask  is\r\n\r\n\"What  are the skills training courses that will most  likely\r\n\r\nland me with a job?\"  That is not an easy question to answer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many people have said that there are\r\n\r\n500,000 to 600,000 foreign workers in Singapore and there are\r\n\r\nabout  100,000 workers who are unemployed because our workers\r\n\r\nare  choosy  about their jobs and are unwilling  to  take  up\r\n\r\nthose  jobs  done  by the foreign workers.   Therefore,  many\r\n\r\nworkers  have  urged our workers to lower their expectations.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, this may be correct and there is some truth in\r\n\r\nthis  observation.  But according to what I know,  a  typical\r\n\r\nforeign worker from Thailand, India or China earns about $600\r\n\r\nto  $800 a month.  If the worker is from China and he  remits\r\n\r\n$500 back to his hometown, this would convert\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  about  RMB2,500.  In many parts of China, such a  sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney can really make a difference to the living standards of\r\n\r\nits  people.   This  is the same for workers  from  India  or\r\n\r\nThailand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such a salary, Mr Speaker, Sir, is far from enough\r\n\r\nfor  a  Singapore family who lives in a 3-room HDB flat  with\r\n\r\ntwo  children.   Some people have said that  the  minimum  is\r\n\r\n$1,200  to cover the HDB loans, conservancy charges,  utility\r\n\r\nbills, school fees and food.  How low can the expectations of\r\n\r\nour  workers  go?  It is easier said than done  when  we  ask\r\n\r\nother people to lower their expectations.  If you were in the\r\n\r\nshoes  of  these workers, can you maintain your  family  with\r\n\r\n$600?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the crux of the issue is that our workers need\r\n\r\nto  get a job that will pay them reasonably to support  their\r\n\r\nfamily.   There is an urgent need for MOM, NTUC and employers\r\n\r\nto  work  closely  to redesign certain low-end  jobs  through\r\n\r\nautomation and skills training.  This in turn will  help  the\r\n\r\nless educated workers to increase their productivity.  A good\r\n\r\nexample  would be the use of high-tech cleaning  machine  and\r\n\r\nthe   relevant  skills  training  provided  in  the  cleaning\r\n\r\nindustry.  These are the real help that many of our Singapore\r\n\r\nworkers need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to remake Singapore, I think we must\r\n\r\nalso  focus  on how we can develop new industries and  create\r\n\r\njobs for all levels of the workforce.  It is not practical to\r\n\r\nexpect  to  uplift  our  whole  workforce  to  become  highly\r\n\r\nskilled.   This is crucial to the heartlanders  because  they\r\n\r\nneed to make a living in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Dream cannot be a global dream where the\r\n\r\ntalented citizens seek their fortune in other countries.   We\r\n\r\nwill  pay  a heavy social, economic and political  price  for\r\n\r\nthat.   In fact, we need as many talented people as possible,\r\n\r\nbe  it  foreign  or local, to seek their Singapore  Dream  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and to compete in Singapore against the best in the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many people have expressed their\r\n\r\nconcern   over  the  well-being  of  the  small  and   medium\r\n\r\nenterprise, especially those in the retail sector.  Many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave also requested the Government to further reduce rentals,\r\n\r\ntaxes  and levies to alleviate their situation.  On the other\r\n\r\nhand,  we  notice  that  many  Singaporeans  still  do  their\r\n\r\nshopping  at  the mega shopping malls and petrol stations  in\r\n\r\nJohor  Baru.   This is fine during good times.   Besides  the\r\n\r\nfact  that goods in JB appear to be cheaper due to the  lower\r\n\r\nexchange  rate  for the Malaysian ringgit, it also  helps  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen close bilateral ties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Malaysia has intensified its effort to compete\r\n\r\nin  all  ways and means commercially with Singapore recently.\r\n\r\nWe have also noticed the media and the politicians there have\r\n\r\nthreatened  our water supply.  I feel that, as  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nit  is time that we should ask ourselves, if they continue to\r\n\r\ncriticise us unreasonably and threaten us, is it time that we\r\n\r\nshould  refrain from shopping in Johor Baru.  Why do we  have\r\n\r\nto  contribute to the well-being of the Johor Baru economy as\r\n\r\nMalaysia continues with its Singapore bashing?  I, therefore,\r\n\r\nurge Singaporeans to shop in Singapore with immediate effect.\r\n\r\nIf  we  do not support our own neighbourhood shops, it  would\r\n\r\nnot  help them much even if HDB provides free rental to these\r\n\r\nshops.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for Singaporeans to make a stand to support\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It is our nation we are talking about and  if  we\r\n\r\nare not vigilant, we may not be able to afford to shop in  JB\r\n\r\nanymore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first-generation leaders have fulfilled the dream of\r\n\r\nour  forefathers.   They have built a stable  and  prosperous\r\n\r\nenvironment  with  a proper shelter over the  head,  abundant\r\n\r\nfood and good education for the children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1990, when Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong took over the\r\n\r\ntorch  from the first-generation leaders, he said, \"Singapore\r\n\r\ncan  only do well if her good sons and daughters are prepared\r\n\r\nto dedicate themselves to help others.  I shall rally them to\r\n\r\nserve  the  country.  For if they do not come  forward,  what\r\n\r\nfuture  will we have?  I therefore call on my fellow citizens\r\n\r\nto join me to run the next lap together.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to say that Prime Minister Goh has not\r\n\r\ndisappointed  Singaporeans and neither  have  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  disappointed him.  The result of the last  general\r\n\r\nelection  is a show of recognition and trust that our  people\r\n\r\nhave given to our Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, in his Address to Parliament, has said,\r\n\r\n\"During  the  term  of this Parliament,  we  expect  to  make\r\n\r\nanother  political  transition.   The  nucleus  of  the  next\r\n\r\ngeneration of political leadership is already in place.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to sail in the open sea depends very\r\n\r\nmuch  on  the  steersman.  Our new steersman has demonstrated\r\n\r\nhis  astute  political  judgement and foresight  with  tested\r\n\r\ncapabilities.  His leadership charisma lies in his commitment\r\n\r\nto  Singapore  and  his resoluteness to  overcome  challenges\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is changing fast but the basics stay the same.\r\n\r\nWe must have the confidence in the new steersman and his many\r\n\r\nyoung  and  capable  sailors to bring  Singapore  to  greater\r\n\r\nheights.  Mr Speaker, Sir, no matter how rough the sea is  or\r\n\r\nhow  strong the undercurrents, even if we have to sail in the\r\n\r\ndark, we will see the dawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou  for  this opportunity to join in the debate.  I  support\r\n\r\nthis motion to thank the President for his Speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to speak after more than 60 of my fellow\r\n\r\nhon.  Members of the House, including some Members  from  the\r\n\r\nFrontbench,  have  had their say.  You had  yours.   So  many\r\n\r\nissues,  ideas  and suggestions were covered that  one  could\r\n\r\nliterally  say  that  no  stone was left  unturned.   Let  me\r\n\r\nquickly  add that I agree with and support most of what  were\r\n\r\nsaid.   Hence, whatever I now say will evoke a sense of  deja\r\n\r\nvu.   I  receive  friendly  hints that  my  chance  of  being\r\n\r\nappreciated  increases  the less  I  speak.   With  Professor\r\n\r\nChin's words \"somnolent\" and \"soporific\" ringing loudly in my\r\n\r\nears, I reckon that I would be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntempting  fate  to perform a rendition of issues,  ideas  and\r\n\r\nsuggestions  already repeated many times over to an  audience\r\n\r\nwho  had  sat stoically here listening to them for  the  last\r\n\r\nfive  days.   I intend to heed their advice but will  stretch\r\n\r\nthe edges.  Let me therefore reduce the odds by confining  my\r\n\r\nremarks to just one topic: quality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me quickly add a few words on our civil\r\n\r\nservice.    Although  DPM  Lee  had  spoken  on  the   matter\r\n\r\nyesterday,  I decided earlier to say this.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nadd my support to the call to our civil servants to implement\r\n\r\npolicies humanely, giving sympathetic consideration to  those\r\n\r\nwho  deserve  them.  However, I must add that in my  dealings\r\n\r\nwith the civil servants the last few years, I have found them\r\n\r\nto  be  humane and caring, but also cautious.  They  must  be\r\n\r\ncareful.  We expect them to be so.  But this should not  stop\r\n\r\nthem  from  being humane and caring.  I know they  can,  they\r\n\r\nhave, and should be more so in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I return now to the topic of quality. Here, I wish to\r\n\r\ndeclare  my interest in the topic.  I am the current Chairman\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore Quality Institute, which is an association\r\n\r\nfor quality professionals and promotes the quality discipline\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  Notwithstanding this responsibility, I want to\r\n\r\nstate  that I am plumbing for quality as I personally believe\r\n\r\nin its importance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practically everyone has touched on the topic of\r\n\r\ncompetition  in  the last few days.  Two  men,  chased  by  a\r\n\r\nhungry tiger on an open plain, quickly understand the meaning\r\n\r\nof  competitive  edge.   Just  outrun  the  other  chap.    A\r\n\r\ncompetitive edge is, thus, simply being able to do  something\r\n\r\nbetter  than  your  competitors.   And  the  longer  you  can\r\n\r\nmaintain this, the better the competitive edge.  Quality  can\r\n\r\nbe the basis of a competitive edge for Singapore.  Why does a\r\n\r\nperson  pay so much for a Mercedes Benz when he can  buy  the\r\n\r\nsame  capacity car of another make for much less?  The answer\r\n\r\nis  quality,  perceived or otherwise.  Dr  Ng  Eng  Hen  also\r\n\r\nreferred  to Starbucks' order-to-froth-time quality target  a\r\n\r\nfew days ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality is even more critical when it comes to service\r\n\r\nand,  in our economy of the future, the service component  is\r\n\r\nslated  to  become  even more important.   Mr  Ong  Kian  Min\r\n\r\neloquently elaborated on the service component yesterday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years ago, Hong Kong had a very poor reputation for\r\n\r\nservice.    Today,  this  image  has  changed.   What   about\r\n\r\nSingapore?   We  have a good reputation for product  quality.\r\n\r\nSingapore-made products are respected around the  world.   We\r\n\r\nmust thank SISIR, then PSB and now known as SPRING Singapore,\r\n\r\nfor  this happy state of affairs.  On the other hand, I think\r\n\r\nwe have room, lots of room, for improvement in quality in our\r\n\r\nservices sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share with you an example. I think Singaporeans\r\n\r\ndeserve  better  taxi  services.   While  many  taxi  drivers\r\n\r\nprovide  good service, many do not.  Sometime ago, travellers\r\n\r\narriving  at Changi Airport had wished that our taxi  drivers\r\n\r\ncould  be more helpful, such as helping them with their  bags\r\n\r\nand  luggage.   I  do  not know if the  situation  there  has\r\n\r\nimproved,  but I recently saw a lady stopping  a  taxi  along\r\n\r\nHolland  Road.  She was struggling to load her  luggage  bags\r\n\r\ninto the boot of the taxi.  Meanwhile, the taxi driver merely\r\n\r\nsat in his taxi, waiting for the work to be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example. A few days ago, I observed a passenger\r\n\r\npaying  the taxi driver for the journey.  The driver received\r\n\r\nthe  payment  and returned the change, all the while  with  a\r\n\r\nsullen expression tainted with annoyance and anger.  I  asked\r\n\r\nmyself, \"Why so?  Why was he not happy?  Did he not just  get\r\n\r\npaid?   Should he not show some degree of happiness,  if  not\r\n\r\ngratitude for the customer, then for himself, especially when\r\n\r\nwe  are  trying  to  survive the current  difficult  economic\r\n\r\ntimes.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about the taxi driver who drove away with the\r\n\r\nbelongings of his passengers?  The misdeeds of this one black\r\n\r\nsheep brought Singapore world-wide infamy.  In one stroke, as\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a result of his greed and misdeed, he tainted the good name\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Singapore, Singaporeans and his fellow taxi drivers. And\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if we remember that for many tourists and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noverseas visitors, the taxi drivers are some of the first and\r\n\r\nlast Singaporeans that they meet, their attitude and services\r\n\r\nprovided  by  our taxi drivers are, thus, not unimportant  to\r\n\r\nthe  image  of  Singapore around the world  and  our  tourist\r\n\r\nincome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another experience of poor quality service that we can\r\n\r\nshare  is  the  treatment  that we receive  in  some  of  the\r\n\r\nrestaurants,  shops and stores.  I am sure  each  of  us  has\r\n\r\nencountered  instances when there were  many  attendants  and\r\n\r\nserving  personnel but could not get one to  help  us.   They\r\n\r\nmight be looking in our direction but, miraculously, they did\r\n\r\nnot  see us, even when we stuck up our hands and waved.  When\r\n\r\nthis happened, we often swore to ourselves that we would  not\r\n\r\ngo  back to the shop again, ever.  And many customers do just\r\n\r\nthat.   You  can  put up lots of money into  advertising,  to\r\n\r\ndecorate up the place and to spruce up the ambience, but  the\r\n\r\npoor quality of service provided by the workers will kill the\r\n\r\nbusiness, sooner or later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have merely used the above examples to highlight the\r\n\r\nneed  for  Singaporeans  to adopt a  more  positive  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards  their work.  The taxi drivers and service  personnel\r\n\r\nin  restaurants and shops are not the only people who need to\r\n\r\nspruce their services, as each of us has encountered or heard\r\n\r\nof  experiences of poor quality service in many other  places\r\n\r\nand  trades.   Yesterday, Mr Ong Kian Min also described  his\r\n\r\nexperiences with some electrical contractors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If every worker in Singapore, citizens or otherwise,\r\n\r\ntakes pride in his or her work to produce the highest quality\r\n\r\nproduct or service, to perform his or her work with care  and\r\n\r\nattention to the best of his or her ability, this will result\r\n\r\nin  happy, appreciative and satisfied customers who will  buy\r\n\r\nthe  product and service, even if the prices may be a  little\r\n\r\nhigher, return for more and will probably sing praises of the\r\n\r\nestablishment to others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By now I do not blame you if you were beginning to ask\r\n\r\nwhy  is  it  that  if quality is that great, that  not  every\r\n\r\ncountry is pursuing it.  The truth is that though the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nidea  is  simple,  it is very hard to do.   Quality  concerns\r\n\r\nmindset  and  attitude.  A quality nation  is  one  in  which\r\n\r\nquality   is   endemic,  systemic  and  permeates  completely\r\n\r\nthroughout  the  country.  Converting  a  person  is  already\r\n\r\ndifficult, what more a nation?  But precisely because quality\r\n\r\nis  difficult to achieve, it also means that, once  you  have\r\n\r\ngot it, you get to keep it for a longer time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But does this mean that we have the luxury of time to\r\n\r\ndevelop a quality culture among Singaporeans?  Let me  answer\r\n\r\nthis  question  by  describing for you a  recent  experience.\r\n\r\nLast  month, a friend bought me a gift from a trip to  China.\r\n\r\nIt was a nice box of biscuits.  The box was fairly large, but\r\n\r\nthere were only 12 biscuits in it.  Each of the biscuits  was\r\n\r\nseparately packed with a small packet of drying agent to keep\r\n\r\nthe  biscuits crisp.  It was a quality product.  I  asked  my\r\n\r\nfriend  about  the biscuits.  The answers both impressed  and\r\n\r\nperturbed   me.    It  was  made  in  China.    So,   Chinese\r\n\r\nmanufacturers have obviously climbed the quality ladder in  a\r\n\r\nfew  short years.  What was even more disturbing was the fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  biscuits were not produced for export but consumed\r\n\r\nby  the  local  population.  This suggests that  the  Chinese\r\n\r\npeople have also changed and acquired a quality attitude.  My\r\n\r\nperception fits in with the Chinese experiences of  Mr  Ahmad\r\n\r\nMohd Magad, Mr Matthias Yao, Mr Inderjit Singh and others, as\r\n\r\nthey  had  described in their speeches during  the  last  few\r\n\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in such a short timeframe the Chinese are able not\r\n\r\nonly  to  acquire the capital, talent and technology but  are\r\n\r\nalso  able  to get their people to change their  mindset  and\r\n\r\nattitude   to  compete  effectively,  China  is  really   the\r\n\r\nformidable and fearsome competitor that it is made out to be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a nation, we started out with the emphasis on\r\n\r\nquality in the earlier years.  During the 1980s, we refocused\r\n\r\non productivity.  But in the last few years, we refocused yet\r\n\r\nagain and, this time, on innovation and creativity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to borrow Assoc. Prof. Chin's advocacy\r\n\r\nof  the  importance  of culture and arts itself  to  quality.\r\n\r\nQuality,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproductivity,  creativity and innovation are  all  important,\r\n\r\nbut  each  is  important  in its own  right.   We  have  been\r\n\r\nexploring the issue of cost-cutting.  Quality cuts cost in so\r\n\r\nmany  ways.  Workers, doing the right things and doing things\r\n\r\nright,  reduce  repairs  and  reworks.   Reliability  of  the\r\n\r\nproducts and services passes the savings to the parties  down\r\n\r\nthe  line  as  their  repairs and reworks are  also  reduced.\r\n\r\nSatisfied customers return and are retained, reducing further\r\n\r\npromotion costs, adding certainty to operation.  We can go on\r\n\r\nenumerating its virtues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should, thus, not take quality for granted. We\r\n\r\nshould  not  merely  subsume quality  under  productivity  or\r\n\r\ncreativity and innovation.  Not everyone can or needs  to  be\r\n\r\ninnovative  or creative all the time.  But everyone  can  and\r\n\r\nshould  deliver quality all the time.  We should see  quality\r\n\r\nas  important, to be developed and promoted in its own right.\r\n\r\nBy  developing a quality culture among Singaporeans, we  will\r\n\r\nadd  to  the  competitiveness of Singapore to whatever  other\r\n\r\ncompetitive edges that we may develop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.02 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  welcome the new MPs to this House.  I feel a deep sense of\r\n\r\nresponsibility towards them, because I had a hand in  getting\r\n\r\nthem here.  Some, like Khaw Boon Wan and Vivian Balakrishnan,\r\n\r\nI  had personally persuaded to leave the security and comfort\r\n\r\nof  their  job  to  take on this onerous  task  of  governing\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new MPs have crossed a major milestone in their\r\n\r\nlives.  An 'MPship' is not a career move or a feather in  the\r\n\r\ncap.  It is a commitment to serve the people and the country.\r\n\r\nThis you can do well, only if you feel for the people and the\r\n\r\ncountry,  and  are  prepared to think beyond  yourself,  your\r\n\r\nfamily and your friends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demands on your time and energy will be great, and\r\n\r\nthe expectations of your performance high, both in Parliament\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  constituency.   And you will probably  receive  more\r\n\r\ncriticisms than bouquets.  It is therefore not a job for  the\r\n\r\nthin-skinned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should seek to make a difference to Singapore. You\r\n\r\ncan  do this by looking after your constituents, helping them\r\n\r\nwhen  they  need  help,  and  forging  social  cohesion.   In\r\n\r\nParliament, speak thoughtfully and honestly, after  you  have\r\n\r\nreflected  on the issues and done some research and analysis.\r\n\r\nDo  not  just  offer feedback, useful though it is,  or  echo\r\n\r\ncriticisms  without  thought.   Offer  also  suggestions  for\r\n\r\nimproving  the lives of Singaporeans, and help to solve  both\r\n\r\nbig and small problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Expression of views by Party MPs</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tan Soo Khoon argued for the Whip to be lifted for all\r\n\r\nbackbenchers,  and for the Ministers to be allowed  to  speak\r\n\r\nfreely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not really need to explain the meaning of the Whip\r\n\r\nand the Cabinet system of collective leadership to the former\r\n\r\nSpeaker.   But as there are many new MPs here,  let  me  take\r\n\r\nsome time to explain.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Lifting of Whip</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party Whip is an appointment that can be found in\r\n\r\nmany  political  parties represented in all legislatures  all\r\n\r\nover  the  world,  particularly in countries  that  follow  a\r\n\r\nWestminster or British style of Parliamentary democracy, like\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duties of the party Whip vary from party to party,\r\n\r\nbut  primarily  they involve maintaining the  party's  voting\r\n\r\nstrength,   by   ensuring  that  members   attend   important\r\n\r\nParliamentary debates and support their party when a division\r\n\r\nis  called.  Simply put, the party Whip builds and  maintains\r\n\r\nparty discipline.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the interest of the people for political\r\n\r\nparties  to be disciplined.  In Parliamentary elections,  the\r\n\r\nparties  come first.  Candidates stand for election  under  a\r\n\r\nparty  logo,  unless  they are independent  candidates.   The\r\n\r\npeople want to be assured that the MPs they have voted for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nremain  faithful to the party platform they were elected  on.\r\n\r\nA  party  whose  members  are unable to  maintain  reasonable\r\n\r\nconsensus  on its policy positions will find it difficult  to\r\n\r\ninstill confidence in it, and get the support of, the voters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, lifting the Whip for most motions, as Tan\r\n\r\nSoo Khoon suggests, implies that we should completely let  go\r\n\r\nof  party discipline.  This goes against the grain of  party-based  Parliamentary democracy.  We will be lifting the  Whip\r\n\r\non  the  motion on Nominated Members of Parliament.  Already,\r\n\r\nwe  can see some MPs marshalling others for their cause.   Do\r\n\r\nwe want to see this for every issue?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how much leeway is given to MPs, and how to do it,\r\n\r\nare  the  prerogatives  of  the individual  political  party.\r\n\r\nDifferent  political  parties have different  comfort  levels\r\n\r\nwhen it comes to party discipline.  Some are less tolerant of\r\n\r\npublic  dissent amongst their members, others more  so.   But\r\n\r\nnone  will  agree that they can do away with party discipline\r\n\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, in the spirit of experimentation, we are\r\n\r\nwilling  to  provide more opportunities for the  Whip  to  be\r\n\r\nlifted.    Apart  from  lifting  the  Whip  for  matters   of\r\n\r\nconscience  and selected issues, PAP MPs may  request,  on  a\r\n\r\ncase-by-case basis, for the Whip to be lifted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we are introducing other measures to\r\n\r\nenhance  Parliamentary debates.  For example, a more flexible\r\n\r\ntimeframe will be adopted to allow sufficient time  for  MPs'\r\n\r\nviews  and inputs to be debated in Parliament, considered  by\r\n\r\nthe  relevant  Ministries, and incorporated  into  the  draft\r\n\r\nlegislation.    Also,   to  help  MPs  prepare   better   for\r\n\r\nParliamentary  debates,  we  will  give  them  more  research\r\n\r\nresources and staff support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our MPs today assume that the unity and cohesion of the\r\n\r\nPAP  will  stay  forever, when they ask for the  Whip  to  be\r\n\r\nlifted.  They are too sanguine about the future.  No one  can\r\n\r\ntell  what the state of the Party will be like in the future,\r\n\r\nor how some MPs will behave once they think that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinisters are beholden to them because they can vote  against\r\n\r\nthe Ministers freely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Collective ministerial responsibility</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soo Khoon also suggested that we should let Ministers\r\n\r\nstate their individual views freely before the final decision\r\n\r\nis taken on a subject.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is being done. Ministers are expected to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to the debate on a subject before a  decision  is\r\n\r\ntaken  on  the  matter.  Their inputs are given  in  Cabinet,\r\n\r\nbefore the matter comes to Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not let Ministers speak discordantly outside\r\n\r\nCabinet  because  of the principle of collective  ministerial\r\n\r\nresponsibility.   This  principle is another  cornerstone  of\r\n\r\nWestminster-style Parliamentary democracy.  It is,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nenshrined  in Article 24(2) of our Constitution.   There  are\r\n\r\ntwo reasons for this principle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, collective ministerial responsibility enhances\r\n\r\nthe accountability of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our Parliamentary democracy, whichever party has a\r\n\r\nmajority  in  Parliament will form the Government.   But  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  led  by  the  Prime  Minister  and  his  Cabinet\r\n\r\nMinisters, is not at liberty to do whatever it wishes.  It is\r\n\r\naccountable to Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of collective responsibility means that\r\n\r\nthere  is  an  agreement between the Prime Minister  and  his\r\n\r\nCabinet  colleagues that they will stand together as  a  team\r\n\r\nwhen accounting for their actions before Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions within Cabinet are therefore secret. Once a\r\n\r\ndecision  on  an issue or a policy has been reached,  Cabinet\r\n\r\nMinisters  will take the same public position.  It cannot  be\r\n\r\notherwise.   Imagine  for  a moment  that  the  principle  of\r\n\r\ncollective  responsibility  did  not  exist.   If  a  problem\r\n\r\noccurs,  it  is only too tempting for a Cabinet  Minister  to\r\n\r\nclaim,  \"I did not really agree with this policy, so I cannot\r\n\r\nbe   held   responsible.\"   This  principle   of   collective\r\n\r\nresponsibility is therefore to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nensure  that  all Cabinet Ministers are held  accountable  to\r\n\r\nParliament for the actions of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, collective ministerial responsibility enhances\r\n\r\ninter-ministry co-ordination.  Most of the important problems\r\n\r\nwe face as a nation are complex and cut across the portfolios\r\n\r\nof  individual  Ministers and Ministries.   The  Government's\r\n\r\npolicies  and initiatives must be evaluated in the  light  of\r\n\r\ntheir effects upon various aspects of our society.  They must\r\n\r\nbe carefully coordinated to avoid unnecessary duplication or,\r\n\r\nworse,  mutual contradiction.  It therefore makes good  sense\r\n\r\nfor Cabinet Ministers, and indeed, the entire Government,  to\r\n\r\nshare the same broad policy positions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if the views of Cabinet Ministers sound alike at\r\n\r\ntimes,  we  should  be comforted that they  are  united.   We\r\n\r\nshould,  in fact, worry if they begin to sound very different\r\n\r\nfrom each other on the same subject, for this would suggest a\r\n\r\ndivided Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Severe challenges ahead</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last few days, MPs and the new\r\n\r\nMOSs  have  dwelt on many serious challenges  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  have  to confront in the coming years.   Listening  to\r\n\r\nthem,  I  am not sure that they realise the full gravity  and\r\n\r\nenormity of these challenges.  The challenges they face  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  be  much tougher than those I faced when  I  first\r\n\r\nbecame  an  MP  in  1976.  The issues  today  are  much  more\r\n\r\ncomplex, and also more threatening.  They will put our  young\r\n\r\nMPs and Ministers severely to the test.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eighties through the early nineties, we had the\r\n\r\nbenefit   of  a  benign  regional  environment.   ASEAN   was\r\n\r\ncohesive.   Its economies were booming.  There was  political\r\n\r\nand  social stability in our region.  Indonesia was  growing,\r\n\r\nand  under  Suharto, well-disposed towards  us.   The  global\r\n\r\neconomy also expanded rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there were several crises - Vietnam's invasion of\r\n\r\nCambodia in 1979, and the downturn in the global economy that\r\n\r\ncontributed  to  our 1985 recession.  But on the  whole,  the\r\n\r\nexternal  environment was favourable.   This  allowed  us  to\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on economic development.  We attracted  MNCs  to\r\n\r\ninvest  here.   We upgraded the economy from labour-intensive\r\n\r\nindustries to higher value-added activities.  Later, we built\r\n\r\nan  external  wing to our economy.  We rode on  the  region's\r\n\r\nrapid growth.  We went to China, India and many other places.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1997 Asian financial crisis brought that happy state\r\n\r\nof  affairs to an end.  The crisis did not pull down only the\r\n\r\neconomy  of  the  regional countries.  It  also  changed  the\r\n\r\npolitical  environment of some countries.  Even  today,  four\r\n\r\nyears   later,  the  political  situation  in   our   largest\r\n\r\nneighbour, Indonesia, has not fully settled into a new  state\r\n\r\nof equilibrium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in addition to having to restructure our economy, we\r\n\r\nnow  have to deal with a more volatile and less accommodating\r\n\r\npolitical environment in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more serious is the security problem we now face - the threat from terrorism and Islamic militancy in the\r\n\r\nregion.   September  11  and  the  Jemaah  Islamiyah  arrests\r\n\r\nexposed   this  grave  and  immediate  threat  to  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSingapore was very nearly blown up.  Four tonnes of  ammonium\r\n\r\nnitrate, 1.2 tonnes of TNT, and fuses for the explosives, had\r\n\r\nalready  been  acquired.   The terrorists  were  looking  for\r\n\r\nanother  17 more tonnes of ammonium nitrate and seven  trucks\r\n\r\nand  they are going to pack the 21 tonnes of ammonium nitrate\r\n\r\ninto  the  seven  trucks and about the same time,  drive  all\r\n\r\nthese  seven trucks at seven different targets to  blow  them\r\n\r\nup.  Can you imagine the devastation this would have cost  to\r\n\r\nSingapore and the aftermath?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPs, understandably, concentrated on bread-and-butter\r\n\r\nissues,   because  these  are  what  your  constituents   are\r\n\r\nconcerned with.  But you will also have to inform them of the\r\n\r\nlarger picture against which the bread-and butter issues will\r\n\r\nhave to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsolved.   So  let  me  now elaborate  on  some  of  the  more\r\n\r\nintractable  larger-picture problems which we will  be  faced\r\n\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang Kai Yuen commented that the Government tended to\r\n\r\nunderstate good news and overstate bleak scenarios.  It is in\r\n\r\nthe  nature  of  this Government to plan  on  the  worst-case\r\n\r\nscenario.  Then, if things do not turn out as bad as  we  had\r\n\r\nprovided  for, we can all sigh with relief.  But if  they  do\r\n\r\nturn real bad, then we would have been prepared with possible\r\n\r\nresponses.  This characteristic of the Government has enabled\r\n\r\nSingapore to survive many crises.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Islamic militancy</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Halimah Yacob said that Malay-Muslims in Singapore had\r\n\r\nturned  to religion to counter the threat that their  culture\r\n\r\nand values might be eroded in the face of the global cultural\r\n\r\nonslaught.   She added that becoming more religious  did  not\r\n\r\nmean  that  Malay  Singaporeans were  choosing  to  disengage\r\n\r\nthemselves from society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand her position. But if this was the only\r\n\r\nreason  for  Malay-Muslims in Singapore to turn to  religion,\r\n\r\nand  Halimah is right about Muslims not disengaging from  the\r\n\r\nother  communities, then I would not worry about  the  trend.\r\n\r\nThere is really nothing wrong with Singaporeans wanting to be\r\n\r\nmore  religious,  so long as they regard  their  religion  as\r\n\r\nsomething personal between themselves and their God, and they\r\n\r\ninteract freely with people of other races and religions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increased religiosity of our Muslims is part of the\r\n\r\nglobal Islamic wave that emanated from the Middle East  after\r\n\r\nthe  1973  oil crisis, when the countries there were  flushed\r\n\r\nwith cash,  and the 1979 Iranian Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met the Prime Minister of Mauritius last month when he\r\n\r\nstopped  over  in Singapore on his way to Australia  for  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  Heads of Government Meeting.  He told  me  that\r\n\r\nthe  Muslims in his country had become more conservative, and\r\n\r\nthat  many  Muslim  women had taken to  wearing  headscarves.\r\n\r\nMauritius is far away from the Middle East and some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndistance  from  Africa, and yet in that island country,  they\r\n\r\ntoo  have  been affected by this wave of Islamic  resurgence.\r\n\r\nHe lamented that their Muslims were not mixing as freely with\r\n\r\nthe  non-Muslims as they did in the seventies.  In Mauritius,\r\n\r\n52% of the population are Hindus, and 17% Muslims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same Commonwealth meeting, the Foreign Minister\r\n\r\nof  Sierra Leone told me that the same thing was happening to\r\n\r\nhis   country's   Muslims.   They  have  also   become   more\r\n\r\nconservative.  60% of Sierra Leone's population are Muslims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, other Muslim societies which have\r\n\r\nnot  gone  down the path of conservatism.  I met  a  Moroccan\r\n\r\nMinister on Wednesday.  He was surprised that so many  Muslim\r\n\r\nwomen in Malaysia and Singapore wear the tudung.  He told  me\r\n\r\nthat  the  women  in his country did not wear  the  religious\r\n\r\nheadscarf.   He invited me to visit his country  to  see  how\r\n\r\nMoroccan  Muslims  practise  their  faith.   He  added   that\r\n\r\nTunisia,  another Muslim country, is even more liberal,  but,\r\n\r\nno, not Algeria.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singaporeans who are more religious remain engaged\r\n\r\nwith mainstream secular society, there is no problem.  But if\r\n\r\nthey opt out, this could fracture our social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am even more concerned about, however, is\r\n\r\nreligious activism and extremism, or people using religion to\r\n\r\nadvance  their  own agenda.  Take Ibrahim Maidin,  the  local\r\n\r\nJemaah  Islamiyah leader, as an example.  He taught Halimah's\r\n\r\nchildren  religious  studies.  He wrote to  Halimah  when  he\r\n\r\nheard that she was standing for election.  He urged her  that\r\n\r\nas  a Muslim, she should not do so.  He argued that as an  MP\r\n\r\nin  a  secular political party, she might be associated  with\r\n\r\nlaws  and  policies  which were not in  accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nSyariah.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It spoke well of Halimah that she did not listen to him.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, she would not be here today, and would not be able\r\n\r\nto contribute to her community as well as to Singapore.  This\r\n\r\nwould have been a loss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nboth to the Muslim and non-Muslim communities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Malay leader told me a similar story of\r\n\r\nextremism.  A religious teacher had advised his students  not\r\n\r\nto mix with non-Muslims as they were non-believers.  When one\r\n\r\nof the students told her parents of this, they pulled her out\r\n\r\nof  the class immediately.  But what about the other students\r\n\r\nremaining  in  the  class?  Should it not  be  the  religious\r\n\r\nteacher  who  should be pulled out of the class instead?   At\r\n\r\nthe  very  least, he should be advised to refrain  from  such\r\n\r\nteachings.  Such extremism is a cause for concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extremism comes at the expense of inter-racial and inter-religious interaction. It excludes rather than includes. It\r\n\r\nresults  in the withdrawal of the practitioner into  his  own\r\n\r\ncommunal  cocoon, and in the rejection of others who  do  not\r\n\r\nshare  his beliefs.  When that happens, the other communities\r\n\r\nwill  not  only keep their distance, but will also press  for\r\n\r\nmore  space  of  their  own.  This can break  up  our  social\r\n\r\nstructure and social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extremism is even more dangerous when the extremists\r\n\r\ncampaign  and compel others to follow their view in the  name\r\n\r\nof  religion.  Zainul Abidin Rasheed should be supported when\r\n\r\nhe  asked  moderate  Muslims to stand up against  extremists.\r\n\r\nModerate Muslims should not allow the extremists to  set  the\r\n\r\nagenda for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only us who are concerned about the rise of\r\n\r\nIslamic  extremism.  Earlier this year, leaders  of  the  two\r\n\r\nlargest  Muslim organisations in Indonesia met in Jakarta  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  the problems facing the country.  After the meeting,\r\n\r\nthe  Nahdlatul Ulama chairman, Hasyim Muzadi,  told  a  press\r\n\r\nconference  that the image of Islam had been  politicised  by\r\n\r\ncertain groups for their vested interests.  He stressed  that\r\n\r\nsuch  radicalism  was not the Islamic way of  thinking.   His\r\n\r\ncounterpart in Muhammadiyah, Syafii Maarif, said that if  the\r\n\r\nauthorities  were afraid to take stern measures  against  the\r\n\r\nradicals, that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould pave the way for the birth of another Taliban nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malaysia too, moderate Muslims - \"the silent\r\n\r\nmajority\" - are being urged to speak up, to balance extremist\r\n\r\nviews  on  Islam.  The Executive Director of Sisters-in-Islam\r\n\r\nrecently called on middle-class Malaysian Muslims, especially\r\n\r\nthose who had  been quiet so far, to voice out their moderate\r\n\r\nviews,  instead  of allowing the radicals and  extremists  to\r\n\r\ndominate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My worry is that some extremist groups will exploit the\r\n\r\ngrowing Islamic consciousness in Singapore and in the region,\r\n\r\nto  advance  their religious or political objectives  through\r\n\r\nradical means, some of which can be violent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kumpulan Mujahideen Malaysia is a radical group. It\r\n\r\nenvisages the creation of a Daulah Islamiyah Nusantara, a pan-regional  Islamic state, comprising Malaysia,  Indonesia  and\r\n\r\nsouthern Philippines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian-led Jemaah Islamiyah group has added\r\n\r\nanother   country  or  part  of  it,  Thailand,  to  Kumpulan\r\n\r\nMujahideen  Malaysia's pan-regional Islamic  state.   It  has\r\n\r\ntalked  about  forming an Islamic state  comprising  southern\r\n\r\nThailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and southern Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ibrahim Maidin, the Singapore leader of Jemaah\r\n\r\nIslamiyah,  went one step further.  He told  an  ISD  officer\r\n\r\nthat  he  was  convinced  that  sooner  or  later,  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nIndonesia, and Mindanao in the Philippines, would come  under\r\n\r\nSyariah law and become a Daulah Islamiyah, or Islamic  state.\r\n\r\nHe   continued  that  when  that  happened,  Singapore  would\r\n\r\ninevitably also become Islamic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other militant groups in the region have objectives\r\n\r\nwhich  are  more  national in nature, but they  are  no  less\r\n\r\nworrisome.  Malaysia's Al-Ma'unah wants to set up an  Islamic\r\n\r\nstate  in  Malaysia.  Laskar Jihad and the Islamic  Defenders\r\n\r\nFront want an Islamic state in Indonesia.  Abu Sayyaf and the\r\n\r\nMoro  Islamic  Liberation Front want to form  an  independent\r\n\r\nMuslim state in the Muslim enclave of Mindanao in southern\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilippines,  while  Barisan Revolusi  Nasional  and  Gerakan\r\n\r\nMujahiddin Islam Pattani want to do so in southern Thailand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these militant groups have objectives that are\r\n\r\ndomestically  driven, some of them already  have  operational\r\n\r\nlinks  with  one  another  as well  as  with  Al-Qaeda.   For\r\n\r\nexample, both Kumpulan Mujahideen Malaysia and the Indonesian\r\n\r\nMujahidin Council subscribe to the goal of uniting the global\r\n\r\nIslamic community, which is what Al-Qaeda advocates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not bogeyman tales to frighten children. Nor\r\n\r\nhave  we  exaggerated the extent of the  problem.   There  is\r\n\r\noverwhelming evidence to suggest that the militant groups  in\r\n\r\nour region have extensive and well-developed networks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Jemaah Islamiyah is part of a much larger\r\n\r\nregional terrorist network spanning Indonesia, Malaysia,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Philippines.   Singapore Jemaah Islamiyah  members  have\r\n\r\nidentified  Abu Bakar Baasyir and Abu Jibril as  among  those\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the  establishment  and  operation  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Jemaah Islamiyah.  Abu Jibril has been  implicated\r\n\r\nin  crimes  committed  by the Kumpulan  Mujahideen  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nwhile  Abu  Bakar  Baasyir and another  Indonesian  Mujahidin\r\n\r\nCouncil  leader, Hambali, are said to be behind the  movement\r\n\r\nto  establish an Islamic state comprising Indonesia, Malaysia\r\n\r\nand southern Philippines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six of the 13 Jemaah Islamiyah members being held in\r\n\r\nSingapore  had links with the Moro Islamic Liberation  Front,\r\n\r\nwhile the two who were arrested and then released had visited\r\n\r\nMoro Islamic Liberation Front camps in the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jemaah Islamiyah may also have Thai connections. In\r\n\r\nJanuary  this year, a Singaporean Jemaah Islamiyah  fugitive,\r\n\r\nwho is still on the run, Mas Selamat Kastari, and four others\r\n\r\nwere  believed  to  have  fled  to  Thailand.   Kastari   was\r\n\r\nsuspected   to  be  planning  to  hijack  an  aircraft   from\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  Malaysia or Thailand, and crash  it  into  Changi\r\n\r\nAirport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see, it is not just Al-Qaeda we are concerned\r\n\r\nwith.   It is Islamic radicalism and militancy in our region.\r\n\r\nThe  Al-Qaeda terrorists are primarily against the Americans.\r\n\r\nTheir  targets  are  Americans.  The radical  groups  in  our\r\n\r\nregion  have  a  different regional  agenda.   The  two  have\r\n\r\ncombined forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Relations with Malaysia</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several MPs have spoken on our relations with Malaysia.\r\n\r\nYeo   Guat  Kwang  said  that  one  union  leader  could  not\r\n\r\nunderstand why the Malaysians were so angry with Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent months, hardly a week went by without the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  media playing up one bilateral issue  or  another:\r\n\r\nwater,  `tudung', land reclamation, and even Vivian's playful\r\n\r\nremark  about \"wild animals\".  Now it is Ravindran's turn  to\r\n\r\nfall victim.  Tomorrow will be Ong Ah Heng's.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked some young Singaporeans what they thought of all\r\n\r\nthese  attacks on Singapore.  They said that they were immune\r\n\r\nto  them.   In  other  words, there  is  no  effect  on  them\r\n\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unfortunately, when the Malaysian media carries\r\n\r\nfactually  incorrect  or one-sided reports,  or  inflammatory\r\n\r\ncomments, they also stoke the flames of the Malaysian people.\r\n\r\nThey  sour  relations at the people level.  Guat  Kwang  said\r\n\r\nthat his union leader friend was worried about travelling  to\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  I know of others who had cancelled their plans  to\r\n\r\nspend the recent school holidays in Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Land Reclamation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take land reclamation as an example of flame-stoking.\r\n\r\nThere  have  been so many allegations on so many fronts,  and\r\n\r\nalso  many  inconsistencies and inaccuracies in  their  media\r\n\r\nreports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to delve into detail on this issue, as Mah\r\n\r\nBow Tan has already done so.  But I do wish to point out that\r\n\r\nour  land reclamation policy is not new or secret.  Singapore\r\n\r\nis a small country.  We reclaim land because we need land and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  no other reason.  We have been doing so since the 1960s.\r\n\r\nIn  1991,  a  set of comprehensive land-use plans,  including\r\n\r\nthose  pertaining to long-term reclamation, was  approved  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government  and  put on public  record.   This  was  the\r\n\r\nConcept  Plan  of 1991, which was recently reviewed,  updated\r\n\r\nand  re-issued  as  Concept Plan 2001.  This  is  a  publicly\r\n\r\navailable document.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do take Malaysia's concerns seriously. This is why\r\n\r\nDPM  Lee  Hsien Loong told the Malaysian leaders  during  his\r\n\r\nvisit  to  KL,  that  if  Malaysia  had  concerns  about  our\r\n\r\nreclamation  works,  it could put them down  in  a  note  and\r\n\r\nSingapore would study them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Water</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water is another complicated issue between our two\r\n\r\ncountries.  In fact, it has been a constant source of tension\r\n\r\nsince our independence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture that has been recently painted in the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  media  is  one of an arrogant,  selfish  Singapore\r\n\r\nprofiteering from our purchase of raw water from  Johor.   As\r\n\r\nin  the  land  reclamation issue, this picture is  skewed  to\r\n\r\narouse feelings and resentment against Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example. We have been accused by a\r\n\r\nMalaysian  newspaper  of  raking in  huge  profits  of  RM600\r\n\r\nmillion annually, by selling the water we get from Johor at 3\r\n\r\nsen per thousand gallons, to ships which call at Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water sold to ships calling at our ports does attract\r\n\r\nhigh  tariffs,  but this is only because we do  not  want  to\r\n\r\nencourage this kind of demand.  We sell only a small quantity\r\n\r\nof  water to ships, about 1 million gallons per day, which is\r\n\r\nless  than 1% of Singapore's total water demand.  The revenue\r\n\r\nSingapore  gets  from this sale, I wish, was near  the  RM600\r\n\r\nmillion figure, but it is not.  Last year, Singapore's  gross\r\n\r\nrevenue  from our sale of water to ships totalled about  RM40\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key unhappiness, however, is in the current price of\r\n\r\n3 sen that we are paying for raw water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the deal on the bilateral package, which we\r\n\r\nare  still negotiating, we had offered to increase this 3 sen\r\n\r\nfor  raw water that was agreed between Singapore and Malaysia\r\n\r\nin  the 1961 and 1962 Water Agreements.  In addition, we  had\r\n\r\nbeen  prepared  to  vary  the Points of  Agreement  (POA)  on\r\n\r\nMalayan Railway Land, and offer Malaysia additional plots  of\r\n\r\nland for joint development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these concessions that Singapore had offered under\r\n\r\nthe  bilateral  package  must  be  taken  into  account  when\r\n\r\nconsidering the price Singapore is willing to pay  for  water\r\n\r\nunder a new agreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for Singapore, this issue goes beyond money. The\r\n\r\n1961  and  1962 Water Agreements are international  treaties,\r\n\r\nlegally   binding  on  Singapore  and  Malaysia.   They   are\r\n\r\nguaranteed   by  both  governments  in  the  1965  Separation\r\n\r\nAgreement and cannot be varied except as provided for  within\r\n\r\nthe  Agreements, or by mutual consent.  But we were  prepared\r\n\r\nto consider an increase in the price of existing water within\r\n\r\nthe  bilateral package and as a gesture of goodwill  to  help\r\n\r\nconclude a deal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring up this point because at the height of the\r\n\r\nfurore  over  water, certain comments by the Malaysian  media\r\n\r\ntroubled  us.   They seemed to suggest that  Malaysia  should\r\n\r\nunilaterally   amend   the  terms  of  the   existing   Water\r\n\r\nAgreements, if resolution could not be reached on a new price\r\n\r\nfor  existing  water.   For  example,  a  New  Straits  Times\r\n\r\neditorial of 30th January commented:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"By (Singapore) suggesting that these (water) agreements\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  apply  by  default  because  the  Johor   state\r\n\r\ngovernment  failed to re-negotiate the price structure  after\r\n\r\n25 years in 1986 and 1987, it is simply playing hard to get.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same editorial suggested that the issue of water be\r\n\r\nviewed as a business transaction - agree to a price, seal the\r\n\r\ndeal,  or  part with no hard feelings and look elsewhere  for\r\n\r\nwater.  In other words, if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  does not agree to Malaysia's price for  water,  we\r\n\r\nwould have to look elsewhere for water because Malaysia would\r\n\r\nstop its supply to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not so simple. Both sides can walk away from\r\n\r\nthe  negotiations on a new water agreement if we cannot reach\r\n\r\nan  agreement.   However,  both  sides  have  to  honour  the\r\n\r\nexisting  1961  and 1962 Water Agreements.   As  I  mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier,  these two agreements were confirmed and  guaranteed\r\n\r\nby  both  governments in the 1965 Separation Agreement,  also\r\n\r\nknown as the Independence of Singapore Agreement.  Any breach\r\n\r\nof  the  Water  Agreements would also call into question  the\r\n\r\nSeparation Agreement, and undermine our very existence.  This\r\n\r\nis totally unacceptable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is high time we explored a different approach\r\n\r\nto  water  supply from Malaysia.  I do not want our relations\r\n\r\nwith Malaysia to be always strained by this issue.  It is not\r\n\r\nhealthy for our two countries to be always locked in dispute.\r\n\r\nIt  is  unwise  to  allow this one issue  to  sour  bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations  at all levels and on all fronts.  It  prevents  us\r\n\r\nfrom co-operating in strategic areas of mutual benefit.   The\r\n\r\nlong-term  interests  of our two countries  might  be  better\r\n\r\nserved  if we can remove this constant thorn in our bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sensitivity of this water issue goes back to the\r\n\r\nSeparation.   On  9th  August  1965,  the  very  day  of  our\r\n\r\nindependence,  Tunku  Abdul  Rahman  told  the  British  High\r\n\r\nCommissioner in Malaya:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If Singapore's foreign policy is prejudicial to\r\n\r\nMalaysia's interests, we could always bring pressure to  bear\r\n\r\non them by threatening to turn off the water in Johor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time has not changed this perception that water is to be\r\n\r\nused as a leverage against Singapore.  In an article entitled\r\n\r\n\"Water  as a Factor in International Relations\" published  in\r\n\r\nthe  November  2000  issue  of Strategi,  a  journal  of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia Armed Forces College, a Lt-Col Azmy Yahya wrote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Malaysia should take full advantage of water as a\r\n\r\nstrategic  weapon  to counter Singapore's military  advantage\r\n\r\nover Malaysia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noting that \"without water, Singapore may not survive\",\r\n\r\nAzmy  said  that apart from the ability to disrupt the  water\r\n\r\nsupply  to  Singapore, Malaysia also had  the  capability  to\r\n\r\npollute   the  supply  with  either  chemical  or  biological\r\n\r\nweapons.   He  argued that Malaysia had the right  to  defend\r\n\r\nitself through all means.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, though, there are others with a more\r\n\r\nrealistic  sense of the situation.  Lt-Gen Zaini  Mohd  Said,\r\n\r\nthe former Malaysian Army Field Commander, wrote a commentary\r\n\r\nin   Mingguan  Malaysia  just  two  months  ago  when   media\r\n\r\ncriticisms  against  us on water were at  their  zenith.   He\r\n\r\npointed  out that water was a security issue that could  lead\r\n\r\nto armed conflict.  He reminded Malaysians that the Singapore\r\n\r\nmilitary  was stronger and more sophisticated.  And  although\r\n\r\nMalaysia  had  its own means of responding,  Zaini  concluded\r\n\r\nthat both sides would be losers if it came to armed conflict.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not healthy to always have a Damocles' sword\r\n\r\nhanging  over  our heads.  It breeds mistrust and  suspicion,\r\n\r\nand  does not make for a productive relationship.  It may  be\r\n\r\nbetter  for bilateral relations if we start to move a  little\r\n\r\naway from our reliance on Malaysia for water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is doable if we have to do it. We have already\r\n\r\ncalled a tender for a 30mgd desalination plant.  We have been\r\n\r\noperating a plant to produce NEWater (reclaimed water)  using\r\n\r\nmembrane  technology for two years now.   And  we  intend  to\r\n\r\nbuild   more  such  NEWater  plants.   The  cost   of   these\r\n\r\nalternative  sources  of water is not  all  that  prohibitive\r\n\r\neither.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to have good, stable relations with Malaysia for\r\n\r\nthe long term and for mutual benefit.  We shall play our part\r\n\r\nto achieve this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia has written to us with their latest proposal on\r\n\r\nthe bilateral package.  We shall send them our reply, stating\r\n\r\nour position, some time next week.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do not want to leave Singaporeans with the\r\n\r\nimpression  that  if  we  remove this  issue  of  water  from\r\n\r\nbilateral relations, or if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  manage to wrap up the bilateral package, then there  will\r\n\r\nbe  no  more disputes between Singapore and Malaysia forever.\r\n\r\nThere will always be the occasional squabble, because we  are\r\n\r\ngeographically  close.  Even more so, given  our  shared  and\r\n\r\nbroken history together,\r\n\r\nand the different ways in which our societies are organised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Co-operation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must therefore view the inevitable ups and\r\n\r\ndowns  in our relationship with Malaysia with a certain  calm\r\n\r\nand  balance.   We should not be complacent  when  things  go\r\n\r\nwell.   Neither should we get excited when things turn  sour.\r\n\r\nWe  need  patience, stamina and a long-term  view.   We  will\r\n\r\nstand  firm on fundamentals, but must be broad-minded  enough\r\n\r\nto  accommodate Malaysia's interests where our  own  national\r\n\r\ninterests are not diminished.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not give up the prospect of achieving a win-win\r\n\r\nrelationship  with Malaysia.  We can and we  must  co-operate\r\n\r\nwith each other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our two economies are strongly inter-dependent.\r\n\r\nMalaysia  was Singapore's top trading partner last year.   We\r\n\r\nwere  Malaysia's second largest export destination and  third\r\n\r\nlargest import source.  Singapore was also Malaysia's  fourth\r\n\r\nlargest  foreign investor in terms of total value of approved\r\n\r\nprojects.   So, co-operation would bring us greater  benefit,\r\n\r\ncertainly more than being at each other's throat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that there would be no competition\r\n\r\nbetween us.  Rivalry between our two countries will always be\r\n\r\nstrong.  In some instances, we will be fighting for the  same\r\n\r\npiece of cake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But generally, I believe that the economic pie is\r\n\r\ngrowing and is big enough for the two of us.  Neither country\r\n\r\nwould   do  well  without  the  other.   It  is  a  symbiotic\r\n\r\nrelationship which we have not fully exploited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The late President Yusof Ishak told the inaugural\r\n\r\nsession of our Parliament on 8th December 1965:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Our survival as a people, distinct and separate from\r\n\r\nour  neighbours in Southeast Asia, depends upon our  patience\r\n\r\nand  resolution in dealing with physically bigger  and  hence\r\n\r\ndifficult  neighbours, and upon our perseverance  in  seeking\r\n\r\nlong-term  solutions of finding a new balance  of  forces  in\r\n\r\nthis part of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still good advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Declining Fertility</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indranee Rajah said that the Government needed to look\r\n\r\ninto  the  problem of housing for singles.  I would say  that\r\n\r\nthe  more pressing challenge that we have to look into is the\r\n\r\nrising  number  of singles.  Since we first  highlighted  the\r\n\r\nproblem some years back, it has become more acute.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singlehood rate for resident males aged 40-44 rose\r\n\r\nfrom  11.6 per hundred in 1995, to 15.0 per hundred in  2001.\r\n\r\nThat  is for males.  The singlehood rate for resident females\r\n\r\nin  the  same  age group increased from 12.5 per hundred,  to\r\n\r\n14.0  per hundred.  For males, most of the singles were those\r\n\r\nwith  secondary and below education, whereas graduate females\r\n\r\ncontinued to be the biggest \"single\" group across all ages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This inability or unwillingness on the part of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to get hitched, is seriously contributing to our\r\n\r\nfalling  fertility problem.  So two years ago, the Government\r\n\r\nput  in place a package of marriage and procreation measures.\r\n\r\nWe  introduced  the Baby Bonus, Third Child Maternity  Leave,\r\n\r\nmore  and  better  childcare  centres,  family-friendly  work\r\n\r\npractices, easier home ownership, public education  and  more\r\n\r\nopportunities for singles to socialise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more than nine months after we started giving out\r\n\r\nthe  Baby  Bonus in April last year, I have not received  any\r\n\r\nbonus myself!  I do not mean the Baby Bonus.  I mean that the\r\n\r\nresponse to the package of measures has not been encouraging,\r\n\r\nand  the fertility rates have continued to fall.  I hope that\r\n\r\nthis was because the economy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntook  a  downturn just as the measures were being introduced.\r\n\r\nI  am  told that couples are likely to delay or even  abandon\r\n\r\nplans for children in times of economic uncertainty.  We  saw\r\n\r\nthat  phenomenon in the previous two recessions in  1986  and\r\n\r\n1998.   So, maybe, the response will be better as the economy\r\n\r\nimproves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am not too hopeful. It will pick up somewhat, but\r\n\r\nthe  reason  for  declining  marriages  and  births  is  more\r\n\r\nfundamental.   We  are  experiencing  a  change  in  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards   marriage  and  family  among  the  young.   Surveys\r\n\r\ncontinue  to show that our young place financial  and  career\r\n\r\ngoals ahead of family formation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for 2001 hit a historic\r\n\r\nlow,  the  lowest on record, of 1.42 children per woman,  way\r\n\r\nbelow  the  replacement rate of 2.1.  The number of  resident\r\n\r\nbirths  in  2001 was about 40,000, a decline  of  12.5%  over\r\n\r\n2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decline in our marriage and procreation rates is\r\n\r\nclearly a national problem.  The implications are grave.   We\r\n\r\ncannot  let nature take its course, even though low fertility\r\n\r\nis  common among developed countries.  We need to act, as the\r\n\r\nimplications  of a continued sub-replacement TFR  are  severe\r\n\r\nfor  a  small country like ours.  We might not survive  as  a\r\n\r\nnation because of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is committed to creating a total social\r\n\r\nenvironment conducive to marriage and family formation.   The\r\n\r\nWorking  Committee  on  Marriage  and  Procreation  will   be\r\n\r\nconsidering  new measures.  However, there is  only  so  much\r\n\r\nthat  the Government can do.  Ultimately, marrying and having\r\n\r\nchildren are personal decisions.  It is up to Singaporeans to\r\n\r\ntake advantage of the support provided by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am heartened by the fact that numerous studies over\r\n\r\nthe  years  show  that  most among our young  desire  to  get\r\n\r\nmarried  and have children.  The majority say that the  ideal\r\n\r\nnumber of children is three.  But the figures show that  many\r\n\r\nare only having two or less.  Our focus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould,  therefore,  be  on them.   Besides  the  Government,\r\n\r\nparents,  friends,  relatives,  colleagues,  employers,   and\r\n\r\ncommunity and religious organisations can and must do more to\r\n\r\nbring  about  the  total  social  environment  conducive   to\r\n\r\nmarriage and having children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going back to Indranee's request to look into the\r\n\r\nhousing  needs of singles, yes, singles are an integral  part\r\n\r\nof  a  family.   The  needs of young  couples,  however,  are\r\n\r\ncomparatively more immediate and necessary as they  need  new\r\n\r\nflats to start their family.  Singles will be helped in their\r\n\r\nhousing,  but  the priority will be for couples  and  family.\r\n\r\nAnd  to  the pragmatic Singaporeans who have postponed  their\r\n\r\nmarriage  plans, I advise them to act fast.   The  timing  is\r\n\r\ngood now to get a choice flat to start a family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has tried many ways and means to make it\r\n\r\neasier  for  couples to have a family.  Any MP who  comes  up\r\n\r\nwith  an  ingenious and a better solution to help our singles\r\n\r\nget  married and our TFR increased, will get a bonus from me.\r\n\r\nNot the Baby Bonus, but a real bonus.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have listened to and read carefully\r\n\r\nthe speeches of the MPs.  I have instructed the Ministers  to\r\n\r\nfollow  up  on  their  concerns and  ideas.   I  myself  have\r\n\r\naddressed  this  House  on  three  critical  challenges   for\r\n\r\nSingapore.   These  are  challenges for  which  there  is  no\r\n\r\nobvious solution.  I wanted to inject a sense of reality into\r\n\r\nthis week's debate.  The world is a complex place, and often,\r\n\r\nthere  are  no black or white answers.  This then requires  a\r\n\r\nhard  choice to be made among a range of solutions,  most  of\r\n\r\nwhich  are  neither painless nor cost-free.   This  is  where\r\n\r\nleadership comes in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang Kai Yuen is right. The people want the Government\r\n\r\nto  lead.  They want the Government to listen to feedback and\r\n\r\nto consult them too.  But at the end of the day, they want  a\r\n\r\nstrong  Government that will find solutions to their problems\r\n\r\nand give them hope for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, several other MPs, including Tan Soo Khoon,\r\n\r\nfeel  that  Singaporeans are cynical and sceptical about  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   I do not agree.  Cynicism and scepticism  arise\r\n\r\nwhen the Government does not do what it says.  But this is  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  does  exactly what  it  says.   We  have  a\r\n\r\nreputation  for  being  legalistic,  clinical  and   precise,\r\n\r\nmeaning  also that we take very seriously our every word  and\r\n\r\ncommitment.   We  invest a great deal of effort  into  policy\r\n\r\nannouncements, to make sure that they are correct, because we\r\n\r\nwill  abide by our every undertaking.  Singaporeans know that\r\n\r\nwhen  we  state a policy, we will carry it through.  When  we\r\n\r\nconsult  the  people for their feedback, we take their  views\r\n\r\nseriously.   It  is practically not possible, of  course,  to\r\n\r\nacknowledge  individually  every  contribution.   Nor  is  it\r\n\r\npossible to accept every suggestion.  But that does not  mean\r\n\r\nthat we are merely going through the motions.  The views that\r\n\r\nare  expressed influence our thinking and attitude,  even  if\r\n\r\nsome do not get translated into specific actions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politicians in Singapore have high standing with the\r\n\r\npeople,  unlike politicians in many other countries.   We  do\r\n\r\nnot  shoot off our mouths, making wild promises and  baseless\r\n\r\naccusations.   Every  line we take is a carefully  considered\r\n\r\nand  deliberated policy.  For this reason, we do not like  to\r\n\r\nbe  referred to ourselves as \"politicians\" because this  word\r\n\r\n\"politicians\"  has  acquired a negative connotation  in  many\r\n\r\ncountries.  We prefer the term \"political leaders\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, a handful of Singaporeans are cynical and\r\n\r\nsceptical.   But  we should not generalise the  attitudes  of\r\n\r\nthese   few  Singaporeans  to  the  rest  of  the  3  million\r\n\r\nSingaporeans!  Indeed, if the large majority of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwere cynical and sceptical of the Government, they would  not\r\n\r\nhave  returned the PAP to power again and again in 10 General\r\n\r\nElections after 1959.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.

As I\r\n\r\nsaid,  we  had won elections again and again.  Also,  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  General  Election, in the contested seats,  the  voters\r\n\r\ngave  us  75 per cent of the vote.  Why?  Because  they  knew\r\n\r\nthat Singapore faced several severe challenges - the economic\r\n\r\nrecession,  the  terrorist threat  and  a  less  than  benign\r\n\r\nregional  environment.   And  the  voters  believed  in   our\r\n\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we must not disappoint them. We must lead. Look for\r\n\r\nnew  solutions  to old problems.  Anticipate future  problems\r\n\r\nand head them off.  Explain issues in simple, clear terms  to\r\n\r\nthe people and mobilise them behind the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running a Government is like conducting an orchestra.\r\n\r\nEvery PAP MP is a member of this orchestra.  Each MP has  his\r\n\r\nown musical instrument.  And there are many different musical\r\n\r\ninstruments, eg, the piano, violin, cello, oboe, bass,  drum,\r\n\r\nflute and so on, each providing a different sound.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they must produce beautiful music together. If we\r\n\r\nperform well, at the end of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neach  electoral term, the voters will ask for an encore.   If\r\n\r\nnot, the orchestra will not be invited back to perform.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this mean that the MPs must make similar speeches\r\n\r\nsince we are members of the same Party?  No.  Each speech  is\r\n\r\nlike  a  different instrument, with its different  sound  and\r\n\r\neffect.  But, taken together, all the speeches you have  made\r\n\r\nand  you  will  make,  must  sound like  a  grand  orchestral\r\n\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not understand this, and you sing Jail House\r\n\r\nRock  with  your  electric  guitar when  others  are  playing\r\n\r\nBeethoven,  you are out of order.  The Whip must be  used  on\r\n\r\nyou.   This does not mean that you cannot gyrate to the music\r\n\r\nof  Elvis Presley, but do it at an appropriate occasion, like\r\n\r\nat the end of Budget Debate party.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This orchestra analogy has relevance also to Singapore\r\n\r\nInc,  or to the whole of Singapore.  In this case, the entire\r\n\r\nnation  is  the orchestra.  The Government is the  conductor,\r\n\r\nand the people are the musicians.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As musicians, Singaporeans can play any instrument they\r\n\r\nlike, which means they should feel free to speak up and offer\r\n\r\ntheir  views  and suggestions, even if they are  contrary  to\r\n\r\nGovernment policy.  But do remember, whatever you do or  say,\r\n\r\nat  the end of the day, we must perform well enough as a team\r\n\r\nto  deliver economic growth, social harmony, quality of life,\r\n\r\nand security for ourselves and our children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be many challenges for which there is no\r\n\r\nfinal  solution  where we can declare, \"case closed\".   There\r\n\r\nare many problems which will remain with us for many years to\r\n\r\ncome.   And new challenges and problems will arise.  We  will\r\n\r\nsimply  have  to persevere, constantly try creative  and  new\r\n\r\napproaches, and manage problems to the best of our ability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that we can get on top of these difficult\r\n\r\nchallenges.    We  have  recruited  good  people   into   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.

We just have to find them and give them\r\n\r\nthe  reasons  to step forward, whether it is to  advance  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Cause or to achieve their Singapore Dream.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This - persuading Singaporeans that they should step\r\n\r\nforward  to  serve the nation - is itself a major  challenge.\r\n\r\nAs  Khaw  Boon  Wan put it, the dream of younger Singaporeans\r\n\r\nnowadays is the Global Dream.  They are well-educated,  well-read  and well-travelled.  They are mobile.  They can fit  as\r\n\r\nwell  into New York, as they can in Singapore.  They will  be\r\n\r\npulled by where the opportunities beckon.  What can we do  to\r\n\r\nkeep  their hearts here so that, even if they leave to pursue\r\n\r\ntheir Global Dream, they will return one day to Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can achieve these two goals - secure a constant\r\n\r\nflow   of   good  people  into  the  Government  and   anchor\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  firmly  to  Singapore -  then,  Singapore  will\r\n\r\nendure and prosper.  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, do you want to wrap up\r\n\r\nthe debate?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.05 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwrapping  up  after  the  Prime  Minister  has  spoken  is  a\r\n\r\nchallenging  task  but one which I will endeavour  to  do  my\r\n\r\nbest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to begin by thanking all 61 hon.\r\n\r\nMembers who have risen in support of the Motion of Thanks  to\r\n\r\nthe  President.   Over  the past five  days,  we  have  heard\r\n\r\nstatements of harsh realities, treated to excellent  displays\r\n\r\nof  wit  and  humour, and even a little  poetry.   There  is,\r\n\r\nhowever, strong evidence of a common will and spirit  in  all\r\n\r\nthat Members have said.  I am also happy to note that all new\r\n\r\nMembers have participated and clearly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndemonstrated their ability to add significantly to the  depth\r\n\r\nand breadth of parliamentary debate.  The House can therefore\r\n\r\nbe  expected to witness similarly lively debates  for  future\r\n\r\nsittings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this whole debate has to do with change in response\r\n\r\nto  all  the challenges: what has brought about the  numerous\r\n\r\nchanges  to our economic conditions, our social ties,  values\r\n\r\nand  the  political landscape, how do we cope with change  at\r\n\r\nthe  country and individual level, how we can exploit  change\r\n\r\nusing our strengths, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now my humble duty to highlight the common threads\r\n\r\nthat run through this debate, in the context of change, along\r\n\r\nthe following themes: competition, human capital, adaptation,\r\n\r\nnarrower divides, globalisation of terrorism, and engagement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Competition</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members have eloquently dwelt on the onslaught\r\n\r\nof  competition.   Increasing  competition,  especially  from\r\n\r\ntechnological  advances, will lead to shorter  product  life-cycles  and,  therefore, innovation and creativity  are  all-important.    Competition   is   ruthless   and   does    not\r\n\r\ndiscriminate.   Therefore, survival means  that  we  need  to\r\n\r\nconstantly offer a point of differentiation.  It is no longer\r\n\r\nenough to be simply more effective and efficient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also an acute awareness of the need and a\r\n\r\nsense  of urgency for Singapore to remain competitive.   Many\r\n\r\nMembers have urged the Government to review the cost of doing\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  Singapore.   Competition  also  comes  in   the\r\n\r\njuggernaut of China, how with its ample resources and massive\r\n\r\ndomestic   market,   it  is  already   competing   for   FDIs\r\n\r\naggressively.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Human Capital</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nothing strikes a more common chord than the\r\n\r\nrecognition that people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  our most precious resource.  And many Members have  made\r\n\r\ncalls  to  the  Government to do all it can to  maximise  the\r\n\r\npotential   of   all,  including  women,  by  ensuring   that\r\n\r\nopportunities  for education and multiple  role  playing  are\r\n\r\navailable.  Sustaining a competitive edge is all about having\r\n\r\na  relevant and nimble workforce, one that can bounce back in\r\n\r\nadversity.   There  is  no doubt that the  current  spate  of\r\n\r\nretrenchments will come increasingly from restructuring  than\r\n\r\na pure downturn in demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we recognise that retrenchment can occasionally be\r\n\r\nopportunistic,  in  the name of creating  shareholder  value,\r\n\r\nthat  it afflicts all across-the-board and is not limited  to\r\n\r\nlower-skilled  workers.  There is, therefore, also  no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  some jobs will never return, and Singaporeans who  used\r\n\r\nto hold these jobs will simply have to be reskilled for other\r\n\r\nemployment.   Otherwise, structural unemployment,  especially\r\n\r\nof  the  older workers, will be hard at the personal,  family\r\n\r\nand community levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can build on our strengths. We have a highly\r\n\r\nskilled   workforce,  well-regarded  for  quality  work   and\r\n\r\ndiligence, and a very strong Singapore brand.  We  also  have\r\n\r\nsolid  tripartite relations which we should leverage  on,  to\r\n\r\nhelp   ease   transition  in  career   switches   and,   more\r\n\r\nimportantly, to continue to present a difference  to  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Adaptation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change is also all about adaptation, in a pro-active and\r\n\r\nnot  reactive manner.  Many Members have called for a mindset\r\n\r\nchange  in  the  way we maintain our relevance  as  employees\r\n\r\nwhilst recognising that insecurity will be hard to shake  off - in  the  way we view success and failure in society, even  in\r\n\r\nschools;  in  the way the civil service can be  flexible  and\r\n\r\neffectively  facilitate  growth in the  private  sector.   As\r\n\r\nemployees, we now have to accept that contract work could  be\r\n\r\na  dominant feature, and the norm will be that we go  through\r\n\r\nseveral jobs in our lifetime or be economic gypsies,  as  one\r\n\r\nMember has put it.  Loyalties and predictable wage\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngrowth  would be replaced by rewards according to the  degree\r\n\r\nof innovation, creativity and risk-assumption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a people, we have to be psychologically prepared\r\n\r\nfor strategic changes that we would have to make: changes  in\r\n\r\nthe  tax structure, the composition of wages, as well as  the\r\n\r\nCPF scheme.  We would also have to rethink and review how  we\r\n\r\nuse  our  CPF as we address the aging population  and  rising\r\n\r\nsinglehood trends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Narrower Divides</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, on narrower divides. As a people, we should\r\n\r\nstrive  towards narrower divides, ie, help bridge the  wealth\r\n\r\nand  digital  divides that would otherwise  characterise  our\r\n\r\nmodern  world.   And this, we should achieve  through  closer\r\n\r\ncommunity  bonding and mutual responsibility.  We would  have\r\n\r\nto  be  watchful  of  external stresses  on  our  racial  and\r\n\r\nreligious  harmony and move towards greater  integration  and\r\n\r\nunderstanding.  We would also have to continue  to  build  on\r\n\r\nthe  principle  of meritocracy and equality of treatment  and\r\n\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Globalisation of Terrorism</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the globalisation of\r\n\r\nterrorism, which the Prime Minister has already dwelt  on  at\r\n\r\nlength.   Globalisation  has made  the  world  seem  smaller.\r\n\r\nTechnology  transfer can be had in the twinkling of  an  eye.\r\n\r\nBut  terrorism has also globalised along the way.  The  \"911\"\r\n\r\nattacks  and  similar events in the region have  demonstrated\r\n\r\nhow   the   economic  consequences  can  be  so   widespread.\r\n\r\nExperiencing  terrorism right at our  doorsteps  and  in  the\r\n\r\nregion underscores the importance of national defence  and  a\r\n\r\nneed  for  vigilance.   We must guard  against  the  negative\r\n\r\neffects of extremist tendencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Engagement</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last but not least, change is all about engagement.\r\n\r\nMany   Members  have  implored  the  Government   to   engage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans with greater intensity at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  levels and regardless of gender, race, age, religion  or\r\n\r\nphysical  ability.    No single group of Singaporeans  should\r\n\r\nfeel alienated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe it is worth belabouring the need to\r\n\r\nengage  especially  the  young, to increase  their  sense  of\r\n\r\nbelonging  to  Singapore, to enable them to contribute  their\r\n\r\nall   to  the  future  of  Singapore,  including,  hopefully,\r\n\r\nprocreating   enough.   This  should   rank   high   on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  agenda.  Engagement must be  genuine;  feedback\r\n\r\nand participation must be seen to play a constructive role so\r\n\r\nas  to  address  any  lingering scepticism.   Engagement  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, vital to strengthening the sense of ownership  of,\r\n\r\nand belonging to, Singapore.  In turn, it will strengthen our\r\n\r\nsense of ownership and belonging to one another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a nation, our sovereignty is absolute, and one shared\r\n\r\nby all Singaporeans.  It shall also be the basis for which we\r\n\r\nrelate to our neighbours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now just make some concluding remarks. We have\r\n\r\nthe  certainty of change and uncertainty from change.  Change\r\n\r\nwill  not wait to happen.  If unexpected, change will be very\r\n\r\nuncomfortable.  But change can be anticipated  to  a  certain\r\n\r\nextent.  And we have just heard from the Government,  by  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  himself,  that the Government  will  provide\r\n\r\nstrong  leadership and assurance that it will do  just  that:\r\n\r\nanticipate   change,  do  long-term  strategic  planning   to\r\n\r\nanticipate the shifts and leverage on our strengths, see  how\r\n\r\nwe can prepare our people to meet the new challenges, explain\r\n\r\nthe need for change, and invest in the necessary physical and\r\n\r\nsocial  infrastructure, so as to enable every Singaporean  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  in  his  own  way.  Our individual  response  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, critical as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, the ultimate challenge will be the uniting of\r\n\r\nboth  the Government and people in purpose and in undertaking\r\n\r\nthe necessary changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It leaves me now to thank all Members once again for\r\n\r\ntheir support, and I would like to invite all Members to join\r\n\r\nme in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthanking the President for his Address.

Previous  Speakers performed their  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nduties part-time.  This part-time arrangement has worked well\r\n\r\nover the years, and will continue.  There is no need, in  the\r\n\r\nforeseeable  future, for a full-time Speaker, as among  other\r\n\r\nthings, Parliament does not sit every day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speaker's full remuneration, like those of Ministers\r\n\r\nand  other elected office bearers, is pegged onto the  salary\r\n\r\nscales  of  the  Senior Administrative  Officers'  Scheme  of\r\n\r\nService.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament is requested to approve this motion, to fix\r\n\r\nthe Speaker's remuneration to 50% of the full-time rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, pursuant to Article 41 of the Constitution of the\r\n\r\nRepublic of Singapore, the Speaker shall be paid with  effect\r\n\r\nfrom 25th March 2002:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) a monthly salary and allowance equal to 50 per cent\r\n\r\nof  1.64  times the salary and allowance payable to a  Senior\r\n\r\nAdministrative   Officer  on  the  minimum   point   of   the\r\n\r\nMinisterial  Range  4  (MR4)  as  specified  in  the   Senior\r\n\r\nAdministrative Officers' Scheme of Service;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) a non-pensionable annual fixed bonus pegged at the\r\n\r\nnorm  Performance  Bonus  rate  of  a  Senior  Administrative\r\n\r\nOfficer on the minimum point of the Ministerial Range 4 (MR4)\r\n\r\nas specified in the Senior Administrative Officers' Scheme of\r\n\r\nService; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) a GDP Bonus pegged at the GDP Bonus rates payable\r\n\r\nto  a  Senior Administrative Officer on the minimum point  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministerial  Range 4 (MR4) as specified  in  the  Senior\r\n\r\nAdministrative Officers' Scheme of Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>REMUNERATION OF DEPUTY SPEAKERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, pursuant to Article 42(3) of the Constitution of\r\n\r\nthe  Republic of Singapore, each Deputy Speaker shall be paid\r\n\r\na  monthly  allowance  equal to 12 per cent  of  the  monthly\r\n\r\nsalary  and  allowances (excluding the  annual  fixed  bonus)\r\n\r\npayable to the Speaker with effect from 1st April 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the allowance payable to the Deputy Speakers had\r\n\r\nbeen set at a percentage of the actual salary received by the\r\n\r\nincumbent  Speaker.

The  last\r\n\r\ntwo  occasions when I moved a similar motion were on 29th May\r\n\r\n1992 and 5th June 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since the implementation of the NMP\r\n\r\nscheme  in  1990,  Parliament has granted 26 individuals  the\r\n\r\nprivilege  to  take part in the proceedings  in  this  House.\r\n\r\nWhile not all of them made the same level of contribution  to\r\n\r\nthe  debates in this Chamber, they have, generally, acquitted\r\n\r\nthemselves well, with some serving two terms of four years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, we have also increased the number of\r\n\r\nNMPs  from  two  to six, and then to nine, and  improved  the\r\n\r\nselection  process  by  having proposal  panels  to  nominate\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of functional groups as NMPs.  So,  in  1997,\r\n\r\napart from inviting the general public to submit the names of\r\n\r\nsuitable persons, the Special Select Committee on NMPs  wrote\r\n\r\nto  organisations representing three major functional groups:\r\n\r\n(a)   business  and  industry;  (b)   labour;  and  (c)   the\r\n\r\nprofessions  - to propose candidates for this Special  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee's consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a sitting on 5th June 1997, when we debated the\r\n\r\nmotion on having NMPs at the start of the Ninth Parliament, I\r\n\r\nalso said that the Government would con-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsider  further  improving  the  NMP  selection  process,   by\r\n\r\nexpanding  the number of functional groups invited to  submit\r\n\r\nnominations.  Thus, for this Tenth Parliament, the Government\r\n\r\nwould  like  the Special Select Committee to also  invite  an\r\n\r\nadditional three functional groups: (a) social and  community\r\n\r\nservice     organisations;    (b)     tertiary    educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions;  and  (c)  media,  the  arts  and  the   sports\r\n\r\norganisations  - to submit nominations.  The  Special  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  will nominate a coordinator among the  constituent\r\n\r\norganisations  of  each functional group.  Each  coordinating\r\n\r\norganisation  will  then consult its constituent/constituents\r\n\r\nand  eventually submit up to two names of two individuals  to\r\n\r\nthe Special Select Committee for consideration and interview.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government hopes that the outcome of doubling\r\n\r\nto  six  the  number  of functional groups  involved  in  the\r\n\r\nselection process will be an even wider cross section of NMPs\r\n\r\nentering   Parliament,   whose   diverse   but   non-partisan\r\n\r\nviewpoints  ought to make a contribution to our Parliamentary\r\n\r\ndebates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the merits and usefulness of having the\r\n\r\nNMP   scheme   have   been  thoroughly  debated   since   the\r\n\r\nConstitution  was first amended to provide for  it.   At  our\r\n\r\nsubsequent sittings of Parliament to resolve to have NMPs, we\r\n\r\nalso  exhaustively argued over the need to continue with  the\r\n\r\nscheme  and  we  voted  for it.  So I would  not  repeat  the\r\n\r\nreasons  why  we  should  have  the  NMPs  in  this  term  of\r\n\r\nParliament.  For those who are interested, I would  recommend\r\n\r\nthat they run through the Hansard on all the debates that  we\r\n\r\nhave had in the last three times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It suffices me to sum up by saying that NMPs have been a\r\n\r\nplus for our Parliament.  Many have distinguished themselves.\r\n\r\nTheir objective, non-partisan views on a wide range of issues\r\n\r\nbrought before this House have added value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I moved a similar motion in 1992 and 1997, the\r\n\r\nParty  Whip was lifted.  Now, for this motion, the Whip  will\r\n\r\nalso be lifted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to urge\r\n\r\nMembers of this House not to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport the motion moved by the Leader of the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Parliament is an elected institution\r\n\r\nand  we  must  keep it that way. Each Member  in  this  House\r\n\r\nfought their way through an electoral process involving  nine\r\n\r\nhard  days  of  campaigning  and  countering  many  traumatic\r\n\r\nmoments of electioneering.  Some who fought lost and are left\r\n\r\nout of this Chamber.  There were risks taken, like giving  up\r\n\r\ncomfortable jobs to venture into this political arena.  If we\r\n\r\nhad  lost  in  Jurong, our hon. Member, Mr Tharman  would  be\r\n\r\njobless  because he left MAS.  I am sure that  he  must  have\r\n\r\nsome  moments when he asked himself why he got into this when\r\n\r\nmatters  got  very  hot in Jurong.  But he went  through  the\r\n\r\nhustings and I am sure he felt a sense of pride and joy  when\r\n\r\nhe won.  He told me that he felt very humbled, just like what\r\n\r\nI felt when I won my first election in 1980.  Assoc. Prof. Ho\r\n\r\nPeng Kee, my good friend, fought very hard and he lost a  lot\r\n\r\nof  weight, but he won.  So also my good friend, Assoc. Prof.\r\n\r\nLow  Seow  Chay.  Steve, you gave him a hard fight,  but  you\r\n\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At every election, we go round to campaign for votes in\r\n\r\ntrucks,  lorries,  we  walk, we  run.   Every  time  we  meet\r\n\r\nsomebody, we ask them, \"please vote me\".  It takes a  lot  of\r\n\r\ncourage  to  ask somebody, \"please vote for me\".   Those  who\r\n\r\nhave not gone through an election do not understand, but most\r\n\r\nof  us, who have gone through would realise how difficult  it\r\n\r\nis  for us to ask somebody to vote for you.  And when they go\r\n\r\nknocking at the doors, sometimes when people open the door to\r\n\r\nyou, they do not offer you pleasantries.  They call you  -  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know  whether  it  is unparliamentary  language,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker  - \"PAP bastards, you get out!\"  But this is part  of\r\n\r\nthe hustings and we have to go through it.  At the end of the\r\n\r\nday,  we  develop a certain inner strength in us. We  develop\r\n\r\nthick  skin, as the Prime Minister said. We learn  to  handle\r\n\r\nabuses but we gain the respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These experiences will mould and change us, but also\r\n\r\nhelp us to tackle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nissues  and  to manage crisis.  So we Members in  this  House\r\n\r\ndeserve to come into this place because we made it, we earned\r\n\r\nit, we have the mandate.  Do we want people nominated to come\r\n\r\ninto  this  House and enjoy what you have fought so  hard  to\r\n\r\nearn a place here?  You better think twice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have once asked a Nominated Member of\r\n\r\nParliament  why  he  wanted to come to this  House.   He  was\r\n\r\nsilent.   He  said he was not interested in politics.   So  I\r\n\r\nasked  him,  \"Do  you know what this Chamber  is?\"   In  this\r\n\r\nChamber, every discussion is political in nature.   So  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  understand  why  a  person, who  is  not  interested  in\r\n\r\npolitics  is prepared to come into this Chamber, which  is  a\r\n\r\npolitical Chamber, as I have said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we want men of substance, not men of\r\n\r\nwords  in  this House.  In the last four days, we have  heard\r\n\r\nnumerous  speakers  in the House giving their  views  on  the\r\n\r\nremaking  of  Singapore and they addressed a  wide  range  of\r\n\r\nissues,  from high-tech to the bread and butter  issues,  and\r\n\r\neven  to what is happening in the region, terrorists,  tudung\r\n\r\nand  so  on.  And there were no NMPs in this House.  I wonder\r\n\r\nwhether anyone of you felt you missed their presence.  I  did\r\n\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideas and issues raised by all of you in this House\r\n\r\nwould give the Ministries a lot of work to do, and they  will\r\n\r\nbe kept busy for a long, long time.  Yet, we were told by the\r\n\r\nLeader of the House, in the last debate, that they needed non-elected Members to give us alternative views.  I have watched\r\n\r\nNMPs  perform in this House.  Yes, some of them were good  at\r\n\r\narticulating  issues,  but  no  better  than  our  Dr  Vivian\r\n\r\nBalakrishnan,  Mr Tharman Shamugaratnam, Dr  Wang  Kai  Yuen,\r\n\r\nAssoc.  Prof.  Chin,  so many of you  here.   So  if  we  ask\r\n\r\nourselves,  are they better than all of us, and if  they  are\r\n\r\nbetter than any one of us here, you let them in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because some of you are new here, let me bring up some\r\n\r\nof the things I said in this House 10 years ago.  It is still\r\n\r\nrelevant.  We had Nominated MPs in Parliament.  It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  not  called  Parliament.  It was  called  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly and there was a recommendation  by  the\r\n\r\nRendel  Commission.  The Rendel Commission recommended  four,\r\n\r\ntwo  to make sure that the minority interests are taken  care\r\n\r\nof,  and two to make sure that trade and business matters are\r\n\r\ntaken care of.  I am sure you can quite understand.  In 1954-1955, what was Singapore?  We were a third-world country.  We\r\n\r\ndid   not  have  so  many  PhDs.   Education  was  very  low.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  can expect that these people  were  there  to\r\n\r\noversee their interests.  We can understand that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there was an overriding clause that that feature was\r\n\r\nto  be  a  transient  feature,  and  that  it  would  not  be\r\n\r\npermanent.  And this non-permanent feature was later examined\r\n\r\nby  another Commission.  This Commission was chaired  by  the\r\n\r\nformer  Chief  Justice  Wee Chong Jin in  early  1966,  which\r\n\r\nexamined  whether  a council of nominated people  called  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  of State should be a part of Parliament.  They  were\r\n\r\nnon-elected  people, and their primary function was  to  make\r\n\r\nsure,  again,  to  check on minority  rights.   And  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of the new MPs, I quote paragraph 54, page 15, of the\r\n\r\nReport of the Constitutional Commission 1966:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It will be a body separate from Parliament, but to\r\n\r\nwhich Parliament can look for serious and weighty advice  and\r\n\r\nwhile  having  no control over legislation, it will,  to  the\r\n\r\nextent of having given its advice, share with Parliament  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for any legislation passed pursuant  to  such\r\n\r\nadvice.    We  think  the  continued  practice  of  a   sound\r\n\r\ndemocratic  system of government in Singapore  will  best  be\r\n\r\nachieved  if our recommendations leave untouched a unicameral\r\n\r\nlegislature  which we have at present, where all  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  are  elected  by the people  by  secret  vote  at\r\n\r\nelections  held at regular intervals of years.  In  this  way\r\n\r\nthe   many  and  grave  responsibilities  which  Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament taken upon as the elected representatives  of  the\r\n\r\npeople will rest solely on them.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even our Senior Minister - I would not quote him - said that no nominated people can give him advice. So, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, we have seen these two reports and  they  were\r\n\r\ncrafted by non-parliamentarians and yet, today, we are asking\r\n\r\nparliamentarians, all of you here, to endorse this  Nominated\r\n\r\nMembers scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 30 years have passed since those reports. This\r\n\r\nParliament  is  very different.  Members  of  the  House  are\r\n\r\nexperts in their own field.  Like I said, we have experts  in\r\n\r\nfinance, health, law, business and even unions.  The fear  of\r\n\r\nno  minority representation has been taken care of.  We  have\r\n\r\nthe Presidential Council on Minority Rights to make sure that\r\n\r\nall  legislation in this House must pass through their  hands\r\n\r\nto make sure that there is no discrimination against minority\r\n\r\ninterests.   Then  we  have the GRC  system  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nminority representation is guaranteed in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lack of women was one of the reasons our Prime Minister\r\n\r\ngave for wanting Nominated Members of Parliament.  Now I  see\r\n\r\n10 women in this House, and Members  have all listened to how\r\n\r\nour  10  women have performed in this House.  They  are  more\r\n\r\nthan adequate.  They are women of substance, and we have even\r\n\r\nincluded  single  women.  So, I think, we  have  covered  the\r\n\r\nwhole range of women's interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask this House, what more do they want? Alternative\r\n\r\nvoices?   We have the Opposition parties here.  We  have  the\r\n\r\nNCMP.   If we expect Nominated MPs to give opposition  views,\r\n\r\nour  past experience shows that some of the Nominated MPs are\r\n\r\nmore PAP than the PAP!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we cannot artificially create another\r\n\r\nvoice  in  this  House to represent sectoral  and  functional\r\n\r\ninterests.  We are pandering.  The moment we start to  pander\r\n\r\nto functional and sectoral groups, we are in trouble, because\r\n\r\nthere  is no end to it.  Everyone will come knocking  at  the\r\n\r\ndoor every two years asking why he is not represented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who do we select? They have a whole list of\r\n\r\nfunctional groups that are coming in.  But I said that if  we\r\n\r\nlook  at  some  of the women representatives of the  previous\r\n\r\nnominations, invariably, one must come from AWARE.  To me, it\r\n\r\nis  proxy representation for AWARE.  Why should this House be\r\n\r\nused as a platform for them to air their grievances and their\r\n\r\nviews?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We select lawyers. I wonder why. We have Davinder\r\n\r\nSingh   -   he  is  great.  We have Shanmugam, another  great\r\n\r\nsenior lawyer. We have Ravindran, Indranee, Sin Boon Ann.  We\r\n\r\nhave so many and yet we want more.  I think it is crazy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the worst - I cannot understand - is that we want unionists to enter this House. If I were an\r\n\r\nelected  unionist MP, I will be thoroughly embarrassed.   How\r\n\r\ncan  the  elected unionists have a nominated unionist sitting\r\n\r\nside  by side, listening to him, cautioning and advising  our\r\n\r\nMinister  for Manpower?  Surely there must be something  that\r\n\r\nis  not correct.  I am sure that our unionists here,  Yeo and\r\n\r\nothers,  will all agree with me that they all can do  a  very\r\n\r\ngood job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet the very people that cannot get representation\r\n\r\n-   the hawkers, the shopkeepers, the taxi drivers and so  on\r\n\r\n-  either they do not know the system or because they are not\r\n\r\nfamiliar  with the procedure.  I wanted to know  why.   So  I\r\n\r\nspoke  to  a  former Nominated MP, Gerard Ee.  He  said  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  some eliteness in our selection process, which  is\r\n\r\nquite  true, because we are biased towards the professionals.\r\n\r\nSo, who are they representing?  We are missing a big group of\r\n\r\npeople  outside clamouring to come in, and we are not  giving\r\n\r\nthem representation.  It is not fair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While listening to the Prime Minister, it suddenly\r\n\r\ndawned  on me that this system could be a backdoor entry  for\r\n\r\nreligious and racial politics.  The Prime Minister said  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  in charge.  Yes, we are in charge.  Let me tell  you\r\n\r\nthat  some enlightened ones will study our selection process.\r\n\r\nThey  will  be  wise to how we select, and  they  will  train\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  present in a very acceptable  form  for  this\r\n\r\nselection  committee.  And before long, we will  get  someone\r\n\r\nvery well educated, but he is a proxy representation of maybe\r\n\r\none  of  the  terrorist groups.  [Laughter]  This  is  not  a\r\n\r\nlaughing matter.  It is a remote possibility.  But if  things\r\n\r\ncan  happen  now, it can happen later.  Why do we  take  this\r\n\r\nchance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, this House, being the highest\r\n\r\nlegislative body in the land, must send the right signals  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   We must remember that in this House,  we  set\r\n\r\npolicies, we set rules, we make laws.  Singaporeans read  and\r\n\r\nwatch  us on television.  So, everything that we say  and  do\r\n\r\nhere  is examined in the living room,  and they take the  cue\r\n\r\nfrom us.  So they listen to all of us.  Many Members call for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  be prepared for a change in  lifestyle,  to\r\n\r\ntake  risks, to go into business areas where nobody dares  to\r\n\r\ngo.   And  we always tell them, \"Don't worry.  If  you  fail,\r\n\r\njump up, start again.\"  So we are risk advocators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to ask ourselves how Singaporeans are going to\r\n\r\nreact  on  the way we vote on this scheme.  We are asking  to\r\n\r\napprove  a  scheme to accept non-risk-takers  as  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament.  So it contradicts what many Members  are  saying\r\n\r\nin  this House.  We must think very carefully whether we want\r\n\r\nnon-risk-takers to come into this House.  Non-risk-takers are\r\n\r\nafraid of elections.  They are afraid of being challenged  by\r\n\r\nthe  electorate.  They are afraid of abuses.  But you all are\r\n\r\nprepared to go through.  You went through and you came out of\r\n\r\nit strong, and you are all here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must send a correct message to the ground. And if\r\n\r\nthe ground thinks that we have a double standard, then we are\r\n\r\nall  hypocrites.   We  cannot have a  double  standard.   You\r\n\r\ncannot  say that you can take risk, I cannot take risk.   Why\r\n\r\ncan  I not take risk?  Because I am a professional, I am well\r\n\r\nheeled,   but  I  am afraid you can take risk.   You  do  not\r\n\r\nbelong to that category.  To me, it is a double standard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, this time round, the Whip is lifted. I know\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has spoken about the Whip.  And  PAP  Members\r\n\r\nhere are not stupid as to bring down the Government, but this\r\n\r\nissue  is not a life-and-death issue.  This issue is to bring\r\n\r\nin  non-risk-takers into this House.  So, if Members want  to\r\n\r\nagree to have non-risk-takers, then vote for it.  But I  will\r\n\r\nvote against it.  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport this motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read the NMP debate on Hansard since 1989. I have\r\n\r\nread  many  of  the  arguments of Dr Tan Cheng  Bock  in  the\r\n\r\nHansard.  I think what sticks in his throat when it comes  to\r\n\r\nNMPs  is  that they enjoy the ride but they do  not  pay  the\r\n\r\nprice.    And  I  understand  this  sentiment.   No  one   is\r\n\r\nsuggesting that the men and women here are not excellent.   I\r\n\r\nthink they are absolutely excellent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the key question that we must ask ourselves on this\r\n\r\nmotion  is whether having Nominated Members of Parliament  in\r\n\r\nthis House will serve the national interest.  Do NMPs add  to\r\n\r\nthe public welfare that we, as elected representatives of the\r\n\r\npeople,  have been entrusted with?  My view is that it  does.\r\n\r\nIf  we  take the position, which I believe is shared by  many\r\n\r\nMembers in this House, that a vital role of Parliament is  as\r\n\r\na  debating Chamber on issues that affect the public welfare,\r\n\r\nthen  the addition of Nominated Members can only further this\r\n\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To arrogate this right to debate, to review and question\r\n\r\nthe  Government to only elected representatives is not to add\r\n\r\nbut  to  take away from the public interest.  It is precisely\r\n\r\nbecause  we  believe the discussion on public affairs  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  the exclusive preserve of political leaders,  but  a\r\n\r\nright  as  well  as  an obligation of citizens  that  various\r\n\r\ninitiatives  have  been  launched to  engage  the  public  in\r\n\r\nmatters  that  affect  their  lives  and  future.   Feedback,\r\n\r\ndialogue sessions, the Remaking Singapore Committee  and  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Review  Committee are but  manifestations  of  this\r\n\r\nbelief.  The Nominated Members of Parliament provision  gives\r\n\r\ninstitutional recognition to this in the highest deliberative\r\n\r\nassembly in the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Democracy\", as Clement Atlee said, \"means government by\r\n\r\ndiscussion.\".   Lord Lindsay, in his classic work,  Democracy\r\n\r\nand  Discussion, argued that \". anyone with experience of the\r\n\r\neffectiveness of discussion in a small democratic society\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust recognise how valuable is the contribution of those  who\r\n\r\nare  not  easily  convinced but can stand up  resolutely  for\r\n\r\ntheir own point of view.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of NMPs into this House, many\r\n\r\nresolute  men  and women had, together with elected  Members,\r\n\r\ncommitted their intelligence, expertise and experience in the\r\n\r\nservice  of  this nation by discussion and debate  on  issues\r\n\r\nthat affect Singapore's future.  In doing so, they helped  to\r\n\r\nfulfil one of the most important aims of Parliament, which is\r\n\r\nto  ensure that the Government acts in the national interest,\r\n\r\nfree of partisan inclinations and local prejudices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to me,\r\n\r\nDr  Tan is a man of principles.  I have known him as a fellow\r\n\r\nMP  for  the past 17 years.  He is a righteous man.  To  him,\r\n\r\nthe  world  is  black  and white, and  very  little  grey  in\r\n\r\nbetween.   He also tends to be obstinate, which is  a  virtue\r\n\r\nunder  certain circumstances.  Sir, if I were to choose  just\r\n\r\none  man to go into battle of life and death, I would  choose\r\n\r\nDr  Tan.   I knew, with him at my side, I would not  have  to\r\n\r\ncover my back, as he is absolutely dependable as a friend and\r\n\r\nas  a comrade.  He also knows his politics very well.  He  is\r\n\r\nnow  in  Parliament for the sixth term.  His PAP  Ayer  Rajah\r\n\r\nBranch  is indeed a very small branch, compared to the  other\r\n\r\nbranches  of PAP.  In fact, we have been urging him to  build\r\n\r\nup  his  branch.  And, yet, in the last General  Election  he\r\n\r\npolled  88% of the popular votes.  How he managed to do  that\r\n\r\nis  something  that we all should learn from.   I  think  the\r\n\r\nspeech  he  just gave showed us some of the things he  really\r\n\r\nlearned  how to do it.  And he had named all of us who  would\r\n\r\nspeak  against  him,  making it difficult  for  us  to  speak\r\n\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when Dr Tan spoke about the right of\r\n\r\nrepresentation  in  Parliament  and  spoke  against  the  NMP\r\n\r\nconcept,  I  believe all of us take his views very seriously.\r\n\r\nHowever,  despite  my respect for him,  I  think  he  is  too\r\n\r\nobstinate in his view in this area.  I believe he missed  two\r\n\r\nmajor points\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  his  speech.   Firstly, the right  of  representation  by\r\n\r\nballot box - he insisted that to be in this House, one has to\r\n\r\nbe tested by the ballot box.  Secondly, I think he completely\r\n\r\nignored  the contributions of the NMPs in Parliament to-date,\r\n\r\nthose who had served us in the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, around the world today, there are variants of\r\n\r\ndemocracy and democratic representation, each evolved to suit\r\n\r\nthe  situation of the respective countries.  Enough had  been\r\n\r\nsaid about this in the previous debates on this very topic in\r\n\r\nNovember 1989 and March 1990 when the Bill was tabled for the\r\n\r\nSecond and Third readings.  The subject was again extensively\r\n\r\nelaborated in March 1992 and June 1997 when a motion to admit\r\n\r\nNMPs  in the respective term of Parliament was debated again.\r\n\r\nBasically Dr Tan argued for what I would classify as a static\r\n\r\nvision  of Parliament.  He would like to see that as long  as\r\n\r\npossible - the concept that he had learned as a young man  be\r\n\r\nperpetuated unchanged in this Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say, Sir, representation in Parliament should not be\r\n\r\nthat  static and should not be locked into time.   Parliament\r\n\r\nis  a living thing and it should evolve with the needs of the\r\n\r\ntime.   Just like the concept of marriage, husband and  wife,\r\n\r\nthat evolves through human history.  Today, one man, one wife\r\n\r\nis  the  accepted  norm  in Singapore.   However,  under  the\r\n\r\nWomen's Charter, bigamy is illegal in Singapore, but  it  was\r\n\r\nnot  that way that long ago.  Just about 50 years ago, it was\r\n\r\nquite acceptable in Singapore for a man to have more than one\r\n\r\nwife.   Now  if  you really go back in time,  anthropologists\r\n\r\nwould  tell  us  that most human societies  were  a  maternal\r\n\r\nsociety,  remnants  of which could still be  found  scattered\r\n\r\nhere  and there around the world.  In some of these, a  woman\r\n\r\ncould  have  many spouses.  Today, in some western societies,\r\n\r\nsame  sex partner families are recognised by law as  a  basic\r\n\r\nfamily unit similar to the traditional family unit.  So  even\r\n\r\nwith a concept as fundamental as the concept of family, there\r\n\r\nis  no absolute.  It is but a value system acceptable to  all\r\n\r\nmembers of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommunity appropriate to the demands of the time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will present to Dr Tan that this is\r\n\r\nthe  case with Parliament.  We should be an institution  that\r\n\r\nshould be enhanced to meet the needs of the time.  NMP to  me\r\n\r\nis   an   innovation  in  the  Singapore  Parliament.     The\r\n\r\nconstitutionality  of  the  NMP  concept  has  already   been\r\n\r\nsettled.  Theory aside, the question we should ask ourselves,\r\n\r\nas  Mr Raymond Lim has pointed out, in this motion is whether\r\n\r\nNMPs  inducted into Parliament have been positive or negative\r\n\r\nto  Parliament.  Have they added to the depth and the breadth\r\n\r\nof debate in Parliament?  Sir, I think everyone, including Dr\r\n\r\nTan,  must  agree that many of them did contribute to  better\r\n\r\ndebate  in  Parliament.  Names that readily crop  up  include\r\n\r\nProf. Walter Woon, Claire Chiang - I think we all missed  her\r\n\r\nvery  much  -  Jennifer Lee, Shriniwas  Rai,  Thomas  Thomas,\r\n\r\nZulkifli Baharudin, Tay Beng Chuan, among others.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink these are non-risk takers.  Many of them are successful\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  in  their  own right.  Surely,  they  are  risk-takers.   Yes,  while some NMPs could have  contributed  more\r\n\r\nbut,  overall,  I  think  we are  better  off  with  NMPs  in\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the arguments Dr Tan has as regards NMP\r\n\r\nrepresentation  is whether they represent  anyone  when  they\r\n\r\ncome  into Parliament.  I think, Sir, we should ask  instead,\r\n\r\nwhether  NMPs are Members of Parliament.  The answer actually\r\n\r\nlies  with  Singaporeans.   Do Singaporeans  accept  them  as\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament?  And whether NMPs have been  accepted\r\n\r\nby the international community of parliamentarians is another\r\n\r\nquestion we should ask.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the privilege of attending several\r\n\r\ninternational conferences of parliamentarians  with  some  of\r\n\r\nour  NMPs  in the past, and these NMPs had done us  proud  in\r\n\r\nthese  international forums.  They were accepted  by  all  as\r\n\r\nequal.  So if a flower looks like a rose, feels like a  rose,\r\n\r\nsmells like a rose, it is a rose.  The other argument Dr  Tan\r\n\r\nhas  against the NMP concept is that we should not provide  a\r\n\r\nbackdoor  for people who are non-risk takers into Parliament.\r\n\r\nAnd I believe he said that this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  not just a debating shop; it is a political chamber where\r\n\r\nwe make decisions.  Surely, Sir, Dr Tan knows from the bottom\r\n\r\nof  his  heart  that  there is actually  a  major  difference\r\n\r\nbetween  an  elected  Member of Parliament  and  a  Nominated\r\n\r\nMember  of  Parliament.  This difference is obvious  even  to\r\n\r\nthose  who volunteered and were selected to be NMPs.   In  my\r\n\r\nview,  an  elected Member of Parliament is more than  just  a\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the people in his constituency because  we,\r\n\r\nthe  elected  MPs, do not carry out an opinion  poll  of  our\r\n\r\nconstituents every time we speak.  An elected MP, everyone of\r\n\r\nus  - Backbenchers, Opposition Members included - is a leader\r\n\r\nin  our  own right.  So, in a crunch, I think we are expected\r\n\r\nto step forward and to lead.  Having NMPs in the Chamber does\r\n\r\nnot  dilute or blur this distinction.  Thus, in my mind, Sir,\r\n\r\nhaving NMPs in the House does not provide a backdoor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nominated Members are just a different category of\r\n\r\nMembers  in this House and should be recognised and  accepted\r\n\r\nas  such.   Sir,  being an NMP is already  difficult  enough.\r\n\r\nThey  have to make a mark within a very short period of time.\r\n\r\nI  am already a fifth term MP and I still have a lot to learn\r\n\r\nto improve my performance in Parliament.  For NMPs to leave a\r\n\r\nmark  within their first two-year term, they are indeed  rare\r\n\r\nindividuals with outstanding abilities.  Talents are hard  to\r\n\r\ncome  by  and  we  should  not make it  harder  for  talented\r\n\r\nindividuals to step forward to serve in this capacity as NMPs\r\n\r\nin  this  House.  We should not denigrate the office  of  the\r\n\r\nNMP,  thereby  discouraging more outstanding  individuals  to\r\n\r\nstep  forward.   With all due respect to my good  friend,  Dr\r\n\r\nTan,  I  do not think he is doing a service to this House  by\r\n\r\nopposing this motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this motion and urge all my colleagues to\r\n\r\nvote in favour of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfirst,  I would like to thank you for allowing me to join  in\r\n\r\nthis debate on Nominated MPs (NMPs).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the NMP scheme is, of course, laudable.\r\n\r\nAs explained by the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nLeader of the House, Mr Wong, the addition of up to nine NMPs\r\n\r\nwill  add  to  the quality of the debate in  this  House.   I\r\n\r\nsurmise  therefore that the NMP scheme is introduced  not  so\r\n\r\nmuch due to the lack of PAP MPs, but to overcome the lack  of\r\n\r\nopposing and discerning views in Parliament, arising from the\r\n\r\nlack of Opposition MPs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to state my case on why I feel that for\r\n\r\nthis  new Parliament, there is no need for an NMP scheme,  in\r\n\r\nspite  of  the fact that there continues to be a  paucity  of\r\n\r\nOpposition Members in this House.  I would like to  bring  up\r\n\r\nsome new angles, instead of what some Members have claimed to\r\n\r\nbe  old  angles, as raised by Dr Tan Cheng Bock.   There  are\r\n\r\nmany  reasons why this new term of Parliament could  do  away\r\n\r\nwith  NMPs.   I think the NMP scheme has been useful  in  the\r\n\r\npast, but I think it will serve limited use in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first point is that for this new session of\r\n\r\nParliament,  the PAP Whip will be lifted.  That makes  a  big\r\n\r\ndifference.  The Leader of the House has said that  in  cases\r\n\r\nof  certain Bills that are not critical - even the PM himself\r\n\r\nhas  said so - he will allow PAP MPs to speak up, which means\r\n\r\nthat  now, except for some critical Bills, we have a new body\r\n\r\nof  MPs  to  take  on issues - the PAP MPs.   With  this  new\r\n\r\nParliament, the new PAP MPs, as well as the old PAP MPs,  can\r\n\r\ntherefore  speak  with more conviction  and  freedom.   Their\r\n\r\nviews  on  Government policy can be more  engaging.   In  the\r\n\r\npast,  we all know that the PAP MPs' mouths had been  gagged.\r\n\r\nWe could not speak up, because there was a Whip behind us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> No.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> You can speak against it, but you\r\n\r\nhave to vote for it.  It sounds very illogical.  Anyway,  now\r\n\r\nthat the Whip has been lifted for those who want to speak,  I\r\n\r\nthink they can speak more readily and more heartily.  But, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  they have to be responsible for whatever  they  say.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  think  we do not need more  NMPs,  because  we\r\n\r\nalready have such a large body of PAP MPs.  This is one major\r\n\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second difference I would like to say is that\r\n\r\nwe  now have a large quantity and quality of MPs, and new PAP\r\n\r\nMPs,  in  this Parliament.  There are 24 new PAP MPs and  one\r\n\r\nnew  NCMP.   Certainly, with these 25 new faces put together,\r\n\r\nand with the old existing veteran MPs, what more views can be\r\n\r\noffered  in  this House and not more effective  that  can  be\r\n\r\ncovered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard how well most of the MPs who have spoken - all the 50-over of them - how well they have covered their\r\n\r\npoints,  and how eloquent they are.  As you have  seen,  even\r\n\r\nincluding  a  poem by my GRC colleague, Dr Ng Eng  Hen.   And\r\n\r\nalso  we  just  saw this morning how well a new  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState,  Dr Balaji, had fielded the barrage of questions  from\r\n\r\nthe  other MPs.  Many of these questions are from the new MPs\r\n\r\nthemselves.  So these are examples that we are going to  have\r\n\r\ngood debate in this House with this new crop of good MPs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even the hon. Member, Mr Chiam - I remember he told\r\n\r\nme  just  two days ago - that it was most refreshing to  hear\r\n\r\nour new PAP MPs speak.  Is that not right?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, the other argument about having\r\n\r\nNMPs  is  that  they  represent a wider  spectrum  of  public\r\n\r\nopinion.  Once again, I wish to contend that we already  have\r\n\r\na  wide and adequate representation in this House.  As Dr Tan\r\n\r\nCheng Bock has said, we have businessmen, we have Ph.Ds.,  we\r\n\r\nhave entrepreneurs, we have unionists, we have professionals,\r\n\r\ndoctors,  lawyers - what else do we want?  Everything  is  in\r\n\r\nthis House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in terms of elected female MPs, again like Dr Tan\r\n\r\nCheng  Bock has said, now we have increased from four to  10,\r\n\r\nand  we see more colours of dresses now.  So do you want more\r\n\r\ncolours  from  the  NMPs?  I think not.   Dr  Wang  had  also\r\n\r\nmentioned  that in the past, there were some very good  NMPs.\r\n\r\nI must say I agree with him.  I can single out some very good\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nones  myself.  But my contention is that for every good  NMP,\r\n\r\nwe  have at least one good PAP MP to cover or be equal to the\r\n\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite you examples. I recall Assoc. Prof. Walter\r\n\r\nWoon - he was eloquent, penetrating in his remarks.  In fact,\r\n\r\nhe  came out with the Maintenance of Parents Bill, which  was\r\n\r\nvery  remarkable.  We had Dr Augustine Tan, equally eloquent,\r\n\r\nequally deep and penetrating in his debates.  Then we had  Dr\r\n\r\nLee Tsao Yuan, from the NMP side; on our side we had Dr Aline\r\n\r\nWong,  equally eloquent and adequate in covering  points.   I\r\n\r\nthink  in  the last Parliament, we had Mr Tay Beng  Chuan,  a\r\n\r\ngood businessman who brought up several business issues,  but\r\n\r\nwe  have  Inderjit Singh.  And then we had,  of  course,  Mdm\r\n\r\nClaire  Chiang, who is a very good speaker as well.  We  have\r\n\r\nDr  Lily Neo who can match Mdm Claire Chiang, word for  word,\r\n\r\nspeech  for speech, maybe dress for dress.  I think she  also\r\n\r\nhas  one up on Mdm Claire Chiang.  She has her famous \"Hairdo\r\n\r\nDebate\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, all the other past NMPs that we have in this House\r\n\r\ncan be equally matched by our PAP MPs.  So what can they add?\r\n\r\nI  would like to argue against Mr Raymond Lim that, at  best,\r\n\r\nthe  contributions  the  NMPs  can  give  are  marginal,  not\r\n\r\nsubstantial.  Of course, we also have the other NMP  who  was\r\n\r\nquite  notable, Mr Simon Tay.  I remember him very well.   He\r\n\r\nmade  very good remarks, very articulate.  Of course, we have\r\n\r\non  our  side Dr Tan Cheng Bock himself, well matched  to  Mr\r\n\r\nSimon Tay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to belittle the contributions of the\r\n\r\npast  26 NMPs, or imply that they did not contribute  to  the\r\n\r\ndebates,  or the cut and thrust of this House.  I  said  they\r\n\r\nare  honourable people and I have very high regard for  them.\r\n\r\nI  respect  them.   All  I  am saying  is  that  we  do  have\r\n\r\nsufficient numbers of elected MPs in this House to cover  all\r\n\r\nthe bases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are three strong lines of attacks we\r\n\r\nhave from the backbench to take on the frontbench.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the speeches of the MPs in the last\r\n\r\nfew  days, I am even more convinced than ever that we do  not\r\n\r\nneed  NMPs.   The backbenchers are particularly pleased  with\r\n\r\nthe  return of Mr Tan Soo Khoon, the former Speaker.  He  has\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  just by two speeches that he is  a  speechmaker\r\n\r\npar excellence, as Dr Wang Kai Yuen has said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in this new House, we have three strong lines\r\n\r\nof  formation of attack to take on the frontbench.  The first\r\n\r\nline  are  the  25  new MPs which includes  the  \"Magnificent\r\n\r\nSeven\",  ie,  the  seven new Ministers of  State  and  Senior\r\n\r\nMinisters  of State.  The next line we have are  the  second,\r\n\r\nthird  and slightly older MPs, which include people  like  Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit Singh, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, Dr Lily Neo and Prof.  Chin\r\n\r\nTet Yung.  Then we have the final line, the strongest line we\r\n\r\ncall it, there we have the double Tans: Dr Tan Cheng Bock and\r\n\r\nMr  Tan  Soo  Khoon.  And backed by them are  also  good  and\r\n\r\ncapable  MPs,  Dr Wang Kai Yuen and, again,  Prof.  Chin  Tet\r\n\r\nYung,  and  of  course next to him, Dr  Ong  Chit  Chung  and\r\n\r\nothers.   These are all very good back-up forces  to  support\r\n\r\nthe  two Tans.  With all this firepower, why do we need NMPs?\r\n\r\nI do not understand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the final analysis on whether or not we\r\n\r\nshould have NMPs does not depend on how well they speak,  but\r\n\r\nwhat value they bring to the House and what contrasting views\r\n\r\nthey  can  bring.  Sir, I must say that they  do  bring  some\r\n\r\nviews.  But I must contend against Mr Raymond Lim that maybe,\r\n\r\nat best, marginal.  Sir, my GRC colleague, Dr Ng Eng Hen, has\r\n\r\ncalled  this Chamber a \"theatre\".  I am sure he did not  mean\r\n\r\nthat  this  House is a theatre for shows.  Not  a  place  for\r\n\r\nwayang wayang, or play-play.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House debates on serious matters. We all agree on\r\n\r\nthat.   Therefore,  it is not the quantity,  that  means  the\r\n\r\nadditional number of NMPs, that counts, but it is the quality\r\n\r\nand  substance that count.  Added to that, we need to add  in\r\n\r\n\"conviction\".    Elected  MPs need to  have  the  conviction.\r\n\r\nThey  speak  from their hearts for the people.  NMPs  do  not\r\n\r\nhave to do that.  They\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave no constituents.  NMPs can come and go.  But elected MPs\r\n\r\ncannot.  Elected MPs have obligations to the people who  vote\r\n\r\nfor them.  Elected MPs must be responsible, speak up and make\r\n\r\ntheir voice heard in this House.  Sir, Dr Wang Kai Yuen  said\r\n\r\nthat  roses that smell like roses must be roses.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nagree.   NMPs  and elected MPs are different,  and  they  are\r\n\r\ndifferent.  They come from a different breeding process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when this NMP Bill was first introduced in 1989, I\r\n\r\nwas  ambivalent  and  unsure of whether  to  support  it.   I\r\n\r\nchecked  the  Hansard and noted that I did say that  I  could\r\n\r\nsupport  this  Bill  subject to certain qualifications.   But\r\n\r\nover   the  years  and  after  observing  my  fellow  elected\r\n\r\nbackbenchers perform in the last few days, I would  say  that\r\n\r\nnow I do not feel the need for the NMPs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Bill was first introduced by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  Mr  Goh Chok Tong who was the first  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  then,  he summed up the debate by  saying  that  he\r\n\r\nsurmised  that the uneasiness was not so much about the  Bill\r\n\r\nitself,   but   with  the  uneasiness  of  the  elected   MPs\r\n\r\nthemselves.  I think this uneasiness was true, and  is  still\r\n\r\ntrue.  Let me explain why.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me use the concept of \"shelf space\". Parliament is\r\n\r\nan  august House, not a theatre, where all the elected MPs do\r\n\r\ntheir  serious  work.  This is where MPs do  their  work,  by\r\n\r\nmaking laws and debating on Government policies, as the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has just made a very important and inspiring  speech\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  hear.   Parliament is also a  major  avenue  for\r\n\r\nelected  MPs to reach out to the constituents they represent.\r\n\r\nTheir  constituents want to hear their MPs speaking  out  for\r\n\r\nthem.   They  want to see their MPs at work.   Now,  the  NMP\r\n\r\ninterrupts this process of the elected MPs at work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, let me explain the \"shelf space\" concept. NMPs\r\n\r\noccupy  shelf  space.   In a supermarket,  every  product  is\r\n\r\nfighting  for  shelf space to gain consumer  attention.   One\r\n\r\nextra  product,  one extra can of sardine by  another  brand,\r\n\r\ntakes up the shelf space.  So PAP is the premium No. 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproduct.   The consumers decided that this is so.  They  also\r\n\r\ndecided that Opposition MPs can only have two out of  the  84\r\n\r\nshelf space. So be it.  But why do we need more?  There is no\r\n\r\nreason for us to introduce a third brand called NMP.  NMP is,\r\n\r\nwhat  I call, a \"generic\" brand, a no-name brand, a \"me  too\"\r\n\r\nproduct.  No self-respecting premium brand producer wants  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  a generic brand to the consumers just because  the\r\n\r\ncompetitor  No.  2  is very weak.  I do not  understand  this\r\n\r\nmarketing strategy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to reiterate that we are not against\r\n\r\ncompetition as such in this House.  It is good to  have  more\r\n\r\ndebates  and  more competition.  And I have  nothing  against\r\n\r\nNMPs  themselves.   I also do not want to debase  their  past\r\n\r\ncontribution,  but I am only against the NMP  scheme.   Those\r\n\r\nwho   have  accepted to be NMPs in the past have contributed,\r\n\r\nbut  there are other avenues for them to be heard,  to  voice\r\n\r\ntheir   opinions.   Of  course,  they  can  first  join   the\r\n\r\nelections,  no  matter whether they are on a PAP  ticket,  or\r\n\r\nopposition   ticket.   Or  they  can  become  an  independent\r\n\r\ncandidate, if they want to.  If not, they can join the  other\r\n\r\nprocesses  where they can also have their views heard.   They\r\n\r\ncan be invited to the Economic Review Committee, the Remaking\r\n\r\nof Singapore Committee, Feedback Committee, public forums and\r\n\r\ndialogues where their views can be heard.  So I contend  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no need for them to enter Parliament.  As  Dr  Tan\r\n\r\nCheng Bock has said, it is a political process, not a talking\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elected MPs have work to do here. Sometimes, I am\r\n\r\nvery  saddened to hear an MP, especially a newer  MP,  making\r\n\r\nvery  good  points in Parliament, but because of the  limited\r\n\r\nmedia  space, as I said earlier, shelf space, they  are  shut\r\n\r\nout.   They did not get the media coverage they deserve, such\r\n\r\nthat their constituents cannot know what he or she has to say\r\n\r\non their behalf.  Elected MPs have constituents to answer to.\r\n\r\nNMPs  do  not.  The debate on the Presidential Address  is  a\r\n\r\nprime  example.   Over  50 MPs spoke  up,  not  counting  the\r\n\r\nMinisters, DPM and PM himself.  But many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMPs'  speeches were not covered at all by the media.  So,  if\r\n\r\nwe  have  more  NMPs,  it means even less  coverage  for  the\r\n\r\nelected MPs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to make a final point as to why I feel\r\n\r\nthat  things  are a bit different now.  Debate is  a  two-way\r\n\r\nprocess.   NMPs may add to the debate, yes, I can agree  with\r\n\r\nthat.  But we can have all debates we want in this House.  It\r\n\r\nis  no  use if the Ministers are not listening.  We now  know\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministers  are  listening.   Yesterday,  DPM   Lee\r\n\r\nactually assured the House that he would listen, and he would\r\n\r\nnot  bristle.  When the Ministers are listening, at least the\r\n\r\nspeeches  they make are making an impact.  So it is  not  the\r\n\r\nquantity  or  the  numbers that count.   It  is  whether  the\r\n\r\nrecipient side also makes an effort to hear and to take  into\r\n\r\naccount the views.  With more receptive Ministers, of  course\r\n\r\ncapable  and  good Ministers, and more eloquent  and  elected\r\n\r\nMPs, do we need more NMPs?  Surely not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me end by saying that since the PAP Whip is\r\n\r\nlifted, I urge my fellow PAP MPs to search deeply into  their\r\n\r\nhearts.    Ask yourself:  is there a need for NMPs?  What  is\r\n\r\nit  that they can do that we elected MPs cannot do?  With the\r\n\r\nWhip off my back, Sir, I intend to vote against this motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like me, those MPs who have spoken in support of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill in the past, which I did, could change their  minds\r\n\r\ngiven  the new circumstances.  That is precisely the  purpose\r\n\r\nof  the  motion  being tabled and put  to  the  new  term  of\r\n\r\nParliament,   so  that  each  new  term  of  Parliament   can\r\n\r\nreconsider whether there is a need for NMPs.  Sir,  there  is\r\n\r\nno  longer a need.  I contend the time has now come  for  us,\r\n\r\nthe elected MPs, to speak up, speak from our hearts.  We, the\r\n\r\nbackbenchers, have asked the Minister and civil servants  for\r\n\r\na  mindset change.  How about our own mindset?  We also  must\r\n\r\nchange.  Be prepared to say, no, if you are persuaded that  a\r\n\r\n\"no\" is right.  Say \"no\" to the NMP motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davinder Singh (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe speakers before me have been addressing the question as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthough the issue before Parliament is whether there is  merit\r\n\r\nin the NMP scheme.  But we have passed that, have we not?   I\r\n\r\nthought  the  question now is whether, having regard  to  the\r\n\r\nexperience we have had of the NMP scheme for more than  10-12\r\n\r\nyears,  there is a reason to get rid of it.  We have  already\r\n\r\ndecided, many of us still in this House, that there is  merit\r\n\r\nin the scheme, that it serves the purpose and it improves the\r\n\r\nprocess.  If this House is being asked to look at it  afresh,\r\n\r\nit  must be with a view to asking ourselves whether something\r\n\r\nhas  gone  wrong  with the NMP scheme  for  us  to  say  that\r\n\r\nthrowing it out is justified.  Let us look at the record.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened to the NMP scheme which has degraded\r\n\r\nthe parliamentary process?  What have the NMPs, who have come\r\n\r\nto  this  House, session after session, done to diminish  the\r\n\r\nstanding  of this House?  Have they done anything  which  has\r\n\r\nadversely  affected the interests of the people?   Have  they\r\n\r\ndone  anything  which  has made it more  difficult  for  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  to govern?  Have they done anything  to  make  it\r\n\r\nmore difficult for the elected MPs to put their views across?\r\n\r\nIf  I  hear  an argument which suggests that, yes, they  have\r\n\r\ndone  something contrary to our interests which,  ultimately,\r\n\r\naffects  the  man-in-the-street, then we can begin  a  debate\r\n\r\nabout casting away this scheme.  But what we have is a rehash\r\n\r\nof the arguments that we went through in 1989.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at the Hansard and Dr Tan Cheng Bock had done a\r\n\r\nservice  to us by reminding us of his arguments that he  made\r\n\r\nin 1989 and, to a large extent, so too has Mr Leong, although\r\n\r\nthen I think he took a different position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us go through the arguments one by one. The NMP\r\n\r\nscheme resulted, apart from anything else, in the passage  of\r\n\r\nthe  Maintenance of Parents Act.  How many people  have  been\r\n\r\nhurt  by that and how many people have benefited?  Would that\r\n\r\nAct  have come through this House and ended up as legislation\r\n\r\non  our  own  steam?  Could it?  I have difficulty  believing\r\n\r\nthat  because  I remember, when Prof. Walter Woon  stood  up,\r\n\r\nmany people in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  House  spoke  up  against it.   Let  us  ask  ourselves\r\n\r\nhonestly:  would  that  Act  have  been  passed  on  our  own\r\n\r\ninitiative?  And has that Act operated to benefit  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  people  who do not have the resources  to  go  to\r\n\r\ncourt,  and  people  who need the help of the  Government  to\r\n\r\nrecover  from  recalcitrant children?  Do we  throw  the  NMP\r\n\r\nscheme out because people have benefited?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask Members another question. One of the\r\n\r\nconcerns  highlighted by Dr Tan in 1989 was that this  scheme\r\n\r\nwas going to open the door for racial and religious groups to\r\n\r\nbe  represented in this House and, therefore, we were  asking\r\n\r\nfor  trouble.  Has that happened?  In 1992, I think, Mr  Tang\r\n\r\nLiang  Hong  tried to make a move to come in  under  the  NMP\r\n\r\nscheme,  and the people who stood up, who wrote in to  oppose\r\n\r\nit, were the elected MPs.  As a result of that opposition, he\r\n\r\nfailed  to get into this House.  Since then, no other  person\r\n\r\nhas tried, no matter how cleverly, to get into this House  so\r\n\r\nthat  he  can advance a sectarian cause.  It is one thing  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  there is a \"remote possibility\" - I think  Dr  Tan\r\n\r\nused  those words - of that happening;  it is another to  ask\r\n\r\nourselves:  has  it  happened?  And,  really,  is  there  any\r\n\r\nchance, given the fact that we are now talking about it, that\r\n\r\nwe will let that happen?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us go to the next argument that is made, ie, that\r\n\r\nParliament  is  an elected Chamber and, so,  as  purists,  we\r\n\r\nshould  retain this form.  And that is the operative  word  - form.   Having heard the arguments that Dr Tan and  Mr  Leong\r\n\r\nhave  very  eloquently put across, it seems to me  that  they\r\n\r\nwould  have  no  quarrel with this notion.  We  will  have  a\r\n\r\nseparate body, we would not call it Parliament.  The  NMPs  - we  can  call them something else - will sit there  with  our\r\n\r\nMinisters  in  the  Frontbench,  make  their  speeches,   get\r\n\r\nresponses and have the media cover them.  But so long as they\r\n\r\nare  not  in  this  House, so long as they are  not  in  this\r\n\r\nelected  Chamber,  that  is fine.  But  because  this  is  an\r\n\r\nelected  Chamber, they should not be sitting in  these  seats\r\n\r\nand  they  should  not be joining us in  this  House  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate.  But they can do it in another forum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are past form. We were past form a long time ago,\r\n\r\nwhen  we  brought  in  the NCMP.  He is not  elected  by  any\r\n\r\nstretch of the imagination.  So we can either go for form  or\r\n\r\nwe  can go for substance.  And, at the end of the day, has it\r\n\r\nbeen  substance the last 12 to 13 years, or has it been form?\r\n\r\nMr  Leong  himself  says  that  there  have  been  very  good\r\n\r\nperformances from Prof. Woon, Ms Claire Chiang and the others\r\n\r\nwhom  he has named, and that is credit given where it is due.\r\n\r\nIt  has  not been pure eloquence; it has been substance.   It\r\n\r\nhas  forced the rest of us to sit up to do a bit better.   It\r\n\r\nhas  added  a dimension to this House which none of  us  were\r\n\r\nable to give and had the time to give.  How have we lost  out\r\n\r\nby  that  process?  I have difficulty understanding  how  all\r\n\r\nthese  points aggregate to create an argument to throw out  a\r\n\r\nscheme that has done well for us and for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the argument is made that these NMPs do not speak\r\n\r\nfor  their  electorate,  in  other  words,  I  assume,  their\r\n\r\nconstituents.   None of us speak for our constituents.   None\r\n\r\nof  us  do.   We are brought into this House by the electoral\r\n\r\nprocess, many of us unopposed.  My experience, four times.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  speak for my residents in Toa Payoh.  When I make  a\r\n\r\nspeech,  I  make  a  speech  which I  consider  will  benefit\r\n\r\nSingaporeans at large.  So this argument that we are speaking\r\n\r\non  behalf of our own constituents is a fiction, and must  be\r\n\r\nrecognised as a fiction.  And the moment we recognise it,  we\r\n\r\nmove  away from the fallacious argument that we are only here\r\n\r\nfor  our  constituents.  We stand here, after thinking  about\r\n\r\nour  speech, because we know that at the end of the day there\r\n\r\nis  a  chance that the speech will be reproduced in the media\r\n\r\nand   that  every  Singaporean,  whether  he  lives  in  your\r\n\r\nconstituency or not, is going to read you and assess you, and\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  going to take a view about your arguments.   So\r\n\r\nthis  is  not  a forum for espousing views peculiar  to  your\r\n\r\nconstituents; it is about Singapore.  And if a few additional\r\n\r\nbrains can come into this House to add breadth to the debate,\r\n\r\nwhy not?\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me end by turning to a point which I think Mr Leong\r\n\r\nand  Dr Tan made.  The strongest argument they have for doing\r\n\r\naway  with  the NMP scheme is the quality of the new  MPs  in\r\n\r\nthis  House.   I  accept that.  Their quality is  impeccable.\r\n\r\nWhy  do  we need NMPs when we have what Mr Leong has  called,\r\n\r\n\"the  magnificent 7\"?  Let me ask Members this.  Assume  that\r\n\r\ndespite the best efforts of the political leadership, none of\r\n\r\nthe seven agrees to join politics and come to this House.  We\r\n\r\nhave  seen  the quality of what they can say.  We  have  seen\r\n\r\nthem  speak, we have heard them speak, we know their quality.\r\n\r\nAssume that they refused to enter the political game and  did\r\n\r\nnot stand for elections.  Would we be better off if they came\r\n\r\nin  as  NMPs, or would we be better off without them in  this\r\n\r\nHouse?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to join in this debate.  I am speaking not in\r\n\r\nfavour of the motion to have Nominated MPs in this session of\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PM had earlier in the debate lifted the PAP's Whip\r\n\r\nand  allowed its Party Members to vote freely on this motion.\r\n\r\nThis  is  excellent.  Otherwise it is pointless  for  us  t/o\r\n\r\ncontinue  in the discussion.  If the Whip is not lifted,  the\r\n\r\n<br><br>82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members would have only the \"Yes\" button to press when it\r\n\r\ncomes  to voting.  This lifting of the Government Whip  gives\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  House  a  free  choice  to  exercise  their\r\n\r\nindividual beliefs and philosophy.  While I disagree with the\r\n\r\nPM on the Whip, I shall not debate it here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that is put before us now is whether there\r\n\r\nis  a  need  for  NMPs  in this First Session  of  the  Tenth\r\n\r\nParliament.  It is no longer a debate about the merits of the\r\n\r\nNMP  scheme anymore.  That has already been very well covered\r\n\r\nin  the last two Parliament sessions, and by Dr Tan, Dr Wang,\r\n\r\nMr Leong and Mr Davinder Singh earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of past NMPs has also shown that the\r\n\r\nscheme  works.  Times have changed, however.  What had worked\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  past does not mean that it will continue to work in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   The NMP scheme had worked in the past for two  main\r\n\r\nreasons.  First, the Special Select Committee did a good  job\r\n\r\nin  selecting  outspoken  but sensible  critics.   But,  more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  there was, in my opinion, a gap, a  niche  that\r\n\r\npast  NMPs  had fulfilled.  That niche is to generate  debate\r\n\r\nand critical evaluation of the Bills that were presented.  At\r\n\r\nmost,  MPs, again in my humble opinion, might have failed  to\r\n\r\nperform  effectively.  It could be due to  the  Whip  or  the\r\n\r\npresence  of  the  Whip, and the lack of consistency  between\r\n\r\nspeaking up against a policy and, yet, voting for it  at  the\r\n\r\nend   of  the  day.   There  are  probably  constraints   and\r\n\r\nrestraints  by the Party's internal rules that do  not  allow\r\n\r\nthem to vote against their Party leaders.  This was confirmed\r\n\r\nagain  by the Prime Minister earlier.  However, we have  also\r\n\r\nheard from the PM that the Government is prepared to lift its\r\n\r\nWhip  more  often.   This  will free the  current  batch,  as\r\n\r\ndiscussed, \"the magnificent 7\" and all the other 25  new  MPs\r\n\r\nto  be vigorous, to be more vigilant, in asking questions and\r\n\r\ndebating the important policies, as what we have seen in  the\r\n\r\nlast  five days.  And I believe the new and old MPs  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  do a good job, speaking what concerns their  heart.\r\n\r\nGiven  more  opportunities, there will  be  more  alternative\r\n\r\nviews to be presented in the months to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last four days, we have also heard many Members\r\n\r\ntalk about the scepticism and cynicism of youths towards  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   Sir,  it  is the youths who  are  sceptics  and\r\n\r\ncynics,  and they cannot vote.  So it does not mean that  the\r\n\r\n75%  of  the population who voted for the Government are  not\r\n\r\nsceptics.  Some of these youths have remarked to me that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment introduced the NMP scheme to drown out  the  voice\r\n\r\nof the Opposition MPs.  I do not see how that can be the case\r\n\r\nwhen  we are so out-numbered.  If there is a reason to  drown\r\n\r\nout, it will be the presence of the PAP MPs who speak against\r\n\r\nus that will drown us out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of the NMP scheme shows the failure of the\r\n\r\ngoverning Party MPs in speaking up and being critical.  To  a\r\n\r\ncertain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextent,  the impression of the public is that they  need  the\r\n\r\nNMPs  to  do the job for them because they cannot  do  it  as\r\n\r\nParty   members.   The  question  on  the   minds   of   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  including myself, is whether  the  Government,\r\n\r\nwhen  it  talks  about opening up society  and  engaging  the\r\n\r\nyoung, is for real.  The question asked is, if the Government\r\n\r\nis not prepared to open up its Party and allow its Members to\r\n\r\nspeak up and vote freely, how can it be genuine in wanting to\r\n\r\nopen  up  society?  Many Singaporeans are watching,  silently\r\n\r\nwaiting  and hoping that the Government's action  will  match\r\n\r\nits words.  Like a resident in Choa Chu Kang once remarked to\r\n\r\nme  in  Hokkien,  \"mai gong ka jue, zuo lai kua  sheng\".   He\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Do not talk so much.  Do and show me first.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best action for the Government to convince its\r\n\r\ncritics  and the many young cynics out there is to  free  its\r\n\r\nParty  Members completely from the constraints of  the  Whip.\r\n\r\nThe PM had said no to this permanent lifting of the Whip.   I\r\n\r\ndisagree, but that is a decision of the governing Party and I\r\n\r\nhave  no  say in it.  However, I hope that it can  be  proven\r\n\r\nthat  there is no need for more NMPs to come in to help  this\r\n\r\nfine team of MPs in the debates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already had NMPs for 10 to 12 years. Let us try\r\n\r\nfor  two years, for this Session of Parliament, without NMPs.\r\n\r\nIf,  at  the end of two years, the Government MPs,  ourselves\r\n\r\nincluded,  fail to do a good job in airing alternative  views\r\n\r\nor  constructive dissent, then let me be the one to move  the\r\n\r\nmotion to have NMPs at the Second Session of this Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I strongly believe that\r\n\r\nwe  must  seize  this opportunity to get rid of  the  growing\r\n\r\ncynicism in young Singaporeans.  We can do it by allowing the\r\n\r\nMPs  in  this  House  to  be  genuinely  critical.   This  is\r\n\r\nleadership  by example.  It will be the best way to  convince\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  that  the  Government  is  willing   to   stand\r\n\r\ncorrected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that we do without NMPs, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, as I sat there listening to the\r\n\r\nspeech of the NCMP, I take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  that he supports, in principle, the idea of the NMP, save\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  give  it some time  before  we  propose  to\r\n\r\nintroduce them into this House.  That is precisely the nature\r\n\r\nof  this debate now and I rise in support of the motion  that\r\n\r\nwe have NMPs in this present term of Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, five years ago, during my first term in Parliament,\r\n\r\nI  have  spoken  in support of the motion to bring  Nominated\r\n\r\nMembers into this House.  I am now into my second term of the\r\n\r\noffice  and  having  had the experience and  the  benefit  of\r\n\r\nengaging the Nominated Members in debates, I can say  that  I\r\n\r\nstand by my conviction that I believe that at the end of  the\r\n\r\nday,  NMPs do make a positive contribution to this House.   I\r\n\r\nremember  then when we debated on this issue,  Dr  Tan  Cheng\r\n\r\nBock  had  then said that I was still fresh, wet  behind  the\r\n\r\nears, still green and, that we would come back to look at the\r\n\r\nissue five years later and see whether I am still of the same\r\n\r\nview.  I hate to disappoint Dr Tan that unfortunately, I have\r\n\r\ncome  back  to say that, yes, we were right when we supported\r\n\r\nthe initial motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the underlying arguments against the introduction\r\n\r\nof the Nominated Members essentially run along three grounds.\r\n\r\nFirst,  they  lack  moral  standing  because  they  were  not\r\n\r\nelected.   They  did  not contest in an election,  therefore,\r\n\r\nbecause of the absence of a contest in an election, they have\r\n\r\nno  right  to  represent  the people  of  Singapore  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber.   Secondly,  the argument was made  that  there  are\r\n\r\nenough  avenues  existing in this country  to  allow  for  an\r\n\r\nexpression  of  dissenting opinions and  with  these  avenues\r\n\r\navailable,  there is really no need for Nominated Members  to\r\n\r\nthen come to this august Chamber to debate and participate in\r\n\r\npolicy  deliberation.  Of course, the final argument that  is\r\n\r\nmade  that  I see coming across is that in this new  climate,\r\n\r\nwith  the  partial lifting of the Whip, and the new batch  of\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament with sterling qualities in engaging the\r\n\r\nrest  of  the  House in eloquent debates, there is  really  a\r\n\r\nquestion  as to whether or not you need any more  Members  to\r\n\r\ncome in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  contribute  to the cacophony of sounds or  as  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister puts it, the symphony of music that we now  seek  to\r\n\r\ngenerate in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with my colleague, Mr Davinder Singh, that\r\n\r\nthe  issue  of  whether or not we want to bring in  Nominated\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament is not a live issue.  We have gone past\r\n\r\nthat.   The question that we have to ask ourselves is:  going\r\n\r\nforward,  how do you want to see the model of democracy,  and\r\n\r\nin  particular,  the nature of this House  evolving  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry?  I do not believe, Sir, that there is a single model\r\n\r\nof  democracy and as such, we should not be so restricted  by\r\n\r\nforms  and  our  fixed views as to what constitutes  it,  who\r\n\r\nshould have the legitimate right to sit in this House and  to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in the deliberations.  We have to ask  ourselves\r\n\r\nthis  basic question:  what exactly is it we want that is  in\r\n\r\nthe interest of Singapore?  I agree with my colleague earlier\r\n\r\nthat  in  looking at this question, we have to ask ourselves,\r\n\r\nlooking  at  the participation of the Nominated  Members,  is\r\n\r\nParliament  richer for it with the Nominated Members  present\r\n\r\nor  are  we poorer?  Is Singapore better off with or  without\r\n\r\nthe  presence of these Members?  My colleague has articulated\r\n\r\nthese views rather eloquently when he said that if we look at\r\n\r\nthe  past  instances of their contributions to  the  debates,\r\n\r\nwithout the presence of these Members, we would not have  had\r\n\r\nsuch  lively  debates,  we would not have  had  such  a  rich\r\n\r\ndiversity of views coming into this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may, Sir, I think we can look at this analogy. An\r\n\r\nargument that was made earlier is that we have had people  of\r\n\r\nvarious expertise and therefore, do we need any more of  such\r\n\r\npeople?  I think essentially, if an analogy can be made here,\r\n\r\nthe  question  is, you have a 2.1 mega pixel camera,  do  you\r\n\r\ntherefore  need a 3.1 mega pixel camera?  In  the  nature  of\r\n\r\nthings  and in the nature of human beings, if you can  settle\r\n\r\nfor  a 3.1 mega pixel camera, why settle for a 2.1 mega pixel\r\n\r\ncamera?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also the argument that they are not\r\n\r\nelected, and therefore, they have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno  right  to  speak for Singaporeans.  The argument  suffers\r\n\r\nfrom the flaw that only elected Members have the monopoly  to\r\n\r\nspeak  for  Singaporeans.  Let us not forget  that  Nominated\r\n\r\nMembers are also Singaporeans. We have to move away from  the\r\n\r\nrigid  mindset  that the elected forum should  only  comprise\r\n\r\nelected   Members   whose  sole  right  is   to   speak   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Nominated Members, being Singaporeans, also do\r\n\r\nenjoy  the legitimate right to speak for Singapore  and  they\r\n\r\nrepresent  the  interest  of  all  Singaporeans,   not   just\r\n\r\nconstituent  Singaporeans,  but  also  functional  groupings.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  if you look at the Nominated Members,  they  come\r\n\r\nacross  as being non-politically party partisan and  I  think\r\n\r\nthey perform a useful role here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, Sir, a Government for all the\r\n\r\npeople,  by  the people, is not premised on the functions  of\r\n\r\nthe  elected representative people alone.  The Government  of\r\n\r\nthe  people must be founded on a cornerstone on what is  best\r\n\r\nfor the people, and this must surely include listening to the\r\n\r\nvoice of the people in this land, including the voice of whom\r\n\r\nthe NMPs seek to represent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport of the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support it for three reasons. First, since the NMP\r\n\r\nscheme  was  introduced in 1989, the NMPs in each cohort  had\r\n\r\njustified the usefulness of this scheme.  By and large,  they\r\n\r\nhad  contributed  to  a lively debate and,  as  the  previous\r\n\r\nMembers  have  said,  to  our  constant  search  for   better\r\n\r\nsolutions to the many complex problems facing this country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a confession: when I was a political\r\n\r\ncorrespondent sitting up there in the Press Gallery, I  would\r\n\r\noften look forward to hearing some NMPs speak.  They included\r\n\r\nProf. Walter Woon and Dr Kanwaljit Soin and we know the  work\r\n\r\nthey  have  done  here.  Their views were  often  refreshing.\r\n\r\nThey added different dimensions to the issue being discussed.\r\n\r\nI think Parliament debates would have been the poorer if they\r\n\r\nhad not been present.  They\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neasily outshone the Opposition.  This is not to say that  the\r\n\r\nPAP MPs did not make refreshing speeches.  Many did.  But  as\r\n\r\nwe  have said so often, nobody enjoys a monopoly over wisdom.\r\n\r\nAnd the fact remains that some NMPs did add to the debate  in\r\n\r\nconstructive and meaningful ways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That conclusion, which I made when I was a journalist,\r\n\r\ndoes  not  change just because I have migrated  down  to  the\r\n\r\nChamber.  On the contrary, because I am a PAP MP, I  feel  it\r\n\r\nis  incumbent on me to support this scheme.  The PAP  is  the\r\n\r\ndominant  party in the House.  One reason it is  dominant  is\r\n\r\nbecause it is a party that is constantly evolving to stay  in\r\n\r\ntune with the times and that is always searching for ways  to\r\n\r\nsecure a better future for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep NMPs out, just because we, the elected MPs, came\r\n\r\nin  the  hard way, is to lose sight of the greater good.   We\r\n\r\nmust take the moral high ground that what is good for society\r\n\r\nmust   be  the  foremost  concern.   Nearly  every  political\r\n\r\nphilosopher,  from  Aristotle, Confucius to  Max  Weber,  has\r\n\r\nagreed  that the provision of a good or just society  is  the\r\n\r\nend  purpose of government.  We cannot always agree  on  what\r\n\r\ndefines a good society, but at the minimum, the people from a\r\n\r\nvery  wide spectrum society can all feel that they all get  a\r\n\r\nfair  hearing  here.  This gives a sense of legitimacy  to  a\r\n\r\ndynamic  and complex society.  This will also increase  their\r\n\r\nsense of belonging to the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I stood for elections last November, I said that\r\n\r\nthe younger generation wanted a greater say in policy-making,\r\n\r\nand  that  they  wanted  a more transparent  and  accountable\r\n\r\nsystem.   I  saw one of my roles as an MP as furthering  this\r\n\r\ncause.   This  brings me to the second reason for  supporting\r\n\r\nthis scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It opens the door for more Singaporeans, who are\r\n\r\ncredible,  to  have  a  greater say in policy-making  in  all\r\n\r\nareas,  and at the highest levels.  To that extent,  it  does\r\n\r\nmake for a more accountable and transparent system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, it was announced that the door will be opened\r\n\r\nwider to usher in a greater variety of groups.  The number of\r\n\r\nfunctional  groups  will be doubled  from  three  to  six  to\r\n\r\nreflect  a  wider  spectrum  of society.   Besides  business,\r\n\r\nunions    and   professional   groups,   they   now   include\r\n\r\nrepresentatives    from   social   and   community    service\r\n\r\norganisations,  as  well as the media, the  arts  and  sports\r\n\r\norganisations.  This is to be welcomed.  It encourages active\r\n\r\ncitizenship, which is one of our mantras in Singapore 21.  It\r\n\r\nalso  reflects our seriousness in remaking Singapore,  to  go\r\n\r\nbeyond  the 5Cs and to nurture our budding civil society,  as\r\n\r\nwell as the arts and the sports.  It would also send a signal\r\n\r\nthat this PAP-dominant Parliament is a dynamic and bold one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I was involved in two dialogues with two\r\n\r\nseparate  groups  of  young  Singaporeans.   One  group   was\r\n\r\nundergraduates, the other group was Secondary 3 and Secondary\r\n\r\n4   students  from  the  Gifted  Education  Programme.   Some\r\n\r\nstudents in both groups expressed scepticism about how  ready\r\n\r\nthe  PAP was to accommodate alternative views.  I pointed  to\r\n\r\nthe diverse slate of the PAP MPs, especially the new ones, as\r\n\r\na sign of PAP Government's openness to different views and to\r\n\r\nthe  easing  of the Party Whip.  I also pointed  to  the  NMP\r\n\r\nscheme  as another example.  This is not just a case  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment being open to alternative views.  This is  a  case\r\n\r\nof a Government going out of its way to consciously make room\r\n\r\nfor alternative views.  How many governments would initiate a\r\n\r\nscheme that allows non-elected MPs to speak up in Parliament,\r\n\r\nand even a non-elected Opposition Member to be here with us?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be a strong Government, confident of the ability\r\n\r\nof  its MPs to hold their own in the House as well as on  the\r\n\r\nground.  Therefore, the NMP scheme should not be seen  as  an\r\n\r\nindictment  on the quality of PAP MPs in the House.   On  the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  the  NMP  scheme is the by-product  of  the  PAP's\r\n\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason I support the NMP scheme is because it\r\n\r\ncould  help  to  increase  the  number  of  MPs  from  under-represented  groups,  such as women.  It  is  true  that  the\r\n\r\nnumber has increased in this latest batch to 10 - but we  are\r\n\r\nstill  under-represented.  It is a fact that we have  a  hard\r\n\r\ntime  finding good women to stand for elections.   It  exacts\r\n\r\nconsiderable  sacrifice in both their  personal,  family  and\r\n\r\nprofessional lives, as many of us have found out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my women colleagues here have expressed their\r\n\r\nworry  to  me  that this NMP scheme would only make  it  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  us to persuade women to stand for  elections.\r\n\r\nThis  scheme provides an easy alternative to be  here.   They\r\n\r\njust  pop up in Parliament, all nice and neat, make a  speech\r\n\r\nand  the  next day, they appear in the newspapers.   Whereas,\r\n\r\nthe  rest  of  us  have to slog it out on  the  ground,  hair\r\n\r\ndishevelled,  pumping hands, staying at MPS late  at  nights,\r\n\r\nattending countless grassroots meetings.  And for my  married\r\n\r\nwomen colleagues, they go home and they have also to meet the\r\n\r\nneeds  of their families.  Often, we do our best work as  MPs\r\n\r\nout of the limelight, championing the causes of our residents\r\n\r\nconscientiously.  Hence, the concern that, if given a  choice\r\n\r\nto  women, they would probably go for the NMP scheme than  to\r\n\r\njoin politics full-time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share this reservation. But I am also pragmatic.\r\n\r\nPolitics,  the  election  kind, is  still  seen  as  a  male-dominated  field in Singapore today.  Indeed,  I  have  heard\r\n\r\nreservations expressed that if a strong woman candidate  were\r\n\r\nto contest in a single seat against a weak male candidate, it\r\n\r\nis  very hard to say whether the female would win even though\r\n\r\nthe  merit  is  with  her,  even though  she  is  a  superior\r\n\r\ncandidate in all aspects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our society is still a patriarchal one, I am often\r\n\r\nreminded.   So,  given this patriarchal system  that  we  are\r\n\r\noperating  under today, I would say that if  the  NMP  scheme\r\n\r\nwill  help  bring in more women and for them to  share  their\r\n\r\nvaluable  perspectives with us, then let them in.  With  more\r\n\r\nfemale voices in Parliament, we can work better towards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  vision of a society where all citizens, including women,\r\n\r\nlive their lives experiencing justice and equality as a right\r\n\r\nand not by grace or favour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started my speech by saying that I supported the\r\n\r\nscheme because previous batches had proven its usefulness.  I\r\n\r\nwould  urge  the  Government to ensure that  the  quality  of\r\n\r\nfuture  NMPs is not compromised even as it widens the  groups\r\n\r\nto  be represented here.  Presently, the selection process is\r\n\r\nnot  transparent.   Can  the  Minister  assure  us  that  the\r\n\r\nselection process is rigorous enough?  We must keep high  the\r\n\r\nentry bar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, the usefulness of the scheme\r\n\r\ndepends   on  the  quality  of  the  NMPs.   They   must   be\r\n\r\nintellectually honest, pro-Singapore and offer  useful  views\r\n\r\nthat will make for a better Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that we have this debate, if only to remind\r\n\r\nthe  NMPs that if and when they sit among us, it is  only  at\r\n\r\nthe  pleasure  of  a  strong Government  and  the  individual\r\n\r\nelected MPs in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I urge my fellow MPs to vote for the\r\n\r\nmotion alongside with me.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, thank\r\n\r\nyou  for  allowing me the opportunity to participate in  this\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was listening to Dr Tan Cheng Bock, I was very\r\n\r\ndisturbed  to realise that I am actually a major obstacle  to\r\n\r\nthe  NMP  scheme  because he said we  should  not  have  them\r\n\r\nbecause  we have lawyers - I am a lawyer. We should not  have\r\n\r\nthem  because now we have more women - I am a woman.  And  we\r\n\r\nshould  not have them because we have more singles  -  guilty\r\n\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very disturbed, particularly, Mr Speaker, because\r\n\r\nI  am going to support the motion.  Also because when Dr  Tan\r\n\r\ndescribed  the degree of hassle and the heat of  battle  that\r\n\r\none has to go through in elections, I was actually privileged\r\n\r\nto  see  him  in action, because I was assigned to understudy\r\n\r\nhim during the elections at Ayer Rajah.   I must say that  is\r\n\r\nwhy it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngives me a certain degree of grief to be disagreeing with  Dr\r\n\r\nTan, because, in many respects, I regard him as my si fu.  Si\r\n\r\nfu,  te  pui  chi,  but  this unworthy student  is  about  to\r\n\r\ndisagree with you.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that we do need to have NMPs in order to have\r\n\r\nalternative   views   in  Parliament.    And   when   I   say\r\n\r\n\"alternative\", I mean alternative here to the PAP.   We  have\r\n\r\n<br><br>85&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of Parliament, out of which 82 are PAP and only  3\r\n\r\nare  Opposition  MPs.   If  we had  more  Opposition  MPs  in\r\n\r\nParliament, my view might well be different.  But because  we\r\n\r\nare such an overwhelming majority, I do think it is necessary\r\n\r\nfor us to have alternative views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three arguments have been made as to why we should not\r\n\r\nhave  NMPs.  The first is because, or as the allegation goes,\r\n\r\nthe Whip will be lifted, which will encourage more debate and\r\n\r\ntherefore  we  do  not  need NMPs.  It  is  true  that  every\r\n\r\nBackbencher who sits here understands the need to speak up in\r\n\r\naccordance  with our conscience.  But there is  a  difference\r\n\r\nbetween  speaking up and voting, and in some cases  the  Whip\r\n\r\nwill  not be lifted.  So there is some value still in  having\r\n\r\nNMPs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, no matter what we say, in the eyes of the\r\n\r\npublic,  we  are  still  such  an  overwhelming  majority  in\r\n\r\nParliament  that  we have 82 Members of  the  same  party,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  for the public, it is important for them to know  and\r\n\r\nunderstand  that there are alternative views, and that  these\r\n\r\nalternative  views  can  be aired  in  Parliament.   Make  no\r\n\r\nmistake, I do not make any apology whatsoever for being  part\r\n\r\nof  the  majority in Parliament.  I think it is in the nature\r\n\r\nof  parliamentary democracy, especially party-based politics,\r\n\r\nthat every party tries its best to get as many of its members\r\n\r\nas  possible into Parliament.  So I make no apology for being\r\n\r\npart  of  the  majority.  But if you are a  majority,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to hear from others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the NMPs agree with Government policies, so much the\r\n\r\nbetter,  because it means that there are people,  other  than\r\n\r\nparty affiliated MPs, who agree with Government policies.  If\r\n\r\nthe NMPs do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagree with Government policies, so be it.  At least, we  have\r\n\r\nheard from another voice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second argument is that we do not need NMPs because\r\n\r\nwe  have such good quality Backbenchers, especially this  new\r\n\r\nbatch.  Thank you, on behalf of all the new MPs who have come\r\n\r\nin.  We may be good but I do not think we are that good, that\r\n\r\nwe  are able to cover the entire spectrum of views.  I  think\r\n\r\nthere  is  always room for alternative views  from  different\r\n\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third argument is that NMPs are not elected and they\r\n\r\ntherefore do not have the mandate of the electorate.  That is\r\n\r\ntrue,  but  they will not be here as representatives  of  the\r\n\r\nelectorate.   They will be here, if they are invited  in,  as\r\n\r\npeople  who  provide alternative views.  And as  long  as  we\r\n\r\nunderstand  that, I think it does not matter that  they  have\r\n\r\nnot been elected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia said that the success of the NMP scheme\r\n\r\nshows  the failure of the PAP MPs.  I do not agree with that.\r\n\r\nI do not think there is any other government in the world who\r\n\r\nactually  takes steps to invite people that are not of  their\r\n\r\nparty to come into Parliament and give alternative views.  So\r\n\r\nI think the success of the NMP scheme is an indication of the\r\n\r\nwillingness  of  this  Government  and  this  party  to  hear\r\n\r\nalternative views and to try its best to solicit from as many\r\n\r\nareas as possible ideas that are good for Singapore.  So, the\r\n\r\ncrux  of  the matter really, as I see it, is that we  are  an\r\n\r\noverwhelming majority.  We do need to hear alternative  views\r\n\r\nand I therefore support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\ninitially,  I  did not intend to speak on the issue,  because\r\n\r\nthe  stand  of  the Workers' Party is clear.  We  oppose  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of NMPs in Parliament.  It is not  my  habit  to\r\n\r\nrepeat  what  I  have  said and argued,  as  they  have  been\r\n\r\nrecorded in the Hansard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, when I revisited the speech made by the\r\n\r\nthen First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Goh Chok Tong, on the rationale of the introduction of the\r\n\r\nNMP  scheme,  I  find that there are some interesting  points\r\n\r\nworth  for the House to recall and consider before the  House\r\n\r\ndecides  whether  there  should  be  NMPs  in  this  term  of\r\n\r\nParliament.  The MP for Bishan-Toa Payoh, Mr Davinder  Singh,\r\n\r\njust now said that perhaps we should look at whether there is\r\n\r\nanything wrong with the NMP scheme in the past 10 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we should look at another perspective, ie,\r\n\r\nwhether  the NMP scheme has achieved its original objectives.\r\n\r\nFirst  of all, let me quote Mr Goh, Prime Minister,  in  1989\r\n\r\n[Hansard, 29th November 1989, Vol. 54, col. 695], he said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The aim of this Bill is to further strengthen our\r\n\r\npolitical  system by offering Singaporeans more opportunities\r\n\r\nfor political participation  .'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,  has our political system been strengthened in the  past\r\n\r\n10  years  with  NMPs  in  this  House?   Has  the  political\r\n\r\nparticipation of Singaporeans increased?  Strangely, Sir,  10\r\n\r\nyears  after  the  introduction  of  NMPs  to  generate  more\r\n\r\npolitical participation, we are still hearing in the last few\r\n\r\ndays   about   how   the  Government  should   involve   more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans in the remaking of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, according to Mr Goh, Prime Minister, the need\r\n\r\nto  introduce  NMPs is because the Opposition is  inadequate.\r\n\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'After nearly one year's experience, the feedback is\r\n\r\nthat  the  two of them, ie, the two Opposition  MPs,  do  not\r\n\r\nadequately express significant alternative views held outside\r\n\r\nthis Chamber.'  [Vol. 54, col. 698].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He further added:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In 1984, despite a sharp drop in national support for\r\n\r\nthe  PAP,  a  drop of 13%, the PAP lost only two  seats.   In\r\n\r\n1988, though the support level went down by 1% from 1984, the\r\n\r\nPAP  lost only one seat.  In fact, it recovered one from  the\r\n\r\ntwo  opposition seats which it lost in 1984.'  [Vol. 54, col.\r\n\r\n704].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Prime Minister conveniently forgot that the\r\n\r\nprimary  reason why the PAP was able to win back the seat  it\r\n\r\nlost  in  1984  was  because Anson Constituency  held  by  my\r\n\r\nparty's former Secretary-General was redrawn into Tiong Bahru\r\n\r\nGRC.  As a result, when I stood for my first\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelection  there,  my  team, all new faces,  had  to  face  an\r\n\r\nincumbent veteran MP, Mr Chng Jit Koon, who had been  the  MP\r\n\r\nfor  Tiong  Bahru  for  20 years.  I  believe  if  Anson  had\r\n\r\nremained as a single seat constituency, the result could have\r\n\r\nbeen  different.  Sir, for your information, Anson  today  is\r\n\r\npart of Tanjong Pagar GRC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the PAP has found that the political system is not\r\n\r\nideal  and  that there is a need to strengthen the  political\r\n\r\nsystem,  I  wonder  why  the PAP did not  face  this  problem\r\n\r\nsquarely,  as  it did with most problems, instead  of  having\r\n\r\nNMPs.  Is it because the PAP does not consider the Opposition\r\n\r\nas  part of the political system?  I also wonder why the  PAP\r\n\r\ndid  not  find  problems with the political system  and  take\r\n\r\nissue  with  the lack of participation prior  to  1984,  when\r\n\r\nthere  was no Opposition in this House at all?  Why was there\r\n\r\nthis  sudden  wake-up call in wanting participation  and  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of the NMP scheme after 1988 when  there  was  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial vote swing against the PAP?  Sir, I do  not  have\r\n\r\nanswers  to  these questions.  I leave it to Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nanswer and to judge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason for introducing the NMP scheme is that\r\n\r\nthe NMP is politically non-partisan.  Mr Goh said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Nominated MPs are not Government MPs either. They\r\n\r\nshould and will be people who will vote as they think right.'\r\n\r\n[Vol. 54, col. 700].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I find that most of the NMPs voted with the PAP all\r\n\r\nthese  years.   Of  course, we have heard that  it  does  not\r\n\r\nmatter if they vote for the PAP.  But what was the purpose of\r\n\r\nintroducing  NMPs?  Yes, they have their views and  they  can\r\n\r\nexpress their views eloquently, but I find that most  of  the\r\n\r\nviews  they  expressed were similar to the PAP's  views,  but\r\n\r\nexpressed  in  different style.  So I doubt whether  the  NMP\r\n\r\nscheme has achieved its non-partisan objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I do find that the NMPs have one useful\r\n\r\nrole  to  play, ie, because they are not PAP MPs,  when  they\r\n\r\ncriticise  or  attack the Opposition, they would  sound  more\r\n\r\nconvincing and would be more receptive to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh, the then First Deputy Prime Minister, also\r\n\r\nrevealed interesting workings of the PAP.  He said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'PAP MPs often vote on issues, but this is done in\r\n\r\nclosed-door  party meetings.  Once a vote is  taken  and  the\r\n\r\ndecision  made,  they are expected to abide by  the  majority\r\n\r\ndecision.'  [Vol. 54, cols. 698-99].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems to me that the real Parliament is actually\r\n\r\nbehind  the  PAP's closed-door meetings.  And the problem  is\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  not allowed to vote against  the  Government\r\n\r\nunless the Whip is lifted, and this is one of the reasons for\r\n\r\nbringing in NMPs who could vote freely to show dissent.  Sir,\r\n\r\nnow  that the Prime Minister has decided to lift the Whip   - I do not know  - but just now he said maybe not.  So I do not\r\n\r\nknow  whether the Whip is lifted or not lifted, not  only  on\r\n\r\nthis  NMP issue but for other issues for enlightened  debate.\r\n\r\nIf  that  is the case, is there a need for NMPs to  show  the\r\n\r\npublic that there is indeed sufficient dissent in Parliament?\r\n\r\nSir, the essence of parliamentary democracy, I understand, is\r\n\r\nrepresentation  of the people in the decision making  process\r\n\r\nand  accountability.  I am quite surprised to hear  Mr  Singh\r\n\r\nsay  that he does not represent a constituency.  Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nPAP  wants to explain to us their thinking and how they  feel\r\n\r\nabout  the  political system such that  they  can  walk  into\r\n\r\nParliament  without  being elected.   Anyway,  I  think  they\r\n\r\nshould go through the political system.  My understanding  is\r\n\r\nthat  Parliament is the highest decision making body  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.   So it is essential that those who are  present  in\r\n\r\nParliament  participate  in the decision  making  process  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the people and be accountable to them.  I think  it\r\n\r\nis  not simply a question of having their views, as what some\r\n\r\nMembers have said.  We can have their views, yes, but I think\r\n\r\nwe  are  here  not only to express our views.   We  are  here\r\n\r\nrepresenting the people and making decisions on their behalf.\r\n\r\nWe  must have some basis for representing the people and,  to\r\n\r\nme,   \"representing  the  people\"  means  going  through  the\r\n\r\nelection  process.  If  not,  how  do  you  claim   you   are\r\n\r\nrepresenting  someone?   It  has got  to  be  some  electoral\r\n\r\nprocess that you have gone through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government is sincere in wanting\r\n\r\nparticipation  from  the people, wanting Singaporeans  to  be\r\n\r\nconcerned about the country and wanting Singaporeans to  take\r\n\r\nownership, and thereby feel that they are rooted here, and it\r\n\r\nis  our  home,  I  think it is time that it  should  consider\r\n\r\nseriously  either a proportional representation system  or  a\r\n\r\nhybrid   system   of  first-past-the-post  and   proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation system.  Is the PAP open enough for the  idea?\r\n\r\nOr  we just shut the door immediately and say that the change\r\n\r\nis  too  radical  and will weaken the Government  and  social\r\n\r\nstructure, etc, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us wait and see.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, imagine the nine Nominated MPs\r\n\r\nare  now in Parliament, and we have heard our debates for the\r\n\r\nlast  five days, and 61 speakers have spoken, do our  Members\r\n\r\nhere want to hear another nine Nominated MPs speak up?  I  do\r\n\r\nnot think so.  They cannot contribute anything else.  Most of\r\n\r\nthe  points  would  have been already covered,  and  I  would\r\n\r\nimagine  more eloquently than if the nine Nominated MPs  were\r\n\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally think that circumstances have changed. I\r\n\r\nhave been here 18 years and I can see this particular session\r\n\r\nthat  we  have just had is completely different from  what  I\r\n\r\nhave  seen  before in this Parliament.  The debates  are  not\r\n\r\nonly lively but of very high quality.  In fact, today we have\r\n\r\nseen  PAP  MPs  debating vigorously against another  PAP  MP,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  a very, very rare thing to see in this House.   So\r\n\r\nthings  will change with this Tenth Parliament, and  I  think\r\n\r\nfor this particular Tenth Parliament we certainly do not need\r\n\r\nnine  more  Nominated  MPs.  I do not think  they  will  make\r\n\r\nParliament debates richer or of higher quality, which I think\r\n\r\nwe already have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Dr Tan, who feels very strongly against NMPs\r\n\r\nbecause  he  says that he has to fight through  the  election\r\n\r\nhustings  to get into Parliament, whereas NMPs just  walk  in\r\n\r\nthrough the backdoor without\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npaying  the  price, well, I do not feel as  strongly  as  him\r\n\r\nalthough  I fought a hard, vigorous election.  But my  reason\r\n\r\nfor  objecting  to having NMPs in this House is  not  because\r\n\r\nthey do not pay a price for it but because it undermines  the\r\n\r\nvery  system  that we believe in, and that  is  a  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem.    In   some  countries,  they  do  not  call   their\r\n\r\nlegislatures   \"Parliament\";  they  call   them   \"House   of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives\"  -  that is what made our  legislature  here\r\n\r\ndemocratic.    Because   we   are  representatives   of   our\r\n\r\nconstituents, we are elected by them.  As for NMPs, they  are\r\n\r\nnot representatives.  They represent only themselves or, more\r\n\r\nlikely, represent the ruling party that selected them and put\r\n\r\nthem in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever Mr Davinder says, I still believe that we\r\n\r\nrepresent  our  constituents,  and  the  people  want   their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  in Parliament.  That was clearly  proven  by\r\n\r\none  NMP  who was highlighted in the papers.  He had  a  high\r\n\r\nprofile,  and he thought he could win easily at an  election.\r\n\r\nHe went to have a try - I think it was at Chua Chu Kang - and\r\n\r\nhe  just  got off by the skin of his teeth in not having  his\r\n\r\ndeposit  forfeited.  I think he obtained only 14%.   So  what\r\n\r\ndoes that tell us?  That tells us that the voters do not want\r\n\r\nan  NMP, although he had performed so well in Parliament.  He\r\n\r\nwas  rejected outright.  Singaporeans do not want Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament who are not voted by the constituents.  That was a\r\n\r\nvery,  very clear signal that the people do not want MPs  who\r\n\r\nare not elected by them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right from the start, from 1989, I disagreed with this\r\n\r\nscheme  because  I  think that the real reason  for  the  PAP\r\n\r\nwanting NMPs is part of its election strategy.  They want the\r\n\r\nNMPs to dilute the Opposition in Parliament, and I think they\r\n\r\nalso  read the ground rightly that people do want the PAP  to\r\n\r\nrule  them  but, at the same time, they still want Opposition\r\n\r\nvoices  in  Parliament.  So they say,  \"All  right.   PAP  is\r\n\r\nruling,  and at the same time we provide you with  Opposition\r\n\r\nvoices in the form of NMPs.\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the NMP scheme was announced, the NMPs were\r\n\r\nsupposed not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   take  sides,  either  with  the  ruling  party  or   the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  They were supposed to be the third voice, to  be\r\n\r\non  neutral ground.  But I have said before, there is no such\r\n\r\nthing  as a third voice, or neutral.  Either you are  for  or\r\n\r\nagainst an issue.  The other day we heard that the person who\r\n\r\nstands in the middle of the road gets run down by a motorcar.\r\n\r\nAnd  during the time of the cold war, some nations sided  the\r\n\r\nSoviet  Union and others sided the US and the west, but  some\r\n\r\nAsian  countries  conveniently said that they  were  neutral.\r\n\r\nAnd the one time Secretary of State of the United States,  Mr\r\n\r\nDulles,  said,  \"neutrality is immoral\".   If  neutrality  is\r\n\r\nreally immoral, then there is no place for NMPs in Parliament\r\n\r\nbecause  they cannot take the neutral ground or be the  third\r\n\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have debated for five days on the remaking of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It would appear that the Government  hopes  that\r\n\r\nthings  will  change, Singapore would open up a  bit,  people\r\n\r\nwill  speak up, entrepreneurs will be bred and help Singapore\r\n\r\nout.   But  this  NMP scheme is not in sync with  this  whole\r\n\r\nconcept of the new Singapore.  NMPs are, firstly, not elected\r\n\r\nMPs;  they  do not have to win the battles to have their  own\r\n\r\nright to be in Parliament; they are appointed.  We are  in  a\r\n\r\nway  going  back  to the authoritarian style  -  appointments\r\n\r\nrather  than  open up and be democratic.   I  think  the  NMP\r\n\r\nscheme  does not fit in with the times.  Times have  changed.\r\n\r\nWe  are going to see a new Parliament and it is going  to  be\r\n\r\nchanged.  As the Government has said, they are going to  lift\r\n\r\nthe  Whip more often and, I think, circumstances have changed\r\n\r\nand therefore it will be for the greater good of Singapore if\r\n\r\nthere were no NMPs in Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Raymond Lim also argued that today NMPs are here for\r\n\r\nthe  national interest.  I can say that they are not for  the\r\n\r\nnational interest for the simple reason that they will  erode\r\n\r\nour  belief in democracy, in representation, because they  do\r\n\r\nnot  represent anyone.  And if you erode democracy  and  make\r\n\r\npeople think that you do not need to elect your MPs, let  the\r\n\r\nGovernment appoint them, it is going to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  wrong signal sent to the people of Singapore, and I do not\r\n\r\nthink that it is good for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the contributions of Prof. Walter Woon in\r\n\r\ninitiating the Maintenance of Parents Act, actually,  to  me,\r\n\r\nas  a nation, I think we should not have this Act at all.  He\r\n\r\nthinks  it  is  good; but I think it is bad.   What  sort  of\r\n\r\nsociety  will  we become when the parents have to  sue  their\r\n\r\nchildren  to get maintenance?  I think in Israel and England,\r\n\r\nthey  have  this  Act,  but after a while  people  became  so\r\n\r\nshameful  about  the whole thing that that Act  just  died  a\r\n\r\nnatural  death.  I hope the Maintenance of Parents  Act  will\r\n\r\nalso  die  a natural death.  [Interruptions].  I suppose  you\r\n\r\nare  waiting for the next NMP to do it.  [Interruptions].   I\r\n\r\nsaid \"you\", not me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Davinder Singh has said that the quality of new MPs\r\n\r\nis impeccable, and I entirely agree with him.  In fact, these\r\n\r\nfew  days, I look forward to hearing many of them speak.   So\r\n\r\nif  we  have such good quality elected MPs, I certainly think\r\n\r\nwe  can leave NMPs out this round.  I think they will just be\r\n\r\nredundant, occupying unnecessary spaces here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I end, I call for a division on this motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davinder Singh:</b> Mr Speaker, may I have your\r\n\r\npermission to raise a point by way of clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Chiam See Tong have both\r\n\r\nmisunderstood  the point I made.  I did not say,  as  Mr  Low\r\n\r\nclaims, that I do not want to represent the residents of  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh and I did not say, as Mr Chiam claims, that we are  not\r\n\r\nhere  because  we  were not elected by the residents  of  our\r\n\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is a different one. My point is that when you\r\n\r\nstand up and make a speech in this House, you are accountable\r\n\r\nnot  only  to  your constituents, but you are accountable  to\r\n\r\nevery  single Singaporean.  You are accountable to  yourself,\r\n\r\nto  your  family  and  to every single Singaporean.   So  the\r\n\r\nproposition   that   you  are  only   accountable   to   your\r\n\r\nconstituents and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntherefore only elected Members should sit in this House is  a\r\n\r\nfiction.   Accountability is to everybody.  And  in  the  way\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  Low and Mr Chiam spoke about this motion, Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Low  did  not speak on behalf of  the  residents  of\r\n\r\nHougang  and  Potong Pasir in rejecting  this  motion.   They\r\n\r\nspoke,  I believe, in what they considered to be in the  best\r\n\r\ninterest  of  all Singaporeans when they speak  against  that\r\n\r\nmotion, not your residents only.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Yes, but you did say the\r\n\r\n\"next  NMP\"  which  suggests that you are in  favour  of  the\r\n\r\nscheme.   And I have to say that I have to address Mr Chiam's\r\n\r\nvery  serious  point  about Nominated Members  of  Parliament\r\n\r\nundermining the system of democracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think anyone with even a casual\r\n\r\nknowledge of democracy and models of democracy would  realise\r\n\r\nthat  in Westminster, for example, we have the House of Lords\r\n\r\nwhich  comprises non-elected Members and, in  fact,  they  do\r\n\r\nhave even non-partisan members sitting in which they call the\r\n\r\ncross-benchers.  So the notion of Nominated MPs, as it  were,\r\n\r\nis not unknown to the world of democratic governments.  So we\r\n\r\nhave  to  say  that  these two arguments would  not  wash  in\r\n\r\nrelation to whether we should have NMPs or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may address the motion. I have to say that\r\n\r\nwhen  I  first came to Parliament in 1997, I recall listening\r\n\r\nto the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neloquent speech of the hon. Member for Ayer Rajah against the\r\n\r\nNMP scheme.  And I remember, with some trepidation, how I  am\r\n\r\ngoing  to be able to match such eloquence, or even come close\r\n\r\nto  such eloquence.  I remember, in particular, the array  of\r\n\r\nreasons  he gave as to why we should not have such a  scheme.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  took  the  liberty to list them  out  and,  strangely\r\n\r\nenough, they also comprise the \"magnificent seven\" reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may digress a bit, Mr Speaker, when some Members of\r\n\r\nthis  House referred to our new MPs, the \"magnificent seven\",\r\n\r\nI  have  to say that, if I remember the movie The Magnificent\r\n\r\nSeven correctly and the Japanese version of Seven Samurai,  I\r\n\r\nthink  at the end of the film, only two survived.  So  may  I\r\n\r\nwish  the  magnificent seven good luck and may the  best  man\r\n\r\nwin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us turn to Dr Tan's seven magnificent reasons. May\r\n\r\nI  be  so  bold as to take out the rhetoric and the eloquence\r\n\r\nand  just  take them for what they are.  First, he said  that\r\n\r\nthe  NMPs  are  not risk-takers.  Second, that they  come  in\r\n\r\nthrough  the  back  door  without having  to  go  through  an\r\n\r\nelection.  Third, they seldom, if ever, raise issues that are\r\n\r\nnot  already  raised by the elected MPs.  Fourth,  that  they\r\n\r\nrepresent  no constituency and know very little, if anything,\r\n\r\nabout the feelings and views of the people.  Fifth, there  is\r\n\r\nample  supply of lawyers, accountants, doctors and we do  not\r\n\r\nneed more of them in this House.  And, sixth, that the couple\r\n\r\nwho did well, Prof. Walter Woon and Dr Kanwaljit Soin, cannot\r\n\r\nbe  taken  as  evidence of the success of the scheme,  and  I\r\n\r\nremember the hon. Member saying that two swallows do not make\r\n\r\na  summer.  Finally, the seventh argument is that,  which  he\r\n\r\nmentioned again just now, there may be difficulty in choosing\r\n\r\nthe  right  NMPs,  or,  for that matter,  ensuring  that  the\r\n\r\nvarious interest groups are represented, or vice versa,  that\r\n\r\nextremists may find their way in through such a scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these magnificent seven reasons which I think\r\n\r\nwe  must  try  to rebut if we want to support the  scheme,  I\r\n\r\nthink Mr Leong referred to the idea of shelf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspace and that as NMPs are not bound by the Party Whip,  they\r\n\r\nare   often  given  much  better  coverage,  make  a   better\r\n\r\nimpression  on  the media, than the elected  MPs;   in  other\r\n\r\nwords, they make the elected MPs look dull, ordinary and even\r\n\r\nboring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are very powerful arguments indeed and they\r\n\r\nhave to be taken into account.  However, I have to say that I\r\n\r\nhave great personal discomfort in having to disagree with the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  for  Ayer Rajah and state  why  I  support  the\r\n\r\nscheme.  First of all, we must be clear why the NMP scheme is\r\n\r\nof  such value to the House.  To be clear about that, let  us\r\n\r\nfirst  look  at what the elected Members are here  for.   The\r\n\r\nelected  Members  represent their party in  the  House,  both\r\n\r\nOpposition as well as the PAP.  We are elected on the party's\r\n\r\nmanifesto,  with promises made to the party as  to  what  the\r\n\r\nvoters can expect if they voted for us, the candidates of the\r\n\r\nparty.   That is also the reason why we have the  Party  Whip\r\n\r\nbecause it is necessary to keep party discipline in the House\r\n\r\nso as to make good on election promises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are elected on this basis, we must in\r\n\r\ngeneral   believe   in  supporting  the  party's   programme.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, we might as well run as independents or  apply  to\r\n\r\nbe  NMPs.  Given that this is the case, I think it will be on\r\n\r\nvery  rare  occasions when the Whip is lifted,  or  on  where\r\n\r\npersonal  conscience dictates, that we, PAP  MPs,  would  not\r\n\r\nsupport   a  piece  of  legislation  proposed  by   the   PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment, especially when it is attempting to carry out the\r\n\r\nprogramme  promised  to the people.   And  if  PAP  MPs  make\r\n\r\nspeeches  in  support  which  are  then  not  given  as  much\r\n\r\nprominence as the NMPs who project a different point of view,\r\n\r\nI do not think we need to feel apologetic.  That is something\r\n\r\nwhich  we should expect the media to do, even though  we  may\r\n\r\nnot  agree  with  it.  The Minister's speech supporting  such\r\n\r\nlegislation is usually taken to state the policies  for  such\r\n\r\nlegislation and the MPs' speeches in support are just seen as\r\n\r\nexcess  baggage, no matter how interesting the  speech  might\r\n\r\notherwise have been.  We can only hope to persuade the  media\r\n\r\nto  give us more attention, or as much attention as they give\r\n\r\nto the NMPs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the NMPs, the NMP scheme is intended to\r\n\r\nadd  value  to  the debate precisely because they  offer  the\r\n\r\nopportunity for non-partisan voices to be heard.   In  answer\r\n\r\nto  Mr  Chiam, it is not really wrong for NMPs to agree  with\r\n\r\nthe  Government if they have good reasons for doing so.   The\r\n\r\npoint is that they are not bound by Party Whip, that they can\r\n\r\nexpress their personal opinions as to what they think is  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  such  legislation.  So it is  not  that  they  are\r\n\r\nsitting  on the fence if they agree or disagree.   They  will\r\n\r\ntake a position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I do think that NMPs take risks when they decide to\r\n\r\nput  themselves up for Parliament.  I remember saying  so  to\r\n\r\nProf. Walter Woon, who was a colleague of mine at the Faculty\r\n\r\nof  Law, when he came to talk to me about his intention to be\r\n\r\nput  up  as  an NMP.  I remember telling him that the  public\r\n\r\nwould  scrutinise  him  and  that he  would  definitely  lose\r\n\r\nprivacy and that, as an NMP, as any MP, he would run the risk\r\n\r\nof  looking ridiculous in public if he were to come  up  with\r\n\r\nquirky  ideas.   He had not.  But we have on  occasions  seen\r\n\r\nNMPs  coming  up with strange ideas.  But the point  is  that\r\n\r\nthey  take  individual responsibility  for  their  views  and\r\n\r\nindeed  can be said to be at more risks because they  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  party  support.  And as for not having a  feel  of  the\r\n\r\nground,  sometimes, not always, I think that is  a  strength.\r\n\r\nNMPs can concentrate on the merits of legislation instead  of\r\n\r\nbeing  preoccupied with the political consequences which  may\r\n\r\nimpact adversely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said of the Maintenance of Parents Bill,\r\n\r\nwhich  Prof.  Walter Woon introduced, and  Mr  Chiam  himself\r\n\r\npointed out that there were some fierce adverse comments from\r\n\r\nMembers of this House as well as from certain sectors of  the\r\n\r\npublic.  But, as an NMP, he can afford to do so because he is\r\n\r\nresponsible  only  for his views, he is himself,  but  he  is\r\n\r\nacting in the interest of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NMPs also take an Oath of Allegiance to the Constitution\r\n\r\nand  to  the people of Singapore to serve Singapore.  We  can\r\n\r\nexpect them to give off their best and, if they do not,  then\r\n\r\nit is quite obvious what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsequences will occur.  But the success or failure  of  the\r\n\r\nscheme  depends  very much on the quality of  the  candidates\r\n\r\nwilling to put themselves up for this.  Here, I would put  it\r\n\r\nthis  way.   For example, it is a common perception  of  many\r\n\r\nthat those who entered the Miss Singapore competition may not\r\n\r\nbe   the  most  beautiful,  charming  or  eloquent  women  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  There are many we know who prefer not to  display\r\n\r\ntheir beauty and brains in competition.  In the same way,  if\r\n\r\nour  most  intelligent, independent and  non-political  minds\r\n\r\nwere not persuaded to come forward to participate in the  NMP\r\n\r\nscheme, then it would be time to re-examine the scheme.  But,\r\n\r\nas  of  now,  I  would agree entirely with  my  Parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Mr Davinder Singh, that the time has  passed  for\r\n\r\nquestioning whether on principle such a scheme is correct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme has produced excellent MPs who have added\r\n\r\nmuch  value  to the debates in this House and we  should,  in\r\n\r\nthis  Parliament, continue to support the scheme so  long  as\r\n\r\nthere  are  good people who can contribute their non-partisan\r\n\r\nviews  publicly.  Their non-partisan support  for  Government\r\n\r\npolicies  and legislation will be reassuring to Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  they do object to legislation, then Ministers  would\r\n\r\nhave  to take that into account.  All in all, I believe  very\r\n\r\nstrongly  that  it  can only improve the general  quality  of\r\n\r\nParliament  and Government in Singapore.  And  to  borrow  an\r\n\r\nanalogy  from Dr Wang Kai Yuen, if we can have a rose garden,\r\n\r\nwhy  not have different types of roses, rather than just  red\r\n\r\nroses  or  white roses.  Why not have yellow roses also?   It\r\n\r\nmakes for a nicer garden.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): To put it frankly,\r\n\r\njust as Dr Tan Cheng Bock has said, we, the elected MPs, have\r\n\r\ncome  in  from  the  main door.  We have  gone  through  very\r\n\r\nvigorous   battles  and  had  to  fight  off  the  Opposition\r\n\r\ncandidates  to  win our rights to represent our  constituents\r\n\r\nhere.  Put it in a more dramatic way, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  like what the Chinese classics would describe,  guo  wu\r\n\r\nguan,  zhan  liu jiang - crossing five strategic  passes  and\r\n\r\nslaughtering  six generals. On the other hand, our  Nominated\r\n\r\nMPs  were  carried  in on sedan chairs.   They  need  not  go\r\n\r\nthrough the battles.  Honestly, seeing them coming in in such\r\n\r\na  glamourous and easy manner, if you say you are not envious\r\n\r\nand  feel  like banging your chest, I think you are  probably\r\n\r\nnot telling the truth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have to think very seriously about it. What\r\n\r\ncontributions  have  Nominated MPs made to  Parliament?   Are\r\n\r\nthey hua she tian zu (draw a snake and add feet to it) or jin\r\n\r\nshang tian hua (add flowers to the brocade)?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is to add something to the existing system like\r\n\r\nadding  feet  to the snake, it is like what the Hokkien  will\r\n\r\nsay:  \"kay kiang\" - pretending to be smart.  Having  drawn  a\r\n\r\nsnake,  why would you want to add some legs to it?   You  are\r\n\r\ndoing  something superfluous. But, if it is  jin  shang  tian\r\n\r\nhua,  that  you  are adding flowers to a beautiful  piece  of\r\n\r\nbrocade,  we  are  making  it even more  beautiful  with  3-D\r\n\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nominated MPs and the elected MP have raised\r\n\r\ndifferent voices, coming from different backgrounds.   To me,\r\n\r\nelected  MPs  and Nominated MPs are like people holding  pink\r\n\r\nICs   and  blue  ICs  respectively,  that  is,  citizens  and\r\n\r\npermanent  residents.   The  NMPs  are  contributing  to  our\r\n\r\nparliamentary system like the permanent residents contributed\r\n\r\nto our nation building and both are adding value to us.  I do\r\n\r\nnot  agree  with Dr Tan Cheng Bock that, as a  labour  MP  or\r\n\r\nunion  leader,  I  had  to feel bad when  Nominated  MPs  are\r\n\r\ninvited  to  come into this House as representatives  of  the\r\n\r\nlabour movement.  Does it mean that I am not doing my job?  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think  so.   Having  other  union  leaders  here  as\r\n\r\nNominated MPs, will only make our good work here even better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Tan Cheng Bock has said, we need to have people\r\n\r\nfrom  different  educational and  family  backgrounds  coming\r\n\r\nhere.   All these union grassroots leaders who were  promoted\r\n\r\nfrom  the  rank and file are in a better position to  reflect\r\n\r\nthe opinions of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  workers.   If you look at the previous batches  of  NMPs\r\n\r\nfrom  the labour movement, we can see very clearly that  they\r\n\r\nhave   brought   in   alternative  views   and   constructive\r\n\r\nsuggestions from the workers.  I think it is value  added  to\r\n\r\nour  whole  parliamentary  system.   Their  contribution   is\r\n\r\ndefinitely not like adding legs to the snake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since the Nominated MPs come in by a sedan\r\n\r\nchair, we have to be very careful when we are carrying  them.\r\n\r\nThey  are  different from us because they do not have  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  the  General Elections and win the  mandate  of  the\r\n\r\nvoters to come in.  So, I agree with Dr Tan Cheng Bock   that\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  be more stringent  in our selection system,  so\r\n\r\nthat there will not be any black sheep slipping  in from  the\r\n\r\ncrevices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I have your permission to\r\n\r\nseek a point of clarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Yeo has said that\r\n\r\nthe   Nominated  MPs  are  adding  value  and  they  are  not\r\n\r\nredundant.

I support the motion.   We  have\r\n\r\nheard  that there are NMPs who have made useful contributions\r\n\r\nand many did not too and they just occupied the seats in this\r\n\r\nHouse.  So I would urge the Special Select Committee and  the\r\n\r\nLeader of the House that when we implement the NMP system  in\r\n\r\nthis  round, let us not just fill up all the nine seats  that\r\n\r\nwe  have.  If it means it is two, it means two.  If there are\r\n\r\nfour  who qualify out of five, then let it be that,  and  not\r\n\r\njust  stretch to nine to make up the number.  Because in  the\r\n\r\nlast round, I think we have seen the quality dropping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can we have one last speaker, please?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, I know it is\r\n\r\ngetting late, so I will keep it very short.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I hear the arguments and the debate itself, it\r\n\r\nappears to me that the issue of the NMP scheme sounds  a  bit\r\n\r\nlike the issue of foreign talent.  I think Mr Chiam said that\r\n\r\nNMPs  drown the voice of the elected Members.  So it  is  the\r\n\r\nsame  argument,  that foreign talents dilute  local  talents.\r\n\r\nSome  said that the NMPs have no constituency and, therefore,\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  speak for the people.  It is the same  argument\r\n\r\nthat   the  foreign  talents  do  not  know  Singapore   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, cannot work for Singapore.  There is also  someone\r\n\r\nwho  said  that  NMPs have never fought the  GE  itself  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  they do not have the emotional rootedness,  which\r\n\r\nis  the same argument that foreign talents would just pack up\r\n\r\nand go.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I disagree with these arguments because I support\r\n\r\nthe  foreign  talent issue itself.  The NMPs, by adding  them\r\n\r\non,  will  not  drown  out the voice of the  elected  Members\r\n\r\nunless, of course, the elected Members themselves choose  not\r\n\r\nto  speak.   In terms of media space and so on, if  they  can\r\n\r\nstir  up  a  very good argument that promotes debate  itself,\r\n\r\nthen  perhaps  the media can consider giving us  more  space,\r\n\r\nrather than limited to that number of pages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of constituency, I would say that although they\r\n\r\ndo  not  represent a constituency, they do come from  certain\r\n\r\nassociations or representations.  In that sense, they can  be\r\n\r\ncontributing to the debate itself with perhaps a  little  bit\r\n\r\nmore  depth  on specific issues.  As for the fact  that  they\r\n\r\nnever  fought  GE  and,  therefore,  they  do  not  have  the\r\n\r\nemotional rootedness, we also know of the same NMP  who  then\r\n\r\nwent  to  fight the elections and garnered only 14 votes.   I\r\n\r\nthink he must have gone through -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> 14%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> 14%, yes, I am sorry.

He  must have thought that, after going through  the\r\n\r\nparliamentary  process and so on, he has more to  contribute.\r\n\r\nI do agree, however, that the process of selection itself has\r\n\r\nto  be  more diligent.  We have to be careful about  whom  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  speak for and which constituent is not represented.\r\n\r\nI  think Mr Steve Chia actually mentioned that the youths and\r\n\r\nso  on are not represented in the voting process because they\r\n\r\nare under 21 and perhaps they are the group of people whom we\r\n\r\nwant to represent.  Then, of course, there are other minority\r\n\r\nvoices that we need to hear.  So I would think that, yes,  if\r\n\r\nwe  can  broaden some of these selection criteria on the  one\r\n\r\nhand  and make sure that it is not just based on some  people\r\n\r\nwho  have academic excellence but that they have really  done\r\n\r\nsomething in some associations, even if they do not have that\r\n\r\nkind  of  academic excellence, we can bring  them  into  this\r\n\r\nHouse, so that the various groups have a voice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, I would like to remind this House\r\n\r\nthat,  earlier on, Mr Chan Soo Sen spoke about \"lu san dian\",\r\n\r\nie, the three points that he talked about, that we have to be\r\n\r\n\"xin  xiong kwang yi dian\", \"guang huai duo yi dian\" and \"dan\r\n\r\nzi da yi dian\", which relate to taking risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that light, I would say that, yes, one, let us be\r\n\r\n\"dan zi da yi dian\", ie, take some risks.  In retrospect, the\r\n\r\nNMPs  have  indeed contributed to the debates in this  House.\r\n\r\nWill they do more harm?  I think we have to be \"dan zi da  yi\r\n\r\ndian\" and take a little bit of risk there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, \"xin xiong kwang yi dian\". I think if we do not\r\n\r\nview  it  as a zero-sum game but that the net result of  this\r\n\r\ndebate itself can add on to the validity of some of the Bills\r\n\r\nthat  are  passed  or even the debates in  this  House,  then\r\n\r\nParliament and Singaporeans at large will actually benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, \"guang huai duo yi dian\". If in a\r\n\r\nspirit  of  wanting  to involve more people  in  the  process\r\n\r\nitself  we involve more people in the form of NMPs  who  will\r\n\r\nalso be getting the voice from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir own represented groups of people, then I think we  will\r\n\r\nall  strive  towards a much better society and a much  better\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, can I make three\r\n\r\nclarifications?  Two are in regard to the last speaker,  Miss\r\n\r\nPenny  Low.   What  I  said  was that  the  NMPs  dilute  the\r\n\r\nOpposition in Parliament, and not dilute the elected Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of my bringing up the instance of an NMP\r\n\r\nstanding for election where he obtained only 14% of the votes\r\n\r\nand  of  course  lost  the  election  was  not  to  show  his\r\n\r\ncontribution,  but  the  fact that he  was  rejected  by  the\r\n\r\nelectorate.   In  other  words, my point  is  that  NMPs  are\r\n\r\nrejected by the voters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clarification is with regard to Assoc. Prof.\r\n\r\nChin.   I  do not support the NMP scheme.  I brought  up  the\r\n\r\npoint  that  the next NMP, if he comes along,  could  move  a\r\n\r\nmotion  to  repeal the Maintenance of Parents Act  because  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Leader of the House asked me to repeal  it  and  I\r\n\r\nsaid no.

For the MPs who have been here for 10 years,\r\n\r\nwe  have  seen many NMPs.  At least there is one NMP who  was\r\n\r\nprepared  to  say, \"OK, I am prepared to stand  for  election\r\n\r\nsince  I am somehow interested in politics.\"  Sir, the  point\r\n\r\nis - I was in the Special Select\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee  for  NMPs  - sometimes, when  we  go  through  the\r\n\r\ninterviews,  what  crosses my mind is: why are  these  people\r\n\r\nprepared  to  be NMPs but are not prepared to participate  in\r\n\r\nthe political process?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, do you know that you are making\r\n\r\nanother speech?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> No, Sir, I have a clarification on\r\n\r\nthe  points made.  What I am saying is that perhaps we should\r\n\r\nnot  look  at the NMP who only had 14% of the votes as  being\r\n\r\nrejected.   The last thing we want is for the NMP  scheme  to\r\n\r\nbecome  something that encourages NATO, ie, no  action,  talk\r\n\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my name keeps\r\n\r\ncropping up every time when -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Tan, are you making another speech or\r\n\r\nare you asking for a clarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think there are\r\n\r\ncertain  points  that  have been  raised,  at  least  I  must\r\n\r\nrespond.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No, you cannot.

Otherwise, we can be here befuddled about what he is\r\n\r\nthinking about.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes. Mr Wong, do you want to wrap up?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I am quite clear, Sir. This is the\r\n\r\nthird  time  I am doing this, and I have heard  many  of  the\r\n\r\narguments  before.   I spent the whole of  last  night  going\r\n\r\nthrough this fairly thick file which the Parliament Librarian\r\n\r\nwas  very  kind  to photocopy for me, and I am very  familiar\r\n\r\nwith  the arguments.  In fact, if Members were to go  through\r\n\r\nthe  same  Hansard, they would have noted that  Dr  Tan  made\r\n\r\nthese same arguments in the Hansard reports in 1989, 1992 and\r\n\r\n1997.   So  I  will  not go through all  these  points  again\r\n\r\nbecause Members can find my answers there too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one point which is not quite clear to many\r\n\r\nMembers  and that the Prime Minister himself has answered  it\r\n\r\nquite eloquently way back in 1989 when he was explaining  the\r\n\r\nmeaning  of Parliament and parliamentary democracy.  And  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister took some time to research into the meaning of\r\n\r\nthese  terms and quoted one paragraph from this  book  by  Mr\r\n\r\nStanley  de  Smith  on the Constitutional and  Administrative\r\n\r\nLaw,   which  said:  \"At  common  law,  Parliament,  as   the\r\n\r\nlegislative body, consists of the House of Commons, the House\r\n\r\nof Lords and the Queen\", and that, of course, is in reference\r\n\r\nto the British Parliament, the mother of all parliaments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other parliaments, eg, in Malaysia, they too have a\r\n\r\nsimilar provision in Article 44 of the Constitution, where it\r\n\r\nsays:  \"The legislative authority of the Federation shall  be\r\n\r\nvested  in  Parliament, which shall consist of the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Agong  and two Majlis (Houses of Parliament)  to  be\r\n\r\nknown  as  the  Dewan Negara (Senate) and  the  Dewan  Rakyat\r\n\r\n(House of Representatives).\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in our case, we have the Constitution that\r\n\r\nprovides  for the legislature that consists of the  President\r\n\r\nand  Parliament, and we have a unicameral Parliament.  We  do\r\n\r\nnot have a two-tiered Chamber.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the other parliaments, eg, the British Parliament,\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Parliament  or even, if I may  call  the  Canadian\r\n\r\nParliament  the  daughter of the mother of  all  parliaments,\r\n\r\nthey too have an unelected Chamber called the Senate.  105 of\r\n\r\nthe  Senators are totally unelected.  In fact, in the British\r\n\r\nHouse  of Lords, 713 of the Lords were totally unelected  and\r\n\r\nyet  they  have  as  much or, if not,  a  lot  of  authority,\r\n\r\nincluding coming up with new Bills and passing Bills  in  the\r\n\r\nHouse of Lords.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will not belabour this point. I just clarify\r\n\r\nthat,  indeed, there are different ways that we can structure\r\n\r\na  parliament  and,  in  our case, it is  just  a  unicameral\r\n\r\nParliament  and  we have devised a scheme to allow  unelected\r\n\r\nMembers  to  be  brought  into  this  Chamber.   That  is  an\r\n\r\ninteresting device because we have allowed others to come  in\r\n\r\nand  take part in our debate, which otherwise they would  not\r\n\r\nhave been because we do not have a second Chamber.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of the way that we have been evolving our\r\n\r\nparliamentary system that we have NCMPs too.  So I  am  quite\r\n\r\npuzzled  as  to  why  Mr  Steve Chia would  want  to  object,\r\n\r\nbecause,  following the same purist principle,  which  he  so\r\n\r\nstrongly  supported Dr Tan for, then he should not  be  here,\r\n\r\nbecause he is also unelected.  He came in by the grace of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAP  Government that changed the Constitution  that  provided\r\n\r\nfor the NCMP system that allowed him to be here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I also hope that Mr Steve Chia would not begin to\r\n\r\nspeak  like  a PAP MP because, if he does, then  people  will\r\n\r\nreally be confused.  The Whip is not applied to him.  He does\r\n\r\nnot need to talk about the Whip at all.  So whether we have a\r\n\r\nWhip  or not is our internal Party business.  So he does  not\r\n\r\nneed  to  remind our MPs that they are not subjected  to  the\r\n\r\nWhip.  He himself is not subjected to any Whip at all at  any\r\n\r\ntime, unless Mr Chiam wants to impose it on him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam's argument, about people rejecting the NMP, is\r\n\r\nreally a great leap of imagination.  I do not understand  how\r\n\r\nan  individual,  having been here as an NMP, eventually  went\r\n\r\nout  and  contested in an election and got  rejected  by  the\r\n\r\npeople,  rejected him because they do not want him to  be  an\r\n\r\nelected MP, means that they do not like the NMP system,  that\r\n\r\nis beyond me.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I clarify?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to make two\r\n\r\nclarifications with the Leader of the House.   The  first  is\r\n\r\nregarding  the  NCMP.  The Leader says that an  NCMP  is  not\r\n\r\nelected  but the issue is not whether he is elected  or  not.\r\n\r\nThe   issue   that  I  brought  up  is  that   democracy   is\r\n\r\nrepresentation.   But, in his case, to some  extent,  he  has\r\n\r\nrepresentation, about 35% of the votes.  Even the first NCMP,\r\n\r\nMr  J  B Jeyaretnam, I think, had 44% of the votes in a  GRC.\r\n\r\nThe  issue is representation, and not whether he is the first\r\n\r\nto pass the post and he has obtained 50%.  That is my point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is regarding Chia Shi Teck. He lost\r\n\r\nwhen be obtained only 14% of the votes.  My point is not that\r\n\r\nhe  dares  or  he wants to present himself in  the  electoral\r\n\r\nprocess.  My point is that he was a high profile NMP, and the\r\n\r\nnewspapers gave him a lot of coverage.  So he went  to  stand\r\n\r\nfor  elections on the strength of his reputation as  an  NMP,\r\n\r\nand on that score,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  lost.  So my conclusion is that the people do not want an\r\n\r\nNMP.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I\r\n\r\nclarify?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Wong, are you giving way?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, the Leader of the House\r\n\r\nsaid I am a purist.  I am not a purist.  I did not object  to\r\n\r\nthe  scheme of NCMP but my argument is that:  do we  need  to\r\n\r\nhave  NMPs  in the House in this first session of Parliament?\r\n\r\nMy argument is that we do not need to, because the Government\r\n\r\ncould  show their sincerity in their action by allowing their\r\n\r\npeople to speak up even more.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> If I remember Mr Steve Chia\r\n\r\ncorrectly, when he was talking about this point, he said that\r\n\r\nwe do not need the NMP scheme at this time and that after two\r\n\r\nyears,  if  it  shows  that the elected  MPs  did  not  prove\r\n\r\nthemselves, then let us bring back the NMPs.  Maybe he should\r\n\r\nread  the  Constitution.   The Constitution,  in  the  Fourth\r\n\r\nSchedule, says that at the beginning of every term and within\r\n\r\nsix  months,  which is now, Parliament must resolve  to  have\r\n\r\nNMPs.   Once  we  go  beyond six months, and  we  do  not  so\r\n\r\nresolve,  we  cannot  have any more NMPs  during  this  Tenth\r\n\r\nParliament.   He would have no chance to come back  here  and\r\n\r\nintroduce a motion to get back NMPs unless he gets elected in\r\n\r\nthe Eleventh Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on the issue of representation. In our system,\r\n\r\nrepresentation means \"first-past-the-post\".  It means that  a\r\n\r\ncandidate  must  get 50% plus one vote,  then  he  gets  into\r\n\r\nParliament.   He may get 49.99%, but he is still  voted  out.\r\n\r\nSo  he has no representation at all.  Mr Steve Chia does  not\r\n\r\nrepresent  34%  of  the people who voted for  him.   He  just\r\n\r\nreceived 34% of the votes and, therefore, he has not the same\r\n\r\nright  as  Mr  Chiam has to be here.  And  he  came  in  here\r\n\r\nbecause we have a system to allow NCMPs to come in here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang raised a more serious point. Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the  reasons  he  cited,  he  said  that  the  original\r\n\r\nobjectives why we should have NMPs were not really fulfilled.\r\n\r\nI do not think that is the case because, if that is the case,\r\n\r\nwe would not be talking about NMPs here.  If NMPs show up the\r\n\r\ninadequacy of the Opposition, then that has got nothing to do\r\n\r\nwith  us.   It just means that the Opposition just  does  not\r\n\r\nhave   enough   numbers.   And  if  the  NMPs  outshine   the\r\n\r\nOpposition, then the Opposition has got to work very hard the\r\n\r\nnext  time.   They have got to find other ways of  convincing\r\n\r\npeople.  Following the same argument that Mr Chiam is worried\r\n\r\nthat  NMPs  dilute the Opposition, I think  that  is  a  real\r\n\r\nreason  for  him to fear why we should not have  NMPs,  which\r\n\r\nalso  means that he has got to work very hard the  next  time\r\n\r\nround  to  find people to join him and be convinced to  their\r\n\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mr Low's serious point is that if we want to talk\r\n\r\nabout  getting  more representation and more views,  why  not\r\n\r\nchange our political system to proportional representation or\r\n\r\nhave a mixed system.  Do not forget that Singapore is a small\r\n\r\ncountry,  a  multi-racial and multi-religious  country.   The\r\n\r\nmoment  we have a proportional representation system, we  are\r\n\r\ngoing   to  have  different  sectional,  communal,  religious\r\n\r\ninterests represented in this system.  Then we are  going  to\r\n\r\nhave a very unstable system.  In Western Europe, many of  the\r\n\r\nParliaments  there  do  have  a  proportional  representation\r\n\r\nsystem.   As  a result, you can see that, as far  as  policy-making  is  concerned,  and  as  far  as  the  government  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  it has not progressed that far.  It becomes  very\r\n\r\ndifficult for decisions to be made, for laws to be passed and\r\n\r\na lot of trade-offs and compromises would have to be made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one country that attempted a mixed system,\r\n\r\nwhich is proportional representation plus the first-past-the-post  system, and that is New Zealand.  In the same way, they\r\n\r\nhave  almost  ground  to  the ground  -  very  difficult  for\r\n\r\npolicies  to  be  passed and laws to be  made.   In  a  small\r\n\r\nSingapore, where we have so many constraints, we have so  few\r\n\r\nalternatives\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand choices and only one or two ways of deciding on a policy,\r\n\r\nwe  do not have that luxury of choice.  We should think  very\r\n\r\nseriously  before we change the system.  But  that  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  to  say that political systems should not  change.   We\r\n\r\nhave.   We  have evolved over the years to allow  for  NCMPs,\r\n\r\nNMPs  and  GRCs  where all races can be represented  in  this\r\n\r\nParliament.   Were  there  further changes?   Of  course,  we\r\n\r\nchanged   the  Presidential  system.   We  have  an   Elected\r\n\r\nPresident to ensure that certain safeguards are in  place  to\r\n\r\nprotect  our reserves, veto key appointments and certain  key\r\n\r\ndecisions of the Executive, like the ISA detention.  We would\r\n\r\nchange,  but  we  should not rush into just  overhauling  and\r\n\r\nchanging  the system completely that we become unbalanced  to\r\n\r\nthe detriment of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just covered very briefly the few points made by\r\n\r\nMembers.  I have to come back here every term to ask for this\r\n\r\nmotion to be passed and even then, in the Fourth Schedule, it\r\n\r\nsays that NMPs can be appointed for two years, which means if\r\n\r\nParliament lasts the full five years, then we have  to  start\r\n\r\nthe  process  of selecting NMPs three times during  the  full\r\n\r\nfive-year  term.   I am going to propose, at  an  appropriate\r\n\r\ntime, a change to this 2-year term, to stretch it out to 21/2\r\n\r\nyears or 3 years so that, within one Parliamentary term of  5\r\n\r\nyears,  we  only  need  to do it twice.   Otherwise,  if  you\r\n\r\nremember,  like  the last term, we had NMPs who  only  served\r\n\r\nabout  one  month or so, yet we have to go through the  whole\r\n\r\nprocess  of  public advertisement, inviting  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  to send in nominations and interviewing them, and  so\r\n\r\non.   This is an administrative change which I will  have  to\r\n\r\nput  forward  to Parliament at an appropriate  time  when  we\r\n\r\namend the Constitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I make a point of\r\n\r\nclarification, Mr Speaker?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Make it short.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I expected the answer from the\r\n\r\nMinister on proportional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrepresentation.

I  believe  our\r\n\r\npeople are sophisticated enough.  But in every society, there\r\n\r\nwill  be  extremist elements who will try and there  will  be\r\n\r\ngroups of people who will believe in them and, therefore,  we\r\n\r\nmust not provide such opportunities for groups and for people\r\n\r\nlike  that to gather together and find a seat in this  place.\r\n\r\nThat  is precisely the worry that Dr Tan Cheng Bock has, that\r\n\r\nwhen  we select NMPs, we may invariably or unwittingly  bring\r\n\r\nin  an extremist.  We hope that will not happen because every\r\n\r\ntime  we have a list of NMP candidates, we circulate the list\r\n\r\nto  all  MPs for their comments and views.  If by any chance,\r\n\r\nMembers  know  any of them who holds certain  views  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  not entertain in this House, then they must  register\r\n\r\ntheir  points  strongly  with the Special  Select  Committee.\r\n\r\nThat vote, in a sense, is with Members to tell us who the NMP\r\n\r\ncandidates are and why they should not be here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as standards are concerned, we will maintain the\r\n\r\nstandards.   We have to maintain standards.  Of course,  much\r\n\r\ndepends on the kind of people we have coming forward.
