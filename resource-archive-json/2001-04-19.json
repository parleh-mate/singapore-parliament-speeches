A study commissioned by the Agri-Food and Veterinary\r\n\r\nAuthority (AVA) found that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmajor  cause  of the smell nuisance is the improper  handling\r\n\r\nand composting of poultry waste by the farms.  The problem is\r\n\r\naggravated  during the times of the year when the wind  blows\r\n\r\nfrom the poultry farms towards Chua Chu Kang Town.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To contain the smell effectively, the farms will need to\r\n\r\nimprove  their  current  mode  of  operations  to  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the impact on their surroundings.   They  will\r\n\r\nneed to put in place smell control measures.  In fact, one of\r\n\r\nthe farms has recognised this need and has started doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government would like to urge the other farms to\r\n\r\nfollow  the example.  However, we recognise that not all  the\r\n\r\nfarms  may  want  to  make  further  investments  into  their\r\n\r\noperations.   If they wish to cease operations  because  they\r\n\r\nwill   not   be   able  to  meet  the  ENV's  smell   control\r\n\r\nrequirements,  the  Government will offer them  an  ex-gratia\r\n\r\npayment to ease their early exit.  For the farms that  choose\r\n\r\nto  continue  operation, they will have to take  measures  to\r\n\r\nmeet the ENV's smell control requirements by April 2002,  ie,\r\n\r\none year from today.  AVA and ENV have assessed that this  is\r\n\r\na  reasonable  time-frame for the farms to put in  place  the\r\n\r\nrequired smell control measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AVA and ENV officers have met with the farmers to\r\n\r\noutline to them the details of the offer of ex-gratia payment\r\n\r\nand  explain how AVA and ENV will help them to implement  the\r\n\r\nnecessary smell control measures by April 2002 if they opt to\r\n\r\ncontinue poultry farming.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understandable for residents in Chua Chu Kang to\r\n\r\nwant the smell nuisance removed quickly.  However, we need to\r\n\r\ngive  the four poultry farms a reasonable period of  time  to\r\n\r\nput in the smell control measures.  I would therefore like to\r\n\r\nseek  the understanding and patience of the residents in Chua\r\n\r\nChu  Kang  Town.   AVA  and  ENV  are  confident  that,  with\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and cooperation of the four farms,  the  smell\r\n\r\nnuisance can be removed.  They\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill monitor their implementation closely during this interim\r\n\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister of State to elaborate a little\r\n\r\nbit  more  on the smell control measures so that the  farmers\r\n\r\nwill  be able to comply with them.  I would also like to  ask\r\n\r\nwhether the measures are economically viable for the farmers.\r\n\r\nIf  not, why should there be such measures to curb the  farms\r\n\r\nfrom operating?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, ENV has got standards\r\n\r\nthat would require the farms to comply with and one of  these\r\n\r\nstandards is to treat the smell.  There are many technologies\r\n\r\nthat  they  can use for waste treatment, but the concern   is\r\n\r\nthe smell that is generated from this treatment.  One method,\r\n\r\nfor  instance, is to enclose the building and scrub  the  air\r\n\r\nthat is discharged. ENV will help the farmers and explain  to\r\n\r\nthem what kind of standards ENV would require.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmers will then have to assess whether the\r\n\r\ninvestment  that they have to put in is viable  economically.\r\n\r\nIf  they  feel  that  it  is  not  economically  viable,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is prepared, on a goodwill basis, to  ease  their\r\n\r\nearly  exit  by offering them an ex-gratia payment.   But  if\r\n\r\nthey  feel  that  they  can still be  competitive  with  this\r\n\r\ninvestment, they are welcome to do so.  ENV and AVA can  also\r\n\r\nhelp   them  to  apply  for  assistance  under  the  relevant\r\n\r\nGovernment schemes, for example, the PSB schemes for SMEs, to\r\n\r\nease their implementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, in the light of the\r\n\r\npredicament  faced  by  many of the shopkeepers  in  the  HDB\r\n\r\nheartland, particularly because of this high rental and  poor\r\n\r\nbusiness due to these mega supermarkets and shopping  centres\r\n\r\nin the HDB estates, would the Minister consider giving a once-and-for-all  cut in rentals and also adopt other pro-business\r\n\r\npractices to ensure that business returns to these  shops  in\r\n\r\nthe HDB heartland?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, there are two parts to the\r\n\r\nMember's  question.   The first is the question  of  bringing\r\n\r\nbusiness  back,  and the second aspect is  lowering  business\r\n\r\ncost.   In  so  far as the second aspect is concerned,  as  I\r\n\r\nexplained  earlier,  HDB has given back  to  the  shopkeepers\r\n\r\nrebates  in  rentals over the last four years.   Indeed,  the\r\n\r\nrental rebates are still in place and will be reviewed  again\r\n\r\nin   the  next  three  months.   But  that  would  not   help\r\n\r\nshopkeepers if the business is not there in the first  place.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why, in the recent package of measures  to\r\n\r\nassist  HDB  shopkeepers,  which I announced  in  Parliament,\r\n\r\nthere are elements to help the shopkeepers to bring back  the\r\n\r\nbusiness,   for   example,  assistance  measures,   upgrading\r\n\r\nmeasures, franchise measures, measures for shopkeepers to get\r\n\r\ntogether to improve and upgrade the environment, and  so  on.\r\n\r\nI  think those measures are just as important as any measures\r\n\r\ntaken  by  HDB  to  reduce rentals.   There  are  also  other\r\n\r\nprogrammes  in  place,  for example, greater  flexibility  in\r\n\r\nsubleasing the shops, greater flexibility in changing the use\r\n\r\nof  the shops, and so on.  Last, but not least, for those who\r\n\r\nreally wish to exit the trade, there are also measures put in\r\n\r\nplace to facilitate their exit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures taken together will, I believe, help\r\n\r\nto  a certain extent.  But I would like to emphasise that the\r\n\r\nshopkeepers themselves must make the effort.  They must avail\r\n\r\nthemselves of these measures.  They must make the  effort  to\r\n\r\nget  together.  They must make the effort to approach PSB  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  their  shops and to take advantage  of  the  various\r\n\r\nschemes  that  are  available. Without the efforts  taken  by\r\n\r\nthem, I am afraid that just talking about a rebate and a  cut\r\n\r\nin  rentals alone would not suffice.  I hope the Member  will\r\n\r\nhelp to spread this message.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PASIR RIS COMMUNITY CLUB</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Housing of Association of Muslim Professionals' new headquarters)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Minister for Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and Sports if he can provide an  update  on  the\r\n\r\nlatest  status  of plans for the Pasir Ris Central  Community\r\n\r\nClub's  co-shared  facilities to  house  the  Association  of\r\n\r\nMuslim Professionals' new headquarters and services.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development and Sports (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Sir, the Government is providing space\r\n\r\nfor  the  Association of Muslim Professionals  (AMP)  at  the\r\n\r\nPasir   Ris   Central  Community  Building   to   house   its\r\n\r\nheadquarters  and  for some of its approved core  programmes.\r\n\r\nThe  premises currently occupied by AMP at Jalan Tembusu have\r\n\r\nbeen earmarked for development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February this year, the Government decided on a new\r\n\r\npolicy  on  the  terms  and  conditions  applicable  to   all\r\n\r\nGovernment-assisted NGOs which provide community services  at\r\n\r\nmulti-service  centres and community  club  premises.

The\r\n\r\npremises should be used only for programmes approved  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, AMP was offered a Government grant of up to\r\n\r\n$6.75  million, to cover 90% of the construction cost of  its\r\n\r\nnew premises at the Pasir Ris Central Community Building.   A\r\n\r\ngross floor area of 3,700 square metres, comprising 6 floors,\r\n\r\nwas  envisaged for the premises.

It may\r\n\r\nuse this space for approved programmes which support the core\r\n\r\nobjectives  of self-help groups.  The Government has  decided\r\n\r\nthat  these  will include students' remedial  and  enrichment\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  workers' training and certain  types  of  social\r\n\r\nservices.   Approved programmes will not include AMPRO, AMP's\r\n\r\nbusiness  arm, and RIMA, which is AMP's subsidiary  providing\r\n\r\nconsultancy and research services.

Firstly, the new  medical\r\n\r\nbenefits scheme should ensure continuity of medical coverage.\r\n\r\nEmployees  should  be  allowed to accumulate  unused  medical\r\n\r\nbenefits  for  future needs, for example,  when  they  change\r\n\r\nemployment  or  when  they retire.   Secondly,  the  proposed\r\n\r\nscheme  would incorporate co-payment and deductible  elements\r\n\r\nto  encourage individuals to take greater responsibility  for\r\n\r\ntheir healthcare.  Thirdly, it should ensure affordability of\r\n\r\nbasic  healthcare for the employees.  The scheme should  also\r\n\r\nnot undermine employers' cost competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tripartite Committee is currently examining an\r\n\r\nappropriate  framework  for  the  portable  medical  benefits\r\n\r\nscheme.   Under this framework, the current employer-provided\r\n\r\ninpatient\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmedical  benefits scheme could be restructured to incorporate\r\n\r\nnew features.  Employers would make an appropriate additional\r\n\r\nmonthly  contribution to their employees' Medisave  accounts.\r\n\r\nThe amount should be adequate to meet the premium for a basic\r\n\r\nmedical insurance, for example,  MediShield Basic.  Employees\r\n\r\ncould  also  use  any  balance  of  the  additional  Medisave\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  purchase  an  enhanced  level  of  medical\r\n\r\ncoverage  according  to  their own  needs,  purchase  medical\r\n\r\ncoverage  for  their  dependants, or save  for  their  future\r\n\r\nneeds.   This is a key advantage of the proposed scheme  over\r\n\r\nthe existing system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for outpatient medical benefits, the Committee is\r\n\r\nexploring  a scheme which is modelled on the Civil  Service's\r\n\r\nOutpatients Scheme.  Under this scheme, employees  would  co-pay  a  small  portion of their outpatient bills.   Employers\r\n\r\nwould  set aside an annual lump sum per employee to be  drawn\r\n\r\ndown  for the employers' portion of the employees' outpatient\r\n\r\nbill.   Any unused portion of the employers' annual lump  sum\r\n\r\nwould be credited into the employees' Medisave account.   The\r\n\r\nadvantages of the proposed outpatient medical benefits scheme\r\n\r\nare:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) it encourages the responsible use of outpatient\r\n\r\nbenefits  and  allows employees to save their unused  medical\r\n\r\nprovision for future medical needs; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the cost of providing outpatient medical benefits\r\n\r\nwould be more predictable for companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee is studying the amount that employers\r\n\r\ncould  set  aside  as  the  annual  lump  sum  to  cover  the\r\n\r\nemployers'  portion  of  outpatient  expenses.   It  is  also\r\n\r\nstudying  tax measures that could be introduced to facilitate\r\n\r\nthe early adoption of the portable medical benefits scheme by\r\n\r\nemployers.   The  Committee  had  received  feedback  on  the\r\n\r\nMediShield Scheme, particularly its co-payment and deductible\r\n\r\nelements  and  this would be discussed by  the  Committee  in\r\n\r\nconsultation with the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of converting the existing employer-provided\r\n\r\nmedical benefits\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nscheme  to  a portable medical benefits scheme is  a  complex\r\n\r\none.  While there is agreement on a framework of the portable\r\n\r\nmedical  benefits  scheme, the SNEF and NTUC  representatives\r\n\r\nhave asked for more time to study the proposed scheme and how\r\n\r\nto  introduce it to existing employees.  They need more  time\r\n\r\nto  consult their members.  Their views and feedback would be\r\n\r\ncarefully considered by the Committee.  The Committee expects\r\n\r\nto  complete its study and submit its recommendations to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in a few months' time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, would the\r\n\r\nCommittee  be  looking  at the issue  of  older  workers  who\r\n\r\nactually  need  this  medical payment and  do  not  have  the\r\n\r\nresources  to accumulate for future use?  They need  it  now.\r\n\r\nIn portability, how would he intend to handle this issue?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, the Committee will\r\n\r\nstudy  all  the  issues connected with the  portable  medical\r\n\r\nbenefits scheme.

The\r\n\r\nissue  of older employees and how their medical benefits  can\r\n\r\nbe  taken  care of is one of the concerns which we  are  also\r\n\r\ntackling.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nwhat  is the general reaction of employers towards this  idea\r\n\r\nof portable medical benefits scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Actually, the employers\r\n\r\nare  concerned about the cost impact of the new scheme.

Those  who  wish  to  make\r\n\r\nadditional    contributions   do   so   voluntarily.     Such\r\n\r\ncontributions are subject to prevailing CPF withdrawal rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government encourages the self-employed to\r\n\r\ncontribute to the Central Provident Fund as they also need to\r\n\r\nsave  for their old age.  Self-employed can claim tax  relief\r\n\r\non  these  contributions and enjoy a minimum guaranteed  tax-free return of 2.5% per annum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the difficulties faced by some self-employed persons. However, releasing the CPF savings to\r\n\r\nmeet  immediate financial needs would defeat the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nsuch  savings.  We need to take a long term view.   The  most\r\n\r\nsustainable  way for people in financial difficulties  is  to\r\n\r\nget  a  job to support themselves and their families.   Self-employed  whose businesses or trades are not doing  well  may\r\n\r\nwant  to  consider  taking a job  for  the  time  being.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry will help the unemployed to look for new jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singaporeans suffering financial hardship, the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education has a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nscheme  to  help pay the educational expenses of school-going\r\n\r\nchildren  in their families.

If  a  self-employed\r\n\r\nwere  to  put  his money in a bank, in times of hardship,  he\r\n\r\ncould  go  to  the  bank and withdraw  his  money.   In  this\r\n\r\nparticular case, the person came to me and said, \"I am broke.\r\n\r\nMy  wife wants to leave me.  My children want to disown  me.\"\r\n\r\nHe  is in a real financial hardship, because his business has\r\n\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Chiam, can you ask your question?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes. Is it possible for the CPF\r\n\r\nBoard to allow him to borrow from his CPF account?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I think it is wrong for Mr Chiam\r\n\r\nto  imply  that  there is no benefit for a  self-employed  to\r\n\r\ncontribute voluntarily to his CPF account.  The advantages of\r\n\r\nsuch contribution are quite obvious.  One is tax exemption on\r\n\r\nthe   CPF   contribution.   Second,  the  guaranteed  minimum\r\n\r\ninterest  the  CPF Board will pay.  So, he  cannot  say  that\r\n\r\nthere  are no advantages. There is a trade off.  You get  tax\r\n\r\nexemption and guaranteed minimum interest.  And the trade off\r\n\r\nis that you abide by the CPF withdrawal rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot operate a CPF system on the basis of a\r\n\r\nsavings  bank.  If a self-employed wants to save  some  money\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwithdraw as and when he needs the money, then it is best  for\r\n\r\nhim,  with his surplus income, to put that money in a savings\r\n\r\nbank,  whether  it  is the POSBank or some other  banks,  and\r\n\r\nwithdraw those savings when he needs them, rather than put it\r\n\r\nin  the CPF.  The CPF is a place for long-term savings for  a\r\n\r\nperson's  old-age needs.  It is not a place for  you  to  put\r\n\r\nmoney  aside for a few months and then take out as  and  when\r\n\r\nyou feel that there is a greater need for those savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, would the Minister consider some\r\n\r\nexceptions in really extenuating circumstances?  For example,\r\n\r\nsome taxi drivers may not have enough savings to top up their\r\n\r\nMedisave  accounts, and they can only renew their  vocational\r\n\r\ntaxi driver's licence if they top up their Medisave accounts.\r\n\r\nCan  they  borrow  money from their Ordinary  accounts  on  a\r\n\r\ntemporary basis for the purpose of topping up their  Medisave\r\n\r\naccounts to renew their taxi driver's licence?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, the Member has raised a totally\r\n\r\ndifferent  issue, but I will try and address it, because  the\r\n\r\ncontribution  for  Medisave account by the  self-employed  is\r\n\r\nmandatory.  It is a requirement.  They have to contribute  in\r\n\r\norder  to renew the vocational licence, whether he is a  taxi\r\n\r\ndriver  or  a  hawker.   This is to  ensure  that  our  self-employed, particularly this group of self-employed, also  put\r\n\r\naside  sufficient savings to meet their old-age  requirements\r\n\r\nfor  healthcare expenses.  On top of that, if they choose  to\r\n\r\ncontribute voluntarily to the rest of the CPF accounts,  they\r\n\r\nare  welcome to do so and they enjoy the same benefits, which\r\n\r\nI  have outlined to Mr Chiam a moment ago.  I think we should\r\n\r\nnot  mix the two streams of savings.  We should encourage the\r\n\r\nself-employed to continue to contribute a small  amount  from\r\n\r\nhis  trade income for his Medisave requirement.  There should\r\n\r\nbe  no  difficulty, because the contribution  is  actually  a\r\n\r\npercentage  of  his  trade income.

US growth in the  first\r\n\r\nquarter this year has also been marginal.  The consensus view\r\n\r\nis  that  the US economy will grow by about 1.9%  this  year,\r\n\r\ndown  from 5.0% last year.  More pertinently for us,  the  US\r\n\r\neconomic slowdown is driven by a major correction in the high-tech  sector  of the economy.  This has affected  the  global\r\n\r\nelectronics industry and caused a sharp worldwide decline  in\r\n\r\nelectronics production.  These factors have dampened  exports\r\n\r\nand  growth  of  the  regional  economies  which  are  highly\r\n\r\ndependent on electronics exports and the US market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weaker external environment has caused Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy  to slow rapidly.  In the first quarter, our  economy\r\n\r\nis estimated to have grown by 4.6%, down sharply from the 11%\r\n\r\nin  the  fourth  quarter of last year.  On a  3-month  moving\r\n\r\naverage basis, manufacturing output growth eased from 19%  in\r\n\r\nDecember last year to 7.3% in February.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the less favourable economic conditions, MTI\r\n\r\nhas  revised  down the 2001 growth forecast for Singapore  to\r\n\r\n3.5-5.5%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1998, in response to the Asian crisis, we\r\n\r\nintroduced  major  cost-cutting measures.  Several  of  these\r\n\r\nmeasures  have not been fully lifted, as we had expected  the\r\n\r\neconomy  to  take some time to recover fully.  These  include\r\n\r\n(a)  restoration  of  the remaining 4  percentage  points  of\r\n\r\nemployer's  CPF  contributions;  (b)  the  25%  property  tax\r\n\r\nrebate; (c) lower foreign worker levies; and (d) the 13%  JTC\r\n\r\nand  HDB  rental  rebates.   In addition,  SMEs  continue  to\r\n\r\nbenefit  from  easier financing through  the  Enhanced  Local\r\n\r\nEnterprise Financing Scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FY 2001 Budget contains several new measures. These\r\n\r\ninclude  lower corporate tax rates, especially for the  small\r\n\r\nand  medium  enterprises, a property tax cut of 2  percentage\r\n\r\npoints, and measures to help HDB retailers.  The property tax\r\n\r\nrebate  expires  in June this year.  However,  this  will  be\r\n\r\noffset by the reduction of the property tax rate, from 12% to\r\n\r\n10%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC and HDB will take the prevailing economic outlook\r\n\r\ninto  consideration  when they review the  industrial  rental\r\n\r\nrebates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On CPF, it is premature to commit to the next steps of\r\n\r\nrestoration now. The Government will decide later in the year\r\n\r\nwhether to restore further part of the remaining 4 percentage\r\n\r\npoints  of employer's contributions in January 2002, and,  if\r\n\r\nso, by how much.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, I urge companies and unions to speed up the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the monthly variable component  in  their\r\n\r\nwage  structure.  This will promote greater wage flexibility,\r\n\r\nand  help  companies to manage costs and save jobs  during  a\r\n\r\ndownturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the outlook has turned less positive, all is\r\n\r\nnot  gloom  and doom.  The Euroland economy is still  growing\r\n\r\nsteadily;  likewise, China and India.  Our  companies  should\r\n\r\ntake  advantage of these pockets of growth, while they  await\r\n\r\nthe  broader recovery associated with a turnaround in the  US\r\n\r\neconomy.   Despite the slowdown, we still expect  to  achieve\r\n\r\npositive growth this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible for the Government to fine-tune its\r\n\r\neconomic policy to even out every dip in the business  cycle,\r\n\r\nand keep the economy growing at a constant rate regardless of\r\n\r\nexternal  conditions.   Our economy  is  too  open,  economic\r\n\r\nprospects are too uncertain, and Government pump priming  and\r\n\r\ncost cutting cannot completely make up for a loss of external\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndemand and a slowdown in the developed countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present situation is unlike that we faced during the\r\n\r\nAsian  crisis.  The problem this time is a cyclical  downturn\r\n\r\nin  the US, not a systemic crisis in Asia.  If the US economy\r\n\r\nrecovers  by  the  end of this year, as most experts  expect,\r\n\r\nSingapore should recover with it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this cyclical slowdown is superimposed on the\r\n\r\ncontinuing  restructuring  of the  Singapore  economy.   Some\r\n\r\nworkers  are  being  retrenched in the manufacturing  sector,\r\n\r\neven  as  new  jobs are being created.  The SMEs,  especially\r\n\r\nretailers, are also having a difficult time.  We need to help\r\n\r\ncompanies  and workers to cope with this restructuring.   The\r\n\r\nright  way  to do it is by upgrading industries and  training\r\n\r\nand  retraining  workers.  For the  retail  sector,  we  need\r\n\r\nschemes  to  raise the standard of retailers, through  better\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  customer service, as well as  incentives  to\r\n\r\nencourage  marginal  retailers  to  exit  the  business.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  already doing this.  These  focused  measures\r\n\r\nwill  be  more effective and appropriate than an  across-the-board  package  of  cost  reductions and  rebates,  like  the\r\n\r\nNovember 1998 package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should therefore be measured in our response, and\r\n\r\nride the present slowdown until it passes.  The Government is\r\n\r\nkeeping  a  close watch over the economy.  If  the  situation\r\n\r\ndeteriorates  (I  say \"if\" the situation  deteriorates),  and\r\n\r\nfurther  measures  to  help  businesses  and  workers  become\r\n\r\nnecessary, we have the means and the will to implement them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Two supplementary questions, Sir. There\r\n\r\nis  some  concern among analysts as to the rapid depreciation\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore  dollar  vis-a-vis  the  US  dollar.   The\r\n\r\nquestion that I would like to ask the DPM is whether  we  are\r\n\r\nusing  the  currency as a means to get out  of  this  slowing\r\n\r\neconomic growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is this. In the light of the bad\r\n\r\neconomic situation in the USA, the Federal Reserve last night\r\n\r\nreduced the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninterest  rate by half a point to ensure that the US  economy\r\n\r\ncan  be  on track for economic recovery.  I am just wondering\r\n\r\nwhether, on the part of the Government, we can also introduce\r\n\r\nmeasures like these which can also kick-start the economy  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  are on track to achieve the original goal  of  6-7%\r\n\r\ngrowth,  and  also  whether some of  the  measures  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  introduced during the recession in  1998  can  be\r\n\r\nrelooked  at again, because some of the agencies,  like  JTC,\r\n\r\nhave  already brought up some of their rentals closer to  the\r\n\r\nmarket  price.  So I am wondering whether the Government  can\r\n\r\nlook at some of these measures to be introduced not only on a\r\n\r\nshort-term basis but on a long-term basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar-US  dollar  exchange rate, the  Government  put  up  a\r\n\r\nmonetary  policy statement update, I believe  last  week,  to\r\n\r\nstate  the position, and it was carefully phrased  there.   I\r\n\r\nwill  paraphrase  it, but the position is  exactly  what  was\r\n\r\nstated  last  week, namely, we stated that we settled  on  an\r\n\r\nappreciating  currency band for our policy for the  Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar,  measured  against the trade-weighted  index  of  our\r\n\r\ntrading partners, not just the US dollar but a trade-weighted\r\n\r\nindex.   Our policy remains to maintain a gently appreciating\r\n\r\nband.   If you look at the actual trade-weighted index  since\r\n\r\nFebruary when we set and announced this policy, the index has\r\n\r\nweakened but it has remained within the band.  Our policy has\r\n\r\nnot changed, and we will review it again in the middle of the\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are not using the exchange rate as an instrument\r\n\r\nto  depreciate the currency and maintain our competitiveness.\r\n\r\nWe  are maintaining a slightly strengthening exchange rate on\r\n\r\na trade-weighted basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the US Federal Reserve reduced interest rates\r\n\r\nlast  night,  and  the Member asked whether  we  should  also\r\n\r\nreduce  interest rates or do something similar.  There  is  a\r\n\r\ndifference  between  our position and the American  position.\r\n\r\nThey are the locomotive.  We are being pulled\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalong.   They  have  an  enormous  economy.   They  set   the\r\n\r\nregulator to keep it going just right, not too fast, and  not\r\n\r\ntoo slow.  And when it slows down, they adjust the regulator;\r\n\r\nthe  economy, hopefully, will respond and will speed up.  And\r\n\r\nindeed last night, after the US Federal Reserve cut the  rate\r\n\r\nby  50 basis points, the stock market went up.  There was  an\r\n\r\nimmediate psychological reaction.  But they are a big economy\r\n\r\nand  there is internal feedback which determines whether they\r\n\r\nare  going  too  fast or too slow.  For us, we  are  a  small\r\n\r\neconomy,  and it is the external environment which determines\r\n\r\nwhether  we go fast or not.  And our external environment  is\r\n\r\nset  by the US, Europe, Japan, and to some extent also by our\r\n\r\nregion.   So we hope that the Americans recover, and we  will\r\n\r\ngo with it.  But we do not have instruments like the exchange\r\n\r\nrate which we can adjust and, as a result of that, boost  our\r\n\r\nbusinesses  in  Singapore, because so much of our  demand  is\r\n\r\noverseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as for the measures in 1998, particularly the\r\n\r\nJTC  and HDB rentals which the Member referred to, as I  said\r\n\r\nin my answer, we will be reviewing the rental position of JTC\r\n\r\nand  HDB,  and we will take the environment into  account  in\r\n\r\ndeciding  this.   Once  you  have measures  to  deal  with  a\r\n\r\ndifficult economic situation, I appreciate that it  is  quite\r\n\r\nhard  to  take away the measures, because everybody  is  very\r\n\r\nhappy when the rental comes down; and everybody is very happy\r\n\r\nwhen  the  economy recovers.  But when the  moment  comes  to\r\n\r\nremove  the  concessions, everybody says,  \"I  haven't  quite\r\n\r\nrecovered  yet.   Can I have the medicine for  a  little  bit\r\n\r\nlonger?\"   This year, there might even be a case, because  it\r\n\r\ndepends on how the economy develops, and we will see.  But as\r\n\r\nI  have  explained in the main answer, what we need  in  this\r\n\r\nsituation is not what we needed in 1998, because it is not an\r\n\r\nacross-the-board  problem.  Across-the-board,  we  are  still\r\n\r\nexpecting  to  make positive growth this year.   But  certain\r\n\r\nsectors  of  our  economy  have structural  problems,  either\r\n\r\nbecause  of upgrading or because our whole economic structure\r\n\r\nhas changed.  The retailers have difficulties in HDB estates;\r\n\r\nour market\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstallholders,  many  of  them, have difficulties;  our  older\r\n\r\nworkers  have difficulties.  So what we should do is to  have\r\n\r\ntargeted  measures  to  deal with these structural  problems,\r\n\r\nrather than across-the-board stimulative measures to try  and\r\n\r\nmake up for the slower external environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, in view of the reassessment of\r\n\r\nthe economic situation, can the DPM give an assessment of its\r\n\r\nimpact  on  the labour market, in terms of job loss  and  job\r\n\r\ncreation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> We will have to see. The\r\n\r\nunemployment  rate went up in 1998 during the  crisis.   Last\r\n\r\nyear,  it  had come down considerably, although not quite  to\r\n\r\nthe  pre-crisis level.  We have not got any figures this year\r\n\r\nyet.   So  I  cannot say how much it will go up.  It  depends\r\n\r\npartly on whether we see more retrenchments and prospects for\r\n\r\nsome  retrenchments coming, because you can see the signs  in\r\n\r\nAmerica.

By  the end of last year, about 85% of the fund  have\r\n\r\nbeen committed in 45 funds.  But only about 28% (S$407\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmillion) of TIF's commitments have been disbursed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TIF has not been badly affected by the global slump of\r\n\r\ntechnology stocks for two reasons.  First, we have teamed  up\r\n\r\nwith  strong  VC  partners who are amongst the  best  in  the\r\n\r\nindustry.   Second, the disbursement of committed  funds  has\r\n\r\nbeen gradual.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of TIF is invested with established VCs.\r\n\r\nSeveral  were  able  to raise more than their  targeted  fund\r\n\r\nsizes, though some of the first time early-stage funds (which\r\n\r\nare  meant to help develop local VC expertise) are  seeing  a\r\n\r\nslow-down  in fund raising and deal flows.  Overall,  the  VC\r\n\r\nfunds  in which TIF has invested have raised US$11.7  billion\r\n\r\nout of the US$12.1 billion targeted fund size.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These VC funds will continue to invest in promising\r\n\r\ncompanies  here and abroad.

Singapore's response to this  downturn\r\n\r\nwill  be  watched by the investors and VCs.

SFCCI's  five\r\n\r\nconstituent  members, which include the  Chinese,  Malay  and\r\n\r\nIndian Chambers, agreed that a strong apex organisation  like\r\n\r\nthe  SBF  would  help  co-ordinate  and  promote  Singapore's\r\n\r\nprivate  sector interests both locally and abroad.  SBF  will\r\n\r\nstrengthen  representation  by our  business  sector  in  key\r\n\r\ndomestic,  bilateral  and multilateral  forums  such  as  the\r\n\r\nNational  Wages Council, ASEAN, APEC, ASEM and our  bilateral\r\n\r\nbusiness councils.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI supports the formation of such an SBF. It will\r\n\r\nbenefit  our  business  community.  My  Minister  has  stated\r\n\r\npublicly   and   in  this  House  that  MTI  will   introduce\r\n\r\nlegislation to require larger\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  be members of the SBF.  This is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nensure  that the SBF garners sufficient support and  adequate\r\n\r\nfunds to carry out its objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only companies with paid-up capital of more than half a\r\n\r\nmillion dollars will be required to be members of the SBF and\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  it.   The  great majority  of  our  companies\r\n\r\nincluding   most  SMEs  will  be  exempted   from   the   SBF\r\n\r\ncontribution.   It is hence unlikely that the  membership  of\r\n\r\nour   existing  local  and  foreign  chambers  and   business\r\n\r\nassociations will be threatened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, many of our chambers and business associations\r\n\r\nserve  the  specific needs of their members.   Many  of  them\r\n\r\norganise  trade missions to help their members  expand  their\r\n\r\nbusiness  overseas.  Others offer sector-specific  activities\r\n\r\nfor  their  members  to  network  and  collaborate  with  one\r\n\r\nanother.   Membership in these organisations  will  therefore\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  strong  as long as  they  continue  to  run\r\n\r\nprogrammes and provide services to benefit their members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our chambers and associations form a rich matrix of\r\n\r\nindustry  networks that will help support and strengthen  the\r\n\r\nSBF.  To be an effective and representative apex chamber, SBF\r\n\r\nneeds  to  engage not just the individual companies but  also\r\n\r\nthe   ethnic  chambers,  other  local  business   and   trade\r\n\r\norganisations and foreign business chambers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ethnic chambers are especially important in this\r\n\r\nmatrix  as  our  local small businesses tend  to  be  aligned\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  different  ethnic  groups.   The   ethnic\r\n\r\nchambers will fulfil a valuable and unique role in the SBF by\r\n\r\nrepresenting these ethnic business communities.   It  is  for\r\n\r\nthis  reason that the Chinese, Malay and Indian chambers will\r\n\r\nhave  a permanent place in the SBF Council and therefore have\r\n\r\nan influence in the direction and activities of the SBF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately the success of the SBF depends on the support\r\n\r\nof   the  individual  business  chambers,  associations   and\r\n\r\ncompanies.  The SBF Council will be structured\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuch  that  it includes the key stakeholders - both  business\r\n\r\nassociations  and  companies - in its decision-making.

So  there is a serious concern  that  the  ethnic\r\n\r\nchambers of commerce will lose their importance and many  may\r\n\r\neven  stop joining this organisation as members and, instead,\r\n\r\njoin the SBF directly, particularly the bigger organisations.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is these big business organisations  ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ravindran, could you ask your question?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, the question is whether the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  in  moving the legislation to set  up  SBF,  would\r\n\r\nconsider making provisions whereby membership is through  the\r\n\r\nexisting chambers of commerce or other business organisations\r\n\r\nand  whether, if such a set-up is allowed, membership fee  to\r\n\r\nSBF  can  be  given on a discount basis, perhaps 30%  or  40%\r\n\r\ndiscount,  to those who are members of the existing  chambers\r\n\r\nof commerce.  If they want to join SBF, they will be given  a\r\n\r\ndiscount  in the membership fee so that the existing chambers\r\n\r\nof  commerce can be relevant and many will continue to remain\r\n\r\nas members or join as members.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> As I have said just now, there are\r\n\r\nroles  to  be  played by ethnic chambers.  Each chamber  will\r\n\r\nhave  to provide services to their members.  His question  is\r\n\r\nwhether  we  would  legislate for the  members  to  join  SBF\r\n\r\nthrough  the ethnic chambers.  I think this is not  necessary\r\n\r\nbecause, at the moment, our thinking is that SBF will provide\r\n\r\ngeneral  services  to  represent Singapore  in  international\r\n\r\nforums and also to be a partner to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwork  out national policies on economic matters.  So it  will\r\n\r\nprovide general services to its members.  But ethnic chambers\r\n\r\nwill  play  a  slightly  different role.   For  example,  the\r\n\r\nChinese   Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  can  organise\r\n\r\nmissions  to various parts of China, whereas SBF may  not  be\r\n\r\ninterested  in  doing so.  So I would think that  if  various\r\n\r\nethnic chambers can set up their activities and improve their\r\n\r\nservices,  they  would  be able to retain  and  recruit  more\r\n\r\nmembers to join them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His next question is whether consideration can be given\r\n\r\nfor a discount in membership fees to members who want to join\r\n\r\nSBF  through the chambers.  We would leave it to the  various\r\n\r\nchambers to decide how they would like to work it out because\r\n\r\nwe  would not disallow dual membership.  They can join  as  a\r\n\r\nmember of the ethnic chamber and, at the same time, join SBF.\r\n\r\nWhether the respective ethnic chambers would like to  give  a\r\n\r\ndiscount, we will leave it to them to decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I think the Senior Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary has missed the point.  The point is that, under the\r\n\r\nproposed legislation to be put up by the Ministry, membership\r\n\r\nof  the SBF will become compulsory.  So companies whose paid-up  capital  is  more than $1 million do not have  a  choice.\r\n\r\nThey  must  join as a member.  Naturally, the  question  that\r\n\r\nwill  arise when these companies join as members  is  why  do\r\n\r\nthey  join  another organisation like the Chinese Chamber  of\r\n\r\nCommerce  or  the  Malay Chamber of Commerce  or  the  Indian\r\n\r\nChamber  of  Commerce.  So by making it compulsory,  I  think\r\n\r\nthat  is  something which is of concern to members.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  the  concern  in  the business  circle  is  whether  the\r\n\r\nexisting chambers of commerce can be members of SBF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is with regard to membership fees. It\r\n\r\nis  something  that SBF, in its legislation, has  to  provide\r\n\r\nwhether  such  a discount can be given when one  joins  as  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the  existing chambers.  If  the  matter  is  not\r\n\r\nresolved at the outset, it would be very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifficult  for these matters to be decided subsequently  when\r\n\r\nSBF is set up with full legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> I would like to clarify a point made\r\n\r\nby  the  Member.   Our thinking is to require companies  with\r\n\r\npaid-up  capital of more than half a million dollars,  not  a\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars,  to join as members  of  SBF.   For  ethnic\r\n\r\nchambers,  their catchment is quite big.  Under the  proposed\r\n\r\nlegislation,   we   do  not  require  sole   proprietary   or\r\n\r\npartnership companies to join as members of SBF.  So they are\r\n\r\nnot  affected.  They can still continue to be members of  the\r\n\r\nethnic  chambers.  For companies with over and above  half  a\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars  paid-up capital, they can decide  on  their\r\n\r\nown.  They can still remain as members of the ethnic chambers\r\n\r\nand,  at  the same time, become members of SBF under the  new\r\n\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our thinking is that, as I have said just now, if the\r\n\r\nchambers  of commerce can provide relevant services to  their\r\n\r\nmembers,  they  would  like  to continue  because  they  have\r\n\r\ndifferent needs.  I hope that arrangements can be worked  out\r\n\r\nso  that the various ethnic chambers can deal with this  dual\r\n\r\nmembership  problem, whether by giving discounts  or  through\r\n\r\nsome  other  measures.   As  I have  said  just  now,  ethnic\r\n\r\nchambers can play a very important role and they provide  the\r\n\r\nmatrix of the apex organisation, which is SBF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FATAL ACCIDENTS INVOLVING MOTORISTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Preventive measures)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs, in view of the increase in the number of fatal\r\n\r\naccidents  involving motorcyclists, whether the Ministry  has\r\n\r\ntaken any measures to prevent this unnecessary loss of lives,\r\n\r\nespecially as most of the victims killed are below the age of\r\n\r\n30.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice   is   concerned  that  traffic  accidents   involving\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists have increased\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nover  the  past  two years.   The number of  fatal  accidents\r\n\r\ninvolving motorcyclists increased 15% from 93 in 1999 to  108\r\n\r\nin  the  year  2000.   Last year, about 46%  of  road  deaths\r\n\r\ncomprised motorcyclists and pillion riders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics also confirm that younger riders are more\r\n\r\naccident-prone.  For the past two years,  about  57%  of  the\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists  and pillion riders who died in road  accidents\r\n\r\nwere below 30 years old.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Traffic Police has adopted a 3-pronged approach to\r\n\r\nreduce  the number of motorcycle accidents.  First,  rigorous\r\n\r\ntesting.   Traffic Police has a rigorous testing  system  and\r\n\r\nmaintains a high testing standard for motorcycle or  Class  2\r\n\r\nlicences.   The  testing  system is  a  graduated  one  where\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists  cannot  apply for  a  bigger  engine  capacity\r\n\r\nmotorcycle licence, without having first obtained  a  smaller\r\n\r\nengine   capacity  motorcycle  licence.    For   example,   a\r\n\r\nmotorcyclist cannot apply for a Class 2 (which is  above  400\r\n\r\ncc)  motorcycle  licence unless he already  has  a  Class  2A\r\n\r\n(which is from 201 cc to 400 cc) and Class 2B (which is up to\r\n\r\n200   cc)  licences.   Testing  standards  are  also  closely\r\n\r\nmonitored and regularly reviewed to ensure that motorcyclists\r\n\r\nacquire  a high standard of skills and good habits in  riding\r\n\r\nmotorcycles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, public education. Traffic Police regularly\r\n\r\nconducts  public education programmes to educate road  users,\r\n\r\nincluding  motorcyclists on road safety.  Last year,  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice conducted a total of 21 road safety talks and 70  road\r\n\r\nsafety  exhibitions specifically for motorcyclists.   Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice   also   organises  other  initiatives   targeted   at\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists,  such as the Road Safety  Month,  Safe  Riding\r\n\r\nRally and the Road Safety Seminar cum Workshop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, strict enforcement. Sir, in addition to rigorous\r\n\r\ntesting  and  public  education, Traffic  Police  also  takes\r\n\r\nstrict     enforcement    action    against     irresponsible\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists.  In particular, Traffic Police takes  a  tough\r\n\r\nstance   against  motorcyclists  for  inconsiderate  driving,\r\n\r\ndangerous driving and speeding, which are the primary  causes\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmotorcycle  accidents  where motorcyclists  have  been  found\r\n\r\nnegligent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Traffic Police conducted many operations\r\n\r\nagainst  errant  motorcyclists.  Traffic Police  also  issued\r\n\r\nmore  than  51,000  summonses to  motorcyclists  for  traffic\r\n\r\nviolations, an increase of 16% over the previous year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in summary, Traffic Police will continue to work\r\n\r\nhard  to  improve road safety for all.  But, ultimately,  all\r\n\r\nroad  users  must  understand that they are  responsible  for\r\n\r\ntheir  own  safety.  Hence, all road users should take  extra\r\n\r\ncare  on  the  roads,  ride or drive safely  and  follow  the\r\n\r\ntraffic  rules,  which  are designed for  their  safety.   By\r\n\r\npractising  safe driving or riding habits at all times,  they\r\n\r\nnot only enhance their personal road safety but also make our\r\n\r\nroads safer for all other users.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, a sizeable of them are\r\n\r\nforeigners,  in  particular, Malaysians.  For  example,  last\r\n\r\nyear, of the fatalities, 77% were Singaporeans and about  23%\r\n\r\nwere  Malaysians.  In fact, Traffic Police is also  aware  of\r\n\r\nthat.   Therefore,  they also target Malaysian  motorcyclists\r\n\r\nwho  are  coming in.  For example, on several  occasions,  in\r\n\r\n1995,  1996  and  1999,  they had deployed  officers  at  the\r\n\r\nWoodlands  Immigration Checkpoint to distribute  road  safety\r\n\r\nleaflets to these foreign motorists who were coming in.   And\r\n\r\nindeed,  only  in  March  this year,  they  also  sought  the\r\n\r\nassistance  of  SIR to distribute road safety  leaflets.   So\r\n\r\nthere  is  an  attempt to reach out to these foreign  riders.\r\n\r\nAnd in particular, the GPC Chairman may recall that, in 1999,\r\n\r\nwe amended the laws to extend the Driver\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nImprovement  Points System (DIPS) to include foreign  driving\r\n\r\nlicence  holders.

But  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  different speed limits for different categories  of\r\n\r\nthe  same  type of transportation, for example,  motorcycles,\r\n\r\nwill  make  it  very hard for Traffic Police to  monitor  and\r\n\r\nenforce  the  rules.   But,  certainly,  in  terms  of   road\r\n\r\nbehaviour,  those who are on probation will know  that  under\r\n\r\nDIPS, for the first year, if they accumulate 12 points, their\r\n\r\nlicence  will be suspended.  So there is, in fact, already  a\r\n\r\nreminder  to  them all the time that in their first  year  of\r\n\r\nriding  whilst on probation, they should ride more  carefully\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is 12 points.  After that, it is 24 points  over\r\n\r\ntwo  years.   So  there  is already some  differentiation  in\r\n\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask the Minister of State what proportion of  those\r\n\r\nfatalities involved riders who are below 20 years of age and,\r\n\r\nif  a  substantial number of those fatalities really involved\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  below 20 years of age, whether  or  not  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would consider raising the qualifying  age  for  a\r\n\r\nmotorcycle licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

As\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  the point whether we should raise the age limit, in  fact\r\n\r\nthe  age limit for motorcyclists was raised from 16 to 18  on\r\n\r\n1st of May 1996.  It was felt that 18 is a good age, in terms\r\n\r\nof  body size, maturity, etc, and we should keep it at  that.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  18  is  also the age in most countries.

There\r\n\r\nis no serious shortage of nurses at Woodbridge Hospital.  The\r\n\r\nmanpower  situation, we admit, is tight, but it  is  adequate\r\n\r\nfor  the time being.  Let me elaborate a little on this.   At\r\n\r\nthe  moment,  we have 610 nurses in Woodbridge Hospital,  and\r\n\r\nthis  is against the establishment of 720 positions.  So,  on\r\n\r\npaper,  there is a shortage of 15.3% or about  110.   But  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  see  this figure in context.  These  vacancies  are\r\n\r\nprimarily  created because, last year, we added 97 additional\r\n\r\nposts  in  Woodbridge  Hospital in order  to  provide  better\r\n\r\ncoverage of night duties.  So most of the shortfalls are  due\r\n\r\nto  new posts created last year to improve coverage of  night\r\n\r\nduties.  We would have to take some time to recruit people to\r\n\r\nfill  the new posts.  We are confident that, given time,  the\r\n\r\nnecessary number will be recruited.  15.3% manpower shortfall\r\n\r\nsounds   high.   However,  please  remember  that  Woodbridge\r\n\r\nHospital has an occupation rate of about 85%.  So the  number\r\n\r\nof  patients is about 15% lower than the maximum planned for.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why I say that the manpower situation is tight  but\r\n\r\nadequate.

Such pay components, though termed as \"bonuses\",  are\r\n\r\nessentially part of the monthly wages of the employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to the Enlistment Act allows the claim of\r\n\r\nbonuses,  and any other types of pay components if they  meet\r\n\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) it is provided in the ORNSman's employment or\r\n\r\nservice contract;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) it is received on a regular basis over a prescribed\r\n\r\nperiod of time;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) it is subject to CPF contributions under the\r\n\r\nCentral Provident Fund Act; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) it falls within the definition of \"gains or profits\r\n\r\nfrom employment\" under the Income Tax Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to make it more convenient\r\n\r\nfor  ORNSmen to receive their reimbursement claim.  Under the\r\n\r\npresent  legislation, only the ORNSman is entitled  to  claim\r\n\r\nreimbursement  for  the  loss of his  civilian  income.   The\r\n\r\nORNSman submits his claim through his employer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF has a new scheme called the Payment Through\r\n\r\nEmployers  Scheme.  This scheme aims to reduce paperwork  and\r\n\r\nsimplify  procedures  for ORNSmen and  their  employers  when\r\n\r\nmaking  a  claim  for  loss  of income  resulting  from  ORNS\r\n\r\ntraining.   Under this scheme, the employer will continue  to\r\n\r\npay  his  ORNSmen  employees their monthly  salary  when  the\r\n\r\nORNSmen   attend  training.   The  employer  then   makes   a\r\n\r\nconsolidated  claim  to the designated  authority  to  obtain\r\n\r\nreimbursement.   This  seamless system  will  result  in  the\r\n\r\nORNSman not having to suffer any disruption in receiving  his\r\n\r\nsalary  income.  He will also not have to put in a claim  for\r\n\r\nreimbursement  for  the loss of his civilian  income  to  the\r\n\r\ndesignated authority through his employer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to the Act will formally put in place this\r\n\r\nstreamlined procedure, with employers given the right to  opt\r\n\r\nfor this scheme of direct payment to their ORNSmen employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill allows for the composition of\r\n\r\ncertain  offences  under the Enlistment Act and  regulations.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  present  legislation, those who  commit  offences\r\n\r\nunder  the  Enlistment Act and regulations are prosecuted  in\r\n\r\nthe  civil  courts.  The proposed amendments will  allow  the\r\n\r\nproper  authority  to  compound certain  offences  under  the\r\n\r\nEnlistment Act\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand its regulations. This will save the time and resources of\r\n\r\nthe court and prosecution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of composition for offences under the\r\n\r\nEnlistment  Act  will be a maximum of $1,000.   For  offences\r\n\r\nunder the Enlistment Regulations, the maximum will be $500.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill also allows the appointment of\r\n\r\nenlistment inspectors and sets out their powers.  The Follow-up and Investigation Unit, or the IU, of the Central Manpower\r\n\r\nBase investigates offences committed under the Enlistment Act\r\n\r\nand  its  regulations.  The IU needs to be equipped with  the\r\n\r\npowers  of arrest and investigations, similar to those  found\r\n\r\nin  the  Criminal  Procedure Code and the Evidence  Act.   As\r\n\r\nsuch,  the  IU  was previously formed as an Auxiliary  Police\r\n\r\nForce,  or  an APF.  However, an APF can only operate  within\r\n\r\nspecifically  identified areas.  The IU, on the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nhas to conduct investigations throughout Singapore.  This  is\r\n\r\nbeyond the ambit of an APF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment allows the proper authority to appoint\r\n\r\npublic  officers as investigators to be known  as  enlistment\r\n\r\ninspectors.   They will be empowered to investigate  offences\r\n\r\ncommitted  under  the Enlistment Act and  regulations.   They\r\n\r\nalso  will have powers of search, seizure and arrest.   These\r\n\r\npowers may be exercised anywhere in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 makes related amendments to the Singapore Armed\r\n\r\nForces  Act  or  the  SAF Act.  Servicemen,  whether  ORNSmen\r\n\r\nduring  their  in-camp training or former regular  servicemen\r\n\r\nduring  their service, who commit military offences,  may  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to report for trial after they have finished  their\r\n\r\nin-camp  training or their regular service. Trial here  means\r\n\r\nthe  court  martial or a summary trial.  Those  who  fail  or\r\n\r\nrefuse  to  report  for  such  trials  currently  cannot   be\r\n\r\nprosecuted  for a military offence under the SAF Act  because\r\n\r\nthey  are not subject to military law when the order to  them\r\n\r\nto report is given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, those persons who fail or refuse to report\r\n\r\nfor  trial  may only be prosecuted in the civil courts  under\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPenal Code (section 174), that is, for the non-attendance  in\r\n\r\nobedience to an order from a public servant.  As the  failure\r\n\r\nor  refusal  to  report  for trial is  a  disciplinary  issue\r\n\r\nrelated to the SAF, MINDEF believes the SAF should be able to\r\n\r\ndeal directly with such disobedience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments make it a military offence if an ORNSman\r\n\r\nor a former regular serviceman does not report for trial when\r\n\r\nordered to do so by the competent authority.  This will be so\r\n\r\neven  though he is not subject to military law when the order\r\n\r\nto report for such trial is given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament is requested to approve the amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the GPC for\r\n\r\nDefence and Foreign Affairs supports this Bill.  It is timely\r\n\r\nindeed  to  amend the Enlistment Act which was instituted  in\r\n\r\n1970.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, generations of national servicemen have been\r\n\r\ntrained to bear arms.  National service is now very much part\r\n\r\nand  parcel  of  the  Singaporean  way  of  life.   With  our\r\n\r\nexperience  over  the  years and  cycles  of  training,  both\r\n\r\nlocally  and  overseas, we are now in a  better  position  to\r\n\r\nredefine  and  fine-tune the procedures  for  enlistment  and\r\n\r\nnational service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National servicemen and their employers would definitely\r\n\r\nwelcome and embrace the streamlined and simplified method for\r\n\r\nclaiming  make-up pay. Such exemplary cut in red tape  should\r\n\r\nbe followed and emulated by other Government agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, all national servicemen would welcome the\r\n\r\nredefinition of civilian remuneration to include bonuses  and\r\n\r\nany relevant pay components.  This ensures\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  Operationally Ready National Servicemen will  not  lose\r\n\r\nout when they go for their in-camp training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also welcome the provision for compounding\r\n\r\ncertain offences under the Enlistment Act. This will simplify\r\n\r\nthe  procedures, and save time and resources of the court and\r\n\r\nthe  personnel  involved.  I wish to  ask  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nexamples and categories of offences that will be compounded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree that a national serviceman called up to\r\n\r\nanswer charges and attend trial for alleged offences while he\r\n\r\nwas  subject to military law should not be entitled to  claim\r\n\r\nreimbursement   or   compensation  for   loss   of   civilian\r\n\r\nremuneration.  But if the national serviceman is subsequently\r\n\r\nacquitted, will he be eligible to claim for loss of  civilian\r\n\r\nremuneration  for  the  time he spent in  attending  military\r\n\r\ncourt?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, I thank Dr Ong Chit Chung\r\n\r\nfor  his  comments.  He has raised two questions.  The  first\r\n\r\nquestion  is:   what  are  some examples  and  categories  of\r\n\r\noffence  that  will  be compounded?  Sir,  some  examples  of\r\n\r\noffences that will be compounded are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the failure of an ORNSman to notify the proper\r\n\r\nauthority before he leaves Singapore;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the failure of an ORNSman to maintain contact with\r\n\r\nhis unit; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the failure of an exit permit holder to report\r\n\r\nto  the  proper authority within seven days of his return  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some categories of offences that will be compounded are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) exit permit offences;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) registration offences; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) offences relating to the disclosure of\r\n\r\nparticulars by an NS registrant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question asked by Dr Ong is: if an ORNSman\r\n\r\nis called up to answer\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncharges  and attend trial for alleged offences while  he  was\r\n\r\nsubject  to  military law, will he be eligible to  claim  for\r\n\r\nloss  of  civilian remuneration for the time spent  attending\r\n\r\nmilitary  court  if he is acquitted?  Sir,  ORNSmen  who  are\r\n\r\ncalled up to perform national service are entitled to make  a\r\n\r\nclaim for the loss of civilian remuneration for the period of\r\n\r\ntheir  call-up.   When  an ORNSman is  called  up  to  answer\r\n\r\ncharges and attend trial, he is called up for the purposes of\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  proceedings and to answer  the  charge  against\r\n\r\nhim.   He  is  not  called  up to perform  national  service.\r\n\r\nTherefore, whether the ORNSman is convicted or acquitted,  he\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  entitled  to  claim  for  loss  of  civilian\r\n\r\nremuneration  for  the time spent attending the  disciplinary\r\n\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE LAND AUTHORITY BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  beg  to  move, \"That the Bill be now read  a  Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, earlier this year, the Government announced that\r\n\r\nfour  land  departments of the Ministry of Law,  namely,  the\r\n\r\nLand   Office,  the  Singapore  Land  Registry,  the   Survey\r\n\r\nDepartment and the Land Systems Support Unit would be  merged\r\n\r\nto  form  a  new statutory board on 1st June 2001 called  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Land  Authority.   This  Bill  before  the   House\r\n\r\nprovides for the establishment of this new statutory board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these four land departments, the Land Office leases\r\n\r\nand alienates State land and acquires land for the State.  It\r\n\r\nalso  maintains and manages the State land stock.   The  Land\r\n\r\nRegistry  registers transactions affecting land,  issues  and\r\n\r\nguarantees land titles and their tenure,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  provides  land-ownership and related  information.   The\r\n\r\nSurvey Department provides cadastral survey plans of land and\r\n\r\nbuildings,  maintains  and  updates  the  cadastral  maps  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  provides geo-spatial information.   The  Land\r\n\r\nSystems  Support Unit maintains a national land data hub  and\r\n\r\nmanages  the  infrastructure  for  sharing  and  distributing\r\n\r\ndigitised land data among public agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of setting up the Singapore Land Authority\r\n\r\nis  to  streamline functions and to optimise land  resources.\r\n\r\nIt  is  better than having four separate departments carrying\r\n\r\nout different roles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's land resources are limited. As our\r\n\r\npopulation increases, more of our island would be  built  up.\r\n\r\nWe need to manage the land better and put in place mechanisms\r\n\r\nto  intensify the use of land that is already built up, so as\r\n\r\nto ensure sufficient land to cater for our future needs.  The\r\n\r\nSLA  will  not own the State land stock, as these lands  will\r\n\r\nremain  with the State.  But SLA will be the land  management\r\n\r\nagent  for  the State.  In this role, it will make  available\r\n\r\nland for residential, commercial, educational, institutional,\r\n\r\nsocial and other purposes having regard to the Concept  Plan.\r\n\r\nIt will manage and optimise land use.  The SLA will work with\r\n\r\nthe  planning  agencies as well as private sector  bodies  to\r\n\r\nidentify  new  uses,  develop rights concerning  State  land,\r\n\r\noptimise efficiencies of every transaction and allocate  more\r\n\r\nland based on sound economic principles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the formation of the SLA, we will have a more\r\n\r\nflexible   framework  for  implementing   Government's   land\r\n\r\npolicies  and plans to optimise land use.  The SLA will  also\r\n\r\nenable   one   regulatory  body  to  provide   authoritative,\r\n\r\ncomprehensive and easily accessible land information and land\r\n\r\nmanagement  systems.  Better land information and  management\r\n\r\nwill,  in turn, enhance the State's ability to optimise  land\r\n\r\nuse,  ensure  appropriate returns on the  land  and  maintain\r\n\r\nconfidence in the land administration system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SLA is a necessary infrastructure to support the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the forthcoming 2001 Concept Plan for  land\r\n\r\nuse.  Master planning of land use will remain a core function\r\n\r\nunder  the URA.  SLA will, however, complement the  land  use\r\n\r\nplanning   system   by  implementing  more   efficient   land\r\n\r\nadministration  functions such as land  alienation,  leasing,\r\n\r\nland  acquisition, management of tenancies and vacant  lands.\r\n\r\nThis  way,  it can support the central planning agencies  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment  authorities to better  realise  their  land  use\r\n\r\nplans.  It will also help to better achieve a balance between\r\n\r\neconomic  development, flexibility for  physical  renewal  of\r\n\r\nproperties, social growth and cohesion and the protection  of\r\n\r\nour nature reserves and parklands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may now turn to the key aspects of the Bill,\r\n\r\nclause  5 of the Bill, read together with the First Schedule,\r\n\r\nprovides  the constitution of the Board of Directors  of  the\r\n\r\nAuthority.   The Minister for Law will appoint  the  Chairman\r\n\r\nand  directors  of  the Board.  The Chief  Executive  of  the\r\n\r\nAuthority  will  be  appointed  with  the  approval  of   the\r\n\r\nMinister, under clause 11.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 sets out the mission and functions of the\r\n\r\nAuthority.    The  Authority  shall  be  charged   with   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  optimising  scarce  land  resources,  and\r\n\r\ndeveloping a supporting land information infrastructure.  Its\r\n\r\nbroad functions will be to advise the Government on all land-related  matters, including acquisition, allocation,  tenures\r\n\r\nand disposal of State lands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 sets out the powers of the Authority. Among\r\n\r\nother  things,  the  Authority  will  be  empowered  to  form\r\n\r\ncompanies and participate in joint ventures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 sets out the power of the Authority to request\r\n\r\nfor land related information.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 11 to 13 pertain to appointments of the Chief\r\n\r\nExecutive, officers and employees of the Authority.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 14 to 21 are the financial provisions. The main\r\n\r\nsource  of funding for the Authority will be in the  form  of\r\n\r\nfees for services and other functions performed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 22 to 28 provide for the transfer of property,\r\n\r\nassets,   liabilities  and  employees   to   the   Authority.\r\n\r\nProperty, assets and liabilities, as may be determined by the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance, will be transferred to the  Authority.\r\n\r\nAbout 500 Ministry of Law employees, currently working in the\r\n\r\nfour  land departments, will be transferred to the SLA.  They\r\n\r\nwill  be  transferred on terms not less favourable than  what\r\n\r\nthey are enjoying immediately before the transfer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 29 to 38 are general provisions. Clause 35\r\n\r\nprovides for the preservation of secrecy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, Sir, let me repeat that land is a scarce\r\n\r\nresource  which  has an important role in Singapore's  social\r\n\r\nand  economic development.  It is vital therefore that we  be\r\n\r\nproactive  and  innovative  in  optimising  land.   The   new\r\n\r\nstatutory  board, the SLA, will be nimble and  innovative  to\r\n\r\nrespond to changing needs for land in the overall context  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's economic development in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am,\r\n\r\ngenerally, in support of the Bill.  I think it is timely  and\r\n\r\nwelcome  to  bring  the different functions  under  different\r\n\r\nMinistries  under  a  central authority  for  efficiency  and\r\n\r\nconsistency, as a manager.  And, of course, there must  be  a\r\n\r\nclose  linkage,  as  the  Minister  has  emphasised,  of  the\r\n\r\nplanning agencies and Concept Plan under the URA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point though relates mainly to one thing, and\r\n\r\nthis  is the power to act as an agent of Government for  land\r\n\r\nacquisition.   I  believe the power is set out  under  clause\r\n\r\n6(1)(e).   I  want  to  ask  the  Minister  whether  the  new\r\n\r\nAuthority  will be able to consider policies for  acquisition\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompensation  to  private owners.   Basically,  my  point  of\r\n\r\ncontention  is  whether it is now timely that our  policy  of\r\n\r\ncompulsory  acquisition should now be a policy of  compulsory\r\n\r\npurchase.   What  I  mean  by this,  Sir,  is  that  in  some\r\n\r\ncountries,  private owners have a right  to  say  no  to  the\r\n\r\ngovernment.  And this, of course, is different in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  our  national  need  to  develop  public  goods,\r\n\r\nhighways,  etc.   I think, in this sense, where  there  is  a\r\n\r\nnational  good  at stake, compulsion should still  be  there.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there is a question of price, and the cost  imposed\r\n\r\non private owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our policy today is that we pay a historically-based price. In the past, this has led to some loss for\r\n\r\nprivate  owners.  Clearly, today, the Government  has  strong\r\n\r\nfinancial   reserves.   And  should  we  not   then   acquire\r\n\r\ncompulsorily  but at market rates?  This is what  I  mean  by\r\n\r\ncompulsory purchase, rather than compulsory acquisition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am moved to ask this question because, in recent\r\n\r\ntimes,   Government  has  increasingly  given  out  ex-gratia\r\n\r\npayments  where  there  are  certain  special  circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhile  this does justice to some individual cases,  this  may\r\n\r\nlead  to  untidiness, because why do some cases get ex-gratia\r\n\r\npayments,  and why not others.  Sir, I wonder whether  it  is\r\n\r\nnow timely to relook at the policy as a whole.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, as I said in my Second Reading\r\n\r\nspeech, this Bill is really to enable the formation of a  new\r\n\r\nstatutory board.  Its provisions do not have anything  to  do\r\n\r\nwith  the substantive law or policy on land acquisition.   It\r\n\r\ndoes  not  increase the powers presently contained under  the\r\n\r\nlaw  on  land acquisition.  And the proposed statutory board,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Land Authority, will not have any  independent\r\n\r\npowers of land acquisition.  The SLA will be an agent of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, but the power to acquire land continues  to  vest\r\n\r\nin the Government.  In that sense, there is no real change in\r\n\r\nthe  passing  of  this new Bill concerning land  acquisition.\r\n\r\nThat being the case, I am not sure whether this would be  the\r\n\r\nright time to have a detailed debate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  land acquisition policy.  But I would be happy to  engage\r\n\r\nin  a debate with the Member or other Members if they want to\r\n\r\nhave a detailed exchange of views on land acquisition policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, let me just make only some\r\n\r\ngeneral  comments.  Whatever the position  may  be  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  land in Singapore is a special case,  because  of\r\n\r\nthe  scarcity  of land.  The Land Acquisition Act  which  has\r\n\r\nserved  us  well in the past will continue to be  needed.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the general approach in land acquisition has  served\r\n\r\nus well.  It will still be needed, because, as I have said in\r\n\r\nthis  House some years ago, it is not a position of us  never\r\n\r\nhaving projects in the future in the public interest where we\r\n\r\nmay need to acquire land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is on the compensation approach. We have\r\n\r\nreviewed  the statutory date from time to time, and  now  the\r\n\r\nstatutory date is 1995.  Although that is the case,  we  have\r\n\r\nalso provided for ex-gratia payments, and we have revised the\r\n\r\nex-gratia payments from time to time, to make sure  that  any\r\n\r\nhardship   which  may  be  encountered  by  the  compensation\r\n\r\nquantum, is reduced.  I believe that the compensation package\r\n\r\nwas   announced  in this House. This is not a static  matter.\r\n\r\nWe  will  continuously  review the position  under  the  Land\r\n\r\nAcquisition  Act.   In particular, we will review  the  total\r\n\r\npackage under the ex-gratia scheme and see whether there is a\r\n\r\nneed  to increase the payments to be made under the ex-gratia\r\n\r\nscheme.   And  if need be, we will announce whatever  changes\r\n\r\nthat  are  necessary.   Basically, we do  take  into  account\r\n\r\nwhatever  hardships that  may be caused.  But at the  end  of\r\n\r\nthe day, in Singapore, we cannot adopt the approach which may\r\n\r\nbe  prevalent  in other countries where the authorities  have\r\n\r\nabundant areas of land to take into account for developmental\r\n\r\nneeds.  Ours is a special case, but we are not unaware of the\r\n\r\nproblems caused and we will see whatever we can do to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe hardships.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill.  -  [Prof. S.

I explained that the  foreign\r\n\r\nmedia operate here as a matter of privilege and not of right.\r\n\r\nWe  welcome them to come to Singapore to report on local  and\r\n\r\nregional  developments, based on the principles of  accuracy,\r\n\r\nfairness and balance.  However, they must not engage  in  our\r\n\r\ndomestic politics, as this is the preserve of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1986 Parliament amended the Newspaper and Printing\r\n\r\nPresses  Act  (NPPA) to gazette and limit the circulation  of\r\n\r\nforeign  newspapers which engage in the domestic politics  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This Bill extends the same principles to  foreign\r\n\r\ntelevision  channels which are rebroadcast  in  Singapore  by\r\n\r\nSingapore Cable Vision (SCV).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1995 when SCV began operations, the number of\r\n\r\nforeign channels available to Singaporeans has increased from\r\n\r\na  few to 40 channels today.  Out of these channels, five are\r\n\r\nspecialised   news   channels,   namely,   CNBC   Asia,   CNN\r\n\r\nInternational, BBC World, CTN and Bloomberg.  Subscription to\r\n\r\nSCV   cable  TV  has  also  grown  to  260,000  today.    The\r\n\r\npenetration rate was 26% in January and is expected to exceed\r\n\r\n40%  by 2005.  Clearly cable TV can have a significant impact\r\n\r\non our domestic audience.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rationale for New Rules</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill makes it clear to foreign broadcasters\r\n\r\nthat  whilst  they  can sell their services to  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nthey   should  not  interfere  with  our  domestic  politics.\r\n\r\nForeign  broadcasters are outsiders and not  participants  in\r\n\r\nour political scene.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As outsiders and observers, they can report on\r\n\r\nSingapore.   They  should  do  so factually  and  accurately,\r\n\r\nwithout  bias  or distortion.  However, they  should  not  be\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  local  political issues, or  try  to  influence\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  on such issues.  In our General Elections,  for\r\n\r\nexample, they should not take sides either for or against any\r\n\r\npolitical party or politician in their reporting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our position on this matter is a reasonable one.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  should  decide the fate of  Singapore  and  not\r\n\r\nforeigners.  Foreign broadcasters have no stake in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIf their reporting creates problems, they will not suffer the\r\n\r\nconsequences.   For example, if incendiary  reporting  causes\r\n\r\nracial  riots  and destabilises Singapore, it is Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho suffer as confidence collapses and jobs are lost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other countries like Canada and the UK also have legal\r\n\r\nsafeguards  to  prevent  outside  interference.   The  Canada\r\n\r\nElections  Act  2000  prohibits the  use  of  a  broadcasting\r\n\r\nstation  outside  Canada by any person  for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\ninfluencing  an election in Canada.  The Act also  stipulates\r\n\r\nthat  no  foreigner should try to influence voters during  an\r\n\r\nelection in Canada.  The UK Representation of the People  Act\r\n\r\n1983 similarly prohibits any person from using a broadcasting\r\n\r\nstation  outside the UK to influence an election in  the  UK.\r\n\r\nSuch  programmes  can only be carried by  local  broadcasters\r\n\r\nwhich  are subject to a legal duty and a code of practice  to\r\n\r\nbe politically impartial.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Engaging in Domestic Politics</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore the NPPA has set the ground rules for\r\n\r\nforeign  newspapers  to  operate here.   Many  of  them  have\r\n\r\nsizeable\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncirculation in Singapore.  This policy of non-interference in\r\n\r\ndomestic  politics  and  our right of reply  are  established\r\n\r\npolicies  which over the years the foreign publications  have\r\n\r\ncome around to accept.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notion of what constitutes \"engaging in the domestic\r\n\r\npolitics  of  Singapore\" in the NPPA was tested in  court  in\r\n\r\n1989.   The  High  Court  ruled  that  reports  or  editorial\r\n\r\ncomments  which went beyond what was factual could amount  to\r\n\r\n\"engaging  in domestic politics\", if they were  made  with  a\r\n\r\nview  to  espouse  political ideas  or  to  influence  public\r\n\r\nopinion.  The court also explained that the provision in  the\r\n\r\nNPPA made clear that the domestic politics of Singapore is  a\r\n\r\nmatter reserved for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment to the SBA Act follows similar\r\n\r\nprinciples.   As  provided  in the Bill,  the  Minister  will\r\n\r\ndecide whether a foreign broadcasting service is \"engaging in\r\n\r\ndomestic  politics\".  This will be based  on  reasonable  and\r\n\r\nproper grounds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate with some examples. The first example\r\n\r\nis  a foreign broadcaster which denies Singapore the right of\r\n\r\nreply to inaccurate, biased, or distorted reporting of issues\r\n\r\nconcerning Singapore.  A second example is one which conducts\r\n\r\npolitical  broadcasts such as advertising directed towards  a\r\n\r\npolitical end or programmes featuring any politician who pays\r\n\r\nthe broadcaster or is paid by the broadcaster, or remunerated\r\n\r\nin  other ways, to appear in the broadcast.  A third  example\r\n\r\nis  a foreign broadcaster which conducts broadcasts made with\r\n\r\na  view  to  espouse political ideas or to  influence  public\r\n\r\nopinion  in Singapore.  All these can be deemed as  \"engaging\r\n\r\nin  domestic politics\".  A decision has to be made  based  on\r\n\r\nthe  particular circumstances of the case and this  may  vary\r\n\r\naccording to time and context.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to SBA Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight some aspects of the Bill. Under\r\n\r\nthe   new  section  42A,  subsection  (1)  will  empower  the\r\n\r\nMinister,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby  order  published in the Gazette, to declare  any  foreign\r\n\r\nbroadcasting  service  carried  on  any  relevant  licensable\r\n\r\nbroadcasting service as engaging in the domestic politics  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Subsection  (2) requires  the  Minister's  prior\r\n\r\napproval  for  any  person to rebroadcast  in  Singapore  any\r\n\r\ndeclared   foreign  broadcasting  service.   Subsection   (3)\r\n\r\nempowers   the   Minister  to  approve  the  rebroadcast   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, subject to such conditions as he thinks fit, or he\r\n\r\nmay refuse or revoke such approval.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under subsection (4), the Minister may restrict the\r\n\r\nnumber of persons who may receive the service and may suspend\r\n\r\nthe  service  for a specified period.  Under subsection  (5),\r\n\r\nthe  penalty  for contravening subsection (2) or  failing  to\r\n\r\ncomply  with a condition imposed under subsection (3a)  is  a\r\n\r\nfine not exceeding $100,000 upon conviction.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Scope of coverage</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment will apply to foreign broadcasters carried\r\n\r\non  SCV's  cable  network.  However, with rapid  advances  in\r\n\r\ntechnology,  there will be new ways of delivering  television\r\n\r\nservices.   Where appropriate we could in future  include  as\r\n\r\nlicensable broadcasting services other broadcasting platforms\r\n\r\nwhen  they become relevant, but for now the amendments  apply\r\n\r\nonly to foreign broadcasting services carried on SCV.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, we welcome foreign broadcasters to\r\n\r\nbroadcast   in  or  from  Singapore.   We  will  extend   all\r\n\r\nfacilities to help them operate successfully here.   However,\r\n\r\nthose  who  broadcast to Singapore audiences  should  provide\r\n\r\nobjective  and  accurate reporting  and  not  engage  in  the\r\n\r\ndomestic  politics  of Singapore.  If a  foreign  broadcaster\r\n\r\nchooses  to  abuse the privilege, it will have to suffer  the\r\n\r\nfinancial penalty of a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrestriction in distribution or advertising in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to support the Bill.  I understand the rationale for the\r\n\r\nproposed  amendments to the Singapore Broadcasting  Authority\r\n\r\nAct  requiring  that foreign broadcasters should  not  engage\r\n\r\nthemselves  in  our domestic politics, as  the  Minister  has\r\n\r\nsaid,  as  this  is the preserve of Singaporeans.   The  Bill\r\n\r\nbasically  amends the SBA Act to bring it in  line  with  the\r\n\r\nNewspaper  and  Printing Presses Act (last amended  in  1986)\r\n\r\nregarding the role of foreign media in our domestic politics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore anticipate little problems in its\r\n\r\nimplementation as I believe over the years, the foreign media\r\n\r\nhave come around to accept our policy on their involvement in\r\n\r\nour  domestic  politics, the need for accurate and  objective\r\n\r\nreporting and our right of reply.  However, I would  like  to\r\n\r\naddress  this  Bill by looking at its economic  impact,  both\r\n\r\ndirectly  and  indirectly, on Singapore and  our  efforts  to\r\n\r\npromote Singapore as a media hub in Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our drive to be a media hub in Asia, we have been\r\n\r\nsuccessful in recent years in attracting a number of  foreign\r\n\r\nbroadcasters to set up shop in Singapore, including Discovery\r\n\r\nChannel,  MTV Asia and CNBC Asia.  Singapore is now  able  to\r\n\r\ncompete   strongly   with  foreign  broadcasters   who   have\r\n\r\npreviously  located  themselves in Hong Kong,  Australia  and\r\n\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we have managed to market ourselves as such,\r\n\r\nleveraged  on our strategic location, advanced communications\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  and  availability  of  skilled  and  creative\r\n\r\nmanpower,  we have already created the platform  for  a  more\r\n\r\nsustainable drive to achieve our aim to be the media  hub  in\r\n\r\nAsia.  Indeed, this has led to positive economic activity and\r\n\r\ngrowth in recent years, in both our broadcasting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  well as the media entertainment industries, both of which\r\n\r\nhave  benefited  greatly  from  the  participation  of  these\r\n\r\nforeign broadcasters in our local media scene.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this time of potential economic downturn, the\r\n\r\ndirect job creation as a result of our media hub policy,  the\r\n\r\nexposure  of  our  local talents who are  working  for  these\r\n\r\nforeign broadcasters, and the ability to attract creative and\r\n\r\ntalented foreigners who are now based in Singapore, have  all\r\n\r\ncontributed  positively to our economy.  In addition,  direct\r\n\r\ncompetition  from foreign broadcasters based here,  has  also\r\n\r\nforced  our  local broadcasters to upgrade their  skills  and\r\n\r\nservices  and improve standards.  The success of our  Channel\r\n\r\nNews  Asia  is  a testament to the fruits of this  policy  in\r\n\r\nrecent years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, Sir, I am concerned whether the introduction of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  though  it has its social  merits,  will  affect\r\n\r\nSingapore's ongoing efforts to be the regional media hub  and\r\n\r\nbroadcasting centre.  I understand that the immediate  impact\r\n\r\nmay  be  limited  as there are still only a small  number  of\r\n\r\nforeign  broadcasters based here.  However, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nask if the Ministry has assessed the potential impact of this\r\n\r\nBill  on  our   efforts  currently underway  to  promote  and\r\n\r\ndevelop  our  media hub strategy.  Has the Ministry  made  an\r\n\r\nassessment  of the economic impact if potential entrants  and\r\n\r\ninvestments  to Singapore in this industry are deterred  from\r\n\r\ncompleting projects, starting new ones, or even slowing their\r\n\r\nparticipation here?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An observation that has been reflected by critics even\r\n\r\nin our local press is that, whilst the impact of the Bill may\r\n\r\nappear  insignificant and negligible financially, it  carries\r\n\r\nother implications, not least the suggestion that it is a key\r\n\r\npiece of the Government's pre-election jigsaw puzzle.  Whilst\r\n\r\nI  do  not subscribe to this view, I recognise that the  Bill\r\n\r\nmay  potentially send a wrong signal to foreign  broadcasters\r\n\r\nwho  are  considering setting up shop here.  Worse,  existing\r\n\r\nones  may even wish to pull out totally from Singapore.  This\r\n\r\nis  anathema  to  what we are trying to do  to  develop  this\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Sir, I support the Bill and will be grateful\r\n\r\nif the Minister would give his comments on these observations\r\n\r\nand perhaps reassure the House that the Bill would not affect\r\n\r\nSingapore's  hard  won  status  as  an  emerging  media   and\r\n\r\nbroadcasting hub.  In addition, it would be important to many\r\n\r\ninterested   parties   who   are   closely   watching   these\r\n\r\ndevelopments,  if  the  Minister  would  reaffirm  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  remains committed to promoting  the  broadcasting\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the\r\n\r\nintroduction   of   the   Singapore  Broadcasting   Authority\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill is because we are opening our media  to  the\r\n\r\noutside world.  Whenever people talk about opening the  media\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, most people will associate it with the  coming\r\n\r\nhot battle between MediaCorp and Singapore Press Holdings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, the opening up of our media started in the\r\n\r\n1980s, that is, the opening of our media to the outside world\r\n\r\nwhen   we  allowed  foreign  publications  to  circulate   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.    Since  1995,  we  have  also  allowed   foreign\r\n\r\ntelevision stations into the homes of every Singaporean  with\r\n\r\nthe  introduction  of cable vision.  As  a  matter  of  fact,\r\n\r\nseriously  speaking, the opening of our media to the  outside\r\n\r\nworld  started  even earlier than its opening to our domestic\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if we were to tell the foreigners that there\r\n\r\nare  some  40 foreign television channels and a few  thousand\r\n\r\nforeign publications available in Singapore, many of them may\r\n\r\nnot  believe  us.  They would ask, \"Is it  true?   Isn't  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Government  keeping  a  very  tight  control   on\r\n\r\neverything?  Do you not have a ban on chewing  gum  and  even\r\n\r\ninstall  urine detectors in the lifts of your public  housing\r\n\r\nestates to catch people urinating there? And, of course,  you\r\n\r\nrestrict the circulation of foreign publications!\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed the gap between reality and image. The\r\n\r\nmain  reason  for  the existence of such a gap  is  that  the\r\n\r\nforeign media often make criticism against some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof the Singapore Government's policies.  Our policy all along\r\n\r\nhas  been   that  we  want to have a rule-by-law  society  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and there are certain social values which we  want\r\n\r\nto uphold.  The foreign media can criticise our policies, but\r\n\r\nthey are not allowed to interfere in our domestic politics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most fundamental principle. Some people may\r\n\r\nfeel  that  we  are behind time when we apply the  rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations  governing  the press in  the  80s  to  the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury  television media.  My view is that while times  have\r\n\r\nchanged, and technology has changed the mode of operation  of\r\n\r\nthe  media,  there  are  some basic  principles  that  remain\r\n\r\nunchanged.   All the countries in the world agree  that  they\r\n\r\nshould not interfere in one another's domestic politics.  Why\r\n\r\ncannot  we  stop  the foreign media from interfering  in  our\r\n\r\ndomestic  politics?  Foreign journalists can  be  Singapore's\r\n\r\npolitical  observers, but they should not be participants  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's politics.  This fundamental principle will  never\r\n\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the western media talk about freedom of the press,\r\n\r\nthey  always  talk plausibly and at length.    But  from  the\r\n\r\nexamples  of what had happened in Singapore in the  past,  we\r\n\r\ncan  tell  that  they  are having double standards  in  their\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  freedom.  The foreign media  would  use  some\r\n\r\nunreliable  and inaccurate data to distort the  facts.   When\r\n\r\nour  Government  demanded a verification, and even  suggested\r\n\r\npurchasing  advertising space to refute all these  fallacious\r\n\r\nreports, they refused.   Our Newspapers and Printing  Presses\r\n\r\nAct   prohibits   foreign  newspapers  from  interfering   in\r\n\r\nSingapore's political affairs.   This Act has been  in  force\r\n\r\nfor  many  years.  It is clearly understood  by  the  foreign\r\n\r\nmedia.    They  can  report anything in accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nfacts  of  the  matter.  They can comment,  but  they  cannot\r\n\r\ndistort  the facts.  They are not allowed to  participate  in\r\n\r\nor  influence  our  politics.   Otherwise, their  circulation\r\n\r\nwould  be  restricted,   and in cases of  serious  violation,\r\n\r\ntheir permit will be revoked.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the extension of this principle to apply to\r\n\r\nthe  foreign television media.  The foreign television  media\r\n\r\ncan  report  on  the politics of Singapore,  comment  on  our\r\n\r\npolitics,  but  they should not participate in  our  domestic\r\n\r\npolitics and influence our people's decision on our political\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this amendment to the Singapore Broadcasting\r\n\r\nAuthority Act, they will once again criticise us of having no\r\n\r\npress  freedom here.   I would like to ask the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nInformation  and  the  Arts what plans his  Ministry  has  to\r\n\r\npromote   Singapore's image in terms of media  opening.   Our\r\n\r\nlong-term plan of developing Singapore into a regional  media\r\n\r\nhub  should  not  be  hampered by the  introduction  of  this\r\n\r\nAmendment Bill.  Our image should not be tarnished.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember in 1986, when the Newspapers and Printing\r\n\r\nPresses  Act  was  introduced, the western media  pointed  an\r\n\r\naccusing  finger  on us and claimed that  this  was  a  clear\r\n\r\nevidence of the lack of press freedom in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989, the then Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew,\r\n\r\npersonally went to the United States of America to meet face-to-face with more than 300 international journalists.  I  was\r\n\r\nthen  one of the journalists in our Singapore delegation.   I\r\n\r\ndiscovered  that  many of these journalists  did  not  really\r\n\r\nunderstand the situation in Singapore.  They could  only  say\r\n\r\nthat  by  restricting the circulation of  a  certain  foreign\r\n\r\npublication we were violating the principle of press freedom.\r\n\r\nThey asked why was it that in Asia, places like India and the\r\n\r\nPhilippines  could  have press freedom, but  Singapore  could\r\n\r\nnot.   Prime  Minister Lee Kuan Yew's  reply  was    that  he\r\n\r\nunderstood   Singapore  better.   The  US   model   was   not\r\n\r\nuniversally  applicable and valid everywhere.  The  media  of\r\n\r\nthe   various  countries  play  different  roles   in   their\r\n\r\nrespective  countries,  owing to their  different  historical\r\n\r\nexperience,  political systems and makings of  their  people.\r\n\r\nThe  function  represented  by  their  civilisation  and  the\r\n\r\nfunction  manifested  by the media in different  environments\r\n\r\nare equally effective.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when we are opening up our media to the\r\n\r\noutside  world,  the introduction of this Amendment  Bill  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  and  important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I had not intended to speak on this Bill,  but\r\n\r\nafter  hearing the Minister throw the terms \"non-interference\r\n\r\nwith domestic politics\" and \"objective reporting\", I was very\r\n\r\ntempted  to  ask  him whether he would try  and  define  more\r\n\r\nclearly  what interference in domestic politics is  this  all\r\n\r\nabout, and what does he consider to be \"objective reporting\".\r\n\r\nAnd  does he think or does the Ministry think that it accords\r\n\r\nwith natural justice that a Minister of the Government should\r\n\r\nbe  the one to decide these questions?  Is it not contrary to\r\n\r\ncommonsense and rationality?  One cannot be the judge and the\r\n\r\nprosecutor at the same time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Ministry must have this Bill, will it consider\r\n\r\nsetting  up  what they have in other countries, ie,  a  press\r\n\r\ncouncil  -  perhaps, in Singapore, a Press  and  Broadcasting\r\n\r\nCouncil - not just consisting of the Minister alone or anyone\r\n\r\nappointed  by  the  Minister, but a council  drawn  from  the\r\n\r\npublicity  media  and from other professional  organisations,\r\n\r\nwhich  will then decide whether any report in the papers,  on\r\n\r\nTV  or  radio is objective or not objective, and  whether  it\r\n\r\namounts to interference in domestic politics?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, we are a small country. We are a\r\n\r\nyoung  society with different ethnic, language and  religious\r\n\r\ngroups.  Our society can be torn into\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npieces  if  race,  language  or religion  is  played  up  and\r\n\r\nexploited   by  anyone.   We  have  tried  to   ensure   that\r\n\r\nSingapore's  destiny is determined only by Singaporeans.   We\r\n\r\nhave always been wary of foreigners getting involved in local\r\n\r\npolitics  as their motives and agenda will be very  different\r\n\r\nfrom Singaporeans'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the media play a critical role in any modern\r\n\r\nsociety.  They influence opinions, mould minds, and even have\r\n\r\nthe   ability  to  direct  the  course  of  events.   Foreign\r\n\r\nintelligence  agencies  are known to have  infiltrated  media\r\n\r\norganisations to influence the editorials and the  colour  of\r\n\r\nreporting.   At  times,  western  countries'  foreign  policy\r\n\r\nobjectives are achieved by cleverly feeding the western media\r\n\r\nwith  bias  or slanted facts and incomplete data.  These  are\r\n\r\ncarried   as   factual   reports  by   many   renowned   news\r\n\r\norganisations  without verification, in  many  cases  due  to\r\n\r\nfierce competition and timely reporting.  Even big businesses\r\n\r\nare  known to have penetrated media groups to lobby  business\r\n\r\ninterests and also sabotage Third World countries.  Even some\r\n\r\nglobal  NGOs, democratic foundations and human rights  groups\r\n\r\ncultivate journalists and media owners to project and further\r\n\r\ntheir agenda.  Sir, the western nations know the influence of\r\n\r\nthe  media  and,  in some countries, have imposed  conditions\r\n\r\nthat the local media cannot be owned wholly by foreigners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that our Government has already imposed\r\n\r\nthe requirement that the foreign print media cannot engage in\r\n\r\ndomestic  politics.  The proposed amendment in the  Singapore\r\n\r\nBroadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill seeks to  impose  the\r\n\r\nsame  requirement on foreign broadcasters who rebroadcast  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  to  prevent them from engaging  in  the  domestic\r\n\r\npolitics  of  Singapore.  Sir, it is  critical  that  foreign\r\n\r\nbroadcasters be subject to the same conditions as the foreign\r\n\r\nprint  media  as, otherwise, this loophole will  be  cleverly\r\n\r\nexploited by the foreign broadcasters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with cable television, Singaporeans can now receive\r\n\r\nfive channels, namely,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCNBC Asia, CNN, BBC, CTN and Bloomberg.  Subscriptions to SCV\r\n\r\nnow  stand  at 260,000.  The penetration rate is expected  to\r\n\r\nincrease  from 26% to 40% by 2005, as stated by the Minister.\r\n\r\nMultiply  the subscription numbers with the household  number\r\n\r\nof  four  per  family, and the reach becomes  more  than  one\r\n\r\nmillion  people.  Sir, it is timely that this  amendment  has\r\n\r\nbeen  introduced.  It will ensure that the arena for domestic\r\n\r\npolitics in Singapore is only for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I stand to express some misgivings\r\n\r\nabout the Bill.  Let me first consider some of the statements\r\n\r\nmade  by  the Minister in his explanatory remarks introducing\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  for Second Reading.  The Minister, if  I  remember\r\n\r\ncorrectly,  gave examples of laws in Canada and  the  UK.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to point out though that our laws are,  I  think,\r\n\r\nmuch broader than the two examples he has given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as far as I understand those laws - I do not have\r\n\r\nthem in front of me - they deal with foreign broadcasts,  ie,\r\n\r\nbroadcasting   from  outside  the  country  and   that   then\r\n\r\npenetrates inside, a bit like what Voice of America does,  or\r\n\r\na  bit  like  what  most of us can receive from  stations  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Here, however, the Minister wants to target people\r\n\r\nwho  are, with our consent, accessing our cable, and who  may\r\n\r\nhave, in many cases, started up Singapore subsidiaries.   And\r\n\r\nthe  law actually is crafted so broadly it would cover  these\r\n\r\ncompanies  which are Singapore companies, branch offices  and\r\n\r\nother  businesses in Singapore, so long as, according to  new\r\n\r\nsection  42A(6),  they  would  be  considered  to  be  owned,\r\n\r\ncontrolled or managed by somebody outside Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second way in which the laws proposed are broader,\r\n\r\nas compared to the two examples he brought up, was that, if I\r\n\r\nagain  recollect what the Minister said, those laws  targeted\r\n\r\ninfluence  during  the time of election,  whereas  this  Bill\r\n\r\nwould seem to cover media reports year-long,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nany  time, anything.  So, if those two examples are the  ones\r\n\r\nthat  really concerned our Government, we should be targeting\r\n\r\nmuch   more   narrowly  because,  otherwise,   we   do   risk\r\n\r\novershooting  the  mark and having unforeseen  circumstances,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  erosion of our ability to be a credible  media\r\n\r\ncentre, not just for our own media, but for the media we wish\r\n\r\nto attract to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say also I remain to be convinced as to this\r\n\r\nquestion:  why SCV?  It seems to me that is only  because  we\r\n\r\ncan  do it.  It is as simple as turning off a tap.  It  seems\r\n\r\nto  me  that,  really,  the penetration through  airwaves  of\r\n\r\nMalaysian TV is as pervasive, and we are not doing it because\r\n\r\nit  is  harder to do, or politically harder to  do.   But  it\r\n\r\nsmacks  of  inequality, if we really are concerned about  so-called foreigners.  And that comes back to my point: what  is\r\n\r\nthe mischief?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his introductory remarks, the Minister has not\r\n\r\nmentioned   any  particular  case  or  instance   of   recent\r\n\r\nrecollection  that  triggers off our concern  in  introducing\r\n\r\nthese wider powers, and I encourage him to do so, perhaps  in\r\n\r\nhis closing remarks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go on, Sir, to two other levels of the debate. I\r\n\r\nthink  the first of the levels is, how are we going  to  make\r\n\r\nthis  consistent  with  the print media?   The  Minister  has\r\n\r\npointed  out  that  we already have laws  that  give  similar\r\n\r\npowers  over  print  media.  They do have  similar  problems.\r\n\r\nWhat  is the scope of engaging in domestic politics?  I think\r\n\r\nthat  has been a troubling issue for both print and broadcast\r\n\r\nmedia.  There are also, however, additional problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the written media, when we proscribe circulation, we\r\n\r\nstill  allow  limited  copies, say, 1,000  copies,  libraries\r\n\r\nonly.   So  we can face the world which will ask about  these\r\n\r\nlaws.   We  can  face the world and say, \"We  are  not  about\r\n\r\ncircumscribing entirely the freedom of information.   We  are\r\n\r\nabout  trying  to hit you in the pocket place so  you  cannot\r\n\r\nmake money and lie about us at the same time.\"  That was what\r\n\r\nI  understood to be our policy about the print  media.   And,\r\n\r\ntherefore, when we see the measure imposed on print media, it\r\n\r\nis a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlimited circulation.  Sometimes it is 6,000 copies.  I do not\r\n\r\nsee  how this is going to work with SCV.  It is like  a  tap.\r\n\r\nIt  is  going to be either on or off.  We are, in that sense,\r\n\r\ndoing something quite different from the print media.  We are\r\n\r\ngoing to turn off that tap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second level of the debate is, frankly, I am not\r\n\r\nconvinced that we should be expanding this law to cover a new\r\n\r\narea  of  media.  Nor am I when the Minister says  that  when\r\n\r\nthere  is a convergence of other media like the Internet,  we\r\n\r\nmight consider expanding it even further.  I really think  we\r\n\r\nshould  be thinking about going the other way.  We should  be\r\n\r\nreconsidering  whether  we really  need  anymore  to  control\r\n\r\nforeign print media against engaging in our domestic politics\r\n\r\nbecause, Sir, I think our policies have stood us well.  A lot\r\n\r\nof  the  print media have already understood the  lesson.   I\r\n\r\nthink  Singapore  today enjoys a much more  favourable  press\r\n\r\nthan  before.  And my concern is that these laws would  stand\r\n\r\nto  damage  that increased enhanced international reputation,\r\n\r\nreduce our standing as a hub for media of all types and  with\r\n\r\neconomic  impact  on  competition with Hong  Kong  and  other\r\n\r\nplayers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out that, over time, there\r\n\r\nhas  crept in a redundancy in many of the ways our  laws  are\r\n\r\nadministered.  If I understand correctly, sometimes  when  we\r\n\r\nlimit circulation on the print media, we still are above what\r\n\r\ntheir subscription rate is anyway, ie, if our limit is 6,000,\r\n\r\ntheir  active subscribers in Singapore may be 5,000.  And  so\r\n\r\nwe  pay  the penalty for having these laws on the  books  and\r\n\r\nhaving these rubber stamps on the print media, when we really\r\n\r\nare not achieving anything by it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should we do then? I do not think that we should,\r\n\r\nof  course, leave foreigners to run Singapore politics.  That\r\n\r\nis the prerogative of Singaporeans.  But I think what we need\r\n\r\nto do is something quite different.  We have shifted policies\r\n\r\nbefore.   In  the  1970s  and  80s,  we  used  to  throw  out\r\n\r\njournalists - revoked their licences and told them to go away\r\n\r\n-  and  they  went away yelling to everyone  that  they  were\r\n\r\nheroes for having taken on Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNow  it  seems  that we want to de-license  them  and,  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid, the same thing will happen.  I would encourage us  to\r\n\r\ndo  internationally  what we do in this House,  which  is  to\r\n\r\ndebate.   There is increasingly a media that will  cover  our\r\n\r\nGovernment's  side  of  the story.  Our  Government  leaders,\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  Goh Chok Tong and Senior Minister  Lee  Kuan\r\n\r\nYew,  are well-known international figures.  If they wish  to\r\n\r\nspeak,  people  will  listen.  Our own  media,  like  Channel\r\n\r\nNewsAsia  and  Radio  Singapore  International,  these   have\r\n\r\nregional  ambitions  and can help us  project  our  voice  in\r\n\r\naddition to the international media that will listen to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anything, Sir, I would encourage the Minister and the\r\n\r\nGovernment to legislate a right of reply.  This can be  equal\r\n\r\nin  airtime.  And this is done, as far as I understand it, in\r\n\r\nsome  federal laws in the USA for radio and other new  media,\r\n\r\nalthough not newspapers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this light, Sir, in the emphasis on debate, it\r\n\r\ntroubles  me that the proposed section 42A(3)(c)  reads  that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  may  revoke a licence \"without  assigning  any\r\n\r\nreason\".  Sir, if we ever want to revoke a licence, it should\r\n\r\nbe  with reason.  We should go out to defend our position and\r\n\r\nnot  be thought of being too over-sensitive or protecting our\r\n\r\nown narrow self-interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a Singaporean, I do resent unfounded ignorant\r\n\r\ncommentary about our country.  I remember in the early 1990s,\r\n\r\nthere   was  an  Australian  documentary.   I  cannot  really\r\n\r\nremember  its  name, but I remember vividly a visual  of  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  with a voice-over that said that these were  slums  in\r\n\r\nthe  sky.   At  first  I felt very angry,  and  then  I  just\r\n\r\nlaughed.  I think any Singaporean who saw such a documentary,\r\n\r\nwho  hears  such wild lies about Singapore, would  not  think\r\n\r\nless  of  Singapore, because they know Singapore.  They  will\r\n\r\nthink less of the documentary.  And I would urge the Minister\r\n\r\nto narrow these laws and, more, have faith in Singaporeans to\r\n\r\njudge for themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I have just\r\n\r\none  small  point to raise and it relates also  to  something\r\n\r\nthat Mr Simon\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nTay  has  already  spoken on.  With  regard  to  new  section\r\n\r\n42A(3)(c) which prescribes for rebroadcast, the Minister  may\r\n\r\nrevoke his approval at any time without assigning any reason.\r\n\r\nThis  assigning  to Minister the authority to disapprove  and\r\n\r\nrevoke  approvals at any time, and without giving any reason,\r\n\r\nseems  to  be  a favourite clause, not only of this,  but  of\r\n\r\nmany, pieces of legislation passed, and I am sure to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that I have no dispute with the prescription\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister's decision be final.  But that  is  quite\r\n\r\ndifferent  from saying that the Minister does  not  give  any\r\n\r\nreasons at all for that decision.   I think that in this  day\r\n\r\nand  age  in  Singapore, we would surely  wish  to  have  the\r\n\r\nMinister  share his reasons for his decisions.   Firstly,  we\r\n\r\nare  looking at increased transparency and, secondly, related\r\n\r\nto  transparency  so that in fact all parties  involved  will\r\n\r\nhave  an understanding of Government's reasoning and position\r\n\r\nand therefore be guided in their actions and behaviour in the\r\n\r\nfuture.   Finally,  it  can surely only  be  in  the  greater\r\n\r\ninterest  of all that Ministers and their officers  assisting\r\n\r\nand advising them are subject to the rigour and discipline of\r\n\r\nhaving  the  rationale  for their decisions  open  to  public\r\n\r\nscrutiny.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, I agree with the\r\n\r\ngeneral  intention of the Bill because it is not the interest\r\n\r\nof foreign media to interfere or engage in domestic politics.\r\n\r\nBut  the  proposed amendment, as it stands before the  House,\r\n\r\nappears  to  be  very confusing to me.  Under the  Bill,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  simultaneously  the  plaintiff,   judge   and\r\n\r\nexecutioner in disputes with foreign media.  I agree that the\r\n\r\nBill,  as it stands, is very efficient in dealing with  media\r\n\r\nwho  we  can prove to have interfered with domestic politics.\r\n\r\nBut  is  it really effective?  Because as it stands,  it  may\r\n\r\ncreate  a very serious credibility problem simply because  of\r\n\r\nthe  conflict of positions that the Government will be placed\r\n\r\nupon.   Quite often, this negative reporting is directed  and\r\n\r\nintended possibly at the Government who would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  most affected, and if it is for the Government itself  to\r\n\r\nmake  such  a  decision, I think that is  going  to  be  very\r\n\r\nconfusing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, one possible improvement to the Bill is to\r\n\r\nget  an  advisory committee, comprising respected members  of\r\n\r\nthe  society  involved.   MITA has  several  such  committees\r\n\r\nadvising the Minister in dealing with the various media.   An\r\n\r\nexisting committee or new committee can be roped in to advise\r\n\r\nin  the application of gazetting powers.  The Government  can\r\n\r\nsubmit   the  available  evidence  to  the  committee.    The\r\n\r\ncommittee members can then decide first whether the offending\r\n\r\nbroadcaster  or  publication amounts to  an  interference  in\r\n\r\npolitics,  and,  if so, what the appropriate sanctions  would\r\n\r\nbe.  In reality, it is very difficult to decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister would clarify what tantamount\r\n\r\nto  interference  with  local politics.   Take  the  case  of\r\n\r\nelections.   If  a  foreign broadcaster  were  to  portray  a\r\n\r\nparticular  candidate or opposition candidate in good  light,\r\n\r\nwould  that  tantamount to interference with local  politics,\r\n\r\neven  if  it is just a factual story?  We have seen  that  by\r\n\r\nattending briefings given by opposition parties in some cases\r\n\r\nmay  tantamount to interference with local politics.  We have\r\n\r\nto be very clear about the definition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the other question that earlier Members\r\n\r\nraised,  ie, how do you term \"broadcasting service\" where  it\r\n\r\ninvolves  the  print media and how this is available  on  the\r\n\r\nInternet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern I have is how the foreign media will\r\n\r\nhave  an impact on the public opinion of our citizens, and  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  best  person to decide is the  public  themselves\r\n\r\nwhether they have been affected by the kind of reporting that\r\n\r\nis  brought  about  by  the foreign media.   I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nentirely appropriate in this case to have a committee to look\r\n\r\nat it.  Of course, the procedure may mean that the Government\r\n\r\ndoes not always win.  The committee may side with the foreign\r\n\r\nnews organisation and decide that there should be no case for\r\n\r\ngazetting.  When I talk about\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncredibility problem, there is precisely the possibility  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  does not always win that  perhaps  may  give\r\n\r\nitself the credibility, but otherwise the perception is  that\r\n\r\njust  because  the Government is involved with  a  particular\r\n\r\nforeign media, the foreign media has got no chance, it  would\r\n\r\nalways  lose because the final arbiter is the Minister  whose\r\n\r\ndecision  is final, and he does not have to give any  reasons\r\n\r\nfor his decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to raise is that for a\r\n\r\njournalist,  it is sometimes very difficult, even  for  those\r\n\r\nwho are not ideologically partisan, to differentiate what  is\r\n\r\nfact  and  opinion in times like this, and we  cannot  always\r\n\r\nassume,  with  the  new  type of medium,  that  the  existing\r\n\r\npractice  and operation of the media that exist in the  print\r\n\r\nmedia in a newspaper like the Straits Times also exist in the\r\n\r\nother  types  of  media.   They are  fast,  they  are  easily\r\n\r\naccessible, people can write stories now and get published in\r\n\r\nthe very next minute.  There is a clear possibility of honest\r\n\r\nmistake to be made.  This is where a certain sense of balance\r\n\r\ngot  to  be exercised.  It is good if the Minister is advised\r\n\r\nby  a  committee so that such a balance and fair play can  be\r\n\r\nseen to be exercised by the Minister and the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item of business under\r\n\r\ndiscussion  and  the remaining items on the Order  Paper  for\r\n\r\ntoday  be  exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions\r\n\r\nof Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE BROADCASTING AUTHORITY (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, I wish to thank Members who have\r\n\r\nspoken in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My general impression is that although there are some\r\n\r\nmisgivings,  by  and  large,  all  those  who  have   spoken,\r\n\r\nincluding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npossibly Mr Jeyaretnam, agree that foreigners should  not  be\r\n\r\nallowed to interfere in our domestic politics.  It is only  a\r\n\r\nquestion of how we define what is interference, what are  the\r\n\r\ninstances in which we will act, whether we should have people\r\n\r\nto  advise  us,  and  so  forth.  But the  basic  concept  is\r\n\r\naccepted, that our politics is for ourselves alone, it is for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to decide, not for foreigners to come in to tell\r\n\r\nus what we should do in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will respond to the Members in the order in which they\r\n\r\nhave  spoken.  Mr Chew Heng Ching supports the Bill,  but  is\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  the possible negative  impressions  of  our\r\n\r\nmedia scene, whether it will affect our image as a media hub.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to assure him that this is very unlikely.   My\r\n\r\nown  assessment  is  that this Bill  will  have  very  little\r\n\r\nconsequence  in practice because so long as the  broadcasters\r\n\r\nstay to what they are doing so far, that means, be objective,\r\n\r\nreport  the  news, by all means report on Singapore,  but  be\r\n\r\nobjective,  accurate, do not take sides, do  not  try  to  be\r\n\r\n\"funny\"  in terms of our local politics, there should  be  no\r\n\r\nproblem.   In fact, my Ministry has gone to great lengths  to\r\n\r\nbrief  the  foreign correspondents and the  broadcasters  who\r\n\r\nwill  be affected.  Most of them understand the intention  of\r\n\r\nour action.  What we are doing here is nothing new.  We have,\r\n\r\nfor example, studied what has been done in Canada and the UK.\r\n\r\nIn those two cases, as Mr Simon Tay has pointed out, they are\r\n\r\nmore narrow in scope. They are confined to the elections.  In\r\n\r\nmany  other respects, they are the same.  In fact,  the  laws\r\n\r\nare extra-territorial because they are trying to impose their\r\n\r\nlaws on what is outside, ie, broadcasting outside.  Here,  we\r\n\r\nare trying to control foreign broadcasters who are carried in\r\n\r\nSingapore through our SCV.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we are not limiting this just to the\r\n\r\nelection  period is that you can easily build up  a  negative\r\n\r\nimage or twist the facts and convey a negative impression and\r\n\r\ninfluence  public opinion, even outside the election  period.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the reason why both the NPPA and this amendment  on\r\n\r\nwhich it is modelled have the same intention.  Basically,  it\r\n\r\nis to lay\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  ground  rules very clearly to all these foreigners  that\r\n\r\nthey  are welcome to do business here.  They are also welcome\r\n\r\nto  report on us as observers, but they should not interfere,\r\n\r\nthey  should  not have an agenda, because it is going  to  be\r\n\r\nquite  difficult to judge, depending on the actual reporting,\r\n\r\nwhat it is that they are trying to do.  But I believe if  you\r\n\r\nfollow the developments leading up to the NPPA, you will  see\r\n\r\nthat  certain articles have a consistent pattern about  them.\r\n\r\nThey  even  went  to the extent of refusing  to  publish  the\r\n\r\nreplies  in  toto.   In one case - I think  it  was  the  Far\r\n\r\nEastern  Economic Review, they only published when we  bought\r\n\r\nadvertisements.  In other cases, they only printed our  reply\r\n\r\nafter editing it and cutting out the essential portions.   We\r\n\r\nwill,  of  course, be very careful on how we  implement  this\r\n\r\nlaw.   The  officers,  the SBA staff  and  our  own  Ministry\r\n\r\nofficers,  will  monitor  and be  extremely  careful  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether  this  is fair comment, is it fair reporting,  is  it\r\n\r\nbalanced,  is  it  accurate or is there  something  that  the\r\n\r\nbroadcaster is really after.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to Mr Chew Heng Ching's point, I think the\r\n\r\nimpact will be minimal.  The broadcasters whom we have spoken\r\n\r\nto generally understand the intent of this Bill.  They do not\r\n\r\nlike it, but I think they understand it.  So long as they  do\r\n\r\nnot stray outside what they are doing now, there should be no\r\n\r\ndifficulty.   The impact on our media hub would  be  minimal.\r\n\r\nBecause  of what we have been doing, Singapore has  developed\r\n\r\nvery  well as a media hub, as Mr Chew has pointed out. Today,\r\n\r\nwe  are  home to 15 satellite broadcasters and 84  production\r\n\r\nhouses.  The number of foreign publications circulating here,\r\n\r\nwhich include International Herald Tribune (IHT), Asian  Wall\r\n\r\nStreet  Journal, Economist and so forth, has grown to  5,500.\r\n\r\nWe  also have 40 foreign channels on SCV, including 5 foreign\r\n\r\nnews  channels.   I would like to assure Mr  Chew  and  other\r\n\r\nMembers  that we remain committed to make Singapore  a  media\r\n\r\nhub, to welcome foreign media to operate here, both to report\r\n\r\non us as well as on the world and the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are, for example, offering generous tax incentives to\r\n\r\nencourage  people  to  come here to  package  programmes,  to\r\n\r\nuplift  and  to  broadcast  to  the  region.   Many  of   the\r\n\r\nbroadcasters  who are operating here have told us  that  they\r\n\r\nare  extremely happy here.  It is good that we set our ground\r\n\r\nrules  clearly  so that there will be a minimum  of  conflict\r\n\r\narising  from  misunderstandings.  I hope the  foreign  media\r\n\r\nwill take it in this light.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam asked a few questions. Basically, the\r\n\r\npoint  is:   how  do  we  define  \"interference  in  domestic\r\n\r\npolitics\"?  As I mentioned in my speech, the High  Court  had\r\n\r\nin  fact  ruled  in  one case against the Asian  Wall  Street\r\n\r\nJournal,  and  they  have  said  that  reports  or  editorial\r\n\r\ncomments  which went beyond what was factual could amount  to\r\n\r\n\"engaging  in domestic politics\", if they were  made  with  a\r\n\r\nview  to  espouse  political ideas  or  to  influence  public\r\n\r\nopinion.   That is what the High Court said.   If  there  are\r\n\r\ncases  which  are  in  doubt as a result  of  the  Minister's\r\n\r\nruling,  they  can  be taken to court and challenged.   Asian\r\n\r\nWall  Street Journal did it and there was a ruling.  The same\r\n\r\nthing  applies to other cases.  I also mentioned in my speech\r\n\r\nand gave three examples of cases which could be construed  as\r\n\r\ninterfering in our domestic politics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned one case where, for example, the broadcaster\r\n\r\nrefuses  to  give  us the right of reply.  I  think  that  is\r\n\r\nbasic.   If  they  have done something wrong,  that  is,  the\r\n\r\nreport  was twisted or inaccurate, and we demand a  right  of\r\n\r\nreply,  they should give it to us.  In fact, the  damage  has\r\n\r\nalready  been  done  because the wrong  impression  has  been\r\n\r\ncreated.  And some time thereafter, on the same programme our\r\n\r\nreply  or,  in  the case of the print media, a  small  column\r\n\r\nsomewhere  they printed a correction or our reply.   This  is\r\n\r\none instance that the right of reply is important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second example I gave is where, in fact, money\r\n\r\nchanged  hands.  There was one recent example where  somebody\r\n\r\nwas  paid to appear in a programme.  I think where there  are\r\n\r\npaid programmes or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhere  somebody tries to buy political advertising,  that  is\r\n\r\nvery  clear.   It  is  clearly interfering  in  our  domestic\r\n\r\npolitics.  As explained in my speech, we will have to look at\r\n\r\nthe  actual circumstances and decide on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\nIt  is not possible to define in black and white and say this\r\n\r\nis  it.   We will have to look at the whole series of events,\r\n\r\nthe situation, how it is presented.  And then we will have to\r\n\r\nbe very careful before we take any action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Simon Tay and Dr Lee were concerned about\r\n\r\nrevoking without giving reasons.  This is the way it has been\r\n\r\ndrafted by the AG's Chambers.  I think the key point is  that\r\n\r\nit  gives us the position of strength.  In other words, it is\r\n\r\nsomething that we decide and it is final.  In actual fact, we\r\n\r\nalways  explain what we do.  Firstly, we are very careful  in\r\n\r\nwhat  we do.  We do not just take arbitrary action.  We  talk\r\n\r\nto the press and tell them, \"Look, what are you trying to do?\r\n\r\nPlease desist from this line of reporting, or give us a right\r\n\r\nof  reply.\"  If they refuse and if there is a build-up,  then\r\n\r\nwe know that they are trying to be difficult.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every case that has happened in the past where a\r\n\r\nnewspaper  was  gazetted,  there  was  thorough  explanation.\r\n\r\nPages  of  our newspapers were taken up publishing in  detail\r\n\r\nwhy  we demanded a reply, where were the inaccuracies,  where\r\n\r\nthey  corrected us.  And it is our intention to continue that\r\n\r\npractice,  and explain all our actions, because  we  have  to\r\n\r\njustify ourselves to Singaporeans as well as to foreigners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay made the point that this is different from\r\n\r\nthe  NPPA,  because  the SCV is like a tap,  which  could  be\r\n\r\nturned  on and off.  This is not quite right, because we  can\r\n\r\nactually  limit  the  number of people who  can  receive  the\r\n\r\nparticular  channel.  So it is like the newspapers.   In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  newspapers, it was limited to so  many  copies  per\r\n\r\nyear.  In the same way, we can punish the foreign broadcaster\r\n\r\nby  limiting  the  number  of people  who  can  receive  that\r\n\r\nparticular channel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NMP may not be aware of this, but Malaysian TV is\r\n\r\nactually available on our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSCV.   There  is no payment involved.  In fact, all  our  HDB\r\n\r\nflats are receiving the Malaysian channels, because it  is  a\r\n\r\ncarry-on  of past practice when we switched from broadcasting\r\n\r\nover  the  air to doing it through cable.  So the same  rules\r\n\r\nwill apply to Malaysian TV, even though it is not a dedicated\r\n\r\nnews channel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way we can punish an errant broadcaster is to\r\n\r\nmove  him  up to a more expensive tier, for example.   In  an\r\n\r\nextreme case, we might just blank it out.  That will be quite\r\n\r\nextreme.   If we have to do that, we can do it.  In fact,  if\r\n\r\nall  we  want to do is to blank it out, we do not  need  this\r\n\r\nBill.   Because under section 41 of the Act, it gives us  the\r\n\r\npower to proscribe broadcasters.  But we want to be seen that\r\n\r\nwe   are  not  preventing  the  flow  of  information.    The\r\n\r\nparticular section 41 has certain requirements.  It  must  be\r\n\r\nbecause  of moral reasons, public order and so on.   This  is\r\n\r\nmore  specific.   This is on the basis that broadcasters  are\r\n\r\nhere  to  do business.  They want to have subscribers.   They\r\n\r\nwant  to  have advertisements.   And so long as they play  by\r\n\r\nour rules and do not interfere in our politics, everybody  is\r\n\r\nhappy.    But   if  they  consistently  try  to  damage   our\r\n\r\ninstitutions and cast a slur on our courts, for example, then\r\n\r\nwe have to take action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members asked whether we should have a committee\r\n\r\nto advise us on this matter.  I do not think it is necessary,\r\n\r\nbecause the civil servants who are administering this Act are\r\n\r\nextremely  careful.  The people in the Ministry with  whom  I\r\n\r\nwork  with are most conscious of their mission, which  is  to\r\n\r\npromote  Singapore  as a media hub, and  they  will  be  very\r\n\r\nreluctant  to  take any action unless it is very  clear  that\r\n\r\nsomething has been transgressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have answered most of the points.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister by way of\r\n\r\nclarification, if you will permit me, Sir?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On this right to reply the Government is\r\n\r\nso concerned about,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndoes  the  Government consider that the only right  to  reply\r\n\r\nshould  be in the paper which published the offending article\r\n\r\nor  the  broadcasting  media which  broadcast  the  offending\r\n\r\narticle or piece?  Has the Government not got the full  array\r\n\r\nof  the Singapore press?  Have you not got the full array  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore TV and radio to give your reply?

I think it  is  a\r\n\r\nprinciple of natural justice surely.   Why should we have  to\r\n\r\ngo  and  buy  advertisements or use our own  media?   We  are\r\n\r\nreaching a different audience.

Can I understand\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister that his policy in implementing this  law\r\n\r\nwould be, first, to seek a right of reply; second, to explain\r\n\r\nand  justify;  and,  third,  that  he  would  tend  to  limit\r\n\r\nviewership, rather than a full black-out.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Yes.

So we have to take quite fast action.  Otherwise,\r\n\r\nthe intention is to study carefully, talk to the press or the\r\n\r\noffending party, check what they are doing, understand  their\r\n\r\nreal  reason and have a reply, see whether there is a  trend,\r\n\r\nand  do  the  minimum  necessary.  We do  not  want  to  hurt\r\n\r\nourselves in the process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill.  -  [Mr Lee Yock Suan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>3.55 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill proposes amendments to the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nElections Act to provide for overseas and electronic  voting.\r\n\r\nIt also specifies a vote recount margin and restricts the use\r\n\r\nof  the  register of electors.  I will deal with each one  of\r\n\r\nthem in turn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Overseas voting</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overseas Singaporeans are spread out in many countries.\r\n\r\nThe  number  is  not large, compared to the  total  Singapore\r\n\r\npopulation.   Based on the 1997 General Elections statistics,\r\n\r\nthe  Elections Department estimates that in a fully contested\r\n\r\nelection, about 43,000 electors, or slightly more than 2%  of\r\n\r\nthe  electorate, are likely to be resident abroad.  Our sense\r\n\r\nis  that the number of overseas Singaporeans of voting age is\r\n\r\nprobably higher, as some of them may not have restored  their\r\n\r\nnames on the register over the years, and some have come home\r\n\r\nto  vote.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has estimated that\r\n\r\nthe current number of Singaporeans overseas is about 100,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises that more and more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will  work  and study  overseas  with  economic\r\n\r\nglobalisation.  Therefore, the Government has decided to  try\r\n\r\nout  overseas  voting in a limited way at  the  next  general\r\n\r\nelections  if  all  the preparations and  procedures  can  be\r\n\r\ncompleted  on  time.   This  will  allow  us  to  gain   some\r\n\r\nexperience,  and we can then consider doing it  on  a  larger\r\n\r\nscale later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, overseas voting will be carried out at our\r\n\r\nMissions   in  Beijing,  Canberra,  Hong  Kong,  London   and\r\n\r\nWashington.   These  Missions  are  chosen  because  of   the\r\n\r\nsignificant   number  of  Singaporeans   living   in   China,\r\n\r\nAustralia,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHong  Kong, Europe and America, and the Missions have  enough\r\n\r\nstaff to conduct the elections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me move on to the eligibility for overseas\r\n\r\nvoting.   Under the current election laws, only  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  are  \"ordinarily resident\" in Singapore can  vote.   The\r\n\r\nterm  \"ordinarily resident\" is not explicitly defined in  the\r\n\r\nAct.    Strictly  interpreted,  a  Singaporean  who  is   not\r\n\r\n\"ordinarily  resident in Singapore\" will not  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nregister  to  vote.  To enable them to vote overseas,  it  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  necessary to expand the definition of  \"ordinarily\r\n\r\nresident\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are various ways \"residence\" is defined\r\n\r\nin  our  statutes.  For example, for income tax  purposes,  a\r\n\r\nnatural person is resident in Singapore if he is in Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  183  days or more during the year preceding the year  of\r\n\r\nassessment.  Under the Women's Charter, the courts would have\r\n\r\njurisdiction over family disputes or to entertain proceedings\r\n\r\nfor  presumption of death only if one of the parties has been\r\n\r\nhabitually resident in Singapore for a period of three  years\r\n\r\nimmediately preceding the institution of the proceedings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 5 of the Parliamentary Elections\r\n\r\nAct  to  deem  non-resident  Singaporeans  to  be  ordinarily\r\n\r\nresident  in  Singapore and qualified  to  be  registered  as\r\n\r\nelectors if they have lived in Singapore for an aggregate  of\r\n\r\ntwo  years  within five years of their registration  to  vote\r\n\r\noverseas.   The five-year period corresponds to the statutory\r\n\r\nmaximum  term  of Parliament.  The two years  in  five  years\r\n\r\ncriterion  will  not, however, apply to  citizens  and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies sent by the Government to work or study overseas, as\r\n\r\nwell as those working in approved international agencies, eg,\r\n\r\nthe  United  Nations.   Otherwise,  some  of  those  who  are\r\n\r\nassigned by the Government on long tours of duty or  sent  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  study  overseas  will  inadvertently  be\r\n\r\ndisenfranchised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not uncommon for countries to impose\r\n\r\nresidential requirements as a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncondition to register their overseas voters.  New Zealand and\r\n\r\nCanada, for example, require their citizens to be out of  the\r\n\r\ncountry for no more than three and five years respectively to\r\n\r\nbe  eligible  to  vote overseas.  For both  countries,  their\r\n\r\nresidential requirements also do not apply to the  government\r\n\r\nofficials  and their dependants.  There are other  countries,\r\n\r\neg,  India  and Israel, which allow only their  diplomats  or\r\n\r\npersonnel on official assignment overseas to vote overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This requirement of residence is an important one. It\r\n\r\nis  a  necessary pre-condition to constituency representation\r\n\r\nand  to  prevent plural voting, which is a form of  electoral\r\n\r\nfraud.   Our  parliamentary  elections  are  conducted  on  a\r\n\r\nconstituency  basis.   The poll is conducted  and  the  votes\r\n\r\ncounted   for  each  constituency.   Therefore,  a  citizen's\r\n\r\nresidence in Singapore affords the basis for allotting him to\r\n\r\na   particular  constituency  to  vote  during  an  election.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  without  allocating  a  constituency  based  on  a\r\n\r\ncitizen's residence, a citizen can easily vote more than once\r\n\r\nat  any  election  and not being detected.   This  is  plural\r\n\r\nvoting.   Thus, residence is and must be retained as  a  pre-condition to vote.  The amendments effect a relaxation  in  a\r\n\r\nmanner that will not allow plural voting to take place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new law deems certain groups of overseas\r\n\r\ncitizens  to be ordinarily resident in Singapore.  These  are\r\n\r\ncitizens  who  are  likely  to  have  intentions  to   resume\r\n\r\nresidence  in  Singapore.  Hence the amendments provide  them\r\n\r\nthe facility of voting outside Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voters' constituency is based on the records on the\r\n\r\nElectoral  Register,  which  in  turn  is  derived  from  the\r\n\r\nregister   maintained   by  the  Commissioner   of   National\r\n\r\nRegistration.   Those  overseas  Singaporeans  who   do   not\r\n\r\nmaintain  a  local address with the Commissioner of  National\r\n\r\nRegistration will not have their names entered or retained on\r\n\r\nthe  Electoral  Register as they cannot be allocated  to  any\r\n\r\nparticular  electoral division using their  foreign  address.\r\n\r\nIn order for an overseas citizen to retain a Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naddress  on  the register, the National Registration  Act  is\r\n\r\nalso  amended so that citizen can either use the  address  of\r\n\r\none  of  his  local  residential  properties,  or  the  local\r\n\r\nresidential address of any family member or relative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reasonable to expect a Singaporean overseas to\r\n\r\nregister  a  residential address which he still owns  or  has\r\n\r\nsome links with, and for this address to be used as the basis\r\n\r\nfor  determining the constituency he belongs to.  If we allow\r\n\r\nhim  to  register, say, his last known address,  but  he  has\r\n\r\nalready  sold  the property, then his elector status  can  be\r\n\r\nobjected  to or challenged by the current occupants  at  that\r\n\r\naddress,   when   the  register  is  open   for   inspection.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  provision for the  person  to  register  the\r\n\r\naddress  of  a  relative enables him to have  an  address  in\r\n\r\nSingapore for voting purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to prevent vote manipulation, we require the\r\n\r\nresidential  address  to belong to his own  property  or  his\r\n\r\nrelative's and not, say, his friend's.  Allowing an  overseas\r\n\r\nSingaporean  to  register  his  friend's  address  with   the\r\n\r\nNational  Register will mean that  he can  use  any  person's\r\n\r\naddress  as his local address, since it is difficult,  if  at\r\n\r\nall  impossible,  to  define \"friends\".   This  can  then  be\r\n\r\nexploited as a loophole to manipulate votes.  For example,  a\r\n\r\ncandidate  can ask all his \"friends\" overseas to register  an\r\n\r\naddress  in  the  constituency  he  is  contesting  as  their\r\n\r\nSingapore address.  In a very closely contested constituency,\r\n\r\nthe  overseas votes from these \"friends\" may just be able  to\r\n\r\nchange the outcome of that election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the qualifying criterion, clause 4 amends\r\n\r\nsection 6 to disqualify a non-resident from voting if  he  is\r\n\r\nin a foreign jail or has a Singapore warrant of arrest issued\r\n\r\non him for an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term\r\n\r\nexceeding 12 months.  Those in foreign jails are excluded for\r\n\r\nobvious  reasons.   Fugitives  of  justice  should  also   be\r\n\r\nexcluded because they are running away from Singapore law.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electors who wish to vote overseas will have to pre-register at the Elections Department or one of our overseas\r\n\r\nmissions.   This  will  allow  the  Elections  Department  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  and  prepare  the required  resources.   Clause  7\r\n\r\namends  section  10  to  provide  for  the  establishment  of\r\n\r\noverseas registration centres in any Singapore embassy,  High\r\n\r\nCommission, diplomatic mission or consulate, while  clause  9\r\n\r\ninserts  a new section 13A that provides for the registration\r\n\r\nof  overseas electors.  The registration for overseas  voting\r\n\r\nwill be open at our missions at the same time as the register\r\n\r\nis  open  for inspection in Singapore.  The registration  for\r\n\r\noverseas  voting will be open for 21 days, 7 more  days  than\r\n\r\nthe 14 days given to the electors in Singapore to inspect the\r\n\r\nregister.   This  is because the overseas electors  may  need\r\n\r\nmore  time  to be informed of the registration  and  to  come\r\n\r\nforward to register at the missions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 inserts a new section 36A providing for the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of overseas polling stations in any  Singapore\r\n\r\nembassy,  High  Commission, diplomatic mission or  consulate,\r\n\r\nwhile  clause  16 inserts a new section 39A that  deals  with\r\n\r\nvoting by overseas electors.  Overseas voting will be held as\r\n\r\nclose as the polling day in Singapore as possible.  This  can\r\n\r\nbe  held before the poll opens in Singapore but must close no\r\n\r\nlater than the close of poll in Singapore.  For example,  for\r\n\r\nthe  voting at our London Mission, it will only be noon there\r\n\r\nwhen  the  poll  closes at 8.00 pm in Singapore.   Hence,  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the voters there with sufficient time to cast  their\r\n\r\nvotes,  and yet have the poll closed no later than the  close\r\n\r\nof  poll in Singapore, we will likely have to hold the voting\r\n\r\nthere one day earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 21 inserts a new section 49A which provides\r\n\r\n10  days  for the overseas votes to be returned to Singapore.\r\n\r\nOverseas  votes  will be counted as soon  as  is  practicable\r\n\r\nafter  they  arrive in Singapore.  However,  if  the  winning\r\n\r\nmargin, based on the local votes counted, is higher than  the\r\n\r\ntotal overseas votes for a particular constituency, then  the\r\n\r\nwinner  will  be declared on polling night.  For example,  if\r\n\r\nthe difference in votes between the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwinning  and  losing  candidates in a constituency  is,  say,\r\n\r\n1,000, and there is only a total of 500 overseas electors for\r\n\r\nthat  constituency,  the  winning  candidate  will  still  be\r\n\r\ndeclared  as  the  winner  for the  election  since  the  500\r\n\r\noverseas  votes do not affect the poll result  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nHowever,  overseas votes will still be counted, and added  to\r\n\r\nthe local votes and subsequently published in the Gazette.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Electronic Voting</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now let me move on to electronic voting. Singapore\r\n\r\nnow  uses  a  paper ballot voting system for the General  and\r\n\r\nPresidential  Elections.  The system is  manpower  intensive,\r\n\r\nand   the   Elections   Department   anticipates   increasing\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in getting public officers to serve  as  election\r\n\r\nstaff,  especially given the trend of public service agencies\r\n\r\nbeing  corporatised.  We should now also  take  advantage  of\r\n\r\ntechnological  advances.  More people are now  familiar  with\r\n\r\nelectronic  devices,  such  as  computers,  automatic  teller\r\n\r\nmachines (ATMs), etc.  Many also use the ATMs to top up their\r\n\r\ncash  cards  and even subscribe to IPO shares  and  use  Nets\r\n\r\nterminals to perform all kinds of transactions such as paying\r\n\r\nfor goods at supermarkets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided that it is time to\r\n\r\nmake  provisions  for  electronic voting  in  our  elections.\r\n\r\nElections Department is currently developing the system.   If\r\n\r\nit  can  be ready before the next General Elections, we  will\r\n\r\ntry  it  out on a limited scale.  The trials will allow  both\r\n\r\nthe  voters  and  the election officials to  learn  from  the\r\n\r\nexperience before making its use universal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, electronic voting is not new. Countries which have\r\n\r\nused electronic devices either for voting or for counting  of\r\n\r\nvotes  include  the United States, Belgium,  Netherlands  and\r\n\r\nBrazil.   The United Kingdom also tried out various forms  of\r\n\r\nelectronic voting and counting at its local elections in  May\r\n\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last October, I led a team to look at the electronic\r\n\r\nvoting systems used in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBelgium, Netherlands and the United States.  Both Belgium and\r\n\r\nthe  Netherlands use  touch screen voting systems running  on\r\n\r\npersonal  computers, Belgium since 1991 and  the  Netherlands\r\n\r\nsince  1998.   Essentially,  the voters  make  their  choices\r\n\r\neither  by touching the screen with their finger or  with  an\r\n\r\nelectronic pen.  In the Netherlands and the US, I saw the use\r\n\r\nof  dedicated  voting machines, where the voters  make  their\r\n\r\nchoices  on  a panel.  I also saw the use of punch  card  and\r\n\r\nmark  sense  ballot papers for voting, where the ballots  can\r\n\r\nthen be counted electronically by machines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After studying the different systems, we have selected\r\n\r\nthe personal computer- based touch screen system for our use.\r\n\r\nIt  is  fast and convenient to use.  The computers and  touch\r\n\r\nscreen monitors can also be used for other purposes after the\r\n\r\nelection,   so  that  there  is  no  problem  with   storage,\r\n\r\nmaintenance   and  system  obsolescence  between   elections.\r\n\r\nObsolescence is a common problem which the election officials\r\n\r\nin the United States, Belgium and the Netherlands highlighted\r\n\r\nto  us  during  our  October trip last  year.   This  is  not\r\n\r\nsurprising, given the speed at which technology is  changing.\r\n\r\nFor  example, we were told by one of our US hosts  that  they\r\n\r\nhave  difficulties maintaining the voting machines they  have\r\n\r\nused  for  more than 10  years, as the company which supplied\r\n\r\nthe  machines has closed down.  Such a problem will not occur\r\n\r\nif the voting system is only in the form of software, and the\r\n\r\nhardware can be used for other purposes after each election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 inserts new sections 50A to 50D relating to\r\n\r\nthe  use of electronic voting systems, which are referred  to\r\n\r\nas  direct recording electronic (DRE) voting systems  in  the\r\n\r\nBill.   Before  its  use, the DRE voting  system  has  to  be\r\n\r\nscrutinised and approved by the Auditor-General or  a  person\r\n\r\nappointed  by the Minister in consultation with the  Auditor-General, before the issue of the writ.  Approval is  also  to\r\n\r\nbe  given  after  conducting  such  necessary  tests  in  the\r\n\r\npresence of the Returning Officer and such representatives of\r\n\r\nany political party who wish to be present.  The criteria for\r\n\r\nthe approval\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprocess  are also stipulated in the new section  50A.   These\r\n\r\ninclude the need for the votes to be cast in secrecy and  for\r\n\r\nsufficient  audit  trails  to be available  for  verification\r\n\r\npurposes.  The audit trails are necessary to prevent election\r\n\r\nfraud,  and  are no different from what we are already  doing\r\n\r\nfor  the  paper  ballot  system.  The new  section  50B  also\r\n\r\nprovides  for the auditors to conduct pre-poll inspection  of\r\n\r\nthe  DRE  voting machines which will be used on polling  day.\r\n\r\nThis  will  be  done in the view of the candidates  or  their\r\n\r\npolling  agents  who are present.  After the inspection,  the\r\n\r\nmachines  will be sealed and stored at a secure place  before\r\n\r\nbeing taken out on polling day.  At the polling station,  the\r\n\r\npresiding  officer  will have to ensure that  the  electronic\r\n\r\nvoting  equipment are still sealed and secured  against  use.\r\n\r\nThe  seals will be broken in the view of those in the polling\r\n\r\nstation, before the machines are put to use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the event of a system failure, there will be\r\n\r\ntechnical  staff  on  standby  to  attend  to  the  machines.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in  the  unlikely event of a total system  failure,\r\n\r\nthen  voting will be halted.  It can resume at a  later  time\r\n\r\nusing either ballot papers or the same DRE voting system.  It\r\n\r\ncan also be adjourned and conducted afresh another day within\r\n\r\na   week.   For  the  trial  at  the  coming  elections,  the\r\n\r\nconventional  paper  ballot will be the backup.   To  prevent\r\n\r\npotential  disruptions  caused  by  power  failure,   polling\r\n\r\nstations  using the electronic voting system will  also  have\r\n\r\nbackup  power  generators.  Under the new  section  50A,  the\r\n\r\nelectronic  voting system must be able to  maintain  all  the\r\n\r\nvoting data stored regardless of power surges or outages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the voters' perspective, I would like to\r\n\r\nemphasise that there is no change in the voting process  with\r\n\r\nelectronic voting.  Only the medium would be different.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  making of a choice on the touch screen  is  no\r\n\r\ndifferent from the current marking of the ballot paper.   The\r\n\r\nconfirming  of  the  choice  on  the  screen  is  similar  to\r\n\r\ndepositing the marked ballot paper into the ballot  box.   To\r\n\r\nprovide for greater familiarity, it is stated in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnew section 50D that the ballot image on the screen will have\r\n\r\nto  be the same format as the ballot paper.  The section also\r\n\r\nprovides  the Minister with the power to make regulations  to\r\n\r\nmodify  the current election processes into electronic  form.\r\n\r\nThis is necessary as most of the current processes spelt  out\r\n\r\nin  the law are paper-based.  For example, to allow the votes\r\n\r\nto  be  counted  electronically, we will  need  to  make  the\r\n\r\nappropriate regulations to provide for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To safeguard against hacking, there will be no online\r\n\r\nlink  between  the  voting machines and the counting  centre.\r\n\r\nThe  DRE  voting machines will only be connected within  each\r\n\r\npolling station via a local area network.  For the purpose of\r\n\r\nthe  trial  at the coming elections, the machines  will  come\r\n\r\nwith  a   hardcopy receipt feature.  The main purpose  is  to\r\n\r\nassure  voters of the accuracy of electronic voting.  If  the\r\n\r\npilot  phase  is successful, the two trial features,  namely,\r\n\r\nthe  hardcopy  receipts  and  paper  ballot  backup,  may  be\r\n\r\ndispensed with in future elections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, should the electronic voting system be ready for\r\n\r\nuse  at  the  next elections, there will be public education,\r\n\r\nnot   just  for  the  pilot  constituency,  but  the   entire\r\n\r\npopulation   as   well.   Singaporeans  will  have   hands-on\r\n\r\nexperience  on  demonstration  touch  screens  at   community\r\n\r\npremises,  like  community clubs and  neighbourhood  shopping\r\n\r\nmalls.   There will also be mass publicity through  broadcast\r\n\r\nand print media.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Recount margin</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now, let me turn to the recount margin. Currently,\r\n\r\nour  election laws allow one mandatory recount, if  requested\r\n\r\nby  the candidate, regardless of vote margin at each counting\r\n\r\nplace.   The candidate or his election agent can also request\r\n\r\nfor  a recount at a counting place if he thinks the votes are\r\n\r\ntoo close there, without taking into account the aggregate of\r\n\r\nthe  votes  for  the whole constituency.   Sir,  this  is  an\r\n\r\nanomaly, as the closeness of the votes at the counting  place\r\n\r\nlevel  does not reflect the closeness of the contest for  the\r\n\r\nwhole\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconstituency.    For  example,  during   the   1997   General\r\n\r\nElections,  the  votes  at quite a few  of  the  25  counting\r\n\r\ncentres  in  the Cheng San GRC were recounted as the  margins\r\n\r\nwere  close.   However, if we look at the aggregated  result,\r\n\r\nthe  winning  margin was actually 9.6%.  There should  be  no\r\n\r\nreason for a recount to be made for such a big margin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to address this anomaly, clause 21 inserts a new\r\n\r\nsection 49B which will allow application only after the votes\r\n\r\nin  the  constituency have been counted.  To avoid  frivolous\r\n\r\nrequests, recounts will only be allowed if the total  winning\r\n\r\nmargin  is  2%  or  less  of  the total  valid  votes  for  a\r\n\r\nconstituency.  So using this criterion, Nee Soon  Central  in\r\n\r\n1991 and Eunos GRC in 1988 would qualify for recount.  The 2%\r\n\r\nmargin  will  also  apply  to the  recount  of  the  hardcopy\r\n\r\nreceipts for the constituencies using the DRE voting system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not unusual to set a margin for the purpose\r\n\r\nof  recount.   Malaysian  law, for example,  provides  for  a\r\n\r\nmandatory  recount  on application if the difference  between\r\n\r\nthe  two leading candidates is 2% or less of the total number\r\n\r\nof  votes  cast.  In Canada, a recount ordered by a court  on\r\n\r\napplication  is mandatory only if the margin is 0.1%  of  the\r\n\r\nvotes  cast  for the federal level elections.  In the  United\r\n\r\nStates,  the recount margins vary from state to state.   They\r\n\r\nrange  from 0.1% in Arizona to 5% in Vermont but the majority\r\n\r\nof  them  are  1%  or  less,  for  example,  Virginia,  South\r\n\r\nCarolina, Montana, Florida and Georgia.  Therefore, Sir,  you\r\n\r\ncan  see  that the 2% margin proposed in the Bill  is  really\r\n\r\nquite generous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States too, Sir, some states also require\r\n\r\nthe  requesting party to pay a deposit for the recount, which\r\n\r\nwould  be  returned only if the results are  reversed  or  if\r\n\r\nsubstantial errors are established.  This is something we may\r\n\r\nconsider doing in future if there is a need.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Restriction on use of register</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now touch on the restrictions on the use of\r\n\r\nthe registers of electors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Parliamentary Elections Act is silent  on  how\r\n\r\nthe  registers may be used.  Given the information  contained\r\n\r\nin  the  registers, there is potential for their  misuse  for\r\n\r\ncommercial  purposes, or invasion of privacy.  Therefore,  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the interest of the electors and prevent  abuse,  we\r\n\r\nare amending the Act to restrict the use of the registers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 inserts a new section 21A which will allow\r\n\r\npolitical  parties, candidates and their election  agents  to\r\n\r\nuse  the  records  in  the registers  of  electors  only  for\r\n\r\ncommunicating  with  the  electors.   Use  of   records   for\r\n\r\ncommercial  purposes will not be allowed.  If the  candidate,\r\n\r\nthe  election agents or the parties are to disclose any  such\r\n\r\ninformation  to  another person, they can do  so  only  after\r\n\r\nobtaining the written acknowledgement of the person  that  he\r\n\r\nis bound by the restrictions under the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, any other person who obtains information\r\n\r\nfrom  a  register  of  electors cannot  reproduce,  store  or\r\n\r\ntransmit the information.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breach of any of the conditions under the new section is\r\n\r\nan  offence  carrying a fine of up to $1,000 or  imprisonment\r\n\r\nfor a term of up to six months or both.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Consequential amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 27 and the Schedule make similar\r\n\r\namendments relating to overseas voting and electronic  voting\r\n\r\nin  the Presidential Elections Act.  Amendments are also made\r\n\r\nto  the  Political  Donations  Act  to  make  it  clear  that\r\n\r\npolitical parties are permissible donors and to effect  other\r\n\r\ntechnical amendments to clarify provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the overseas and electronic voting proposals that I\r\n\r\nhave  presented  today are significant  steps  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to ensure that our electoral processes  move  with\r\n\r\nthe  times.   The other amendments are practical  changes  to\r\n\r\nfine-tune  the current electoral processes and  to  safeguard\r\n\r\nvoter privacy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I rise to speak in\r\n\r\nsupport  of the Bill.  This Bill seeks to extend the vote  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  overseas  and  also  to  introduce   into   our\r\n\r\nelectoral system the electronic vote.  Both measures that the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  mentioned may be said to be a  recognition  of\r\n\r\nglobalisation  (which means that more and  more  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  going  abroad  to  work and study) and  the  Information\r\n\r\nTechnology  society (which requires all of us to be  familiar\r\n\r\nwith the use of computers).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the simple act of voting is central to our system\r\n\r\nof  Government.   It  is the foundation on  which  legitimate\r\n\r\ngovernment  in  Singapore is based.  While voting  is  not  a\r\n\r\nconstitutional  right, it is nonetheless a strong  symbol  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  a mark of belonging - a privilege limited  only\r\n\r\nto  those  who are citizens of a certain age.  It is  also  a\r\n\r\nduty,  as voting is compulsory.  Many vote not because it  is\r\n\r\ncompulsory, but because they feel they are discharging  their\r\n\r\nduty  to  society.  Yet, voting, as an individual act,  is  a\r\n\r\ncurious thing.  When one votes, one gets the feeling that  it\r\n\r\nmay  not  count  for much but one also gets the  satisfaction\r\n\r\nthat all who vote are engaged in a common venture of the most\r\n\r\nimportant  kind - to elect representatives to the legislature\r\n\r\nand, in our system, indirectly, to the executive as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with this perspective that I would like to comment\r\n\r\non  the new Bill.  We must be careful that the vote, which is\r\n\r\nan  affirmation of belonging to Singapore, should be regarded\r\n\r\nas  a cherished privilege, to be taken away only if a citizen\r\n\r\nforfeits it through his or her own unacceptable conduct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 9 of the Bill, a new section 13A is\r\n\r\nproposed.   This  refers  to  the  registration  of  overseas\r\n\r\nelectors.   Here, I find a curious distinction between  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  in  the public sector or Government  scholars,  and\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  not.  If one is not somehow  in  the  public\r\n\r\nsector, one has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  show  a  period  of  two years'  residence  out  of  five\r\n\r\nimmediately  preceding  the prescribed  date.   This  is  not\r\n\r\nrequired  of the public sector group.  Perhaps, the  Minister\r\n\r\ncan  explain  why  there is a need for this distinction.   He\r\n\r\nmentioned  just now that long-term Government  officers  will\r\n\r\notherwise  be  disenfranchised.  But by the  same  token,  so\r\n\r\nwould  private Singaporeans working for private organisations\r\n\r\noverseas.  So the distinction has to be justified, I believe,\r\n\r\nin another way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, any elector wishing to be registered has to\r\n\r\nsubmit proof that he is a citizen over 21 and he has to  make\r\n\r\na  declaration  to  this effect as well.  I  wonder  why  the\r\n\r\ndeclaration  is  necessary.  I am actually more  inclined  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  would-be overseas elector declare that  he  has  not\r\n\r\nacquired  permanent  residence in the  country  where  he  is\r\n\r\ncurrently residing, or that he is not in the process of being\r\n\r\na citizen of that country.  In both these situations, I would\r\n\r\nsay  that an elector would have by such conduct forfeited the\r\n\r\nprivilege to vote in a Singapore election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is of course a problem, when we have overseas voting,\r\n\r\nthat  a  person making false declarations or guilty of  other\r\n\r\nillegal   practices  would  not  be  subject  to  Singapore's\r\n\r\ncriminal  law,  as he would be outside the  jurisdiction.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister what are the possible measures\r\n\r\nthat could be taken against such persons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our law states that voting is compulsory, and if an\r\n\r\neligible  elector does not vote, his name  is  liable  to  be\r\n\r\nexpunged  from the register until he gives a good reason  for\r\n\r\nnot  voting.  I should like to know whether overseas electors\r\n\r\nwould be subject to the same provision.  It may be much  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  vote  overseas due to  distance  or  transport\r\n\r\nproblems.   Certainly, they would not have  as  many  polling\r\n\r\nstations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps, we should look again at the qualifying\r\n\r\nconditions  for  overseas  voting and  question  whether  the\r\n\r\ndistinction that was mentioned between the public sector  and\r\n\r\nthe private sector be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmaintained, and consider whether we have put in conditions of\r\n\r\neligibility  which  would  ensure that  serious  voters  with\r\n\r\nsufficient concern about what happens in Singapore would  get\r\n\r\nto vote, whether they are private or public sector employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn to the electronic voting system. The use of\r\n\r\nelectronic  devices  for  voting  is  a  step  in  the  right\r\n\r\ndirection.   It is also a step that many view with suspicion,\r\n\r\nperhaps due to a concern that the electronic vote may not  be\r\n\r\nas  safe  as  the  good old-fashioned ballot  paper.   Recent\r\n\r\nglitches  in  electronic  billing,  for  instance,  may  have\r\n\r\nreinforced the feeling of mistrust.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the DRE system, I should like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  assure us that the system  is  one  that  would\r\n\r\nprovide  the  same  level of secrecy  and  security  as  that\r\n\r\npresent  for the current system of voting through the  ballot\r\n\r\nbox.   Voters  would want to be reassured  that  their  votes\r\n\r\nwould  remain  secret,  and that  there  would  not  be  some\r\n\r\nelectronic  tracking device that would match their identities\r\n\r\nto their votes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister what steps would then be taken to\r\n\r\nnot  just  educate the public on how to vote in an electronic\r\n\r\nsystem,  but  also to assure them that the security  features\r\n\r\nare  in place to ensure that their vote remains as secret  as\r\n\r\nin the case of the paper ballot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill is, as\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  has  pointed  out,  an  important  piece   of\r\n\r\nlegislation  that  enables more Singaporeans  to  vote,  even\r\n\r\nthough they are not physically in Singapore.  This is  to  be\r\n\r\nstrongly  supported.   As more and more Singaporeans  venture\r\n\r\nabroad,  it is important to provide them with the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  exercise  this most cherished of privileges, namely,  the\r\n\r\nvote.   We  must remain vigilant only against those who  have\r\n\r\nleft  us  and  wish  us ill but, at the same  time,  we  must\r\n\r\nendeavour to allow those legitimate voters who have a  belief\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  but who have to work overseas, exercise  their\r\n\r\nvotes without unduly restricting them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to speak on two\r\n\r\naspects  of  the Bill.  I would like to speak on  (1)  direct\r\n\r\nrecording  electronic (DRE) voting system, and  (2)  overseas\r\n\r\nelectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot support the DRE voting system because the\r\n\r\nnotice  given  to use such a system is too short.   I  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand  why  the Government wants to rush  to  pass  this\r\n\r\nBill.   In  other countries, where computers or  machines  to\r\n\r\nassist in the voting system are to be used, people there  are\r\n\r\ngiven  a  few  years' warning or notice, unlike in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhere  the Government is only giving the people a few months'\r\n\r\nnotice or, at most, slightly more than 12 months' notice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear that the DRE voting system at this point of time\r\n\r\nis  still not finalised.  Tenders are being called to fix the\r\n\r\nsystem.   The  Government  itself is  not  confident  of  the\r\n\r\nsystem.   That  is  why  the  Government  does  not  want  to\r\n\r\nimplement  e-voting in every electoral division but  only  in\r\n\r\nselected  ones.  So why the need to rush going  into  the  e-voting  system?   What  I am afraid is  that  the  opposition\r\n\r\nconstituencies at Hougang and Potong Pasir shall be  selected\r\n\r\nas  guinea  pigs for the e-voting system.  If  this  happens,\r\n\r\nthen  I  say  that  the  Government is being  unfair  to  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.   There are so many more PAP-held  constituencies\r\n\r\nthan  the  Opposition.  Therefore, it is  only  fair  if  PAP\r\n\r\nconstituencies should first be selected to test  out  the  e-voting system and not the Opposition ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any new computer system, Sir, there are bound to be\r\n\r\nteething problems.  I think that the new DRE voting system is\r\n\r\nnot  going to be an exception.  There shall probably be  some\r\n\r\nunforeseen  problems cropping up.  I would  like  to  mention\r\n\r\nthat  even  in the USA during the last presidential election,\r\n\r\nthere   were  problems  with  their  machine-assisted  voting\r\n\r\nsystem.   Many  voters in the Florida state  complained  that\r\n\r\nthey  accidentally punched the wrong hole in the voting card.\r\n\r\nThe  Supreme Court in America could not help them to  redress\r\n\r\nthe alleged injustice.  In our case, should there be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproblems  arising from the use of computers  to  vote,  other\r\n\r\nthan  the  recounting allowed under the law, I am afraid  the\r\n\r\nloser,  if due to the use of computer voting, has very little\r\n\r\nchance of redress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is not right for the Government to have two\r\n\r\nvoting  systems  at once in a general election.   It  is  too\r\n\r\nearly  or premature for the Government to introduce  the  DRE\r\n\r\nvoting  system.  The Government should be fully  ready,  then\r\n\r\nintroduce  the e-voting system for every electoral  division,\r\n\r\nrather than only selecting a few and leaving the balance with\r\n\r\nthe  old manual voting system.  It would appear that this  is\r\n\r\npart  of  the Government's election strategy.  The Government\r\n\r\nhas tried the bait of upgrading HDB flats in the last GE, but\r\n\r\nfailed to win back the two Opposition constituencies.  Now it\r\n\r\nis  trying something else - the new electronic voting system.\r\n\r\nIf this were not so, then the Government should leave out the\r\n\r\nOpposition  wards in the e-voting system.  If the  Government\r\n\r\nis  unwilling  to introduce the e-voting system  to  all  the\r\n\r\nconstituencies, then I call on the Government  to  hold  back\r\n\r\nthe  e-voting system and keep it in abeyance for another four\r\n\r\nor  five  years, and only use it at the next general election\r\n\r\nafter the coming one.  If the Government is unwilling to hold\r\n\r\nback  the  introduction of the new e-voting  system,  then  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to suggest that the Government use a dual  voting\r\n\r\nsystem  at the same time, ie, the use of a DRE voting  system\r\n\r\nand  the  manual voting system simultaneously.  With  such  a\r\n\r\ndual voting system, a voter is given the choice either to use\r\n\r\nthe  computer screen or use the ballot paper to vote.   I  am\r\n\r\ncertain  that Singapore has the technology to put up  such  a\r\n\r\ndual voting system.  If this is done, it shall be fair to all\r\n\r\nthe  candidates, as every candidate shall be having the  same\r\n\r\nvoting system, albeit a mixed one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of system is fair, especially for the older\r\n\r\nvoters.   Old  voters are fearful of the computer.   This  is\r\n\r\nillustrated by the takeover of the Post Office Savings Bank\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby  the  DBS Bank.  After POSBank was taken over by DBS,  the\r\n\r\nformer bank introduced a lot of the banking work through  the\r\n\r\nATM  booths.  However, the older people still travel  to  the\r\n\r\nDBS Bank to deposit and withdraw their money.  Sometimes they\r\n\r\nhave  to wait in long queues to do so.  That was because they\r\n\r\nwere illiterate and had the fear of operating the computer at\r\n\r\nthe ATMs.  They did not make any attempts to learn to operate\r\n\r\nthe  ATMs.   These same old folks may have the fear  also  of\r\n\r\noperating the DRE voting machines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other part of the Bill concerns overseas\r\n\r\nelectors.  It is only right that Singapore citizens  residing\r\n\r\nabroad  should be allowed to exercise their right  to  choose\r\n\r\nthe Member of Parliament of their choice.  The act of casting\r\n\r\nhis vote for someone to represent him in Parliament is a very\r\n\r\nimportant  right.  It is only when a citizen has  chosen  his\r\n\r\nparliamentary representative that he can have a  say  in  the\r\n\r\naffairs  of  his  country,  through  his  representative   in\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citizens who are disqualified from voting are\r\n\r\nclearly  spelt out in the Act.  For example, people who  have\r\n\r\nnot  taken their oath of allegiance or are serving a sentence\r\n\r\nof  imprisonment or are of unsound mind, etc, are not allowed\r\n\r\nto   vote  in  a  parliamentary  election.   Sir,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand why the need to curb further a citizen's right  to\r\n\r\nvote  for a Member of Parliament by requiring him to stay  an\r\n\r\naggregate  of  two  years during the five  years  immediately\r\n\r\npreceding  the  date of gazetting his name in  the  electoral\r\n\r\nregister  of the next general election.  There is  already  a\r\n\r\nlaw  where  a  Singapore  citizen  cannot  reside  away  from\r\n\r\nSingapore for a continuous period of 10 years, failing  which\r\n\r\nhe  has  to  show  cause why he did not return  to  Singapore\r\n\r\nduring  that  period  of 10 years.  I think,  as  long  as  a\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen has complied with all the laws of the land,\r\n\r\nhe should be allowed to take part in a parliamentary election\r\n\r\nto  vote for a representative of his choice.  That should  be\r\n\r\nhis  right.   I think it is wrong to make a law  to  curb  or\r\n\r\ndiminish the right of a Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to oppose this\r\n\r\nBill,  particularly on the proposal to introduce  the  direct\r\n\r\nrecording electronic voting system in Singapore.  But  before\r\n\r\nI  speak  on the Bill and the clauses of the Bill on which  I\r\n\r\nhave  my  reservations, may I say that this Bill shows  again\r\n\r\nthat this Government gets its priorities wrong.  Why do I say\r\n\r\nthat the Government gets its priorities wrong?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, elections are the only test for\r\n\r\ndetermining  or showing that the Government of  the  day  has\r\n\r\nbeen  elected fairly and freely by the citizens, and not only\r\n\r\nthe Government of the day, but the Members of Parliament have\r\n\r\nbeen  elected  freely and fairly by all  citizens.   And  the\r\n\r\nclaim  to  democracy,  which we are  always  making  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry, can only be sustained if the public, the citizens of\r\n\r\nSingapore, repose full confidence in the electoral process of\r\n\r\nthis   country.   Sadly,  this  confidence  is   lacking   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I amplify that. In the 1980 general elections, when\r\n\r\nI  stood at Telok Blangah, I lost by a mere 500 votes to  the\r\n\r\nthen  PAP  candidate, Mr Rohan Khamis.  After the votes  were\r\n\r\ncounted,  the following day when I went around, a  number  of\r\n\r\npeople  expressed their total disbelief that I  had  lost  in\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah.  And this disbelief was fuelled by  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  a  ballot box had been left behind in one of the voting\r\n\r\nstations' centres for more than 20 minutes before the bus was\r\n\r\nsent  back to pick it up and take it to the counting  centre.\r\n\r\nSo  I  met a number of residents who said, \"How can  this  be\r\n\r\nthat you lost?  We were all so convinced that you should have\r\n\r\nwon  this seat.\"  I know it is easy for you, the PAP Members,\r\n\r\nto  laugh and shake your heads, but you have to take  account\r\n\r\nof the public perception.  You just cannot shut your ears and\r\n\r\neyes  to  it, like an ostrich, burying your head in the  sand\r\n\r\nand saying, \"Everything is all right.  We cannot see anything\r\n\r\nwrong, can we?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say again that in the 1993 presidential elections\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  widespread perception that the  candidate,  Mr\r\n\r\nChua,  had really won.  Well, you may again shake your  head,\r\n\r\nbut  I  have met a number of people who said they  could  not\r\n\r\nbelieve\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nit,  that  he  had  lost.  And this was again  fuelled,  this\r\n\r\nperception  was increased, by the fact that the  announcement\r\n\r\ncame  some three or four hours after all counting had ceased.\r\n\r\nAn  attempt  was made to explain this delay in Parliament  by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister that the facsimile machines  had  broken\r\n\r\ndown  or something.  But why the four-hour delay just because\r\n\r\nthe  two  facsimile machines had broken down?  So, there  was\r\n\r\nwidespread disbelief in the result of the elections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all very well for the Government to say it is all\r\n\r\nnonsense.   Whether  it  is nonsense  or  not,  a  democratic\r\n\r\nGovernment must take account of the perception of the  people\r\n\r\nso  that  they  may  repose the fullest confidence  that  the\r\n\r\nelectoral  process in their country is fair  and  free,  that\r\n\r\nelections are conducted fairly, that the citizens vote freely\r\n\r\nwithout  any  fear or compulsion, and that the  final  result\r\n\r\nrepresents  the choice of the people, not the choice  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1997 elections, again going back to my own\r\n\r\nconstituency  of  Cheng San, there was  widespread  disbelief\r\n\r\nthat  we  had lost.  This was again fuelled by the fact  that\r\n\r\nthere  was  this  long  delay between the  counting  and  the\r\n\r\nannouncement  of  the results, and by the fact  that  in  one\r\n\r\nelectoral  district in Cheng San GRC, the  number  of  ballot\r\n\r\npapers  that were found in the ballot box exceeded the number\r\n\r\non  the register for that area.  This was recorded by us  and\r\n\r\nreported.  There were also other irregularities.  We reported\r\n\r\nthat  in some cases, we had come across more than one  ballot\r\n\r\npaper  folded  together.  That could not have been  possible.\r\n\r\nSo,  a  number  of people were amazed that we  had  lost  and\r\n\r\nwondered what was behind our loss.  You have got to meet that\r\n\r\nsort  of  perception  and  assure  them  that  elections  are\r\n\r\nconducted  fairly  and  freely.   But  this  lack  of  public\r\n\r\nconfidence, Sir, stems primarily, if I may say so,  from  the\r\n\r\nfact  that the election activity in this country is conducted\r\n\r\nby the Government who itself is a party to the election.  How\r\n\r\ncould that be  -  a party who is taking part in the elections\r\n\r\nhas  the complete control of the elections as to what can  be\r\n\r\ndone, what should be done,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  how it should be carried out?  It makes nonsense of  the\r\n\r\nrule that any activity must be seen and manifestly seen to be\r\n\r\nfair.   And anyone can see, seeing a situation where a  party\r\n\r\nitself  to that activity, having the whole power to make  the\r\n\r\nrules  and  to run it, it is placed in a greater advantageous\r\n\r\nposition than the other party or parties taking part in it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing is that we have got to take the conduct\r\n\r\nof  elections  out  of  the hands of  the  Ministers  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Incidentally, may I know why is this Bill  being\r\n\r\nintroduced  by  the  Minister for Home  Affairs?   I  thought\r\n\r\nelections  come under the Prime Minister.  I thought  perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister was away, out of the country, but  I  see\r\n\r\nhim sitting here.  So I do not know why it has been handed to\r\n\r\nthe  Home Affairs Minister to introduce this Bill.  Is it not\r\n\r\nthe responsibility of the Prime Minister to explain this Bill\r\n\r\nand to answer Members of Parliament on it, unless tomorrow it\r\n\r\nis  going  to  be announced that the Elections Department  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to be put under the Ministry of Home Affairs?   May  I\r\n\r\nsay  that it is a matter to be regretted very much.   Do  not\r\n\r\nrise to it, Mr Wong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, this lack of confidence stems from the previous\r\n\r\nannouncements by the Government that it will know how  voters\r\n\r\nhave  voted  and  they do it deliberately,  taking  steps  to\r\n\r\nensure that they do know.  So in the 1997 elections, for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time,  we had precinct voting of five  or  six  blocks\r\n\r\ntogether, so that the Government may know how the voting  had\r\n\r\ngone,  whether there was a preponderance of Opposition voters\r\n\r\nor  PAP  voters.  If there was a preponderance of  Opposition\r\n\r\nvoters  in  that precinct, no upgrading, all benefits  to  be\r\n\r\nwithdrawn  from them.  How could you inspire confidence  when\r\n\r\nthere  is this fierce determination to win elections  at  any\r\n\r\ncost by the Government?  This was again demonstrated in Cheng\r\n\r\nSan  with the Prime Minister coming to the constituency,  and\r\n\r\nin  his  eve of poll rally intimidating the voters.   It  was\r\n\r\nnothing  short  of  that.  It was pure  intimidation  of  the\r\n\r\nvoters.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason for this lack of public confidence is\r\n\r\nthat  the  public  cannot place very  much  reliance  on  the\r\n\r\nintegrity and impartiality of the election officials.  When I\r\n\r\nmentioned this at the briefing two days ago, all the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home  Affairs could say was, \"Well, you take it  to  the\r\n\r\ncourt.\"   That  is  no answer.  Again, this impartiality  and\r\n\r\nlack  of  integrity on the part of officials was demonstrated\r\n\r\nin Cheng San GRC.  I myself made a complaint to the Assistant\r\n\r\nReturning  Officer at a particular voting station  about  the\r\n\r\npresence  of the Deputy Prime Minister in that station.   All\r\n\r\nhe could say was, \"All right, you write it out.\"  We wrote it\r\n\r\nout but nothing was done.  Then the Prime Minister turned up,\r\n\r\nnothing was done.  The officer did not have the power or  the\r\n\r\nstrength  to  tell  the Prime Minister and the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, \"Please leave.\"  So how can you place any  reliance\r\n\r\non  the  integrity  and impartiality of  election  officials?\r\n\r\nThese  are the things that we must look into, not race  along\r\n\r\nand  bring  in electronic voting because we want to  keep  up\r\n\r\nwith the times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not got very much time, so I must move on. May I\r\n\r\nsay  that this lack of public confidence also stems from  the\r\n\r\nfact that, unlike other countries, we do not have any NGOs in\r\n\r\nthis  country  to monitor and act as election  watch  on  the\r\n\r\nconduct of elections in this country.  In the Philippines and\r\n\r\nother  countries, there are these groups but,  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthere  is  nothing.   May I move on?  I  see  Mr  Speaker  is\r\n\r\nlooking at his time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I just move on to the DRE voting? As Mr Chiam has\r\n\r\nsaid,  may I ask what is the burning need to introduce direct\r\n\r\nrecording   electronic  voting?   Just  because  some   other\r\n\r\ncountries have introduced it, it does not necessarily  follow\r\n\r\nthat  we should also have it.  After all, how many voters  do\r\n\r\nwe  have?   Less  than two million. What  is  the  saving  in\r\n\r\nintroducing  this?   Is it time?  From what  I  saw  at  this\r\n\r\nbriefing, I think more time would be taken up with the direct\r\n\r\nrecording  electronic  voting than  in  the  straight  ballot\r\n\r\nvoting.   I  then mentioned what Mr Chiam said about  elderly\r\n\r\npeople  having trouble and I was laughed at.  But it involves\r\n\r\nofficials going\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  advise them, showing them how to use the machine.  Again,\r\n\r\ncan  one  trust  the impartiality and integrity  of  election\r\n\r\nofficials?   Could the Minister tell us what is  the  burning\r\n\r\nurgency to introduce the DRE voting system in this country?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you take a GRC constituency, how many voters do you\r\n\r\nhave?   100,000  or more.  In Cheng San, it  was  only  about\r\n\r\n100,000  and it was supposed to be a big GRC.  How long  will\r\n\r\nit  take  to  count 100,000 votes?  It will only  take  three\r\n\r\nhours,  as  it did at Cheng San.  What is the big deal  about\r\n\r\nthis  electronic  counting?  What is most  important  is  not\r\n\r\nspeed, but to see that everything that is done is done fairly\r\n\r\nand  justly.  That is far more important than speed.   May  I\r\n\r\ncommend that to the Government.  The Government prides itself\r\n\r\non  its  efficacy and efficiency.  Some think it is  far  too\r\n\r\nefficient.  It does not take into account human factors.   It\r\n\r\ndoes  not  take into account the feelings of people.   It  is\r\n\r\nonly  concerned  with  efficiency, like a  ruthless  machine,\r\n\r\nregardless of the suffering or inconvenience caused.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, about the fear of being found out, more than one\r\n\r\nspeaker  has  mentioned about the fear in  people  that  with\r\n\r\nelectronic voting, it only increases the possibility of their\r\n\r\nvotes being known, even before they are counted.  How are you\r\n\r\ngoing to assuage this fear?  By simply telling them, \"No,  we\r\n\r\nwon't  do  it.  You can trust us.\"  That is not good  enough.\r\n\r\nYou  have  got  to  hand it over to an independent  elections\r\n\r\ncommission.   Election officials must  be  recruited  by  the\r\n\r\ncommission from outside.  Then people might say, \"All  right,\r\n\r\nwe  can  see that it is going to be conducted by a completely\r\n\r\nindependent  commission.\"  And there will be NGOs  monitoring\r\n\r\nthe  elections.   Then we can see openly that  our  electoral\r\n\r\nprocess  is  fair  and free.  So my serious  advice  to  this\r\n\r\nGovernment is:  do things that are necessary and important to\r\n\r\nrestore public confidence in the electoral system, and do not\r\n\r\nrush into electronic voting because it is modern or it is  to\r\n\r\nkeep up with the times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, the voter strength must be running into 50-60\r\n\r\nmillion or more.  Here,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nit  is  less than 2 million.  In India, they are planning  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  it.  But what is the voter strength  there?   Does\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  voter  strength have any  comparison  to  the\r\n\r\nIndian voter strength?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I say a few words about the overseas voters?\r\n\r\nAs  has  been mentioned, it seems to me an exercise to garner\r\n\r\nmore PAP votes.  Why, as has been asked, this discrimination?\r\n\r\nYou  exclude people who are living outside Singapore, but who\r\n\r\nare just as much concerned about Singapore, just because they\r\n\r\nhave  not  lived  here for two years during  the  five  years\r\n\r\npreceding.  But you open it to all those who are in some  way\r\n\r\nobligated  to  the Government.  Of course, these  people  are\r\n\r\nobligated  to  the Government.  They feel that  it  is  their\r\n\r\nnational  duty to vote for the Government.  So,  is  this  an\r\n\r\nattempt  to  increase  the PAP vote,  and  to  see  that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition suffers as a result of it?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I mention a case in point, my own son who is in\r\n\r\nLondon?  Why is he in London?  Because he cannot get a job in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Why can he not get a job in Singapore?   Because\r\n\r\nhe  has got my name.  He is an economist.  The MAS would  not\r\n\r\ngive  him  a  job, and the banks are worried about  employing\r\n\r\nhim.   So  he  cannot  get a job here.  And  he  cannot  vote\r\n\r\nbecause he has not been here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is Mr Ho Juan Thai. He has been living in London.\r\n\r\nHe  cannot vote, but he is just as much concerned about  what\r\n\r\ngoes on in Singapore, as any other Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, why are you discriminating? Is it, as I said, to\r\n\r\nsee that only those who will vote for the PAP are allowed  to\r\n\r\nvote?    I  would  ask  the  Minister  to  refer  this  Bill,\r\n\r\nparticularly  because of the introduction of the  DRE  voting\r\n\r\nsystem, to a Select Committee.  As Mr Chiam has said, let the\r\n\r\npublic  get  more acquainted with this.  Let the  public  air\r\n\r\ntheir  views about the introduction of the DRE voting system,\r\n\r\nwhether  they have any fears.  And this will be  possible  if\r\n\r\nyou  refer this Bill to a Select Committee which will  invite\r\n\r\nrepresentations.  It is good sometimes to let the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npublic  have  their  say.   We  get,  time  and  time  again,\r\n\r\nGovernment  Ministers saying, \"Speak up, speak  up.   Let  us\r\n\r\nknow  what  you  think.\"  But you have got to  give  them  an\r\n\r\nopportunity.  And you give them an opportunity, on Bills like\r\n\r\nthis  which  concern a very important activity of  them,   to\r\n\r\ncome  and say what they think about it, what they think about\r\n\r\nhow  elections are being conducted in this country.  Do  they\r\n\r\nhave  full confidence in our electoral process?  So,  please,\r\n\r\ndo  not  be  in  a  hurry to introduce this Bill.   The  next\r\n\r\nelections may be just months ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another thing. Why is this kept secret?\r\n\r\nPlease  do  not laugh.  You know, Canon Adams,  who  was  the\r\n\r\nprincipal of St. Andrew's School when I was there, said  that\r\n\r\npeople  sometimes laugh just because they are nervous.   They\r\n\r\ndo  not  know  what  to do.  So they burst  into  involuntary\r\n\r\nlaughter.   So please refer this Bill to a Select  Committee.\r\n\r\nBut, more importantly, if you want the world to say that  the\r\n\r\nelections  in Singapore are conducted fairly and freely,  and\r\n\r\nmore  than the world, if you want our people to say  that  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  the elections are conducted fairly and freely  and\r\n\r\nwe can repose the full confidence, please proceed immediately\r\n\r\nto appoint an independent elections commission, and hand over\r\n\r\nthe  conduct  of  the  elections to  a  totally  independent,\r\n\r\nneutral  body, which will hold the scales firmly between  the\r\n\r\nGovernment party and the Opposition parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport of this Bill.  But before I proceed to speak  on  one\r\n\r\nor  two  points,  I  just  want to  respond  to  one  or  two\r\n\r\nparticular comments Mr Jeyaretnam has made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly troubled that he has chosen to make\r\n\r\nsweeping   statements   that   impugn   the   integrity   and\r\n\r\nimpartiality  of  the public officials.  I think  it  is  one\r\n\r\nthing  to  take offence or have issue with a process  or  the\r\n\r\nlegitimacy or merits of an argument.  But I think it is quite\r\n\r\nanother\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  cast  such fundamental doubt on all officials in sweeping\r\n\r\nstatements.  And I am particularly concerned by this because,\r\n\r\nas  an ex-civil servant, I have been involved in the election\r\n\r\nprocess as a Returning Officer.  I know how seriously we took\r\n\r\nthe  process.   The import of the process was impressed  upon\r\n\r\nus,  and  we  discharged it to the best of our  ability.   It\r\n\r\nwould  appear, by Mr Jeyaretnam's reckoning, the only  way  a\r\n\r\npublic   official  could  prove  his  impartiality   was   to\r\n\r\nfacilitate an Opposition victory.  Sir, I would hope that  we\r\n\r\ncould be somewhat more measured when we make comments on such\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the Bill itself, I wish to just focus on two key\r\n\r\npoints.   The first is on overseas voting.  It is clear  that\r\n\r\nthe  Bill seeks to strike a balance between, on the one hand,\r\n\r\nendowing a very basic privilege of voting on Singaporeans who\r\n\r\nreside  overseas  and, on the other hand, the need to  assure\r\n\r\nourselves  that  there  is a certain stake  in  the  country,\r\n\r\nemotionally,  perhaps materially, so that they  do  not  take\r\n\r\nthis  privilege frivolously.  In that sense, I think the Bill\r\n\r\nhas  made  a  good attempt.  But there are some who  ask  the\r\n\r\nquestion,  \"Why  not extend the vote to all Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nreside  overseas,  other than those who,  by  their  conduct,\r\n\r\ncriminal  and  otherwise, may have excluded themselves?\"   In\r\n\r\nother  words,  why  not  just let  citizenship  be  the  only\r\n\r\ncriterion for voting?  And there are sufficient, in a  sense,\r\n\r\nadministrative   hurdles  that  the  individual   Singaporean\r\n\r\noverseas  has  to overcome, in terms of maintaining  a  local\r\n\r\naddress,   in  terms  of  registering  at  various   overseas\r\n\r\nregistration centres within 21 days, and also the  fact  that\r\n\r\nin  many  places, these centres are in main cities.  So  they\r\n\r\nmay  have to make a special effort to do so, given that there\r\n\r\nis  a  significant effort involved before a person can become\r\n\r\nan overseas voter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I think there is merit to argue a case\r\n\r\nthat  we should assure ourselves that there is something more\r\n\r\nthan  just the effort to vote, that there is a desire  and  a\r\n\r\nstake  in  the  outcome of the election.  In that  regard,  I\r\n\r\nthink the criteria that have been outlined are generally self-evident.  But like Prof. Chin\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwho spoke earlier, it appears to introduce dual standards, on\r\n\r\nthe  one hand, for those who are agents of the public service\r\n\r\nwho  are  overseas, whether it is for educational reasons  or\r\n\r\nfor reasons of service or deployment, and, on the other hand,\r\n\r\nthose  who  are in the private sector who have to demonstrate\r\n\r\nthis  aggregate two-year residence out of the preceding  five\r\n\r\nyears before they are eligible to vote.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since Prof. Chin has made all the points, I just\r\n\r\nwant  to illustrate one example.  If we take students who  go\r\n\r\noverseas  to  do their post graduate programmes,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nunusual for those doing a PhD to spend 4-5 years on a PhD and\r\n\r\npost-doctoral  work.   And it would  be  difficult  for  such\r\n\r\nindividuals to come back and satisfy this two-year  aggregate\r\n\r\nresidence requirement.  Yet, I think we would be hard pressed\r\n\r\nto  doubt  their  commitment to Singapore  because,  in  many\r\n\r\ninstances, they would be funded by their parents and I  think\r\n\r\nmany  of  them  would want to come back and  discharge  their\r\n\r\nfinancial as well as their familial obligations.  So I  would\r\n\r\nhope  that we could consider these cases and, in that regard,\r\n\r\nwhether  the  two-year  requirement is rather  stringent  and\r\n\r\nwhether it can actually be lowered or moderated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the matter of electronic voting, the comment I\r\n\r\nwish to make is that Singaporeans are used to our paper-based\r\n\r\nsystem.   It is a tried and tested process which Singaporeans\r\n\r\nunderstand  and have confidence in.  We are making  a  change\r\n\r\nand we can debate the merits of the change, etc.  But I think\r\n\r\nthe  key  point here is that it will raise some questions  in\r\n\r\nthe  minds  of  voters,  in  particular,  pertaining  to  the\r\n\r\nsecurity and secrecy of the data, in this case, the vote.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, electronic systems have shown that they are not\r\n\r\nfree   of   glitches.    And  also  to   many   Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the older groups, a computer or any  electronic\r\n\r\ndevice  is  really a black box, a box that they do not  fully\r\n\r\nunderstand  and  they  therefore  have  some  difficulty   in\r\n\r\nmustering confidence in.  This is probably analogous  to  why\r\n\r\nmany people still have problems with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot   just   using   Internet   banking   or   Internet-based\r\n\r\ntransactions,    but   even   registering   for    Giro-based\r\n\r\ntransactions.   So it would be useful if the  Minister  could\r\n\r\nelaborate  how  we are going to be able to  ensure  that  our\r\n\r\nvoters  are confident, not just familiar with  -   using  the\r\n\r\nparlance of manufacturing  -  the front-end system of how  to\r\n\r\ndo  the  vote,  but also where we can engender confidence  in\r\n\r\nthem  in  the  back-end system, in terms of its security  and\r\n\r\nsecrecy, so that they can accept the new system with ease and\r\n\r\nwith peace of mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, because of the regional economic  development,\r\n\r\nthere  are now more than 100,000 Singaporeans who are staying\r\n\r\noverseas on a long-term basis to work or to do business.   At\r\n\r\nthe  general  election which is held once every  five  years,\r\n\r\nthey still have the right to exercise their voting rights and\r\n\r\nto  elect  the  Member  of Parliament who  they  think  could\r\n\r\nrepresent them.  I think it is a good suggestion that   these\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens be allowed to vote overseas, and I support\r\n\r\nthis Bill.  However, I have a few suggestions to make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Singapore is a small country. The polling\r\n\r\nstations are normally set up not too far away from home,  and\r\n\r\ntransportation is very convenient in Singapore.  However,  if\r\n\r\nyou stay overseas, it is not so easy.  For example, in China,\r\n\r\nthere  are 36 provinces.  If we have only one polling station\r\n\r\nin  Beijing, those Singapore citizens who are staying in  the\r\n\r\nother provinces may have to spend a few days' time to take  a\r\n\r\nplane,  a  train or even to drive a long distance  to  go  to\r\n\r\nBeijing to cast their votes.  They will have to spend  a  lot\r\n\r\nof time and money just to cast their votes.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.17 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this new Bill, overseas voting is not\r\n\r\nmandatory.   Because  of  the  inconvenience,  some  overseas\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens who are eligible to vote may\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsimply  give up their rights to do so.  Therefore, I  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government consider making it easier for  them  to\r\n\r\nvote,  for example, voting through the mail.  The voters  can\r\n\r\nthen  save  a  lot  of time and money.   In  this  way,  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who are staying overseas would be able  to  vote\r\n\r\nat the general election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, some overseas Singapore citizens could have\r\n\r\nbeen staying away from Singapore for many years. They may not\r\n\r\nbe  familiar with the background and the curriculum vitae  of\r\n\r\nthe  candidates,  particularly when the  new  candidates  are\r\n\r\nnormally  introduced only shortly before  the  election.   In\r\n\r\nthis way, can the Government facilitate these candidates with\r\n\r\nsome means to communicate with their voters?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the Government let the candidates have\r\n\r\naccess  to  the correspondence addresses of these  voters  so\r\n\r\nthat  the candidates can introduce themselves and their plans\r\n\r\nthey  have  for their constituencies, to these voters.   This\r\n\r\nwould  also  help  the overseas voters make  some  considered\r\n\r\ndecision  to  elect  the best person  to  represent  them  in\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to electronic voting, I would say that this\r\n\r\nsystem  is a product of high technology.  It will save  time,\r\n\r\nsave manpower and provide accurate calculations.  However, on\r\n\r\nits operation, I have two points to ask of the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often said that we have to be ever ready for any\r\n\r\neventuality.  On election day, in the event of a breakdown or\r\n\r\nfailure  of  the  electronic voting system in any  particular\r\n\r\nconstituency, does the Returning Officer have the  discretion\r\n\r\nto  switch  back  to the traditional voting  method  so  that\r\n\r\nvoting  can be completed in the same day?   According to  the\r\n\r\nBill,  under the circumstances, the voting in that particular\r\n\r\nconstituency  can  be postponed until a few  days  later.   I\r\n\r\nthink  this  is  not fair because the results  of  the  other\r\n\r\nconstituencies  may  affect  the original  decisions  of  the\r\n\r\nvoters in this constituency. Therefore, I suggest that in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nevent  of a failure in the electronic voting system  on  that\r\n\r\nday  and  it could not be rectified in time, we should  allow\r\n\r\nthe voters to use the traditional voting method, so that they\r\n\r\ncan  complete all the voting within that day.  But I  do  not\r\n\r\nagree  with  Mr  Chiam See Tong's proposal to use  electronic\r\n\r\nvoting and the traditional paper voting simultaneously.  This\r\n\r\nwill only cause confusion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this new concept of electronic voting will be\r\n\r\nstrongly  supported by the young people and  those  who  have\r\n\r\nknowledge of computers.  But to the older people or for those\r\n\r\nwho  have  absolutely  no knowledge of computer  usage,  they\r\n\r\nwould  have  some  psychological barrier and  fear  for  this\r\n\r\nelectronic   voting.   So,  before  we  implement  electronic\r\n\r\nvoting,   the   Government   should   educate   the   voters,\r\n\r\nparticularly the senior citizens, so that everyone  would  be\r\n\r\nfamiliar  and know how to use this electronic voting  system.\r\n\r\nThis  will alleviate or remove their fear for such a  system,\r\n\r\nand will reduce the number of blank votes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that the electronic voting system can be\r\n\r\nimplemented smoothly during the general election, I think the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  make  some early  announcement  on  which\r\n\r\nconstituencies would adopt this electronic voting system,  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  voters  there  can  be  psychologically  prepared.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  hope  that the Government will not  pick  Potong\r\n\r\nPasir  as one of these constituencies so that Mr Chiam  would\r\n\r\nnot be so unduly worried.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, I participated in the simulated\r\n\r\nelectronic  voting exercise, and I found  that  it  was  very\r\n\r\nsimple   and  easy  to  use.   We  should  help  the  voters,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  senior citizens.  Let them have  a  hands-on\r\n\r\nexperience  before  the actual voting.  This  will  build  up\r\n\r\ntheir  confidence  and  ensure that  this  electronic  voting\r\n\r\nsystem will be more effective and  convenient to our voters.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I will limit myself to comments on the Bill\r\n\r\nrather than to elections or, more generally, democracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to say, in my view, that voting is\r\n\r\nnot  a  privilege for Singaporean citizens.  It is clearly  a\r\n\r\nright.  Even if it is not in the Constitution itself, because\r\n\r\nwe  uphold  the idea of a voting democracy, it  is  a  right.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I would also say it is a duty, because in Singapore\r\n\r\nif  you  do not vote, you have to explain yourself or  pay  a\r\n\r\nfine.  So it is a right and a duty, and not a privilege.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Bill, I would, first, very strongly\r\n\r\nwelcome the move towards overseas voting.  This is an  effort\r\n\r\nreally  that  symbolises a transformation in  thinking  about\r\n\r\nSingapore  and who are fully Singaporeans.  We have  come  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  that globalisation and our own attempts to  engage\r\n\r\nwith  the international economy require Singaporeans to work,\r\n\r\nstudy  and  live abroad.  If 10 or 15 years ago, Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  lived  abroad somehow were less-Singaporeans,  I  think,\r\n\r\ntoday  increasingly, we see that we are linked to  them.   In\r\n\r\nsome  ways they help us and they are part of those  who  live\r\n\r\nhere.   And  I think this is a profoundly important  gesture,\r\n\r\ngiven   what  we  have  said  in  Singapore  21  about   also\r\n\r\nencouraging  Singaporeans to work abroad, and yet  to  remain\r\n\r\nSingaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question then I have heard in this House is really a\r\n\r\nquestion of \"how\".  How do we qualify people?  And, then, how\r\n\r\ndo   we   reach   out  to  them?   In  thinking   about   the\r\n\r\nqualifications  of who abroad should be allowed  to  vote,  I\r\n\r\nthink  an  important premise, first, is  Article  12  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  This promises an equality among people.   This\r\n\r\nequality  is not absolute but must be rational and linked  to\r\n\r\nan  objective.  As others have said, the rationale here is to\r\n\r\nmake  sure that those abroad who vote are those who have some\r\n\r\nconnection  and  stake here.  I do not want to  quarrel  then\r\n\r\nabout this two-out-of-five years criterion, or whatever.  But\r\n\r\nI  do share the concern that an exception is made to the rule\r\n\r\nfor those who are in Government service.  We can see that the\r\n\r\nline  between them and other Singaporeans overseas is narrow.\r\n\r\nSingapore  Airlines  is  clearly,  in  sentiment,   part   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  If you have to serve as an SIA Station Manager or\r\n\r\nwhatever for more than three years out of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfive,  I  will  be  at a loss to explain to  somebody  why  a\r\n\r\nSingapore Airlines' Station Manager could not vote when he is\r\n\r\nserving  Singapore, in that sense, abroad.  But yet,  because\r\n\r\nit  is  a GLC and not a Singapore Government statutory board,\r\n\r\nhe  would  not  qualify.  So I think we need  to  think  this\r\n\r\nthrough  and perhaps expand it to include all Singapore-based\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  perhaps even multi-nationals here,  which  do\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  Singapore and find it invaluable  to  take  our\r\n\r\nSingaporeans abroad with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the reverse side, I think we should be very open, in\r\n\r\nfact, about disallowing Singaporeans with permanent residency\r\n\r\nin  other  countries and dual citizenship.  We  have  already\r\n\r\ntalked  about  this  in  a previous Bill  about  leaving  the\r\n\r\nengagement of Singapore politics to Singaporeans, and I think\r\n\r\nwe  should  equally  be frank that if you are  a  Singaporean\r\n\r\ncitizen  but  have  decided  to formally  take  up  permanent\r\n\r\nresidence abroad or dual citizenship, which our laws  do  not\r\n\r\nrecognise, we should say this would not do for voting.   With\r\n\r\nthese two ideas, I agree with the idea that we need some pre-qualification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is the effort of how to reach out. If\r\n\r\nI  am  correct  -  I  stand  for correction  here  -  in  the\r\n\r\nMinister's preparatory remarks, but not in the Bill, there is\r\n\r\na  sense that we will apply this overseas voting only to some\r\n\r\nembassies   abroad   where  there   are   concentrations   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and our embassy staff are sufficient to  support\r\n\r\nthis.  At first glance, this makes some sense.  But with this\r\n\r\nidea  of equality, one may come back and say, \"Well, how come\r\n\r\nif I choose to be in Finland, I am unequal to somebody who is\r\n\r\nin Australia?\"  Secondly, looking at all things practical, we\r\n\r\nmust  recognise that there are limitations.  Even if you have\r\n\r\nan embassy in Canberra, this does not make it easier to reach\r\n\r\nout  to  people in Sydney.  We have an embassy in Washington,\r\n\r\nbut you could be in Seattle, which is half way home already.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in all these processes of how to reach out, I think\r\n\r\nwe have to come to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nidea  that  beyond actually turning up at the embassy,  there\r\n\r\nhas  to  be an idea of some verified form of voting by  mail.\r\n\r\nAnd if this is done for big countries, there is no reason why\r\n\r\nit  cannot be done in smaller countries allover the world, so\r\n\r\nall those Singaporeans who are dispersed in small communities\r\n\r\nabroad  might also be allowed to vote (provided,  of  course,\r\n\r\nthey pass the other qualification of who can vote).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to bring up about voting\r\n\r\noverseas  is - perhaps because I do not understand  the  Bill\r\n\r\nfully  -  I do not see how this Bill helps those Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  happen to go abroad during election day.  That is, I  am\r\n\r\nnormally resident here but because of work commitments and  I\r\n\r\ncannot be in Singapore physically on voting day,  I may  have\r\n\r\nplanned my work commitments, say, three or six months  ahead,\r\n\r\nand voting (Election day) in Singapore is more a mystery than\r\n\r\nthat.  I do not see why we should not in the same spirit have\r\n\r\na  system for pre-voting for those people who live here,  but\r\n\r\njust  happen to be abroad on that particular day.  Those  are\r\n\r\nmy comments about overseas voting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On electronic voting, there has been a lot of debate\r\n\r\nhere in this House, and I would only say that when I look  at\r\n\r\nother  countries,  I see systems that are either  incompetent\r\n\r\nand  some  which are just outrageously corrupt.  I think,  in\r\n\r\ngeneral,  in Singapore, we avoided both these problems.   But\r\n\r\nstill  I  do take the Minister's point that in our commitment\r\n\r\nto  e-government, in our crunch on manpower, and in our  wish\r\n\r\nto  avoid the kind of embarrassing problems we saw in the  US\r\n\r\nPresidential  Election, there is a sense  in  moving  towards\r\n\r\ndirect recording electronic voting.  And here, I just want to\r\n\r\nshare  the  views  of  a number of other MPs,  including  the\r\n\r\nMember for Sembawang GRC, Prof. Chin, and the Member for West\r\n\r\nCoast  GRC,  Mr Iswaran, that a new system can have  glitches\r\n\r\nand  that  effort must be made to educate voters,  especially\r\n\r\nthose who are uncomfortable with the e-world.  In this sense,\r\n\r\nI would not ask for a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  but rather I would ask the  Government  to\r\n\r\nreassure  us  that  our  system  will  actually  somehow   be\r\n\r\nimproved,  and that we implement the feedback,  not  so  much\r\n\r\nfrom  the  voters  themselves and the computer  experts,  but\r\n\r\nrather  from  grassroots organisations and,  yes,  even  some\r\n\r\nelected  Opposition  MPs.  I think they should  help  in  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of this programme so that they can see  it  up\r\n\r\nclose  and  be  reassured  that we are  substituting  a  more\r\n\r\nefficient,  better  system  for one  that  has  been  so  far\r\n\r\nfundamentally sound.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. I\r\n\r\nhave  only one point to make and it has, in fact, been raised\r\n\r\nby Members before.  So I would be very brief.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to join Prof. Chin, Mr Iswaran and Mr Tay\r\n\r\nin asking that the Minister consider including in the list of\r\n\r\npersons eligible, who may not have the requisite two  out  of\r\n\r\nfive  preceding years, not only those members of the  SAF  or\r\n\r\nGovernment  employees or scholars, but also the employees  of\r\n\r\nprivate   locally  registered  companies  or   multi-national\r\n\r\ncompanies  who  are  legitimately on  prolonged  overseas  or\r\n\r\ninternational postings, as well as students who are  overseas\r\n\r\nfor  long periods on their own funding.  Because I think that\r\n\r\nall these Singaporeans count, be it that they are overseas on\r\n\r\npublic  service  or in the employment of the private  sector.\r\n\r\nThat is all that I have to contribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, it is 5.30 pm now, and we still\r\n\r\nhave  a few more speakers.
