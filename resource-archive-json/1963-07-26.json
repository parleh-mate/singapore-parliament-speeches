Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  control over the Press  and  other\r\n\r\nmedia  of  propaganda, confusion  has  been  brought\r\n\r\nabout as to the basic issues involved in the dispute\r\n\r\nof the Harbour Board workers,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand also a deliberate distortion of facts  has\r\n\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Harbour Board workers have been\r\n\r\nsubjected  to all sorts of victimisation  for  quite\r\n\r\nsome   time   now.  They  have  been  subjected   to\r\n\r\nvictimisation  since  the  days  of   the   previous\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Today, the Singapore People's  Alliance\r\n\r\nled   by   the  Member  for  Cairnhill   comes   out\r\n\r\nchampioning the cause of the Harbour Board  workers.\r\n\r\nI  notice  the Member for Cairnhill wishes to  raise\r\n\r\nthe  dispute  of the Port workers in an  adjournment\r\n\r\nmotion.  Sir, I would like to say here that  he  and\r\n\r\nhis  Government have not been any more  tolerant  or\r\n\r\nsympathetic to the water-front workers. The Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock  Government encouraged union rivalry, sponsored\r\n\r\nyellow  unions and victimised generally the  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  workers because they rejected the anti-labour\r\n\r\npolicies  of  his Government. It will be  remembered\r\n\r\nhow  his Government had refused recognition  of  the\r\n\r\nunion  and had withdrawn the citizenship certificate\r\n\r\nof  the Secretary-General. Therefore, I suggest that\r\n\r\ntoday  if  the  Member for Cairnhill comes  out  and\r\n\r\nsupport  the cause of the Harbour Board workers,  it\r\n\r\nis  because elections are around the corner  and  he\r\n\r\nhas  some vested interests in going to Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nas we can see from the newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to understand the dispute of the Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  workers  in  the proper  perspective,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to go back a little to trace the source of\r\n\r\ndispute. In 1957 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I trust the hon. Member is not\r\n\r\nexciting a debate on the Harbour Board dispute as  a\r\n\r\ndispute, because the motion is in general terms.  It\r\n\r\ndoes  not  refer specifically to the  Harbour  Board\r\n\r\ndispute. It can be mentioned, of course, in passing.\r\n\r\nBut  we  are not debating at the moment the  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I wish to touch on the Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  dispute merely to show how and to what extent\r\n\r\nthe  present Government is using State machinery  to\r\n\r\ndisrupt unions which reject political control by the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Before I could touch on the actual  acts\r\n\r\nindulged in by the present Government in the  recent\r\n\r\nHarbour Board dispute, acts which show\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconclusively  that the motivation  is  political,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  necessary to understand  briefly  the\r\n\r\nproblems  that the Harbour Board Union is  concerned\r\n\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We submit that the Government has been completely\r\n\r\nunprincipled  in its handling of the  Harbour  Board\r\n\r\ndispute.  Today, the Harbour Board Staff Association\r\n\r\nregistration has been cancelled. The Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas unilaterally appointed a committee on behalf  of\r\n\r\nthe Harbour Board workers. All this has been done in\r\n\r\nthe name of solving the dispute of the Harbour Board\r\n\r\nworkers.  But we say this is just a cover,  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  act in the Harbour Board  only  confirms\r\n\r\nour  contention that the Government has consistently\r\n\r\nbeen using State machinery to break trade unions and\r\n\r\ntrade union unity in the sector where the P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nno influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may just briefly say this. In 1957 a\r\n\r\nCourt  of  Inquiry  was appointed  by  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment which made certain recommendations to  be\r\n\r\naccepted  by both disputing parties - the  Board  and\r\n\r\nthe  workers.  The  present Prime Minister  was  the\r\n\r\nlegal adviser to the Union then and he presented the\r\n\r\ncase  on  behalf of the Harbour Board  workers.  But\r\n\r\nsince the recommendations were published, they  have\r\n\r\nnever been implemented. After the elections in 1959,\r\n\r\nthere   was   a  general  expectation   that   these\r\n\r\nrecommendations would be implemented, but the  major\r\n\r\nrecommendations   up  till   now   have   not   been\r\n\r\nimplemented.  Ever since 1959 after  the  elections,\r\n\r\nthe  Government attitude to the Harbour Board  Staff\r\n\r\nAssociation   has   been   governed   by   political\r\n\r\nconsiderations. The P.A.P. Government sought to make\r\n\r\nthe  Harbour Board Staff Association a tool  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  It was decided that if they  could  not\r\n\r\nget  control of the Harbour Board Staff Association,\r\n\r\nit  would  discredit and disrupt  the  organisation.\r\n\r\nSir, in the minds of the P.A.P., it was a very clear\r\n\r\ndecision. Either the Harbour Board Staff Association\r\n\r\nhad  to  be  a P.A.P. organisation or it had  to  be\r\n\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All attempts since 1959 to control the Union\r\n\r\nfailed.  Then, having failed in this, the  force  of\r\n\r\nState machinery was introduced. Leaders of the Union\r\n\r\nwere prosecuted and smeared. Following the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourt case, the Secretary-General of the Union,  Mr\r\n\r\nJamit  Singh, and the Vice-President, Mr  Chok  Koh\r\n\r\nThong,  were  detained  under  the  Preservation  of\r\n\r\nPublic  Security  Ordinance.  Immediately  following\r\n\r\nthis,  yet  another attempt was made to capture  the\r\n\r\nUnion. In the process of it, the State machinery  as\r\n\r\nusual  was  used.  The  C.I.D. called  up  Committee\r\n\r\nmembers,  questioned them and threatened  them.  The\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Trade Unions meddled  and  interfered\r\n\r\nwith  the  affairs  of the Union. But  unfortunately\r\n\r\nfor,  the  Government,  Sir,  these  attempts  again\r\n\r\nfailed. In March, the State machinery was used to  a\r\n\r\ngreater  extent.  On  instructions  from  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  the  Harbour  Board  management  withdrew\r\n\r\nrecognition of the Executive Committee of the  Union\r\n\r\non the grounds that there were two Committees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to explain this myth of two Committees\r\n\r\nbecause  a  certain amount of confusion  has  arisen\r\n\r\nbecause  of  Government propaganda. The position  in\r\n\r\nMarch  in  the  Harbour Board Staff Association  was\r\n\r\nthat there was only one Executive Council led by Mr\r\n\r\nS.  Markandu,  and that had been the position  since\r\n\r\nNovember   1961.  In  November  1961,   there   were\r\n\r\nelections in the Union. The Executive Council led by\r\n\r\nMarkandu was elected. A member had taken a case  out\r\n\r\nand  the  High  Court is to determine whether  these\r\n\r\nelections  were in accordance with the  constitution\r\n\r\nof  the  Union. Sir, my understanding of  the  legal\r\n\r\nposition  is  until  such time  as  the  High  Court\r\n\r\ndecides  that  the elections conducted  in  November\r\n\r\nwere not in accordance with the constitution of  the\r\n\r\nUnion,  the Committee that had been elected was  the\r\n\r\nrightful  authority in the Union. The Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nmanagement  had  recognised this  position  and  had\r\n\r\nentered into industrial relations from November last\r\n\r\nuntil  March  this  year. But  in  March,  when  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  failed  in all  its  endeavours  to\r\n\r\ncapture  the  Union,  it gave  instructions  to  the\r\n\r\nHarbour Board management to withdraw recognition  of\r\n\r\nthe   Union  and  seize  the  Union  premises.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment instructed the Registrar of Trade  Unions\r\n\r\nto  freeze  the  funds  of the Union,  amounting  to\r\n\r\n$120,000.  This  was a very blatant abuse  of  State\r\n\r\npower. Following this, further attempts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  made  but they could not deceive the  workers,\r\n\r\nand the resistance to Government control remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, the Prime Minister called officials of\r\n\r\nthe new Committee to his office. Perhaps one reading\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers  would have felt  that  it  was  the\r\n\r\nofficials  of the Union who were going  to  see  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister. The fact is that the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nsits in his office; he decides he wants to have  Mr\r\n\r\nMarkandu  and company and someone else  on  the  old\r\n\r\nCommittee to come to his office; and all he does  is\r\n\r\nto  phone  up the Harbour Board management and  tell\r\n\r\nthem  to  put these officials in the car  and  bring\r\n\r\nthem safely to the Prime Minister's Office. Sir,  it\r\n\r\nis  not  an exaggeration to say that these officials\r\n\r\nhad  to  be manhandled in order that they  could  be\r\n\r\nbrought  to  the  Prime Minister's Office,  to  have\r\n\r\ntheir  pictures taken by television cameramen, Press\r\n\r\ncameramen and so on, to give the impression that the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister was neutral and impartial, trying  to\r\n\r\nsolve  the  dispute  by  getting  two  rival  groups\r\n\r\ntogether. There were no two rival groups. There  was\r\n\r\nonly  one  group. The other group was a group  being\r\n\r\ninstigated by the P.A.P. to put up some rivalry. But\r\n\r\nthe  legal  status, as I have said,  was  such  that\r\n\r\nthere  was  only  one  committee.  However,  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of all these so-called conferences  in  the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister's  Office,  the  P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nsucceeded, to some extent, in giving the public  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that  there were two Committees  in  the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board,  that there was  rivalry,  and  that\r\n\r\ntherefore the Government was justified in asking the\r\n\r\nHarbour Board to withdraw recognition of the  Union,\r\n\r\nto  take  away the Union's funds, to take  away  the\r\n\r\nUnion's  premises.  It all suited  the  Government's\r\n\r\nmachinations,   Mr  Speaker,   because   what   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wanted  was to set  up  a  Committee  of\r\n\r\nstooges in the Harbour Board; and if they could play\r\n\r\nup  this  myth that there were these two  Committees\r\n\r\nfighting each other, that both had no legal  status,\r\n\r\nthen  the  Government  hoped they  could  give  some\r\n\r\njustification in selecting a handful of henchmen  to\r\n\r\nrepresent the Harbour Board workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at these meetings, the Prime Minister put up\r\n\r\na  suggestion  of electing a Committee  and  it  was\r\n\r\nturned down. The Union's view was, briefly, that  if\r\n\r\na  negotiating  Committee or, for that  matter,  any\r\n\r\nother Committee, was going to be elected in the name\r\n\r\nof  the Harbour Board workers to represent them  and\r\n\r\ntheir  Union, then that right of selection  must  be\r\n\r\nwith  the  workers and not with the Prime  Minister.\r\n\r\nSir, it is particularly farcical in a situation like\r\n\r\nthis where the Singapore Government is, in fact, the\r\n\r\nemployer. Sir, no employer in Singapore arrogates to\r\n\r\nhimself the right to appoint a negotiating Committee\r\n\r\non  behalf of its employees. This is a farce and  no\r\n\r\ntrade unionist worth his salt will ever accept  such\r\n\r\na   position.  Needless  to  say,  Mr  Speaker,  if\r\n\r\ntomorrow every employer follows the example  set  by\r\n\r\nthe Government, which claims to be pro-labour, which\r\n\r\nclaims  to  be  a  model employer,  and  insists  on\r\n\r\nunilaterally setting up a Committee on behalf of its\r\n\r\nemployees,  then there will be chaos and unrest  all\r\n\r\nround.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Union took a strike decision to get the\r\n\r\ndemands met, and the demands were very simple.  One,\r\n\r\nrecognition  of  the  Executive  Committee.  It  was\r\n\r\npertinent at that moment to have this matter  fought\r\n\r\nout,  because if the Union had kept quiet, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  would  have proceeded to appoint  his  own\r\n\r\nCommittee.  Sir,  we  know what happened  after  the\r\n\r\nworkers  took a strike decision. The Prime  Minister\r\n\r\ngot  panicky. The Government got panicky. The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  who  since  1959  had  not  gone  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board Staff Association to see the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board  workers, who had  not  gone  to  the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board  to  see  the workers,  went  to  the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board this time. We saw grand  pictures  in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers  of  workers  shouting  pro-Malaysia\r\n\r\nslogans  and greeting the Prime Minister. Sir,  here\r\n\r\nagain  I would like to take just one moment  to  say\r\n\r\nhow   the  facts  were  distorted.  There   was   no\r\n\r\njustification   for   the   Government   to   refuse\r\n\r\nrecognition   if   the  Union  and   its   Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee.  They knew that when the workers  took  a\r\n\r\nstrike  decision, they were caught out publicly.  To\r\n\r\novercome  this,  the Prime Minister  instructed  the\r\n\r\nHarbour Board\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  get  all the workers together for a meeting.  He\r\n\r\ndecided  to  go  direct  to the  members  to  get  a\r\n\r\ndecision  from them. We know that the Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nhad  a  lot of gates. All the gates were locked  up.\r\n\r\nRiot  squads and police personnel stood  by  at  the\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  Police  Station;  plainclothes   men\r\n\r\nfilled  the  Harbour Board area, and  Harbour  Board\r\n\r\npersonnel  were  used to go around  to  force  every\r\n\r\nworker to attend this meeting. The instructions were\r\n\r\nvery  simple. \"These are working hours. You  are  an\r\n\r\nemployee of the Harbour Board. The orders are,  `You\r\n\r\nattend  this  meeting. If you  do  not  attend  this\r\n\r\nmeeting,   you   will  be  subject  to  disciplinary\r\n\r\naction.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this meeting the Prime Minister announced that\r\n\r\nhe  would make this award of a Malaysia bonus.  Sir,\r\n\r\nin   the   first   place,  his  conduct   was   very\r\n\r\nunprincipled,  because  he had  no  business  to  go\r\n\r\ndirect to the workers on an industrial matter that a\r\n\r\ntrade  union was representing. In the second  place,\r\n\r\nthe  State  power was used to intimidate and  coerce\r\n\r\nthe  workers  and to get them to see  his  point  of\r\n\r\nview.  There was no fair play. It was all  described\r\n\r\nas  a big victory for the Prime Minister. But he had\r\n\r\nno  courage to allow Union officials to address  the\r\n\r\nmeeting. The whole exercise carried out by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister was to prevent a strike, because if it  had\r\n\r\ntaken  place,  the misdeeds of the Government  would\r\n\r\nhave  come to public attention. To prevent a strike,\r\n\r\nhe,  together with responsible people like  Hon  Sui\r\n\r\nSen,  Chairman  of  the  Harbour  Board,  and  other\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board  officials,  indulged  in  completely\r\n\r\nunethical  and unprincipled conduct. Even  at  these\r\n\r\ntwo  meetings  with  the Harbour Board  workers,  we\r\n\r\nfound  that  they  were determined to  proceed  with\r\n\r\ntheir  fight  to  gain recognition; and  to  prevent\r\n\r\nthis,   Sir,   with  a  stroke  of  the   pen,   the\r\n\r\nregistration of the Harbour Board Staff  Association\r\n\r\nwas cancelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a pity that the Prime Minister is not\r\n\r\nhere.  Since  he  believes  in  open  confrontation,\r\n\r\nperhaps this would be an appropriate moment to  hear\r\n\r\nwhat  he  has to say. But I say that in the  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  dispute it was not the Union which was  being\r\n\r\npolitical but the Government. The Harbour Board even\r\n\r\ntoday, Sir, is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfaced  with  an  explosive  situation,  because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wants to play politics with  unions  and\r\n\r\nworkers.  The  fact  that the  Harbour  Board  Staff\r\n\r\nAssociation   registration  is   cancelled   by   an\r\n\r\narbitrary  decision  of  the  Government  does   not\r\n\r\nresolve the dispute in the Harbour Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has set up a Committee of six people to try and look after the affairs of the workers. In the first place, Mr Speaker, he has no right whatsoever to appoint such a Committee. In the second place, the appointment of this Committee does not solve the problem. Sir, if a strike takes place,\r\n\r\neither  today, tomorrow, or one week or  two  months\r\n\r\nfrom  now,  it  is not because there are  Communists\r\n\r\ntrying  to  create industrial unrest. Sir,  for  ten\r\n\r\nyears  now  the  Harbour  Board  workers  have  been\r\n\r\npatient.  They were patient when their leaders  were\r\n\r\narrested.  They were patient when their claims  were\r\n\r\nreferred arbitrarily to the Arbitration Court.  They\r\n\r\nwere  patient when their premises were seized.  They\r\n\r\nwere  patient  when  $120,000  of  their  funds  was\r\n\r\nfrozen.  But  they could not be patient  any  longer\r\n\r\nwhen  the Government proposed to set up a Committee,\r\n\r\na  P.A.P. Committee, to represent them in industrial\r\n\r\nrelations.  The fact that today the Government  have\r\n\r\ncancelled  the  registration of  the  Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nStaff  Association only increases the  problem.  The\r\n\r\nstruggle of the Harbour Board workers continues, and\r\n\r\nI  have no doubt, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the victory\r\n\r\nwill  be that of the Harbour Board Staff Association\r\n\r\nmembers, and Harbour Board workers as a whole. It is\r\n\r\nnot   going  to  be  a  personal  victory  for   any\r\n\r\nindividual,  be  it  the Prime Minister  or  anybody\r\n\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Harbour Board issue is a very clear\r\n\r\nexample  of  the extent to which the  Government  is\r\n\r\nprepared  to use State power for its party political\r\n\r\ninterest. Sir, in the past, we have quoted  numerous\r\n\r\nsmall  examples of C. K. Tang, Tiger Breweries,  and\r\n\r\nthe Steam Laundries and so on. I do not think I have\r\n\r\nto repeat all this at this moment. There is no doubt\r\n\r\nin  the minds of the officials of all unions of  the\r\n\r\nintention  of the Government. All trade unions,  all\r\n\r\nemployers  and many people who are one  way  or  the\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconnected   with  industrial  problems,   industrial\r\n\r\nrelations,  know full well that today the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment's abuse of State power for its  political\r\n\r\npurposes  in the trade union field is unprecedented.\r\n\r\nOn  the  one hand, attempts are made to disrupt  the\r\n\r\nunions which are non-P.A.P., to discriminate against\r\n\r\nthem,  to deny them of their fundamental rights  and\r\n\r\nprivileges. On the other hand, State power  is  used\r\n\r\nto  foster  the  growth of the N.T.U.C.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\noutfit  is led by renegades and discredited  leaders\r\n\r\nin  the  trade union field. Sir, today, the N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nis  a  big racket. It is supposed to be the P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nvehicle for working class support, and it is used to\r\n\r\nmake  P.A.P. propaganda to gather support  for  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. amongst the workers. Sir, I have had occasion\r\n\r\nin  the  past to say in this House how public  funds\r\n\r\nhave  been  used  to assist in the running  of  this\r\n\r\norganisation,  the  Labour Research  Unit,  $300,000\r\n\r\nannually  to pay salaries to P.A.P. trade unionists;\r\n\r\nhow  the Labour Ministry is being used to pressurise\r\n\r\nemployers into meeting the excessive demands made by\r\n\r\nthis   organisation;   how   the   office   of   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for  Labour is  being  used  to  order\r\n\r\nsecret  ballots, to withhold secret ballots  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess of determining union representation, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to quote from a letter that\r\n\r\nappeared  in  the Malayan Times.

With   your\r\n\r\npermission,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to  read  this\r\n\r\npart  because it gives a clear picture of what  sort\r\n\r\nof racket exists in the N.T.U.C.:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`One of the biggest unions affiliated to the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. is AUPE whose leader is Mr G.  Kandasamy.\r\n\r\nHe has been at loggerheads with Mr Devan Nair since\r\n\r\nthe very inception of the N.T.U.C. This resulted  in\r\n\r\nthe  division  of  the N.T.U.C. into  two  factions.\r\n\r\nOverseas scholarships came in as a handy instrument,\r\n\r\nwhich  the  two  groups  used to  attract  promising\r\n\r\nunionists  who,  in turn, would help  to  outdo  the\r\n\r\nother group in their empire building.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Incidentally, Mr Speaker, this article is  entitled\r\n\r\n\"Empire Building\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A few months ago when Mr Kandasamy was able to\r\n\r\nsecure  a studs course to Israel, sponsored  by  the\r\n\r\nICFTU,  he handpicked his adherents from the various\r\n\r\nunions  without reference either to the N.T.U.C. or\r\n\r\nto the unions concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the majority group in the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. pampers  one  or  two  unions  on   whose\r\n\r\npotentialities they have great hopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, let us take the United Workers of\r\n\r\nPetroleum Industry which represents the employees in\r\n\r\noil  companies. All the good scholarships,  such  as\r\n\r\nstudy  trips  to  Canada, America,  United  Kingdom,\r\n\r\nGermany,  and  Switzerland are  reserved  for  these\r\n\r\npampered chaps. Last year one member from this union\r\n\r\nwent  on a Canadian and Continental trip. This  year\r\n\r\nanother  member,  Mr  Aziz Karim,  has  gone  on  a\r\n\r\nsimilar trip abroad. A third one will soon be  going\r\n\r\nto Japan and Vienna.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In fact, they have since left, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Members of this union occupy positions in the\r\n\r\nAdult  Education  Board and Central  Provident  Fund\r\n\r\nBoard. These blue-eyed boys are given pride of place\r\n\r\nin all public functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the affiliated unions of the N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nstrained  their very nerve to make this  year's  May\r\n\r\nDay  celebrations a success [which, Sir, was  not  a\r\n\r\nsuccess because they had an attendance of only about\r\n\r\n3,000],  not  even  the  members  of  the  executive\r\n\r\ncommittee attended the rally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, Mr Aziz, Karim, an official of the\r\n\r\nUnited  Workers  of  Petroleum  Industry,  who   was\r\n\r\nnominated  by  the N.T.U.C. to work  in  the  Labour\r\n\r\nResearch  Unit,  had not even shown his  face  there\r\n\r\nthroughout  the last seven months under the  pretext\r\n\r\nof  ill-health. It must be noted here that all those\r\n\r\nunionists,  who are seconded to the Labour  Research\r\n\r\nUnit,  are paid by the Unit which receives an annual\r\n\r\ngrant of $300,000. For his seven months' absence Mr\r\n\r\nAziz  Karim  has received a grand sum of $3,000  [an\r\n\r\naverage  of  about $400 a month, Mr  Speaker]  - the\r\n\r\nhard-earned taxpayers' money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the Director of the Labour Research Unit,\r\n\r\nnor  the  Chairman  of  the N.T.U.C.,  who  is  also\r\n\r\nseconded  to  the  above unit,  despite  their  full\r\n\r\nknowledge of this, took any action against Mr  Aziz\r\n\r\nKarim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man, who was so indisposed that he absented\r\n\r\nhimself  for  seven months from his place  of  work,\r\n\r\nwoke  up  one  fine Monday morning (July  15,  1963)\r\n\r\nfound  himself hale and healthy, produced his health\r\n\r\ncertificates at the Singapore Airport, and  flew  to\r\n\r\nCanada,  leaving a group of unionists stricken  with\r\n\r\nbewilderment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means, in addition to his seven months'\r\n\r\nabsence with pay, he will enjoy another four  months\r\n\r\nwith  pay  in  Canada and in the Continent.

If the\r\n\r\nMember  is quite interested, he can take the Malayan\r\n\r\nTimes  and read it in full - five times over in  this\r\n\r\nHouse - and I will have no objection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point here is to stress the fact that today the\r\n\r\nGovernment  uses State machinery for  its  own  use,\r\n\r\nState  funds for its own purpose, and forces  a  few\r\n\r\ncivil servants to carry out work for the advancement\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P.'s political interests. Sir, this  is\r\n\r\nonly  one side of it. On the other side, I hear that\r\n\r\nall is not well even in their unions. I hear that in\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Manual and Mercantile Workers  Union,\r\n\r\n$12,000 is missing, and Mr T. V. Gomez has taken  a\r\n\r\nholiday. I do not know what the Government has  done\r\n\r\nabout  this. In the Federation of Public Daily-Rated\r\n\r\nEmployees  Union, $2,000 is missing.  A  report  was\r\n\r\nmade  in  the  Kandang  Kerbau Police  Station,  but\r\n\r\nnothing  was  done.  On the other hand,  practically\r\n\r\nevery day every union in the S.A.T.U. group is being\r\n\r\npersecuted  by  the  Registrar of  Trade  Unions  on\r\n\r\ninstructions from the Government. The  mess  in  the\r\n\r\nManual and Mercantile Workers Union is known to  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  If  the  Government have  any  decency,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve they will make a categorical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatement  either confirming it or  denying  it.  If\r\n\r\nthey  have courage, I say hold a public inquiry  and\r\n\r\nget  the  Rediffusion workers to testify as  to  the\r\n\r\ntruth or otherwise of what I have said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the N.T.U.C. today is given full blessing and\r\n\r\nofficial recognition, whereas S.A.T.U. is denied the\r\n\r\nright to hold any activity. The application for  the\r\n\r\nregistration of S.A.T.U. was made in August 1961. It\r\n\r\nwas  the  first application following the resolution\r\n\r\nof  the  Trades  Union  Congress.  Up  to  date  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of Trade Unions has not even the  decency\r\n\r\nto   communicate  with  us.  In  order  to  give  an\r\n\r\nappearance  of impartiality, I hear the N.T.U.C. is\r\n\r\nnot  officially  registered  but  it  can  hold  its\r\n\r\nconference.  The  S.A.T.U. annual  conference   was\r\n\r\nbanned.  The Internal Security Council was  made  to\r\n\r\ntake the responsibility for the ban. We asked for  a\r\n\r\npolice  permit  to hold a rally, but  there  was  no\r\n\r\npolice  permit. Sir, the fact that the N.T.U.C. may\r\n\r\nnot  be legally registered does not mean that it  is\r\n\r\nsubjected to the same treatment that is given to the\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. It is only for purposes of convenience  and\r\n\r\nto  give  the  impression of impartiality  that  the\r\n\r\nregistration  has not been given. But  otherwise  it\r\n\r\nhas the official backing of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the trade union movement in Singapore today\r\n\r\nis  no  doubt  divided.  But this  division  is  not\r\n\r\nsomething  new to Singapore. In one way  or  another\r\n\r\nthis division has always existed because there is  a\r\n\r\nminority  of  working  people who  are  servile  and\r\n\r\nbackward  in their thinking and are fearful  of  the\r\n\r\nauthority of the day. Hence, this minority group has\r\n\r\nfrom time to time lent its support to the government\r\n\r\nof  the  day  and has become a tool  of  the  ruling\r\n\r\ncircles. During the years preceding 1959 when  there\r\n\r\nwas   an  upsurge  of  trade  union  activity,  this\r\n\r\nminority   section  of  the  trade  union   movement\r\n\r\npersistently played its role of reaction.  Now  this\r\n\r\ngroup  once again indulges in reaction and stirs  up\r\n\r\ndifferences amongst the workers with the aid of  the\r\n\r\nState power and a handful of renegade leaders.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  only  difference is that it is now  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment and renegades like Devan Nair and  T.  V.\r\n\r\nGomez instead of it being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   previous   Government   and   renegades   like\r\n\r\nJaganathan, Lee Chwee Lim and Ang Leong Seng.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. came to power in 1959 with the support\r\n\r\nof  the progressive trade union movement. One of the\r\n\r\nmajor  election pledges was to unify the trade union\r\n\r\nmovement.  As  was  pledged, a unified  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement  was  recognised  as  a  pre-condition  for\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace with justice. Today the Government\r\n\r\nhave completely forgotten their pledge, and, besides\r\n\r\nnot  doing  anything  to unify  the  movement,  have\r\n\r\nperpetuated and deepened the division by  their  use\r\n\r\nof  State machinery. Sir, the trade unions that  are\r\n\r\ntoday  accused of being Communist-led had more  than\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  in  the past of their  willingness  to\r\n\r\nwork with the new Government after the elections  in\r\n\r\norder  to  bring about a unified strong trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement which, as I have said, would be a necessary\r\n\r\npre-requisite for industrial peace. However, it  was\r\n\r\nGovernment's fear born out of political  opportunism\r\n\r\nthat  prevented the unification of the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement.   It  was  the  Government's  failure   to\r\n\r\nmanipulate and control the T.U.C. in 1961  to  serve\r\n\r\nits  own purpose that led to the open breach in  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C.  Instead of letting the unions  decide  their\r\n\r\nfuture, the Government announced the dissolution  of\r\n\r\nthe  T.U.C. with the shameless connivance  of  their\r\n\r\nhenchmen in the T.U.C. Secretariat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ever since 1961, the Government have been\r\n\r\ngiving  official blessing and active support to  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. and disrupting and discriminating  against\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U.  Sir,  we  find it necessary  to  warn  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the consequences of their actions,  of\r\n\r\nthe  consequences of their labour  policy  based  on\r\n\r\npolitical   bias  and  discrimination  against   the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  trade unions and trade union  members.\r\n\r\nThe  Government alone are solely responsible for any\r\n\r\nuneasiness  and  tension in  the  industrial  field.\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. is  the main stream of the  working  class\r\n\r\nmovement  in  Singapore. The Government attitude  to\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U.,  in  effect,  means denying  S.A.T.U. its\r\n\r\nrightful place in the country. Sir, S.A.T.U.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot be crippled and choked out of existence.  Any\r\n\r\nattempt   to   do   so  would  only  mean   inviting\r\n\r\nretaliation by the majority of the workers. Sir, the\r\n\r\nGovernment would do well to take stock of things and\r\n\r\naccord S.A.T.U. its rightful place. S.A.T.U. must be\r\n\r\nregistered  forthwith  and S.A.T.U. unions'  rights\r\n\r\nrecognised and respected by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Kandasamy (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, the Member for Thomson seems rather to be under\r\n\r\nan  illusion that any union which is not within  the\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. organisation  is   automatically   P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncontrolled. He has been in the trade union  movement\r\n\r\nfor  some  time  and I am sure he  understands  that\r\n\r\nthere are about 128 unions in Singapore of which  34\r\n\r\nunions  or  so  are in S.A.T.U. Therefore,  for  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson to come and  say  that  90  odd\r\n\r\nunions  in  Singapore are under the control  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. or that the P.A.P. controls 94 unions,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  he is doing himself or the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement any good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by such an appraisal, he is tacitly admitting\r\n\r\nthat   the  34  unions  who  are  in  S.A.T.U. are\r\n\r\ncontrolled and dominated by the Barisan Sosialis.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Member for Thomson who moved this  motion\r\n\r\nin  April  had  slightly different ideas.  Indeed  I\r\n\r\nwould  have  thought  the  speech  would  have  been\r\n\r\ndifferent,  had he delivered it in April,  from  the\r\n\r\nspeech that we heard yesterday and this afternoon. I\r\n\r\ncan  sympathise with the difficulties in  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion movement in the industrial field. The pace  is\r\n\r\nfast  and  from April to now, several  changes  have\r\n\r\ntaken  place  that perhaps the Member  for  Thomson,\r\n\r\nbusy  as he is in preparing black banners, or rather\r\n\r\ngiving  advice  as to how to prepare black  banners,\r\n\r\nhas  not had much time to concentrate on the  motion\r\n\r\nthat he moved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent to the motion being placed on the Order\r\n\r\nPaper,  the  S.A.T.U. group of unions  have  adopted\r\n\r\nanother definition of what \"P.A.P. union\" means. It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  quite  open  in  Singapore in  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement that the S.A.T.U. group of unions have said\r\n\r\nthose unions whose leaders were honoured in June  by\r\n\r\nawards  - I  have forgotten the names of  the  medals - that  were  given  for public service,  hence  only\r\n\r\nthose unions were P.A.P. controlled and unions whose\r\n\r\nleaders were not honoured in such a manner were  not\r\n\r\nP.A.P. controlled. Sir, it seems today  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson has gone off the track again from  what\r\n\r\nthe  S.A.T.U. leadership have said. Because  if  the\r\n\r\nunions  whose  leaders won awards in June  were  the\r\n\r\nonly  unions controlled by the P.A.P., then a  close\r\n\r\nexamination will show that there are only six unions\r\n\r\nwhose leaders have been so honoured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Member for Thomson would have\r\n\r\ndone  the House a favour if he had defined  what  he\r\n\r\nmeant by \"non-P.A.P. trade unions\" -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It includes yours.

He  said  that the  balloting  that  was\r\n\r\nconducted  by the Ministry of Labour on the  dispute\r\n\r\ninvolving  nurses  was stopped  by  the  Amalgamated\r\n\r\nUnion  of  Public  Employees. Very  subtly  he  said\r\n\r\nperhaps  that was because there were P.A.P. members\r\n\r\nin the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees. Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to explain this. The Member for  Thomson\r\n\r\nshould  have spent more time reading the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Ordinance and other Ordinances, and if he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad,  he  would have found a means of  avoiding  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty  he  found himself in  in  the  Breweries\r\n\r\ncase.  Sir,  when  the dispute  was  directed  under\r\n\r\nsection  28  (b)   to  arbitration,  from  that  time\r\n\r\nonwards,  from the moment the Gazette was issued  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the Industrial Relations Ordinance,\r\n\r\nthe  dispute  comes within the jurisdiction  of  the\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court  and  any  action  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nemployer or the Ministry of Labour before the  issue\r\n\r\nof  the  Gazette is usually null and void.  Sir,  as\r\n\r\nsoon  as  the Amalgamated Union of Public  Employees\r\n\r\ncame  to understand that the Ministry of Labour were\r\n\r\ngoing to count and declare the ballot which they had\r\n\r\nconducted, they promptly reported the matter to  the\r\n\r\nPresident of the Industrial Arbitration Court.  They\r\n\r\ninformed  him that if the ballot boxes were  opened,\r\n\r\ncounted  and declared, that would be prejudicial  to\r\n\r\nthe  case  before  the Court. The  Court,  being  an\r\n\r\nindependent  body  as  it is, promptly  ordered  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour not to open the boxes,  not  to\r\n\r\ncount  the  ballot and not to declare. I think  even\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Labour were caught  by  surprise,\r\n\r\nbecause  when the moment arrived for the opening  of\r\n\r\nthe  ballot boxes, newspaper reporters photographers\r\n\r\nand  various other functionaries were there, and  it\r\n\r\nwas  only at the last moment that the Court's  order\r\n\r\nwas  conveyed and obeyed. If the Member for  Thomson\r\n\r\nhad  done  some reading of the Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance and had done a little bit of research into\r\n\r\nthe precedents set up by the Australian Courts, I am\r\n\r\nsure he would have saved a lot of time in his speech\r\n\r\nabout the Harbour Board workers and Brewery workers.\r\n\r\nHe  would  have  found that in Singapore  there  are\r\n\r\nenough laws, enough avenues, to seek redress of  the\r\n\r\nmatters that he had raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the T.U.C. was mentioned by the Member for\r\n\r\nThomson. Sir, in the case of the Sassoon workers, he\r\n\r\nforgot  to  mention that the P.A.P. and the  present\r\n\r\nnon-P.A.P.,  including him, when  we  heard  of  the\r\n\r\narrest  of  the  workers who were  involved  in  the\r\n\r\nSassoon strike, promptly went to the Central  Police\r\n\r\nStation and not only publicly protested\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut we also had a meeting with the then Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next instance was the deregistration of the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Transport  Unions.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson  was  one of the Secretaries of  the  T.U.C.\r\n\r\nthen,  and  when the deregistration took  place,  an\r\n\r\nexplanation was given and there was no protest.  Now\r\n\r\nfor  him  to  come out at this late hour and  accuse\r\n\r\nothers  in the T.U.C., I think, is not doing justice\r\n\r\nto  his  former  colleagues;  neither  is  he  doing\r\n\r\njustice  to  himself because he was, until  1961,  a\r\n\r\nmember  of the Secretariat. The trade union movement\r\n\r\ncannot  be  united by legislation.  No  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement   in   the  world  has   been   united   by\r\n\r\nlegislation.  Legislation has  been  of  assistance.\r\n\r\nLegislation sometimes has been a hindrance. But  for\r\n\r\nthe  trade  union movement to unite, such unity  can\r\n\r\nonly come from the workers and nobody else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson touched upon the Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  workers. I have some experience dealing  with\r\n\r\nthe  Harbour Board workers, not since 1959, if I may\r\n\r\nsay   so,  Sir.  My  experience  goes  before  that.\r\n\r\nStrangely  enough, Sir, with regard to  the  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard workers, the disputes since 1955 have involved\r\n\r\ntwo   ex-Chief  Ministers  and  the  present   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  As  far  as I know, the  trouble  of  the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board workers arises from two factors.  One\r\n\r\nfactor  is  that the Committee of the Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nworkers from 1955 to 1962 have never prepared  their\r\n\r\ncases  for  the workers or created an administrative\r\n\r\nmachinery,  an organisation, to look after  all  the\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the Harbour Board. Unfortunately,  Sir,\r\n\r\nsome  of the leaders  - I will not say all  - have  been\r\n\r\nmore interested in the political aspect than in  the\r\n\r\nindustrial aspect. Had the Committee concentrated on\r\n\r\nthe  industrial aspect from 1955, I do not think  we\r\n\r\nwould  have  reached the position  today  where  the\r\n\r\nworkers are now finding themselves without a  union,\r\n\r\nvery  confused  as  to what is to  be  done  in  the\r\n\r\npresent  situation. Their claims have been  directed\r\n\r\nto the Arbitration Court. They have received a bonus\r\n\r\nat the same time. And\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility for all this rests  squarely  on\r\n\r\nsome  of the leaders of the union. Surely the Member\r\n\r\nfor   Thomson  realises  it.  The  former   General-Secretary was a colleague of both of us.  He  was  a\r\n\r\ngood  friend, I think, of the former Chief Minister,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Cairnhill, with whom he had certain\r\n\r\ndifficulties  at  certain times. He  was  also  well\r\n\r\nknown to the previous Chief Minister, the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  at the moment. If the Member for Thomson  had\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  advise as early as  1959,  then  the\r\n\r\nGeneral-Secretary and the Committee should have gone\r\n\r\nto  work  on  organisation and administration,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhatever  has happened to Mr Jamit Singh,  I  think\r\n\r\nthe organisation would have been there looking after\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the workers, and any  negotiations\r\n\r\nwould   have   been   conducted  by   the   workers'\r\n\r\nrepresentatives,  by  the  workers  of  the  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard, and not by people who have nothing whatsoever\r\n\r\nto  do  with the Harbour Board. If we are to  assist\r\n\r\nthe  Harbour Board workers, may I advise the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson  that the best that can happen  is  for\r\n\r\npersons  who  are  not connected directly  with  the\r\n\r\nHarbour Board to leave the Harbour Board workers  to\r\n\r\nresolve  their own difficulties, to elect their  own\r\n\r\nrepresentatives, and to conduct the affairs  of  the\r\n\r\nunion  by leadership elected from the rank and  file\r\n\r\nof   the   port  workers  without  any  interference\r\n\r\nwhatsoever from outsiders'? Sir, I do not  say  this\r\n\r\nbecause  I am not in any way involved or interested,\r\n\r\nwhile the Member for Thomson is directly, I believe,\r\n\r\nits  adviser, but I think he would be doing a  great\r\n\r\nservice  to the port workers to advise them to  look\r\n\r\nafter  their  own  affairs  without  any  advice  or\r\n\r\ninterference from outside; whether it is the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson or whether it is the N.T.U.C. I  should\r\n\r\nthink  that both of them should keep away  from  the\r\n\r\nport workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees has\r\n\r\nserious   difficulties  with  its   employers,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   of   Singapore.  It   also   has   some\r\n\r\ndifficulties with the N.T.U.C. But that is no excuse\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  for the Member for Thomson to  say  that\r\n\r\nthere is a Kandasamy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfaction in the N.T.U.C. For his information, I might\r\n\r\nas  well say this - when the N.T.U.C. was formed,  it\r\n\r\nwas  I  who  proposed that Mr  Devan  Nair  be  its\r\n\r\nGeneral  Secretary;  and  I  declined  the  post  of\r\n\r\nGeneral  Secretary. I can assure the  House  that  I\r\n\r\nhave   no  intention  whatsoever  of  standing   for\r\n\r\nelection   to  any  office  in  the  N.T.U.C.,   and\r\n\r\ntherefore  there  is  no need for  me  to  create  a\r\n\r\nKandasamy  faction. The Kandasamy faction  that  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson has said is his own imagination\r\n\r\nand not a reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding scholarships, I do not have any\r\n\r\nauthority  or  the  power to award  scholarships  to\r\n\r\nanyone,  whether  it be the Israel scholarship  that\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Thomson  mentioned  or  any  other\r\n\r\nscholarship.   Scholarships  are  offered   to   the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour. The normal procedure, I believe,\r\n\r\nlies  with the N.T.U.C. And between them they select\r\n\r\nthe  participants for the courses. I do not have  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to offer scholarships, but as  a  member\r\n\r\nof  the N.T.U.C., I may propose certain persons  who\r\n\r\nmay  have  the support of the N.T.U.C. and  thus  be\r\n\r\nawarded  scholarships. But that does not in any  way\r\n\r\nsubstantiate the accusation made by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson that the Kandasamy faction, in trying to win\r\n\r\nmembers over, is offering scholarships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would say to the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- since he has found himself to be in a difficult\r\n\r\nsituation in regard to the brewery workers  and  the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board  - perhaps if he had done his  homework\r\n\r\nbetter  and  had  spent more  time  reading  up  the\r\n\r\nOrdinances,  the possibilities that are  there,  and\r\n\r\nhad spent less time with black banners, I am sure he\r\n\r\nwould  have found solutions to his problems  and  he\r\n\r\nwould have done better for the workers of Singapore,\r\n\r\ninstead of having to make his very lengthy speech on\r\n\r\nthe Harbour Board workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nas the Member for Thomson has touched on the workers\r\n\r\nof  the  Harbour  Board, I feel it  is  my  duty  to\r\n\r\nclarify certain points which I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbelieve  he  has  been  wrongly  informed  about  by\r\n\r\ncertain employees in the Harbour Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech he mentioned about the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Court of Inquiry appointed by\r\n\r\nthe previous Government. The previous Government did\r\n\r\nnot try to implement the recommendations up to 1959,\r\n\r\nand  after  1959 the present Government  implemented\r\n\r\nthe    main    or   important   aspects    of    the\r\n\r\nrecommendations. In fact, in 1961 Mr Jamit Singh, I\r\n\r\nand  Mr Latiff signed an agreement on behalf of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Harbour  Board  Staff  Association  which\r\n\r\nstated  quite clearly that all major recommendations\r\n\r\nof  the  Court  of Inquiry had been  completely  and\r\n\r\nfully  implemented to the satisfaction  of  all  the\r\n\r\nworkers concerned; except for one item which at that\r\n\r\ntime - and   even  Mr  Jamit  Singh  and  the   whole\r\n\r\nCommittee agreed on this  - was practically impossible\r\n\r\nto  implement because of the nature of the  work  of\r\n\r\nthe Harbour Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on this particular operation - from December 1959 right up to May 1961 - the Harbour Board and the Union sat together. We discussed all the problems and did our best. Even though we differed politically with Mr Jamit Singh, who was a good friend of mine, we did this to the\r\n\r\nbest  of our ability and to the satisfaction of  all\r\n\r\nthe  Harbour  Board workers concerned. That  is  the\r\n\r\nfirst  point I want to clarify and that  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Thomson has got the wrong information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is the victimisation of the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board workers. He said that this  has  been\r\n\r\ngoing  on since 1955, i.e., about eight to ten years\r\n\r\nfrom the time of the previous Government. He is  now\r\n\r\naccusing  that this is going on in the time  of  the\r\n\r\npresent Government. On this matter of victimisation,\r\n\r\nI  would  say that as one who worked in the  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard and as one who is closely associated with  its\r\n\r\nUnion, I cannot find any reason to put the blame  on\r\n\r\nthe  present  Government. The  whole  setup  of  the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board  is  such that  any  officer  of  the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board, if he wants to play dirty, can  play\r\n\r\ndirty,  so  that the reflection falls on Government.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see it now, this victimisation is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot primarily or mainly directed towards the present\r\n\r\nnew  Committee or because the workers are supporting\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis or S.A.T.U. I do not think that\r\n\r\nis the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that the Member for Thomson has\r\n\r\nmentioned  is the election of the new Committee  and\r\n\r\nthe  legality  of this Committee. He  has  suggested\r\n\r\nthat  there are virtually two Committees.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\none  problem  which we were faced with  in  1955  is\r\n\r\nthis.  In  the period from 1955 to 1959  there  were\r\n\r\nunions in the Singapore Harbour Board having trouble\r\n\r\nwith  one another. The problems of the Harbour Board\r\n\r\nworkers had accumulated since 1955. All the time  we\r\n\r\nwere  asking  for one single union for  the  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  workers. After a critical strife,  we  formed\r\n\r\none  union but the Board refused to recognise  this.\r\n\r\nThere  were yellow unions then. So the problems  had\r\n\r\naccumulated  up  to  1959. The reason  why  the  new\r\n\r\nelection   of   Executive  Committee   members,   as\r\n\r\nsuggested by the Member for Thomson, is illegal,  or\r\n\r\nseems to be illegal because an employee of the Board\r\n\r\nhas  taken  a  case in the High Court.  Before  this\r\n\r\nparticular  election  of  the  Executive   Committee\r\n\r\nmembers, all sectional representatives met Mr Jamit\r\n\r\nSingh   - at that time the Member for Thomson was  not\r\n\r\nan  adviser to the union  - and also all employees  of\r\n\r\nthe  Harbour Board met Mr Jamit Singh and requested\r\n\r\nhim  that  elections should be held. He refused.  He\r\n\r\nsaid.  \"According to the constitution of the Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  Staff Association, you cannot hold  elections\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Association  cannot  represent  10,000\r\n\r\nworkers.\" And he was correct. I also said this.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  happened was that they suddenly conducted  the\r\n\r\nelections ultra vires the constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I understood from the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson that that matter is sub judice. It  has\r\n\r\nbeen referred to the Court. If that is so, then,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, it cannot be mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> I am just mentioning it in passing and\r\n\r\nI will not be going into details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague, the Member for Kampong Kapor, has\r\n\r\nstated, the position of the Singapore Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nworkers  is a very difficult one. They were made  to\r\n\r\nsuffer  for  the last eight years because  of  their\r\n\r\nactive  participation in politics. I am in  complete\r\n\r\nagreement  with  my  colleague  that  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board workers should be given a  chance  to\r\n\r\nelect their own representatives who are employed  in\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  Harbour  Board  itself.  After  the\r\n\r\nelection  of their Committee, let them he given  the\r\n\r\nauthority to run a union democratically in their own\r\n\r\ninterest.  If  there is no outside  interference,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Singapore Harbour Board workers are quite\r\n\r\ncapable of electing their own leaders. I think there\r\n\r\nare  quite  a number of good chaps who can  run  the\r\n\r\nunion  quite efficiently for the betterment  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, as the Member for Thomson has\r\n\r\nsuggested, is that the Prime Minister went there and\r\n\r\nthat  ten  gates were closed. The Singapore  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  employees  are from Gate  1,  that  is,  East\r\n\r\nReclamation Road to the Pasir Panjang Power  Station\r\n\r\nand partly the Singapore Slipway at Tanjong Rhu. Can\r\n\r\nwe believe that 10,000 employees scattered over four\r\n\r\nmiles can all be locked up within 10 or 12 gates? If\r\n\r\nthey  refuse  to  go  to  a meeting  called  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board or on the instruction of the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister, there the problem ends. Nobody  can\r\n\r\nforce  the  10,000  employees from Tanjong  Berlayer\r\n\r\nright up to Tanjong Rhu to go to a meeting. So, this\r\n\r\nexactly  shows  that the workers  in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour Board have come to a position where they are\r\n\r\nfed  up with all these things and they are too eager\r\n\r\nfor  somebody to tackle their problems. They are too\r\n\r\neager  to get something, because for the last  eight\r\n\r\nyears  they  have never received any rate  increases\r\n\r\nand  there  has  been  no change  in  their  working\r\n\r\nconditions. Therefore in that sense, they thought it\r\n\r\nbest  to  go  to  the meeting called  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister. They went there to listen to him  and  the\r\n\r\nPresident of the Union was given a chance to  be  on\r\n\r\nthe platform; for that matter, everybody was given a\r\n\r\nchance to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  on  the  platform.  Instead  of  prolonging  the\r\n\r\nmatter,  let  the  workers of the Singapore  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  get something as an interim award. They  have\r\n\r\nbeen   given   a   chance   to   elect   their   own\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  to run their union.  I  think  once\r\n\r\nthey   elect  their  own  representatives  and   the\r\n\r\nExecutive  Committee, they should be left  alone  so\r\n\r\nthat they can look after their own interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No other Member wishing to speak?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this\r\n\r\nmotion  is  moved  not because there  is  cause  for\r\n\r\nconcern  that the fundamental rights of association,\r\n\r\nassembly  and publication of the workers  are  being\r\n\r\nignored  or disregarded by the Government as alleged\r\n\r\nin  the  motion. On the contrary, it is due  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  pro-labour  policy  that  revived  the\r\n\r\nworkers'  movement  immediately  after  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment  took  office.  This  has  led   to   the\r\n\r\nrestoration  of the workers' fundamental  rights  of\r\n\r\nassociation,  assembly  and publication  which  were\r\n\r\nsuppressed  by  the  Lim Yew  Hock  Government.  The\r\n\r\nemergence  of such a favourable situation  instilled\r\n\r\nstrong confidence among the workers, so much so that\r\n\r\nthey took full advantage of the situation created to\r\n\r\nreorganise and strengthen their unions. It is due to\r\n\r\nthis consolidation of the unions' position that  has\r\n\r\nenabled  the  workers to achieve  better  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, why do the Barisan move this motion? To them, the primary role and function of a trade union is to advance the aims and aspirations of particular political ideologies, parties or personalities. But as a result of the successful implementation of the Government's pro-labour\r\n\r\npolicy,  the pro-Communists in the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave  failed in their attempt to reduce trade unions\r\n\r\ninto  playthings of political forces out to  advance\r\n\r\ntheir   own  narrow  aims  and  ideologies.  It   is\r\n\r\ntherefore understandable that this motion is only an\r\n\r\nattempt  to  distort  the  facts  to  conceal  their\r\n\r\nmisdeeds that have caused so much loss and damage to\r\n\r\nthe workers in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has touched on the subject\r\n\r\nof  the  reunification of the trade union  movement.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, unification of the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement  is to consolidate the bargaining  position\r\n\r\nof  the  workers with their employers. This  is  the\r\n\r\nreal purpose for the move to reunify the trade union\r\n\r\nmovement.  Let us examine the development  of  trade\r\n\r\nunion  organisations during the days of the Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock  Government and the present Government.  During\r\n\r\nthe  period  January  1955 to May  1959,  while  the\r\n\r\nprevious   Government  was  in   office,   139   new\r\n\r\nemployees'  unions were registered. This  represents\r\n\r\nan  average  of  nearly three new unions  registered\r\n\r\nevery  month.  When  the present Government  assumed\r\n\r\noffice  in  June  1959, there was  a  total  of  226\r\n\r\nemployees'  unions with an aggregate  membership  of\r\n\r\n134,650. There are at the moment only 121 employees'\r\n\r\nunions with an aggregate membership of 189,221. This\r\n\r\nrepresents a net decrease of 105 unions  and  a  net\r\n\r\nincrease of union membership of nearly 55,000  since\r\n\r\nwe assumed office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above facts and figures in themselves\r\n\r\nconstitute  the  conclusive  evidence  of  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  done  to  achieve  the  object   of\r\n\r\nreunification of the trade union movement. The trade\r\n\r\nunion movement in Singapore is in fact forging ahead\r\n\r\nin spite of the hue and cry of the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\nThe  Government understands that it is not  so  much\r\n\r\nbecause  trade union movement in Singapore makes  no\r\n\r\nprogress  that  is lamentable, but rather  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis is deprived of the opportunity  to\r\n\r\ncontrol and make use of the trade union movement  in\r\n\r\nthe State as their open front political instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson has also accused the Government of having deviated from its pro-labour policy and that it is now no more a pro- labour Government. Let me quote the facts of what we have done in the past: to provide the necessary\r\n\r\nfacilities  and machinery to assist the  workers  to\r\n\r\nachieve  better terms and conditions of service,  to\r\n\r\nuphold  and  to  implement the policy of  industrial\r\n\r\npeace  with  justice, the Government has  taken  the\r\n\r\nnecessary steps to set up the requisite machinery\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  as the Industrial Arbitration Courts.  It  has\r\n\r\naugmented  the conciliation service and  the  Labour\r\n\r\nCourts  in  the Labour Ministry and  has  set  up  a\r\n\r\nLabour  Research  Unit. The  extent  and  amount  of\r\n\r\nbenefit the workers have derived from the pro-labour\r\n\r\npolicy   of   the   present  Government   has   been\r\n\r\nlaboriously  dealt with by the Minister  during  the\r\n\r\nBudget  sittings. There is no necessity  for  me  to\r\n\r\nrepeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the provision of such effective machinery and facilities for the workers to better their terms and conditions of service, the Member for Thomson accused the Labour Office of being discriminatory between the N.T.U.C. and S.A.T.U. unions. Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no truth\r\n\r\nin  it.  The  facilities of the Labour Ministry  are\r\n\r\nopen  to all unions, whether they belong to N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nor   S.A.T.U.  The  pro-Communist  leaders  of   the\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. unions, of course, do their best  to  keep\r\n\r\ntheir  members away from the conciliation facilities\r\n\r\noffered  by  the Ministry of Labour. But  even  when\r\n\r\nworkers belonging to the S.A.T.U. unions come to the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  they  are  treated  fairly  without   any\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  whatsoever.  This   is   basic   and\r\n\r\nfundamental to the policy of the Government. We  can\r\n\r\nassure  the workers belonging to the S.A.T.U. unions\r\n\r\nthat  while we will fight the pro-Communist  leaders\r\n\r\non every front, we shall be fair and just in all our\r\n\r\ndealings  with  workers who have the  misfortune  of\r\n\r\nbeing  under pro-Communist leadership, provided,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  that their grievances are genuine and  that\r\n\r\nthey press their claims within the framework of  the\r\n\r\nlaw.  I  say  genuine grievances  because  the  pro-Communist leaders of the Barisan are past masters in\r\n\r\nthe  art  of  manufacturing  grievances  where  none\r\n\r\nexists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson spoke on the registration\r\n\r\nof  S.A.T.U. Mr Speaker. Sir, you will recall  that\r\n\r\nafter  the  split in the leadership of the Singapore\r\n\r\nTrades  Union  Congress sometime in July  1961,  Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong,  Fong  Swee Suan, S.  Woodhull,  Jamit\r\n\r\nSingh,  Puthucheary and the Member for Thomson  came\r\n\r\nout and organised the Singapore Association of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrade  Unions. Now why did they come out to organise\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U.?  It is quite apparent that they know  that\r\n\r\nthey  must  exploit  trade  disputes  for  political\r\n\r\npurposes  instead  of maintaining  industrial  peace\r\n\r\nwith  justice  mainly to serve the interest  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers. I am sure the Member for Thomson will  give\r\n\r\nother reasons for the split. But for the record, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the primary cause of the split in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Trades Union Congress was the constant by-passing of the S.T.U.C. by these six members of  the\r\n\r\nSecretariat  and  their repeated  utilisation  of  a\r\n\r\ngroup  of  trade unions closely allied  to  them  to\r\n\r\nadvance  factional  political  aims  and  to   bring\r\n\r\npressure  on  and  to manipulate a properly  elected\r\n\r\nGovernment. After the split, these persons could  no\r\n\r\nlonger  carry  out  their  anti-national  activities\r\n\r\nwithin the framework of S.T.U.C. Therefore, they had\r\n\r\nto  look for a new setup so that they could continue\r\n\r\nto  manipulate  the  trade  union  movement  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  o, foreign anti-Malayan and anti-Malaysia\r\n\r\nforces. Hence the formation of S.A.T.U. Now what has\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. done  for  the  workers?  It  came   into\r\n\r\nexistence  on  16th August, 1961. The activities  of\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. since its inception, including  its  close\r\n\r\nadherence  to  the anti-Malaysia line of  a  foreign\r\n\r\npower  and voicing the new colonial charges  of  the\r\n\r\nP.K.I.,  have clearly shown that its first  interest\r\n\r\nis  political and that its inspiration  to  say  the\r\n\r\nleast  is  pro-Communist. The record  of  S.A.T.U.'s\r\n\r\naffiliated  unions on labour affairs over  the  past\r\n\r\nmonths  has been most deplorable. Over 1,000 workers\r\n\r\nhave  lost  their  jobs because of  their  misdeeds.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  they have to move this motion  to  cover\r\n\r\ntheir   evils.  Because  of  the  sabotage  of   our\r\n\r\nindustrial progress for political reasons,  hundreds\r\n\r\nof  workers have lost their jobs and countless young\r\n\r\nmen and women have been deprived of the prospect  of\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now deal with the details of\r\n\r\nthe cases that were mentioned \r\n\r\nby the Member  for Thomson.  Yesterday,  he mentioned  \r\n\r\nthe  holding  of secret ballots. At the last sitting I \r\n\r\nhave explained to this House why in the case of C. K. Tang a \r\n\r\nsecret ballot  could not be held when it was asked  for.  I\r\n\r\nwill just briefly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsay  that at that time there was legal advice to the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for  Labour  that  when   it   was   a\r\n\r\ncollective  and  registered  agreement,  no   secret\r\n\r\nballot could be held. So the Commissioner for Labour\r\n\r\nwas  not  happy with this advice because  this  goes\r\n\r\nagainst the principle of freedom of association.  He\r\n\r\ntook up this matter further with the State Advocate-General's  \r\n\r\nChambers.  The  State  Advocate-General's\r\n\r\nChambers  then  later  reviewed  this  decision  and\r\n\r\nadvised  the  Commissioner for  Labour  that  secret\r\n\r\nballot  could  be  held  even  in  a  case  where  a\r\n\r\nregistered and certified collective agreement is  in\r\n\r\nexistence.  So,  therefore, there is  no  fix-up  or\r\n\r\narrangement  to  suit the convenience  of  any  non-S.A.T.U. union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned yesterday, the Plywood case. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, this is the very thing I am going  to\r\n\r\nsay  to  refute  the allegations he made.  When  the\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. union came to know that there was  a  piece\r\n\r\nof advice that if there is a registered agreement, a\r\n\r\nsecret  ballot cannot be held, they quickly  availed\r\n\r\nthem  selves of this opportunity to go to  Court  to\r\n\r\nget  an old agreement registered. This agreement was\r\n\r\nsigned  in 1961 and it was due to expire very  soon.\r\n\r\nBut  the  union, afraid of losing their  membership,\r\n\r\nquickly  availed  themselves of the  legal  position\r\n\r\nthen  and  asked the Court to certify  and  register\r\n\r\nthat   agreement.   After   the   registration   and\r\n\r\ncertification,  the  union claimed  that  they  were\r\n\r\ncovered by this ruling and therefore a secret ballot\r\n\r\ncould  not  be  held. Therefore, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  is no such thing as discrimination between  a\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. union and a non-S.A.T.U. union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson yesterday mentioned the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance and me coercing the management\r\n\r\nof  the Plywood not to implement the agreement  that\r\n\r\nthey  had  signed. This is far from the  truth,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir. He threw a challenge yesterday  and  I\r\n\r\nam  prepared  to  accept his  challenge.  They  have\r\n\r\ncunningly  availed themselves of the technicality  I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned  just now to get the  old  agreement\r\n\r\nsigned, and then later on, by that course of action,\r\n\r\nprevent  a  secret ballot from being held.  So  they\r\n\r\nthen  entered into negotiations with the management.\r\n\r\nArising  out of that negotiation, they have  reached\r\n\r\nagreement on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  question of bonus. But then, according  to  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration  Court's  practice,   though\r\n\r\nnegotiations  have been concluded and  an  agreement\r\n\r\nhas  been signed, it should not be implemented until\r\n\r\nthat agreement has been registered and certified  by\r\n\r\nthe  Court. Now, because of this technicality again,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, the management could not implement\r\n\r\nthe agreement reached between the two parties. There\r\n\r\nis no such thing as that we want to deny the workers\r\n\r\nof the benefits they have achieved. That is far from\r\n\r\nthe  truth.  As  I have pointed out  just  now,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, we are going to face leaders like  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson and his colleagues who  try  :o\r\n\r\nmanipulate the unions for political purposes. But as\r\n\r\nfar  as  the workers are concerned, we are all  with\r\n\r\nthem  to  better  their  terms  and  conditions   of\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, we are very glad\r\n\r\nindeed  that the Member for Thomson has  moved  this\r\n\r\nmotion.  This shows that we have been successful  in\r\n\r\nimplementing  our  pro-labour policy.  There  is  no\r\n\r\ncause for us to be alarmed. That is why he is  in  a\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  position to hoodwink  the  workers.\r\n\r\nAccording to his own interpretation, the fundamental\r\n\r\nrights  of the workers mean that the workers  should\r\n\r\ngroup   together  and  they  should  be   used   and\r\n\r\nmanipulated  by  the pro-Communists  for  their  own\r\n\r\nends. But right from the beginning, we have made  it\r\n\r\nvery  clear that we are going to see that the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement  is  going to be  developed  into  a\r\n\r\nnational  independent trade union movement  for  the\r\n\r\nbetterment  of the workers and not for anti-national\r\n\r\nelements to make use of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has mentioned the Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  case.  This is also another  example  of  why\r\n\r\nbecause the pro-Communists have failed to control  a\r\n\r\nunion  for political purposes, they have made a  hue\r\n\r\nand  cry over it. They raise this up not because  of\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the 10,000 workers.  They  do  not\r\n\r\ncare  two hoots whether the workers' conditions  are\r\n\r\nimproved.  Well,  I will prove it. There  are  facts\r\n\r\ndown here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I will briefly deal with the\r\n\r\nderegistration of the Singapore Harbour Board  Staff\r\n\r\nAssociation. In October 1962, the Registrar of Trade\r\n\r\nUnions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninquired into the affairs of the Association. It was\r\n\r\nfound  that  the  Association  had  committed   many\r\n\r\nbreaches of the Trade Unions Ordinance and  its  own\r\n\r\nrules and constitution. The inquiry also reviewed  a\r\n\r\ncase   of   misappropriation  of   $7,634   of   the\r\n\r\nAssociation's  funds. Following investigations  into\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar of Trade Unions' report made on  12th\r\n\r\nOctober,   the  police  arrested  the  Association's\r\n\r\nGeneral  Secretary, Jamit Singh, and the  Treasurer,\r\n\r\nYeow  Fook Yin, and later charged them in Court with\r\n\r\ncriminal breach of trust. After a trial of  23  days\r\n\r\nin  the  First Criminal District Court, both accused\r\n\r\nwere  convicted  on 1st of March.  Jamit  Singh  was\r\n\r\ngaoled  for 18 months and Yeow Fook Yin nine months.\r\n\r\nHowever, they have given notice of appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 26th October, the Registrar of Trade Unions\r\n\r\nserved  a notice on the Association calling upon  it\r\n\r\nto  show  cause why its certificate of  registration\r\n\r\nshould  not be cancelled for having committed  eight\r\n\r\nbreaches   of  the  law  and  its  own   rules   and\r\n\r\nconstitution. The eight breaches are as follows -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think we should go\r\n\r\ninto  those details. There were breaches and I think\r\n\r\nwe  do  not want to list the eight breaches. We  are\r\n\r\nnot debating the cancellation of registration of the\r\n\r\nHarbour Board Association. I think the fact  of  the\r\n\r\ncancellation  is  sufficient. The  reasons  for  the\r\n\r\ncancellation, yes, but not too many details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> As you wish, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nIn  case the Member for Thomson would like to obtain\r\n\r\nmore details, I will reiterate them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Association submitted a lengthy memorandum\r\n\r\nin reply to the Registrar of Trade Union's notice to\r\n\r\nshow   cause.  As  the  memorandum  contained   many\r\n\r\ninaccuracies  and inconsistencies,  an  inquiry  was\r\n\r\nheld  in accordance with the provisions of the Trade\r\n\r\nUnion  Ordinance on the 15th and 16th of January  by\r\n\r\nthe R.T.U. to give the Association an opportunity to\r\n\r\nclarify   these  inaccuracies  and  inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the R.T.U. was compelled to call  off  the\r\n\r\ninquiry because at the two meetings, the officers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the Association were not only unwilling to answer\r\n\r\nquestions,   but  also  deliberately  concerted   to\r\n\r\ndisrupt  the proceedings. The Association was  given\r\n\r\nanother  opportunity on 18th January and  a  further\r\n\r\nopportunity  on 11th February to clarify  the  major\r\n\r\ninaccuracies and inconsistencies in its  memorandum.\r\n\r\nUp  to  date  the Association has not done  so.  The\r\n\r\ncancellation  of  the Association's  certificate  of\r\n\r\nregistration was therefore made last week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the point of the mystery of the new\r\n\r\nCommittee  and the old Committee, as the Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson  put  it, Mr Speaker, Sir. On the  15th  of\r\n\r\nNovember,  1962,  the  Association  elected  a   new\r\n\r\nExecutive  Council. Immediately this  new  Executive\r\n\r\nCouncil  was elected a member later filed a writ  of\r\n\r\nsummons  in the High Court asking that the elections\r\n\r\nbe  declared  null and void. This  action  is  still\r\n\r\npending.  Therefore, under those circumstances,  the\r\n\r\nBoard  and the R.T.U. could not recognise  which  is\r\n\r\nthe  regular  and  legal body  that  represents  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I will  go  on  to  the\r\n\r\nclaims later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the Member for Thomson's allegation that\r\n\r\nbecause the Prime Minister or the Government  failed\r\n\r\nto  control  the  Harbour Board  Staff  Association,\r\n\r\ntherefore, it has to take this action, this  is  not\r\n\r\ntrue.  Why? For instance, the holding of the  annual\r\n\r\ngeneral meetings. This Association for the past four\r\n\r\nyears has failed to hold any meeting to elect office-hearers.  And mind you, Mr Speaker, Sir, a reminder\r\n\r\nwas  sent  to  the Secretary General, that  is,  Mr\r\n\r\nJamit   Singh  (who  proclaimed  that  he  had   the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the workers) on the 5th of  November,\r\n\r\n1959,  informing him that his Association had failed\r\n\r\nto  hold  a  general election to elect  new  office-bearers.  That  is  a provision  laid  down  in  his\r\n\r\nUnion's  constitution. Again, on the 9th of January,\r\n\r\n1960, a further reminder was served on the Secretary-General  informing  him  of the  holding  of  annual\r\n\r\nmeetings. Again it went unheeded. So, on the 2nd  of\r\n\r\nMarch,  1960,  a further reminder was  sent  to  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General, but he still refused  to  hold  a\r\n\r\nmeeting.  This is the point, Mr Speaker, Sir.  They\r\n\r\nknow  they are going to lose control of the workers'\r\n\r\norganisation if they do hold a meeting. They will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnever  think  or  bear in mind what the  fundamental\r\n\r\nrights  of  the workers mean. No, to them,  that  is\r\n\r\nimmaterial.  As  long as their interests  are  being\r\n\r\nserved,  that  is,  as  long as  they  can  maintain\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  the organisation, to their  minds,  the\r\n\r\nfundamental  rights of the workers are being  upheld\r\n\r\nand maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from not holding an annual general meeting\r\n\r\nevery  year, the Secretary-General, Mr Jamit Singh,\r\n\r\nalso  failed  to submit to the members  and  to  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Trade  Unions  the  yearly  financial\r\n\r\naccounts.  You will remember, Sir, he was prosecuted\r\n\r\nduring the term of office of the previous Government\r\n\r\nfor failing to submit the accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, briefly, these are the causes why the Registrar had to step in to regularise the position. Of course, for the Government, this is a matter of concern. For the past few years, these people have not only failed to allow the workers to run their own organisations, but they have been making use of them for their own political purposes and have\r\n\r\nneglected the interests of the workers. Now they are\r\n\r\ntalking  about  the  interests of  the  workers  and\r\n\r\nasking for more pay and better conditions of service\r\n\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now my colleagues, the Deputy Speaker and the Member for Kampong Kapor, have pointed out how this claim came about. During the Anson by-election, the Member for Thomson and all his colleagues decided to part with us because we were going to seriously and sincerely seek the\r\n\r\nachievement of the establishment of Malaysia. So  in\r\n\r\norder  to  find an opportunity to rally the  workers\r\n\r\nround  to their side, they therefore made out a  set\r\n\r\nof  demands to serve on the Harbour Board.  This  is\r\n\r\njust  another  cover  to show  that  they  have  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the workers at heart. So  during  the\r\n\r\nAnson  by-election, they served the  claims  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers on the Harbour Board and made a hue and  cry\r\n\r\nabout it. Chok Koh Thong, one of the members in  the\r\n\r\nExecutive  Committee, who was then on our  side  and\r\n\r\nalso an official on our Election Committee, bad been\r\n\r\ntreacherously making use of this issue to betray  us\r\n\r\nin that by-election, and as a result -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have tried to follow the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary very closely, but  I  cannot\r\n\r\nsee  how that part of his speech has any bearing  on\r\n\r\nthe motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to\r\n\r\nmake  this  point in order to refute the  allegation\r\n\r\nmade  by  the Member for Thomson that the Government\r\n\r\nand  the Prime Minister want to get control  of  the\r\n\r\nunion and also to frustrate the workers' attempt  to\r\n\r\nbetter  their  terms and conditions of  service.  So\r\n\r\nwhen  the  claims were served, negotiations  started\r\n\r\nand  agreement was reached on almost  all  of  them,\r\n\r\nexcept  on three or four items, but after the  Anson\r\n\r\nby-election the Secretary-General and the Member for\r\n\r\nThomson  just conveniently forgot about  them.  Then\r\n\r\nagain  at the time of the National Referendum,  this\r\n\r\nissue was revived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again in this instance, when we are coming to the\r\n\r\nrealisation of Malaysia, the Member for  Thomson  is\r\n\r\nagain  trying  to  make use of this  opportunity  to\r\n\r\ncreate industrial unrest. Now here is the point, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir. The Member for Thomson always makes  a\r\n\r\nsolemn  pledge  to  this  House  that  he  maintains\r\n\r\nindustrial peace with justice and he wants  to  make\r\n\r\nuse   of  the  State  machinery  to  resolve   trade\r\n\r\ndisputes.  He is fully aware that this  dispute  had\r\n\r\nbeen  directed  to  arbitration,  and  there  is   a\r\n\r\nprovision  in  the  Industrial  Relations  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwhich  states that if the Court takes cognisance  of\r\n\r\nthe  dispute,  then  no further  industrial  action,\r\n\r\neither  on the part of the employer or the employee,\r\n\r\ncan  be  taken. So there you are, Mr Speaker,  Sir.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Thomson, who outwardly proclaims  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the interests of the workers, is trying  to\r\n\r\nmislead the 10,000 workers into defying the law  and\r\n\r\nthereby  suffer the consequences. He claims to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the  interests  of the  workers.  During  the\r\n\r\nperiod when the notice was served on the Association\r\n\r\nto  call  for  an  explanation why the  cancellation\r\n\r\nshould  be  withdrawn, if his colleague,  Mr  Jamit\r\n\r\nSingh, failed to make a case out of it, why did  not\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Thomson,  if  he  really  had  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the workers at heart, help him\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto make out a case to withdraw the cancellation. No,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir. The Member for Thomson did not  do\r\n\r\nthat.  And  here again he talked about  negotiations\r\n\r\nand said that there are two Committees. In fact, the\r\n\r\nworkers have filed a motion in the Court against the\r\n\r\nvalidity  of  the  new Committee. This  is  a  fact.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he still tries to deceive the  workers\r\n\r\nby  saying that they still have a legal and  regular\r\n\r\nCommittee  and  that the Board should recognise  it.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, in that case, the Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nwill  have to over-ride the Court and recognise this\r\n\r\nnew  Committee.  And he is the man who  always  says\r\n\r\nthat he is law-abiding, that we are undemocratic and\r\n\r\nthat we always go above the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cancellation of this Association, if the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson was really serious, he could have\r\n\r\nanswered the nine questions that were posed  to  the\r\n\r\nAssociation  to  answer.  If  he  had  done  so  and\r\n\r\nsincerely made an effort to regularise the position,\r\n\r\nthe   Registrar   of   Trade   Unions   might   have\r\n\r\nreconsidered  the case and the deregistration  might\r\n\r\nnot  have been necessary. But no, Mr Speaker,  Sir.\r\n\r\nHe  did  not  do this. He asked the workers - and  by\r\n\r\nmaking use of Mr Markandu - to do something irregular\r\n\r\nand illegal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have dwelt at length on refuting the allegations made by the Member for Thomson. The main purpose of this motion is to smear those people who really sacrifice a lot of their time to work for the interest of the workers such as, as he mentioned just now, Mr Gomez, the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General  of  the  Singapore   Manual   and\r\n\r\nMercantile Workers Union. The Barisan know that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Manual and Mercantile Workers Union  have\r\n\r\nbeen  sincerely  and  diligently  working  for   the\r\n\r\ninterest  of the workers and it is because  of  this\r\n\r\neffort that this union has increased its membership -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta):</b> On a point of\r\n\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Do we have a quorum?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We do not have it quorum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice taken that thirteen Members were not\r\n\r\npresent,  Members  summoned as  if  for  a  division\r\n\r\npursuant to the Standing Order, and meeting  resumed\r\n\r\nupon a quorum being then present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will\r\n\r\nconclude  my speech.

The language  used  is\r\n\r\nsingularly the same as in previous motions submitted\r\n\r\nby  Members  belonging to the Barisan Sosialis.  The\r\n\r\nbasic  substance  is  no different.  The  intent  is\r\n\r\ncommon.  And what is more, the tone and the language\r\n\r\nis tense.

This motion is  clearly  a  pro-Communist   manoeuvre.  It  seeks  to  condemn   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  because the Government  is  supposed  to\r\n\r\nhave disrupted trade union activity inimical to  its\r\n\r\nown  interests. The pro-Communist adventurers in the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis can thank their lucky  stars  that\r\n\r\nthey  are still living under a democratic system  of\r\n\r\ngovernment where\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey can still make use of their democratic right to\r\n\r\nfight the parliamentary system of democracy.

The certificate of registration of the Singapore Harbour Board Staff\r\n\r\nAssociation  was  cancelled because the  Association\r\n\r\nhad  contravened the Trade Unions Ordinance and  the\r\n\r\nAssociation's  own rules and constitution  on  eight\r\n\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These eight grounds are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Association had wilfully, after repeated\r\n\r\nnotices   from   the  Registrar,   contravened   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  section  44  of  the  Trade   Unions\r\n\r\nOrdinance  for failing to submit its annual  returns\r\n\r\nfor the financial years 1960/61 and 1961/62.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The General-Secretary of the Association had\r\n\r\ncontravened  the  provisions of section  44  of  the\r\n\r\nTrade   Unions  Ordinance  and  Rule   11   of   the\r\n\r\nAssociation's  rules for failing to deliver  to  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Association audited  statements  of\r\n\r\naccount for the financial years 1960/61 and 1961/62.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Treasurer of the Association had\r\n\r\ncontravened  the  Association's  Rule  11  (e)    for\r\n\r\nfailing to prepare monthly financial statements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The accounts of the Association for the year\r\n\r\n1961/62   had  not  been  audited  by  the  internal\r\n\r\nauditors in contravention of the Association's  Rule\r\n\r\n12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The Executive Council of the Association had\r\n\r\nfailed  to  exercise proper control and  supervision\r\n\r\nover the duties of the General-Secretary as required\r\n\r\nunder the Association's Rule 10 (b) .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The officers of the Association had, from time\r\n\r\nto  time,  on  matters of importance  affecting  the\r\n\r\nAssociation, passed resolutions by a show of  hands,\r\n\r\ncontrary to the Association's Rule 15 which requires\r\n\r\nsuch matters to be decided by secret ballot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The constitution of the Association's present\r\n\r\nExecutive  Council is unlawful, as  the  Association\r\n\r\nhad  not held an annual general meeting to elect new\r\n\r\nofficers    for   four   consecutive    years,    in\r\n\r\ncontravention of its Rule 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The funds of the Association had been expended\r\n\r\nin  an unlawful manner and its Executive Council had\r\n\r\nfailed  in  its duty to protect union funds  against\r\n\r\nextravagance  and/or  misappropriation  as  required\r\n\r\nunder Rule 10 (f) .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the S.H.B. Staff Association was unable to answer these eight charges. When an inquiry was arranged to give the Association opportunities to reply to these charges of contravening against the law and the Association's rules and constitution, the officers of the\r\n\r\nAssociation  were  not  only  unwilling  to   answer\r\n\r\nquestions - probably because they could not answer the\r\n\r\nquestions    - but   deliberately    disrupted    the\r\n\r\nproceedings of the inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson yesterday accused the Government of using the Police against the strikers of Sassoon Company. This is one of those stock charges regularly used by the Communists. Mr Speaker, Sir, the allegation is untrue. There was a strike in this company on 21st\r\n\r\nJuly,  1960. The strikers, however, refused to leave\r\n\r\nthe  premises after its normal closing hours. On the\r\n\r\nadvice of the State Advocate-General's Chambers that\r\n\r\nthe  strikers were committing trespass, the strikers\r\n\r\nwere politely advised by the police to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleave the premises and to come again and picket  the\r\n\r\nnext   day.  The  repeated  advice  of  the  police,\r\n\r\nhowever,  was ignored and the police were eventually\r\n\r\nforced  to take seven strikers to the Central Police\r\n\r\nStation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On arrival at the police station, the leader of\r\n\r\nthe  strikers feigned illness anti alleged  that  he\r\n\r\nwas  assaulted by the police. He refused to sit  and\r\n\r\npreferred  to  lie on the ground  and  roll  on  the\r\n\r\nfloor.  Seeing this, another striker also complained\r\n\r\nof  assault by the police, and he too rolled on  the\r\n\r\nfloor. The police immediately summoned the ambulance\r\n\r\nto  take  the  two  complainants  to  the  hospital.\r\n\r\nHowever,  when  the  ambulance  arrived,  these  two\r\n\r\nstrikers  refused to go to hospital as  they  wanted\r\n\r\ntheir   union   representatives  to  witness   their\r\n\r\ncondition. About 15 minutes later Messrs. Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong, S. Woodhull, and Fong Swee Suan arrived. They\r\n\r\ninterviewed the strikers and persuaded them to go to\r\n\r\nthe General Hospital for a check-up. So an ambulance\r\n\r\nwas  called  a second time, to the inconvenience  of\r\n\r\neverybody  concerned. Even then on  arrival  at  the\r\n\r\nhospital  one of the complainants changed  his  mind\r\n\r\nand refused to be examined by the doctor. A few days\r\n\r\nlater,  when I had the occasion to meet Mr Woodhull\r\n\r\nand   challenged  him  as  to  the  truth   of   the\r\n\r\nallegations  of assault made by these two  strikers,\r\n\r\nhe  laughed heartily and had to admit that they were\r\n\r\nrather childish in making such allegations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Mr Speaker, Sir, there was the\r\n\r\nfamous case of the Roneo Company strike in which the\r\n\r\nPresident  and  Secretary of the Singapore  Business\r\n\r\nHouses  Employees' Union were charged and  convicted\r\n\r\nin  Court  for assaulting non-strikers and customers\r\n\r\nwho  had  burning cigarette butts pressed  on  their\r\n\r\nnecks.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  who  were  the  violent\r\n\r\naggressors? Not the police. The police were there to\r\n\r\nsafeguard the right of ordinary people to  work  and\r\n\r\nto  ensure peace in society. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is\r\n\r\nbecoming  clear  that what the  Member  for  Thomson\r\n\r\nmeant   by  disruption  of  trade  unions  is  quite\r\n\r\nsomething else. As\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI   have  said,  there  is  nothing  to  show   that\r\n\r\nGovernment is doing anything to shut down unions led\r\n\r\nby the pro-Communists. This disruption that they are\r\n\r\nworried  and concerned about is none other than  the\r\n\r\nsteady  flow of workers from the unions led by  them\r\n\r\ninto  the ranks of non-Communist unions. If  anybody\r\n\r\nis  disrupting the pro-Communist unions, it  is  the\r\n\r\nworkers who, having realised that the pro-Communists\r\n\r\nand  anti-national  elements  in  their  unions  are\r\n\r\nmaking use of them for their own political ends, are\r\n\r\nnow  determined to free themselves from the grip  of\r\n\r\nthe  pro-Communists and anti-national elements. Ever\r\n\r\nsince  1962  more than 5,000 workers  and  38  union\r\n\r\nbranches  have  broken away from  the  pro-Communist\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. to  the side of democratic  trade  unions.\r\n\r\nThese  pro-Communists have only themselves to  blame\r\n\r\nif  large  numbers  of workers are disrupting  their\r\n\r\nsinister  political designs. Surely they  must  know\r\n\r\nthat they cannot mislead the workers all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if it were not for the fact that the Government has faith in the ultimate wisdom of workers, it would itself be complaining about the disruption of unions in Singapore. As is well known, it is the policy of the Government that whenever union representation in any particular place of\r\n\r\nemployment is in question, recourse is made  to  the\r\n\r\nholding  of  a  secret  ballot  to  determine   such\r\n\r\nrepresentation.  Very recent cases have  shown  that\r\n\r\nthis  provision in the State machinery has, in fact,\r\n\r\nresulted  in  an  advantage  to  some  of  the  pro-Communist  unions  under  the  control  of  S.A.T.U.\r\n\r\nSecret  ballots taken among workers in the Singapore\r\n\r\nPlywood  Company and the C. K. Tang Co.  Ltd, have\r\n\r\nresulted  in  a  victory for the S.A.T.U. group  of\r\n\r\nunions. Sir, the unions which have lost as a  result\r\n\r\nof  this  recourse  to the secret  ballot  have  not\r\n\r\nuttered one word of complaint. Surely this cannot be\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  State machinery for the disruption  of\r\n\r\ntrade  unions, as is so vehemently contended in  the\r\n\r\npro-Communist  motion  submitted  by  S.A.T.U.   The\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson knows this very well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to deal with that part of the pro-Communist motion about the registration of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Association of Trade Unions. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  time is running out for all anti-national  and\r\n\r\npro-Communist  elements  in Singapore.  Malaysia  is\r\n\r\naround  the  corner.  In the  past  the  doings  and\r\n\r\nutterances  of leaders of S.A.T.U. have only  helped\r\n\r\nto  confirm  their  anti-national and  pro-Communist\r\n\r\ncharacter.   Their  anti-Malaysia  and   anti-merger\r\n\r\npostures  prove that they are working in  line  with\r\n\r\nforeign forces which are also anti-Malaysia and anti-merger. They have repeated the anti-Malaysia slogans\r\n\r\nof  alien  and  foreign forces hostile to  Malaysian\r\n\r\nnationalism. Under the circumstances, do they expect\r\n\r\npeople  to  make  them out to be  other  than  anti-nationals and pro-Communists? Or do they think  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  and the people are blind  to  their\r\n\r\nanti-national activities? If the Member for  Thomson\r\n\r\nwants  S.A.T.U. to  be registered,  he  had  better\r\n\r\nconvince the Internal Security Council, and soon the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Internal  Security  of  the   Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  Malaysia, that his S.A.T.U. is  not\r\n\r\nforeign-inspired   and   not   a   Communist   front\r\n\r\norganisation.  He had better take a  lead  from  Mr\r\n\r\nDange, the Secretary-General of the Communist  Party\r\n\r\nof  India, who realises that in the face of  foreign\r\n\r\nhostility and foreign aggression, national interests\r\n\r\nmust supersede ideological considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson can rest assured for a long\r\n\r\ntime  to  come  that the Government is  a  patriotic\r\n\r\nGovernment and that it will do nothing to register a\r\n\r\ngroup  of unions which constitute a Communist  front\r\n\r\norganisation and whose leaders have their ears tuned\r\n\r\nto foreign centres for inspiration and guidance. The\r\n\r\nMember  for Thomson must never deceive himself  into\r\n\r\nbelieving that any government in the world will ever\r\n\r\nallow or encourage internal forces hostile to itself\r\n\r\nto  work in conjuction with foreign elements to down\r\n\r\nthe government. Only traitors will try to do such  a\r\n\r\nthing. The Government and the people of this country\r\n\r\nwill ensure that this type of treachery will not  be\r\n\r\npermitted,  and  if there is the slightest  evidence\r\n\r\nthat it is going to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperpetrated, then it will be the Governmen's bounden\r\n\r\nduty to prevent it well before it is carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, S.A.T.U. is supposed to be an association of trade unions with trade union objectives. Not only is it political in origin, but since its formation its activities clearly show that its major interest is political. Its main preoccupation is to bring about the downfall of the\r\n\r\nGovernment, to frustrate merger, and to prevent  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of Malaysia. It does not even  attempt\r\n\r\nto  hide  its  true aims. The record  of  S.A.T.U.'s\r\n\r\naffiliated unions on labour matters confirms  beyond\r\n\r\na  shadow of doubt that they want to bring  about  a\r\n\r\nstate  of  unrest and later a state  of  chaos  with\r\n\r\nwhich  they  hope  to  bring  down  the  Government,\r\n\r\nleading  to  a  halt  progress  towards  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  As  a  result of their  sabotage  of  our\r\n\r\nindustrial progress for political reasons, thousands\r\n\r\nof  workers have lost their jobs and countless young\r\n\r\nmen  and women have been deprived of their prospects\r\n\r\nfor work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it that the Minister will take\r\n\r\nsome time?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> About ten more minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Then this is a very convenient time\r\n\r\nto  suspend for tea.

Mr Ben Bella has  done\r\n\r\nit;  Mr Nehru has done it; Prince Sihanouk has done\r\n\r\nit, and we shall not hesitate to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like very much if the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\ncan give examples of the fundamental rights provided\r\n\r\nfor  the  Opposition  in totalitarian  countries  of\r\n\r\nwhich  he  and  his colleagues in the  S.A.T.U. are\r\n\r\napparently  great admirers. The Member  for  Thomson\r\n\r\nknows very well that it is not at all likely that he\r\n\r\nwill be able to introduce a motion like this in  any\r\n\r\nof   the   countries  from  which   he   draws   his\r\n\r\ninspiration. Even if he tried to, he would  probably\r\n\r\nbe  lined up against the hard wall and shot. In this\r\n\r\ncountry, he knows of course he will not be shot  for\r\n\r\ntabling  a motion like this, and that. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nis  the  irony of it all. Under this Government,  he\r\n\r\ncan  table  a motion and still sit there comfortably\r\n\r\nand enjoy, and make another speech at the end of it.\r\n\r\nThis  fundamental right is also extended to him  and\r\n\r\nother  pro-Communist elements to form organisations,\r\n\r\nhold  rallies,  demonstrations,  print  and  publish\r\n\r\njournals  and other literature. But let  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson give examples of these rights  provided\r\n\r\nfor  the  Opposition  in the totalitarian  countries\r\n\r\nwhich  he admires so much. The Member knows that  so\r\n\r\nlong  as he issues his union publications to advance\r\n\r\nlabour  and union matters and protect the  interests\r\n\r\nof  workers,  then the right will be recognised  and\r\n\r\nrespected.  But he also knows that if any  of  these\r\n\r\nrights  are  misused and abused by using  them,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,   to   disseminate   political    material\r\n\r\nprejudicial to our national interests and calculated\r\n\r\nto  help  foreign  forces hostile  to  the  national\r\n\r\ninterests, then these rights must be denied them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Government is committed to the\r\n\r\nencouragement of a free, democratic and  independent trade union \r\n\r\nmovement in the State as an essential  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprerequisite for the success of its social, economic\r\n\r\nand  industrial policies. However, as the  Director-General of the International Labour Organisation has\r\n\r\nobserved in his Report to the I.L.O. Conference held\r\n\r\nin  Geneva in June 1963, the paramount consideration\r\n\r\nof  any  government must be the preservation of  the\r\n\r\nsecurity  of the State against foreign-inspired  and\r\n\r\nanti-patriotic elements. This is what the  Director-General has said on page 25 of his Report under  the\r\n\r\nheading \"Political Conditions\" and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The first imperative for government is the\r\n\r\npreservation  of the state, of public order  and  of\r\n\r\nthe political conditions for carrying out any policy\r\n\r\nwhether  in  economic, social or other  fields.  The\r\n\r\nproblems  of maintaining political stability  are  a\r\n\r\ngreater  claim upon the attention and the  resources\r\n\r\nof  leaders  in many newly emergent nations  and  in\r\n\r\nother  countries as well than they may he in certain\r\n\r\nof the historically longer established states.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this statement of the Director- General of the I.L.O. fits us to perfection. The Government of Singapore is a patriotic Government hut finds itself in a situation in which it has to deal with dangerous anti-national elements. Some of these anti-national elements happen to be trade\r\n\r\nunionists who have allowed themselves to become sub-servient tools of foreign powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all law-abiding states deny rights of association to criminals. Similarly, all states which value their national integrity and independence must of necessity be obliged to deny rights of association to anti-patriotic elements who look for inspiration from foreign sources. However,\r\n\r\nfor  all practical purposes, the fundamental  rights\r\n\r\nof association as contained in the I.L.O. Convention\r\n\r\nNo.  84  is,  in fact, implemented in  Singapore  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the  free, independent  and  democratic\r\n\r\ntrade  union  movement in the State.  This  Assembly\r\n\r\nmight  do well to remember that the democratic trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement in Singapore is very often  at  odds\r\n\r\nwith  the  Government, but for them  the  rights  of\r\n\r\nassociation and assembly are guaranteed for they  do\r\n\r\nnot endanger national security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson knows that\r\n\r\nhe is not going to get away with it. He  knows that every  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nword  in this pro-Communist motion which goes  under\r\n\r\nhis  name is downright hypocrisy to which no one who\r\n\r\nbelieves in democracy will concede. The only  reason\r\n\r\nleft  for having brought this old, old song is  that\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Thomson enjoys the freedom to  waste\r\n\r\nthe  precious time of this House just because he and\r\n\r\nhis  friends  have  to  wait  for  orders  from  the\r\n\r\nCommunist underground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I oppose this motion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does any other Member wish to speak?\r\n\r\nNo.?

We\r\n\r\nhave  told  them in the past and we tell them  again\r\n\r\nthat  if  they  accuse us of being Communists,  pro-Communists,  Communist sympathisers, they  have  all\r\n\r\nthe  courts they need, they have all the  laws  they\r\n\r\nwant.  They can take us to the courts, have an  open\r\n\r\nfair  trial and prove that we are Communists. Having\r\n\r\nproved  that, they can lock us up and we say, \"Well,\r\n\r\nfair  enough.\" But not to lock up 134  chaps  simply\r\n\r\nbecause  the Minister for Finance, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs,  the Prime Minister, three  gentlemen\r\n\r\nfrom  the  British High Commission and the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Internal Security in the Federation think  that\r\n\r\nwe are security risks to this country!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is hypocritical for anybody on the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nside to say that we are anti-nationalists. A man who\r\n\r\nis pro-national must necessarily have a love for his\r\n\r\ncountry.  He  must  be prepared  to  fight  for  the\r\n\r\nintegrity  of  his  country. He must  be  patriotic.\r\n\r\nThese people who sit across the Floor are right  now\r\n\r\nselling the country to the British colonialists  and\r\n\r\nthe   imperialists,   and   they   call   themselves\r\n\r\npatriotic!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first thing any patriot ought to do is to\r\n\r\nfight  for the freedom of the country, as Mr  Nehru\r\n\r\ndid. They have the cheek to stand up and quote names\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike   Pandit  Nehru,  Ben  Bella,  Soekarno.   Sir,\r\n\r\nSoekarno  fought  for years. He  took  up  arms  and\r\n\r\nfought  for the independence of Indonesia.  Mr  Lee\r\n\r\nKuan Yew, our Prime Minister, has not even spent ten\r\n\r\nseconds  in  prison. Sir, which anti-colonialist  in\r\n\r\nthis  world has independence without going to  gaol?\r\n\r\nNehru  - 10 years and over! Soekarno, Ben Bella!  And\r\n\r\nthese  men  who sell the interest of the country  to\r\n\r\nthe   British,   Americans,  foreign   powers,   and\r\n\r\ncolonialists who have exploited and seek to  further\r\n\r\nexploit  it  by having a constitutional  arrangement\r\n\r\nwhich will give covert control to the British,  call\r\n\r\nthemselves patriotic!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, secondly, this question of S.A.T.U. being\r\n\r\npolitical.  I say with no reservation that  S.A.T.U.\r\n\r\nis   political,  that  S.A.T.U. trade  unions   are\r\n\r\npolitical.  There is no qualification.  We  are  not\r\n\r\nhypocrites  like  Mr Devan Nair. It  is  true  that\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. unions are anti-Malaysia.  We  have  never\r\n\r\nmade  this  a  secret.  It is hypocritical  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  suggest that to be anti-Malaysia  is\r\n\r\npolitical,  to  be  pro-Malaysia is  not  political.\r\n\r\nDevan   Nair,  the  N.T.U.C. come  out   supporting\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  The Prime Minister goes to London;  Devan\r\n\r\nNair  sends  a letter to all N.T.U.C. unions  asking\r\n\r\nthem  to  go  to  the  Airport to  express  support.\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. unions  have  often  come  out  supporting\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  In  their  logic,  Mr  Speaker,  if  you\r\n\r\nexpress  support for Malaysia, it is  non-political.\r\n\r\nIf  you  say you are anti-Malaysia, it is political.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  do  not have to waste my time dealing  with\r\n\r\nsuch  hypocrisy. The S.A.T.U. unions  are  political\r\n\r\nbecause  we  believe that over 90 per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  are  composed  of  workers   and   their\r\n\r\nfamilies,  and  trade  unions  as  organisations  of\r\n\r\nworkers  in  a  society  must  necessarily  interest\r\n\r\nthemselves in the political affairs of the  country.\r\n\r\nNobody  can  tell the workers not to  be  political.\r\n\r\nThose  who tell the workers not to be political  are\r\n\r\npeople  like  the colonialists and big business  who\r\n\r\nhave  fear  of  the majority of the  people  in  the\r\n\r\ncountry. Sir, the trade unions in the S.A.T.U. group\r\n\r\nare  political. There is one difference between  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. type  of political activities in  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. type, and this is a fact that is borne out.\r\n\r\nWhile  they  believe that the trade  union  movement\r\n\r\nmust  be  part and parcel of the P.A.P., while  they\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the trade union movement  must  be  a\r\n\r\nsubsidiary organisation of the P.A.P., the  S.A.T.U.\r\n\r\nunions  believe  in  being an independent  socialist\r\n\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kapor is not here. He\r\n\r\nknows,  Mr Devan Nair knows, the Member for Kallang\r\n\r\nknows  and  Ow  Kheng  Thor, the  Deputy  Secretary-General  of  A.U.P.E. knows. Four  members  of  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C. secretariat. They know very well  why  there\r\n\r\nwas a crisis in the T.U.C. Secretariat. It is all in\r\n\r\nthe  record, in black and white. The Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwanted  to make the T.U.C. a subsidiary organisation\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P. in 1960. We were in the P.A.P. at that\r\n\r\ntime and we said no. That is a fact. Minutes of  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C.  Secretariat meetings, which I have,  can  be\r\n\r\npublished.  Minutes of meetings of  the  Secretariat\r\n\r\nwith  the Prime Minister can be published. When  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong Lim was expelled, the  Secretariat\r\n\r\nwas  intimidated into issuing a statement in  favour\r\n\r\nof  the  ruling Party, all over a matter  which  was\r\n\r\npurely   internal  party  politics,  and  which   we\r\n\r\nresisted; and we were threatened that if we did  not\r\n\r\ndo  that, the T.U.C. would be closed down. These men\r\n\r\nwant to call themselves independent democratic trade\r\n\r\nunionists. I say this is hypocrisy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Culture, who is also not\r\n\r\nhere  now, once told me in the presence of the  full\r\n\r\nSecretariat  - 10 members, including Devan  Nair  and\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Kampong Kapor - that if there  was  no\r\n\r\nP.A.P. there would be no T.U.C.; and this again  is\r\n\r\nin the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not believe that the trade union movement\r\n\r\nmust  become  a  tool  of .my  political  Party.  We\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  trade  unions  as  organisations   of\r\n\r\nworkers,   as  organisations  which  represent   the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the  people,  the  majority  of  human\r\n\r\nbeings, the majority of the people who compose  the\r\n\r\nelectorate,  must interest themselves  in  political\r\n\r\ndevelopments, must   give  expression   to   their\r\n\r\npolitical feelings and must be politically\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactive. Unlike the N.T.U.C. and the P.A.P., we  have\r\n\r\nnever  hidden this from the members of  our  unions.\r\n\r\nWhen   the  P.A.P. became  anti-labour,  anti-trade\r\n\r\nunions,  we did not hesitate to come out openly  and\r\n\r\ncondemn them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs says that\r\n\r\nfundamental  rights  must be deprived  from  certain\r\n\r\nindividuals.  Now,  I say this,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\neither you are a democrat or you are not a democrat.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister talks about what happens in  so-called\r\n\r\ntotalitarian  countries. Sir, none of  us  from  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis and none of us from  the  S.A.T.U.\r\n\r\nunions  have ever asked the Singapore Government  to\r\n\r\nset  up  a totalitarian government in Singapore.  We\r\n\r\nhave   never   preached  the   establishment   of   a\r\n\r\ntotalitarian  government as the  Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs suggests. Our starting point has always been\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  and  democracy  must  mean  the   people\r\n\r\ndeciding  freely what they want. Democracy does  not\r\n\r\nmean  the  Minister for Home Affairs  arrogating  to\r\n\r\nhimself   the  right  to  decide  who  should   have\r\n\r\nfundamental rights to exercise. Democracy  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that  a  handfull of discredited,  power-crazy\r\n\r\nindividuals can decide what is good for the  people.\r\n\r\nAnybody  in  Singapore can examine our  records  and\r\n\r\nthey  will  find from the very beginning till  today\r\n\r\nour  claims  and demands have been on the  basis  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  We  opposed  the  Referendum   Bill   as\r\n\r\nundemocratic.  We  said we wanted  a  constitutional\r\n\r\narrangement to let the people freely decide. General\r\n\r\nelections - we say you do not manipulate; let that  be\r\n\r\nunder United Nations supervision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Harbour Board Staff Association. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, the Association called for a general meeting of\r\n\r\nall  its  members  on the 15th July,  1963, on  the\r\n\r\ngrounds of the Singapore Railway Recreation Club  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  workers  could decide  freely  and  in  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic manner whether they should take a  strike\r\n\r\ndecision if the demand for recognition was not  met.\r\n\r\nThe police banned that meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every single demand that we have made has been on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  of democracy. Sir, we believe  in  true,\r\n\r\nopen, free and fair competition with all political\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforces,  be they Fascist, opportunist, or Right-wing\r\n\r\nreactionary. We believe we can eliminate the  forces\r\n\r\nof  reaction and colonialism. We believe that  in  a\r\n\r\nfree  and fair competition the people will naturally\r\n\r\r\nchoose socialism and democracy. It is because we are\r\n\r\nconfident  in this belief that we are not afraid  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  that we are not afraid  of  giving  them\r\n\r\ncitizenship status, not afraid of their having their\r\n\r\ntrade  union  meetings. We are  not  afraid  of  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. unions coming out supporting Malaysia.  We\r\n\r\nare  not  afraid  because we are  confident  of  our\r\n\r\nconvictions. We are confident that we are right.  We\r\n\r\nare confident that truth will triumph. I venture  to\r\n\r\nsuggest,  Mr  Speaker,  that  in  the  history   of\r\n\r\nmankind,   it  is  those  who  do  not   have   this\r\n\r\nconfidence,  those  who do not have  the  confidence\r\n\r\nthat  in a free and fair competition they will stand\r\n\r\na  chance,  that  they indulge in undemocratic  acts\r\n\r\ncancel trade unions, deregister trade unions,  deny\r\n\r\nregistration,  deprive citizenship, lock  up  people\r\n\r\nwithout  trial, it is these people who do  not  have\r\n\r\nconfidence that they can beat their opponents  in  a\r\n\r\nfree  competition  who indulge  in  repression,  and\r\n\r\nhistory is full of such examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to spend a few minutes to try to\r\n\r\nanswer  one  or two points raised by the  Government\r\n\r\nspeakers. First of all, Mr Speaker, the Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kapor and the Member for Telok Blangah.  It\r\n\r\nis  well  known in Singapore today that the  Members\r\n\r\nfor  Kampong Kapor and Telok Blangah are  trying  to\r\n\r\nride  on two horses at the same time. This is a very\r\n\r\ndifficult  job.  They cannot do  tight-rope  walking\r\n\r\nunless  they are prepared to get their necks  broken\r\n\r\none  of  these days. Sir, they are, sooner or later,\r\n\r\ngoing to quit the P.A.P. and come out and save their\r\n\r\nindependence,  more independent  than  the  N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\ntrade  unionists and, therefore, now they are laying\r\n\r\nthe  basis. They say, \"You know, the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nmay  be  wrong; he must not go to the Harbour Board.\r\n\r\nBut  the  S.A.T.U. chaps also must  not  go  to  the\r\n\r\nHarbour Board.\" This is elementary politics. We know\r\n\r\nhow  the Member for Kampong Kapor had difficulty  in\r\n\r\ndealing with Government over the nurses' strike.  We\r\n\r\nknow how he had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  dealing  with  Government  over  the\r\n\r\npolice  strike;  and the motion says,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  \"non-P.A.P. unions\". By non-P.A.P. unions,  we\r\n\r\nmean   unions  which  are  not  submissive  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  which  are not controlled  and  led  by\r\n\r\nGovernment men. As far as the A.U.P.E. is concerned,\r\n\r\nthe  Union of the Member for Kampong Kapor no  doubt\r\n\r\nwas   at  one  time  completely  controlled  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The Member for Kampong  Kapor  was  the\r\n\r\nblue-eyed boy of the Prime Minister, and that is how\r\n\r\nhe  got  elected as Secretary-General of the T.U.C.;\r\n\r\nhe   was  the  most  acceptable  man  to  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  Lim  Ching Siong could not be  Secretary-General because his conviction was stronger than the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Kampong Kapor. But recently  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  some trouble inside the P.A.P. and the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kampong Kapor is not on the right side. He  has\r\n\r\nbeen  fighting  against  the Government,  calling  a\r\n\r\nnurses'  strike, a police strike. He wanted to  call\r\n\r\nthe midwives out on strike; the dispute was referred\r\n\r\nto  the  Arbitration Court. He has  now  called  the\r\n\r\nTamil Murasu strike and God knows what other strikes\r\n\r\nhe will call in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if these people, particularly the Member for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kapor  and  the Member for  Telok  Blangah,\r\n\r\nthink  they  can deceive the workers  by  trying  to\r\n\r\nappear  to  be more independent, and more democratic\r\n\r\nthan  Mr  Devan Nair and company, I think they  are\r\n\r\nsadly  mistaken,  because, in the first  place,  Mr\r\n\r\nDevan  Nair cannot cheat the workers and even if  he\r\n\r\nhas deceived some sections of the workers, he cannot\r\n\r\nhope  to deceive them forever. It is interesting  to\r\n\r\nnote  from  the speeches of the Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKapor and the Member for Telok Blangah that they did\r\n\r\nnot  deny  that the Government uses State  machinery\r\n\r\nagainst certain unions. The Member for Kampong Kapor\r\n\r\nwanted to know what were non-P.A.P. unions and  what\r\n\r\nwere  P.A.P. unions. But they did not deny  it  and\r\n\r\nthat is the confirmation of what we have said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the time when the Police civilian\r\n\r\npersonnel were out on strike, posters were put out\r\n\r\ncondemning the Government for using the police to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbreak  the  strike,  and all the hundred-odd  police\r\n\r\npersonnel  knew that the Government  was  trying  to\r\n\r\nbreak  the  strike  led by the  Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKapor.  That  was  because  the  A.U.P.E. was  fast\r\n\r\nceasing  to  be a P.A.P. union, and this only  gives\r\n\r\nsubstance to the contents of the motion. The  Member\r\n\r\nfor Telok Blangah said that the victimisation in the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board at the moment is not because  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  He  said  that it  is  because  of  the\r\n\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in May, when the Prime Minister started\r\n\r\ncalling  out  the  Executive  Council  members   and\r\n\r\nintimidated them in `in attempt to make them  accept\r\n\r\nhis  appointment of a Committee, there were not less\r\n\r\nthan   four   officials  of  the  Union   who   were\r\n\r\nvictimised.  We  know that the  citizenship  of  the\r\n\r\nPresident of the Union, Mr Markandu, was withdrawn;\r\n\r\nthe  Vice-President, Mr Chan Joo Tong, was  demoted\r\n\r\nand  transferred; an Executive Council  member,  Mr\r\n\r\nHan  Teng  Kwang, was also demoted and  transferred;\r\n\r\nand  two  weeks  ago, Mr Tan Kwee Tee,  who  is  an\r\n\r\nExecutive  Committee member, was dismissed.  Surely,\r\n\r\neven  if  we  leave  out all the hundreds  of  other\r\n\r\nworkers who are being and who have been consistently\r\n\r\ndemoted, transferred, suspended and dismissed, these\r\n\r\nfour  people  could  not have been  victimised  just\r\n\r\nbecause  some junior officials in the Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nfelt   like   victimising   them.   Mr   Markandu's\r\n\r\ncitizenship  was withdrawn because somebody  in  the\r\n\r\nHarbour   Board   felt  his  citizenship   must   be\r\n\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, events in the Harbour Board are conclusive\r\n\r\nproof  that the Government uses the State powers  to\r\n\r\nthe  full  to advance P.A.P. interests. Mr Markandu\r\n\r\nwas  told  quite  openly that if he did  not  behave\r\n\r\nhimself, he would be put on a boat to Ceylon on  the\r\n\r\n28th  of  this month. Perhaps, Sir, on the  28th  he\r\n\r\nwill  be  going  off.  There is no  possibility,  no\r\n\r\nmatter what the Government Members attempt to say in\r\n\r\nthis  House, to cover un the use of State  machinery\r\n\r\nin the dispute of the Harbour Board workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, the Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and the Minister for Labour have\r\n\r\nsuggested   that   the  S.A.T.U. unions   are   not\r\n\r\ninterested  in wage increases for the workers.  This\r\n\r\nis  utter nonsense, and they know this is not  true.\r\n\r\nSir,  if  they  look up the Government Gazettes  and\r\n\r\nlist  out  all the collective agreements  that  have\r\n\r\nbeen  gazetted,  they will find that the  collective\r\n\r\nagreements signed by the S.A.T.U. unions are more in\r\n\r\nnumber than those signed by the N.T.U.C. Practically\r\n\r\nevery  day, the processes of negotiations  for  wage\r\n\r\nincreases and increased benefits go on and they have\r\n\r\nnot stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I tell them this in conclusion. They accused\r\n\r\nus   of  not  looking  after  the  workers,  no  pay\r\n\r\nincreases for the workers, not being interested,  we\r\n\r\nharm  the  workers through our acts, and, therefore,\r\n\r\nthousands   and   thousands   of   workers    become\r\n\r\nunemployed.  This is a point which  has  been  made.\r\n\r\nThey say that thousands and thousands of workers are\r\n\r\nleaving the S.A.T.U. and running to the N.T.U.C.  In\r\n\r\nother  words, Mr Speaker, they are trying to  paint\r\n\r\nthis  picture  that  S.A.T.U. is  on  the  verge  of\r\n\r\ncollapse, unpopular, and if this were true, why deny\r\n\r\nus  our right to organise? If, in fact, S.A.T.U. is\r\n\r\nunpopular  because it is led by big monsters  called\r\n\r\nCommunists,  thousands of workers become unemployed,\r\n\r\nwe  use  workers as political pawns, why  are  they\r\n\r\nafraid  In allow S.A.T.U. even to call one  meeting?\r\n\r\nWe  challenged them last time to allow us to call  a\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. public rally in Hong Lim Green.  We  chose\r\n\r\nHong Lim Green particularly, because the Member  for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  recently  has been  trying  to  flex  his\r\n\r\nmuscles at us. So it would be appropriate if we hold\r\n\r\na  rally  at  Hong Lim Green. And we have challenged\r\n\r\nthe  Government. We have had no reply. Mr  Speaker.\r\n\r\nThey say that we are given democratic rights. Police\r\n\r\npermits  for  meetings are not granted!  As  far  as\r\n\r\npossible,  they try to prevent them. The publication\r\n\r\nof  the General Employees' Union, Suara Kesatuan, in\r\n\r\n3  languages is banned. The official publication  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Business  Houses  Employees'  Union,\r\n\r\nBebas, is banned. Sir, no printer in Singapore dares\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprint   the   Barisan  publication.  For   political\r\n\r\npurposes,   they  have  given  us  a   licence   but\r\n\r\nindirectly they have told the printers not to  print\r\n\r\nit. And, Sir. S.A.T.U. meetings are banned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if they want to fight the giant, let the\r\n\r\ngiant loose. It is no use talking tough inside  this\r\n\r\nChamber  when  they  have the giant  tied  down  and\r\n\r\nrestricted.  In  spite of the denial  of  democratic\r\n\r\nrights,  in spite of the use of State machinery,  in\r\n\r\nspite of all the unprincipled, unethical conduct  of\r\n\r\nthe   Government,  the  progressive  working   class\r\n\r\nmovement  continues to grow, and we have  no  doubt,\r\n\r\nwhether they register S.A.T.U. or do not register\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U., whether they lock us up, we will continue\r\n\r\nto grow in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion accordingly negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved. \"That this Assembly do now adjourn to\r\n\r\nMonday, 29th July. 1963.\" -[Mr Rajaratnam].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Fourteen minutes past Six o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Monday, 29th July, 1963.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
