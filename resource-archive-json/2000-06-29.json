First,  we  ensure\r\n\r\nthat their basic needs are met through affordable housing and\r\n\r\nhealthcare.   Second, we help equip them with  the  means  to\r\n\r\nsupport  themselves by providing heavily subsidised education\r\n\r\nand  skills  training.    Third, we  help  create  ample  job\r\n\r\nopportunities by building a strong and competitive economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach has worked well for us. Over the years,\r\n\r\nlow  income families in Singapore have seen their incomes and\r\n\r\nliving standard rise steadily, in real terms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among households in the bottom 20%, 95% own colour TV\r\n\r\nsets, 90% own telephones, and 77% own washing machines. These\r\n\r\nownership rates are better than even the national average  of\r\n\r\nall households in many developing countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our achievement in home ownership is also good. While\r\n\r\nmany  of the poor in other countries are homeless, the lowest\r\n\r\n20% of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouseholds  in Singapore are well-housed.  75%  of  them  own\r\n\r\ntheir own homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have achieved this without creating dependence or\r\n\r\nweakening  the  family, and in a way which gives  opportunity\r\n\r\nand  hope  for  the  children of low income  families  to  do\r\n\r\nbetter.  All segments of our society are thus able to benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  our economic prosperity, and this is part of the reason\r\n\r\nfor Singapore's political stability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the progress we have made, many people were\r\n\r\nsurprised and disturbed by newspaper headlines claiming  that\r\n\r\nthe  lowest 10% of our households lived on only $133 a month.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the headlines were misleading and inaccurate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Statistics had reported that, in 1999,\r\n\r\nthe  average income from work of the bottom 10% of households\r\n\r\nwas  $133 per month.  This was the statistical average.   75%\r\n\r\nof  these households had members who did not work at all  and\r\n\r\ntherefore reported zero income.  This pulled down the average\r\n\r\nincome for this group of households to $133 per month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statistical average of $133 per month in 1999 was\r\n\r\nsharply lower than the average of $258 per month in 1998. The\r\n\r\nmain  reason  was  that the proportion of households  in  the\r\n\r\nbottom  10% with no working persons went up from 62% in  1998\r\n\r\nto  75%  in  1999.   Put it another way,  the  proportion  of\r\n\r\nhouseholds with persons working fell sharply from  more  than\r\n\r\none-third (38%) to one-quarter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was partly because unemployment increased during\r\n\r\nthe regional economic crisis, and also because the number  of\r\n\r\nretiree  households  had grown. (The  proportion  of  retiree\r\n\r\nhouseholds  in the bottom 10% has risen from 27% in  1997  to\r\n\r\n32%  in  1998 and 35% in 1999*.)  [*The increase  in  retiree\r\n\r\nhouseholds  can  be attributed to (a) the ageing  population,\r\n\r\nand  (b) older workers choosing to retire due to the poor job\r\n\r\nopportunities during the economic crisis.]  Dr  Jennifer  Lee\r\n\r\nasked  whether  there  is a disproportionate  number  of  the\r\n\r\nhouseholds in the lowest-income group which are single-parent\r\n\r\nfamilies.  Single parent\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfamilies  constituted only 4.2% of households in  the  bottom\r\n\r\n10%  in 1999*.  [*Definied as households with heads who  are:\r\n\r\n(a)   single,  widowed,  divorced/separated;  and  (b)   with\r\n\r\nchildren  below  16 years of age.  The percentage  of  single\r\n\r\nparent  households in the bottom 10%, although low, is higher\r\n\r\nthan  the  national average of 1.8%.]  This  was  in  fact  a\r\n\r\nslight reduction from the 4.5% in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cushion the impact of the crisis on the lower income\r\n\r\nfamilies, the Government had provided rebates in HDB  rental,\r\n\r\nutilities and service and conservancy charges as part of  the\r\n\r\ncost  cutting package. This assistance amounted to about  $46\r\n\r\nper  month for households in HDB 1- and 2-room flats, and $36\r\n\r\nper month for those in HDB 3-room flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan has suggested that we help the bottom\r\n\r\n10%  take  up  the many better-paid unskilled jobs  that  our\r\n\r\nsmall and medium enterprises (SMEs) are trying to fill.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower (MOM) provides employment assistance, at\r\n\r\nno  charge, to unemployed Singaporeans who have  difficulties\r\n\r\nfinding  a  job,  including those  in  the  bottom  10%.   It\r\n\r\nactively  sources for job vacancies, and organises job  fairs\r\n\r\nand   outplacement  events  in  partnership  with  employers,\r\n\r\nunions, and the Community Development Councils.  SMEs seeking\r\n\r\nworkers are encouraged to register their job offers  with MOM\r\n\r\nand participate in its recruitment events.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the economy recovers and the job market improves,\r\n\r\nmore  people  in  the  bottom  10%  would  be  able  to  find\r\n\r\nemployment and the income growth of working households should\r\n\r\nresume.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the bottom 10% of households, their median CPF\r\n\r\nsavings  amounted to $20,000 in 1999.  Among them,  only  25%\r\n\r\nlive  in  1-  or 2- room HDB flats.  39% live in  HDB  3-room\r\n\r\nflats,  24%  in  4-room or larger flats and  11%  in  private\r\n\r\nproperties.  Nearly all of these are owner-occupied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, many in the bottom 10% have significant\r\n\r\nwealth, in the form of CPF savings and their homes.  They are\r\n\r\nnot an underclass.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken some time to put the Department of\r\n\r\nStatistics'  figures in context, as it is important  that  we\r\n\r\nget  a  right  picture  of the bottom 10%  income  households\r\n\r\nbefore  we  discuss how best to help them.   There  are  poor\r\n\r\nSingaporeans in our midst but the situation is not at all  as\r\n\r\nbad  as  the headlines portrayed. To help the less  well-off,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  put  in place  a  range  of  assistance\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Community Development and Sports (MCDS)\r\n\r\nhas various schemes that target the most disadvantaged in our\r\n\r\nsociety.   The  Public Assistance (PA) Scheme  provides  long\r\n\r\nterm  financial help. PA recipients also receive free medical\r\n\r\nservices   and  assistance  in-kind.  The  Interim  Financial\r\n\r\nAssistance  Scheme caters to those in need  of  shorter  term\r\n\r\nhelp, while families in rental flats can seek relief from the\r\n\r\nRental and Utilities Assistance Scheme (RUAS). There are also\r\n\r\nchild  care and student care fee assistance schemes for  low-income  families.  The Community Development Councils  (CDCs)\r\n\r\nfurther   complement  these  schemes  with  other  assistance\r\n\r\ntailored for their needy residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the children of low income families, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  (MOE)  renders  help for  their  education.  MOE's\r\n\r\nFinancial Assistance Scheme (FAS) provides needy pupils  from\r\n\r\nfamilies  receiving social assistance from MCDS a 50%  waiver\r\n\r\nof  miscellaneous  fees, full waiver of  school  fees  and  a\r\n\r\ntextbook grant or an annual bursary.  Schools can augment the\r\n\r\nassistance  through the School Advisory Committee  or  School\r\n\r\nManagement Committee Fund.  Children from low-income families\r\n\r\nwho  perform  well are also awarded Edusave Merit  Bursaries.\r\n\r\nMany  charitable  foundations  and  grassroots  organisations\r\n\r\nprovide supplementary support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of healthcare, the Ministry of Health (MOH)\r\n\r\nensures that healthcare remains affordable and accessible  to\r\n\r\nall,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincluding  the  poor.   Class  C wards  are  subsidised  80%.\r\n\r\nPatients  facing difficulty in paying their healthcare  bills\r\n\r\nare assisted by the Medifund scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government also funds 90% of the\r\n\r\ncapital  expenditure and 50% of the recurrent expenditure  of\r\n\r\napproved  projects by social service agencies.  This  enables\r\n\r\ncommunity organisations to provide a support system, such  as\r\n\r\ncounselling services or simple financial budgeting  guidance,\r\n\r\nfor  families in need which go beyond just dollars and cents.\r\n\r\nTogether with the National Council of Social Service, MCDS is\r\n\r\nalso  encouraging  more  corporations to  sponsor  assistance\r\n\r\nprogrammes for the less fortunate.  This `many helping hands'\r\n\r\napproach  enables us to create a strong basic  social  safety\r\n\r\nnet for the poor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, the bigger concern to us is the widening\r\n\r\nincome  gap  between the bottom and top earners. The  average\r\n\r\nincome ratio of the top 20% to the bottom 20% households  has\r\n\r\nincreased  from  13.6 times in 1997 to 17.9  times  in  1999.\r\n\r\nThis  was  partly because the impact of the recent  recession\r\n\r\nwas  much harder on the lower income households than  on  the\r\n\r\nhigher  income  households. However, it  is  also  likely  to\r\n\r\nindicate a longer-term structural trend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With globalisation, there is now a global market for\r\n\r\nlabour.    At   the   top,   scarce  talents   command   high\r\n\r\ninternational wages while, at the bottom, the wages earned by\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  unskilled  come  under  increasing  downward\r\n\r\npressure  from  the hundreds of millions in the  Third  World\r\n\r\njoining  the  global market who are prepared to  work  for  a\r\n\r\npittance.   This  is a worldwide trend which  our  system  of\r\n\r\nforeign worker levies ameliorate only to a point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, the ratio of average income of the top 20% to\r\n\r\nbottom 20% increased\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  12.2  in 1988 to 13.7 in 1998.  According to  a  recent\r\n\r\nreport in the International Herald Tribune, the income gap in\r\n\r\nthe  US  is  now  at its widest since data was  collected  in\r\n\r\n1977*,  [*Study by the Center on Budget and Policy  Priorities\r\n\r\nwas  based on after-tax income figures from the Congressional\r\n\r\nBudget  Office.   Source: IHT, 6 September 1999.]   with  the\r\n\r\nratio of top executives' to factory workers' pay increased 10-fold from 42 times in 1980, to 419 times in 1998*.  [*By  the\r\n\r\nInstitute  for Policy Studies and United for a Fair  Economy.\r\n\r\nSource:  IHT, 6 September 1999.]   Even in Japan,  which  has\r\n\r\nlong  been  regarded as one of the world's  most  egalitarian\r\n\r\nindustrialized nations, the gap between the rich and poor  is\r\n\r\nwidening*.  [*Source: IHT, 5 January 2000.]  We can expect the\r\n\r\nsame to happen in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should be our response? First, we must make sure\r\n\r\nthat the incomes of those at the bottom continue to rise.  We\r\n\r\ncan  only  achieve  this  if our economy  continues  to  grow\r\n\r\nhealthily.   For  the  majority of  low-income  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nespecially older and less educated workers, skills  upgrading\r\n\r\nis  the  key  to  enhancing  employability  and  income.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower has therefore worked with employers  and\r\n\r\nunions  to  launch the Skills Redevelopment Programme  (SRP).\r\n\r\nUnder  the SRP, generous grants covering up to 100% of course\r\n\r\nfees  and  85%  of  absentee payroll  are  provided  for  the\r\n\r\ntraining  of less educated workers aged 40 years  and  above.\r\n\r\nThe  target is to upgrade the skills of some 100,000  workers\r\n\r\nthrough this programme by the year 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Ministry of Manpower is working with\r\n\r\nother   Government   economic  agencies  and   employers   to\r\n\r\nprofessionalise  jobs in domestic-based industries  with  low\r\n\r\nproductivity such as cleaning, construction and retail.   The\r\n\r\naim is to upgrade these jobs to achieve higher skill content,\r\n\r\nand facilitate the training or retraining of workers in these\r\n\r\nindustries. With improved productivity, these industries  can\r\n\r\nthen provide more viable job opportunities for local workers,\r\n\r\nincluding   those   displaced  as  a   result   of   economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring.   To support the various manpower  development\r\n\r\ninitiatives, the Government has set aside $200 million\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor the Manpower Development Assistance Scheme to co-fund the\r\n\r\nprojects with industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we must continue to ensure that lower income\r\n\r\nfamilies  have  the means and opportunities to  move  up  the\r\n\r\neconomic and social ladder.  That is to say, we must have  as\r\n\r\nlittle   friction   as  possible  to  social   mobility   and\r\n\r\nprogression.   Here,  our education system  plays  a  crucial\r\n\r\nrole.   We  must give every child the best education possible\r\n\r\nand  prepare him for the needs of the New Economy.   This  is\r\n\r\nwhy  we  have always given the highest emphasis to education.\r\n\r\nFor  every  cohort, we are targeting 25% to have a university\r\n\r\neducation,  40% to have a polytechnic education  and  another\r\n\r\n25% to have an ITE education.  We make sure that the children\r\n\r\nof  poor  families are not disadvantaged.  MOE, MCDS and  the\r\n\r\nCDCs help them financially so that no child is prevented from\r\n\r\nbeing  educated  to  the limit of his potential  because  his\r\n\r\nparents are poor, sick or unemployed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has pointed out, our\r\n\r\nbasic  approach is to level up.  The more economic growth  we\r\n\r\nhave, the more we will be able to level upwards.  The key  is\r\n\r\na healthy Singapore economy that is globally competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our social safety net sets a good minimum standard of\r\n\r\nliving  for the least well-off Singaporeans.  This undergirds\r\n\r\nour  sense  of  community solidarity.  Beyond that,  we  must\r\n\r\nalways  give  hope to those at the bottom that even  if  they\r\n\r\nthemselves cannot do better, their children will be able  to.\r\n\r\nAt  all  times,  our system must incentivise  effort,  family\r\n\r\nsupport and self-help.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether there will\r\n\r\nbe  newer incentives, apart from those mentioned earlier,  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate low-paid and low-skilled workers to go for further\r\n\r\ntraining so that they can earn more wages?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> These are on-going programmes.\r\n\r\nWe have allocated funds for them.

For  example, would  the  Minister  review  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  prohibiting the sale of cooked food  prepared  in\r\n\r\nhomes?   Would  the  Minister consider reinstating  the  past\r\n\r\npolicy of allocating hawker stalls and school tuckshop stalls\r\n\r\nto  deserving  applicants instead of tendering  them  to  the\r\n\r\nhighest bidders?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are some of the traditional ways in which the\r\n\r\npoor  could improve their financial situation but today  they\r\n\r\nare no longer available because of Government policies. Would\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  also  review HDB's policy  of  not  permitting\r\n\r\nsecond-time direct purchases from HDB if the second  unit  is\r\n\r\nof a lower category from the first even though both purchases\r\n\r\ncould  be within HDB's general policy of two direct purchases\r\n\r\nfrom HDB?

Some of the issues are not new issues,\r\n\r\nlike  whether we should allow cooked food to be  prepared  in\r\n\r\nHDB  households. There are, of course, conflicting objectives\r\n\r\nbecause  there  are externalities involved.   The  smoke  may\r\n\r\ncause  annoyance to neighbours and we should strike a  proper\r\n\r\nbalance   between  allowing  for  flexibility   of   resource\r\n\r\nallocation   and  not  causing  inconveniences  or   negative\r\n\r\nexternalities to people around.

His particular  suggestions\r\n\r\nwill  be  forwarded  to  the  various  Ministries  for  their\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether the\r\n\r\nwidening  of  income  gap in Singapore is definitely  getting\r\n\r\nworse  and  whether  this  will jeopardize  social  cohesion,\r\n\r\nsocial stability and other related issues here?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The most common index used by\r\n\r\ncountries  to  measure  inequality  of  income  is  the  gini\r\n\r\ncoefficient and the higher it is, the greater the inequality.\r\n\r\nFor   many  years,  before  the  economic  crisis,  our  gini\r\n\r\ncoefficient has improved and then flattened out.  During  the\r\n\r\ncrisis  year  of  1998,  it went up. So  we  asked  ourselves\r\n\r\nwhether this was just the result of the economic crisis which\r\n\r\nhit  those  at  the bottom disproportionately or  whether  it\r\n\r\nrepresented  a trend break.  We have been studying  the  gini\r\n\r\ncoefficient in advanced countries in the US, the OECD and  so\r\n\r\non,  and  we  have  noted that in these countries,  the  gini\r\n\r\ncoefficient has tended to worsen. So we ask ourselves:   what\r\n\r\nis the likely tendency in the future?  I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink we have worsened because of globalisation.  The top  in\r\n\r\nour   social   ladder  would  command  international   wages,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  growth sectors where  talents  are  scarce.\r\n\r\nMany  of  our  hotshot  dot.com types  now  command  fabulous\r\n\r\nsalaries  or incomes because of the recent boom.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  bubble  has  punctured  the boom  somewhat  but,  still,\r\n\r\nrelative to many other sectors, they have done very well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are those who are unskilled and,\r\n\r\nincreasingly, they are competing with the unskilled in China,\r\n\r\nVietnam,  Indonesia and India. With the end of the Cold  War,\r\n\r\nthese  countries are opening up and hundreds of  millions  of\r\n\r\npeople  are entering the workplace.  In the past,  when  they\r\n\r\nlived  in  remote  villages, they could not  compete  in  the\r\n\r\nglobal    market.    Now,    with    better    communication,\r\n\r\ntransportation,  Internet and e-commerce, more  and  more  of\r\n\r\nthem are entering the global market and this has a depressing\r\n\r\neffect  on the wages which unskilled labour in Singapore  can\r\n\r\ncommand.  Of course, in the services sector, they tend to  be\r\n\r\nprotected.   But  even  in  the  services  sector,  with  the\r\n\r\nglobalisation trends, more and more segments in the  services\r\n\r\nsector are being opened up to global competitive pressure and\r\n\r\nit  is in our own interest to open up the services sector  to\r\n\r\ninternational competition because it lowers the cost of doing\r\n\r\nbusiness in Singapore and helps make the tradable sector more\r\n\r\ncompetitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the worsening of the gini coefficient continue\r\n\r\nforever?   I  think  in  the  end,  it  will  find  its   own\r\n\r\nequilibrium.  When a new frontier is opened,  there  are  the\r\n\r\nrobber  barons,  there are those who have  struck  gold,  and\r\n\r\nthere  are  those who are left penurious, so the  coefficient\r\n\r\ntends  to  widen.  But after a while, stability will  resume.\r\n\r\nThose  who are at the bottom will catch up, those who are  at\r\n\r\nthe  top  will find that temporary scarcity is met by growing\r\n\r\nsupply,  and so the trend may reverse itself years  down  the\r\n\r\nroad.  But when that will take place, we do not know  because\r\n\r\nthe  economic  changes  taking  the  world  today  are  truly\r\n\r\nrevolutionary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> The Minister mentioned\r\n\r\nthe Government's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntarget  to upgrade 100,000 less-educated workers by 2003.

And will the Government consider providing\r\n\r\na  living allowance to these workers who are prepared  to  go\r\n\r\nfor  training?   The  other question  is:   in  view  of  the\r\n\r\nwidening income gap, will the Government review the benchmark\r\n\r\nfor  affordability  in  terms of  HDB  flats  and  healthcare\r\n\r\nservices?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The Skills Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme covers a wide range of retraining courses.   It  is\r\n\r\ntrue that among the older workers, some find it hard even  to\r\n\r\nget  themselves retrained in these courses.  But we have  had\r\n\r\nsome very good successes of workers going for retraining  and\r\n\r\nfinding good jobs in growth sectors of the economy. Take, for\r\n\r\ninstance, our disk-drive industry which has shed thousands of\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the last two years.  Many of these  workers  had\r\n\r\nsince  been  redeployed to other industry sectors.   Many  of\r\n\r\nthem are still in the electronics sector where we enjoy rapid\r\n\r\ngrowth   in  the  components,  in  the  computer,   and   the\r\n\r\ncommunication  segments.  We  do  provide  salary  assistance\r\n\r\nthrough Government subsidy of absentee payroll.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we should, from time to time, review what\r\n\r\nconstitutes  a minimum safety net in Singapore,  I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould,  because  this  is what it means  to  be  part  of  a\r\n\r\ncommunity, that those at the bottom enjoy a minimum  standard\r\n\r\nwhich is commensurate with the average living standard in our\r\n\r\nsociety as a whole so that the inequalities are not so  gross\r\n\r\nas to cause social discord and disruption.  If we look at the\r\n\r\nbottom 10% in Singapore and compare them to the bottom 10% in\r\n\r\nany  other major city in the world, whether it is London, New\r\n\r\nYork, Berlin, Tokyo or Hong Kong, I do not think we have done\r\n\r\ntoo badly.  We should not measure a city by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhow  its  top 10% live.  Because they can live very well;  in\r\n\r\nHong  Kong,  they drive Rolls Royces, in New York,  it  is  a\r\n\r\nlifestyle  which  many  of us can only imagine  or  fantasize\r\n\r\nabout.   But judge a city by how it looks after those at  the\r\n\r\nbottom, its most downtrodden.

So I am asking the Government  whether  it\r\n\r\nwants  to  tackle the problem at its source by  changing  the\r\n\r\neducation  system to make it more flexible to cater  for  the\r\n\r\nslow learners.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Chiam for his\r\n\r\ncomments.  He is right that the root problem is education. If\r\n\r\nwe look at Singaporeans above the age of 40, less than one in\r\n\r\ntwo  have  more than six years of education.   When  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment came into power, we introduced mass education  and\r\n\r\nthe  result has been a sharply increased educational  profile\r\n\r\nof the population. Our educational profile of those above the\r\n\r\nage  of 40 is basically a third-world educational profile and\r\n\r\nmany  of them will continue to be with us for a long time  to\r\n\r\ncome.  We  have  got  to find ways and means  to  help  them,\r\n\r\nretrain  them, upgrade their skills, and so on.  Among  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  younger, aged 35 and below, our educational profile\r\n\r\nis  first-class  and many of the good things which  Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\ntalked about are precisely the elements which are built  into\r\n\r\nour  educational  system of providing for slow  learners,  or\r\n\r\ngoing faster for fast learners, and so on.  If you go to  our\r\n\r\nuniversities, polytechnics and even our ITEs today, the level\r\n\r\nof  equipment, the facilities which are available to students\r\n\r\nare  something unimaginable 10-20 years ago, and this attests\r\n\r\nto the emphasis this Government has put on education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The younger ones, we can solve.

You\r\n\r\ncannot  train  them,  you  cannot  increase  their  level  of\r\n\r\neducation,  can  you perhaps help them to get jobs  elsewhere\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I would not say that they\r\n\r\ncannot  be  trained  or upgraded.

We try to protect the  wage\r\n\r\nlevels in Singapore through the workers' levy.  Imagine if we\r\n\r\nhad  no work permit system in Singapore and no workers' levy,\r\n\r\nthen millions will want to come to Singapore and wages at the\r\n\r\nbottom  will be greatly depressed.  This will cause not  only\r\n\r\nsocial  problems  but  it will also  lead  to  a  Singaporean\r\n\r\nunderclass which would be a political problem.  So we try  to\r\n\r\nstrike  a balance between protecting those at the bottom  and\r\n\r\nnot  allowing  this protection to be such  a  weight  on  the\r\n\r\noverall competitiveness of our economy.

By this, what I mean is that instead  of\r\n\r\nsearching  only for higher value high technology  investments\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  should we look for reasonable wage  companies\r\n\r\nand industries that will keep the bulk of jobs in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the first\r\n\r\nquestion,  in  1999, 75% of the bottom 10% of households  did\r\n\r\nnot have a working member.  Among the households that had  at\r\n\r\nleast  one  income earner, the average household  income  was\r\n\r\n$530 per month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also asked a broader question about our economic\r\n\r\nstrategy,  ie, whether we should not deliberately nurture  an\r\n\r\nindustry sector to cater to these people.  Let us say that we\r\n\r\ncreate  such  a  sector.  Can we ever  bring  our  costs  low\r\n\r\nenough,  say,  in disk drives, to compete with Malaysia,  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines or China?  I think that is an impossible game and\r\n\r\na  fool's  game, because in these countries, there  are  many\r\n\r\nmore  willing  to  work at even lower wages.   So  this  will\r\n\r\nresult  in  our  economy being constantly pulled  down.   Our\r\n\r\nstrategy  is  to move upstream.  When we have   R&D  centres,\r\n\r\nwafer  fabs, pharmaceutical companies and petrochemical works\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  there are people at the  top  who  earn  high\r\n\r\nsalaries  because their skills are very scarce in the  world.\r\n\r\nBut  for each of these individuals that we have in our midst,\r\n\r\nthey  bring  work and opportunities to many other people  who\r\n\r\nservice   them,  who  maintain  the  plants,   who   do   the\r\n\r\nlandscaping,   who  provide  the  food,   who   provide   the\r\n\r\ntransportation and personal services.  So it  is  far  better\r\n\r\nfor us to move upstream, which is  higher value added and for\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have  a competitive advantage and use  these  high\r\n\r\npoints to raise the general level of the tent.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a paradox in economics that, sometimes to have\r\n\r\ngreater  growth,  we  must accept a widening  of  inequality,\r\n\r\nbecause  without that higher point for the tent, it  is  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  raise the whole skirt.  From the viewpoint  of\r\n\r\nour  economic  strategy, we are targeting  high  value  added\r\n\r\nindustries  for  which we have a clear competitive  advantage\r\n\r\nand rely upon these centres of growth to bring employment and\r\n\r\nadvantage to ordinary Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member): Sir,\r\n\r\nwill  the  Minister  consider  setting  up  a  crisis  credit\r\n\r\nfacility  to help the 10% through these difficult  times  and\r\n\r\nallow them to pay back on very low interest terms?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, there are many ways that\r\n\r\nwe  can use to redistribute income to those who are less well\r\n\r\noff.   The  most  important thing is to have welfare  without\r\n\r\nwelfarism  and to achieve redistribution without  it  somehow\r\n\r\ndisincentivising effort or self-help.  If there are  projects\r\n\r\nwhich are low risk to justify the low interest rates, I think\r\n\r\nthe market will attend to them.  As far as the Government  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  we  provide direct assistance through  affordable\r\n\r\nHDB  mortgages, through subsidies on service and  conservancy\r\n\r\ncharges,  through MediFund, through subsidy of C class  wards\r\n\r\nand  polyclinics,  through  education  facilities  which  are\r\n\r\ncompletely  affordable  all the way  up  to  ITE  and  junior\r\n\r\ncollege.  There are many ways to cause a redistribution.   We\r\n\r\nshould   choose  the  ways  which  encourage  effort,   which\r\n\r\nincreases the productive capacity and capability of those  at\r\n\r\nthe  bottom.

However,  if  these\r\n\r\npeople  are  unwilling to do unskilled work, then  would  the\r\n\r\nGovernment reconsider the rigid rules which apply to  foreign\r\n\r\nlabour, so that our SMEs will be able to meet their immediate\r\n\r\ndemands and take care of their requirements?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Tay for raising\r\n\r\nthis  point.   It is an important point because the  feedback\r\n\r\nfrom  industries is that the labour market is tightening very\r\n\r\nrapidly with the end of the economic recession.  We have,  on\r\n\r\nthe  one hand, a group of unemployed who cannot seem to  find\r\n\r\nemployment and, on the other hand, a great demand for workers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincluding  unskilled workers.  Part of the reason is  because\r\n\r\nsome  of  those who are unemployed are deterred by having  to\r\n\r\nwork  third shifts or having to travel further to work.   And\r\n\r\nthe  fact that they are able to express these preferences  is\r\n\r\nbecause  one  way or another, they are able to make  do  with\r\n\r\ncontributions from family members or from their own  savings.\r\n\r\nIf  the hardship were very acute, then even third shift  work\r\n\r\nor even work in Tuas would be snapped up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay's other question is one which concerns us more in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It is the rapidly tightening labour  market  and\r\n\r\nhow  we should adjust our manpower policies in order to  feed\r\n\r\nthe  growth  that  is in our economy.  I do  not  think  that\r\n\r\nworking  the  old method is the right way to go, particularly\r\n\r\nfor  SMEs.  Because of the Internet and e-commerce, middlemen\r\n\r\nare  being weeded out in many industry sectors.  So those who\r\n\r\nrequire foreign workers to do work the old way may find  that\r\n\r\na difficult approach to take.  Some restructuring is required\r\n\r\nbut,  at  the same time, we recognise that in the SME  sector\r\n\r\nthere  is a need for a greater allocation of foreign  workers\r\n\r\nand  we  review these allocations all the time, and  feedback\r\n\r\nfrom  SMEs,  from  Mr  Tay Beng Chuan and  from  the  various\r\n\r\nbusiness  chambers and associations will be very  helpful  to\r\n\r\nthe Government Ministries involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S.

With  the\r\n\r\nrelocation of the labour intensive industries, is the problem\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be  aggravated?  What  concrete  steps  will  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  be taking besides retraining to assist these  older\r\n\r\nworkers?  At the same time, I would like to find out  whether\r\n\r\nthere  is  a mismatch between the manpower that is available,\r\n\r\nthe  older workers, and the jobs that are out in the  market.\r\n\r\nIf  this  is  the  case, could we take  a  better  integrated\r\n\r\napproach  in trying to follow through these workers  who  are\r\n\r\nunable to be deployed for employment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, there is a limit to what\r\n\r\nwe can do to bring down\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  unemployment rate without causing economic  inefficiency\r\n\r\nto  the  system as a whole.

The  issue is being reviewed by all Ministries  to\r\n\r\nsee  how  we can bring work closer to them so that  they  can\r\n\r\nspend  part  of their time looking after their grandchildren,\r\n\r\npart  of  their time attending to their own household affairs\r\n\r\nand, maybe when they are free, doing some part-time work.  In\r\n\r\nthe old days, we used to separate out industrial estates from\r\n\r\nhousing areas because they were polluting, they needed  space\r\n\r\nand  heavy  equipment was involved.  But in the new  economy,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  many industries which do  not  require  this\r\n\r\ngenerous  allocation  of spaces, and  which  can  be  brought\r\n\r\ncloser   to  housing  estates  and  therefore  within  easier\r\n\r\ncommuting  distances.

When I was in Davos  at  the  WEF\r\n\r\nMeeting  in  January this year, they had one  session  called\r\n\r\n\"The  Age  of Disloyalty\", that with globalisation  and  with\r\n\r\ninternational talents becoming mobile, are we all linked only\r\n\r\nby  money  and  nothing else?  Is there such a  thing  called\r\n\r\n\"patriotism\"  or  \"loyalty\" left to corporations,  tribes  or\r\n\r\ncharities?  Because we are a cosmopolitan city and our  young\r\n\r\nare all educated in English, they are internationally mobile.\r\n\r\nWhile we tell\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nourselves  that  we  should be in  the  game,  bring  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents to Singapore, we are also in danger of losing our own\r\n\r\ntalents  to  other  countries  and  even  when  they  are  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, are they loyal to Singapore?  This is the question\r\n\r\nwhich concerns us a lot because, in a crisis, whether or  not\r\n\r\nwe  have  this sense of solidarity makes a difference between\r\n\r\nsuccess  and failure, between life and death, between victory\r\n\r\nand  defeat.  So national service will remain important.  Our\r\n\r\nwillingness  to look after those who are weak,  subnormal  or\r\n\r\ncrippled in our midst is very important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one reason why the Government has been very\r\n\r\ncareful   to   avoid  subsidising  charities   or   self-help\r\n\r\norganisations    completely    without    requiring     these\r\n\r\norganisations  to  also raise their own money.   The  widow's\r\n\r\nmite  is  very important.  Without that fund raising  effort,\r\n\r\nthere will be no ownership of schools, hospitals or community\r\n\r\norganisations.   Many of us complain that we  are  constantly\r\n\r\nbeing  roped in for fund raising, but all the effort in  fund\r\n\r\nraising is actually a process of social bonding.  We help  to\r\n\r\nbuild  that  community centre or that church or that  mosque,\r\n\r\nand  that  creates a sense of ownership and of rootedness  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National service requires all Singaporeans, whether\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  at  the  top  or  at  the  bottom,  to  feel\r\n\r\ncollectively that when it comes to a crisis, we must all work\r\n\r\ntogether for the common survival of the state.  But  this  is\r\n\r\nnot   a  question  which  can  be  easily  answered  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. The Government can do its part.  All of  us  have\r\n\r\nto do our part as parents, as teachers, as community leaders,\r\n\r\nthat while we adjust to market developments, we do not forget\r\n\r\nthat in the end what holds the community together is not just\r\n\r\nmoney,  but  a  sense of solidarity and  a  sense  of  common\r\n\r\ndestiny.  That we must always have in Singapore.  We can have\r\n\r\nforeigners to help us, we can have foreign talents coming  in\r\n\r\nto  supplement  various positions, but at the core,  we  must\r\n\r\nhave a group of people who feel completely Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> I would like to seek a point\r\n\r\nof clarification with the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister.

Is that a\r\n\r\ngood idea?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the Minister earlier did not answer my\r\n\r\nquestion  on  the  effect  of  social  cohesion  and   social\r\n\r\nstability should the gini coefficient gets worse.  May I also\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister whether more incentives could be given  to\r\n\r\nemployers  to ameliorate their bias on hiring older  workers,\r\n\r\nfor example, giving more tax rebates to such employers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did spend\r\n\r\nsome  time  talking about why it is important  to  provide  a\r\n\r\nsufficient  social  safety  net at  the  bottom  to  maintain\r\n\r\ncommunity solidarity  and social cohesion in a society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we should subsidise employers to take on\r\n\r\nolder  workers,  again we have got to ask  ourselves  whether\r\n\r\nthis  is  the  best way of achieving our objective.   It  may\r\n\r\ncreate distortion and game playing and may be quite difficult\r\n\r\nto  police  because  some of the older  employees  should  be\r\n\r\nemployed  in  their own rights.

If  this lower income group of people  does  not\r\n\r\nlike  to  take up these jobs and yet, on the other hand,  our\r\n\r\ntight  rigid labour policies  do not allow us to employ  more\r\n\r\nforeign unskilled workers, can the Minister advise us what we\r\n\r\nshould do?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, Mr Tay has raised a\r\n\r\nquestion  for  which  there is no easy answer.   Ideally,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  should  just open the doors  and  bring  in  the\r\n\r\nforeign workers and all SMEs will be happy.  But if we  bring\r\n\r\nin  foreign workers in unlimited numbers, then the  wages  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans at the bottom will be very depressed.  That  may\r\n\r\nbe  good  for those who are high income earners because  then\r\n\r\nthey can get many services on the cheap.  But is it good  for\r\n\r\nSingapore?   We  already have, out of a  population  of  four\r\n\r\nmillion, one million who are non-citizens.  How many more can\r\n\r\nwe  accommodate in our midst who are not one of us?  So there\r\n\r\nhas  got to  be a limit.  And within this limit, we have  got\r\n\r\nto  ask  ourselves how we should allocate the numbers between\r\n\r\nthose  who  work in the high-tech, financial, pharmaceutical,\r\n\r\npetrochemical and  wafer fab sectors  and those who  work  in\r\n\r\ncoffee shops and restaurants.  MTI's policy has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalways been that where we can upgrade we must try to upgrade,\r\n\r\nmechanise, automate, sub-contract.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the knowledge economy, more and more middlemen would\r\n\r\nbe  bypassed.  Should we slow down this process or should  we\r\n\r\naccelerate  it?  If we do not facilitate this transformation,\r\n\r\nthe  difficulties  would  be more difficult  for  us  further\r\n\r\ndownstream.   It is better that we go with the flow.   Today,\r\n\r\nwe  can  order  groceries on the Internet  and  it  would  be\r\n\r\ndelivered  to you the following day, eggs, vegetables,  meat,\r\n\r\nwhatever.

We  shifted gear to weather the storm.  We  reduced\r\n\r\nbusiness  costs  by  cutting Government  charges  and  taxes,\r\n\r\nreducing  CPF  contributions, and exercising wage  restraint.\r\n\r\nThis  helped  companies  to remain viable,  saved  jobs,  and\r\n\r\nprevented our economy from crashing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the crisis has passed, and the Singapore economy is\r\n\r\ngrowing   strongly  again.   We  are  benefiting   from   the\r\n\r\nsacrifices and cohesion of Singaporeans, who worked  together\r\n\r\nto  cut  costs,  accept  the  CPF  reduction,  and  keep  our\r\n\r\nindustries  competitive.  We made healthy growth of  5.4%  in\r\n\r\n1999.  This year, MTI has announced 9.1% growth for the first\r\n\r\nquarter, and has raised the growth forecast for the  year  to\r\n\r\n5.5% to 7.5%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quick recovery has caused the labour market to\r\n\r\ntighten.   Retrenchments dropped by almost half, from  29,100\r\n\r\nin  1998 to 14,600 in 1999.  Seasonally adjusted unemployment\r\n\r\nfell  from a high of 4.3% in December 1998 to 3.4%  in  March\r\n\r\nthis  year.   Total employment rose by 39,900 in 1999,  after\r\n\r\ndeclining by 23,400 in 1998.  Private sector wages are  going\r\n\r\nup, in some cases sharply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global backdrop to these developments in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  in the region is the ferment of the New Economy and  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  globalisation.   These  have  proceeded   apace,\r\n\r\nregardless  of  the problems in Asia.  The IT revolution  has\r\n\r\ndramatically changed the global economic landscape.   It  has\r\n\r\nunleashed  tremendous  dynamism, especially  in  the  US,  by\r\n\r\nraising productivity, opening up entirely new businesses, and\r\n\r\nrevolutionising   existing   ways   of   doing    businesses.\r\n\r\nUnderlying   the  dot-com  fever,  a  real  and  far-reaching\r\n\r\ntransformation is taking place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spectacular success of companies like Microsoft and\r\n\r\nCISCO Systems, based on sheer brainpower rather than tangible\r\n\r\nassets,  has attracted enterprising and ambitious  people  to\r\n\r\nstart new ventures in the knowledge sector.  The new economy\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis a powerful magnet to draw talent, especially young talent,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  old  economy.  These young people  have  a  strong\r\n\r\ndesire  to be part of the IT revolution, to change the world,\r\n\r\nand of course to make it big.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, investment banks and law firms have\r\n\r\ntraditionally been the most sought after employers,  offering\r\n\r\nthe  best  paid  jobs.   Now,  investment  banks  are  facing\r\n\r\ndifficulties  hiring graduates from business  schools,  which\r\n\r\nare  their traditional source of recruits.  And law firms are\r\n\r\nhaving  to increase their pay of junior lawyers, even at  the\r\n\r\nexpense  of  the earnings of senior partners, to  stop  their\r\n\r\njunior lawyers from leaving and joining dot-coms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation has created a single world market for\r\n\r\ntalent.   Today,  talent is highly mobile,  in  great  demand\r\n\r\neverywhere, and commands a world price.  Countries  all  over\r\n\r\nthe  world have opened their doors to talent.  Silicon Valley\r\n\r\nis  full  of  Asians,  including  a  few  Singaporeans.   The\r\n\r\nalternative to a job in one country is not another job in the\r\n\r\nsame country, but a job nearly anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, too, we are feeling the impact of these\r\n\r\ntrends.   More Singaporeans in the private sector are  taking\r\n\r\nup  opportunities abroad, and more civil servants are leaving\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  join  the private  sector.   Singaporean\r\n\r\nstudents  in  the  US  are  being  head-hunted  before   they\r\n\r\ngraduate.   The head-hunters say, \"Come, join me.   Here's  a\r\n\r\nsign-on  bonus and a BMW, before you start work.\"  The  Legal\r\n\r\nService  is losing lawyers to local law firms as well  as  to\r\n\r\nforeign  ones.  And British recruiters have come to Singapore\r\n\r\nto hire our nurses to work in England.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans sense the opportunity, and the excitement\r\n\r\nof  the IT revolution.  Enterprising and ambitious people are\r\n\r\ntaking  the  plunge,  and starting new companies.   Some  are\r\n\r\nsenior  executives who have left the security of their  well-paying jobs to venture into the New Economy.  But many others\r\n\r\nare young Singaporeans, hoping to become not just\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  next  Sim Wong Hoo, but the next Bill Gates.  This  year\r\n\r\nalone,  eight Administrative Officers have already  resigned,\r\n\r\nof  whom  three left to join start-ups.  And these  are  good\r\n\r\nofficers.  But they are convinced that they are witnessing  a\r\n\r\nrevolution.  They want to be part of this revolution, so that\r\n\r\nwhen they look back later, perhaps in their old age, they can\r\n\r\nsay, \"Yes, we tried\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These developments pose new challenges to Singapore, and\r\n\r\nparticularly to the public sector.  Recruiting and  retaining\r\n\r\ntalent is vital to the civil service, as it is to any private\r\n\r\nsector  company.   But  with  the economic  pick-up  and  the\r\n\r\npowerful  forces  of  globalisation and  the  IT  revolution,\r\n\r\nattracting  and retaining talent is quickly becoming  a  real\r\n\r\nproblem across the whole civil service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has to respond promptly, to adjust and\r\n\r\nadapt  to  the  new labour market and operating  environment.\r\n\r\nThis  involves  changing  not just   salaries  and  terms  of\r\n\r\nservice,  but  also  the way we incentivise  and  reward  our\r\n\r\nofficers,  and  even  more  fundamentally,  our  approach  to\r\n\r\nmanaging the flow of talent in the public sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector has thrived in the past by reshaping\r\n\r\nitself to cope with a changing environment.  It must continue\r\n\r\nto  re-invent itself, faster than before, to stay  up-to-date\r\n\r\nand  relevant.   The civil service needs to offer  attractive\r\n\r\nand  challenging  prospects, to induce young Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\ntake up a public sector career.  We have kept salaries in the\r\n\r\npublic  sector competitive, and we will continue  to  do  so.\r\n\r\nHowever, we need to approximate not just private sector  pay,\r\n\r\nbut   also   relevant  private  sector  personnel  management\r\n\r\npractices.   This  is particularly so for the  Administrative\r\n\r\nService, which is our main avenue for managing and developing\r\n\r\nleadership in the public sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I will brief the House on the following changes:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A new approach to managing public sector leadership\r\n\r\ntalent;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Civil service salary revisions and this year's NWC\r\n\r\naward for civil servants;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Review of salary benchmarks for the Administrative\r\n\r\nService, Political and Statutory Appointment holders; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Restructuring salaries for the Administrative\r\n\r\nService, Political and Statutory Appointment holders.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Managing Public Sector Leadership Talent</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first, cover managing public sector leadership\r\n\r\ntalent.  The Administrative Service is the premier service in\r\n\r\nthe  public sector.  Administrative Officers occupy key posts\r\n\r\nin  the  ministries,  helping to formulate  policies  and  to\r\n\r\nsupervise  the  running of ministries and  departments.   The\r\n\r\nmost  senior and critical civil service appointments  in  the\r\n\r\nministries  are  mostly occupied by Administrative  Officers.\r\n\r\nThese  appointments include the Permanent Secretaries, Deputy\r\n\r\nSecretaries, CEOs of major statutory boards and the heads  of\r\n\r\nkey  departments, in other words, the top ministries and some\r\n\r\nof  the  posts one level below the top.  We term them \"Public\r\n\r\nService Leadership (PSL)\" jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying and developing officers for these PSL jobs\r\n\r\nis  vital.  Each year, the Government has sought to garner  a\r\n\r\nfair  share  of top talent from the new cohort  to  join  the\r\n\r\nAdministrative  Service.   We  hope  that  from  among  them,\r\n\r\nsufficient  numbers will stay in service and eventually  make\r\n\r\nthe grade to fill the PSL positions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, officers appointed to PSL positions\r\n\r\nexpected  to  stay on in these positions until they  retired.\r\n\r\nHowever,  this  is  no  longer viable  for  several  reasons.\r\n\r\nFirstly, young officers nowadays do not think in terms  of  a\r\n\r\nlifetime  career  in  the civil service, gradually  advancing\r\n\r\nthrough the ranks till they reach their top posts a few years\r\n\r\nbefore retiring to draw pension.  They see a job in the civil\r\n\r\nservice as just one of several steps toward fulfilling  their\r\n\r\nlifetime   career  aspirations.   They  are   energetic   and\r\n\r\nambitious.  They want a faster sense of progression, and  the\r\n\r\nchance    to    take   on   larger   and   more   challenging\r\n\r\nresponsibilities earlier in life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we need to advance officers to Public Service\r\n\r\nLeadership jobs early,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npreferably  by  their early 40s, to keep  leadership  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector  young and vigorous.  In the  private  sector,\r\n\r\nprofessionals and executives can expect to reach the peak  of\r\n\r\ntheir  careers by their 40s or early 50s.  So a  model  where\r\n\r\nyou  mark time, or as they say hentak kaki, until you are 55,\r\n\r\nthen  you reach your top job, you serve for a few years,  you\r\n\r\ngo into retirement, play golf, is not one which will work for\r\n\r\nus or which will attract the young people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, not all officers appointed to PSL posts in\r\n\r\ntheir early 40s can realistically stay on in these posts  for\r\n\r\n20-odd years until retirement.  We need adequate turnover  in\r\n\r\nthese  posts.   This  will  prevent  the  organisation   from\r\n\r\nbecoming  too settled in its ways, and it will also encourage\r\n\r\nyoung and capable officers to stay on in the service, in  the\r\n\r\nrealistic hope of reaching a PSL post.  Because otherwise the\r\n\r\nyoung  officer  looks  up  and  says,  \"Here's  my  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary who was promoted early.  He is now 40.  He has  got\r\n\r\n22  years  left, by which time the retirement  age  may  have\r\n\r\nreached 67.  Why should I hang around?\"  And he will  be  off\r\n\r\nlooking for more exciting challenges elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we need to balance this need for turnover and renewal\r\n\r\nin  the civil service, with adequate career security for  the\r\n\r\nofficers.   We want to build a corps of highly motivated  and\r\n\r\ndedicated  officers who take a long view of the issues  which\r\n\r\nthey handle.  In other words, if you mishandle something  and\r\n\r\ncreate  a problem, you will still be around to deal with  the\r\n\r\nproblem  when it comes back to haunt you.  It is  not  enough\r\n\r\nfor officers to know that they can make it to the top if they\r\n\r\nhave  what  it  takes and they give their  best.   They  need\r\n\r\npredictability in their service career paths, both before and\r\n\r\nafter  reaching a PSL post.  Officers must feel assured  that\r\n\r\ntheir careers are being managed systematically, in a fair and\r\n\r\ntransparent framework.  We do not want civil servants  to  be\r\n\r\nless than totally dedicated to their tasks, because they  are\r\n\r\nquietly preoccupied making provisions for themselves just  in\r\n\r\ncase their careers take an untoward turn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in mind both imperatives, the Government has\r\n\r\ndecided to introduce a \"flow-through\" mechanism of fixed-term\r\n\r\nappointments for Public Service Leadership jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this framework, the retirement age for\r\n\r\nAdministrative Officers  will remain at 62, like other  jobs.\r\n\r\nOfficers with the potential to be promoted to PSL posts  will\r\n\r\nremain  in  the  Administrative Service, while  those  judged\r\n\r\nunlikely to do so will be re-deployed to other parts  of  the\r\n\r\ncivil service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative Officers who make it to PSL posts will be\r\n\r\nappointed  for fixed terms.  An officer appointed  to  a  PSL\r\n\r\npost  at  the Deputy Secretary level will be given a  10-year\r\n\r\nterm,  during  which  he  may hold  two  or  three  DS  level\r\n\r\nappointments.  If he is subsequently appointed to a PSL  post\r\n\r\nat the Permanent Secretary level, that will also be for a 10-year  term,  starting  at  that point  when  he  reaches  the\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretary level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general rule, officers will relinquish their PSL\r\n\r\nappointments  on  completing their 10-year terms.   Some  may\r\n\r\nhave  their  PSL  terms  extended,  but  this  will  be   the\r\n\r\nexception.   We  seek to maintain a constant flow-through  of\r\n\r\ntalent   and   a  constant  rejuvenation  of  public   sector\r\n\r\nleadership.   Officers who relinquish their PSL  appointments\r\n\r\nbut  wish  to stay on in the public service will  be  offered\r\n\r\nsuitable  non-PSL  jobs, subject to availability.   They  can\r\n\r\nthen serve until the age of 62.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers who do not wish to take up a non-PSL job will\r\n\r\nbe  freely  granted early retirement and  can  then  start  a\r\n\r\nsecond career somewhere else.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remuneration at the PSL level will take into account the\r\n\r\nsignificantly  heavier responsibilities  of  PSL  jobs.   PSL\r\n\r\nofficers  will  generally receive larger performance  bonuses\r\n\r\nthan other Administrative Officers.  They will also receive a\r\n\r\nspecial  PSL  Allowance, in addition to other  components  of\r\n\r\ntheir salaries, so long as they are still occupying their PSL\r\n\r\nposts and have not relinguished these posts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  PSL Allowance will initially be one month per year,  and\r\n\r\nwill be built up later to two months per year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to introducing fixed-term appointments for\r\n\r\nPSL  jobs,  the  Government will also  broaden  training  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment opportunities for Administrative Officers.   This\r\n\r\nwill  help  to develop talent for the service, and  make  the\r\n\r\nservice  a  more  attractive  career.   For  example,   every\r\n\r\nAdministrative  Officer  with the potential  to  hold  a  PSL\r\n\r\nappointment  will be sponsored for one postgraduate  training\r\n\r\nprogramme while in service, in other words, a Master's degree\r\n\r\nof  some  kind.   Some  Permanent Secretaries  will  also  be\r\n\r\ngranted    sabbatical    leave,   to   recharge    themselves\r\n\r\nintellectually, and update themselves on new developments  in\r\n\r\ntheir policy fields.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transition to fixed-term appointments for PSL posts\r\n\r\nmust  be  managed  judiciously  and  sensitively,  to  ensure\r\n\r\nstability  and  continuity  in  the  public  service.   These\r\n\r\nchanges   will  be  implemented  together  with  the   salary\r\n\r\nrevisions  for  the Administrative Service  that  I  will  be\r\n\r\nannouncing   later.   We  will  make  suitable   transitional\r\n\r\narrangements  for  the current incumbents of  PSL  jobs,  and\r\n\r\naddress any concerns they may have over the new framework.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Civil Service Salary Revisions and NWC Award</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we focus on the Public Service Leadership\r\n\r\npositions,  we  must  not neglect the  main  body  of  public\r\n\r\nofficers, at all levels and in many different services.   For\r\n\r\nthe  whole system to work well, every public officer  has  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  his or her best.  Every one of them needs  to  be\r\n\r\nproperly managed, paid, and incentivised, and not just a  few\r\n\r\ntop officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has conducted a full review of civil\r\n\r\nservice  salaries.  Salaries of most schemes of service  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  revised  for  at least two years  because  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic   downturn.   However,  with  the  strong   economic\r\n\r\nrecovery, private sector's earnings have risen substantially.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF data indicate that except for secondary school\r\n\r\nleavers,  the  starting annual salaries of the civil  service\r\n\r\nare   generally   lagging  significantly  behind   the   75th\r\n\r\npercentile  salaries  in  the private  sector.   The  gap  is\r\n\r\ngreatest  for graduates with pass degrees, where  the  annual\r\n\r\nprivate  sector starting salary is about 36% higher than  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service; and those with technical diplomas, where  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector is about 51% higher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resignation rates have also gone up across the entire\r\n\r\ncivil service.  For example, this year, 284 officers from the\r\n\r\nSenior  Officer Service (which means 12% of the  total  staff\r\n\r\nstrength)  resigned   in the first five months  of  the  year\r\n\r\ncompared  to  267  for the whole of last  year.   So  if  you\r\n\r\nextrapolate  that, by the end of the year, 1/4 will  be  gone\r\n\r\nand after two years, you will have no army left.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some outflow of staff is normal in a market\r\n\r\neconomy,   especially  during  a  strong  economic  recovery,\r\n\r\nexcessive  outflow  will  undermine  the  civil  service  and\r\n\r\njeopardise public services.  The civil service must  be  able\r\n\r\nto  attract  and  retain  sufficient talent  to  continue  to\r\n\r\nfunction stably and effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already announced salary revisions\r\n\r\nfor  several  schemes  of  service, which  face  particularly\r\n\r\ncritical  problems  of  outflow and staff  shortages.   These\r\n\r\ninclude   senior   officers  from  the   Commercial   Affairs\r\n\r\nDepartment, the Legal Service, the Nursing Service,  and  the\r\n\r\nMedical  Service.   Now we have decided  to  make  a  general\r\n\r\nsalary revision for all civil servants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are mindful that civil service salaries should follow\r\n\r\nprivate sector salary trends, and not lead them.  We  do  not\r\n\r\nwant excessive civil service pay adjustments to increase wage\r\n\r\npressures  on private sector firms.  But it is also  critical\r\n\r\nfor  the  civil  service pay to keep pace  with  the  private\r\n\r\nsector, and not to lag too far behind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This civil service salary revision coincides with this\r\n\r\nyear's  National Wages Council (NWC) award.   The  Government\r\n\r\nhas accepted the NWC's recommendation that \"workers should be\r\n\r\nrewarded with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwage  increase in line with economic recovery\".   Instead  of\r\n\r\nmaking  a salary revision and a separate NWC adjustment,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  consolidate the two into  a  single  salary\r\n\r\nrevision exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated salary adjustments will include a\r\n\r\nfurther  restoration of the Annual Variable Component  (AVC),\r\n\r\nincreased  performance bonuses, higher monthly salaries,  and\r\n\r\nmore portable medical benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Annual Variable Component</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the annual variable component. The civil service\r\n\r\nhas been paying an AVC of 2 months every year since 1991.  We\r\n\r\nhad  built  it up gradually after the last economic recession\r\n\r\nin  1985.  In 1998, the AVC was reduced to 3/4 month  because\r\n\r\nof the economic crisis.  Last year (1999) we paid an AVC of 1\r\n\r\nmonth,  (we  restored 1/4 month) plus another  1/4  month  of\r\n\r\nSpecial  Bonus  at  the end of the year, when  we  found  the\r\n\r\neconomy recovering more strongly than we had expected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, because of the positive economic outlook, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  decided  to  increase  the  Annual  Variable\r\n\r\nComponent  by 3/4 month.  We will pay 1 3/4 month of  AVC  in\r\n\r\ntotal.   3/4  month  will be paid in July,  and  1  month  in\r\n\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will bring us close to restoring AVC to 2 months,\r\n\r\nwhere it was prior to the crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Performance Bonus</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, performance bonus. Currently, only civil servants\r\n\r\nin  the more senior grades are paid performance bonuses.  The\r\n\r\nsalaries for the rest of the officers do not depend on  their\r\n\r\nperformance.  But we must strengthen the link between pay and\r\n\r\nindividual  performance, by building up a performance-related\r\n\r\ncomponent  in the total wage package of every civil  servant.\r\n\r\nThis salary revision provides a good opportunity for us to do\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will pay a performance bonus to all civil\r\n\r\nservants who currently do not receive any performance  bonus.\r\n\r\nThe base rate will be 1/2 month per year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  means  that  an average officer who  has  put  in  good\r\n\r\nperformance  will receive a performance bonus of  1/2  month,\r\n\r\nwhile  officers who perform better than average will  receive\r\n\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the civil servants who already receive a performance\r\n\r\nbonus,  we  will increase the base rate for their performance\r\n\r\nbonus by 1/2 month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will cover all civil servants - Divisions III, IV,\r\n\r\nthe  road  sweepers,  the cleaners, the  clerks,  the  senior\r\n\r\nofficers.  Everybody will have one component of his pay which\r\n\r\nwill  depend  on his performance.  You perform, you  will  be\r\n\r\nrewarded;  you do not perform, this is the first signal.   If\r\n\r\nyou  continue not to perform, further strong signals will  be\r\n\r\non the way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 1/2 month performance bonus is only the first step,\r\n\r\nbecause  1/2  month is not quite large enough.  As  and  when\r\n\r\nadditional  salary adjustments are justified  in  future,  we\r\n\r\nintend to further build up the performance bonus component to\r\n\r\na base rate of at least 1 month for all civil servants.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Monthly Salary Increase</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the performance bonus, we will increase\r\n\r\nmonthly salaries for most schemes of service by an average of\r\n\r\n5.4%.  In keeping with the spirit of NWC recommendations, the\r\n\r\n5.4%  increase in monthly salaries will be in the form  of  a\r\n\r\n$50  lump sum plus a 3.8% increase.  This formula of a  fixed\r\n\r\nquantum plus a percentage of pay will benefit the more junior\r\n\r\nand lower income officers.  The actual percentage increase in\r\n\r\nmonthly  salaries will range from 11% for the lower  division\r\n\r\nofficers to 4% for senior Superscale officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average total salary increase for a civil servant\r\n\r\nfrom this revision is about 13%.  I say \"average\" because  it\r\n\r\nwill depend on your grade, your service, your performance and\r\n\r\nwhether  additional adjustments are made  for  your  service.\r\n\r\nThis  includes  the  3/4 month AVC increase,  the  1/2  month\r\n\r\nincrease  in  performance bonus, and  the  5.4%  increase  in\r\n\r\nmonthly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsalaries.  This revision will significantly narrow the salary\r\n\r\ngap between the civil service and the private sector, but  it\r\n\r\nwill not completely close it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Specific Services</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me mention a few specific services. The SAF\r\n\r\nhas traditionally paid a premium over civil service salaries,\r\n\r\ngiven  the  strategic need to attract a fair share of  talent\r\n\r\ninto  the SAF in order to maintain a credible defence  force.\r\n\r\nTo  maintain  the  premium,  MINDEF  will  also  be  revising\r\n\r\nsalaries of SAF personnel upward by an average of 13%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several services still face particularly serious\r\n\r\nstaffing problems, or have salaries which are further out  of\r\n\r\nline  from  the  private sector.  They  will  receive  higher\r\n\r\nsalary revisions than the general civil service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Intelligence Service and Foreign Service will\r\n\r\nreceive salary revisions of between 11-31%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Management and Technical Support Services, which\r\n\r\nrecruit  polytechnic diploma holders, are  also  experiencing\r\n\r\nhigher  attrition rates.  The most serious gaps  are  in  the\r\n\r\nlower  grades.  The salaries of the relevant grades for these\r\n\r\ntwo services will be increased by about 20%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Further Adjustments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect some other services to require further\r\n\r\nadjustments  beyond this salary revision.   In  this  dynamic\r\n\r\nenvironment,  waiting  for the next annual  cycle  of  salary\r\n\r\nreviews  will be too slow.  The Public Service Division  will\r\n\r\nwork   with  other  Ministries  to  review  their  respective\r\n\r\nstaffing situations within the next three to six months,  and\r\n\r\nmake adjustments where justified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just mention two. One is the Ministry of Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  which  is reviewing the scheme of  service  for  its\r\n\r\nuniformed   personnel,  to  ensure  that  the  Home   Affairs\r\n\r\nUniformed Services remain an attractive career choice and the\r\n\r\nservices recruit their fair share of quality\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstaff  to  ensure the safety and security of Singapore.   MHA\r\n\r\nhas  engaged  Towers Perrin to conduct the review,  which  is\r\n\r\nproceeding well on track.  The consultants will present their\r\n\r\noverall recommendations at the end of August, covering mainly\r\n\r\ncareer   structures,   benefits,  continuous   learning   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  and  work environment  issues.   And  the  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  Uniformed  Services Council will then  consider  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, the Education Service. In this revision, the\r\n\r\nEducation Service will receive the average increase  of  13%.\r\n\r\nHowever,  teachers play an important role  in  educating  our\r\n\r\nnext  generation  of  Singaporeans  for  the  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.   We  must continue to attract and retain  good  and\r\n\r\ncommitted teachers.  The Ministry of Education will undertake\r\n\r\na further review of the pay structure of teachers to shape it\r\n\r\nto  better  meet  both  MOE's organisational  needs  and  the\r\n\r\nteachers' personal aspirations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Portable Medical Benefits</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to its core wage guidelines, the NWC\r\n\r\nrecognised  that  with an ageing population,  rising  medical\r\n\r\ncosts  and increasing job mobility, there is a need to refine\r\n\r\nexisting  medical benefit schemes to make them more portable.\r\n\r\nIt  noted  that  the  Ministry  of  Manpower  had  set  up  a\r\n\r\nTripartite  Committee on Portable Medical Benefits  to  study\r\n\r\nthe issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government agrees with the NWC that there is an\r\n\r\nurgent  need  to  address the issue of medical  benefits  for\r\n\r\nworkers.   During the Budget debate this year,  Mr  Yeo  Guat\r\n\r\nKwang  and Mr Thomas Thomas had also suggested that the civil\r\n\r\nservice  review its medical benefits schemes.   Mr  Yeo  Guat\r\n\r\nKwang  specifically suggested that \"unused\" portions  of  the\r\n\r\nannual $350 cap on outpatient subsidy for civil servants  who\r\n\r\nare on the Medisave and Subsidised Outpatient Treatment (MSO)\r\n\r\nScheme  be  credited into the Medisave account  of  officers.\r\n\r\nThese are officers who have 1% extra of Medisave paid to them\r\n\r\nto  pay for their hospital expenses and who have a $350 limit\r\n\r\nwhich  they  can claim if they have outpatient expenses,  and\r\n\r\nmany\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  them do not claim the full amount.  The question is: what\r\n\r\nhappens  to the balance at the end of the year?  And  Mr  Yeo\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  the balance, instead of going  back  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  should  be  paid into their  Medisave  accounts.\r\n\r\nThis  would  make medical benefits in the civil service  more\r\n\r\nportable  and encourage younger officers to stay healthy.   I\r\n\r\nhave replied that this suggestion had merit, and promised  to\r\n\r\nreview the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided to accept Mr Yeo Guat Kwang's\r\n\r\nproposal.  Starting this year, if an officer does not use  up\r\n\r\nthe  full  amount of his annual outpatient cap of  $350,  the\r\n\r\nbalance will be credited into his Medisave account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average unused outpatient subsidy per MSO officer in\r\n\r\n1999 was $276.  As there are about 31,300 officers on the MSO\r\n\r\nScheme  (this includes a few Members of Parliament), it  will\r\n\r\ncost the Government about $8.6 million to transfer the unused\r\n\r\nbalance  into  the Medisave accounts of the  officers.   This\r\n\r\namount  will  increase over the years as the  MSO  population\r\n\r\nincreases.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Review of Salary Benchmarks</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn now to the review of salary benchmarks and\r\n\r\nrestructuring  of  salaries for the  Administrative  Service,\r\n\r\nPolitical and Statutory Appointment holders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1994 White Paper on Competitive Salaries for\r\n\r\nCompetent  and  Honest  Government  established  two  private\r\n\r\nsector salary benchmarks to peg Ministers' and Administrative\r\n\r\nOfficers'  salaries.   The  benchmarks  were  based  on   the\r\n\r\nsalaries  of  top  earners from a basket  of  6  professions,\r\n\r\nchosen as far as possible to be similar to the nature of work\r\n\r\nperformed  by  Ministers and senior civil  servants.   The  6\r\n\r\nprofessions  were: bankers, accountants, engineers,  lawyers,\r\n\r\nMNCs, and local manufacturers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, the White Paper recommended pegging the\r\n\r\nsalary  for  a  Superscale G Administrative  Officer  to  the\r\n\r\nprincipal  earned income of the 15th person aged 32 belonging\r\n\r\nto the same 6 professions (15P32). The salary for a Staff\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrade  I  Minister  was  pegged  at  two-thirds  the  average\r\n\r\nprincipal earned income of the top four individuals from each\r\n\r\nof  the  6  professions regardless of age  (2/3  AVE24).  The\r\n\r\nformulas would be reviewed after 5 years, ie, in year 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key advantage of this approach was that the\r\n\r\nbenchmarks  would be computed annually, based on  IRAS  data,\r\n\r\nand  the  salaries  of Ministers and Administrative  Officers\r\n\r\nwould  automatically follow the benchmarks up or down, albeit\r\n\r\nafter  a  lag. This has taken place. In 1996, both benchmarks\r\n\r\nwent  up,  and Government salaries followed.  In  1997,  both\r\n\r\nbenchmarks went down, and Superscale G salaries were  cut  by\r\n\r\n2%  and Staff  Grade I salaries were cut by 7%. In 1998,  the\r\n\r\nSuperscale  G benchmark decreased marginally, but  the  Staff\r\n\r\nGrade I benchmark increased.  In view of the economic crisis,\r\n\r\nSuperscale G salaries followed the benchmark down, but  Staff\r\n\r\nGrade I salaries were frozen even though their benchmark went\r\n\r\nup.  Government salaries were again frozen in  1999,  despite\r\n\r\nincreases in both benchmarks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while Government salaries have been frozen\r\n\r\nsince  1998,  top  private  sector  earnings  have  increased\r\n\r\nsubstantially, despite the economic crisis.   The  2/3  AVE24\r\n\r\nbenchmark increased by 13% in 1998, 29% in 1999, and 23% this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The individuals in the benchmark were not salaried\r\n\r\nworkers,   whose  employers  had  failed  to  exercise   wage\r\n\r\nrestraint.  They are lawyers, accountants and engineers,  who\r\n\r\nare professionals earning fees that depend on their volume of\r\n\r\nbusiness.  They  are  bankers, whose bonuses  depend  on  the\r\n\r\nprofits of their banks. They are CEOs of manufacturing firms,\r\n\r\nmultinational  or local, many of whom receive stock  options.\r\n\r\nWhy  did  their earnings go up? The immediate explanation  is\r\n\r\nthat   their   businesses  did  well.  The  more  fundamental\r\n\r\nexplanation  can  only  be globalisation  and  the  knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy.   In  other words, while the Singapore economy  went\r\n\r\ndown, not the whole of it went down, some parts continued to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrive  and prosper.  They were linked not to our region  but\r\n\r\nto  America,  Europe and to the rest of the world.  And  some\r\n\r\npersons, the best lawyers, the best bankers, the best CEOs of\r\n\r\nmultinationals  were  in  demand.  They  could  command  that\r\n\r\nhigher  price  and they did well, and their  firms  also  did\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Benchmark Formulas</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the latest figures for the existing benchmarks,\r\n\r\nthe  Superscale G annual salary should be $363,000, 50%  more\r\n\r\nthan  the  current $242,000. The Staff Grade I annual  salary\r\n\r\nshould  be  $1.64  million, about 90% more than  the  current\r\n\r\n$861,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of simply accepting these figures, and\r\n\r\nincreasing  salaries  to  match  them,  the  Government   has\r\n\r\nthoroughly  reviewed  the  salary benchmark  methodology  and\r\n\r\nframework.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have found that the benchmark of 15P32 for Superscale\r\n\r\nG is sound. It has been effective in attracting and retaining\r\n\r\ngood  officers in the Administrative Service for the  past  5\r\n\r\nyears.  We will retain the benchmark as it is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the 2/3 AVE24 benchmark, the basic\r\n\r\napproach  of comparing the salaries of Ministers  and  senior\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  with  a  basket of  top  earners  in  the  6\r\n\r\nprofessions  is sound. The 6 professions remain relevant  and\r\n\r\nappropriate,  and the discount factor of 2/3  is  reasonable.\r\n\r\nEmpirically, the benchmark has been reliable, moving in  line\r\n\r\nwith wider trends of earnings of top professionals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the robustness of the 2/3 AVE24 benchmark can\r\n\r\nbe  improved in several respects.  Firstly, the base  of  the\r\n\r\nbenchmark  is narrow. Only the 4 highest earners  are  chosen\r\n\r\nfrom  each  profession. These 4 may not be representative  of\r\n\r\ntop  members  of  the profession, but may  just  be  the  few\r\n\r\nindividuals  who  happened to have had an exceptionally  good\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore propose to broaden the base of the\r\n\r\nbenchmark from the top 4 earners in 6 professions to the  top\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearners  in  6  professions.  We  will  thus  be  considering\r\n\r\nprincipal  earned incomes of 48 individuals  instead  of  24.\r\n\r\nThis  will make the benchmark more representative of the  top\r\n\r\nprofessionals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the benchmark uses the arithmetic average of\r\n\r\nthe  24  incomes.  In other words, we get the 24 figures,  we\r\n\r\nadd  them together, we divide by 24 and use that average. The\r\n\r\naverage  is  satisfactory  if the 24  incomes  are  clustered\r\n\r\nfairly close together. But if there are a few extremely  high\r\n\r\nincomes in the group, this will affect the average, and  will\r\n\r\nmake the average less representative of the group as a whole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, instead of using the arithmetic average, we\r\n\r\nwill  take  the  median income of the  group,  ie,  the  24th\r\n\r\nhighest  income among the group of 48. We have 48 people.  We\r\n\r\nrank  them from the highest to bottom and we choose the  24th\r\n\r\nperson,  who  is  in  the middle, and  we  use  that  as  the\r\n\r\nrepresentative.  This fixed rank approach will not be  skewed\r\n\r\nby  the presence of a few very high income earners, and  will\r\n\r\nyield  a  more  stable benchmark.  Because I am choosing  the\r\n\r\nincome of person number 24, so even if person number 1  earns\r\n\r\n$10  million  instead of $2 million, it does not affect  that\r\n\r\nfigure of the middle person unless the whole group moves,  in\r\n\r\nwhich  case it is fair for the median and our benchmark  also\r\n\r\nto move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the benchmark treats stock option gains just\r\n\r\nlike any other form of income, for example salary, bonus,  or\r\n\r\npartnership share. But stock options are volatile. Executives\r\n\r\nmay  exercise in a single year stock options which they  have\r\n\r\naccumulated over several years, especially in a bull  market.\r\n\r\nTo  accept the full amount of stock option gains without  any\r\n\r\ndiscount  is  unfair and will skew the benchmark upwards.  In\r\n\r\nthe  past, gains from stock options formed only a small  part\r\n\r\nof  the  top earnings, but they may become more important  in\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock option gains form part of income, and are taxed as\r\n\r\nsuch.  We therefore cannot ignore them in estimating  private\r\n\r\nsector incomes. However, to allow for the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuncertainty  and  volatility, we will discount  by  half  any\r\n\r\nstock  option gains before computing their median income.  In\r\n\r\neffect, we are assuming that the stock options that are being\r\n\r\nexercised  have been accumulated over 2 years.   So  whatever\r\n\r\nthe stock option gain is, we divide by 2.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if a person earns $1 million in salaries\r\n\r\nand bonuses and another $1 million in stock option gains, his\r\n\r\ntotal  income  for the year will be $2 million. However,  for\r\n\r\npurposes of the benchmark, we will discount the stock  option\r\n\r\ngains  by  half,  ($1 million from salaries and  bonus,  $1/2\r\n\r\nmillion  from  the stock option gains) and we  will  use  the\r\n\r\nfigure of $1.5 million in our calculations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these changes, the Ministers' benchmark\r\n\r\nwill  be  renamed 2/3 M48, instead of 2/3 AVE24.  The  latest\r\n\r\nvalue  of  2/3 M48 is $1.21 million. $1.21 million  per  year\r\n\r\nranks 206th among private sector earners. In comparison, when\r\n\r\nwe  first  set  the  2/3  AVE24  benchmark,  the  figure  was\r\n\r\n$811,000,  which  ranked 101st among private sector  earners.\r\n\r\nYou  can  see from the old benchmark to the revised  one,  we\r\n\r\nhave maintained roughly the same relativity.  In fact, it has\r\n\r\ncome down from 101st to 206th.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides refining the 2/3 AVE24 formula, another\r\n\r\nsignificant  improvement to the present scheme is  to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  18-month  time-lag  in applying the  benchmark.  Private\r\n\r\nsector  earnings in Year X are reported to IRAS in Year  X+1,\r\n\r\nand  the benchmark is calculated and applied only in July  of\r\n\r\nYear  X+2,  which  is 18 months later. By then,  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  earnings  will have moved, and  the  benchmarks  will\r\n\r\nalready  be  somewhat out of date, especially if the  economy\r\n\r\nhas  changed  direction, which can happen, as we  have  seen,\r\n\r\nquite suddenly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the salary comparisons more timely, we will\r\n\r\nreduce  the lag in the process from 18 to 12 months.  Instead\r\n\r\nof  waiting for the full IRAS data at the end of Year X+1, to\r\n\r\nbe  applied  only from July of Year X+2, we will compute  and\r\n\r\napply the updated benchmark in January of Year X+2, based  on\r\n\r\npartial IRAS returns.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Restructuring  Salaries  for the Administrative  Service and Political Appointment Holders</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to reviewing the benchmarks, the Government\r\n\r\nhas  made  fundamental  revisions to  our  salary  and  grade\r\n\r\nstructures.  This  will bring them closer to  private  sector\r\n\r\npractices, and give the Government more flexibility to reward\r\n\r\ndeserving officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will change our structure from salary points to\r\n\r\nsalary  ranges.  We  will  also increase  the  proportion  of\r\n\r\nvariable pay in the annual salary, by introducing a new \"GDP-related bonus\", and by building up the performance bonus.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Salary Ranges</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me explain the salary ranges. The Government\r\n\r\nhas  operated  on  a system of fixed salary  points  for  its\r\n\r\nsenior  officers. Each Superscale or Staff Grade  corresponds\r\n\r\nto  a  single  salary  point.  The  political  and  statutory\r\n\r\nappointment  holders are also tied into the same  fixed-point\r\n\r\nsystem.  In  other  words, this is your rank,  this  is  your\r\n\r\nsalary.  There is a one for one correspondence.  If  you  are\r\n\r\npromoted, your salary goes up.  If you are not promoted, your\r\n\r\nsalary  remains fixed.  In this system, promotions and salary\r\n\r\nrevisions coincide: we cannot give an officer a pay  increase\r\n\r\nwithout also promoting him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system is rigid. No other organisation in Singapore\r\n\r\nuses  such  a system.  Private firms and even some  statutory\r\n\r\nboards   use  salary  ranges,  where  each  rank   or   grade\r\n\r\ncorresponds to a range of salaries. Managers can then  adjust\r\n\r\nan officer's salary without also having to promote him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will introduce a system of salary ranges\r\n\r\nto   replace   the  present  system  of  salary  points   for\r\n\r\nAdministrative  Officers and political  appointment  holders.\r\n\r\nThe  existing 14 Superscale and Staff Grades will  be  banded\r\n\r\nand consolidated\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto 9 salary ranges. The existing 4 Timescale grades will be\r\n\r\nconverted to 4 salary ranges. I have an Annex explaining this\r\n\r\nand  the  Clerk  will now distribute Handout 1.   [Copies  of\r\n\r\nHandout 1 (Cols. 489-92) distributed to Hon. Members].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000629/20000629-HA-0720489.htm\">Handout 1 - Table 1: Salary System Based on Salary Ranges</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at Annex 1 in the Handout, you will see on\r\n\r\nthe  left  side  the  old  system of salary  points  for  the\r\n\r\nSuperscale and Staff Grades, and they are replaced by  ranges\r\n\r\nwhich  we have renamed and renumbered.  Most of the political\r\n\r\nappointments  will also move on to the new system  of  salary\r\n\r\nranges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This salary range system will give us more flexibility\r\n\r\nin  personnel management.  We can reward officers with  merit\r\n\r\nincrements within their salary range each year, depending  on\r\n\r\ntheir  assessed  potential and demonstrated performance.   We\r\n\r\nwill  no  longer  need to wait several years  to  promote  an\r\n\r\nofficer, in order to increase his salary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff Grade I will now correspond to salary range MR4.\r\n\r\n\"M\" stands for Ministers' range.  'S' further down stands for\r\n\r\nSuperscale range and the Timescales are just 'R' ranges.   So\r\n\r\nStaff  Grade 1 will now correspond to salary range MR4.   The\r\n\r\n2/3  M48  benchmark will be the \"Ministers'  Benchmark\",  and\r\n\r\nwill  determine the lower end of the MR4 range, which is  the\r\n\r\nentry grade for Ministers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political, statutory and judicial appointment\r\n\r\nholders  will  be merged into this framework.  Ministers  are\r\n\r\ncurrently on three salary points (Staff Grade I, Staff  Grade\r\n\r\nII  +  12%, and Staff Grade IV).  They will be moved to three\r\n\r\ncorresponding  ranges  of MR4, MR3  and  MR2.   Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinisters will be moved to the MR1 range.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, Prime Minister, Senior Minister, Chief\r\n\r\nJustice, Speaker, Chairman PSC, Attorney General and  Auditor\r\n\r\nGeneral  will  continue to be at fixed salary points.   Their\r\n\r\nsalaries  will  retain  the  same ratios  to  the  Ministers'\r\n\r\nBenchmark as in the existing salary structure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Larger Variable Component</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we will increase the variable component of\r\n\r\nannual  salaries.  This presently consists of the 13th  month\r\n\r\nNPAA, the AVC, and the performance bonus, which together make\r\n\r\nup about 30% of the total annual pay of senior officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will increase this variable component to\r\n\r\napproximately  40%  for  senior  officers,  in  other  words,\r\n\r\nSuperscale Range 9 and above.  This way, a large part of  the\r\n\r\nsalary increase will be in variable pay, which will depend on\r\n\r\nthe  performance of the officer and the state of the economy,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  in  fixed  pay which the  officer  will  receive\r\n\r\nregardless of how he performs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will increase this variable pay by creating a new\r\n\r\n\"GDP-related bonus\", and by building up the performance bonus\r\n\r\nfurther.   We  will  also introduce  a  bonus  pool  so  that\r\n\r\nperformance  bonuses are paid out over  several  years.   The\r\n\r\ndetails  are at Annex 2 (Cols. 491-2) of  Handout 1  which  I\r\n\r\nhave just given you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000629/20000629-HA-0720491.htm\">Annex 2 - GDP-related Bonus</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Implementation and Phasing in of New Benchmarks</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the gap between the revised benchmarks and the\r\n\r\npresent  salary  levels is large, this  is  because  we  have\r\n\r\nlagged behind the private sector, which moved ahead while  we\r\n\r\nfroze  public sector salaries.  This is an exercise to  catch\r\n\r\nup, not to race ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service salary revisions will benefit 70,000\r\n\r\ncivil  servants.   While  the 13%  revision  will  make  most\r\n\r\nsalaries  competitive,  some schemes  of  service  will  need\r\n\r\nfurther   revisions   and  special  arrangements.    We   are\r\n\r\nproceeding  with these, but in the interim we will  not  hold\r\n\r\nback the more general revisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Administrative Service, the more pressing\r\n\r\nchanges  are  the ones that affect the younger officers.   We\r\n\r\nmust move urgently to retain the bright young officers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  are  the  most mobile, and the most likely  to  consider\r\n\r\nleaving   for  the  private  sector.   The  Government   will\r\n\r\ntherefore  move Superscale G salaries (now SR9  salaries)  to\r\n\r\nthe  full 15P32 benchmark; in other words,  $363,000 from 1st\r\n\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the more senior officers and the Ministers, the\r\n\r\nproblem  is  less pressing.  Also the Government  is  mindful\r\n\r\nthat  while  the  economy  is recovering  strongly,  the  CPF\r\n\r\nrestoration is still being phased in.  We should not send the\r\n\r\nwrong  signal that we can now abandon all restraint  in  wage\r\n\r\nsettlements.   However, we have to adjust salaries  to  reach\r\n\r\nthe  benchmarks  over  time, if  the  benchmarks  are  to  be\r\n\r\nmeaningful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore instead of implementing the full revised\r\n\r\nbenchmark of 2/3 M48 immediately, we will phase it in over  3\r\n\r\nyears,  in 4 steps.  In the first step, we will move salaries\r\n\r\nto  80%  of  the Ministers' benchmark.  This means an  annual\r\n\r\nsalary  increase of 12% for a Staff Grade I (MR4) officer  or\r\n\r\nMinister,  from $861,000 to $968,000.  At $968,000,  he  will\r\n\r\nrank  367th among private sector earners.  Nearly all of this\r\n\r\nincrease  of 12% is in the bonuses.  The monthly salary  will\r\n\r\nhardly  change  (it will increase by only 0.3%).   The  Clerk\r\n\r\nwill  now distribute Handout 2.  [Copies of Handout 2  (Cols.\r\n\r\n493-4) distributed to hon. Members.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000629/20000629-HA-0720493.htm\">Handout 2 - Table 2: Pay Comparison Before and After Salary Revision</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handout 2 shows the pay comparison before and after the\r\n\r\nsalary  revision  for the Prime Minister, Ministers at  Staff\r\n\r\nGrade II, Ministers at Staff Grade I, Superscale B which is a\r\n\r\nsignificant  grade for Permanent Secretaries,  Superscale  G,\r\n\r\nwhich  is the lower benchmark and Member of Parliament.   The\r\n\r\nleft hand side shows you the current monthly pay, the current\r\n\r\nannual  pay  and  the current ranking against private  sector\r\n\r\nearners.   The right hand side shows you the revised  monthly\r\n\r\npay,  annual  pay and ranking and also the corresponding  new\r\n\r\nnames  for  the grades.  So you can see Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nat present receiving an allowance of $9,100 per month will in\r\n\r\nthe revised scheme receive an allowance of $11,900 per month.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salaries for grades between Superscale G and Staff Grade\r\n\r\nI will be adjusted by percentages in between the 50% increase\r\n\r\nfor Superscale G and the 12% increase for Staff Grade I.  For\r\n\r\ngrades  above  Staff Grade I (MR4), including  the  statutory\r\n\r\nappointment  holders  and the higher  grades  for  Ministers,\r\n\r\nsalaries  will be increased by 12%, proportional to  the  new\r\n\r\nStaff Grade I (MR4) salary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this revision, the Prime Minister's salary will be\r\n\r\n$1.94  million,  which  will rank 63rd among  private  sector\r\n\r\nearners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will subsequently reduce the discount on\r\n\r\nthe  2/3 M48 benchmark to 10% in July 2001 and to 5% in  July\r\n\r\n2002, and will fully achieve the benchmark in July 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the salary revisions for the Civil Service,\r\n\r\nAdministrative  Service  and  political  appointees  will  be\r\n\r\nimplemented  with effect from 1st July 2000.   They  will  be\r\n\r\neffected  via payroll in August 2000, with back  payment  for\r\n\r\nthe  month  of July.  So anybody who receives a pay  slip  in\r\n\r\nJuly  without new numbers, please stay calm.  It  is  on  the\r\n\r\nway.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Costing</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary revisions for the entire civil service\r\n\r\n(excluding  statutory and judicial appointees) will  increase\r\n\r\nthe Government's wage bill by about $400 million, or 13%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wage bill for political appointment holders will\r\n\r\nincrease from $28 million to $34 million, or about 20%.  This\r\n\r\nis  higher  than the 12% increase for the Ministers,  because\r\n\r\nthe  political appointments below the Ministers, for example,\r\n\r\nMinisters  of State and Parliamentary Secretaries, will  have\r\n\r\nlarger  increases, because they correspond to the  Superscale\r\n\r\ngrades.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while the details of this salary\r\n\r\nrevision  and  review  of  benchmarks  are  complicated,  the\r\n\r\nprinciples are simple and well-established.  Our policy is to\r\n\r\npay people according to their market value\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  contribution,  in  the  case  of  political  appointment\r\n\r\nholders,  with  a  discount.   Paying  officers  properly  is\r\n\r\nessential to recruiting the quality of talent that we need to\r\n\r\nbuild a first-class public service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a new departure. The issue of public sector\r\n\r\npay  and,  particularly Ministers' pay, has  been  repeatedly\r\n\r\ndebated  in  this  House  over  the  years.   In  1994,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment tabled the White Paper on Competitive Salaries for\r\n\r\nHonest  and  Competent  Government.   After  a  full  debate,\r\n\r\nParliament endorsed the White Paper \"as the basis for setting\r\n\r\nsalaries  of Ministers and senior public officers\".   Today's\r\n\r\nMinisterial  Statement  is  entirely  consistent  with   that\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proof of this policy is in its results. Foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors  and international ratings agencies like PERC,  WEF\r\n\r\nand  IMD  regularly rate Singapore's competitiveness  highly,\r\n\r\nand  an  important  element of these ratings  is  their  high\r\n\r\nassessments  of the quality of the Government  and  political\r\n\r\nleadership.    Even  more  important,  the   Government   has\r\n\r\nconsistently  delivered  results to  Singaporeans.   We  have\r\n\r\nnavigated  the  country  safely  through  the  Asian  crisis,\r\n\r\ndelivered strong economic growth year after year, and  raised\r\n\r\nthe  standard of living of all Singaporeans, rich  and  poor.\r\n\r\nWe could not have achieved any of this, without competent and\r\n\r\ndedicated political leaders and a first class civil  service.\r\n\r\nThese  salary  revisions  will  help  us  to  maintain  these\r\n\r\ncritical  strengths, and continue to score new  wins  in  the\r\n\r\nyears to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, pursuant to Standing Order No.\r\n\r\n42, I beg to move, \"That Parliament do now adjourn.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>CIVIL SERVICE NWC AWARD, PUBLIC SECTOR SALARY</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>REVISIONS, AND REVIEW OF SALARY BENCHMARKS</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>2.27 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank you for giving me this opportunity to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the hon. Members in this House will join me in\r\n\r\nthanking  the Deputy Prime Minister for his Statement,  given\r\n\r\nin  his usual candid and lucid manner.  And I am sure Members\r\n\r\nin  this  House will also want to thank him for the  generous\r\n\r\nallowance to Members of Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of Ministerial and civil service salaries\r\n\r\nhas  surfaced several times in this House in the  past.   But\r\n\r\nfor  Members like myself who entered this House only in 1997,\r\n\r\nit will be the first time that we have an opportunity to give\r\n\r\nour  views  on the matter.  The debate in 1994 on  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper entitled \"Competitive Salaries for Honest and Competent\r\n\r\nGovernment\" raised many of the issues that I am sure will  be\r\n\r\nraised again in this House this time round.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Statement today refines what was put in\r\n\r\npractice  after Parliament endorsed the White Paper in  1994.\r\n\r\nThe  principles,  as  stated by the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,\r\n\r\nremain  much  the same  -  clear, transparent  principles  of\r\n\r\nreward,  competitive salaries to attract top talent into  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector and, following from that, the benchmarking  of\r\n\r\nsalaries to comparable posts in the private sector.   In  the\r\n\r\nOctober  1994 debate, Prime Minister Goh reminded this  House\r\n\r\nand  Singaporeans that one of the crucial questions is, \"What\r\n\r\nsort  of  people  in  the Government will  best  provide  you\r\n\r\nstability, a healthy environment, good-paying jobs and  bring\r\n\r\nyou more prosperity?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the turn of the century, I believe that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will  accept  the  wisdom  of  the  policy   of\r\n\r\nattracting  top  talent  into  the  public  sector   -   from\r\n\r\nMinisters, Parliamentary Secretaries to Permanent Secretaries\r\n\r\nand  other civil servants.  What is readily apparent to  many\r\n\r\nwho  would  pause to think of recent events is that Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  weathered the economic storms of the past two  to  three\r\n\r\nyears  far better than many other countries in the region   - countries that have an abundance of resources that we do  not\r\n\r\nhave.  What we do have is a strong, reliable Government and a\r\n\r\nresilient  people, who are prepared to take hardship  and  to\r\n\r\nride out the storm together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the story could have been different. We could have\r\n\r\nbeen  no better off or indeed be worse off than many  of  the\r\n\r\nworst hit countries.  What could have happened, for instance,\r\n\r\nif instead of being Ministers, they have been employed in the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector,  taking care of their own  companies  rather\r\n\r\nthan the general well-being of all Singaporeans?  Would we be\r\n\r\nin  this  position today, when we can point once  more  to  a\r\n\r\nhealthy  growth rate in our economy, when there is a  gradual\r\n\r\nrestoration  of  the cuts in salaries and CPF  that  we  have\r\n\r\nendured over the past couple of years?  To me, and I am  sure\r\n\r\nto  many  right-thinking Singaporeans, the  crucial  policies\r\n\r\ntaken  by  the  Government to combat the economic  crisis  in\r\n\r\n1997 made the difference between what happened to us and what\r\n\r\nhappened in the region.  I do not wish to be smug about this.\r\n\r\nMany  Singaporeans  still suffer from unemployment,  loss  of\r\n\r\nincome and other hardships.  But still recovery was not  long\r\n\r\nin  coming  and all this because of the swift, decisive  and,\r\n\r\nmore  importantly, correct decisions taken to stave  off  the\r\n\r\nill-effects of the crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest people think that we may be blowing our own\r\n\r\ntrumpet,  it is gratifying to know, as Members of this  House\r\n\r\nmust  have  read  in today's Straits Times  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  on  Monday,  26th June,  that  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment   had  been  rated  top  in  Asia   for   economic\r\n\r\neffectiveness and leadership quality.  Their management style\r\n\r\nis described as moderately interventionist, which is distinct\r\n\r\nfrom  being intrusive or highly intrusive.  This is the  view\r\n\r\nculled from a survey on Asian leadership conducted by a  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  think-tank, the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy\r\n\r\n(PERC).   The  survey  is based on the views  of  expatriates\r\n\r\nworking in the region conducted in the first quarter of  this\r\n\r\nyear.    In   other  words,  we  have  the  views  of   those\r\n\r\nexpatriates, most or all of whom, I presume, are  working  in\r\n\r\nthe  private sector, stating quite firmly and simply that the\r\n\r\nleadership  in  Singapore  is  \"High  Quality\".    No   other\r\n\r\nleadership in the survey attracted the same rating.  If there\r\n\r\nwas, and such leaders are paid less, we can, I think, ask the\r\n\r\nDPM for an explanation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was struck not so much by the results of the\r\n\r\nPERC's  survey  which was expected, as also by another  major\r\n\r\npiece  concerning  Singapore  in  the  latest  issue  of  the\r\n\r\nEconomist, that very respectable English publication.  It ran\r\n\r\na  feature on e-Government.  The reporter said that \"after e-commerce and e-business, the next Internet revolution will be\r\n\r\ne-Government\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised me was that the only country that merited\r\n\r\na detailed feature was Singapore.  According to the Economist\r\n\r\nlist  of Net neighbourhoods, ie, people with Internet  access\r\n\r\nat  home, Singapore came second only to Norway.  It is  ahead\r\n\r\nof  countries  like  the US, Germany, UK, Canada,  Japan  and\r\n\r\nAustralia.   At the same time, in the feature on  Singapore's\r\n\r\napproach  to e-Government, the report quoted an international\r\n\r\nsurvey  of sites offering integrated service delivery through\r\n\r\nthe Internet conducted last year by America's General Service\r\n\r\nAdministration.  It stated \"that Singapore eCitizen Centre is\r\n\r\nthe most developed example of integrated service delivery  in\r\n\r\nthe world.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these singular achievements, together with many\r\n\r\nrelating  to our infrastructural facilities like our  airport\r\n\r\nand  seaport,  do not come about spontaneously.   Neither  do\r\n\r\ngood  Government spontaneously emerge from a population.   If\r\n\r\nonly  that  were  true.  But the histories of many  countries\r\n\r\nbear  testimony  to  the  fact that  the  rise  and  fall  of\r\n\r\neconomies,  of  societies and even of civilisations  rest  on\r\n\r\npolitical  and public leadership in times of war,  of  crisis\r\n\r\nand of revolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is facing challenges the like of which\r\n\r\nhave not been experienced before.  We face global competition\r\n\r\nfor  talent,  we  face  competition with developed  countries\r\n\r\nwhich  have  far better resources and much larger populations\r\n\r\nthan we have.  Are we as a people going to be so small-minded\r\n\r\nas to begrudge the political and public leadership their just\r\n\r\nrewards?   Or  are we going to be positive, and  look  beyond\r\n\r\nourselves,  have the interests of the nation  at  heart,  and\r\n\r\nsay, \"Well done, carry on\" and be properly rewarded?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the refinements made to the\r\n\r\nquantification of salaries for civil servants  and  political\r\n\r\nleaders.    I   particularly  welcome  the   institution   of\r\n\r\nperformance  bonus for all civil servants.  But  lest  it  be\r\n\r\nthought  that it can be taken for granted that one would  not\r\n\r\ncast a critical eye on the public service as a Member of this\r\n\r\nHouse, I should like to end by asking the DPM to assure us of\r\n\r\nthree things:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that the selection process for the top leaders,\r\n\r\nwhether  as  Ministers, office-bearers, Permanent Secretaries\r\n\r\nor  other PSL appointments, be as rigorous, if not more, than\r\n\r\nwhat it has been before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, that we should consider some form of independent\r\n\r\nmechanism  or  body to monitor and evaluate  the  quality  of\r\n\r\ndecision-making in the civil service.  We do not in Singapore\r\n\r\nprefer to use the legal process for challenging civil service\r\n\r\ndecisions.    In  other  countries,  such  as  the   European\r\n\r\ncountries   and   North   America,  there   are   significant\r\n\r\ndevelopments  in the area of administrative  law  where  good\r\n\r\npractices such as candour, transparency and regard  for   the\r\n\r\nindividuals  are  implemented.  We should like  to  encourage\r\n\r\nsuch  values in the civil service, and as many have  said  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  during the Budget debate this  year,  we  should\r\n\r\nexpect   now   a   higher  standard  of   communication   and\r\n\r\ntransparency from the civil service than before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I ask the Government to make all possible\r\n\r\nhaste to restore the cuts to CPF and other wages to alleviate\r\n\r\nthe  hardship that is still felt by many.  Singaporeans would\r\n\r\nwant  to be assured that the Government would, as the PM  has\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"provide stability, a healthy environment, good-paying\r\n\r\njobs and more prosperity\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thank you and support the measures on public\r\n\r\nsector salaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, I thank you\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to make some comments on the measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time when the salaries and benchmarkings were\r\n\r\ncommented upon, it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  in  a different environment where the economy was  doing\r\n\r\nwell and many of the salaries have not gone up to the million\r\n\r\ndollar  ranges.  This time round the issues will probably  be\r\n\r\nmore emotive because there are many other issues at hand, for\r\n\r\nexample,  the economic recovery has been patchy  and  certain\r\n\r\nsectors   have  not  fully  recovered.   There  is  still   a\r\n\r\nsignificant minority of the households in Singapore  who  are\r\n\r\nlow  income families.  Many of these will find these  million\r\n\r\ndollar salaries, especially for the high office holders, very\r\n\r\nmind-boggling  numbers  which they cannot  quite  fathom  and\r\n\r\nunderstand.  Of course, there will be some people who believe\r\n\r\nthat  political  leaders should always be altruistic.   I  am\r\n\r\nhere  not to defend anybody but to try to take a level headed\r\n\r\napproach  to  some  of these issues and try  to  dissect  the\r\n\r\nemotive issues from the logical and rational thinking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question we want to ask ourselves is whether\r\n\r\nthere  are  any grounds for salary adjustment.  The  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis  has seen either a freeze or a downward adjustment  in\r\n\r\nremuneration   for  senior  Government  leaders   and   civil\r\n\r\nservants.  A strong and far-sighted political leadership that\r\n\r\nwe  have and an efficient civil service have helped Singapore\r\n\r\nto  steer ourselves through the crisis with minimal damage to\r\n\r\nthe  economy.  Our political leaders have formulated policies\r\n\r\nthat  have allowed Singapore to have a speedy recovery.   The\r\n\r\nupswing  in  the economy has been fast and, as  Members  have\r\n\r\nread in the recent PERC report, our Singapore Government  has\r\n\r\nbeen rated No. 1 in this region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recovery in the economy, there have been\r\n\r\nseveral  pull  factors which have made it more  difficult  to\r\n\r\nretain  good leaders in the civil service and in other  areas\r\n\r\nof  the  civil service as well.  I think there will  be  this\r\n\r\nglobal  pull  for  talents which DPM has  mentioned,  and  we\r\n\r\ncannot  escape  the  fact that this pull will  increase  when\r\n\r\nstock  options  become a part of life in the private  sector.\r\n\r\nIt will be increasingly more difficult to attract top quality\r\n\r\nleaders  to join the political leadership.  We need  to  make\r\n\r\nthese adjustments to market changes to retain the talents and\r\n\r\nto attract new talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question that will bother many people is\r\n\r\nwhether  the  degree  of pay rise is  justifiable.   DPM  has\r\n\r\nexplained  that the percentage of pay rise across-the-  board\r\n\r\nhas  been  tailored to meet different segments in  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  according to the type of professions or  departments\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  in.   I  support the move  to  moderate  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the base pay and instead move towards  variable\r\n\r\nand  performance  linked bonus system.  I think  it  is  very\r\n\r\nheart  warming that, for the Ministers especially,  the  base\r\n\r\npay  increase has only been 0.3%.  That is a good message  to\r\n\r\nsend  across  and that a significant part of the  adjustments\r\n\r\nwill be through a performance related system.  This is a move\r\n\r\nthat should be lauded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question that many people will ask is not just\r\n\r\nthe  percentage of increment but the absolute amounts in  the\r\n\r\nsalary  increase.  Is it justified?  Yes, the sums are  large\r\n\r\nand we must look at this in perspective.  We must be able  to\r\n\r\ncompare  apples  with  apples and  pears  with  pears.   Some\r\n\r\nMembers must have read in the last few weeks that there was a\r\n\r\nreport  in  the Straits Times that said that a  drop  in  the\r\n\r\nshare price of several electronic and manufacturing companies\r\n\r\non the Stock Exchange had resulted in a paper loss of tens of\r\n\r\nmillions  of dollars for these individuals.  I am also  aware\r\n\r\nof   companies  where  employees  have  stock  options  worth\r\n\r\nmillions of dollars.  If we take the perspective that our top\r\n\r\nGovernment  leaders  are the key drivers of  Singapore  Inc.,\r\n\r\nthen  certainly  they should deserve to  get  a  remuneration\r\n\r\ncomparable,  if  not  better than  those  given  to  the  top\r\n\r\nmanagement of these companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am especially pleased that even though the benchmarks\r\n\r\nand  the formulas have been decided upon, the Government  has\r\n\r\nbeen transparent enough to come forward to bring the issue to\r\n\r\nthe  forefront  and debate this again and  put  this  up  for\r\n\r\ncomments  by other Members of Parliament. If we  look  at  it\r\n\r\nlogically  and  rationally, these moves are  good  moves  but\r\n\r\nthere  are many emotional issues at hand and we cannot escape\r\n\r\nfrom  these emotional concerns that will be expressed or have\r\n\r\nbeen expressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, economic recovery is patchy and\r\n\r\nthere  are  sectors of the economy that have yet  to  recover\r\n\r\nfully from the crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it be a rational argument to say that the pay of\r\n\r\nMinisters  and  civil servants should only be adjusted  after\r\n\r\nall  sectors of the economy have been restored or  recovered?\r\n\r\nI  do  not  think  so.   In fact, we should  ensure  that  we\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  attract good talent into Government  and  civil\r\n\r\nservice  so that we can drive the economy to greater  heights\r\n\r\nand  restructure  the economy to meet the  challenges  ahead.\r\n\r\nThis  would  be  a solution in helping those sectors  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy that have been weak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another emotive concern of many people is, I think there\r\n\r\nis  not  a  small minority of Singapore households that  have\r\n\r\nincomes at a low income range, and they will never be able to\r\n\r\nget  even one year's remuneration of the top earners in their\r\n\r\nwhole  life time.  Hence, some people will argue, \"Yes, there\r\n\r\nwill  be  too great an income divide between the top and  the\r\n\r\nlow income families.\"  This is a very emotive issue that will\r\n\r\nfind  favour  with many people.  It will pull  at  our  heart\r\n\r\nstrings.   Yes,  there  are  low income  families  that  will\r\n\r\ncertainly continue to require assistance.  If we look  at  it\r\n\r\nin  a  more  rational way, we must ask ourselves whether  the\r\n\r\nsavings  that  can be obtained by not having a pay  increase,\r\n\r\nwhat  will  it  do  to help them compared to  having  a  good\r\n\r\nGovernment  and a first class civil service that can  attract\r\n\r\nhigh  quality  investments  and help  workers  upgrade  their\r\n\r\nskills.   That  is  a  better solution to helping  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another emotive issue that the absolute amounts that the\r\n\r\nMinisters   and  top  civil  servants  will  get   in   their\r\n\r\nremuneration  package are so large compared  to  the  average\r\n\r\nhousehold  that it will be very difficult for them to  accept\r\n\r\nthese numbers.  These are million dollar numbers and some  of\r\n\r\nthem  in  their whole life time will never see these numbers.\r\n\r\nI  do not disagree that these numbers may be mind-boggling or\r\n\r\nseem very excessive for the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naverage families in Singapore.  Again, we have to try to  put\r\n\r\naside  our  emotions.  Five or 10 years down the road,  there\r\n\r\nwill always be low income families.  But there will always be\r\n\r\ntop  corporate leaders in the private sector that  will  earn\r\n\r\nsalaries  beyond  the  imagination of the  average  Singapore\r\n\r\nfamilies.   Should  we stop paying our top political  leaders\r\n\r\nand  our  civil servants high salaries because there are  low\r\n\r\nincome  families who will not understand the quantum  of  the\r\n\r\npay?   Or  should  we  pay top political  leaders  and  civil\r\n\r\nservants a remuneration that is close to the market  so  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  good people who will lead the country and  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  help  these  low  income  families   improve  their\r\n\r\nstandard of living?  I think the answer is obvious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there are those who believe that, yes, politicians\r\n\r\nare here on a calling and to be altruistic and therefore they\r\n\r\nshould sacrifice for the nation.  This sort of statement will\r\n\r\nfind favour with many people.  But we must ask ourselves, how\r\n\r\nmany of our top talents in the private sector will be willing\r\n\r\nto  step  out of their high paying private sector  jobs  with\r\n\r\ncorporate  benefits and go into the political arena.   Do  we\r\n\r\nsincerely believe that altruism alone can attract the best to\r\n\r\ncome forward and to run our country?  If we believe that,  we\r\n\r\nmust be mistaken.  I think to many Singaporeans, the concerns\r\n\r\nand  worries  that  were present during  the  Asian  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis appear to have been an issue of the past.  In my  day-to-day  practice as a doctor, I continue to meet people  from\r\n\r\nother  countries,  including Indonesia, and  they  are  still\r\n\r\nsignificantly   affected   by   the   social   and   economic\r\n\r\nconsequences of the crisis.  Just this week alone, I met  one\r\n\r\nwho  said  that he had to relocate from his home in Indonesia\r\n\r\nbecause  of the social unrest.  He has got to move  somewhere\r\n\r\nelse out of Indonesia to live with his daughter.  I have  got\r\n\r\nanother  patient  who came to me and said that  he  was  very\r\n\r\nworried  because his land had been occupied by other  people,\r\n\r\nand he feared for the safety of his family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These accounts by these patients remind me that I have\r\n\r\nto count my\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nblessings.  I do not take this for granted.  I am happy  that\r\n\r\nI  have  a home, I do not have to worry for my safety  of  my\r\n\r\nfamily, and I have a job and stable income.  And all this has\r\n\r\nbeen made possible because we have a strong political climate\r\n\r\nand a strong economy.  I do not take this for granted, but  I\r\n\r\nam  thankful that we have a good Government that has made all\r\n\r\nthis possible for all Singaporeans to have a safe home and  a\r\n\r\nprosperous nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we should invest in our future, and\r\n\r\nreally  our  future depends on attracting and  retaining  top\r\n\r\ntalent  in  the Government and in the civil service  so  that\r\n\r\nthese talented people can continue to make Singapore the best\r\n\r\nhome for every Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is\r\n\r\nvery  difficult to do a benchmark and define a  formula  that\r\n\r\ncan  reflect  what  a  Minister or a  top  civil  servant  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  be paid.  The general feedback  from  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  is that we are paying our Ministers  and  civil\r\n\r\nservants  too high a salary as compared to any other  country\r\n\r\nin  the  world.  But the question we should ask ourselves  is\r\n\r\nwhether  we  can really make a fair comparison by looking  at\r\n\r\nthe  salary  scales  of Ministers and top civil  servants  in\r\n\r\nother  countries.  My contention is that we cannot and should\r\n\r\nnot  because there is no other country like Singapore  around\r\n\r\nthe  world.   The  nature of things here  is  very  different\r\n\r\ncompared  to  those  in  any other countries.   So  Singapore\r\n\r\nleaders  therefore  decided to define a unique  formula  that\r\n\r\nsuits  our  system and the system basically addresses  issues\r\n\r\nlike  corruption prevention, attracting the  best  talent  to\r\n\r\njoin  the  Government and compensating for what the Ministers\r\n\r\nlose out by not participating in the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, we should look at the salary formula on a\r\n\r\nstand-alone context of the Singapore environment and  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of addressing the issues that I just mentioned.  Just\r\n\r\nas  the  board  of directors and the top management  of  each\r\n\r\ncorporation  or  company  will have  to  determine  the  best\r\n\r\ncompensation  package to attract and retain the  best  talent\r\n\r\nand to motivate them to do well for the company, in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame  way  the  Government  of  the  day  in  Singapore   has\r\n\r\ndetermined  the salary formula and compensation package  that\r\n\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister has just announced.  And it is best\r\n\r\nsuited  to achieve the objectives of recruiting and retaining\r\n\r\ntalent and to keep the Government clean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the man in the street, however, will see the\r\n\r\nquantum of salary increases for the Ministers, as so huge and\r\n\r\nunimaginable for them to achieve easily.  I do feel  for  the\r\n\r\nman  in the street and therefore it is the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  ensure that every  Singaporean  has  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to achieve their full potential and earn as  much\r\n\r\nas  they deserve to earn.  Everybody should be ensured  of  a\r\n\r\ngood   quality   of  life  in  Singapore  and   it   is   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the Government and the Ministers to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat this happens.  If the Government fails to do so, and the\r\n\r\nMinisters  fail to do so, then the people in  charge  do  not\r\n\r\ndeserve to be paid what they are being paid, just as  in  any\r\n\r\ncountry,  where  the  CEO  and the top  management  are  held\r\n\r\naccountable for their poor performance and their compensation\r\n\r\npackage is affected accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel that it is not useful to compare the quantum\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministers' salary to that of the man in the  street,\r\n\r\nbecause  if we do, then obviously there is a tremendous  skew\r\n\r\nand  the gap will be really big.  I feel that we should  look\r\n\r\nat the Ministers' compensation package on a stand-alone basis\r\n\r\nbased  on the responsibility they have been charged with  and\r\n\r\nthis cannot be easily compared with anyone else in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe must look at the issue on an absolute basis.  Any relative\r\n\r\nmeasurement  will result in too much of an emotional  debate,\r\n\r\nas  my  colleague  Dr Michael Lim talked about  earlier.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  it  will  be  emotional because of  our  inability  to\r\n\r\ncompare accurately the roles and responsibilities of the jobs\r\n\r\nagainst which we are comparing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, it is also a common practice in\r\n\r\nthe  private sector for the top management to be paid a  very\r\n\r\nhigh compensation package, as compared to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe average worker in the company.  So a relative measurement\r\n\r\nin such a situation is also not useful.  The relative measure\r\n\r\nof  a  CEO's  or  Minister's  salary  should  be  really  the\r\n\r\ncompetition  and  therefore a company or a government  should\r\n\r\ncontinue to attract, keep and motivate them.  To be  able  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to attract, motivate and keep them in the  company,\r\n\r\nthe  compensation package should be more attractive  compared\r\n\r\nto   the   alternative  employment  and  package   that   the\r\n\r\ncompetition can provide.  In this case, for the Ministers and\r\n\r\ntop  civil  servants, the competition is the private  sector.\r\n\r\nFor our CEOs, it will be another company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the formula chosen by the Government basically aims\r\n\r\nto  use the private sector as a benchmark.  I can accept this\r\n\r\nformula  because the private sector does provide  alternative\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities for the Ministers and civil servants\r\n\r\nand  therefore the competition is there for the same  talent.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  feel that the formula used in the past  was  not\r\n\r\nquite  a  good  measure  of what salary  increments  the  top\r\n\r\nprivate sector earners really received.  The biggest flaw  in\r\n\r\nthe formula was that every year, the top four earners in each\r\n\r\nprofessional  group were most likely not the same  people  in\r\n\r\nthe  following year.  In fact, these people were probably the\r\n\r\noutliers  within their profession and taking  an  average  of\r\n\r\nsuch outlier numbers results in something that does not truly\r\n\r\nreflect  what  the best earners in the private sector  really\r\n\r\nreceive.  And it does not really reflect the essence of  what\r\n\r\nthe formula was supposed to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the top earners in most cases made their money\r\n\r\nas   a  result  of  extraordinary  performance  and  received\r\n\r\nextraordinary bonuses or stock options, as the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  rightly  pointed out.   With  the  changes  in  the\r\n\r\nformula   that   the   Deputy   Prime   Minister   announced,\r\n\r\nspecifically in increasing the total number of people used as\r\n\r\na  benchmark and using the median instead of the  average  of\r\n\r\n48,  I  believe we should, to a certain extent,  address  the\r\n\r\nissue  of  the outliers.  It is also prudent to discount  the\r\n\r\nvariable\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomponent  of  the private sector salaries in  computing  the\r\n\r\nbenchmark  for  Ministers and civil servants, and  especially\r\n\r\nstock options tend to really skew the data out of place.  The\r\n\r\nreason  is that, as the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned,  the\r\n\r\npoint of exercise could be the result of stock option accrued\r\n\r\nover  many  years of employment.  So, therefore, it  was  not\r\n\r\nfair in the past to use this to compute the average.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, by making smaller increments in the basic\r\n\r\nsalary  and  by  allowing huge performance  bonuses,  we  are\r\n\r\ngetting closer to the private sector's method of compensation\r\n\r\nwhere  it  is  more  equitable.  The  Deputy  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nearlier  announced  that  about  40%  of  the  increment   or\r\n\r\nbenchmark salary actually goes to the variable component, and\r\n\r\nI  think it is a good move, and this will only be paid if the\r\n\r\nperformance of the Minister or the civil servant is good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Deputy Prime Minister to continue to\r\n\r\nfine-tune  the  formula  so that we can  better  achieve  the\r\n\r\nintended  goal  of  a private sector system  of  compensation\r\n\r\npackage.   I  especially  support  the  fact  that  should  a\r\n\r\nMinister  or  civil servant do extremely well  and  typically\r\n\r\nthere  will  be just a handful of people each year,  then  we\r\n\r\nshould not shy away from giving them huge bonuses, be it  six\r\n\r\nmonths,  10 months or even 20 months of bonuses, and this  is\r\n\r\nwhat  is being practised in the private sector.  This is  not\r\n\r\ngiven to everyone in the company, just a handful of them  who\r\n\r\nreally did very well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, since we have chosen a private sector\r\n\r\nbenchmark  for  the system of compensating our Ministers  and\r\n\r\ncivil servants, I feel that we should accordingly expose  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  and  civil servants to the risk of employment,  as\r\n\r\nfaced  by the top management in the private sector.  So while\r\n\r\nthe  top managements in the private sector are paid very high\r\n\r\nsalaries, they face tremendous risk in whether their  careers\r\n\r\nshould  continue within the same company.  In my opinion,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  just  adopt  the  good part  of  the  private  sector\r\n\r\npractices and leave out the bad part.  I therefore feel  that\r\n\r\nwhile we have accepted\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  transparent  system of compensating  Ministers  and  civil\r\n\r\nservants, we should accordingly have a transparent system  of\r\n\r\nhow   their  performances  are  measured  and  how  they  are\r\n\r\npenalised for their poor performances.  And penalising  means\r\n\r\nnot getting a bonus, and it may not be a sacking as you know,\r\n\r\nit  takes time.  It is only fair that Singaporeans know about\r\n\r\nthis part of the formula and that we are sincerely practising\r\n\r\na system where people do not get rewarded even if they do not\r\n\r\ndo  their  jobs  well.  I know that this is a very  difficult\r\n\r\nthing to do, especially for the Cabinet, but I would say that\r\n\r\nthis  comes as the hazards of the job, in return for such  an\r\n\r\nattractive  compensation package.  If we  can  show  this  in\r\n\r\npractice  that we are really compensating the good performers\r\n\r\nand not rewarding the poor performers, then I am sure that we\r\n\r\nwill have no problems in getting Singaporeans to support  the\r\n\r\nsystem  that  we are putting in place.  The problem  is  that\r\n\r\nmany  of them are just looking at the good part of the  story\r\n\r\nand  not  the other part of where poor performers do not  get\r\n\r\nrewarded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the proposal that the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister has put up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister that we must have competitive salaries\r\n\r\nfor  Ministers and civil servants to maintain a competent and\r\n\r\nhonest  government.   Such  competitive  salaries  could   be\r\n\r\nslightly   higher   than   the  average   salaries   of   the\r\n\r\nprofessionals  in  the private sector  and  can  be  adjusted\r\n\r\nregularly according to our economic performance, productivity\r\n\r\ngrowth,  and  inflation rate in line with the recommendations\r\n\r\nof  NWC.   The  aim  is to make sure that  they  can  lead  a\r\n\r\ncomfortable life financially commensurate with their official\r\n\r\nposition and status during their dedicated service in  public\r\n\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business community generally understands and accepts\r\n\r\nthis.   But what we are concerned is that, according  to  the\r\n\r\nformula  given  by  the  Government,  the  salaries  of   the\r\n\r\nMinisters and top civil servants will be based on the average\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincome  of  a  few  top  earners who  are  the  exceptionally\r\n\r\nsuccessful   bankers,   accountants,   engineers,    lawyers,\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  or  MNC chiefs.  These top income  earners,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve, are not mere wage earners like the Ministers and top\r\n\r\ncivil servants drawing a fixed salary with good job security,\r\n\r\nregardless  of  the ups and downs of our economic  conditions\r\n\r\nand the balance of payments.  They are, in fact, enterprising\r\n\r\nbusinessmen and risk-takers who have to pay a high  price  in\r\n\r\nterms  of financial losses and legal obligations in the event\r\n\r\nof  their  business failures.  The incomes these top  earners\r\n\r\nearn  from business success could be exceptionally  high  and\r\n\r\nsome of them might in future earn as much as Bill Gates or Li\r\n\r\nKashing.   We  therefore  have  to  ask  ourselves:   Is   it\r\n\r\nappropriate  or  realistic for the Ministers  and  top  civil\r\n\r\nservants to expect an income comparable with such top earners\r\n\r\nin the private sector?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers and top civil servants must strive to earn\r\n\r\ntheir respect, trust and confidence from the people, in order\r\n\r\nto have their continued support in policy implementation.  In\r\n\r\nthe  true  spirit of tripartism, the average businessmen  and\r\n\r\nworkers would expect the Ministers and top civil servants  to\r\n\r\nset  a good example by putting the community before self  and\r\n\r\nmaking  some personal sacrifices, in terms of time and money,\r\n\r\nin  pursuit of national interests and issues.  How could  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  and  top  civil  servants  continue  to  earn  the\r\n\r\nrespect,  trust and confidence from the people  if  they  are\r\n\r\ninclined  to  demand a high income comparable with  those  of\r\n\r\nBill Gates or Li Kashing?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, businessmen and employers in private\r\n\r\nsector are currently facing upward pressure of business  cost\r\n\r\narising  from  the economic recovery.  Any large  across-the-board  increase  in  the civil service salary  may  create  a\r\n\r\nspiral  effect, leading to runaway increases in wages, prices\r\n\r\nand  charges, in both public and private sectors.  This would\r\n\r\ndrive  up our total business cost, forcing many companies  to\r\n\r\nclose  down  or  relocate elsewhere in  the  face  of  fierce\r\n\r\ncompetition from the regional economies.  This, together with\r\n\r\nthe  increasing cost of living, will cause even more hardship\r\n\r\nto the low\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincome group.  The business community would therefore like to\r\n\r\nurge  the Government to be more moderate in the upward salary\r\n\r\nrevisions for Ministers and civil servants and consider other\r\n\r\nsupplementary  incentives or rewards to  keep  the  deserving\r\n\r\nstaff in the civil service.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Sir, I  support\r\n\r\nthe   Government   salary  revision.   In   particular,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should be commended for taking the initiative  to\r\n\r\nfine-tune the salary benchmarks and formula, making  it  even\r\n\r\nmore realistic and practical.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after suffering pay cuts and being held back, in\r\n\r\nterms of benchmarking, during the Asian economic crisis,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  is:  when  should pay be adjusted  for  the  public\r\n\r\nsector?  Is it too soon?  Is it too much?  I think not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a good Government. A good Government that\r\n\r\nshines  like a beacon of light in the darkest moments of  the\r\n\r\nAsian  economic  crisis.   There  is  none  better  than  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government.  It delivers.  The Government  brought\r\n\r\nus  out of the economic crisis safe and sound.  And Singapore\r\n\r\nis  well-positioned indeed to ride the next wave of political\r\n\r\nand  economic  opportunities  in  the  region.   Whereas,  in\r\n\r\ncomparison,  our  neighbours  have  economic  and   political\r\n\r\nupheavals.   We  have peace, stability and  economic  growth.\r\n\r\nThe Government has indeed given\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nus security, peace and prosperity for more than 40 years.  It\r\n\r\nhas  enhanced the assets of all Singaporeans.  What more  can\r\n\r\nwe ask of a good Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must pay well in order to have good men and women in\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  The good men and women would make  a  major\r\n\r\ndifference  to the well-being of the entire nation.   Let  us\r\n\r\nnot hold back but instead ensure that our country, Singapore,\r\n\r\nis  in  good hands, and that we have a bright future to  look\r\n\r\nforward to.  We can of course pay less, but we will get less.\r\n\r\nRather,  we  should invest in our future and  our  children's\r\n\r\nfuture.  It is, in my opinion, a very small price to  pay  to\r\n\r\nensure  that we have good Government, and good men and  women\r\n\r\nin the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC),\r\n\r\na  Hong Kong-based think-tank, ranked Singapore first for the\r\n\r\noverall  qualities  of  the  political  leadership  and   its\r\n\r\nsuccessful  economic management of the country.  This  is  an\r\n\r\nindependent  research institution and it puts  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment right at the top, well ahead of Hong Kong, Taiwan,\r\n\r\nJapan  and  South Korea, with the rest of the other countries\r\n\r\nin the region trailing far, far behind all of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the real world. Let us not pretend that we\r\n\r\ncan   continue   to  have  good  Government  without   paying\r\n\r\nappropriate  and realistic salaries.  You get what  you  pay.\r\n\r\nThis is the fundamental parameter and lesson from the private\r\n\r\nsector.  We know it only too well because many of us are from\r\n\r\nthe private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is indeed better to give realistic salaries to\r\n\r\nthe public sector than to end up as a broken-back country and\r\n\r\nface the prospect of being refugees on the high seas, sailing\r\n\r\nto nowhere, as we have witnessed in so many other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a new generation has grown up in Singapore,\r\n\r\nfascinated  by  IT, the dot.com and the life  sciences.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  to compete for talents in the  open  market,\r\n\r\neven more so in the knowledge-based economy.  Let us also not\r\n\r\nforget that good talented Singaporeans can also go global,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngo  out of Singapore's shores to seek other opportunities  in\r\n\r\nthe brave new world outside.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to make one point about performance of the\r\n\r\npublic  sector  staff.   I  am glad that  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nputting a greater portion of the pay into performance bonuses\r\n\r\nand  incentives  but  I must highlight  the  perception  that\r\n\r\npersists that the civil service is an iron rice bowl and many\r\n\r\ncan get by day by day.  The point here is that we must not be\r\n\r\nseen to be harbouring poor performers.  We are not aware that\r\n\r\nmany  poor  performers are downgraded or removed, whereas  in\r\n\r\nthe private sector, the risk factor is much, much higher, and\r\n\r\nstaff  are  hired  and  fired according  to  performance  and\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With higher pay, it is only right that we expect the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  be  more  stringent  in  the  selection   and\r\n\r\npromotion  of  staff  in  ensuring  accountability  and   not\r\n\r\nhesitating to act on non-performers. We must pay market rate.\r\n\r\nThat  is the right thing to do but, at the same time, market-related performance for the public sector staff must also  be\r\n\r\nexpected.  The  higher  the pay, the  higher  should  be  the\r\n\r\nperformance.   The  civil  service  should  not  forget  that\r\n\r\nordinary  Singaporeans,  the  men-in-the-street,  are  indeed\r\n\r\ntheir pay masters, as well as their customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is of concern to all Singaporeans is the\r\n\r\nwidening  income gap in the country, which is very much  part\r\n\r\nof the global trend in the wake of the new economy, something\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  totally  avoid.  It is impossible  to  close  the\r\n\r\nincome  gap  completely  and  swim  against  this  tide   but\r\n\r\nSingapore should do all we can locally to minimise the income\r\n\r\ngap.  We  must  not  allow  the income  divide  to  become  a\r\n\r\npolitical  divide of the haves and have-nots. We should  take\r\n\r\nevery  opportunity  to  emphasise  job  training  and  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading  for  the bulk of the population, especially  those\r\n\r\nolder  workers who need to re-adapt and retrain for  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I dare say that we indeed have a good\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  we should be thankful that we  have  a  good\r\n\r\nGovernment, and we should support this pay revision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate on the Statement made by the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister be exempted at this day's sitting from the\r\n\r\nprovisions of Standing Order No. 1.  -  [Prof.\r\n\r\nS.

I am  not  sure  whether  he\r\n\r\nintended  to  echo  what Mr Inderjit Singh had  earlier  said\r\n\r\nabout the job of political office holders - whether that  was\r\n\r\nthe real point.  But I think he will agree with me, observing\r\n\r\ngovernments in different parts of the world, that there is no\r\n\r\nriskier  job  than that of a political office.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nrisk may be different but the job is no less risky.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

But now in the\r\n\r\nPSL  scheme,  those  appointed  to  the  top  jobs  would  be\r\n\r\nappointed  for 10 years and, after that, they would  have  to\r\n\r\nleave.   Now  it is not quite the same as the private  sector\r\n\r\nbut there is a limit as to how long the person will serve  in\r\n\r\nthat  job  and  that does not mean that if the person  really\r\n\r\nfumbles  in the job, he will not be removed. I do  not  think\r\n\r\nthat is the intention of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this afternoon, Members debated a full hour on\r\n\r\nthe  widening income gap.  The numbers that were released  by\r\n\r\nDPM BG Lee puts this in sharp focus.  Members\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  observe  how  much the income gap has  widened  in  top\r\n\r\ntalent  and the workers in the factory. This trend,  however,\r\n\r\nis  not a Singapore phenomenon.  I have been associated  with\r\n\r\nthe  trade  unions for 20 years.  It is my  job  to  see  how\r\n\r\nothers  pay  workers  elsewhere and what  incomes  were  like\r\n\r\nbetween  management and workers. I know that this  trend  has\r\n\r\nits origins in the United States.  In the 1980s, US companies\r\n\r\nrestructured  and re-engineered to regain the competitiveness\r\n\r\nthey had lost to other MNCs, particularly the Japanese.   One\r\n\r\nof  the  key  changes  they  made  was  to  provide  new  and\r\n\r\nattractive  incentive  schemes to top  executives,  the  most\r\n\r\nsignificant  of  which are stock options.  The  stock  option\r\n\r\nmessage  is clear.  If you make the company grow, your  share\r\n\r\nin it grows as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the 1990s, US companies had regained their vitality.\r\n\r\nNew  ideas  emerged, using new technology. As the revitalised\r\n\r\nUS  companies sweep the competition, MNCs elsewhere  followed\r\n\r\nthese successful United States models.  In Europe, the United\r\n\r\nKingdom  led  the way and these methods are now spreading  in\r\n\r\nWestern  Europe.  Indeed, there is an on-going debate  raging\r\n\r\nin  some  continental European countries steeped in socialist\r\n\r\nthinking.  They  ask:  are the wages of top earners  obscene?\r\n\r\nEuropean  MNCs  are  not waiting for the conclusion  of  this\r\n\r\ndebate  -  they  have  to survive, and  therefore,  they  are\r\n\r\nfighting  for  their  share of top talent  who  will  make  a\r\n\r\ndifference to their future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the result? Under the administration of Tony\r\n\r\nBlair's  New Labour, the income gap in the United Kingdom  is\r\n\r\nnow wider than it ever was during the Thatcher years!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Socialist Finance Minister, Laurent Fabius could\r\n\r\nnot  persuade one top talent he wanted to join and  work  for\r\n\r\nhim.  Why?   He  was  locked up by  his  company  with  stock\r\n\r\noptions!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Japanese have taken notice. They too, are\r\n\r\nbeginning to embrace\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican methods. They have started to employ non-Japanese to\r\n\r\nlead  their troubled companies and I am sure that  they  must\r\n\r\npay  top  wages to get those foreigners to work for  Japanese\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people ask: can we stop the income gap from\r\n\r\nwidening?   In  other  words,  let  the  Americans  and   the\r\n\r\nEuropeans  and even the Japanese go their way and let  us  go\r\n\r\nour way. This is unrealistic. We cannot buck the trend.  Ours\r\n\r\nis  rated  as  the  most globalised economy by  one  research\r\n\r\ncompany,  AT  Kearney reported in The Economist.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nwhat  happens elsewhere will come to pass here as  well.  Our\r\n\r\ntop  talent  will compete for jobs at top first world  wages.\r\n\r\nGo to New York, Silicon Valley, London, Hong Kong or Tokyo  - you  will find some of our best talents there. They are  paid\r\n\r\nwhat  top  talents in the world are paid.  Many of them  earn\r\n\r\nseveral millions a year and they do so quietly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we want more of our top talent leaving to join first\r\n\r\nworld  companies? Are we satisfied that they do well  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  world countries, creating jobs there? Or  do  we  want\r\n\r\nthem   here,   developing  companies,   creating   jobs   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans?  I think we want the latter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, we still have most of our top talent here.\r\n\r\nBut try to narrow the income gap here by imposing a limit  on\r\n\r\ntop end wages instead of letting market forces work - we will\r\n\r\nmerely  see the migration of our top talent.  The cost  would\r\n\r\nbe  a  sluggish economy, higher unemployment and lower  wages\r\n\r\nacross  the board, not just low wages at the top,  but  lower\r\n\r\nwages  also at the bottom. Far from helping the lower income,\r\n\r\nwe  will  be  consigning  them to third  world  standards  of\r\n\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are concerned about the welfare of the less-skilled lower income families here, which, evidently many\r\n\r\nMembers  are, judging from the debate earlier this afternoon,\r\n\r\nthen we must not only retain our talent but also attract more\r\n\r\ntalent  here.  Only a thriving economy will create good  jobs\r\n\r\nfor all, including the less skilled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must have some of the best talent in Government and\r\n\r\nin the civil service. Some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  say that the wealth of the country is not due  just  to\r\n\r\nthe efforts of Government or the civil service but due to the\r\n\r\nhard-work of the people of Singapore.  True, I agree but  our\r\n\r\nhardworking people need leaders to show them the  right  way.\r\n\r\nIf  we do not have top talent to analyse the problems we face\r\n\r\nand  devise the right policies and plans, all their hard work\r\n\r\nwill be in vain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made my first of several trips to Vietnam in 1992. I\r\n\r\nwas  deeply  impressed by how motivated and  hardworking  the\r\n\r\nVietnamese  people  are.  They had abandoned  the  centrally-planned economy, where everyone was paid almost the same  low\r\n\r\nwages, for the market economy, following what other communist\r\n\r\ncountries had done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made my most recent trip two weeks ago. One\r\n\r\nVietnamese  asked what I think of Vietnam.  Well,  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  progress.  Some Vietnamese are better off.  They  drive\r\n\r\ncars  or motorcycles. Their traffic jams in the evenings  are\r\n\r\nnot  due just to bicycles but also to many motorcycles.   But\r\n\r\nthey could have done a lot better, if their leaders have been\r\n\r\nbolder  in  accepting market-oriented policies.   They  could\r\n\r\nhave  attracted  more investments creating jobs  in  Vietnam.\r\n\r\nInstead,  today  they are planning to export 300,000  workers\r\n\r\noverseas, the solution which Mr Zulkifli might have suggested\r\n\r\nfor  our lower income and low-skilled workers. But I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  that is the way to go, because to send our low-skilled\r\n\r\nworkers  overseas  means paying them  wages  of  third  world\r\n\r\ncountries.  They get a better pay working here in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nVietnamese  workers,  I think, toil harder  than  Singaporean\r\n\r\nworkers but they do not enjoy the quality of life our workers\r\n\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the difference? It is in the quality of\r\n\r\nleadership - in Government and in the civil service.  Without\r\n\r\ncapable  leaders showing the right way, our workers can  work\r\n\r\nhard but see no improvement in their lives.  I do not mean to\r\n\r\ncriticise the Vietnamese government.  The transition  from  a\r\n\r\ncentrally-planned economy to a market economy is not an  easy\r\n\r\none.  But the point is: hard work by the people alone is  not\r\n\r\nenough; the policies must be right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want Singaporeans to toil hard for little\r\n\r\nreturn.   We want them to have good jobs here.  We want  them\r\n\r\nto  be  better  skilled, more productive and  earning  higher\r\n\r\nwages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our economic recovery is firm, let us not\r\n\r\nunderestimate the problems that we face.  The transition that\r\n\r\nwe  have  to make into the knowledge economy is not  an  easy\r\n\r\none.   At  the  same time, many of the jobs we now  have  are\r\n\r\nunder threat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have done well in a number of areas. But this\r\n\r\nsuccess  does not guarantee the future.  We have  to  draw  a\r\n\r\nlesson from the Fortune Top 100 list.  In 20 years, the names\r\n\r\nat the top are quite different!  So even in the sectors where\r\n\r\nwe are rated among the best, we can be left behind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, the port of Singapore. It has been\r\n\r\nour  lifeline  since  the founding of modern  Singapore.   In\r\n\r\nrecent years, we have seen how new ports close by can pose  a\r\n\r\nreal challenge to PSA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Changi Airport. It has developed into the leading\r\n\r\nhub  in  the region, even though, geographically, Bangkok  is\r\n\r\nbetter  sited.  But this position may not last forever.   Two\r\n\r\ndays  ago,  I flew back from London.  The Singapore  Airlines\r\n\r\nflight was almost full.  However, most of the passengers  did\r\n\r\nnot  stop  over  in  Singapore.   The  majority  changed   to\r\n\r\nconnecting flights to Australia.  Good business for  SIA  and\r\n\r\nChangi  Airport, but not our hotels or shops.  The  same  day\r\n\r\n(27th  June) at noon, I read in the New Paper that  with  the\r\n\r\nnew  Boeing  747-400 and flight paths over China, Qantas  can\r\n\r\nfly  London-Sydney refuelling at Bangkok,  cutting  one  hour\r\n\r\nfrom the journey.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is only the harbinger of things to come. In a few\r\n\r\nshort  years,  a new generation of aircraft can  fly  London-Sydney  non-stop.  So will most of those who commute  between\r\n\r\nEurope and Australia over fly Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will Changi face the same fate as Honolulu? Honolulu\r\n\r\nused  to  be  a  stop-over  for  trans-Pacific  flights,  but\r\n\r\naircraft  now fly non-stop across the Pacific.   Will  Changi\r\n\r\nface the same fate as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nairports  in  the Middle East, once a necessary stop  between\r\n\r\nAsia and Europe?  What implications have this development for\r\n\r\nSingapore  Airlines?  What new strategies must  it  adopt  to\r\n\r\nremain  one of the leading airlines in the world, maintaining\r\n\r\n25,000  jobs it creates, mostly for Singaporeans, and we  are\r\n\r\nnot talking about jobs for the lower 10% of Singaporeans.  We\r\n\r\nare talking about good jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take another example: the telecommunications sector.\r\n\r\nTechnology has changed so fast in this sector, and the ground\r\n\r\nrules  have  likewise  changed.  Today SingTel  has  a  tough\r\n\r\nchallenge  to remain a national champion generating thousands\r\n\r\nof  good  jobs for Singaporeans.  In order to strengthen  our\r\n\r\nchances  of  remaining  our  telecommunications  hub  in  the\r\n\r\nregion, we have opened up the sector, adding greater pressure\r\n\r\non SingTel.  Better to open up, create jobs for Singaporeans,\r\n\r\neven if they work for foreign companies, than to continue  to\r\n\r\nprotect SingTel and risk losing everything.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are but three examples. They show that we are not\r\n\r\njust competing with countries in the region, we are competing\r\n\r\nglobally.   Therefore,  we need to get  the  best  talent  in\r\n\r\nGovernment,   in  the  civil  service  and  in  our   leading\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If US companies, European companies and, most likely,\r\n\r\nalso the Japanese companies all pay top wages for top talent,\r\n\r\nwe  will  see top end wages here rise as well, if we  are  to\r\n\r\nretain  and  attract our share of talent to  tackle  the  new\r\n\r\nchallenges before us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The income gap may widen, but it will widen because\r\n\r\nwages  will rise much more slowly at the lower end.   But  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mean that there is no improvement in the lives  of\r\n\r\nthose at the bottom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the income gap stop widening? At this stage of our\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  it will widen further, but it will  slow  down.\r\n\r\nEven   in   the  United  States,  the  gap  will  not   widen\r\n\r\nindefinitely.  It must also plateau off, even swing back  and\r\n\r\nnarrow somewhat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed,  the  dip in the Dow Jones index and Nasdaq  recently\r\n\r\nhas,  in  many  instances, reduced the variable payments  top\r\n\r\nexecutives get.  One day it may be a more prolonged dip.   If\r\n\r\nthat  happens, it will happen here as well.  When  that  will\r\n\r\nbe, it is difficult to predict.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our task is to get people in Government and in the civil\r\n\r\nservice  to  devise policies that will ensure  that  the  low\r\n\r\nincome share in the progress of the country, even with  their\r\n\r\nrelatively  lower incomes.  It means successfully  attracting\r\n\r\ninvestments  to  create good jobs for all  our  workers.   It\r\n\r\nmeans  keeping  HDB  flats  affordable,  ensuring  that  good\r\n\r\nhealthcare is available to everyone, that children  from  all\r\n\r\nfamilies  get the best education they deserve.  For  now,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  follow the world-wide trend and pay top talent  the\r\n\r\nhigh  wages they can earn elsewhere.  But more of the  annual\r\n\r\nwage  for them should be variable, as in the private  sector.\r\n\r\nI  am  pleased that  the new wage structure that DPM  BG  Lee\r\n\r\nannounced matches more closely private sector practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from ensuring that our workers continue to have\r\n\r\ngood  jobs,  and  their families continue to enjoy  a  decent\r\n\r\nlife,   we   must  maintain  equal  opportunities  for   all,\r\n\r\nirrespective  of family income.  This has been so  throughout\r\n\r\nour  short history.  The children of poor families have  been\r\n\r\nable to go all the way to university, and then into jobs.  It\r\n\r\nis still so today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I left for London recently, one SATS employee, a\r\n\r\nMuslim  woman,  assisted my mother-in-law with a  wheelchair,\r\n\r\npushing   her  to  the  boarding  gate.   I  had   a   casual\r\n\r\nconversation with her, and found that she was going on  leave\r\n\r\nnext  month  -  on holiday to Canada.  It pleased me that  an\r\n\r\nordinary worker of SATS can afford to take a holiday  so  far\r\n\r\naway.  But what pleased me much more was her telling me  that\r\n\r\nshe would be visiting her son who is there studying to become\r\n\r\na  doctor.   So our system today allows children from  humble\r\n\r\nfamilies  to  rise to the top!  We must make sure  that  this\r\n\r\nremains  so.  And even if we may have to live with  a  higher\r\n\r\nincome disparity than we have been comfortable with, we know\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  next generation, the children from  low-income\r\n\r\nfamilies  also have a chance to get to the top, and draw  top\r\n\r\nwages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our policies must not only ensure everyone has a good\r\n\r\njob,  a  comfortable home and access to healthcare,  we  must\r\n\r\nalso  ensure  that  our  education system  remains  a  social\r\n\r\nleveller that gives every child equal opportunities to go  as\r\n\r\nfar as his abilities allow him or her.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have taken this line in this debate because I\r\n\r\nknow  there  is a lot of concern for the plight of  the  low-income.   There  is concern about this sense  of  unhappiness\r\n\r\nseeing  others  earn top wages, and that maybe  the  solution\r\n\r\ncould be to narrow the income gap.  But to me, after 20 years\r\n\r\nworking  with the trade unions, I know that the best  way  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the low-income is to ensure that they have a job,  that\r\n\r\nthey  can earn a living and hold their heads high.  And  that\r\n\r\nway is to make sure that we have top talent in Government, in\r\n\r\nthe civil service and also in our companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to\r\n\r\njoin in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, salary revision both in the private sector and the\r\n\r\npublic   sector  attracts  tremendous  attention.   What   is\r\n\r\nimportant for us is to ask ourselves whether salary  revision\r\n\r\nis  essential.  I think it is essential in order that one has\r\n\r\nto  provide some rewards and incentives to attract the  best,\r\n\r\nand  one cannot escape this, whether in the low-income group,\r\n\r\nthe  middle  income  or  the  top bracket,  the  revision  is\r\n\r\nessentially  necessary.   At the same  time,  we  should  ask\r\n\r\nourselves how can we attract good, honest people, people with\r\n\r\nintegrity  and  ability, into the various sectors.   I  think\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  basic question that we have to ask  ourselves,\r\n\r\nthat  if we do not pay respectable rewards and incentives  to\r\n\r\npeople, could we attract them, sustain them, or would  we  in\r\n\r\nthe long run be worse off?  These are basic questions that we\r\n\r\nhave to ask ourselves  and the answer is obvious.  If we need\r\n\r\nto  have  a  versatile  organisation,  versatile  enterprise,\r\n\r\nversatile Government, then we must try and attract  the  best\r\n\r\ninto the public sector and also into the private sector.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprivate  sector always attracts the best all the time because\r\n\r\nthey reward the best through various measures and incentives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the world is changing. We are not competing\r\n\r\namongst ourselves.  We are competing with people outside  and\r\n\r\nin  the  international arena.  The world has become  complex.\r\n\r\nKnowledge  has changed.  There are now borderless industries,\r\n\r\nideas, travel and these are very complex issues that we  need\r\n\r\nto  tackle.  And would Singapore and Singaporeans be able  to\r\n\r\nface  these  challenges of a complex nature  and  how  do  we\r\n\r\nprepare people and encourage and recruit people in the public\r\n\r\nsector?   I think that is a very important question  that  we\r\n\r\nall  have to ask ourselves.  The question is to try  and  see\r\n\r\nhow we can provide them respectable incentives and rewards in\r\n\r\norder that we can get them to give their best.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the working class and the average workers and\r\n\r\nthe  families  in  the heartland, we have  to  ask  ourselves\r\n\r\nwhether  we  would  be better off if we  have  dishonest  and\r\n\r\nincompetent  people managing the Government.  I  am  sure  we\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  better off.  We will be worse  off.   So  the\r\n\r\nquestion  is: how do we, as Singaporeans, make sure  that  we\r\n\r\nattract the best possible people into the public sector?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure Members will agree with me that an effective\r\n\r\ncivil service and a sound political leadership together  with\r\n\r\na  hardworking population are key factors to promote economic\r\n\r\nand  social  progress  of  any nation.   We  have  seen  this\r\n\r\nhappening  in  the  United Kingdom.  They attract  reasonably\r\n\r\ntalented  people into the civil service. We  have  seen  this\r\n\r\nhappening  in  Ireland.  Ireland was at one time  not  really\r\n\r\nmaking  progress  but it has reformed  and  changed.   It  is\r\n\r\nmaking  very good progress today.  The United States,  Canada\r\n\r\nand  new  emerging places have undergone reforms.   Even,  as\r\n\r\nMembers know, Poland, which was a very planned economy, today\r\n\r\nhas  changed.   The leadership has changed.  They  have  been\r\n\r\nable  to  attract  talented people  into  the  Government  of\r\n\r\nPoland.   Mexico is changing.  South Korea, in fact, is  also\r\n\r\nundergoing  reform and changes, despite the problems  of  the\r\n\r\nchaebo.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problems have been created by all these\r\n\r\nchaebos.   They are trying to clean it up.  As Members  know,\r\n\r\nit  requires good people to think through what can  be  done.\r\n\r\nGood  government is a valuable asset to people as  lives  can\r\n\r\nbecome  better.  Therefore, it is very important  for  us  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  attract people of quality  and,  I  say,  most\r\n\r\nimportantly,  people with integrity, into the  civil  service\r\n\r\nand  politics.   In order to do so, we need  to  reward  them\r\n\r\nadequately and also provide them incentives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good insurance for Singaporeans because we\r\n\r\ncontinuously need honest and capable people in Government not\r\n\r\nonly  to  look  after  our assets but  to  build  our  assets\r\n\r\nfurther.   We have accumulated more than $80 billion  but  we\r\n\r\nwill  have  to look after it to build it further so  that  we\r\n\r\nwill remain viable and versatile.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, imagine what poor government can do to the lives of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  when  dishonest  and  less  able   people   are\r\n\r\nattracted into the civil service and politics.  Can  we  make\r\n\r\nprogress?  Not too distant time, we know of the Lim Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment.   See what has happened?  We had a corrupt  civil\r\n\r\nservice.   We  had  inefficient  and  not  competent   people\r\n\r\nmanaging  it.  Many Singaporeans suffered.  Their lives  were\r\n\r\nno better until we had a change of Government in 1959.  So it\r\n\r\nis  not too distant. We should remember that this is not  too\r\n\r\nfar  in  history and I hope people do not have short memories\r\n\r\nthat  such  a  problem can happen.  In many  places,  such  a\r\n\r\nproblem  has come about.  Our public resources and funds  can\r\n\r\nbe  squandered  by people who are dishonest and  incompetent.\r\n\r\nWe  will  all end up as losers as each of us has to carry  at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  the day the public debt created by incompetents\r\n\r\nwho  have found their way into government.  This is happening\r\n\r\nin  many places and I am sure Singaporeans can read about  it\r\n\r\nand the problems are quite real.  We have seen this happening\r\n\r\nright  now  in Latin America, in the Balkans, in  Africa,  in\r\n\r\nAsia  and  nearer in our region.  People are suffering  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  rampant government corruption.  As a result,  the\r\n\r\nbetter off will leave because of instability.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I studied in Hong Kong and I had lots of friends who\r\n\r\nstudied together with me in my post-graduate studies.   Prior\r\n\r\nto 1997, many of my good friends have migrated because of the\r\n\r\nfear  and  concern of political instability  in  the  future.\r\n\r\nThere  are a lot of talented people who have gone to  Canada,\r\n\r\nthe United States and Australia.  I have gone back to revisit\r\n\r\nthem  but  I could not find some of them.  This is  real.   I\r\n\r\nshared,  studied and lived with them in the  hostel.   Today,\r\n\r\nmany  of  them are in many other places other than Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nbecause of political instability.  As a result, Hong Kong has\r\n\r\nlost many of its talents to many of the developed countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the end, I say that if we do not have good\r\n\r\npeople  in  Government and the civil service, we will  be  no\r\n\r\nbetter  and  we cannot guarantee that this cannot  happen  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  provided that we ensure that we have  good  people\r\n\r\nwho can be attracted into politics and Government.  If we are\r\n\r\nnot  careful, we will suffer the same fate.  So it is  better\r\n\r\nthat  we  give our able people in Government and the  private\r\n\r\nsector respectable rewards and incentives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we reward the capable in Government, we\r\n\r\nshould also take care of the well being of the working class,\r\n\r\nie,  the  heartlanders.  The cost of living  is  expected  to\r\n\r\nincrease  and  it  is important that basic services  such  as\r\n\r\neducation,   health,  housing,  transport  and  PUB   charges\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  affordable.  I would like to  ask  the  DPM\r\n\r\nwhether  such  costs will remain reasonable  and  affordable.\r\n\r\nHow would the Government continue to look after the interests\r\n\r\nof the working class?  What plans does it have because we are\r\n\r\nmoving  towards  rewarding  good  Government  servants,  good\r\n\r\nAdministrative  Officers?  Therefore, can we ensure  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  in the civil service people who are of quality so  that\r\n\r\nwe are able to make further progress?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the salary revision and the increases have\r\n\r\nimplications  on consumer cost and create some inflation.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  ask  the DPM whether  one  would  expect  an\r\n\r\ninflationary  trend  which can affect  our  economy  to  some\r\n\r\nextent.  With all these changes, would it have any spiralling\r\n\r\neffect on the cost of living of the ordinary people?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last salary revision, have we been able to\r\n\r\nattract  good  people  into  the  civil  service?   Are   the\r\n\r\nattrition rates manageable?  What is more important  is:  are\r\n\r\nwe  getting people with good public service attitude into the\r\n\r\ncivil  service  since  the changes  instituted  at  the  last\r\n\r\nrevision?   Is the civil service showing dividend  in  having\r\n\r\nmade   further  progress  by  attracting  good  people   into\r\n\r\nGovernment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, we have to ask ourselves whether\r\n\r\na  better  civil service is a good insurance for the  working\r\n\r\nclass Singaporeans.  It is very important for Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nexamine  this.  I must say that it is very important, looking\r\n\r\nat  the Hong Kong context and many other countries nearer our\r\n\r\nregion,  that when we cannot attract honest and  good  people\r\n\r\ninto  Government, ultimately even the poor  has  to  pay  the\r\n\r\nprice.   Many of the poor, the working class, are paying  the\r\n\r\nprice  for  having  incompetent people in Government  and  we\r\n\r\nshould not let this happen in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the salary revision proposed by the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in the past, civil servants gave  people  the\r\n\r\ntypical  impression that they were eating from an \"iron  rice\r\n\r\nbowl\" that could not be broken, and the senior Administrative\r\n\r\nOfficers were holding  \"golden rice bowls\".  Today,  when  we\r\n\r\ndebate on the revision of the salaries of civil servants,  is\r\n\r\nthis  an  implication that more \"iron rice  bowls\"  would  be\r\n\r\nturning into \"golden rice bowls\"?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the major reforms to the civil service in\r\n\r\nrecent years, with all the privatisation and corporatisation,\r\n\r\nwe  will  find that the various personnel incentive  policies\r\n\r\ngiven to the civil service are gradually approaching those in\r\n\r\nthe  private sector. This is inevitable.  The main reason is,\r\n\r\nin  this  era of globalisation and new economy, not only  the\r\n\r\nvarious  countries  are  competing for  talents,  the  public\r\n\r\nsector  and the private sector are also competing for talents\r\n\r\nand  brainpower.   The Government must ensure that the  civil\r\n\r\nservants, who are charged with the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextremely    heavy   responsibility   of   formulating    and\r\n\r\nimplementing  public policies, are of the best calibre.  They\r\n\r\nmust  be  better than those personnel in the private  sector.\r\n\r\nIn  order  to  attain this fundamental condition,  these  top\r\n\r\ncivil   servants  must   be  rewarded  according   to   their\r\n\r\nperformance and even be remunerated substantially. Just  now,\r\n\r\nDPM Lee mentioned that the PSL job cannot be permanent.  They\r\n\r\ncan   only  hold  the  office  for  10  years.   This  is   a\r\n\r\nbreakthrough.   It  is a compromise between  the  \"iron  rice\r\n\r\nbowl\"  system and the high remuneration policy.   Perhaps  we\r\n\r\nshould  change  the title of \"Permanent Secretary\",  lest  it\r\n\r\ngives  people  the  impression that the office  of  permanent\r\n\r\nsecretary   is so permanent that they continue  to  hold  the\r\n\r\noffice forever.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore want to have a good Government,\r\n\r\none  that is of high integrity, one that is honest.  As such,\r\n\r\nin   1994  when  Parliament  debated  the  salaries  for  the\r\n\r\nMinisters,  our  emphasis  was on \"Competitive  Salaries  for\r\n\r\nCompetent and Honest Government\".  I feel that even  in  this\r\n\r\nnew  economy  of  today,  this principle  remains  unchanged.\r\n\r\nToday, as we re-debate this issue, DPM Lee introduced a  more\r\n\r\npractical  and relevant formula.  As the Ministers'  salaries\r\n\r\nare  equated  to the 206th and 367th ranking  among  the  top\r\n\r\nearners in the private sector, I would be grateful if DPM Lee\r\n\r\ncould enlighten us as to what professions these corresponding\r\n\r\npersonnel  in  the  private sector come from.    If  the  top\r\n\r\nmanagement  staff from more professions and more corporations\r\n\r\nare drawing this level of salaries, then our people will have\r\n\r\na better understanding and will be more willing to accept it.\r\n\r\nOur Ministers would have no difficulty handling the types  of\r\n\r\njobs,  and  there  is  no  reason  why  they  should  not  be\r\n\r\nremunerated  as well as the chief executive officers  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this principle, we should also want to \"cherish our\r\n\r\ntalents,  value  our talents and cultivate our talents\".   We\r\n\r\nwant  not only a honest and far-sighted Government, but  also\r\n\r\ncapable  and efficient civil servants.  These are the  wishes\r\n\r\nof the people of Singapore.  We are fortunate to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  both  a  good  Government and a  very  efficient  civil\r\n\r\nservice.  This is indeed most commendable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, in a certain country, although the central\r\n\r\ngovernment has absolute power, the local government officials\r\n\r\ndo  not  observe the rules as they are too far away from  the\r\n\r\ncontrolling authority.  The officials collude with  the  rich\r\n\r\nbusinessmen and the people are the ones who suffer.  The many\r\n\r\nexcellent  policies of the government cannot  be  effectively\r\n\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another country, there is a perfect civil service\r\n\r\nsystem.  The civil service is stronger and more powerful than\r\n\r\nthe  government.  The government is at the mercy of the civil\r\n\r\nservants, and is entangled by money politics.  Likewise,  the\r\n\r\npeople suffer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, although we have a team of highly\r\n\r\nefficient  civil  servants, there are  times  when  too  much\r\n\r\nemphasis  is placed on efficiency at the expense of humanity.\r\n\r\nThey  have sacrificed the \"human touch\".   As such, while   I\r\n\r\nsupport   paying good civil servants handsomely, I also  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Government to strongly promote the plan  to  send  civil\r\n\r\nservants  to  the community to feel the pulse of the  ground.\r\n\r\nThey  must touch the ground, so that they can understand  the\r\n\r\nfeelings  of  the people.  In implementing its policies,  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party Government should make the people  feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  action is for the good of the people. Touch  their\r\n\r\nhearts.   This  is what we call the \"heartware\".   Under  the\r\n\r\nsystem  of  the new economy, the income gap between  the  top\r\n\r\nearners  and the low-income group tends to become  wider  and\r\n\r\nwider.    This  is  inevitable.   We  must  let  the   people\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  for  all the policies  of  the  Government,\r\n\r\ninterest of the people is always the  prime consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this aspect, I wish to commend the performance of the\r\n\r\nCPF  Board.   According to a report of Lianhe Zaobao  on  5th\r\n\r\nApril,  some 7,000  senior citizens, influenced by a  certain\r\n\r\nrumour, rushed to the CPF Board to collect $250  because they\r\n\r\nwere under\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe impression that they might not get the money if they were\r\n\r\nto  go  there late. The staff from CPF Board manifested their\r\n\r\ncare  and concern for these old folks.  They not only saw  to\r\n\r\nit  that these old people get the money immediately, but also\r\n\r\ndeployed extra helpers to move some chairs over for these old\r\n\r\npeople  to  sit  on and treated them very  well.   They  have\r\n\r\ncertainly put to full play the well-intentioned policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in a most vivid manner.  Otherwise, even  a  good\r\n\r\npolicy can turn out to be one detested by the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Service Improvement Unit appointed by Prime Minister\r\n\r\nGoh  Chok  Tong  has  been  actively monitoring  the  service\r\n\r\nstandard  of the various Government departments, and proposed\r\n\r\nmany  people-friendly  services.   Being  a  member  of   the\r\n\r\nmonitoring unit, I am personally  aware of  many efforts  put\r\n\r\nin  by  the  civil  service in this aspect always  with   the\r\n\r\ninterest of the people at heart.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While supporting the revision of salaries for civil\r\n\r\nservants, I would also urge the Government not to forget  the\r\n\r\nworkers who may be drop-outs in our new economic system.   We\r\n\r\nknow  that  skill  upgrading is the  best  security  for  our\r\n\r\nworkers.   However,  many  older  workers   have   difficulty\r\n\r\nupgrading  their  skills.  I hope that our  Government  would\r\n\r\nreview the various policies, so as  to be more focused on how\r\n\r\nto  help  these workers who cannot keep pace with  the  rapid\r\n\r\nchanges  in  our economic system, in order that  these  older\r\n\r\nworkers could also have a stake in our prosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore generally understand and accept\r\n\r\nthe  principle  of  \"competitive salaries for  competent  and\r\n\r\nhonest Government\".  The workers of Singapore also understand\r\n\r\nthat  without  a  good Government and highly efficient  civil\r\n\r\nservants,  we will not be able to attract foreign investments\r\n\r\nand create job opportunities for our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, I went with a group of trade unionists to a\r\n\r\nneighbouring country to attend a conference. While waiting in\r\n\r\nthe  holding room to board the aeroplane, I saw  a  group  of\r\n\r\nlabourers from that country who came to Singapore illegally\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  work, and had to be repatriated after being found out  by\r\n\r\nthe  authority.  Our workers understand  that if  we  do  not\r\n\r\nhave a good Government and good civil servants, they may face\r\n\r\nthe  same  predicament.  However, many workers,  particularly\r\n\r\nthose in the middle and lower income group, are perplexed  as\r\n\r\nto  why many charges are being adjusted upwards before  their\r\n\r\nwages  are adjusted and their CPF contributions are not fully\r\n\r\nrestored.   With the revision of salaries of civil  servants,\r\n\r\nwill it bring about another round of high-salary war when the\r\n\r\nprivate sector boosts up its offers in order to lure the best\r\n\r\ntalents to its fold?  I hope that the Government will monitor\r\n\r\nclosely  the  development in this  aspect,  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nfeelings of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  have heard the Deputy Prime Minister speak  on  why\r\n\r\ncivil  servants are to get more pay, and Ministers too.   But\r\n\r\nafter  all  the adjustments have been made, the  salaries  of\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  and  Ministers will  still  lag  behind  top\r\n\r\nprivate sector incomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people still ask why there is a need to peg the\r\n\r\nsalaries  of  senior  civil servants  and  Ministers  to  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector.  But if we want good quality staff and people\r\n\r\nin the Government, we have to pay the market salary or almost\r\n\r\nnear  market rates.  Senior civil servants play an  important\r\n\r\nrole  in  the  running of the country.  Ministers  have  even\r\n\r\nheavier  responsibilities.  The decisions taken by  Ministers\r\n\r\nhave far-reaching implications, politically, economically and\r\n\r\nsocially.   With a good political leadership,  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nachieved tremendous progress over the years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just look at the GDP for the last few years or when we\r\n\r\nhave  attained self-government.  At the current  prices,  the\r\n\r\nGDP  in  1959  was $2 billion.  In 1969, it  went  up  to  $5\r\n\r\nbillion; $20.5 billion in 1979; $58 billion in 1989; and $144\r\n\r\nbillion  in 1999.  This means that from 1959 to 1999 the  GDP\r\n\r\nhas  grown 71 times, or in percentage terms, 7,100 per  cent!\r\n\r\nThis is not a small increase.  It is not a surprise that some\r\n\r\npeople think the success of Singapore is a miracle.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How has this been achieved? We have often heard of the\r\n\r\nmedia hype about Singapore's economic miracle.  The truth  is\r\n\r\nthat  our economy has grown because Singaporeans as a  people\r\n\r\nhave  worked  together.  The Government is the one  that  has\r\n\r\nbrought  about  this  economic growth.   The  Government  has\r\n\r\nbrought in the confidence.  The data of the GDP that  I  have\r\n\r\ntabled  before you are the achievement that has been  brought\r\n\r\nabout  by  the  Government  which  has  led  us  even  during\r\n\r\nturbulent  times.   It is not only the economic  aspect.   We\r\n\r\nalso  have  political stability because we have a  Government\r\n\r\nthat is sensitive to matters in a multi-racial, multi-lingual\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We enjoy industrial harmony because our unions work\r\n\r\ntogether,  and  not in conflict with employers.   Unions  and\r\n\r\nemployers  are  both  accepted by the  Government  as  social\r\n\r\npartners.   There  are  not  many countries  that  have  this\r\n\r\ncollaborative  system  in  which  we  have  achieved.    Many\r\n\r\ncountries are trying to develop this partnership, which shows\r\n\r\nthat  the  benefits of such collaboration which we have  been\r\n\r\nenjoying  are  recognised.  This cannot be  achieved  if  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  does not have an open mind or has not  encouraged\r\n\r\nsuch   cooperation   or   collaboration.    Therefore,   this\r\n\r\nunderlines the importance of good leadership.  As  a  result,\r\n\r\nwe  have  been  able to maintain social cohesion.   Over  the\r\n\r\nyears,  we have been able to put the social safety  net  that\r\n\r\nhas  provided the minimum standard of protection for society.\r\n\r\nPublic   housing,  education  and  health  care  are  heavily\r\n\r\nsubsidised.  So is  transportation.  Other than that, we have\r\n\r\nalso the asset enhancement scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a good government, we may not have good\r\n\r\ngovernance.  Without a good government, it is impossible  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  achieve  this level  of  social  and  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Without a good government and civil service, we\r\n\r\ncannot maintain this quality of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a trade unionist and also a former journalist, I have\r\n\r\nvisited many countries, rich, poor; big and small.  Generally\r\n\r\nwhat  I  have noticed is that good governance is led by  good\r\n\r\ngovernment and it has helped\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the economic growth and social development of the country.\r\n\r\nThe reverse is true.  Here we have seen how the political and\r\n\r\neconomic structure may be demolished when a government closes\r\n\r\none  eye  on  corrupt practices or the leaders of  government\r\n\r\nthemselves are corrupt.  It does not happen in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nwe should not allow such things to happen in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in order to maintain good leadership in the\r\n\r\nGovernment, our community must be prepared to pay  a  premium\r\n\r\nto  attract  good  talent and high-calibre people  to  be  in\r\n\r\nGovernment or in the civil service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not surprised at reading the report of the\r\n\r\nPolitical and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) based in  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  recently.  According to PERC, the Singapore  Government\r\n\r\nemerged tops among Asian governments for its effectiveness in\r\n\r\neconomic policies.  Singapore is also top in the banking  and\r\n\r\nlegal  systems.  Expatriates feel happy to work in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  clearly  shows that the Singapore Government has  brought\r\n\r\nabout a good life for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we be reluctant in giving this reward to the\r\n\r\nleaders  of Government and senior civil servants?  I  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve  so.   If  we compare what has been  enjoyed  by  the\r\n\r\ncommunity with the salary scales that have been suggested  by\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy Prime Minister, it is not too much.  Would higher\r\n\r\nsalaries  for  senior  civil  servants  or  political  office\r\n\r\nholders create a wider income gap in Singapore?  I think not.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I support the Deputy Prime Minister's statement to\r\n\r\nupgrade  the  quality  of leadership in  the  civil  service.\r\n\r\nHowever,  this does not mean that we are not concerned  about\r\n\r\nthe  income  disparity which is a debatable  issue  recently.\r\n\r\nAlthough  we  cannot  stop  this widening  income  gap  in  a\r\n\r\ndeveloping  economy, especially so in a KBE, we should  avoid\r\n\r\nsocial  tension  as  a result of this income  gap.   We  must\r\n\r\nalways  assist the lower income group to upgrade  themselves,\r\n\r\nto have good skills and a higher and stable income.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, I think people would not question the\r\n\r\nsalaries  of  Ministers or senior civil  servants.   But  the\r\n\r\npeople want to know if the Government would continue to  care\r\n\r\nfor  their  welfare.  Every citizen is important to  us  all,\r\n\r\nwhether  he  is  the  poor or rich;  the  educated  or  less-educated; or has skill or without skills.  We should help the\r\n\r\nchildren  of  every  family to achieve the highest  education\r\n\r\naccording  to  their  ability.  We  are  fortunate  that  the\r\n\r\nmeritocractic  system  that is in  place  always  allows  the\r\n\r\nchildren  of  the  poor  families  to  move  upward   through\r\n\r\neducation.  So no one needs to feel that they are caught in a\r\n\r\npoverty   trap.   In  Singapore,  there  are   many   schemes\r\n\r\nimplemented  by  the  Government to assist  the  unfortunate.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  have budget surpluses, the Government tops  up  the\r\n\r\nCPF.  The grassroots bodies and charities also help the poor.\r\n\r\nTrade  unions  also render their assistance.   On  the  union\r\n\r\nfront,  each year, the labour movement gives away $1  million\r\n\r\nto  assist  the  children from poor families  in  educational\r\n\r\nscholarships and bursaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will continue to assist voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations  and  the  trade  unions  so  that  they  could\r\n\r\ncontinue to assist the lower income groups and also to\r\n\r\nensure  that  inflation is maintained at a  low  level.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  help these bodies  to  assist  them  face\r\n\r\ninflation and the challenges of a knowledge-based economy  by\r\n\r\nupgrading their skills so that they will be able to  maintain\r\n\r\nand  have a stable job.  We are able to do all this and  also\r\n\r\nto  avoid  adverse  social consequences if  we  have  a  good\r\n\r\ngovernment and a good civil service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal of the Deputy Prime Minister in this area\r\n\r\nis good and I support it.  My hope is, as mentioned by Mr Lim\r\n\r\nBoon  Heng earlier, that people should not be envious of this\r\n\r\nsituation  by  just  looking at the figures  that  have  been\r\n\r\nproposed  for  the  senior civil servants and  the  political\r\n\r\nleaders.   We should consider their responsibilities,  duties\r\n\r\nand contributions and what they have to do to lead the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the Deputy Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Thank you, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, for letting me join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.31 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this mechanism in place about five years ago to pay\r\n\r\ncivil  servants and political appointees is now due for  some\r\n\r\nreview  and,  as  mentioned just  now  by  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  giving us some refinements and adjustments,  which\r\n\r\nare  to  be welcomed.  First, in particular, I am very  happy\r\n\r\nthat there is a widening of this group of the top end of  the\r\n\r\nincome  earners to be included in this pegging  and  also  to\r\n\r\ntake  the  median as the average, instead of  just  a  simple\r\n\r\naverage.   I  would  like  to ask,  together  with  the  view\r\n\r\nexpressed by the previous speaker, Mr Seng, that in the light\r\n\r\nof  this new pegging of the rate, at 2/3 of M48 plus the  50%\r\n\r\ndiscount and 12% increase, at the 367th position of the  high\r\n\r\nincome  scale, what is the equivalent range of income earners\r\n\r\nin this position?  What kind of people, what profession, what\r\n\r\ncategory of employment do they belong to?  It would  be  good\r\n\r\nif  the  DPM  can give us some information on this  range  of\r\n\r\nincome  earners  so  that  we can compare  and  see  how  our\r\n\r\nMinisters  and civil servants are paid in relation  to  these\r\n\r\nincome earners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this new salary adjustment for civil servants,\r\n\r\ntwo  particular groups of people would be looking at it  from\r\n\r\ndifferent  views.   One is the higher income  earners  -  the\r\n\r\nprofessionals,  managers,  owners of  shares,  investors  and\r\n\r\nenterprises - who are looking at it from one view.  And  then\r\n\r\nthe other view is really the ordinary man in the street.   It\r\n\r\nis  to  be expected that these two views are quite different.\r\n\r\nTo  the  internationally mobile, the managerial, professional\r\n\r\ntype   with   professional  qualifications   and   managerial\r\n\r\ncompetency  working  in  large  business  organisations,  the\r\n\r\nfigures  are  not  so  intriguing.  It  would  of  course  be\r\n\r\ncorrelated  to the level of performance and reward.   And  in\r\n\r\nthe  high  level  of professional earnings and  international\r\n\r\nMNCs'  top executive earnings, these figures are not  out  of\r\n\r\nthe realm, quite in the ordinary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point raised by one previous Member of\r\n\r\nParliament, Mr Inderjit Singh, about this hazard part of  the\r\n\r\nsalary  reward,  perhaps  the DPM could  clarify  at  another\r\n\r\noccasion whether this hazard part is really taken care of  in\r\n\r\nthe performance-related part of the salary scale.  I believe,\r\n\r\nif  I  am  not mistaken, that this performance is  almost  at\r\n\r\nabout  40%  of the salary.  So there is really quite  a  risk\r\n\r\npart of the salary reward in this performance-related factor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a shareholder or stakeholder in a company were to\r\n\r\nemploy a staff or manager to run the corporation, it would be\r\n\r\nquite rational for him to hire the best team who can deliver.\r\n\r\nAnd  modern  governments and public services  really  require\r\n\r\nknowledge,  skills  and  competency to  match  those  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.  That is how the world is becoming more  and\r\n\r\nmore  global  and governments and business organisations  are\r\n\r\nrelating to each other more and more.  Can you imagine public\r\n\r\nservants  in  the Ministry of Communications and  Information\r\n\r\nTechnology  or the Info-communications Development  Authority\r\n\r\nwho  are  not  able  to  match the  private  sector  business\r\n\r\nexecutives,  the group that they deal with  every  day?   The\r\n\r\npublic  servants  would  be led around  in  circle  by  these\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  business executives, doing no  good  to  the\r\n\r\npublic  interest.  And leaders of the Government of Singapore\r\n\r\nmust  also  deal  with many of the issues  impacting  on  our\r\n\r\nstability,    economic   growth,   investments,   employment,\r\n\r\ntraining,  retraining, rising standards of living  and  homes\r\n\r\nfor the people. These issues that the Government of Singapore\r\n\r\nhas tackled are proven.  The records speak for themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another good example was, what many Members of\r\n\r\nParliament have just now brought forward, how we came out  of\r\n\r\nthis  Asian  financial crisis with relatively little  damage.\r\n\r\nIf  you  were  to look at the performance of governments  all\r\n\r\nacross the world and see how a country came out of this  very\r\n\r\nsevere financial crisis with very little damage, and in  fact\r\n\r\nmuch  strengthened,  then I can see that  there  is  a  great\r\n\r\njustification to reward our civil servants.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having this mechanism in place is not really to just\r\n\r\nreward   present  executives  or  public  servants   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  it  is really to attract top  flight  people  in\r\n\r\nfuture  to join the Government as well as of course to retain\r\n\r\nthem.   And in Singapore, politics is not about the  politics\r\n\r\nof  envy, but of governance to ensure growth, employment  for\r\n\r\n50,000  entrants  to the labour market each year  and  rising\r\n\r\nexpectations  from an increasingly more knowledgable  working\r\n\r\npopulation.   So  the demands are not really  so  simple  and\r\n\r\neasy.   Competition  is  a fact of life  in  this  globalised\r\n\r\neconomy  and we are part and parcel of this.  We are  in  the\r\n\r\ncentre of it.  There is no choice.  MNCs compete and pay  for\r\n\r\nhuman   resource,  not  manpower.   They  bring  these  human\r\n\r\nresource talents from everywhere to anywhere, where they  can\r\n\r\nmaximise  their  returns  on their  business.   And  in  this\r\n\r\nglobalised economy, everyone is in competition in the market.\r\n\r\nIt  is world wide and everywhere, and we cannot run away from\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition for foreign investment is also world wide.\r\n\r\nCountries  engage in this to generate growth  and  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities    for   these   countries.    Investors    and\r\n\r\nshareholders  want the best return.  Talents  also  want  the\r\n\r\nbest  reward.  So paying talent his worth ensures  worthwhile\r\n\r\nvalue  performance.  However, this competition for investible\r\n\r\nresource  is  only half the picture.  The other half  of  the\r\n\r\nstory  is what we have been talking about for some months  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  ie, to encourage entrepreneurship and  growth  in\r\n\r\nour  economy, income and jobs for the local economy.  But  we\r\n\r\nmust realise this.  The same yardsticks apply - remuneration,\r\n\r\nstock options for the local economy.  And what we can see  in\r\n\r\nthis  is  that the new global economy paradigm really  values\r\n\r\nmobility.   Capital moves instantaneously to any place  which\r\n\r\ngives its maximal return, even if briefly.  People move  from\r\n\r\nwhere  they have been born to where their talent of worth  is\r\n\r\ngiven  expression across national boundaries.  And we  cannot\r\n\r\nprevent  that from happening in Singapore.  People come  here\r\n\r\nto  work because employers find it worthwhile to employ them.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nventure overseas because they are valued and are engaged with\r\n\r\nthe  special  skills and competitiveness and are  paid  their\r\n\r\nworth  for  this.   We  cannot have  one  set  of  evaluation\r\n\r\ncriteria for people in the private sector and another set for\r\n\r\nthe Government public sector.  We are kidding ourselves if we\r\n\r\ndo,  particularly so in Singapore.  I have just read a report\r\n\r\nyesterday.  The Singapore Government is again voted the least\r\n\r\ncorrupt in this index.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is running the Government the same as running a\r\n\r\ncorporation?   My view is that modern government has  changed\r\n\r\nso  much because of technology, and public demands are almost\r\n\r\nas  fickle  as  consumer  demands.   And  the  Government  of\r\n\r\nSingapore is quite unique in this respect.  It owns  and  has\r\n\r\nmany GLCs.  I believe the contribution or size of our GLCs in\r\n\r\nthe  total  economy  is  of  very substantial  figures  which\r\n\r\noperate  in the private sector.  When the Government servants\r\n\r\nare  seconded for a term or two in the private sector in  the\r\n\r\nGLCs  for exposure, as they do now, under this new scheme  to\r\n\r\ntrain  and  expose  our public servants, can  one  imagine  a\r\n\r\nsenior  civil servant who, by his years of achievements  from\r\n\r\nschool  to  adult work, has to accept and work with  a  lower\r\n\r\nsalary  than  a  private  sector  senior  executive?   It  is\r\n\r\nunrealistic, especially if he has to undertake more important\r\n\r\nassignments  for the company or the shareholder  who  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of Singapore.  How much more unrealistic to expect\r\n\r\nthe  bosses of these senior civil servants, the Ministers and\r\n\r\nthe office holders to be paid less than these executives?  So\r\n\r\nthere   must   be   a  scale  of  value  and   a   scope   of\r\n\r\nresponsibilities to jobs,  we must not be afraid to attach to\r\n\r\nmen  holding  these offices to safeguard our livelihood,  our\r\n\r\nhomes, our lives and our national well-being.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours is an upward mobile society. Just now, the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the NTUC mentioned this point about  how\r\n\r\nhe  was so impressed by the lady who is working in SATS going\r\n\r\nto  Canada  to  see her son who is studying to be  a  doctor.\r\n\r\nThere  are  many  examples of such cases in  Singapore  where\r\n\r\nparents   and  children really move up very fast  because  of\r\n\r\ntheir achievements.  And I can give another example.  In\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQueenstown where I am representing  -  Queenstown is an  area\r\n\r\nwith  very  old  three-room flats  -  I have come  across  an\r\n\r\nordinary  police  staff with two children, one  graduated  at\r\n\r\nHarvard,  another one graduated at Oxford, both on Government\r\n\r\nscholarships.  It is quite unheard of anywhere in the  world.\r\n\r\nBut  our  society allows such people to come out and move  up\r\n\r\nacross the social structure by means of their achievement and\r\n\r\ncapability.  I hope the Singapore Government will make a  re-commitment to the mobility and flexibility in our society for\r\n\r\npeople to achieve and  maximise their potential.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not short-change our people who are in the\r\n\r\npublic  service by restricting their rewards and the  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich  they can generate the income and wealth for their  own\r\n\r\nfamilies,  expecting  everything  will  fall  in   place   by\r\n\r\nthemselves.   Things may well fall apart.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to address the issue of income gap which\r\n\r\nmany  people  have been talking about.  The issue  of  salary\r\n\r\nreview  and adjustments for civil servants and Ministers  and\r\n\r\noffice  holders  really  should not  be  mixed  up  with  the\r\n\r\ndiscussion  on  income gap.  And I perfectly share  the  view\r\n\r\nexpressed by Mr Lim Boon Heng that the income gap will not be\r\n\r\ngetting closer when there is economic growth.  In fact,  this\r\n\r\nis a very common phenomenon.  Economic development economists\r\n\r\nhave   been  studying  this.   Whenever  there  is  sustained\r\n\r\neconomic  growth, income gap widens.  The only  countries  in\r\n\r\nthe  world  where  income  gap  is  narrowing  are  the  poor\r\n\r\ncountries getting poorer.  The gap is completely closed  when\r\n\r\neverybody  earns  the  same  income.   Proponents   of   this\r\n\r\nphenomenon remind me of some defunct ideology that  has  been\r\n\r\nproven not to work.  The proper concern is really to level up\r\n\r\nthe  low  income  households, not to worry about  the  income\r\n\r\ninequality  gap,  or to close it.  And this levelling  up  of\r\n\r\nincome households can be done by an appropriate wage increase\r\n\r\nin  competition  in  the market and by  widening  our  social\r\n\r\nsafety  net infrastructure which the Government of  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  been  adequately  providing.   But  the  Government,   I\r\n\r\nencourage, should\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntake  more efforts to examine these areas where there can  be\r\n\r\nmore  safeguards, more opportunities to allow for access  for\r\n\r\nour  workers  to  good  public  health,  public  housing  and\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers should ask whether their income and employment\r\n\r\nopportunities have improved over the past few years,  whether\r\n\r\ntheir  companies have done better as a result of  appropriate\r\n\r\nremedial policies of the Government in the wake of this Asian\r\n\r\nfinancial crisis and the re-emergence of competition from the\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries especially with  a  new,  much  lower\r\n\r\nexchange  rate  regime in these countries.  They  are  really\r\n\r\ngiving  Singapore  the  real  competition,  unless  we   move\r\n\r\nourselves  up  into  higher technology end.   And  Government\r\n\r\nshould respond by ensuring that there is room in society  for\r\n\r\neveryone  to  be  upward mobile by education,  training,  re-training, skills acquisition, giving them equal opportunities\r\n\r\nand  access to all levels of society by dint of their success\r\n\r\nand achievements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Government for re-commitment for\r\n\r\nmaximising  the  potential of everyone  throughout  his  work\r\n\r\nlife,   to  have  the  necessary  skills,  preparations   and\r\n\r\nopportunities  to stay employable, to have affordable  access\r\n\r\nto  health,  education and housing.   And  I  ask  my  fellow\r\n\r\nSingapore workers to be concerned about this rather  than  to\r\n\r\nbe concerned about closing the income gap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to re-dedicate ourselves to this\r\n\r\nprecept  of  Singapore 21 where every Singaporean matters  to\r\n\r\nenable everyone to maximise and achieve his potential.  That,\r\n\r\nto  me,  is a very tall order and I say let us hire the  best\r\n\r\npeople for the job.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. Shanmugam (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I have always spoken\r\n\r\nin  support  of  pay rises for Ministers and  civil  servants\r\n\r\nstrongly, and I do so again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many will welcome or at least not question the rises for\r\n\r\ncivil  servants.   However, the focus will be  on  Ministers'\r\n\r\nsalary  rises.  This is a hot topic and has always  been  so.\r\n\r\nOn  this  topic,  there is really only one question:   do  we\r\n\r\naccept\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat Ministers' salary should be referenced to top earners in\r\n\r\nthe private sector?  The answer is really a no-brainer.  This\r\n\r\nis not a new point.  It was established in 1994 when salaries\r\n\r\nwere  linked  to  top  incomes outside.   But  despite  this,\r\n\r\nquestions  will again be asked when Ministers'  salaries  are\r\n\r\nincreased.  It is these three common questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two are questions of principle and the third\r\n\r\nis the question of detail. The first question of principle is\r\n\r\na  suggestion by some that, in absolute terms, Ministers  are\r\n\r\nalready  earning  top  salaries and  that,  therefore,  their\r\n\r\nsalaries  should  not be increased further.  This  suggestion\r\n\r\noverlooks a basic point.  That is the point about relativity.\r\n\r\nRegardless  of actual numbers, can we have too  large  a  gap\r\n\r\nbetween  public and private sector incomes?  If  there  is  a\r\n\r\nlarge gap, then do we honestly expect to get the best for the\r\n\r\ntop  public sector?  In these matters, one has to  be  honest\r\n\r\nand  not hypocritical.  We want the most talented in Cabinet.\r\n\r\nWhy not pay them what they would get outside?  $34 million is\r\n\r\ncheap  to  pay  for  a corrupt-free, top quality  Government.\r\n\r\nLook  around  in  both  developed  countries  and  developing\r\n\r\ncountries  and  see  what  happens  when  people  stinge   on\r\n\r\nGovernment salaries.  You do not want your Ministers who take\r\n\r\nfavours  from private sector people to take free holidays  or\r\n\r\nstay in their hotels, as has happened in developed countries.\r\n\r\nThat cheapens the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us pose the question another way. If we approach\r\n\r\nthe  question  de  novo and without political  consideration,\r\n\r\nwould  we  only  rank  that  a Minister's  job  as  being  as\r\n\r\nimportant as that of the 200 top earners outside?  Should  we\r\n\r\nnot have people in the top 50, in fact, the top 20, and if we\r\n\r\nhave  such people in the Cabinet, is it then fair to pay them\r\n\r\nwhat  the  200  earners outside earn?  Yet,  with  all  these\r\n\r\nrevisions, that is what the proposal aims at, and even  that,\r\n\r\nit  will  only  be  achieved in the year 2003.   Any  private\r\n\r\norganisation that does that will simply lose their talent and\r\n\r\nwill end up as a secondary organisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, for the first question, the focus should not\r\n\r\nbe  on  absolute numbers.  It should be on relative  linkage.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have to realise that as a result of the  growing\r\n\r\neconomy, incomes have indeed risen and yes, there is a  large\r\n\r\nincome  gap.  It  is a fact. At the top, our  people  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate   sector  command  world-class  income.   We   cannot\r\n\r\nrealistically pay our Ministers any less.  What  we  have  to\r\n\r\nhope  for is that over time, the right policies and education\r\n\r\nwill  help a much larger proportion of the population to reap\r\n\r\nthe full benefits of becoming a world-class economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the second question that is often\r\n\r\nasked.  Even among those who accept the principle that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  a  linkage  between  public  and  private  sector\r\n\r\nsalaries, the question that is often asked is whether we  do,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  have Ministers who command these incomes  outside.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a sensitive question but it misses the central  point\r\n\r\nwhich  we  are  discussing now. The  point  of  principle  is\r\n\r\nwhether  we  accept  that  the Ministers'  salaries,  without\r\n\r\nreference  to individuals, should be at least equal  to  what\r\n\r\nthe 200 earners outside earn, having regard to the importance\r\n\r\nof  the  job  and the pressures of the job. If we agree  with\r\n\r\nthat  principle, then the salaries should be adjusted to that\r\n\r\nscale.  It does not matter whether specific individuals,  who\r\n\r\nare  Ministers,  would  be  able to  command  those  salaries\r\n\r\noutside.   That  is  a systemic issue.  We  should  agree  on\r\n\r\nprinciples    and   not   let   arguments   over   individual\r\n\r\npersonalities dictate the principles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On detail, the question that is often asked is, in the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector, the list of individuals who are top  earners\r\n\r\nmay  change  from  year  to  year.   By  linking  ministerial\r\n\r\nsalaries  only  to  incomes,  the  question  is  whether  the\r\n\r\nministerial salaries are protected from the vagaries  of  the\r\n\r\nmarketplace which may affect top private sector earners,  and\r\n\r\nwhether  over time, the Ministers would, in fact,  earn  much\r\n\r\nmore than any specific individual outside.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, that question overlooks a central principle\r\n\r\nwhether there should be a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlinkage  between  a  Minister's job  and  his  specific  rank\r\n\r\noutside.  It does not matter who the individuals are, whether\r\n\r\nin  the  public or private sector. The salary of  a  Minister\r\n\r\nshould  be  linked to a range in the private  sector  because\r\n\r\nthat  is  what  the  Minister's  job  is  worth.   Then   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  ensure  that its  Ministers  are  of  the\r\n\r\ncalibre  to  command  such  incomes,  whether  they  are   in\r\n\r\nGovernment  or  out of Government.  It is  like  saying  what\r\n\r\nsalary will you pay a CEO of a major bank.  There will  be  a\r\n\r\nbase  which  will be high, regardless of the individual,  but\r\n\r\nspecific individuals may get differing bonuses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after all these revisions, frankly, the ministerial\r\n\r\nsalaries,  are still not competitive. The world  outside  has\r\n\r\nchanged and salaries are increasing outside and they are only\r\n\r\npart  of  the picture. The investment opportunities that  are\r\n\r\navailable  to  private sector professionals  are  simply  not\r\n\r\navailable  to Ministers.  With the changing environment,  the\r\n\r\nbest outside can make a vast fortune in the new economy which\r\n\r\nwill make these ministerial salaries appear loose change.  Do\r\n\r\nwe  or  do we not believe that at least some of our Ministers\r\n\r\ncan make that kind of money if they went outside?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister's job is a thankless job if he looks at it\r\n\r\nas   a   job.   The  pressures,  the  public  scrutiny,   the\r\n\r\nimponderables are such that you have to really approach it as\r\n\r\na calling rather than as a job.  And this country, as most of\r\n\r\nthe  countries  now, is competing at an increasingly  complex\r\n\r\nenvironment and without natural resources and with  only  our\r\n\r\npeople to go by, good stewardship is now at a premium and  it\r\n\r\nis all the more important that we get the best.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me end by saying this. I have said it before\r\n\r\nbut  I strongly believe it and will repeat it.   When someone\r\n\r\nsuitable is identified and is asked to become a Minister, you\r\n\r\nonly want him to ask himself the following three questions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Am I intellectually good enough?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Can I do the job?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Do I want to do the job?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not want him to ask a fourth question: can I\r\n\r\nafford it?  If that question is asked, we have failed.   Sir,\r\n\r\nI support the changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  my  Parliamentary colleagues have brought  up  some\r\n\r\nvery important points in support of the Ministerial Statement\r\n\r\nmade by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add a few points. Firstly, on CPF. In\r\n\r\n1997/1998,  when  we were facing the Asian financial  crisis,\r\n\r\nour  workers cooperated with the Government.   They  accepted\r\n\r\nthe Government's proposal to cut their CPF benefits by 10% in\r\n\r\nthe employer's CPF contribution.  Today, we are proposing  to\r\n\r\nincrease the salaries of our Ministers and civil servants  on\r\n\r\nthe premise that the economy has recovered.  On this point, I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask whether the Government has a specific time-table for this 10% cut in the employer's CPF contribution  to\r\n\r\nbe fully restored.  The economy has recovered and this is the\r\n\r\ntime we should seriously consider restoring the cut in CPF to\r\n\r\nour workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, today, we announce the rise in the pay for our\r\n\r\ncivil  servants.  Tomorrow, this  will  be  reported  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  The  response from the market  is  usually  very\r\n\r\nfast.  Even  before these announcements were made,  transport\r\n\r\ncharges,  PUB  charges,  taxi fares  have  already  gone  up.\r\n\r\nTomorrow, with the report of pay rise in the newspapers,  the\r\n\r\nvarious  retail  outlets and the hawkers  will  spontaneously\r\n\r\njack up their prices.  As such,  I am worried that the salary\r\n\r\nincrease for civil servants in Divisions III and IV  may  not\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  match the price hike outside.   Although  their\r\n\r\nsalaries  have gone up, their standard of living may actually\r\n\r\ntake  a downturn instead.  I feel that for the civil servants\r\n\r\nin  the  lower-income group, the increase in  their  salaries\r\n\r\nshould  not be computed in terms of  percentage points.   For\r\n\r\nthose  with  a salary of $10,000, a 10% increase  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen $1,000.  But for those earning $1,000, 10% is only $100.\r\n\r\nThey  pay  the same 70 cents for the same cup of coffee.   We\r\n\r\nshould  give  them the increase in real terms  so  that  they\r\n\r\nenjoy a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreal  raise in their income.  Although we may not be able  to\r\n\r\nclose  the gap between the high earners and the low  earners,\r\n\r\nwe should at least try to give the low earners a better deal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the principle for pegging the Ministers'\r\n\r\nsalaries to the top earners in the private sector.  In  1994,\r\n\r\nit was pegged to the top 24 earners and today it is pegged to\r\n\r\nthe top 48 earners. This is an improvement.  But for those in\r\n\r\nthe private sector, those who are the top earners such as the\r\n\r\nCEO  and  the  senior managers, they do not have security  in\r\n\r\ntheir  work.  This year, they may have a high  pay  but  next\r\n\r\nyear, they may not get the same pay. So when we are pegged to\r\n\r\nthe  top  48  earners, they are actually a different  lot  of\r\n\r\npeople from year to year.  So next year, we may be looking at\r\n\r\nanother  group  of  people in the top earning  bracket.  Some\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public feel that this is not  a  very  fair\r\n\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example. There are two aeroplanes\r\n\r\ntaking  off at the same time.  One aeroplane 'P' representing\r\n\r\nthe  public  sector and the other aeroplane 'M'  representing\r\n\r\nthe Ministers.  The two aeroplanes take off at the same time.\r\n\r\nAfter  some  time, aeroplane 'P' has to land to  refuel,  but\r\n\r\naeroplane  'M' can have a refuel in mid-air and it  does  not\r\n\r\nneed  to  land for refuelling.  So in the long run, aeroplane\r\n\r\n'M'  would  have gone faster and further away than  aeroplane\r\n\r\n`P\".   I  feel that we should peg to the same group of people\r\n\r\non  a long-term basis, rather than  changing every year.   In\r\n\r\nthis way, it would be fairer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our income varies according to our economic progress.\r\n\r\nIf  the  economy has gone up, then everyone will enjoy higher\r\n\r\nincome,  and  if the economy is not doing well,   the  income\r\n\r\nwill go down. It applies to everyone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, in this year's Budget, no mention was made of\r\n\r\nthis  proposed  increase in pay for our Ministers  and  civil\r\n\r\nservants.   Since  this pay rise will take effect  from  July\r\n\r\nthis year, which is within the current fiscal year, will  the\r\n\r\nincrease to the civil servants' salaries affect the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice  that will be provided to the members of the  public,\r\n\r\neg,   in  the  Ministry  of  Health,  the  Ministry  of   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  or  the Ministry of National Development?   Will\r\n\r\nthe  service quality be affected because they have  to  spend\r\n\r\nmore  money  to  pay  for the higher salaries  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, I am worried about those who are unemployed.\r\n\r\nIn 1997-1998, because of the financial crisis, quite a lot of\r\n\r\npeople   were  retrenched.   Many  people  could   not   find\r\n\r\nalternative  jobs, particularly those who do  not  have  good\r\n\r\nskills  or those who are more elderly.  They have tried  very\r\n\r\nhard to apply for new jobs, but the success rate is very low,\r\n\r\nmainly  because they are older.  They may be in their 40s  or\r\n\r\n50s  or  they do not possess computer or special skills,  and\r\n\r\nthey are unable to secure new jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years have since passed. Even if they have some\r\n\r\nsavings, they would most probably have been used up  by  now.\r\n\r\nNow  they  face  this problem of not having enough  money  to\r\n\r\nsupport  themselves  and  their  families.   While   we   are\r\n\r\nproposing pay rise to our civil servants, we should also take\r\n\r\nthe  plight of these people into consideration, and show some\r\n\r\nkind of special concern for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have talked a lot about training and retraining. But\r\n\r\nthese training and retraining programmes do not benefit  them\r\n\r\nphysically unless they can have a job with income to  support\r\n\r\nthemselves  and their families.  First of all, the Government\r\n\r\nshould  have an overall plan to look after these  people  who\r\n\r\nare  presently unemployed and to give them some free training\r\n\r\nand  job  opportunities so that these  workers  who  are  now\r\n\r\nunemployed would be able to find jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support what Minister Lim Boon Heng has said. We\r\n\r\nmust  make sure that everybody is employed.  The first  thing\r\n\r\nis  to  have  a  job.  Salary comes second.   We  should  not\r\n\r\ncompare ourselves with others.  If you compare yourself  with\r\n\r\nothers, you will only be frustrated.  So long as you can find\r\n\r\na  job to support your family,   high pay or low pay does not\r\n\r\nmatter so much.  In fact, whether the pay is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigh  or low is a very subjective point.  One important thing\r\n\r\nis  that  we must make sure that everyone has a job, so  that\r\n\r\nhis family can have food to eat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the wage increase\r\n\r\nwhich was announced today is a good thing, in the sense  that\r\n\r\nit   is   in   line   with  the  National   Wages   Council's\r\n\r\nrecommendation  which  actually  gives  recognition  to   the\r\n\r\nsacrifices  of workers during the recession. The other  thing\r\n\r\nis that it keeps faith  -  there is reward for sacrifices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I also accept the economic reality\r\n\r\nthat  you have to pay high salaries to attract and retain   - and the word used  -  talent.   But instead of using the word\r\n\r\n\"talent\", I would prefer \"people with the appropriate  skills\r\n\r\nand  abilities\" that can meet the needs for the work they do.\r\n\r\nTo  pay people their worth is definitely acceptable.  But  in\r\n\r\ntrying  to solve one set of problems, we must also  be  aware\r\n\r\nthat  sometimes we create other problems, and there are  also\r\n\r\nconcerns.  We also have to be aware of what the concerns  and\r\n\r\nproblems are, and try to resolve them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own mind, sitting there and listening, I can think\r\n\r\nof  three  basic concerns which many people have.  The  first\r\n\r\none  is: who pays for the increases?  There are going  to  be\r\n\r\nincreases and it has to be paid.  The normal thing to ask is:\r\n\r\nwill  it  result  in  increases in  fees  and  in  Government\r\n\r\ncharges?  And a lot of costs of living are going up.  Will it\r\n\r\nbe more expensive for ordinary citizens of this country?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is: how do we measure talent? Who are\r\n\r\nthe  talents  -  the right people with the right skills?   We\r\n\r\nbring in people with ability.  We talk about market.  We talk\r\n\r\nabout  efficiency.  And they are very high in IQ.  They write\r\n\r\ngood  papers and have good ideas.  But there is also  another\r\n\r\nimportant  element, which is the feel for  the  people.   The\r\n\r\nemotional  quotient  of  our  top  civil  servants  is   also\r\n\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third thing is that, even at Question Time the\r\n\r\ndiscussion and the debate were that it seems to be  that  the\r\n\r\ndemand for the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nskills  of  a few people at the top are going up.  Therefore,\r\n\r\ntheir earnings are spiralling upwards, and they are going  up\r\n\r\nand  up.  There are people at the lower level whose jobs  are\r\n\r\ngetting casualised, jobs are being outsourced and there is  a\r\n\r\nspiral  downwards,  and the net result is  that  the  gap  is\r\n\r\ngetting  bigger and bigger. We heard that in economic  terms,\r\n\r\nthis  widening gap is inevitable.  But is this  socially  and\r\n\r\nmorally  acceptable?  Will it result in a change  of  values?\r\n\r\nAre we only measuring efficiency in terms of dollars, and  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  money?  I reflect on this and I think one  of  the\r\n\r\nanswers to some of these questions can be found in history.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask whether history can teach us some\r\n\r\nthings,  and  a  few things strike me.  One  is,  in  France,\r\n\r\nduring   the  time  of  Louis  XVI,  they  had  great  income\r\n\r\ndisparity.  When the Queen was told that the ordinary  people\r\n\r\ndid  not  have  bread, she said, \"Give them cake!\"   The  net\r\n\r\nresult was the French Revolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;England, at the same time, was also in a similar\r\n\r\nsituation, but they did not have a revolution.  There were  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  poor people.  Income gaps were very wide and leaders\r\n\r\nwere  out of touch.  I read somewhere that one of the reasons\r\n\r\nwhy there was no revolution in England was attributed to just\r\n\r\none  man  who went from town to town, village to village,  on\r\n\r\nhorseback.   His name was John Wesley.  He basically  gave  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  ordinary people hope  -  hope beyond their difficult\r\n\r\ncircumstances.   He did not just preach and  talk  about  the\r\n\r\nworld to come, but he also converted many of his ideals  into\r\n\r\npractical help, in the sense that he built schools; he housed\r\n\r\npeople  who were in difficulty; he helped the poor;  he  gave\r\n\r\npractical assistance, built orphanages and he helped.  At the\r\n\r\nend  of the day, the ordinary working people in England  were\r\n\r\nmotivated to work hard, to save more, to earn more  and  also\r\n\r\nfrom  their  earnings,  to give back  more,  and  the  social\r\n\r\nstandard  of living changed.  And that was a bit of a  social\r\n\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that comes to mind is that at the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of  the 20th century and at the end  of  the  19th\r\n\r\ncentury, 1% of the US population owned 45% of the national\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwealth.   They had all the ingredients for a great revolution\r\n\r\nor  uprising, but it did not take place.  Europe  had  lesser\r\n\r\ndifferentials  but  they  had  revolutions   -   the  Russian\r\n\r\nrevolution and the Great War.  Why  did it not happen in  the\r\n\r\nUS but happened in Europe?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sit back and I think that one of the reasons is that\r\n\r\nin  the  United  States, everybody had opportunities  through\r\n\r\neducation.   Europe was very class divided.  And one  of  the\r\n\r\nlessons  that I learned and one of the key things is that  we\r\n\r\nalso  need  social  consciousness.  We  cannot  have  a  good\r\n\r\nsociety  whereby people who are eligible and who are entitled\r\n\r\nto  get  their worth is paid less than their worth.  I  think\r\n\r\npeople must get their worth.  But the people who get the high\r\n\r\npay,  who earn well, must also realise that they have to give\r\n\r\nback  something  to society.  And there are also  people  who\r\n\r\nhave lesser abilities, lesser talent than them, and they have\r\n\r\nto  be supported.  It is not just the creation of wealth  but\r\n\r\nit  is also having the right social conditions and stability.\r\n\r\nI  think  we must be aware of this.  When it is very  secure,\r\n\r\nwhen  things  are  very smooth, when we  do  not  have  these\r\n\r\nproblems, many of us will not think about it.  But in  moving\r\n\r\nforward  from these events, the difficulties of the  ordinary\r\n\r\nworkers  who do  find a lot of pressures of cost  of  living,\r\n\r\nsome  of  them find it very difficult to understand why  some\r\n\r\npeople  should earn so much more than they could spend.  But,\r\n\r\nat  the  same  time,  if  these  people  do  explain  and  we\r\n\r\nunderstand that it is for the overall good, it helps.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing we learn is that everybody should have\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  move  up, and  the  best  way  is  through\r\n\r\neducation.   In the US and in many other places,  the  answer\r\n\r\nwas  education,  and there must be social mobility.   Because\r\n\r\nwhen you move up the ladder of success,  sometimes the ladder\r\n\r\nis  slippery,  you  slip.  But when you fall  there  must  be\r\n\r\nsufficient  safety nets.  And along the way in working  life,\r\n\r\nthe  chance  to  move and upgrade is very  important  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety.  Can we have that?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards social safety nets, I would suggest that we\r\n\r\nalso  relook  at our social safety nets.  We have  got  basic\r\n\r\nsafety  nets  of  health,  education,  housing.   These   are\r\n\r\nimportant.   But what is poverty, what is poor, also  changes\r\n\r\nthe relative values.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when I was young, a lot of homes did not have\r\n\r\na  refrigerator.   The  telephone  was  not  in  every  home.\r\n\r\nTelevision  was  not in every home.  But,  today,  these  are\r\n\r\nconsidered very basic.  The UN says that the poverty line  is\r\n\r\nUS$1  a  day.   But  in our society, because  our  norms  are\r\n\r\ndifferent, the poverty line is also different, and it is also\r\n\r\nrelative.  If somebody has it, we also want to keep  up  with\r\n\r\nthe Joneses.  Therefore, we also need to relook at our social\r\n\r\nsafety nets as well as realise that because there is a lot of\r\n\r\ncasualisation of labour at the bottom end,  people feel  very\r\n\r\ninsecure.   We should increase protection for this  group  of\r\n\r\nworkers, because they do not have the bargaining power or the\r\n\r\nskills to earn top wages and they need help.  And on help,  I\r\n\r\naccept  that the best form of social security for anybody  is\r\n\r\nsocial  security with dignity, and that is to have  jobs  and\r\n\r\nhave the pride of being self-reliant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is important that we help our people to\r\n\r\nbe  self-reliant and have the ability to move up.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  key  for  the majority of us would be opportunities  and\r\n\r\nthat  the role of Government beyond economic growth  is  also\r\n\r\nsocial  growth, social cohesion, and cost of living.  And  if\r\n\r\nwe  do  all  that, then I think we will have  people  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety who are strong.  They get stronger, and we know  that\r\n\r\nwe  cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong.   The\r\n\r\nstrong  gets stronger but it is without weakening  the  weak.\r\n\r\nIf we have the right values, then I accept that we should not\r\n\r\nhave  the politics of envy but rather the politics of  saying\r\n\r\nthat \"if this is something that everybody can achieve, I  too\r\n\r\nhave  the  opportunity to get it.  My children can also  have\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to have it\" and therefore everybody wins.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I have no difficulty in accepting\r\n\r\nthat  anybody,  whether it is Ministers, civil servants,  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector and ordinary workers, who deserves should  get\r\n\r\nhis fair worth.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I rise to endorse\r\n\r\nthe  need  for sustaining a suitably and adequately motivated\r\n\r\npublic  sector and for retaining talent as well  as  to  make\r\n\r\nspecific  comments on the changes as outlined by  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said by many of my colleagues on the\r\n\r\nimportance of good and honest Government to our economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial  well being.  So I shall not belabour the point  about\r\n\r\nthe  adverse  consequences of having less  than  upright  and\r\n\r\nincompetent  Government.   Equally  so,  attention  has  been\r\n\r\ncentred on the fast changing global economy and therefore  on\r\n\r\nthe  need for a dynamic, responsive and upright public sector\r\n\r\nto enable us to cope and position ourselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the public sector must continue to work\r\n\r\nclosely   with   the   private  sector,  embracing   economic\r\n\r\nchallenges together as one single team rather than two camps,\r\n\r\nthe  administrator, or even worse, the bureaucracy versus the\r\n\r\nactual  doers.   Hence, the civil service needs  to  be  more\r\n\r\nnimble-footed, more responsive and to be exercising foresight\r\n\r\nas a matter of habit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should add here that we do not begin at zero base. We\r\n\r\ndo  have a civil service that we can justifiably be proud of.\r\n\r\nHowever, the macro competitive landscape is imposing more and\r\n\r\nmore  demands  on  us.  This has great implications  for  all\r\n\r\nlevels  and  grades within the civil service  as  it  is  now\r\n\r\nincumbent  on every public officer to take ownership  of  and\r\n\r\nresponsibility for his Ministry's or Department's mission.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, as employer, must therefore in turn\r\n\r\nensure  that there is sufficient non-quantitative motivation,\r\n\r\nguidance  and  counselling  to  enable  each  public   sector\r\n\r\nemployee to give of his or her best.  For the ones who  still\r\n\r\ntend  to  \"maintain the status quo\" or hide behind a faceless\r\n\r\nbureaucracy, they need to be guided on to individual and team\r\n\r\nexcellence.   Essentially, this is a change  in  culture  and\r\n\r\nmindset.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards this end, the move to highlight and reward\r\n\r\nperformance  is inevitable and much needed. The  emphasis  on\r\n\r\nnurturing  and  preserving credible and competent  leadership\r\n\r\ncannot be overstated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is this very spirit of motivating public sector\r\n\r\nemployees  to  perform at their potential that should  arrest\r\n\r\nour  attention.   The  absolute  numbers  and  the  size   of\r\n\r\nincreases  are,  of course, important and news  worthy.   But\r\n\r\nwhat is more important is that essentially there is a need to\r\n\r\nmaintain  relativities  and  to  approximate  private  sector\r\n\r\npractices, for example, that more will move into the variable\r\n\r\nand  less into the fixed.  The sure thing in the form  of  an\r\n\r\niron  rice  bowl,  fixed  increments  and  salaries  is  fast\r\n\r\nbecoming scarce in the real world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now go on to make comments on the specific\r\n\r\nchanges to benchmarking and the emphasis on performance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, benchmarking. Two questions are frequently\r\n\r\nassociated  with  the  construction of  the  benchmark:   How\r\n\r\nrepresentative it is and the extent of risk that is embodied.\r\n\r\nAs  my colleague, Mr Chay, has also pointed out, by enlarging\r\n\r\nthe  pool  from 24 to 48 professionals and taking the  median\r\n\r\ninstead  of  the average, the modified benchmark  has  become\r\n\r\nmore   representative  and  reduces  the  risk  of   outliers\r\n\r\nproviding an upward bias to the numbers.  However, many  will\r\n\r\nstill  ask  why 48, not 96, or some other larger number.   In\r\n\r\nthis  regard,  I think it will be good for the Government  to\r\n\r\nexplain how the pool size is arrived at.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we note too that the Government recognises that\r\n\r\nstock  options can substantially inflate overall compensation\r\n\r\nand  has  therefore discounted this in the  benchmark.   Once\r\n\r\nagain,  is  halving accurate and will future  refinements  be\r\n\r\nmade to approximate actual proportions in the private sector?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the extent of risk assumption which is also\r\n\r\nassociated with the emphasis on performance.  Sir, many  will\r\n\r\nask how closely does the revamped compensation scheme for top\r\n\r\nleaders\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresemble  that  of the private sector.  In other  words,  how\r\n\r\nmuch  risk does a top public sector leader assume in his  job\r\n\r\nand  career?  With more going into the variable and less into\r\n\r\nthe  fixed, the link to performance and overall economic well\r\n\r\nbeing  is  closer.   This is a move to be  applauded  and  it\r\n\r\nshould not stop here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, as to what would constitute a good performance\r\n\r\nmeasure, for example, using GDP growth as a proxy, there will\r\n\r\nalways  be the challenge of developing a measure that  has  a\r\n\r\nmore   direct  correlation  to  work  across  the   different\r\n\r\nMinistries.   Otherwise, the lack of differentiation  at  the\r\n\r\nindividual  level  may  be  a  source  of  unhappiness.   For\r\n\r\ncompanies,  whether  it  is sales or  profitability  targets,\r\n\r\nthere  is  usually  little ambiguity as they  can  easily  be\r\n\r\ntranslated into individual targets as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, allow me to say that I recognise it is a\r\n\r\ndifficult  balance to strike between the need to  arrest  the\r\n\r\nattrition  of  talent from the public sector and  harmonising\r\n\r\nthe  changes  with  the  overall wage climate  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWhilst  it  is clearly necessary to check and debate  on  the\r\n\r\njustification  for benchmarking, we have to be  mindful  that\r\n\r\nthe checking exercise does not become an emotional tussle and\r\n\r\nderail  us  in our long term quest to be knowledge intensive.\r\n\r\nAs  my  colleague, Dr Vasoo, has alluded to, we would  always\r\n\r\nhave  to  ask  ourselves what the consequences of alternative\r\n\r\nactions or the status quo would be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the larger scheme of things, where employment would\r\n\r\nincreasingly  be  less predictable and less  structured,  the\r\n\r\nindividual  Singaporean's worth will  increasingly  hinge  on\r\n\r\nvalue  creation  for a fast changing economy  at  his  level.\r\n\r\nEssentially, it boils down to having the appropriate attitude\r\n\r\nand response regardless of where one works, whether it is  in\r\n\r\nthe public or private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, I rise to support\r\n\r\nthe  spirit and principles behind the proposals raised by DPM\r\n\r\nLee today.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising compensation levels of Ministers and senior\r\n\r\npublic  servants  has always been an emotive  issue  for  any\r\n\r\ncountry.   Nevertheless, there is a  need  to  reinforce  and\r\n\r\nunderstand the fundamental reasons why it is required at this\r\n\r\nparticular juncture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not just an isolated nation in the rising\r\n\r\nsea  of global trends facing all economies in the world.  The\r\n\r\neffects of globalisation are being felt at the far corners of\r\n\r\nthe  world.   There is now a world benchmark for talent,  and\r\n\r\nnot  just a domestic one.  Mobility of people and the  growth\r\n\r\nof  opportunities in the international arena have  spawned  a\r\n\r\nwhole  new level of the ball game in attracting and retaining\r\n\r\ntalent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By many accounts, our Government and civil service have\r\n\r\nbeen   very   successful,  transparent  and  progressive   in\r\n\r\ntransforming our country and citizens to the top tier in  GNP\r\n\r\nper  capita,  in  education matters, health  and  many  other\r\n\r\nservices.   They  have indeed delivered for  the  nation.   A\r\n\r\nhallmark  of  our  success has been the clear  incentives  in\r\n\r\nrewarding  dedication, efficiency and  results,  with  market\r\n\r\nbenchmarks.  This has ensured that some of our very best  and\r\n\r\nbrightest  continue to serve our country for the  benefit  of\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Government and its bureaucracy have been\r\n\r\nranked  tops by many international benchmarks, not least  the\r\n\r\nrecent  Economist survey on e-Governments  for  which  it  is\r\n\r\nstated  that  we have the largest potential in  enabling  the\r\n\r\nsuccessful transition of the economy and the nation into  the\r\n\r\nnew e-millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all recognise the lure of the dot.coms and its\r\n\r\nability   to  reward  richly.   Similarly  with  the   rising\r\n\r\nprosperity  of the world and enlarged opportunities  for  our\r\n\r\nlimited  talent pool, the opportunity costs to those who  can\r\n\r\ndeliver for the nation have risen.  We can never compare  and\r\n\r\ncompensate  like  for like with the market as  there  is  the\r\n\r\nnoble  duty  of  public  service  attached  to  the  jobs  in\r\n\r\nGovernment.   However, we can certainly give due  recognition\r\n\r\nand reward in as fair and effective a manner as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent PERC report as appeared in the Straits Times\r\n\r\ntoday   ranked  Singapore  tops  for  its  leadership.    Our\r\n\r\nMinisters  certainly  deserve  the  recognition.   They  also\r\n\r\ndeserve  the  adjustments  proposed  in  this  exercise.   In\r\n\r\nparticular,  I applaud the measures to phase the  adjustments\r\n\r\nfor  Ministers' salary over a 3-year period as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nannual  review  to  better reflect the  fluctuations  in  the\r\n\r\nmarket.   This is indeed a testament to the robust  integrity\r\n\r\nof  the  way  in  which we scrutinise and refine  our  system\r\n\r\ncontinuously in the public interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite the logical and rational reasons that had\r\n\r\nbeen  debated  at  length in the past and  to-date  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment faces in attracting and retaining talent, we still\r\n\r\nhave to address some of the emotive and pertinent concerns of\r\n\r\nour citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to raise a few concerns and seek\r\n\r\nclarifications with DPM.  Sir, Singaporeans are  feeling  the\r\n\r\neffects  of  the  recent  increase  in  fees  and  rates,  in\r\n\r\ntransportation,  utilities and other  basic  charges  in  the\r\n\r\neconomy.   There  is  a  fear that  there  could  be  further\r\n\r\nincrease  in  fees,  rates and other  charges  as  a  natural\r\n\r\nconsequence of raising public sector wages.  DPM  has  stated\r\n\r\nearlier today that the proposed increases in salary of public\r\n\r\nservants arising from this exercise will amount to some  $400\r\n\r\nmillion.   I  would like to ask him if this amount  has  been\r\n\r\nprovided for in the current budget.  If not, where would  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure  be funded?  If yes, could we have the  assurance\r\n\r\nfrom   him  that  this  exercise  would  not  lead   to   any\r\n\r\nconsequential  increases  in rates  and  fees  of  Government\r\n\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timing of the exercise is also a source of concern\r\n\r\nfor  a large minority of our population who have yet to  feel\r\n\r\nany tangible effects of the economic recovery.  These include\r\n\r\nfamilies  whose members have suffered retrenchments  or  SMEs\r\n\r\nand  small  businesses that are still finding the environment\r\n\r\ndifficult to successfully operate in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask if the Government has done any\r\n\r\nstudies  into the potential impact on employment  and  wages,\r\n\r\nie, its\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimpact  on  our economic recovery arising from this exercise.\r\n\r\nIf  the consequence of benchmarking public sector wages leads\r\n\r\nto pressure on the private sector employers to follow suit to\r\n\r\nattract  and  retain their own talent by raising wages,  this\r\n\r\nmay  stifle the nascent and segmented economic recovery  that\r\n\r\nwe have benefited so far.  Will DPM comment on this concern?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a related note, rising wages increase the opportunity\r\n\r\ncost  to relocate and discourage Singaporeans to take on more\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial   roles   by  creating   more   \"comfortable\"\r\n\r\nemployees in both the public and private sectors.  This seems\r\n\r\nto   go   against  the  spirit  of  entrepreneurialship   and\r\n\r\nenterprise   that  we  have  been  trying  to  cultivate   so\r\n\r\naggressively in the last one year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater risk averseness and higher opportunity costs in\r\n\r\nthe  public and private sectors will reduce labour  mobility.\r\n\r\nThere   may  be  less  incentive  as  a  result  to   exploit\r\n\r\nopportunities as fast as we should be.  Would  DPM  therefore\r\n\r\nbe  able to comment on any expected effects this exercise may\r\n\r\nhave on slowing the initiative for greater enterprise in  our\r\n\r\neconomic model, which is essential to our survival in the new\r\n\r\nmillennium?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the proposal but would like DPM to\r\n\r\naddress some of the concerns I have raised arising from  this\r\n\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, this is not an easy\r\n\r\nmatter  to debate.  Salaries of Ministers and civil  servants\r\n\r\nare  a  matter of intense public scrutiny.  Public funds  are\r\n\r\ninvolved.   Many  perceive Members of  this  House  as  being\r\n\r\njudge, jury and beneficiary and ultimately it is an extremely\r\n\r\nemotive issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore glad that the Government has chosen to\r\n\r\nadopt  an open and transparent approach to this debate.   One\r\n\r\nwould  imagine  for  a  matter which  is  fraught  with  such\r\n\r\nproblems,  the instinct would be to shirk away  from  debate.\r\n\r\nBut  this Government has not done that and it has placed  all\r\n\r\nthe facts on the table for Singaporeans to look at openly and\r\n\r\nconsider.   It is typical of this Government's  style  and  I\r\n\r\nwelcome it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the need for top talent in the public sector is, in\r\n\r\nmy  mind,  very obvious.  The public and private sectors  are\r\n\r\ntwin  engines of growth.  Public sector capacity is  critical\r\n\r\nfor  the  growth of our nation.  It is difficult to think  of\r\n\r\nany country where the public sector has been weak or slovenly\r\n\r\nin  its  response to challenges and which has yet managed  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  and  sustain  consistent growth  and  economic  and\r\n\r\ndevelopmental success.  There are a few where there  is  this\r\n\r\nasymmetry and in those cases the benefits have been  in  very\r\n\r\nnarrow pockets and not sustainable.  The public sector  is  a\r\n\r\nkey  determinant  of  the  enabling conditions  for  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  and broad-based development.  These include not  just\r\n\r\nphysical  infrastructure but the laws and policies, education\r\n\r\nsystem, law and order, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the bottomline is we cannot fly as high or as fast\r\n\r\nwith  only one engine firing.  If we accept the need for  top\r\n\r\ntalent in the public sector, we must be ready and willing  to\r\n\r\npay  competitively.  Only then can we hire the  best,  demand\r\n\r\nthe  best,  and  make  no  apologies  for  it.   Charity  and\r\n\r\nsacrifice  is  best  left  to the individual  to  decide  for\r\n\r\nhimself or herself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think back to the time when I joined the\r\n\r\nAdministrative  Service in 1987.  Over a  period  of  six  to\r\n\r\nseven  years, three-quarters of my cohort resigned  and  left\r\n\r\nfor  the  private sector.  This was before the civil  service\r\n\r\npay  adjustments  were introduced in 1994.   These  are  good\r\n\r\nfriends  and they are no less loyal to Singapore than anybody\r\n\r\nin  this  Chamber or any other Singaporean.   But  they  left\r\n\r\nbecause of the economic realities.  They too had needs.  They\r\n\r\nhad  families.  They had children.  They had mortgages to pay\r\n\r\nand  they had expectations and aspirations commensurate  with\r\n\r\ntheir  talent.   It was quite unrealistic to expect  them  to\r\n\r\ntake  a substantial reduction in pay when they could see what\r\n\r\nthey  could command out there.  So they left.  And they  felt\r\n\r\nthat  they could continue to contribute to Singapore in other\r\n\r\nways, and many of them still do.  But the bottomline again is\r\n\r\nthat  the civil service and the public sector was the  poorer\r\n\r\nfor their departure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question then is how much is enough. Sir, this is\r\n\r\nsubjective.  We have a formula.  Is it too high?  Is  it  too\r\n\r\nlow?   Or is it right?  We could perhaps look at it from some\r\n\r\nangles.   The  first  question to ask is  really:  have  they\r\n\r\ndelivered?  And I think it is generally acknowledged not just\r\n\r\nby  Singaporeans or Members of this House, but globally, that\r\n\r\nwe  have  a  public sector that is amongst the  best  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  The PERC survey that many Members have cited is  just\r\n\r\none  in  a  series of examples.  In the World Competitiveness\r\n\r\nReports, we have consistently been rated high and one of  the\r\n\r\ncritical factors has been governance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just the quality of the leadership but also\r\n\r\nthe fact that it has been able to stay ahead of the curve and\r\n\r\nnot  just keep up.  More recent examples of that will be  the\r\n\r\nmanner  in which the economic challenges of the recent crisis\r\n\r\nwere  managed, the drive into a knowledge-based  economy  and\r\n\r\nthe initiatives in e-government.  Not many countries have set\r\n\r\nthe pace.  And we have to see what has all this cost us.   If\r\n\r\nI  recall correctly, with all these pay adjustments, the  DPM\r\n\r\nhas  said the total cost will increase to $34 million.   This\r\n\r\nis  less than 0.01% of our GDP. If you call it an investment,\r\n\r\nI  think it is reaping good returns.  If you want to call  it\r\n\r\ninsurance, it is a very low premium to pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the need for such competitive pay is\r\n\r\nequally  obvious  if  we contemplate  the  alternatives.   We\r\n\r\nshould not measure the cost of public leadership in terms  of\r\n\r\njust the salaries that the leaders earn but of the total cost\r\n\r\nthey could cost the nation, in terms of poor decisions or  in\r\n\r\nterms of other unsavoury tendencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to focus on some aspects of this\r\n\r\nreview for further comment.  The benchmark that has been used\r\n\r\nto  compute  civil servants and Ministers' pay has  been  the\r\n\r\nobject of much confusion and even mythology.  Does it include\r\n\r\nforeigners?   Does  it  include stock options?   Is  there  a\r\n\r\ndiscount?  How big a discount is it?  And does it include the\r\n\r\nwages  or the earnings of banker entrepreneurs?  It has  also\r\n\r\nbeen the object of criticism that the base that has been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchosen  has  been too narrow and that Ministers and  the  top\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  are therefore not subjecting  themselves  to\r\n\r\nadequate  risk in their earnings.  In that regard, I  welcome\r\n\r\nthe  broadening  of  the base from 24 to 48  for  the  higher\r\n\r\nbenchmark  and  the 50% discount from stock options.   It  is\r\n\r\nalso  laudable that most of these increases are going  to  be\r\n\r\nchannelled to the variable component and to increase it to as\r\n\r\nmuch  as  40% of the total wage.  I think these are important\r\n\r\nsteps  to address some of the questions in the minds  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.   But  I  do  have some specific  questions  on  this\r\n\r\nbenchmark and its application.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One question really is the net effect of the entire\r\n\r\nbenchmark  and the discounting has been to peg the Ministers'\r\n\r\npay at 200, if you take the full amount of $1.21 million,  or\r\n\r\n360,  I  think,  if  it  was taken at a discounted  level  of\r\n\r\n$900,000.  So the question that begs to be asked is: could an\r\n\r\nalternative formulation be considered, or maybe it  has  been\r\n\r\ndiscarded, which is to consider a broader pool at the top of,\r\n\r\nlet  us say, the top 400, and then taking the median of  200?\r\n\r\nThe reason I say this, Sir, is in any statistical analysis, a\r\n\r\nsmall   sample   tends   to  have  greater   volatility   and\r\n\r\nvariability.   To use that as a base to compute  a  benchmark\r\n\r\nand  then to apply a discount is probably going to raise more\r\n\r\nquestions.  And perhaps if the net effect of all of these  is\r\n\r\nto  peg the Ministers' pay at 200, then why not do that  and,\r\n\r\nsay,  take  400,  and  take  the median.   I  think  this  is\r\n\r\nsomething  I  would just like to hear some clarification  on,\r\n\r\nwhether  this  has  been  considered  and  why  it  has  been\r\n\r\ndiscarded, if so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue is the question of transparency. The\r\n\r\nsceptics will say that this large variable component  of  40%\r\n\r\nis  merely a device to camouflage the true extent of the  pay\r\n\r\nrise accruing to the top civil servants and Ministers, and  I\r\n\r\nthink this needs to be addressed head on.  One way to do that\r\n\r\nis  to be transparent about the range and performance bonuses\r\n\r\ngiven  to  Ministers.  I do not mean by this that  individual\r\n\r\nMinisters'  names be put and the bonuses be  stated  next  to\r\n\r\nthem.  But I think it would be a very strong effective signal\r\n\r\nif\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  public  is  told that the range and performance  bonuses\r\n\r\nearned  by  the Ministers is X to Y.  That would  tell  them,\r\n\r\nfirst,  that  the  variability is  genuine  and  it  will  be\r\n\r\neffected  at the top levels, and secondly, that the Ministers\r\n\r\nare  subjecting themselves to the very discipline  that  they\r\n\r\nexpect  of  top  civil  servants as well,  in  terms  of  pay\r\n\r\nvariability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final comment I have is on the issue of timing\r\n\r\nand  sensitivity.   This  pay rise comes,  and  there  is  no\r\n\r\ndenying  this, at an awkward time, because CPF cuts have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  fully restored and there have been recent increases  in\r\n\r\ntransportation costs and other charges.  One could argue that\r\n\r\nthere  is  never  a good time for such pay  rises.   But  the\r\n\r\nquantum  is  significant and for many,  they  would  find  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  fathom.  I think it is very laudable  that  in\r\n\r\nthis exercise there has been a concerted effort to space  out\r\n\r\nthe   increase   and  minimise  the  upfront  increase.    It\r\n\r\ndemonstrates  that  a  lot of thought  has  gone  into  being\r\n\r\nsensitive to average Singaporeans and their perception.   But\r\n\r\nI  wonder whether an additional step in terms of accelerating\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  cut restoration could be considered.  I think  that\r\n\r\nwould demonstrate to Singaporeans that the leaders are in  it\r\n\r\nwith them and that when things get better, it gets better for\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, Deputy Prime Minister BG Lee Hsien  Loong  has\r\n\r\nmade a Ministerial Statement on the increase of salaries  for\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers  and  public servants, and  he  has  used  the\r\n\r\nmechanism  deployed  in  the  previous  exercise  with   some\r\n\r\nimprovements, such as increasing the pool of top earners from\r\n\r\n24  to 48 and using the median point, instead of the average.\r\n\r\nThese are good improvements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps some people may question whether this is an\r\n\r\nappropriate  time to propose such a substantial increment  to\r\n\r\nthe  salaries of the Ministers and civil servants  given  the\r\n\r\npresent economic situation.  Since 1999, our economy has come\r\n\r\nout  from the rock bottom situation.  Our exports have  grown\r\n\r\nstrongly,  particularly in the exports of  electronic  parts.\r\n\r\nLast\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear,  our  economic growth was 5.4% and the  income  of  the\r\n\r\nprofessionals had increased substantially.  Since  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants' salaries were pegged to the private sector, I think\r\n\r\nit  is only fair that we look into increasing the salaries of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers and public servants according to  the  current\r\n\r\nmarket  trend.   But  now we are moving into  a  new  economy\r\n\r\nwhereby  the economic structure has transformed in such a way\r\n\r\nthat  many traditional industries are unable to pick up,  and\r\n\r\nsome  workers are unable to cope with the demand of  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy.  Many SMEs are not doing well, and many workers have\r\n\r\nlost their jobs.   These are the people who suffer losses  in\r\n\r\nincome  and  they find it difficult to accept the substantial\r\n\r\nincrease  in the salaries for the Ministers at this point  of\r\n\r\ntime.   As  for those who are lucky enough to stay  employed,\r\n\r\nthe  cut in their employers' CPF contribution has yet  to  be\r\n\r\nfully  restored  and they cannot help feeling  unhappy  about\r\n\r\nthis  increment  of  salaries to  the  Ministers  and  public\r\n\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pegging of salaries between the public and private\r\n\r\nsectors is something which we have debated and accepted  many\r\n\r\nyears  ago. It is a very creative measure.  Singapore is  the\r\n\r\nonly  country  in  the world with such  a  formulation.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment has pegged the public sector's pay to  the  6  top\r\n\r\nearning professions in the private sector.  The public sector\r\n\r\nhas  been responsible for policies that govern the nation and\r\n\r\nto lead us in our economic development.  In the meantime, our\r\n\r\nMinisters'  pay  is  pegged at only  two-thirds  of  the  top\r\n\r\nearners  in  the  private sector.  This is  very  reasonable.\r\n\r\nWith  the  economic  recovery, the earnings  in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector have gone up.  So it is only fair and reasonable  that\r\n\r\nwe  make  adjustment to the public sector's salaries at  this\r\n\r\npoint of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the gap between the public sector and the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector could even be widened because at  this  time,\r\n\r\neveryone is fighting for talent.  In order to retain the  top\r\n\r\ntalents  in  the  public sector,  we have to  increase  their\r\n\r\nsalaries.  But in the private\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsector, they would also take the public sector's salary as  a\r\n\r\nbenchmark as well.  They would also increase the salaries for\r\n\r\ntheir own staff in order to retain their talents.  This would\r\n\r\nbring  about a chain reaction and, in the long run, the  wage\r\n\r\ncost  in  Singapore  would go up and this  would  affect  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   The  only solution  is  that  we  have  to\r\n\r\nimprove  our  productivity  to  offset  the  adverse  effects\r\n\r\nbrought about by higher wage costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic recovery is not across-the-board. There\r\n\r\nare  some  sectors in our economy, particularly in the  SMEs,\r\n\r\nwhich  have  not  fully recovered, and the higher  wage  cost\r\n\r\nwould  be  an added burden to them.  However, if  we  do  not\r\n\r\nincrease  the  salaries of our talented  professionals,  what\r\n\r\nwould  have  happened?  Under the development of  information\r\n\r\ntechnology, we are becoming globalised and our talents  would\r\n\r\neasily be attracted by other countries, so long as they offer\r\n\r\nbetter  terms of employment and better pay.  Many of our  top\r\n\r\ntalents would be attracted by the overseas employers, and  go\r\n\r\nover there.  So we have to pay them good salaries in order to\r\n\r\nretain  them.   This is a reality which we  cannot  run  away\r\n\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the salary in the public sector must\r\n\r\nalso be competitive so that we can retain the top talents  in\r\n\r\nour public service.  Therefore, an appropriate adjustment  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  and cannot be avoided.  If we do not adjust  their\r\n\r\nsalaries,   many talents and top brains will be lost  to  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.  If we do not have first-class  talents  who\r\n\r\ncan make decisions correctly and resolve all the difficulties\r\n\r\nto  lead the Government, particularly in a time of crisis, it\r\n\r\nwill  certainly lead to disaster.  For example, in  1985  and\r\n\r\n1986, when we faced such a grave economic crisis, if it  were\r\n\r\nnot  because of the Government's prompt action, we would  not\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  get  out of the crisis so quickly  and  emerged\r\n\r\nstronger  than before.   So I think a high quality government\r\n\r\nis  very  essential.  Only with a good government,  could  we\r\n\r\nhave  good economic growth and a good standard of living  for\r\n\r\nour  people.  Of course, some people may argue that our first\r\n\r\nand second generations of political\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleaders had sacrificed themselves to serve the people without\r\n\r\ninsisting  on  good pay.  It is because of  their  sacrifices\r\n\r\nthat we are able to enjoy what we have today.  Then why is it\r\n\r\nthat we must now pay relatively high salaries to attract  and\r\n\r\nretain talents in the Government?  I think the answer is that\r\n\r\nwe  are  now  living  in a different  era.   Our  society  is\r\n\r\npeaceful  and  stable.  Our economy is  growing  rapidly  and\r\n\r\ntalents  are  easily  attracted to other sectors  because  of\r\n\r\ntheir  market value.  Nowadays, when the young people  choose\r\n\r\ntheir  courses of study, they always think in  terms  of  how\r\n\r\nmuch  they  can  earn in the future.  This is inevitably  the\r\n\r\ncriterion for their choice of studies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future, whether or not they are prepared to be civil\r\n\r\nservants   or   political   leaders,   one   of   the   major\r\n\r\nconsiderations  will be  how much they can get  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nsalaries.  If we compare the salaries of our Ministers to the\r\n\r\ntop  earners in the private sector, they are still  one-third\r\n\r\nless.   This is a sacrifice that they have to make.   So,  in\r\n\r\nfuture,  will  the  top  talents be  prepared  to  make  this\r\n\r\nsacrifice  to  be in  the public service?    It  is  still  a\r\n\r\ndoubtful  point.   If we do not have good  salaries  for  the\r\n\r\nMinisters, it would be very difficult to attract top  talents\r\n\r\nto  form the Government,  and it would be a great loss to our\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal raised by DPM Lee is not just for the\r\n\r\nsalary increase for the present batch of political leaders  - the  Prime  Minister, Deputy Prime Ministers and the  Cabinet\r\n\r\nMinisters - it is, more importantly,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  preparation  for  the  future.   To  the  present  lot  of\r\n\r\nMinisters  and  public  servants,  they  have  a  stable  and\r\n\r\nadequate  pay.  A pay rise of 10% or 20% is not that critical\r\n\r\nto  them.  In economic terms, the \"marginal utility\" of money\r\n\r\nis getting lesser and lesser.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the important point is that we want to set up a\r\n\r\nmechanism  to ensure that we have generation after generation\r\n\r\nof  high  quality  people in the Government  to  promote  the\r\n\r\nprogress and development of the economy of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Deputy Prime Minister's statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the Debate be now adjourned.\" - [BG Lee Hsien\r\n\r\nLoong].\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Debate to be resumed on what day?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Tomorrow, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [BG Lee Hsien\r\n\r\nLoong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Eight minutes to Six o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>NOT ANSWERED BY 1.30 PM</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF DEFENCE FINANCIAL PROCEDURES AND ACCOUNTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand  Minister for Defence why there have been more lapses  in\r\n\r\nhis Ministry's financial procedures and accounts, as revealed\r\n\r\nin  the Report of the Auditor-General for the Financial  Year\r\n\r\n1998/99 (Paper Cmd. 8 of 1999).\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF has given a detailed account of each of the cases\r\n\r\ncited  in the Auditor-General's Report of 1998/99 during  the\r\n\r\nrecent Budget Debate on 14th March 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to reiterate, in all the breaches raised by the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General, there is no loss of funds due to  misuse  of\r\n\r\nfunds or frauds.

Since  then,\r\n\r\nthey  have been extended to timescale Administrative Officers\r\n\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance bonus norms will be raised as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political and statutory appointment holders and\r\n\r\nAdministrative  Officers in Superscale C and above  presently\r\n\r\nreceive  performance bonuses averaging 4  months  of  salary.\r\n\r\nThis will be increased to an average of 5 months for those in\r\n\r\nSalary Range SR6 and above.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative Officers up to Superscale D1 presently\r\n\r\nreceive between 1 - 2 months of performance bonus on average,\r\n\r\ndepending  on  their grades.  This will be  increased  to  an\r\n\r\naverage of between 3 - 4 months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many months of performance bonus an officer actually\r\n\r\nreceives  will  vary  from  person  to  person.  Those   with\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory  performance will receive  no  bonus  at  all,\r\n\r\nwhile an outstanding officer will receive much more than  the\r\n\r\naverage quantum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several appointments currently receive fixed bonuses\r\n\r\ninstead of a performance bonus: the President, PM, SM,  Chief\r\n\r\nJustice, Speaker, Chairman PSC, Attorney General and  Auditor\r\n\r\nGeneral.   This  will  continue under the revised  framework.\r\n\r\nTheir  fixed bonus rate will be set at the average  rate  for\r\n\r\nsenior officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Bonus Pool</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the bonus pool system, an officer will be paid\r\n\r\nhalf  his  performance  bonus for the year  immediately.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment will contribute the other half into a bonus  pool.\r\n\r\nThe  officer  will be entitled to receive the amount  in  the\r\n\r\nbonus  pool in two equal instalments 12 and 24 months  later,\r\n\r\nprovided he continues in Service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers who resign or are dismissed from the Service\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  allowed to withdraw any balance in  the  pool.\r\n\r\nHowever, officers who retire from the Service will be allowed\r\n\r\nto withdraw the balance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonus pool system will not apply for the President,\r\n\r\nstatutory appointment holders and judicial appointees.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>Annex 3</i></div>\r\n\r\n     Table   2:   Pay  Comparison  Before  and  After  Salary Revision\r\n\r\n                     Current                          Revised\r\n\r\n  Grade      Monthly   Annual   Ranking   Range    Monthly  Annual     Ranking\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n\r\nPrime        $85,000 $1,699,000  85        --      $85,300 $1,940,000     63\r\n\r\nMinister                                            \r\n\r\n                                         MR3 Max   $55,700 $1,422,000    137\r\n\r\n                                                      \r\n\r\nMinister     $49,800 $1,134,000  239               $49,900 $1,274,000    180\r\n\r\n(SG  II  +                                          \r\n\r\n12%)  \r\n\r\n                                         MR3 Min   $44,600 $1,138,000    239\r\n\r\n                                                      \r\n\r\n                                         MR4 Max   $47,400 $1,210,000    206\r\n\r\n                                                      \r\n\r\nMinister     $37,800  $861,000   491     MR4 Min   $37,900   $968,000    367\r\n\r\n(SG I)                                               \r\n\r\n                                         SR5 Max   $39,800 $1,016,000    318\r\n\r\n                                                       \r\n\r\nSuperscale B $28,000  $638,000   929     SR5 Min   $28,800   $736,000    699\r\n\r\n(Significant                                         \r\n\r\n Grade)  \r\n\r\n                                         SR9 Max   $18,800   $390,000  >1000\r\n\r\n                                                      \r\n\r\nSuperscale   $13,400  $242,000 >1000     SR9 Min   $17,500   $363,000  >1000\r\n\r\nG                                                    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember  of    $9,100  $137,000             --      $11,900   $176,000               \r\n\r\nParliament                                       \r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
