In addition, those who are in the top 11% to 20%\r\n\r\nof  the  cohort  and who have scored an A* in the mother  tongue\r\n\r\nlanguage and an A in English Language are also allowed to  offer\r\n\r\nHigher  Mother  Tongue at Secondary One.  This  applies  to  the\r\n\r\nMalay  Language, Chinese Language and Tamil Language.  In total,\r\n\r\nabout  350  pupils in Secondary 1 are eligible to  offer  Higher\r\n\r\nMalay Language in 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now broadened this to include pupils in the top 21% to\r\n\r\n30% of the cohort, subject to the same language requirements  as\r\n\r\nfor  pupils  in the top 11% to 20% group.

But  their\r\n\r\nperformance in the Malay language is not the factor that hampers\r\n\r\ntheir progression through our education system.

AIDS, which is caused by the Human Immunodeficiency\r\n\r\nVirus  (HIV),  became a notifiable disease under the  Infectious\r\n\r\nDiseases  Act in 1985.  In 1992, the Act was amended to  include\r\n\r\nprovisions to tighten the control of AIDS and to provide for the\r\n\r\nconfidentiality of infected persons.   However, changing  trends\r\n\r\nof  HIV  infection in recent years require us  to  make  further\r\n\r\namendments  to the Act in order to strengthen the public  health\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  AIDS  in Singapore.  Before I go into  the  details\r\n\r\nabout  the  Bill,  let me brief the House on  these  trends  and\r\n\r\ntherefore the need for changes to the existing law.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>HIV/AIDS situation in Singapore</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of HIV infected Singaporeans has been increasing over\r\n\r\nthe  years since 1985 when the first case was reported.  Between\r\n\r\n1985  and 1990, a total of 61 cases were reported.  The rate  of\r\n\r\nincrease  has  accelerated since then.  In 1991  alone,  42  new\r\n\r\ncases  of  HIV/AIDS were reported, as against the  total  of  61\r\n\r\ncases  between 1985-1990.  Over the last four years, the  number\r\n\r\nof  cases  shot up to more than 100 per year.  Last year,  1998,\r\n\r\nthe number climbed to nearly 200.  The exact number was 199.  In\r\n\r\ntotal,  there were 930 Singapore residents notified  to  be  HIV\r\n\r\ninfected  between  1985 and 1998, of whom 423  had  asymptomatic\r\n\r\ninfection, 196 had full blown AIDS and 311 had passed away.   In\r\n\r\naddition, a total of 2,813 foreigners had been tested to be  HIV\r\n\r\npositive  while  they  were in Singapore.   About  80%  of  such\r\n\r\nforeigners were work permit holders and applicants.   They  have\r\n\r\nalready left Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pattern of transmission of the HIV infection has\r\n\r\nchanged   over  the  years,  from  a  predominantly   homosexual\r\n\r\ninfection to one that is mostly spread by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nheterosexual transmission.  Over the last three years,\r\n\r\nheterosexual transmission accounted for an average of 78% of all\r\n\r\nnew cases.  Most of these cases had unprotected sex with\r\n\r\nprostitutes and casual acquaintances in Singapore or abroad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pattern of heterosexual infection itself has also\r\n\r\nchanged.  The proportion of married men among new cases  of  HIV\r\n\r\ninfection among male Singaporeans has increased from 10% in 1991\r\n\r\nto 30% in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this shift of the infection to the married population,\r\n\r\ninfected men are bringing the infection home to their wives.   A\r\n\r\nfurther  tragic  consequence  is that  there  are  more  reports\r\n\r\nrecently of children with HIV infection.  The first HIV infected\r\n\r\nchild  was reported in 1991.  Since then, eight more cases  have\r\n\r\nbeen  reported  between 1997 and l998.  All of  them  have  been\r\n\r\ninfected perinatally.   Families have been devastated by the HIV\r\n\r\ninfection.  We have had at least two families where all  members\r\n\r\nwere infected.  This emerging trend needs to be addressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major concern that has arisen recently is HIV\r\n\r\ntransmission  through blood transfusion.  In 1997,  my  Ministry\r\n\r\nreported  the  first  case  of  HIV transmission  through  blood\r\n\r\ntransfusion.  Two  persons became infected after  they  received\r\n\r\nblood  from  a  donor who was in the window period  of  the  HIV\r\n\r\ninfection.  This is despite the stringent measures taken by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Blood Transfusion Services (SBTS) to  exclude  donors\r\n\r\nwith risk factors because the donor had lied in this case.   The\r\n\r\nHIV  infected  donor admitted to a total of six  offences  under\r\n\r\nsection  182  of the Penal Code.  He was charged in court  early\r\n\r\nlast  year  and given a sentence of 12 months.  This penalty  is\r\n\r\nhardly  commensurate with the harm the donor had caused  to  the\r\n\r\ntwo recipients who received his blood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, my Ministry was also notified of a health care\r\n\r\nworker  who  was  HIV infected.   All the health  care  worker's\r\n\r\npatients,  who  were  exposed  to  the  risk  of  acquiring  the\r\n\r\ninfection through clinical procedures that were carried  out  on\r\n\r\nthem,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwere informed, counselled and offered HIV screening.\r\n\r\nThis look back programme to trace the contacts of the health\r\n\r\ncare worker cost my Ministry $400,000.  Fortunately, none was\r\n\r\ninfected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the changing pattern of transmission of HIV\r\n\r\ninfection  in  Singapore,  we have  to  address  these  new  and\r\n\r\nemerging  issues  pertaining  to the  HIV  infection  here.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  reviewed the law and put  up  new  strategies  to\r\n\r\nensure that the health of our people is not compromised.  Timely\r\n\r\nactions  need  to  be  taken to prevent further  spread  of  the\r\n\r\ndisease  within  the population.  My Ministry  has  studied  the\r\n\r\nexisting  Infectious  Diseases  Act  and  has  proposed  several\r\n\r\namendments  to  the existing Act to tighten the control  of  HIV\r\n\r\ninfection in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several countries responding to the AIDS epidemic, like the\r\n\r\nUnited  States,  Britain  and  Australia,  have  legislation  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  public.  Legislation in these countries  has  been\r\n\r\nenacted  to  allow for the disclosure of the  HIV  status  of  a\r\n\r\npatient  to  the spouse, sexual partner or contact.   Provisions\r\n\r\nhave also been made for disclosure to health care providers  and\r\n\r\nother  personnel  who had come in contact  with  blood  or  body\r\n\r\nfluids of an infected person, and to the next of kin upon  death\r\n\r\nof  the  infected  person as well as in the interest  of  public\r\n\r\nhealth  if  it  is threatened.  Even in the United States  where\r\n\r\nthere  were earlier laws to protect the civil liberties  of  HIV\r\n\r\ninfected  persons,  new  legislation has  been  introduced  more\r\n\r\nrecently  to identify, notify and make it an offence  for  those\r\n\r\nwho  intentionally  place  others at  risk  of  contracting  the\r\n\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a person who furnishes false information at the Blood\r\n\r\nBank is charged under section 182 of the Penal Code.  This\r\n\r\ncarries a maximum penalty of $1,000 and/or a maximum jail\r\n\r\nsentence of six months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry proposes to make this an offence under the\r\n\r\nInfectious   Diseases  Act  so  that  the  appropriate   penalty\r\n\r\ncommensurate with the severity of the offence can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe meted out.  In the Amendment Bill, under a new\r\n\r\nsection 10A, it is an offence to furnish false or misleading\r\n\r\ninformation in relation to the donation of blood.  The maximum\r\n\r\npenalty under this section is a fine of $20,000 or a term of\r\n\r\nimprisonment not exceeding two years or both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequent to such a new provision, section 20C of the\r\n\r\nprincipal  Act is amended to raise the penalty for a person  who\r\n\r\nknows that he is HIV infected and yet donates blood or does  any\r\n\r\nact  that is likely to result in the spread of the disease  from\r\n\r\n$10,000 to $50,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Exceptions to Medical Confidentiality</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The identity of the person with AIDS/HIV infection is\r\n\r\nprotected   under  section  20D  of  the  existing  Act,   where\r\n\r\ndisclosure  of  identity  and HIV  status  is  allowed  only  to\r\n\r\nspecified  categories of persons.  To address the public  health\r\n\r\nissues that have arisen over recent years which I have described\r\n\r\njust  now,  my Ministry proposes that new exceptions to  medical\r\n\r\nconfidentiality  be included.  The main objective  of  such  new\r\n\r\nexceptions  is to prevent transmission of the infection  through\r\n\r\nirresponsible behaviour by persons who are infected and to allow\r\n\r\nthose  who have been exposed to the risk of the infection to  be\r\n\r\ninformed early, counselled and tested.  With the availability of\r\n\r\nnewer  anti-retroviral drugs, early diagnosis  will  allow  such\r\n\r\nvictims to be treated to delay the progress to full blown  AIDS.\r\n\r\nThe  treatment will also allow for a better quality of  life  on\r\n\r\nthe part of the patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 7(d) of the Amendment Bill, new provisions\r\n\r\nhave been provided to allow the disclosure of the HIV status and\r\n\r\nthe  identity of the HIV infected person to his/her  spouse  and\r\n\r\ncontacts.    This  amendment  is  to  cater  to  the  increasing\r\n\r\nincidence  of  HIV  infection among married persons.   From  our\r\n\r\nexperience, the infected person is sometimes reluctant to inform\r\n\r\nthe  spouse or contact despite numerous counselling sessions and\r\n\r\nadvice  from  the  doctors.  Some have even refused  to  do  so.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  existing  Act, my Ministry is  unable  to  take  any\r\n\r\nfurther\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naction should the patient refuse to inform his or her\r\n\r\nspouse or contact.  The new provision will allow the doctor to\r\n\r\ndisclose the HIV status of the patient to the spouse or contact\r\n\r\nif the patient refuses to do so despite repeated counselling by\r\n\r\nthe doctor.  My Ministry strongly views that the spouse or\r\n\r\ncontact who has been exposed to the risk of infection has a\r\n\r\nright to know so that they can be counselled and screened for\r\n\r\nthe infection.  Those who are not infected can take the\r\n\r\nnecessary precautions to protect themselves against any further\r\n\r\nexposure to the HIV while those who may be infected will have a\r\n\r\nchance to undergo anti-retroviral therapy while they are in the\r\n\r\nearly stages of the infection and make the relevant choices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, for infected wives who are pregnant, early\r\n\r\ndiagnosis will allow a choice to abort the pregnancy or to  take\r\n\r\nprophylactic  measures to prevent transmission  of  HIV  to  the\r\n\r\nbaby.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will continue to counsel those who are infected\r\n\r\non  the  importance  of  disclosure so that  they  inform  their\r\n\r\nspouses  and  contacts themselves and to bring them forward  for\r\n\r\ncounselling and screening.  However, we will need to apply  this\r\n\r\nlegal provision if the counselling fails.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7(d) of the Amendment Bill also enables the disclosure of\r\n\r\nthe identity of a HIV infected person to the health care workers\r\n\r\nwho have previously treated him/her, or to any other person who,\r\n\r\nin  the  act of rendering emergency assistance to a HIV infected\r\n\r\nperson, has therefore been exposed to the risk of infection with\r\n\r\nthe HIV.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other new provisions under clause 7(c) of the Amendment\r\n\r\nBill  would  allow my Ministry to disclose the identity  of  HIV\r\n\r\ninfected  foreigners  to the Controller of Immigration  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes of the Immigration Act, and the disclosure to the  next\r\n\r\nof kin of the HIV infected person in the event of death, because\r\n\r\nspecial  burial  arrangements have to be  made  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\npublic health is safeguarded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Amendment Bill, the Minister is empowered to\r\n\r\nauthorise the publication of information which may identify  the\r\n\r\nHIV infected person in instances where the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhealth or safety of the public is threatened.  I would\r\n\r\nlike to assure the House that this provision would only be\r\n\r\nevoked under extreme circumstances, such as when an infected\r\n\r\nperson wilfully continues to place others at risk of contracting\r\n\r\nthe infection,  and the disclosure can only be done with the\r\n\r\nMinister's approval.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Re-disclosure of information</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that there is no abuse despite the increase in\r\n\r\nthe  categories  of  persons  to whom  information  on  the  HIV\r\n\r\ninfected  person can be disclosed to, the Bill  has  included  a\r\n\r\nprovision  under clause 7, subsection 9, in which no  person  to\r\n\r\nwhom   any  information  on  a  HIV  infected  person  has  been\r\n\r\ndisclosed,  shall re-disclose such information to anyone  except\r\n\r\nto  persons  stipulated in the Act.  Unauthorised  re-disclosure\r\n\r\nwill  be dealt with seriously.  The penalty is a fine of $10,000\r\n\r\nor imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, with the increasing incidence and changing\r\n\r\npattern  of  HIV infection in Singapore, the amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nInfectious Diseases Act are necessary to ensure that the  health\r\n\r\nof   our  people  is  not  compromised.   All  of  us,  doctors,\r\n\r\nneighbours  and friends, members of the public, should  continue\r\n\r\nto  empathise with HIV patients and their families.  AIDS  is  a\r\n\r\ndreadful  disease that causes great suffering and social  stigma\r\n\r\nto  the victims and their loved ones.  We must continue to  help\r\n\r\nthem  and  treat  them humanely and with great  compassion.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry   will  ensure  that  the  new  provisions  under   the\r\n\r\nInfectious  Diseases Act will not be abused and the  rights  and\r\n\r\nconfidentiality of the infected person are protected as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible.   At the same time, we will continue and step  up  our\r\n\r\npublic  education on AIDS, so that all Singaporeans will  become\r\n\r\nfully  aware of the danger of the infection and take  preventive\r\n\r\nmeasures to avoid the risk of being infected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed amendments to the Infectious Diseases Act\r\n\r\nwill enable my Ministry to step up the public health control  of\r\n\r\nAIDS in Singapore.  It will help\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto prevent further transmission of the infection among\r\n\r\nthe population, and allow those who may be innocently infected\r\n\r\nto seek screening and early treatment.   It will also enhance\r\n\r\nfurther the safety of our national blood supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the\r\n\r\namendments proposed by the Senior Minister of State.  The Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of State has mentioned about the rise in incidence  of\r\n\r\nAIDS  in  Singapore, which is alarming by itself.   But  let  me\r\n\r\nrefer  Members to some statistics for the world which point  out\r\n\r\neven more starkly the spread of AIDS.  Many of us are aware that\r\n\r\nthe  spread of AIDS is increasing but not to the extent that  is\r\n\r\nbeing done in certain areas.  For example, this survey was  done\r\n\r\nby  Time magazine and published in the Annual 1996.  The  number\r\n\r\nof people living with HIV AIDS in North America as at the end of\r\n\r\n1996  amounted to 750,000 people.  The change from 1992 to  1996\r\n\r\nwas  minus  13%.   That  means, they have  actually  a  reducing\r\n\r\nincidence of people with AIDS.  Maybe they died.  The  death  in\r\n\r\n1996  was 61,000.  In Western Europe, the total number of people\r\n\r\nwith  AIDS is half a million.  The change from 1992 to  1996  is\r\n\r\n2%, and death in 1996 was 10,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that at least, for the time being, the increase in\r\n\r\nAIDS  in  people has stabilised for the developed  countries  in\r\n\r\nNorth America and Western Europe.  In the Sub-Sahara Africa area\r\n\r\nwhere  AIDS  started actually, the number of people living  with\r\n\r\nAIDS  now  amounted to 14 million.  Changes from 1992  to  1996,\r\n\r\n37%;  and  death in 1996, 783,000. The interesting  one  is  for\r\n\r\nSouth and South-east Asia.  By this, I think India and Pakistan,\r\n\r\nand  also  all parts of Southeast Asia included, the  number  of\r\n\r\npeople  living with AIDS and HIV is 5.2 million.  But the change\r\n\r\nbetween  1992 and 1996 was 261%, which is the highest among  all\r\n\r\nthe  continents; and death in 1996 was 43,000.   This  could  be\r\n\r\nbecause  of detection, but the high increase could not hide  the\r\n\r\nfact  that the spread of AIDS in this region is getting  out  of\r\n\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is particularly vulnerable because we\r\n\r\nare exposed to the region.  We have people coming into Singapore\r\n\r\nin far greater numbers, and Singaporeans are travelling abroad\r\n\r\neven more frequently.  The possibility of being affected by this\r\n\r\ndisease will be only increasing with time, rather than\r\n\r\nlessening.  Therefore, I fully endorse the Ministry's policy to\r\n\r\nenhance the punishment for not revealing this illness to the\r\n\r\nspouses or contacts and to empower our Immigration Officers to\r\n\r\nbe on the lookout for foreigners coming in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The punishments recommended are not as harsh as those under\r\n\r\nthe Misuse of Drugs Act.  In fact, AIDS is worse than drugs.  It\r\n\r\nis a death sentence.  The moment you get it, that is it.  And if\r\n\r\nwe   are  so  conscious  in  controlling  drug  abuse  and  drug\r\n\r\ntrafficking,  and we have been successful at it,  all  the  more\r\n\r\nreason we should make sure that we apply the same methods to  an\r\n\r\neven  more dangerous disease - AIDS.  Therefore, I fully support\r\n\r\nthe enhanced punishment proposed by the Ministry.  But, I think,\r\n\r\nultimately, it is much better to look at prevention rather  than\r\n\r\ncure.   In  this  case,  cure  is  not  even  secure.   Whatever\r\n\r\npunishment  you have is only after the event.  As  the  Minister\r\n\r\nsays, it is better to see how we can prevent the disease.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings us into the social realm. The Government cannot\r\n\r\nlegislate this.  The best thing to do it is, as the Chinese say,\r\n\r\nif  you  do not want people to know about it, do not do it.   If\r\n\r\nyou  do  not want it to happen to you, do not do it.  The  first\r\n\r\nthing is if we can maintain spouse fidelity, we will never  have\r\n\r\na  chance of passing any of these things to our children, to our\r\n\r\nwives and to the children; a proper lifestyle, perhaps, when you\r\n\r\ntravel  to  countries where the incidence of AIDS is very  high.\r\n\r\nBut  these are human behaviour which the Government cannot force\r\n\r\non  our people because they have the freedom of choice.  But HIV\r\n\r\nto  me  is  almost a death sentence which in this case not  only\r\n\r\naffects  oneself, it affects all those with whom they come  into\r\n\r\ncontact.   I do not think the Government will take much  joy  in\r\n\r\ngetting more revenue from fines.  That is the least of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproblem.  But I think the more adverse impact coming\r\n\r\nfrom this is: should AIDS spread through the children, through\r\n\r\nthe spouses and families, the resultant social problems that\r\n\r\narise would be a much bigger price to pay.  And I think we\r\n\r\nshould do what we can to ensure that this is minimised.  The\r\n\r\nmessage to Singaporeans at large is the laws are meant to\r\n\r\nprotect you but, ultimately, you have got to protect yourself.\r\n\r\nThe Government cannot do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to declare my interest.  I am a family practitioner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclosing patients' medical records is a breach of medical\r\n\r\nconfidentiality.  Medical confidentiality is the cornerstone  of\r\n\r\nmedical practice, that is, we doctors never reveal any patient's\r\n\r\nproblem even to close relatives who call up to find out what  is\r\n\r\nwrong,  unless  the patient's consent has been given,  and  this\r\n\r\nbuilds  up trust between a patient and his doctor.  However,  as\r\n\r\ndisease  patterns  change, and new illnesses, like  AIDS,  which\r\n\r\npose  a danger to the society at large, doctors are prepared  to\r\n\r\ncompromise  and  surrender their medical  confidentiality  under\r\n\r\nvery special circumstances.  This is for the better good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, amongst others, seeks for more exceptions to\r\n\r\nmedical  confidentiality with regard to patients suffering  from\r\n\r\nAIDS,  Human  Immunodeficiency disease.   But  in  seeking  this\r\n\r\nbreach  of  confidentiality, this Bill  very  carefully  avoided\r\n\r\nindiscriminate disclosures by imposing strict guidelines  as  to\r\n\r\nwho,  when  and  how these disclosures can be  made.   Thus,  in\r\n\r\nsection 20D of the Infectious Diseases Act, and under clause  7,\r\n\r\namendments to section 20D of the original Act, there is  a  list\r\n\r\nof  personnel and departments where such disclosures can be made\r\n\r\nunder certain conditions.  This is very reassuring and I support\r\n\r\nthe amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let me bring Members to the attention on the\r\n\r\nExplanatory Statement on pages 6 and 7.  This is where I want to\r\n\r\nseek  clarification  from the Minister.   If  you  look  at  the\r\n\r\nExplanatory Statement in the two\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npages I have mentioned, there is a phrase \"any other\r\n\r\nsexually transmitted disease\".  It is not present in the\r\n\r\nAmendment Bill itself.  Thus, clause 7, which amends section\r\n\r\n20D, as stated in the Explanatory Statement, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'provide for more exceptions to medical confidentiality [in\r\n\r\nsubsection (1)] in relation to information that would identify a\r\n\r\nperson who is suffering from AIDS, Human Immunodeficiency  Virus\r\n\r\nInfection or any other sexually transmitted disease.'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this last phrase \"any other sexually\r\n\r\ntransmitted  disease\" is all encompassing.   Unlike  AIDS,  many\r\n\r\nsexually   transmitted  diseases  are  not  fatal  with   modern\r\n\r\nmanagement of the illnesses and thus pose no serious  danger  to\r\n\r\nsociety.   Take,  for  example, this Protozoa  infection  called\r\n\r\nTrichomonas. It is sexually transmitted but easily treatable and\r\n\r\nis  fairly  common even among married couples.  I  am  not  sure\r\n\r\nwhether,  according  to what I interpret  from  the  Explanatory\r\n\r\nStatement,   that  this  Trichomonas  infection  needs   to   be\r\n\r\ndisclosed.  In fact, I wonder why this particular statement  was\r\n\r\nintroduced in this Bill.  It seems to be out of place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the original Act, the Infectious Diseases Act (Chapter 137),\r\n\r\nall  infectious  diseases  listed in a  specific  form  must  be\r\n\r\nnotified to the Ministry.  And this is correct, as it allows the\r\n\r\nmedical  body  to  monitor  the  pattern  and  spread  of  these\r\n\r\ndiseases.   I have a form here for Members who want to  know  or\r\n\r\nwant  to see it.  They can come and see me afterwards.  In  this\r\n\r\nform, there was no mention of Trichomonas infection.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nto   make  matters  clearer  and  to  avoid  any  ambiguity   in\r\n\r\ninterpretation in the future, I would suggest that  we  add  the\r\n\r\nword  \"designated\" before \"sexually\", so that the  phrase  would\r\n\r\nnow  read:  \"any other designated sexually transmitted disease\".\r\n\r\nI  think this is much clearer.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is\r\n\r\nnow  run  by non-doctors at the top as administrators.  If  they\r\n\r\nchoose  to interpret the Bill according to what is stated,  then\r\n\r\nwe  may  face  problems in future, and this goes for  the  other\r\n\r\nfuture medical Bills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I wish our Bills can be drafted in a manner which\r\n\r\nis easy for lay people like myself to follow.  The number\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof times I have to turn the pages to understand which\r\n\r\nsection relates to which, and which clause must be inserted into\r\n\r\nwhich statement, I find all this tiring.  I am sure in my\r\n\r\ndiscussion today when I mentioned those sections, some of you\r\n\r\nare also quite blur.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I must confess that each\r\n\r\ntime I read a Bill, I find that to get a coherent understanding\r\n\r\nit eats too much into my time and understanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Amendment Bill and hope the\r\n\r\nMinister will look into what I have suggested, that is,\r\n\r\ninserting the word \"designated\" before \"sexually\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>VISIT OF DEPUTY VATANYAR SAIDOVICH</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>YAGYAAND HIS DELEGATION FROM</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ST PETERSBURG LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Presence in Gallery)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

In\r\n\r\nmy  opinion,  the  amendments  in this  Bill  will  give  better\r\n\r\nprotection  of  the public with regard to Human Immunodeficiency\r\n\r\nVirus  (or  HIV) infection.  We know that there is  no  cure  at\r\n\r\npresent  for  those  suffering  from  Acquired  Immunodeficiency\r\n\r\nSyndrome  (or  AIDS) because of HIV infection.   Therefore,  any\r\n\r\nimprovement towards protecting innocent people, through no fault\r\n\r\nof  their own, from getting the deadly HIV infection, is welcome\r\n\r\nnews.  Indeed, I believe that having stringent measures in place\r\n\r\nto  deter  inconsiderate or ignorant people from harming  others\r\n\r\nthrough  HIV infection is prudent and timely.  I agree  with  my\r\n\r\nparliamentary  colleague, Mr Bernard Chen, that  the  action  by\r\n\r\nsuch\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople amounts to giving their victims the death\r\n\r\nsentence and such action, whether intentional or inadvertent,\r\n\r\nmust be considered illegal, to say the least.  Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto contribute the following concerning the amendments:\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Insertion of new section 10A</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The insertion of this section 10A to create an offence when\r\n\r\nblood donors supply false or misleading information and to set a\r\n\r\nmaximum  penalty under this section as a fine of  $20,000  or  a\r\n\r\nterm  of  imprisonment  of two years or both  is  necessary  and\r\n\r\ntimely.   It is necessary because there is this `window  period'\r\n\r\nwhen  presently  available  tests cannot  detect  an  early  HIV\r\n\r\ninfection.   Although with new technology, this `window  period'\r\n\r\nwill become shorter, it is extremely important that blood donors\r\n\r\ngive  truthful  information,  through  detailed  questionnaires.\r\n\r\nThis is, unfortunately, still the only way to minimise the risks\r\n\r\nof  innocent blood recipients from being infected.  It is timely\r\n\r\nbecause  any means of deterring a repeat of that tragic incident\r\n\r\nin  1997, as mentioned earlier by the Senior Minister of  State,\r\n\r\nwhen  two  blood recipients contracted HIV infection  because  a\r\n\r\nblood  donor  had  lied about his promiscuous  habits,  is  most\r\n\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some people may argue that such strict deterrents will\r\n\r\nresult in fewer much needed blood donors.  However, much  as  we\r\n\r\nneed  blood  donors,  the  safety of blood  recipients  must  be\r\n\r\nprotected  as  a  matter of highest priority.  The  majority  of\r\n\r\nblood  donors  volunteer as good Samaritans.  They  want  to  be\r\n\r\ncontributing  a good service to the society.  They  want  to  be\r\n\r\nsaving someone's life.  With such good intentions at heart,  the\r\n\r\nsevere penalty imposed on errant donors will not interfere  with\r\n\r\ntheir willingness to continue as blood donors.  It is necessary,\r\n\r\nhowever, for the public to be assured that the intent is not  to\r\n\r\npenalise blood donors liberally but to dissuade those with  high\r\n\r\nrisks  to  abstain from blood donation.  I hope the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth can step up in its campaign in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to section 20C</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this section provides an enhanced penalty of up to\r\n\r\n$50,000  in  fine  where  a person who knows  that  he  has  HIV\r\n\r\ninfection  or AIDS donates blood or does any act that is  likely\r\n\r\nto  result  in the spreading or transmission of those  diseases.\r\n\r\nAlthough  it is good to have this clause, the resultant  effects\r\n\r\nwould depend on the next task for the Ministry of Health.   This\r\n\r\ntask  would  be  to  ensure  that the targeted  group  gets  the\r\n\r\nmessage.  For example, the warning about the penalty may need to\r\n\r\nbe  prominently  marked  on  the blood transfusion  registration\r\n\r\nforms;  the  warning may have to be posted in the wards  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunicable Disease Hospital and the same warning may  need  to\r\n\r\nbe  clearly explained to newly diagnosed HIV patients.  Sir,  my\r\n\r\nquestion   to  the  Senior  Minister  of  State  is,  in   those\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant cases that do not heed any warning and are  callous\r\n\r\nin  their  behaviour  within society,  what  further  preventive\r\n\r\nmeasures  can  be  meted  out?  Could these  offenders  be  made\r\n\r\ndiscretely identifiable to the relevant authorities or  persons?\r\n\r\nCould  these  offenders  be forcibly  put  behind  bars?   Since\r\n\r\nconfidentiality will be an issue here, who with  the  privileged\r\n\r\ninformation can report them?\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment of section 20D</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments here include the addition of four more\r\n\r\nexceptions to medical confidentiality for HIV infected  patients\r\n\r\nin  subsection  1  and the insertion of new subsection  (12)  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  medical  confidentiality  and  disclosure  of  the\r\n\r\nidentity  of infected patients.  Mr Speaker, Sir, such  a  large\r\n\r\nlist  of  new  provisos  indicates the  tremendous  difficulties\r\n\r\ninvolved in this very sensitive issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly inserted subsection (6) allows medical\r\n\r\npractitioners to disclose information identifying  the  infected\r\n\r\nperson  to his spouse, former spouse or other persons  who  have\r\n\r\nexperienced  a  significant risk by being in contact  with  him.\r\n\r\nThis  is  welcome  news especially when these  contacts  of  the\r\n\r\ninflicted  may  generally  be  the  highest  at  risk  of  being\r\n\r\ninfected.  Among 90% of the known cases\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin Singapore are males.  In 1998, there were 830 males\r\n\r\nwith HIV infection and in the past two years, eight children\r\n\r\nwere detected to have HIV infection.  Sir, I feel this amendment\r\n\r\nmay help lessen the number of females and children from\r\n\r\npotential infection.  The argument against this new subsection\r\n\r\nmay be that people who suspect they themselves may have HIV\r\n\r\ninfection would be reluctant to come forward for fear of being\r\n\r\ndisclosed.  This, however, has been addressed through certain\r\n\r\nsafeguards.  One of them is the requirement for the medical\r\n\r\npractitioner to counsel and inform the infected person of his\r\n\r\nintent to make such disclosure to the spouse, former spouse, or\r\n\r\nother contacts.  Otherwise the medical practitioner shall be\r\n\r\nguilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine\r\n\r\nnot exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding\r\n\r\nthree months or to both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask if the Senior Minister\r\n\r\nof State would consider three further aspects on this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Not included for a further consideration with these\r\n\r\namendments   is   the   subject  of   consent   for   diagnostic\r\n\r\ninvestigations  for  HIV  infection or  AIDS.   I  feel  that  a\r\n\r\nresponsible  approach together with these  amendments  in  place\r\n\r\nshould   provide   sufficient   protection   from   breach    of\r\n\r\nconfidentiality of a person with HIV infection or AIDS.  Sir, on\r\n\r\nthe other hand, it is important to protect those who are at risk\r\n\r\nof exposure and it is important to protect the public by keeping\r\n\r\nthe infectious disease from spreading.  The ease to diagnose, to\r\n\r\nidentify  and to treat the infected and their contacts would  be\r\n\r\nthe  key  to effectively deal with these aspects.  HIV infection\r\n\r\nor  AIDS  should be treated like any other infectious  diseases.\r\n\r\nThe consent for diagnostic tests should be implied when a person\r\n\r\ngives  general consent for medical or surgical treatment.  There\r\n\r\nshould not be a need for specific consent.  Only then, Sir,  can\r\n\r\nall those involved in the management of the disease feel at ease\r\n\r\nto  handle  the condition in a normal way.  Only then,  perhaps,\r\n\r\ncan the infectious disease be effectively managed and contained.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Each country deals with this disease in its\r\n\r\nown way and the solutions for one country may not be relevant to\r\n\r\nanother or to us here.  Sir, though fortunately not an endemic\r\n\r\nproblem, the incidence of HIV infection or AIDS is increasing in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We should take every measure possible to keep it in\r\n\r\ncheck.  Our population and our problems are unique to us and\r\n\r\nthere is scope for us to take more stringent and radical steps\r\n\r\nto combat the increase of the disease.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) There is a need to inform and advise all doctors and\r\n\r\nhealthcare  workers  on  new  regulations  pertaining  to  their\r\n\r\nprofession  in simple terms.  Many of them would not know  about\r\n\r\nthe  amendments to this Bill and the details contained  therein.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the Ministry of Health would keep all relevant  parties\r\n\r\nwell informed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Senior Minister of State would enlighten me in\r\n\r\nthese areas.  Sir, I support the Infectious Diseases (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for giving\r\n\r\nme this opportunity to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having listened to the very moving speech\r\n\r\nby the Senior Minister of State in which she painted the picture\r\n\r\nof  the AIDS patients, and having heard Mr Bernard Chen who also\r\n\r\ngraphically  painted  the picture that is emerging,  I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt that this House would support this Amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have moved from the days when we had malaria as an\r\n\r\ninfectious   disease.   In  fact,  the  first  legislation   was\r\n\r\nintroduced in 1915 when Singapore was largely a seaport.  Today,\r\n\r\nshe  has become one of the largest airports in this part of  the\r\n\r\nworld.   We are getting people from all over the world  and  our\r\n\r\ncitizens are also travelling.  It is therefore important that we\r\n\r\nshould legislate and take care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what is required is social education. We\r\n\r\nhave  to  inform the public at large the need to take preventive\r\n\r\nmeasures.    Sir,  section  10A,  which  is  a  new   piece   of\r\n\r\nlegislation, lays down that any person who supplies any material\r\n\r\ninformation which he knows to be false or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmisleading may be fined up to $20,000 or imprisonment\r\n\r\nfor a term not exceeding two years or both.  I think the\r\n\r\nexisting Penal Code does not have the severity which this Bill\r\n\r\nintroduces.  I support this amendment because the Penal Code\r\n\r\nprovisions are really inadequate.  And it is very important for\r\n\r\nus to have enough deterrents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I move to section 20C, Sir, I am a bit\r\n\r\napprehensive.  From $10,000, we are increasing to $50,000.  This\r\n\r\nis  too  drastic and I hope the Senior Minister  of  State  will\r\n\r\nexplain  to  the  House the necessity of  taking  such  a  large\r\n\r\nquantum move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members have spoken on the other details and I do not\r\n\r\nwant to belabour the points.  Generally, it is important that we\r\n\r\nshould  have  a  legal framework for medical  practitioners  and\r\n\r\nother  officials to work within the framework of law and  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  that  we lay it down.  I share Dr  Tan  Cheng  Bock's\r\n\r\nconcern.   As a lawyer, I find difficulty in comprehending  this\r\n\r\npiece  of legislation.  We are moving to plain language,  and  I\r\n\r\nhope that our draftsmen will try to make it as easy as possible.\r\n\r\nIf we have difficulty, what about the man-in-the-street, Sir?  I\r\n\r\nknow the Attorney-General has been trying his level best to have\r\n\r\nsimple  plain  English and I would again urge the  draftsmen  to\r\n\r\nhave mercy on us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these words, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> I would like to thank the Members of the\r\n\r\nHouse  who  spoke in such strong support of this Bill.   We  all\r\n\r\nrealise that Singapore is open to the world trend of increase in\r\n\r\nAIDS/HIV infection, and therefore we must do our utmost  to  try\r\n\r\nto  contain  the  problem,  to  prevent  its  spread  among  the\r\n\r\npopulation and to educate people to avoid the risk of infection.\r\n\r\nI agree completely with Mr Bernard Chen, Dr Lily Neo and also Mr\r\n\r\nShriniwas Rai that public education is very, very important.  We\r\n\r\nwill do our best in this respect to help prevent the disease and\r\n\r\nits spread.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me address some of the specific points\r\n\r\nbrought  up  by  my colleagues here.  Dr Tan Cheng  Bock  talked\r\n\r\nabout  the  Explanatory  Statement  where  \"any  other  sexually\r\n\r\ntransmitted  disease\" is mentioned.  He said that he  could  not\r\n\r\nfind  this  phrase in this Amendment Bill and he  was  concerned\r\n\r\nthat  this is too blanket a statement which would seem to  allow\r\n\r\nthe disclosure of a whole range of sexually transmitted diseases\r\n\r\non  the same ground or at par with HIV infection.  Actually this\r\n\r\nAmendment Bill is an extension of the 1992 Amendment Act  where,\r\n\r\nin section 20D, it is mentioned \"or is suffering from a sexually\r\n\r\ntransmitted  disease\" which is any other STD.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\npoint  out  that there is a reason for this.  By inserting  \"any\r\n\r\nother  sexually transmitted disease\" is to cater for a situation\r\n\r\nwhen,  apart from HIV, some time in the future, we may  discover\r\n\r\nanother very deadly disease that we have to control on the  same\r\n\r\nground and use the same measures as we control HIV.  So that  is\r\n\r\na  contingency.  But, in practice, as  Dr Tan mentioned, in  the\r\n\r\nNotification of Infectious Diseases form, which is gazetted  and\r\n\r\nwhich  every medical doctor receives, it is clearly stated  that\r\n\r\nfor the other sexually transmitted diseases, such as gonorrhoea,\r\n\r\nsyphilis, non-gonococco urethritis and so on, there is  no  need\r\n\r\nto disclose the full name, the identity card or passport number,\r\n\r\naddress,  etc,  of  the patient.  The only  exception  for  full\r\n\r\ninformation is on HIV.  I am not sure about the STD that Dr  Tan\r\n\r\nmentioned.   I  could  ask my officers to  look  into  this  and\r\n\r\nwhether it is specifically mentioned in the form.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to add the word \"designated\" before\r\n\r\n\"sexually transmitted diseases\" in this amendment or in the  law\r\n\r\nitself  because it is fully understood that the list of diseases\r\n\r\nwill  be  gazetted and that the law will apply to these gazetted\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Members have complained about the language of this\r\n\r\nBill.   I will feedback this to the Attorney-General's Chambers.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I also spent quite a lot of time trying to read through\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I address some of Dr Lily Neo's points.\r\n\r\nAgain, I thank her for supporting this Bill.  As for her point\r\n\r\nabout the severity of the new penalties on blood donors who give\r\n\r\nfalse information or wilfully donate blood even though they know\r\n\r\nof their own HIV status, my Ministry will revise the Donor's\r\n\r\nHealth Assessment questionnaire to include the new provisions of\r\n\r\nthe amended Act.  Even in the existing blood Donor Health\r\n\r\nAssessment Questionnaire, we have already warned them about the\r\n\r\ndanger of donating contaminated blood which is not suitable for\r\n\r\ntransfusion and if they do so, they would be liable to\r\n\r\nprosecution and would face serious consequences.  We will update\r\n\r\nour Donor's Health Assessment Questionnaire to include the new\r\n\r\npenalties and so on, that we have amended today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIV patients at the Communicable Disease Centre (CDC) are\r\n\r\nalways  warned  during the counselling sessions that  it  is  an\r\n\r\noffence to carry out any act that may transmit HIV infection  to\r\n\r\nothers,  such  as  sexual intercourse, without  first  informing\r\n\r\ntheir partner of the status, or to donate blood.  Again, in  our\r\n\r\ncounselling  at  the  CDC, we would make sure  the  counsellers,\r\n\r\ndoctors  and  nurses  will  inform  the  patients  of  the   new\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  this Bill.  In the event of a  HIV  patient  who\r\n\r\nbehaves  carelessly and most irresponsibly, then this  amendment\r\n\r\nBill allows the Minister for Health to disclose the identity  of\r\n\r\nthe  HIV  infected  person to relevant  persons,  including  the\r\n\r\npublic,  so  as  to  ensure that public  health  and  safety  is\r\n\r\npreserved.   It  is a preventive measure to publish  information\r\n\r\nwhich leads to the identification of the person but it will call\r\n\r\nfor the Minister's authorisation and it would be done only under\r\n\r\nextreme  circumstances  when the person behaves  carelessly  and\r\n\r\nmost irresponsibly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Dr Neo's comment that there is no need for specific\r\n\r\nconsent  for HIV testing when a person seeks medical or surgical\r\n\r\ntreatment,  I  would  like to emphasise that  HIV  infection  is\r\n\r\ndifferent from any other infectious diseases in that there is at\r\n\r\npresent no cure and that it carries a very strong social stigma.\r\n\r\nTherefore, HIV\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntesting and its outcome have a very traumatic  impact\r\n\r\non  the  person.  It is almost like a pronouncement of  a  death\r\n\r\nsentence, as some Members have put it.  Persons undergoing  such\r\n\r\ntests should therefore be fully aware of the nature of the  test\r\n\r\nand  be counselled before and after the HIV test is carried out.\r\n\r\nCounselling  is  crucial because it will help the  patient  cope\r\n\r\nwith  the  situation and help him change his risk behaviour  and\r\n\r\nlifestyle to prevent further spreading of the disease.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the law, it is necessary in all circumstances to obtain\r\n\r\nconsent  of  the  person before taking his blood for  laboratory\r\n\r\ntesting.  This includes testing the blood for HIV.  This act, if\r\n\r\ndone  without  the patient's consent, constitutes a  battery  of\r\n\r\ntort  and  an offence of voluntarily causing hurt under  section\r\n\r\n323  of the Penal Code.  From the medical ethical point of view,\r\n\r\nwhen  a patient seeks medical attention, doctors have a duty  to\r\n\r\ninform  him what tests are being done and what is the nature  of\r\n\r\nthis  test.   So  this is in the spirit of a good doctor-patient\r\n\r\nrelationship.  In the case of HIV testing, informed  consent  is\r\n\r\nrequired to also protect the doctor in case there is a denial by\r\n\r\nthe  patient later.  HIV testing is put on par with  a  surgical\r\n\r\noperation  as  it  has serious implications  should  a  positive\r\n\r\nresult turn out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on her point about the need for more stringent and\r\n\r\nradical  steps  to control the spread of AIDS in  Singapore,  we\r\n\r\nshould  not be complacent about the situation but it is  a  fact\r\n\r\nthat   the   extent  of  the  AIDS  epidemic  in  Singapore   is\r\n\r\ncomparatively smaller than many other countries in  the  region,\r\n\r\nbecause we took steps to control the situation very early,  from\r\n\r\nthe  day  go  in 1985, shortly after AIDS itself was identified.\r\n\r\nSo,  we  have taken the necessary AIDS control measures  and  we\r\n\r\nhave been reviewing and fine-tuning the strategies based on  the\r\n\r\nchanging  trends  of  the HIV infection over the  years.   I  am\r\n\r\nconfident  that with this amendment Bill, we would  be  able  to\r\n\r\nfurther  tighten  the AIDS control situation for  public  health\r\n\r\npurposes in Singapore.  Of course, we will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninform all the medical practitioners and health care\r\n\r\nworkers of the new provisions and keep them updated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me come to Mr Shriniwas Rai's point about the\r\n\r\nseverity of the penalty.  I think he agrees with the new section\r\n\r\n10A,  that  is, for people who give false information when  they\r\n\r\ngive blood donation, the penalty will be raised to $20,000 or to\r\n\r\nimprisonment of two years or both.  But he does not quite  agree\r\n\r\nwith  section 20C that raises the present penalty for  a  person\r\n\r\nwho knows that he is HIV-infected but he still insists on giving\r\n\r\nblood at our blood bank.  Mr Rai does not agree with raising the\r\n\r\npenalty from $10,000 to $50,000.  He said that it is too severe.\r\n\r\nI  think  the heavy penalty underscores the seriousness  of  the\r\n\r\ncrime.   This person has already been counselled against  giving\r\n\r\nblood.   He knows about his own HIV status.  He knows it himself\r\n\r\nand  he  still persists in donating blood.  When he goes to  the\r\n\r\nblood centre, he is made to understand the consequences.  He  is\r\n\r\ngiven  the blood donor's health assessment form where he has  to\r\n\r\nsign  a declaration about his blood donation.  If he knows  that\r\n\r\nhe  is  HIV  infected, he is supposed to refrain  from  donating\r\n\r\nblood  and there are legal penalties involved and he knows.   He\r\n\r\nis  supposed to read this form, and be counselled before signing\r\n\r\nthe  form.  But he still does it.  It is very dangerous  because\r\n\r\nthis could cause the death of the person who receives his blood.\r\n\r\nOf  course, if the the blood is infected, we are able to  detect\r\n\r\nit  because of our stringent tests.  But in the extreme case, if\r\n\r\nit  escapes detection, the consequences would be too heavy.   If\r\n\r\nhe  does  it wilfully, with his eyes open, then I must  question\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the  motive.   We  must guard ourselves  against  such\r\n\r\nirresponsible  behaviour.   I think I  have  addressed  all  the\r\n\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill.  -  [Dr Aline Wong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; Bill reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RECLAMATION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Pulau Pesek Kechil/Ayer Chawan/Sakra)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Economic growth last year slowed  sharply  to\r\n\r\n1.5%.   On  a year-on-year basis, GDP growth has turned negative\r\n\r\nfor  the  last two quarters of 1998, after registering  negative\r\n\r\nquarter-on-quarter growth for the first three quarters of 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp contraction in regional demand was the key cause\r\n\r\nof  our  economic weakness.  The crisis-afflicted  economies  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Korea and Hong Kong all  suffered\r\n\r\nrecessions  in 1998, with significant output declines throughout\r\n\r\nthe  year.   The  economic  situation  in  Japan  also  worsened\r\n\r\nconsiderably, with rising\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconcerns about its banking system.  Through our close\r\n\r\neconomic linkages, problems in these six Asian economies\r\n\r\nimpacted on Singapore, particularly for the more regional-oriented services sectors.  For example, overall trade shrank by\r\n\r\n7.5%  in 1998, visitor arrivals declined by 13%, while\r\n\r\nactivities in the Asian Dollar Market contracted by 10%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrenchments reached an all-time high of 28,300 as rising\r\n\r\ncompetitive  pressures, coupled with the  fall-off  in  business\r\n\r\ndemand,  led  to  consolidations in  business  operations.   Job\r\n\r\ninsecurity  and  lower  wage growth caused  a  0.1%  decline  in\r\n\r\nprivate  consumption spending.  As demand declined, prices  fell\r\n\r\nand  the  Consumer Price Index contracted by 0.3% for  1998.   A\r\n\r\nsignificant  fall in domestic asset prices added to the  bearish\r\n\r\nsentiment  and  exacerbated contractionary pressures  associated\r\n\r\nwith the economic decline.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of external and domestic contraction has\r\n\r\nproduced    Singapore's   second   economic   recession    since\r\n\r\nindependence.   Unlike the 1985 recession, the current  downturn\r\n\r\nis  primarily  a  result  of the sharp  moderation  in  external\r\n\r\ndemand.  In several regional countries, structural economic  and\r\n\r\nfinancial  problems  have been complicated by  more  fundamental\r\n\r\npolitical and social factors.  These will take a longer time  to\r\n\r\nresolve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>OUTLOOK FOR 1999</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the bleak picture in 1998, some positive\r\n\r\nsigns have emerged over the last three months that the crisis is\r\n\r\nstabilising.  The quick succession of US federal rate  cuts  and\r\n\r\nthe  co-ordinated interest rate reduction initiated by  European\r\n\r\ncentral  banks  toward the close of last year  helped  to  allay\r\n\r\nconcerns  of  a  global credit crunch and set the  stage  for  a\r\n\r\nrapid,  albeit fragile, recovery of financial markets  in  early\r\n\r\n1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial indicators have also stabilised in the\r\n\r\nregion.  Interest rates have dropped sharply, improving\r\n\r\nliquidity and reducing debt-servicing expenses.  Confidence has\r\n\r\nbeen further boosted, particularly in Korea and Thailand, by\r\n\r\ncredible progress on policy reforms, sizeable trade surpluses\r\n\r\nand strengthening foreign reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, some economic indicators are starting to\r\n\r\nimprove.   The  Composite  Leading  Index  (CLI),  which   leads\r\n\r\neconomic activity by about nine months, increased marginally  in\r\n\r\nthe  third quarter of 1998 and picked up momentum in the  fourth\r\n\r\nquarter, after three consecutive quarters of decline.  Increased\r\n\r\nnew   orders,   lower  manufacturing  unit  labour   costs   and\r\n\r\nimprovements in business expectations helped fuel the turnaround\r\n\r\nin the CLI.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also nascent signs of a recovery in the global\r\n\r\nelectronics industry.  Demand for disk drives and semiconductors\r\n\r\nis  on  the  upturn,  following  the  corrections  in  inventory\r\n\r\noverhang  and  healthy  new orders  from  the  US.   The  global\r\n\r\nsemiconductor industry is forecast to grow by 15% in 1999, after\r\n\r\ncontracting  by  6%  last  year  (Source:  Dataquest.).   Global\r\n\r\nshipments  of  disk  drives are expected to rise  by  18%,  with\r\n\r\nrevenues growing by 7% (Source: TrendFocus).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these positive signs, 1999 may well turn out to be\r\n\r\nanother difficult and challenging year for Singapore.  We are in\r\n\r\na  period of sharp discontinuities.  Many uncertainties  in  the\r\n\r\nexternal  environment  can still unravel, including  significant\r\n\r\neconomic,  social  and  political  risks.   Their  outcome  will\r\n\r\nsubstantially affect our prospects this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Global Financial Market Volatility</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial markets, especially in the emerging countries,\r\n\r\nare  still  fragile  and prone to bouts of  nervousness,  as  is\r\n\r\nevident from the recent episode of the Brazilian Real flotation.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the process of de-leveraging and portfolio re-balancing in response to heightened\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvolatility and risk aversion in emerging markets is\r\n\r\nnot yet complete.  This will restrict the region's much needed\r\n\r\naccess to international capital.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Health of the US Economy</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Japan stagnating and EU adjusting to its new monetary\r\n\r\nunion, the US remains the linchpin of the global economy.   Some\r\n\r\nanalysts  have remarked that \"what happens in the US is make-or-break  for  the  world  economy this year\".   (Financial  Times,\r\n\r\n\"Cracks  in Wall Street\", 7 January 1999, Samuel Brittan.)   The\r\n\r\ncurrent  US  expansion has entered its 92nd  month, the  longest\r\n\r\npeacetime  expansion  since  the 1850s.   Rapid  above-potential\r\n\r\ngrowth, however, has led to some macroeconomic imbalances in the\r\n\r\nUS  economy.   The  savings rate has turned  negative.   Current\r\n\r\naccount deficits are at a record high.  The US economy is widely\r\n\r\nexpected to moderate to slower growth this year.  This is viewed\r\n\r\nas a welcome breather for the overheated economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, several downside risks to this\r\n\r\nprojection  for a soft landing in the US economy.   For  one,  a\r\n\r\nsharp  correction in the US stock market may push the US economy\r\n\r\ninto  a  sharp  contraction rather than  a  benign  easing.   An\r\n\r\nestimated 40% of the average US household's net worth is in  the\r\n\r\nstock  market.   The negative wealth effect from  a  substantial\r\n\r\ncorrection  on Wall Street is potentially large.  The  OECD  has\r\n\r\nestimated  that a 20% fall in US equities could  lead  to  a  1%\r\n\r\nreduction  in  US  GDP as a result of lower  consumer  spending.\r\n\r\n(December  1998  OECD Working Paper, \"Stock Market  Fluctuations\r\n\r\nand  Consumption Behaviour: Some Recent Evidence\".)   This  does\r\n\r\nnot account for the impact on investments or the secondary knock-on  effects, particularly on global financial markets, which are\r\n\r\nlikely to be substantial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the equity risk, there could also be significant\r\n\r\nrepercussions  on  the US banking sector and economy  if  Brazil\r\n\r\nfalls into full-blown recession and drags down the rest of Latin\r\n\r\nAmerica.  The US extended 51% of its total overseas lending  and\r\n\r\ndirected  21%  of its exports to Latin American  countries.   In\r\n\r\nterms of corporate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexposure, 20% of US' earnings from direct investments\r\n\r\nabroad were derived from Latin America.  The linkages are\r\n\r\nsignificant and pose a potential threat to the health of the US\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Economic Recovery in Japan</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan accounts for 64% of Asia's output and absorbs about\r\n\r\n12%   of  Asia's  exports.   It  is  a  key  source  of  capital\r\n\r\ninvestments  and  loan financing for Asia.   After  last  year's\r\n\r\npackage  of counter-cyclical policy measures, the Japan Economic\r\n\r\nPlanning   Agency  (EPA)  has  estimated  that  with  sufficient\r\n\r\nstimulus,  real  GDP  growth of 0.5% in  FY1999-2000  should  be\r\n\r\nachievable.  The Diet has passed a stimulatory budget  worth  82\r\n\r\ntrillion  yen  for  the  coming fiscal year.   If  the  Japanese\r\n\r\neconomy  recovers  as  expected  by  the  EPA,  it  can  be  the\r\n\r\nlocomotive to pull Asia out of its slump.  However, the  chances\r\n\r\nare  that  economic  stagnation will  continue  for  some  time.\r\n\r\nCompetitive pressures may undercut export earnings.  Rising bond\r\n\r\nyields  have  raised  long-term  borrowing  costs,  while  over-capacity  in the manufacturing sector is dragging down  profits.\r\n\r\nConsumer  and business sentiments are bearish, weighed  down  by\r\n\r\nbankruptcies  and  high levels of unemployment.   These  factors\r\n\r\nmake prospects for a near term recovery very uncertain.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Socio-Political Developments in the Region</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success and pace of economic reforms, restructuring and\r\n\r\nrecovery  in  the  region  hinges on restoring  and  maintaining\r\n\r\nsocial  and  political  stability  in  the  affected  countries.\r\n\r\nPopular support and social order are pre-requisites to carry out\r\n\r\ntough   reforms,   implement  rational  policies   and   restore\r\n\r\nconfidence.  This is a challenge which all the crisis-hit  Asian\r\n\r\neconomies are grappling with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest uncertainty is Indonesia, where social and\r\n\r\npolitical tensions threaten to undermine financial and  economic\r\n\r\nreforms.  The coming June\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nelections will be a milestone in determining how the\r\n\r\nfragile political and social conditions develop.  If the\r\n\r\nelections proceed smoothly, the newly elected government can\r\n\r\nride on its popular mandate to rebuild the economy.  However,\r\n\r\nthere are considerable stress points ahead.  In particular, the\r\n\r\npossibility of civil unrest derailing the reform and recovery\r\n\r\nprocess is worrisome.  An unsettled Indonesia will colour the\r\n\r\nentire ASEAN region, including Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst this backdrop of uncertainties, the Ministry of Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry has maintained a 1999 GDP forecast of between  -1%  and\r\n\r\n+1%  for  Singapore.   If  the global and  regional  environment\r\n\r\nremains benign and none of the major risks I have outlined above\r\n\r\nmaterialise,  and  in  particular the situation  in  the  region\r\n\r\nstabilises  and  begins to turn around, then it  is  conceivable\r\n\r\nthat  our GDP growth may exceed +1% in 1999.  On the other hand,\r\n\r\nif   some   of  the  critical  uncertainties  in  the   external\r\n\r\nenvironment  do unravel, then Singapore will face a more  dismal\r\n\r\neconomic  backdrop and GDP may contract by  more  than  1%.   On\r\n\r\nbalance,  we feel that -1% to +1% is an appropriate forecast  in\r\n\r\nan uncertain situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MANAGING THE CRISIS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince  the  regional crisis erupted in July 1997, the Government\r\n\r\nhas   monitored  its  development  closely  and  calibrated  our\r\n\r\nresponse   carefully.   At  the  last  Budget,  we   made   some\r\n\r\nadjustments  to  keep our business environment competitive,  but\r\n\r\nemphasised a conservative fiscal stance as it was too  early  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  the  full  impact  of  the  crisis.   In  June  1998,\r\n\r\nGovernment implemented a $2 billion off-Budget package of  cost-cuts  and  spending measures.  These were not  intended  as  the\r\n\r\nfinal  package.  Regional developments at that juncture remained\r\n\r\nvolatile and we needed to assess how events would develop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we deliberated over policy options during this\r\n\r\nperiod, we identified\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe critical issues: to maintain the framework for\r\n\r\ncontinued economic activity; help companies tide over the crisis\r\n\r\nand minimise unemployment; and enhance our capabilities and\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness for future growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these strategic intentions in mind, the Committee on\r\n\r\nSingapore's  Competitiveness (CSC) has recommended comprehensive\r\n\r\nmeasures  to help Singapore regain its competitiveness,  weather\r\n\r\nthe  crisis and emerge stronger.  Besides keeping Singapore cost\r\n\r\ncompetitive  and  maintaining  economic  activity,  we  have  to\r\n\r\ncompete  more  effectively by growing the revenue  side  of  the\r\n\r\nbusiness equation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Cut Business Costs</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is vital to cut business costs to stay\r\n\r\ncompetitive in a period of reduced overall business demand.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  implemented  a  comprehensive  $10.5  billion   cost\r\n\r\nreduction  package in November last year, covering all  the  key\r\n\r\nelements  of business cost, including wages, rentals,  utilities\r\n\r\nand  transportation  costs.  This was in  response  to  the  CSC\r\n\r\nproposals  to help companies survive the crisis and to  preserve\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This major package will take time to show results. Many of\r\n\r\nthe  cost cutting measures only came into effect on 1st  January\r\n\r\n1999.   It is still too early to assess their beneficial  impact\r\n\r\non  businesses  and the economy.  Hence, this  Budget  will  not\r\n\r\ncontain  any  additional  major  new  cost-cutting  initiatives,\r\n\r\nalthough it will not neglect appropriate rebates to individuals,\r\n\r\nwhich had not been included in the November package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost reduction package has received the wholehearted\r\n\r\nsupport   of  Singaporeans.   Workers  have  accepted  the   15%\r\n\r\nreduction in overall wages.  The spirit of tripartism is  strong\r\n\r\nand resilient in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always emphasised policies to reduce stickiness in\r\n\r\nwages and improve the flexibility in the labour market.  We have\r\n\r\nprogressively  built up a flexi-wage component over  the  years,\r\n\r\nand avoided\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrestrictive mechanisms such as  minimum  wages,  wage\r\n\r\nmark-ups or job security legislation.  This has given us  unique\r\n\r\nflexibility to adjust our wages quickly in the current downturn,\r\n\r\nto  preserve  our  competitiveness.  This has not  only  reduced\r\n\r\nbusiness  costs  but also helped arrest the fall-off  in  labour\r\n\r\ndemand.  Without the necessary wage adjustments, even more  jobs\r\n\r\nwould  have been lost and the unemployment rate would have risen\r\n\r\nto more than the 3.2% actually registered in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our cost-cutting package has been well received by both\r\n\r\nanalysts and investors.  A recent Merrill Lynch report commented\r\n\r\nthat  as  a  result of the cost-cutting measures,  \"unit  labour\r\n\r\ncosts  should  plunge  back to the 1992-93 level,  substantially\r\n\r\nboosting the economy's cost competitiveness\".  Another report by\r\n\r\nABN-AMRO  noted that \"Singapore is demonstrating that  with  the\r\n\r\npackage  it can adjust its prices and costs quickly. The package\r\n\r\nwill  help boost confidence in the economy\".  Investors too have\r\n\r\nreacted  positively.  The substantial cost savings, particularly\r\n\r\nfrom  the  CPF cut, will help businesses ride out this difficult\r\n\r\nperiod.   The  package has also helped the Economic  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  (EDB)  convince investors that Singapore offers  them  an\r\n\r\nattractive  business  proposition, even  in  the  midst  of  the\r\n\r\nrecession.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Ensure Access to Working Capital</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it is necessary to improve access to working\r\n\r\ncapital.   Government  has  significantly  enhanced  the   Local\r\n\r\nEnterprise  Finance  Scheme (LEFS).  This includes  raising  the\r\n\r\noverall  credit  line  available, increasing  the  maximum  loan\r\n\r\nquantum  per  company and widening the scope of  the  scheme  to\r\n\r\ncover  more  local  enterprises.   In  addition,  EDB  and   the\r\n\r\nProductivity  and  Standards Board (PSB)  have  been  active  in\r\n\r\nhelping  participating financial institutions  obtain  a  better\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the loan applicant's business case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback indicates that these changes to LEFS have met the needs\r\n\r\nof local companies.  Between April and December\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n1998,  more  than $470 million  of  LEFS  loans  were\r\n\r\napproved  to local enterprises.  In particular, short-term  LEFS\r\n\r\nloans increased by up to 600% during this period, reflecting the\r\n\r\nshort-term cash needs of local companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen the equity base of promising local\r\n\r\nenterprises (PLEs) and help them enhance their capabilities  and\r\n\r\ngrowth, EDB will step up the pace of its co-investment in  PLEs.\r\n\r\nIt  will take up short-term equity stakes of up to 30% in  these\r\n\r\ncompanies.   After  an appropriate period, EDB  will  exit  from\r\n\r\nthese  investments, for example, by selling its shares  back  to\r\n\r\nthe  PLEs.   This enhanced co-investment programme will  support\r\n\r\ncompanies in both the manufacturing and hub services sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Market Diversification</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we need to diversify our export markets. Singapore\r\n\r\nneeds to develop strong trade and business linkages to all parts\r\n\r\nof  the  global  economy.   This  will  make  our  economy  more\r\n\r\nresilient,  and  help  to  offset  cyclical  slowdowns  in   any\r\n\r\nparticular region or industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Development Board (TDB) will be adopting a three-pronged approach to ensure that Singapore maintains its\r\n\r\ncompetitive edge in the global trading arena.  This will involve\r\n\r\naccessing  emerging markets, expanding demand  into  traditional\r\n\r\nmarkets  such  as the US and EU, and consolidating resources  in\r\n\r\nregional markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen market access, TDB has expanded the scope of\r\n\r\nits  Trade Development Incentive (TDI) to help companies promote\r\n\r\ntrade   and  participate  in  specialised  programmes  such   as\r\n\r\ninternational franchising and brand marketing.  Since FY96,  TDB\r\n\r\nhas  approved some 250 cases amounting to $11 million under  the\r\n\r\nTDI.  Government has allocated an additional $20 million to  TDI\r\n\r\nover the next two years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TDB will also be stepping up its market development efforts\r\n\r\nto increase companies' awareness of opportunities\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfurther  afield.   In  1998,  around  800  companies\r\n\r\nparticipated   in  TDB's  business  missions  and  international\r\n\r\nexhibitions.  This year, TDB will be organising some  100  trade\r\n\r\nmissions and international fairs. About 30 such events  will  be\r\n\r\ntargeted at the traditional growth markets, such as  the US  and\r\n\r\nEU.   Another 40 events will be targeted at emerging markets  in\r\n\r\nEast Europe, South Asia, Middle East, Latin America and Africa.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Investment Promotion</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we need to step up investment promotion to sustain\r\n\r\nand  upgrade  the  flow  of  investments  into  knowledge-driven\r\n\r\nactivities and create challenging jobs for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spur more investments in manufacturing and services,\r\n\r\nGovernment   has   re-introduced  the   Liberalised   Investment\r\n\r\nAllowance  Scheme  (LIAS).  This provides a 30% across-the-board\r\n\r\ninvestment  allowance  for expenditure on productive  equipment.\r\n\r\nIn   addition,  Government  has  also  allowed  for  a   higher,\r\n\r\ndiscretionary  allowance of 50%, for approved  investments  that\r\n\r\nmeet certain requirements, such as higher contribution to value-added.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, EDB will intensify its investment promotion\r\n\r\nefforts, including stationing more officers overseas in the  US,\r\n\r\nJapan and Europe, in order to achieve its target of $7.5 billion\r\n\r\nin  manufacturing investments and $1.5 billion in total business\r\n\r\nspending this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the vision set out by the CSC for Singapore to\r\n\r\ndevelop  into a globally competitive knowledge economy, EDB  has\r\n\r\nalso  recently unveiled its Industry 21 (I21) Plan.  The  vision\r\n\r\nof  I21  is for Singapore to be a vibrant and robust global  hub\r\n\r\nfor  knowledge-driven industries.  EDB will develop  Singapore's\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  and  exportable services sectors  with  a  strong\r\n\r\nemphasis on technology,\r\n\r\ninnovation  and  capabilities.   Reflecting  this  shift,   jobs\r\n\r\ncreated will have a higher proportion of skilled workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Capabilities Building</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, capabilities building. We will use the crisis\r\n\r\nperiod  to  upgrade both our physical infrastructure  and  human\r\n\r\ncapital, so that we can compete in the global economic arena  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis of world-class capabilities, while managing our  cost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education and economic infrastructure will continue to\r\n\r\nremain   a  priority  in  Government's  development  expenditure\r\n\r\nprogramme  this  year.   To build economic infrastructure,  $1.9\r\n\r\nbillion worth of new development projects were approved  in  the\r\n\r\noff-Budget measures in June 1998.  These included major projects\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  incorporation of IT into  primary  and  secondary\r\n\r\nschools,   upgrading  of  university  facilities   and   further\r\n\r\ninvestment in Singapore ONE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY99, Government will continue to invest in economic\r\n\r\ncapabilities  for  the long term.  We will increase  development\r\n\r\nspending  by a substantial $1.2 billion to $13.9 billion.   This\r\n\r\nis  the highest development budget to date.  We will continue to\r\n\r\ninvest  more in education, up from $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion,\r\n\r\nto provide better schools, campus infrastructure and facilities,\r\n\r\nteaching  equipment and to roll out the IT Master  Plan.   These\r\n\r\neducation  projects  will prepare our next  generation  for  the\r\n\r\nchallenge of a knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also spend more to increase our industrial land\r\n\r\nstock with on-going reclamation at Jurong Island, Tuas View  and\r\n\r\nChangi  East.   Likewise,  we  will increase  spending  on  rail\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, including the North-East MRT line and the Changi\r\n\r\nMRT extension.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key challenge is upgrading our manpower to keep\r\n\r\nworkers   employable.    With  the  rapid   pace   of   economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring, the current unemployment can turn into structural\r\n\r\nunemployment over time, as unemployed persons may be  mismatched\r\n\r\nwith  new  job vacancies because they do not possess  the  right\r\n\r\nskills.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a pressing issue. A disproportionate\r\n\r\nshare  of  retrenched local workers in 1998 were older  than  40\r\n\r\nyears  of  age  and  with  less than secondary  education.   The\r\n\r\nduration of unemployment has also increased to 8.9 weeks in mid-1998,  compared  with  7.5 weeks a year earlier.   As  long-term\r\n\r\nunemployed  workers lose their job skills and become stigmatised\r\n\r\nby  employers,  this  could  lead to increasing  and  persistent\r\n\r\nunemployment  rates, a phenomenon seen in European  unemployment\r\n\r\nfor the last 15 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must press on with Continuous Education and Training\r\n\r\n(CET)  and skills upgrading to tackle this problem of structural\r\n\r\nunemployment.  While the threat is more immediate for older  and\r\n\r\nlower-skilled  workers, it is no less urgent for our  executives\r\n\r\nand   professionals.   They  too  must  hone  their  skills  and\r\n\r\nexpertise  in  order to develop new capabilities and  anticipate\r\n\r\nthe rapidly changing demands in the workplace.  As such, our CET\r\n\r\nplans  encompass  the entire spectrum of the  workforce  -  from\r\n\r\nyoung  to  old,  and from semi-skilled workers to  managers  and\r\n\r\nprofessionals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific Government initiatives launched under the CET\r\n\r\numbrella  include  the  following: an  initial  budget  of  $120\r\n\r\nmillion  pledged  for the expansion of the Skills  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme  which pays special attention to unskilled  and  semi-skilled mid-career workers; and $800 million for the Initiatives\r\n\r\nin  New  Technology (INTECH) grant scheme targeted  at  manpower\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in leading edge technologies, of which $50  million\r\n\r\nhas  been  earmarked  for  EDB's  new  Training  and  Attachment\r\n\r\nProgramme  (TAP)  which  helps fund the  cost  of  training  new\r\n\r\nengineering  graduates  recruited  by  MNCs  at  their  overseas\r\n\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is working out\r\n\r\na broad funding mechanism to support the development of national\r\n\r\nmanpower capabilities as part of the Manpower 21 (M21) exercise.\r\n\r\nThe  M21 Report will be announced in due course.  Programmes  in\r\n\r\nthe pipeline\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninclude setting up a Skills Certification  System  to\r\n\r\nestablish  a  skills  progression path  and  skills  acquisition\r\n\r\nbenchmark  for the workforce; the Strategic Manpower  Conversion\r\n\r\nProgramme   to  incentivise  the  deployment  of  under-utilised\r\n\r\nprofessional  manpower  into  strategic  sectors   with   skills\r\n\r\nshortages;  and  supporting learning  providers  to  create  and\r\n\r\naugment the infrastructure and curriculum for lifelong learning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our aim is to build up a national framework for continuous\r\n\r\nenhancement  of  knowledge and skills. The goal is  to  educate,\r\n\r\ntrain  and retrain workers so that they can continue to take  on\r\n\r\nnew  jobs  or  enlarged duties. This is the essence of  lifelong\r\n\r\nemployability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CONCLUSION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1999 is likely to be another difficult year. Despite signs\r\n\r\nof  improvement in the external environment, the outlook remains\r\n\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC has set out the key thrusts to help Singapore\r\n\r\novercome the crisis and prepare for competition beyond.  We must\r\n\r\nwork  together  to  implement them vigorously,  but  retain  the\r\n\r\nflexibility  to  adjust our tactics if the external  environment\r\n\r\nchanges  again.  The benefits of the cost cuts will flow through\r\n\r\nto  the Singapore economy and businesses this year.  The key now\r\n\r\nis to grow our business revenues by expanding our export markets\r\n\r\nand  sustaining investments.  To underpin these key thrusts,  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  build up our economic capabilities, both in  terms  of\r\n\r\ninfrastructure and manpower skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this, the workers, management and Government\r\n\r\nmust  all  work together.  Then, we will weather this  difficult\r\n\r\nperiod, and realise our vision for Singapore as an advanced  and\r\n\r\nglobally competitive knowledge economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>II   THE FY99 BUDGET</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, I move on now to the Budget for  Fiscal  Year\r\n\r\n1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXPENDITURE POLICY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Budget Debate last year, the Government has\r\n\r\nresponded  to the regional crisis with two packages of  stimulus\r\n\r\nmeasures  to stabilise the Singapore economy.  In June  1998,  I\r\n\r\nannounced  a  $2  billion off-budget package  which  carried  an\r\n\r\nimpact  of  $1.6 billion on our FY98 budget.  In November  1998,\r\n\r\njust  three months ago, DPM Lee presented to this House a  $10.5\r\n\r\nbillion   cost-cutting  package.   This  was  in   response   to\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThe package has an impact on the FY99 budget of $1.8 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not wait until the FY99 Budget to implement these\r\n\r\nmeasures  because  timely  response to  the  unfolding  regional\r\n\r\ncrisis  is  critical.   Our approach is to monitor  developments\r\n\r\nclosely   and   respond   with   measures   to   maintain    the\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness   of  the  economy  relative   to   our   export\r\n\r\ncompetitors.   The  measures announced were  designed  to  lower\r\n\r\noverall business costs.  The aim is to help businesses tide over\r\n\r\nthis  difficult  period and to keep as many people  employed  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we grapple with the immediate problems of the\r\n\r\neconomic  slowdown,  we  must not  lose  sight  of  longer  term\r\n\r\nchallenges.  After the region recovers, our competitors in  Asia\r\n\r\nwill  emerge stronger and fitter if they undertake the  economic\r\n\r\nreforms  and  restructuring needed  to  pull  them  out  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis.   We must therefore resist the  temptation  to\r\n\r\noverdraw  on  our reserves to offset unavoidable wage  cuts,  or\r\n\r\nallow  ourselves  to succumb to the lure of welfarism  which  we\r\n\r\ncannot reverse later on.  Instead, we should be taking steps  to\r\n\r\nenhance our capability for long-term competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I move on to present details of the FY99 expenditure\r\n\r\nprogramme, allow me to recapitulate briefly the basic tenets of\r\n\r\nour expenditure policy.  Our aim is to foster the growth of the\r\n\r\nprivate sector by keeping the public sector lean and trim,\r\n\r\nwhilst maintaining a high quality of public\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nservice.  We will live within our means by ensuring that budgets\r\n\r\nare balanced over the long term.  Expenditure will be focused on\r\n\r\nfostering  future growth by investing heavily on developing  our\r\n\r\nhuman  resources,  in economic infrastructure  and  other  areas\r\n\r\nwhich yield lasting returns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now highlight the salient features of this year's\r\n\r\nexpenditure budget.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FY99 EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 20.5% of GDP, total expenditure in FY99 is estimated at\r\n\r\n$29.2 billion.  This is an increase of 5.6% or $1.5 billion over\r\n\r\nFY98.   The  increase  is mainly due to a  rise  in  development\r\n\r\nexpenditure, which I will elaborate later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in previous years, the largest allocations go to defence\r\n\r\nand  education  at  25%  and  19% of total  Government  spending\r\n\r\nrespectively.  As security provides the basis for  our  nation's\r\n\r\neconomic growth and prosperity, it is important that we maintain\r\n\r\na  strong  defence capability.  Defence spending will  therefore\r\n\r\ncontinue at the FY98 level of $7.3 billion, accounting for  5.1%\r\n\r\nof GDP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the future of Singapore will depend on the quality of\r\n\r\nour  human  resources,  we  will  continue  to  invest  more  in\r\n\r\neducation.   For  FY99,  we  have  budgeted  $5.7  billion   for\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on  education.   Education's  share  of   GDP   has\r\n\r\nincreased  steadily from 3.0% in FY97, to 3.4% in  FY98  and  to\r\n\r\njust  under  4.0%  of  GDP  in  FY99.   Our  medium-term  target\r\n\r\nallocation for education is 4.0% of GDP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending by the Ministry of Manpower to promote manpower\r\n\r\ndevelopment has almost tripled from $58 million in FY97 to  $170\r\n\r\nmillion  in  FY98, and is allocated $150 million  in  FY99.   In\r\n\r\norder  to sustain growth against rising competition, our economy\r\n\r\nwill  have  to constantly restructure towards higher value-added\r\n\r\neconomic  activities.   The  importance  of  upgrading  and  re-training  our workers to ensure employability in an increasingly\r\n\r\nknowledge- based economy cannot be over emphasised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the social and community services sector\r\n\r\nis  allocated the largest share of 39% of the budget, increasing\r\n\r\nits  share over FY98, on account of higher spending on education\r\n\r\nand  public  housing.   In  the same order  as  last  year,  the\r\n\r\nsecurity  sector  is  next with 32% of  the  total  budget,  and\r\n\r\neconomic and infrastructure development comes in third with 19%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Operating expenditure</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating expenditure is budgeted at $15.2 billion, a small\r\n\r\nincrease of $300 million or 2% compared to FY98.  Half  of  this\r\n\r\nincrease  is on account of a re-distribution of defence spending\r\n\r\nfrom  development to operating expenditure.  The other  half  of\r\n\r\nthe  increase is due to a central provision of $125 million kept\r\n\r\nby  MOF  to  provide for new Government programmes  which  might\r\n\r\narise in the course of the year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the policy of wage restraint in the civil service,\r\n\r\nmanpower cost will remain at $3 billion, despite providing for a\r\n\r\nnet  increase of 4,400 posts.  The main increases are some 5,000\r\n\r\nteaching  posts  and  400  posts  for  immigration  and   prison\r\n\r\nofficers.  This is partially offset by the deletion of some  900\r\n\r\nposts in PWD, with its corporatisation from 1st April 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While running costs on the whole will rise by some $350\r\n\r\nmillion  to  $14.0 billion, transfers will dip slightly  by  $50\r\n\r\nmillion   to  $1.2  billion  due  largely  to  an  extraordinary\r\n\r\ncontribution  of  $79 million in FY98 to NTUC and  ITE  for  the\r\n\r\nSkills  Redevelopment Programme.  Still, the level of  transfers\r\n\r\nremained  some 18% higher when compared to FY97.   Subsidies  to\r\n\r\nrestructured hospitals take up about half of transfers, while  a\r\n\r\nsum  of  $170  million is allocated to public housing  subsidies\r\n\r\nsuch  as subventions to town councils.  Another $120 million  is\r\n\r\nallocated to MCD for disbursement to community self-help groups,\r\n\r\nvoluntary  welfare  organisations and  needy  individuals  under\r\n\r\nvarious financial assistance schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a share of GDP, operating expenditure will rise to\r\n\r\n10.7%, up from 10.4% in FY98 and 9.7% in FY97.  This is largely\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  result  of  slowing  GDP  growth,  as  operating\r\n\r\nexpenditure has not risen substantially in absolute terms and is\r\n\r\npractically held at a standstill compared to FY98.  It has  been\r\n\r\nour  policy to constrain operating expenditure to grow in tandem\r\n\r\nwith,  and  no faster than GDP growth, in order to  keep  public\r\n\r\nsector  expansion in check.  However, during periods of economic\r\n\r\nslowdown,  we  can accept a rise in the operating  expenditure's\r\n\r\nshare  of  GDP  so  as to avoid a degradation  of  basic  public\r\n\r\nservices  and  to  support  additional  expenditure  for   early\r\n\r\nrecruitment of teachers and other staff.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Development expenditure</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total development spending will amount to $13.9 billion, an\r\n\r\nincrease  of $1.2 billion from $12.7 billion in FY98.   However,\r\n\r\ncompared  to  FY97, the FY99 development budget is  a  hefty  $5\r\n\r\nbillion  or  50% more.  In fact, Government has been  increasing\r\n\r\ndevelopment   spending  over  the  last  5  years.   Development\r\n\r\nspending has grown on average by about 30% each year since FY94.\r\n\r\nThe  FY99  development  budget is about 3.5  times  higher  than\r\n\r\ndevelopment  spending 5 years ago in FY94, when it  amounted  to\r\n\r\nonly $4.0 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out that the large sums allocated to\r\n\r\ndevelopment  spending is not to pump-prime the  economy  because\r\n\r\nthis  would have limited effect as we are a small open  economy.\r\n\r\nInstead, our aim is to invest in strategic development projects,\r\n\r\nespecially  those  with  long gestation periods,  such  as  land\r\n\r\nreclamation  and  IT in education.  These are investments  which\r\n\r\nwould reap benefits several years down the road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this backdrop, every sector of development spending\r\n\r\nhas  grown compared to FY97.   The largest increase is  spending\r\n\r\non  the  social and community services sector, which has doubled\r\n\r\nfrom  $3.1  billion  in  FY97  to  $6.0  billion  in  FY99.   In\r\n\r\npercentage  terms, the social and community services  sector  is\r\n\r\nallocated  the  largest share of 43% of the development  budget.\r\n\r\nThe   other   major   allocation  goes  to  the   economic   and\r\n\r\ninfrastructure development sector at 34%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending on education increased from $1.0 billion\r\n\r\nin  FY97  to $1.7 billion in FY98, and to $2.2 billion in  FY99.\r\n\r\nThis is a 31% increase over FY98.  Of this, more than $1 billion\r\n\r\ngoes  towards development of schools and campuses,  and  another\r\n\r\n$350  million  on IT Masterplan and IT projects in  schools  and\r\n\r\ntertiary institutions.  A provision of $170 million is set aside\r\n\r\nto  build  residential  and  hostel facilities  in  schools  and\r\n\r\ncampuses,  and  $250 million for new projects comprising  mostly\r\n\r\nbuildings and further IT investment in tertiary institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending on public housing increased from $850 million in\r\n\r\nFY97  to  $1.9  billion in FY98, and to $2.3  billion  in  FY99.\r\n\r\nDeficit  financing to HDB accounts for $1.2 billion, mainly  due\r\n\r\nto  a  surge  in  demand  under the CPF  Housing  Grant  Scheme.\r\n\r\nContinuing   HDB  upgrading  is  allocated  $430   million   and\r\n\r\ncompensation under the Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme is\r\n\r\nallocated  $370  million.  The $400 million increase  in  public\r\n\r\nhousing  spending is mainly due to increased provisions of  $150\r\n\r\nmillion   for   compensation   under   the   Selective   En-bloc\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Scheme and $270 million for deficit  financing  to\r\n\r\nHDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending on environment has also risen steadily from $650\r\n\r\nmillion in FY97 to $1.0 billion in FY98, and is set to level off\r\n\r\nat  $980 million in FY99.  The Fourth Refuse Incineration  Plant\r\n\r\nat Tuas accounts for half of this sum, while the other half goes\r\n\r\nto   improvements  and  expansion  of  sewerage   and   drainage\r\n\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic and infrastructure development sector no\r\n\r\nlonger  occupies first place in development spending because  of\r\n\r\nthe  large  increase in allocation to the social  and  community\r\n\r\nservices sector.  Nevertheless, the sector is still allocated  a\r\n\r\nsizeable  sum of $4.7 billion.  This is lower than  spending  in\r\n\r\nFY98 by $220 million, but 23% higher than the $3.8 billion spent\r\n\r\nin   FY97.     The   sector  is  led  by  strong   spending   on\r\n\r\ncommunications and trade and industry projects at  $1.8  billion\r\n\r\nand $1.7 billion respectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North-East MRT Line and the Changi MRT extension\r\n\r\nprojects  account for two-thirds of the $1.8 billion development\r\n\r\nbudget  for  communications.  In all, rail projects account  for\r\n\r\n$1.4   billion,  while  another  $270  million  goes   to   road\r\n\r\nimprovements and development of bus interchanges.  Provision  is\r\n\r\nalso made for continuing reclamation at Changi East.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending on trade and industry projects has slipped by $350\r\n\r\nmillion  compared  to FY98.  However, this does  not  reflect  a\r\n\r\nlower  commitment by Government, but rather the result  of  huge\r\n\r\nsavings  in lower tender prices for recent reclamation  projects\r\n\r\nawarded  for Jurong Island Phase III and reclamation  at  Changi\r\n\r\nEast.   More  than half of MTI's development budget will  go  to\r\n\r\nreclamation at Jurong Island, Tuas View, Changi East and Sentosa\r\n\r\nCove.  Spending on these reclamation projects will increase from\r\n\r\n$810  million  last year to $930 million in FY99.   Other  major\r\n\r\nprojects  in  this  year's budget are the  Economic  Development\r\n\r\nAssistance  Scheme, the Tourism 21 Plan to re-develop  Chinatown\r\n\r\nattractions,  the Mega Exhibition Centre and the  Singapore  ONE\r\n\r\nproject.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending on the general services and security sectors\r\n\r\naccounts   for  the  remaining  allocation  at   12%   and   11%\r\n\r\nrespectively  of  the development budget.   The  allocation  for\r\n\r\ngeneral services will see an increase of $730 million from FY98.\r\n\r\nThis  is  largely  accounted for by  $500  million  to  be  held\r\n\r\ncentrally  by MOF for new projects, which Ministries may  embark\r\n\r\non  in the course of the year, and $260 million more for the New\r\n\r\nSupreme Court building project.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending on internal security is expected to remain at the\r\n\r\nsame  level  as the last two years.  Provision is made  for  on-going projects such as the Civil Defence Shelters Programme, and\r\n\r\nnew   complexes  for  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,   Police\r\n\r\nHeadquarters,  Singapore Civil Defence  Force  Headquarters  and\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police Headquarters.  Provisions are also made for  the\r\n\r\nredevelopment  of the Changi Prison Complex and Command  Control\r\n\r\nand Communication Systems to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimprove  the operational capability  of  the  Police,\r\n\r\nSingapore Civil Defence Force and Central Narcotics Bureau.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

As  a  percentage  of GDP,  revenue  collection  will\r\n\r\ndecline  from 18.9% in FY98 to 16.9% in FY99.  As operating  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expenditures in FY99 are budgeted at $29.2  billion\r\n\r\nor 20.5% of GDP, an operating deficit of $5.1 billion or 3.5% of\r\n\r\nGDP is projected for FY99.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fall in operating revenue is attributable to slower\r\n\r\neconomic growth expected in FY99 and the revenue impact  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  off-budget  measures announced  by  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nstimulate  the economy.  In particular, the $10.5 billion  cost-cutting  package  announced  in November  last  year  to  reduce\r\n\r\nbusiness cost will have a negative impact of about $1.8  billion\r\n\r\non the FY99 budget balance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget deficit will be funded entirely from surpluses\r\n\r\naccumulated by the Government in its current term of office.  As\r\n\r\nI  have  noted earlier, our fiscal policy is to live within  our\r\n\r\nmeans   and   aim  for  a  balanced  budget  in  normal   years,\r\n\r\naccumulating  surpluses in good years of strong economic  growth\r\n\r\nand drawing against reserves in years of economic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should now allow the effects of the packages\r\n\r\nof stimulus and cost-cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures already announced to work through the system before  we\r\n\r\ndecide whether further measures are necessary.  But even  as  we\r\n\r\nadopt short-term measures to deal with current difficulties,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to keep our eyes on the future, develop the infrastructure\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  our future growth, enhance our capabilities  and\r\n\r\nput   in   place  a  conducive  framework  for  businesses   and\r\n\r\nindividuals in Singapore to thrive.  Only then will we  be  well\r\n\r\nplaced when the region recovers from the economic crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will therefore be introducing changes to some tax\r\n\r\nincentives  to  promote the development of certain  high  value-added  sectors of our economy.  At the same time, Government  is\r\n\r\nmindful  of the difficulties faced by individuals and households\r\n\r\nin  the  current  economic downturn.  The  cost-cutting  package\r\n\r\nannounced  in  November  1998  was focused  mainly  on  reducing\r\n\r\nbusiness costs.  I will therefore be announcing several measures\r\n\r\nto help individuals later in my speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with tax changes for companies.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TAX CHANGES FOR COMPANIES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Corporate Tax Rebate</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As announced in November last year, the Government will\r\n\r\ngive  a  10% rebate on corporate income tax, excluding Singapore\r\n\r\ndividends, for the Year of Assessment 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Tax Incentives to Promote the Bond Market</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the FY98 Budget, I announced several tax incentives to\r\n\r\npromote the development of an active bond market. The incentives\r\n\r\nincluded  tax  exemption  on  interest  income  earned  by  non-residents  from  qualifying debt securities and  on  fee  income\r\n\r\nderived by financial institutions from arranging debt securities\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  I am now pleased to announce further refinements\r\n\r\nto these bond market tax incentives.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, tax exemption on interest from\r\n\r\nqualifying debt securities paid to non-residents only applies if\r\n\r\nthe  non-residents  do  not  have  permanent  establishments  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   To  facilitate a wider distribution  of  qualifying\r\n\r\ndebt  securities, I have decided to extend the tax exemption  to\r\n\r\ninclude  non-residents  who  have  permanent  establishments  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, provided that such non-residents do not purchase  the\r\n\r\nsecurities using funds from their Singapore operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualifying debt securities are currently defined as debt\r\n\r\nsecurities   which  are  substantially  arranged  by   financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions  in Singapore.  In some cases, this condition  gave\r\n\r\nrise  to uncertainties about the availability of the incentives.\r\n\r\nThis is because the global character of institutions and markets\r\n\r\nmakes  it necessary for the arrangers to use staff based outside\r\n\r\nSingapore,  or employed by affiliated companies, to successfully\r\n\r\nexecute  the  transaction.  To rectify this  situation,  I  have\r\n\r\ndecided  to create an \"Approved Bond Intermediary\" (ABI)  scheme\r\n\r\nto  complement the existing regime.  Under the ABI  scheme,  the\r\n\r\nMonetary  Authority of Singapore (MAS) will evaluate a financial\r\n\r\ninstitution's  debt  origination  and  trading  capabilities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore on an overall basis.  Once a financial institution has\r\n\r\nbeen awarded ABI status, all debt securities lead managed by  it\r\n\r\nwould  be treated as \"qualifying debt securities\".  There  would\r\n\r\nbe  no  need  for  an  ABI  to  satisfy,  on  a  transaction-by-transaction  basis, the current test of \"substantial arrangement\r\n\r\nin  Singapore\".  This will enable ABIs to provide their  clients\r\n\r\nwith  greater certainty regarding our tax incentives,  and  will\r\n\r\nalso   serve   to  emphasize  Singapore's  goal  of  encouraging\r\n\r\nfinancial   institutions   to   increase   their   debt   market\r\n\r\ncapabilities here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above refinements will be effective from 27th February\r\n\r\n1999  up  to  27th February 2003.  ABI status may be awarded  to\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions  upon  application  to  MAS.   MAS  will\r\n\r\npublish further details in a circular.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Tax  Exemption on Income Earned by Primary Dealers in  Singapore Government Securities (SGS) from Trading in SGS</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government Securities or SGS market is a key\r\n\r\nelement  in  Singapore's domestic debt  market.   To  develop  a\r\n\r\nrobust  bond market, it is important to first establish a liquid\r\n\r\nSGS  market  to define a benchmark yield curve to which  private\r\n\r\nissuers can make reference when pricing their bond issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, income earned by all financial institutions from\r\n\r\ntrading  in  debt  securities, including  SGS,  is  taxed  at  a\r\n\r\nconcessionary  tax  rate  of  10%.  Government  recognises  that\r\n\r\nPrimary  Dealers  play  an essential role  in  SGS  markets,  by\r\n\r\nfulfilling the role of market makers and driving the process  of\r\n\r\nprice  discovery  and  trading  liquidity.   To  encourage  more\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions  to take on  the  role  of  SGS  Primary\r\n\r\nDealers and to provide a significant incentive commensurate with\r\n\r\nthe  obligations  undertaken  by SGS  Primary  Dealers,  I  have\r\n\r\ndecided to exempt from tax income derived by SGS Primary Dealers\r\n\r\nfrom  trading in SGS.  The incentive will be effective from 27th\r\n\r\nFebruary 1999, for a period of four years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Tax Exemption Scheme for Syndicated Facilities</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tax Exemption Scheme for Syndicated Facilities was\r\n\r\nintroduced in 1983 to encourage financial institutions  to  base\r\n\r\ntheir  syndication  activities in  Singapore.   The  scheme  has\r\n\r\noperated  successfully and there has been a steady  increase  in\r\n\r\nsyndication  activities  in Singapore  since  its  introduction.\r\n\r\nLast  year, I announced that the scheme would be extended for  a\r\n\r\nfurther five years until 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, MAS approves each syndicated facility on a case-by-case basis. To give arrangers upfront certainty on whether a\r\n\r\nfacility  qualifies  for  tax exemption,  I  am  introducing  an\r\n\r\nautomated  procedure.  Under the automated procedure, facilities\r\n\r\nwhich meet certain defined criteria will automatically be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngranted tax exemption, without the need to obtain case-by-case  approval from MAS.  The automated procedure  will  take\r\n\r\neffect from 27th February 1999.  MAS will publish the details of\r\n\r\nthe procedure in a circular.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Tax Incentive to Promote Boutique Fund Management</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the early nineties, fund management activity has\r\n\r\ngrown  rapidly.   Compared to 1991, there has been  a  five-fold\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the amount of funds managed in Singapore  to  $124\r\n\r\nbillion in 1997.  This is expected to grow further, despite  the\r\n\r\nAsian economic crisis.  Many large and internationally reputable\r\n\r\nfund  management  companies  have  established  a  presence   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banking and Finance Subcommittee of the Committee on\r\n\r\nSingapore's  Competitiveness  has,  however,  recommended   that\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  also encourage the growth  of  boutique  fund\r\n\r\nmanagers.  Boutique fund managers are primarily indigenous  fund\r\n\r\nmanagement  companies  set  up  and  run  by  professionals  who\r\n\r\ntypically  have  considerable experience in the fund  management\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurturing boutique fund managers will create more diversity\r\n\r\nand  also  contribute  towards the  growth  of  our  local  fund\r\n\r\nmanagement  industry.  I have therefore decided to  exempt  from\r\n\r\ntax,  the  qualifying income derived by foreign  investors  from\r\n\r\nfunds  managed by qualifying boutique fund managers.  The  types\r\n\r\nof  income  qualifying for exemption will be the  same  as  that\r\n\r\nunder  the  Approved Fund Manager scheme.  The  scheme  will  be\r\n\r\neffective for a period of five years from 27th February 1999 and\r\n\r\nwill  be administered by MAS.  MAS will be releasing the details\r\n\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Tax Deduction for General Provisions Made by Finance Companies</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1997, finance companies have been given tax deduction\r\n\r\nfor  general  provisions made against their loan and  investment\r\n\r\nportfolios.  This is subject to an annual limit of the lower  of\r\n\r\n25% of qualifying profits or 0.5% of qualifying loans\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand investments, as well as an overall limit of 2% of\r\n\r\nqualifying loans and investments.  This has encouraged finance\r\n\r\ncompanies to make adequate general provisions to cushion against\r\n\r\nunexpected losses in their operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore economic environment has, however, been\r\n\r\nadversely  affected  by the downturn in the regional  economies.\r\n\r\nIn view of this, it is prudent for finance companies to build up\r\n\r\ntheir level of general provisions further.  To encourage them to\r\n\r\ndo  so, the annual limits of 25% of qualifying profits and  0.5%\r\n\r\nof   qualifying  loans  and  investments  will  be   temporarily\r\n\r\nsuspended  for a period of two years with effect  from  Year  of\r\n\r\nAssessment  1999.   In  addition, the overall  limit  of  2%  of\r\n\r\nqualifying loans and investments will be raised to 3% from  Year\r\n\r\nof   Assessment  1999.   These  changes  will  provide   finance\r\n\r\ncompanies  greater flexibility in making general  provisions  to\r\n\r\ncushion against potential losses that could arise owing  to  the\r\n\r\npoor  economic environment.  This will strengthen the  financial\r\n\r\nposition  of  finance companies, and the overall  soundness  and\r\n\r\nstability of the financial system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify for the above concessions, the finance company\r\n\r\nmust  satisfy  the  existing  statutory  minimum  capital  funds\r\n\r\nrequirement of $50 million and minimum capital adequacy ratio of\r\n\r\n12%, as prescribed under the Finance Companies Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now move on to corporate tax changes for other\r\n\r\nsectors of the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Tax Exemption for Global OHQs</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Operational Headquarters (OHQ) scheme was introduced in\r\n\r\n1986  to  promote the services sector as one of the twin engines\r\n\r\nof  growth.  Under the OHQ scheme, companies awarded OHQ  status\r\n\r\nwill  enjoy  a  10%  concessionary tax rate on their  qualifying\r\n\r\nincome.    At  present, most companies awarded OHQ  status  have\r\n\r\nbeen based in Singapore to service the Asia Pacific region.   To\r\n\r\nencourage  companies  to locate and perform  their  headquarters\r\n\r\nfunctions in Singapore to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nservice network companies worldwide, I have decided to\r\n\r\nenhance the existing OHQ incentive by granting tax exemption  to\r\n\r\nOHQs  which perform at least one substantive global function  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The incentive will be granted for a maximum  period\r\n\r\nof ten years, and will take effect from Year of Assessment 2000.\r\n\r\nCompanies may apply to EDB for this incentive after Budget Day.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Approved Contract Manufacturer and Trader (ACMT) Scheme</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contract manufacturers play a key role in our manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector.   Some  of  our  homegrown contract  manufacturers  have\r\n\r\nbecome  global  players.  These companies  usually  contract  to\r\n\r\nperform  value-added manufacturing activities  on  semi-finished\r\n\r\ngoods  consigned to them, and then export the finished goods  to\r\n\r\ntheir overseas clients.  In recent years, contract manufacturing\r\n\r\nhas  become more complex.  For example, instead of exporting the\r\n\r\nfinished goods, it is not uncommon for contract manufacturers to\r\n\r\nbe asked by their overseas clients to deliver the finished goods\r\n\r\nto customers in Singapore.  This local delivery is considered  a\r\n\r\ntaxable  supply under our GST laws.  However, in some instances,\r\n\r\nthe  overseas clients to whom the finished goods belong  do  not\r\n\r\ndesignate an agent in Singapore to account for the GST on  their\r\n\r\nbehalf   in  respect  of  the  local  delivery.   The   contract\r\n\r\nmanufacturers in such a situation would have to bear the GST  on\r\n\r\nlocal delivery and have no recourse to claim it back.  This  GST\r\n\r\nburden  could  make our contract manufacturers less  competitive\r\n\r\ninternationally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help our local contract manufacturers remain\r\n\r\ncompetitive,  I have decided to introduce a scheme,  called  the\r\n\r\nApproved  Contract  Manufacturer and Trader  (ACMT)  scheme,  to\r\n\r\nrelieve    contract   manufacturers   whose    businesses    are\r\n\r\nsubstantially with overseas clients, of this GST burden.   Under\r\n\r\nthis  scheme,  the local delivery of the finished goods  to  the\r\n\r\ncustomers  of  the overseas client and the fees for  the  value-added activities on the goods will be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndeemed to be outside the scope of GST and GST will not\r\n\r\nbe  chargeable.   Instead, the overseas client's  customers  who\r\n\r\npurchase and receive the goods in Singapore will account for GST\r\n\r\nby  way  of a \"reverse charge\".  Besides contract manufacturers,\r\n\r\nthis scheme will be made available to traders who also engage in\r\n\r\nvalue-adding activities substantially for overseas clients,  and\r\n\r\nface the same GST problem as the contract manufacturers on their\r\n\r\nlocal  deliveries.  The scheme will be administered  jointly  by\r\n\r\nIRAS,  EDB  and  TDB.   Further details of the  scheme  will  be\r\n\r\nreleased separately by the administering agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Waiver of GST for Goods Removed from Bonded Warehouse</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of a logistics sector with extensive\r\n\r\nnetworks  is critical to our continued growth as a global  trade\r\n\r\ncentre and hub port.  To encourage logistics operators to expand\r\n\r\ntheir  business in Singapore and use Singapore  as  a  base  for\r\n\r\ntheir operations, I have decided to waive the GST chargeable  on\r\n\r\ngoods  removed  by  traders registered with the  Major  Exporter\r\n\r\nScheme  (MES)  from  bonded  warehouses  operated  by  logistics\r\n\r\ncompanies.   With this waiver, MES traders will be able  to  use\r\n\r\ntheir MES status to remove goods from bonded warehouses operated\r\n\r\nby logistics companies free of GST.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GST waiver will remove an existing disadvantage faced\r\n\r\nby  local  logistics companies, vis-a-vis overseas suppliers  of\r\n\r\nthe  same goods, as under the current situation, MES traders  by\r\n\r\nvirtue  of their MES status do not have to pay GST upfront  when\r\n\r\nthey import the goods directly from overseas suppliers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Extension  of Tax Incentive for Exhibition Organisers  to  Cover International Conferences</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staging of international conferences in Singapore\r\n\r\ncomplements  the many international exhibitions and trade  fairs\r\n\r\ncurrently held here.  Together, they play the important role  of\r\n\r\nenhancing Singapore as the hub for knowledge and trade  exchange\r\n\r\nfor the international\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbusiness  community.  I  have  therefore  decided  to\r\n\r\nextend   the  tax  concession  granted  to  approved  exhibition\r\n\r\norganisers  to  companies organising and managing  international\r\n\r\nconferences  in  Singapore.   The  approved  companies  will  be\r\n\r\ngranted  a concessionary tax rate of not less than 10% on  their\r\n\r\nincremental  income.   This  will  provide  further  impetus  to\r\n\r\ndevelop   Singapore   into  an  International   Exhibition   and\r\n\r\nConference City.  The extension to the tax concession will  take\r\n\r\neffect from Year of Assessment 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Tax  Exemption for Floating Production Storage Offloading Vessel and Floating Storage Offloading Vessel</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has come a long way in developing as a maritime\r\n\r\ncentre.   According to United Nations Conference  on  Trade  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  (UNCTAD), we have moved from the 19th  position  in\r\n\r\n1991  to become the 13th most important maritime nation.  Today,\r\n\r\na  critical mass of established international shipping companies\r\n\r\nexists  in  Singapore,  providing a wide  spectrum  of  shipping\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support Singapore's drive towards higher value-added\r\n\r\nactivities in the shipping sector, I have decided to extend  the\r\n\r\nexisting  Approved International Shipping Enterprise  Scheme  to\r\n\r\ncover  income derived from the operation of Floating  Production\r\n\r\nStorage Offloading vessel and Floating Storage Offloading vessel\r\n\r\n(or  FPSO/FSO)  in  Singapore.  These are  primarily  crude  oil\r\n\r\ntanker   vessels  which  have  been  specially   converted   for\r\n\r\ndeployment  in the offshore field for production and storage  of\r\n\r\ncrude  oil.  The operation of FPSOs and FSOs therefore  requires\r\n\r\nthe  application of both advanced maritime and technology-driven\r\n\r\nexpertise.    The  development  of  the  FPSO/FSO  industry   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will not only serve to broaden the scope of  shipping\r\n\r\nactivities  in  Singapore, it will also  complement  Singapore's\r\n\r\nrole  as  the  world's  third largest oil refinery  and  trading\r\n\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify for the incentive, the company must have\r\n\r\nsubstantial  operations  and  possess  a  team  of  professional\r\n\r\nexpertise in Singapore.  The incentive will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe granted for a period of ten years and will take\r\n\r\neffect from Year of Assessment 2000.  TDB will administer this\r\n\r\nincentive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Extension of One-Year Accelerated Depreciation Allowance  Scheme to Replacement of Diesel-Driven Vehicles</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a growing vehicle population in Singapore, total\r\n\r\nemissions  from  vehicles will creep up over  time.   This  will\r\n\r\nadversely affect our ambient air quality and may become a health\r\n\r\nhazard.   We therefore need to impose strict emission  standards\r\n\r\non new vehicles and at the same time, reduce the number of older\r\n\r\nvehicles on the roads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diesel-driven commercial goods vehicles\r\n\r\nand  buses are allowed to be used on the roads for up to  twenty\r\n\r\nyears.   Old and inefficient diesel-driven vehicles are a  major\r\n\r\nsource of pollution as they generate a disproportionately  large\r\n\r\namount of particulates and other pollutants that are harmful  to\r\n\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of replacing an old vehicle with a new one is\r\n\r\nhigh.   As a result, older vehicles are generally not taken  off\r\n\r\nthe  roads before the end of their statutory lifespan.  One  way\r\n\r\nof encouraging owners of older vehicles to do so is to provide a\r\n\r\ntax  incentive  to partially defray the high cost  of  replacing\r\n\r\nvehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have therefore decided that with effect from 27th\r\n\r\nFebruary  1999, the one-year accelerated depreciation  allowance\r\n\r\nscheme would be extended to the purchase of new commercial goods\r\n\r\nvehicles  and  buses, on the condition that the new  vehicle  is\r\n\r\nreplacing  an  old  diesel-driven vehicle which  was  registered\r\n\r\nbefore 1st January 1991, and which either has at least one  year\r\n\r\nof  valid COE left or is eligible for COE renewal.  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nthe Environment will administer the scheme.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PERSONAL TAX CHANGES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Personal Tax Rebate</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, the Government gave a 10% across-the-board rebate\r\n\r\non  individual income tax as a reward for individual effort  and\r\n\r\nto share the budget surplus.  Last year, despite the worsening\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic conditions, the Government gave a 5%  rebate\r\n\r\non  individual  income  tax to provide a measure  of  relief  to\r\n\r\ntaxpayers.  Although some signs of stability have emerged, there\r\n\r\nstill remain critical uncertainties in the external environment.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I have decided to restore the personal tax  rebate\r\n\r\nto  10%  for  the Year of Assessment 1999, similar to  1997,  in\r\n\r\norder  to  help  taxpayers  tide over this  temporary  difficult\r\n\r\nperiod.

To\r\n\r\nextend help to these individuals, the Government will grant  the\r\n\r\nsame  rebates  on  HDB  rentals and  town  council  Service  and\r\n\r\nConservancy  (S&C)  charges as in 1997 to  citizens  staying  in\r\n\r\nrented  and  owner-occupied HDB flats.

The special  rebates,\r\n\r\nwhich  are  about  10%  of current gross  S&C  charges,  are  as\r\n\r\nfollows: $2 per month for 1-room flats, $3 per month for  2-room\r\n\r\nflats,  $4  per month for 3-room flats, $5 per month for  4-room\r\n\r\nflats  and  $6  per month for 5-room flats.  These rebates  will\r\n\r\ncost Government an additional $40 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Extension of GST-Related Offsets and Rebates for Two Years</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the difficult economic conditions, Government\r\n\r\nhad   announced  in  November last year  that  the  transitional\r\n\r\nmeasures in the GST offset package, consisting of rental and S&C\r\n\r\nrebates for 1 to 3-room HDB households, would be extended by two\r\n\r\nmore years.  The rental and S&C rebates are as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Rental Rebates\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1-room flats: a rental rebate of $12 per month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2-room flats: a rental rebate of $8 per month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Rebates for S&C Charges\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1-room flats: $8 per month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2-room flats: $7 per month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 3-room flats: $4 per month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated cost of these rebates is $22 million per year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low income households which are not living in HDB flats can\r\n\r\ncontinue   to   receive  help  from  the  Citizens  Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittees  (CCCs) Assistance Scheme, which was set up  in  1994\r\n\r\nwhen GST was implemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Offset Package for Utilities Rates Revision</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government had in June 1997 announced the revision of\r\n\r\nwater  tariffs  and the water conservation tax to  uniform  flat\r\n\r\nrates  for  all users.  There have so far been two increases  in\r\n\r\nJuly 1997 and July 1998.  The next increase is scheduled for 1st\r\n\r\nJuly 1999.  Despite the economic downturn, we must press on with\r\n\r\nour  water  conservation  efforts and raise  water  tariffs  and\r\n\r\nconservation tax as planned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water tariffs, including conservation tax, will\r\n\r\nincrease  by  15.3  cents  to 24.4 cents  per  cubic  metre  for\r\n\r\ndomestic  consumers.  The non-domestic water rate will  increase\r\n\r\nby  5.8 cents per cubic metre to reach the target rate of  $1.52\r\n\r\nper  cubic metre.  As part of the water conservation effort, the\r\n\r\nwaterborne fee will also be raised as scheduled, by 5 cents  per\r\n\r\ncubic  metre for domestic consumers and 9 cents per cubic  metre\r\n\r\nfor non-domestic consumers with effect from 1st July 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to help lower income\r\n\r\nhouseholds  cope with the increases in water charges.   In  1997\r\n\r\nand  1998, a package of annual utilities rebates and monthly S&C\r\n\r\ngrants were given to citizens living in 1 to 4-room HDB flats to\r\n\r\noffset  the increases in electricity and water rates.   To  help\r\n\r\nthe  lower  income  groups cope with the  economic  crisis,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  already  announced in November  1998  that  the\r\n\r\npackage  of  utilities rebates and monthly S&C grants  given  in\r\n\r\n1997 and 1998 will be continued for another two years.  The cost\r\n\r\nto Government is estimated at $73 million per year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As water charges are scheduled to increase further in July\r\n\r\n1999, the Government has decided to double the utilities rebates\r\n\r\nfrom $100 to $200 for 1 to 3-room HDB flats and from $50 to $100\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  4-room  HDB  flats  in  1999.   This  will  cost\r\n\r\nGovernment  an  additional  $41  million,  and  is   more   than\r\n\r\nsufficient  to  offset  the increase in water  costs  for  lower\r\n\r\nincome households.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The utilities rebates will be credited against the\r\n\r\nutilities  bills  of  eligible  households  for  the  month   of\r\n\r\nSeptember  which  are payable in October.  The  balance  of  the\r\n\r\nrebate not consumed within the month will be carried over  until\r\n\r\nit  is fully used up.  Grants for S&C charges to HDB lessees and\r\n\r\ntenants,  ranging from $36 to $66 a year, will  continue  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven.  The grants will start from July 1999 and will be $3  per\r\n\r\nmonth for 1-room flats, $4 per month for 2-room flats, $5.50 per\r\n\r\nmonth for 3-room flats and $4 per month for 4-room flats.  Those\r\n\r\nlower income groups which do not live in HDB flats and hence are\r\n\r\nunable to benefit from the utilities rebates and S&C grants  can\r\n\r\nobtain help from the CCC Assistance Scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Tax Deduction of Certain Educational Expenses for Individuals</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore to transform successfully into a knowledge-based economy, the need for continual training and skills\r\n\r\nupgrading  cannot be over emphasised.  Besides facilitating  and\r\n\r\nproviding  funding for numerous training schemes, the Government\r\n\r\nwould  also like to encourage individuals to take the initiative\r\n\r\nto  improve  their  skills  and  knowledge.   Currently,  a  tax\r\n\r\ndeduction  of  up  to  $2,000  is allowed  for  actual  expenses\r\n\r\nincurred  by  individuals  in pursuit of  further  academic  and\r\n\r\nprofessional   qualifications,  or   vocational   qualifications\r\n\r\nrelated  to their business, trade or employment.  I have decided\r\n\r\nto  raise  the  tax  deduction cap to $2,500,  to  give  further\r\n\r\nemphasis  to  the  importance of lifelong  learning  and  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading.  The higher deduction cap of $2,500 will take  effect\r\n\r\nfrom Year of Assessment 1999.  The revenue loss is estimated  to\r\n\r\nbe $4 million.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>OTHER TAX CHANGES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Property Tax Rebate</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 55% property tax rebate on industrial and commercial\r\n\r\nproperties, first\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nannounced in the June 1998 off-budget measures,  will\r\n\r\nbe extended by another year to 30th June 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Stamp Duty for Contract Notes</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As announced in the November 1998 cost-cutting package, the\r\n\r\nsuspension of stamp duty on contract notes for share transaction\r\n\r\nwill now be extended by another year to 29th June 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CONCLUSION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has carefully calibrated\r\n\r\nits  response  to  the regional crisis.  We have  taken  actions\r\n\r\ncommensurate  with  the situation we faced.   We  did  not  over\r\n\r\nreact.   As  a  result,  we  have won  the  confidence  of  both\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and the international community in the way we  have\r\n\r\nmanaged  the  crisis.  While there are some signs  of  stability\r\n\r\nemerging  over the past few months, there still exist many  risk\r\n\r\nfactors  and  uncertainties  in our  external  environment.   We\r\n\r\ncannot afford to be overly sanguine about the economic prospects\r\n\r\nfor  1999.   If  things should take a turn for  the  worse,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has the accumulated financial resources to cope  with\r\n\r\nthe crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1999 will be a test of our determination and of our nerves.\r\n\r\nWe must not abandon the fundamental policies that have served\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nus well in the past.  At the same time, we have to  be\r\n\r\nnimble  and  flexible  in  dealing  with  the  situation  as  it\r\n\r\ndevelops.   We  will  continue  to  invest  in  our  future,  by\r\n\r\ndeveloping  a  world  class  infrastructure  and  enhancing  the\r\n\r\ncapability  of  our people and workforce.  I am  confident  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will pass the test, and we will  emerge  from  the\r\n\r\ncrisis stronger and leaner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
