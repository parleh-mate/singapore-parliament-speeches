I think  it  is  important,\r\n\r\nbefore we discuss any motion arising out of  this\r\n\r\nmessage that we should know what the person,  who\r\n\r\nhas    been   negotiating   for   this   message,\r\n\r\nunderstands it to mean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is\r\n\r\nindeed my intention to give all the facts that  I\r\n\r\ncan  to  hon. Members, and I intend to  make  it,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  the course of my address to  you  which\r\n\r\nwill  culminate,  I hope, in a motion  that  this\r\n\r\nHouse may find acceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to me, as I see it, this is indeed a happy\r\n\r\nday for the people of Singapore. It marks the end\r\n\r\nof  the  first phase of our struggle for freedom.\r\n\r\nIt  marks the beginning of a new era. The present\r\n\r\nconstitution  infused  by  the  spirit  of   this\r\n\r\nmessage, which you have read, marks, if I may use\r\n\r\nthe  Royal phrase, \"a significant advance\" in our\r\n\r\nconstitutional development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I read in a Nanyang Siang Pao\r\n\r\neditorial,   which  advised  patience   in   this\r\n\r\nconstitutional  crisis, a delightful  phrase.  It\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"He who soweth abundantly shall also  reap\r\n\r\nabundantly.\"  Sir, today's harvest  is  a  goodly\r\n\r\none.  In  so far as this message deals  with  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional   issues,  the  victory   is   the\r\n\r\npeople's - a  complete, a clean and an exhilarating\r\n\r\nvictory!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most understanding summary of these issues\r\n\r\nthat  I  have  read I saw in the Times  of  India\r\n\r\npublished in Delhi on 1st August, 1955, and  with\r\n\r\nyour  permission, Sir, I should like to read just\r\n\r\ntwo paragraphs from it:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The constitutional crisis is not, as has been\r\n\r\nmade  out, merely a somewhat exaggerated reaction\r\n\r\nof the Governor's insistence on his discretion to\r\n\r\naccept or reject the Chief Minister's advice  and\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  It is not  merely  an  unseemly\r\n\r\nsquabble  over  the  question  of  whether  there\r\n\r\nshould  or  should not be four Under-Secretaries.\r\n\r\nMore fundamental principles are involved, and  an\r\n\r\nobsession  with  constitutional  legalities   has\r\n\r\ntended\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  obscure  the force and extent of  nationalist\r\n\r\nsentiment.  As Mr Marshall has pointed  out,  in\r\n\r\nthe  present  condition of rapid  development  in\r\n\r\nevery  part of Asia towards self-government,  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Government is under a moral,  if  not  a\r\n\r\nconstitutional,  obligation to  adopt  'the  most\r\n\r\nliberal   construction  legally  permissible   in\r\n\r\nfavour of elected representatives of the people'.\r\n\r\nWhere  the Governor enjoys discretionary  powers,\r\n\r\nthese   powers  should  obviously  be  exercised,\r\n\r\nwherever possible, in accordance with the  wishes\r\n\r\nof  the  elected representatives. It is  on  this\r\n\r\nbasic issue that considerable resentment has been\r\n\r\naroused,  and  the  reality  of  this  resentment\r\n\r\ncannot  be  evaded  by  insisting  on  legal  and\r\n\r\nconstitutional rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor's recent intimation that in the\r\n\r\nview  of  the  British Government  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nconstitution provides for slow rather than  rapid\r\n\r\nprogress  towards self-government was  completely\r\n\r\nout of joint with the sentiment of the times, and\r\n\r\nconfounded  those who had hoped that the  present\r\n\r\nconstitution   was  a  framework   within   which\r\n\r\nencouraging   strides  could  be  made   in   the\r\n\r\ndirection of early independence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the message that we have before us lies\r\n\r\nthat  assurance, in the words of  this  editorial\r\n\r\nwriter,  'that  the  present  constitution  is  a\r\n\r\nframework within which encouraging strides can be\r\n\r\nmade in the direction of early independence'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We based our request, as you will remember, on\r\n\r\ntwo grounds when approaching His Excellency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, that the interpretation proposed by us\r\n\r\nis  the legal constitutional interpretation;  and\r\n\r\nsecondly,  that in any event it was an  untenable\r\n\r\nposition  that  we,  who  had  to  shoulder   the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities,  should have inadequate  powers\r\n\r\nto meet those responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer we have today, Sir, is in effect\r\n\r\nthis:  we  are wrong in our legal interpretation,\r\n\r\nbut  in  the light of the people's needs, and  in\r\n\r\nview of the sense of responsibility already shown\r\n\r\nby  the  people's representatives, Her  Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment  cedes  the  point  and  accepts   our\r\n\r\ninterpretation,    even    though    the    legal\r\n\r\njustification is missing. This is significant. We\r\n\r\nhave  asked  for  a spirit of goodwill.  We  have\r\n\r\nasked   for   a   spirit   of   co-operation   in\r\n\r\ninterpreting the constitution so as  to  make  it\r\n\r\nworkable.  Since Her Majesty's Government  denies\r\n\r\nthe  legal  justification for  our  request,  the\r\n\r\nconcession granted in this message gives concrete\r\n\r\nexpression of a spirit of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoodwill and a desire to co-operate that is truly\r\n\r\nwarming  and encouraging. Not only as a  harassed\r\n\r\nChief  Minister, but as a citizen,  I  am  deeply\r\n\r\nappreciative  of the action of the  Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState  as  indicated in this message. I  am  also\r\n\r\nhappy to say that I have established relations of\r\n\r\nmutual  confidence with him, which may,  to  some\r\n\r\nextent,  have  assisted in the  decision  he  has\r\n\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an exception in this message, the\r\n\r\nexception  of  section 67 (1), but I  trust  that\r\n\r\nhon.  Members  will  not  be  distracted  from  a\r\n\r\nrealisation  of  the extent of  the  co-operation\r\n\r\nreceived and the goodwill shown because  of  this\r\n\r\nexception. If the section is read, and  carefully\r\n\r\nre-read, it will be seen that whichever way it is\r\n\r\ninterpreted,    whether    according    to     my\r\n\r\ninterpretation   or   to  the   Colonial   Office\r\n\r\ninterpretation,   the   practical   results   are\r\n\r\nabsolutely identical. The procedure is  a  little\r\n\r\ndifferent, but the results are identical,  and  I\r\n\r\nam  quite happy to accept this exception,  which,\r\n\r\nin  any  event,  merely formalises  what  is  the\r\n\r\nposition in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not prepared to go so far, Sir, as another\r\n\r\nMember  of this House, who told me that we  have,\r\n\r\nby  this message, achieved within four months the\r\n\r\ncomplete  internal self-government  which  I  had\r\n\r\npromised  to  work for under the old apple  tree,\r\n\r\nwithin  four years. Nor am I prepared  to  accept\r\n\r\nthe  suggestion that the only veto power left  to\r\n\r\nthe Governor is the power to dismiss me. We are a\r\n\r\nfar  cry  yet, certainly, from complete  internal\r\n\r\nself-government.  At the same time  there  is  no\r\n\r\nneed  to minimise the fact that today, by  virtue\r\n\r\nof  the  new  spirit that moves this constitution\r\n\r\nwithout  any  amendment, we have very substantial\r\n\r\npower,  and the welfare of this territory is,  to\r\n\r\nan  appreciable extent, in our hands and  in  the\r\n\r\nhands  of the civil servants who have to  execute\r\n\r\nour  policies.  It is not merely that  irritating\r\n\r\ncontrols  have been removed. It is  rather,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat   there  has  grown  a  new  and   wholesome\r\n\r\nrelationship  of  mutual  respect   between   Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's   representative   and   the   people's\r\n\r\nrepresentatives.  I am aware  that  I  have  been\r\n\r\naccused  of being unsporting in wishing a  crisis\r\n\r\non  His  Excellency  within three  weeks  of  his\r\n\r\narrival.

I understand, Sir, that that  is  a\r\n\r\nmarriage    between    the    Progressives    and\r\n\r\nprofessionals. Now, you will remember, Sir,  that\r\n\r\non  the  Friday, the original day of the  debate,\r\n\r\nthese    honourable,   these   truly   remarkable\r\n\r\ngentlemen  warned  this  House  of  the  dreadful\r\n\r\ndisaster  that would follow upon any increase  of\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister's powers; but seeing that  no\r\n\r\none  heeded, such was their burning love  for  me\r\n\r\nand  their  ardent desire to see that I  was  not\r\n\r\nfurther  burdened with greater powers, that  they\r\n\r\nwere   prepared  to  throw  political   integrity\r\n\r\noverboard  and came forward with a motion  which,\r\n\r\naccording  to  their  own  representatives,   was\r\n\r\ncalculated   to  make  it  impossible   for   the\r\n\r\nSecretary   of   State  to  pay  any   respectful\r\n\r\nattention to, and in this way they hoped to  save\r\n\r\nthe  people  from  the dire  consequences  of  an\r\n\r\nincrease of the Chief Minister's powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.

Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am indeed indebted to you,\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,   Sir. I  have   very   carefully\r\n\r\nconsidered my words. I know, Sir that at times  I\r\n\r\nfeel      with      such     truly     remarkable\r\n\r\ngentlemen - exceptional should be the word - that  we\r\n\r\nshould  have exceptional rules! But I  have  been\r\n\r\ncareful, and I have only imputed to them, Sir,  a\r\n\r\ndesire  to  save the country from  the  chaos  of\r\n\r\nincreasing  my  powers by a  particularly  clever\r\n\r\npolitical manoeuvre. Nothing more than that!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what the \"Progressional Party\" did not know\r\n\r\nwas  that  I had weeks ago asked, when I  learned\r\n\r\nthat  the  Secretary  of  State  was  coming   to\r\n\r\nSingapore, that an item be placed on the  agenda,\r\n\r\nand that item was a discussion for the fixing  of\r\n\r\na  date  for  complete internal  self-government.\r\n\r\nThat  item  was  already on the  agenda;  and  by\r\n\r\nchanging  just  one  word in  their  very  clever\r\n\r\namendment,  the result was that this  House  gave\r\n\r\nsuch  a  remarkable demonstration of the urge  of\r\n\r\nthe   people   for   freedom   that,   far   from\r\n\r\nhandicapping me, I was strengthened, not only  in\r\n\r\nmy  original motion but in broaching the question\r\n\r\nof  fixing  a  date for complete  internal  self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on that aspect, Sir, today's reply is not\r\n\r\nall  that  anyone of us could wish,  barring  the\r\n\r\nhon.   Mr   Sutherland.  But  looking   at   the\r\n\r\nbackground against which this message is given, I\r\n\r\nconsider it an appreciable concession. I  believe\r\n\r\nI know the mentality of the Colonial Office. Yes,\r\n\r\nto  it haste is something indecent. Every time it\r\n\r\ntakes  a  step forward, it looks to see that  the\r\n\r\nfoot  is firmly planted, and it is unquestionably\r\n\r\nnotoriously  allergic to time-tables  and  fixing\r\n\r\ndates  for independence, or even self-government!\r\n\r\nAgainst  that  background, Sir, and  we  have  to\r\n\r\nacknowledge  its  existence; we  must  judge  the\r\n\r\nassurance  given that our request  for  immediate\r\n\r\nself-government  will  be considered  within  the\r\n\r\nnext  nine months. I want no misunderstanding  on\r\n\r\nthis,  and  it  may  well be  that  this  is  the\r\n\r\nclarification that is being sought; but I made it\r\n\r\nquite  clear  to the Secretary of State  for  the\r\n\r\nColonies that when we do go to England - and,  Sir,\r\n\r\nif  I  may,  for a moment, go off  at  a  tangent\r\n\r\nhere - it  is  my  intention  that  the  delegation\r\n\r\nshould be not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerely a coalition delegation, because to me  our\r\n\r\nself-government  is  not  a  question  of   party\r\n\r\npolitics,  but I intend to invite some  of  these\r\n\r\n'fire-eating  tough  guys',  if  I  may  use  the\r\n\r\nphrase,  from the opposite Benches  to  join  us.\r\n\r\nWhen we do go to England within nine months,  the\r\n\r\nvery first item on the agenda is going to be  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  a date for complete internal  self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a lawyer, Sir, I am conscious that the\r\n\r\nframing  of  the last paragraph can  be  said  to\r\n\r\nleave  a  very  wide loophole  to  Her  Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment    should   its   intention    be    a\r\n\r\nMachiavellian one; and that, in fact, if  we  are\r\n\r\nto  go  to England next spring it can be said  to\r\n\r\nus,  \"Well,  you  have  been  so  inept  in  your\r\n\r\ngovernment\" - (whether  we  have  been   inept   or\r\n\r\nno) - \"that it is absurd to consider the  question\r\n\r\nof giving you complete self-government, and there\r\n\r\nthe  matter can rest.\" I will say this, Sir, that\r\n\r\nI would consider it regrettable that there should\r\n\r\nbe  this suggestion of putting us on trial, as it\r\n\r\nwere, to prove ourselves worthy of freedom. A man\r\n\r\nhas  a  right to freedom in the same way that  he\r\n\r\nhas  a  right  to  walk  straight,  and  we  walk\r\n\r\nstraight,  by  the  grace of God  and  thanks  to\r\n\r\nnobody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a perfect world, Sir, there would be no\r\n\r\nquestion  of  domination of  a  people,  nor  any\r\n\r\nquestion of exploitation of a people. But I am  a\r\n\r\npractical person, as I hope are all hon.  Members\r\n\r\nwho  are  representatives of the people  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  I  recognise that  we  are  not  in  a\r\n\r\nperfect  world.  I  recognise  that  the  British\r\n\r\npeople   have  considerable  interests  in   this\r\n\r\nterritory   that   are   vital   to   their   own\r\n\r\nwelfare - military  interests,  Sir,  as  well   as\r\n\r\ncommercial interests - but, if I may, Sir, I think\r\n\r\nit  might  be helpful if I were just  to  read  a\r\n\r\nshort paragraph from the Economist of the 6th  of\r\n\r\nthis  month  to give an idea of the feeling  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  about  what is  transpiring  in  this\r\n\r\nterritory:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It was never expected under either the Malayan\r\n\r\nor   the   Singapore  constitution   that   self-government would come anything but gradually, and\r\n\r\nit  was assumed that the process of achieving  it\r\n\r\nwould  destroy  support  for  Communism  in  both\r\n\r\ncountries. But, in fact, the very first elections\r\n\r\nto be held and the entry into office of the first\r\n\r\nlocally-elected Government have been  the  signal\r\n\r\nfor a claim that the process shall be completed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat   once,  that  its  transitional  stages   are\r\n\r\nunworkable.

I believe the  Colonial  Office\r\n\r\nrecognises  that we are sincere in abhorring  the\r\n\r\nthought of being a satellite of Moscow or  Peking\r\n\r\non  the one hand, or even of London on the other.\r\n\r\nBut it is our internal administration, which they\r\n\r\nwish  to  see  stable before they  give  us  this\r\n\r\ncomplete  power. It is seriously suggested,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat   if   our   internal   administration    is\r\n\r\nineffective, we could make it impossible to  hold\r\n\r\nthis  territory for democracy. I and, I know,  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues and those who know Singapore well  are\r\n\r\nconfident  that  we  can  maintain  an  efficient\r\n\r\nadministration  and achieve worthwhile  progress,\r\n\r\nand  because of this confidence, I say if we have\r\n\r\nto  wait  nine  months, we can wait nine  months.\r\n\r\nQuite  apart from anything else, Sir, we have  no\r\n\r\noption - let  us  face  it as practical  people - and\r\n\r\neven  if  we have the option, even if we had  all\r\n\r\nhell's  armoury,  I would  prefer  the  peaceful\r\n\r\nprocess of waiting nine months. The suggestion of\r\n\r\nbeing  put  on  trial  irks  our  pride,  but  if\r\n\r\nhumility for nine months will gain us a date  for\r\n\r\nfreedom,  I  can and will swallow  my  pride  and\r\n\r\nwait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept the good faith of the assurance given\r\n\r\nus today. It is in our hands, Sir, to act soberly\r\n\r\nand  within  nine months to bring home  the  Holy\r\n\r\nGrail. I believe the people of this country would\r\n\r\nwish  us  to  be  patient and would  wish  us  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  generously the solid  achievements  of\r\n\r\ntoday as embodied in this message.

At  a\r\n\r\nglance,  I would agree with him that, so  far  as\r\n\r\nthe Rendel Constitution is concerned, we now have\r\n\r\nthe  Marshall version of the Rendel Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt  is a completely different one from the C.

I agree with the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nthat those first few paragraphs, relating to  the\r\n\r\nexercise of the Governor's discretion when he has\r\n\r\nto   consult  his  Chief  Minister,  do  mean   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable concession - I would not  myself  like\r\n\r\nto  use  the word capitulation. However, I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  to  him  that it was not  humility  that\r\n\r\nobtained that capitulation, as the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nperhaps would now like to imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But may I refer to the last passage which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Finally, in regard to constitutional matters,\r\n\r\nincluding  the fourth point in the Resolution  of\r\n\r\nthe  25th  July, I am authorised to say that  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's  Government will be glad to welcome  to\r\n\r\nLondon   at  a  suitable  date  a  representative\r\n\r\ndelegation   from  Singapore  to   consider   the\r\n\r\nsituation in the light of a year's working of the\r\n\r\nconstitution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of us may have forgotten the actual\r\n\r\nwords  of  the fourth point in the Resolution.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it might be useful if we were to refer  to\r\n\r\nit briefly now.

If  nothing  else,  we\r\n\r\nshould  give  it  the courtesy  of  very  careful\r\n\r\nscrutiny and decide what it actually means before\r\n\r\nwe  go  into  whoops of jubilation, and  ask  you\r\n\r\nagain,  Mr Speaker, to convey a message  of  our\r\n\r\nappreciation to His Excellency, and to thank  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's Secretary of State. We shall be falling\r\n\r\nover  backwards  in no time at the  rate  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing!  Let us know where we are going first.  It\r\n\r\nis not a matter, which should be rushed.

We get  a\r\n\r\nmad  Party that does a double somersault, and  lo\r\n\r\nand  behold, we are on the threshold of immediate\r\n\r\nindependence!  From immediate  independence,  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  at  once  said  immediate  self-government!  From  immediate self-government,  we\r\n\r\nare to thank the Principal Secretary of State for\r\n\r\nthe  Colonies for taking us one step back. We are\r\n\r\nto  thank him for asking us to go to London  next\r\n\r\nyear,  at  some indefinite date, to  talk  things\r\n\r\nover!   Not   to   talk  about  immediate   self-government, but 'to consider the situation in the\r\n\r\nlight of a year's working of the constitution.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

What situation? Perhaps\r\n\r\nwe  may  have changed our minds by then!  We  may\r\n\r\nwant self-government in ten years' time! But  let\r\n\r\nus   remember  this:  that  we  are   a   serious\r\n\r\ndeliberative  Assembly, and although  things  may\r\n\r\nhappen - indeed   so  many  things  have   happened\r\n\r\nfortuitously - when we have passed a Resolution, it\r\n\r\nis not to be discarded lightly. Progressive Party\r\n\r\nMembers  on this side of the House had said,  \"We\r\n\r\nwant immediate independence.\" Then, no doubt like\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P., for the sake of seeking common ground\r\n\r\nwith  all  the other political Parties that  were\r\n\r\nnot  prepared to go as far as they would go, they\r\n\r\nreluctantly accepted a step backward to immediate\r\n\r\nself-government. We all joined in on that  common\r\n\r\nground.  So  far as the people of Singapore  were\r\n\r\nconcerned,   we   took  that  step   because   we\r\n\r\nunderstood  exactly how they felt and  what  they\r\n\r\nwould  have  done to us if we had  flouted  their\r\n\r\nwishes   and   gone  back  to  meet  them.   That\r\n\r\nResolution,  whatever  its  origins,  was  passed\r\n\r\nafter  careful deliberation. Indeed, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  on  that occasion I tried my very  best  to\r\n\r\nprevent  a hasty amendment to that Resolution.  I\r\n\r\nfailed  then. I sincerely hope that  I  will  not\r\n\r\nfail  today  in preventing a hasty discussion  of\r\n\r\nthis  motion.  I  am confident that  I  have  the\r\n\r\nsupport of all those in this House who would  not\r\n\r\nwish  to  be used, as someone has said it,  as  a\r\n\r\nrubber-stamp  to this motion. Although  I  myself\r\n\r\nwould  have  been  prepared to go  on  with  this\r\n\r\nmotion  this afternoon after consulting  with  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  on the actual wording  of  this  last\r\n\r\nparagraph, speaking for my friends on  this  side\r\n\r\nof  the  House, if this motion is proceeded  with\r\n\r\ntoday, we on this side of the House will take  no\r\n\r\npart  in  the proceedings. I hope Members  on  my\r\n\r\nside  of the House will leave the Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister in no doubt that on this occasion  I  am\r\n\r\nspeaking for all of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

I\r\n\r\ncannot accept their views and I cannot understand\r\n\r\ntheir  almost unanimous endeavour to adjourn,  on\r\n\r\nthe  grounds that they cannot understand  a  very\r\n\r\nsimple  form  of words for which a very  detailed\r\n\r\nexplanation has been given by the Chief Minister.\r\n\r\nI  do not think there is anything in that at all.\r\n\r\nThey  do  understand  perfectly  well:  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing they can possibly misunderstand.

But\r\n\r\nthey,  the elected representatives, have not  got\r\n\r\nthe  courage  or  the  conviction  of  their  own\r\n\r\nability to make a decision. They have got  to  go\r\n\r\nback.  They  have  got to hear what  the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes says, or the Sin Pao says! They have got to\r\n\r\nsee what Raffles Place or what Middle Road has to\r\n\r\nsay!  And then they will come back to us and say,\r\n\r\n'Yes, we have now, as democratic representatives,\r\n\r\nmade up our minds.' I say that they must make  up\r\n\r\ntheir minds for themselves, without reference  to\r\n\r\npeople outside this Assembly, and I say that with\r\n\r\nfull  conviction  that  that  is  the  democratic\r\n\r\nprinciple.  They  are elected  to  represent  the\r\n\r\npeople,  but they are not elected to  go  running\r\n\r\nback  to individuals and pressure groups to  seek\r\n\r\nsupport  for  doing what they know in  their  own\r\n\r\nconscience is right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  do  not see any reason for such  violent\r\n\r\naccusations  on  the part of the Front,  although\r\n\r\nwe,  the  four  of us here, are not  in  complete\r\n\r\nagreement  with  most  of  what  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar has said just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are only asking for a little time to consider\r\n\r\nthis very important reply from His Excellency the\r\n\r\nGovernor.

I believe, and I think I know,  that\r\n\r\nMembers  on  this side of the House  are  all  in\r\n\r\ntheir  right senses, and we cannot see  any  good\r\n\r\nreason for a request for an adjournment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar in his speech made\r\n\r\nit  quite clear that he understood even the  last\r\n\r\nparagraph of His Excellency's message. The only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreason  left, therefore, for this adjournment  is\r\n\r\nfor  some Members on the opposite side to consult\r\n\r\nthe  persons  who put them into this  House.  The\r\n\r\nMinister for Communications and Works has made it\r\n\r\nquite clear that it would be unparliamentary  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  go back to these people and say,  'Look\r\n\r\nhere,  we  are faced with this problem.  What  is\r\n\r\nyour opinion on this?' It only shows the lack  of\r\n\r\nconfidence in themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at long last I can now\r\n\r\nheave  a  sigh of relief that the unholy marriage\r\n\r\nbetween  the P.A.P. and the Coalition  Government\r\n\r\nis  no  more! I am indeed very glad because  that\r\n\r\nwas a very dangerous marriage, and now the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwants  to enter into another marriage, a marriage\r\n\r\nwith  somebody  whom they have described  in  the\r\n\r\nmost bitterest of terms!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members over the other side say they want\r\n\r\nan adjournment in order to consult their Parties,\r\n\r\ntheir constituents, and maybe the people who have\r\n\r\nbeen  guiding  them.  Yet, when  the  Progressive\r\n\r\nParty moved an amendment which has now become the\r\n\r\nfamous  fourth point in the Resolution, they  did\r\n\r\nnot  say, 'Wait, Mr Speaker, this is a very  big\r\n\r\nissue.  The Progressives want independence.'  The\r\n\r\nChief  Minister being, as described by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanjong Pagar, a political innocent, moved an\r\n\r\namendment  for  immediate  self-government.   The\r\n\r\nProgressives  then did not raise their  hands  in\r\n\r\nhorror  and  say, 'Mr Speaker, Sir,  please,  we\r\n\r\nmust  have time to go back and consult our Party!\r\n\r\nPlease,  we must have time to go back and consult\r\n\r\nour  constituents!' They did  not  do  that!  Why\r\n\r\nshould  they  want to do it now, Sir,  over  this\r\n\r\nissue  of  an expression of thanks for a  message\r\n\r\nthat has been delivered? Of course, they say that\r\n\r\nthe  fourth  part  has nothing definite.  Surely,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  our  right  senses it  has  never  been\r\n\r\nanticipated  by  any of us that we  could  get  a\r\n\r\ndefinite yes or no today? An answer can  only  be\r\n\r\ngiven   after   consultation.   Where   is    the\r\n\r\nconsultation to take place, Sir? It has  to  take\r\n\r\nplace in London. With whom, Sir? Not with us, but\r\n\r\nwith all of us!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs   that   not   enough?  Is  not  that   answer\r\n\r\nsufficient? You must have consultation before you\r\n\r\ncan  get a definite answer from the Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState for the Colonies; and yet we are threatened\r\n\r\nby  the  other side that unless we  agree  to  an\r\n\r\nadjournment,  they  will not  take  part  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate. We are not perturbed, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the fourth point that has been the\r\n\r\nsource  of all this trouble. It was put into  the\r\n\r\nResolution  by the Progressives. It  started  the\r\n\r\ntrouble  on  25th July. The trouble continued  on\r\n\r\n2nd August, and now the trouble is still with  us\r\n\r\ntoday. I find it very difficult to appreciate the\r\n\r\nstand  taken  by the Progressives in moving  that\r\n\r\namendment.  They opposed the original  motion  of\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister, and yet they  suggested  an\r\n\r\namendment,   which   was  intended   to   achieve\r\n\r\nsomething,  which they never dreamed of.  It  was\r\n\r\nintended  to  go  beyond what  was  meant  to  be\r\n\r\nachieved  by  the original motion  of  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister.   Yet   today,   when   we   have   got\r\n\r\nsatisfaction on the original motion of the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, and also satisfaction in the sense that\r\n\r\nin  regard to this fourth point we will be having\r\n\r\nconsultations in London, leaving only the date to\r\n\r\nbe fixed, they feel that they should want time to\r\n\r\ngo  and consider something about which they, I am\r\n\r\nsure,  have already made up their minds. I oppose\r\n\r\nthe motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It is distressing, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, that on a day which should be a day\r\n\r\nof   joy   for   all  Parties  that   are   truly\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the people, we  should  have  a\r\n\r\ndebate   degenerating  on  a   basis   of   party\r\n\r\nantagonisms and jockeying for political position.\r\n\r\nI have not looked at this victory as a victory of\r\n\r\nthe  Coalition Government. It is a great victory.\r\n\r\nI do not want to crow about it. I am grateful for\r\n\r\nit - a   victory,  I  should  have  thought,   that\r\n\r\neverybody  would have joined happily  in  saying,\r\n\r\n'Thank you' before I asked.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not true that hon. Members opposite have\r\n\r\nhad  no inkling of what was coming. The hon. and\r\n\r\nlearned Member opposite, who did me the courtesy,\r\n\r\nas  a true Malayan, of joining me in the original\r\n\r\nmotion, I thought should have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreciprocal  courtesy, and I did indicate  to  him\r\n\r\nyesterday the identical terminology of the  reply\r\n\r\nto  the fourth point. The suggestion about having\r\n\r\nto consult Middle Road is an absurdity. This is a\r\n\r\nsurrender  of their duties as representatives  of\r\n\r\nthe  people. This is done intentionally: it seeks\r\n\r\nto  destroy  the  impression of what  is  a  true\r\n\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they have before them is not difficult. The\r\n\r\nwhole  issue  has  been before this  country  and\r\n\r\nbefore  this  Assembly for almost  a  month.  The\r\n\r\nreply   is   in  simple  language,  and   it   is\r\n\r\nadmitted - no one seems to have the courage to deny\r\n\r\nit,  not  even the Progressionals - that  it  is  a\r\n\r\ncomplete vindication of our original stand and  a\r\n\r\ncomplete acceptance of this House's request for a\r\n\r\ngenerous spirit of interpretation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth issue, there is far more than we\r\n\r\nhad  thought  of. Much less than  we  asked  for,\r\n\r\nadmittedly. But it is a step forward,  a  radical\r\n\r\nstep  forward, a healthy step forward. 'You  come\r\n\r\nin spring and we will discuss it.' And in view of\r\n\r\nthe spirit in which the other concession has been\r\n\r\ngiven,  it is churlish to see mala fides  in  the\r\n\r\nphraseology.  I  understand,  Sir,  there  is   a\r\n\r\ndisgraceful threat from hon.

It is  not  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  a  colonial  power  directing   and\r\n\r\ncontrolling;  it is a question of  anonymous  and\r\n\r\nhidden  forces without which some Members of  the\r\n\r\nHouse feel they cannot take a decision, and  that\r\n\r\nis  a situation, Mr Speaker, which will call for\r\n\r\nthe  most devoted efforts of all of us if we  are\r\n\r\nto find a happy solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see another sad thing. We have from the\r\n\r\nSecretary  of State through the Governor  a  most\r\n\r\nwelcome concession, a most welcome realisation of\r\n\r\nthe feelings of the people and of the justice  of\r\n\r\nour  claims. It appears - and I am sorry  that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  have not remained here to make  their\r\n\r\nposition clear about it, but in their absence,  I\r\n\r\ncan only give\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  interpretation that seems to me  to  be  the\r\n\r\nonly possible interpretation - that some Members of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition are unwilling to take the  course\r\n\r\nof  co-operation and goodwill. They seem to  feel\r\n\r\nthat   unless  a  thing  is  achieved  at   great\r\n\r\nsuffering by violent methods, by the shedding  of\r\n\r\nblood,  by  death and agony - unless those  methods\r\n\r\nare used, a real victory cannot be won.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It used to be a favourite saying of the extreme\r\n\r\nLeft,   of  the  Communists  and  their   fellow-travellers,  that \"property will shoot\",  meaning\r\n\r\nthat you may talk to your exploiters, you can get\r\n\r\nnice  words from them, but when it comes  to  the\r\n\r\nreal push, they will fight sooner than yield  one\r\n\r\ninch  to your demands. That phrase \"property will\r\n\r\nshoot\"  was  used again and again to justify  the\r\n\r\ntheories  of violent revolution, and  I  have  an\r\n\r\nunhappy  feeling that that same idea is operating\r\n\r\nin  the minds of some of the Opposition. They are\r\n\r\nunable to accept a gesture of goodwill; they  are\r\n\r\nunable  to  believe that anybody can be  trusted;\r\n\r\nthey are unable to believe that the Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState  and  the  Government behind  him  and  the\r\n\r\nBritish  people  behind  them  have  any  genuine\r\n\r\nwillingness  to  concede the principle  of  self-government to us. They have no grounds  for  that\r\n\r\ndisbelief: they have got example after example of\r\n\r\nthe  territories  which have  been  granted  full\r\n\r\nindependence - India,  Pakistan,  Burma,  Ceylon,\r\n\r\nAustralia and Canada. We heard them all from  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner-General  in  his   birthday   speech\r\n\r\nyesterday, but they cannot believe, in  spite  of\r\n\r\nthat,  that  the  same thing could  happen  here.\r\n\r\nConsequently, I very much fear that there will be\r\n\r\npeople who may seek to prejudice this victory, to\r\n\r\nmisrepresent it, to try to turn it into  a  means\r\n\r\nof strife and violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say this, Mr Speaker, because I am so\r\n\r\nprofoundly  convinced that  in  most  situations,\r\n\r\nreason and good sense and perseverance can  solve\r\n\r\none's  difficulties  and  that  the  desire   for\r\n\r\nviolence  is a psychopathic desire which  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary  for achieving a victory  such  as  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister has been able to  bring  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Mr Speaker do express to His Excellency\r\n\r\nthe Governor our appreciation of his message, and\r\n\r\nrequest  that  His  Excellency,  on  our  behalf,\r\n\r\nshould thank Her Majesty's Principal Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState   for  the  Colonies  for  his  sympathetic\r\n\r\napproach to our aspirations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PROTEST BY S.I.T.
