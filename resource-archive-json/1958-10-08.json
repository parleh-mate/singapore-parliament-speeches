At the beginning of 1957,\r\n\r\nhowever,  vernacular languages became a compulsory  part\r\n\r\nof the curricula in English schools, although it was not\r\n\r\nalways  possible then to get enough vernacular teachers.\r\n\r\nHowever, Chinese is not affected in this respect and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry  has an adequate number of Chinese teachers  in\r\n\r\nEnglish schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Primary schools good progress is being made,\r\n\r\nthough naturally some pupils are not very diligent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Chinese teachers in English schools have\r\n\r\nbeen trained and others are undergoing training. This is\r\n\r\ntending to make the pupils more interested in the  study\r\n\r\nof Chinese. Furthermore, vernacular language marks count\r\n\r\ntowards  a pupil's position in class and this  gives  an\r\n\r\nincentive to study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Secondary schools in Forms II and III good\r\n\r\nprogress is being made.

Since  the  Command Paper was published,  there\r\n\r\nhave   been   continuing  attempts  by  supporters   of\r\n\r\nCommunism  to undermine the authority of the Government\r\n\r\nand  it  has  been  necessary to  detain  a  number  of\r\n\r\nsubversive  elements who had succeeded in  establishing\r\n\r\nthemselves  in  positions of authority  in  respectable\r\n\r\ndemocratic institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 1957 subversive elements succeeded in\r\n\r\ngaining  control of the Central Executive Committee  of\r\n\r\nthe People's Action Party and were actively engaged  in\r\n\r\npromoting the interests of the Communist Front  amongst\r\n\r\nstudents  and  trade unions. Had these activities  been\r\n\r\nallowed  to  continue unchecked, there is little  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  they would shortly have presented a grave  threat\r\n\r\nto   the   security   of  Singapore.   The   Government\r\n\r\naccordingly   decided   to  take   action   under   the\r\n\r\nPreservation of Public Security Ordinance against these\r\n\r\nevil  forces.  The justification for  such  action  was\r\n\r\namply  proved  when out of 20 P.A.P. leaders  arrested,\r\n\r\ntwo confessed to being Communists, five were identified\r\n\r\nas  members of the Communist under around organisation,\r\n\r\nand  the Appeal Tribunal confirmed the detention orders\r\n\r\nmade  in  every single case. At the same time,  it  was\r\n\r\nconsidered necessary to arrest and detain 15  so-called\r\n\r\ntrade  union  leaders  who were known  Communist  Front\r\n\r\nworkers.  In  their  cases  also  the  Appeal  Tribunal\r\n\r\nconfirmed the detention orders. From statements made by\r\n\r\nthose detained and from documents seized at the time of\r\n\r\ntheir  arrest,  there was ample evidence  to  show  the\r\n\r\nintentions   of   these  people  to  penetrate   legal,\r\n\r\ndemocratic   organisations  in  Singapore  and,   after\r\n\r\nassuming  control, to exploit their legal aims  in  the\r\n\r\nfurtherance of Communist policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some Communist extremists were concentrating\r\n\r\ntheir  attention on political parties and trade unions,\r\n\r\nothers were directing their efforts to the subversion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof students. It was known that a number of student\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  Communist Front were responsible  for\r\n\r\norganising  student picnics and social  gatherings  for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of indoctrinating those who attended  with\r\n\r\nCommunist  ideologies. At the end  of  September  1957,\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  arrest  of  the  ringleaders  of   this\r\n\r\ncampaign,  19 detention orders were made and confirmed.\r\n\r\nDocuments  recovered during Police  operations  against\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese students proved the Communist sympathies of those\r\n\r\narrested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in 1958 Communist sympathisers turned their\r\n\r\nattention  to a campaign designed to inculcate  in  the\r\n\r\npopulation   feelings  of  hatred  and  dissatisfaction\r\n\r\ntowards  democratic government and the existing  social\r\n\r\norder.  So-called  \"cultural  companies\"  published  or\r\n\r\ndistributed  booklets criticising  the  Governments  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation of Malaya and praising the\r\n\r\nCommunist terrorists in the Federation as patriots  and\r\n\r\nfighters  for their motherland, Malaya. In an operation\r\n\r\nin  March  1958,  the  Police  raided  8  premises  and\r\n\r\nrecovered  over  2,000  of these undesirable  booklets.\r\n\r\nEvidence was obtained which showed that these \"cultural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies\"    were    distributing   the    undesirable\r\n\r\npublications  in  the Federation  and  in  Sarawak  and\r\n\r\nfurther evidence proved the association of one  of  the\r\n\r\ncompanies  with  Malayan  Communist  Party  members  in\r\n\r\nJohore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By May 1958 information was available to the Police\r\n\r\nthat  Communist \"power groups\" still exist in Singapore\r\n\r\nand are made up of highly indoctrinated and experienced\r\n\r\nCommunist personnel. The duty of these power groups  is\r\n\r\nto  use their influence in specific operations such  as\r\n\r\nelection  campaigns or the capture of control of  trade\r\n\r\nunions  or  political  parties.  Information  has  been\r\n\r\nreceived  that extremist control of the P.A.P.  Central\r\n\r\nExecutive  Committee  was achieved  in  precisely  this\r\n\r\nmanner  in  August last year.

I  cannot  see\r\n\r\nthe   necessity  for  extending  the  period  of   that\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister just now quoted the activities of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. leaders and the students. All these  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders and the students who were considered subversive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat that time are now under detention; some of them have\r\n\r\nbeen  banished. So I cannot see any reason why the life\r\n\r\nof this Bill should be extended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Ordinance was first introduced, the then\r\n\r\nChief Minister who was the architect of this Bill,  had\r\n\r\nthis  to  say. I quote from column 702 of  the  Hansard\r\n\r\ndated 21st September, 1955:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Sir, there have been some criticisms - on the face of\r\n\r\nthem  legitimate,  and  some of  them,  in  fact,  very\r\n\r\nconstructive - directed against this Bill. The first  one\r\n\r\nI will deal with is that it seeks to make law for three\r\n\r\nyears what has so far been law for only three months at\r\n\r\na  time.  In  the past we had to renew this  law  every\r\n\r\nthree  months. The question of renewal of a  law  every\r\n\r\nthree  months was based on the concept of the existence\r\n\r\nof an emergency.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This Government has never avoided, and so long as I\r\n\r\nsurvive\" -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>unfortunately, he never survived his term of office -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"on this side will never avoid its responsibilities.\r\n\r\nand instead of making it four years and 'passing the\r\n\r\nbuck' to the next government, we will have to face this\r\n\r\nHouse, at least five months before its dissolution...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, as I said, unfortunately, the then Chief Minister\r\n\r\ndid not survive his term\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  office or else he may now have to swallow  his  own\r\n\r\nwords.  He  has clearly stated, Sir, that  he  did  not\r\n\r\nintend to make this Ordinance a permanent one. If  that\r\n\r\nis  so,  why then extend the period from three to  four\r\n\r\nyears?  If  it is not going to be permanent, it  should\r\n\r\nnot  be extended. By extending the period for one  more\r\n\r\nyear, there is the likelihood that it may again have to\r\n\r\ncome  to this House for a further extension. After  one\r\n\r\nyear and another, it may then become permanent. Is this\r\n\r\nthe  policy of the Government, Sir, and if that is  so,\r\n\r\nis  it the intention of the Government to tie the hands\r\n\r\nof the next Government which may come into power?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Ordinance, originally introduced and approved,\r\n\r\ncame  into operation on 21st October, 1955, which means\r\n\r\nthat  it  will expire on 21st October this  year.  With\r\n\r\nthis  amending  Bill,  Sir, the  period  will  then  be\r\n\r\nextended to 21st October, 1959. Sir, let us look at  it\r\n\r\nthis  way. How long is the life of this Assembly?  When\r\n\r\nwill  this Assembly be dissolved and when is  the  next\r\n\r\nelection  to be held? According to the Chief  Minister,\r\n\r\nhe  said  that he will have the election by March  next\r\n\r\nyear. Then if the election is to be held by March  next\r\n\r\nyear  and the life of this Assembly is up to March next\r\n\r\nyear,  why  extend  the life of this Ordinance  further\r\n\r\nthan  March, 1959? I think the Government is trying  to\r\n\r\npass the buck to the next Government, according to what\r\n\r\nthe then Chief Minister who framed this Ordinance said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New clause 3 of the Bill, Sir, seeks power to be\r\n\r\ngiven to the Chief Secretary if the Governor in Council\r\n\r\nis  satisfied to extend the period of detention for two\r\n\r\nyears to a further period not exceeding 12 months at  a\r\n\r\ntime. Again, Sir, when the Ordinance was passed, it was\r\n\r\non  the  very  clear understanding that the  period  of\r\n\r\ndetention would only be for two years and no more.  Why\r\n\r\nthis sudden change of attitude, Sir, on the part of the\r\n\r\nGovernment? Is it to prevent our colleague  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bukit  Timah (Mr Lim Ching Siong) from contesting\r\n\r\nthe  next  election?  Is  that  the  intention  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment so that he may be further\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndetained  while the Assembly dissolves and  we  contest\r\n\r\nthe  next  election?

It\r\n\r\nhas  resulted in my tabling a motion on 21st April this\r\n\r\nyear  on  the torture of detainees. The Hon, the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary is holding his head because he denied at that\r\n\r\ntime that there was torture by the Police. Whether that\r\n\r\nis  true or not, I leave it to the public to decide, it\r\n\r\nhas  been  debated and I am not prepared to  debate  it\r\n\r\nfurther.  If  any Member would like me to  refresh  his\r\n\r\nmemory, I would refer him to columns 263 to 270 of  the\r\n\r\nHansard (Vol. 3). There he will find reference  to  the\r\n\r\ntorture. Apart from this alleged torture, I have on the\r\n\r\nOrder Paper another motion in my name. This is again as\r\n\r\na   result  of  the  Preservation  of  Public  Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance.

As I have said, it is a question of whether\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore will accept this Bill. With all\r\n\r\nthe  experience of alleged torture - I call it  \"alleged\"\r\n\r\ninstead  of \"actual\" because the Chief Minister  denied\r\n\r\nit - and  of  banishment, I am sure that  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  do not want this Bill at all.

Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to  protest against this Bill. The Chief Minister\r\n\r\nhas  just  given a catalogue of reasons why  he  thinks\r\n\r\nsuch  an  undemocratic measure is so necessary for  the\r\n\r\ndemocracy of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say that since last year, many people\r\n\r\nhave  been arrested and detained, and no valid  reasons\r\n\r\nwere  given  to this Assembly or in public  why  a  few\r\n\r\npeople have been released and many of them are still in\r\n\r\ndetention  camps. One example I have  in  mind  is  the\r\n\r\nrecent   release  of  Dr  Chuang.  He   was   released\r\n\r\nimmediately after the defeat of the Labour Front in the\r\n\r\nKallang  by-election.  One  would  have  thought   that\r\n\r\nprobably  he  was  detained  because  he  was  plotting\r\n\r\nagainst the Labour Front election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Minister is not the first politician\r\n\r\nwho,  in  the  name  of  democracy,  seeks  to  destroy\r\n\r\ndemocracy  by  jailing his political  opponents.  There\r\n\r\nwere men before him and there might be men after him to\r\n\r\nfollow his procedure. When I look at the vacant seat of\r\n\r\nthe Member for Bukit Timah which was caused through the\r\n\r\noperation  of this Ordinance, I feel like  asking  this\r\n\r\nHouse to observe two minutes' silence in honour of that\r\n\r\nAssemblyman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Silence by you in the House!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Yes.

Sir,\r\n\r\n1  said once that a man who holds the gun will say  the\r\n\r\nother  man is a subversive.

I\r\n\r\nwas  sorry to hear the Hon, the Chief Minister read his\r\n\r\nrecital  of  subversive activities since the  Bill  was\r\n\r\npassed  three years ago. It did not carry that ring  of\r\n\r\nconviction   of   someone  who  had   been   intimately\r\n\r\nassociated with the problem. It sounded like a  recital\r\n\r\nhaving been composed and prepared by someone else.  We,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  the People's Action Party compose and prepare\r\n\r\nour own symphony, and I came to this House today with a\r\n\r\nstatement  on  (1) what we intend to debate,  which  is\r\n\r\nimportant, and (2) what some people might want to  know\r\n\r\nabout what we intend to do next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome the form in which the extension to the\r\n\r\nPreservation of Public Security Ordinance is being\r\n\r\nsought, as an amending Bill to extend it from three to\r\n\r\nfour years - one extra year to cover the extended life of\r\n\r\nthe Labour Front Coalition Government until it dies\r\n\r\nwith this Assembly in April next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes it easier and simpler for us to state our\r\n\r\nposition clearly and succinctly. Three and a half years\r\n\r\nago, the People's Action Party fought and won three out\r\n\r\nof the four seats it contested. One of its promises was\r\n\r\nto oppose the Emergency Regulations. Six months after\r\n\r\nthat, the former leader of the Government, one David\r\n\r\nSaul Marshall, tried a sleight of hand in this\r\n\r\nAssembly. As he brought in the Preservation of Public\r\n\r\nSecurity Ordinance with his right, he gallantly struck\r\n\r\nout the Emergency Regulations with his left. We opposed\r\n\r\nit then, and there is nothing that has happened since\r\n\r\nSeptember 1955 to have changed our position from what\r\n\r\nit was in September 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain, Sir. We were elected on an election\r\n\r\npromise to oppose, and we honour our promises. This is\r\n\r\nfundamental to the democratic system; that important\r\n\r\nissues are placed before the electorate by those\r\n\r\ncontesting for power. Whoever is returned to represent\r\n\r\nthe people has a mandate to do what he promised to do.\r\n\r\nThis is the essence of the democratic system, otherwise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit ceases to have a meaning. If you have people\r\n\r\nperiodically and systematically presenting one point of\r\n\r\nview at election time, and, having been elected, they\r\n\r\nthen proceed to do the opposite, then the whole\r\n\r\ndemocratic machinery is negated. If there is to be a\r\n\r\ndeparture from any fundamental pledge given in an\r\n\r\nelection, then that mandate must be returned and a new\r\n\r\nmandate sought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Labour Front wants to know why the people\r\n\r\nthink that it is anti a lot of things including anti-democracy, civilisation, Chinese, Asian, and why it is\r\n\r\ngoing down the drain. I say, six months from the time\r\n\r\nthey won the election, they began to die because they,\r\n\r\nthrough the then Chief Minister, had perpetrated one of\r\n\r\nthe biggest election frauds in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalayan  history.  They made the Emergency  Regulations\r\n\r\nand  its  abolition a crucial issue. Six  months  after\r\n\r\nthat,  they  thought that by changing names they  could\r\n\r\nget  away with it. What the present Chief Minister said\r\n\r\nthis  morning  would have carried more  conviction  and\r\n\r\nmore weight if he had the mandate to do and say all the\r\n\r\nthings he has done and said, but deep down in his heart\r\n\r\nhe  knows  that  he had been a party  to  an  electoral\r\n\r\nconfidence trick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that we are not required by law,\r\n\r\nonce  having been elected, to abide by what we promised\r\n\r\nwhen we were elected. By law he who wins an election is\r\n\r\na  member for the term of his years of office,  and  he\r\n\r\ncan  with impunity do whatever he likes during his term\r\n\r\nof  office.  But the law does require that  his  office\r\n\r\nshould come to an end and, if he chooses to go on, then\r\n\r\nhe  must seek a new mandate. When that time comes those\r\n\r\nwho  have  forgotten what they promised the  last  time\r\n\r\nwill   discover  that  the  people  place  very  little\r\n\r\nreliance on what they promise this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the secret of long life in politics is not the\r\n\r\ncontinual  formation, dissolution  and  reformation  of\r\n\r\npolitical parties, fronts or movements. It is only  the\r\n\r\ndissolute  and  the  debauched who  become  prematurely\r\n\r\naged,  and  who have to go in search of that elixir  of\r\n\r\nlife  to give them back their lost youth and their lost\r\n\r\nvigour. So it is that some people believe that,  having\r\n\r\ndebauched  themselves in one political party or  front,\r\n\r\nthey can, like the phoenix, arise from the ashes of the\r\n\r\nold  in  the feathers of a new party, front or movement\r\n\r\nas  fresh  as  if nothing had happened. In  fact,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  such  magic  formula  for  longevity  in\r\n\r\npolitical  life other than the simple and the  obvious:\r\n\r\njust  honour your promises; do not corrupt and  debauch\r\n\r\nyour  party. I am confident that he who does that  will\r\n\r\nfind  that the people are as ready to believe  what  he\r\n\r\nsays the next time, as what he said the last time. When\r\n\r\nyou  go  back to renew your mandate, having  faithfully\r\n\r\nexecuted  the  last one, you will find  that  there  is\r\n\r\nreliance on what you are now saying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, quite simply, the People's Action\r\n\r\nParty  has  no mandate to vote for the Preservation  of\r\n\r\nPublic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecurity Ordinance. But, there may be people - I am quite\r\n\r\nsure that there may be some in important positions  not\r\n\r\nonly in Singapore but across the Causeway -  who may want\r\n\r\nto know what the People's Action Party propose to do in\r\n\r\nthe next elections. Is it going to repeat the same anti-Emergency  Regulations stand? Is it going to make  this\r\n\r\nan  election  issue, and then having won the  elections\r\n\r\nseek   to   abolish   the  Emergency  Regulations   and\r\n\r\nprecipitate a crisis? Under normal conditions,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould  tell such nosey and curious people to  wait  for\r\n\r\nthe proper time in the next few months when we shall be\r\n\r\nissuing our election manifesto. But it may be that  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya would like to know  its  position\r\n\r\nvis  a  vis Singapore after the next general elections,\r\n\r\nbecause  the Federation of Malaya has to be represented\r\n\r\non   our  Internal  Security  Council  under  the   new\r\n\r\nConstitution. In fact, it is to have the decisive vote.\r\n\r\nWhat  is to happen to these Emergency laws is a  matter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  some considerable importance to them, because there\r\n\r\nare now two political situations; one in the Federation\r\n\r\nand  one  in Singapore, both distinct and separate  and\r\n\r\nself-contained, with a cordon sanitaire in the  Straits\r\n\r\nof Johore. And they would like to know whether there is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  a crisis immediately after  the  general\r\n\r\nelections,  with an emergency meeting of  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Council summoned by the British to oppose  any\r\n\r\nintended  moves to abolish the Preservation  of  Public\r\n\r\nSecurity Ordinance. In such a situation, the Federation\r\n\r\nmay find themselves in the embarrassing position of (1)\r\n\r\nvoting   with   the  British  against   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nrepresentatives;  or  (2)  voting  with  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  to  abolish the Emergency  laws  which\r\n\r\nthey in the Federation still consider necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because this is a fundamental issue that I have\r\n\r\na  mandate  from  my  Party to  state  now  our  future\r\n\r\nposition. If it were the British Government in  control\r\n\r\nof the Federation of Malaya, as it was three years ago,\r\n\r\nwe  would still oppose the Emergency laws as vehemently\r\n\r\nas  we  did three years ago, because then the Emergency\r\n\r\nlaw could be used and were sometimes used, not only  to\r\n\r\ncurb  the  Communists, but also to  curb  the  militant\r\n\r\nNationalists. It was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  simple  issue  then  of the  people  versus  British\r\n\r\nimperialism,  and  we  stated  unequivocally  where  we\r\n\r\nstood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we were asked to vote for these laws three\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  we  opposed them, for the  centre  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in the Federation was the High Commissioner\r\n\r\nand  his nominated officials, and in Singapore  it  was\r\n\r\nthen, and now is still, in the triumvirate of the three\r\n\r\nofficial  Ministers headed by the Governor  with  over-riding powers. These are men who are not answerable  to\r\n\r\nthe  people. Their masters are not in Singapore but  in\r\n\r\nLondon. In that situation, we allied ourselves with all\r\n\r\nthe  anti-colonial forces to fight colonialism  and  we\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  do so until the  last  vestiges  of\r\n\r\ncolonial rule are removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, however, partly as a result of scheming by\r\n\r\nthe British Raj and partly because of the accidents  of\r\n\r\nhistory,  we  are faced with a separate and independent\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya with no prospects in the immediate\r\n\r\nfuture  of our becoming independent. Next year, we  are\r\n\r\nto  be  only  internally  self-governing,  and  in  all\r\n\r\nsecurity  matters which effect defence upon  which  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the British Governments  disagree,  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government is to be the arbiter. We accepted\r\n\r\nthat  position because we accepted merger as  the  only\r\n\r\nway  to independence. If we are prepared to accept  the\r\n\r\nFederation and join it as a member state, then it means\r\n\r\nthat   we   are   prepared  to  allow  the   Government\r\n\r\nrepresenting the 11 States in the Federation to have  a\r\n\r\ndecisive voice in the affairs of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is still our position and it will be our\r\n\r\nposition  for all the years to come until merger.  This\r\n\r\nis  the  basic analysis of our political situation.  If\r\n\r\nthat   analysis   is  correct,  then  certain   logical\r\n\r\nconsequences follow. We must recognise that  our  over-riding objective is merger and that means that we  must\r\n\r\nacknowledge that until merger the over-riding interests\r\n\r\nof   the   Federation  must  prevail  over   Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  say  that if we are the  Government  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we will take no steps which will  undermine\r\n\r\nthe interests of the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Party of the \"Left\", we may not always agree or\r\n\r\nsee  eye  to  eye with a Party of the \"Right\",  as  the\r\n\r\nTunku has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonce  called the United Malay Nationalist Organisation.\r\n\r\nBut   we   can  assure  them  that  their   views   and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsusceptibilities  will  be  given  the   most   careful\r\n\r\nconsideration  by  us. We state our stand  now  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion of the Emergency laws, and it is this: that as\r\n\r\nlong  as they are necessary for the maintenance of  the\r\n\r\nsecurity  of  the  Federation, so  long  will  they  be\r\n\r\nnecessary for Singapore. Sir, we state this now in  the\r\n\r\nfull  knowledge  and anticipation that  there  will  be\r\n\r\npolitical bankrupts and charlatans, those who have, and\r\n\r\nthose  who  have  not ever graced the  chairs  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, who will make promises to abolish them in the\r\n\r\nnext  elections. We have met such types before, and  we\r\n\r\nexpect  to  meet them in the next elections. When  that\r\n\r\ntime  comes, we shall justify our view and  our  stand,\r\n\r\nthat  there will be no abolition of the Emergency  laws\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  until they have been  abolished  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation. Those who want the Emergency laws abolished\r\n\r\nin Singapore should try to help to establish conditions\r\n\r\nof  peace  and security in the Federation so that  they\r\n\r\nmay no longer be required there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Government or any person that seeks in the next\r\n\r\nelections  to  say that they will abolish these  powers\r\n\r\nwill be faced with three positions if they proceed with\r\n\r\nand  honour  their promise. Three things can happen - (1)\r\n\r\neither the Federation Government votes with the British\r\n\r\nagainst  the Singapore representatives, it having  been\r\n\r\nthoroughly antagonized already at that stage  and  then\r\n\r\nthe  Government  fails with consequent  antagonism  and\r\n\r\nhostility  between  the  British  and  us,   which   is\r\n\r\nunimportant,  but  also between the Federation  and  us\r\n\r\nwhich  is important; or (2) the unlikely event  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation representative saying that he will vote with\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  representatives  and  abolish  it  for\r\n\r\nSingapore and allow Singapore, if necessary,  to  be  a\r\n\r\nrest  camp  and  a  base  for Malayan  Communist  Party\r\n\r\nactivities in the Federation; or (3) he may abstain and\r\n\r\na  deadlock is created. I am not sure which of the  two\r\n\r\nprobabilities is the more probable; their  voting  with\r\n\r\nthe  British against the Singapore representatives,  or\r\n\r\ntheir  abstaining  and creating .a  political  deadlock\r\n\r\nwhich may end up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the  suspension of the Constitution. But  he  who\r\n\r\nmakes  these promises must be prepared to face his  way\r\n\r\nout  of  that  dilemma.  Before these  laws  have  been\r\n\r\nabolished in the Federation, any man who believes  that\r\n\r\nhe  can  abolish  them in Singapore  needs  to  have  a\r\n\r\npsychiatric  examination. Before these conditions  have\r\n\r\nbeen   brought  about,  however,  let  all  intelligent\r\n\r\npersons,   including  those  who   have   been   called\r\n\r\nintelligent persons by the Secretary of State  for  the\r\n\r\nColonies,  for they knowing this full well  proceed  to\r\n\r\npromise  these  things  in  the  elections,  let   them\r\n\r\nremember that cheats and liars are very easily  exposed\r\n\r\nand when they do, humiliation follows with a vengeance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was thrilled to hear the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\n(Mr  Lee Choon Eng), and went into rapturous ecstasies\r\n\r\nwhen  I  heard the Member for Farrer Park  (Mr  A.  R.\r\n\r\nLazarous)  who,  because he had more cars  on  election\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nday,  defeated his opponent, my comrade Mr Devan Nair,\r\n\r\nand he still is my comrade -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Those who ordinarily believe that they can out-P.A.P. the  P.A.P. will find that they  are  over  the\r\n\r\nabyss  where all good Communists or bad democrats  are.\r\n\r\nSir,  we are the extreme left of the democratic  front,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe genuine extreme left.

I once advised him when he was in\r\n\r\nLondon for the Constitutional Talks, that before making\r\n\r\nrash promises about resigning and quitting politics, he\r\n\r\nshould consider the consequences of his action,  if  he\r\n\r\ntried  to be more militant and vigorous than the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nHe  discovered subsequently that he had overplayed  his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhand. He tried again in the City Council Election,  and\r\n\r\nlooked  as if he was recovering his hand, and  he  made\r\n\r\nthe biggest bid of all in the Kallang by-elections, and\r\n\r\nhe lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are unmoved by temporary successes or\r\n\r\ndefeats.  We  are  the products  of  a  movement,  a\r\n\r\nmovement which began with the Japanese occupation of\r\n\r\nMalaya, and which released all those forces of pride\r\n\r\nand  self-respect in the subject peoples of Asia and\r\n\r\nmade them determined never again to allow themselves\r\n\r\nto  be dominated by foreign powers. Nobody plied  me\r\n\r\nwith  tracts,  Sir,  to become a politician.  Nobody\r\n\r\ntaught me Marx and Engels, Lenin and Stalin. We were\r\n\r\ncreated by ambitions, not by special agents,  and  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that if we are able to face the future  with\r\n\r\nfirmness  and  courage and with a  determination  to\r\n\r\nsucceed, we shall succeed, for if we fail, then  let\r\n\r\nme  tell the Member for Farrer Park - I am quite  sure\r\n\r\nhe will be the first to flee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all colonial territories that have gained\r\n\r\ntheir independence since the end of the Second World\r\n\r\nWar   have   equipped  themselves   with   Emergency\r\n\r\nLaws - India,  Pakistan, Burma, even Ceylon,  and  now\r\n\r\nGhana.  Now, Sir, I do not suggest - I see no Members\r\n\r\non  the Front Bench there who can be as tough as Mr\r\n\r\nUdesi,  the  Minister  for Home  Affairs  in  Ghana,\r\n\r\nexcept perhaps the Minister for Education (Mr  Chew\r\n\r\nSwee  Kee)  who looks quite tough! But I  would  say\r\n\r\nthis,  that having seen the historical evolution  of\r\n\r\nthese  territories, we would be foolish to  try  and\r\n\r\nbeguile  ourselves with unsophisticated  phrases  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy and liberty and human rights and  freedom,\r\n\r\nwhile we go down the drain. Our situation is neither\r\n\r\nnew  nor unique in the history of mankind, and I say\r\n\r\nquite  frankly  that we shall learn  from  what  has\r\n\r\nhappened  in these other countries, and  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment will equip itself with Emergency powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we also wish to say that the use of these\r\n\r\nEmergency  powers  depends upon  the  stand  of  the\r\n\r\npersons who are equipped with them, and we stand for\r\n\r\nan  independent,  democratic, non-Communist  Malaya.\r\n\r\nWithin  this  democratic system,  everyone  has  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nright to compete, to preach his political views, but\r\n\r\nthe  competition must be for the purpose of  working\r\n\r\nthe  system, not of destroying it. These powers will\r\n\r\nnot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  allowed  to be used against political  opponents\r\n\r\nwithin the system who compete for the right to  work\r\n\r\nthe  system. That is fundamental and basic,  or  the\r\n\r\npowers  will  have destroyed the purpose  for  which\r\n\r\nthey  were forged. If in using these powers you,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  negate the purpose for which you  made  them,\r\n\r\nthen  you will end up with a situation where  force,\r\n\r\nand more force, will become increasingly necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the Chief Minister, since he\r\n\r\nhas   recited  all  the  good  deeds  he  has  done,\r\n\r\nincluding  rescuing - one of the popular  beliefs  in\r\n\r\ntown  is  that the Labour Front rescued  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  think they should credit us with  a  little\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  intelligence  and  political  skill  than   is\r\n\r\ncommonly  believed possible in so-called extremists.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, let me get the arithmetic right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  moderate factor so-called, we have never called\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nourselves  moderates because we like to be honest - we\r\n\r\nare not moderates and therefore we do not pretend to\r\n\r\nbe - and  those  who  thought we were  moderates  were\r\n\r\nquite alarmed when we won the City Council elections\r\n\r\nand  they discovered that we were not moderates, but\r\n\r\nwe  are  non-Communists and we have said so. In  the\r\n\r\nfirst place, we did not lose control of the Party to\r\n\r\nthose  who wanted to capture the Party - and  I  will\r\n\r\nnot say whether they are Communists or not since the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister is so well informed  but  would  not\r\n\r\ndisclose  his sources we fought to a draw,  that  is\r\n\r\nthe  first point to remember, six-all, and we  knew,\r\n\r\nwhat  was more, that the other side had a weak  link\r\n\r\nbecause it was really five/six - and we knew full well\r\n\r\nit would in a crisis crack up, and crises there were\r\n\r\ngalore. Sir, if the Chief Minister believed that  he\r\n\r\nrescued  the P.A.P., then naturally he must  comfort\r\n\r\nhimself  with  the thought that perhaps  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwould  be  grateful  to him for  having  tried,  not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhaving rescued the P.A.P., to drown the chaps whom  he\r\n\r\nfished out of the water. We have no gratitude to him\r\n\r\nfor trying to do that, and we tell him quite plainly\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbluntly  that if he wants to make political  capital\r\n\r\nout  of this we will give him more than he can  give\r\n\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are three things in the catalogue of\r\n\r\nevents and good deeds that he has done on behalf  of\r\n\r\nthe  people without having informed them first  that\r\n\r\nhe  wanted  to do all these things. But he  did  not\r\n\r\nlisten  and  I  am  making these, I  would  not  say\r\n\r\ncharges,  but  I am making these statements  in  the\r\n\r\nfull  knowledge that everybody outside shares  these\r\n\r\nsuspicions - that he has been playing  the  fool  with\r\n\r\nhuman  lives and liberties. How else can he  explain\r\n\r\nwhy  he  arrested Dr Chuang Chu Lin, held  him  for\r\n\r\nmany months as a dangerous tool who has been used by\r\n\r\nthe   Communists,  and  then,  without  a  word   of\r\n\r\nexplanation,  released him in order  that  he  could\r\n\r\ngratefully  shake the hands of the  Chief  Minister?\r\n\r\nWhy  did  he  arrest and detain Linda Chen  for  two\r\n\r\nyears  and  tell the world that she was a  dangerous\r\n\r\nCommunist, and then without so much as an expression\r\n\r\nof  regret,  release her as the  others  were  being\r\n\r\nbanished to China?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did he give Mr Lim Kean Chye an entry permit\r\n\r\nand  then have him arrested when he arrived? Did  he\r\n\r\nnot   know  that  there  would  be  retaliation  and\r\n\r\nconsequences in the Federation? Here was a  man  who\r\n\r\nhad  been  trying  for years to get  back  into  the\r\n\r\nFederation  as of right, as a Federal  citizen,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government have refused him  because\r\n\r\nthey  said that under the Constitution he  had  been\r\n\r\naway for more than five years; and knowing full well\r\n\r\nthese  things, he gave him an entry permit, got  the\r\n\r\nman  clapped in gaol, succeeded in antagonizing  the\r\n\r\nFederation   to  a  point  where  they   immediately\r\n\r\npromulgated  a new set of laws to control  movements\r\n\r\nacross the causeway. Before anybody with a right  of\r\n\r\nentry  into Singapore had a right of entry into  the\r\n\r\nFederation. Now the position has altered not only to\r\n\r\nthe  detriment  of  this  one  person,  but  to  the\r\n\r\ndetriment  of  the  people of  Singapore  generally,\r\n\r\nbecause  the Chief Minister or his Government  chose\r\n\r\nto act in such an arbitrary and desperate fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSheer recklessness. I say this - no Government has the\r\n\r\nright  to play politics with the lives and liberties\r\n\r\nof  people, be they its citizens or no.  And  I  say\r\n\r\nthis  now  for the benefit of all, that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment will not allow these powers to be used in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis reckless fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let this also be made known, that our definition of\r\n\r\nthe word \"subversion\" is probably different from the\r\n\r\nBritish definition of that term, and maybe even from\r\n\r\nthe     Labour    Front    definition    of     that\r\n\r\nterm - \"subversion\". In our definition \"subversion\" is\r\n\r\nany  political activity designed to further the aims\r\n\r\nand  interests not of our own people but of  foreign\r\n\r\npowers;  and  by  foreign powers we  mean  not  just\r\n\r\nRussia and China, but also America and Formosa,  and\r\n\r\nthe Western bloc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let those who are interested to know where we stand\r\n\r\ndraw  a  lesson from the fate of David Saul Marshall\r\n\r\nand the Labour Front. Let them take it to heart, for\r\n\r\nthat is the way how not to win elections. We in  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action  Party  would  prefer  to  lose  an\r\n\r\nelection  rather than win it on false  premises  and\r\n\r\npromises.  We have grown from strength to  strength,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  are  honest and  because  what  we  say\r\n\r\npublicly  we honour publicly. We stated three  years\r\n\r\nago  in the then situation that we were against  the\r\n\r\nEmergency Regulations. We opposed it after  we  were\r\n\r\nelected  in  1955 and in September and  October.  We\r\n\r\nwill  oppose  it  now because we  are  on  the  same\r\n\r\nmandate. But to those who would like to know what we\r\n\r\nwill  do  in a few months' time, as they have  every\r\n\r\nright to know, we say now that if we do not begin to\r\n\r\nface up to the future, then we perish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say this, that we in this Assembly must\r\n\r\nalways  expect  to have those who are denied  direct\r\n\r\nentry into the political arena, we must expect  them\r\n\r\nto  fight  by  proxy.  If it  were  not  David  Saul\r\n\r\nMarshall, it could be the Member for Queenstown (Mr\r\n\r\nLee  Choon  Eng), it could be anybody else.  I  hold\r\n\r\nnothing  against  them, but I  would  like  them  to\r\n\r\nremember  this: Fight your own battle for  your  own\r\n\r\nend, and I state the P.A.P. battle is for an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindependent, democratic, non-Communist Malaya.

At the same  time  we\r\n\r\nstate  quite  categorically  that  we  believe  in  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  system, that we will allow full competition\r\n\r\nwithin  the democratic system, but competition for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  destroying the democratic system  will  be\r\n\r\nresisted; and a Government or any group of persons  who\r\n\r\ncome  and  tell  the people that they  intend  to  curb\r\n\r\nthemselves in the name of democracy, human liberty  and\r\n\r\nfreedom,  would  be the first to flee for  their  lives\r\n\r\nwhen  they  find the policies which they have advocated\r\n\r\ncome  home to roost.

He\r\n\r\nhas  now  given us two very ingenious reasons  why  his\r\n\r\nParty  has  changed its policy towards the Preservation\r\n\r\nof  Public Security Ordinance.

The other reason he has  given\r\n\r\nus  is  that  his  Party must follow the  examples  set\r\n\r\nbefore  us  by  the  colonies which  have  just  gained\r\n\r\nindependence   and  which  all  have   such   emergency\r\n\r\nregulations.

Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar who has fulfilled my dream that one  day\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar must admit that he is\r\n\r\nof   the   right-wing  party  when  compared   to   the\r\n\r\nCommunists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not going into the merits or demerits of the\r\n\r\nPreservation  of  Public Security Ordinance.  Today  it\r\n\r\nseems  that  storytellers  are  very  popular  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  and I, therefore, would like to recollect  the\r\n\r\nstory of what happened three years ago: 27th September,\r\n\r\n1955.  The  hon. Member for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong)  shouted,  \"This  Bill is  a  colonial  Security\r\n\r\nBill\".  The hon. Member for Sembawang (Inche Ahmad  bin\r\n\r\nIbrahim)  said  that this Bill would  deter  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion movement. The hon. Member for Serangoon said,  \"I\r\n\r\nprefer the Emergency Regulations because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe length of time for its review is only  three\r\n\r\nmonths\".   Sir,  things  have  greatly   changed   now,\r\n\r\nespecially  the People's Action Party, and particularly\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar. He appears to us  as\r\n\r\na very responsible and an entirely changed man, changed\r\n\r\nto   such   an   extent  that  he  made   a   statement\r\n\r\ncontradictory  to  what  he had  said  before,  in  the\r\n\r\nHansard  Volume 1 No. 14 col. 726 in which he said  \"If\r\n\r\nit  is not totalitarian to arrest a man and detain  him\r\n\r\nwhen you cannot charge him with any offence against any\r\n\r\nwritten  law - if that is not what we have always  cried\r\n\r\nout  against  in Fascist States - then what  is  it?\"  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  the hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar  said\r\n\r\nthis P.P.S.O. is a Fascist law! Now he seems to realise\r\n\r\nhis  responsibility to the people and take it to  heart\r\n\r\nand, therefore, he has promised us to change his stand.\r\n\r\nBut  one  thing which he is not aware of is that  times\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  changed.  No  more 200 strikes - over  200  strikes\r\n\r\nduring  so  short  a period - no more picketeers  outside\r\n\r\nthis  House;  no  more  Emergency  appeals  now  except\r\n\r\ngangster  activities. The general  election  is  coming\r\n\r\nnearer and nearer. If the Government insist on amending\r\n\r\nthis  law by extending it for another year, I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthey  will mislead the people into believing that  this\r\n\r\nBill is really helping the People's Action Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar has confirmed\r\n\r\nthat  Mr Devan Nair is still his colleague and comrade\r\n\r\nand that the hon. Member for Bukit Timah is his comrade\r\n\r\ntoo,  why  do  the  Government  not  release  them   by\r\n\r\nwithdrawing this amending Bill? Let Mr Devan Nair  and\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Bukit Timah take part in  this  coming\r\n\r\ngeneral  election. This will serve to confirm  or  deny\r\n\r\nthe political gossip or rumour that there is really  an\r\n\r\nunderstanding between the Hon. the Chief  Minister  and\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar  to  arrest  all  his\r\n\r\nopponents in the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most important thing is the concept of\r\n\r\ndemocracy. I do not mind\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nusing  the  same words as have been used by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong Pagar. I quote from Hansard No. 14, Volume\r\n\r\n1, dated 21st September, 1955, col. 726:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If we are to survive as a free democracy, then we\r\n\r\nmust  be  prepared,  in principle,  to  concede  to  our\r\n\r\nenemies - even those who do not subscribe to our  views - as\r\n\r\nmuch  constitutional right as you concede  yourself,  My\r\n\r\nplea - to  quote  from someone in another context - is  that\r\n\r\nthe time has come in Malaya for an agonising reappraisal\r\n\r\nof  strategy and strength. To go on blindly in the  hope\r\n\r\nthat somehow or the other suppression can prevent latent\r\n\r\nsocial,   economic   and  political   discontents   from\r\n\r\nmanifesting  themselves and disrupting the structure  of\r\n\r\nsociety  is a piece of folly to which my Party does  not\r\n\r\nsubscribe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  it  is  very  clear. If we want a free  democratic\r\n\r\nelection and if we have confidence in ourselves that the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  system is much better than the  totalitarian\r\n\r\nsystem,  it seems therefore rather absurd to bar  people\r\n\r\nwho  do not believe this Bill is in their interests; but\r\n\r\nthey  merely say it is aimed to bar them from contesting\r\n\r\nthe elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the Emergency conditions in the Federation\r\n\r\nhave  greatly improved. Many black areas have now turned\r\n\r\ninto  white  areas  and  I think the  stability  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya is obvious. Therefore  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink it is wise for this House at this moment, in  view\r\n\r\nof  the approaching general election, to amend this Bill\r\n\r\nfrom  three to four years. It will indirectly prove that\r\n\r\nwe  are  cowards and that we have an inferiority complex\r\n\r\nin  that we do not dare to fight a system in which we do\r\n\r\nnot  believe. Therefore, Sir, I appeal to the Government\r\n\r\nto  consider  this point, it seems we cannot  fight  the\r\n\r\nKing  Kong therefore we put him into the jail, I do  not\r\n\r\nthink this is a bold and courageous government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.36 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nnext  year  a  new Assembly will be elected  and  a  new\r\n\r\ngovernment will be formed by the majority party  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.  The  new  government  will  operate  the  new\r\n\r\nconstitution.  What  should  be  the  attitude  of   the\r\n\r\ngovernment  towards the Preservation of Public  Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance?  My colleague, the Member for Tanjong  Pagar,\r\n\r\nhas  made  a general review of the stand which my  Party\r\n\r\nwill  take  should  it he returned at the  next  General\r\n\r\nElections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to elaborate on the subject in one of its\r\n\r\naspects. I want to discuss the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfuture    relationship   between   the    self-governing\r\n\r\ngovernment of the State of Singapore and the independent\r\n\r\nstate  of  the Federation of Malaya. It is obvious  that\r\n\r\nthe  matter  of  internal security is one  of  paramount\r\n\r\nimportance  in  the  ties  between  Singapore  and   the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems a safe enough starting point to assume that\r\n\r\nthe over-riding policy of any future government must  be\r\n\r\nto secure agreement with the Federation government for a\r\n\r\nmerger   of   the   two  territories.  Under   the   new\r\n\r\nconstitution  Singapore will enjoy only  internal  self-government.  For  full Merdeka we must  merge  with  the\r\n\r\nmainland. Only lunatics believe that Singapore can be an\r\n\r\nindependent state on its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that with the next step of our political\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  we  would have reached only  the  half-way\r\n\r\nhouse  to  full Merdeka, it is important that we  should\r\n\r\nthen  onwards press ahead and avoid doing anything  that\r\n\r\nwould  harm  us  in  the last stage of  our  journey  to\r\n\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be clear even to the meanest intellect that\r\n\r\nwe  must fall in line with the Federation Government  on\r\n\r\nmatters  of internal security. Let us examine  both  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional and political position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constitutional position is clear. The supreme\r\n\r\nauthority  in  matters  of  internal  security  is   the\r\n\r\nSecurity Council. On the Security Council will sit three\r\n\r\nSingapore representatives, three British representatives\r\n\r\nand one Federation representative. This means that where\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation are united, they  can  out-vote  the British; where they are disunited, the British\r\n\r\nwill have the deciding voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Security arrangement agreed to by the\r\n\r\nSingapore  All Party Mission. This is part  of  the  new\r\n\r\nconstitution. The All Party stand on this matter, and on\r\n\r\nall  matters  generally, has been put  to  the  test  of\r\n\r\npublic opinion in last year's Tanjong Pagar by-election.\r\n\r\nIt received overwhelming public support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore are pleased that the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment have agreed to appoint one representative  on\r\n\r\nthe   Security  Council.  This  is  surely   a   welcome\r\n\r\nrecognition that internal security\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  a  problem common to both territories,  as,\r\n\r\nindeed, all other important problems are common to both\r\n\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's political situation is not complicated.\r\n\r\nThis  was  not  so two or three years ago in  Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  democrats, pro-Communists, anti-Communists,  pro-colonialists   and  others  were  contending   in   the\r\n\r\npolitical  arena.  All pretended to be  democrats.  The\r\n\r\npicture  was  then confused. When four or  five  armies\r\n\r\njoin  in the fray, it is not always easy in the din  or\r\n\r\nbattle  and  in the melee of banners and  uniforms,  to\r\n\r\nfind  out  who represents what. But now, as we approach\r\n\r\nMerdeka,  the  issues are defining themselves  and  the\r\n\r\ngenuine   democrat   stands  out  from   the   imposter\r\n\r\nmasquerading in his uniform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Federation there is armed conflict between\r\n\r\nTunku   Abdul  Rahman's  government  and  the   Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist   Party.  Quite  naturally   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  is anxious that a self-governing  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  not  provide  a refuge and a  sanctuary  for  the\r\n\r\nM.C.P.'s  hard pressed battalions. It is possible  that\r\n\r\nthe   Federation   Government  have   exaggerated   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  our island being used as  a  refitting\r\n\r\ncentre  by the M.C.P. but the anxiety they felt  was  a\r\n\r\nreal  one and no doubt lay behind their willingness  to\r\n\r\nparticipate in Singapore's security affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as the Federation have the Emergency on their\r\n\r\nhands,  that  long will they insist that  no  Singapore\r\n\r\ngovernment  shall be permitted to give aid and  comfort\r\n\r\nto the Communists and their sympathisers. If an elected\r\n\r\nSingapore  government  were to attempt  otherwise,  two\r\n\r\nconsequences immediately follow. First, there will be a\r\n\r\nserious division of opinion within the Security Council\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore and the Federation. As  I  explained\r\n\r\nearlier,  any  disunity between the two will  give  the\r\n\r\nBritish representatives the deciding voice. No one need\r\n\r\ndoubt  as  to how the British will vote. The Federation\r\n\r\nview will prevail. The second consequence will be that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore may well have to forget about merger with the\r\n\r\nFederation, at least until it changes by free  election\r\n\r\nthe  government which has brought it into conflict with\r\n\r\nthe Federation's vital security interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody likes the provisions of the Preservation of\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Security Ordinance. But it is  foolish  to\r\n\r\nimagine  that a self-governing Singapore will  ever  be\r\n\r\nable  to  discard  the Preservation of Public  Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance and at the same time hope to merge  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation. You can do one or the other; you cannot  do\r\n\r\nboth. I am quite clear in my mind what I would do given\r\n\r\nthe   choice   in  a  self-governing  Singapore.   Good\r\n\r\ngovernment  does  not depend on the  absence  of  these\r\n\r\npowers.  It  depends  upon  their  proper  use   by   a\r\n\r\ngovernment answerable to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, however, the self-governing Singapore is yet\r\n\r\nto  be  and  for this reason and for other  reasons  as\r\n\r\nexplained  by  my  colleague, the  Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar, I shall cast my vote against the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.45 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, from the debate so far two things  have,\r\n\r\nto  my  mind,  emerged. Firstly, we see how politicians\r\n\r\nlack  understanding. They choose to  be  blind  to  the\r\n\r\nhappenings  or incidents that are occurring  around  us\r\n\r\nevery day and therefore they choose to say things  they\r\n\r\ndo not really mean with an eye to the future elections.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the P.A.P are, I think, not courageous enough\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto say that their conscience and the facts and evidence\r\n\r\nin  their possession warrant their full support of  the\r\n\r\npresent  Bill  before  the  House.  But  through  their\r\n\r\nSecretary-General, the P.A.P. choose to put  the  blame\r\n\r\non  the  existence  of  the  Emergency  powers  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  They  choose  to  put  the  blame  on  the\r\n\r\nCommunist    terrorists   fighting    the    Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  be., cause of the existence  of  that\r\n\r\nterrorism  in  the  Federation  of  Malaya,   we   must\r\n\r\ntherefore, with a view to a future merger, support this\r\n\r\nBill.  I  would  be  happier if the P.A.P. would  come\r\n\r\nbefore us and say\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat,  because  of the existence of the  Communists  and\r\n\r\ntheir    elements   who   are   trying   to    overthrow\r\n\r\nconstitutional  government, such a law is  necessary  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  without reference to the future merger  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation or because of the existence of a certain\r\n\r\nsituation in the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.47 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  my  Party's  attitude towards the Preservation  of\r\n\r\nPublic  Security  Ordinance has always depended  on  the\r\n\r\nanswers to two questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question is: To whom are these extraordinary\r\n\r\npowers  being  given? The second is: To  what  use  will\r\n\r\nthese powers be put?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two questions, in fact, are interrelated. We can\r\n\r\ntell from the nature of the persons to whom these powers\r\n\r\nare given, how they will use these extraordinary powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Sir, a government of Fascists will use\r\n\r\nthe   Preservation  of  Public  Security  Ordinance   to\r\n\r\nstrengthen and safeguard their way of life. And in  pre-war  Germany and pre-war Italy, Fascist governments  had\r\n\r\nspecial powers and used them to strengthen their kind of\r\n\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Communist governments will use these\r\n\r\nextraordinary  powers  to protect  and  consolidate  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  state.  In Russia, China and  other  People's\r\n\r\nDemocracies,  governments  have  arbitrary   powers   of\r\n\r\narrest, detention and even of execution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no doubt that if we had a government of\r\n\r\nsecret  society  gangsters or their underlings,  such  a\r\n\r\ngovernment would use the Preservation of Public Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance to make Singapore safe for gangsterism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party has, in the past, attacked the Preservation\r\n\r\nof   Public   Security  Ordinance,  or   the   Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations as it used to be called, because we know  to\r\n\r\nwhom  these powers were being given and to what use they\r\n\r\nwould be put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emergency Regulations, as you know, Sir, were\r\n\r\nfirst promulgated by a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncolonial regime. It is true that the supporters of  this\r\n\r\nregime  claimed that the Emergency Regulations would  be\r\n\r\nused  to  preserve  democracy  against  armed  Communist\r\n\r\nrevolt and subversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it may be that the colonial forces genuinely\r\n\r\nbelieved that the interests of colonialism and democracy\r\n\r\nwere identical. They were only a little less virulent in\r\n\r\ntheir  attacks  on the anti-colonial parties  than  they\r\n\r\nwere in their attacks on the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as a colonial regime and its journalistic\r\n\r\ntools  were unable to distinguish between democracy  and\r\n\r\nnationalism, it would have been folly to have agreed  to\r\n\r\nextraordinary powers to such a regime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, the times have changed. Next year Singapore\r\n\r\nis  to  have internal self-government. This is not  full\r\n\r\nindependence  or  Merdeka.  But  this  is  not  due   to\r\n\r\nobstruction  on the part of the British or to  restraint\r\n\r\non the part of Singapore's political parties. Singapore,\r\n\r\nby  itself, cannot be an independent state, though there\r\n\r\nare  bankrupt  and  desperate politicians  who  hope  to\r\n\r\nrevive  their political fortunes by pretending  that  it\r\n\r\ncan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independence for Singapore depends on it becoming a\r\n\r\npart of the Federation. My Party's attitude towards  the\r\n\r\nPreservation  of  Public Security  Ordinance  is  partly\r\n\r\ndetermined by this aspiration. As long as an independent\r\n\r\nFederation  is  at war with the M.C.P., a self-governing\r\n\r\nSingapore  cannot  act as though an emergency  situation\r\n\r\ndoes not exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a case of defending democracy only in the\r\n\r\nFederation.  It  must be safeguarded in  Singapore  too.\r\n\r\nOnce  Singapore becomes a self-governing democracy, that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndemocracy  must be defended by extraordinary powers,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary.  In  fact,  we  think,  Sir,  that   in   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  now existing in Malaya  such  powers  are\r\n\r\nnecessary.  But  they  should  be  in  the  hands  of  a\r\n\r\ndemocratically    elected    government - a     government\r\n\r\nanswerable to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it will be hard for a small territory like\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  escape subversion once it  becomes  self-governing. And by subversion we mean activity by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany  group to destroy the democratic system. And  we  do\r\n\r\nnot care whether such subversion comes from the right or\r\n\r\nfrom  the Communists. Any attempt by any group  to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore  subservient to any country other than  itself\r\n\r\nor  the  Federation  must be resisted  by  extraordinary\r\n\r\npowers  if  need  be. There is only  one  way  of  over-throwing a government in a democracy, and that is by its\r\n\r\ncitizens voting it out of power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. therefore agree that extraordinary powers are\r\n\r\nnecessary  to preserve democracy, provided they  are  in\r\n\r\nthe hands of a government freely elected by the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The Chief Minister said\r\n\r\nthat  on that day he was one of the Members who  sat  on\r\n\r\nthe Labour Front Four-Year Programme and that it was  he\r\n\r\nwho   was   most  insistent  in  wanting  the  Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations  repealed because it was felt, at  the  time\r\n\r\nwhen   they  were  considering  the  question   of   the\r\n\r\nPreservation of Public Security Bill, that the situation\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  did  not warrant a continuance  of  these\r\n\r\nunnecessary and repressive laws.

More than three years  have\r\n\r\npassed since he made that speech, and I personally feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  present  situation  does  not  justify   the\r\n\r\nextension of the Ordinance for another year. The Labour\r\n\r\nFront  want this extension. For what? For a display  of\r\n\r\ntheir  powers, that they can arrest people and imprison\r\n\r\nor  detain  them  without trial. Sir, I still  remember\r\n\r\ndistinctly that the Chief Minister himself went to  the\r\n\r\nOutram  Road  Prison  and  released  the  students  and\r\n\r\nworkers.  I  refer to the New Year and Hari  Raya  Puasa\r\n\r\nwhen the detainees were released. They were allowed  to\r\n\r\nhave  three  days' freedom to visit their families.  If\r\n\r\nthey  are  dangerous  people  charged  with  subversive\r\n\r\nactivities, I cannot understand why we must grant  them\r\n\r\nthis  short spell of freedom. To allow them three days'\r\n\r\nfreedom  simply  shows that these  people  are  not  as\r\n\r\ndangerous  as  the Government picture  them.  They  are\r\n\r\nbeing imprisoned at the whims and fancies of the Labour\r\n\r\nFront Coalition Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also refer to the detention of the Principal of\r\n\r\nChung  Cheng School. What crime has he committed? There\r\n\r\nare  so  many others who were detained. Sir,  if  these\r\n\r\npeople  were to be punished or deported, it  should  be\r\n\r\ndone  by due process of law and in accordance with  the\r\n\r\nprinciples of fairness and justice, and they should not\r\n\r\nbe  detained  and  then released  at  the  pleasure  of\r\n\r\nGovernment. If they are really Communists, detain them.\r\n\r\nWhy  allow  them this freedom of three  days  to  visit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir families? If they are really bad people, in three\r\n\r\nhours they can do a lot of damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel, Sir, that these arbitrary powers\r\n\r\nof  arrest  and detention without trial of  people  who\r\n\r\nhave  the courage to criticise the Government bring  to\r\n\r\nmind  the  methods used in the Communist  countries  to\r\n\r\neliminate their enemies. The children and dependants of\r\n\r\nthese  poor  people who have been detained, through  no\r\n\r\nfault of their own, have suffered intolerable hardship,\r\n\r\nanxieties  and cruelties. Have the Government  pondered\r\n\r\nfor  one little moment what anxieties they have  caused\r\n\r\nthem? I feel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  this Bill, or this weapon of arbitrary powers  of\r\n\r\narrest and detention without trial, in the hands of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is,  if misused, against the  principle  of\r\n\r\nfreedom-freedom  of speech, freedom of association  and\r\n\r\nexpression - because   this   Bill   seeks   to   curtail\r\n\r\nindividual  freedom.  To give this  power  again  to  a\r\n\r\ntottering Government is one action in which I will have\r\n\r\nno part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to London to talk about Merdeka. We want to\r\n\r\nbe free from the shackles of colonialism and we want to\r\n\r\nhave a free and democratic way of life. Is this another\r\n\r\nthing to be introduced here? I can assure you that I am\r\n\r\ndead  against the Communists and against the action  of\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister  in  giving  them  a  three  days'\r\n\r\nholiday. But to treat innocent people like that and  go\r\n\r\nto the prison to show them to the parents is to display\r\n\r\nhis  own powers. I will object to that, because I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  these  people  have been arrested  on  trumped-up\r\n\r\ncharges   and  have  been  imprisoned  without   trial.\r\n\r\nProbably  they  have been tortured, as the  Member  for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQueenstown has said, or beaten up. This sort  of  thing\r\n\r\nreally reminds me of the methods of the Communists. All\r\n\r\nmen  are  created equal and by this Bill the Government\r\n\r\nis  using  the  power  to eliminate  their  enemies.  I\r\n\r\ntherefore oppose the extension of this Bill for another\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Unless any other hon.

We\r\n\r\nfind Members who belonged to a Party resigning and\r\n\r\nwalking over to the other side, the Opposition\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBenches.  We  find  Members  of  one  political   Party\r\n\r\nspeaking  at variance with the policy of the Party.  We\r\n\r\nalso  find Members of one Party who are proud to  claim\r\n\r\nthat  they  are left, and anyone who is more left  than\r\n\r\nthey must be either Communists or mad democrats. It now\r\n\r\nbehooves me to reply to all the charges which have been\r\n\r\nmade  by irresponsible people who put up a pretence  of\r\n\r\nbeing  responsible, and by responsible people who  have\r\n\r\nnow become irresponsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I think I should reply to the charges\r\n\r\nof  the  last speaker, the hon. Member for Tiong Bahru.\r\n\r\nHe says that the Government use its arbitrary powers to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narrest  its  political opponents. Yet  I  think  in  my\r\n\r\nopening speech I gave an account of the arrests and  of\r\n\r\nthe  connections  the detainees had with  the  People's\r\n\r\nAction Party. The Party that was most concerned did not\r\n\r\nstand  up  and say that the arrests and the  detentions\r\n\r\nwere wrong. Yet out of the mouth of the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nTiong  Bahru he now says that the Government  has  done\r\n\r\nthis  thing  in  order to silence political  opponents.\r\n\r\nSurely  he  must  have realised by  now  that  if  this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment had not been firm, if my colleagues had  not\r\n\r\ndared to sacrifice their own security and run the  risk\r\n\r\nof  being assassinated, he would not have been able  to\r\n\r\nsit  here and enjoy the freedom that we are at  present\r\n\r\nenjoying because of the actions of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he asks, \"Why did I allow these detainees to go\r\n\r\nhome  and  visit their parents, their wives  and  their\r\n\r\nchildren?\"  Surely, Sir, I am very human, if  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  is not. When the families came to see me,  when\r\n\r\nthey  cried. I really cried with them. When  they  were\r\n\r\nsorrowful,  I  too was sorrowful. When they  said  that\r\n\r\ntheir husbands were taken away, I looked at my wife and\r\n\r\nthought, \"If her husband were taken away, how would she\r\n\r\nfeel?\" When they said that the children were denied the\r\n\r\nloving  care of their fathers who were detained by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, I looked at my children and said, \"Although\r\n\r\nyour  father is not detained, yet you do not  see  your\r\n\r\nfather\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  of the work that he has to do for the public.\"\r\n\r\nYet  because  I  showed  some  human  understanding  by\r\n\r\nallowing  detainees to rejoin their parents  for  three\r\n\r\ndays  during  Chinese New Year - that is the custom - I  am\r\n\r\nnow  accused  by  the hon. Member for  Tiong  Bahru  of\r\n\r\nplaying with politics, playing with the freedom of  the\r\n\r\npeople who have been detained, and he charged that they\r\n\r\nwere my political opponents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever the Government does - if we detain them,\r\n\r\nwe  are  accused  of  taking action  against  political\r\n\r\nopponents;  if we release them even for a few  days  to\r\n\r\nrejoin  their families, we are accused of  running  the\r\n\r\nrisk  of allowing these subversive elements to go back\r\n\r\ninto  circulation  and  contaminating  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we come to the three members of the People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party. The fourth member who is still in Changi\r\n\r\nPrison  has  not been named by them. It is indeed  most\r\n\r\nsignificant; whereas the Independent Members named them\r\n\r\nas their honourable comrade and colleague. Indeed it is\r\n\r\nvery wonderful, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have the members of the People's Action Party\r\n\r\nbeen  saying? This law is all right, if we operate  it.\r\n\r\nThis  law is not all right, because the other  side  is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noperating it. We will support any such law because  the\r\n\r\nsituation  in the Federation demands it, but we  cannot\r\n\r\nsupport  it  now  because it is still  a  semi-colonial\r\n\r\nadministration that is running it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It is just saying to their\r\n\r\ncomrades, \"My comrades, today I must resist, because  I\r\n\r\nhave  an  excuse to resist the three colonial officials\r\n\r\nhere;   but  tomorrow  we  want  to  merge   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation, so I therefore cannot resist. So  you  must\r\n\r\nplease understand my reasons. Let us still continue  to\r\n\r\nbe  friends.\" That is not the way to carry on.

All I said was that out of so many people arrested,\r\n\r\nthere  were so many connected with the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty.  There were so many confessions from people  who\r\n\r\nsaid  that they were instructed to penetrate  into  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and use it for Communist ends. What do I want to\r\n\r\nclaim  credit for, from the Party that is on the  other\r\n\r\nside?  I claim no credit for it, nor do I claim  credit\r\n\r\nfrom  the people of Singapore for having done my  duty.\r\n\r\nIt  is my duty and I will do it irrespective of whether\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe hon. Members of the P.A.P. say whether we did right\r\n\r\nor  we did wrong. They claim that we played an election\r\n\r\ntrick  on  the  public, and the hon.

But when we got into power  and  found\r\n\r\nthat  the situation was so bad as to demand the  remedy\r\n\r\nof preventive detention, we were not afraid; we are not\r\n\r\nmoral cowards; we went straight ahead and did our duty.\r\n\r\nWe  did it and we are proud that we have done it. It is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause of what we have done that Singapore is what  it\r\n\r\nis today. The hon. Members of the P.A.P. would not have\r\n\r\nbeen here to crow about their success if action had not\r\n\r\nbeen taken against those that sought to choke them  and\r\n\r\nto capture the P.A.P. for their own ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now they accuse me again of why I released Dr\r\n\r\nChuang  Chu Lin, why Linda Chen was released;  why  Mr\r\n\r\nLim Kean Chye was allowed to come back and yet detained\r\n\r\nby  the  police. I must be an evil man  for  doing  all\r\n\r\nthis, thoroughly evil, so I must be the target not only\r\n\r\nof  the  Communists but also a target of the  so-called\r\n\r\nfreedom-loving  democrats that are now  in  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nSir,  when  the  ship  was  ready  to  take  away   the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbanishees, we went through every banishee's case to see\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not we could show leniency and whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  the security of Singapore would be jeopardised  by\r\n\r\nthe  release of any banishees, because we are human and\r\n\r\nwe  can  appreciate  and understand the  sufferings  of\r\n\r\nthese people. We are now accused of having released Dr\r\n\r\nChuang  whose  release  we now  believe  is  no  longer\r\n\r\nprejudicial to the security of Singapore. The same case\r\n\r\napplied to Linda Chen. As regards Lim Kean Chye,  I  am\r\n\r\nindeed surprised, Sir, that this should have come  from\r\n\r\na very learned member of the Bar. Under the Immigration\r\n\r\nOrdinance, any British subject born in Malaya cannot be\r\n\r\ndenied entry and to that extent Mr Lim Kean Chye could\r\n\r\nnot  be  denied entry, not that he was given  an  entry\r\n\r\npermit  to  enter Singapore. But his sponsor  had  been\r\n\r\nadvised  by me unofficially that because Lim Kean  Chye\r\n\r\nescaped at the time when a warrant of arrest was issued\r\n\r\nagainst  him, there was every possibility  that  if  he\r\n\r\ncame  back to Singapore, he would be detained.  I  told\r\n\r\nthat  to  the  sponsor. And yet  the  hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar would like to twist it round  and  round\r\n\r\nand  say,  how steady the P.A.P. are and how weak-kneed\r\n\r\nthe  Labour Front is. He says that by doing  all  these\r\n\r\nthings   the  Labour  Front  is  committing   political\r\n\r\nsuicide. Sir, to him the Party stands first. To me  and\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues  the country stands  first,  be  it  the\r\n\r\nsuicide of the Labour Front or not. The security of the\r\n\r\ncountry,  including the security of those that  sit  on\r\n\r\nthe other side, comes first in our work. If we have  to\r\n\r\ndo  drastic and unpopular things in order to look after\r\n\r\nthe  security of the citizens of Singapore, we will  do\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon.

B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like the Bill which was debated this morning by\r\n\r\nthe  House, the object of the present amending Bill  is\r\n\r\nto  extend  the  life  of the parent  Ordinance  for  a\r\n\r\nfurther 12 months with the intention that it should  be\r\n\r\nreviewed  at  the  end of that period by  the  incoming\r\n\r\nGovernment.  When the parent Ordinance was  enacted  in\r\n\r\n1955,  it  consisted of six Parts  and  in  moving  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading my predecessor expressed the hope  that\r\n\r\nat  the  end  of  three years its provisions  would  no\r\n\r\nlonger be required. In the view of the Government, this\r\n\r\nhope  has  not  been  realised and  there  is  still  a\r\n\r\ncontinuing  need  for  the  powers  conferred  by  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance, both to counter subversive activities  which\r\n\r\nstill  constitute a threat to Singapore,  and  also  to\r\n\r\ncounter the potential threat of violence which is still\r\n\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not necessary for me, Sir, to enlarge upon the\r\n\r\nsubversive  threat  which was fully ventilated  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate this morning, but the House will wish me to give\r\n\r\nsome  account of the way in which the powers  conferred\r\n\r\nby  Part  VII which was enacted as recently  as  August\r\n\r\nthis  year  have been exercised. The House will  recall\r\n\r\nthat,  as  a  result of the initial sweep made  by  the\r\n\r\nPolice  against  the leaders of active  secret  society\r\n\r\ngangs  in  the middle of August, at the time when  Part\r\n\r\nVII of the Ordinance was enacted, 73 persons were taken\r\n\r\ninto   custody.  Of  these  73,  31  were  subsequently\r\n\r\nreleased  and orders of detention were made  by  me  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  42.  Since then, partly  as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nfurther information which has become available  to  the\r\n\r\nPolice,  orders have been made by me in  a  further  18\r\n\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Advisory Committees provided for in section 51 of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance have been constituted and I should  like\r\n\r\nto  express  my gratitude to the members of the  public\r\n\r\nwho  have  accepted duty on these Committees. Two  such\r\n\r\nCommittees  have  been  appointed  to  deal  with   the\r\n\r\nsubstantial  number of cases to be  reviewed  and  each\r\n\r\nCommittee  is constituted with a Chairman, an alternate\r\n\r\nChairman and a panel of members, with a provision  that\r\n\r\nthe  Committee shall normally sit with the Chairman and\r\n\r\ntwo  members  but  that the proceedings  shall  not  be\r\n\r\ninvalidated  by the absence of one of the two  members.\r\n\r\nThese provisions were incorporated in the Criminal  Law\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Committee  Rules  which  were  made  on  30th\r\n\r\nSeptember  and  it  is hoped by these  means  that  the\r\n\r\nreview  of  all the outstanding cases will be completed\r\n\r\nas  soon as possible. The Committees are now sitting to\r\n\r\nconsider  the  references made  to  them  by  me  under\r\n\r\nsection 48 of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was not to be expected that the powers\r\n\r\nprovided  by this Part of the Ordinance and the  action\r\n\r\ntaken  to  exercise  them would lead  to  an  immediate\r\n\r\ncessation  of all secret society and gangster activity,\r\n\r\nnor  indeed  has  this proved to be the  case.  It  did\r\n\r\ninitially  lead to a substantial drop in the  scale  of\r\n\r\nsecret  society activity and more particularly  in  the\r\n\r\nseriousness  of  the  incidents so classified.  In  the\r\n\r\nmonth  of  September,  there  were  in  fact  26   such\r\n\r\nincidents  but  all these were in the nature  of  minor\r\n\r\naffrays  arising from spontaneous quarrels rather  than\r\n\r\nthe   large-scale   planned  gang  fights   which   had\r\n\r\npreviously  represented such a  threat  to  law-abiding\r\n\r\nmembers of the public. There was however one murder  in\r\n\r\nSeptember and, as the House will be aware, two  further\r\n\r\nmurders of a similar kind have taken place in the  last\r\n\r\nfew  days.  Both these murders were of a similar  type,\r\n\r\ndeliberate and vicious attacks and part of the  warfare\r\n\r\nbetween the two main groups of secret societies. In the\r\n\r\nmurder  at  the Great World on Monday night,  there  is\r\n\r\nreason  to believe that the gangsters responsible  came\r\n\r\nfrom a different area, since a number of those in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Great  World area are on the Police 'Wanted'  list\r\n\r\nand  have gone into hiding. It would be idle to pretend\r\n\r\nthat  the  powers conferred by this Ordinance  will  in\r\n\r\nthemselves prevent further crimes of this kind  but  it\r\n\r\nmay  prove  necessary  to use  them  more  widely  than\r\n\r\nhitherto. Up to now, in accordance with the undertaking\r\n\r\nwhich  I  gave to the House in introducing the Bill  in\r\n\r\nAugust,  these  powers have been used very  selectively\r\n\r\nand  only  against those in respect of whom  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  abundant  evidence to show that they  are  either\r\n\r\nheadmen  of the particular society operating  in  their\r\n\r\narea  or  leading  fighters  who  have  been  the  most\r\n\r\nprominent both in committing extortion and in promoting\r\n\r\nthe  clashes  between one society and  another.  I  can\r\n\r\nassure   the  House  that  I  have  examined  all   the\r\n\r\napplications put up to me for orders under  section  47\r\n\r\nof  the Ordinance with the greatest care, and in  every\r\n\r\ncase  where I have made an order - always of course  with\r\n\r\nthe  concurrence of the Attorney-General - there has been\r\n\r\nample  evidence to show the leading part played by  the\r\n\r\ndetainees in these gangster activities. In most  cases,\r\n\r\nSir, the detainees themselves have admitted having been\r\n\r\nsecret  society fighters though they have at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime claimed that they have ceased their secret society\r\n\r\nactivity some time previously. In all cases, there  has\r\n\r\nbeen   evidence   from  members  of   the   public   to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate  the  case against them  and  the  current\r\n\r\nactivities  of  extortion and violence for  which  they\r\n\r\nhave been responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Sir, it must be recognised that this\r\n\r\nmeasure, which has the effect of removing some  of  the\r\n\r\nleaders  of  these  gangs  out  of  circulation  for  a\r\n\r\ntemporary  period  of time, can in  itself  be  only  a\r\n\r\npalliative, and what I regard as the most important aim\r\n\r\nand  object  of these measures is to give  a  breathing\r\n\r\nspace  to allow time to build up among members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  confidence in order that they can become  freed\r\n\r\nfrom  the terrorism and intimidation to which they have\r\n\r\nbecome  accustomed, so that they will be ready to  give\r\n\r\nthe necessary co-operation to the Police which will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nultimately  once again enable this type of  lawlessness\r\n\r\nto  be  controlled by the normal judicial processes  of\r\n\r\nlaw.   There  are  two  stages  in  building  up   this\r\n\r\nconfidence.  The  first  is to induce  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic to give voluntarily to the Police information in\r\n\r\ntheir   possession  regarding  the  identity  and   the\r\n\r\nactivities of these thugs and gangsters who  have  been\r\n\r\nintimidating  them.  The  second  stage  is  to  induce\r\n\r\nmembers   of   the  public  who  have  such  first-hand\r\n\r\ninformation to be ready to come forward and testify  in\r\n\r\nCourt  when  those  responsible  are  arranged  on  the\r\n\r\nappropriate charges. We cannot expect to achieve  those\r\n\r\ntwo  stages in a very short time but there are at least\r\n\r\nsome  signs  that progress is being made in  the  first\r\n\r\nstage. More information is being given to the Police by\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public, particularly in  relation  to\r\n\r\nsecret stores of weapons and matters of that kind which\r\n\r\nassist  the  preventive side of the Police war  against\r\n\r\nthese gangs, and there have been more indications  that\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the public are ready to come  forward  and\r\n\r\ngive  the  Police,  albeit  in confidence,  information\r\n\r\nregarding  the identity of the individuals responsible.\r\n\r\nI  must  however  emphasise  that  in  this  matter  we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  have  a  very long  way  to  go.  In,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  the  case of the first of  the  two  murders\r\n\r\nthree  days  ago I have referred to, there  can  be  no\r\n\r\ndoubt that that vicious and brutal attack took place in\r\n\r\nthe  hearing  if  not in sight of quite a  considerable\r\n\r\nnumber of persons in that area, but no one attempted to\r\n\r\ngive any information to the Police and it was not until\r\n\r\nthe  Police themselves were rung up by the Fire Brigade\r\n\r\nwho  had  been  called upon to provide an ambulance  to\r\n\r\nremove the victim that they received any information of\r\n\r\nthe  crime. On the other side of the picture, one  very\r\n\r\nencouraging instance did occur recently when a group of\r\n\r\nten  shopkeepers  from a certain area  arrived  at  the\r\n\r\nC.I.D. in  a  body to inform the Police officer  there\r\n\r\nthat  they  were  prepared to give the  names  of  nine\r\n\r\npersons responsible for extorting money from themselves\r\n\r\nand  the  hawkers in their area. On the  basis  of  the\r\n\r\ninformation they were prepared to give, it was possible\r\n\r\nto  take  action to detain four members of the gang - the\r\n\r\nheadman, the assistant headman and two of the leading\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfighters, who were so identified, and there has in fact\r\n\r\nbeen  no  further secret society activity in that  area\r\n\r\nsince.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, Sir, in moving the Second Reading of the\r\n\r\namending  Bill in August that I hoped the  exercise  of\r\n\r\nthese powers would act as a catalytic agent in inducing\r\n\r\nthe  public  to free themselves from the  terrorism  to\r\n\r\nwhich  they  had been subjected and to give  increasing\r\n\r\ncooperation to the Police to enable the latter to carry\r\n\r\nout their task. I sincerely hope that this process will\r\n\r\ncontinue and will be accelerated and that once  members\r\n\r\nof  the public realise that the remedy lies largely  in\r\n\r\ntheir  own  hands  and  that  provided  they  are   all\r\n\r\ncollectively prepared to give the necessary assistance,\r\n\r\nthe    risk   they   run   of   subsequent   individual\r\n\r\nvictimisation from other members of the gang  still  at\r\n\r\nlarge is substantially reduced; and in the long run,  I\r\n\r\nhope that they will be ultimately ready to come forward\r\n\r\nnot  only with information to the Police but also  with\r\n\r\ninformation which they are prepared to repeat  in  open\r\n\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is one last aspect of the matter to\r\n\r\nwhich  I  would like to refer. In moving  the  amending\r\n\r\nBill  in  August,  I did mention that  one  distressing\r\n\r\naspect of the current situation was the extent to which\r\n\r\nyoung  boys at school had become associated with  these\r\n\r\nactivities.  In examining the case records  which  have\r\n\r\nbeen put up to me for orders under this Ordinance, in a\r\n\r\nlarge number of cases I have found that the individuals\r\n\r\nconcerned  have  in  fact been  associated  with  these\r\n\r\nactivities  from  a  very young  age - in  some  cases\r\n\r\nperhaps  14  and  15 years old - and I  would  urge  that\r\n\r\nparents  and  school masters should do everything  they\r\n\r\ncan  to  discourage  boys in their  charge  from  being\r\n\r\ncaught up in these activities. At the present time,  we\r\n\r\nhave arranged for a number of senior Police officers to\r\n\r\ngo  round and give talks in the schools with the object\r\n\r\nof  trying  to  discourage this type of affiliation  by\r\n\r\nyoung boys with the secret societies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is against this background and to provide the\r\n\r\nnecessary breathing space to which I have referred that\r\n\r\nI ask the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse to give this Bill a Second Reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have just a few\r\n\r\nwords  to say. The long and dismal account of the state\r\n\r\nof  affairs which the Chief Secretary has just narrated\r\n\r\nmust be one which must lie heavily on the conscience of\r\n\r\nevery person responsible for the future good government\r\n\r\nand happiness of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is very little to be said on the Bill itself. We\r\n\r\ncan give ourselves more and more powers but we have got\r\n\r\nsomehow  to  break through this ring. It is  a  vicious\r\n\r\ncircle.  The people are scared because they cannot  get\r\n\r\nprotection. Because they are scared and do not give the\r\n\r\ninformation, nothing can be done and the terror mounts.\r\n\r\nI  do not think the use of counter-terror is the answer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  this sort of situation, but I do believe that it is\r\n\r\nnot  possible  for  the Police to be  ignorant  of  the\r\n\r\nringleaders  of the secret societies. In  fact,  in  my\r\n\r\ncontacts  with the Police in the Courts, it has  always\r\n\r\nbeen  my  impression that they knew very well who  were\r\n\r\nthe men behind it all, but that they were unable to get\r\n\r\ntheir  hands on them. I hope by the time they pass  the\r\n\r\nspecial provisions contained in section 47, the  moving\r\n\r\nspirits  could be successfully curbed. I do  not  know,\r\n\r\nSir,  whether  in  fact  we  were  over-optimistic   in\r\n\r\nbelieving that the Police are all that omniscient,  but\r\n\r\nI  emphatically state that I refuse to believe that the\r\n\r\nSecret  Society Sub-branch of the Police  can  be  that\r\n\r\nignorant of what goes on. There are men there who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  in and out of this \"twilight world\" which, so  to\r\n\r\nspeak, adjoins the public and the underworld so that it\r\n\r\nis  not possible for them not to know who are the  men.\r\n\r\nIf  these  powers  have to be used a  little  bit  more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwidely   than - as  the  Chief  Secretary   said - at   the\r\n\r\nbeginning, then I am quite sure there is nobody in this\r\n\r\nHouse  who is going to oppose it. But what we have  got\r\n\r\nto  do  is  to  stop this reign of terror where  people\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  it is more profitable to  stand  by  and\r\n\r\nwatch murder being done, than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  inform  the  Police  because in  that  alternative,\r\n\r\nsomething worse may happen to the informers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite frankly now, it is not a question of the\r\n\r\nLegislature, because we can give no wider  powers  than\r\n\r\nwhat  we have given, and it is up to the administrators\r\n\r\nand  the  policemen - in this case,  the  secret  society\r\n\r\nexperts - to use them effectively.

Regarding   these\r\n\r\nincidents, Sir, I want to bring to the attention of the\r\n\r\nHouse  the bold and daring nature of these gang fights.\r\n\r\nSir, on the same day, it was reported:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"An eyewitness told the Straits Times: 'I saw a blood-spattered man climb over the three-foot high enclosure\r\n\r\nwith his assailants at his heels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man collapsed in the middle of the rink.

First, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Welfare should provide more  employment.\r\n\r\nSecond,  there should be more 'vocational' schools  for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover-aged children - especially for those whose ages are\r\n\r\nbetween 14 to 16 - who failed their examinations and were\r\n\r\nrequired to leave school. Third, we should try to  find\r\n\r\nsome  isolated island and turn it into a rehabilitation\r\n\r\ncentre or even into a so-called forced labour camp.  We\r\n\r\nhave  to do something. We must try to convert and train\r\n\r\nthese  active  members of secret  societies  to  become\r\n\r\nuseful  citizens.  Fourth, in a city  of  the  size  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  Police should create  another  Special\r\n\r\nBranch  called  the  Youth Branch  to  deal  only  with\r\n\r\njuvenile  delinquents with the cooperation of the  many\r\n\r\ncivic  organisations in Singapore. In other words,  the\r\n\r\nPolice should think of every preventive measure to  put\r\n\r\na  stop  to those juvenile delinquents from joining  up\r\n\r\nwith  the  wrong  crowd and getting  themselves  deeply\r\n\r\ninvolved in gangster activities.

Practical difficulties have arisen in determining\r\n\r\nthe   tax  deductible  from  dividends  paid  by   such\r\n\r\ncompanies and the proposed amendment in clause 6 of the\r\n\r\nBill  is designed to allow the deduction of tax at  the\r\n\r\nrate of 30 per cent only.

The\r\n\r\nprincipal  object of this amendment is to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  Comptroller  is  given sufficient  notice  of  the\r\n\r\ndeparture   of   employees  from  the   Colony   either\r\n\r\npermanently  or  for a lengthy period,  in  order  that\r\n\r\nsteps  may  be taken before their departure to  compute\r\n\r\nand collect the tax payable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been represented that sections 84 and 93 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  are difficult to construe and to  reconcile.\r\n\r\nIt  is  proposed  to amend in clause  9  of  the  Bill,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsection 84, by clarifying the circumstances in which an\r\n\r\nassessment  becomes  final  and  conclusive,   and   by\r\n\r\nprecluding  the  revision of any final  and  conclusive\r\n\r\nassessment under the provisions of section  93  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  The amendment in clause 10 of the  Bill  is\r\n\r\ndesigned  to amend section 93 by making it  merely  the\r\n\r\nauthority for the Comptroller to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrepay  tax  when  the  greater amount  has  been  paid\r\n\r\ndirectly  or by deduction than is charged in  a  final\r\n\r\nand  conclusive assessment or when an exempt  taxpayer\r\n\r\nhas suffered by deduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed in clause 11 of the Bill to provide\r\n\r\nthat taxpayers may claim relief at any time within six\r\n\r\nyears of the end of the relative year of assessment in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  an error or mistake made in a  return  of\r\n\r\nstatement   for   the  purposes  of   assessment.   To\r\n\r\ndiscourage  frivolous appeals, where  the  Comptroller\r\n\r\nrefuses  to  admit  a  claim  to  relief,  the  clause\r\n\r\nrequires  the  sum  of $250 to be deposited  with  the\r\n\r\nClerk  to the Board of Review before an appeal can  be\r\n\r\nentertained, but provides for the refund of the  whole\r\n\r\nsum  in  the event of the appeal being allowed by  the\r\n\r\nBoard.  Where an appeal is unsuccessful, the Board  is\r\n\r\ngiven discretionary powers to decide whether the whole\r\n\r\nor any part should be refunded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of other minor amendments most of\r\n\r\nwhich are included in the Schedule to the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.17 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, out of the improvements\r\n\r\nmade in the Income Tax Ordinance with the introduction\r\n\r\nof  this Bill, I would like to refer in particular  to\r\n\r\nclause 2 (d), a matter on which I asked questions last\r\n\r\nyear,  and  there  is  now an  exemption  of  tax  for\r\n\r\nvisitors  entering this country for a  period  of  two\r\n\r\nmonths, and I think, as I stated a year ago, that that\r\n\r\nwas an extremely, restrictive clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome further the amendment to place motion\r\n\r\npicture  artists in this category as opposed to  stage\r\n\r\nand  radio artists, musicians, athletes, and so on.  I\r\n\r\nthink  that this is an important point, be, cause  the\r\n\r\npoint has been made, and notice has been taken by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, that motion picture artists who come  into\r\n\r\nthis   country  to  make  pictures  are   not   public\r\n\r\nentertainers in this country in the ordinary sense  of\r\n\r\nthe  'word,  in  that  they come  here  only  to  make\r\n\r\npictures.

I  know  of  an\r\n\r\nAmerican  company  wishing to spend something  between\r\n\r\nthree  and four million dollars in this country making\r\n\r\na  picture next year which would not only be a welcome\r\n\r\nrevenue to Singapore and the Federation but also would\r\n\r\nmean that our country and the Federation will go on to\r\n\r\nthe  world's screens in the way that Japan is  put  on\r\n\r\nthe  world's screens today in so many films. I  think,\r\n\r\njust  as  Japan has had great advantages in attracting\r\n\r\ntourists  to  that country, that we shall now  attract\r\n\r\nmore  tourists for the same reason.

These sections require  that  the\r\n\r\nMaster  of a foreign ship must deposit a bond  of  $50,\r\n\r\nfind  an  acceptable resident of Singapore as a  surety\r\n\r\nand enter into a crew agreement before the Port Officer\r\n\r\nprior  to signing on a seaman who is a British  subject\r\n\r\nor  a British protected person. These requirements were\r\n\r\nlegislated in days when it was not uncommon for seamen,\r\n\r\nsigned off at a foreign port, to be stranded there  and\r\n\r\nwere  designed to provide a protection against  such  a\r\n\r\ndisability.  But times have changed and  most  maritime\r\n\r\nnations have now provision for the repatriation of  all\r\n\r\nseamen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsigned  off in foreign ports. In consequence, what  was\r\n\r\nintended  as a safeguard has now become a deterrent  to\r\n\r\nemployment, since Masters tend to sign on alien  seamen\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  rather  than go  through  the  procedure\r\n\r\nrequired  for  seamen  who  are  British  subjects  and\r\n\r\nBritish  protected  persons. This situation  cannot  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  go  on by the Government  and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nsince  the  repatriation  of the  seamen  is  generally\r\n\r\nsecured  by national laws in most countries, it  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger  necessary  to discriminate in  the  methods  of\r\n\r\nsigning on, especially where such methods are likely to\r\n\r\nlose  employment in favour of alien seamen. This  Bill,\r\n\r\ntherefore, seeks to remedy this unfavourable  situation\r\n\r\nfor our seamen, and has the support of the Port Officer\r\n\r\nand  of  the Seamen's Registry Board on which both  the\r\n\r\nseamen  and  shipowners  are represented.

In the  first  nine\r\n\r\nmonths of this year, 14 million copies of no less  than\r\n\r\n36,291  publications  printed in the  Chinese  language\r\n\r\nsought  importation  into Singapore.  Of  these  36,000\r\n\r\npublications,  748  were found to be objectionable  and\r\n\r\nwere   refused   importation.  These  748   undesirable\r\n\r\npublications were the product of 101 Chinese publishing\r\n\r\nhouses, some situate in the mainland of China and  some\r\n\r\nin  Hongkong.  An analysis of these publications  shows\r\n\r\nthat the great majority emanate from a small number  of\r\n\r\npublishing  houses.  Between them, 21  such  publishing\r\n\r\nhouses were responsible for a total of no less than 502\r\n\r\nundesirable publications out of a total of 748.  During\r\n\r\nthe  same  period 40 gramophone records in the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage were refused admittance. All but four of these\r\n\r\nemanated from one source.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is in these circumstances that the Government\r\n\r\nis  seeking to amend the existing provision in the  law\r\n\r\nto permit the banning of all publications which emanate\r\n\r\nfrom   particular  sources  or  particular   publishing\r\n\r\nhouses.  As  hon.  Members will be  aware,  this  power\r\n\r\nalready exists in the Federation of Malaya and has been\r\n\r\nexercised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to provide that\r\n\r\nthe   ban   imposed  on  publications   or   types   of\r\n\r\npublications under this section shall also apply to all\r\n\r\ntranslations  of such publications. It is,  of  course,\r\n\r\npossible that there will emanate from publishing houses\r\n\r\nagainst  which such a blanket ban has been imposed  the\r\n\r\noccasional  innocuous publication for which  import  is\r\n\r\nsought.  This contingency is provided for in sub-clause\r\n\r\n(4) of clause 3 which enables specific publications  to\r\n\r\nbe exempted from any such blanket ban.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to add, Sir, that in this matter the\r\n\r\nGovernment has a duty towards the public to prevent the\r\n\r\npublication  and  circulation not  only  of  subversive\r\n\r\nliterature   but  also  of  pornographic  and   obscene\r\n\r\nliterature. This duty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis all the more important when it is remembered that  a\r\n\r\nhigh proportion of the population of Singapore today is\r\n\r\nof   an   age  at  which  they  are  still  young   and\r\n\r\nimpressionable and cannot be expected to form a  mature\r\n\r\nliterary judgment.

I believe we can  broadly  classify\r\n\r\nthese  political tracts into two categories: one, those\r\n\r\nwhich are obviously designed for propaganda and do  not\r\n\r\ncontain  anything  other than a  recital  of  facts  to\r\n\r\nglorify\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Communist  bloc; two, those tracts which  are  the\r\n\r\ntheoretical  and  ideological  dissertations   of   the\r\n\r\nCommunist bloc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curious position which we have today in\r\n\r\nSingapore - and  to  a  certain  extent   also   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation - is  that  whilst we can purchase  all  these\r\n\r\nbooks  and  tracts  in the English language,  the  same\r\n\r\nbooks  and  tracts in the Chinese language are  banned.\r\n\r\nSir,  you can go to any reputable bookshop in town  and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuy Mao Tse-tung's books in English in four volumes.  I\r\n\r\nhave  often wondered, Sir, what would be the effect  if\r\n\r\none  were  to  translate them and  print  them  in  the\r\n\r\nChinese  language.  I am quite sure  it  would  not  be\r\n\r\nwithin  the Undesirable Publications Ordinance  because\r\n\r\nthey  are  published locally. I do not  know  if  steps\r\n\r\nwould be taken to outlaw such books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, however, that unless we are prepared\r\n\r\nto  open  up the minds of our people to free discussion\r\n\r\nand  ventilation  of ideas, unless we  try  to,  so  to\r\n\r\nspeak,   inoculate  the  intellectual  sector  of   the\r\n\r\npopulation from succumbing to these ideas - if we try  to\r\n\r\ninsulate it -  I do not think, first, that we can succeed\r\n\r\ncompletely,  and  secondly, that  it  is  in  any  case\r\n\r\ndesirable, because it means that we are admitting  that\r\n\r\nthe ideas which are being propagated are beyond refute.\r\n\r\nand therefore we do not want the minds of the people to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe turned to these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seriously ask the Government to consider this point,\r\n\r\nbecause  as  time  goes on and a rising  generation  of\r\n\r\nChinese-educated  intellectuals comes  into  being,  we\r\n\r\nhave to cease pretending that China does not exist.  In\r\n\r\nfact, nobody pretends it any more, not even Mr Dulles.\r\n\r\nWe have to explain to our people why it is - as indeed if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  hope to sustain the democratic system in Malaya, we\r\n\r\nmust  explain - that  despite all the material  advances,\r\n\r\nall  the  longest rivers and bridges in the world,  the\r\n\r\nbiggest output of textiles in the world, our system  in\r\n\r\nso  far  as  we are concerned in Malaya is worth  while\r\n\r\ncontinuing  and  sustaining;  that  despite  all  these\r\n\r\n\"great  and glorious achievements\", there are  hundreds\r\n\r\nof people who still want to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncome  from  China to Malaya for the simple reason  that\r\n\r\nlife is not quite so bad in Malaya. If you isolate your\r\n\r\nintellectuals  from  a  free  and  open  discussion  of\r\n\r\npolitical ideas as such, as distinct from the technique\r\n\r\nof  the revolution, the organisational side of it, then\r\n\r\nnot  only  will  you fail but you will  also  create  a\r\n\r\ndangerous situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, although we would not seriously quarrel\r\n\r\nwith  the  intentions of the Government  of  trying  to\r\n\r\nprevent immature minds from being overwhelmed by facile\r\n\r\nand  cleverly thought-out propaganda, we should at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time accept the challenge which is all  the  time\r\n\r\nthere of the ideological battle - that the history of the\r\n\r\nworld  is not preordained; that in fact it is not  true\r\n\r\nthat  history has already been written up a  long  time\r\n\r\nago;  that the world is going to be what Marx  said  it\r\n\r\nwas  going to be; and that if the Americans had let  go\r\n\r\none  big  bomb  in  1947,  something  else  might  have\r\n\r\nhappened  to the world - and create in our generation  in\r\n\r\nMalaya,   men  of  sufficient  intellectual  fibre   to\r\n\r\nwithstand  the stresses and strains of the  ideological\r\n\r\nbattle  between  the two power blocs  which,  far  from\r\n\r\nbecoming  less  acute as time goes on,  appears  to  be\r\n\r\ngetting   more   and  more  acute  as  the   cold   war\r\n\r\nintensifies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Secretary, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, I am very glad that for once I am in\r\n\r\ntune with the opinions of the hon.

Nair):</b> Sir, I rise to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report of the Select Committee on the Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments  Bill, as contained in  Sessional  Paper\r\n\r\nNo. L.A. 12 of 1958, be adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be seen that the Select Committee held\r\n\r\nfour  meetings  and considered written  representations\r\n\r\nreceived from and heard oral evidence given by a number\r\n\r\nof  interested bodies. A number of amendments have been\r\n\r\nmade  to the text of the Bill and these amendments  are\r\n\r\nincorporated  in the Bill appearing as Appendix  II  of\r\n\r\nthe Report. Some of the amendments are substantial ones\r\n\r\nand  I would like to draw the attention of hon. Members\r\n\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After considering representations made to the\r\n\r\nCommittee,  clause  8 has been amended  to  extend  the\r\n\r\nmaximum period of expiry of a licence from three months\r\n\r\nto 12 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 attracted, as expected, most of the\r\n\r\nrepresentations  made  on the Bill.  Various  arguments\r\n\r\nwere  put  forward that the under 16 years of age  non-admittance  provision should be extremely difficult  to\r\n\r\ncarry out in practice,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nespecially  in cinemas. The Government's view  is  that\r\n\r\nthis  provision should remain, as it is considered that\r\n\r\nit  should be enforced in respect of certain classes of\r\n\r\nentertainment   which  need  not  necessarily   include\r\n\r\ncinemas.  Sir,  in  the  interests  of  youth  welfare,\r\n\r\noperators  of  certain types of entertainment  must  be\r\n\r\nmade  to  realise  their responsibility  in  preventing\r\n\r\nunderage  children  from entering their  premises.  The\r\n\r\nCommittee has, however, amended this clause to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  the  Minister instead of the Licensing Officer  to\r\n\r\nprescribe by notification in the Gazette what  type  of\r\n\r\npublic entertainment is to be made subject to the under\r\n\r\n16 years of age provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to clause 11, Sir, objections were raised\r\n\r\nagainst  the  requirement of  giving  security.  It  is\r\n\r\nconsidered,  however, that the furnishing  of  security\r\n\r\nhas been most useful in the control of certain types of\r\n\r\nshows.   However,  in  order  to  meet  some   of   the\r\n\r\nrepresentations  made, the clause has been  amended  to\r\n\r\nlimit  the  powers  of  the Licensing  Officer  and  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  the  Minister,  by  notification  in  the\r\n\r\nGazette,  to limit the amount of security and the  type\r\n\r\nof  entertainment and also to provide for an appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe Minister in the event of forfeiture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clauses 13 and 14 amendments have been made to\r\n\r\nstipulate  a  reasonable period of  seven  days  within\r\n\r\nwhich the grounds for the refusal of the licence should\r\n\r\nbe  furnished  to  an applicant. No period  was  stated\r\n\r\npreviously in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, after considering the representations\r\n\r\nmade  on clause 22 of the draft Bill, the clause  which\r\n\r\nallows  the  Licensing Officer to seek  the  advice  of\r\n\r\nbodies  associated with the control of boxing promotion\r\n\r\nevents  or public entertainment, and provides  that  it\r\n\r\nshall  be sufficient ground for refusing an application\r\n\r\nif  any  such  body advises refusal, the Committee  has\r\n\r\ndeleted the whole clause from the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, Sir, are the major amendments to the Bill. The\r\n\r\nother  amendments  made are either self-explanatory  or\r\n\r\nfor  the purpose of improving the drafting of the  Bill\r\n\r\nand  do not, I think, call for any comment.

In  keeping\r\n\r\nwith our policy of placing the minimum restrictions  on\r\n\r\ntrade,  these powers have been used very sparingly  and\r\n\r\nmost  imports are placed on open general licence, while\r\n\r\nin general exports have been freely licensed. But it is\r\n\r\nstill necessary to retain powers for maintaining export\r\n\r\ncontrol of certain strategic supplies in order that  we\r\n\r\nmay   meet  our  international  obligations,  as,   for\r\n\r\nexample,  controlling gold dollar imports  which  is  a\r\n\r\nnecessary  part  of  our policy  as  a  member  of  the\r\n\r\nsterling area.

The reasons for these supplementary  votes\r\n\r\nare  given in detail in the Sessional Paper. There  are\r\n\r\ntwo items which involve a substantial sum of money. One\r\n\r\nof  them  refers to the construction of four  secondary\r\n\r\nschools for which $1,000,000 has been provided for this\r\n\r\nyear. Work has progressed faster than was envisaged  at\r\n\r\nthe  time  when  the  Estimates were  prepared.

These schools are urgently needed  and  when\r\n\r\nthey are completed will meet the present demand in  the\r\n\r\nvarious districts. The second one refers to the  Muslim\r\n\r\nWelfare  Home for destitute Muslim women. This  project\r\n\r\nhas  been  under consideration for some time.  A  token\r\n\r\nprovision  was  provided  in the  Estimates  to  enable\r\n\r\nplanning to be carried out.

The whole civics programme was first instituted\r\n\r\nin the year 1957 as the Government felt a very big need\r\n\r\nto  associate  the  masses with  the  Government  as  a\r\n\r\ncontinuing function of the social system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighty-one courses were held in the year 1957 and\r\n\r\n1,863  persons  representing various  organised  bodies\r\n\r\nattended  these courses which were then held  twice  or\r\n\r\nthrice  weekly. In the year 1958, more frequent courses\r\n\r\nbecame  necessary  because  of  the  great  demand  and\r\n\r\nbecause  the  advantages accorded to  the  participants\r\n\r\nbecame  more  and more evident. 120 courses  have  been\r\n\r\nheld  in  the  year 1958 up to date and  3,260  persons\r\n\r\nrepresenting  various organised bodies participated  in\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad, Sir, to note that as a result of these\r\n\r\ncourses,  Government  has been  able  to  instil  civic\r\n\r\nconsciousness among the people. It is apparent that the\r\n\r\nhitherto limited civic consciousness - just like:\r\n\r\n\"It  is not my business\" - plus the inability to conceive\r\n\r\nthe scale on which Government operates, with consequent\r\n\r\nignorance of what is going on, have given way to a  new\r\n\r\nspirit  of civic duties and responsibilities among  the\r\n\r\npeople.  The  people who have attended  these  courses,\r\n\r\nSir,  were  of  both sexes and came from all  walks  of\r\n\r\nlife - to  mention  a  few, fishermen, farmers,  hawkers,\r\n\r\nindustrial workers, insurance men, storytellers,  rural\r\n\r\ndwellers, city dwellers, islanders, teachers, taxi men,\r\n\r\nbarbers, University undergraduates and students\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  English, Chinese, Malay and Indian  schools.

This proposal is estimated to  bring\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan additional $40,000 in a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Altogether, Sir, the increased levy in duty will\r\n\r\nbring an additional revenue of about $2.3 million in  a\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the incidence falls on the more expensive brands\r\n\r\nof  cigarettes  and  pipe tobacco, which  are  normally\r\n\r\nconsumed by the well-to-do, it is appropriate that this\r\n\r\nclass of the population should bear this increased tax.\r\n\r\nThis  proposal  is in accordance with the  Government's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicy  that  the burden of additional taxation  should\r\n\r\nfall on those who are able to bear\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, I second it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.17 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is rather\r\n\r\nsurprising  that  the  Government  should  consider  an\r\n\r\nincrease of duty on tobacco at this moment, it would be\r\n\r\nrather  interesting if the Hon. the Financial Secretary\r\n\r\ncould give us figures on the revenue from liquor before\r\n\r\nand  after the increase of duty. I am informed that the\r\n\r\nrevenue  from  liquor  has dropped  considerably  since\r\n\r\nthen.  I wonder if the Hon, the Financial Secretary  is\r\n\r\naware  of  a  warning given by the leading tobacco  and\r\n\r\ncigarette  dealers  in  Singapore.  I  quote  from  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Standard of 4th October, 1958, and  this  is\r\n\r\nthe warning given:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Leading tobacco and cigarette distributors yesterday\r\n\r\nwarned  the  Singapore Government that the  extra  duty\r\n\r\nimposed on cigarettes and tobacco would have an adverse\r\n\r\neffect on the national revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were of the opinion that consumption of\r\n\r\ncigarettes and tobacco would fall if duty was raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also warned Government that with the imposition\r\n\r\nof  extra duty, there would be an increase in smuggling\r\n\r\nof cigarettes and tobacco into the Colony.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  Hon. the  Financial Secretary  told  us  that  he\r\n\r\nexpects  an  increase in revenue of about  $40,000  per\r\n\r\nyear  due  to this increase of duty on tobacco  but  it\r\n\r\nappears  that the leading tobacco and cigarette dealers\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  think otherwise because they  feel  that\r\n\r\nwith   this  increase  in  duty,  the  consumption   of\r\n\r\ncigarettes  will fall. The first warning, as  contained\r\n\r\nin  that report, is that if this duty is increased, the\r\n\r\nconsumption of cigarettes will definitely fall, as  was\r\n\r\nthe  case  with  liquor after the duty  on  liquor  was\r\n\r\nincreased.  Sir, if this presumption is  correct,  then\r\n\r\nthe  result  may  be  that instead of  an  increase  in\r\n\r\nrevenue,  Government may have to lose some revenue  and\r\n\r\nthis should be an eye-opener to the Government. So  why\r\n\r\nintroduce  such an increase of duty on tobacco  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  when  Government has experienced a considerable\r\n\r\nloss of revenue on liquor after the duty on liquor  was\r\n\r\nincreased?  Is Government prepared to lose  revenue  on\r\n\r\ntobacco  due to this increase in the same way  as  they\r\n\r\nhave  suffered on liquor? Certainly not!  I  am  afraid\r\n\r\nthat the Hon. the Financial Secretary may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncome  back to this Assembly with a deficit in  the  new\r\n\r\nBudget  and  ask  for more taxes to be  levied  on  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second warning is that smuggling of cigarettes and\r\n\r\ntobacco will increase. I agree with that because it  is\r\n\r\nobvious that if duty on tobacco is increased, the price\r\n\r\nof cigarettes will certainly increase and the smugglers\r\n\r\nwill turn their attention more to smuggling tobacco and\r\n\r\ncigarettes because of the bigger margin of profit  that\r\n\r\nwould  accrue to them. So this would give the smugglers\r\n\r\nmore  encouragement  to smuggle tobacco  or  cigarettes\r\n\r\ninto the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Financial Secretary, he says that\r\n\r\nthis increase will not affect the lower income group as\r\n\r\nhe  feels  that  cigars are only smoked by  the  higher\r\n\r\nincome  group. But does he realise that even the  lower\r\n\r\nincome group do smoke an inferior type of cigars? It is\r\n\r\nonly  the rich who smoke the good brands of cigars  but\r\n\r\nthe  inferior brands of cigars are smoked by the middle\r\n\r\nor  poorer class of people and, for his information,  I\r\n\r\nhave  been told that it is far cheaper to smoke  cigars\r\n\r\nthan  cigarettes. So if this increase is confirmed,  it\r\n\r\nwill  certainly affect the lower income  group  and  if\r\n\r\nthey  cannot afford this increase, I think there is  no\r\n\r\nalternative  for  them  but to stop  smoking.  If  they\r\n\r\nreally  stop  smoking, then where  is  the  revenue  of\r\n\r\n$40,000  per year that the Financial Secretary  expects\r\n\r\nto get?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must, Sir, emphasise that I am against the\r\n\r\nconfirmation  of  this  increase,  not  because  I   am\r\n\r\npersonally affected. It is in the interest of the lower\r\n\r\nincome group that I am against the confirmation of this\r\n\r\nincrease. I am not a smoker myself. So whether there is\r\n\r\nor  there  is  no  increase,  it  does  not  affect  me\r\n\r\npersonally.  What I am afraid is that those  who  smoke\r\n\r\nand who cannot find the money to smoke will have to  be\r\n\r\nnon-smokers, like myself, and the result may be a  loss\r\n\r\nof  an  expected $40,000 per year in increased  revenue\r\n\r\ncontrary to what the Financial Secretary says.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I oppose the confirmation of the Customs (Duties)\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Order, 1958, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.22 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

I  am\r\n\r\nquite  sure that he would not like them to have  cancer\r\n\r\nand his argument is: \"If they all gave up smoking, I am\r\n\r\nquite sure that he would support them and wish them all\r\n\r\nlong  life.  If they did stop, we would not bemoan  the\r\n\r\nfact  that the expected $2 million increase in  revenue\r\n\r\ndoes not materialise.\" But when Mr Mason says that  he\r\n\r\nthinks we ought not to amend the law, the reason  being\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  unlikely  that  the  increase  would   be\r\n\r\nprofitable,  because  any expected  increase  might  be\r\n\r\noffset  by  the  increase in the cost of collection,  I\r\n\r\nsay,  but surely in that case, what we need is a really\r\n\r\ngood expert who will see that these taxes are collected\r\n\r\nefficiently  and  cheaply and if smugglers  do  put  on\r\n\r\nfaster speed boats, well what the smugglers can buy, so\r\n\r\ncan  the Government. I am quite sure that it should not\r\n\r\nbe  beyond  the ingenuity of our Customs Department  to\r\n\r\nget  the right kind of speed boats with the right  kind\r\n\r\nof  depth  clearance and horsepower so as to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat no more smugglers get by than what usually get  by\r\n\r\nin  any  case.

They will keep on smuggling  in  any\r\n\r\ncase  because,  even  at  the  present  rates,  it   is\r\n\r\nprofitable. If the Financial Secretary eventually  does\r\n\r\ncollect  $2.2 million extra, good luck to  him.

Then  where   is   the\r\n\r\nsubversive element in that Member for Bukit Timah?  You\r\n\r\ncan never tell, and if the P.A.P. comes into power, he is\r\n\r\nreleased  and  contests  the  elections,  there  is   a\r\n\r\npossibility  that he may be the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara\r\n\r\nof Singapore. [Interruption.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> - or the Prime Minister, I am so\r\n\r\nsorry. But if he does not contest the elections, and if\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. do decide to release him, and because he has\r\n\r\nbeen  deprived the opportunity of contesting the  first\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections,  the  P.A.P. may  consider  making\r\n\r\nhim - if  he  quits  his  own Party - the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Looking at the motion, I cannot\r\n\r\nfind  the  name of the Member for Bukit Timah (Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong). Neither can I find any reference to  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan  Negara. Will the hon.  Member  please\r\n\r\nkeep to the terms of his motion as closely as possible?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am much obliged to you, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker. I was just explaining what \"subversive\" means,\r\n\r\nand  that the day may come when these elements of today\r\n\r\nmay become the leaders of tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, however serious their crime may be, banishment to\r\n\r\na  foreign  country against their will of persons  born\r\n\r\nand bred in Malaya - I will emphasize those words because\r\n\r\nit  was  not  of  their own free will  that  they  were\r\n\r\nprepared  to be deported to China, although  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  Chief Minister has, in his hands,  a  signed\r\n\r\nstatement.  The signatories may be forced to  sign  the\r\n\r\nstatement that they are prepared to be deported.  I  am\r\n\r\njust saying - I am not sure - so it is up to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister whether he has in his hands  signed\r\n\r\nstatements by such persons that they are prepared to be\r\n\r\ndeported  to China. In fact, it was against  their  own\r\n\r\nwill. And if that was the case, the deporting of people\r\n\r\nagainst  their  own  will is  most  cruel  and  a  most\r\n\r\nbarbaric  form of punishment. This form of  punishment,\r\n\r\nSir, is unthinkable in these days, especially when  the\r\n\r\npersons  concerned are natural-born persons of  Malaya.\r\n\r\nAs  stated in my motion, Sir, the interpretation of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlaw  in  section  2 of the Interpretation  and  6eneral\r\n\r\nClauses  Ordinance (Chapter 2) says that  Malaya  means\r\n\r\neither the Federation of Malaya or Singapore; so it  is\r\n\r\njust  the  same where Malaya or Singapore is concerned.\r\n\r\nArticle 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Everyone has a right to a nationality. No one shall\r\n\r\nbe  arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor  denied\r\n\r\nthe right to change his nationality.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now  these persons, were they given the chance or  have\r\n\r\nthey ever applied to change their nationality? No.  Let\r\n\r\nus  take their cases, Sir, one by one, or I will  quote\r\n\r\none  instance, the case of Wong Yih Ching.  I  am  told\r\n\r\nthat  he was born in Segamat, Johore, in 1932.  I  also\r\n\r\nunderstand   that  his  father  is  now  a   registered\r\n\r\nFederation citizen. This shows beyond doubt, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe  loyalty  of the father and the son is with  Malaya\r\n\r\nand  nowhere  else,  not with a  foreign  country.  His\r\n\r\nrelatives,  I  am  told again, were  also  educated  in\r\n\r\nMalaya  and  none of his relatives had  ever  left  the\r\n\r\nshores  of  Malaya. I understand also  that  he  was  a\r\n\r\nregistered  voter  and  voted in the  last  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  elections in 1955. He might  have  cast  his\r\n\r\nvote to put the Labour Front into power, or to put  any\r\n\r\none of us here today. If it were not for that vote, one\r\n\r\nof  us might not be here today. Now, what did he get in\r\n\r\nreturn  for  casting his vote for us to  be  here?  The\r\n\r\nreturn  that we offered him is to send him to China,  a\r\n\r\nforeign  country. It is really curious, Sir, that  this\r\n\r\nman,  although  born in Malaya and detained  under  the\r\n\r\nPreservation of Public Security Ordinance and not under\r\n\r\nthe   Banishment  Ordinance,  is  being  banished.  The\r\n\r\npersons mentioned in my motion were arrested under  the\r\n\r\nP.P.S.O., they were not detained\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder the Banishment Ordinance, and although they  were\r\n\r\nborn in Malaya, they were banished. I cannot understand\r\n\r\nthe  acts of the Government. But some persons who  were\r\n\r\nborn  in  China  and were actually detained  under  the\r\n\r\nBanishment  Ordinance are free to move  about  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  This is the type of discrimination  I  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand. So much has been talked this morning  about\r\n\r\nDr  Chuang; so much has been talked about Linda  Chen;\r\n\r\nare  not  these two China-born persons? Were not  these\r\n\r\ntwo persons arrested under the Banishment Ordinance? In\r\n\r\nspite  of  the  fact that they were born in  China  and\r\n\r\ndetained under the Banishment Ordinance, they  are  set\r\n\r\nfree  without  an explanation from the Government.  But\r\n\r\nthese seven persons, born, bred and educated in Malaya,\r\n\r\nare  banished, though they were detained at  that  time\r\n\r\nunder   the  P.P.S.O. and  not  under  the  Banishment\r\n\r\nOrdinance. I remember, Sir, at one time when  a  Member\r\n\r\nof this House tabled questions on the Banishment Orders\r\n\r\nin  respect  of those persons born in China (not  these\r\n\r\nseven persons), the then Acting Chief Secretary replied\r\n\r\nthat  those persons were detained and would be banished\r\n\r\nafter  very, very careful consideration. I am referring\r\n\r\nto  those persons who were born in China, that is,  Dr\r\n\r\nChuang and Linda Chen. Now, after the decision has been\r\n\r\ntaken  with  very,  very  careful  consideration,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment can revoke the Banishment Orders in  respect\r\n\r\nof these persons. I cannot understand this. However,  I\r\n\r\nam  happy that these persons are now set free,  because\r\n\r\nat  that  time when they were detained, I was  in  full\r\n\r\nsympathy  with them too. So I am very happy  that  they\r\n\r\nare  now  free, as a result of the sympathy, I suppose,\r\n\r\nof the Chief Minister. Just compare the vast difference\r\n\r\nbetween  these  two instances - born in Malaya,  detained\r\n\r\nunder the P.P.S.O. but banished to China; born in China\r\n\r\ndetained  under the Banishment Ordinance, but are  free\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  What a vast difference!  These  persons\r\n\r\nhave  no relatives, no brothers, no sisters, nor anyone\r\n\r\nin  China,  and China is a foreign place to them.  They\r\n\r\nwere never educated nor ever went to Formosa; now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  they  are sent to a foreign country, how  can  we\r\n\r\nexpect  them to exist? I cannot understand.  Sir,  both\r\n\r\nthe    Singapore   Citizenship   Ordinance   and    the\r\n\r\nConstitution   of  the  Federation  of  Malaya   confer\r\n\r\ncitizenship rights on these persons. They ought to have\r\n\r\nbeen  allowed to register themselves either as  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens  or Singapore citizens; but just because  they\r\n\r\nwere detained, they have been deprived of the right  to\r\n\r\nregister  themselves as citizens of  either  territory.\r\n\r\nArticle  16  of  the  Federation Constitution  provides\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizenship  by  registration of persons  born  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya after Merdeka  Day.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nSir,  under  this article, these seven  persons  should\r\n\r\nhave  been entitled and given the privilege to register\r\n\r\nthemselves  as  Federal  citizens.  According  to  that\r\n\r\nConstitution the only qualifications required are:  (1)\r\n\r\nthat  a  person intends to stay permanently in  Malaya;\r\n\r\n(2)  he must be of good character; and (3) he must have\r\n\r\nan  elementary knowledge of Malay. These seven persons,\r\n\r\nto  my knowledge, do have all these qualifications  and\r\n\r\nshould be entitled to the protection provided for under\r\n\r\nthis article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of information, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Yes, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, the hon.

As far as that  Ordinance  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, the word \"character\" appears only  on  Forms\r\n\r\n(A)  and  (B) with a small footnote. So the  expression\r\n\r\n\"good  character\"  as  defined  there  is  not  clearly\r\n\r\nunderstood. Secondly, a man who has not been imprisoned\r\n\r\nshould be deemed to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  \"good character\". Unless he has been sent  to  gaol\r\n\r\nfor  more  than  twelve months - I believe  that  is  the\r\n\r\ninterpretation - then only can we deem such person to be\r\n\r\nnot  of good character. That is why I say, Sir, in  the\r\n\r\nabsence of any conviction of any of these persons, they\r\n\r\nshould be deemed to be of good character. How could you\r\n\r\nclassify  them  as of \"bad character\"  when  they  were\r\n\r\nnever  convicted? I hope that the Chief  Minister  will\r\n\r\nagree  with the interpretation of this expression \"good\r\n\r\ncharacter\". Had it not been for their detention, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  sure that they would have got themselves registered\r\n\r\neither  as Federal citizens or Singapore citizens;  and\r\n\r\neven  then,  if they are released from detention,  they\r\n\r\nare  still  entitled to register themselves as  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens. This fact was confirmed in a statement  given\r\n\r\nto  the  Press  on  the 3rd of September,  1958,  by  a\r\n\r\nspokesman  of  the  Ministry of  External  Affairs.  It\r\n\r\nappeared  in  the Singapore Standard of 3rd  September.\r\n\r\n1958, and this is what appeared therein:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Kuala Lumpur, Tuesday - A person who is eligible for\r\n\r\nFederal  citizenship is not disqualified from  applying\r\n\r\nfor  it  even  if  he  is  detained  in  Singapore  for\r\n\r\npolitical reasons. He can still be considered to be  of\r\n\r\ngood character.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  was  stated by the spokesman - \"he  can  still  be\r\n\r\nconsidered to be of good character\" although he was  or\r\n\r\nhe   can   be   detained  in  Singapore  for  political\r\n\r\nreasons - that is what is meant by \"good character\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This was disclosed to The Standard by the Ministry\r\n\r\nfor  External Affairs spokesman, Inche Zaiton  Ibrahim,\r\n\r\nand  the  Senior Registration Officer,  Mr  J.

We have legislation in Singapore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,  to  punish persons who are cruel to  animals  and\r\n\r\npoultry, including fowls. When a fowl is carried  in  a\r\n\r\ncruel way, Government punishes the wrongdoer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYet  it  is  the  Government which  is  the  wrongdoer,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  commits the extreme cruelty  by  deporting\r\n\r\nthese  seven  persons  by separating  them  from  their\r\n\r\nchildren,  their brothers, their sisters, their  wives,\r\n\r\nor  whatever relatives they may have. So is this not  a\r\n\r\ncruel  thing  to  do? Is there no law  whereby  we  can\r\n\r\nprotect  these persons? If we can have a law to protect\r\n\r\ncruelty  to animals, why then cannot we have a  law  to\r\n\r\nprotect cruelty to human beings? Are human beings worse\r\n\r\nthan animals? Let us put it that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this Assembly we have never passed any law or\r\n\r\nrule  to prevent a detainee from being registered as  a\r\n\r\ncitizen  of Singapore. I cannot remember that. So  then\r\n\r\nwhy  should Government misuse or twist a phrase of  the\r\n\r\nlaw  and thus bring it into disrepute? Should democracy\r\n\r\nbe  exercised in favour of only the very few  rich  and\r\n\r\nself-centred politicians? Justice must be done  to  one\r\n\r\nand all, and not only to a very few elected politicians\r\n\r\nor  high-class people. Unless detainees can be tried in\r\n\r\nthe  courts of law, why disregard the law and deny them\r\n\r\nthis  legal right? Now, take the case of Lim Inn  Ping.\r\n\r\nHe  was,  I  understand,  a  former  President  of  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore Taxi Drivers' Union. He was born in  1923  in\r\n\r\nYong Peng, Johore, which is very close to Singapore. He\r\n\r\nwas  educated  in Malaya, and was also a voter  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Legislative  Assembly  elections  in   1955.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, Sir, in the last Cairnhill by-election he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  a proposer of a candidate who contested that  ward\r\n\r\nfor  the  by-election. If he is a man of bad character,\r\n\r\nif he is a subversive element, why was he allowed to be\r\n\r\na proposer of a candidate to contest the by-election in\r\n\r\nCairnhill? It is rather unfortunate that that candidate\r\n\r\nis  not  successful,  so  we  have  a  new  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill sitting with us here. Had that candidate been\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Cairnhill today and sitting with us  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly, I am sure that I can receive  one  more\r\n\r\nvote.  Inn  Ping is married and has a wife in Singapore\r\n\r\nalso. This man\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas no relatives, as I have emphasised again and again,\r\n\r\nin  China and why should he be banished then? The  same\r\n\r\napplies  to the others mentioned in my motion. Many  of\r\n\r\nthem,   I  believe,  were  also  voters  in  the   last\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly elections. Had it  not  been  for\r\n\r\ntheir  votes, as I say, the Labour Front may  not  have\r\n\r\ncome  into power, or some of us may not have been here.\r\n\r\nBut I think that the votes went to the P.A.P., that is,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the  Members  for  Tanjong  Pagar,  Sembawang  and\r\n\r\nPonggol-Tampines. These people are more inclined to the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. than anybody else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this, Sir, is quite clear to us now that the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  action to deport them to China  is  very,\r\n\r\nvery  high-handed. It is also dictatorial and  a  gross\r\n\r\nabuse  of human rights. Therefore, I appeal to  Members\r\n\r\nto  support  my motion though I doubt I  can  have  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  whole House. Maybe I  will  have  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  two or three Members. We must,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthen  strongly  deplore  and condemn  the  undemocratic\r\n\r\nattitude  and the high-handed action of the  Government\r\n\r\nto  banish  these seven persons to China against  their\r\n\r\nwill.  We  must  also  ask Government  to  revoke  this\r\n\r\ndecision and bring back these persons to their place of\r\n\r\nbirth, which is Malaya. Unless that is done, Sir, their\r\n\r\nparents,  their  wives, or brothers and sisters,  would\r\n\r\nnever  be  happy,  as  the  Chief  Minister  said  this\r\n\r\nmorning. He has sympathy, he is human and he knows  the\r\n\r\ngrievances of these persons. So if he does really  feel\r\n\r\nsorry  for  these persons and know what  sorrow  is,  I\r\n\r\nthink he should with all his power revoked the decision\r\n\r\nand bring them back.

Member\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor   Queenstown  repeatedly  used,   words   such   as\r\n\r\n\"inhuman\",  \"contempt  for human  rights\"  and  \"cruel,\r\n\r\nbrutal, merciless\", and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the function of a government to maintain\r\n\r\ninternal peace and to secure the lives of citizens from\r\n\r\nthose  who  illegally use force. This House  has  fully\r\n\r\nassented  to  that  view  as  regards  secret   society\r\n\r\ngangsters.  Everyone recognizes the need for  that,  or\r\n\r\nnearly  everybody recognizes the need for that,  except\r\n\r\nsome  gangsters. Everybody who seriously looks  at  the\r\n\r\nfacts of the situation knows perfectly well that secret\r\n\r\nsociety   gangsters'  use  of  violence  is   of   less\r\n\r\nimportance than the Communist use of violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I happened just now, Mr Speaker, Sir, to be in the\r\n\r\nLibrary   and  read  the  latest  copy  of   the   \"New\r\n\r\nStatesman\". I cannot produce it unless you wish me  to.\r\n\r\nBut  I  have made a note of the figures quoted therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Acting Prime Minister of the Federation is  quoted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  giving  the  following figures  of  people  killed,\r\n\r\nwounded  and missing in the course of the Emergency  in\r\n\r\nthe Federation:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n               3,674     Malays\r\n\r\n              14,213     Chinese\r\n\r\n                 765     Indians\r\n\r\n                 349     Europeans and\r\n\r\n                 240     Aborigines\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>These  are  men,  women  and children,  in  many  cases\r\n\r\nmembers of families with their relatives, and these are\r\n\r\npeople whose relatives are suffering; not suffering  by\r\n\r\nseeing  somebody sent overseas, but seeing them wounded\r\n\r\nor  murdered;  seeing  their bodies  brought  home  and\r\n\r\nhaving  to do without them forever afterwards,  and  to\r\n\r\nknow that they died in a cruel and horrible war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member asked, \"Are human beings worse than\r\n\r\nanimals?\" The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanswer  is  definitely yes in some cases. Animals  have\r\n\r\nnot  killed 19,000 human beings in Malaya. It is  human\r\n\r\nbeings  who have killed 19,000 human beings,  and  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to do it unless the forces of law  and  order\r\n\r\nuse the necessary courage in facing this unhappy aspect\r\n\r\nof society. It is difficult to contain one's impatience\r\n\r\nwith people who, for purposes best known to themselves,\r\n\r\nget  up and put up an inaccurate and ill-prepared  case\r\n\r\nand mix it up with words which ought not to be used  in\r\n\r\nthis  connection - inhuman cruelty and  phrases  of  that\r\n\r\nsort. The inhuman cruelty lies on the other side of the\r\n\r\nfence, and it is against that inhuman cruelty that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must  act  with  strength  to  protect  the\r\n\r\nharmless and innocent citizens of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, before I come to the motion itself, I\r\n\r\nwould  like just to clear up one or two points of  fact\r\n\r\narising  out  of  the  speech of the  hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown. In the first place, Mr Lim Kean Chye is  a\r\n\r\nBritish   subject  born  in  Malaya,  and   under   our\r\n\r\nimmigration  legislation he has the right of  entry  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Sir, is that the hon. Member\r\n\r\nreferred to one of the persons mentioned in his  motion\r\n\r\nas  being married, and he then went on to say that  the\r\n\r\nsame thing applied to all the others. In fact, all  the\r\n\r\nother  six  persons mentioned in his motion are  single\r\n\r\npersons with no dependants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should now like to return to the terms of the motion\r\n\r\nitself.  The motion, Sir, seems to me to be  rather  an\r\n\r\ninept  attempt by the use of confusing language to  try\r\n\r\nand  imply  that  the law in this matter  is  something\r\n\r\ndifferent from what it is. The Member for Queenstown is\r\n\r\nfully  aware  that  if the persons whose  cause  he  is\r\n\r\npleading had any claim arising from their birth in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya,  that  claim  could  only  rest\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Government  of the  Federation.  What  is\r\n\r\ncrystal  clear  is that they are not British  subjects,\r\n\r\nnor  are  they  Singapore  citizens  and  can  have  no\r\n\r\nconceivable  claim  on  that  ground  to  a  right   of\r\n\r\nresidence in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  he  seeks  by  the  use  of  some  loose\r\n\r\nphraseology, associating the Federation of  Malaya  and\r\n\r\nSingapore together, to imply not only that birth in the\r\n\r\nFederation in some way confers rights in Singapore, but\r\n\r\nalso   that  the  Singapore  Government  is  under   an\r\n\r\nobligation to accept greater responsibilities on behalf\r\n\r\nof  these  persons  than the Federation  Government  is\r\n\r\nitself  prepared  to  accept.  Looking,  Sir,  at   the\r\n\r\noperative  terms  of  this motion - \"these  persons  were\r\n\r\nborn,  bred and educated in Malaya, which term  in  law\r\n\r\nmeans  the Federation of Malaya and Singapore, thereby,\r\n\r\ndepriving the aforesaid natural born, persons of Malaya\r\n\r\nof  their inalienable rights of citizenship, whether of\r\n\r\nSingapore   or   of  the  Federation  of   Malaya\" - that\r\n\r\nphraseology will bear a little analysis. \"Malaya, which\r\n\r\nterm  in  law  means  the  Federation  of  Malaya   and\r\n\r\nSingapore\". Certainly, Sir, the term \"Malaya\"  is  used\r\n\r\nas  a convenient geographical description for the Malay\r\n\r\nPeninsula, including Singapore, but by what conceivable\r\n\r\nauthority  does the hon. Member claim that the  use  of\r\n\r\nthis  geographical expression in itself can create  any\r\n\r\nrights or obligations? The word \"Assembly\" is a term in\r\n\r\nlaw used to embrace all the Members in this House, both\r\n\r\nMembers  on  the  Government Bench and Members  on  the\r\n\r\nOpposition    Bench - not   forgetting   yourself,    Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker - but it would be equally logical to  claim  that\r\n\r\nthe  use of the word \"Assembly\" created and imposed  an\r\n\r\nobligation on the Members of the opposite side  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse to vote for the Government. No, Sir, the fact  is\r\n\r\nthat  this  term  is a descriptive, geographical  term,\r\n\r\nwhether it be Malaya or the Malayan Archipelago, South-East Asia or anything else, and in itself it can create\r\n\r\nno rights and impose no obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going on a little further, Sir, with the terms of\r\n\r\nthis  motion - \"thereby depriving the aforesaid  natural-born  persons of Malaya of their inalienable rights  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship, whether of Singapore or the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya\" - what rights of citizenship does the hon. Member\r\n\r\nrefer  to? He must be well aware, or if he is not,  his\r\n\r\nadvisers certainly are, that citizenship -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I have no advisers, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> I beg his pardon! - citizenship both in the\r\n\r\nFederation and in Singapore is defined and governed  by\r\n\r\nlaw; and in the law - Singapore citizenship law - there  is\r\n\r\nno mention of the word \"Malaya\". What then does he mean\r\n\r\nby the words \"whether of Singapore or the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya\"?  Does  he  mean that they  were  born  on  the\r\n\r\ncauseway?  If  not, is he trying to assert  that  these\r\n\r\npersons  in fact had Singapore citizenship? If  he  is,\r\n\r\nthen  let  him  say  so.  The fact  is  that  he  knows\r\n\r\nperfectly  well that he cannot make that assertion.  Is\r\n\r\nhe then asserting that these persons had citizenship of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation, Federal citizenship?  Again  he  knows\r\n\r\nquite  well that he cannot assert anything of the kind.\r\n\r\nThen  what  does  he  mean by this  term,  \"inalienable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrights  of citizenship, whether of Singapore or of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya\"? I suggest, Sir, that it is  just\r\n\r\na  nice  high-sounding  phrase  which  means  precisely\r\n\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the hon. Member is really getting at and what is\r\n\r\nbehind his motion, I suggest, is the point on which  he\r\n\r\nonly  touched  very  briefly, and that  is  that  these\r\n\r\npersons  ought  to  be  recognised  by  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  as being eligible and having the  right  to\r\n\r\nFederal  citizenship. But that is not the way in  which\r\n\r\nhe  has expressed his motion: firstly, because it would\r\n\r\nbe  an  attack on the Federation Government,  which  he\r\n\r\nprobably is reluctant to undertake; and, secondly, Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  would be ruled out of order  by  yourself;\r\n\r\nand, thirdly, because he wants to train his guns on the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government which, as he well knows,  has  no\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  the  citizenship   laws   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation. Moreover, it may interest him to know  that\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government was consulted and  concurred\r\n\r\nin  these banishments. I suggest, Sir, that the  action\r\n\r\ntaken  in these cases is legally unassailable  and  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  knows it, for all the cloud of  verbiage,\r\n\r\nwith which he seeks to surround it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then, Sir, are the merits? The hon. Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  painted  a picture of sorrow  and  hardship\r\n\r\nwith the evident intention of trying to enlist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  sympathy of his hearers for these poor unfortunate\r\n\r\npersons.  Here  again, Sir, when the embellishments  of\r\n\r\nwhich  he  is such a pastmaster have been stripped  off\r\n\r\nthe canvas, what in fact are the realities that remain?\r\n\r\nWhat have these people done to deserve the sympathy for\r\n\r\nwhich he so eloquently appeals? What they have done  is\r\n\r\nto  associate  themselves with the  Communist  plot  to\r\n\r\noverthrow   democracy  in  Malaya,  which   means   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya and Singapore; what they have done\r\n\r\nis  to  show their disloyalty to the country  of  their\r\n\r\nbirth,  whether it be the Federation or  Singapore.  We\r\n\r\nare  asked to contemplate their plight in China, but  I\r\n\r\nsuggest, Sir, that that is a country in which they will\r\n\r\nbe   able   to   indulge   their   activities - Communist\r\n\r\nactivities in which they have been engaged - and a  place\r\n\r\nalso  where  they  will be able to see  to  what  those\r\n\r\nactivities lead. In short, Sir, I suggest to this House\r\n\r\nthat  neither  in  law nor in equity does  this  motion\r\n\r\ncarry  any  substance. On the contrary, in this  as  in\r\n\r\nother  measures  to combat the ever-present  threat  of\r\n\r\nsubversion, the Government has done no more and no less\r\n\r\nthan its duty by the people of this island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.11 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must tell the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown that I view with grave concern,\r\n\r\nand am profoundly disturbed by his action in having  so\r\n\r\nfoolishly   and  tactlessly  condemned  the  Federation\r\n\r\ncitizenship laws.

I thought that somehow  or  the\r\n\r\nother  I  must have missed some of them, and  that  he,\r\n\r\ndoubtless  having  better  legal  advisers   than   the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> rose -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> On a point of information, Sir.

However,  I  then  came   across   the\r\n\r\nConstitution of the Federation of Malaya which, for his\r\n\r\neasy  reference, is in the Library of this  Assembly - R. 342.595.  It  seems  that these  people  were  born  in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaya;  and according to this bit of legalese  in  the\r\n\r\nmotion:  \"depriving the aforesaid natural born  persons\r\n\r\nof  Malaya of their inalienable rights of citizenship\".\r\n\r\nI  went  diligently through this Constitution and  came\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nacross Article 16. The marginal note reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Citizenship by registration (persons born in the\r\n\r\nFederation before Merdeka Day).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,  we  have  not been given the ages  of  these  six\r\n\r\npersons,  but I presume that they must have  been  born\r\n\r\nbefore  Merdeka Day. I would therefore like to read  to\r\n\r\nthe House what Article 16 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Subject to Article 18, any person of or over the age\r\n\r\nof eighteen years who was born in the Federation before\r\n\r\nMerdeka Day is entitled, upon making application to the\r\n\r\nregistration authority, to be registered as  a  citizen\r\n\r\nif he satisfies that authority -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that he has resided in the Federation, during the\r\n\r\nseven years immediately preceding the date of the\r\n\r\napplication,   for  periods  amounting   in   the\r\n\r\naggregate to not less than five years;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that he intends to reside permanently therein;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) that he is of good character; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) except where the application is made within one\r\n\r\nyear after Merdeka Day, that he has an elementary\r\n\r\nknowledge of the Malay language.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  shall  not  harass  the Member for  Queenstown  with\r\n\r\nArticle 18, but this Article is the saving provision as\r\n\r\nto the procedure by which these things are done and the\r\n\r\nexceptions to the general rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I would like to draw the attention of\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the House to is this. There  were  70  odd\r\n\r\nbanishments, but the Member for Queenstown  has  chosen\r\n\r\nto  raise not the principle of banishment as such,  but\r\n\r\nthe  question  of  the right of these six  persons.  It\r\n\r\nmeans, in effect, a motion of censure on the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  Constitution because it has not  recognised\r\n\r\nthe  principle of jus soli. Sir, that is  a  matter  to\r\n\r\nwhich  I  think the Member for Queenstown may  want  to\r\n\r\napply  himself. I should think it is an extremely large\r\n\r\nand  profitable field and he would find a great  number\r\n\r\nof  supporters for the principle of jus soli. In  fact,\r\n\r\nit  is  one  of  the pivotal points of  the  Federation\r\n\r\nConstitution.  But  I  would  advise  Members  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly not to enter into the affray. This is a matter\r\n\r\non  which  we would be well advised not to express  any\r\n\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this categorically: that even on the present\r\n\r\nFederation Constitution, my party would be prepared, if\r\n\r\nwe  had any say in the fate of Singapore, to enter  the\r\n\r\nFederation as a member State, accepting the citizenship\r\n\r\nclauses and the Articles\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregarding the acquisition and the loss of citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Queenstown could find some\r\n\r\npolitician  in the Federation to take this  matter  up,\r\n\r\nthat  is  a matter for him to take up; but for  us  the\r\n\r\nmotion   really  means:  (1)  condemn  the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  not recognising the principle  of  jus\r\n\r\nsoli;  (2) condemn the Singapore Government for  having\r\n\r\nrefused to allow Singapore to become a place of  refuge\r\n\r\nfor  all those whom the Federation Government does  not\r\n\r\nwant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think those who had advised the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown on this matter must be fully aware that  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government is consulted on all  banishments\r\n\r\nof  persons born in the Federation. In fact, all  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  intimately associated with the  procedure  in\r\n\r\nthese  matters will know that they were, in fact,  sent\r\n\r\nback  to  the  Federation and boarded  a  ship  from  a\r\n\r\nFederation  port. And if the Federation does  not  want\r\n\r\nthem,  then  I suggest that it is not the  business  of\r\n\r\nthis   Assembly  to  embarrass  the  position   between\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation by bringing up motions  of\r\n\r\nthis  character.  The persons who advised - who  did  not\r\n\r\nadvise  the  Member  for Queenstown - to  bring  up  this\r\n\r\nmotion should think well before they do more damage  to\r\n\r\nthe  already strained and serious relationship  between\r\n\r\nthe two territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say flatly and categorically that from time to\r\n\r\ntime we will have to face stupid, irresponsible motions\r\n\r\nwhich would appeal to the emotions of people. Everybody\r\n\r\nfeels  sorry for these six persons and their  families;\r\n\r\nbut  I  would say I am more concerned - may  I  read  the\r\n\r\nterms  of  the motion, because I should like to  follow\r\n\r\nthe  words more closely - I express my grave concern and\r\n\r\nam profoundly disturbed by the action of the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown   in   having  done  something   which   has\r\n\r\naggravated  the  position, and further  I  deplore  and\r\n\r\nstrongly condemn those who have led him into this  ill-advised course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indeed not\r\n\r\nsurprised to see this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmotion  introduced  in this House  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown. It is a motion which shows disregard of the\r\n\r\nfacts  and  a  lamentable  ignorance  of  the  law   of\r\n\r\ncitizenship which was passed by this House  last  year.\r\n\r\nThe Government does not deny that it had knowledge that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertain  banishees had claimed birth in the Federation.\r\n\r\nBut  I  do  not  admit, and neither does the  Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizenship  law  concede, that  persons  born  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya possess in-alienable rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been pointed out by the Chief Secretary\r\n\r\nthat  before banishment proceedings were taken  against\r\n\r\nthese  persons, so honourably named by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown in his motion, the Federation Government was\r\n\r\nconsulted  and  the Federation Government  agreed  that\r\n\r\nbanishment proceedings should be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member for Queenstown asked me so many\r\n\r\nquestions and would have this House believe that he  is\r\n\r\nthe  champion of the poor people who were banished  and\r\n\r\nthose  who  were  left behind - the relatives  of  those\r\n\r\nbanished. I do not think, Sir, that the hon. Member can\r\n\r\nhonestly say that these \"near relatives\", as he  called\r\n\r\nthem - perhaps he was just reading a letter signed  \"near\r\n\r\nrelatives\"  because it did not mention any names -  that\r\n\r\nthese  near relatives did not go to his house time  and\r\n\r\nagain  to  beseech him to help. Sir, I had to meet  all\r\n\r\nthese  people  who came to the office by their  numbers\r\n\r\nwithout  appointment. They came to the Labour  Ministry\r\n\r\nwithout  appointment. They came to  my  house  at  all\r\n\r\nhours  of the day and night. In fact, they cried;  they\r\n\r\nwailed; they mourned;  so  much so that at times  passers-by  along\r\n\r\nSims  Avenue thought there must have been a bereavement\r\n\r\nin  my  family. I had to bear all that -  not  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown. To say that I cried is not  it.\r\n\r\nTo  say  that  I found it difficult to sleep  at  night\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  I  had  to do this is still  not  it.  I  went\r\n\r\nthrough hell. I literally went through that until I was\r\n\r\nsick; but because I know that I have a duty to per-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nform  to  the people of Singapore, I did not  shirk  my\r\n\r\nduty. The security of Singapore should come first,  and\r\n\r\nnot Lim Yew Hock, the Labour Front, or the Labour Front\r\n\r\nCoalition Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have in this Assembly heard too many times and\r\n\r\nmuch  too  often  criticisms from some Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition who are so irresponsible in their utterances\r\n\r\nthat  I  begin  to believe that they do not  understand\r\n\r\ntheir  responsibilities to their electorate and to  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  I  am indeed surprised to see in  the  motion\r\n\r\nthat  only seven names were mentioned, six of whom were\r\n\r\nrepresented by one legal adviser. May I tell him, if he\r\n\r\nfeels  that it would make his case stronger, that there\r\n\r\nwere  ten banishees who were born in the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya and who were banished not so long ago, and  that\r\n\r\ndespite  his  accusations and irresponsible  utterances\r\n\r\nhurled  at us, we will not be deterred? If the security\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  is at stake and if it is necessary  that\r\n\r\npeople  born  in  the Federation have  to  be  banished\r\n\r\nbecause of their subversive activities, this Government\r\n\r\nwill not shirk its duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.26 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee Choon Eng, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply I will\r\n\r\nfirst  deal  with  the Minister for Communications  and\r\n\r\nWorks. He tells us that the function of a government is\r\n\r\nto  maintain peace, and those who illegally  use  force\r\n\r\nwill have to be punished. I can agree with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who go against the laws of the Government must be\r\n\r\npunished.  The  Minister then  quotes  figures  of  the\r\n\r\nnumber of persons killed - Malays, Chinese, Eurasians and\r\n\r\nEuropeans.  Sir, my motion in fact does  not  say  that\r\n\r\nthey should not be detained or arrested or anything. It\r\n\r\nis   concerned  with  the  way  in  which  the  persons\r\n\r\nmentioned therein were deported. They were born in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaya  and  they  were deported to a foreign  country,\r\n\r\nChina.  My  motion  does not say  that  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould not punish such persons. If anybody transgresses\r\n\r\nthe  laws  of  the  Government, it is  right  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should punish such a wrongdoer by law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Chief Secretary, Sir, he, in\r\n\r\nconjunction with the Member for Tanjong Pagar, tries to\r\n\r\ninterpret  the  term \"Malaya\" in law. I have  no  legal\r\n\r\nbackground and I am not a lawyer. I bow to both of them\r\n\r\nwho have gone through a period of legal training. I got\r\n\r\nmy interpretation of the term \"Malaya\", which means the\r\n\r\nFederation   of   Malaya  and   Singapore,   from   the\r\n\r\nInterpretation  and General Clauses Ordinance  (Chapter\r\n\r\n2). As I have no legal background, I am not prepared to\r\n\r\nargue   this   with   them,  who  have.   Whether   the\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of  the term is what  it  says  in  the\r\n\r\nInterpretation and General Clauses Ordinance,  that  is\r\n\r\nup  to  the  Government  to say  so.  As  a  layman,  I\r\n\r\ninterpret the definition as I read it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar says that there were\r\n\r\nabout 70 banishees and it is rather surprising that  my\r\n\r\nmotion  only mentions 7 names. The Chief Minister  also\r\n\r\nsays  that  it  is rather surprising  that  I  am  only\r\n\r\ninterested in these 7 persons. In my opening  speech  I\r\n\r\nemphasised that I tabled this motion because  the  near\r\n\r\nrelatives  of these 7 persons approached me and,  as  a\r\n\r\nman serving the public, if representations are made  to\r\n\r\nme,  it is my duty, if I feel it is right, to represent\r\n\r\ntheir cases to this Assembly. If all the 70 persons had\r\n\r\napproached me, I would have done the same thing, if  my\r\n\r\nconscience says it is right to do so. So it  is  not  a\r\n\r\ncase of 7 or 70 persons at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister mentions that six of these persons\r\n\r\nwere  represented by a lawyer. Well, that is no concern\r\n\r\nof  mine.  What  I  am concerned is  this:  if  anybody\r\n\r\napproaches  me  to represent his case to this  Assembly\r\n\r\nand if I am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconvinced  that it is in the interests of the  public,\r\n\r\nI will do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar says that these people\r\n\r\nwere  sent to the Federation. With due respect  to  his\r\n\r\nlegal  qualifications and background, I wonder  why  he\r\n\r\nterms  it  that  they  were deported  or  sent  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  They  were  deported  to  China  via   the\r\n\r\nFederation.  I think that is the correct  term,  rather\r\n\r\nthan that they were deported to the Federation. If they\r\n\r\nwere  deported to the Federation, then,  as  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  says  that  he had consulted  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment,  it was up to the Federation Government  to\r\n\r\ndecide  whether  they were prepared to accept  them  or\r\n\r\nnot.  Deporting a person straight to China via a number\r\n\r\nof countries through which this person has to pass does\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily mean that he is deported to all  these\r\n\r\ncountries. I am quite sure that the boat which  brought\r\n\r\nthese persons mentioned in the motion to China did  not\r\n\r\ncall  at  a Federation port only. If the interpretation\r\n\r\nof  the Member for Tanjong Pagar is correct - that  these\r\n\r\npersons  were deported to the Federation - then  I  would\r\n\r\nsay  that they were not only deported to the Federation\r\n\r\nbut  deported also to the many countries at  which  the\r\n\r\nboat carrying them would call.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rather surprising that, as a legal man, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanjong Pagar has to use the words  that  I\r\n\r\nhave  used  in  my motion, and that is, \"I  express  my\r\n\r\ngrave concern and am profoundly disturbed by the action\r\n\r\nof  the  Member for Queenstown\". He has  been  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly for quite a long time, and if he really  feels\r\n\r\ngravely concerned and disturbed by my actions, I  would\r\n\r\ninvite  him  to  table a motion of this nature  to  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  rather than use the words of my  motion  and\r\n\r\nattack me. He has every right to move such a motion  as\r\n\r\na  Member of this Assembly. I will leave that to  him.\r\n\r\nHe knows better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\tQuestion put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Division, Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 3; Noes, 23;\r\n\r\nAbstention, Nil; Absent, 6.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n        Ayes.
