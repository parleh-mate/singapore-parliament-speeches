On 18th March 1993, I informed the House of certain remarks attributed to Mr Walter Woon relating to the proceedings of the Committee of Supply which were published in the Straits Times of 12th March 1993 and which I had considered inaccurate and serving to undermine the dignity of this House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also informed the House that, in a letter to me dated 17th March 1993, Mr Woon explained that he had been misconstrued by the Straits Times. He apologised for the wrong impression that might have been given and gave an assurance that he had no intention to trivialise the proceedings in the Committee of Supply. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 19th March 1993, the Straits Times published a letter by Mr Walter Woon under the heading \"Debating time too short to make point effectively\" in the Forum page. In his letter, Mr Woon repeats in substance the remarks which I had stated in my previous announcement on 18th March 1993 as inaccurate and serving to undermine the dignity of this House. In repeating his excuse for non-participation in the Committee of Supply, Mr Woon has indirectly trivialised the proceedings of the Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Woon's letter in the Straits Times of 19th March 1993 was the cause of grave concern to me as it appeared to be in conflict with his earlier letter of apology and assurances and shows a lack of contrition on his part. I consider Mr Woon's publication of his letter unnecessary and an act of discourtesy to the Speaker and, in the circumstance, I must record my displeasure with Mr Woon's conduct and attitude. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Mr Speaker, may I rise on a point of privilege? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am sorry, Mr Woon. It is not possible at this point of time for you to make any statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HDB UPGRADING SCHEME</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Priority in implementation)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. \n  <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether priority will be given to implement the upgrading scheme in Housing and Development Board estates which are 20 years old and above. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, priority is given to upgrading flats in estates which are 20 years and older. All the flats in the first batch of six precincts identified for the steady state phase of the Upgrading Programme are older than 20 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second batch of six precincts to be upgraded under the steady state phase will be announced soon. Similar to the first batch, the second batch of precincts is likely to comprise primarily flats that are older than 20 years of age. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While age of the flats is an important consideration, other factors such as the condition of the surrounding environment, and the need to maintain a geographical spread of precincts to be upgraded, are also taken into consideration in scheduling precincts for upgrading. Given the scale of the Upgrading Programme, and the limited capacity of the construction industry, it is simply not possible to upgrade all the flats in the older estates at one go. The Upgrading Programme has to be phased out over a number of years so as not to overstrain the construction industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr S.

Wong (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline K.

Our client learned of the details of the murder from his wife who had learned them from the Crime Watch programme of the offence.' The Crime Watch programme was telecast in June. One month later, in July, the wife supposedly told Samat of the details. She could remember all the details. Two months later, he was arrested. Three months after the Crime Watch programme, he was able to recount the details. This is the only thing that was said about the confession.

The deficit figures for HDB's Sale of Flats and Rental of Flats Activities are not strictly comparable as the loss per unit of flat sold is a one-off subsidy, while the operating deficit for rental flats is incurred annually. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY 91/92, HDB incurred a total deficit of $167 million for its Rental of Flats Activity. Of this $167 million, $110 million was due to the write-off of 148 blocks of rental flats demolished that year. HDB's operating deficit for its Rental of Flats Activity was thus $57 million. The average operating deficit HDB incurred for each unit of flat rented out in FY 91/92 was $747. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public rental rates for 1-room and 2-room flats are highly subsidised to keep housing costs within affordable range for the lower income groups. For this reason, HDB's public rental rates for the lower income groups have remained unchanged since 1979. Rental for a 1-room flat ranges from $22 to $33, while that for a 2-room flat ranges from $44 to $75. Public rental rates for 1-room and 2-room flats thus constitute less than 5% of the household incomes for the majority of existing rental tenants. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck:</b> Sir, thus the demolition of rental flats is not to be taken as a deficit or what you call a subsidy to rental apartments.

The land has appreciated in value and subsequently when new buildings are put up on the land, we take the market value and, in turn, we say it is subsidised housing to the new purchasers.

The intention in the accounting practice is that we return the land to the State and then the State sells back the land to HDB. HDB, as a developer, is no different from other developers, purchases the land at the then market rates and costs the sold flats accordingly. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Losses in car park operations)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. \n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for National Development why there were huge losses in the operation of Housing and Development Board car parks and how he plans to curb the losses without resorting to an increase in car park charges. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB has not been able to fully recover its costs for the provision of car parks, because past increases in car park charges could not keep pace with the increases in operating and construction costs for car parks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB is constantly looking at ways to increase efficiency in car park operations, through automation and better use of manpower to keep down costs. However, doing this alone will not be sufficient. It is necessary to increase car park charges gradually to cost-recovery levels, so as to reflect the true cost of providing car parks in HDB estates. My Ministry is, however, mindful of the impact of increases in car park charges on HDB residents, and will carefully examine the implications of any future revisions in the charges. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck:</b> Sir, I notice the loss incurred is, to a great extent, due to the interest charged.

What I mean is that the car parks to serve the housing units should be charged into the cost of the building as in the private estates. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, let me explain the situation in public housing which is slightly different from private housing. In private housing, the developer provides one car park lot per housing unit. In public housing, there is no reason for us to do so, because we have surveyed the car ownership patterns of HDB residents. As you know, in Singapore, the car ownership ratio is about 1:10. And since public housing caters to the lower income group, the car owning ratio, say, in the 3-room flats is one car in three families. If you were to build car park lots and charge the cost to every unit, then what you are saying is that the lower income groups who purchase flats will be subsidising those who own cars. That is not the intention of the Government. We separate the costing of the flats to reflect the true cost of providing housing to Singaporeans. We separately cost the car parks so that car owners will pay for the car parks provided to them. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>TRENDS AND CAUSES OF TEENAGE SUICIDES</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Details)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs if he will give details of the trends and causes of suicides and attempted suicides among teenagers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Dr Ong Chit Chung) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for suicides of teenagers \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> defined as 13-19 years old, the trend for the period 1990-1992 was roughly constant, with 14, 15 and 13 cases in 1990, 1991 and 1992 respectively.

Depending on a country's degree of self-sufficiency, reserves at these levels should be sufficient to act as a cushion against temporary dislocation in the country's economy. In the case of Singapore which imports all its energy and practically all its food, our level of reserves should clearly be around the upper bound of the 3-6 months' range and more, if possible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current official foreign reserve of more than $60 billion is equivalent to about seven months' imports. However, as a country without natural resources, our aim should be to accumulate, over time, as much reserves as we can afford to do so without over-taxing our people and without denying ourselves the expenditures necessary for economic growth. I should also point out that our existing absolute level of reserves cannot be allowed to remain static. It must increase in line with our GDP growth.

These are the Agricultural Pests Act, the Controlled Plants Act, and the Export of Plants (Control) Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Acts originated many years ago as Ordinances. The Agricultural Pests Act was enacted in 1918 and the other two Acts were enacted in the 1940s. Some of the provisions in these Acts are now obsolete. More importantly, these pieces of legislation, individually and as a whole, are limited in scope and inadequate in regulating the production, import and export of plants, especially fruits and vegetables. In particular, the Acts do not have provisions to control the import of fruits and vegetables to ensure that they are safe for consumption, or to regulate the use of pesticides in farming. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the use of chemicals and pesticides in agriculture has increased. Excessive levels of toxic chemical or pesticide residues in fresh fruits and vegetables pose a danger to the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> health of consumers. We import about 95% of our supply of fresh fruits and vegetables. To protect our consumers, we have to make sure that imported fresh fruits and vegetables do not contain excessive levels of harmful residues. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department, together with the Ministry of the Environment and other Government agencies, has put in place a comprehensive system of safeguards that help to ensure that fresh fruits and vegetables sold locally are safe for consumption. Some of the measures have been carried out administratively, or by using powers available under the Sale of Food Act and other public health legislation. It is now timely to introduce a new and comprehensive legislation to regulate the plant industry, to help ensure a safe supply of fresh fruits and vegetables. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Control of Plants Bill will consolidate, update and replace the three existing Acts regulating the plant industry. The Bill will also introduce new provisions to regulate the safe and wholesome import of fresh fruits and vegetables, control pesticide use in Singapore, authorise issue of plant health export certificates, and regulate the plant industry through licensing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill contains provisions to ensure that imported fresh fruits and vegetables are free from harmful levels of toxic chemical or pesticide residues, and are safe for public consumption. Under the Bill, it is an offence to import for sale or supply, fruits and vegetables that contain excessive levels of harmful residues. All imported consignments are required to bear identification marks so that the source of contaminated fruits and vegetables can be traced. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also contains provisions to control the use of pesticide in Singapore. This is to ensure that fresh fruits and vegetables produced locally are safe from pesticide residues. Under the Bill, only approved pesticides may be used in cultivation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides the Primary Production Department with the authority to issue phytosanitary certificates to certify that plants and plant products exported from Singapore are free from plant diseases and pests. These certificates will facilitate our export of plants and plant products. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will regulate the plant industry by licensing importers of fruits and vegetables as well as persons who cultivate plants commercially. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to new provisions to regulate the plant industry, the Bill also re-enacts, with some amendments, existing provisions to prevent the introduction and spread of agricultural pests and plant diseases, prohibit the cultivation of undesirable plants, and control the export of plants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interests of public health, it is timely for us to introduce the Control of Plants Bill.

The minimum retirement age will initially be set at 60 years of age. The Bill will also provide for the retirement age to be raised \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to 67 years in the future. It is the Government's intention to do so within the next seven to 10 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the retirement age issue has been widely publicised and discussed since 1988. I will now recapitulate the reasons for legislation to raise the existing retirement age norm of 55 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is confronted by two major population changes which would have severe impact on our long-term economic growth. These changes are an ageing population and the declining fertility rate. An ageing population will result in a situation where more and more workers would be leaving the workforce upon retirement. At the same time, a declining birth rate means that there will be fewer and fewer younger workers entering the labour market. This would result in a levelling of our labour force growth and, subsequently, a reduction in the size of our labour force. There would be serious repercussions on our economic potential and ability to compete in the world markets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present, eight working persons support one older person aged 60 and above. This ratio will fall to 4.4 to 1 by the year 2010, and to 3 to 1 by the year 2020. By the year 2030, 25% of the population will be aged 60 and above, compared to 9% today. This drastic change of population structure and its effect on the labour force cannot be ignored. We must tackle the problem now. To do nothing would severely affect our economic viability in 10 to 20 years' time. If Singaporeans continue to retire at age 55, when only three working persons are supporting one aged person, our economy cannot remain competitive and growth will certainly be retarded. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should also bear in mind that the average life expectancy of Singaporeans has gone up from 68 years in 1970 to 76 years today. So if a person retires at age 55, he can expect 21 years of life as a retiree living entirely off his CPF savings. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a waste of valuable human resource if Singapore workers retire at age 55, when they are still healthy and full of vigour. It would be ironical and would not make economic sense at all for Singaporeans to retire at 55 while increasing numbers of foreign workers are allowed into Singapore to make up for the manpower shortfall. A sensible and practical solution must be to encourage Singaporeans to stay economically active and to continue to work beyond the current retirement norm of 55 years. By doing so, workers will earn income to supplement their accumulated CPF savings and to put aside more savings in their Medisave accounts to meet the high cost of medical care in old age. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, had in 1988, set a three-year time frame to allow employers to voluntarily raise the retirement age to 60 years. The National Trade Unions Congress and the Singapore National Employers' Federation gave their strong support to this voluntary effort. A survey covering 12,681 companies with at least 10 employees, conducted by my Ministry in early 1992, showed that 72% of the 1,041 unionised companies had raised the retirement age to 60 and above. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the response from the non-unionised companies has been unsatisfactory. Only 4.5% of the non-unionised companies supported the move to raise the retirement age. Employers in the non-unionised sectors have generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude and continued with the current practice of retiring workers at age 55. Sir, as the non-unionised sector is in fact much larger than the unionised sector, overall, only 10% of the companies surveyed have raised the retirement age to 60 voluntarily. And this was achieved after three years of exhortation, persuasion and determined negotiation by trade unionists. The Government, therefore, has little choice but to introduce legislation to raise the retirement age. We cannot wait or delay any further while the population age and our economic competitors overtake us. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the developed countries such as Germany, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Sweden, Netherlands and Italy, the retirement age norm is generally 65 years. For some countries such as Norway and Denmark, the norm is even higher, at 67 years. In the United States, mandatory retirement age has been prohibited since 1986. In other words, US employers cannot terminate the service of employees on account of age, regardless of how old the employee is. Even in the Asian NIEs, workers are now working well beyond 60 years. For example, the retirement age norm in Taiwan is now 65. Within ASEAN, the Philippines also has 65 years as the retirement age norm. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a country with a small population competing against the Asian NIEs and, increasingly, even against the developed countries, we should also aim to raise the retirement age norm to comparable levels. Lagging behind these countries would greatly limit our capacity to compete effectively for high value-added and high-technology investments, especially in the areas of experienced and skilled manpower. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to help employers adjust to the eventual higher retirement age of 67 years, the Government will raise the minimum retirement age in steps after the retirement age of 60 years has been implemented. I envisage a move to 64 years in four to five years' time, with the final change to 67 years in seven to 10 years' time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill's principal objective, the minimum retirement age of 60 years, will apply to all Singaporean workers, including those in the managerial, professional and executive positions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now highlight the main features of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill provides for minimum retirement age of 60 and prohibits employers from dismissing employees on account of their age. There is also a provision for the Minister to further raise the retirement age up to 67 years in the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 provides that any provisions in the employment contracts or collective agreements which provide for a lower retirement age would be void. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 restricts the employees from contracting out of the Bill. So, employers and employees cannot mutually agree on a lower retirement age. This means that employers cannot ask employees to accept contracts of service which spell out a retirement age below that provided by law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 empowers the Minister to exempt any employees or classes of employees from the Bill with or without conditions. The Minister may also revoke such exemptions, vary or revoke any existing conditions or impose new ones. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in drafting the Bill, my Ministry has consulted extensively with the employers' and workers' representatives. Employers had expressed concern that the proposed law would introduce rigidities into the labour market by compelling employers to retain all their employees to age 60, regardless of the nature of their work. Clause 10 will allow such concerns to be addressed. Employers will be able to seek exemption from the Ministry for workers who are involved in jobs which are not suitable for persons older than 55 years. Where there is sufficient justification, the Minister will be able to grant such exemption. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mechanism for implementation and enforcement of the Bill is provided in clauses 3, 7, 8, 9 and 11. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides for the appointment of investigating officers to implement and enforce the provisions of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 allows aggrieved employees who have been unlawfully dismissed on account of age to appeal to the Minister. An employee who considers himself to be wrongfully dismissed may, within one month of the dismissal, make representation in writing to the Minister to be reinstated in his former employment. If the Minister is satisfied that the employee has indeed been wrongfully dismissed on \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> account of age, the Minister can either order the employer to reinstate or to compensate the employee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this appeal procedure is similar to existing appeal procedures for wrongful dismissal provided in the Employment Act and the Industrial Relations Act which was introduced in 1968. The procedure has stood the test of time and has worked well for us. It also allows the aggrieved employee to pursue his complaint without having to incur substantial legal costs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, though the Bill will give workers the right to work up to 60 years and beyond, I wish to stress that employers' right to terminate employees' service on grounds of poor performance or ill-health, or to dismiss employees on ground of misconduct, would not be abrogated. These are established rights of the employers. It is not the Government's intention to compel all employers to keep poor performers or ill-disciplined employees. It is important that we continue to maintain a disciplined and productive workforce. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, employers have also voiced their concerns that this law would result in higher labour costs since the current wage scales are still very much seniority-based. They are also concerned that having a higher percentage of older workers will result in higher cost in terms of medical expenses and longer annual leave entitlements, among other cost factors. They have therefore been reluctant to employ workers beyond the current retirement age as they fear doing so could affect their cost competitiveness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address such concerns, the Government has decided to lower the employers' CPF contribution rate for employees from age 55 to 60 years by 5 percentage points. This will come from the employers' contribution. The total contribution rate for this group of employees would accordingly be adjusted from 25% to 20%. The CPF adjustment to reduce the cost burden of employers will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> help them to remain or to become even more competitive and, at the same time, enhance the job security of older workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the adjustment to CPF contribution rate for older workers \ufffd this 5% reduction on employers' contribution for their older workers \ufffd would not affect their retirement income, housing and medical needs. In particular, it would not affect the Medisave needs of older workers because they would be able to continue to contribute to Medisave at the established rates. Projections of CPF balances at age 60 show that, apart from providing for the average worker's housing and medical needs, his CPF balance, after the 5% reduction, would still be sufficient to provide him with a monthly annuity which ranges between 20% and 40% of his last take-home pay. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, the additional five working years will ensure that an older person will continue to have a regular income and CPF contributions to boost up his CPF and Medisave savings. By the time he retires at 60 years or older, when we change the minimum retirement age in future, the worker will have more retirement funds to see him through his old age. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge employers not to treat this 5% CPF adjustment as a windfall gain. With increasing numbers of older workers continuing to work up to 60 years and beyond, employers must invest more in training and upgrading the skills of older workers. Such training investments will become more and more important as companies move up the technology and value-added ladder. Many of today's older workers are also generally lower educated and less skilled. Hence, employers should not view the 5% CPF savings as purely an incentive for them to retain older workers. They should make use of this 5% saving to meet the additional cost of skills upgrading and re-training for older workers and, where unavoidable, to prepare older workers for redeployment within the company. The CPF adjustment should, therefore, benefit both the employers and the employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the raising of the retirement age would not affect the existing CPF withdrawal age which will still remain at 55. Although Singapore workers can continue to withdraw their CPF savings at age 55, I would like to urge all workers to continue working up to the age of 60 and beyond. It is in their own interest as well as in the nation's interest that they continue to work as long as they are able and in good health. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>1.32 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee (Boon Lay):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to speak in support of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labour movement has been pressing for the raising of retirement age for a number of years. The question of whether legislation should be introduced to regulate retirement age has also been debated in recent years with the employers' federation and the trade unions holding rather different views. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989, the Government gave employers a three-year grace period to voluntarily raise the retirement age of their employees. This deadline has come and passed but the progress made, particularly in the non-unionised sector, has been disappointing. While the majority of the unionised companies have raised their retirement age to above 55 years, only 4.5% of non-unionised companies have done so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when retirement at 55 years was the norm in the 1950s, life expectancy of Singaporeans then was below 65 years. Today, the life expectancy has gone up to over 75 years but, unfortunately, many Singaporeans are still forced to retire at an early age of 55 years. The Singapore workforce is aging while the economy is increasingly constrained by a shortage of labour. It is ironical that experienced and skilled Singaporeans are forced to retire at 55 years when most of them are still healthy and fit. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore welcome the Government's decision to introduce legislation to raise the retirement age to 60 years and eventually to 67 years. Why 67 years and not 68 years or 70 years is something which I suppose only the Minister can answer. But I would say that the plan to raise the retirement age progressively by legislation is a step in the right direction. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make some comments on the specific provisions of the Bill. I believe the Bill covers all full-time employees. What about temporary workers and those regular part-time workers who work for less than eight hours a day? I know of employers who employ temporary workers more or less on a permanent basis. There are also workers who are employed to work for four or five hours a day instead of the normal eight hours. And these employees are actually permanent workers but the employers choose to call them either temporary workers or part-time workers so that they can exercise their discretion in hiring and firing easily. Should these workers not be covered under the Bill? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern also applies to workers who are employed on fixed-term contracts. I would like the Minister to clarify the question of people who are employed on fixed-term contracts. In fact, I would like to caution against the possible abuse by employers who may resort to employing workers on a contract basis even though their need for employees is for the long term. In other words, the employers may just keep on renewing the fixed-term contracts instead of placing them on permanent employment. And we can end up with employees being employed permanently on fixed-term contracts and are not covered under the retirement age legislation. So there must be a way to check the employers from getting round the legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 10 of the Bill provides for exemption from the Bill. This means that a company can apply for some of their employees to be exempted from the Bill. I urge the Minister to be cautious in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> granting such exemptions. If the exemption is granted too liberally, it will defeat the purpose of this Bill. Whether we like it or not, there are still some deep-rooted beliefs of prejudice against the older workers that they are not capable of performing certain duties well. I believe we should not be bound by the conventional notion or prejudice. I suggest that the Ministry scrutinise every application for exemption stringently. I would also like to seek the Minister's assurance that the Labour Ministry would seek the union's views before granting any exemption. In other words, do not just listen to the employer's side of the story, but get the views of the union and employees as well. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Ministry is considering the suggestion to exclude seamen from the proposed legislation. I would like to urge the Minister to consider the decision carefully. Although many of the seamen are employed on fixed-term contracts, there is a sizeable number of gradings and officers who are employed on a permanent basis similar to that of the shore-based workers. Some of the collective agreements signed between the employers and the unions have already provided for retirement age of up to 60 years. Exclusion of the seamen categorically from the proposed legislation will be a retrogressive step. There are adequate provisions in the proposed legislation to exclude those seamen who are employed on fixed-term contracts. There is, therefore, no necessity to single out the seamen for total exclusion from the Bill which will only jeopardise the jobs of those who are employed on a permanent basis. I would appreciate the Minister's clarification of his position on this matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7(3)(b) allows the Minister to order compensation to employees who are unlawfully dismissed by their employers. If the intention of the Bill is to extend employment to 60 years and beyond, then ordering compensation will not achieve the objective. The worker will still be out of a job. I would like to ask that, as far as possible, the Minister should \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> order reinstatement rather than compensation. Some companies may not mind paying compensation to get rid of their older workers, especially if they find it cheaper in the long run. Should compensation be ordered as a last resort, the amount should be large enough to serve as a deterrent. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some companies pay employees a gratuity when they retire. Some also offer early retirement benefits which allow employees to collect a gratuity when they retire early for whatever reason. With the new legislation, it is feared that the workers may now be deprived of such gratuities if they retire before 60 years. I seek the Minister's assurance that existing gratuity schemes be allowed to continue so that no employees will lose out when the law comes into effect. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the question of CPF. The Minister has announced that the employers' CPF contribution rate will be further reduced by 5% for those aged between 55 years and 60 years. I would like to ask the Minister whether he would consider reducing the employers' and employees' contribution rates by an equal amount instead of reducing only the employers' contribution rate. So instead of reducing 5% from the employers' contribution rate, why not reduce 2.5% each from the employers' and the employees' contribution rates. I would appreciate it if the Minister would consider this suggestion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, I rise to support this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the life expectancy of our citizens now at 75-76 years, it is important that we address positively ways to encourage our workers, who are fit and healthy, to continue to work for as long as possible. Hence, I welcome the provisions in the Bill, firstly, to raise the minimum retirement age of employees to 60 years or such other age up to 67 years as may be prescribed by the Minister and, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> secondly, to prohibit employers from dismissing employees below 60 years of age or the prescribed retirement age on the ground of age. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Minister has stated, adequate notice has been given to the employers to prepare for the raising of the retirement age to 60 years. They have been given about four years to make the necessary adjustments on a voluntary basis. Even though the progress was good in the public sector and the unionised sector, the figures given by the Minister show that progress in the non-unionised sector was sluggish. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to maintain the retirement age at 55 years is a waste of valuable human resources given the tight labour market today. Further, with the aging population, it is imperative that we do all we can to motivate our older workers to remain in the workforce. The proportion of our population above the age of 55 years is projected to increase to 15% by the year 2000. If the retirement age is continued to be held at 55 years, our dependency ratio, that is, the average number of dependants per working person, is estimated to increase from about 0.6 now to 1.3 by the year 2030. However, if the retirement age is raised to 65 years, the dependency ratio will only be 0.8. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a high dependency ratio will bring with it grave social and economic problems. I would, therefore, like to stress that we must create a work environment that will help and motivate more older workers to remain in employment as long as possible if they are fit and healthy. We must, therefore, move towards a retirement age of 67 years quickly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will provide a legal basis for employees to remain in the workforce up to 60 years and beyond. We have now to work on proposals to enable the provisions to be brought into effect at a cost which the economy can bear. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has announced that the current CPF contribution rates for workers between 55 years and 60 years will be \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> further adjusted, namely, by a reduction of 5% of employers' contribution. Sir, I suggest that we consider this proposal in a very cautious way. Despite what the Minister has said that the new rates will be sufficient to meet workers' needs for Medisave and housing, I think we really have to take a look to ensure that workers will have enough savings in their Medisave account to cater adequately for their medical and hospitalisation needs when they grow older and more prone to illness. As it is, their Medisave contribution rate will be raised from 7% to 8% by 1st July this year. Secondly, many workers in the age group of 55-60 years are still servicing their housing loans with their CPF. We must make sure that they would not have problems here. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers have pointed out that employees aged 55 years and above have already lower CPF contribution rates. Hence, they have asked: why is there a need to reduce the rates further? I would like to ask the Minister to consider the proposal again and see whether there is a real need to reduce the CPF contribution rates of workers above 55 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the area which we should focus on is the education, skills training and upgrading of our workers. More needs to be done by the Government and the employers to help particularly the older workers to go for education and skills upgrading. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the paper on the \"Implementation of the Strategic Economic Plan\" on page 100 of the Economic Survey of Singapore 1992, it is stressed that in the long run, the \"capability\" factors which include such areas as the quality and skills of the workforce and productivity are more crucial than business costs to Singapore's competitive position in the global economy. Table 1 of this paper on page 102 of the Economic Survey of Singapore 1992 gives an inter-country comparison of the educational profile of the workforce. Only 22% of our workforce have educational levels of post-secondary and university compared to 40% for Taiwan \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and Hong Kong, and 50% for South Korea. Sir, with your permission, may I ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute a Table which I have prepared. This is a Table on educational qualifications of employed persons, 15 years and over, taken from the Labour Force Survey 1992. [Copies of Table distributed to hon. Members.] \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the data on the highest educational qualifications of employed persons aged 15 years and over in the Labour Force Survey 1992, about 720,000 of the 1.57 million persons employed, ie, 46% have education at the primary/lower secondary level and below only. Many of them are in the age group of 20-49 years. In fact, if you look at the Table, for the employed persons in the age group 20-29, 29,000 have not attended school/lower primary school and another 137,000 had only primary/lower secondary education. Sir, all these workers will continue to be in the workforce for many years. They have to ensure, therefore, that their educational and skill levels will be continuously upgraded during the course of their working life. If you want them to be in the workforce for a long time, ie, up to 67 years, then we must encourage them to look into their education and skill upgrading. Government, employers and unions can work together on this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the contribution and productivity of the older workers can be raised if we have schemes which can motivate them to improve their educational and skill levels on a continuous basis throughout their working life. With their experience and wisdom, they can make an effective contribution to enable their companies to be competitive and successful. We must pay them fairly and equitably according to their contribution, performance and productivity. Age is then a secondary factor. With education and skills and a keen desire to improve quality and productivity, they can be paid good salaries which both their companies and the economy can bear without any adverse effect on our competitiveness. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are several reasons why this Bill is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> necessary. We have heard very cogent reasons put forward by the Minister for Labour as well as the two speakers before me. Like them, firstly, I would like to consider the demographic changes and shifts which necessitate this Bill. Like them, I also subscribe to the economic importance for having this Bill. But I would like to add that to retire a man at 55 today when he can live to 75 and beyond will be to condemn him to 20 years of fallow during which both his body and his mind decline. I regard this as wasteful and unacceptable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the compulsory retirement age of 55 is a legacy which was handed down to us from past administrations, and it is a peculiar mindset which dictates that a man's productive economic life and usefulness ends and goes out together with the candles on his 55th birthday cake. Today, he is an asset, but tomorrow once past 55 he becomes a liability. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Economic Survey of Singapore 1992 has shown that 98-99% of Singaporeans above the age of 55 years are still economically active. In the 55-59 age group, 54,000 out of 54,800 or 98.5% remain so. And for those above 60, the figures are 52,000 out of 52,500 or 99%. In other words, the majority of Singaporeans are still employable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Retirement Age Bill will provide for those who wish to remain employed beyond 55 years of age. But, Sir, taking a cow to water does not necessarily mean that the animal would drink. We have seen how this is with the female participation rate in the workforce. Despite incentives like enhanced child relief, double child relief and the foreign maid levy deductions, the female participation rate in the labour force still remains disappointingly low. The labour force participation figures have also been low for those aged 55-64. From 35.6% in 1988, it only rose marginally to 38.8% in 1991. Older Singaporeans will therefore have to be persuaded to remain in the workforce. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Although they are economically active, many do not want to prolong their working life as employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several reasons for this. Firstly, the attraction of being able to withdraw their entire CPF savings minus the minimum sum. This has dissuaded many workers to continue to be employed. A Singaporean earning $1,000-$1,500 per month for 10 years prior to retirement can accumulate a CPF saving of between $50,000 and $70,000, sufficient capital for a start in some small joint venture business. A solution to this would be to withhold the CPF withdrawal to 60 years of age. But I am not suggesting this because it will be a political decision with dire consequences. But what I would like to propose is that we do away with the employees' contribution altogether for those who are 55 years of age and above. Mr Goh Chee Wee has suggested that we give a half and half deduction of the 5% when this law is enacted. I do not see the rationale behind allowing a person to withdraw all his CPF on the one hand and requiring him to put in more money on the other, except perhaps when there is some topping-up to be done. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, I have alluded to the present retirement age as a mindset. This is an attitudinal position to which we should see a change. In some ways, the Government, or rather the PAP, is partly responsible for the perpetuation of this mindset. In election after election, the PAP has only fielded young candidates in their early 30s or early 40s. It is common knowledge that those above 50 are given less than a cursory glint. I am sure there must be some people who are 50 and above who are able and willing to serve when called upon to do so. We have seen how elderly men in their 60s and 70s in other countries, in China and the United States, for example, not only take on public office for the first time but continue to provide the leadership. At home, we have excellent examples in Senior Minister Lee who continues to dazzle the world with his statesmanship, Finance Minister, Dr Richard Hu, who took office \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> only after his retirement from Shell and recently labelled as one of the three best Finance Ministers in the world; and former Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Dr Goh Keng Swee, whose economic expertise is much sought after by many countries. The PAP can set an example and help to change this mindset by putting up some mature candidates in the next general elections. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, is the employers' concern. When this Bill was first tabled, some have expressed worry about increasing costs and various problems. One is the lobby for CPF to be reduced. I was initially behind the labour movement in asking that CPF paid by employers should not be reduced. And I am pleasantly surprised that the Minister has announced a cut of 5% instead. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other concerns, however, are more genuine. And this is the rising cost of maintaining the workers' health, especially now when tax deductible expenditure on health has been kept at 2% of the total payroll. Advancing age is when catastrophic illnesses like cancer strike. It is also the time when sequelae of chronic illnesses like diabetes and hypertension surface. Even minor ailments become more common. Cost sharing and health insurance may be the answers to these problems, but the premiums can be expected to be high. And cost sharing requires the unions' sanction. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern of the employers is that the continued presence of older workers may not be well received by the younger colleagues, especially when the older workers' productivity falls and there is resistance to retraining and upgrading of skills. Some younger workers aspiring to rise in the company's corporate ladder may also view the older ones as obstacles to their progress. Companies, too, may be less ready to invest time, money and effort in upgrading the skills and retraining the older workers whose life span with the company is limited. It is like investing in a short-lease property. It is in these areas that unions can do much by \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> persuading the older members to participate in skills upgrading programmes. They can also help to enlighten their members on the necessity for some seemingly painful and restrictive policies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC has already called on the Minister for consultations before the exemptions provided for in clause 10 of this Bill are made. The clause does not specify the type of workers to be included. Presumably, these are in the traditional uniformed services and occupations such as sea-faring, commercial aviation and highrise construction where physical demands are great, and anything less than 100% fitness may be a source of danger, not only to the worker himself but to others. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to focus on some specifics in the Bill. Clause 4(1) states that the retirement age of an employee shall not be less than 60 years or such other age, up to 67 years. Initially, I thought the figure \"67\" was a typographical error. But, like Mr Goh Chee Wee, I think the Minister owes us an explanation on why \"67\", and not 68 or 66. Clause 5 states that a contract of service or collective agreement made before the commencement of this Act shall be void to the extent that it is so less favourable. Sir, to set the precedence of making an Act retroactive is undesirable. Some personnel managers I have discussed this Bill with have already found a way of circumventing this clause and clause 6 by suggesting to their workers who reach the age of 55 years of age that they resign with the full retirement benefits, like gratuities, thus making it not less favourable than after the enactment of this Bill. Mr Goh should rest assured that the workers who choose to retire or resign earlier would not be disadvantaged. Sir, all this is happening even before the Bill has been taken through its Second Reading. Whilst it is premature to ask the Minister at this stage, I would like to enquire of him for an indication as to what this Bill would cost the Government when it is applied to the private sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Umar Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Umar Abdul Hamid (Ang Mo Kio GRC)</b>(\n  <i>In Malay</i>): Being a country without natural resources, Singapore depends a lot on the labour and skills of its workers. Every working citizen is a gain to our economic system. So the contributions of workers within a certain period of time inevitably influence our growth and economic stability. The Retirement Age Bill, which seeks to raise the minimum age of retirement from 55 to 60 and thereafter to 67, is most welcome. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, considering our practice of meritocracy, it is no surprise that our workers have become so used and immune to hard work and industry. They are conscious that only through diligence and effort can they ensure the comfort and future of their children. When a person retires at 55 not for any reason of health, he would tend to grow restless and bored staying at home without a permanent job. This state of boredom is understandable and can be explained on two grounds. Firstly, he is used to working, having done so for at least 30 years. Secondly, he is used to being independent, earning his own income every month. With growing awareness of the importance of maintaining good health, many workers in the country are able to carry on working even when they reach 55. This Bill will meet the needs of this group of people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Singapore Yearbook of Statistics 1991 and the weekly news magazine Asiaweek, the life expectancy of Singaporeans is estimated at 74 years. In view of this, if we fix the retirement age at 55, we will have to ask ourselves what the retiree is going to do for the next 20 years. 20 years is a long time for one to spend life in idle pursuits, at home or anywhere else, when one could still be productive. If the United States, where life expectancy is 75 years, has a law enabling retirement age at 65, there is no strong reason for Singapore not to have the same. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent workers from continuing to work after 55 is to bring social problems. Most workers who are 55 and above have \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> children who are already working and have their own families. If these workers are able to support themselves, we will be able to avoid one growing problem - that of children neglecting their parents. Not everyone among the younger generation is willing to provide their retired parents constant support and company. The trend today shows many aged couples living alone while their children attend to their own families and their own life. In this era of constant competition, practices such as this, that go against noble values like showing gratefulness to one's parents, are gaining ground among the younger generation. This is an undeniable fact, and the solution will take time. So the possibility of carrying on working depending on one's ability will in some way help the aged to continue to fill their time in a useful and gainful way. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the skills which the worker has acquired during his working years can be put to good use. He may be 55, but in terms of skills and experience, younger workers may find him hard to match. The aged can also help to fill up shortages where they arise. For example, when the services of teachers are badly needed now, we can cope with the problem as we seek a long-term solution by extending the services of those teachers who wish to continue working after 55. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not agree with the suggestion by Dr Toh that workers be allowed to withdraw their CPF only at 60. May I urge the Minister to continue allowing workers to withdraw their CPF at 55. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> I rise to support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has a tight labour market and yet the retirement age is 55 years. In many developed countries, the retirement age is 65 or 70, depending on the occupation. A difference of 10 to 15 years in the period of employment is equivalent to about 33-50% of the active adult working life of someone who starts work at the age of 25 years and retires at 55 years. Therefore, Sir, increasing the retirement age from 55 \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to 65 years can prolong the working life of most people by about one-third. This will be an economic boon to labour scarce Singapore. However, so far, only 5-10% of non-unionised companies have voluntarily embraced the scheme to set the retirement age at 60. Therefore, we have to ask ourselves two important questions: (1) Will the Retirement Age Bill be effective in carrying out its objective? (2) How can we ensure that employers will retain their older workers? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at three possible situations when an employer can ask an employee to cease employment. (1) Termination of fixed term contract. (2) Employee with contract but has been given agreed period of notice. No reason need be given. (3) Employee with no contract but where reasonable period of notice is given. Also, no reason need be given. In these three situations, the Retirement Age Bill can be by-passed as many employees have no long-term tenure in employment. How can the Bill overcome this problem of common law termination of employment? Why are employers not keen on retaining their older workers? I think the Minister has alluded to this, that is, in a tight labour market like Singapore the employers tend to practise the seniority-based wage system to retain their workers. However, this makes older workers less attractive to the employer as it costs more to retain such workers. To offset this higher cost to the employer, the Minister has announced a 5% reduction of the employers' portion of the CPF. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there can be some further incentives. Another incentive that can be offered is to do with medical bills. For employees over the age of 55, the medical cost goes up. For this category of workers, the 2% of the payroll allowable for medical expenses should be raised to 4%. A third incentive for firms that retain older workers after the age of 55 could be a higher ratio of foreign workers allowed to the firm. The Retirement Age Bill will only be effective if some incentives are given in tandem to the employer who retains older workers beyond the age of 55 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Otherwise, the employers will not find the exercise cost effective and will find means to avoid retaining workers after the age of 55 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, it is my understanding that the purpose of this Bill is to compulsorily force employers to raise the retirement age of their employees and to protect the older workers from being dismissed on the ground of age. With rising life expectancy, we should encourage healthy older workers to remain on their job as they would contribute to our national economy. I therefore support the spirit of this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Minister says that after the Bill has been in force, the withdrawal age of CPF will remain unchanged, it is my hope that the Minister can categorically assure this House that in future the withdrawal age of CPF will not be raised to 60 or even 67 for one reason or another. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister the following questions: First, for workers above 55 and who continue to work, can they withdraw the accumulated CPF at any time as they so please? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, clause 5 of the Bill says that after the Act has come into effect, those employment contracts with the retirement age stipulated at 55 will become null and void. What about those civil servants who are supposed to retire at 55 to enjoy their pension? Will they be compelled to retire at 60? For example, some contract employees of the Ministry of Defence are supposed to enjoy certain gratuities upon the expiry of their contract. What will be their position? What kind of impact will the Bill have on these people? What about other contract workers? Will they suffer any losses because of this Bill? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, clause 7(1) states that if any employee thinks that he has been dismissed because of age, he can appeal to the Minister for reinstatement. Mr Speaker, Sir, under our Employment Act, any employee, irrespective of the contribution he has made, so long as the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> employer gives him one month's notice or gives him one month's pay in lieu, he can be dismissed. If an employer takes such an action when the employee reaches the age of 55, then what can the Ministry of Labour do to prove that he has been dismissed because of age? How is the Minister going to reconcile the inconsistency between the Employment Act and the present Bill? \n  <br>2.16 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Tampines GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my cautious support to this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Retirement Age Bill is a landmark legislation. It has tremendous impact on all employees. Presently, only employees earning $1,500 a month and below are protected under the Employment Act. But this present Bill, as we have here today, will cover all working people in Singapore. Although I am in support of moving up the retirement age, I think in resource-scarce and manpower-scarce Singapore, we have got to be careful in the implementation of this Bill. Therefore, I would like to urge the Minister to consider very carefully caution in two aspects. One is making void all collective agreements. This takes away the right of all individuals and companies to enter into contracts of employment. Up to now, it is only proper that we protect employees earning below $1,500 a month. But with this present Bill, which will become an Act if passed, it will protect an employee, whether he earns $1,000 or $10,000 a month. That takes away a great deal of responsibility from companies. There are many cases in which a contract of service for a fixed term is desirable and yet, under this present Bill, it is no more allowed. I believe even the Government service, especially the Ministry of Defence, has also a number of term contracts. I wonder whether the Minister will make them void or they will be exempted from the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think there are many instances where one may have an overseas project and a person is employed for a fixed term \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> at $3,000 a month. It is more than adequate that he knows what he is entering into. He has entered into a contract of employment with a company for a fixed term. These employees need not be protected. But under the present Bill, it protects everyone. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area of concern is that anyone who has been dismissed now, irrespective of his level of income or seniority in the company, can claim under clause 7, that he has been retired because of age. Again, this is a very dangerous precedent. I do not know what is the Ministry's procedure in handling such employees. Presently, those who are employed and paid a salary of $1,500 a month or below are covered by the Employment Act. There are established procedures which are followed, in which employees and employers know their rights. But with the Retirement Age Bill coming into force, the process is not very clear. A senior executive who earns a high salary can also claim that he has been asked to leave the company on account of age. Will there be a deluge or a great number of such complaints to the Labour Ministry? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present retirement age of 55 covering employees who are earning above $1,500 makes the system very flexible. With the change to the retirement age at 60 years, the rights are taken away from the company and the employee. It will be very difficult for companies to remove an executive or senior manager who has reached the age of 55 and who may not be very competent or diligent in his job. He will just sit for the next five years on the job, because the present Bill mandates that he be given a job until age 60. These are two serious areas of concern which I want the Minister to have a look and, as far as possible, be more flexible in the implementation of this particular Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tong Kok Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tong Kok Yeo (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indeed pleased that after a long wait of three years or thereabouts, Government has taken action to legislate the retirement age to 60. This will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> not be necessary if a good majority of employers have taken heed of the Government's call made three years ago. I would have thought that in a labour shortage situation, employers would find it imperative to tap this source of labour supply, namely, those aged 55 and above, instead of retiring them at the conventional age of 55. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned by the Minister, with each passing year, there will be more and more older workers. They are expected to live longer in view of the increasing health consciousness of the population. As such, this Bill will ensure that such workers will continue to be gainfully employed and provide for a new source of labour supply which will help, overall, in deflating the increasing dependence on foreign workers. Therefore, workers, employers and the Government will benefit from the introduction of this Bill. Nevertheless, I would like to comment on two clauses of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 provides remedies for unlawful dismissal on the ground of age. Mr Speaker, Sir, the concern is that employers may disguise such dismissal as something else by invoking section 10 of the Employment Act. Then what happens? In unionised companies, I am sure the trade unions will police and monitor that it will never be allowed to happen. However, my main concern is for those non-bargainable workers and those workers who are not allowed to join unions by virtue of the nature of their employment. Should such actions by employers befall upon them, it may go undetected. Though the Bill provides for representations in writing to the Minister within one month of the dismissal, such workers, after being subjected to the trauma of being dismissed or terminated at a senior age, may find it undignified and not worth their while to do so, or they may lack the understanding of the intricacies of the law or the provisions of the Act to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases of such nature, it is indeed a mammoth and difficult task to establish that the employer's actions run foul of the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> law. As such, I would like to ask the Minister how his Ministry is going to monitor and ensure that such situations will not happen. I would like to suggest that employers be made to notify the Ministry when terminating or dismissing such workers, who are above the age of 55, for whatever reasons, perhaps for an initial period of three years upon the implementation of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 allows the Minister to exempt with or without conditions any person or class of persons from all or any of the provisions of the Act. To ensure that any exemption will not have any detrimental effect or impact, I support the call made by Mr Goh Chee Wee that the views of the trade unions be sought prior to granting any exemption by the Minister. I believe this will not be a problem as the Ministry had in the past sought the views of the trade union concerned in granting applications for exemptions by employers, for example, in the limit of overtime work monthly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1986, the National Wages Council called for the implementation of the flexible wage system. In 1988 and 1989, it urged companies to raise the retirement age from 55 years to 60 or more. Under the flexible wage system, workers are rewarded according to the productivity and company's profitability. Therefore, companies which adopted the flexible wage system will not discriminate against older workers or put them at a disadvantage, as they are paid according to their productivity. Adoption of the flexible wage system would therefore render the issue of retirement age irrelevant. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has informed the House in a previous sitting that in the unionised sector, more than 80% of companies have implemented some form of flexible wage system. In the non-unionised sector, the extent of implementation has reached 70%. Therefore, unless the adoption of the flexible wage system has taken a turn for the worse, I cannot reconcile the announcement made by the Minister that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the legislation of the retirement age to 60 will be accompanied in tandem with the reduction of CPF contribution rates for those aged 55 and above. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the unionised companies have already raised their retirement age to 60 without the need for legislation and without the need for a cut in CPF rates. So, who are we punishing, so to speak? I believe it is the unions and employers of those unionised companies who have responded positively and responsibly to the Government's call. Contrary to what many may think, workers who are 55 to 60 years of age do still have their housing loans to service, they do still have schooling children to support, and they do still need CPF for their old age. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, while I support the Bill, I have my reservation with regard to the need to reduce the CPF contribution rate in tandem with the raising of retirement age, because a good majority of companies have already adopted the mechanism of the flexible wage system to address the concern regarding the higher cost of employing older workers. Such a reduction in CPF contribution rate seems to indicate that the objectives of the flexible wage system so strongly advocated during the recession years have not been achieved. Nevertheless, I would like to suggest that the reduction of the CPF contribution rates be reduced incrementally over a few years. After all, the restoration of the CPF rates for those below 55 years was done in that manner. Just as the Government has come up with a final CPF contribution rate of 20% each for both employer and employee, perhaps the Government needs to do the same for the CPF contribution rates for workers aged 55 and above. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr K. Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr K. Shanmugam (Sembawang GRC):</b> Sir, this Bill seeks to provide a minimum retirement age and the operative provision is clause 4(2), which prevents an employer from terminating the employment of an employee under 60 on the ground of age. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister to note that while clause 4(2) refers to dismissal, nevertheless, reading that with clause 2, subclause (2), the term \"dismissal\" would also cover normal termination of contract, even when the contract allows termination without giving any reasons after giving a certain period of notice. What we have is a fairly serious inroad into the principles that employers are free to employ workers on such terms as they wish, subject to the Employment Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This inroad raises two questions. It has been explained on two grounds. First, the need to utilise fully our economic potential; and secondly, the lack of voluntary action on the part of employers to raise the retirement age. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I subscribe fully to the aims. However, let me strike a discordant note from the previous debate by asking two questions. First, do the reasons given justify making the inroad? And secondly, at a practical level, can the legislation, in fact, be enforced? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the first question, on a philosophical level, we have always emphasised the supremacy of market forces. The law of supply and demand should ensure that in a tight labour situation, employers are unlikely to terminate the employment of a healthy trained worker who has just passed 55. The Minister has referred to statistics which show that only 4.5% of the non-unionised companies have voluntarily raised the retirement age very reluctantly. I am not sure what the statistics in fact show. Perhaps it may be no more than that, in reply to a question, employers are not willing to say that they are legally obliged to raise the retirement age. But, in practice, as I said, in a tight labour situation, they may, in fact, be more than willing to employ employees who are past 55. In any event, if employers choose not to do so, generally it is their choice. The employers risk their capital to obtain profit and it is for the employer to decide how best to go about getting that profit. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is generally not for the Government to direct the employers on (1) who the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> employer should employ; (2) how old or what race should the employee be; or (3) what the employee's skills should be. This makes sense because, as I said, it is the employer, and not the Government, which is doing business. And that free environment encourages business by imposing few restrictions and, ultimately, benefit the employees. It is, therefore, generally in the employee's best interest for the full interplay of market forces to operate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exception to that rule should only be made if two conditions are satisfied. First, there is a serious social problem to be tackled, for example, the employment of child labour. Because child labour cannot be tolerated on the principle of free market. There is also a need to ensure that the basic human dignity and safety are not endangered simply based on the free market principles. That is why we have the Employment Act. Second, in addition, before the Government intervenes, it must make sure that it can, in fact, enforce the legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the first ground, I have already said a few words. I am not sure that the grounds that the Minister had advanced, in my view, justify forcing employers, at the threat of a $5,000 fine or a jail sentence for six months, to increase the retirement age. We go back to the free market principles. What is in the employee's best interest? To let the employers decide for themselves and allow free market forces to operate, or for the Government to direct the employer-employee relationship? Secondly, at the enforcement level, at the practical level. When it comes to enforcement, this legislation, in some ways, is an employer's nightmare and a lawyer's dream. It will, in my view, open up endless possibilities of conflict whenever the employment of a person aged between 55 years and 60 years is terminated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister may be aware that there is such a concept known as constructive dismissal in law. Whenever an employer moves an employee to a lower-paying job, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> or to a job with lower responsibilities, the employee could argue that, in fact, he has been dismissed from his employment. Thus, every time an employee who is within 55 years and 60 years is moved to a job with lesser responsibilities or a lower-paying job, he will consider making a complaint under clause 7 of the Bill. The Minister and his investigating officers will then have their hands full checking on (1) the reasons for every termination of employment of an employee who is just under 60 years and (2) the reasons for the reduction of salary or reduction of responsibilities of an employee just under 60 years. I am not sure that an inquiry will come up with anything substantial. The possibilities of a very large number of complaints cannot be underestimated because it costs an employee absolutely nothing to make a complaint. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also any number of loopholes that have been mentioned earlier, for example, the employment of temporary workers or renewable contracts which are simply not renewed. What this legislation really does is to place a powerful psychological weapon in the hands of the employees. I have listened to the reasons given and the Minister has referred to a number of countries where the retirement age has been raised. He referred to the United States, Italy, Germany and various continental countries. I would say that all countries which have attempted to regulate in great detail the relationship between employer and employee have perhaps succeeded in raising the cost of doing business. On the other hand, he has referred to the NIEs. The Minister referred to the norm in Taiwan. I notice the careful usage of the word \"norm\" which means that there is no legislation, I assume, in Taiwan. The only other example is the Philippines which I am not sure is the best example under the circumstances. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to be misunderstood as being against employers voluntarily raising the retirement age of the employees. I am all for utilising our economic potential to the fullest and I am encouraging, with whatever means \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> possible, inducing and creating the right environment for employers to continue to employ workers who are past 55. In any event, I believe in the free market, and if there is a need, I believe employers would continue to employ. So I say that, ultimately, the question is whether the employers should be forced to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other social issue which the Minister may wish to take into account is that perhaps persons above the age of 45 years, but below the age of 55 years, who lose their jobs will become almost unemployable because very few employers may wish to take the risk of employing someone they know that they would have limited rights to fire such a person after the age of 55 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that the Minister may wish to take into account is that, generally, we have created a social climate where our employees accept that it is in their best interests to have as few restrictions on business as possible. It is in everybody's best interest and given that our unions have accepted that, given that our workers have accepted that, before we move away from that principle, I would advise caution. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I share Mr Shanmugam's misgivings about the efficacy of this Bill. The Minister has already stated very cogently the reasons behind the Bill and I think we can fully accept his reasons. My misgivings centre on whether or not we can actually, as a practical matter, raise the retirement age by way of legislation. The problem is that what we are doing here is making a fundamental change to the employer-employee relationship. The key provision, as Mr Shanmugan has pointed out, is clause 4(2) which states that \"no employer shall dismiss on the ground of age any employee who is below 60 years of age or the prescribed retirement age.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, as long as you give your employees adequate notice, a prescribed \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> notice on his contract of service, you have to give him no reason. But now you cannot dismiss him on the ground of age. I welcome the Minister's statement that the law is not designed to ensure that people are employed for life irregardless. You can still dismiss a person for misconduct, you can still dismiss a person for incompetence, you can still dismiss a person because he is not contributing. Given this fact that you can still dismiss people for these reasons, it takes no great amount of wit for an employer who is determined to circumvent the law to find a reason to terminate an employee's service which is not connected with his age. So there is this wide open possibility of circumvention. What is the solution to that? Is the solution to that to build a super structure of rules to regulate what reasons are acceptable and what reasons are not? Because if we start going down that slippery slope, we will soon find ourselves enmeshed in a web of rules about who can be dismissed, when they can be dismissed, for what reasons they can be dismissed, and I am not sure that will be for our long-term interest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So while the principle of the Bill is certainly laudable, I think we should have no illusions as to whether or not a determined employer can actually be forced to keep on employees past up to the retirement age that the Minister is seeking. The employer right now does not have to give a reason. Does this Bill require employers now to justify the dismissal of employees? Because if it does, again, we are talking about a very serious change. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 4(3), it is made an offence to dismiss someone on the ground of age. But if the employer is not forced to give a reason, the burden of proof, in the normal way, will be on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the dismissal was on the ground of age. We should be very careful about criminalising behaviour, making crimes of things, unless we are very certain that this is necessary. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 7, the Minister has said that we have conciliation and I fully support that. The only way to make this Bill work is to use conciliation rather than prosecution. When a complaint is made to the Minister, he puts in an investigating officer. The investigating officer is not bound by the normal rules of law, or the rules of evidence, or the rules of procedure and he might be able to come to a more realistic appraisal of the situation. Once you start having prosecutions, you have procedural problems and you have evidentiary problems. The courts already have got a lot of cases, departmental summonses of all kinds, and I think we should be very careful about adding to their burden. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only sure way that you can keep your job until retirement, or beyond retirement, is to make yourself useful to your employer. It is, as Mr Shanmugam said, primarily an economic thing. The other way that people can protect themselves is to join a responsible union. To expect this law to change the attitudes, to change fundamentally the relationship between the employer and the employee may be a bit unrealistic. It is open to lots of circumvention. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is with these very deep misgivings that I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join in the debate. I declare my interest as an employer and I would like to speak first on the employer's behalf. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers do have feelings. Employers should not be seen as cold-blooded monsters. So employers do see loyalty and experience of their employees. And I think there is no problem of employers keeping their employees beyond 55, 60, or 65 years. The point is whether they are contributing and they will continue to be productive. So, basically, we have two groups of workers here. Those that can actually look after themselves by continuously upgrading themselves, especially those on the executive and managerial levels. This group of people need not worry as they can take care of themselves, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> so no legislation is needed. But it is the other group, ie, the less qualified, that was put up by the unionist Member, that is a problem. And I think DPM BG Lee did say about the problems of our seniority wage system where a new company and a 10-year old company doing the same business will find that the new company is in a better position. The old clerk cannot do the word processor and things like this. There is a problem in the total system. Employers actually look at the competitive environment, look at the total package and stay competitive. This is what the employers are looking at. Because at the end of the day, if simply legislating and extending the retirement age means that the company can no longer be competitive, then it may just close shop. It is not just the few jobs that it is protecting, but the total number of jobs that we are losing that is of concern. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I am sad to see good bodies laying to waste at the HDB void decks playing chess. In fact, the Minister for Health did say at the last sitting that Singaporeans can expect to live up to 80 years old. So from 60 years to 80 years, you are talking about a good 20 years. And I share the sentiments of the unionist MP that it is the training part. If we make them to continue to be useful economically, I think people will want to keep them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister why then raise the retirement age progressively from 60 years to 67 years. Why not, at one go, raise it to 65 years, and why the magic figure of 67 years? Probably, to avoid misunderstanding, the exemption categories could be spelt out from day one, that is, which categories would stay put at 55 years, 60 years and so on. Those jobs which require more physical work and less marginal skills, are the jobs that are at stake but not those skilful jobs. The Bill actually benefits the individuals as they now have the right, especially those with marginal skills, to continue to work as their self-ego and self-esteem will continue to be there and they will have a continuous income, as the Minister has \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> said. The employers actually also benefit under this tight labour situation where you have a lot of workers who may just wish to retire at 55 years and they are there to work and to continue to serve them. The Government will benefit as less of them will go to the Government for welfare. There is an economic contribution and they can contribute more to our reserves. So, overall, the whole of Singapore will benefit if the legislation is implementable and fair. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is this cost-sharing and the Minister has announced that because of costs, employers want the CPF to be reduced and the Minister has announced a 5% reduction. The question is: is it fair to the individual? To those who are not contributing, of course, it is fair; those who have no skill at all and are costing the company that much money. But to those who are actually contributing and are useful to the company, then it may not be fair to these workers. But I suppose there should be a compromise, so that employers benefit from those who are contributing and carry those who are not contributing. And the 5% reduction, as I see, is fair. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then the question is: what about the Government? There is a price to pay here. The individual pays a price. The employers pay a price. What about the Government, other than just issuing notices and sending the errant employers to jail? Could the Government actually do more to show its sincerity of wanting workers to continue to work beyond 55 by, as suggested earlier, allowing higher medical expenditure for companies? What about lower income taxes? What about a medical allowance of $2,000-$3,000 for the older workers? What about the topping-up scheme where the Government is generous in giving $200 for the purchase of shares? What about giving a couple of hundred dollars, as surpluses permit, to these older workers and paid into their Medisave accounts? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are things that we like to see the Government playing its part other than just legislating. A higher interest rate could be given for CPF accounts, for instance. What about discounts in public health costs, discounts in public transport and so on and so forth? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the Bill cautiously, because the employers' worry is, as Mr Chng said, on contract employment. They may engage a consultant for a period of two years or engage a designer for all he is worth for 2-3 years. Will that right be taken away from the employers? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Of the 11 Members who spoke, I think all of them, in principle, support the move towards a higher retirement age. They all support the need to get more Singaporeans who are now retiring at age 55 to continue working because of the need for the economy to stay competitive in view of the tight labour market. Members have raised quite a number of questions. I will attempt to go through them and answer the points that were raised. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin with the question raised by Mr Goh Chee Wee, Chairman of the GPC for Labour. Mr Goh asked whether part-time workers and temporary workers would be covered under the new minimum age requirement because he is concerned that some employers may try to go around the law by converting permanent full-time employees to part-time employees. The way we look at \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> it, Sir, is that part-time employees who are working on a regular basis will also be covered by the Retirement Age Bill. The intention is to cover all workers, including part-time workers. Since part-time workers are going to be covered, it will be less likely that employers would find it attractive to try to circumvent the law by just converting their workers from full-time employees to part-time employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to temporary or casual workers, it is not necessary to cover them under the law, as the nature of work for the casual workers is often of a short-term or irregular basis. This will allow some flexibility to employers who may need to employ casual workers for short periods, for example, during festive seasons where demand is high for a particular service. I believe that this approach will help people who need such casual jobs to supplement their income. It will also help people who are prepared to spend part of their spare time on a casual job to make extra income. If even such casual workers are included, ie, covered by the retirement age law, then I think our labour market will become much less flexible and adaptable. This is not in the interest of both employees and employers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh is concerned about the possibility of abuse by employers using fixed term contracts as a means of dismissing or terminating the service of the employee before the age of 60. Sir, it is the intention of the Ministry to exempt workers who are on fixed term contracts. The reason is to provide flexibility to employers who may need to employ workers for a specific project. In the event that an employee complains to the Ministry, after the law has come into force, that his employer has in fact abused the fixed term contract mechanism to retire him before the minimum retirement age, then the onus will be on the employer to justify to the Ministry that in fact the employee who is on such a fixed term contract is only required for a specific project. This would mean that an employer would not be able to continually renew short fixed term \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> contracts and when the employee reaches 55 years of age he just refuses to renew such contracts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, at the investigation stage, the Ministry officials will be able to determine that the employee carries on doing the work although he is on a short-term contract and that even after the contract is renewed, he still carries on doing the same kind of work. So there is no justification for him to actually be employed on a fixed term contract. We can then conclude that the fixed term contract is a disguised means to circumvent the requirement of the retirement age law. So, in fact, only genuine fixed term contracts will be exempted. Employers who intend to circumvent the law by putting their permanent employees on a renewable fixed term contract without sufficient justification will eventually have to face the consequence for violating the law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh asked whether the Ministry will consult the union before it decides on the employers' application for exemption for certain categories of workers from the minimum retirement age requirement. Let me assure Mr Goh that the Government's objective is to encourage all Singaporeans to continue working for as long as possible. It is the Government's objective to do so. Hence, exemption from the retirement age law will not be granted liberally. It is meant to provide flexibility for a certain kind of work which may not be suitable for older workers, or for a certain kind of jobs which are linked to a specific project. In deciding on the merit of each case, the Ministry will consult the unions concerned as and when the need arises, and where the exemption could affect the collective agreement between the union and the employers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh also asked whether seamen as a group ought to be completely exempted from the provision of the law. Some seamen are on permanent employment, others are on short-term voyage-based contracts with particular employers. In the case of those who are on permanent employment, it is not the Ministry's \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> intention to exempt them. In other words, seamen who have permanent employment with the employers will be covered under the minimum retirement age law. However, those who are on a short-term employment, where they are employed for a particular voyage of certain vessels, they will be exempted. They will be treated like those who are on term contracts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh also asked whether reinstatement is workable because it is provided in the Bill that the Minister may order reinstatement of an employee who has been considered to have been dismissed on account of age. In considering the type of compensation which could include just payment to the employee who has been dismissed, the Minister will have to consider whether reinstatement is in fact viable. If the relationship between the employee and employer has not deteriorated to the level where they can no longer work together, then reinstatement will be considered. But in cases where the relationship has completely broken down, you cannot compel unwilling parties to continue to work together. Under such circumstances, it is more likely that the Minister will order a cash compensation to the dismissed employee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh asked whether the Minister will confirm that the CPF withdrawal age will remain at 55. Let me assure him that it is the intention to retain the present CPF withdrawal age at 55. All workers who attain the age of 55 will be allowed to withdraw their accumulated CPF savings. I believe the Member for Hougang, Mr Low Thia Khiang, also raised the same point. So let me assure him that those who have reached the age of 55 can continue to withdraw their accumulated CPF savings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there could have been a slight misunderstanding earlier on, because some Members have asked where the 5% CPF reduction will come from. I said earlier in my Second Reading speech that the 5% reduction in CPF contribution rate \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> will come from the employers' contribution. In other words, the proposal is for the CPF contribution rate for workers aged 55-60 to be 12 1/2% from the employee and 7 1/2% from the employer, making up a total of 20%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Othman has spoken up in support of the Bill. He emphasised the importance of training of workers, particularly older workers. I agree entirely with him that older workers need additional support from their employers in order to get some skill upgrading and retraining, so that they can carry on working after the age of 60. That is why in my Second Reading speech I urged employers to treat the 5% CPF saving as additional resources for them to provide training and skill upgrading for their older workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also concerned whether, with the reduction in CPF, it will in fact affect the older workers adversely. As I said in my Second Reading speech, the projection of CPF balance for workers up to the age of 60, with the 5% reduction in the employers' contribution, shows that there will be no serious adverse impact on workers for their housing, old age retirement income and also their Medisave requirements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, with five more working years, a worker should be able to put aside a lot more money into his CPF account. And when he retires at age 60, he will be in a much better position than if he were to retire at age 55. So notwithstanding the 5% CPF reduction, he will be better-off. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh has supported the Bill. He proposed that the CPF withdrawal age be deferred to 60. He knows the consequences of doing so. I have all along been assuring all the workers that the Government intends to retain the present withdrawal age and there is no intention, in fact, of changing the withdrawal age at this juncture. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat</b> rose ---. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do you want to give way to Dr Toh, Dr Lee? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang</b> resumed his seat. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just make a point of clarification? I said that I am not suggesting that the withdrawal age for CPF be increased to 60 years because it will be a political decision of dire consequences. In fact, I want it to be retained at 55. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, I may have misunderstood Dr Toh. On the other hand, he proposed that we do away with employees' contribution altogether, am I right? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat:</b> Yes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> That would not be a viable alternative to what we are proposing now, which is a 5% cut on the part of the employers' contribution rate. The reason is that doing away with the employees' contribution does nothing to minimise cost. It does nothing to help employers shoulder the burden of an increasingly aged working population. While it will of course increase the workers' take-home pay, it does not make retaining older workers more attractive. So I am not in favour of reducing the employees' CPF contribution rate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh also suggested that the PAP signals its support for older workers by fielding more older election candidates. I do not know how that has been linked with retirement age. But let me reassure Dr Toh that it is not true that the PAP only fields young candidates. He himself mentioned Dr Richard Hu. He stood as a candidate in the 1984 general elections, and has gone on to become one of the most notable Finance Ministers. He was way over, I think, 55 when he stood for election. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PAP fields candidates for election based on their ability to contribute to the political process. It cannot be that the candidates are fielded just because they belong to a certain age group. I think that would not do our political system much good. But where we come across or where we can persuade people who are in the older age group, and who are able to contribute \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to the political process and offer leadership capability, then I am sure that the PAP will consider such candidates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh and, I believe, a few other Members have also asked whether the provision under clause 10 for the Minister to exempt certain classes of workers will be made known. Yes, the intention is to gazette an exemption list when the Retirement Age Bill comes into force. I think the categories of workers that we have considered for exemption could include some of these employees who are in positions or employment approved by the Minister or such other persons appointed by him where being of a particular age or in a particular age group is a job requirement, for the reason of safety or for any other reason. So employers will have to apply to the Minister for such exemption. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other categories of workers to be exempted are those employees who have entered into a fixed term contract of service. As I have mentioned earlier on, we intend to exempt this group of employees to ensure that the labour market remains flexible and adaptable. We will also be exempting persons whose employment is of a casual nature, as I mentioned earlier on. We will also exempt all foreign workers in Singapore who are here on either work permit or employment pass. They will be exempted. Because it is not the intention of the Government to ensure that all foreign workers get a job in Singapore up to the ripe old age of 60. They are here for a short term. When they have finished their short employment in Singapore, be it two years, four years or six years, they must go back. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some examples. Other examples of exemptions are students working on a part-time basis. As you know, during vacation, many students take on part-time employment. It is not the intention of the law to include such student workers under the provision for minimum retirement age. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh questioned the need for clause 5 which invalidates any term of contract of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> service which is less favourable than that prescribed under the Retirement Age Bill, and whether or not it is back-dating the provisions of the Retirement Age Bill. Let me assure him that this is necessary in order to protect existing workers who may well have entered into contracts previously where the retirement age norm is 55. It is also not a new principle in law to have such provisions to nullify contracts made previously. If the Member looks at section 8 of the Employment Act, he will find a provision which is very much similar to what is provided for under this Retirement Age Bill. Otherwise, a large number of workers who are presently working will not be able to enjoy the benefit of working to age 60, because they all have entered into contracts of service, whether written or verbal, where the retirement age norm is 55. So it would then take a very, very long time for the retirement age of 60 to become a norm, a practice, if we do not make all previous contracts void. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh also asked how much it will cost the Government to implement the Bill. It will cost the Government some money in order to set up the infrastructure that is necessary to investigate and to conciliate whenever complaints of retirement or unfair dismissal on account of age is brought to the Ministry's attention. But, as of this moment, I am not able to tell him exactly how much that would cost. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Umar, who also spoke up in support of the Bill, sought reassurance that workers will be able to withdraw their CPF savings at the age of 55. I have already given that assurance earlier on. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Soin, together with several other Members, including Mr Shanmugam and Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon, questioned the feasibility of implementing this law in view of the fact that employers today can terminate a worker's service, whether it is on a fixed term contract, or they can terminate the service by giving due notice, and, in some cases, even without giving due notice. While it may appear a little \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> difficult, my Ministry has, in fact, been regularly handling such complaints about termination of services. We will be able to treat such complaints of termination on account of age, as we have been treating various complaints brought to our attention for wrongful dismissal. Under section 14, subsection 2(a) of the Employment Act, employees, who make complaints that they have been wrongfully dismissed or unjustly dismissed by their employers, will give their reasons for thinking that it is unjust. My Ministry, on receipt of such a complaint, will call up the employer and seek explanation from the employer. And it is really up to the employers then to explain why the termination of service under the Employment Act is justified and it is within their right to give notice or even terminate the service of a particular employee without notice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in effect, employers must defend their action to terminate the service of an employee once a complaint has been registered. Otherwise, we will infer that the employee, whose service has been terminated, is right in assuming that he was unjustly or wrongfully dismissed and we will make the appropriate recommendation. Although it may appear a little difficult, my Ministry has been dealing with such cases and we should be able to continue to conciliate and adjudicate when complaints are brought to our attention about wrongful dismissal or dismissal on account of age. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Members' information, let me give some statistics. Last year, my Ministry received a total of 2,785 complaints concerning claims relating to terms and conditions of services. Out of 2,785, 601 cases were complaints of unfair termination of service by employers. We also received a total of 33 cases from employees who accused their employers of wrongful dismissal. We have, in all of these cases, been able to resolve the disputes either through a process of conciliation or adjudication. So the procedure is quite established. As I have said in my Second Reading speech, it is quite well tested over the years as we \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> have been using such procedure. And I think termination on account of age will be another aspect of the application of this conciliation and adjudication procedure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang also supports the Bill. He wants a reassurance that the CPF withdrawal age will not be changed. I have already given that reassurance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about civil servants and officers in the SAF who have the option of retiring at an earlier age. The intention is to exempt certain categories of civil servants including officers of the SAF, and Police officers, from the coverage of the Retirement Age Bill. Because for their specialised vocation, it is not feasible to require that they work up to the age of 60. One can well imagine that for Police officers, Army officers or Army specialists, it would be very difficult to carry out some of the duties if they have to work up to the age of 60. So the intention is to exempt certain categories of civil servants and SAF officers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also raised the question of the appeal procedure, which I have explained earlier on, and how my Ministry will go about handling complaints from employees who have been dismissed on account of age. Mr Chng Hee Kok has essentially raised the same concern that there will be difficulty. He expects there will be difficulty in handling complaints from employees who have been dismissed on account of age. As I have explained to Members earlier on, the Ministry has a fairly well-tested and established procedure to deal with such complaints concerning terms of employment and service and also wrongful dismissal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that it might be difficult, with the new legislation, for companies to remove their senior managers, because, in the past, they could just dismiss them. Now, there is this possibility that they might be asked to explain whether it is a dismissal on account of age. I think what is required now would be for all companies to ensure that they have a proper appraisal system for all their staff. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> And if they do have a proper appraisal system for their staff to assess their performance, then should they need to terminate the service of such senior management staff, it will be easier to put up a case that, in fact, they are terminating a person on account of his lack of performance, rather than on account of age. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Tong Kok Yeo suggested that all employers who want to terminate the services of their employees at age 55 or thereabouts should notify the Ministry. I do not think, at this juncture, it is necessary to call for such notification. it could become a bureaucratic bottleneck to require such notification. But my Ministry will be monitoring the situation once the law comes into force and is implemented, and if, in fact, there is widespread abuse, we may consider alternatives to monitor the situation which could include compulsory notification. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also suggested that the Ministry consult the unions when we are considering exemption for certain classes of workers. As I have explained in my response to Mr Goh earlier on, we will consult as and when the need arises. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tong Kok Yeo also felt that with the flexible wage scheme being implemented since 1986, there should not be any need to reduce the CPF contribution rate of the employers on account of their older employees. Unfortunately, the flexible wage scheme has not worked to the extent to remove the additional cost for retaining workers. Even after six years of attempting to implement the flexible wage scheme, as a general rule of thumb, older workers are still being paid two to three times more than younger workers. So it is not as if the flexible wage scheme has already removed this wage gap between young and older workers. Therefore, we recognise that as the proportion of older workers increases in the workforce, employers could well have to bear a higher cost and this could affect their competitiveness. And in order to ensure that we do not unnecessarily dull their competitive edge, we have sought to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> reduce their CPF for older workers by 5%. Let me assure the Member that, as I said earlier on, the 5% reduction should not affect the older workers by way of their housing needs, retirement income or Medisave. Even with the 5% reduction, they will still be able to set aside eight percentage points for contribution to their Medisave account. In fact, by having another five more years of working life, of course, the worker will put aside much more money, particularly in his Medisave, to meet future medical expenses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tong also suggested that we consider incremental reductions of the CPF rate instead of a one-off reduction by five percentage points. We have already waited for four years for this higher retirement age to be implemented widely. But sad to say, it has not come about that way. We now want to make sure that we do not waste any more time and the way to do so would be to give employers sufficient incentives quickly so that they will comply with the principle and the objective of the law to retain all their older workers when they reach the age of 55 years, rather than to adjust the CPF rate incrementally which could well mean that it may take a longer time for this principle of retiring at 60 years to be widely accepted by both the employers and the employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that I have addressed the concerns raised by Mr Shanmugam and Assoc. Prof. Woon on the difficulty of implementing the law. While I cannot go into the specifics of how we will adjudicate, or how we will investigate each and every case of a complaint for wrongful dismissal on account of age, let me assure him that I am quite confident that the procedures that have already been practised by the Ministry of Labour are sufficiently effective as to make a distinction between a genuine termination and a termination on account of age but disguised as some other form of termination. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia suggested that those categories of workers who are exempted from the coverage of the Retirement Age Bill should be spelt out clearly. I have, earlier on, listed some of those categories of workers who will be exempted. A more comprehensive list will be issued by way of a Gazette Notification. He also asked the Government to indicate its stronger support of older workers by a wide variety of measures, including tax reduction, medical allowance and CPF topping-up scheme for senior citizens. While all this may help to signal support, what is crucial is that we take a decision now to raise the retirement age and, as and when the Government is doing well, topping-up can be considered. As we have discussed during the Committee of Supply stage, CPF topping-up will, in fact, be practised by the Government. But whether we need to make a discrimination between older and younger citizens when we do a topping-up, that is something to be considered separately. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe I have addressed most of the concerns raised by Members. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a question I raised in my speech which the Minister has not answered. Can I repeat my question? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> How will civil servants, for example, teachers, who are presently under the pension scheme, be affected by the Bill? Does it mean that they can only enjoy their pension at the age of 60 years or older rather than at the age of 55 years? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, I did answer that question just now. I said that the intention is to exempt certain categories of civil servants, including those who have the option to retire at an early stage and to collect certain pension benefits at an earlier age. We intend to exempt this group of civil servants just as we intend to exempt a small number of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> employees in the private sector who also have such retirement benefits pegged to 55 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are aware that a group of employees, particularly in the oil industry, who have contracts of service with their companies whereby they stand to gain certain benefits when they reach the age of 55 years. It is not the intention to overrule the provision of all these pension benefits. We will exempt these current workers who are benefitting from this scheme but we will require the companies, when they employ new workers, to ensure that the retirement age for their pension benefits will be pegged to 60 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has not answered my specific proposal on whether he will consider reducing the employers' and employees' CPF contribution rates by 2 1/2% each side instead of a 5% reduction. The long-term CPF contribution rate is 20% from the employer and 20% from the employee. Currently, for those people who are aged 55 years to 60 years, the contribution rate is 12 1/2% on each side. So with the proposal, this should be reduced to 7 1/2%. For workers who are below 55 years, the employers' contribution rate is 20% but the moment they reach 55 years, this would be reduced from 20% to 7 1/2%. To me, this is too drastic a cut. As my colleague, Mr Tong Kok Yeo has said, even right now, in the unionised companies, many employers are actually extending the retirement age to 60 years without the benefit of a further CPF reduction. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not objecting to the reduction in CPF for the older workers because their saving needs are less but I question the need to make such a steep cut. In fact, I prefer a gradual approach and, hence, my proposal to reduce 2 1/2% on each side instead of a 5% reduction from employers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I see that there is a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> continuing interest in this item and I also note that there are amendments to be made by a Member on this item.

We will come back tomorrow for the remaining items. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item under discussion and on items 3 and 4 on the Order Paper today be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item under discussion and on items 3 and 4 on the Order Paper today be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>RETIREMENT AGE BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in my response to Dr Toh who suggested doing away with the employees' CPF contribution entirely when they reach the age of 55 years, I have explained why it would not help in the effort to get employers to retain older workers because cutting the employees' CPF contribution rate will not reduce the cost factor. While it will increase the employee's take-home pay, it will not reduce the employer's cost burden. Hence, when we were studying this issue of how to encourage more employers to retain their older workers, we felt that the 5% reduction on the part of the employers' CPF contribution rate will be worthwhile. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we could do it gradually or not, I have already explained earlier on that it will take a longer time and we have already waited for four years for companies to raise their retirement age voluntarily. If we wait for another four \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> years, we will have missed the opportunity to employ so many more older Singaporeans or keep them economically active. And I think we should not dilly-dally over this matter. We have given four years of notice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it that we are now reducing the employers' CPF contribution while quite a number of unionised workers, in particular, are already enjoying a retirement age of 60 years without having to pay the price of a CPF reduction? We move to get all employers to raise their retirement age because it is a matter of national interest. While 10% of the companies have voluntarily raised their retirement age to 60 years, only a very small proportion of the total workforce is, in fact, enjoying this higher retirement age. Yes, they are all in the unionised sector. The intention here is to get all the rest outside the unionised sector, which forms the vast majority of our workforce, to also enjoy the benefits of working up to 60 years and to do so, a CPF reduction would expedite the move. That is why we are moving to cut the employers' CPF contribution rate by 5%. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has not answered the concern which I raised and that is the right of individuals and companies to enter into contract, especially the highly-paid staff. By making all term contracts, or contracts of a fixed number of years or term, void it means you are taking away the right of contract and some of these highly-paid staff may be required for a specific purpose. Under the present Bill, it makes the law very rigid and there is no room for employees who are very capable of taking care of themselves to enter into such contracts. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I think there is a misunderstanding here. It is not the intention of this Bill to make all fixed-term contracts void. On the contrary, it is my Ministry's intention to exempt all fixed-term contracts from the coverage of the Bill provided when there is a complaint \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> about a wrongful dismissal, the employer can justify that the fixed-term contract is linked to a particular project and, therefore, it is a valid term contract. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat:</b> Sir, when I proposed that we do away with the employees' CPF contribution after attaining the age of 55 years, it was not as a measure of cost-cutting but more to try and rationalise an action. Here we have, on the one hand, a worker who is allowed to withdraw all his CPF but, on the other hand, he has to make back monthly contribution. I do not see the rationale behind this action. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, the rationale is quite simple. As long as a person is able to work, he should set aside some of his income to cater for the day when he is unable to work. The fact that he has been given permission to withdraw his savings at the age of 55 years should not nullify this principle because an average Singaporean's life expectancy is now 76 years. Even if he retires at the age of 60 years, there is still a good 16 years for him to live on. So he should, between the ages of 55 years and 60 years, continue to save as much as he can and the saving rate should be compatible to his needs at the point of time. Hence, we are reducing it to a saving rate of 20% and not 40%, unlike workers who are below the age of 55 years. So it is entirely rational that workers who are continuing to work beyond the age of 55 years should make some contribution to their CPF. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 35, at end, to add - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(c) the employer declines to renew a contract of employment, where the contractis for a fixed term.\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has very usefully clarified that the Ministry will take a very flexible attitude towards the implementation of the Retirement Age Bill. But as long as you make it an offence under clause 4(3), you need to plug obvious loopholes. You have to look at the Bill in the way that a lawyer would look at it. One of the obvious loopholes is that if you want to get around this dismissal problem, you put people on fixed term contracts, six months or a year. Non-renewal of a contract is not dismissal, unless you define it as dismissal. This is why I am suggesting that the definitional section in clause 2 be amended in the manner that is stated, so that if an employer does have people on short-term contracts, non-renewal also would count as dismissal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, on the other hand, the Minister accepts my latest suggestion to take out that criminal provision and leave it entirely to conciliation, then this first proposal is not absolutely crucial. Because the Ministry and the officials will be able to look at the situation and come to a just conclusion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the objective of the Bill is to raise the retirement age of employees who are on permanent employment to 60 and eventually to 67. This, however, should not prevent employers from employing workers on short-term basis for a particular project or where age is a genuine occupational requirement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members an example. When the Government formed the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC) in 1983 to design and construct the mass rapid transit system, it was necessary for MRTC to engage sizable numbers of engineers, architects and technical officers to undertake the project. Once the MRT system was completed, the requirement for such a large number of professionals \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> would obviously decrease and decrease quite drastically too. Hence, MRTC in 1983 and 1984 engaged many professionals on fixed term contracts. It was entirely reasonable and acceptable by the employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, for the current phase of the MRT extension to Woodlands, the MRTC has also employed engineers and other professionals on fixed term contracts. Because once the current extension of the MRT to Woodlands is completed, again they would not need the number of engineers and architects. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, genuine fixed term contracts based on particular projects or where age is an occupational requirement, whether it is for health or safety reasons, should be exempted from the provisions of the Retirement Age Bill. This approach allows for flexibility and, at the same time, safeguards the interest of workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed amendment by Assoc. Prof. Woon would make it practically impossible for employers to engage any worker, any employee, on a fixed term basis, as they would be compelled, under his amendment, to renew such contract even if there was no work for them. Taking the example of the MRTC, it would mean that the MRTC would have to retain all the hundreds of architects and engineers who were employed in 1984 to the age of 60. This is completely not feasible. And it is also clearly not the objective of the law to compel employers to retain such workers on a permanent basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hence clause 10 enables the Minister to grant exemption to certain categories of workers from the statutory requirement of minimum retirement age. And such exemption will be granted for employees who are on fixed term contracts. Under the circumstances, I do not believe that it is prudent to accept the amendment proposed by the Member. No matter how well intentioned it is, I think it will add to the rigidity of the labour market and make it more difficult for employers and employees to come to a certain agreement. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Minister and I are at cross purposes. When you have a situation like the MRTC, when the work disappears, the employees are dismissed not on the ground of age, they are dismissed because you no longer have work. And that is permissible under the Act, I presume. What I am thinking about is a situation where an employer says, \"All right, we are going to have a problem when you guys get old. So let us give you 1-year contracts. Everyone has 1-year contracts. When you reach 55, I don't renew you.\" That is not a dismissal. That is the problem. This is why I have suggested it. Is this a dismissal or not a dismissal? If you are going to court with a lawyer, the lawyer will argue that non-renewal does not amount to dismissal unless you define \"non-renewal\" as dismissal. And if there is no dismissal, there can be no question of whether it is on age or not on age, if you follow what I mean. This is why I have suggested the amendment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister says it is not necessary because his Ministry will look at these things in the circumstances and I accept that. If the Minister is going to leave it to conciliation, then we do not have to worry with all these niceties of the law. But if we are going to expect the courts to interpret these sections, then I think we must look at them in the way that lawyers would look at them and try to anticipate what kind of loopholes will be poked in the statute itself. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, accepting the Member's proposed amendment would, in fact, mean that fixed term contracts will no longer be used at all. Because I do not know what he meant by making a distinction between one where there is a clear-cut project with an ending and one where there is no ending and is renewed annually. I have already explained earlier on in response to the Member that should an employee complain that he has been dismissed and that his employer has used the fixed term contract as a mechanism to circumvent \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the law, then the investigating officer should be able to determine from the employer whether, in fact, the employee who has been retained on a fixed term contract was actually doing a different kind of work related to a specific project each time the contract was renewed. Or was he just carrying on doing the same work after each renewal of his contract and that there was no linkage of the term of the contract with a specific project? We are quite confident that that can be determined. If we ascertain that, in fact, the fixed term contract was not linked to a specific project, then we will conclude that the employer has tried to circumvent the law by using the fixed term contract, and we will rule in favour of the employee. So that will take care of the Member's concern that the employers may use the fixed term contract as a means to circumvent the law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 3, lines 9 to 12, to leave out sub-clause (3). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I have suggested this amend ment is that the Minister has rightly pointed out that conciliation is the better way to deal with these things rather than going to court with a prosecution. Once you go to court with a prosecution, firstly, there is a problem because the prosecution has to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. If the employer says nothing, it is for the prosecution to prove that the dismissal was on account of age. How does he do that in the absence of any evidence? That is the first thing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing is stigma. There is a stigma attached to being prosecuted and convicted in court. And I do not think, as a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> matter of principle, that we should criminalise behaviour of this sort. You cannot legislate good labour relations any more than you can legislate good husband and wife relations. So it is far better that the Ministry should play a conciliatory role than that this should be a matter for prosecution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third thing is that an offence of this sort has repercussions beyond the Retirement Age Act. The Companies Act, at present in section 154, disqualifies a person who is being convicted of an offence involving management of a company. If a person in the management of a company dismisses an employee and is convicted under this particular section, it is arguable that he is disqualified from directorship and management for five years. This particular provision of the Companies Act will probably the amended once the Select Committee has gone through, but one cannot say. So it does have repercussions beyond this particular law, which is why I am not very happy about criminalising it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most cases, an employee makes a complaint. The Ministry looks into the complaint. If the Minister finds the complaint to be justified, he makes an order, gives a direction. If the employer disobeys this direction, that is the time you impose a fine or jail sentence. But to prosecute someone without going through the conciliation process seems to be redundant if you want conciliation most of the time. This is why I am suggesting that clause 4(3) be taken out, because really it is going to be redundant. That is the first reason. The second is that it is too easy for lawyers to poke holes in it. As we have indicated - Mr Shanmugam has indicated - I think the legal Members of this House will know that lawyers being what they are, they will find a way around this if you have to go through a formal prosecution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I am grateful to the Member for his strong support of our conciliation process. The Ministry is also \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of the view that conciliation should be carried out first before any prosecution is contemplated. Here I would like to reassure the Member that it is not the intention of the Ministry to prosecute under clause 4(3) of the Bill all violators of the law. We will, in fact, carry out a process of conciliation to resolve the dispute between employer and employee before we consider any further action. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While conciliation will help to settle disputes relating to unlawful dismissal on account of age, we should nevertheless retain the right to prosecute employers who blatantly and repeatedly resort to dismissing employees on account of age. The GPC Chairman for Labour has pointed out that, in fact, some employers may not all be averse to paying some compensation if they feel strongly enough and want to get rid of a particular employee. So compensation alone for the ex-employee may not be sufficient to deter employers from resorting to dismissing workers on account of age. So we should always have some criminal sanctions to act as a deterrent to the employers who, in dismissing their employees, would now have to take greater care to ensure that the dismissal is on valid grounds and not because of age. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, similar offences are also provided in both the Employment Act and the Industrial Relations Act. The provision for criminal sanction in employer-employee relationship is not new. Both the Employment Act and the Industrial Relations Act have such a criminal sanction. Section 81 of the Employment Act (Cap. 91) states that no employer can dismiss a female employee who is absent from work because of confinement. If an employer contravenes section 81 of the Employment Act, he commits an offence under section 87 and he is liable to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both. So an offence is created here. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 53 of the Employment Act states that any employer who employs any person contrary to Part IV of the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Employment Act where certain terms and conditions of employment are provided for or fails to pay any salary in accordance with Part IV commits an offence and is liable to a fine not exceeding $1,000. If it is a second conviction, the fine is a sum not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Industrial Relations Act, section 82(1) states that an employer shall not dismiss or threaten to dismiss an employee by reason of, inter alia, his becoming an officer or member of a trade union, being a member of a trade union which is seeking to improve working condition. Any employer who contravenes section 82(1) of the Industrial Relations Act commits an offence and is liable to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to an imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both. Sir, such provisions or criminal sanction against violations committed by employers have not soured up employer-employee relationship in Singapore. On the contrary, the provision of criminal sanction has ensured that employers uphold their end of the bargain and that there are far fewer disputes as a result of the provision of sanction. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, maybe at the risk of being considered diverting from the main discussion, I understand that Assoc. Prof. Woon has a desire to eliminate the penalty factor from this Bill. But, in reality, you need some penalty to deal with errant employers who will repeatedly flout the law. I understand that Assoc. Prof. Woon is drafting a Bill to legislate on filial piety. I understand that he is drafting a law which will force children to be responsible for the welfare of their parents. It is a very honourable objective. I do not wish to prejudge his draft Bill. But if the filial piety Bill does not have any sanction against offenders, he may well find that the law would have little effect on the hard-hearted children who persist in abandoning their aged and destitute parents. So even in a matter of father and son relationship, the law may well have to provide \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> some sanction against the repeat offender or the violator. What more in the case of employer-employee relationship where we also need to safeguard the interest of the employee from an employer who may repeatedly violate the law. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> I thank the Minister for his clarification, but I again think that he has misunderstood me. I do not want to take the penalty out of the Bill. I just think that the penalty is in the wrong place. There is already a penalty under clause 7. You go to conciliation, the Minister makes the order, you ignore the order, there is a penalty. There is no need to have a double penalty because, as I said, there are repercussions that go beyond the Bill. I think what we have is a basic difference of opinion about whether or not such a provision is going to be useful. I think that lawyers being what they are, they will find ways around it. But I respect the Minister's judgement. If he feels that it is not necessary, I hope the conciliation will be sufficient. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5 to 12 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>4.19 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to introduce amendments to the Constitution which, together with certain of the other proposed amendments to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act contained in a separate Bill, will enable a permanent single Court of Appeal to be created. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Constitution, as currently worded, provides for the appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court. These Judges sit in the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal as established by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. The Court of Appeal hears civil appeals from the High Court while the Court of Criminal Appeal hears criminal appeals from the High Court. Both appellate courts are usually presided over by the Chief Justice who sits with two other Judges, the Judges taking turns to form a panel for each week's hearing. There are no separate Judges of Appeal and the same Judges sit as Judges of first instance in the High Court and as Judges in the two appellate courts subject to the rule that no Judge will sit in an appeal against his own decision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will recall from press reports that the Chief Justice indicated at the opening of the legal year in January 1993 that there is a need to review the existing structure of the Supreme Court. This Bill before the House is one outcome of the review. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill amends Article 94 of the Constitution so that the creation of the Court of Appeal as part of the Supreme Court is entrenched in the Constitution. The new Court of Appeal will replace the Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal established by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill amends Article 95 of the Constitution regarding the appointment of Judges. A separate tier of appellate Judges to be called Judges of Appeal will be appointed under the amended Article 95. As from the date the amendments take effect, all new Judges, other than the Chief Justice, will be appointed either as Judges of the High Court or Judges of Appeal. As for existing Judges, all Judges of the Supreme Court are appointed under existing Article 95 and holding office at the date the amendments take effect will continue to hold office as Judges of the High Court. The expression \"Judge of the Supreme Court\" \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> will continue to be used as a convenient generic term to include the Chief Justice, a Judge of Appeal and a Judge of the High Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the creation of this permanent single Court of Appeal with a separate tier of appellate Judges will, in my view, improve and rationalise the administration of justice at the appellate level. The Judges of Appeal will be able to devote their full time to appellate cases and play a greater role in the judicial development of our law. With the creation of the permanent single Court of Appeal, the limited rights of appeal to the Privy Council may in due course be reviewed with a view to its eventual removal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill also provides for the appointment of a Judicial Commissioner to hear a specified case only. At present, a Judicial Commissioner must be appointed for a specified period. After the amendments take effect, a Judicial Commissioner may, for instance, be appointed to hear a case for which he may have special expertise. Or he may be appointed to hear a case which is originally fixed before a Judge so that that Judge can complete an ongoing case which would otherwise have to be adjourned as part-heard. In this way, the number of part-heard cases can be reduced, thereby improving the administration of justice in the High Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ho Peng Kee (Sembawang GRC):</b> Sir, I speak in support of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the restructuring of the courts system is timely. It is a natural progression from the other reforms that have been introduced in our legal system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our judicial system, since the appointment of the current Chief Justice, has been spruced up. It is now more efficient and effective. These are qualities to add to those which Singapore's judicial system already possesses - competence and integrity. All who feel that they have justified legal claims should have no fear in addressing their grievances in our \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> courts. There is no need for anyone to take things into his own hands - by engaging thugs to pressurise or beat up an opponent or go on a hunger strike. These approaches are out of sync with Singapore's social circumstances. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure the legal profession welcomes the creation of our very own permanent Court of Appeal. It is yet another building block in the strengthening of our legal system and, as the Minister has pointed out, should lead us closer to the day when we can finally cut ourselves off from the remaining apron strings of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a move is positive also in two other ways. First, within the Supreme Court, newer Judicial Commissioners (JCs) and Judges can look forward to some form of career development. Recognition of the quality of their judgements and contribution to the development of Singapore's very own legal jurisprudence can come in the form of appointment as a Judge of Appeal. Secondly, it will speed up the development of Singapore's very own legal jurisprudence. This has become increasingly critical as the corpus of UK laws assume a stronger European flavour. Social and even business conditions in Singapore increasingly differ from those in the UK. An increasing volume of recent legislation introduced in this House has been adapted not only from the UK but also from Australia and New Zealand. The GST Bill is a good example. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the ad-hoc appointments of Judicial Commissioners is also a laudable move. It will enable the best talents from the Bar to contribute directly to dispensing justice and developing Singapore's legal jurisprudence.

Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the Supreme Court of Judicature Act in a number of ways. Let me highlight the more important features. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Bill gives effect to the proposed reorganisation of the present Court of Appeal and Court of Criminal Appeal into a permanent single Court of Appeal. Clause 15 provides for the constitution and jurisdiction of the reorganised Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal shall consist of the Chief Justice and the Judges of Appeal. Except on the request of the Chief Justice where circumstances require, Judges of the High Court will no longer sit in the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal shall exercise appellate civil and criminal jurisdiction. Clause 15 also provides for the composition of the Court of Appeal. Its jurisdiction is usually exercised by three Judges of Appeal. However, two Judges of Appeal will suffice for the purpose of determining an appeal against an interlocutory order or any other order except a judgment obtained after a trial of an action commenced by writ or after the hearing of an action or matter commenced by any \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> other originating process. With a separate tier of appellate Judges, it is necessary to set out the order of precedence among Judges of the Supreme Court, and this is done in clause 3. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, clause 10 amends section 16 of the Act to re-define the original civil jurisdiction of the High Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the basis of the existing general civil jurisdiction of the High Court as set out in section 16 is really not satisfactory in principle or in practice. That provision is modelled after a similar provision in the Malaysian Courts of Judicature Act 1964 which applied to us when we were part of Malaysia. After we separated from Malaysia, the provision was retained in the Act when it was passed in 1969 although the intention, according to the then Minister of Law, was to revert to the position before we joined Malaysia. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 1964, the general civil jurisdiction of the High Court in actions in personam was unlimited and founded on service of a writ on a defendant either in Singapore or abroad. When the defendant was abroad, leave of the court was required to ensure that the case was a proper one for service out of the jurisdiction. The court exercised caution in granting leave, as service of a writ on a defendant in another country might cause injustice or hardship to a foreign defendant. The requirement for leave of the court was in effect removed by the present section 16 so that service of a writ outside Singapore is allowed so long as the conditions specified in section 16 are satisfied. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment of section 16 will place the High Court in exactly the position as it was before 1964 and in the position of the High Court of Judicature in England today in relation to countries outside the European Economic Community. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, clause 9 amends section 15 so that the High Court will have the criminal jurisdiction to try offences committed on board a Singapore ship or aircraft \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> wherever the ship may be. The High Court will also have jurisdiction to try an offence committed by any person outside Singapore where the offence is punishable under any written law which expressly provides that the offence is punishable even if committed outside Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 14 empowers the Chief Justice to allocate civil proceedings commenced in the High Court to be heard and determined in the District Court. The Chief Justice may exercise such power where he considers it necessary or expedient to improve efficiency in the administration of justice and to provide for more speedy disposal of cases. In making such an order, the Chief Justice may also provide a District Court with the necessary jurisdiction to determine such proceedings. The clause is wide enough to enable the Chief Justice to extend the jurisdiction of the District Courts to hear and determine matrimonial cases, companies winding up petitions, bankruptcy petitions and certain other matters not otherwise within the subject jurisdiction of the District Courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 empowers the High Court to make an order, on the application of the Public Prosecutor, for an accused person who has been acquitted by the Court to be remanded in custody pending the filing of an appeal by the Public Prosecutor. This is to ensure that an accused person, especially a foreigner, will not be able to abscond immediately he is released on acquittal when steps are being taken to lodge an appeal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 restricts the right of appeal to the reconstituted Court of Appeal in order to check the number of unmeritorious or unimportant appeals, especially on interlocutory matters. The minimum value of the subject matter involved for which there is an automatic right of appeal from the High Court to the Court of Appeal will be increased from $2,000 to $30,000. Clause 13 increases the minimum value for which there is an automatic right of appeal from the Subordinate Courts to the High Court from $2,000 to $5,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other substantive amendments contained in the Bill relate to the use of experts as assessors to assist the High Court in cases which require technical or scientific knowledge (clause 7) and the authorization of solicitors or their employees to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Sheriff in order to alleviate the shortage of manpower in the High Court (clause 24). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Bedok GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the GPC for Home Affairs and Law, some three years ago, highlighted the need for a single permanent Court of Appeal. The Minister for Law, while agreeing to the merits for this, explained that because of the shortage of Judges at that time, we were not yet ready to set up a permanent Court of Appeal. I am glad that this Bill before the House today will see the crystallisation of a single permanent Court of Appeal for Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I support the Bill in general, I would like to seek the Minister's clarification on three specific clauses of the Bill, some of which he has touched upon. Firstly, clause 14. The new section 28A empowers the Chief Justice to allocate certain proceedings commenced in the High Court to be heard and determined by a District Court. Under what criteria or guidelines will this be done? While I appreciate the need for efficiency in the administration of justice, will the parties involved not be aggrieved or unhappy? Will they not interpret this as a diminution of the importance of their case? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, clause 17. Clause 17 re-enacts section 34 of the Act in a modified form. It increases the amount or value of the subject-matter at trial for which leave is required to appeal to the Court of Appeal from $2,000 to $30,000, an increase of some 15 times. Is this increase too excessive? I understand the need to discourage frivolous appeals and thus \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> overload the Court of Appeal, but the figure of $30,000 would seem to be rather excessive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22. This clause empowers the High Court to order an accused person who has been acquitted to be remanded in custody for a period not exceeding 48 hours on application by the Public Prosecutor pending the filing of the notice of appeal. Sir, I am a layman and not a lawyer. I wonder why this clause is necessary. If a person has been acquitted by the Court, why should he be remanded further, even if it is only for 48 hours just because the Public Prosecutor is filing a notice of appeal? The Minister has made reference to foreigners. What about Singaporeans whose passports may be held by the authority? Need they be remanded? Under what circumstances will this be done and what is the rationale behind this? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in closing, I would like to express my surprise that Mr Chiam and the other Members of the Opposition have not given their support to the setting up of this Court of Appeal. I just wonder why. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say how welcome this Bill is. We have waited a long time for a permanent Court of Appeal - 23 years to be exact, since January 1970. It is a long time to be without a proper Court of Appeal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have comments on specific matters but, on this part, I will try to confine myself just to one general matter. The significance of a permanent Court of Appeal goes beyond just indicating the maturity of our legal system. Any common law legal system cannot function unless we have adequate precedents from the courts. In other words, cases of the courts are decided and which they rule upon and which are reported in the law reports because these law reports form the backbone of the law for future generations. Hitherto, the Court of Appeal has not been a permanent organisation. The members of the Court of Appeal have \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> been drawn from among the High Court Judges themselves. And one can imagine that it is rather difficult for one High Court Judge to say another High Court Judge is wrong, especially if the other High Court Judge might be sitting on appeal over this first High Court Judge's decision later on. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of this permanent Court of Appeal creates a body with the moral authority to say to the High Court and to other courts in Singapore, to say to everyone in Singapore, short of Parliament, \"This is the law, this is what the law is.\" Because once the Court of Appeal has spoken, short of Parliament and short of a theoretical appeal to the Privy Council, the Court of Appeal's word actually is law. The problem really is what do we do about decisions of predecessors of the Court of Appeal. In England, they have not faced with the problem of predecessor courts for over a century. But because of our history, we have more than a dozen predecessor courts. We have the Court of Appeal of the Straits Settlements, the Court of Appeal of the Colony of Singapore and the Federal Court of Malaysia. We have also other courts which became part of the Federal Court of Malaysia, like the Court of Appeal of the Federation of Malaya, its predecessor, the Court of Appeal of the Malayan Union, its predecessor, the Court of Appeal of the Federated Malay States, the Court of Appeal of Sarawak-Borneo-Brunei. All of these predecessor courts, in some ways, have contributed to the corpus of law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that, in 1970, the then Chief Justice, in a case called Mah Kah Yew v Public Prosecutor, said that the Court of Appeal in Singapore is bound by the decisions of the Federal Court of Malaysia and of predecessors of the Federal Court of Malaysia. This means that if you can find a decision, say, a Borneo Court, in 1955, that decision binds the Singapore Court of Appeal. The Singapore Court of Appeal must follow that decision. I suggest that to be bound by this dead decision is certainly not in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> line with our independent status. And I further suggest to the Minister that this is an opportune moment for us to cut the bonds of what lawyers call the doctrine of stare decisis and to declare that our Court of Appeal, being de facto, the highest court in Singapore, is now well capable of deciding what the law is for Singapore without necessarily having to follow the decisions of its predecessors. This has been done in other Commonwealth countries that have had similar problems in the Caribbean and East Africa. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts will, of course, give great respect and great weight to decisions of predecessor courts. But there is a difference between having persuasive judgement and one that is irretrievably binding. This is why I will be suggesting in Committee that we have a specific section to make it absolutely clear that our Court of Appeal is autochthonous. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other matters that I would like to bring up, may I briefly say that one deals with the extra-territorial criminal jurisdiction of the High Court and the other deals with anomalies that arise on appeal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as far as the general principle of the Bill is concerned, may I reiterate my support for this Bill. \n  <br>4.57 pm \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi) in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck:</b> Sir, I rise to support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I totally agree with Mr Ho Peng Kee that ever since Chief Justice Yong Pung How has assumed this role, much improvement has been made. As a non-lawyer, I would just like to ask the Minister whether this appointment of a permanent Court of Appeal means that the Government is contemplating abolishing all appeals to the Privy Council in London. If so, when. And are there many outstanding cases for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the Privy Council and, when transferred to our Court of Appeal here, would there be a lot of work and can the Court of Appeal cope? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank those who have spoken. I will quickly respond to the points raised. Firstly, the points raised by Dr Arthur Beng. As to the criteria for cases to be sent to the Subordinate Courts, first of all, he would have noted that this is for civil cases. I understand that the criterion really will be whether there is congestion in the High Court and to have the cases decided early. Therefore, I would think that this will not upset the parties because the parties from both sides will be interested - this being a civil case - in the early resolution of the matter, and if by sending it to the Subordinate Courts will enable an early resolution, I think the parties will welcome it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the increased limit, I think this is consistent because he must bear in mind that this is related to the corresponding increase in the jurisdiction of the District Court to $100,000. Thirdly, on the issue of remand when an appeal is filed, of course, this would only be in rare cases and also I wish to emphasise that this would not automatically be applied but it is up to the courts. The courts must be satisfied that there are very good reasons and the Public Prosecutor has to adduce good reasons why this must be done. So I do not think that there need be fear because it is not automatic or mandatory and the court will have to regard this special power or remand only when it is satisfied. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon raised the question which I believe he is going to raise under the amendments to the Bill concerning the doctrine of stare decisis. Perhaps I should reserve my comments when we come to the Committee stage. If I may make a general point about his amendments, I welcome his contributions to enable us to focus on different aspects of the Bill. I might as well say now that it is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> unlikely that we will be able to agree to the amendments. But one benefit of his contributions is that it has drawn our attention to the need to harmonise one aspect of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Bill with the Subordinate Courts (Amendment) Bill. As a result of that, I will move an amendment to this Bill in Committee stage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia Shi Teck mentioned about the Privy Council. I think he might have missed what I said, ie, with the establishment of this Court, we will indeed have to review the existing limited rights of appeal to the Privy Council. We are not in a hurry to do that.

But what I have done is that I have suggested two amendments to improve, I hope, the clause. The first part has already been accepted by the Minister and I thank him for that. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me try and explain the second part which deals with the new sub-clause (3) that I propose to add. The problem really lies in the jurisdiction of our courts. And to understand the jurisdiction of our courts, we have got to go back more than a century. The idea is that the court only has jurisdiction within a country. In 1891, in a case McLeod v Attorney-General, New South Wales, the Privy Council stated the principle that all crimes are local. Unfortunately, dicta from the end of the 19th century are not necessarily applicable at the end of the 20th century. I think we will find that crime increasingly is not local, especially commercial crime. When you have got electronic transfers of money, you have got faxes and you have got telecommunications, I think you will find that criminals can stay outside Singapore and still affect us. The problem is that our section 15 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act still clings to this 19th century idea that crime is local. And while murder has to be local, rape has to be local, theft has to be local, many commercial crimes can be done outside Singapore with repercussions here. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the House's indulgence for a moment if I could read section 15 very briefly and I would not take up too much \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> time. Briefly it states that the High Court has jurisdiction to try out all offences committed within Singapore on the high seas, on board any Singapore ship or aircraft, by any citizen of Singapore, by any person if it is piracy and by any person if it is under the Hijacking Protection of Aircraft Act. So there are four specific things and one general thing, crimes within Singapore. The problem is: can you just give our High Court jurisdiction to prosecute crimes within Singapore? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example. Let us suppose there is a syndicate of speculators who are manipulating the share prices of Singapore stocks. They are outside Singapore. They manipulate it outside Singapore. They spread rumours outside Singapore. None of these acts are done in Singapore, but the price moves. And people in Singapore get their fingers burnt. It is an offence under the Securities Industry Act, but we cannot try it because it is not an offence within Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us say we can lay our hands on these people. After all the investigations, after all the trouble that our investigatory authorities go through, it will be a tragedy if these people get off because there is a technical deficiency in the Act. Is there any other country that might be interested in trying these people who are manipulating Singapore stocks? I cannot imagine that any other country will be interested if they are not directly affected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we might find that in this kind of situation, we have got an international commercial crime that it will thrive in the interstices between the laws. You have these overlapping laws but there are black-holes where jurisdiction of different countries do not cover it. And this is one of the black-holes. This is why I have suggested the amendments in the Order Paper Supplement so that we can define what is meant by an offence in Singapore. Any part of the offence is committed within Singapore, we have jurisdiction. If the effects are felt within Singapore, we should have jurisdiction as well. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Otherwise, I fear that, as we move into the 21st century and new means of communication come up, we will find that you have these very smart international criminals who are using this kind of loophole to escape justice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I am being over cautious down here. But my point is that it does not hurt to have this thing in place just in case. It is really no use to let one criminal off in order to establish that there is a hole. If we see there is a hole, plug the hole now. If we never have to use it, then that is fine. But if we do have to use it, at least it is there. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, let me explain why it will not be possible for me to accept this amendment, although the reasons given by him and his objectives are laudable. First of all, let me say that the amendment which I moved earlier and which has been accepted already covers the situation of offences being committed outside Singapore because the new paragraph (f) gives jurisdiction over where the offence is committed. It says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`in any place or by any person if it is provided in any written law that the offence is triable in Singapore.' But he would go further to provide where the effects are felt in Singapore. I agree that our courts should have the necessary jurisdiction to deal with offences and national crimes. But the amendment that he has proposed is quite far-reaching and has got considerable implications which should really be studied both in principle and in detail. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe his draft is adapted from the New Zealand Crimes Act, section 7, and in his draft it could be that he has added the words, \"or if the effects of the offence are felt in Singapore\". Even without these words, \"or if the effects ... are felt in Singapore\", I think the wording could not be sufficient to deal with the complexity or the multitude of offences which our courts have to deal with. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also very concerned with the phrase \"if the effects ... are felt in Singapore\", because it is very wide. For example, if a Singaporean businessman is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> murdered in another country, it can be said that the effects are felt in Singapore, if he has a business in Singapore or his family is in Singapore. So where do we draw the line? Perhaps it can be drawn but I think it has to be studied very carefully. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the assertion of extra-territorial jurisdiction also has implications in international law, I would prefer to proceed quite cautiously. Any provision conferring extra-territorial jurisdiction should actually provide sufficient details so as not to lead to problems in the application of that provision. A balance will have to be struck between having too wide or too narrow a provision. I am not ruling this out completely, but I think it is a matter which really requires a cautious approach and study. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the UK Law Commission made a study of the subject of jurisdiction over offences of fraud and dishonesty with a foreign element in 1989. The Commission referred to the New Zealand provision and although it accepted the principle, it did not recommend the adoption of the wording. Its recommendations which were more elaborate have, in fact, to-date, not been enacted into law. So let us be cautious and, for the time being, we will not be able to accept this amendment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Sir, I appreciate the Minister's caution. I just hope that we do not regret it by letting a big fish go. Let me just say that the amendment that the Minister has proposed will not entirely cover it, because you require a written law to specifically state that the offence is triable in Singapore. And most of our written laws do not make this provision. In fact, I cannot offhand think of anything that has this extra-territorial trial sort of provision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Minister has not ruled it out entirely. I think this is an area we should look into and I hope we do not get ourselves burnt before we do find that we need something like this. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 10 to 14 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In page 7, line 11, after \"original\" to insert \"or revisionary\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again, I beg the House's indulgence to bring these rather technical matters before the House. The amendments I propose in clause 15 actually come in two parts. The first part is to deal with an anomaly in our system and the second part deals with the doctrine of stare decisis that I have already mentioned in my earlier speech on the Second Reading of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just explain to the Members of this House. The High Court in Singapore has got three types of jurisdiction. Firstly, it has got original jurisdiction to hear cases at first instance. In other words, full trials. Secondly, it has appellate jurisdiction. It hears cases on appeal from the Subordinate Courts. Thirdly, there is another sort of jurisdiction that we have that does not exist in England, and that is revisionary jurisdiction. A High Court Judge can call for the record of a case heard in the courts below, Subordinate Courts, and change the decision or correct any misimpressions. This revisionary jurisdiction was necessary because in the old days there were lay magistrates who might not necessarily have proper training and this kind of revisionary jurisdiction we actually inherited from India. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there is provision for appeals from the High Court in the exercise of its appellate and original jurisdiction, there is no provision for appeal in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction. This has been an anomaly that has existed for many years, and perhaps it is deliberate. So I would welcome the Minister's clarification on that. If it is not deliberate, if it is just an \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> anomaly, then I suggest that we could easily correct it by putting in the words in the amendment that stands in my name. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part, the doctrine of stare decisis, I have already made my points in the speech on the Second Reading and I would urge the Minister to put in this clause so that it is clear beyond doubt that our Court of Appeal is not bound. It is possible for the Court of Appeal to do this itself. In other words, to issue a practice direction saying \"we are not bound by prior decisions\". In fact, if the Court of Appeal can be induced to do this, this particular amendment would not be necessary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Do I understand, Sir, that I shall first speak on amendment No. 1 only. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> Yes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, this first amendment is closely linked to another amendment, which is Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon's proposal to add a New Section 26A, also concerning revisionary jurisdiction. Therefore, the reasons that I am going to give for this amendment are identical to the other amendment to propose a new section 26A. Sir, this will enable me to avoid a repetition. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say that these two amendments, ie, amendment No. 1 by Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon and his proposed new section 26A, cannot be agreed to for the following reasons. First of all, there is no need to provide for an appeal to the Court of Appeal from the decision of the High Court in exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction. Revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court is, in practice, normally exercised in favour of the accused, not the prosecution. This has been the practice. In practice, the sentences are never enhanced on revision as opposed to appeal, except where the court below was unaware of a mandatory minimum sentence. The object of revision is not to enhance sentences, but to correct obvious \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> mistakes of a court below, especially where appeals are not available. For example, where an accused has pleaded guilty without fully understanding the facts, the High Court may be asked by the accused to exercise its power of revision and set aside the conviction on a plea of guilty, since there was no appeal from such a conviction. The High Court does not, in practice, intervene on its own initiative in the sentences of a court below although it could do so in theory. It enhances sentences only upon appeal, either by the prosecution or by the accused. Therefore, the new section 26A as well as this amendment is, in my view, not necessary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also say that the amendment concerning revision is not acceptable because his amendment provides for an appeal only where the High Court has enhanced a sentence on revision, but not when it has reduced a sentence on revision. There is no reason why there should be such a distinction. Therefore, Sir, for those reasons, I would not be able to accept the amendment on his proposed new section 26A, which we will come to later. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> If I understand the Minister correctly, he is saying that as a matter of practice the courts do not enhance sentences. I am concerned what happens if you do get a High Court Judge who does exercise this power. You have absolutely no control over him. I take his point that if you want to have an appeal against the power of revision, it should also be an appeal against the power of revision when the High Court reduces sentences. So that can be subject of an amendment. In principle, I am afraid that if you do get a situation where a High Court Judge does call up the record and does enhance the sentence, there is no further recourse even though the High Court Judge may have been mistaken in some way. This is why I propose this amendment. The Minister has said that as a matter of practice this never happens, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> but I wonder if he can assure us that this would never ever happen. This is the problem. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, there are many things which the courts in the development of the law are dependent on practice and evolution of precedents and this is one of the areas. As Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon pointed out earlier, there is a background to the origins of this power of revision. It dates back to the days where there were non-professionals, non-lawyers, who were magistrates and judges. That taken together with the other amendment which this House has approved, that is, the Courts can look at the debates and proceedings of this House to ascertain the intention of the legislature, I think today's proceedings should not leave anyone any doubt as to what the intent of this amendment is. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. 2, Assoc.

This is what is referred to as a doctrine of stare decisis where courts, generally speaking, are bound to follow their own previous decisions as well as the decisions of the courts higher than the judicial hierarchy. The courts over the years have developed detailed rules as to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> stare decisis. Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon's point is to change one such rule concerning the Court of Appeal which is not satisfactory, and he cited the case of Mah Kah Yew. But Mah Kah Yew's case is actually a decision of the High Court. The Court of Appeal is actually free to disagree with the rule in that case and, if it so desires, it can overrule it. Of course, one could say that such a situation will never present itself. But I should think that the newly constituted Court of Appeal, if it wishes to, can at any time change the existing rules of stare decisis, for example, the new Court of Appeal, if it wants to, can issue a statement of judicial practice to that effect. In fact, the House of Lords in the United Kingdom issued a practice statement in 1966 to declare, in a departure from its previous practice, that it would not be bound by its own decisions. When Malaysia abolished appeals to the Privy Council, Malaysia also did not legislate to change the rule of stare decisis. They were content to leave the matter to be decided by the courts by case law. In my view, it is best to leave the development of the law on this to the courts for themselves to evolve and they can at any time declare what the position is. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> I thank the Minister for his statement. The problem is that the Court may never have the chance to do this. As long as Mah Kah Yew remains on the books, you have a situation, which is possible, that they will be bound. It would be far better if the Court of Appeal would do this. I am saying that if we have the opportunity, we should clarify the law. The Minister is of a different view. I respect his view.

Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Sir, I beg to move, \"That the clause be read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment that I have suggested again addresses an anomaly in our legal system. If you are prosecuted in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Singapore, you can be prosecuted either in the Subordinate Courts or in the High Court. If you are prosecuted in the High Court and you are convicted, you have a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal and thence to the Privy Council. But this right, of course, has been restricted. If, on the other hand, you are prosecuted in the Subordinate Courts, either the Magistrate's Court or the District Court, you only have a right of appeal to the High Court and there it stops. The High Court Judge may state a case for the Court of Criminal Appeal to look at, but he does not have to. There is no rule that forces him to do this no matter how wrong he may have been in not stating a case. No one has got any power to force the High Court Judge to state the case, except the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General can require a High Court Judge to state a case for the Court of Criminal Appeal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern really arises in this way. If you are prosecuted in the Subordinate Courts, let us say, the District Court, and you are acquitted, the Public Prosecutor may appeal to the High Court, and if the High Court acquits, the Public Prosecutor may require the High Court Judge to state a case for the Court of Criminal Appeal. So the Public Prosecutor has got two shots. If you are acquitted in the Subordinate Courts, and there is an appeal to the High Court, and the High Court convicts you on that appeal, in other words, they reverse the District Court Judge, the person whose acquittal has been changed into a conviction has got no right to go any further at all. Effectively, he has been convicted by only one Judge, that is, the High Court Judge, who will not have seen the witnesses because the witnesses would have been seen by the Subordinate \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Court's Judge. This may give rise to the perception that the system is not fair and it is very important for the integrity of the system that people do not feel that they have been given a raw deal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us say, you have a situation where someone is acquitted by a District Judge. The Public Prosecutor appeals to the High Court. The High Court Judge, without hearing the witnesses again, because this is the practice, changes the acquittal into a conviction, and this man then has no further recourse. As far as he is concerned, he might go to jail, his livelihood might be affected, but he has nothing further to say. He can request the High Court Judge to state a case. If the High Court Judge does state a case, the Court of Criminal Appeal can hear that case. But if the High Court Judge declines, then that accused person is left without redress. I say the Act is unsatisfactory because it gives rise to the perception that the playing field is not quite level. The prosecution has far more of an opportunity to get you into jail than you do to get yourself out, as it were. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the suggestion that section 60 be amended to give an accused the right to have a case stated to the Court of Criminal Appeal if the High Court Judge reverses his acquittal on appeal. He was acquitted at the Subordinate Courts, appealed to the High Court, the High Court Judge reverses that, he should have one further chance to go the Court of Criminal Appeal. Because we are talking about people who might go to jail, people who might be caned even, and there is also the stigma of being convicted of an offence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the New Clause (B) be read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, this amendment is also not acceptable. Let me explain why. In fact, the only change proposed by Assoc. Prof. Woon, as I can see, to the existing law is in the new section 60(1A) (b). I think that is the real substantive change to it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the present time, there is no appeal by either the Public Prosecutor or the accused to the Court of Criminal Appeal from a decision of the High Court in the exercise of its appellate criminal jurisdiction. His proposal has the effect of granting a right of appeal really in every case where the High Court has reversed an order of acquittal by the Subordinate Courts. That is the effect. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says that this is only fair because the Public Prosecutor has what he calls a \"second shot\" if the High Court rules against him. His argument assumes two things. First, he assumes that the Public Prosecutor will lodge an appeal from the High Court's decision under the guise of reserving a point of law. Secondly, he assumes that it is a practice of the Public Prosecutor to ask the Court of Appeal, where it determines the reserved point of law in his favour, to reverse the decision of a High Court, that is, to restore a conviction against the accused. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both his assumptions are erroneous. The general legislative policy must, of course, be that there is a finality of decisions. Therefore, the law provides that there should be no appeal from a decision of the High Court in its appellate criminal jurisdiction. This equally applies to the accused and the Public Prosecutor. However, in addition to the duty to ensure justice in individual cases, the Public Prosecutor has a further duty to ensure that the principles of law are correctly and authoritatively decided. That is why in every case where he applies to reserve a point of law of public interest for decision of the Court of Appeal, a judge must reserve that point of law. An accused person can also apply to reserve a point of law of public interest. But the judge has a discretion whether to allow that application. This discretion is necessary in order to sieve out questions which are not genuine points of law and are not of public interest and which are advanced merely as a guise for what is in fact an appeal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the practice of the Public Prosecutor to ask for a reversal of a High \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Court's decision in every case where the Court of Criminal Appeal determines a point of law in his favour. A Public Prosecutor has to exercise the power responsibly and his concern in reserving a point of law of public interest is not so much to secure justice in the individual, the specific case, which is of course important, but, more importantly, to ensure that the principles of law are correctly and authoritatively decided for future cases. In fact, I think Assoc. Prof. Woon knows the celebrated case of insider trading, Public Prosecutor vs Chowdhurie 1981, which provides an example of a case to which the order of acquittal by the High Court was not disturbed at all, even though the Court of Criminal Appeal determined the questions of law reserved for its decision in favour of the prosecution. So that is the raison d'etre of applying for points of principles of law to be reserved. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Sir, I have very great respect for the Minister. He was my Dean and my teacher. But I am afraid here I do disagree with him. I think it is not fair that the person who has been acquitted, and then convicted by the High Court, should not have a right, as opposed to a discretionary application, to go to the Court of Criminal Appeal, especially in the light of the fact when you are talking about civil cases where only money is involved, there is no problem and you can go to the Court of Appeal. But here we are talking about a person who might go to jail or might be caned. And I cannot help feeling that you might have a situation where the High Court Judge is wrong or he has an awful day, or for some reason, he has misapprehended the facts and there is no further avenue to check this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am suggesting really is to close the possibility that there may be miscarriage of justice. Judges try their best. We try and get the best men and women that we can, but they are human and they \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> can make mistakes. I think that when a person's liberty is at stake, where he could be caned, there should at least be one more appeal. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, if Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon's position is that where the law now does not provide for appeal, he disagrees and that, therefore, there should be another appeal, then that is a separate matter which he should pursue independently of this matter. This provision to which he makes an effort to amend does not talk about the right of appeal. It talks about reserving a point of law of public interest which is different from, say, appealing on the merits of the case. I have taken pains to explain the rationale of this provision. It is not to give so-called another shot. It is to clarify certain principles of law for future cases and, therefore, it is quite different from appealing on the merits of the case. Therefore, I must indicate my unwillingness to accept this amendment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question accordingly negatived. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Clause (B) accordingly disagreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The marginal note to the Schedule should read \"Section 29 (5)\", and not \"Section 29 (4)\".

HDB will initiate action in 1994 to clear the occupiers on land affected by the reclamation project. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The reclamation work is scheduled to commence in 1996 and complete by 2000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) In HDB's current 5-year Building Programme, Punggol is scheduled for housing development from 1997. According to HDB's projection, about 28,000 dwelling units (or an equivalent of three-quarters of the size of Punggol New Town) will be built by the year 2001. However, the land at Punggol Point in the vicinity of the existing boatels and restaurants will be developed after 2001 when the reclamation work is completed. It is too early now to have a firm projection of Building Programme for housing development beyond year 2001 on this land or the reclaimed land.   \n </body>\n</html>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
