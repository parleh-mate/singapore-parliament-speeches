Each parcel of land has its\r\n\r\nown  characteristics depending on the tenure,  Master  Plan\r\n\r\nzoning,  state  of  encumbrances, physical characteristics,\r\n\r\nthe improvements thereon and accessibility to services. All\r\n\r\nthese  factors affect market value.

There  is\r\n\r\nno  reason to believe that the decline in the total\r\n\r\narea  leased and comparatively smaller  lots  taken\r\n\r\nup  were  due  to  the increase in  the  land  rent\r\n\r\ncharged  by  JTC. JTC has increased the  land  rent\r\n\r\nfrom 1 8 cents per square foot per year in 1974  to\r\n\r\n24  cents per square foot per year in 1975  due  to\r\n\r\nthe  steep  rise  in  land and  development  costs\r\n\r\nThese  rates  are, however, still  well  below  the\r\n\r\nprevailing  market  mates  for  private  industrial\r\n\r\nland.

No doubt income\r\n\r\nfrom  entrance  fees will be reduced, but  with  a  larger\r\n\r\nmembership  the total collection of fees will equalise  the\r\n\r\nfigure and it can still maintain the Club house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I am not a golfer and I do not know\r\n\r\nthe economics of running a golf course.

(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Teong Eng Siong, L.P. Rodrigo, Hwang Soo Jin. P. Govindaswamy, Ch'ng Jit Koon and Dr Chiang Hai Ding.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, culturally we have always been conscious\r\n\r\nof  our rich and varied heritage, and have expressed  pride\r\n\r\nin  our  cultural diversity. The Ministry  of  Culture  has\r\n\r\ngiven  as  much  encouragement to  the  reflection  of  the\r\n\r\nvariety  of  our  cultural potential as  limited  financial\r\n\r\nallocations would allow. I think I must emphasise here  \"as\r\n\r\nlimited  financial allocations would allow\". More  recently\r\n\r\nwe have had the development of such activities as Music for\r\n\r\nEveryone,  Art  for Everyone, Concert for  the  Young, and\r\n\r\nvarious  exhibitions. But I think my point about  financial\r\n\r\nallocations, and therefore constraint upon effort,  may  be\r\n\r\nillustrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in a Ministry whose avowed aim is nurturing\r\n\r\nand  development  of culture, there is  only  one  cultural\r\n\r\naffairs  officer.  I understand he is assisted  by  a  very\r\n\r\nsmall  number  of officers, perhaps two or three  officers.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister may be able to enlighten us there.  What  can\r\n\r\nthis small, even if gallant, handful of people do? How many\r\n\r\ncultural  events have they been able to organise, and  for\r\n\r\nhow  many  people? Compare this number with what reasonable\r\n\r\nnumber  would indicate an effective spread of influence  of\r\n\r\nthese  cultural  events. Such a kind of  examination  would\r\n\r\nserve as an indicator to show the extent to which we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommitted to a policy of encouraging cultural development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other indicators. If we examine another item of\r\n\r\nexpenditure  we  can get a good idea of  how  a  policy  is\r\n\r\nreflected  in  budget  allocations. For  example, for  the\r\n\r\npromotion  of cultural matters and exhibitions,  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  an increase of allocation from $65,000 for last  year\r\n\r\nto  $105,000  for this coming financial year, which  (mind\r\n\r\nyou)  includes a sum of $30,000 that is subject to Treasury\r\n\r\nsanction,  While  the  Minister for  Culture  is  no  doubt\r\n\r\ngrateful for such small mercies, it would be interesting to\r\n\r\nfind  out  what  we are getting with this  kind  of  money.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Minister could tell us later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What appears to be happening in the case of the\r\n\r\nactivities  like  Art  for Everyone, and  Concert  for  the\r\n\r\nYoung, and so on, is that they seem to be organised  on  an\r\n\r\nad  hoc  basis and this is because there is not  very  many\r\n\r\nstaff  to look after these events. Like when it is come  to\r\n\r\nbe known that some artistes are passing through, or when  a\r\n\r\nlocal  military  band  is available for  some  performance.\r\n\r\nThere  does not seem to be any sequential programme planned\r\n\r\nor   any   particular  aim  that  is  discernible  in   the\r\n\r\narrangement  of  the  events in such  items  as  Music  for\r\n\r\nEveryone and Concert for the Young, although one must admit\r\n\r\nthat  an  idea like the Beautiful Singapore Art  Exhibition\r\n\r\ndoes have a worthwhile theme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take yet another illustration, if you look at the\r\n\r\nNational Theatre Trust Annual Report for 1974-75, you  will\r\n\r\nfind  that its first preoccupation is major renovations  to\r\n\r\nthe  Theatre and expenditure. This kind of thing represents\r\n\r\nits  principal problem. What else can the Trust  do  except\r\n\r\nwhat  it  has  done, namely, enter into joint  presentation\r\n\r\nwith  other  organisations.  All  the  same,  with  limited\r\n\r\nresources the Trust seems to have done well. But again  its\r\n\r\ndependence on sponsors is a clue to the extent of  official\r\n\r\nsupport for its work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An exceptional, important role as everybody knows is that\r\n\r\nplayed  by  broadcasting: perhaps,  especially,  by  TV  in\r\n\r\nrespect of giving expression to cultural policies. In  this\r\n\r\nregard,  for further contribution to a sense of  belonging,\r\n\r\nto  a  consciousness  of  community.  TV  has  to  turn  to\r\n\r\nencouraging greater understanding among our citizens of one\r\n\r\nanother's cultural forms. People have to be stimulated into\r\n\r\na more heightened awareness of, and interest in the various\r\n\r\ncharacteristic  forms  of  cultural  expression.  And   the\r\n\r\nstimulus can be provided by RTS if it sets its mind  to  it\r\n\r\nand  if it gets the support; if it is the policy to require\r\n\r\nit to do this kind of thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just as an illustration, what is the position at\r\n\r\npresent  in terms of programmes that are viewed by a  mixed\r\n\r\nviewership, by a multi-lingual viewership, by a  viewership\r\n\r\ncomposed  of audiences from the different language  streams\r\n\r\nat  the same time? I am just trying to illustrate a certain\r\n\r\ncondition in our society. The programmes that get a  multi-lingual  viewership are the imported programmes, especially\r\n\r\nin   English   and  mainly  in  the  crime  and   violence.\r\n\r\nentertainment, and full-length film categories.  And  these\r\n\r\nprogrammes would perhaps occupy as much as half of TV  time\r\n\r\nduring  a week. At the same time, one other programme  that\r\n\r\ngets a mixed audience, a multi-lingual audience, is Justice\r\n\r\nPao.  Incidentally, this popularity of Justice Pao  with  a\r\n\r\nmulti-lingual  audience  shows  that  a  programme  with  a\r\n\r\ncultural flavour of one of the main cultural streams of our\r\n\r\nsociety  can,  can indeed, have an audience transcending  a\r\n\r\nparticular ethnic group. Unfortunately, here again. Justice\r\n\r\nPao is also an imported programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Pao Piao.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Yes, we will come to Pao Piao. Otherwise,\r\n\r\nwe  do  not seem to be able to break through beyond insular\r\n\r\nsituations  when  one  ethnic group is watching  programmes\r\n\r\nonly  in its own language. Let me make it plain that it  is\r\n\r\ngood that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentertainment be provided for Tamils to watch Tamil  cinema\r\n\r\nand  Malays  to watch Pesta Ria and Chinese  to  watch  Pao\r\n\r\nPiao, but we want something in addition to this where their\r\n\r\nsights  are  taken beyond their own cultural boundaries.  I\r\n\r\nhope that the Minister will not retort like he did the last\r\n\r\ntime when I said the same thing, hsin p'ing, chit, chiu new\r\n\r\nbottles,  old  wine. I hope I got the pronunciation  right.\r\n\r\nCulture is a laborious process of growth and points have to\r\n\r\nbe  reiterated  in  order  to  arouse  adequate  attention,\r\n\r\nespecially as adequate attention does not seem to have been\r\n\r\naroused previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may make one last point that relates to our young\r\n\r\npeople,  we  should  think  of  providing  them  with  more\r\n\r\nopportunities to continue the cultural interest  they  have\r\n\r\ndeveloped  in  schools which have been  encouraged  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of   Education's   Extra-Curricular   Activities\r\n\r\nprogrammes, youth festivals, band competitions, and so  on.\r\n\r\nI  have  also mentioned the view held by some young  people\r\n\r\nthemselves that not enough is done to set the sights of our\r\n\r\nyoung  people beyond their immediate surroundings. In  this\r\n\r\nconnection,  perhaps TV could produce programmes  on  ASEAN\r\n\r\nproblems, matters, background and other  regional  themes,\r\n\r\ngradually  extending the focus in a more global  direction.\r\n\r\nWe,  of  course,  have Newsreel but the shots  of  Newsreel\r\n\r\ncomprise  mere  flashes and there is no depth  analysis  of\r\n\r\nevents  that  take  place around us. We  have  thought  and\r\n\r\ntalked  about the necessity to carry the attention  of  our\r\n\r\nyoung people beyond their immediate preoccupations. Perhaps\r\n\r\nour  organisation has not arrived at a standard when we can\r\n\r\nproduce programmes like Panorama and 24 Hours that  I  have\r\n\r\nnoticed, and I am sure the Minister has himself noticed, on\r\n\r\nBBC and British Television, but we should certainly try  to\r\n\r\nencourage  a  more particular appreciation  of  the  larger\r\n\r\nworld around us where our young people are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture certainly has great responsibilities to\r\n\r\ndischarge. On the one hand, it will have to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactively propagate a multi-racial culture and values of our\r\n\r\npeople.  On  the  other hand, it will  have  to  raise  the\r\n\r\ncultural   quality  of  our  people,  their  thoughts   and\r\n\r\ncharacter, in order to cultivate them to be people of  good\r\n\r\nquality. This is not an easy task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few years, the Ministry of Culture has\r\n\r\nactually  put  in some effort in the promotion  of  various\r\n\r\nhealthy  cultural  and  artistic activities,  such  as  the\r\n\r\nholding of public art exhibitions, the organising of public\r\n\r\nmusic  concerts  for the people and so  on,  to  popularise\r\n\r\nartistic  tastes and appreciation among the  people.  Radio\r\n\r\nand  TV  Singapore have also put forward a number  of  good\r\n\r\nprogrammes  such  as students' debating forums  which  help\r\n\r\nthem  to  have  a better understanding of and  interest  in\r\n\r\ncurrent  affairs and in academic studies. There  have  also\r\n\r\nbeen  programmes  like News Magazine, Children's  Magazine,\r\n\r\nDaily  Digest  which are meaningful as well  as  educative.\r\n\r\nHowever, the  number  of such healthy  programmes  is  too\r\n\r\nsmall.  On  the  contrary, there is  a  greater  number  of\r\n\r\nnonsensical  programmes  which  outweigh  and  nullify  the\r\n\r\ninfluence  of healthy programmes. In spite of the  cultural\r\n\r\ncontribution of the Ministry of Culture, there exist in our\r\n\r\nsociety  also undesirable cultural pieces in  the  form  of\r\n\r\nsensual, erotic, monstrous and phantasmic films, literature\r\n\r\nand   pictures   which  exert  a  great  degenerating   and\r\n\r\ncorrupting  effect on our people, our youth in  particular.\r\n\r\nand  turning them into a weak lot. So for the future of our\r\n\r\nyouths,  our task now is to strengthen our healthy cultural\r\n\r\nforce  in  order  to  promote and  popularise  healthy  and\r\n\r\nartistic  cultural activities so as to help them  recognise\r\n\r\ntheir  values and be able to distinguish the good from  the\r\n\r\nbad. This will benefit them in their life-time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among our youths, there is a sign of decadence. It is\r\n\r\nmainly  because  of the fact that some of  them  have  been\r\n\r\naffected by the bad habits of Western youths. They take  to\r\n\r\na  life of enjoyment, are easy-going and are not interested\r\n\r\nin  our healthy cultural and artistic performances. This is\r\n\r\na  very urgent task pertaining to the pattern of thought of\r\n\r\nour youths that is facing the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand all of us. Obviously, the main task of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture  is  how to face this challenge, how  to  help  the\r\n\r\nyoung  to be receptive to good culture and to rectify their\r\n\r\nerrors  and wrong thinking and to recognise which  type  of\r\n\r\nculture will bring them beneficial influence. In this  way,\r\n\r\nwe  can  mould our youths into a great force in our  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding and cultural development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to advance four suggestions to the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  his  reference, to help policy  formulation.\r\n\r\nFirst,  this concerns the work of raising the consciousness\r\n\r\nof our people; in other words, national consciousness. What\r\n\r\nkind  of  plan, of organized activities is the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture  going  to  take in order to promote  our  cultural\r\n\r\nquality?  Second, will the Minister consider  reducing  the\r\n\r\nrental  charged  for the use of our National  Theatre,  the\r\n\r\nVictoria Memorial Hall, or reducing the entertainment  duty\r\n\r\non  certain  performances in order to help  more  artistes,\r\n\r\nboth local and foreign, to perform in Singapore? These will\r\n\r\ninclude  pugilistics,  music  and  concert  shows.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  because of the high charges, interested organisers\r\n\r\ndo  not find it easy to organise such performances. So  our\r\n\r\npeople  are  deprived of more opportunities to  enjoy  such\r\n\r\nperformances of a higher standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, whether the Ministry has taken note of the many\r\n\r\nundesirable, phantasmic and erotic literature and  pictures\r\n\r\nbeing  put  on sale in the streets. Last year I  asked  the\r\n\r\nMinister  about this and he promised to look into  it.  One\r\n\r\nyear has passed. How is it that this sort of thing is still\r\n\r\ngoing  on?  Is  it  because the staff in  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture  are not efficient in their work, or is it  because\r\n\r\nthe  staff  concerned  are not willing  to  shoulder  their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, what plans the Ministry of Culture has in the\r\n\r\npromotion  of  various  community  cultures  and   artistic\r\n\r\nactivities? All these traditional many-splendoured cultures\r\n\r\nand  arts  should be propagated because they will  help  to\r\n\r\nenrich our cultural heritage and, at the same time, give us\r\n\r\na good image internationally, besides boosting our tourism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L.

I quite realise that in a debate, repetition\r\n\r\nis  inevitable. But in this remarkable incident, if I  were\r\n\r\nto  speak  it might appear that the Member for  Katong  had\r\n\r\nstolen my notes last night and formulated the address which\r\n\r\nhe  has so ably presented this afternoon! So I have nothing\r\n\r\nmore to add but to concur with all that the Member has said\r\n\r\nin  regard  to  policy  and to support  him  fully  in  his\r\n\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, what has the\r\n\r\nGovernment   done   in   the  encouragement   of   cultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment, and what exactly is the Government's  cultural\r\n\r\npolicy? These are questions people often ask. Frankly I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  the answer and I do not think many  do.  Indeed,\r\n\r\ndoubts  have just been expressed by the Member for  Katong.\r\n\r\nOut  of  the  total Main Estimates of $44.7 million,  $23.1\r\n\r\nmillion  or  more than 50% goes to the maintenance  of  the\r\n\r\nBroadcasting  Department; and out of the total  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  of $14.7 million. $8.5 million or close  to  60%\r\n\r\ngoes  towards  the  further expansion of  the  Broadcasting\r\n\r\nDepartment. Figuratively it would appear that the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture is primarily concerned with the promotion of TV\r\n\r\nculture. If this is the case then, rather than mislead  the\r\n\r\npeople,  I would suggest that a more appropriate title  for\r\n\r\nthe Ministry would be the Ministry of Broadcasting!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are serious about cultural development and firmly\r\n\r\nbelieve  it  to be a vital part of nation-building,  a  lot\r\n\r\nmore  effort will have to be put in. First of all,  let  us\r\n\r\nidentify  the  correct  direction of  development  so  that\r\n\r\nhopefully we could in time, have a distinctive culture that\r\n\r\nwe  can  truly call our own. I do appreciate this may  take\r\n\r\nyears,  if not generations, but then the foundation has  to\r\n\r\nbe  laid.  During the past 10 years we have done little  to\r\n\r\npatronise the arts. They have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  left largely on their own. Until today we do not have\r\n\r\na decent art gallery. Notwithstanding the small size of our\r\n\r\nRepublic. I agree with the Member for Jurong when he  spoke\r\n\r\nrecently  during the debate on the Budget that there  is  a\r\n\r\nneed and we could easily support a national academy of arts\r\n\r\nand music. But today the learning of arts and music remains\r\n\r\nlargely the privilege of the affluent few, as only they can\r\n\r\nafford the high tuition fees. Artists have no place in  our\r\n\r\nsociety.  This is reflected by the fact that seldom  do  we\r\n\r\nsee them featured in our National Day Honours list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister for Culture and the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  are frequently seen patronising Cantonese  operas\r\n\r\nperformed  by  visiting artistes, and  yet  we  ban  street\r\n\r\nwayangs which surely are much more relevant to our cultural\r\n\r\nheritage  than the imported operas. I am all  for  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  but  I  would hate to  see  all  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nbecoming economic animals lacking the ability to appreciate\r\n\r\nthe   finer  things  in  life  which  are  not  necessarily\r\n\r\nobtainable with money alone. I do not profess to be  a  man\r\n\r\nof  culture or to know very much about culture,  unlike  my\r\n\r\nHon.  Friend, the Member for Katong. But to me, quality  of\r\n\r\nlife in a society should not be measured simply in terms of\r\n\r\nper  capita  income, number of TV sets  owned,  heights  of\r\n\r\nbuildings  or  the number of chimney stacks  at  industrial\r\n\r\nestates. These materialistic things are important and vital\r\n\r\nfor  our survival, but so is the spiritual aspect of  life.\r\n\r\nGrantinq  that  economic development should  be  given  top\r\n\r\npriority  in  the context of Singapore, and  we  should  be\r\n\r\nthankful  that  the  Government  has  done  well  in   this\r\n\r\ndirection,   however  I  suspect  there  is   generally   a\r\n\r\nmisconception  that  the  promotion  of  culture   has   no\r\n\r\nrelevance to economic growth. We are doing well in tourism.\r\n\r\nI  think we can do better if there are more activities of a\r\n\r\ncultural nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many examples around the world where promotion\r\n\r\nin   cultural   activities  has  directly  and   indirectly\r\n\r\nbenefited  tourism.

Sir,  our  own  excellent\r\n\r\nefforts  in  turning the Republic into a Garden  City  have\r\n\r\nhelped  in  no small measure to draw tourists to Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to think that if we promote Culture with  the\r\n\r\nsame  heart  and  soul  as we put  into  the  promotion  of\r\n\r\nHorticulture,  I  feel  sure that the  Nation  will  derive\r\n\r\ntremendous benefits both spiritually and economically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with rapid urban redevelopment our City will soon\r\n\r\nlose  many of our traditional characteristics. Has it  ever\r\n\r\noccurred  to  the Ministry that before the bulldozers  move\r\n\r\ninto  any  one  area, it would perhaps be a  good  idea  to\r\n\r\nsystematically capture either on films or canvas personally\r\n\r\nI  would  prefer canvas so that our local painters  can  be\r\n\r\ncommissioned to do the jobs scenes that may soon be no more\r\n\r\nso  that the generations coming after us will at least have\r\n\r\nsome  idea as to the environment of their forefathers. Sir,\r\n\r\nin  many  cities  in the world permanent  open-air  display\r\n\r\ncentres  are provided for artists -painters and  sculptors.\r\n\r\nThe  provision of similar facilities at the pedestrian mall\r\n\r\nin Orchard Road is at present under active consideration by\r\n\r\nthe Urban Redevelopment Authority, but strangely enough the\r\n\r\nidea did not originate from the Ministry of Culture. Surely\r\n\r\nthere   must  be  many  other  ways  to  promote   cultural\r\n\r\nactivities which will not cost the Government too  much  if\r\n\r\nwe are too concerned about money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chiang Hai Ding -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chiang Hai Ding (Ulu Pandan):</b> Sir, after listening to\r\n\r\nthe Member for Katong, who made a very plaintive speech.  I\r\n\r\nsuspect  that the solution to his problem may  not  lie  in\r\n\r\ntransferring wine from one kind of bottle to another but in\r\n\r\ninviting the Minister to drink the wine that he offers year\r\n\r\nin  and  year  out, always under the present  circumstances\r\n\r\nwith such good spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is located at an international cross-road. It\r\n\r\nhas a relatively open society and is therefore subjected to\r\n\r\nmany cultural influences.

We  are now also engaged  in  manufacturing.\r\n\r\nindustry,  shipbuilding and repairing,  banking  and  other\r\n\r\nservices,  whereas previously our people  were  essentially\r\n\r\ntraders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process we have become collectively richer. Our\r\n\r\nGross Domestic Product at factor cost rose four times  from\r\n\r\n$3,043.4 million in 1965 to $12,831.7 million in 1975.  Our\r\n\r\nper  capita  GDP in 1965 was $1,566. By 1975 it  also  rose\r\n\r\nalmost four times to $5,917.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have an economic policy which, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jalan  Kayu has just told us, is eminently successful.\r\n\r\nWe  have  a  labour  policy, a foreign  policy,  a  defence\r\n\r\npolicy,  even  a policy for sports. In education,  as  this\r\n\r\nHouse  was  reminded,  so  forcefully  reminded,  we   have\r\n\r\npolicies galore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is our cultural policy? What are our plans and\r\n\r\nobjectives? Seventeen years have passed since we formed the\r\n\r\ngovernment, ten since we became independent. Where  are  we\r\n\r\nnow?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we culturally an identifiable people? Are there, for\r\n\r\nexample, songs that we, or our children, can all sing?  Or\r\n\r\ndances  that  they can all enjoy? Are there any  particular\r\n\r\nart  forms  that  we  have  consciously  promoted  for  our\r\n\r\npeople's appreciation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that Singaporeans are not merely people\r\n\r\nsporting short hair, most of whom should not smoke and many\r\n\r\nof whom are illiterate in two languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It pains me to propose a cut of $ 10/- from the Minister.\r\n\r\nHe needs, or his Ministry needs, every cent it can get.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that we cannot measure culture in quantitative\r\n\r\nterms.

Once that is articulated, we can discuss,  argue\r\n\r\nand  begin  to implement decisions.

Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been\r\n\r\npromoting  the concept of multi-racialism in Singapore  for\r\n\r\nmany,  many  years. In the past, most of  the  periodicals,\r\n\r\ncirculars, posters, signboards, etc, were usually  printed\r\n\r\nin  the four official language media. But, of late, this is\r\n\r\nnot  so. The periodicals, circulars, posters and signboards\r\n\r\nare  printed in either three or even in two languages. What\r\n\r\nhas  happened  to the other languages? Is the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture short of translators? Or are the other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlanguages  simply left out? I hope the Ministry of  Culture\r\n\r\nis  being fair to every language group in any printing that\r\n\r\nthey do, so that everyone knows what is happening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I want to deal with the question of the Singapore\r\n\r\nculture.  We  have  been talking so much about  building  a\r\n\r\nSingapore culture. I wonder how successful we have been  so\r\n\r\nfar  in building a Singapore culture. This is evident  only\r\n\r\nwhen our cultural troupe is sent abroad to perform, when we\r\n\r\nwould  have  the  people  from the National  Theatre  Trust\r\n\r\nrepresenting the various cultures in Singapore. Other  than\r\n\r\nthis,  there  is  nothing much to show  locally  about  our\r\n\r\nSingapore  culture.  Even TV or Radio  Singapore  for  that\r\n\r\nmatter  has not taken any step to produce any programme  in\r\n\r\nthe  four  languages. What we view in these  programmes  is\r\n\r\nthat each group looks after its own traditions and culture,\r\n\r\nIf  this continues, we will never succeed in achieving  our\r\n\r\nplan of building a Singapore culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that there should be greater coordination\r\n\r\namong  the  various  cultural organisations  with  emphasis\r\n\r\nplaced  on  the  existence of a multi-racial society.  More\r\n\r\nmulti-racial shows should be organised at different levels,\r\n\r\notherwise  each racial group would be left  to  itself  and\r\n\r\nthere would be no unity in the cultural aspect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was published in the newspapers that a Tamil film\r\n\r\nwould  be  shown at 10 o'clock last night but  it  did  not\r\n\r\nstart  until  10.1 5 p.m. Why is there this  discrimination\r\n\r\nagainst, the Tamil language?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> It is\r\n\r\nbecause of the Parliamentary Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I must thank\r\n\r\nMembers  for  showing  concern in this  subject  and  their\r\n\r\nsupport for more funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must point out to Members that cultural development and\r\n\r\ncultural activities in any society always come after  other\r\n\r\npriorities.  It  is  only after the society  is  reasonably\r\n\r\nsecure and properly educated with reasonable prospects  for\r\n\r\neconomic advancement that the society has the time and also\r\n\r\nthe  money for cultural activities. Nevertheless,  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen able to do a lot of things which we think are good for\r\n\r\nthe  development  of culture within the very  small  budget\r\n\r\nthat we are allocated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have pointed out time and again that cultural matters\r\n\r\ncannot  be quantified. It does not mean that the  more  you\r\n\r\nsquander on it the better the culture you will get. I agree\r\n\r\nwith  the Member for Jalan Kayu that a lot more effort  has\r\n\r\nto  be put in. I also agree with his remarks that a society\r\n\r\ncannot  be  measured by economic growth.  So  the  cultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  a society cannot also be measured  by  the\r\n\r\namount of money spent on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the cultural policy? I am told there is a lack of\r\n\r\nthis   cultural  policy.  But  is  this  not  better   than\r\n\r\npronouncing  an abstract policy which we can  never  fulfil\r\n\r\nbecause of lack of funds and manpower? Would it not be more\r\n\r\nrealistic to build on what we have? I am not saying that we\r\n\r\ndo  not have a cultural policy. We have, but as with things\r\n\r\ncultural,  it  is  imperceptible. What  do  we  know  about\r\n\r\nculture? What can we say about culture? What is culture? It\r\n\r\nis all over us. It is like air and water which we can never\r\n\r\nget  out  of  it. It is all around us. So a  good  cultural\r\n\r\npolicy must have a realistic footing and then build  on  it\r\n\r\nwhat  we  already  have. But what do we have?  We  have  an\r\n\r\nisland  of  two million people, the majority of  whom  have\r\n\r\nbrought  their own customs and cultures from China,  India,\r\n\r\nMalaysia and Indonesia, and an increasing number are  under\r\n\r\nthe influence of Western culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, it is obvious that our first\r\n\r\ntarget,  if  we do have a cultural policy, is  to  preserve\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have  - the good virtues which are  traditionally\r\n\r\nhanded down from generation to generation. Then we go on by\r\n\r\ntrying  to make everyone understand how the others live  or\r\n\r\nthink, so that a sense of tolerance and racial harmony  can\r\n\r\nprevail  and  with  a  respect  for  the  other's  virtues,\r\n\r\nthinking and way of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the point which the Member for Katong\r\n\r\nhas  termed \"cross-fertilisation\" among the people from the\r\n\r\ndifferent  cultural streams. I think there is  no  lack  of\r\n\r\ncross-fertilisation in our society. What  the  Broadcasting\r\n\r\nDepartment  and  the Ministry of Culture are  doing  is  to\r\n\r\nemphasise  such intermingling of different races  from  the\r\n\r\nmany cultural streams. There is no escape from this kind of\r\n\r\nintermingling in our society. Whether a person likes it  or\r\n\r\nnot,  he  is exposed to the different pulls. A Chinese  may\r\n\r\nnot  want  to  know what the Malays do in a wedding  or  in\r\n\r\ntheir  prayers, but if his neighbour is  a  Malay  who  is\r\n\r\nholding  a  wedding function, there is no escape  for  him.\r\n\r\nWhether or not he is curious, he is exposed to this  going-on in his environment. In this respect, I think there is no\r\n\r\nhindrance  to the free flow of cultural exchange.  What  we\r\n\r\nare  doing in the Ministry of Culture is to help give  this\r\n\r\nan emphasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is reflected in the TV programmes and the Radio\r\n\r\ntalks and the many other things which are undertaken by the\r\n\r\nvarious  organisations under the Ministry of  Culture.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,   the  National  Library,  through   its   branch\r\n\r\nlibraries,    organises   film    shows, lectures    and\r\n\r\ndemonstrations  on such subjects as Indian  dance.  Chinese\r\n\r\npainting and Malay music, in the four languages. There  are\r\n\r\nalso  explanations of Indian music on Radio in English  and\r\n\r\nin  other languages. I am not saying that this is going  to\r\n\r\nbe  a determining factor in promoting this intermingling or\r\n\r\nin  breaking down cultural barriers, but this has been  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the  Ministry. This is  reflected  in  all  the\r\n\r\norganisations under it and in the production of  programmes\r\n\r\non TV and Radio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that so far this has been successful and we\r\n\r\nintend to carry on this kind of development. I am sure that\r\n\r\nin  time to come and with more effort being put in  by  the\r\n\r\nvarious  people, this intermingling of different  cultures\r\n\r\nwill emerge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has asked me four questions.\r\n\r\nFirst, what are we going to do about promoting a sense  of\r\n\r\nnational  consciousness or reminding the citizens of  their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities? What are we going to do to heighten their\r\n\r\nnational pride? I would say that this is not only the  duty\r\n\r\nof  the Ministry of Culture but, in fact, it is the duty of\r\n\r\neveryone  in  this  society to help promote  this  national\r\n\r\npride and a sense of national consciousness. Of course, the\r\n\r\nexhibitions, talks and speeches that Members of  Parliament\r\n\r\ngive  in  the various community centres and functions  will\r\n\r\nhelp. But I think we must also be warned that we should not\r\n\r\nbe  naive  and  deceive  ourselves  that  by  blaring  into\r\n\r\npeople's ears we would be able to create good citizens  out\r\n\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have national pride and to make people realise their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities, we must have discipline. We  must  impose\r\n\r\ndiscipline  if something is to be done. Although publishing\r\n\r\nspeeches  will  make things easier, laws and  other  firmer\r\n\r\nmeasures  are  required. For instance, it is very  easy  to\r\n\r\nexpect  people  to  behave well in public  and  to  observe\r\n\r\ncleanliness and so on. But I doubt very much if without any\r\n\r\npenalties and fines laid down in the laws anyone of us here\r\n\r\nwould pay our tax willingly without any grudge. Without any\r\n\r\npenalties to follow up, people would not observe the  rules\r\n\r\nof cleanliness in public. I would be exaggerating the power\r\n\r\nof  my  Ministry if I say that we can actually make  people\r\n\r\nchange  their attitude overnight without firm  measures  to\r\n\r\nback  us up. If they want sugar coating, we can give it  to\r\n\r\nthem, but it is the medicine that we want them to take,  As\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese saying goes, \"Good medicine is bitter  to  the\r\n\r\nmouth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of reducing rentals for use of the\r\n\r\nNational Theatre and the Victoria Theatre, I am afraid that\r\n\r\nalthough   there   are   concession   rates   for   amateur\r\n\r\nperformances, we  cannot give concessions  in  most  cases\r\n\r\nsince the organisations are performing many different types\r\n\r\nof  variety shows, some of which are profit-making and some\r\n\r\nare  not, In this respect, it is difficult to give everyone\r\n\r\na  concession rate for use of the National Theatre and  the\r\n\r\nVictoria Theatre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of concession of entertainment duty for\r\n\r\ncultural  performances.  I  must  say  that  there  is   no\r\n\r\nconcession rate whatsoever. But there is provision for  the\r\n\r\nwaiver of entertainment duty in respect of shows which  are\r\n\r\nof  cultural and educational nature. If the shows  are  for\r\n\r\ncharitable  purposes,  the Customs  and  Excise  Department\r\n\r\nwould  also  consider waiving such duties. But  every  case\r\n\r\nwill  be  considered on its own merit and the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance  will decide whether or not entertainment duty  can\r\n\r\nbe waived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has complained that we have not used\r\n\r\nthe  four  languages  in some of our  signboards, posters,\r\n\r\ncirculars and so on. He has also pointed out that there has\r\n\r\nbeen some discrimination. He should never forget that there\r\n\r\nis no discrimination of language. This is the last thing we\r\n\r\nwill have. It is never our intention at all to discriminate\r\n\r\nour  citizens whether it be language, culture or education.\r\n\r\nThe  signboards, circulars and periodicals are not produced\r\n\r\nby  my Ministry alone but by the various Ministries.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  to  speak for the other Ministries.  But  I  can\r\n\r\nventure a guess. It may well be that they have adopted this\r\n\r\nfor  the  sake of simplicity and convenience. But  whatever\r\n\r\nthey  do,  it  is  not  done  to discriminate  against  any\r\n\r\ncommunity  in  our  society. The  purpose  of  distributing\r\n\r\npamphlets  or  putting  up signboards  is  to  make  people\r\n\r\nunderstand clearly about certain things. They may  want  to\r\n\r\nshow  people  certain places. It is to  explain  what  that\r\n\r\nplace  is.  If  they can achieve their purpose  in  a  very\r\n\r\nsimple  manner,  then they would do it. I do  not  want  to\r\n\r\nspeak  for the other Ministries, but this is what. I think,\r\n\r\nis going on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already explained, evolving a Singapore culture\r\n\r\nis  time-consuming  and  a  very slow  process.  But  while\r\n\r\nSingapore  culture is a faceless one and still  an  unknown\r\n\r\nfactor,  it  would  be  a pity to throw  away  the  various\r\n\r\ndances,  music and the colourful costumes of the dances  of\r\n\r\nour   different  races.  In  our  production  of   cultural\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  whether  on TV or through  a  presentation  of\r\n\r\ndances  by  the cultural dance troupe, we have always  been\r\n\r\nmindful of the need to project the multi-lingual and multi-cultural aspects of our society. Whether it is the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  Dance  Troupe or the  National  Theatre  Dance\r\n\r\nTroupe, this emphasis is always there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has mentioned that at present\r\n\r\nthere is a need for an art gallery. He has suggested that a\r\n\r\nNational  Academy of Arts and Music should  be  formed.  In\r\n\r\nthis respect, I must inform him that the art gallery at the\r\n\r\nNational  Museum, for which the Art Council has contributed\r\n\r\nfunds,  is  almost completed. We are putting the  finishing\r\n\r\ntouches  to it. On the question of establishing a  National\r\n\r\nAcademy  of  Arts  and Music, I must say  that  this  is  a\r\n\r\ntremendous  task. Based on the size of our population,  the\r\n\r\namount of talent that we can tap, the job opportunities for\r\n\r\nthe graduates, and so on, this may not be feasible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quite agree with the Member that artists and writers\r\n\r\nseldom appear on our National Day Honours list. However, if\r\n\r\nthey  are artists of exceptional skill and reputation, they\r\n\r\nwill  be  given due recognition. As a matter of  fact,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture is contemplating to introduce a  system\r\n\r\nof  awards to encourage people who have been active in  the\r\n\r\nfield of art and culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards street wayangs, we have never tried to ban them.\r\n\r\nOur policy is to improve the performances of street wayangs\r\n\r\nso that they will have a better content in their\r\n\r\nperformances. Although I am a lover of the Cantonese opera,\r\n\r\nI do not dislike other forms of operas. I think what has\r\n\r\nprompted the Member to say that we have banned street\r\n\r\nwayangs is that over the past year we have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreduced  the  number  of  sites for performances  of  these\r\n\r\nwayangs.  But  this was done not to ban or eliminate  these\r\n\r\noperas or wayangs but to prevent noise pollution as well as\r\n\r\nto  ease traffic congestion. As Members know, urban renewal\r\n\r\nprojects are going on in our city and many old streets have\r\n\r\ndisappeared from the street map. The sites, of course, will\r\n\r\nalso disappear. It is rather difficult for the wayang sites\r\n\r\nto  be  located  in  the new housing  estates.  Hence,  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty  of  getting  sites  for  wayangs  in  the   new\r\n\r\nenvironment.  Moreover, the residents of  the  new  housing\r\n\r\nestates  may  also not like them. They create  problems  of\r\n\r\nhealth and noise pollution. Mr Speaker, Sir, this is what I\r\n\r\ncan reply at the present moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, there\r\n\r\nare  quite  a  number  of Members who have  talked  on  the\r\n\r\nsubject  of Culture. In the Minister's reply, he  seems  to\r\n\r\nhave    forgotten   my   question   regarding   undesirable\r\n\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I am sorry, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang   has  complained  that  a  lot  of   undesirable\r\n\r\npublications  on sex and violence are on sale either  under\r\n\r\nthe counter or above the counter in the bookshops. This  is\r\n\r\nnot  the case. The Publications Section of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture  keeps  a  very close watch on publications.  Books\r\n\r\ncome  in from abroad. Hard-core pornographic books, perhaps\r\n\r\non   the   exploitation  of  sex, are  not   allowed   for\r\n\r\ndistribution in the bookshops. But the problem here is that\r\n\r\nsome books and magazines may come in under the veil of  sex\r\n\r\neducation.  As you know, with the rapid changes in  Western\r\n\r\nsocieties,  the demarcation line is so thin that  sometimes\r\n\r\nthese  books  that may be classified as sex  education  may\r\n\r\njust  slip through the net. But whatever it is, it  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  deliberate  policy of my Ministry to  allow  hard-core\r\n\r\npornography to circulate in the bookshops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained just now, the kind of activities that\r\n\r\nwe  are  going  to  have  in  the  years  to  come  include\r\n\r\ninstituting the Award\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Culture  for  meritorious activities  in  the  cultural\r\n\r\nfield.  There  would  also  be a  lot  of  exhibitions  and\r\n\r\ncultural performances that would get things going.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, as I said earlier on, not being a\r\n\r\nman  of culture, I do not know very much about culture. But\r\n\r\nI  must say that I am no wiser now than before the Minister\r\n\r\nstarted  his speech as to which direction to take. I  would\r\n\r\nrather  go  along  with  the Hon. Member  for  Ulu  Pandan.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if the Hon. Minister could draw up a concrete  plan\r\n\r\nof  cultural activities and put it to the House at the next\r\n\r\nBudget   session,  then  if  financial  support  is  really\r\n\r\nnecessary, we will all give our very active support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some Hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, turning to one or two of the\r\n\r\nspecific points that the Minister has made, on the question\r\n\r\nof  wayangs. I am not quite sure what exactly he is  trying\r\n\r\nto  imply.  I  do not know whether wayangs are directly  or\r\n\r\nindirectly  banned.  But the fact  remains  that  they  are\r\n\r\ndisappearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said that as part of the encouragement of\r\n\r\ncultural  activities, we are building on  what  we  already\r\n\r\nhave.   As   regards  dances  organised  by  the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation which has organised a lot of dances,  it  seems\r\n\r\nto  me that many of such dances have, in fact, no relevance\r\n\r\nto our cultural heritage. Take the Chinese folk dances, for\r\n\r\ninstance.  I think the majority of the Chinese in Singapore\r\n\r\nare  from the southern part of China. But you will see that\r\n\r\na  lot  of the dances organised by the People's Association\r\n\r\nfeature Mongolian dances. What sort of relevance is this? I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know. I am not a man of culture, but if  you  talk\r\n\r\nabout building on something that we have, this is not so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point on which I am very pleased to hear is that\r\n\r\nthe  National Gallery is finally going to be ready. I would\r\n\r\nlike  the  Minister to please ensure that whatever exhibits\r\n\r\nthat   we   are  going  to  have  there  will  be  properly\r\n\r\nsafeguarded because the Auditor-General\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas just drawn attention to the fact that 1 5 paintings - I  believe it is 15 - in the collection of the  National\r\n\r\nMuseum donated by members of the public over the years have\r\n\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I do not know how concrete the\r\n\r\nplans  for  cultural activities would be. As we  go  on,  I\r\n\r\nthink  I can assure Hon. Members that with good support  we\r\n\r\nwould be able to get things going in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards operas and wayangs. I regret that they are\r\n\r\nreally disappearing on the streets, First, it is because of\r\n\r\nthe lack of sites. Secondly. I think it is also because  of\r\n\r\nthe  lack of talent and lack of supporters. We can see that\r\n\r\nmany  people of the younger generation do not have as  much\r\n\r\ninterest in these wayangs as the older folks. This lack  of\r\n\r\nsupport is evident. Thirdly, very few people would like  to\r\n\r\ngo into the wayang business nowadays because learning to be\r\n\r\na  wayang actor or actress involves very hard work  indeed.\r\n\r\nOne  has  to be trained as an apprentice from a very  early\r\n\r\nage.  And in these days of full employment, it is difficult\r\n\r\nfor wayang operators to get recruits for their operas and I\r\n\r\nthink  this  also  contributes to the  decline  of  Chinese\r\n\r\nwayangs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the lack of sites, of course, this can be remedied\r\n\r\nby  offering them proper wayang stages such as the  one  in\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Theatre in Kreta Ayer. But  the  fact  still\r\n\r\nremains that less and less people want to watch wayangs and\r\n\r\nstill less want to send their children to learn this art,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards dances by the People's Association, of course,\r\n\r\nthey are trying to portray Chinese culture. There is a lack\r\n\r\nof a good choreographer in the People's Association and, in\r\n\r\nmost  cases, these dances are picked up from other  places.\r\n\r\nSo sometimes we cannot avoid the fact that they have put in\r\n\r\nthe   wrong   dances  But  whether  or  not  the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  should confine this item only to the  southern\r\n\r\nChinese  dances, I have my doubts because, at  the  present\r\n\r\nmoment, no  one  really knows what  are  the  southern  or\r\n\r\nnorthern Chinese dances, and what is a Mongolian dance. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsteps  and the movements are more or less the same; whether\r\n\r\nit  is a southern or northern Chinese dance, the difference\r\n\r\nlies  only  in  their costumes. If they  wear  a  Mongolian\r\n\r\ndress, then it looks like a Mongolian dance. If they wear a\r\n\r\nManchurian dress, then you can call it a Manchurian  dance.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that they are all Chinese dances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chiang Hai Ding -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chiang Hai Ding:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has\r\n\r\nbeen  specific and concrete about wayangs. Mongolian dances\r\n\r\nand  whatnots, He has asked us for support. I am sure  that\r\n\r\nthis  House  is  willing and is waiting  to  give  him  the\r\n\r\nsupport  if he will be able to give us concrete and precise\r\n\r\nplans and policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, if I may just be allowed to say a few\r\n\r\nwords  before I withdraw the amendment. I think it is  very\r\n\r\nclear,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Minister is himself  very\r\n\r\nconscious of the fact that his Ministry, from the  economic\r\n\r\nsense,  is  not considered worthy of receiving more  grants\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Ministry of Finance. It is our job here  to  get\r\n\r\ngreater support for the work that he is doing, and I  think\r\n\r\nthe  consensus is quite clear that we want him to get  this\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may be allowed just to go on and pick up one or\r\n\r\ntwo  points  that the Minister has made in  order  to  help\r\n\r\ntowards  giving  the Ministry of Finance an  idea  that  we\r\n\r\ncould get more money for cultural support. The Minister has\r\n\r\nsaid  that cultural activity will have its place in society\r\n\r\nand the time is when society has overcome certain financial\r\n\r\nand economic problems. I am sure the Minister must be aware\r\n\r\nof the theory of a well-known psychologist, Abraham Maslow,\r\n\r\nwho  says  that  people do not want to go above  a  certain\r\n\r\nlevel  of  needs unless a previous level of needs has  been\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily attained. In our society, I  think  we  have\r\n\r\ncome to a certain reasonable satisfaction generally of  our\r\n\r\nneeds  so  that  I  think it is time that  we  attended  to\r\n\r\ncultural  matters. I think this is the point  .--  that  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  require very much quantification or  statistics,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  a  viewpoint  that many  people  can  reasonably\r\n\r\naccept.  And  it  is  because of this viewpoint  that  many\r\n\r\nMembers here reflected the view\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  we  should get more money for the Minister to promote\r\n\r\ncultural activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal point the Minister has brought up about\r\n\r\nwhich I cannot fully agree with him but which he may differ\r\n\r\nwith me over this view, of course, is about the question of\r\n\r\nthe abstractness of the notion of culture. Of course, if we\r\n\r\nwant  to  appreciate a painting, then we get  into  several\r\n\r\ndifficulties on the aesthetic side. Take a modern painting,\r\n\r\nfor   example.  Personally,  I  must  confess  my  complete\r\n\r\nignorance about what are its aesthetic features.  It  looks\r\n\r\nto  me  as though we can get a donkey and have a brush  for\r\n\r\nhis tail and he can go round swinging his tail - put it  on\r\n\r\nto  a piece of canvas and we can get a fine piece of modern\r\n\r\nart,  probably. I do not know. But on this point, certainly\r\n\r\nwe cannot say what culture really means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to take the Minister's resemblance of\r\n\r\nculture  to air, He says \"Culture cannot be quantified.  It\r\n\r\nis  just  like air and water around us.\" But our scientists\r\n\r\nwill  tell him that he can quantify air to some extent.  We\r\n\r\ncan  have  so many cubic centimetres of air. I am not  sure\r\n\r\nbut I think air is H 20, or something like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some Hon. Members:</b> No. [Laughter]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I am sorry. That is water. There you are! I\r\n\r\nam afraid if that reflects my knowledge of culture, then  I\r\n\r\nstand  very  very  disgraced indeed. But  we  can  quantify\r\n\r\nculture.  The quantification is in the same direction  that\r\n\r\nthe  economists quantify economic development  -  how  many\r\n\r\ntelevision sets you have, how many cars you have, how  many\r\n\r\njobs  have been created, how many houses, what standard  of\r\n\r\nliving.  I  think we can quantify culture in  that  respect\r\n\r\n--how many agencies are there for the promotion of culture,\r\n\r\nhow  many people go and attend concerts, what is the spread\r\n\r\nof  the effect of the work that the Ministry has done,  how\r\n\r\nmany people watch such and such television programmes. So I\r\n\r\nthink  we  can quantify. The Ministry of Finance officials.\r\n\r\nthe  Budget people, they can be asked. They are the experts\r\n\r\nto analyse it, the systems or that kind of thing. So he can\r\n\r\nask them to help in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  quantification. As the Hon. Member for Ulu Pandan  has\r\n\r\nsaid, if on a cooperative basis, the Minister can seek some\r\n\r\nform  of  tangible policy to say that we can  go  one  step\r\n\r\nfurther, then this time next year I think we can make  the\r\n\r\nquantification.  If  the  Minister  can  come  up  with   a\r\n\r\nprogramme  then I am sure, as everybody has  said,  we  can\r\n\r\ngive  him  support for a greater allocation  of  funds  for\r\n\r\ncultural promotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some Hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I did not say that I do not want\r\n\r\nmoney for Culture. I just said that cultural affairs in any\r\n\r\ncountry always come, if not last, fairly close to the  last\r\n\r\nin the allocation of funds because of the other priorities.\r\n\r\nIn  a  country  like ours, just emerging from independence.\r\n\r\nthe  priority becomes even lower than the others. But  this\r\n\r\nis not to say that we should not do anything about culture.\r\n\r\nFor  the amount that we have been allocated in the past and\r\n\r\nfor  the kind of activities that we have carried on so far.\r\n\r\nI would say that we have done quite a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am sure there is room for improvement. In this\r\n\r\nrespect, the need is to get people more conscious  of  this\r\n\r\ncultural aspect, When I compared culture to air, I was just\r\n\r\nnot  really trying to quantify the air that we breathe  and\r\n\r\nso  on.  I  think the Member for Katong has  taken  me  too\r\n\r\nseriously. But to try and make a study of whether or not we\r\n\r\nhave culture by listing the number of air-conditioners  and\r\n\r\ntelevision  sets that we have, the number  of  people  that\r\n\r\nattend concerts and so on would make a mess of it. It would\r\n\r\neven  make it meaningless. I do not think that is  what  we\r\n\r\nwant to do. We can always call in the academicians and  the\r\n\r\nanalysts to find out whether or not Singapore has a culture\r\n\r\nand  at what stage of development has it reached. But  that\r\n\r\nis  not the purpose. It does not help us at all. As I  have\r\n\r\nsaid, culture is something that we should not try to equate\r\n\r\nit with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namount of money we have spent on it. It does not mean  that\r\n\r\nif  we  have  mere  funds, we get better culture  and  more\r\n\r\ncultural activities and if we get less, then the activities\r\n\r\nwill  come  to  nil.  Money finances only  a  part  of  the\r\n\r\ncultural  activities  of  a society.  The  rest  of  it  is\r\n\r\nundertaken by the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> After listening to the Minister.

Therefore,  we  need  to\r\n\r\ngive  every  encouragement and incentive to  the  staff  to\r\n\r\nexpress  commitment  and dedication to the  realisation  of\r\n\r\nwhatever cultural policy is decided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently certain categories of staff who are critical to\r\n\r\ngood  production  effort seem to be excluded  from  present\r\n\r\nincentive  schemes. This is a condition that prevails  also\r\n\r\nin    other   departments   besides   the   Department   of\r\n\r\nBroadcasting, but I am interested in Broadcasting  in  this\r\n\r\ncase. We have heard of schemes like merit increment schemes\r\n\r\nestablished   in   favour  of  people   with   professional\r\n\r\nqualifications like accountants, architects, engineers, and\r\n\r\nso on.

However,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  point out anomalies and  differences\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Tamil  Section  and  the  Malay/Chinese\r\n\r\nSections, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                            TV        Radio\r\n\r\nTamil Programme\r\n\r\n   Singer                   $33        $16\r\n\r\n   Instrument Player        $44        $20\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rates for artistes and dramas are as follows:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                                 Malay &\r\n\r\n                    Tamil        Chinese\r\n\r\n                   Section       Sections\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMain character       $82          $100\r\n\r\nSub-character        $50          $ 88\r\n\r\nDummy character      $20          $ 44\r\n\r\nArtiste              $33          $ 45\r\n\r\nRadio singer         $16          $ 20\r\n\r\nInstrument/singer    $44          $ 58\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no reason whatsoever for artistes performing\r\n\r\nfor  Tamil  programmes either for  the  TV  or  Radio\r\n\r\nshould be paid lower than those artistes in the other\r\n\r\nlanguage programmes. Popularity of programmes  is  no\r\n\r\nyardstick  of  the  rate  of  payment.  I  feel  that\r\n\r\nperformance should be the yardstick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To earn this meagre sum the artistes have to go\r\n\r\nthrough  six or seven rehearsals and often they  have\r\n\r\nto spend a considerable amount of time at the studios\r\n\r\nfor  rehearsals or waiting for their rehearsals. This\r\n\r\nseems  to be rather unfair to the artistes. I suggest\r\n\r\nthat  a  revision be made of the rate of payment  for\r\n\r\nthese  Tamil artistes to be paid at the same rate  as\r\n\r\nthe  artistes  in the other language  groups.  Script\r\n\r\nwriters  in  the RTS are also paid a different  rate.\r\n\r\nExperienced   writers  are  paid  higher   than   the\r\n\r\ninexperienced ones. This i~, of course, fair. I  feel\r\n\r\nthe  same  method  of payment should  also  apply  to\r\n\r\nartistes  too.  It  is  rather  unfair  to   pay   an\r\n\r\nexperienced  and good actor the same rate  as  a  new\r\n\r\nhand at the studio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I want to point out the unequal treatment\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  1'V  crew of the  Tamil  Section  for\r\n\r\noutdoor  shooting. In most cases the Section  is  not\r\n\r\ngiven   a  chance  to  shoot  outdoors  because   the\r\n\r\ntechnicians  and staff of RTS are mostly  engaged  in\r\n\r\nthe  other language groups. I hope the Minister  will\r\n\r\nsee  that  fair  treatment  is  given  to  the  Tamil\r\n\r\nSection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, quite often there are complaints that the same\r\n\r\nartistes  appear  over  and over  again  in  the  RTS\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   It   seems  that  shooting   of   Tamil\r\n\r\nprogrammes  are  done  in most instances  during  the\r\n\r\nweekdays.  Therefore,  new  part-time  artistes   are\r\n\r\nunable  to  come forward during weekdays  because  of\r\n\r\nfull-time employment. Weekends are normally  reserved\r\n\r\nfor Malay and Chinese programmes. Furthermore, if the\r\n\r\nexcuse  is  that  producers  are  not  available   on\r\n\r\nweekends  for the Tamil Section, then I suggest  that\r\n\r\nRTS   employ  part-time  producers.  This   is   done\r\n\r\nsuccessfully for the Malay programmes.  So  the  same\r\n\r\ncould  be done for the Tamil programmes too, RTS,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, could appeal for recruitment of  part-time\r\n\r\nproducers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the children's programme also needs improvement.\r\n\r\nWeek  after  week  the  same setup  is  seen.  It  is  very\r\n\r\nartificial.  What you will notice is a person  narrating  a\r\n\r\nstory, and that's just about it. It seems that this Section\r\n\r\nlacks imagination. Perhaps if they could watch some of  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes  like \"Sesame Street\" on Sundays,  they  may  be\r\n\r\nable to get ideas for our children's programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Tamil and Chinese films shown on TV during\r\n\r\nthe weekdays, no doubt are commendable. But I am afraid the\r\n\r\nchoice  is rather poor. The films are so old, and it  is  a\r\n\r\nwell  known fact that some of the actors and actresses  are\r\n\r\nno  longer  living.  I also note that  some  of  these  old\r\n\r\nTeochew  films  are  constantly repeated.  It  is  time  TV\r\n\r\nSingapore acquired more recent films both for the Tamil and\r\n\r\nChinese  sections and, if possible, to screen colour  films\r\n\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ch'ng is not here. Dr Ong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Sir, I take this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to bring up two points on which  the  Minister\r\n\r\nmight like to enlighten this House,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is to lend my support to those Members\r\n\r\npresent  here  who  have  voiced dissatisfaction  with  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  production and the lack of sophistication  in\r\n\r\nthe  direction of programmes that are produced  locally.  I\r\n\r\nrecognise that our Broadcasting Department is in many  ways\r\n\r\nin  the stage of infancy and perhaps, because of a shortage\r\n\r\nof  personnel,  we  will not be able just  now  to  produce\r\n\r\nprogrammes  of  a reasonable standard. I am not  trying  to\r\n\r\ncompare  the  programmes that we have produced  locally  to\r\n\r\nthose  of  the  NBC  or the BBC. But a better  standard  of\r\n\r\nproduction   would  be  consistent  with   the   stage   of\r\n\r\ndevelopment,   the   level   of  education,   the   general\r\n\r\nsophistication  of  this  country  and  its  people.  I  am\r\n\r\nfrequently appalled by the programmes, and I would like the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  enlighten this House on the  steps  that  the\r\n\r\nBroadcasting  Department is taking or shall  be  taking  in\r\n\r\nthis direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter which has been disturbing me is the\r\n\r\nfact  that not so long ago an afternoon newspaper came  out\r\n\r\nwith a headline report which we all discovered later to  be\r\n\r\nrather mischievous - I refer to a report which stated  that\r\n\r\nRadio  and TV licences were to be increased by two to four-fold.  I recognise that this need not necessarily be within\r\n\r\nthe  portfolio of the Ministry of Culture. But  one  cannot\r\n\r\ndeny that the Broadcasting Department is under the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turns out today, more than a month later, there has\r\n\r\nbeen  no  increase  in  TV or Radio  licence  fees  and  no\r\n\r\nquadrupling  of  the licence fee for colour television,  am\r\n\r\nnot  saying that we should increase the fee for colour  and\r\n\r\nblack  and  white  television or radio. I think  we  should\r\n\r\nmaintain the status quo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would say that the timing of that release in\r\n\r\nthe  press  was  very unfortunate in that  it  was  closely\r\n\r\nlinked with other tax increases in this country. That  gave\r\n\r\nrise  to a lot of unhappiness, a lot of talk and a  lot  of\r\n\r\nunnecessary problems to various people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have yet to read a statement from the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture or the Ministry of Finance saying that that  report\r\n\r\nwas  unfounded  and mischievous. I am beginning  to  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  in  fact,  the  Ministry of  Culture  was  quietly\r\n\r\ndelighted  that  that  report came out  and  therefore  the\r\n\r\npublic  is \"conditioned.\" so to speak, to further increases\r\n\r\nin  licence  fees.  I  suggest  that  if  that  report  was\r\n\r\nmisleading, as it must be so many weeks after, then  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility of the Ministry of Culture to come  out\r\n\r\nwith  a  statement  refuting the  allegations  and  thereby\r\n\r\nclearing the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I rise to speak on the\r\n\r\nsub-standard performance of the RTS in relation to its News\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  It  is a matter which is entirely  within  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of the RTS and which can be put right without  any\r\n\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to the slipshod manner in which TV News and\r\n\r\nNewsreel are broadcast. Wrong pictures are flashed  on  the\r\n\r\nscreen while some other news captions or reports are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing read out. A good example would be the TV coverage  of\r\n\r\nthe  present  Parliamentary session. The  coverage  may  be\r\n\r\ncreating  an  impression that some of the Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse have exchanged names with one another!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is that if the RTS personnel are not\r\n\r\nsufficiently conversant with local events and personalities\r\n\r\nto  match  pictures and captions of local events,  how  can\r\n\r\nthey  be  relied upon to do wider coverage of foreign  news\r\n\r\nwith  which  they  can  be presumed to  be  less  familiar?\r\n\r\nMisleading information is worse than no-information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I must thank the Member for\r\n\r\nAljunied   for  bringing  to  my  attention  the  erroneous\r\n\r\nidentification of MPs in TV coverage. I must apologise  for\r\n\r\nthis.  I  agree  with him that this is a  slipshod  way  of\r\n\r\npresenting  the  photographs of MPs. I  myself  was  rather\r\n\r\nannoyed  to see my colleagues appearing on the screen  with\r\n\r\ndifferent  names. We will take action on this, and  I  will\r\n\r\nget the person responsible for it reprimanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reply to the very important point regarding TV\r\n\r\nlicence fees raised by the Member for Kim Seng. My Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  never put up any proposal for the revision or increase\r\n\r\nof  TV  or  Radio licence fees. As Members are  aware,  the\r\n\r\nauthority  empowered  to  impose taxes  and  to  revise  or\r\n\r\nincrease licence fees lies with the Ministry of Finance. As\r\n\r\nwe  all know, the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech\r\n\r\nhas  not  mentioned anything about the increase  of  TV  or\r\n\r\nRadio  licence fees and I think we can take it as confirmed\r\n\r\nthat there is no increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Member for Kim Seng has gone further to ask\r\n\r\nme  that we must make some clarification on this. It is the\r\n\r\nNew  Nation which has published this speculative report.  I\r\n\r\ncannot  be responsible for what the New Nation may  or  may\r\n\r\nnot  print. If we were to jump up on any speculative report\r\n\r\nthat   the  newspapers  may  print  and  quickly  issue   a\r\n\r\nconfirmation or denial on what they print, then life  would\r\n\r\nbe  very difficult for us in Government. There are hundreds\r\n\r\nof  reports  and  stories which the various newspapers  may\r\n\r\nprint daily, but that does not mean that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have  an obligation to issue any denial or confirmation\r\n\r\nof  those reports. This would really be a waste of time. If\r\n\r\na report of a newspaper has not turned out to be the truth,\r\n\r\nit  would  be  better to leave it to the  readers  to  take\r\n\r\nwhatever action they want to. They have themselves  created\r\n\r\nthis  credibility gap and they will have to answer  to  the\r\n\r\nreaders.  We  cannot be made responsible for that  kind  of\r\n\r\nspeculative reports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point which we must make clear. For the sake\r\n\r\nof  an efficient Government, we cannot run a Government  by\r\n\r\nconfirming or denying newspaper reports. Otherwise, we will\r\n\r\nhave a Government by newspapers and not by a Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong has raised the point about an\r\n\r\nincentive  scheme  for  the News  Producers  and  Programme\r\n\r\nProducers  in the Broadcasting Department. I am  afraid  we\r\n\r\nare not able to consider this at the present moment because\r\n\r\nthe number of people involved is very small and they are in\r\n\r\na specialised field. It is also very difficult to judge the\r\n\r\nperformance of a particular person in the production  of  a\r\n\r\nprogramme because in the production of a programme a number\r\n\r\nof  people  are  involved. We need a good  coordination  of\r\n\r\nsupporting staff in order to produce a programme. There  is\r\n\r\nsomeone  in charge of the wardrobes; someone in  charge  of\r\n\r\nlighting; the engineers, the script writers and so on.  How\r\n\r\nare  we  going  to  judge the performance of  a  particular\r\n\r\nperson if we were to have this incentive scheme? However, I\r\n\r\nam  not saying that we are not going to consider this idea.\r\n\r\nAs  the  staff of the Broadcasting Department grows and  as\r\n\r\nthe  method  to  measure  the  performance  of  the  people\r\n\r\nconcerned  becomes possible, then that may be the  time  to\r\n\r\nconsider such a scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng has complained of the low\r\n\r\nstandard  of  production and the lack of sophistication  in\r\n\r\nour  programmes. Here I must agree that there is  room  for\r\n\r\nimprovement.  When he says that the standard of  production\r\n\r\nis  low  and  lacks sophistication, I presume  that  he  is\r\n\r\nreferring  to  the content of the programmes  and  not  the\r\n\r\ntechnical side of the programmes. If the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nengineers and technicians are rated \"low\" in their standard\r\n\r\nof  production, the Member for Kim Seng will not be able to\r\n\r\nwatch  any programme on the TV screen. He will get a  blank\r\n\r\nscreen. So I presume he is referring to the content of  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we must agree that the workforce in the\r\n\r\nproduction of programmes is comparatively new to  the  kind\r\n\r\nof  media that they are handling and also, with the lack of\r\n\r\ngood  script writers and directors, it is sometimes  rather\r\n\r\ndifficult to achieve the degree of sophistication  that  we\r\n\r\nwant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coupled with this is the lack of professional actors and\r\n\r\nactresses  and  good  professional  singers  and   so   on.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is rather difficult to produce a programme of\r\n\r\na very high standard. Most of the actors and actresses that\r\n\r\nwe engage are amateurs and so their performance, shown side\r\n\r\nby  side with imported programmes, like those from the  BBC\r\n\r\nor NBC, will show itself to be rather poor. I must say that\r\n\r\nmaking a comparison with imported programmes is not fair if\r\n\r\none  considers the amount of money that foreign TV stations\r\n\r\nspend  on  a  particular programme and the amount  that  we\r\n\r\nspend on our own production of a programme. There is really\r\n\r\nno  comparison  at all. A fairer comparison  would  be  our\r\n\r\nprogrammes   with   those  programmes   produced   by   our\r\n\r\nneighbouring  stations. Then the standard of production  of\r\n\r\nour programmes would become obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has raised this point about\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  against Tamil actors and  singers.  I  must\r\n\r\nvery seriously point out that there is no discrimination at\r\n\r\nall  in  the fees paid to the performers, whether they  are\r\n\r\nEnglish-speaking,  Tamil-speaking  or  Malay-speaking   and\r\n\r\nwhether they appear in a Malay, Chinese or Tamil programme.\r\n\r\nThere  is no discrimination at all. There is only one table\r\n\r\nof  fees in the RTS and that table of fees applies to every\r\n\r\none group. The difference of fees applies to the grades.  I\r\n\r\nam  sure the Member will agree that in the case of an actor\r\n\r\nthere  are the leading actor, supporting actor  and  the\r\n\r\ntemporary actors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho are just one of the crowd in the background - we cannot\r\n\r\npay every one the same fee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are singers with international reputation.\r\n\r\nThere  are  also  singers of a low grade.  There  are  also\r\n\r\namateur  singers, and so on. If there is any difference  of\r\n\r\nfees  at all, it is based on the grade or according to  the\r\n\r\nperformance  of the actors, and not based on  the  language\r\n\r\nthat they speak or according to the programme in which they\r\n\r\nappear.  That is complete nonsense. In fact, we  are  doing\r\n\r\nwhat the Member for Anson has suggested\r\n\r\n-  that  is to be fair. In the case of The script  writers,\r\n\r\nthe  experienced script writers get higher  fees  than  the\r\n\r\ninexperienced  ones.  The  same  principle  apples  to  the\r\n\r\nactors, dancers, singers and others,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also complained of the many rehearsals\r\n\r\nneeded  for the singers. It is very `unusual for an artiste\r\n\r\nor  a singer to be asked to rehearse six or seven times. If\r\n\r\nthat is so, the artiste or the performer must be a very bad\r\n\r\none and, therefore, requires extra rehearsals. That may  be\r\n\r\nthe reason why he or she is paid a very low fee. Normally a\r\n\r\ngood  performer, especially a professional one, needs  only\r\n\r\none or two rehearsals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to outdoor facilities, there is also no\r\n\r\ndiscrimination against the Tamil stream. We  have  a  small\r\n\r\ncrew  of  outdoor cameramen. With their limited facilities,\r\n\r\nthey  are  mainly used for the production of  newsreel  and\r\n\r\ndocumentaries. As Members know, newsreels and documentaries\r\n\r\nare  transmitted in the four language streams. There is  no\r\n\r\ndiscrimination against the Tamil stream. There is  actually\r\n\r\nno  discrimination  at  all. The problem  is  the  lack  of\r\n\r\nfacilities. Because of this, we have to concentrate on  the\r\n\r\nproduction   of  more  meaningful  programmes,   that   is.\r\n\r\nnewsreels and educational documentaries,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the children's programmes, I agree that\r\n\r\nthere  is  room  for improvement. Here again,  it  is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult to produce a children's programme as children are\r\n\r\nunpredictable in their temperament, and it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery  difficult to coach them. If we compare our children's\r\n\r\nprogramme with Sesame Street. I do not think we can measure\r\n\r\nup  to  the quality of that programme because Sesame Street\r\n\r\nis   produced  by  an  organisation  specialised   in   the\r\n\r\nproduction of children's educational programmes. Experts in\r\n\r\nmany  fields are involved in this quality production. I  am\r\n\r\nnot  saying  that  we should not improve  our  standard  of\r\n\r\nproduction. The Sesame Street production has got a  lot  of\r\n\r\nexperts  to  support it, for example, educationists, child\r\n\r\npsychologists, writers, artists, composers, choreographers.\r\n\r\ndramatists;  all  kinds  of  talent  are  involved  in  the\r\n\r\nproduction  of that programme. In our case all we  have  is\r\n\r\nthe  programme producer or, at the most, the script  writer\r\n\r\nor the assistant script writer to do the work,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has asked why we screen films that are very\r\n\r\nold.  The RTS has to hire these feature films from the film\r\n\r\nproducing  companies. Now, we are actually  competing  with\r\n\r\nthe  cinemas  or  the  film  producing  companies  for  our\r\n\r\naudience.  It  is, therefore, only natural that  they  only\r\n\r\nallow  us to have films which they think have lost the  box\r\n\r\noffice  appeal. Most of the films which we  can  hire  from\r\n\r\nthem are more than 10 years old. Of course, they have spent\r\n\r\nmillions of dollars to produce the films, and if they think\r\n\r\nthat  certain  films can still attract the  audience,  they\r\n\r\nwould keep them for themselves to show them in the cinemas.\r\n\r\nThey would not want to release them to a television station\r\n\r\nbecause  once the television station has screened the  film\r\n\r\nthen  everyone would have seen it and the box office appeal\r\n\r\nwhatever little there is would be lost. It is only  natural\r\n\r\nand business-like for these companies to try and prevent us\r\n\r\nfrom getting better films from them. The acquiring of films\r\n\r\nis  a  never-ending conflict between a TV station  and  the\r\n\r\nfilm-producing  companies and also the cinemas.  The  film-producing  companies  and  the  cinemas  are  very  closely\r\n\r\nconnected   with  each  other.  Of  `course,  the   cinemas\r\n\r\nthemselves are very reluctant to see the TV station getting\r\n\r\nall the good films because it means that we are drawing the\r\n\r\naudience away from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

That also is nonsense! The pictures  screened\r\n\r\nare  very  old. That also is nonsense! If the  Broadcasting\r\n\r\nDepartment does not pay more for the films how can  it  get\r\n\r\nnew  films? It does not want to pay for them. It is willing\r\n\r\nto  pay  only $100 and yet it expects to get a new picture.\r\n\r\nHow  can they get it? Naturally the film companies will not\r\n\r\ngive  it  to them. There must be a contract with  the  film\r\n\r\ncompanies   to  get  the  films.  That  also  is  nonsense.\r\n\r\nEverything is nonsense, and then what happen's?

As\r\n\r\nthere  was  no  discrimination, I said that it  was  really\r\n\r\nnonsense to suggest it, because it did not exist at all  in\r\n\r\nour  station. I did not say that what he has said about the\r\n\r\nBroadcasting Department screening old films is nonsense. It\r\n\r\nis true that we are screening very old films.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already explained why we are screening old films.\r\n\r\nIt  is not that we do not have the money for new films.  We\r\n\r\nhave,  but they just could not be found. They are jealously\r\n\r\nguarded  by the film companies which want to keep them  for\r\n\r\ndistribution  to  the  cinemas where they  can  get  better\r\n\r\nvalue.  Only those films which have lost their  box  office\r\n\r\nappeal  would  be  released  for  distribution  to  the  TV\r\n\r\nstations.  These are films which almost everyone  has  seen\r\n\r\nand if they were to be screened in the cinemas no one would\r\n\r\nwant  to  see.  This does not only happen in Singapore.  It\r\n\r\nhappens  all over the world. Whether you go to  the  United\r\n\r\nStates,  Australia, Taiwan, or Japan, you  will  find  that\r\n\r\nonly the old feature films which are more than 10 years old\r\n\r\nare available in the market for screening on TV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, TV stations counter this practice by producing\r\n\r\ntheir  own  programmes  in their own studios.  The  present\r\n\r\ntrend is for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany  TV  stations not to rely very much on  feature  films\r\n\r\nfrom  the film companies. They produce their own films  and\r\n\r\nprogrammes, and because of this they are less vulnerable to\r\n\r\nthis kind of boycott by the film companies. But since we do\r\n\r\nnot  have  a  film  industry in Singapore, we  are  really\r\n\r\nvulnerable  to this boycott. For instance, where  does  the\r\n\r\nTeochew films come from? They come from Hong Kong. That  is\r\n\r\nthe  only  place which produces Teochew films  and  nowhere\r\n\r\nelse.  There  is  a limited number of these  films  in  the\r\n\r\nmarket. That is why sometimes we have to use old films  and\r\n\r\nsometimes we have to re-screen them. But in most  cases  we\r\n\r\nrepeat  the  screening only once, whether it is  a  Teochew\r\n\r\nfilm or other films.

But the impression I get lately is that  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen    an   increase   in   the   number   of   commercial\r\n\r\nadvertisements. I can well understand that  if  we  do  not\r\n\r\nhave so many advertisements, the Government would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprobably  say that the licence fees should go up.

It is repeated to such  an\r\n\r\nextent that we can even hear some of the tunes being hummed\r\n\r\nnot  only  by children but also by grown-ups.

Perhaps  the  same  advertisements  should  not  be\r\n\r\nrepeated  so frequently on the same day or even during  the\r\n\r\nshort space of half an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, arising from the\r\n\r\nreply by the Minister.

If only he had listened  to  what  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  he  would  know that I did not at any  time  suggest\r\n\r\nthat. All that I said was that we should try to improve the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  production and direction of our  Broadcasting\r\n\r\nDepartment. I asked him if he could inform this House  what\r\n\r\nsteps  are  being taken to make sure that the  Broadcasting\r\n\r\nDepartment  keeps on improving its standard  of  television\r\n\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his reply on the second matter, I must say\r\n\r\nthat  it  is wonderful to hear from a Member of the Cabinet\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  does not  jump  on  any  speculative\r\n\r\nreport. However, it is my impression, and I am convinced of\r\n\r\nthis,  that this Government is very sensitive to any public\r\n\r\ncomment,  It  is  very sensitive to any  criticism  in  the\r\n\r\npress.  We  have examples of this. When somebody  writes  a\r\n\r\nletter  to a certain press, within a week there is a reply.\r\n\r\nI  am  saying  that  the  report which  came  out  in  that\r\n\r\nparticular  newspaper  was not just a  report  tucked  away\r\n\r\nsomewhere  in  the  middle pages, it  was  headline  news.\r\n\r\nBecause of that,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  felt  that  it  was appropriate for  Government  to\r\n\r\nreply  on  that score.

Most\r\n\r\nof  the  lady artistes are scantily dressed?  Some  of\r\n\r\nthem  are  almost half-naked, looking as if  they  are\r\n\r\nfeeling  uncomfortably  hot, although  the  studio  is\r\n\r\ncool  as  it  is  airconditioned.  The  way  they  are\r\n\r\ndressed  seems to suggest that they are  feeling  very\r\n\r\nhot.  The impression is that if they are dressed  from\r\n\r\nthe  waist down, then the upper half is bare.  If  the\r\n\r\nupper  half  is dressed then the lower  half  is  very\r\n\r\nscantily  covered. If we allow this sort of  thing  to\r\n\r\ngo  on,  it  means that in future we could  be  seeing\r\n\r\nobscene  programmes. All this would lower the  quality\r\n\r\nand  standard  of  the  Malay TV  shows.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will take note of this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, the Member for Jalan Kayu\r\n\r\nhas   raised  the  point  that  there  are  too   many\r\n\r\nadvertisements  on  TV.  Advertisements  are   revenue\r\n\r\nearners, and the demand for specific screening  times,\r\n\r\nof  course, reflects the popularity of the programmes.\r\n\r\nThe  more  popular  a programme is,  the  greater  the\r\n\r\naudience.   Therefore,  if  more  advertisements   are\r\n\r\nreceived  for screening during a particular programme.\r\n\r\nit  shows that more people like to see that programme.\r\n\r\nThe  advertisers naturally want to take  advantage  of\r\n\r\nthe  wide  audience  and  they  want  to  spend  their\r\n\r\nadvertising  costs  in as efficient  and  effective  a\r\n\r\nmanner  as possible, and that is to catch the greatest\r\n\r\nnumber  of  audience. In this case, if  they  were  to\r\n\r\nspend  money on TV advertisement, well, I do not think\r\n\r\nwe  should  refuse them and say that we  do  not  want\r\n\r\ntheir  advertising money, so long as their advertising\r\n\r\nfilmlets are decent and meet with approved standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What really happens is that an advertiser thinks\r\n\r\nthat  the  more  his advertisement  is  repeated,  the\r\n\r\nbetter  it would be for the message to be conveyed  to\r\n\r\nthe  consumer. So they normally pay quite a lot to get\r\n\r\nthe message across. TV is only a medium offered\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  use  by the advertisers. We do not want to repeat  the\r\n\r\nadvertisements or have too many of them, but if  they  keep\r\n\r\non coming, well, it is also difficult to resist them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have different rates for advertising. We have\r\n\r\nadvertisements  at  the  normal  rate  which  appear  on  a\r\n\r\nrotational basis. This means that the advertiser  does  not\r\n\r\nmind  whether his advertisement is flashed in the programme\r\n\r\nHawaii  Five-0  or  in a midnight show. For  such  kind  of\r\n\r\nadvertising,  the  normal rate is applied.  But  where  the\r\n\r\nadvertiser is very particular about this and wants to catch\r\n\r\nthe   greatest  number  of  audience  during  a  particular\r\n\r\nprogramme, then he wants his commercials to appear in  that\r\n\r\nparticular programme. If he wants that, then he has to  pay\r\n\r\na  very  much higher rate. Sometimes it is as  much  as  2\ufffd\r\n\r\ntimes the normal rate. So if the advertiser is prepared  to\r\n\r\npay  that exorbitant rate, I think there is no good  reason\r\n\r\nto   stop   him,  All  we  have  to  ensure  is  that   the\r\n\r\nadvertisement,  the  phrases, the  music  in  the  filmlets\r\n\r\nconform to the approved standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai complained about the\r\n\r\ncostumes of the Malay dancers, We have very strict rules on\r\n\r\ncostumes.  But we are not strict to the extent of measuring\r\n\r\nthe  length of the skirt or assess the suitability  of  the\r\n\r\ndress  that the artistes wear. We do have some  sort  of  a\r\n\r\nstrict  code  to  ensure that the costumes for  dancers  or\r\n\r\nsingers are very decent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng came back on the increase in\r\n\r\nlicence   fees.   Any  Government  should  be   politically\r\n\r\nsensitive.  It must be quick in reacting to any  situation.\r\n\r\nBut  I  am  not  saying  that we  must  reply  to  all  the\r\n\r\nirresponsible speculations. If there are complaints in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers and if the officials find that they are  genuine\r\n\r\nand  legitimate complaints, then they will reply  promptly.\r\n\r\nThat  does not mean that irresponsible speculations in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers have to be replied, promptly or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, the Hon.

But we know that insecticide  contains\r\n\r\nDDT,  and it is poisonous. This is no good. This is  not  a\r\n\r\nhealthy commercial advertisement. The Programmes Section of\r\n\r\nTV Singapore must select and censor such advertisements. If\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  have such censorship or selection,  then  such\r\n\r\nadvertisements   will  harm  our  people.   Otherwise   the\r\n\r\nadvertisers will take Singaporeans to be idiots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on national campaigns. We have\r\n\r\na  lot  of  slogans  such as those on  National  Day  which\r\n\r\nstimulate  our people to respond to our national  call  for\r\n\r\neconomic  development  and social  progress.  Such  slogans\r\n\r\nshould  be  included  in  our TV  programmes  as  often  as\r\n\r\npossible. In addition, there are organisations that work in\r\n\r\nthe  society for meaningful purposes. For example, the  MCs\r\n\r\nand  CCCs offer scholarships, bursaries and so on and  also\r\n\r\nthere  are  other commercial and professional organisations\r\n\r\nwhich  also  have  got scholarships, bursaries  to  develop\r\n\r\nacademic  pursuits and talent for our country. TV Singapore\r\n\r\nshould capture and publicise all these awards including the\r\n\r\naward  ceremony so that the people are made aware  of  such\r\n\r\nevents as they are good for our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also a lot of heroic acts. For example, someone\r\n\r\nhas saved a life; this taxi-driver has found a lot of money\r\n\r\nfrom  his taxi and has returned all of it to the owner.  We\r\n\r\nshould  publicise and encourage such acts  of  heroism  and\r\n\r\nhonesty in our TV programmes so that the younger generation\r\n\r\nand  all  other  members of our society will be  inculcated\r\n\r\nwith the right attitude and sense of social responsibility.\r\n\r\nThis is good for the society and is important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in the process of nation building.

As a result,  in\r\n\r\ntime to come, we will not make a profit. This goes round in\r\n\r\na  circle and is a very interesting topic. We must consider\r\n\r\nthis  problem carefully. Just now the Member for Jalan Kayu\r\n\r\nhas brought up the matter and I have not heard a very clear\r\n\r\nreply to that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must have a certain proportion of commercial\r\n\r\nadvertisements in our programmes. Nevertheless, there  must\r\n\r\nbe a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyardstick. For example, in one hour of programme, how  many\r\n\r\ncommercial  advertisements should we allow, We should  also\r\n\r\nbe fair to the advertisers, If we just take their money and\r\n\r\nnot  consider their interest, it would appear that this  is\r\n\r\nnot very honest. So I hope the Minister has a very balanced\r\n\r\njudgment  with  regard  to  commercial  advertisements.  He\r\n\r\nshould pay regard to the requirement of the viewers as well\r\n\r\nas  the advertisers, We should have a good balance in  this\r\n\r\nregard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, as much as we want to have more\r\n\r\nrevenue, we do also see to it that our programme  is  of  a\r\n\r\ngood   quality  and  that  the  advertisement   commercials\r\n\r\nappearing on TV screens are of a decent nature. We have  no\r\n\r\ncontrol on the products that they want to sell except those\r\n\r\nwhich  are  prohibited  by law, for  instance,  cigarettes,\r\n\r\ntobacco and so on. They are not allowed to be advertised on\r\n\r\nTV  or over the radio or in any newspaper. So long as  they\r\n\r\nhave a product to sell and the commercial is presented in a\r\n\r\ndecent manner, conforming to the approved standard, we will\r\n\r\nallow them to advertise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a code in RTS for the type of song and the length\r\n\r\nof hair and so on, all described in great detail. There are\r\n\r\ncertain things that we accept and certain things that we do\r\n\r\nnot.  We do not control the kind of product that they  want\r\n\r\nto  sell. So long as the commercial is of a decent  nature,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no reason why we should not accept  it,  As  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Kampong Kapor has pointed out,  sometimes  the\r\n\r\ncommercials  are  of  a very childish nature;  Mortem,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  They take the people of Singapore to be  idiots.\r\n\r\nBut   if  the  products  that  they  are  selling  are  not\r\n\r\nprohibited,  there is no reason why we have  to  turn  them\r\n\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any one-hour programme there is a maximum of three\r\n\r\nbreaks.  In  each  there can be as  many  as  five  or  six\r\n\r\ncommercials. In any case, the length of commercials is such\r\n\r\nthat  it  should not tip the balance of good programmes  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of  these  commercials. We try to maintain  a  very\r\n\r\nstrict  balance on this. I do not think that  we  have  too\r\n\r\nmany commercials in our programmes. Maybe the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember  is  referring to those very popular programmes  and\r\n\r\nsince, as I have said, many advertisers want to pay  a  lot\r\n\r\nmore  to  take  full  advantage of the  popularity  of  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  it appears that there are a lot of commercials\r\n\r\nin  those  programmes. If one were to switch  over  to  the\r\n\r\nother  programmes, like documentaries or programmes  of  an\r\n\r\neducational  value, then one can hardly see any commercials\r\n\r\nat  all.  There  are certain programmes which  specifically\r\n\r\nexclude  commercials, say, a programme  of  educational  or\r\n\r\ncultural  value. There are no commercials at all  appearing\r\n\r\nin these programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the suggestion by the Member for Bras Basah that\r\n\r\nwe  should have the commercials either before or after  the\r\n\r\nprogramme, it is rather difficult to implement this because\r\n\r\nthe advertisers are not stupid, If they have to spend their\r\n\r\nmoney, they want to spend it wisely. They all know that  if\r\n\r\nwe  are  to  put  all the commercials as suggested  by  the\r\n\r\nMember, then the audience would not switch on and view  the\r\n\r\nadvertisements before the programme and wait  to  see  more\r\n\r\ncommercials  before switching it off. So it would  come  to\r\n\r\nnothing. The advertisers want to catch the attention of the\r\n\r\naudience and there is no better way of doing this  than  to\r\n\r\nflash their commercials during a programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Member for Kampong Kapor for putting various\r\n\r\nsuggestions  as  to  how the TV programmes  can  be  better\r\n\r\nutilised by including reports of the various activities  in\r\n\r\nthe  constituencies. I think the constituencies  are  given\r\n\r\nquite a lot of coverage in this respect, like the functions\r\n\r\norganised by the Citizens' Consultative Committees  or  the\r\n\r\nManagement Committees of community centres. They are  given\r\n\r\nprominence  in the newsreels. Although we may not  want  to\r\n\r\nmake  these  as feature films, now and then he can  see  in\r\n\r\nNewsreel people being awarded for scholarships from the CCC\r\n\r\nmembers   or   even  from  Members  of  Parliament.   These\r\n\r\nactivities do get some coverage on TV in Newsreel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the slogans on National Day that we should\r\n\r\nemphasise on TV. I say that we want to convey this  message\r\n\r\nacross  to the public but we will have to do it in  a  more\r\n\r\nsubtle  way than just blaring it through the radio and  TV.\r\n\r\nOn  the  occasion of the National Day celebrations we  have\r\n\r\nthese  slogans  painted  on banners  and  hung  across  the\r\n\r\nstreet.  But if we want to convey the message daily, there\r\n\r\nare  more subtle ways than just flashing the slogans on the\r\n\r\nTV screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think it is a good time to take the\r\n\r\nSuspension now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and\r\n\r\ntook the Chair of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

This is a different point.\r\n\r\nSir,   some   of  the  newsreaders  over  TV   and   radio,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in the Tamil and English sections,  make  far\r\n\r\ntoo  many  mistakes. Some of the readers, particularly  the\r\n\r\nnew recruits, seem to make terrible mistakes. I wonder what\r\n\r\nis  the  basis of selection of newsreaders. How  are  these\r\n\r\npeople selected? How are they trained, and for how long are\r\n\r\nthey  trained  before they are put on the  job  before  the\r\n\r\ncamera  or  the  microphone? Could the Minister  elaborate?\r\n\r\nLast night when the speech of the Member for Henderson  was\r\n\r\nbroadcast  over  TV  the  photograph  of  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nSembawang was flashed over the TV screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I could not agree with the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson more that the standard of our newsreaders is far\r\n\r\nfrom perfect. In fact, this has been a serious problem  and\r\n\r\nis  rated very high among our priorities for improvement of\r\n\r\nthe standard of the broadcasting. The problem is that it is\r\n\r\nnot  easy  to get the right kind of people for training  as\r\n\r\nnewsreaders. A good newsreader is not someone whom you  can\r\n\r\npick  up  from any one of the school leavers and train  him\r\n\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be a good newsreader, first, he must have a very good\r\n\r\nvoice.  Second, having that voice, he must be  able  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  a  course  of'  education  and  acquire   a   good\r\n\r\npronunciation  and good diction either in  English.  Tamil,\r\n\r\nMalay or Mandarin. After this, he must also be prepared  to\r\n\r\nbe  trained  as a newsreader. Even with all these  aptitude\r\n\r\ntests,  it  is sometimes difficult to get the right  person\r\n\r\nfor the job. I will give an example of how difficult it  is\r\n\r\nfor us to get good news readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in the last recruitment exercise held in\r\n\r\nMarch  last  year  for Tamil newsreaders. 206  applied  for\r\n\r\naudition  and,  of  that  number, 179  turned  up  for  the\r\n\r\naudition,  and only one passed. After further  training  he\r\n\r\nwas put on the air. Because of this poor result and because\r\n\r\nof the need, for newsreaders, 13 who had shown some promise\r\n\r\nin  the  audition were selected to undergo training.  After\r\n\r\nthree months of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncoaching, nine failed to make any satisfactory progress and\r\n\r\nhad  to be rejected. Out of the remaining four, three  have\r\n\r\nimproved  considerably and have since been  placed  on  the\r\n\r\nnewsreading  roster. The other one is still under  training\r\n\r\nand may eventually make the grade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of English newsreaders, an exercise was\r\n\r\nconducted in April last year for part-time newsreaders. 914\r\n\r\napplied  for auditioning but only 714 turned up,  and  only\r\n\r\neight  were found acceptable for training. Of these  eight,\r\n\r\nonly  two so far have been found satisfactory and they  are\r\n\r\nnow rostered for newsreading. Of the remaining six, one has\r\n\r\nalready been found not suited for newsreading and the other\r\n\r\nhas  informed RTS that he is not interested in the job  any\r\n\r\nmore. So that leaves us with only four persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not that we are not conscious of this need for a\r\n\r\ngood  standard  of  newsreading,  and  we  are  continually\r\n\r\nendeavouring to search for the right people with the  right\r\n\r\nvoice   and  with  good  pronunciation  for  the   job   of\r\n\r\nnewsreaders,  but  such people are not available.  Why  are\r\n\r\nthey  not  available? I do not know. Maybe  it  is  because\r\n\r\nEnglish  is  not the mother tongue of the majority  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  We  also find that even those who  come  from  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  stream  are unable to pronounce correctly.  It  is\r\n\r\npossible  that  when they were in school  they  might  have\r\n\r\nacquired  a  poor pronunciation, and have not attempted  to\r\n\r\ncorrect their speech and so on. This makes it difficult for\r\n\r\nus to select good newsreaders. But in any case we are still\r\n\r\ntrying  and are sparing no efforts to get the right  people\r\n\r\nfor proper training to become newsreaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The People's Association, if I am not  mistaken,\r\n\r\nshould be people-orientated, that is, catered to the  needs\r\n\r\nof  the people at the ground level. I am not sure that this\r\n\r\nAssociation, as it is now, is an association of the people.\r\n\r\nby the people, but it is definitely not for the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will quote one incident to show why I am so\r\n\r\ndisappointed  with the present development of the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation. On one occasion, a community leader telephoned\r\n\r\nan  official  of  the People's Association  to  confirm  an\r\n\r\nearlier arrangement for a cultural show in connection  with\r\n\r\na  public function to be attended by an MP. The reply  from\r\n\r\nthe  Association  was, \"You pay the $300  first, otherwise\r\n\r\nthere will not be any show in the evening.\" Sir, this  kind\r\n\r\nof  attitude prevails not only among the officials  in  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association but also generally among the staff  of\r\n\r\nthe civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we let this trend of behaviour to go unchecked, I\r\n\r\nam afraid the People's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssociation  will end up as an association  without  people\r\n\r\nor, better, to rename it, the Bureaucrats Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the Citizens' Consultative Committees, we have\r\n\r\nthis  zoning called the District Secretariat to  facilitate\r\n\r\nthe  meeting  of  the  Chairmen  of  various  CCCs  of  the\r\n\r\nneighbouring constituencies so as to get them to  know  one\r\n\r\nanother, For the Youth group, the People's Association also\r\n\r\nhas  the  same sort of zoning for grouping leaders  of  the\r\n\r\nYouth group from the neighbouring constituencies, But those\r\n\r\nin   between,   namely,  the  members  of  the   Management\r\n\r\nCommittees, do not have this kind of zoning or grouping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to ask the Minister whether he has any plans\r\n\r\nfor this sort of zoning or grouping so that the Chairmen of\r\n\r\nthe  Management  Committees of neighbouring  constituencies\r\n\r\ncan get together once a month or once in a fortnight at the\r\n\r\nmeeting table so as to know one another better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker Sir, in order to encourage\r\n\r\ncultural  activities the People's Association has formed  a\r\n\r\ncultural  troupe  to  give  cultural  performances  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious community centres and the constituencies, In  order\r\n\r\nto  recover  costs  for  transport  and  other  very  small\r\n\r\nexpenses  the People's Association charges a token  fee  of\r\n\r\n$300 for each performance. Each cultural troupe consists of\r\n\r\nat least 60 to 80 people and they perform for a duration of\r\n\r\ntwo  hours.  I would say this is a reasonable rate  because\r\n\r\n$300 is not enough to pay for these part-time performers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rate of $300 was laid down in 1971 and since then it\r\n\r\nhas   never  been  revised  in  spite  of  inflation,   NWC\r\n\r\nincrements  and  so  on.  So  the  $300  charge  for   each\r\n\r\nperformance  is only a token fee, If they were required  to\r\n\r\npay the full fee. I think it should be much more than that.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  very  far cry to say that because  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  has levied $300 per performance, it  has  lost\r\n\r\nthe support of the people and that it is not an association\r\n\r\nfor  the  people.

But\r\n\r\nthe  fact still remains that for every cultural show a  fee\r\n\r\nhas  got  to be paid. Otherwise when the show is  over  and\r\n\r\nwhen  the  people  have all left, the People's  Association\r\n\r\nwill be left with nothing to recover expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Sir, I do not think the Minister has\r\n\r\nunderstood  me  correctly.

The Youth  groups  are\r\n\r\ngrouped  into  several  regions and they  form  a  regional\r\n\r\ncouncil  because  they have more or less similar  types  of\r\n\r\nactivities.  For the sake of efficiency and  also  for  the\r\n\r\nsake of promoting the activities, it is found necessary  to\r\n\r\nhave  the Youth groups grouped into several regions. But  I\r\n\r\ndo not know whether this could be applied to the Management\r\n\r\nCommittees. We will certainly give this a thought and study\r\n\r\nit  carefully. If it is found desirable and  good  for  the\r\n\r\nefficient\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworking of the system, then I am sure we will introduce it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Although I am not particularly impressed\r\n\r\nby his answer, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 3020*.

Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the main\r\n\r\nfunctions  of the People's Association is to encourage  our\r\n\r\nyouths   to   participate  in  meaningful   activities.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  the People's Association  has  now  about\r\n\r\n16,000 members enrolled in its Youth section. Recently,  at\r\n\r\na  military tattoo display, the Youth section was asked  to\r\n\r\nperform  one  item involving 128 persons, As the  officials\r\n\r\ncould  not get the required number of persons from  amongst\r\n\r\ntheir  1  6,000 Youth membership, they had to  force  their\r\n\r\nCentre  staff  and kindergarten teachers to participate  in\r\n\r\nthe military display.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to know how much does the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  spend  each  year on the  Youth  groups.  What\r\n\r\npercentage of the 1 6,000 Youth members are really active?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also understand that the People's Association\r\n\r\nemploys  about 20 full-time dancers and about 100 part-time\r\n\r\ndancers  for their cultural troupe. What is the purpose  of\r\n\r\nemploying   such   a  large  troupe  of  dancers   at   the\r\n\r\nAssociation's headquarters? Would it not be more beneficial\r\n\r\nif  these  paid dancers were sent to the various  community\r\n\r\ncentres  to recruit more people to participate in  cultural\r\n\r\ndances  and to conduct classes at the different centres?  I\r\n\r\nfeel  it  should  not be the policy of the  Association  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  a semiprofessional dance troupe. This  should  be\r\n\r\nleft to the different cultural organisations.

I would briefly say that, firstly,  the  Ee\r\n\r\nLian  Dramatic Society was given a grant of $1,500 to  help\r\n\r\nit  to stage a play at the Victoria Theatre. Secondly,  the\r\n\r\nNational  Book  Development Council was given  a  grant  of\r\n\r\n$1,000 to enable it to update the survey conducted in  1969\r\n\r\non  book  development activities in Singapore.  Thirdly,  a\r\n\r\ngrant  of  $700  was given to the newly formed  Society  of\r\n\r\nSingapore Writers to assist it in its production of a multi-lingual  newsletter for its members, This is a  very  small\r\n\r\ncontribution. Whatever grant the Ministry gives is  only  a\r\n\r\ntoken gesture. It is hoped that these grants will encourage\r\n\r\nthe  members of the various societies to pursue their  aims\r\n\r\nand objectives, for cultural activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has raised a question on the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association Youth group. In March last year, the\r\n\r\nPeople's   Association  was  asked  to  send  a   team   to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  the  1975 military tattoo  display  to  be\r\n\r\nstaged  at  the  National  Stadium  for  the  National  Day\r\n\r\ncelebrations. This exercise requires perfectly synchronised\r\n\r\nmovements  and  at  least about 30 training  sessions  were\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  achieve a good display. Most of  the  youths\r\n\r\ntaking  part  in this display were employed  and  they  had\r\n\r\ntheir own activities also, It was, therefore, difficult  to\r\n\r\nfind a group of 128 persons from the Youth group willing to\r\n\r\nattend regularly the 30 training sessions. As a result,  it\r\n\r\nwas   found  that  for  the  sake  of  putting  up  a  good\r\n\r\nperformance it was necessary for the Centre staff and  some\r\n\r\nkindergarten teachers to participate in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmilitary  tattoo,  as they were able to  attend  rehearsals\r\n\r\nregularly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the amount of money spent on the Youth group\r\n\r\nfor  the  last  and current financial years,  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation was given a provision of $40,000 as subsidy for\r\n\r\nmore than 80 Youth groups which have a total membership  of\r\n\r\n20,000.  At  present there are a total of 1,206 members  in\r\n\r\nthe  People's Association Youth Movement serving as  office\r\n\r\nbearers in the 82 Youth Executive Committees. The range  of\r\n\r\nactivities  varies  with the different Youth  groups.  Some\r\n\r\nactivities draw more participants than the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained to Members just now, the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation maintains a cultural troupe. It does not have a\r\n\r\nlarge  number of full-time dancers, as the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nhas suggested. It has only 14 full-time dancers and 40 part-time  dancers.  The amount of money spent on  them  is,  in\r\n\r\nfact, very small, especially on the part-time dancers. They\r\n\r\nget  a nominal allowance of $3 per session. The purpose  of\r\n\r\nkeeping  this group of dancers in the People's  Association\r\n\r\nis  to  meet the demand for cultural performances from  the\r\n\r\nvarious  community centres in the constituencies.  It  also\r\n\r\nwants  to keep this cultural troupe as a nucleus of dancers\r\n\r\nin  order  to  maintain a high standard. At the  same  time\r\n\r\nthese dancers can be sent to the community centres to teach\r\n\r\nthe   people   the  art  of  dancing  and  other   cultural\r\n\r\nactivities. In fact, this small group of fill-time  dancers\r\n\r\nare given training in the People's Association headquarters\r\n\r\nby  professional  choreographers and other  instructors  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  the  standard of their performances. Not  only  do\r\n\r\nthey  participate  in the cultural shows,  they  also  give\r\n\r\ninstruction  at the community centres. After  learning  the\r\n\r\nart  of dancing from the professional choreographers,  they\r\n\r\nare  sent  to  the community centres to teach  the  younger\r\n\r\npeople  there  the art of dancing. There is,  therefore,  a\r\n\r\ndual purpose in maintaining this cultural troupe. First, it\r\n\r\nis to upgrade the standard of the performances and meet the\r\n\r\ndemand for cultural performances at the constituency  level\r\n\r\nand, secondly, by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecoming dance instructors they can pass on their knowledge\r\n\r\nand skill to the people in the community centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\ntake  this  opportunity  to ask the  Minister  whether  the\r\n\r\ncultural  troupe  in  the People's Association  is  put  on\r\n\r\ncircuit  performances, Circuit performances  have  received\r\n\r\ngood  response from the public.

If there is no application for a subsidy,  then\r\n\r\nthe grant is not given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, any application for a grant is carefully\r\n\r\nconsidered  and if there is a deserving case the  grant  is\r\n\r\ngiven.  Of  course, there are more societies  applying  for\r\n\r\ngrants  than  we  have  the money to give,  and  we  cannot\r\n\r\nsatisfy  all  of  them. Therefore,  we  can  only  grant  a\r\n\r\ncontribution rather sparingly. We have given quite a lot of\r\n\r\nmoney  to the various organisations and normally we try  to\r\n\r\nsee  that  these monies are properly expended. If they  are\r\n\r\nnot  spent, the surplus money will be put  back  into  the\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Member for Sembawang for his views on the\r\n\r\ncultural troupe. I agree that it is very popular but it  is\r\n\r\nalso  costly to run the shows. We have tried to give  these\r\n\r\nperformances in the various constituencies, but I am afraid\r\n\r\nthat   this   cannot   be  done  because   there   are   65\r\n\r\nconstituencies and if we hold one performance a  month  for\r\n\r\neach  constituency, then on the average it  would  take  65\r\n\r\nmonths  before  we  can give a repeat performance  in  each\r\n\r\nconstituency.  I  must  say that members  of  the  cultural\r\n\r\ntroupe  have a very busy schedule on their hands. They  are\r\n\r\nfully  booked for the various occasions such as the Chingay\r\n\r\nprocession,  the National Day parades, and many  others.

(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr Yeo Toon Chia and Dr Chiang Hai Ding.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not so long ago, community centres were built\r\n\r\nentirely  by  the People's Association for the  benefit  of\r\n\r\nresidents living in the respective areas, I am not making a\r\n\r\nvalue  judgment  of the community centres.  Although  there\r\n\r\nhave  been  some  criticisms of the role community  centres\r\n\r\nplay  in  a  given environment. I am convinced  that  given\r\n\r\nproper  leadership, community centres can have a tremendous\r\n\r\nimpact  on  our  society. The need  for  community  centres\r\n\r\ncannot be denied, In fact, community centres of today  must\r\n\r\nbe  better  equipped, well laid out and offering facilities\r\n\r\nfor  a variety of activities that would cater for the needs\r\n\r\nof the young as well as the old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although community centres used to be built by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in the past, in recent years the  bulk  of  the\r\n\r\nfunds  for  building  these community centres  have  to  be\r\n\r\nraised  by the residents themselves. I do not quarrel  with\r\n\r\nthe   concept  of  community  participation  and  financial\r\n\r\ninvolvement in a project that would serve their own  needs.\r\n\r\nBut   my   complaint  is:  to  what  extent   should   this\r\n\r\nparticipation  take  place? I advocate  that  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation and the community leaders of an area,  where  a\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre  is to be built, must  sit  together  and\r\n\r\ndecide  on  the  minimum facilities needed in  a  community\r\n\r\ncentre  for any given locality. Once this is decided,  then\r\n\r\nthe funds for the building of the centre should be provided\r\n\r\nby  the People's Association. If the community leaders want\r\n\r\nto improve on the minimum provisions provided, if they want\r\n\r\nto  improve  facilities, if they want to make their  centre\r\n\r\nmore   attractive,  etc., then,  they  should  raise   the\r\n\r\nadditional funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present policy, it appears, is that even for a key\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre in a constituency, the bulk of the  funds\r\n\r\nhas  to be raised by the constituents with a minimal  grant\r\n\r\nfrom the People's Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Telok Blangah there were six community centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An Hon.

Now to  build  a  key\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre  in the constituency, not  more  than  $1\r\n\r\n51)000  is  forthcoming. For a high density new  town  what\r\n\r\nkind  of  a community centre can a $1 50,000 grant  provide\r\n\r\nthat could cater for the needs of the young as well as  the\r\n\r\nold?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, let me avail myself\r\n\r\nof this opportunity to inform the Minister how the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  carries  out  its under-cover  activities.  In\r\n\r\nSeptember  or  October  last year, in  order  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nrequirements of the Building Control Division, in  respect\r\n\r\nof  the construction of a rubbish collecting centre and  so\r\n\r\nqualify   for  a  certificate  of  fitness,  the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation did not consult the Management Committee on the\r\n\r\nCC  officials. They decided to build the rubbish collecting\r\n\r\ncentre by the side of the cooking c ass at a cost of  about\r\n\r\n$1,600. They notified the Management Committee about this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a meeting, the Management Committee felt that the\r\n\r\nrubbish  centre  should  not be built  beside  the  cooking\r\n\r\nclassroom  as the ground there is used for tea parties  and\r\n\r\nother  functions, and especially in the evenings when  many\r\n\r\npeople come to this place for recreation. So the Management\r\n\r\nCommittee suggested that the rubbish ground should be built\r\n\r\non  a  site adjacent to the sewing classroom on the  night.\r\n\r\nThe  Association  replied that if  the  rubbish  collecting\r\n\r\ncentre  was  sited elsewhere, it would require a  new  plan\r\n\r\nfrom the architects\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  this  would delay the construction and would  also\r\n\r\nmean   an   increase   in  costs,  and   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  had  no  money. So unless  the  Management\r\n\r\nCommittee   was  prepared  to  foot  the  bill,   their\r\n\r\nsuggestion  could  not  be  approved.  Sir,   such   an\r\n\r\narrogant   and  harsh  reply  on  the   part   of   the\r\n\r\nAssociation  was really uncalled for.  To  raise  funds\r\n\r\nfor  a rubbish centre, the CC considered following  the\r\n\r\nexample of other CCs by staging a concert where  famous\r\n\r\nsinging  stars could be invited to take part and  where\r\n\r\nsenior  officers from the People's Association together\r\n\r\nwith  other  luminaries could also  attend, and  there\r\n\r\nwould  be  no problem of raising enough money to  build\r\n\r\n20  to  30  rubbish  centres.  However,  the  high  and\r\n\r\nhaughty People's Association did not come to help,  and\r\n\r\nmoreover,  the  Management Committee did  not  want  to\r\n\r\nbend  themselves so low as to be sycophantic  in  their\r\n\r\nattitude.   Therefore, nothing  came   out   of   that\r\n\r\nproposal. Since the People's Association said they  had\r\n\r\nno   money,   therefore,   the   Management   Committee\r\n\r\nsuggested that the People's Association should ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance, through the Ministry of Culture,\r\n\r\nto  allocate  the necessary funds for the  building  of\r\n\r\nthe rubbish centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under my amendment, I would like the Minister\r\n\r\nto  explain why the sum of $348,500 out of last  year's\r\n\r\nallocation for CCs was not utilised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under FY 76, there is an allocation of $1 .1 million\r\n\r\nfor  the  use  of community centres. I would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  tell us whether a rubbish centre  for  my\r\n\r\nconstituency  costing  about  a  thousand  dollars   is\r\n\r\nincluded under such allocation, so that in the end  the\r\n\r\nBuilding  Control  Division will be  able  to  issue  a\r\n\r\ncertificate of fitness for the whole building.  I  have\r\n\r\nto  seize this opportunity to make a direct plea to the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of this year, the Management\r\n\r\nCommittee  wrote  to  the People's Association  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  the lighting for the basketball court was  always\r\n\r\nout  of  order  due to some fault with the  underground\r\n\r\ncables.  Repairs would cost about $3,000 to $5,000.  In\r\n\r\norder  to  prevent a short circuit of those underground\r\n\r\ncables and lamp-posts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  thus  endangering people who frequent  the  basketball\r\n\r\ncourt,  I  would like the Minister to direct  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  to  take  immediate  measures  to  repair  the\r\n\r\nlighting   system,   and  to  ensure  that   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation does not delay by making any excuses. If anyone\r\n\r\nis  electrocuted in the meantime, remedial action  will  be\r\n\r\ntoo late and the consequences will be tragic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Sir, when Leng Kee constituency was\r\n\r\nborn  in  1972, it inherited a fairly substandard community\r\n\r\ncentre,  As a start, I thought the Centre could  serve  its\r\n\r\npurpose and that I would be spared the effort of building a\r\n\r\nnew  one.  But  sometime last year  we  were  told  by  the\r\n\r\nPeople's   Association  that  in  view  of  urban   renewal\r\n\r\ndevelopment, the community centre has got to go. I think it\r\n\r\nhas  joined  the fate of the five community centres  of  my\r\n\r\ngood Friend, the Hon. Member for Telok Blangah. I have just\r\n\r\nreceived the estimates from the People's Association  panel\r\n\r\nof  architects, which show that the new Centre is going  to\r\n\r\ncost   $1.6  million.  At  present,  the  dollar-for-dollar\r\n\r\ncontribution from the People's Association, has  a  ceiling\r\n\r\nof  $150,000.  I  fully support the Hon. Member  for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah  that with $150,000 you can hardly build a  hut.  I\r\n\r\nwould  therefore  like the Minister  to  inform  the  House\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not  there is a possibility  of  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation's  contribution  being  increased  to  a   more\r\n\r\nmeaningful figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, the People's Association is not a\r\n\r\nrevenue-producing statutory board. Unlike  other  statutory\r\n\r\nboards,  it has no power to levy taxes or impose  rates  on\r\n\r\nthe  services it provides. Its only asset, whatever it  is,\r\n\r\nis   the  goodwill  of  the  people.  The  money  for   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment project of the People's Association is supplied\r\n\r\nby  the  Ministry  of  Finance, and therefore  its  use  is\r\n\r\nstrictly controlled by the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, the People's Association has\r\n\r\nrelied   heavily  on  public  contributions  for   whatever\r\n\r\nadditional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommunity centres or facilities it requires. The Government\r\n\r\npays, as Members know, a subsidy to the building fund on  a\r\n\r\ndollar-for-dollar basis up to a maximum of $150,000  for  a\r\n\r\nkey  community centre. However, it now seems that this form\r\n\r\nof  fund  raising has put a heavy strain on  the  time  and\r\n\r\nenergy  of  Members of Parliament and also on the community\r\n\r\nleaders. Since there are many fund-raising campaigns  going\r\n\r\non  at  any one time, competition is very keen and moreover\r\n\r\nbecause of the slowing down of the economy in the past  few\r\n\r\nyears  donations  are  not so forthcoming  as  in  previous\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no cause for despair. Community leaders\r\n\r\nshould  make  a  greater effort to reach  the  target.  The\r\n\r\nPeople's   Association's   policy   of   inviting    public\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  fund-raising campaigns  to  finance  its\r\n\r\nprojects will carry on. First, this form of fund-raising is\r\n\r\ngood because it gives community leaders something to do and\r\n\r\nalso make them enthusiastic about their work. Secondly,  it\r\n\r\ncreates more interest in community centre work. As a result\r\n\r\nof   their   fund-raising  campaign  the  whole  management\r\n\r\ncommittee of the Centre will be made aware of the need  and\r\n\r\nthe  kind  of  activities that the community centre  should\r\n\r\nhave.  Thirdly, it makes them proud of their work and  they\r\n\r\nwould  be  more willing to come forward to look  after  the\r\n\r\nCentre  and  also  to guard it against vandalism,  if  ever\r\n\r\nthere is any.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in view of the rapid changes due to urban\r\n\r\nrenewal and also housing projects in the next few years, we\r\n\r\nhave  to  accelerate the pace of community centre  building\r\n\r\nprojects  to  meet our future requirements. Many  community\r\n\r\ncentres in the old areas are affected by urban renewal.  As\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Telok Blangah has so rightly pointed  out,\r\n\r\nmany  of  these  old centres are affected by these  housing\r\n\r\nprojects  or urban renewals and therefore they have  to  be\r\n\r\npulled down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve these targets, additional funds are required.\r\n\r\nOwing to the high cost of building construction, it is  not\r\n\r\npossible to rely so much on public donations, The Board of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  People's Association has therefore recently  submitted\r\n\r\ncertain proposals to the Treasury and they are in the midst\r\n\r\nof  a  series  of negotiations. I hope that the  sentiments\r\n\r\nexpressed  by the Members of Parliament here in this  House\r\n\r\nwill add their weight to the Association's arguments, and I\r\n\r\nam  sure  Members'  opinions and views  will  be  seriously\r\n\r\nconsidered by the Ministry of Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Planning Committee of the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  has made a study of its requirements  for  the\r\n\r\nnext  five  years. Based on the number of  housing  estates\r\n\r\nthat  the Housing and Development Board and the Jurong Town\r\n\r\nCorporation are going to build in the next five years,  and\r\n\r\nalso  based  on the ratio of 40,000 persons to a  community\r\n\r\ncentre, the People's Association estimated that they  would\r\n\r\nrequire at least 28 new community centres for the whole  of\r\n\r\nSingapore over the next five years to meet the requirements\r\n\r\nof the new housing estates. In addition, they would require\r\n\r\nanother  27 new centres to replace the old ones which  have\r\n\r\nto  be  knocked  down,  like those in Telok  Blangah,  Bras\r\n\r\nBasah,  or  Leng Kee constituencies. These old centres  are\r\n\r\neither  affected  by  urban renewal, or  are  in  very  bad\r\n\r\ncondition  and  therefore have to be pulled  down, or  are\r\n\r\npresently housed in the Housing and Development Board  shop\r\n\r\npremises, which  are not really adequate  or  suitable  as\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres. So in replacing these 27 old  community\r\n\r\ncentres, together with building 28 new centres, a total  of\r\n\r\n55  community  centres will be required in  the  next  five\r\n\r\nyears.  Based  on a very modest cost of $300,000  for  each\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre,  we  will  require  something  like  $16\r\n\r\nmillion  just  for the construction of these  centres,  not\r\n\r\nincluding the cost of land acquisition. The amount is quite\r\n\r\nsubstantial.  The People's Association's proposals  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for the construction of a Community  Centre  at\r\n\r\n$300,000  each cover what we call the basic core  structure\r\n\r\nof  a centre on the new site. The basic core structure will\r\n\r\ninclude  a hall, office, storeroom, basket ball court,  and\r\n\r\nso on, leaving all the additional facilities to be provided\r\n\r\nlater  by the usual fund-raising campaigns. In other words,\r\n\r\nwe are asking the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTreasury  to  allow us to have at least an initial  sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney  for  us  to begin. The Centre must at least  have  a\r\n\r\nplace on which to operate, and if any additional facilities\r\n\r\nare   required  the  community  leaders  should  go   round\r\n\r\ncollecting funds. We hope the Government would be  able  to\r\n\r\ngive  dollar-for-dollar subsidy up to a maximum of $150,000\r\n\r\nfor each Centre. Although this is a very substantial sum of\r\n\r\nmoney,  we  hope  that  this  proposal  can  be  favourably\r\n\r\nconsidered.  But, of course, there are other priorities  to\r\n\r\nbe  considered by the Ministry of Finance, though I  cannot\r\n\r\nspeak  for them. In any case we are fighting very  hard  to\r\n\r\nobtain the necessary funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kapor raised the matter about the\r\n\r\ndustbin  in  his community centre. I think there  has  been\r\n\r\nsome  misunderstanding here. It is not that we do not  want\r\n\r\nto spend the money. The question is that we do not have the\r\n\r\nmoney  to spend. The $300,000 that he mentioned is actually\r\n\r\nmeant  for development purposes. The grant as shown in  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates  is  to be  used  for  building  new\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres or new projects. Any other  expenditure,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  repairs or the construction of a  bin  collecting\r\n\r\ncentre  will  have  to  come from the Main  Estimates.  The\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  the  bin centre at  the  site  originally\r\n\r\nproposed  involves a sum of $4,000. In fact,  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  has  agreed  to  pay  this  $4,000   but   the\r\n\r\nManagement  Committee wanted to re-site it somewhere  else,\r\n\r\nfor  which an additional $2,000 is required. Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nat that time the Association had little funds left for this\r\n\r\nkind  of  work,  and  so  it  had  been  suggested  to  the\r\n\r\nManagement  Committee that in order to get  the  work  done\r\n\r\nquickly  this additional sum of $2,000 should be paid  from\r\n\r\nthe Management Committee fund. But the Management Committee\r\n\r\nturned   down  the  Association's  proposal.  The  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation had to wait for this year's allocation of funds\r\n\r\nbecause they have already gone to the bottom of the  barrel\r\n\r\nfor funds. That is the position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, may I put forward a\r\n\r\nsuggestion to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  to  help him reduce the financial burden  in  the\r\n\r\nconstruction of new community centres?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all Housing Board estates there is provision for the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  recreational and  sports  facilities  and\r\n\r\nswimming pools, which are subsequently handed over  to  the\r\n\r\nSports  Council.

As  a  fairly\r\n\r\nheavy  smoker myself. I must admit that I am responding  to\r\n\r\nthe  treatment.  The prospect of having  to  pay  more  for\r\n\r\ncigarettes  has  shocked  me  into  cutting  down   on   my\r\n\r\nconsumption. Over the last few years, our Government  seems\r\n\r\nto rely on higher taxes, charges and fines as a panacea for\r\n\r\nnumerous  social ills. Singapore became cleaner because  of\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of heavy fines for littering;  to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe number of cans on the road, we raised the road tax;  to\r\n\r\ncut  down  on consumption of water, we raised the price  of\r\n\r\nwater.  I  am  not  here to question  the  wisdom  of  such\r\n\r\nmeasures,  although in passing. I think it is pertinent  to\r\n\r\nsay  that whilst in some cases the end justifies the means,\r\n\r\nthis sort of \"stick\" ought to be used discriminately and as\r\n\r\na  last  resort only when other measures of a  less  severe\r\n\r\nnature have failed to produce results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I really want to say under this subhead is simply\r\n\r\nthat  since  the  recently announced increase  in  duty  on\r\n\r\ntobacco  is with a view to bringing about better health  to\r\n\r\nthe  people, the increased revenue derived therefrom  which\r\n\r\nis  estimated  to  amount to several  millions  of  dollars\r\n\r\nshould properly be spent on promoting better health of  our\r\n\r\npeople. In this regard, I cannot think of a better  way  of\r\n\r\nspending it than on the promotion of sports. Sports,  as  I\r\n\r\nsee  it,  is perhaps the best form of preventive  medicine.\r\n\r\nBut  looking through the expenditures of the Ministry  over\r\n\r\nthe  last few years, I am unable to find evidence of active\r\n\r\nfinancial  support having been given to  the  promotion  of\r\n\r\nsports.  Although for the first time there  is  a  proposed\r\n\r\ngrant  of $2 million to the Singapore Sports Council, there\r\n\r\ndoes not appear to be a firm commitment since it has as yet\r\n\r\nto  be sanctioned by the Development Planning Committee  of\r\n\r\nTreasury  who  are known to be sticky on items  which  they\r\n\r\nconsider  to be of a non-revenue generating nature.  Today.\r\n\r\nwe have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nheard  so much from the Minister for Culture. In any event,\r\n\r\nto-date  the Council still owes the Government  a'  sum  of\r\n\r\n$3.15  million  being  part of the costs  incurred  in  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  the National Stadium. I  would  therefore\r\n\r\nurge  the  Minister  to negotiate with his  colleague,  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister, with a view to obtaining his agreement to\r\n\r\nallocate the entire increase in revenue from higher duty on\r\n\r\ntobacco  for use in the promotion of sports. I  would  also\r\n\r\nurge the Hon. Minister to follow up the suggestion which  I\r\n\r\nmade during the debate on the Budget that all the surpluses\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  Pools  (Pte.) Ltd, should  go  towards  the\r\n\r\npromotion of sports. And how about making it compulsory for\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Turf Club to surrender part of their takings\r\n\r\nannually  for the promotion of sports? Surely,  betting  on\r\n\r\nhorses is just as much an anti-social habit as smoking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we have over the last few years been expanding our\r\n\r\nsports and recreational facilities, these are unfortunately\r\n\r\nnot  sufficiently decentralised as to be near centres  with\r\n\r\nheavy concentrations of population. For instance, the seven\r\n\r\nconstituencies  neighbouring  Jalan  Kayu,  namely.   Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon.  Tampines,  Nee  Soon,  Punggol.  Sembawang  and\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Gardens, have a combined population of something\r\n\r\nlike 250,000 to 300,000, but there is not a public swimming\r\n\r\npool  nearby.  All  our constituents need  one  badly,  and\r\n\r\nalthough  requests  have been put forward  by  some  of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues, including the Minister of State for Labour, who\r\n\r\nis  the MP for Upper Serangoon constituency, we have so far\r\n\r\nreceived  no response. With a very young population  as  we\r\n\r\nhave  today,  it is important that we should  provide  them\r\n\r\nwith adequate facilities and amenities to let off steam and\r\n\r\nthere is no better way than to get them involved in sports.\r\n\r\nWe  urge them to work hard but we should also provide  them\r\n\r\nwith  opportunities and facilities to enjoy the  fruits  of\r\n\r\ntheir labour in a meaningful way. We decry their habits  of\r\n\r\nfrequenting coffee-houses and window-shopping at complexes,\r\n\r\nbut what alternatives are we offering them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, under this subhead I would like\r\n\r\nto speak on two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferent   subjects,  that  is,  temples  and  sports   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  A  number  of  temples, both  authorised   and\r\n\r\nunauthorised,  have  been  demolished  for  urban   renewal\r\n\r\ndevelopment. But the alternative sites given are,  in  most\r\n\r\ncases,  not  suitable for the temple devotees  because  the\r\n\r\nalternative sites for all the different temples are located\r\n\r\nat   one  place.  For  instance,  the  temples  which  were\r\n\r\ndemolished  at  Silat Road, Sentosa and many  other  areas,\r\n\r\nwere  given alternative sites at Queenstown. Then there  is\r\n\r\nthe Rama temple at Changi Road, 14th milestone. The present\r\n\r\nsite  has  been given by the Army and they have  put  up  a\r\n\r\npermanent  structure there. In view of  urban  renewal  the\r\n\r\nAuthority wants to take back the piece of land, but they do\r\n\r\nnot  want  to give an alternative site. They must  give  an\r\n\r\nalternative site because the piece of land was given by the\r\n\r\nArmy.  The  people in that area must have a  temple  there.\r\n\r\nCould  the  Minister  consider allocating  the  alternative\r\n\r\nsites nearer to the former sites and not resite them in one\r\n\r\ncorner  of  the  island? I also want to  know  whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister  would  consider building temples in  new  housing\r\n\r\nestates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the subject of sports. Sometime ago I\r\n\r\nmentioned  that our National Stadium was a white  elephant.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the officials responsible for the Stadium woke\r\n\r\nup  and it has since been a popular meeting ground for many\r\n\r\nexciting  games,  so  much  so that  to  ease  the  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion there is a provision for the construction of  an\r\n\r\nunderpass across the main road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must commend the present Chairman of the Singapore\r\n\r\nSports  Council  who  is  doing  a  wonderful  job  and  is\r\n\r\npersonally attending to the problems of the SSC. However. I\r\n\r\nwish  to  raise a few points. Some of the fields that  have\r\n\r\nbeen taken over from the British Armed Forces are not being\r\n\r\nmaintained  properly, especially those  at  Tanglin,  Dover\r\n\r\nRoad  and  Farrer  Park, where the  turfing  seems  to  be\r\n\r\ndisappearing bit by bit, Even before the dry season  began.\r\n\r\nthere  were  already bald patches on the turf and  this  is\r\n\r\nbecause there is no one to advise on proper maintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Tanglin, the golf course and the tennis courts are\r\n\r\nobviously very popular. It is so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npopular that its revenue is second to the National Stadium.\r\n\r\nHowever, there  are no proper changing  rooms  and  toilet\r\n\r\nfacilities. Although there has been a persistent demand for\r\n\r\nsquash courts, to-date, none has been built. I am sure that\r\n\r\nsquash  courts together with additional indoor and  outdoor\r\n\r\ngames  will bring additional revenue to the SSC. The tennis\r\n\r\ncounts  are over-used that there is little chance  for  any\r\n\r\nmaintenance work to be carried out. It would be much better\r\n\r\nto  cement  these  courts and thereby reduce  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nmaintenance.  In fact, these facilities at Tanglin  are  so\r\n\r\npopular that even tourists find it convenient to use  them.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  I  must point out that theme  are  no  proper\r\n\r\nparking facilities at this place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Sports Council is responsible for the\r\n\r\norganisation of Pesta Sukan. What plans has it got for this\r\n\r\nyear's  Pesta  Sukan? Which countries will  be  invited  to\r\n\r\nparticipate? I also want to know if the SSC has  sufficient\r\n\r\nfunds  to  subsidise  the  various sports  associations  to\r\n\r\norganise these games. In the past, the SSC suggested to its\r\n\r\naffiliated bodies to organise certain games but when  funds\r\n\r\nwere  requested,  the SSC left it to the individual  sports\r\n\r\nassociations.  As  a result, in the last  few  years  Pesta\r\n\r\nSukan  lost  its usual glamour. Thus, sportsmen from  other\r\n\r\ncountries have declined to participate in Pesta Sukan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of late, there has been a great demand for tennis\r\n\r\ncounts  all  over the island. The available courts  are  so\r\n\r\noverused that as a result there is a racket going  on  over\r\n\r\nthe bookings in certain places. Many of our people have all\r\n\r\nof  a sudden decided to take up this game. I wonder whether\r\n\r\nthe  SSC  would consider constructing more courts all  oven\r\n\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Football Association of Singapore has been mainly\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  holding very successful football  matches\r\n\r\nand has promoted a great deal of interest among the public.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the players are the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nones  who  suffer most. When they take time-off from  work,\r\n\r\nthey  lose their wages and thus their earning power.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult, there seems to be a certain reluctance on the  part\r\n\r\nof  the players to come for practices. I feel that if these\r\n\r\npeople  can be financially assisted to the extent of  their\r\n\r\nwages  for  the periods when they are required to  practise\r\n\r\nthey  would not have to suffer any financial loss.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthis incentive payment will benefit them and encourage them\r\n\r\nto play better soccer for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I want to know what form of assistance the SSC\r\n\r\nis providing the Constituency Sports Clubs, and how many of\r\n\r\nthe  Constituency Sports Clubs have so far  benefited  from\r\n\r\nsuch assistance. Recently. I was nominated Chairman of  the\r\n\r\nInter-Constituency   Sepak-Takraw   Tournament   Organising\r\n\r\nCommittee. From my very short experience and also from  the\r\n\r\nSSC  Report  on Inter-Constituency Sepak-Takraw  Tournament\r\n\r\n1975. I  understand  that it is a  normal  practice  among\r\n\r\nSports  Liaison officials not to attend meetings  conducted\r\n\r\nby  SSC. Since these people are voluntary workers and  they\r\n\r\nare  so  heavily  taxed in their own work,  would  the  SSC\r\n\r\nconsider  giving the Sports Liaison officials an  allowance\r\n\r\nas an incentive to them and to ensure that they do not have\r\n\r\nto   be  out  of  pocket  b~  meeting  additional  cost  of\r\n\r\ntravelling incurred in attending these meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Jalan Kayu is a man\r\n\r\nafter my own heart and to have such a suggestion from  him,\r\n\r\na  smoker himself, is most commendable. The idea of getting\r\n\r\ndefinite sources of revenue to finance sports projects  and\r\n\r\nthe  development of sports facilities in Singapore has been\r\n\r\nconsidered   by   my  Ministry  on  many  occasions.   Many\r\n\r\nalternatives  have been considered, including  the  lottery\r\n\r\nnow  known  as  the Singapore Sweep and the Football  Pools\r\n\r\nwhich has now become Toto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House may wish to know that the Singapore Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil  has formulated a 7-year Master Plan for the  long-term development of public sports facilities in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore. The Master Plan recommends the creation  of\r\n\r\nan  international indoor stadium, a velodrome,  multi-purpose   indoor  stadium,  swimming  pools,  athletic\r\n\r\nstadium,  tennis  courts, football fields  and  squash\r\n\r\ncourts.  All  these facilities will  be  decentralised\r\n\r\nall over the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master Plan envisages an expenditure commitment\r\n\r\nof  $75.45  million and the recurrent expenditure,  in\r\n\r\nexcess  of revenue, ranges from $6 million in 1976  to\r\n\r\n$8.8  million in 1982. Through consultations With  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Finance this year, a grant of $2  million\r\n\r\nhas  been  provided  for  the  development  of  sports\r\n\r\nfacilities  which  cover  some  of  the  much   needed\r\n\r\nfacilities envisaged in the Master Plan which  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in mind the urgency to develop adequate\r\n\r\nsports  facilities in order to promote sports for  the\r\n\r\nmasses,   the  present  system  of  financing   sports\r\n\r\nthrough  grants  and loans plus interest  may  not  be\r\n\r\nsufficient.   I  agree  with  the  Member   that   the\r\n\r\nadditional  revenue  derived  from  the  increase   in\r\n\r\nimport  duty  on cigarettes and tobacco  as  has  been\r\n\r\nannounced  recently, should be channelled  for  sports\r\n\r\npromotion   purposes.   In   fact,   prior   to    the\r\n\r\nannouncement on the increase in cigarette and  tobacco\r\n\r\nduties,  my  Ministry  had  intended  to  request  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Finance to levy a few cents tax  on  each\r\n\r\npacket   of  cigarettes  for  the  purpose  of  sports\r\n\r\npromotion.  In 1974, duty was levied on 3.610  million\r\n\r\nkilogrammes of local and imported cigarettes.  At  the\r\n\r\nrate  of  one kilogramme of tobacco to 88  packets  of\r\n\r\ncigarettes  of 10 sticks each, the total volume  works\r\n\r\nout  to  about 317.715 million packets.  With  just  a\r\n\r\nlevy  of  a  few cents, we could, in fact,  expect  to\r\n\r\ncollect  an  additional revenue for  sports  promotion\r\n\r\nequivalent  to the additional revenue from the  recent\r\n\r\nincrease in duties in cigarette and tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the announcement was made by the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance, I suggested  to  him  that  at\r\n\r\nleast  50%  of  the  additional revenue  arising  from\r\n\r\nduties  on  cigarettes  should be  channelled  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Sports Council so that the annual  grant  in\r\n\r\nthe Budget may be correspondingly reduced. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfully  agree  with  the  Member  that  smokers  who  ignore\r\n\r\nGovernment's  call to reduce or stop smoking,  which  is  a\r\n\r\nserious  health  hazard, should contribute  in  a  positive\r\n\r\nmanner  to sports which is health-giving. I am not  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  veteran  smokers  in  the Cabinet  who  are  immunised\r\n\r\nagainst  lung and other pulmonary diseases referred  to  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance. In fact. I have never smoked  at\r\n\r\nall. I support the views of the Member for Jalan Kayu,  not\r\n\r\nbecause  I  am not a smoker but because we need a  definite\r\n\r\nsource of funds to finance public sports facilities, and to\r\n\r\nask  for  50% of the additional revenue from the duties  on\r\n\r\ncigarettes seems reasonable enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of asking the Singapore Turf Club to\r\n\r\nsupport  sports from its revenue, this again  is  a  matter\r\n\r\nwhich  is  in  the hands of my colleague, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance. I can suggest it to him,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Toto, it is for sports. Its origin can be\r\n\r\ntraced  to  a  proposal  made by my  Ministry,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier, to raise money for sports. I would  like\r\n\r\nto  thank the Member for his suggestion. As I have  already\r\n\r\nsaid,  negotiation is going on between my Ministry and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance on the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member for Anson, he has brought up the\r\n\r\nquestion of temples and sports which appear to be unrelated\r\n\r\nsubjects, because one relates to the spiritual realm  while\r\n\r\nthe  other to temporal affairs. However, he has a point  in\r\n\r\nbringing up these two subjects together, since sports  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the  enrichment of the spirit, one  relating  to  the\r\n\r\nreligious  spirit  and  the other is  what  all  of  us  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  quite concerned with, that  is,  building  a\r\n\r\nrugged  physique. He has referred to temples which have  to\r\n\r\ngive way to urban renewal and other development projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be emphasised that development projects which are\r\n\r\nfor the benefit of the people as a whole must go on. If any\r\n\r\nbuilding  is  in the way of such development, obviously  it\r\n\r\nwill have to go. This is unavoidable, This applies not only\r\n\r\nto temples but also to mosques and churches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the policy of the Government to provide sites in\r\n\r\nevery  new  satellite  town for the  building  of  mosques,\r\n\r\nchurches, Hindu or Chinese temples for the people living in\r\n\r\nthese  new  satellite towns. This policy has  already  been\r\n\r\nannounced  and  will be implemented. The Government  cannot\r\n\r\nprovide a site to replace every religious building affected\r\n\r\nby  urban renewal and development. What is desirable is  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a  new Hindu temple in a satellite town where  there\r\n\r\nare a large number of Hindus. A good suggestion is to build\r\n\r\none   such   temple   for  several  temples   affected   by\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  The  management committees of  these  temples\r\n\r\nshould  pool their resources to get a new temple  built  as\r\n\r\nsoon  as possible. The choice of a site for the new  temple\r\n\r\nis left to the Hindu Endowment Board and the Hindu Advisory\r\n\r\nBoard   which  are  concerned  with  the  problem  of   the\r\n\r\nconstruction of new temples at the satellite towns. In this\r\n\r\nregard.  Sir,  I have already directed the Hindu  Endowment\r\n\r\nBoard,  of  which the Member for Anson is the Chairman,  to\r\n\r\nset  up  a management committee to coordinate the clearance\r\n\r\nof  sites  used  for religious purposes and  to  build  new\r\n\r\ntemples in satellite towns. The management committee  which\r\n\r\nwill  be  set up under the Hindu Endowment Act will  advise\r\n\r\nthe  various management committees to transfer compensation\r\n\r\nmoney  from  the demolished temples to the  Board  for  use\r\n\r\nspecifically  for the building of new temples in  satellite\r\n\r\ntowns. The committee will also look into the other aspects,\r\n\r\nincluding fund-raising, for the construction of new temples\r\n\r\nin satellite towns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of sports, in the last Budget sitting the\r\n\r\nMember  referred  to  the  National  Stadium  as  a   white\r\n\r\nelephant. Now he says that the National Stadium  is  not  a\r\n\r\nwhite  elephant.  Instead, he says  that  the  elephant  is\r\n\r\ncausing traffic congestion. He has praised the new Chairman\r\n\r\nof the Singapore Sports Council for attending personally to\r\n\r\nthe problems of the Council, including the construction  of\r\n\r\nan  underpass  which not only eases traffic congestion  but\r\n\r\nalso provides a short-cut to the Stadium and a safe passage\r\n\r\nfor the convenience of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also raised a number of points concerning the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of sports facilities as well as assistance  to\r\n\r\nsports organisations. The fields at Tanglin. Dover Road and\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park, under the management of the Singapore  Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil,  are  being  maintained regularly  throughout  the\r\n\r\nyear.  There is a heavy demand for the use of these  fields\r\n\r\nby  members of the public, especially during week-ends  and\r\n\r\npublic holidays. The fields are, therefore, without a doubt\r\n\r\ngenerally  over-used and this causes heavy wear  and  tear.\r\n\r\nThis  goes  to  emphasise that the fields of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nSports  Council  are fully utilised and  that  theme  is  a\r\n\r\nshortage of playing fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of tennis at Tanglin, the players\r\n\r\nnormally  are  already  properly  attired  for  the   game.\r\n\r\nHowever,  those  who  wish  to change  on  use  the  toilet\r\n\r\nfacilities  can  do  so at the booking  office  where  such\r\n\r\nfacilities are available. Steps are being taken to  convent\r\n\r\na  small hut, adjacent to the tennis count, into a changing\r\n\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1975, the Sports Council requested that the clay\r\n\r\ncourts  at Tanglin be cemented, but it was turned  down  by\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Finance because they felt that it would  be\r\n\r\nmore  economical to cement the courts at a time when  major\r\n\r\nrepairs or renovations were due.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SSC has tennis courts located at different pants of\r\n\r\nthe  island  and the most popular courts are those  at  the\r\n\r\nNational Stadium, Farmer Park and Tanglin. The Council  has\r\n\r\nimplemented  a twice-a-week booking system at the  National\r\n\r\nStadium  on Mondays and Thursdays to enable more people  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  chance  to play. The previous booking  system  was\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory as theme were complaints from the public. As\r\n\r\na  result,  the Council insists that bookings can  only  be\r\n\r\nmade  in  person between 8 am, and 10 am. This  arrangement\r\n\r\ntook effect from, 18th August, 1975 and it has been found to\r\n\r\nbe  working very satisfactorily. Steps are also being taken\r\n\r\nto  floodlight the courts at Farmer Park as the peak  hours\r\n\r\nare between 5.30 p.m. and 10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council has also plans to build another eight tennis\r\n\r\ncourts  and  nine squash courts at the Kallang Complex  and\r\n\r\ntwo  more of each at St. Wilfrid Road in the Whampoa  area.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, we already have 11 squash courts in use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pesta Sukan is an annual feature of our sports\r\n\r\nprogramme  and  it  has  proved to be  very  popular.  With\r\n\r\nincreased support from local participants and the  emphasis\r\n\r\non  mass  participation, the Council has been and  will  be\r\n\r\ncatering for more local competitions and mass participation\r\n\r\nevents such as the National Walk, National Jog and National\r\n\r\nCycling. The national sports associations participating  in\r\n\r\nthe  Pesta  Sukan  receive a subsidy and the  Council  also\r\n\r\nprovides  for the medals for all the competitions. However,\r\n\r\nthose  national  sports  associations  wishing  to  include\r\n\r\nforeign   participation  can  do  so  provided   they   are\r\n\r\nresponsible for all such expenses involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1975, the SSC provided a small subsidy to all\r\n\r\nconstituencies  which had organised a  Constituency  Sports\r\n\r\nAssociation (CSA) on a Constituency Sports Club (CSC).  The\r\n\r\nCouncil  is  considering the possibility of giving  another\r\n\r\nsubsidy  in  1976  for all constituency sports  clubs,  The\r\n\r\nfollowing  are  the  forms of assistance  that  the  Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil  has given or will be providing to the constituency\r\n\r\nsports clubs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Council's assistant sports officers will attend\r\n\r\nmanagement  committee meetings of the CSA on  CSC  to  help\r\n\r\nwith  their  immediate problems.

Just  now   the   Minister\r\n\r\nmentioned  that  as of right the profits  from  Toto  pools\r\n\r\nshould  be  ploughed  into the SSC for  sports  activities.\r\n\r\nWhilst  I speak for myself.

To my mind,\r\n\r\nas  far  as I can recollect, from the replies given by  the\r\n\r\nMinister concerned the profits of the Singapore Pools (Pte)\r\n\r\nLtd are to be ploughed back for the promotion of sports  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Today,  with amendments to the  Sports  Council\r\n\r\nAct, more constituency sports clubs are to be formed; and I\r\n\r\nam  sure more money and facilities will be required by  all\r\n\r\nthese  CSCs. As an example, the Member for Sembawang,  with\r\n\r\ntwo  swimming pools in his constituency, is still not happy\r\n\r\nas he wants some squash courts. Well, that is quite natural\r\n\r\nbecause  as  more and more constituencies  form  their  own\r\n\r\nsports  clubs, they  want to provide more  facilities  for\r\n\r\ntheir constituents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member for Jalan Kayu has suggested, over the\r\n\r\nyears  the  fringe  constituencies around Upper  Serangoon,\r\n\r\nPunggol.

I think the time has come,  right\r\n\r\nand  ripe,  -emphasise  \"right and ripe\"  -  for  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister for Social Affairs to press on with his colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance, for more funds, and if  that  is\r\n\r\nnot forthcoming we will debate on it again at another time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question concerns what the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nhas   just   mentioned,  i.e, increasing  the  number   of\r\n\r\nactivities  by  providing  more  facilities  so  that   the\r\n\r\nconstituents can benefit.

They had\r\n\r\nrecommended   the   reorganisation  of  the   Registry   of\r\n\r\nCooperative   Societies  into  a  Cooperative   Development\r\n\r\nDepartment. The new cooperative legislation would encourage\r\n\r\nthe   consolidation  and  diversification  of   cooperative\r\n\r\nactivities and the formation of an integrated system  of  a\r\n\r\nprimary, secondary and an apex organisation. May I know how\r\n\r\nsuccessful has the Ministry been in the amalgamation of the\r\n\r\nseveral  cooperative societies into a national  cooperative\r\n\r\nmovement,  and whether all those cooperative societies  are\r\n\r\nin a healthy state?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened to the recommendations made by the ILO\r\n\r\nexperts'?

For instance, the Teachers' Cooperative  Society,\r\n\r\nwhich  had  gone into multi-purpose business sometime  ago.\r\n\r\ncould  not  balance  its accounts.

Could the Minister comment on it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, the House will recall that\r\n\r\nduring  the  last Budget debate I mentioned  that  the  ILO\r\n\r\nexperts  had  made  a  number  of  recommendations  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  These  include  the  reorganisation   of   the\r\n\r\nRegistry   of  Cooperative  Societies  into  a  Cooperative\r\n\r\nDevelopment Department, the formation of a Cooperative Apex\r\n\r\nOrganisation for the cooperative movement, the revision  of\r\n\r\nthe  cooperative law and the establishment of a Cooperative\r\n\r\nTraining Centre. As a first phase of the reorganisation  of\r\n\r\nthe Registry of Cooperative Societies, the establishment of\r\n\r\nthe  Registry  has been strengthened with the  increase  of\r\n\r\nfour  additional staff, including two of executive  officer\r\n\r\ngrade. The strengthening of the staffing situation has made\r\n\r\nit  possible  to  reorganise the Registry on  a  functional\r\n\r\nbasis.  It  has also enabled the Registry now to  undertake\r\n\r\nmore  promotional and educational work for the  benefit  of\r\n\r\nthe cooperative movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of unifying the cooperative movement.\r\n\r\nthis has been actively pursued. A cooperative convention of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of various cooperative societies  was  held\r\n\r\nin March last year to discuss the proposed Cooperative Apex\r\n\r\nOrganisation. Owing to divergent views on the  constitution\r\n\r\nof  the proposed Cooperative Apex Organisation, as well  as\r\n\r\nthe  question of representation, it was decided  that  this\r\n\r\nproposal be deferred until relevant details of the  revised\r\n\r\ncooperative laws are known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of a revision of the existing cooperative\r\n\r\nlegislation, the draft Bill has been sent to the  Singapore\r\n\r\nNational  Cooperative Union and the National  Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress to seek their views on certain fundamental  issues\r\n\r\nwhich  affect  all cooperative societies, including  those\r\n\r\nbelonging  to the trade union movement.

We\r\n\r\nhave  sent  them  a reminder and are still waiting  for  an\r\n\r\nanswer.  The  cooperative movement is  by  and  large  very\r\n\r\nhealthy,  with  the  exception of a  few  weak  cooperative\r\n\r\nsocieties which are receiving guidance and assistance  from\r\n\r\nthe Registry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree fully with the Member that good management is\r\n\r\nvitally   important   for  the  successful   operation   of\r\n\r\ncooperative  societies, including multi-purpose  societies.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, only a few cooperative societies can  afford\r\n\r\nfull-time  staff which are particularly required  by  those\r\n\r\nsocieties  which  have  been converted  into  multi-purpose\r\n\r\nsocieties.  It will take time for the movement  to  develop\r\n\r\nprofessionalism  in the administration  and  management  of\r\n\r\ncooperative societies. In this regard, the establishment of\r\n\r\na  cooperative  training centre is important.  This  centre\r\n\r\nwill  in future conduct courses for in-service training  of\r\n\r\nstaff  and  for  the training of officers and  managers  of\r\n\r\ncooperative societies on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding multi-purpose cooperative societies, at present\r\n\r\ntheme  are  seven of them.

The second\r\n\r\ncategory  relates to complaints directed against Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  and  statutory  boards,  The  complaints   are\r\n\r\nusually  directed  against departments  which  have  to  do\r\n\r\nenforcement work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last category of cases attended to are, strictly\r\n\r\nspeaking,  not complaints but rather appeals for assistance\r\n\r\nand inquiries. All cases, either big or small, referred  to\r\n\r\nthe  Bureau  are studied. If necessary, investigations  are\r\n\r\nmade  before  action is taken to refer the  complaint,  The\r\n\r\nBureau sometimes receives complaints which are malicious or\r\n\r\nfrivolous against hardworking and innocent public servants.\r\n\r\nWhile ensuring that such public servants are protected from\r\n\r\nsuch  injustice through careful investigations, the  Bureau\r\n\r\nnever  hesitates to take action against any public  servant\r\n\r\nwho has failed to discharge his or hen duty properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the policy of the Bureau to keep the complainant\r\n\r\ninformed  of the outcome of his complaint immediately.  For\r\n\r\ncases  requiring protracted investigation and  verification\r\n\r\nof  statements made by various parties, interim replies are\r\n\r\ngiven  to let the complainant know that the Bureau is still\r\n\r\nactively  pursuing  the issue on his  or  her  behalf,  The\r\n\r\nBureau has a small staff but, with the efficient deployment\r\n\r\nof  staff and the cooperation of the departments which have\r\n\r\ndealings with the Bureau, so fan work in the Bureau has not\r\n\r\nin any way been handicapped by the limited staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the campaign to reduce incidents of\r\n\r\ndiscourtesy in the public service, since September 1974 the\r\n\r\nBureau  has  started  deploying  its  officers  to  conduct\r\n\r\nobservations   and   inspections  at   various   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  and  statutory  bodies  which  have   frequent\r\n\r\ndealings with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic. From September to December 1974 the Bureau made 122\r\n\r\nsuch  visits.  Last  year, 465 visits  were  made.  Besides\r\n\r\nobserving the way officers at the counter treat members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public,  an  assessment of the  facilities,  such  as.\r\n\r\ndirectional  signs,  cleanliness of  waiting  areas,  etc..\r\n\r\navailable  for  the public, was also made. Reports  of  the\r\n\r\nvisits  which were considered worthwhile for the respective\r\n\r\nheads  of departments to note and to take action have  been\r\n\r\nbrought to the attention of the departments concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bureau has found these visits fruitful and effective\r\n\r\nin  eradicating  discourtesy in the public service.  Hence.\r\n\r\nfor  the current year the number of visits planned will  be\r\n\r\ndoubled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, in view of the complaint by the Minister that the Central Complaints Bureau is under-staffed, I hope the Bureau will get less and less\r\n\r\ncomplaints about the public servants from now onwards.

Sir, what was the cost incurred\r\n\r\nby  the  MUIS  in  respect of these officers,  and  whether\r\n\r\nreports  have  been received from these  officers.  Is  the\r\n\r\nMinister  satisfied with the performance of these  officers\r\n\r\nin  looking  after  the welfare of the  Haj  pilgrims  from\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, firstly, I would like to thank\r\n\r\nthe  Member for his kind words. It is not only the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Social Affairs or the Muslim Religious Council but there\r\n\r\nwere  many other Government departments which were involved\r\n\r\nin solving the problems faced by the pilgrims last year. We\r\n\r\nmoved in just at the right time and therefore we were  able\r\n\r\nto  solve  those  problems, This year the Muslim  Religious\r\n\r\nCouncil  will be responsible for pilgrimage matters between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Mecca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also true, Sir, that last year four welfare\r\n\r\nofficers  accompanied our pilgrims to Mecca.  Two  of  them\r\n\r\nvolunteered their good services free of charge. As  regards\r\n\r\nthe  other  two officers, although the cost  of  their  air\r\n\r\npassage  was  paid  by  the  travel  agents,  the  expenses\r\n\r\nincurred  during their 60-odd days stay in Saudi Arabia  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  their duties, amounted to $3,941.73.  This  sum\r\n\r\nincludes  service charges by sheikhs in Mecca,  Jeddah  and\r\n\r\nMedina, transportation charges, costs of accommodation  and\r\n\r\npersonal expenses. Pending approval from Government ~o meet\r\n\r\nthis  expenditure from public funds, the MUIS paid out  the\r\n\r\nabove  sum  out  of the Baitul-mal Account, in  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance. The Ministry of Finance has been asked to  refund\r\n\r\nto the MUIS the sum expended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, were these\r\n\r\ntwo  welfare  officers appointed by the MUIS, on  did  they\r\n\r\nvoluntarily come forward to offer their services as welfare\r\n\r\nofficers?  As regards air passage, was it paid for  by  the\r\n\r\ntravel agents who arranged the flights for the pilgrims, on\r\n\r\nwas  it paid by those who had no connection whatsoever with\r\n\r\nthe pilgrimage?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, on the question of the two\r\n\r\nwelfare officers who gave voluntary service, they submitted\r\n\r\ntheir  names  to  the  MUIS for voluntary  work,  and  were\r\n\r\naccepted by the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the air passage, offhand I am not in a\r\n\r\nposition to say anything definite, but I think it must have\r\n\r\nbeen paid by the agencies involved with the pilgrimage from\r\n\r\nSingapore to Mecca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, if the cost of the air passage for these  two\r\n\r\nwelfare  officers  was  paid by the travel  agencies  which\r\n\r\norganised  the  pilgrimage, this  is  indeed  improper.  If\r\n\r\nanything  is given free, there must be an ulterior  motive,\r\n\r\nThe  travel agencies which have direct connection with  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  haj pilgrims should not take part  in  providing\r\n\r\nfor  the  welfare officers. If I am not mistaken these  two\r\n\r\nvolunteers   themselves  are  sheikhs  dealing   with   haj\r\n\r\npilgrims,  and I believe they both have a special  interest\r\n\r\nin offering voluntary service. So also is the case with the\r\n\r\naim  passages  offered. I beg the Minister to give  serious\r\n\r\nconsideration to this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, I will take note of that for\r\n\r\nthe next pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd.

According to statistics,  there  are\r\n\r\nabout  8,000  such children. I think this is a very  urgent\r\n\r\nproblem  and  requires  immediate attention.  I  make  this\r\n\r\nrequest  because I understand that the number of homes  for\r\n\r\nthe  care  of unfortunate children managed by the Salvation\r\n\r\nArmy and other charitable organisations are not sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received an appeal from a housewife in my constituency\r\n\r\nwho told me that she was unlucky enough to have a child who\r\n\r\nhas been afflicted with poliomyelitis since birth and could\r\n\r\nnot  move all these years. Her family is poor and  most  of\r\n\r\nthe  members  of the family have to go out to work  and  so\r\n\r\nthey are not able to take came of this child. She has asked\r\n\r\nme  to  approach the Social Welfare Department  to  find  a\r\n\r\nplace  for  her child. I have made several applications  to\r\n\r\nthe  Social  Welfare Department. However, all  the  replies\r\n\r\nhave  been  negative, stating that there is no vacancy  and\r\n\r\nthe child has to wait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case relates to a petty trader. He is unfortunate\r\n\r\nenough  to  have  two  children both with  some  congenital\r\n\r\ndiseases. One of them is being taken cane of by a home  for\r\n\r\ndisabled children but the other child is left out as  there\r\n\r\nis  no  place for her. I believe theme are many  more  such\r\n\r\ncases. I would therefore sincerely request the Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider establishing a home for such children in order  to\r\n\r\nalleviate  the  hardship of those families. However,  as  a\r\n\r\ntemporary  measure, the Ministry could find  some  suitable\r\n\r\nplace to accommodate these children until a proper home  is\r\n\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
