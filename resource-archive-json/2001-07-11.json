The Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy  shrank by 0.8% in the second quarter, following  the\r\n\r\nweaker  external environment.  The slow-down  is  more  rapid\r\n\r\nthan what we had earlier expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the major economies have slowed sharply. US growth\r\n\r\nin the first quarter was revised downwards significantly from\r\n\r\nthe  initial  estimate of 2% to 1.2%, as companies  run  down\r\n\r\ninventories  at a much faster pace.  The EU has  also  slowed\r\n\r\nsignificantly while the Japanese economy is near or may be in\r\n\r\nrecession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the global electronics industry has\r\n\r\ndeteriorated  even  more  sharply in  the  last  few  months.\r\n\r\nGlobal semiconductor sales fell by 29% in April and May, down\r\n\r\nfrom -4.4% in the first quarter this year and +22% growth  in\r\n\r\nthe  fourth  quarter  of  last year.   For  the  whole  year,\r\n\r\nindustry analysts at Gartner Dataquest expect the industry to\r\n\r\nshrink by 20% to 25%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negative environment has a large impact on\r\n\r\nSingapore's growth as external demand accounts for 80% of our\r\n\r\ntotal  demand.  In particular, our manufacturing  sector  has\r\n\r\ndeclined by 10.9% in May, and is expected to remain  weak  in\r\n\r\nthe  second half.  Export-oriented services have also  slowed\r\n\r\nas  demand  from regional economies fell.  We have  therefore\r\n\r\nrevised our growth forecast this year down to 0.5% to 1.5%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can expect unemployment to worsen. The number of\r\n\r\nworkers  retrenched rose sharply to about 3,200 in the  first\r\n\r\nquarter of this year, up from an average of 1,900 in the last\r\n\r\nthree  quarters of 2000.  We expect more retrenchment in  the\r\n\r\nsecond half of the year as companies, which were holding onto\r\n\r\nworkers in anticipation of a quick turnaround, begin to  shed\r\n\r\noff  workers.   Already, we have seen more companies  putting\r\n\r\ntheir  workers  on  shorter work-week and  compulsory  leave.\r\n\r\nThere  has also been a significant fall in job advertisements\r\n\r\nin  recent months.  Anecdotally, I think all of us would have\r\n\r\nheard  or  received feedback from friends and relatives  that\r\n\r\nthere is a fear that they may lose their jobs because of  the\r\n\r\nretrenchment that they see going on around them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the sharper than expected downturn, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  intends  to implement some specific  measures  to\r\n\r\ncushion  its impact on companies and workers.  However,  this\r\n\r\nwill  not be like the $10 billion package in 1998.  The  1998\r\n\r\npackage  was necessary to restore Singapore's competitiveness\r\n\r\nfollowing   the   Asian  financial  crisis  and   the   sharp\r\n\r\ndevaluation of regional currencies.  The current downturn  is\r\n\r\na  cyclical  slowdown  caused by a severe  drop  in  external\r\n\r\ndemand,   especially  in  electronics.   We  are  encouraging\r\n\r\nMinistries  to  speed up their development projects,  but  we\r\n\r\nshould be realistic that such pump priming would only  be  of\r\n\r\nmarginal benefit; leakage is high and it would not be able to\r\n\r\noffset the drastic fall in external demand.  The objective of\r\n\r\nthe  measures  we are working on this time  is  to  ease  the\r\n\r\nburden on businesses and workers, while we await the recovery\r\n\r\nof the US economy and the global electronics industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the 1998 package is still in place, as some of\r\n\r\nthe cost-cutting measures in that package have not been fully\r\n\r\nlifted.   This includes the 4% point reduction in  employers'\r\n\r\nCPF  contribution, the cut in foreign worker levies, and  JTC\r\n\r\nand HDB rental rebates.  In addition, at the last Budget, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance  lowered corporate  and  property  tax\r\n\r\nrates, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintroduced   various  rebates  and  CPF   top-ups   to   help\r\n\r\nindividuals and workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are finalising the new measures. I expect to\r\n\r\nannounce them to this House at the end of the month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister  mentioned that this problem is cyclical in  nature.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask the Minister whether this could, in fact,\r\n\r\nlead  to  more severe structural problems as there  could  be\r\n\r\nmore hollowing out of our economy, and therefore lead to more\r\n\r\nsevere unemployment and retrenchment than earlier expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The structural shifts have\r\n\r\nbeen  going on for some time.  This is the reason why we have\r\n\r\nbeen  pressing on with investing in R&D and worker upgrading.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason is, of course, the emergence of China into\r\n\r\nthe  global  market.  And as hundreds of millions of  Chinese\r\n\r\nworkers who are hardworking and not without ability join  the\r\n\r\nglobal  labour  market, there will be downward wage  pressure\r\n\r\nall  around.  Those who are unable to upgrade find themselves\r\n\r\nunder great pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in India, Chinese consumer products are\r\n\r\nreally  cutting  the ground from under Indian  manufacturers.\r\n\r\nWhen  I  spoke to the Vietnamese Trade Minister recently,  he\r\n\r\nwas  quite  worried about the way Chinese products  are  fast\r\n\r\nentering the Vietnamese market.  They told me that a  Chinese\r\n\r\nmotorcycle with as good or better quality cost only one-third\r\n\r\nof  a  Vietnamese motorcycle.   And we see this now all over,\r\n\r\nhow  Chinese  products are lowering the cost of clothing,  of\r\n\r\nhandbags,  of  all kinds of things.  All over Singapore  now,\r\n\r\nyou  are  seeing sprouting up $2 stores and they are carrying\r\n\r\nmostly Chinese products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this keeps cost down, this also presents\r\n\r\nchallenges to some of the industry sectors.  So the only  way\r\n\r\nfor  us to maintain our high wage levels in Singapore  is  to\r\n\r\npress  on  with  the  education of  our  young,  with  worker\r\n\r\ntraining  and  upgrading,  improving  system  efficiency  and\r\n\r\ninvesting in R&D.  And if we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinue to do that, we should be able to hold our own in the\r\n\r\nsectors  that we are very good at.  For example, if you  look\r\n\r\nat  the  wafer fabs, I think we remain very competitive,  and\r\n\r\nthere  are  a  number  of investments on  stream,  they  will\r\n\r\nprobably be delayed, but I think our basic competitiveness in\r\n\r\nsemi-conductors remains unchanged.  For disk drives, we  face\r\n\r\na  challenge,  and  the more labour intensive  lines  we  are\r\n\r\nlosing  to  Penang  and China.  But last year,  when  Seagate\r\n\r\ndecided to close down its disk drive operation in Penang  and\r\n\r\nshed off 5,000 workers, they reconfigured their production so\r\n\r\nthat  the  labor intensive portions went to Wuxi and Shenzhen\r\n\r\nin China, while the higher value-added and the more automated\r\n\r\nbits  were  reconcentrated in Singapore, where we  have  been\r\n\r\nhelping  them  to  build the 'factory of the  future',  which\r\n\r\nmeans  highly  automated lines, you design a product  with  a\r\n\r\nview  to producing it, and therefore enabling you to automate\r\n\r\nmany of the processes.   So sector after sector, we have  got\r\n\r\nto  keep  on pushing on with restructuring and ensuring  that\r\n\r\ndespite  competition from other countries,  we  are  able  to\r\n\r\nmaintain our high wage levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cyclical downturn may accentuate the process but we\r\n\r\nshould not mix up the two separate tendencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a\r\n\r\nperception in the market that pump priming and other measures\r\n\r\nto  boost domestic demand may help offset some of the  impact\r\n\r\nof  the negative external demand.  The Minister has explained\r\n\r\nwhy he does not think this might work.  Could he elaborate on\r\n\r\nthis so that everybody will have a better understanding?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that the low end of Government's\r\n\r\nforecast of 0.5% for GDP growth this year is very similar  to\r\n\r\nthat  which Singapore experienced in 1998 which prompts  many\r\n\r\nto  ask  the  question why a similar order  of  magnitude  of\r\n\r\nGovernment off-Budget measures is not warranted.   Could  the\r\n\r\nMinister please elaborate?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> We had 4.6% growth for the\r\n\r\nfirst  quarter.  Flash estimate for second quarter is  -0.8%.\r\n\r\nIf  we  anticipate 1% at the end of the year, that means  for\r\n\r\nthe  remaining  six  months, for  the  second  half,  we  are\r\n\r\nanticipating  the  economy to be  flat.   And  0.5%  to  1.5%\r\n\r\nprojection  for the whole year means that we are anticipating\r\n\r\nthe  second half to be somewhere in between -1% and +1%.  The\r\n\r\nfollowing  quarter,  we  expect  the  downturn  to   continue\r\n\r\nbecause, if you look at non-oil retained imports, which is  a\r\n\r\npretty good indicator of what is going to happen in the  next\r\n\r\none to three months, it remains sharply negative, -16% or 17%\r\n\r\nlast month.  So there is near certainty that the next quarter\r\n\r\nwill  remain  negative.   But when it  comes  to  the  fourth\r\n\r\nquarter, we are not sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you listen to the American Treasury Secretary, he\r\n\r\nsaid  he  is  quite confident that the US would  be  able  to\r\n\r\nachieve  2%  in  the fourth quarter which means  that  things\r\n\r\nwould begin to look up then.  Stanley Fischer of the IMF made\r\n\r\nsimilar noises.  And there are some indications that consumer\r\n\r\nconfidence has picked up, that orders have begun to show more\r\n\r\nlife.  So we are not sure what the fourth quarter would  look\r\n\r\nlike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we should not be unduly optimistic, we should also\r\n\r\nnot  be excessively pessimistic.  If you look on the horizon,\r\n\r\nyes,  there  are  dark  clouds, but  there  are  also  silver\r\n\r\nlinings.   If you ask me where we are at now - I do not  want\r\n\r\nto  go into the details of the package because that would  be\r\n\r\nannounced  when they have been finalised at the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nmonth  -  it  is  obviously raining, and the  rain  will  get\r\n\r\nheavier.   This is not a passing shower.  But we  should  not\r\n\r\nassume that it is going to be a full-blown thunder storm.  It\r\n\r\nmay  not  be.  We should get our umbrellas ready and  try  to\r\n\r\nstay  as dry as possible, but keep watch on the weather.   If\r\n\r\nit gets worse, then we have got to do more, but respond in  a\r\n\r\nmeasured  way,  in a calibrated way, and look,  even  in  the\r\n\r\ndarkest  cloud,  for silver linings which  may  open  up  new\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  us,  which means  not  slowing  down  our\r\n\r\nrestructuring because of the problems we are facing, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npressing on so that when the weather clears up again, we will\r\n\r\nbe well positioned and we will be ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, with the scenario just painted and the forecast on value\r\n\r\nadded,  factories  of  the future, and so  forth,  could  the\r\n\r\nMinister reflect on the future of SMEs in Singapore  to  face\r\n\r\nsuch competition?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, SMEs\r\n\r\nwill  face  a  challenge because those who are in traditional\r\n\r\nindustries  will face the cold wind of competition.   If  you\r\n\r\nlook around the housing estates, many of our small shops  are\r\n\r\nfacing  severe challenges because the supermarkets,  the  big\r\n\r\ndepartmental  stores, the franchisees  are  coming  in.   For\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  unable to upgrade, partly because  they  are\r\n\r\ngetting  on  in years and their children are not prepared  to\r\n\r\ntake  over their parents' businesses, or because of bad luck,\r\n\r\nor  because of inertia, then we have a package which MND  had\r\n\r\nannounced  recently to help them exit.   For  those  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared to try, we will make every effort to help them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now looking at how we may want to reorganise PSB\r\n\r\nand   TDB   to  give  a  stronger  focus  to  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  especially among our SMEs.  For those  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  try,  there  will  be  all  kinds  of  packages\r\n\r\navailable  to  help them along.  And those who  have  decided\r\n\r\nthat  they  want to call it a day, I think we will help  them\r\n\r\nexit.   But this varies from sector to sector.  We have  many\r\n\r\ndiscussions with various sectors and there are some who  have\r\n\r\ndone  well, despite all the problems.  If you look  at,  say,\r\n\r\nthe  food industry, it is quite interesting the way the  food\r\n\r\nindustry is being restructured now.  A lot of the otak  otak,\r\n\r\nnasi lemak and fishball that we are getting in the shops  now\r\n\r\nare  all  made  in factories.  It is a very efficient  supply\r\n\r\nchain.   And  there  are others who are unable  to  make  the\r\n\r\nadjustment,  so  they  go  through  a  prolonged  period   of\r\n\r\ndifficulty.   But  this is a large subject,  we  have  talked\r\n\r\nabout  it,  and we will continue to talk about it.   We  will\r\n\r\ninstitute in the coming months more programmes to help SMEs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, does the Minister see\r\n\r\nany  possibility  at all in helping to attract  some  of  the\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  remain in Singapore, ie, companies  which  are\r\n\r\nlikely to move over to other countries which offer lower cost\r\n\r\nstructure,  or  attract some of these companies  to  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore?  I ask this because there could be people who, for\r\n\r\nsome  reason,  could  only  take up very  rudimentary  skills\r\n\r\nthrough all the schemes that we offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> In fact, we work very hard on\r\n\r\nthis.   When  companies indicate that they have  difficulties\r\n\r\nwith  their  cost structure and are thinking  of  relocating,\r\n\r\nusually they alert EDB and we will try and sit down with them\r\n\r\nto  work  out a package to help them restructure and  try  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate their remaining on in Singapore.  And even if they\r\n\r\nhave got to leave Singapore, we will try to encourage them to\r\n\r\nleave   behind  in  Singapore  the  higher  value   elements.\r\n\r\nSometimes,  we succeed, but not always.  But we have  got  to\r\n\r\nkeep  working  at  this  and provide  an  environment  which,\r\n\r\ndespite  higher  labour costs and higher land  costs,  yields\r\n\r\ngreater system efficiency.  And one area in which we  have  a\r\n\r\nclear  advantage  is the fact that we provide  a  hassle-free\r\n\r\nenvironment.  We tell them, at the outset, that we will  make\r\n\r\nsure  that  they are able to find the skills that  they  need\r\n\r\nand,   if  these skills are not available in Singapore,  they\r\n\r\ncan  import  them  from anywhere in the  world  in  order  to\r\n\r\nmaintain their operation here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have one further advantage which should become more\r\n\r\nand  more important in the coming years, which is the way  we\r\n\r\nprotect  intellectual property rights and provide  for  their\r\n\r\nenforcement.  This involves the judiciary, the AG's Chambers,\r\n\r\nthe  police,  the whole infrastructure.  It would  eventually\r\n\r\nextend  into  the life sciences.  And if we can be  the  most\r\n\r\nsecure  base in Asia for intellectual property, then I  think\r\n\r\nmany  of the higher value activities will remain here.  Take,\r\n\r\nfor  instance, Glaxo.  They set up a factory in Suzhou  which\r\n\r\nhad   to  be  mothballed  because  of  intellectual  property\r\n\r\nproblems  in  China.  It will take a long time for  China  to\r\n\r\nwork through all the laws and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenforcement  procedures.  But in the meantime, if  they  have\r\n\r\ngot  something sensitive, if they have got secrets to protect\r\n\r\nand  if they have got particular codes which contain most  of\r\n\r\nthe  value  of the product, they will put them in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAnd  the key is running a system which is efficient, a labour\r\n\r\nmarket which is highly flexible and an access to talent which\r\n\r\nis  global.   This is very important.  Then  when  they  come\r\n\r\nhere, they will be assured.  No businessman wants to plonk  a\r\n\r\nsignificant investment in a place where, after they have  put\r\n\r\nin  the money, they face all kinds of obstacles and have  got\r\n\r\nto fight them at every turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister has\r\n\r\nspoken  about  the rising unemployment and he expects  it  to\r\n\r\nrise  further.   May  I  ask the Minister  what  message  his\r\n\r\nGovernment  has got at the moment for workers who  are  being\r\n\r\nretrenched, or has the Government got no message at all,  and\r\n\r\nparticularly,  is the Government prepared  to  see  that  our\r\n\r\nworkers  are not retrenched first before foreign workers  are\r\n\r\nretrenched,  which  is  a step that is  being  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all of\r\n\r\nus, as Members of Parliament, meet our voters and in the last\r\n\r\nfew months, we could sense the change in the economic climate\r\n\r\non  the  ground.  At our meet-the-people sessions, many  more\r\n\r\nare   coming  forward  either  with  financial  difficulties,\r\n\r\nworried  about  their  jobs, or have lost  their  jobs.   The\r\n\r\nproblem is not yet very serious.  But we are beginning to see\r\n\r\nit  and  it  is likely to become more serious in  the  coming\r\n\r\nmonths.   I would say our response must be on a broad  front.\r\n\r\nFirst,  make  sure  that  the  children's  education  is  not\r\n\r\naffected.  I believe we have a whole slew of scholarships and\r\n\r\nbursaries available to make sure that they are looked  after.\r\n\r\nWith  health care, housing, the basics, the safety  net  will\r\n\r\nalways be there.  Then those who are without jobs, how do  we\r\n\r\nhelp  them retrain?  MOM has got a labour exchange.  We  have\r\n\r\nall  kinds  of  programmes available to help  those  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to be reskilled to be reskilled.   But there  is  a\r\n\r\nparticular problem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namong  older Singaporeans, particularly those who are  above,\r\n\r\nsay,  45-50 years old.  In difficulties, sometimes  they  are\r\n\r\nthe  first to be retrenched, usually they are the last to  be\r\n\r\ntaken back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, just last night, one of my constituents came to\r\n\r\nsee me, a 50-year old diabetic who has an MBA and he asked me\r\n\r\nwhether  I could help get his CPF out because he said  he  is\r\n\r\nfinding  it difficult to get a job because companies want  to\r\n\r\nhire younger people.  If you have diabetes, they said, \"Well,\r\n\r\nwe  have  to incur health care cost looking after you  if  we\r\n\r\ntake  you on.\"  I told him that it is not likely that CPF  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  allow him to take out his money.  But at the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  I  sympathise with him.  So we have got to be specific\r\n\r\nand where we can help, we should help, make sure the children\r\n\r\nare looked after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can Government create jobs? I think we have got to\r\n\r\nthink  harder about this, whether there are not some  service\r\n\r\njobs  which we can provide in the public sector later to soak\r\n\r\nup  some  of  them.  They represent a group  of  people  who,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  grew up in an earlier era, have  not  had  the\r\n\r\neducation.   Above  the  age of 45,  less  than  one  in  two\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have more than six years of education.  So  when\r\n\r\nwe   run   into   the  new  economy,  they  face   particular\r\n\r\ndifficulties and we have got to think through in  a  sensible\r\n\r\nway  how  to help them.  If we just give them money  to  help\r\n\r\nthem  by, that will be ameliorative but, I think, as a group,\r\n\r\nthey  will  be demoralised.  We must find a creative  way  to\r\n\r\nengage  them  because they are intelligent,  hardworking  and\r\n\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very surprised meeting old colleagues from the army\r\n\r\nwho are now working in our schools as administrators.  In the\r\n\r\narmy, because we want to keep our NCOs and officers young, we\r\n\r\nretire  them early with golden handshakes.  Many of them  end\r\n\r\nup  working as administrative officers in schools.  For them,\r\n\r\nrunning  a  school is nothing compared to running a battalion\r\n\r\nor    company.    And   the   teachers   are   spared   those\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.  Maybe there are other areas  in  which  we\r\n\r\ncan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink  of similar useful schemes so that those who are unable\r\n\r\nto  upgrade  themselves  sufficiently  can  still  have  good\r\n\r\nemployment.   It  is  a complex problem.   And  I  think  all\r\n\r\nMinistries  and economic agencies would have to think  harder\r\n\r\nhow  to  address  this problem.  It is a problem  which  goes\r\n\r\nbeyond this economic downturn.  It is a structural problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the  Minister whether the proposals his Ministry  is\r\n\r\nworking   on   would   incorporate   the   speeding   up   of\r\n\r\ninfrastructural projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Yes, that is the natural\r\n\r\ncourse   of   action  to  take.   But  we  have  speeded   up\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  projects  as  a  result  of  the  last  Asian\r\n\r\nfinancial crisis.  So if you look at the latest numbers, even\r\n\r\nthough  the construction industry has not gone negative,  the\r\n\r\nreason  is  that  it  is being propped up  by  public  sector\r\n\r\nspending.  In fact, private sector construction spending  has\r\n\r\ngone down into the negative.  We are now reviewing in various\r\n\r\nMinistries  whether we can bring forward some projects  in  a\r\n\r\nsensible  way.  We should not be doing what repeated Japanese\r\n\r\nadministrations have done, which is just to pump  prime  and,\r\n\r\nin  the  end, waste resources.

If  in  an\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn, we suddenly say, \"Well, you are  foreign,\r\n\r\nyou  go  out first\" even though he may be doing a  good  job,\r\n\r\nthis  will  unravel  a reputation that we have  painstakingly\r\n\r\nbuilt up over the years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just two days ago, the CEO of Shell Gas came to see me,\r\n\r\nthinking  of setting up an operation in Singapore for  global\r\n\r\nsolutions to various industries, particularly the oil and gas\r\n\r\nindustry.    He  has  his  reservations  about   some   other\r\n\r\ncountries.  I told him, \"Do not worry.  You do what you  have\r\n\r\nto do in the region.  But what you need in Singapore, we will\r\n\r\nprovide.   If  you need talent, you bring  them  in.\"   If  a\r\n\r\ncompany  has  to shed off workers, we should let the  company\r\n\r\ndecide  whom to shed off.  We are already protecting our  own\r\n\r\nlocal  workers  through the foreign worker levy  and  by  the\r\n\r\nquota  requirement  that  a  certain  percentage  has  to  be\r\n\r\nSingaporean workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, if we over protect Singaporeans, will we\r\n\r\nwin?   I  do  not think we will win, because what would  then\r\n\r\nhappen is that investments will leave Singapore to where they\r\n\r\ncan access workers at internationally competitive wage rates.\r\n\r\nRecently, a group of us was talking to a Singapore doctor who\r\n\r\nhas worked many years in America.  In American hospitals now,\r\n\r\ndoctors  no longer clerk their own case sheets.  They  go  to\r\n\r\nthe  nearest phone, they call up a number, they dictate,  and\r\n\r\nit   goes   to  India,  where  there  is  a  whole  bank   of\r\n\r\ntranscribers.  And they are very smart.  They  know  all  the\r\n\r\nmedical  terms, drugs, diseases, medical conditions and,  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  day, via the Internet, it appears on the  doctor's\r\n\r\nscreen, he makes his amendments and it is recorded.  In other\r\n\r\nwords,  in  the  coming years, no sector  can  be  protected,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  moment you try to protect it, it raises  costs,\r\n\r\nand investors having choices will move somewhere else.  So it\r\n\r\nis  better that we stare the problem in the eyes and make the\r\n\r\nadjustment.   The  key  is:  stay  competitive,  continue  to\r\n\r\nattract  investments in, and we will be all  right.   And  we\r\n\r\nwill be all right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nManpower  if  he  will  give (i) an  update  of  the  current\r\n\r\nunemployment situation and the outlook ahead and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(ii) an evaluation of the accessibility and effectiveness  of\r\n\r\nthe  current career development and retraining programmes  in\r\n\r\nraising  labour productivity and in helping Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nhave been retrenched and those likely to be displaced due  to\r\n\r\nthe  continuing  economic slowdown and spate of  mergers  and\r\n\r\nacquisitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nManpower,  given  the  current  economic  climate,  will  his\r\n\r\nMinistry  consider  encouraging  local  employers   to   give\r\n\r\npriority to employing Singaporeans who can perform equivalent\r\n\r\njobs, including our healthy elderly, rather than to resort to\r\n\r\nengaging foreign employees too readily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, with your permission, may I take Question  Nos.\r\n\r\n6 and 7 together, because they are in some way related?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, the seasonally adjusted\r\n\r\nunemployment rate in March 2001 was 2.4%. This was lower than\r\n\r\nthe  2.9%  in  December  2000. However,  the  improvement  in\r\n\r\nunemployment  is expected to be short-lived as  the  economic\r\n\r\nslowdown has triggered a sharp increase in retrenchments  and\r\n\r\na  drop  in  job vacancies.  The number of workers retrenched\r\n\r\nrose  sharply to 3,248 in the first quarter of this year from\r\n\r\nthe  quarterly average of 1,900 registered in the last  three\r\n\r\nquarters  of  2000.   Retrenchment in the second  quarter  is\r\n\r\nexpected to be higher, based on notifications by companies to\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry  in  recent  months.   At  the  same  time,  job\r\n\r\nvacancies  fell significantly from 26,182 in  March  2000  to\r\n\r\n19,755  in March this year.  Vacancy rate, ie, the number  of\r\n\r\nvacancies,  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  total  manpower\r\n\r\ndemand,  also fell from 2.7% in March 2000 to 1.9%  in  March\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the seasonally adjusted job vacancies to unemployed\r\n\r\npersons ratio\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfell  to  0.76 (ie, there are only 76 job openings for  every\r\n\r\n100 job seekers) in March of this year from a higher level of\r\n\r\n1.14  in September 2000.  Today, there are simply fewer  jobs\r\n\r\nthan  there are job seekers.  Also, the entry of this  year's\r\n\r\ncohort  of  tertiary graduates into the labour market  around\r\n\r\nthis time is likely to aggravate the labour market situation.\r\n\r\nThey  are  going to find it a little bit harder to  find  the\r\n\r\njobs that they want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the labour market is softening, jobs are still\r\n\r\nbeing created.  There are still unfilled vacancies in the job\r\n\r\nmarket,  especially in the services sector.  My Ministry  has\r\n\r\nexpanded   existing   employment  assistance   and   training\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  and  will also initiate new programmes  to  fill\r\n\r\nthese vacancies.  Let me give two examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to help the lower skilled workers raise their skill\r\n\r\nlevel, the Ministry has been working with NTUC to extend  the\r\n\r\nreach  of  the  Skills Redevelopment Programme  (SRP).   Last\r\n\r\nyear,  some 20,000 workers were trained under the SRP.   This\r\n\r\nwas  about 40% higher than the figure achieved in  1999.   Mr\r\n\r\nOng  asked about the effectiveness of such programmes.  In  a\r\n\r\nsurvey  conducted last year, 70% of employers  reported  that\r\n\r\nworkers  who  underwent  the Skills  Redevelopment  Programme\r\n\r\ntraining had become more productive in their jobs, while  80%\r\n\r\nindicated  that  their  workers had become  more  employable.\r\n\r\n70%  of  workers felt more confident of handling more complex\r\n\r\njob  responsibilities and seeking re-employment after the SRP\r\n\r\ntraining.   Among  the unemployed workers who  underwent  SRP\r\n\r\ntraining, three out of four managed to find a new job  within\r\n\r\nthree to six months after training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July last year, my Ministry also set up a career\r\n\r\ncentre,  CareerLink@mom, to provide Singaporeans with  better\r\n\r\naccess  to employment and training opportunities.  We receive\r\n\r\nabout  1,600 visits each month.  More than two-thirds of  the\r\n\r\nvisitors  who  had  responded to  the  centre's  first  three\r\n\r\nquarterly  surveys indicated that they were  better  informed\r\n\r\nabout job choices\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  training opportunities after using the services  at  the\r\n\r\ncentre.   Among those who were actively looking  for  a  job,\r\n\r\nmore  than 20% had found employment within three months, some\r\n\r\nthrough the centre's assistance, and others through their own\r\n\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the coming months, more employers and workers\r\n\r\nwill  be  affected by the economic downturn as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nrestructuring which is taking place in some sectors.  We will\r\n\r\nhelp affected employers and workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we will work with the NTUC, the Productivity\r\n\r\nand  Standards Board, and other organisations to  train  even\r\n\r\nmore  workers.   This will not only enhance the employability\r\n\r\nand  capabilities of workers, but will also enable  employers\r\n\r\nto  seize opportunities when the economy recovers.   We  will\r\n\r\ndeepen  and broaden existing initiatives, including  the  SRP\r\n\r\nand  the Strategic Manpower Conversion Programme (SMCP),  and\r\n\r\nalso introduce new programmes.  Just last month, for example,\r\n\r\nwe  launched  the National IT Literacy Training Programme  to\r\n\r\nhelp workers acquire basic computer and Internet skills which\r\n\r\nwill  enhance their employment prospects.  Where appropriate,\r\n\r\nwe  will provide additional incentives to make training  more\r\n\r\naffordable  to  employers and employees or to those  who  are\r\n\r\nunemployed during these difficult times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we will encourage more companies not to\r\n\r\ndownsize   too   quickly   but   to   try   alternatives   to\r\n\r\nretrenchments.  Affected companies can put their  workers  on\r\n\r\nvoluntary pay-cut, shorter work-weeks or make use of the  SRP\r\n\r\nto send redundant workers for full-time skills upgrading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise, however, that some companies would have no\r\n\r\nchoice  but  to  retrench workers.   If  necessary,  we  will\r\n\r\norganise  job fairs and other employment facilitation  events\r\n\r\nas  we  had  done two years ago in 1998, during the  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be harder for older and less educated retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers to find new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njobs,  especially in totally new sectors or  industries.   To\r\n\r\nhelp   them  make  the  transition,  we  are  considering   a\r\n\r\ntraineeship programme to help older workers.  The idea is  to\r\n\r\nhelp employers to recruit such retrenched workers to ease the\r\n\r\ntransition to a new industry sector and work environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, the success of our efforts will\r\n\r\nalso  depend  on  the  willingness of unemployed  workers  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  their  skills and to adapt to a more  difficult  job\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his other question, let me explain that\r\n\r\nour  foreign manpower policy is to maintain a controlled  and\r\n\r\nrevolving   pool   of   unskilled   foreign   workers   while\r\n\r\nfacilitating   the   recruitment  of   global   talents   and\r\n\r\nprofessionals.  Hence, for unskilled foreign workers on  work\r\n\r\npermits,  we  have control mechanisms, such  as  the  foreign\r\n\r\nworker  levy and dependency ceiling, to ensure that employers\r\n\r\ndo  not become over-reliant on foreign workers at the expense\r\n\r\nof local workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even in an economic downturn, as my colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Trade and Industry, had  already  touched\r\n\r\nupon,  we  cannot  totally deny employers access  to  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  or  require them to fill vacancies with  only  local\r\n\r\nworkers.   This is because there are companies  with  genuine\r\n\r\nneeds for foreign workers to perform jobs that locals do  not\r\n\r\nhave the skills for, or jobs which many local workers are not\r\n\r\nprepared  to  do.   Direct  intervention  beyond  the   broad\r\n\r\ncontrols  will  only result in hardship for these  companies.\r\n\r\nThis  could prompt them to relocate to neighbouring countries\r\n\r\nwhere  it  is easier to recruit workers at much lower  wages.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, instead of saving jobs for Singaporeans, we\r\n\r\nwill end up losing more jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of highly skilled workers, we should not\r\n\r\nprevent  employers  from recruiting the global  talents  that\r\n\r\nthey  need.   Even as we ride the downturn, we must  bear  in\r\n\r\nmind that the availability of skilled workers will be the key\r\n\r\nto future\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuccess  in  competition.  Talents will be critical  for  our\r\n\r\nlong-term  viability.  If we make it difficult for  companies\r\n\r\nto  meet their skilled manpower needs, our attractiveness  as\r\n\r\nan  open  business-friendly location will diminish.   Closing\r\n\r\nthe  door  to global talents now will send a wrong signal  to\r\n\r\nthe  people whom we are trying to attract, and it will do  us\r\n\r\nharm in the long term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will help local workers with upgrading and skills\r\n\r\nconversion programmes which I have mentioned earlier on in my\r\n\r\nreply  to the hon. Member's first question.  These programmes\r\n\r\nwill  be  broadened and enhanced to help, in particular,  the\r\n\r\nolder workers.  The best way to help in a downturn is to  arm\r\n\r\nour  people  with the skills which they will need  to  remain\r\n\r\nemployable in a changing job market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, can I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  tell us what is the success rate in  persuading\r\n\r\nemployers   to   look   at  alternatives  to   retrenchments,\r\n\r\nparticularly the use of a flexible wage system?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I think employers are quite\r\n\r\namenable  to this suggestion.

I\r\n\r\nunderstand that, at least in the unionised sector, there  are\r\n\r\nalready  about 30,000 workers who are on such alternative-to-retrenchment programmes, either voluntary pay-cut or  shorter\r\n\r\nwork-week or some other form of adjustment, including sending\r\n\r\nworkers  who  are  due for retrenchment  or  who  are  facing\r\n\r\nretrenchment to full-time Skills Redevelopment Programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, I would say that employers are cooperative\r\n\r\nand  they will try to help wherever possible.  But, as I have\r\n\r\nsaid in my answer, there will always be those companies which\r\n\r\nare  facing  such  enormous difficulties that  they  have  no\r\n\r\nrecourse but to let people go.

One  main\r\n\r\nreason  would be that these workers may not have  the  skills\r\n\r\nthat  are required for the new jobs.  Very often, it  is  the\r\n\r\nolder  workers  who face this problem, ie, workers  with  low\r\n\r\neducation,  perhaps  in  their  late  40s,  who   have   this\r\n\r\ndifficulty  of  finding  an alternative  job.   Even  if  the\r\n\r\neconomy slows down to the lower end of the estimate of  about\r\n\r\nhalf  percent  for  the  whole year, we  do  not  expect  the\r\n\r\nretrenchment  figure  to  exceed  the  number  that  we  have\r\n\r\nexperienced   in   1998  when  about  29,000   workers   were\r\n\r\nretrenched.  As to the number of workers who are at  risk,  I\r\n\r\nthink it will be much less than in 1998.  We expect our whole\r\n\r\nyear  retrenchment to be around 20,000, which is already much\r\n\r\nmore than what it was last year, at 11,600.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what we can do to help this group of workers, we\r\n\r\nshould  not think of them as totally unemployable.  They  may\r\n\r\nhave greater difficulty looking for jobs, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  believe that even the lower educated older worker can make\r\n\r\na contribution provided the worker himself is willing to also\r\n\r\nmake an effort.  As I have explained earlier on, we have many\r\n\r\nprogrammes that can help him to acquire a skill to take on  a\r\n\r\njob  in  a different sector.  He may not have the ability  to\r\n\r\nupgrade his skills in the sector that he has been working in,\r\n\r\nfor  instance,  in  the electronics industry,  where  we  are\r\n\r\nseeing  the majority of the retrenchments taking  place.   He\r\n\r\nmay  not have the ability to upgrade his skills to do the job\r\n\r\nin  the  new  type of manufacturing industry where  he  would\r\n\r\nrequire   sophisticated  computer  skills  to  operate   very\r\n\r\nsophisticated  production equipment.  But, certainly,  he  or\r\n\r\nshe  can  be  trained for a job in the services sector.   And\r\n\r\ntoday,  we  still  have quite a number of  vacancies  in  the\r\n\r\nservices sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned some weeks ago, in one exercise that we\r\n\r\ncarried out, we managed to find employers who could offer  us\r\n\r\n400  vacancies.   So  workers who  are  retrenched  from  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector need not be deemed  unemployable.  They\r\n\r\nhave  temporarily  lost their jobs.   We  can  help  them  to\r\n\r\nacquire  a skill to move into the services sector.   We  hope\r\n\r\nthat they would take up this offer and come forward.  We will\r\n\r\nhelp  to  retrain them so that they can take on this job  and\r\n\r\nminimise  the  trauma or difficulties that the  family  would\r\n\r\nface with prolonged unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, has the Government spent money\r\n\r\nto  train  foreign  workers or to  upgrade  their  skills  in\r\n\r\npreference to local workers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, most of our investment in skills\r\n\r\nupgrading  and  training  goes  to  the  local  workers.  The\r\n\r\npriority  in  all  our  retraining programmes  is  for  local\r\n\r\nworkers.  I have said this many times before in this  Chamber\r\n\r\nthat  we  encourage our employers to recruit foreign  workers\r\n\r\nwho  are  already capable of doing the job,  rather  than  to\r\n\r\nbring  unskilled foreign workers to Singapore and  send  them\r\n\r\nfor  training. After all, they have such a wide choice  here.\r\n\r\nWe always have millions of unemployed people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noutside  who  are  looking for jobs.

Sir, today, if they\r\n\r\nbring in an unskilled foreign construction worker, they  have\r\n\r\nto  pay  a monthly levy of about $470.  That is to discourage\r\n\r\nthe  contractor  from  bringing in an  unskilled  worker  and\r\n\r\nsending  him  to  our  Building and Construction  Authority's\r\n\r\ntraining  school for training.  If they bring  in  a  skilled\r\n\r\nworker, we only charge a levy of $30.  So, they should go out\r\n\r\nthere,  look  for skilled construction workers, recruit  them\r\n\r\nand  save  over  $400  per worker.  Do  not  clutter  up  our\r\n\r\ntraining centres with foreign workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Two supplementary\r\n\r\nquestions,   Sir.   What  service  sector  is  the   Minister\r\n\r\nreferring  to  when  he says that older, unskilled  or  lower\r\n\r\nskilled workers can be deployed?  Secondly, would this sector\r\n\r\nprovide  the  same  kind  of pay benefits  or  a  lower  pay,\r\n\r\nresulting in a lower income for these workers?  I would  also\r\n\r\nlike  to  know  specifically what are the measures  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry is taking to help this group of workers to switch to\r\n\r\nanother service sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, the Member asked what are the\r\n\r\nservice  sectors  where there are still  jobs  available.   I\r\n\r\ncould  give  him  some  examples.  For instance,  the  retail\r\n\r\nindustry, hotels, food and beverage, food services  and  food\r\n\r\nproduction  and manufacturing.  We found 400 jobs  which  are\r\n\r\navailable  within  these sectors that I have  mentioned.   He\r\n\r\nasked whether the pay is much lower than in the manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector.  The good news is that, in many instances, the pay is\r\n\r\nalmost  the  same  as in the manufacturing sector.   In  some\r\n\r\ncases,  in  fact,  the pay is actually  higher  than  in  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector.

I\r\n\r\nmentioned  in my answer to the question from Mr Ong  that  we\r\n\r\nare  considering a programme where we will help companies  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  these workers, that is, we will give them  financial\r\n\r\nincentives  to  recruit  these older  workers  and  put  them\r\n\r\nthrough  a proper training programme. If you are an employer,\r\n\r\nand  you  are  prepared  to  take  in  this  group  of  older\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers, we will help you.  We will  provide  you\r\n\r\nwith  financial support for a period of time  while  you  are\r\n\r\ntraining  the workers.

If you are prepared to put in  the  effort  to\r\n\r\ntrain  the  older workers, we are prepared to give  you  some\r\n\r\nfinancial assistance over a period of time so that the  older\r\n\r\nworkers will find it easier to acquire a skill and to  adjust\r\n\r\nto the new working environment and, hopefully, settle down in\r\n\r\nthe new jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Could the Minister clarify further\r\n\r\nwhat  sort  of  financial  scheme  he  is  offering  to   the\r\n\r\nemployers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I emphasised in my response that\r\n\r\nwe   are  considering  this  programme.

But  many\r\n\r\nseem  to  have  the  impression that for the  middle  tier  - technical jobs that polytechnic graduates and so on  will  be\r\n\r\neligible for - there is an excessive reliance by employers on\r\n\r\ncheaper,  foreign  alternatives in that  sphere.   Could  the\r\n\r\nMinister  elaborate whether that is borne out  by  the  facts\r\n\r\nand,  more importantly, whether there is any measure in place\r\n\r\nto ensure that such excessive reliance is prevented?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, of course, during difficult\r\n\r\ntimes,  Singaporeans who face the competition will feel  this\r\n\r\nnatural  reaction against foreigners who are  competing  with\r\n\r\nthem  in their area, especially those in the middle level  or\r\n\r\nin  the  technical jobs.  But the reality is  that  companies\r\n\r\nthat  recruit middle-level technical staff very often do have\r\n\r\ndifficulties finding sufficient local employees to fill their\r\n\r\nvacancies  or  to meet their demands.  Let  me  give  you  an\r\n\r\nexample.   We have several petrochemical companies in  Jurong\r\n\r\nIsland.  They  offer very attractive jobs.  But  for  a  long\r\n\r\ntime, these companies have not been able to find a sufficient\r\n\r\nnumber  of Singaporeans who are willing to take on  the  jobs\r\n\r\nthat  they have on offer.  The job comes with a 12-hour shift\r\n\r\npattern and is in a fairly remote location and it is a fairly\r\n\r\ndemanding job.  Very few Singaporeans are prepared to take on\r\n\r\nthis  job.  Should we insist that they take Singaporeans only\r\n\r\nand  delay their operations until they fill up the posts over\r\n\r\ntime  with Singaporeans who are prepared to do it?  Or should\r\n\r\nwe  expect them to increase the pay to a point where they can\r\n\r\novercome the Singaporeans' reluctance to take on these rather\r\n\r\ndifficult  jobs?  If we do so, we are liable  to  make  these\r\n\r\nindustries  uncompetitive where they are located.   We  might\r\n\r\nlose  the whole industry completely, which means we will lose\r\n\r\neven more value-added to the economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our problem is to find a balance and we have to leave it\r\n\r\nto  the employers to make this decision about who in fact can\r\n\r\nmake  bigger  and  more valuable contributions  to  help  the\r\n\r\ncompany to remain competitive.  But, overall, we do have some\r\n\r\nguidelines and controls to ensure that employers just do  not\r\n\r\nbring  in  foreigners purely on the basis of  lower  salaries\r\n\r\nwithout  regard to their ability to contribute.  So  when  we\r\n\r\nprocess applications for employment pass, we do look  at  the\r\n\r\nqualifications and work experiences of these people to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  they are in fact reasonably suitable for the particular\r\n\r\njob in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Besides MOM's employment\r\n\r\nservice, can the Minister tell us whether there are any other\r\n\r\norganisations where all these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunemployed  people can turn to for assistance for  new  jobs?\r\n\r\nCan  the  Minister also confirm that the Skills Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme is in fact only applicable to Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, there are of course many other\r\n\r\nprivate  sector employment agencies apart from my  Ministry's\r\n\r\nCareerLink.

Under this scheme, households  living\r\n\r\nin  1-,  2-, 3-, 4- and 5-room HDB flats will each receive  a\r\n\r\ngrant of between $250 and $350 in FY2001, this year,  to help\r\n\r\nthem  pay  part of their electricity and water charges.

They\r\n\r\nare  no  longer  competing  in  a  domestic  market,  against\r\n\r\ndomestic  competitors, and not even in the immediate regional\r\n\r\nmarket.  They either make it against global players,  whether\r\n\r\nin  the  Singapore,  Asian and global markets,  or  they  get\r\n\r\nmarginalised.

So  like  other\r\n\r\nSingapore  companies, if they cannot compete  with  the  best\r\n\r\nthey  will end up as marginal players, both in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nabroad.

As  for  John  Olds,  DBS  has  stated  that  he  had\r\n\r\nestablished  a  clear  vision,  guided  the  development   of\r\n\r\ninternal  changes in systems and processes that improved  the\r\n\r\nbank's  financial  performance,  helped  attract  world-class\r\n\r\ntalent at all levels, and laid a strong foundation for future\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are in a new global market environment. We\r\n\r\neither  go with the market,  and bring in the best talent  to\r\n\r\nhelp us compete, or we drop out and accept a mediocre future.\r\n\r\nWithout  top talent, we will not be able to build world-class\r\n\r\ncompanies  that all Singaporeans can be proud of and  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom.   Singaporeans cannot afford to resent the remuneration\r\n\r\npackages  that the top performers in banking, the professions\r\n\r\nand  industry  receive.   The size of their  remuneration  is\r\n\r\ninsignificant when measured against the value they create for\r\n\r\nshareholders,   and  the  jobs  and  wages  that   successful\r\n\r\nSingapore companies will generate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The competition for top talent is intense. If we are\r\n\r\nnot prepared to pay, we will not get the best people, and not\r\n\r\neven  the second best.  They will go elsewhere. So if we work\r\n\r\nup  public  opinion  against the high rewards  that  the  top\r\n\r\nperformers get, our companies are not going to make  it,  and\r\n\r\nSingapore is not going to make it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, in answer to a specific question, we\r\n\r\nhave had the Minister go into a lot of generalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Can you ask your question, please?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, as I now understand it, the payment\r\n\r\nto  Mr Olds was compensation or gratuity, and not salary  for\r\n\r\nthe year 2000.

These measures are in three major areas:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Pitching CL at a level of difficulty attainable by\r\n\r\nthe vast majority of students;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Regenerating Chinese literary elite by increasing\r\n\r\nthe number of students offering Higher Chinese (HCL); and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Helping students with extreme difficulty in CL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these measures have been implemented on schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the primary and secondary school CL syllabuses\r\n\r\nhave been revised and the word lists updated to pitch CL at a\r\n\r\nlevel  of  difficulty  attainable by  the  vast  majority  of\r\n\r\nstudents.   CL  Heads of Department and key CL teachers  have\r\n\r\nbeen briefed on the changes.  MOE officers are currently\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeveloping  the new instructional materials for  primary  and\r\n\r\nsecondary school levels based on the revised syllabuses.  The\r\n\r\nrevised  syllabuses and textbooks will be phased in by  level\r\n\r\nfrom  the year 2002.  As an interim measure, guidelines  were\r\n\r\nissued to schools in mid-1999 to help teachers omit the  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  parts of the existing textbooks and even  out  the\r\n\r\nlearning load of the students.  Appropriate adjustments  have\r\n\r\nalso been made to the respective CL examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the four key measures introduced to allow more\r\n\r\nstudents to offer Higher Chinese (HCL) have proven effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More primary school pupils are offering Higher Chinese\r\n\r\nat Primary 5.  As a result of efforts to encourage pupils who\r\n\r\nhave the ability to offer Higher Chinese to opt to do so, the\r\n\r\nproportion of P5 students who opted to do Higher Chinese  has\r\n\r\nincreased from 22.0% in 1999 to 25.7% in 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also allowed more students to offer Higher\r\n\r\nChinese in Secondary 1.  As a result of this initiative,  the\r\n\r\nproportion of Secondary 1 cohort who opted for Higher Chinese\r\n\r\nhas  increased from 15.5% of the Secondary 1 cohort  in  1999\r\n\r\nand 16.5% in 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also set up the 10th SAP school, Nan Hua Secondary,\r\n\r\nin  the year 2000.  The proportion of Higher Chinese students\r\n\r\nin its Secondary 1 intake was 73% in the year 2000 and 78% in\r\n\r\n2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the pre-university level, we set up the third Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage  Elective Programme (CLEP) centre in Nanyang  Junior\r\n\r\nCollege.   More  Chinese Language Elective scholarships  have\r\n\r\nalso  been made available.  Following these initiatives,  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  JC  students  in  the Chinese  Language  Elective\r\n\r\nProgramme increased from 204 in 1999 in the two JCs to 276 in\r\n\r\nthe year 2001 across the three JCs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Academic Year 2002/2003 onwards, students who have\r\n\r\ndone well in Chinese Language or Higher Chinese at `A'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor `AO' level will be given bonus points for admission to the\r\n\r\nChinese Language and Chinese Studies courses offered  by  NUS\r\n\r\nand  the Communications Studies courses offered by NTU.  (The\r\n\r\nbonus  points for entry to the Communications Studies  course\r\n\r\nare  also available to students who have done well in Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage,  Malay Language and Tamil Language).  The  Ministry\r\n\r\nwill   monitor   the   effect  of  this  measure   upon   its\r\n\r\nimplementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I will touch on the implementation of CL \"B\"\r\n\r\nwhich caters to students who face exceptional difficulties in\r\n\r\nthe learning of the standard CL syllabuses.  The CL \"B\" paper\r\n\r\nplaces  greater  emphasis on the testing of  the  candidates'\r\n\r\naural/oral  skills,  40% weighting for this  as  against  20%\r\n\r\npreviously, and less on the writing skills.  For example, 20%\r\n\r\nweighting  to composition versus 35% previously.   To  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  standard of the CL \"B\" papers is  pitched  at  the\r\n\r\nappropriate  level,  the  Ministry  has  conducted  extensive\r\n\r\nconsultation and trial testing of the specimen papers on  the\r\n\r\ntarget group of students likely to offer CL \"B\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals decide on the students' ability for CL \"B\"\r\n\r\nbased  on  a  set of Eligibility Criteria that  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nannounced in end-1999.  These students will be able  to  pass\r\n\r\nCL \"B\" if they put in reasonable effort.  At the Secondary  3\r\n\r\nlevel  this year, 45 pupils opted to offer CL \"B\".  They  are\r\n\r\nattending lessons at 5 CL \"B\" Centres located in the 4 zones.\r\n\r\nThe  total number of Secondary 4 students who registered  for\r\n\r\nSecondary 4 CL \"B\" examination in 2001 so far is 189.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the feedback obtained from schools which\r\n\r\nhave  Secondary  3  CL  \"B\" eligible students,  most  parents\r\n\r\nrequested  that  their children be allowed to  continue  with\r\n\r\nstandard  CL and would consider CL \"B\" only if these children\r\n\r\nreally  cannot cope with the standard CL syllabus.   The  low\r\n\r\nnumber of CL \"B\" students is a natural outcome at this  stage\r\n\r\nas  most students and parents are keeping their options open.\r\n\r\nThe  schools will monitor the performance of Secondary  3  CL\r\n\r\n\"B\" eligible students who continued\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  standard  CL  and will discuss with the  parents  their\r\n\r\nchildren's progress if they cannot cope with standard CL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MOTHER TONGUE LANGUAGE TEACHING AWARD SCHEME</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Education\r\n\r\n(a)  how many teachers have benefited from the Mother  Tongue\r\n\r\nLanguage Teaching Award Scheme; and (b) whether there is  any\r\n\r\nplan  to  provide more incentives to encourage mother  tongue\r\n\r\nlanguage teachers to further their studies and upgrade  their\r\n\r\nprofessional level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nUndergraduate Award for Mother Tongue Language (MTL)  Studies\r\n\r\nwas  implemented last year.

Let  me  first\r\n\r\nexplain  the philosophy and principles underlying the current\r\n\r\ncompetitive framework for the provision of basic  public  bus\r\n\r\nservices,  so  that  we  can  better  appreciate  the  issues\r\n\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have two basic public bus operators, each\r\n\r\nserving  different territories on the island.  In return  for\r\n\r\nthis   privilege  of  being  the  sole  operators  in   their\r\n\r\nrespective  territories, the Public Transport  Council  (PTC)\r\n\r\nimposes on them the Universal Service Obligation, or USO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the USO, each public bus operator has to provide a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive bus service in the territories allocated to it,\r\n\r\nregardless  of  the  profitability of the route.  Apart  from\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  coverage to ensure that all  commuters  within\r\n\r\nits  territory are served, it has to run services  throughout\r\n\r\nthe day at specific frequencies, even when the demand is low,\r\n\r\nin order to maintain a reasonable level of service throughout\r\n\r\nthe  day.  In effect, the high demand periods make up for the\r\n\r\nlow  demand  periods on the same route, eg,  during  late  at\r\n\r\nnight.   This  industry framework, which relies on  extensive\r\n\r\ncross  subsidy  across routes as well as  time  of  the  day,\r\n\r\nensures  that  all  commuters have access to  convenient  and\r\n\r\nquality bus services throughout the day, and at a uniform set\r\n\r\nof affordable fares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Choon Kang, Mr Chiam See Tong, Mr Chng Hee Kok\r\n\r\nand  Mr Low Thia Khiang have asked about allowing private bus\r\n\r\noperators  to operate a lower-cost service to supplement  the\r\n\r\nfeeder  bus service at peak hours, and about opening  up  the\r\n\r\nbus  market  to more competition.  Such a move  would  entail\r\n\r\nseveral crucial implications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing private bus operators to selectively choose the\r\n\r\nmost profitable times and routes for their services, in other\r\n\r\nwords, to cherry-pick, will adversely affect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  ability of the existing operators to continue to provide\r\n\r\nservices  to  low demand areas or during low demand  periods.\r\n\r\nThe Government has therefore been careful not to allow cherry-picking,  as  private  operators do  not  need  to  bear  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility   of   running  regular   whole-day   services\r\n\r\nthroughout an area - whether profitable or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about allowing free competition in the provision of\r\n\r\nbasic  feeder  bus services in a selected HDB  estate?   Free\r\n\r\ncompetition implies that the new feeder operator will be free\r\n\r\nto  compete on fares, and on the level of service.   Such  an\r\n\r\narrangement  will also have to be extended  to  the  existing\r\n\r\nfeeder  bus  operator.  One outcome could  be  that  the  bus\r\n\r\noperators will compete aggressively along the corridors  with\r\n\r\nheavy  demand in the designated estate, and during  the  peak\r\n\r\nhours  when passengers are plentiful.  However, residents  in\r\n\r\nthe  outlying parts of the designated estate may end up  with\r\n\r\nless  frequent services, since the operators will  have  less\r\n\r\nability to cross-subsidise them.  Off peak hour services  may\r\n\r\nalso end up being unacceptably infrequent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are keeping an open mind on the issue of\r\n\r\nenhancing competition.  My Ministry and PTC will study  under\r\n\r\nwhat  circumstances  and  conditions  we  can  allow  private\r\n\r\noperators  to operate feeder services.  As this is a  complex\r\n\r\nissue,  PTC will need some time to fully examine the  options\r\n\r\nand their implications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo asked about the measures that will be taken to\r\n\r\nease  overcrowding  during peak hours.  First,  let  me  give\r\n\r\nMembers  a brief overview of the service quality of  the  two\r\n\r\npublic bus operators.  A recent audit commissioned by the PTC\r\n\r\nshowed  that  SBS and TIBS comply with most of the  standards\r\n\r\nset   out  in  the  Basic  Bus  Service  Specifications   and\r\n\r\nStandards.  The survey showed that overall, there is  a  high\r\n\r\nlevel   of  bus  service,  especially  in  terms  of  service\r\n\r\ncoverage,  availability and frequency.  This was  also  borne\r\n\r\nout  in  a  recent independent survey carried out by  Zaobao.\r\n\r\nThe  survey showed that 9 in 10 persons polled said that  the\r\n\r\npublic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntransport here is efficient and reliable, and two-thirds said\r\n\r\nthat  the public transport in Singapore is world-class.  This\r\n\r\nis no small achievement.  Many Singaporeans who have used the\r\n\r\npublic transport system in other countries do realise that we\r\n\r\nhave  an  affordable,  good quality public  transport  system\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, while overall service quality is good,\r\n\r\nthere  is  room for improvement during the peak  within  peak\r\n\r\nperiod.   While commuters accept that buses will be  crowded,\r\n\r\nand  even packed, during this period, they expect to be  able\r\n\r\nto board their buses without having to wait too long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bus companies have assured PTC that they have, in\r\n\r\nfact,  been  putting  in more bus capacity  to  address  this\r\n\r\nchallenge.   In  the last three years, SBS has increased  its\r\n\r\ncapacity  by 5% although ridership has dropped by  3%.   TIBS\r\n\r\nhas  expanded  its  fleet by 213 buses.  In  effect,  it  has\r\n\r\nincreased its bus capacity by 58%, even though ridership  has\r\n\r\nonly  increased  by 36%.  Both companies have  also  injected\r\n\r\nmore  buses  into  congested routes  through  better  vehicle\r\n\r\nmanagement, and have increased the number of mid-trip  buses,\r\n\r\nto provide downstream commuters with empty buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can assure Dr Vasoo that PTC will continue to\r\n\r\nclosely  monitor  the situation.  Where the  overcrowding  is\r\n\r\nespecially  problematic on a particular  service  during  the\r\n\r\npeak within peak period, the bus operator will be required to\r\n\r\nput in more buses to expand capacity to meet demand.  PTC  is\r\n\r\nnow  discussing with the bus companies on expanding their bus\r\n\r\nfleet with more double decker or Bendy buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, if there is evidence to suggest that\r\n\r\nthe  public bus operators are not able to take any action  to\r\n\r\nease  the  overcrowding situation, PTC will consider  opening\r\n\r\nthese  routes to private bus operators.  The last  time  this\r\n\r\nhappened was in 1998 when selected bus routes were offered to\r\n\r\nprivate  bus operators during the peak within peak period  to\r\n\r\nhelp  meet  the  high  demand.   However,  the  private   bus\r\n\r\noperators that took part\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  providing the supplementary services withdrew  them  only\r\n\r\nafter  less  than 12 months.    In summary, the  current  bus\r\n\r\nframework   provides   bus  commuters  with   good   quality,\r\n\r\naffordable  bus  services  at all  times  of  the  day.   Bus\r\n\r\ncommuters do get good value for their money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is still room for improvement, especially\r\n\r\nin certain services during the peak within peak period.  This\r\n\r\nwill be a continuing challenge for the bus companies, as  new\r\n\r\nhousing  estates  are developed and existing  ones  expanded,\r\n\r\nresulting  in  changes in demand.  I have asked  the  PTC  to\r\n\r\nclosely monitor the performance of the bus companies, and  to\r\n\r\nwork  with  them to ensure that they are indeed  meeting  the\r\n\r\nquality of service standards set by the PTC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the Government consider\r\n\r\nSBS  and  TIBS as private commercial companies, or  are  they\r\n\r\nrequired to provide a public service?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Why is the Government asking the bus companies to\r\n\r\nprovide cross subsidies in order to achieve the so-called USO\r\n\r\nand seamless transportation system?  Is the Government trying\r\n\r\nto have the cake and eat it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Will the Government consider providing grants to\r\n\r\ncompanies to run unprofitable bus routes, and that  opens  up\r\n\r\nthe market for competition for other operators to come in?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the two bus companies are\r\n\r\nindeed private bus companies.  As to why they are required to\r\n\r\nperform the USO, this is a fairly standard procedure  in  the\r\n\r\nmanagement of public bus services.  In any country, or in any\r\n\r\ncity,  it is not possible for all routes to be equally served\r\n\r\nunless they are priced properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways of pricing them properly. One is to\r\n\r\nallow free market to rein, which means that in the areas with\r\n\r\nlow  ridership or low demand, the operators will then provide\r\n\r\na service that is fairly infrequent or they should be pricing\r\n\r\nthe  service  in order to recover cost, which means  for  the\r\n\r\noutlying  areas, people have to pay a lot more  for  the  bus\r\n\r\nservices.   The  other  way is to allow  cross  subsidy,  ie,\r\n\r\nduring  the  period  when the demand is very  high,  the  bus\r\n\r\ncompany  is able to make money and that will then  cover  the\r\n\r\nhigher  cost during the low demand period, and which  is  why\r\n\r\nthe  USO  is  in fact a device to safeguard the  interest  of\r\n\r\ncommuters  wherever  they are living.  This  way,  they  have\r\n\r\naccess to a fairly uniform quality of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of grants to run unprofitable routes, it is\r\n\r\nbest  for  the  Government not to be  involved  in  providing\r\n\r\ngrants  to actually cover the operating cost of those routes.\r\n\r\nIt  is better that the services be operated commercially  and\r\n\r\nthat  the  operators  recover the  operating  cost  from  the\r\n\r\ncommuters  directly, rather than through  a  grant  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

Mr S. Iswaran and Dr Ker Sin\r\n\r\nTze asked about the effects of consolidation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  competition and the availability of banking  services  to\r\n\r\nSMEs.   These are important questions prompted by the process\r\n\r\nof consolidation that is currently underway. OCBC has made  a\r\n\r\nbid  for  Keppel Capital Holdings, which owns  Keppel  TatLee\r\n\r\nBank,  and DBS and UOB have made competing bids for OUB.   If\r\n\r\nthese  offers are successful, we will have fewer  but  larger\r\n\r\nlocal banks.  Since this is an important issue, I am making a\r\n\r\nMinisterial Statement and then we can have questions and full\r\n\r\ndiscussion after that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans are understandably concerned about how\r\n\r\nbank  consolidation  might affect them.  I  appreciate  their\r\n\r\nconcerns.   Let  me explain why consolidation is  unavoidable\r\n\r\nfor  the  banking industry and more importantly is  good  for\r\n\r\nSingapore, and let me also explain how some of these concerns\r\n\r\ncan be met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Importance of Consolidation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banking industry is undergoing dramatic change\r\n\r\neverywhere.   Unless the local banks upgrade  themselves  and\r\n\r\nkeep  up  with  the  changes,  they  will  become  weak   and\r\n\r\nmarginalised,   even  in  Singapore.   Consolidation   is   a\r\n\r\nworldwide  trend in banking, and is an essential  element  in\r\n\r\nthe upgrading of local banks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the local banks could maintain their market\r\n\r\npositions  and grow organically as the economy grew  year  by\r\n\r\nyear, so long as they conducted their business prudently  and\r\n\r\navoided  mishaps.   But that was in a different  environment,\r\n\r\nwith   limited  foreign  competition  and  a  slow  pace   of\r\n\r\ninnovation.   Today competition is fierce and  technology  is\r\n\r\nchanging  rapidly.   The industry is characterised  by  large\r\n\r\neconomies  of  scale,  putting  a  high  premium   on   size.\r\n\r\nInvestors demand that banks earn competitive returns, or else\r\n\r\nthey  will punish their share prices.  Small banks simply  do\r\n\r\nnot  have the resources to compete.  They are unable to  out-perform larger banks, either in the quality of service or  in\r\n\r\nreturns to shareholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even large international banks, many times the size of\r\n\r\nSingapore banks, feel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  pressure  to grow still larger.  They have been  merging\r\n\r\namong  themselves,  becoming what  analysts  call  \"Godzilla\"\r\n\r\nbanks.  Deutsche Bank, at one time among the largest banks in\r\n\r\nthe  world,  feels  the need for a merger  partner.   Smaller\r\n\r\nbanks  throughout the world have merged with  each  other  or\r\n\r\nhave been swallowed by these Godzilla banks.  The largest  of\r\n\r\nthe  Godzilla  banks  is  Citigroup, with  an  estimated  100\r\n\r\nmillion  customers worldwide.  HSBC has 20 million,  and  ABN\r\n\r\nAmro  13.5  million.   Their  size  enables  them  to  invest\r\n\r\nbillions   of   dollars   in  the   latest   technology   and\r\n\r\nsophisticated systems.  Because they can spread  these  costs\r\n\r\nover  millions of customers world-wide, they can  efficiently\r\n\r\ndeliver  a  wide-range  of customised products  at  low  unit\r\n\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is fewer but much bigger banks. Over the\r\n\r\npast  decade,  the  number of banks in  small  countries  has\r\n\r\nfallen  significantly.  In Sweden, the number  fell  by  75%.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland,  with  a GDP and a population  about  twice  our\r\n\r\nsize,  now has only two big banks - UBS and Credit  Suisse  - both   world-class players.  The Netherlands, four  times  as\r\n\r\nbig  as  Singapore, has three - ABN-Amro, Rabobank  and  ING,\r\n\r\nplus Fortis which is partially Belgian.  Australia, which  is\r\n\r\nslightly  bigger  than the Netherlands,  also  has  four  big\r\n\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's economy is 1/4 the size of Australia's.\r\n\r\nSingapore cannot support five local banks.  Our biggest  bank\r\n\r\nDBS, even after the merger with POSBank, is ranked only 115th\r\n\r\nin  the  world  by  asset  size.  The  logic  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\ncircumstances is inescapable:  if we want strong banks,  then\r\n\r\nthey  have to be big banks, and if they are to be big  banks,\r\n\r\nthen they must consolidate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any merger between the local banks will not create a\r\n\r\nGodzilla  bank.   The merged entity will still  be  small  by\r\n\r\ninternational  standards.   What  the  Godzillas  are   doing\r\n\r\ninvolves  scale  economies that the local  banks  cannot  get\r\n\r\nanywhere  close to. Some might argue therefore  that  whether\r\n\r\nthe  local  banks  are  very small or  just  small  makes  no\r\n\r\ndifference to their ability to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompete.  But this view is incorrect.  Local banks can derive\r\n\r\nmeaningful  scale  economies if  they  merge,  especially  in\r\n\r\nattracting   talent   and   building   capabilities.    Local\r\n\r\nconsolidation can create viable Singapore banks that can hold\r\n\r\ntheir  own in the local market without Government protection,\r\n\r\nand  compete  in  selected foreign markets.   They  will  not\r\n\r\ncompete  globally with the big players, nor can they  compete\r\n\r\nin  every product line.  But they should be strong enough  to\r\n\r\navoid  being  completely marginalised, at home and  in  Asia.\r\n\r\nThey  will  be  in  a  position  to  expand  through  careful\r\n\r\nacquisitions  abroad over time, rather than be left  with  no\r\n\r\nchoice but eventually be acquired by foreign players.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the giant international banks are already\r\n\r\noperating  in  Singapore, some since before the  local  banks\r\n\r\nwere  founded.   They  have a large share  of  the  wholesale\r\n\r\nbanking  market,  serving large companies  and  international\r\n\r\ncustomers.  Several have sizeable retail operations as  well.\r\n\r\nIf  the local banks remain small, they have no hope of making\r\n\r\nthe  necessary  investments in technology, or attracting  the\r\n\r\ntalent  to  compete with these world-class  foreign  players.\r\n\r\nTheir  service standards and product range will fall  behind.\r\n\r\nCustomers, especially the more sophisticated ones, will  take\r\n\r\ntheir business to the foreign banks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will happen even if we do not liberalise the\r\n\r\nbanking  industry.   The more innovative foreign  banks  here\r\n\r\nhave  been  able  to  grow  their market  share  despite  the\r\n\r\nrestrictions  that MAS has placed on their operations.   Over\r\n\r\ntime,  local banks that cannot compete would become weak  and\r\n\r\nmarginalised.   At best they would operate  at  the  fringes,\r\n\r\nserving niche markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would not be a good outcome for Singapore. Banks\r\n\r\nare  a  core  part  of our financial system  and  affect  the\r\n\r\nstability of our economy.  Without a group of strong and well-managed local banks, we risk instability in the event  of  an\r\n\r\neconomic or market crisis.  We saw this in many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAsian countries during the Asian financial crisis.  It is not\r\n\r\nprudent  to  rely solely on the foreign banks  because  in  a\r\n\r\ncrisis, banks which are more deeply rooted in Singapore  will\r\n\r\nbe  more  likely  to  act in support  of  our  financial  and\r\n\r\neconomic  stability.  Foreign banks will  have  large  global\r\n\r\noperations, but the commercial interests of local banks  will\r\n\r\nbe  more  closely aligned with that of the Singapore economy.\r\n\r\nThat  is why MAS remains committed to fostering strong  local\r\n\r\nbanks with a major share of the domestic market.  And that is\r\n\r\nwhy we need banking consolidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Competition in the Banking Industry</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran has expressed concern that large banks will\r\n\r\nengage  in  anti-competitive practices to  the  detriment  of\r\n\r\nsmall  depositors.  The Government will not allow an enlarged\r\n\r\nbank,  or a few dominant banks, to use their market power  to\r\n\r\nengage  in  monopolistic or anti-competitive practices,  that\r\n\r\ndiminish  consumer  choice or block entry by  other  players.\r\n\r\nMAS  does not think that this is likely because none  of  the\r\n\r\npost-merger banks will be big enough to become over-dominant.\r\n\r\nEven  if  OUB  merges  with one of the  larger  banks,  their\r\n\r\ncombined market share of non-bank deposits will be about 30%,\r\n\r\nstill  significantly less than the share of the largest banks\r\n\r\nin other small countries.  The single largest bank in Finland\r\n\r\nhas  about  40% market share, about the same as the  combined\r\n\r\nmarket share of HSBC and Hang Seng Bank in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a small country, we have to accept a more\r\n\r\nconcentrated  banking industry, in which  the  largest  banks\r\n\r\nhave  a sizeable market share.  MAS believes that there  will\r\n\r\nbe  sufficient competition in the banking industry even after\r\n\r\nconsolidation.   The  foreign banks  will  probably  increase\r\n\r\ntheir  share  of the retail market and will provide  vigorous\r\n\r\ncompetition.   MAS'  banking  liberalisation  programme  will\r\n\r\nenhance this competition.  Nevertheless, the Government  will\r\n\r\nkeep a watchful eye over the development of the industry, and\r\n\r\nwill be vigilant against any abuse of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarket   power.   The  Competition  Act  that  MTI   is   now\r\n\r\nconsidering will help us to do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Small Depositors</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran is also concerned about the effect of\r\n\r\nconsolidation on the provision of banking services  to  small\r\n\r\ncustomers.    The  Government  will  ensure  that  low-income\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  continue  to  have  access  to  basic   banking\r\n\r\nservices at affordable prices.  We do not expect this  to  be\r\n\r\nan  immediate problem.  Charges, where they have been levied,\r\n\r\nhave  been modest.  Most of the local banks, especially  DBS,\r\n\r\nalready  provide a basic banking product for small depositors\r\n\r\nat  affordable  prices.   We expect this  to  continue  after\r\n\r\nconsolidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the longer term, banks will feel pressure to\r\n\r\nearn  competitive returns for shareholders.  This will happen\r\n\r\neven  without consolidation.  Because competition will  force\r\n\r\nbanks  to watch their bottom lines more closely, and to  make\r\n\r\neach product break even.  It will become harder for banks  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  cross-subsidise  services  that  they  used  to\r\n\r\nprovide for free or below cost.  That was a luxury affordable\r\n\r\nonly in a protected market where profits came easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many other countries, including Australia and the US,\r\n\r\nfees  and charges for various banking services exist together\r\n\r\nwith   robust  competition.   Governments  and  the   banking\r\n\r\nindustry  have developed guidelines or requirements  for  all\r\n\r\nbanks   to  provide  affordable  services  to  lower   income\r\n\r\ncustomers.   Banks  in Singapore will face  the  same  market\r\n\r\npressures, so we need to consider similar solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stated the Government's position on this in my speech\r\n\r\nto  the  Association of Bank in Singapore on 29th June.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment will ensure that low-income Singaporeans  continue\r\n\r\nto  have  access  to  basic banking  services  at  affordable\r\n\r\nprices.   However,  we  cannot insist that  the  services  be\r\n\r\ncompletely  free.  Banks are businesses and have  to  recover\r\n\r\ntheir costs.  Public transport and electricity are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndaily  necessities for most Singaporeans.   But  neither  bus\r\n\r\nservices nor electricity supplies are free, although both are\r\n\r\naffordable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association of Banks in Singapore has already\r\n\r\nencouraged  all  banks  that engage in  consumer  banking  to\r\n\r\nprovide  affordable basic banking services  to  lower  income\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   MAS  welcomes this, and  is  optimistic  that\r\n\r\nthese banks will find ways to meet this need.  The Government\r\n\r\nwill   monitor  the  situation  closely.   When  it   becomes\r\n\r\nnecessary, MAS will require all banks with significant retail\r\n\r\noperations  in  Singapore to provide basic  banking  accounts\r\n\r\nwith defined minimum features to low-income Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Small and Medium Enterprises</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ker Sin Tze suggested that one or two small banks be\r\n\r\npreserved to serve SMEs.  Unfortunately, this is not  viable.\r\n\r\nThe  Government cannot require the banks to remain small when\r\n\r\ncommercial pressures compel them to acquire scale  to  become\r\n\r\nviable.   This  would  be unfair to the shareholders  of  the\r\n\r\nsmall  banks.  The banks themselves analysed their  situation\r\n\r\nand  decided  that it was no longer commercially  viable  for\r\n\r\nthem   to   remain  small.   And  this  set  in   train   the\r\n\r\nconsolidation process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not likely that small banks can serve SMEs better\r\n\r\nthan  big  banks over the long run.  Smaller banks will  have\r\n\r\nfewer  resources  to cater to the needs of  SMEs,  and  their\r\n\r\ncosts  will  be higher.  A large bank with a well-diversified\r\n\r\nportfolio should be able to fund a larger number of SMEs than\r\n\r\na  small bank with a more concentrated portfolio.  And during\r\n\r\nan economic downturn, a large bank is better able to maintain\r\n\r\nits credit lines to SMEs than small banks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the local banks have maintained an interest in\r\n\r\nserving  SMEs.   They recognise that SMEs  are  an  important\r\n\r\nsegment  of  the market.  DBS' Enterprise Banking  Group  has\r\n\r\nrecently  opened five Business Centres dedicated  to  serving\r\n\r\nSMEs.  Keppel TatLee Bank continues to focus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the  SME  market,  offering a  wide  range  of  financial\r\n\r\nservices  tailored to meet the needs of this  market.   OCBC,\r\n\r\nwhich  has bid for Keppel-TatLee Bank, has established a  new\r\n\r\nEmerging Business unit to cater to the needs of SMEs.   So  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  expect consolidation to affect this interest of  the\r\n\r\nlocal banks in SME lending.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One concern of SMEs arises because some have previously\r\n\r\nborrowed separately from two or more banks.  If the two banks\r\n\r\nnow  merge, will the merged bank cut back their total  credit\r\n\r\nlimit?   I  believe that while the merged bank will  want  to\r\n\r\nreassess its exposure to the borrower, it is unlikely to  cut\r\n\r\nback  its lending simply because of the merger.  If  the  SME\r\n\r\nwas  able  to service separate loans from the merger partners\r\n\r\nearlier,  it should have no difficulty continuing to  service\r\n\r\nthe  same total quantum, as one loan, after the merger.   The\r\n\r\nbank  has no reason to want to lose a good customer,  and  to\r\n\r\nshrink its loan book overnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a supervisory point of view, it is the large loans\r\n\r\nrather than small ones which can expose the bank to excessive\r\n\r\nrisk.   These large borrowers are more likely to be the large\r\n\r\ncompanies and not the SMEs.  The Banking Act imposes a  limit\r\n\r\nof  25%  of  a  bank's capital funds on its exposure  to  any\r\n\r\nsingle  borrower.  This is what we call the  Single  Borrower\r\n\r\nLimit.   However, should a bank merger cause a large borrower\r\n\r\nto exceed this 25% limit, MAS will give the bank a reasonable\r\n\r\ntime to reduce its lending below the statutory or supervisory\r\n\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local banks are not the only sources of funding\r\n\r\navailable to SMEs.  Finance companies and some foreign  banks\r\n\r\nhave  significant SME portfolios, and products that cater  to\r\n\r\nthe  needs  of SMEs.  In addition to commercial  credit,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment also has financing schemes to assist SMEs, such as\r\n\r\nthe  Local  Enterprise Financing Scheme administered  by  the\r\n\r\nProductivity  and Standards Board.  So while  we  can  expect\r\n\r\nsome adjustments as a result of the banking consolidation,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  believe that the SMEs will continue to be catered to  even\r\n\r\nwith a more rationalised and efficient banking sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the banks must change and keep\r\n\r\nup  with  international best practices to remain competitive.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot take for granted that our local banks will  remain\r\n\r\nstrong.   The banks know this and they are in the process  of\r\n\r\nconsolidation.   The result will be fewer but  bigger  banks.\r\n\r\nThe  Government views the consolidation among the local banks\r\n\r\nas  a  positive  development.  If  it  is  well  executed,  a\r\n\r\nstronger group of local banks will emerge, able to hold their\r\n\r\nown  domestically, and to compete in the region.  In the long\r\n\r\nrun,  this  is  the  only  way to provide  Singaporeans  with\r\n\r\nbanking  services  that are competitively priced,  affordable\r\n\r\nand of a high standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the assumption\r\n\r\nseems  to be: \"The bigger, the better\".  Up to a point.   The\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister talks about the Government seeing to it\r\n\r\nthat  the  small account holders will be catered to by  these\r\n\r\nbig  banks.  I have been asking, in line with a lot of  other\r\n\r\ncountries, why is it not possible for a banking ombudsman  to\r\n\r\nbe appointed so that it is not just the Government saying \"We\r\n\r\nwill see to this\", but the small account holders will have an\r\n\r\ninstitution to which they can take their grievances  and  see\r\n\r\nthat  something  is done?

And there is competition in the banking industry\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, which is really the best assurance  of  people\r\n\r\nbeing  treated fairly by banks.  And if any bank  treats  any\r\n\r\ncustomer unfairly, I would say to him to take his account and\r\n\r\ngo  somewhere else, and there are many, many other places  he\r\n\r\ncan go, even after banking consolidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister has\r\n\r\nnot  answered my question on what is the Government's  vision\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore to be an international financial  centre,  and\r\n\r\nwhether or not the merger of banks and such liberalisation of\r\n\r\nthe   financial  market  will  help  us  move  towards   that\r\n\r\ndirection,  and what is the vision that we could  achieve  by\r\n\r\ndoing all these things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is a\r\n\r\nlarge question, but the brief answer is, our vision is to  be\r\n\r\na  financial  centre in which the Singapore  banks  occupy  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  market share and hold their own against  foreign\r\n\r\ncompetition.   We want to open up, we want to  allow  foreign\r\n\r\nbanks  to  come,  we  want  them to  develop  their  regional\r\n\r\nbusiness,  also  access the domestic market  and  prosper  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.

I have not seen the  man,  nor  have  I\r\n\r\nrepresented him in any proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I wish to make the point that the case has\r\n\r\nbeen  brought to my attention by Think Centre, which has also\r\n\r\nsupplied  me  the information about the man's background.   I\r\n\r\nsay this because I have said I did not interview the man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I say that\r\n\r\nthis  is  not  a disputatious speech or a complaining  speech\r\n\r\nthat I intend to make.  It is more of a plea.  May I also  go\r\n\r\non  to say that the plea is not just for this man, but a plea\r\n\r\nfor  all  who may find themselves in the situation  in  which\r\n\r\nthis  man  found himself and has been convicted and sentenced\r\n\r\nto death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I outline several of the facts which had been\r\n\r\npresented to me by the Think Centre and the judgement of  the\r\n\r\nJudicial  Commissioner, may I say, Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat   the  conviction  of  this  man  is  founded   upon   a\r\n\r\npresumption.   A presumption is something that the  law  says\r\n\r\nyou  have  got to presume, you have got to accept unless  the\r\n\r\naccused  is  able  to  rebut that  presumption,  is  able  to\r\n\r\ndisprove  it.  Presumptions therefore reverse the  burden  of\r\n\r\nproof in criminal cases.  In criminal law, as we have had it,\r\n\r\nthe presumption is that an accused person\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis deemed to be innocent until he is proved guilty beyond any\r\n\r\nreasonable  doubt.  The law did not require  the  accused  to\r\n\r\nhave to prove his innocence.  But this is somewhat eroded now\r\n\r\nby  the presumptions that had been built in and the Misuse of\r\n\r\nDrugs Act abounds in presumptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am asking is that before we send a man to his\r\n\r\ndeath,  we must consider whether it is safe enough simply  to\r\n\r\nsend him to his death upon a presumption, where there are  no\r\n\r\nconcrete  evidence  or  any other  facts  which  point  quite\r\n\r\nconclusively  to  the  man's guilt or  participation  in  the\r\n\r\ncrime.   The  background of this man, Zulfikar,  is  that  he\r\n\r\nbecame  a drug addict at the age of 14.  I understand  he  is\r\n\r\nnow  about 31 or 32 years of age.  He has been in and out  of\r\n\r\ndrug  rehabilitation centres from the age of 14.  So he is  a\r\n\r\nconfirmed drug addict.  He has not been able to get any  jobs\r\n\r\nand his life has been something which I think very few people\r\n\r\nwould wish for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Judicial Commissioner, in his judgement, says, \"He\r\n\r\ncannot be so simple.  I cannot imagine that he is so simple.\"\r\n\r\nBut,  unfortunately, I do not see that any evidence was  laid\r\n\r\nbefore the Court or the Court was informed of his background.\r\n\r\nI  do  not think we need expert medical opinion but it  is  a\r\n\r\nknown  fact that someone who is given to drug taking  over  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of time will have his mental faculties affected,  his\r\n\r\npower to think carefully and to rationalise.  He becomes weak-minded and particularly, and I say this again, vulnerable  to\r\n\r\npeople who try to use him or exploit him.  It is unfortunate.\r\n\r\nI  do not know whether the background was brought before  the\r\n\r\nCourt  but  I  cannot see anything in the  judgement  of  the\r\n\r\nJudicial  Commissioner that suggests that his background  was\r\n\r\nplaced before the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts, as I understand from the Judicial\r\n\r\nCommissioner's judgement, are that whilst he was drinking  at\r\n\r\na  pub  in Changi Village, somebody whom he had met, I  think\r\n\r\nprobably   in  prison  or  in  some  rehabilitation   centre,\r\n\r\napproached him and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nasked  him whether he was employed.  He said, \"No, I  am  not\r\n\r\nemployed.   I have not got a job.\"  And he asked, \"Would  you\r\n\r\nlike  a  job?\" and he said, \"Yes.\"  The man later  telephoned\r\n\r\nhim  and  said,  \"Would you go out and pick up something  and\r\n\r\ndeliver  it?\"   It was thus that he became involved  in  this\r\n\r\ntransaction  or activity that landed him in  Court.   He  was\r\n\r\nasked to deliver it to a particular address but, before that,\r\n\r\nhe  had to go and pick it up from somebody.  When he went  to\r\n\r\npick  it up, he was given a bag with five bundles in  it  and\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"This  is  the bag which you have  to  deliver.\"   The\r\n\r\nevidence  would  suggest that it was not  easily  visible  or\r\n\r\napparent  to  anyone, looking at the bag,  to  see  what  the\r\n\r\ncontents of the packages that were inside the bag.  As I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  there  were five small packages.  I am told  that  the\r\n\r\npackages,  when they were unwrapped, the officers had  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough several layers of paper before they could come to the\r\n\r\ndrugs.  So, it was not clearly visible or apparent that there\r\n\r\nwas anything contraband inside those packages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the plastic bag containing these packages. Then,\r\n\r\nhe  was asked to call somebody and to get the directions from\r\n\r\nthat  man as to where he was to deliver it.  I would  be  the\r\n\r\nfirst  to confess that any reasonable, rational minded person\r\n\r\nwould  have thought there was something fishy, there must  be\r\n\r\nsomething  wrong.  But we are not dealing, as  I  have  said,\r\n\r\nwith  a  person who is fully competent in his power to  think\r\n\r\nand to rationalise. It is a pity that no medical evidence was\r\n\r\ncalled as to his faculty in that respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called the number and was asked to take it to a block\r\n\r\nand  that somebody would take it off from him.  When he  went\r\n\r\nthere, there was nobody there and he called that number,  and\r\n\r\nhe  was  then asked, first of all, to leave it in a  dustbin.\r\n\r\nThat must have put him on alert.  But again, he said that  he\r\n\r\ndid  not think about it.  He left it in the dustbin and  then\r\n\r\nlater on, he was asked to bring it up to the ninth floor.  He\r\n\r\ntook it up to the ninth floor. One would have thought that if\r\n\r\nhe had any power of thinking, he might have said,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No,  I better get away from all this.\"  But here was  a  man\r\n\r\nwho  was  trying  to do a job which had been  given  to  him,\r\n\r\nentrusted to him, and he thought that he should carry it out.\r\n\r\nWhen  he  went up to the ninth floor, he was suddenly pounced\r\n\r\nupon  by  CNB  officers.  When the packages  were  eventually\r\n\r\nopened in the CNB office, they were found to contain 72 grams\r\n\r\nof  heroin.   It is in these circumstances that the  man  was\r\n\r\ncharged with trafficking because the law provides that if you\r\n\r\nare in possession of more than 2 grams of heroin, you will be\r\n\r\npresumed to be trafficking and there will be a death sentence\r\n\r\nif the quantity exceeds 15 grams, as it did in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his arrest, he told the CNB officers the story\r\n\r\nabout how he came by it and what he was asked to do with  it.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  Judicial Commissioner commented that  he  had  been\r\n\r\nconsistent  throughout.  He had said everything, he  had  not\r\n\r\ntried  to hide anything.  There was some money found on  him.\r\n\r\nOf  course, the suggestion immediately then was it must  have\r\n\r\nbeen  the  proceeds  or profits from his activities  in  drug\r\n\r\ntrafficking.   But it was later confirmed by Singapore  Pools\r\n\r\nLimited  that the man had really won a prize of  that  amount\r\n\r\nthat was found in his pockets.  At first when he told the CNB\r\n\r\nwhere  he  had collected the money, that happened to  be  the\r\n\r\nwrong  place, and so they could not confirm it, but Singapore\r\n\r\nPools  later  confirmed that that money was his prize  money.\r\n\r\nThere  was  also  evidence led by the CNB  officers  that  he\r\n\r\nattempted  to  run and put up a violent struggle.   This  was\r\n\r\ndenied altogether by the man.  But it is unfortunate that the\r\n\r\nJudicial Commissioner did not make a finding as to whether he\r\n\r\naccepted  the  evidence  of the CNB  officers  that  the  man\r\n\r\nattempted  to run.  Because if the man had attempted  to  run\r\n\r\nand that there was that finding by the Judicial Commissioner,\r\n\r\nthat might point to knowledge on his part.  But that was  not\r\n\r\nthe  case.   There  was  no  such  finding  by  the  Judicial\r\n\r\nCommissioner.   And the Judicial Commissioner  gave  him  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of the doubt as to the money that was found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end, the Judicial Commissioner found that he\r\n\r\nwas in possession of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrugs.   One could attack that, but I am not here  to  attack\r\n\r\nthat.   As I said, he had been found guilty on evidence which\r\n\r\nthe  court thought was enough.  But I am here simply  to  say\r\n\r\nthat in such circumstances, the death sentence should not  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out.  As I said, the Judicial Commissioner  did  not\r\n\r\nappear  to  have been aware of his background  in  coming  to\r\n\r\nthese findings.  I think particular attention must be paid to\r\n\r\nhis  background and to obtaining some medical advice  on  his\r\n\r\ncritical faculties.  The Judicial Commissioner found, in  his\r\n\r\njudgment, that the man said that his only intention was to do\r\n\r\nhis job, to hand the bag as he was instructed, to this caller\r\n\r\nwho had called him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Judicial Commissioner goes on to say ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam's allegations are\r\n\r\nnot  new.   In fact, he is mouthing allegations which  others\r\n\r\nhave made.  Quite understandably, Zulfikar's sister has taken\r\n\r\nup  his brother's cause claiming that he is innocent.  But it\r\n\r\nis  odd that there are others, like Mr Jeyaretnam and, as  he\r\n\r\nhas  also  mentioned, in cyberspace, people who  even  though\r\n\r\nthey  do not know the man  -  and this is by admission of  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam; he has not seen or interviewed the  man   -   and\r\n\r\nyet he is standing here claiming that Mr Zulfikar is a simple\r\n\r\nminded man. Mr Zulfikar is a naive man.  So he also joins the\r\n\r\nbandwagon.  He did not say here in Parliament that the courts\r\n\r\nhave  made  a  mistake, but alluded to the possibility  of  a\r\n\r\nmiscarriage of justice.  That is the import of his statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also says that he is speaking up not only for Mr\r\n\r\nZulfikar but for other people in the same situation as  well.\r\n\r\nBy  saying that, if he implies that our courts have also made\r\n\r\nother  mistakes  and  have  also  wrongly  convicted  accused\r\n\r\npersons,  then  I must debunk that.  Because  all  of  us  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  know  that our courts take their  jobs  seriously.\r\n\r\nOur judges are reputed for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir integrity and competence.

And, indeed, there are checks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> A point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> You neither have a right of reply,\r\n\r\nnor to seek a clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Just a clarification, because ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order, Mr Jeyaretnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The first point that must be\r\n\r\nmade  is that there are safeguards in our system and not just\r\n\r\nin  the  court  system.   In cases where  there  is  a  death\r\n\r\npenalty,   the  Attorney  General  will  give  his   opinion,\r\n\r\nmarshalling the trial judge's judgment, the Court of Appeal's\r\n\r\njudgment,  if any, and also petitions for clemency that  have\r\n\r\nbeen  filed.  And then he will carefully study all these  and\r\n\r\nrender  his  considered  opinion  to  Cabinet  for  Cabinet's\r\n\r\nconsideration  to recommend to the President.   That  is  the\r\n\r\nfirst  point.  And indeed in this case, due process has taken\r\n\r\nits  course  because  Mr Zulfikar was tried  by  the  learned\r\n\r\nJudicial  Commissioner in a trial court.  He was  represented\r\n\r\nby  counsel of his choice who, if it was material, could have\r\n\r\nadduced  evidence as to the state of mind or mental condition\r\n\r\nof Mr Zulfikar, including the fact that he may be naive.  But\r\n\r\nthis was not done.  And then, of course, the Court of Appeal,\r\n\r\nwith  a  panel  of three Judges, considered  all  the  points\r\n\r\ncarefully and decided that the decision should stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is not for us in Parliament to discuss\r\n\r\ncases,  because Parliament is not the Judiciary.  Because  if\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament  are free to  bring  up  cases,  then\r\n\r\npolitical  parties and Members of Parliament who are  unhappy\r\n\r\nwith   court   decisions  will  raise  them  in   Parliament.\r\n\r\nParliament, as a separate organ of state, should not  discuss\r\n\r\ndecisions of our courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam also alludes to the use of\r\n\r\npresumptions.   Yes, indeed, there are some  presumptions  in\r\n\r\nthe  Misuse  of  Drugs  Act.   But  let  me  say  that  every\r\n\r\npresumption  that  has  been introduced  has  been  carefully\r\n\r\nthought  through.  The presumptions have been introduced  for\r\n\r\nspecific purposes.  I think Mr Jeyaretnam will know that even\r\n\r\nin the operation of the presumptions and how they are applied\r\n\r\nin  the  law,  they are applied carefully.  For example,  the\r\n\r\ncourts have said that a man should not be convicted based  on\r\n\r\na  presumption following another presumption.  In this  case,\r\n\r\neven  though there was an operation of a presumption, it  was\r\n\r\nnot  just  the operation of a presumption alone that resulted\r\n\r\nin  Mr  Zulfikar's conviction.  Because, first and  foremost,\r\n\r\nthe  prosecution had to prove that he had possession  of  the\r\n\r\ndrugs,   and possession includes knowledge.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nthe  prosecution had to adduce evidence to show  that,  given\r\n\r\nall  the circumstances of the case, Mr Zulfikar knew that  he\r\n\r\nwas  carrying  drugs.  And indeed this was gone through  very\r\n\r\ncarefully,  both at the trial judge's stage and also  at  the\r\n\r\nCourt  of  Appeal  stage.  The facts were all  examined  very\r\n\r\ncarefully.  I think Mr Jeyaretnam has mentioned some of these\r\n\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court's decision was that, based on these facts, it\r\n\r\nwas wholly unconvincing to believe that Zulfikar did not know\r\n\r\nthat  he was carrying drugs.  Why would he take drugs from  a\r\n\r\nperson  he did not know?  Why would he be carrying the  drugs\r\n\r\nfor  over three hours from Sengkang to Yishun in a taxi?  Why\r\n\r\nwould he wait for telephone calls without inquiring who  that\r\n\r\nperson was or what he would get out of the transaction?   Why\r\n\r\nwould  he not be suspicious, given the fact that he was asked\r\n\r\nto  do  so many things; first, to put the drugs in a dustbin,\r\n\r\nand  then  to  bring  the drugs up to the  ninth  floor?   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the  simple rebuttal to that by  Mr  Jeyaretnam  and\r\n\r\nthose  of his ilk will be that he is a simple-minded man,  he\r\n\r\nis  a  naive man, he is a gullible man.  But imagine  if  you\r\n\r\ntake  that tack for all accused persons who suffer  from  the\r\n\r\npenalty of the law, including the death penalty, then I think\r\n\r\nSingapore will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot,  today,  enjoy  the  standard  of  law  and  order   and\r\n\r\nreputation for safety which we enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other societies which will primarily look at\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances of the accused persons, both  present  and\r\n\r\npast.   In fact, some societies will dig up the past  history\r\n\r\nof an accused person, how he was mistreated by his father, by\r\n\r\nhis  peers and so forth and then say, \"Let's be soft on him\".\r\n\r\nBut  I would remind Mr Jeyaretnam and others of his kind that\r\n\r\nwhat  is really important is to look at the impact of heinous\r\n\r\ncrimes  on both society and on the persons directly affected;\r\n\r\nin other words, the real victims in the case.  In the case of\r\n\r\ndrug  trafficking, we are very clear who these  are  -  lives\r\n\r\nwhich  are  wasted, many of them in their prime. And  through\r\n\r\nthe wasting of addicts' lives, the vicarious wasting of lives\r\n\r\nof families who are affected as well.  Can we go soft on drug\r\n\r\ntraffickers?  I would say no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, do we therefore not comply with the\r\n\r\nlaw?   We  do not do that.  Our laws on drug trafficking  are\r\n\r\nindeed tough  -  draconian.  But they must be so, because  we\r\n\r\nare dealing with a very serious problem,  a problem that many\r\n\r\nother  countries are still grappling with, unable  to  get  a\r\n\r\nhandle  on.  And these drug traffickers and others who peddle\r\n\r\ndrugs do not care very much about the effect of their actions\r\n\r\non those who become addicted to drugs.  Drug is big money and\r\n\r\npeople  who  are desperate for big money will do  such  acts.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed CNB is working hard to be on top of the situation.\r\n\r\nI  think  Mr Jeyaretnam must know of recent press reports  of\r\n\r\nhow drugs have been trafficked into Singapore through various\r\n\r\nmeans,  how  even  in  the  regional  countries,  drugs   are\r\n\r\nclandestinely produced.  I think that is the context in which\r\n\r\nwe  must  view, not just this case, but also other  cases  of\r\n\r\ndrug traffickers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which Mr Jeyaretnam mentions is the\r\n\r\nlottery winnings.  The point to note here is that even though\r\n\r\nit  was discovered, after the Court of Appeal had decided  on\r\n\r\nthe  appeal,  that  indeed  he did  win  some  money  through\r\n\r\nlottery, this was not a material consideration in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecision  of the trial judge.  In fact, the trial judge  said\r\n\r\nthat  he was prepared to give the defence counsel the benefit\r\n\r\nof  the doubt that these were lottery winnings.  But that was\r\n\r\nnot  a  material consideration because the way  the  law  was\r\n\r\napplied  was,  as  I mentioned just now, the prosecution  had\r\n\r\nproven possession of drugs with knowledge beyond a reasonable\r\n\r\ndoubt, because all the defence counsel had to do was to  cast\r\n\r\na reasonable doubt that he had knowledge.  But given the fact\r\n\r\nof  the circumstances in which he was carrying the drugs, the\r\n\r\nfact  that he had the drugs for three hours, which means that\r\n\r\nhe had ample opportunity to examine what he was carrying, and\r\n\r\ngiven  the fact that he himself was a drug addict  -  he  was\r\n\r\nin  fact  arrested way back, his first criminal  offence,  in\r\n\r\n1985  for theft, after which he had a string of criminal  and\r\n\r\ndrug antecedents, and then he was in the DRC on four separate\r\n\r\noccasions   -  given that background, does Mr Jeyaretnam  and\r\n\r\nother  people  not think that he would, in  fact,  know  that\r\n\r\nsomething was amiss?  In fact, he said that he felt something\r\n\r\namiss.  He knew that he was carrying drugs.  And even  if  he\r\n\r\ndid  not  know, as the Court of Appeal said, he was  wilfully\r\n\r\nblind  to  that fact.  This cannot be a defence  because  you\r\n\r\ncannot prove knowledge on the part of the accused.  But  what\r\n\r\nthe court can do is to look at all the circumstances of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncase  and  then  conclude that it is beyond reasonable  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  he had that knowledge.  When the prosecution had proven\r\n\r\nthat,  only then did the presumption kick in.  And  then  the\r\n\r\npresumption says that if you are carrying more than  2  grams\r\n\r\nof  diamorphine, you are presumed to be trafficking in drugs,\r\n\r\nunless you can show, on a balance of probabilities, that  you\r\n\r\nwere  not trafficking in drugs.  In other words, you have  to\r\n\r\nshow  that  you  probably  wanted  the  drugs  for  your  own\r\n\r\nconsumption.   Then you will not be charged for  trafficking.\r\n\r\nThat  is  how  the law operated.  That is how the presumption\r\n\r\noperated in that context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the other point is that ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

Prior to 1987,  HDB  let\r\n\r\nout  these premises on monthly tenancies with rents fixed  at\r\n\r\nthe  point  of  letting.   Many of  the  older  tenants  were\r\n\r\nresettlement cases who enjoyed concessionary rents.   On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  there  were  some tenants  who  obtained  their\r\n\r\npremises via tender and were paying market rents, which  were\r\n\r\nmuch higher.  As there was only one rental adjustment between\r\n\r\n1960  and  1987, there was great disparity in the  rents  for\r\n\r\nsimilar HDB premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair to all tenants doing business in HDB\r\n\r\npremises,  and  to make HDB rents more responsive  to  market\r\n\r\nconditions,  HDB  decided to gradually move  all  rentals  to\r\n\r\nmarket.   In  1988,  HDB converted all monthly  tenancies  to\r\n\r\nfixed-term tenancies and adjusted its rents at every  tenancy\r\n\r\nrenewal.   For  tenants who paid above the prevailing  market\r\n\r\nrate,  HDB  would reduce their rents during tenancy  renewal.\r\n\r\nThose  who  paid  below  the market would  have  their  rents\r\n\r\nadjusted upwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For tenants who were on subsidized rents, HDB has\r\n\r\nstaggered the rental increase towards prevailing market  rate\r\n\r\nover 4 renewals, at 3-yearly intervals, ie, over 12 years, to\r\n\r\nmoderate the impact on the tenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at June 2001, HDB had 8,400 commercial and 10,200\r\n\r\nindustrial  tenants.   Of these, 7,900 commercial  and  6,000\r\n\r\nindustrial  tenants were paying below market  rate.   On  the\r\n\r\nother hand, 300 commercial and 4,200 industrial tenants  were\r\n\r\npaying above market rents, because the market rate has fallen\r\n\r\nover time.   At the point of tenancy renewal, HDB will adjust\r\n\r\nthe rents of both groups of tenants towards market rate.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  among  the  227  shop  tenants  who  renewed  their\r\n\r\ntenancies  in  the  last three months, 70%  had  their  rents\r\n\r\nmaintained  or  reduced.  30% had their rental increased,  of\r\n\r\nwhich  half had their rents adjusted upwards between 10%  and\r\n\r\n35%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government recognizes that some HDB tenants are\r\n\r\nfacing  difficulties in view of the poor economic conditions.\r\n\r\nThus,  HDB  has  given rental rebates to its  commercial  and\r\n\r\nindustrial  tenants since December 1997 to  help  them  lower\r\n\r\ntheir  business cost.  The current rebates consist  of  three\r\n\r\ncategories:  (a) an across-the board rebate;  (b)  a  further\r\n\r\nrebate to reduce rental for tenants paying above market rate;\r\n\r\nand  (c) a rebate arising from property tax reduction,  which\r\n\r\nis  passed  on  by  HDB.  Taken together,  HDB  tenants  will\r\n\r\nreceive a rental rebate of 12% - 13% for Year 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned in Parliament on 19th April 2001, HDB is\r\n\r\nexamining  whether and how it can provide further  assistance\r\n\r\nto  HDB commercial and industrial tenants. HDB is expected to\r\n\r\ncomplete its review before the end of this month.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin also asked \"how does HDB compute market\r\n\r\nrentals?\"  I would like to inform him that HDB engages a team\r\n\r\nof  qualified  professional valuers to determine  the  market\r\n\r\nrent   for  its  commercial  and  industrial  premises.    In\r\n\r\nassessing  the  market  rent, the  valuers  would  take  into\r\n\r\naccount  recent  lettings  of  comparable  premises  in   the\r\n\r\nvicinity, and make adjustments for the location, size and age\r\n\r\nof  the  premises. HDB also allows tenants who do  not  agree\r\n\r\nwith  the assessed market rent to appeal for a rental  review\r\n\r\nor to seek a separate assessment from the Chief Valuer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RENTING OF HDB FLATS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze</b> asked the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  whether  the Housing and  Development  Board  is\r\n\r\nprepared to waive or shorten the waiting period of 30  months\r\n\r\nfor  flat  owners, who have sold their flats due to financial\r\n\r\nhardships, to rent a flat in mature estates or in areas  such\r\n\r\nas  Sembawang  and  Woodlands Estates where  many  flats  are\r\n\r\nunoccupied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing policy, an ex-lessee who has sold his\r\n\r\nHome  Ownership  flat in the open market is not  eligible  to\r\n\r\nrent  a flat from HDB for a period of 30 months from the date\r\n\r\nof  sale.

We  adopt  a\r\n\r\nmulti-pronged  approach  in  safeguarding  the   safety   and\r\n\r\nsecurity  of the elderly, from crime prevention education  to\r\n\r\nproactive enforcement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the national level, the Police work closely with the\r\n\r\nmedia  to  raise awareness on crime prevention.  For example,\r\n\r\nthrough its popular \"Crime Watch\", the Police highlight cases\r\n\r\nof  crimes against the elderly, explain the modus operandi of\r\n\r\nthe  offenders,  and  advise preventive  measures  which  the\r\n\r\npublic should take to minimize the chances of them becoming a\r\n\r\nvictim of crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the community level, each Police Division partners\r\n\r\nthe  community  through  the Community  Safety  and  Security\r\n\r\nProgramme  (CSSP) to enhance the safety and security  of  the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood.    There  have  been  many   successful   CSSP\r\n\r\nprogrammes  for  the  elderly.   For  example,  the   Central\r\n\r\nSingapore  CDC,  which  has a high  concentration  of  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens,  especially  in the Kreta  Ayer,  Jalan  Besar  and\r\n\r\nKampong  Glam areas, started the \"Care and Support  Programme\r\n\r\nfor  the  Elderly\" to raise crime prevention awareness  among\r\n\r\nits  elderly residents.  Through a series of crime prevention\r\n\r\ntalks - some of them conducted in dialects - the Police share\r\n\r\nwith   the  elderly  how  to  protect  themselves  and  their\r\n\r\nvaluables.   The elderly also form mutual support  groups  so\r\n\r\nthat the more able members will support and take care of  the\r\n\r\nless  able.  If unfortunately an elderly falls prey to crime,\r\n\r\nwith  his/her consent, the Police would liaise with  the  CDC\r\n\r\nfor follow up on taking care of the victim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the individual level, the Police will in their house\r\n\r\nvisits  advise  family  members to play  an  active  role  in\r\n\r\ninculcating \"safe\" habits to not only the elders but also all\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  family.  Some of these preventive  measures\r\n\r\ninclude for example, avoiding wearing expensive jewellery  or\r\n\r\ncarrying  large  amounts of money, arranging for  someone  to\r\n\r\nwalk  the elderly home when returning home late, and avoiding\r\n\r\ndark and deserted shortcuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides crime prevention education and working with the\r\n\r\ncommunity, the Police regularly patrol the neighbourhood  and\r\n\r\nlook  out  in particular for the safety and security  of  the\r\n\r\nelderly.  The Police also spare no efforts to solve the crime\r\n\r\nand arrest the offenders, thereby sending a deterrent message\r\n\r\nto other would-be offenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, by working hand-in-hand with the community, we\r\n\r\nhave  managed to keep the crime rate against elderly  persons\r\n\r\nlow.   The  number of robberies committed on elderly  persons\r\n\r\ndecreased from 89 cases in 1998 to 84 cases in 1999,  and  67\r\n\r\ncases in year 2000.
