But I ask leave from you to raise this publicly now, and that is, to make a plea that Members should be given longer notices of the sittings of Parliament. It was made very poignant as regards this sitting because we had notice of the sitting on the 23rd April. Under Standing Orders, all questions and motions for debate in Parliament had to be sent in on the 24th April. So Members had barely 24 hours within which to prepare their questions and to table their motions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have told you, I missed out because I sent in my questions and motions on the 25th April, having clean forgotten that 1st May was a public holiday.

It is not a game of trying to catch out Members from giving notices of motions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of order. I think the Member really is stretching his point too much. There is no point of order. I have made the subject clear. It is provided for in the Standing Orders that a certain number of days of notice is required.

Jayakumar (Second Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Second Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing copyright law in Singapore is contained in the Copyright Act 1911 of the United Kingdom, as modified in its application to Singapore by the Copyright Act of 1914 and the Copyright (Gramophone Records and Government Broadcasting) Act of 1968. Over the years, developments in the field of computer science, sound and video recording, cable television, satellite broadcasting and photocopying require us to amend our copyright laws to keep abreast of these developments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The improved copyright provisions will provide a better environment for the publishing industry in Singapore. They \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> will give an incentive to both local and foreign printing and publishing companies to expand their activities here. By extending copyright protection to new forms of intellectual property, particularly computer software, they will provide the legal framework necessary for the development of a strong software industry here. Major international computer companies and software houses planning to set up software development centres in Singapore can be assured that the products will be adequately protected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond our own requirements, I should also mention that in recent years one significant source of friction with our trading partners, particularly the United States, has been the inadequacy of our existing copyright laws. The Government has for some time recognized their concerns, and stated its intention to introduce new legislation to remedy the problem. I hope that the introduction of this Bill will remove one contentious issue and so improve our relations with these partners. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is the result of the deliberations of an Inter-departmental Committee set up by the Ministry of Law some five years ago to review the existing copyright law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is modelled largely on Australia's copyright law which was found most suitable bearing in mind our legal system, our need to be up-to-date and comprehensive. However, the legal draftsmen had also adapted the provisions to the particular circumstances in our country and, where necessary, had followed provisions on some aspects found in the laws of other countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Bill, a work first published in Singapore regardless of the nationality of the authors, would be eligible for copyright protection. Works published elsewhere and simultaneously published in Singapore within a 30-day period will be regarded as first published in Singapore. In the case of unpublished works only the works of Singapore citizens and residents would enjoy copyright protection. As is the case with legislation of most other countries, there are provisions in the Bill for Singapore to confer copyright protection on foreign works, whether published elsewhere or unpublished, through bilateral \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> arrangements or through accession by Singapore to international copyright conventions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, computer software is specifically protected as a form of literary work. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill gives a number of exclusive rights to the copyright owners. For literary, dramatic, or artistic works, for instance, the owner has the exclusive right, among other things, to reproduce, publish, perform in public, broadcast and include the work in cable programmes. In the case of sound recordings, cinematographic films, television and sound broadcasts, cable programmes and published editions, the owner has the exclusive right to reproduce or copy the work. The owner of copyright in a cinematographic film has, in addition, the right to cause the film to be seen or heard in public, to broadcast it and include it in a cable programme service. The owner of a television or sound broadcast has also the right to broadcast it. It would be an infringement of copyright to do any of these acts without the permission or licence of the copyright owner. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, however, provides a number of exceptions to the general rule on infringement of copyright. For instance, there are provisions on fair dealing with a copyright work for research or study, for criticism or review or for the reporting of news and these do not constitute infringement. There are also other exceptions for the reproduction of works for judicial proceedings or professional advice or by libraries and for the broadcast of works in certain types of public places. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term of protection provided under existing laws is retained. Copyright subsists in a work from the time it is made and continues to subsist until the expiration of 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which the author died. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are provisions in the Bill providing that under certain conditions any person can produce records of musical works upon the payment of royalties to the copyright owner. Provisions are also made for the issuance of licences by the copyright Tribunal for the translation and reproduction of certain works. These provisions are \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> modelled on what are known as the Tunis Model Law prepared by the World Intellectual Property Organization and are compatible with the exceptions permitted in international copyright conventions for developing countries to produce cheap editions for their people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copyright Tribunal is established under the Bill with wide jurisdiction to determine the remuneration payable under statutory licences and to settle licence disputes in relation to performing and broadcasting rights. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both civil and criminal remedies for infringement of copyright are provided for in the Bill. The relief that a Court may grant in a civil suit includes an injunction and either damages or an account of profits. The criminal remedies include the issuance of warrants by Magistrates for search and seizure of equipment used or intended to be used in making infringing copies of works. The importation of infringement copies could be prohibited under the law. Stiffer penalties than in the existing law are also prescribed for offences under the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Bill will enable Singapore to accede to the Universal Copyright Convention should this be found to be desirable. By joining the Convention, Singapore would be obliged to extend copyright protection to works and other subject-matter published in member countries of the Convention or unpublished works and other subject-matter of those countries. But it also means that Singaporeans' works and works published in Singapore are protected in those countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are transitional provisions that apply to works and other subject-matter made before the commencement of the new legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in drafting this Bill, the Government has had due regard to the interests of the various parties concerned, be they copyright owners, industry or consumers. Many parties will undoubtedly have an interest in the Bill. Therefore, it is proposed that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee to allow further and thorough airing of these views and a more detailed \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> examination to be made of the provisions of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>11.23 am \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, infringement, alleged or real, of intellectual properties, such as musical works, films in the form of video cassettes and computer software for microcomputers, has given Singapore a less than favourable impression. Recent articles in newspapers and magazines highlighted this. The Far Eastern Economic Review, for example, in its 24th April issue reported that Motion Picture Association of America reckons that its members lose at least US$11 million annually because of illegally recorded video tapes in Singapore. The article also mentioned that Singapore is the largest exporter of pirated music cassettes in the world. Another article, using the same figures, expressing essentially the same sentiments, also appeared in the 12th April issue of The Economist. The wordings are so similar that the two articles could very well have been written by the same reporter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits Times, on 8th April 1986, carried a report quoting a British Parliamentary Under-Secretary that the United Kingdom lost o70 million or S$222 million because of pirated goods like books and musical recordings from Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has said whether these figures could be substantiated. Perhaps it has become fashionable to estimate revenue loss and attribute it to Singapore. It does not matter to the authors of these articles that there are other countries with very high activities in pirated goods as well and sometimes with quality superior to those of Singapore. To them, Singapore is it. Of course, the problem is that some of the people reading these articles are going to believe them and, like it or not, the perception of extensive copyright piracy activities in Singapore is perpetrated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This perception is also extended to computer software. I would like to state here, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and let it be very clear from the beginning, that the subject about computer software is not about large mainframe software, such as operating systems, database languages and data communications software. This software is too complex and requires so much support from vendors that just making a copy is of not much use to anyone. The users of this software are major corporations and government bodies anyway. So there is no problem here. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject is actually micro-computer software for home use or personal use. In this case, I believe that the extent of software duplication in Singapore is no worse than elsewhere. Definitely, the situation in the US could be just as bad. If we take a look at all the copybreaking software and see where they originate, they have actually all been written in the US for the US market. In terms of dollar revenue loss through piracy, I believe the amount in the US or elsewhere would have been astronomical as well. Yet no one really gripes about it. Such is the nature of the personal computer market. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event the perception exists. It is not uncommon for micro-computer software vendors to avoid bringing their products to Singapore, or at least they say so, under the impression that their product, once it is introduced to Singapore, there will be no market for it thereafter. More importantly, without proper protection computer software companies might avoid investing in Singapore and such companies have been identified as one of the high-tech industries of the future. Without proper protection, the development of a home-grown computer software industry will definitely be retarded. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the US Congress has passed a Trade Act in 1984 tying the benefits of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) to copyright protection. That the widespread impression of Singapore being a country where violations are rampant, regardless of whether it is a myth or fact, will cause difficulties in trade negotiations. Thus, I support the Government and it is timely for the Government to introduce this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to regularize the duplication of printed matters, songs, video and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> cable programmes as well as computer software. The Bill clearly spells out that computer software is an intellectual property which would help in the prosecution of violators. Both fines and imprisonment terms have been increased in this Bill as compared to the 1911 Copyright Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 26 of this Bill states that copyright protection can be acquired if it is the work of a Singapore citizen or resident. Alternatively, if the work is published or sufficient copies are available in Singapore for distribution (for sale or otherwise) within 30 days of its original announcement or release elsewhere as stated in clause 23, subclause (5). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last provision would have made it a bit difficult for some foreign companies to acquire copyright in Singapore. For example, movie makers, since a movie is typically shown much later than 30 days after its world premiere elsewhere. In the case of micro-computer software, most of the companies involved in this trade are in the US. They are small and without overseas offices. As such, the 30-day restriction might be a bit too stringent. Only a handful of such companies would have benefited from this Bill while the small software developers would not be protected. The net result is that the bigger companies would release their products soon after its announcement elsewhere which is a good thing. But for the majority of micro-computer software companies, the situation would be no different from now. I urge the Minister to look into this carefully. A bilateral agreement or ratification of the 1952 Universal Copyright Convention (UCC) would have resolved this difficulty and should be considered when the circumstances are right. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noted that the Bill has been drafted in such a way that as and when bilateral agreements or when the Government decides to ratify the UCC, no modification of the Bill is necessary. Clause 199 seems to preclude copyrights of all existing products when this Bill takes effect. In other words, copyright protection might not be provided retroactively. Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us whether this is true that no protection or no prosecution of violation of old works could be pursued by the aggrieved private parties. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has also been concern that the Copyright Bill will hamper the pursuit of knowledge, particularly in the educational institutions. I am happy to note that Part III of the Bill deals with this quite adequately with Copying of Works in Libraries covered in Division 5 and the Copying of Works in Educational Institutions covered in Division 6, as I read it. In the case of computer software, clauses 52 and 53 seem to preclude educational institutions from the provision of this Bill. Perhaps the Minister can comment on this. This is important as the instruction of micro-computer software would necessarily mean that in a class of, say, 25 students, each with his own computer, 25 copies of the same software would have been required. Without this preclusion under the provision, the cost of the software required for those courses would have made such courses prohibitive. What is a bit vague here is the use of the software in the educational institutions for their own non-teaching use, such as administrative and consultancy purposes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the rapid advancement of computer technology might have overtaken the considerations of the Bill. The Bill is silent on the use of computer software in a computer network environment, such as a local area network supporting micro-computers. In this situation, a copy of the computer program is stored in the network service computer known as the network server. As and when the user uses the program, an electronic copy of the program is transmitted over the network into the user's workstation. Since educational institutes may make copies of the software anyway, can they put such software onto the network server without paying for a site licence or a network licence? For private users, is such transient copying a violation of the copyright provisions of the Bill? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Singapore's growth as a developed country and a cultured society, the protection of the intellectual properties is necessary. For example, the popularity of Xinyao indicates that there is a group of budding talents in Singapore. On top of the cultural development, the emerging of a homegrown micro computer industry with companies like Creative Technology, necessitates the implementation of the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Bill. These provisions will give them the protection and, in turn, the fiscal incentives they need in their formative years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill touches almost everyone in their daily life. I therefore support the Minister's move to commit this Bill to a Parliamentary Select Committee for detailed consideration. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I of course rise to support the Bill in principle and to assure the Government of my Party's support in its efforts to protect the intellectual property of people who contribute to the progress of society, either in literary, musical or artistic works. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister himself and the last Member have voiced the concern felt in countries outside Singapore about the pirating in Singapore of intellectual properties emanating from these countries. But it is not just concern felt by these other countries; there is also concern felt by our local companies and by local authors. And we should primarily protect our local people from deprivation of their economic gain from their intellectual properties. I remember the concern that was felt by our local authors some years ago at the delay in the Government's declared intention to bring in a new Bill, and I asked a question about this sometime then. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we do, of course, support this Bill. This Bill is necessary, as the Minister said, if we are to have good relations with our trading partners. But may I raise a concern for a particular class. This is the matter of textbooks for students. It has been mentioned by the last Member that copyright may perhaps unnecessarily hinder or hamper the acquisition of knowledge. Of course, these are the two competing interests - the availability of knowledge in any form and the need to protect the property rights of the authors of that knowledge. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this affluent society of ours we expect our children to buy all their textbooks, and I know that in many families the cost of these books is a burden to them. I note and I am aware that the Act has provision for fair use, making fair use \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> not an infringement of copyright, and there is also provision for library copies. But I wonder whether this would be adequate enough to cover the concern that I have for students' textbooks. I am told that not only are the students' books expensive, books that have come from other countries, but they are also not readily available in many cases. So I wonder whether the Ministry of Education or the Government would consider making special arrangements for the availability of these books to students at a price that they can afford and to be available when they want them. That is my concern under this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other sections of the Bill which I would like to refer, if I may, and that is, the provisions which relate to Government's liability and the Government's privileges under this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see, by clause 3 of this Bill, that \"this Act shall bind the Government but nothing in this Act should render the Government liable to be prosecuted for an offence.\" Well, I do not know how Government is going to be bound if it is not liable to be prosecuted for any infringement of copyright. Not very long ago, Mr Speaker, Sir, the public in Singapore and, of course, overseas learned of a Minister of State telling his audience that they should not worry about the Government restricting sale of foreign newspapers in Singapore because one could always make copies of them and circulate them. Sir, if that is not an infringement of copyright, I do not know what is. I wonder what the United States State Department thought of that. So may I know the reason for the provision for the Government not being liable to be prosecuted for any infringement of copyright by the Government? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then if you move on to clause 6, Mr Speaker, Sir, I see that the Government shall be at perfect liberty \"to sell, use or otherwise deal with articles forfeited under any written law, including any article so forfeited by virtue of this Act or of any written law repealed by this Act.\" That gives the Government carte blanche, as it were, to seize any articles which infringe the copyright of the authors and then to sell or to deal with them in any way the Government thinks fit. It seems to me a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> complete contradiction of the Government's intention to stamp out infringements of copyright. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then under clause 7, Mr Speaker, Sir, I see that private educational institutions are excluded. This is because the definition of an \"educational institution\" under this Bill in which reproduction is permitted without being an infringement \"does not include an institution that is conducted for the profit, direct or indirect, of an individual or individuals.\" This would appear to exclude a number of private organizations in Singapore that do provide education in one form or other. I do not know why the need to exclude them if they are already registered with the Ministry of Education and they are genuine educational institutions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may turn to clause 187 in the Bill. This provides for copyright in the Government of any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work made by or under the direction or control of a Government department. I see that in the United States, the US Government does not have any copyright. I can understand copyright vesting in the Government where anything is made by any person in the employment of the Government. But we have a situation here where from time to time the Ministry of Information invites people to participate in contests, competitions, essay writing, dramatic competitions. Under this clause the copyright in entries submitted for these competitions would automatically vest with the Government and not with the author of the work. Why should that be? Then the Government is free to make use of that person's work without paying any royalty to that person. As I said, I can understand this if the work is produced by somebody who is under a contract of employment with the Government. But in my view, Mr Speaker, Sir, the copyright in works submitted to the Government by persons who are invited to take part in competitions or festivals organized by the Government should continue to subsist with the author and there should be penalties for infringement of the copyright, either by the Government or by anybody else for that matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das (Chong Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Copyright Bill and welcome the decision of the Minister to commit it to a Parliamentary Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our present copyright legislation in Singapore is based on the Imperial Copyright Act of 1911 of the United Kingdom. Hence, I believe that there is an urgent need to review this, especially in the light of technological and social changes, both in Singapore and overseas. There are several factors which make it necessary for Singapore to review the present set of laws on copyright. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, as has been mentioned earlier, there is considerable pressure from the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom on Singapore to introduce tougher legislation to protect intellectual properties in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, Singapore is now subject to abuse and allegations that it is the centre or, in fact, the world capital for piracy. UK and US firms report losses of millions of dollars because of pirated products like cassette tapes and computer software exported out of Singapore. The Member for Bukit Timah has already read out the various articles. I have copies of a number of articles here from the Financial Times, Straits Times, The Australian and the Canberra Times, all stating that Singapore is the number one piracy centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third reason is that the US Government even went as far as to caution the danger of Singapore losing out its GSP status if piracy is not checked or strong legislation introduced by the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst the above, I believe that the introduction of a comprehensive copyright bill is indeed very timely. This move would also further go on to protect and promote our overall trade. Sir, it is the declared policy of the Government to promote Singapore as the brain services centre. I believe this piece of legislation will go a long way in correcting our reputation as a centre of piracy. Unchecked piracy, especially in computer software, would destroy Singapore's dream of becoming a leading computer centre by the turn of the century. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from computer software industry, Sir, the printing and publishing industries have also been identified as a growth sector of the economy and it is expected to sustain a growth of about 11% per annum. Again, the introduction of this new Bill would not only benefit local publishers and printers in securing new titles but would also enhance Singapore's position as an international printing and publishing centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one question often asked is whether the introduction of new laws on copyright will result in higher priced products. It would be reasonable to assume that originals will be more expensive than pirated copies. Therefore, it is important that prices of original products should come down and this in a way would discourage piracy further. One way to reduce prices of original products in Singapore would be to encourage Singapore companies to arrange for licensing arrangements with the rights holders to reproduce their products in Singapore for sale in the domestic market as well as for exports to agreed markets at competitive prices. The existing arrangements with major book publishers and printers in the US and the United Kingdom to reprint and publish books in Singapore for domestic sale and export is a good example for other sectors of the economy to follow. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since this Bill is going to Select Committee, I do not intend to touch on specific provisions except to say that book distributors in Singapore have voiced some reservations as regards clauses 31 and 32 of the new Bill. They claim that this provision is very restrictive and it is not in our interest. Currently, Singapore book distributors enjoy the privilege of securing titles from the UK and the US markets freely, thus keeping prices reasonable and our selection of books wide. Apparently, with the provision in clauses 31 and 32, this practice cannot be continued because of agreements between the UK and US publishers. We can only import from the UK even if the US editions are much cheaper. I believe this is a price we pay for following the Australian model. In fact, some people go on to say that we \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> pirated the Australian model! I hope, Sir, the book distributors will make very strong representations to the Select Committee and that the Minister will give his due consideration. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the introduction of this Bill, I believe there will be difficulties in the short run for some people. Adjustments will have to be made and I would appeal to the Minister to look into these short-run problems so as to minimize the difficulties that would be encountered by some sectors in the economy. However, in the long run, this Bill can only do Singapore good. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Fengshan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill. As the Minister has stated, such amendments to the law are necessary if we want to develop Singapore's computer software and publishing industries. In view of the fact that this Bill will be referred to Select Committee, I will not speak on the specific provisions. I only wish to make one general point. It is that while I appreciate the need to stamp out large-scale pirating of books, cassettes and computer software, we should not altogether overlook the interests of the bona fide individual who may have legitimate need for making a copy of a book or video tape for his own private or personal use as opposed to commercial purposes. By all means, go after the large-scale pirates. They constitute the real threat and a real problem as I understand it. The making of copies for personal private use ought to be treated differently. There must be a difference between a person making one copy and a person making 10,000 copies for sale. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that in clause 108 of the Bill, exception is already made for recording of TV broadcasts for private and domestic use. Can the same principle not be extended to areas mentioned? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem of students has already been mentioned. Here, I note that even today there are editions of books called the Asian Editions which are printed for students, especially those in tertiary institutiions which are sold at about half the price. Perhaps while we tighten our laws, we should also encourage companies to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> continue such pratices so that these books will still be available to our students. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister and the Select Committee will consider these points. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Radin Mas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in general support of this Bill with some reservations. Generally, the Copyright Bill will have repercussions on two main classes of products: (1) leisure and non-essential products, such as audio cassettes and video tapes; (2) educational products such as books and computer software. I think a tighter control of the first category of products on video tapes and audio tapes' pirating is welcome and this will have little impact on the general well-being of our population. Hopefully, the image of our business community will be improved when the copyright law is in force. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, tough copyright action on educational material is a serious area of concern. The public is apprehensive as there are many school children who are today in possession of unauthorised copies of textbooks or reference books. They are uncertain whether they will be prosecuted if they are found in possession of such material. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area of concern is the clauses covering computer software. There is no doubt that cheap and easy availability of computer software has helped the intellectual and educational development of our children in the last five years. Although there are pressures from countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom for us to tighten up copyright in this area, I believe that the situation in these two countries is no different. The distribution of copied computer programmes in these two countries, as I understand it from reading news magazines, is that it is quite a widespread problem. I think the very fact that several software programmes are marketed with elaborate and sophisticated copy protection schemes must lend weight to this fact that it is a serious problem there. In the US, so far only a very small handful of corporations have faced lawsuits and this is only in cases where a company has one legitimate or original copy and they have several other copies in use in the offices. The leakage I think is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> very substantial in these markets, in the US as well as in the UK. This will remain so as long as computer software is very costly. It is unfortunate that these countries which profess so much concern for our well-being as a friend is at the same time putting so much pressure on us and arm-twisting us with GSP benefits and so on. The situation in the home market is not much better and the leakage in this part of the world is rather small. I think Singapore has been unduly singled out. As pointed out by the Member for Bukit Timah, many countries in this part of the world are perpetrators of much serious pirating. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue loss, as mentioned by the Member for Chong Boon and also the Member for Bukit Timah on computer software pirating, is based on the fact that revenue lost would not have occurred if original software had been sold. But with computer software priced between $1,000 and $1,500, I think it is very doubtful that this is the case. If there is tight control, there will be little or no sale of original software. We must certainly stamp out the selling of pirated computer software. At the same time, we must also discourage companies and organizations from using non-original computer software. However, we should not discourage our people, especially school children, from owning and exchanging computer software for their personal use at home. I think this is an area which will give us much hope and progress and we must continue to allow this development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Select Committee will give this point favourable consideration. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be allowed to join the debate. I also welcome this legislation to protect intellectual property in Singapore. It would appear that the Government has only come around after pressure from America. The last time we heard of pirates in Singapore was in the time of Sir Stamford Raffles. And now, according to what Members have said, it would appear that people all over the world say that there are still pirates in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that this Bill is going to be sent to Select Committee and I think it is a good thing because there are a lot of repercus- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> sions. If you go to any shopping centre in the suburbs, you will see shops busy with their photostat machines, and also cassette tapes, video tapes, lined up. I think the Government at this stage should look carefully whether they should implement this quickly. If they are going to do that, I think then many of these people would suffer. Wide publicity should be given to this Bill and to tell them to wind up their business quickly. The law is very comprehensive and it covers all kinds of intellectual property. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passing of this law, of course, we will be thrown into the big league of nations. I am sure that when this law comes into force there will be bilateral legislation with countries like America, England and other Western countries. In other words, we are competing with them in respect of this kind of business. To me this is a one-sided competition. In countries like America and England, they have complete intellectual freedom. University lecturers, writers, script writers for motion pictures, journalists, can write freely, anything they want, except of course within the constraints of defamatory law and matters concerning internal and national security. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But can we do that in Singapore? We have read not long ago of a group of young University lecturers who have taken the trouble to publish in magazines about certain things which, of course, are not pleasant but true. They have been called up by the Ministry of Culture and told, \"Please don't publish any more seamy things about Singapore.\" If you want to be creative and innovative, intellectual freedom must be allowed in all areas. You cannot just say, \"All right. Confine it to writing of software;\" it being very productive there, and in other areas you say, \"Please don't write too much, especially about politics.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, I had the opportunity, together with the Member for Anson, to have breakfast with a Mrs Graham. As you may know, she is the owner of the Washington Post, owner of Newsweek and many broadcasting companies in America. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> She said that she had lunch with a group of our young reporters and she found our young reporters to be intelligent, lively and very good, even better than some of the reporters in America. But are our journalists producing books or publications about Singapore? They have been in the business for so long and yet we hardly see any books about Singapore. I think we cannot confine intellectual work just to one area and not allow it in another area. Our people must be given the intellectual freedom to report things objectively. Look at our newspaper reports. Unfortunately the number of our newspapers has been reduced. But look at their reports. Are they really objective? Are they truly exercising their journalistic skills freely? I do not think so. Once we have this copyright law, I think it is also important for us really not to lose out to the other countries. We must have this intellectual freedom. Not long ago, in China they had this policy of \"let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend.\" I have said that previously and I would like to repeat. I think we should have that policy in Singapore also. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not easy to have a publication in Singapore. All the editors and all the people in charge would have to declare how much they earn, what is their disposable income. It is very intimidating. Who would like to start a publication when they have to give all the details of how much they own and how much they earn. Of course, every publication in Singapore will have to be screened, formerly by the Ministry of Culture and now I suppose it is the Ministry of Community Development, or whatever Ministry that has taken over now. I hear that even a school magazine has to be screened. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Not true. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chandra Das (Chong Boon):</b> Your Demokrat is being published. Don't tell lies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am talking about the intimidating effect of all these measures. So if we want to have this law, which is good, we must give Singapore the conditions whereby people can really be creative and really be not afraid to use their intellectual capacities to the fullest. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Look at the newspaper reports of what the Opposition has said. They are always given two or three inches per column. Against that, take the example of the last May Day Rally. It was highlighted in the front page. The crowd of 20,000 was said to be 40,000. And there was a photograph in the front page showing all the umbrellas opened out. But I noted the umbrellas. If you go back and look at the paper again, the umbrellas were all the same. So they have been provided for, and it should have been fairly reported that every one of them was given an umbrella. I would have gone if I knew I was going to be given an umbrella! It is a form of bribery. Whereas the report on our rally was short and it said it was sparsely attended. But it failed to say that it was pouring with rain on that day. But we did not provide free umbrellas. That is probably the reason. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the politics of envy. The point I am trying to make is that our journalists in Singapore are not given the free intellectual rein to write objectively. If this is true of our journalists, this must be true of other people who wish to write freely. Without this kind of a condition, if we have this law, I think we will be on the losing end and Singapore will definitely fall out. We have to pay more for the original works. We have to spend more money. Our standard of living will probably drop because we have to spend more money. I mean, the figures have been quoted. It comes to millions of dollars; it is not just by thousands of dollars. So my plea to the Government is that if they want to have this copyright law implemented, well and good. We support it. But at the same time there must be more intellectual freedom. That is my point. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I would not like to go into the details of the copyright law. It is going to Select Committee. I think I have the sentiment of Members who have spoken out here in respect of textbooks. I know many school children not only photostat part of their textbooks but, in fact, the whole textbook and manual. I think the Government should take steps to make sure that there is a provision for cheaper textbooks for our school children. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (Kaki Bukit):</b> Sir, like the other Members of the House, I rise \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> in support of the Bill. What surprised me is that today we have the two Opposition Members supporting the Bill, in general. I am glad that they rose in support of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a point of clarification before I proceed further. I think it is not true, as what the Member for Potong Pasir has said, that all those who turned up at the rally on May Day were given umbrellas. Umbrellas were offered to supporters by some of the unions. I think it is an insult to Singaporeans to say that they need an umbrella as an incentive for them to turn up at the rally. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the other Members in the House that the new copyright legislation is necessary in the long term interest of Singapore if we are to develop ourselves as an international brain services centre and a publishing centre and, most important of all, if we are to encourage creativity among Singaporeans. I have, however, three points of clarification to seek from the Minister. One area of concern, as already expressed by the Member for Chong Boon, is that the consumers are wary that copyright owners may take undue advantage of the new law to profiteer. Besides the suggestion raised by the Member for Chong Boon, may I propose that the Minister considers setting up a body to regulate prices of copyright materials. Perhaps the Ministry of Trade and Industry Anti Profiteering Committee could take on this role. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area of concern, as most commonly expressed by most local businessmen, is that the new law will put them out of business. By and large, I think the law is in the long term interest of Singapore but there is a need for the Government to allow some short term period for these businessmen to adjust. May I therefore propose that the Minister considers, after legislation is passed, granting a grace period of six months to a year for these businessmen to adjust. This is necessary because, in this period of recession, businessmen find it even more difficult to raise capital to invest in new activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, an area which I think is of importance is the need for communication. This copyright legislation will have a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> large impact on a large cross section of our society, from school children to businessmen. May I propose that the Minister consider launching a comprehensive educational programme through the mass media and the various grassroots organizations to explain the various aspects of the copyright legislation and its implications so as to clear any confusion and to allay the fears of the public before legislation is passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have taken note of the various points and suggestions made by hon. Members. I thank them for their expressions of support and I give them the assurance that their views will be carefully examined by Government as well as by the Select Committee. In view of the fact that the Bill will be referred to Select Committee, hon. Members will understand if I do not deal with each and every one of their points so as not to pre-empt consideration and decision on their points by the Select Committee. I will refer to a few points brought up by some Members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Bukit Timah asked whether the 30-day period is too short for international film manufacturers from publishing it here. This point actually will have to be taken care of by bilateral agreements or by accession to the international copyright conventions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has referred to clause 199 and asked whether it meant that no action can be brought against infringement of copyrights which took place prior to the commencement of the operation of the Act. The answer to that is that infringement of copyright which occurred prior to the commencement of the operation of the Act can still be proceeded with by action. But the penalties and the other provisions will be governed by the existing law and not by the new provisions of the proposed Bill. He has referred to what he calls the computer network. He is obviously very well versed with computers and I would suggest that he kindly elaborate this point either in writing or in oral representation to the Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson expressed concern for textbooks for students, a point also made by other Members. In this regard, I would like to refer to the answer which was, in fact, given by the Member for Chong Boon - that licensing and other contractual arrangements can be made. But equally and more important, I would like to point out that there are specific provisions in the Bill for educational institutions and I would like particularly to refer to clause 52 onwards. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the comment about the provisions dealing with Government subject to confirmation which I have to make with the draftsmen, my understanding is that these are, in fact, identical to the provisions to be found in the legislation of other countries, such as Malaysia and Australia. But, as I said, this is subject to confirmation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point was also made by the Member for Anson that private educational institutions seem to be excluded from the benefit of the provisions pertaining to educational institutions. Where such educational institutions are organized solely for profit, I think the reason may be quite obvious because where educational institutions are run for profit the persons running the institution logically ought to bear the burden of infringement of copyright. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Chong Boon referred to clauses 31 and 32 and the concern and grievances of a particular group of book distributors. I assure him that this is being looked into as of now and it is a matter which will also be looked into by the Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The points made by the Member for Fengshan have some validity and the details of his proposal as to whether the exceptions made for consumers who make copies solely for personal or private use can be extended to areas other than that of recording or film or television broadcast will be looked into by the Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important point was raised by the Member for Radin Mas when he said that several persons, including school children, are very concerned and apprehensive that their possession of materials - photo- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> copied or duplicated materials - might render themselves subject to prosecution. On this point, I think it is important for me to emphasize and to assure the Member that, under the proposed provisions of the law, possession will not be an offence. That is an important point which I think needs to be emphasized if, as indicated by the Member for Radin Mas, there is some confusion on this. Possession will not render one to criminal prosecution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir supported the Bill but everything else that he spoke had nothing to do with the Bill. His points were completely irrelevant. He talked about intellectual freedom and so on. I do not intend to deal with the breakfast or dinners that he had with various persons. But one important point which I want to make by way of rebuttal is that, and I quote his exact words, \"Every publication in Singapore will have to be screened.\" These are his exact words - \"every publication\". I would like to ask him under which law, either in this Copyright Bill or under which other provision, is any publication, including his journal of the Singapore Democratic Party, required to be submitted for the contents to be screened? I will save him the embarrassment of having to rise up and admit his ignorance because there is no law requiring him or anybody else who wants to publish a book or any other publication to submit the contents of the publication to any Government agency for prior censorship. He knows it. The publication of his Party - I forget the name and how often it appears - has carried all sorts of criticisms of the Government. Has he or his Party or the editors ever been asked to submit the contents of any forthcoming issue for publication for censorship or for approval or disapproval? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I just clarify this point? Is it not true that publications like plays and books have to be submitted for vetting by the Ministry of Culture? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this shows his ignorance. What he said was - these are his words - \"Every publication will have to be screened.\" There is, and any lawyer or layman would know, a very big difference between publication of a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> work and a performance in public before an audience of a play or a drama. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Or a book. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Or of a book. I do not know how you perform a book! Would the Member for Potong Pasir admit - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is it not true that plays and books have to be vetted by the Ministry of Culture? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Can I ask him whether he insists that every publication has to be screened in Singapore, including - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Books and plays. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Can he tell me one instance where his Party or any other person had to submit a manuscript of a book before the book was printed? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> What is meant is publication of plays and books. Is it not true that these have to be sent for vetting by the Ministry of Culture? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> He made a statement. I am telling him now that it is totally untrue. I am asking him for his authority for the proposition that, under the laws of Singapore, any play or book has to be sent for prior censorship. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Isn't that true? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Do not ask me whether it is true. He made the statement. I am asking for his authority. Does he know of any instance or does he know of any provision in any law which requires a person who is about to publish a play from getting approval and submitting its contents? I am waiting for the answer, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> As far as I know, these matters, like books and plays, will have to be submitted for vetting before they can be publicly shown. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Publication? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes, publicly shown. Anyone who writes a play and he wants to show it in public - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Perform it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Perform it in public, that play, the script. Are you saying \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that they can just do it and go and perform it in public? If you say that, then we will do it. Is that not the correct position in Singapore today, that nobody can just write a play and perform it? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> There are very few instances where the author of a play performs the play himself. I have asked on numerous instances for the Member for Potong Pasir to cite me actual examples or, if he cannot cite examples, the provision of any law or regulation which requires the author of a play, of a book, of a drama, of a novel, of a newspaper, or a periodical, to submit the contents prior to publication to a Government agency for approval. The answer is: there is no such legal requirement. The only legal requirement that exists is with regard to public performance of plays which may require licensing under the relevant rules of the Public Entertainments Act. So the Member for Potong Pasir not only does not say anything about the Copyright Bill but even his irrelevancies are totally wrong. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> rose - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, may I finish? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> He spoke about the May Day Rally. I am glad the Member for Kaki Bukit has answered him effectively. I was there, and I can testify that many of the persons who were there went there with infants in arms, little children who had to be carried. That speaks much more than the Member for Potong Pasir who admitted publicly that the only instance when he would have gone was if he was assured of an umbrella! So much for workers' solidarity! \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kaki Bukit finally spoke about some of the points raised by other Members. His point about the need for communication and publicity programme is a valid one and one which we will give careful attention. As it is, some publicity has already been generated. But I take his point that as it is a Bill which affects so many persons, we should ensure that the maximum dissemination of the salient features of the Bill should be made public. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, I do not wish to go into the details of the points raised. Suffice it for me to say that copyright legislation is a very difficult legislation because it has to reconcile competing and conflicting interests - the interests of the author, the interests of the owner of the copyright, the interests of the consumer, the interests of the educational institutions, and so on. It has taken some time to draft this Bill but the time was necessary to ensure that the reconciliation was as desirable as possible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the nature of copyright legislation, none of the interested groups can insist on having the cake and to eat it as well. There has to be compromise and adjustments and this is what our new law does. It gives protection to the author or owner of the copyright but at the same time provisions have been made for fair dealings, for the issue of statutory licences, for the issue of compulsory licensing arrangement, special provisions exist to cater to the needs of libraries, educational institutions and so on. There are, it is true, provisions for infringement of copyright but it is also provided that not every infringement would attract criminal prosecution. The law, in other words, Sir, attempts to be fair to all parties, is practical, and I think it would serve our country's national interest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Copyright Bill be committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and seven members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection. - [Prof. S. Jayakumar]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>COMPANIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>12.28 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is, I believe, an opportune moment for me to reiterate Government's belief in the merits of a healthy private enterprise system. At the core of the private enterprise system is the limited \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> liability company and the ability to produce profits is the principal yardstick to judge the success or failure of a company. The limited liability company does not simply represent one interest but a confluence involving the interests of investors, creditors, employees, consumers and the public. It has, therefore, long been recognized and accepted that since the company is an artificial creation of law, it is the duty of Government to ensure that its operations do not prejudice these diverse interests. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are situations where the privilege of limited liability that has been accorded to companies has been abused by those who are concerned with their management. Inadequate disclosure standards allowed such companies to disguise unlawful transactions. As we have seen in the recent past, companies were used as instruments by directors to raise funds, which are then siphoned out fraudulently leaving companies in financial haemorrhage and doomed to destruction. The consequences of such abuse of corporate power and privilege are pervasive. It has thus become necessary for more thorough and realistic appraisal of the laws relating to the disclosure of companies' affairs and the duties and responsibilities of companies' management. This is one of the principal objectives of this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also aware that not all company collapses are due to fraud or other economic crimes. Collapses could be due to cyclical economic factors and indeed this is part and parcel of the private enterprise system. It is also evident that the mortality of companies increases during an economic recession. But even such collapses are not without economic and social misery for various interest groups like shareholders, creditors and employees. Often, collapses are sparked off by the practice of some lenders to foreclose on companies at the first hint of financial trouble caused by temporary liquidity problems. However, some of these companies may have the right products and technology to continue to compete in international markets and given time could actually be cured of their illiquidity. The main objective of this Bill therefore is to provide a legal \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> framework to give such companies which are in financial trouble a more even chance to rehabilitate themselves and be restored to profitability. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, Mr Speaker, Sir, the major amendments designed for better disclosure of company affairs and greater investor protection are found in:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Clauses 36 to 43 and clause 70, which substitutes a new Ninth Schedule. These amendments are designed to impose upon directors of a holding company duties to lay before the company's general meeting the consolidated profit and loss account and the balance sheet statement for the group. The Ninth Schedule is amended to effect additional disclosure requirements so that the readers of accounts can better assess the financial positions of companies. For example, intercompany transactions and an estimate of the maximum amount of contingent liabilities for which a holding company and its subsidiaries could become liable must be disclosed. Disclosure of director -related loans are also required. Particulars dealing with the method of valuation of assets are also provided for; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Clauses 47 to 53 which strengthen the provisions dealing with investigations of criminal offences and the procedures in relation to disclosure of inspector's reports. Clause 53 confers upon an inspector the power to require a director or past director to produce all documents relating to his bank account if there are reasonable grounds for believing that money in the account is connected with unlawful activities. Also, in order to provide a more expeditious method of conducting company investigation, clause 5 enables the Minister or a person authorized by him to require the production of the books of the company and to take copies of them or extracts from them. These amendments are based on recommendations made by a committee of the United Kingdom Metropolitan Police that was commissioned by Government to examine commercial regulation generally in Singapore. These new powers are necessary if we are to deal effectively with commercial fraud. The House is well aware of the devastation that such fraud could cause. We cannot afford \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to disregard this threat if we wish to continue to attract investments. This clause, I wish to stress, is included to confer a pre-investigative power on the Minister. It will be used discriminately and safeguards have been inserted to ensure that any information obtained will be kept secret. Honestly -managed companies will have nothing to fear from these new powers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other provisions concerned with investor protection include:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Clause 11 which confers upon the Registrar of Companies power to refuse registration of a prospectus if it appears to him that it is not in the interests of the investing public to do so; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Clause 14 which repeals and re-enacts existing section 76 prohibiting a company giving financial assistance for the purchase of its own shares. The main purpose of the section is to ensure that the capital of the company is preserved intact; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Clause 25 which provides that a company should not, without prior sanction of a general meeting, enter into specified transactions with directors or persons connected with them; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Clause 27 which requires a company to disclose directors' emoluments when served with a notice by at least 10% of its members or holders in aggregate of 5% or more of its capital; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Clause 65 which provides that a person shall not make an offer to the general public of any shares for purchase unless the offer is accompanied by a statement in writing containing the particulars set out in the clause. These particulars mainly refer to the identity of the offeror. The exemptions from this clause are broadly similar to those under existing law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other major reform is found in clause 46 which introduces a judicial management procedure to provide for financially troubled but viable companies to rehabilitate themselves. The procedure has been adapted from the relevant insolvency laws in the United States and the United Kingdom, and strives to strike a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> balance between the interests of the shareholders and the creditors. Under the procedure, the Court may, on the application of an insolvent or near-insolvent company or its creditors, appoint a judicial manager if it considers that the appointment would promote one or more of the following purposes:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the survival of the company, or the whole or part of its business as a going concern; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the promotion of a compromise or arrangement between the company and its creditors; or \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) a more advantageous realization of its assets than in a winding-up. The Court may also invite the Minister to make a nomination, or the Minister may himself nominate a person to act as a judicial manager, if he considers it is in the public's interest to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be noted that the benefits of a successful company rescue accrue not only to its shareholders but to employees, the business community and the general public. A key element in a company rescue is the provision of a breathing space during which plans can be put together to achieve the purposes just mentinoed. The judicial management procedure, accordingly, provides for a statutory moratorium on all actions and proceedings against a company. Government is also aware, however, of the danger of undermining prudent lending practice by prejudicing creditors' rights to enforce their security. Special provision is therefore made in section 227H to give recognition to the rights of secured lenders. With the approval of the Court, the judicial manager may dispose of the property subject to security, other than those under floating charge and the net proceeds of the disposal would be applied towards discharging the sums secured by that security. The new judicial management procedure, therefore, provides a legal framework that would, in a suitable case, enable the rescue of a potentially viable business and thus prevent a premature liquidation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps at this point, I should utter a few words of caution. The new provisions under Part VIIIA must not \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> be used as delaying tactics to avoid an inevitable liquidation of a company that is hopelessly insolvent. A Court will make a full enquiry into the financial affairs of a company and its prospects for rehabilitation or reconstruction, etc, before making a judicial management order. Other provisions in this section are designed to deter frivolous applications being made to the Courts. The new provisions are not a panacea for beleaguered companies that are incapable of being rescued and are destined for liquidation. Government's objective is not to tamper with the normal entry and exit of firms in the private enterprise system but to provide a chance to resuscitate some financially troubled companies that are capable of returning to profitability. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other areas which Government believes it is desirable that the impact of existing law should be ameliorated. Clause 22 amends section 149 of the Act which deals with powers to restrain persons from acting as directors of companies, where they have been directors of two or more companies that have gone into insolvent liquidations within a 5-year period and have been found to be unfit to continue to manage companies. Having regard to the considerable public debate and criticism that section 149 has excited, particularly as regards the principle of automatic disqualification, I think that it is necessary to spend some time to clarify the intent of this section. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, section 149 raises a presumption that a person who is or has been a director of two companies that have gone into insolvent liquidation within the 5-year period is unfit to act as a director until he satisfies the Court that their collapse was not due to his irresponsible or unscrupulous conduct. The policy in the section is that the public should be safeguarded against unscrupulous or irresponsible directors who trade through the vehicle of two or more companies and allow such companies to become insolvent and then establish a new company to wreak financial havoc, all the while, leaving behind a trail of unpaid creditors and retrenched workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The section is based, in concept, on section 9 of the UK Insolvency Act 1976 \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> (now repealed) and section 300 of the UK Companies Act 1985 (now repealed also). I should, however, mention that the UK Insolvency Act 1985 makes even more radical changes than those appearing in the abovementioned sections. For example, under the UK provisions, a director could become personally liable for the debts of an insolvent company if he knew or ought to have known that there was no reasonable prospect that the company would avoid going into insolvent liquidation and had not taken steps to minimize the loss to creditors. Further, the Court in the UK may make a disqualification order against a person who is or has been a director of a company where there has been only one company insolvency. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Government is aware that section 149 also catches the responsible and innocent director who will have to satisfy the Court that the collapse of the two or more companies was not due to his recklessness, etc. Nevertheless, we believe that only by conducting a judicial enquiry can the true cause of the insolvencies be established and that, until they are so established, it is necessary for the protection of the public that the directors concerned should not continue to manage companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 149 has also aroused considerable criticism from the Law Society and the Society of Accountants which have sought to have excluded from the operation of the section on behalf of their members who act as directors of companies - often as non-executive directors. Company law draws no distinction, it is noted, between the duties and the obligations of executive directors and non-executive directors. Indeed, as non-executive directors, they are expected to contribute their expertise in business affairs for the benefit of the company. Their duties go beyond mere attendance at board meetings. Further, a conscientious non-executive director should, in Government's view, set a practical limit on the number of his non-executive directorships if he is to properly discharge his duties and obligations to his companies. These considerations are regrettably often ignored in Singapore. In the result, Government sees no good reason to favour directors who \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> are members of professional partnerships. Besides, to discriminate in such a manner may be challengeable as being contrary to Article 12 of the Constitution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is pertinent to note that up to August 1985, out of the 68 persons who were disqualified by the section, only three of them applied to the Court for leave. The Court granted leave in each of the three cases to the directors concerned and allowed them to resume their directorships unconditionally. It is not apparent, therefore, that the section is operating unjustly or that it is causing unnecessary hardship. Government is therefore not minded at this stage to abandon the principle in section 149. Government, however, agrees that the rigour of the application of the section should be modified in four major respects. Clause 22, in amending section 149, would have the effect of lessening the impact of the section on corporate management in the following ways: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) by excluding from the operation of the section, unregistered companies as defined in section 350(1). The result would be that persons who are disqualified under the section would not be debarred from participating in partnerships or associations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) by providing a defence to persons - \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n             (i) who resign as directors from newly formed\r\n\r\n                 companies before these companies have\r\n\r\n                 commenced business or exercised any\r\n\r\n                 borrowing powers; or\r\n\r\n            (ii) who can show that they could not, with the\r\n\r\n                 exercise of reasonable diligence, have been\r\n\r\n                 aware of the fact or occurrence\r\n\r\n                 constituting to the offence;\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) by introducing a cut-off period of three years under section 149(1)(b) in respect of the second company that went into insolvent liquidation. No cut-off period was previously given. The three-year cut-off period is the same as presently exists under section 149(1)(a) in respect of the first insolvent liquidation; and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) by enabling the Minister to exclude from the operation of the section certain companies (and their directors) carrying on business in venture capital industries and thus not discourage entrepreneurial ventures in these high-risk industries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another area where my Ministry believes relief should be given is in relation to retrenchment benefits and gratuities payable to an employee when a company is being wound up. Under existing law, employees have no priority under section 328 for payment of retrenchment benefits and gratuities over other unsecured debts, though they do have priority for wages, including wages payable during a period of notice of termination of employment. Government is of the view that it is fairer to accord priority to such employee benefits and gratuities in the winding-up of a company. Accordingly, the principal amendment to section 328 would ensure that retrenchment benefits and gratuities would be included in the definition of \"salary\" in subsection (2) and thus have the same priority as salaries and wages. The other amendment proposed to the section is to give a higher priority to pension fund contributions, including CPF contributions, in the event of the winding-up of a company, than is provided for in the existing section 328. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other clauses in the Bill which are designed to improve the administration of the Act. Together with the amendments which are of a drafting nature or are intended to increase fines, they are sufficiently referred to in the Explanatory Statement. The only other provision in this Bill deserving of special mention appears in clause 10, which would relieve foreign companies that are listed on the Stock Exchange from the obligation to file an abridged prospectus when making a rights issue. This is in line with the desire of Government to develop the capital market in Singapore and to reduce related costs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the major reforms that are proposed in the Bill and their implications to the business and financial community and the public at large, I propose that the Bill be committed to Select Committee, as was the case with most of the previous Bills to amend the Companies Act, in order \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to enable the views of all interested parties to be obtained. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Boon Heng (Kebun Baru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Companies (Amendment) Bill as moved by the Minister for Finance. But I have some points which I would like to put to him, and also to explain why I support this Bill going to Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me express my appreciation to the Minister for clause 60 which will amend section 328 of the Companies Act which now puts retrenchment benefits under priority in case a company should go into liquidation. The Minister will recall and Members will recall that in several past sessions of Parliament, we spoke on this subject and we are glad to note that finally the Minister for Finance has heeded our calls. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to turn to section 149 of the Companies Act which is now covered under clause 22 of the Amendment Bill. The Minister has explained in some detail on the desirability of section 149. However, it has attracted a lot of criticisms that, while the objective of the section is desirable, it is unduly harsh and labelled as an administrative overkill. But I am glad that the Minister has at least taken note of the criticisms that have been levelled and now makes it easier on the part of directors to discharge their duties and tries to remove part of the section which would deter the setting up of companies, particularly in those volatile high-tech and high-risk businesses. I had initially thought that perhaps section 149 would be repealed. But the Minister has chosen to amend certain aspects of it which have been criticized. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is still one point to note, ie, a director who has been a director of two companies which have gone insolvent would be debarred from being a director of another company. Would this still not be unduly harsh on such directors? Because, as the Minister has said, there are many causes for company failures, would not such a clause make a person \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> guilty until proven innocent? Rather than the other way round where a person is innocent until proven guilty. So I hope this particular section would receive the comments of the public since it is a matter that has aroused great interest, and I hope that the people who have an interest in this particular section would make their representations to the Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to turn to the provision for judicial management. The intention of clause 46 is wholly laudable from my point of view. This, as the Minister has said, is conceptually similar to the Chapter 11 proceedings in the United States. Under the new provisions, companies that are facing temporary liquidity problems should be given a reasonable chance to continue to operate and to overcome their problems. And in this current recession, owing to a lowering of confidence, creditors have been nervous and there have been some instances of hasty action being taken to secure payment, forcing premature closure of companies and causing unnecessary loss of jobs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the good intentions of this new chapter, I think it will be prudent for us to examine how the provisions would function. There has to be a fair balance, as the Minister has said, between the interests of the company, its shareholders, directors and employees as against the interests of creditors. And all these would have to be thoroughly considered. But no matter how laudable the intentions of the proposed new chapter, we must be careful to avoid any possible undesirable effects. For example, Chapter 11 proceedings in the United States have been criticized by their trade unions. It has been alleged that some companies have taken advantage of Chapter 11 proceedings to proscribe trade union rights. The proposed amendments do not spell out the conditions that may be imposed on the conduct of industrial relations once a judicial manager is appointed. I think this should be verified. This is one example of the issues that we will have to examine when we introduce this new provision for a judicial manager. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thus support the move to refer the Bill to a Select Committee of Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the move to commit this Bill to a Select Committee as there are extensive new provisions governing the management of companies, especially those provisions on judicial management and definitions. As this and others will be deliberated by the Select Committee, I shall not go into details. However, I must voice my unhappiness over one particular provision which is the result of the deliberations of a previous Select Committee. I am referring to section 149 which the Minister has just elaborated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment in clause 22 makes practically no change to section 149. In essence, the so-called double liquidation penalty in section 149 remains intact. Coming on the heels of several requests from businessmen, professionals, Members of this House, and the recommendation by the Economic Committee that section 149 be revised, the proposed changes come as a great disappointment. I am afraid that this may inhibit further progress that we are aiming for in business. Section 149 takes no account for the vagaries of business as has been pointed out before. It treats employee directors no differently from those directors who are shareholders in the company, neither does it make a distinction between executive and non-executive directors. The Minister has pointed out that in company law there is no difference between executive and non-executive directors. But in practice, there is a difference. Although section 149 is based on section 9 of the UK Insolvency Act which he has just mentioned, I understand that a director is debarred on the specific orders of a court order at a liquidation hearing. This is not automatic and I believe it does not apply to all directors unless the Act has been extensively amended in 1985. The UK Insolvency Act makes a specific order on the debarment of a director at the time of a liquidation hearing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he is also right when he mentioned that the UK Act has been amended and now makes the penalties even higher for directors who continue to transgress and operate despite the debarment. In this instance, perhaps we should also do a similar thing. A director who has already \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> been debarred should, of course, be personally liable for all debts that he has incurred when he continues to operate despite being debarred. But on the other hand, we have to look into making some specific provisions to protect the innocent directors, especially those who are employee directors. I do not know how much chance we have in Select Committee. This was well deliberated in the previous Select Committee. But I honestly hope that the next Select Committee will take a much closer view of section 149. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is one minute before 1.00 pm and it is an appropriate moment to take the suspension. I suspend this sitting and will take the Chair again at 2.30 pm. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <i>Sitting accordingly suspended</i>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <i>at 12.59 pm until 2.30 pm.</i>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <i>Sitting resumed at 2.30 pm</i>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, even without the Minister referring to the events towards the end of last year, it was quite apparent to everyone that this Bill was prompted by those events. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We certainly welcome some of the amendments that are proposed to the Companies Act. But I have questions, particularly on one amendment. But before I come to that, may I say that we welcome the amendment to section 328 of the Act. It is long overdue. The amendment would make it possible now for workers to get retrenchment benefits in companies that face winding-up or liquidation in priority over other unsecured debts. That is certainly a step for the protection of our workers, and we welcome it and we are grateful to the Minister for bringing in that amendment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the amendment to section 149. As the Minister has said, there has been considerable criticism over the existing section 149. May I say I am glad that an attempt has been made to mitigate the rigours of section 149. But in my view these amendments do not go far enough. I do not think the amendments deal with the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> criticisms that have been levelled at section 149 of the Act. I do hope that the Select Committee will pay greater attention to the objections raised by people who should know, to section 149. The gravamen of the charge is that it penalizes directors who may be completely innocent, and that is something which we should not encourage. It departs, as has been mentioned by a Member speaking on this Bill, from the principle that unless somebody is proven guilty he should be presumed to be innocent of any guilt or offence or default. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now may I turn, Sir, to clause 5 which introduces new sections 8A to 8H. Sir, these proposed sections 8A to 8H give the Minister, as it were, absolute powers to require a corporation to produce books relating to the affairs of the corporation not only to him or to his Ministry but to any person authorized by him. As I said, Mr Speaker, Sir, a little while ago, it would seem to be an absolute power vested in the Minister without any qualification. I would like to hear from the Minister the reason why his Ministry thinks the Minister should be invested with this power. One suspects it is because the Ministry perhaps takes the view that it does not have the power to call for books of a company and to inspect the books. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will recall that when I tabled my motion on the Pan-El crisis, I then attributed the events that eventually occurred to the neglect of the MAS. The Minister was vehement in his answer that the Ministry or the MAS did not have the powers to call for the books or to ask for explanations of the affairs of the corporation. They referred the complaints to the Stock Exchange Committee and the Stock Exchange Committee came back with a reply, \"We do not have the powers\", and so everybody was content to leave things as they were. But as I pointed out, there was power under the Securities Industry Act for the MAS to have referred the complaints to the Securities Industry Council, and then for the Council to require all the books to be produced to it for inspection, to investigate the affairs of the company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is power there under the Securities Industry Act, and the new Act of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> course takes the powers much further. But it is not just that. There is already sufficient power under the Companies Act at present. I am, of course, referring to Part IX of the Act which deals with investigations. By section 230 of the Companies Act, the Minister may declare a company a declared company, which would have the effect of applying the provisions of Part IX to that company and, having declared it, to appoint one or more inspectors to investigate the affairs of that company and to report his opinion thereon to the Minister. That is to be found in section 231. But section 230, unlike the proposed section 8A, spells out quite clearly the situations in which the Minister may exercise the power given to him under the Act. They are all spelt out in section 230 in paragraphs (a) to (d), and they are quite wide enough. Paragraph (a) for example, allows the Minister to declare a company a declared company for the purposes of the Act where a prima facie case has been established that, for the protection of the public or the shareholders or the creditors of the company, it is desirable that the affairs of the company should be investigated. In paragraph (b) you find that the Minister can also do that where there are allegations of fraud, misfeasance or other misconduct by persons who are or have been concerned with the formation or management of the company. Then you have got a much wider one under paragraph (c): that for any other reason it is in the public interest that the affairs of the company should be investigated under this Part. Finally, in the case of a foreign company, that the appropriate authority of another country has requested for such a declaration to be made. So there you have it. The very same powers that are now proposed to be given under the proposed sections 8A to 8H, but the advantage and the saving grace, if I may say, of section 230 is that it spells out the situations under which the Minister may exercise the power. Section 8A does not do that. It simply says that if the Minister is satisfied that there is good reason for so doing, he may act under the section. No attempt is made to spell out what would be a good reason for the Minister to exercise this power. I have several times complained about the powers given to Ministers without restraint or without subject to limits imposed by Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other undesirable thing about this section is that it does not spell out who the authorized person may be under the proposed section 8A. Under section 230 it is an auditor who can be appointed to investigate the affairs of the company. There seems to be a view, Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Government that it is necessary for the Government to amass itself with power after power in order to control or to regulate the affairs of its citizens, and that of course includes companies and businesses. What is needed, if I may say, is not just amassing of powers to itself by the Government but the exercise of proper judgment. You may have any amount of powers but if you are not prepared to exercise your judgment, then no amount of powers is going to help you. I cited a case in point, the Pan-El affair. The power was there all along. It was there in the Securities Industry Act. It was there in the Companies Act, under section 230. But whoever made the decision did not exercise his judgment properly. He assumed quite wrongly, in my view, that the MAS did not have the powers. And so we had the debacle of Pan-El and the debacle of the Stock Exchange suspending its activities for three days. So there you have it. It is a failure to exercise judgment. I would therefore ask the Minister whether he would try and justify the necessity for further powers to be given to the Minister. What we need is an assurance that his Ministry will exercise its judgment more carefully in the affairs of companies or corporations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two other matters, Mr Speaker, Sir. The first is the proposed amendment to section 50. I have raised this point before but that is no reason for not raising it again and, that is, the provision in the section for an appeal from the decision of the Registrar of Companies where he refuses to register a prospectus of a company. Under the proposed amendment, any person who is aggrieved may appeal to the Minister and the Minister's decision is stated to be final, not to be called in question in any court. This is a very familiar thing and we get it time and time again in Government legislation, and I have drawn attention every time to the danger \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of investing powers without any questioning by an independent tribunal, from any review of the Minister's powers or of any executive authority. I cannot see why in this case an appeal could not have been provided to the courts. I am sure it is not going to be argued or stated that it would be against the national interest or detrimental to the safety or security of the country if the matter were brought before the courts and is debated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask when will some of these provisions of the Companies Act, particularly in its requirements in the preparation of accounts be made applicable to statutory boards. Under the Companies Act, statutory boards, because they are an agency of the Government, are exempt. Is there any real reason, any valid reason, why statutory boards should be made exempt? I have referred to the accounts of the HDB that they do not bring in the accounts of the subsidiary companies. They do not consolidate those accounts into their accounts. And the Auditor General himself has referred to certain omissions in the HDB's accounts. But they remain simply at that because the Companies Act does not extend to the statutory boards. So we have the HDB concealing its profits and not showing them in the accounts so that the public are not aware that the HDB has got something like $100 million or $150 million tucked away somewhere else. So I would make a plea that it is time sections relating to the keeping of accounts, if not the whole of the Companies Act, be made applicable to statutory boards, that they be brought within the purview and control of the Companies Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this latest Companies (Amendment) Bill is 120 pages long, excluding the explanatory notes. It is a formidable technical document. It seeks to amend the present company law on various aspects and to provide for the creation of a judicial manager to look after financially troubled companies with a view to their rehabilitation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon I would like to concentrate on two aspects of the amendments. The first relates to the amendment to section 149 of the Companies Act on \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> double liquidation and the second on judicial management of a financially troubled company. Section 149 of the Companies Act has generated a fair amount of controversy. This provision automatically disqualifies a person who had been a director of two companies which were wound up because of insolvency within five years of each other from being a director for five years. The working of it has been seen to be harsh. Fairly prominent businessmen whose conduct the business community views as blameless have been disqualified under this provision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unfairness comes in because, firstly, the disqualification is automatic and, secondly, there is no cut-off period for the second company that goes into liquidation. Under the existing law, a person could have resigned from a company, say, 20 years ago and had absolutely no dealing with the company for the last 20 years and yet he could be automatically disqualified as a director if the company should go into liquidation within five years of another company from which he had also resigned but less than three years before its liquidation. This automatic disqualification may be convenient for the bureaucrats but would definitely discourage genuine entrepreneurs from sitting on boards of companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister says that there should be a presumption of incompetence to protect investors. But this presumption offends against the fundamental legal principle that a person is presumed to be innocent until he is proven guilty. The present amendment which seeks a cut-off period of three years for the second company and provides for a defence to any prosecution will afford some degree of relief but I am afraid it does not go far enough. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the provision, as I see it, Mr Speaker, Sir, is to disqualify directors who are incompetent and who have made a mess of the affairs of the companies of which they are directors. These people should be prevented from being directors of other companies and to make further messes. The present automatic disqualification, even as amended, does not discriminate the innocent from the guilty. As long as a person is a director of two companies which go into liquidation \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> within five years of each other and the companies are insolvent at the time of being wound up, he is automatically disqualified. This works hardship especially in the present economic recession where it is likely, particularly in respect of companies with family connections, that if one company goes down the other would soon follow within a fairly short time all for no reason other than the general economic condition over which he has no control. Yet he is disqualified and can only prove his innocence by an application to court to lift his disqualification. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aim is to catch the guilty, surely the logical thing to do is to allow the court in a winding-up to pronounce whether or not any director involved in the company is guilty for having mismanaged the affairs of the company and, if so, whether he should be disqualified to sit as a director in another company and for how long. The Minister has referred to the UK Insolvency Act, 1985. The UK Act does not provide for automatic disqualification. It empowers the court to pronounce on the director whether he is fit or not in any case before it. The court can do so on its own motion or on the application of the Secretary of State, the UK equivalent of a Minister in Singapore. I hope the Minister will look at the provision closely when the Bill is before the Select Committee and to make the necessary amendments. This would have a stimulating effect on the formation of companies and in however small a way may help in the recovery of the economy from its present recession. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to say a few words on the provision enabling financially troubled companies to be put under judicial management. This is a totally new concept in the insolvency laws of Singapore. It is to be welcomed, especially in view of the present economic condition. The new procedure will enable financially troubled companies to have a certain degree of protection from its creditors. At present, our insolvency laws are pro-creditor. There is no formal protection of the debtor from the creditors. A company unable to pay its debt may be wound up for temporary liquidity problems even though its long-term prospects are good. The new provision is a major innovation in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the general structure of the insolvency procedure and will provide an interregnum during which the affairs of the company can be sorted out. It also provides an opportunity for the company and its creditors to reach some sort of compromise or accommodation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill sets out the circumstances under which a company or its creditors can apply to court for the appointment of a judicial manager. It also sets out the judicial manager's powers and functions. The exact powers and functions of the judicial manager will no doubt be looked at carefully when the Bill is before the Select Committee. The Bill provides that only an approved company auditor can be appointed judicial manager unless the appointment is made by the court or on the nomination of the Minister. The question that may be asked is whether an approved company auditor is the best qualified person to be appointed judicial manager whose primary task is not to liquidate the company but to chartits path back to profitability and, possibly, future growth. Entrepreneurs with proven abilities may be a better person. But who is a proven entrepreneur? Perhaps the Registrar of Companies can compile a list of such capable persons for selection and appointment by the court. A merchant banker or a retired top administrator from the Civil Service or even a retired Minister of the Government can go on the list. These people may have a broader perspective than an approved company auditor. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy that the Bill is to be committed to a Select Committee and no doubt these and other details will be looked at closely. Sir, I support this Bill in principle. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to make a few remarks on this Companies (Amendment) Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to voice my general support for the various amendments proposed in the Bill, particularly the requirement to furnish more information in the financial reports of companies and also the provision for a company in financial \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> difficulty to be put under judicial management pending a restructuring that would lead to the revival of the company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I would like to express my disappointment over one section of the Bill, and that is, the proposed amendment to section 149. I believe that, in the first instance, section 149 is over-cumbersome and unnecessarily harsh to directors and managers. The provisions of this section act as a deterrent to local entrepreneurs to start new firms. In addition, corporate officers who are assigned to sit on the boards of companies would hesitate or be discouraged from accepting such appointments. As the Minister has said, the blame for the failure of companies often cannot be attributed to the directors or even to the management. Sometimes market conditions change so fast that remedial actions could not be taken in time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to section 149 now seek to limit the liability period to three years. But if we ask any director or manager, I feel that most of them would think that this is little added comfort to them. Innocent directors and managers who already have one insolvent liquidated company under their name will have to continue working with the uncomfortable feeling that section 149 is a tightening noose around their necks. They cannot afford to have just one more failure in their hands. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that we should not make it such that a person who has been involved in two failed companies should have a stigma placed on him. Entrepreneurs have to try again and again. They start new businesses and invariably they run companies which are always at a higher risk. Even mature established companies have their ups and downs. Very often tough entrepreneurs take failures in their stride. They quickly pick up the pieces and start all over again. Hence, I will say that we should not limit their chances of success by just saying that they should have only two tries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to stifle entrepreneurship in Singapore, I would like to see the provisions of section 149 amended to tackle only those managers or directors who are found to be fraudulent. Ordinarily, those innocent directors and managers who \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> have done their best to run their companies should not be taken to task. Therefore, Sir, I believe many people feel that the provision in this section 149 should be amended such that it should not be automatic, and only those people who are proven or found to be fraudulent should be taken to task. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this light, I support the Minister's proposal for a new provision which enables section 149 to exempt certain companies which, in his view, are venture capital industries to be gazetted by him. I hope he could give us more details on how he proposes to identify companies which are in this class, and whether he could take a more liberal attitude in terms of classifying companies which may be exempted from section 149. In view of the comments made by my colleagues and I welcome the proposal by the Minister to commit this Bill to a Select Committee which I hope will listen to the many appeals that have been made to this House. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (Kaki Bukit):</b> Sir, I rise in support of the Bill in general. Except for one or two reservations, I think the proposed amendments to the Companies Act are steps in the right direction. Most laudable of all the amendments is the introduction of section 227 on the appointment of a judicial manager to help save the company in a financial bind from liquidation. Sir, the move will not only give the ailing company some recourse but I believe it will, in general, bring about greater communication between the company and its creditors, an area which is much lacking now. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to make two observations or suggestions, one in respect of section 149 and the other in relation to section 171. Section 149 has been debated by Members. I share their surprise and concern that the section has not been repealed, as popularly demanded. The provisions in the section specify that companies on venture capital business will be exempted. I share the concern of the Member for Thomson that venture capital business should be clearly defined and the definition should be as flexible as possible. To the businessman and the layman, venture capital business is something high-tech, high-risk, high-investment manufac- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> turing business. I think we should also consider high value -added services industry, an area which we have identified as a growth area for us in the 80s. These services industries could also be classified as venture capital business. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to section 171, this section emphasizes the need for corporate company secretaries to be professionally qualified in order that they could be appointed to the post. Sir, I think the move is a praiseworthy one. The Act is, however, silent on the appointment of company directors. I am not proposing that we introduce stringent qualification criteria for officials to be appointed as company directors. I think this will be against our objective of promoting entrepreneurship. What I am suggesting is that perhaps the Minister could look into introducing minimum qualification criteria for officers to be appointed as company directors. I am concerned because under the present law office peons, company drivers and such like people are appointed as company directors as a matter of convenience, even though we are fully aware that there are more suitably qualified people in the company to assume the posts of company director. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Members of the House that, since there are many amendments in the Bill Act and that they affect a wide cross-section of the business community, the Bill should best be referred to a Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the Bill will be committed to Select Committee, I will not go into details on individual comments made by Members. But they seem to centre around one main issue, ie. section 149 which has been uniformly disliked by all the speakers this morning and this afternoon. But in defence of this section and the proposed amendments, I would like to make a few points. Firstly, section 149 applies only to companies which fail because they are insolvent, and by that I mean they fail because they owe creditors a lot of money. Companies can fail for a whole variety of other reasons. If they lose only the shareholders' money, they would not be faulted under this section. It is only when they lose large sums of money, public money, that they are caught by this section. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is also designed to penalize errors of omission rather than commission. It is arguable whether this is considered better or worse than the UK provisions which are just the other way round, where the disbarments are determined by the courts or by the Secretary of State for Industry against directors who have committed crimes against the company. The rules we are proposing are to discourage companies from appointing name-plate directors, or office boys, for reasons of convenience. As a result, executive directors are often able to manipulate companies at their leisure without restraint. Basically, outside directors represent the shareholders, the minority shareholders of the company who have no direct say in the day-to-day operations of the company. And if they are not required to exercise some responsibilities, as they are not required under present laws, the risk of executive manipulation multiplies manifold. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also said that section 149 is unfair because there is automatic disqualification. But I would like to point out that directors who are disqualified are permitted to apply to the courts and, indeed, I think the record so far suggests that the courts have been fairly liberal in re-instating them. However, since it is obviously a matter of considerable public interest, I would ask all those who are dissatisfied with the present arrangements to make their views known in writing or verbally to the members of the Select Committee for consideration. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On section 46, Insolvency Act provisions, there seems to be general support for these new provisions which are unique in that they try to arrive at a balance in protecting the interests of the shareholder and the interests of the creditor. We have not adopted the Chapter 11 provisions of the US law because they are overly protective of the shareholder and work against the interests of the creditor and cases of abuse have been known. We are proposing a compromise which will strike abalance between the interests of these two groups. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take the point that the qualifications required of a judicial manager seems fairly \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> restrictive, as he would have to be an approved company auditor. There would appear to be a case for widening the scope to include non-accountants who qualified to act as judicial managers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered most points, except the two raised by the Member for Anson. As to the question whether statutory boards should be brought under the Companies Act, I think it is unnecessary. The Member for Anson has said that because Statutory Boards do not have to comply with the Companies Act, it allows Government to conceal its profits. I think that is a totally absurd notion. Take the case of the Housing and Development Board. It is owned by the Government, which means it is owned by the people. There is no need to conceal profits, as profits belong to the people. I think it is a facile argument. However, it is not an issue I want to debate today. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the point raised by the Member for Anson as to the adequacy of powers under the existing Companies Act and the Securities Industry Act. I do not agree with his opinion obviously. He says that sections 230 and 231 give the Minister the power to declare any company a declared company. But what he does not realize is that the Minister cannot do this arbitrarily because he has to have a prima facie case and this is extremely difficult to prove under the present laws. Hence, the need for amendments introduced under sections 8A to 8H, for precisely this reason. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Companies (Amendment) Bill be committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and seven Members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection. - [Dr Hu Tsu Tau.] \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SINGAPORE FAMILY PLANNING AND POPULATION BOARD</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(REPEAL) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>3.16 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will move on behalf of my Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-1960s, Singapore was facing extremely difficult conditions. We had double-digit unemployment, the population was increasing at over 2.5% per year, and the crude birth rate was over 32 per thousand population. The deep concern of the Government over the high population growth was clearly expressed by the then Minister for Health, Mr Yong Nyuk Lin, when he moved the Second Reading of the Singapore Family Planning and Population Board Bill on 31st December 1965. He said: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Action on a national basis is required to cope with the present problem of uncontrolled increase of population which, if left unchecked, may well hinder and even nullify present great and strenuous efforts at economic expansion by the Government and its people.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Family Planning and Population Board (SFPPB) was therefore established in January 1966 to act as the agency for the promotion and dissemination of information pertaining to family planning, and to initiate and undertake family planning programmes. The Board mounted extensive and intensive publicity programmes to educate Singaporeans about family planning and to encourage them to have small families. Contraceptive services were made easily and cheaply available to all married couples through the Ministry's Maternal and Child Health Clinics. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1972, family planning educational and publicity activities were intensified, and married couples were encouraged to have no more than two children. Various population-related social policies were announced in an effort to further reduce the then total fertility rate of 3.1 per woman. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board's efforts led to a steady decline in fertility, and in 1976, Replacement Fertility was achieved. Since then, fertility has remained below replacement level. The population growth rate in recent years has been maintained at about 1.1% per year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surveys conducted periodically over the past 10 years have shown that all married women in the reproductive group are aware of family planning and know about \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> contraception. The concept of a small family appears to be generally accepted as a social norm. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, because of the expanding scale and complexity of its activities, the main functions of the Board have been increasingly integrated with the work of various departments of the Ministry of Health. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family planning services are now provided mainly through the Ministry's 29 Maternal and Child Health Clinics, while family life and family planning education are provided by the Ministry's Training and Health Education Department. This integration of activities was also noted by the Management Services Department (MSD) of the Ministry of Finance. The MSD, as part of the continuing review of Government departments and statutory boards, completed a review of the SFPPB in late 1984. It noted that the Board depended upon the staff of the Ministry of Health to provide the expertise and leadership in several specialized areas, and that the promotional and family planning activities of the Board were largely either carried out or assisted by the Ministry's staff. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MSD recommended that to streamline various activities and to optimize the utilization of staff, the Board be closed down and its functions and staff be transferred to the Ministry of Health. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure hon. Members that the closing down of the Singapore Family Planning and Population Board will not mean that family planning is no longer necessary in Singapore. The concept of a small family and family planning must inevitably remain important because of our land and water limitations. The Ministry will continue the extensive education programmes and family planning activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S. Vasoo (Bo Wen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I make some observations as regards the repeal of the Singapore Family Planning and Population Board Act. As I see it, there is no pressing reason why we should repeal the Act. The forms have changed, population dimensions have changed, and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> population activities have taken different directions. All we need to do is perhaps to reshape and redesign the activities of the Family Planning Board. However, if the Act is to be repealed, I think that there are a number of implications that the Ministry of Health will have to be aware of. These implications are important in the context of Singapore because we depend on a very small population. The population itself is reducing and there is no new growth in terms of population. As such, I feel that one should look at this whole question of population issue more critically. I wonder whether the Ministry has the expertise and the capabilities to monitor population matters and to direct activities which will in a way prevent unintended consequences to the context of our future population trend. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implication that I am concerned with is that the activities on population and family planning matters will become rather defused. There will be lack of thrust and coordination on matters related to population. Secondly, changes in the demographic trends need closer analysis and monitoring. And I am wondering whether the Ministry itself will have the expertise and the people to look at these trends closely and to interpret these trends in terms of its implications for future manpower needs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we need to have better coordinated strategies and plans to deal with the various issues of concern about our future population itself. I am wondering with the closure of the Board whether strategies and plans to deal with population matters would be effectively carried out. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we have new concerns, such as falling birth rate, singlehood, lopsided procreation and various other related matters. We need to take a fresh look at these new issues which are before us. And I feel that there should be a unit in one of the Ministries, not necessarily with the Ministry of Health, which would be able to look at this whole question critically because it has to do with issues that we will be concerned about, the future survival of our own society; and in terms of the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> kind of people that we will have for our community. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that note, I thank you, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline K. Wong (Changkat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to say a few words also. Like the Member for Bo Wen, I do not see any pressing reason why the Board should be abolished. However, I accept the reason given by the Ministry of Health, ie, the need for streamlining. I think this is in line with the Government's policy of streamlining the civil service also. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main concern is that at the moment the Board has representatives from various civic organizations, apart from Ministry officials. These include people from the unions, from the University, from schools and also from the voluntary family planning association. With the abolition of the Board, ie, following the repeal of the Act, would there still be an avenue for the members of the public to give the Government feedback on important population policies? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I want to raise with the Minister of State is that, with the repeal of the Act and therefore the abolition of the Board, and with the kind of new population concerns that we have now, does the abolition of the Board signify that the Government is going to adopt in future some very different population policies? Could he please clarify? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I really rise to seek clarification from the Minister of State. As has been pointed out, there were voluntary organizations which were involved in promoting family planning in Singapore and, if my memory serves me right, I think it was first started by the Singapore Family Planning Association. I think the international organization was also involved. This brings me to the point about the premises that are at present occupied by the Board in Dunearn Road. Again, I stand corrected - was the premises not built or put up by these voluntary organizations and which was eventually transferred to the Board for its functions which were taken over from the voluntary organizations? Now it is proposed to dissolve this Board itself and transfer all the functions to the Ministry of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Health. But what is to come of the land and the premises in Dunearn Road? Or will the Ministry of Health be conducting its activities in the field of family planning from that building? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is this. If the property was donated by voluntary organizations and the Government is taking it over, will any compensation be paid to the people who gave that building for this particular purpose? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Dixie Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Dixie Tan (Ulu Pandan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I add a few comments? I would support the Members for Bo Wen and Changkat in their remarks that the Act for the Board does not need to be repealed because family control and population control activities are now no longer needed on a big scale since the original objectives of the Board have been met. However, population control and family control does not merely mean family reduction and population reduction. It can mean other things. It can mean the mode of family control and contraception. For instance, the Board promoted oral contraceptives in a big way. At the same time, the Abortion Act was introduced. The Abortion Act has now run for about 14 years. The number of abortions has shown very sharp increases and many thinking people are very anxious about this problem. I think we need people, who have a long standing interest in the pattern of population and the way it is controlled, to monitor the numbers of abortions, the reasons for abortions and the implications on our nation - the social implications, for instance, how it will affect our thinking of life and death, and the implications of young people going for abortions rather than women in their 40s who were the original target for more abortions. These are matters of some national importance. Somebody need to look at them and who better than the Family Planning and Population Board. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, there are constantly new products in the market for contraception. We hear about injections, we hear about new hormones for both men and women. Here again, it will be good that we have a Board that can evaluate the efficacy, the dangers, the desirability to promote the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> uses of various oral contraceptives and other types of contraceptives for our population. Then in the years to come, if our birth rate continues to fall, we may well need a Family Planning and Population Board to promote births in our population, to encourage people by various means to have more children instead of less children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons I would ask the Minister to consider retention of this Board. It could be that the present infrastructure is not required and therefore it can be scaled down to whatever is necessary. The Board may be very small. It does not need, maybe, permanent staff or secretaries and so forth. Whatever is necessary can be retained and whatever is not necessary can be scrapped. But I would make a plea for this Board to be retained and for its functions to be varied according to the needs of our country. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one common question which has been asked by the various Members who have spoken is why the need to repeal, especially in view of the fact that the population procreation pattern has been changing; we are seeing a decline in the growth rate. So why not continue with the Board and let the Board address these problems. I think the key statement which I have made just now was that over the years because of the increasing complexity and the scale of the operations, much of the actual day-to-day running of the Board has been integrated with the work of the Ministry. Let me give Members some examples. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman of the Board is the Deputy Director of Medical Services in charge of Public Health. The Executive Secretary of the Board is the Director of the Maternal and Child Health Clinic. The various specialists who undertake projects for the Board are specialists from the Ministry. So, in actual fact, the day-to-day operations of the Board form part of the operations of the Ministry. The same staff who are now providing the leadership and the specialized expertise will therefore be able, despite the fact that the Board will be dissolved, to continue with their work of first monitoring the trends in population growth, analysing those trends and com- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ing out with the solutions, which is exactly what they have been doing over the past years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also formed an Inter-Ministerial Committee on Population comprising Permanent Secretaries of various Ministries. This will allow the Government to monitor on a much broader basis the population trends and to implement programs which should be better coordinated between the various Ministries, thereby making them more effective for the future. The Inter-Ministerial Committee would also be responsible for formulating policies which the Government will then review, and those policies which are accepted will then be implemented through the various Ministries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changkat has asked whether the Government is going to adopt very different population policies. The policies that we have at the present moment will be continued, and that is, we will still stress on the need for small families. However, in line with the concern about the lop-sided procreation patterns in which it has been analysed that women in the higher socio-economic group tend to have a smaller family, for example, one or two children, it is therefore necessary for such women to be encouraged to bear their share of procreation requirements of the country. The policies will be continually reviewed and they will be modified as and when necessary. But I think we all realize that population trends are long-term trends. So we do not expect policies to change rapidly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has asked about the building and the land presently occupied by the Singapore Family Planning and Population Board at Dunearn Road. The land was leased from the Government. The building was paid for by a grant from IPPF. This building was subsequently handed over to the Government when the SFPPB was formed. Therefore, under this Repeal Bill, all the assets and liabilities of the Board will be handed over to the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan has asked about the need to review new contra- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ception products and whatever other services are required. Such review will be continued, as is already being done by the Ministry's staff. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT TO A DATE TO BE FIXED</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That at its rising today, Parliament do stand adjourned to a date to be fixed.\" - [Prof. S.

The Economic Committee has made a thorough study of the matter, identified the root cause of our problems and recommended remedial actions. The Government has subsequently made several policy decisions to help the businessmen and to stimulate the economy. There has been much public debate on this issue and I do not intend to repeat the arguments on what causes the recession, who is to blame and what could have been done, etc. We cannot possibly keep on talking about recession, we have to get on with the task of overcoming the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> recession. I would therefore like to offer my views and comments on the implementation aspect of the various measures which are designed to combat recession. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central theme of the recommendations of the Economic Committee and the decisions of the Government is to lower the cost of doing business in Singapore. The primary purpose is to regain and strengthen our international competitiveness and to make Singapore a more attractive place for investment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two essential components in the cost reduction exercise. One is to reduce the wage cost. The other is to reduce all the other operating and overhead costs. Towards this end, the Government has already introduced measures to reduce the companies' operating and overhead costs by lowering various Government tariff and statutory board charges, like rental, property tax, port charges, etc. To attract investment, corporate tax reduction and a host of other incentives were also introduced. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce the wage cost, the Government has suspended the payroll tax and reduced the Skills Development Fund levies. The most drastic measure was, of course, to cut the employers' rate of CPF contribution by 15%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Wages Council (NWC) has concluded its deliberations recently. Unlike the recommendations of the previous years which gave quantitative guidelines for wage increases, this year the NWC has recommended a severe wage restraint. What the NWC has recommended, in essence, was that there should be no increase in the average national wage level for this year, and thereafter for as long as necessary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep wages down, the NWC recommended that the annual increments to employees be reduced or other components of wages such as the annual wage supplement or the incentive allowance be adjusted. In particular, employees in companies losing money must be prepared not only to forgo their annual increments but also to accept a reduction in wages. Even companies which are still profitable, but are not doing better than previous years, ought not to increase their average wage \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> costs per employee. This is to improve the rate of return on capital and to make investments in Singapore more attractive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NWC is a tripartite council. Its recommendations represent the consensus or agreement among the three parties - the employers, the unions and the Government. The trade union movement's endorsement of this recommendation reflects the unions' serious concern for the state of our economy and the increasing number of jobs lost and unemployment over the last one year. The unions are prepared to call on the workers to make short-term sacrifices to help economic recovery and to save jobs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we ask ourselves, of all the recommendations made by the Economic Committee and the NWC and of all the decisions made by the Government to reduce costs, which is the one issue that has the most profound political implication and is the most difficult to implement, I would say it is the wage restraint policy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at all the cost-cutting measures and concessions offered by the Government. Cutting rental, cutting property tax, cutting payroll tax, cutting SDF levies, cutting CPF and cutting corporate tax. All these are administrative decisions and incentives which are more than welcomed by the employers. The Government does not have to worry about carrying the ground with such decisions. The employers are happy. They will give their full support. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how about wage restraint? Will our workers be happy? Will they support such a policy? Are we in the situation where our workers are so worried and desperate that they would appreciate and support the union and the Government's call for wage restraint wholeheartedly? Or will they view this as unfair sacrifices forced upon them for the sole purpose of benefitting the employers? For companies which are losing money and facing the prospect of closing down, the workers will no doubt see the need to accept wage freeze or wage cut in order to save the company and to save their own jobs. But if the company is still staying afloat or making profit, though with reduced profits, will the workers accept wage freeze voluntarily and willingly? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the successful implementation of wage restraint policy requires the total understanding of our working populace. The policy has an economic as well as political implication. The Government and the unions have to carry the ground with such a policy. Not only are our political and union leadership put to the test but also are the mettle and determination of our citizens. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of people have expressed their views privately that perhaps the Government should not force through the wage restraint policy now. This is an unpopular policy. Why not let the event take its own course and when the situation gets worse and the workers' own jobs are threatened, they themselves will volunteer for a wage cut without being told to do so. They will then not resent the Government or the unions' call for wage restraint. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we take the approach? While the suggestion appears to make some sense, I think it is just not the style of the PAP Government, a responsible Government, to tackle problems in such a manner. This is certainly not the way NTUC and the unions respond to challenges. If we are heading for trouble, we just have to face the problem squarely, take immediate action now, unpleasant though it may be. Yes, we run the risk of losing the support of those who do not realize the seriousness of the problems or understand the justification for corrective action. But to do nothing, or to do otherwise, is to court disaster and lead our country into deep trouble and massive unemployment. The end losers will be our own workers, our own citizens. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fallacious belief that the situation today is not serious enough to warrant immediate action. Look at the dismal performance of our economy. Look at the number of workers retrenched. Look at the falling investments. The figures are telling. It calls for immediate action now. We cannot afford to wait until more companies close down and more workers are unemployed before we start to take remedial action. We cannot wait until all the foreign companies start to relocate elsewhere before we take effective \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> measures to attract investment to create jobs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our union leaders have the unenviable task of telling and convincing the workers to accept an unpleasant alternative for the time being, ie, to accept wage restraint. I do not doubt the ability of our people to accept good reasoning and explanations. I am quite confident that our workers are rational. But, of course, that is not to say that all these wage restraint policies can be implemented so smoothly without any hitch. We face some obstacles. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we have to face all the false allegations made by the opportunists and Opposition politicians who are out to discredit the Government and the unions. They will confuse the public. They will not say that all these wage restraint policies are indeed necessary to protect employment and preserve jobs. I do not expect them to say so. What they will say is that all these are just exercises to exploit workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government pursued a high wage policy, forced the wages to go up, forced the employers to contribute more to the employees' CPF accounts, all for the benefit of the workers, the Opposition parties said that the Government policies on high CPF and high wages have caused the economic downturn. They joined the employers in campaigning for lower CPF. So when the Government lowered the CPF rate and advocated wage restraint, they said that this was not fair to the workers. So what is wrong and what is right? There is simply no principle involved. The ground will be confused by such statements and allegations and we just have to keep on countering all these illogical and nonsensical arguments. And we can expect to hear more cries for unemployment benefits, as if the solution to retrenchment and unemployment is to put more people on the dole. Experience elsewhere has shown that the more attractive the unemployment benefits are, the higher the rate of unemployment will be. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have to face with some employers and management personnel who do not follow the spirit and the underlying principle of wage restraint or who fail to give adequate explanations to the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> workers. I have more to say on this later on. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there will be some workers, minority though it may be, who are reluctant to accept wage restraint because their employers are seemingly still doing well. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must stress that it is the responsibility of the management to explain and justify to the workers the need for wage restraint. Management must be prepared to share information with the workers and the unions. Whatever wage restraint policy agreed upon must be applied equitably. Management must also demonstrate that the return for wage restraint is job security and employment stability. I would like to propose the following Do's and Don'ts for the employers to consider. Altogether, there are 10 proposals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Do consult and discuss with the union before introducing wage restraint or wage freeze. Do not take unilateral action. If wage increments are embodied in the collective agreement, union's consent must be sought before implementing wage freeze. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Do share information concerning the company's financial position with the employees and the union. This will help to convince the union leaders who will in turn be better equipped to explain and convince the workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Do not abdicate the responsibility to explain to the employees the reasons for wage restraint. Do not tell the workers, \"I do not mind paying some increments, but the NWC and Government say no.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Do not pass the buck to the union. When confronted by any workers, do not take the easy way out by saying, \"Your union has agreed to the wage cut. Ask your union.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Do not attempt to undermine the position and strength of the union. Employers who think that this is the time to weaken the union and take the opportunity to prove to the workers that the union is indeed useless is committing a grave mistake. You may be successful in undermining the confidence of the workers in the present union leadership. But, in fact, you may be helping in the removal of a responsible union leadership and instal- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ling in its place a group of more militant union leaders. The most precious commodity or rather one of the most precious ingredients contributing to our success in attracting investment and maintaining employment stability has been the absence of industrial strife. So, I say, do not destroy our industrial peace and harmony. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Do apply the principle of equal sacrifice. Do not freeze the wages of bargainable workers but at the same time give increments, bonuses and other fringe benefits to the management staff. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Do not take hasty decision to retrench workers. Workers make sacrifices because they think that will help the company to survive and help to preserve their jobs. So do not make the workers feel that they have been taken for a ride for agreeing to a wage freeze. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Do make good use of the savings resulted from the CPF cut and wage restraint. Invest in new machines, upgrade operations, and improve productivity. The job security of the workers hinges on the viability of the companies they work for. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Do not let up in the training of the workers. Do not discontinue the basic education and other skill training and upgrading programmes just because business has slackened. Make full use of the dull period to train the workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Do share the fruits of success with the workers when good time returns. Devise a suitable productivity incentive and profit sharing scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Acting Minister for Trade and Industry has taken down all my suggestions and observations and convey them to the employers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some suggestions for the Government too. I have five proposals to make to the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Keep a close eye on the state of industrial relations and ensure that fair play, good sense and reasonableness prevail. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Check against companies taking advantage of the situation by - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Goh, you have come to the end of your teaching lesson! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Acting Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Acting Minister for Trade and Industry (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Member for Boon Lay on how wage restraint ought to be implemented and carried out over the next couple of years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wage restraint is, in fact, one of the most important measures in the entire package of measures taken to restore our competitiveness. It is also the most difficult to carry out. It is the most important one because if we do not get it right, then everything else which we have done can be eroded away and undone. We have cut back on CPF contribution on the employer's side; we have cut back corporate taxes; we have reduced costs all round. If we are not careful about wage costs in these couple of years, then wage costs may continue to increase, and very soon we will be back into a position where we are uncompetitive again. And then we will no longer be able to cut our CPF further, and we will no longer be able to bring our corporate tax rates down very much more. Therefore, it is absolutely crucial for us to hold our wage levels at a reasonable standstill in order that all our other measures are not nullified. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the most difficult measure to implement. As the Member for Boon Lay has pointed out, other measures can be imposed by fiat, at a stroke of the pen. Wage restraint requires cooperation, good sense, understanding, comprehension, all round amongst a large number of workers, a large number of employers, union leaders, political leaders. So it is much harder to develop this consensus, this understanding, and make it work. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, our progress has been good. We have come quite a long way since the Economic Committee published its report. The Government has accepted the Economic Committee's recommendations, and now the NWC, having debated the issue, has endorsed the recommendations substantially. It has come up with a statement this year explaining in practical, concrete, unambiguous terms, what wage restraint means for different types of companies and for different groups of people. But it is not just the NWC which has been hard at work; so have the unions been, so have \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the employers been. I have spoken to employer groups organized by SNEF; I have spoken to union groups organized by NTUC - closed-door, frank sessions. They understand the problem, and I think they also support the policies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have made substantial progress, but we are not through yet. We are not through yet because wage restraint is not just a one-time action but it is a continuing matter, continuing for the rest of this year and if the recession is not over by next year, which is likely, into next year as well. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Boon Lay very systematically identified 10 Do's and Don'ts for employers. I have not taken them down, but I have taken note of them. And those which make sense, I have conveyed to the employers. Most of them do. Therefore, to balance the picture, I should point out that it is not just employers who have an important role to play but also union leaders, because the union leaders are the grassroots activists, the grassroots opinion formers, whose views, whose persuasive powers, will set the responses of the unionists, of the members, and indeed of the non-unionized workforce in the population. They look to these grassroots leaders for support, for guidance, for an indication of what is good for the population. The leaders have trust. They have established themselves. They have now got to use whatever authority they have to lead their flock in a direction which they know is good for their own people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So union leaders must convince themselves, first, that the policy is a wise one, that it is good for the population and, secondly, that there is no other choice, that this is the way for us to create jobs, to develop opportunities, to bring in new investments, in new growth areas. And then, having convinced themselves, they can bring their ground along with them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had some visitors recently from Britain, visitors from a country which has spent many years grappling, not very successfully, with precisely the same problem - how to moderate expectations of a population in an economy which is not growing very rapidly, how to persuade people that wages have to be held down because out- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> put is not going up. And they asked me, \"How did you manage it - ask people to accept a standstill in wages and a cut in their savings, instead of improving your competitiveness in other ways by manipulating the value of your currency?\" In other words, \"Why did you ask for a wage standstill, instead of a currency devaluation?\" My answer to them was, \"That is not the choice before us.\" Whatever we do, our standard of living is not going up. In fact, it may even come down. The question is: do we do it in an orderly, well-conceived fashion, by trimming our costs and holding our wages down? Or do we allow it to be imposed upon us by unemployment, leading to balance of payment problems, leading to a devaluation of the Singapore dollar, leading to inflation which will erode the value of workers' take-home pay? If there is no output, then there can be no higher pay. Whether the pay becomes lower because we save less in the CPF, or whether the pay becomes lower because every dollar we have is worth less (and the Singapore dollar has gone into a tailspin), the final result will be the same, namely, we are not as well off. And yet it is not the same, because in the first case we have determined our destiny, and we have got it right. In the second case, it will be done to us, and we will have to suffer many \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> other grievous consequences. That is the choice, and that is the choice which we must understand and which we must get our workers to understand that this is the only way. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures are now in place. Let us implement them with good sense. We are looking for a wage standstill; we have not set a wage freeze. Adjustments will be necessary - corrections where there are difficulties in particular sectors of the labour market, corrections where there are particular individual professions which are in very short supply. These have to be accommodated with good sense and goodwill, and without damage to our overall objective of keeping our wages at a standstill. Let us have this good sense, let us have this determination - make our wage restraint policy work, and let us all work for recovery of the economy together.
