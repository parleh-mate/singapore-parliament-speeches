Only after\r\n\r\nthis  is  done  can  both Governments jointly  refer  the\r\n\r\ndispute  to the International Court of Justice.  On  17th\r\n\r\nFebruary,  we informed Malaysia that Singapore Government\r\n\r\nhas  ratified the Special Agreement and we proposed  that\r\n\r\nboth Governments exchange the Instruments of Ratification\r\n\r\non  24th February 2003 when both Foreign Ministers  would\r\n\r\nbe  in  Kuala  Lumpur for the Non-Aligned  Meeting.   The\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Government  replied on 19th  February  stating\r\n\r\nthat because of heavy commitments that month arising from\r\n\r\ntheir  hosting of the NAM Summit in KL, it was unable  to\r\n\r\ndo  so on that date but would propose a new date for  the\r\n\r\nexchange of Instruments of Ratification in due course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is where things stand and we have, on 11th\r\n\r\nApril,  reminded  them again to propose  dates  for  this\r\n\r\nformality of exchange of Instruments of Ratification.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> Sir, does the Minister\r\n\r\nfind it surprising that the Malaysians, who were hurrying\r\n\r\nus  on the date for signing the Special Agreement earlier\r\n\r\non, are now dragging their feet on the essential issue of\r\n\r\ninstruments of ratification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Well, in a sense, it is\r\n\r\nsurprising.

More than eight\r\n\r\nweeks  have  passed since the hosting of the  Non-Aligned\r\n\r\nSummit,  and Dr Ong is right that Malaysia has criticised\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  delaying  the  signing  of  the   Special\r\n\r\nAgreement.

Privatisation converts  the  HDB\r\n\r\nleases  into strata titles under the Land Titles (Strata)\r\n\r\nAct  (LTSA).  This changes the status of these flats from\r\n\r\npublic  to  private  housing.  With  privatisation,  flat\r\n\r\nowners will no longer be subject to HDB's restrictions on\r\n\r\nthe  use, ownership and resale of their flats.  They  can\r\n\r\nsublet  their flat wholly, purchase HDB resale flats  and\r\n\r\nsell  their  flats to a wider group of potential  buyers.\r\n\r\nFlat  owners  will own the common property as tenants-in-common and have the autonomy to manage and upgrade  their\r\n\r\nestate, according to their needs and aspirations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The privatisation of the former Bedok Reservoir HUDC\r\n\r\nEstate  was carried out in accordance with the provisions\r\n\r\nof  the  Land  Titles (Strata) Act (LTSA).  The  relevant\r\n\r\nprovisions of the LTSA allow for such a conversion if, at\r\n\r\nleast 75% of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlessees of the total number of flats apply to do so,  and\r\n\r\nthe proprietor of the land agrees to transfer the land to\r\n\r\nthem.   Privatisation is therefore  the  choice  of  flat\r\n\r\nowners.   HDB cannot and does not compel the flat  owners\r\n\r\nto privatise their estates unless the majority wish to do\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has explained its position with regard to the\r\n\r\nprivatisation process in its letters of 30th  April  2002\r\n\r\nand 5th October 2002 to Waterfront View residents, and in\r\n\r\na letter published in the Forum Page of The Straits Times\r\n\r\non  11th  May 2002.  The application to convert  the  HDB\r\n\r\nflat  leases  to  strata titles was submitted  under  the\r\n\r\nrelevant   provisions  of  the  LTSA  and  the  documents\r\n\r\n(including the written consents signed by more  than  75%\r\n\r\nof  the  lessees  of  the Estate) were  lodged  with  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Land Authority (SLA) on 3rd December 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The written consents of the lessees were signed over\r\n\r\na period of time prior to the submission of the documents\r\n\r\nto SLA. There is no requirement in the LTSA that the 75%\r\n\r\nmandate must be obtained in a single day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 6th December 2001, the SLA posted a notice in The\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  and Lianhe Zaobao providing  for  written\r\n\r\nobjections  to  privatisation to  be  lodged  within  six\r\n\r\nweeks.   It  also sent a copy of the notice by registered\r\n\r\npost  to  all the individual flat owners on 10th December\r\n\r\n2001.   No  objections were received.  As the application\r\n\r\nwas in order, the SLA registered the Strata Title Plan on\r\n\r\n1st  February 2002, ie, the estate was privatised on  1st\r\n\r\nFebruary  2002.  The certificate of constitution  of  the\r\n\r\nManagement Corporation Strata Title (MCST) Plan No.  2625\r\n\r\nwas issued by SLA on 2nd February 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that only a small proportion of the\r\n\r\nresidents  of  Waterfront View  were  not  in  favour  of\r\n\r\nprivatisation.   These residents should accept  that  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the  residents  had  wanted  privatisation.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  some of these residents  have  taken  the\r\n\r\nmatter to court and have sued some members of the Pro-tem\r\n\r\nCommittee\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n(\"PC\") and the law firm that had been selected by the  PC\r\n\r\nto  assist  them.   The  Court will  determine  if  those\r\n\r\nresidents who have sued have a genuine case.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Role of the Pro-tem Committee</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB had, pursuant to its procedure for\r\n\r\nprivatisation,  encouraged the residents  of  the  former\r\n\r\nBedok  Reservoir HUDC Estate to form a Pro-tem  Committee\r\n\r\n(PC) with the help of the Member of Parliament.  This was\r\n\r\ndone  in 1996 by the MP of the area at that time, Mr Chew\r\n\r\nHeng Ching, under the auspices of the relevant grassroots\r\n\r\norganisation.  The  members of the PC  were  subsequently\r\n\r\nendorsed  in  1997  by  the Kampong  Kembangan  Community\r\n\r\nCentre  Secretariat and by the new MP for  the  area,  BG\r\n\r\nGeorge Yeo.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of the PC was to facilitate the process of\r\n\r\nprivatisation. The members of the PC were all  volunteers\r\n\r\nwho  worked  as  the liaison between the  residents,  the\r\n\r\nlawyers  selected by the PC to conduct the  privatisation\r\n\r\nprocess,  HDB  and  the  other  relevant  authorities  on\r\n\r\nprivatisation matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the PC had kept the residents\r\n\r\nfully  informed  throughout the  privatisation  exercise.\r\n\r\nFrom  October  1996  to  April 2002,  the  PC  issued  16\r\n\r\nnewsletters  to  the  residents,  updating  them  on  the\r\n\r\nvarious  issues of privatisation, such as the  conversion\r\n\r\ncost,  progress of the various works carried out  in  the\r\n\r\nestate  and inviting more volunteers to serve in the  PC.\r\n\r\nThey consulted the residents on the fencing and re-naming\r\n\r\nof the estate after privatisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PC acted according to HDB's guidelines, and has,\r\n\r\nin  HDB's view, discharged its roles diligently and acted\r\n\r\nbona fide in the interest of the residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Alleged defects in the estate</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not true that there are widespread defects\r\n\r\nexisting in Waterfront View which would cost $20  million\r\n\r\nto  rectify.  HDB has, consequent to receiving  a  survey\r\n\r\nreport commissioned by the MCST and which purports to set\r\n\r\nout the extent of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalleged  defects, made a preliminary assessment of  these\r\n\r\ndefects.   HDB  has discovered that these \"defects\"  were\r\n\r\ngenerally  due  to  fair  wear  and  tear.  This  is  not\r\n\r\nsurprising,  given that the former Bedok  Reservoir  HUDC\r\n\r\nestate  was built more than 18 years ago.  In  any  case,\r\n\r\nthe  rectification cost of $20 million for these wear and\r\n\r\ntear items is greatly exaggerated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB structural engineers inspected the blocks in the\r\n\r\nestate  in  April/May 1997 and again in April 2001.   The\r\n\r\nbuildings  were  found  to  be  structurally  sound.  The\r\n\r\ncompetent  authorities,  namely,  the  Fire  Safety   and\r\n\r\nShelter   Bureau   and  the  Building  and   Construction\r\n\r\nAuthority,  have  issued the Fire Safety Certificate  (on\r\n\r\n21st  January  2003)  and the Certificates  of  Statutory\r\n\r\nCompletion (on 7th March and 13th March 2003) accordingly\r\n\r\nfor the estate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to privatisation, the estate maintenance works\r\n\r\nwere  undertaken  by  the  Aljunied  Town  Council.  With\r\n\r\nprivatisation,  the  MCST has taken over  the  unexpended\r\n\r\nfunds  of  more  than $1 million from the  Town  Council,\r\n\r\nbeing  an  accrual of the monthly service and conservancy\r\n\r\ncharges  the  flat owners had paid to the  Town  Council.\r\n\r\nThis  is  one of the highest amongst all the HUDC estates\r\n\r\nprivatised so far.  The MCST has the autonomy  to  decide\r\n\r\non  the  types of repair and improvement works,  and  the\r\n\r\namount  of  maintenance  fees to be  collected  from  the\r\n\r\nresidents.  It follows that the rectification of  defects\r\n\r\nis largely the responsibility of the MCST.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude by reiterating three points with\r\n\r\nregard to the privatisation of the former Bedok Reservoir\r\n\r\nHUDC Estate.  Firstly, the privatisation was carried  out\r\n\r\nin  accordance with the procedures set out in  the  LTSA.\r\n\r\nSince   1st  February  2002,  the  estate  is  a  private\r\n\r\ncondominium  under the ambit of the LTSA.  Secondly,  the\r\n\r\nPC  acted  according to HDB's guidelines on  HUDC  estate\r\n\r\nprivatisation.   It  has, in HDB's view,  discharged  its\r\n\r\nduties diligently and acted bona fide in the interest  of\r\n\r\nresidents. Lastly, the $20 million cost of rectifying\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  said \"defects\" in the estate is greatly exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe   blocks   in  the  estate  were  certified   to   be\r\n\r\nstructurally sound during HDB's inspections in  April/May\r\n\r\n1997   and  in  April  2001.   With  privatisation,   the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and  management  of  the  estate   are   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility   of   the  MCST.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Two supplementary questions, Sir. Some\r\n\r\nresidents are concerned that their apartment values  have\r\n\r\ndropped because of the bad publicity.  Would the Minister\r\n\r\nagree  to goodwill repairs of some of the defects?  After\r\n\r\nall,  in  response to repeated requests by BG George  Yeo\r\n\r\nand  the Pro-tem Committee before privatisation, HDB  did\r\n\r\nagree to carry out goodwill repairs at the end of 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second question: after privatisation, some residents\r\n\r\nhave  been  led to believe that under the HUDC  Act,  the\r\n\r\nresidents of Waterfront View should have been required to\r\n\r\npay   only   $1,  instead  of  about  $20,000   for   the\r\n\r\nprivatisation.  Can the Minister clarify this, please?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, it is correct that HDB had,\r\n\r\narising from some strong representations made by  the  MP\r\n\r\nfor the area, BG George Yeo, as well as the PC - this was\r\n\r\nsometime  in  March and April 2002 - to  carry  out  some\r\n\r\ngoodwill  repairs to the aprons at some of the blocks  in\r\n\r\nhis estate.  This was, notwithstanding the fact that,  as\r\n\r\nI  said  earlier, the maintenance and the upkeep  of  the\r\n\r\ncommon areas and the aprons were under the responsibility\r\n\r\nof  the MCST by then.  However, with the commencement  of\r\n\r\nthe  law  suit  by  some residents on  the  privatisation\r\n\r\nprocess,  it is best for HDB to wait for the  outcome  of\r\n\r\nthe  law  suit  before  taking any further  action.   Any\r\n\r\ngoodwill  repairs would, of course, have to be considered\r\n\r\nin  the  light of the recent complaint of defects by  the\r\n\r\nMCST.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the MP's second query about the payment of\r\n\r\nthe  conversion fee, whether it should be $1 or more, let\r\n\r\nme clarify that there are two kinds of HUDC estates.  The\r\n\r\nfirst type of HUDC estates are the estates\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  were  built under Phase 1 and Phase 2 of  the  HUDC\r\n\r\nprogramme.   The  second type would  be  under  the  next\r\n\r\nphases,  Phases  3 and 4.  The HUDC Housing  Estates  Act\r\n\r\napplies  to flats in HUDC Phases 1 and 2 estates.   These\r\n\r\nestates  were built and sold in the 1970s by  the  former\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Urban  Development Company  (HUDC)  Private\r\n\r\nLimited.  Under this Act, the flat lessees own the common\r\n\r\nproperty as tenants-in-common.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waterfront View is one of the HUDC Phases 3 and 4\r\n\r\nestates,  and these estates were sold by HDB in the  mid-1980s  under  Part IV of the Housing and Development  Act\r\n\r\n(or  H&D  Act), which is different from the HUDC  Housing\r\n\r\nEstates Act.  The HUDC Housing Estates Act does not apply\r\n\r\nto Waterfront View.  The residents of Waterfront View did\r\n\r\nnot own the common property before privatisation.  So, as\r\n\r\npart  of  the privatisation exercise, the residents  have\r\n\r\npurchased the common property from HDB and they  now  own\r\n\r\nit  as  tenants-in-common.  The cost of this transfer  of\r\n\r\ncommon  property at Waterfront View is not at the nominal\r\n\r\nsum of $1, as provided in the HUDC Act.

When  there  is  a\r\n\r\ntrainee  officer  undergoing training to  qualify  as  an\r\n\r\nOfficer-of-the-Watch, the trainee officer may direct  the\r\n\r\nship's  movement  under  the  direct  supervision  of   a\r\n\r\nqualified   Officer-of-the-Watch   who   always   remains\r\n\r\nresponsible for the safety of the ship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will appreciate that naval officers have to\r\n\r\nbe trained not just in classroom-based lessons and theory\r\n\r\nbut  also  in  the practical application of  the  various\r\n\r\nskills  required  of  a  naval  officer.   This  includes\r\n\r\nwatchkeeping skills at sea.  The training system includes\r\n\r\nregular written assessments to ensure currency on  bridge\r\n\r\nwatchkeeping as well as many practical sessions  on  ship\r\n\r\nhandling  simulators.   A key part of  the  qualification\r\n\r\nprocess involves practical training at sea, during  which\r\n\r\nthe trainee Officer-of-the-Watch is allowed to handle the\r\n\r\nship  under close supervision.  This is necessary so that\r\n\r\nour  young  officers  are  trained  and  qualified  under\r\n\r\nrealistic  operating conditions and  learn  to  make  the\r\n\r\njudgements  and  decisions that are  necessary.   At  all\r\n\r\ntimes,  the trainee is under the close supervision  of  a\r\n\r\nqualified  Officer-of-the-Watch, and it is the  qualified\r\n\r\nOfficer-of-the-Watch who is always fully responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe safety of the ship during his watch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of maritime regulations, RSN Officers-of-the-Watch have to study the International Regulations\r\n\r\nfor  Prevention of Collisions at Sea, and they are tested\r\n\r\non  these  international regulations  every  six  months.\r\n\r\nThorough knowledge of these International Regulations for\r\n\r\nPrevention  of Collisions at Sea is an important  feature\r\n\r\nof the training syllabus which qualifies RSN Officers-of-the-Watch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RSN ships have to comply with the International\r\n\r\nRegulations  for Prevention of Collisions at Sea,  except\r\n\r\nwhen  operational circumstances do not permit compliance.\r\n\r\nRSN officers know that if there should be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nan   operational  requirement  to  deviate   from   these\r\n\r\ncollision  regulations, the ship must  do  so  with  full\r\n\r\nregard  for  safety.   Any deviation from  the  collision\r\n\r\nregulations  must  not  compromise safety  or  jeopardise\r\n\r\nother shipping.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be various operational conditions\r\n\r\nrequiring  a  deviation  from the collision  regulations,\r\n\r\ndepending  on  the mission and the operating environment.\r\n\r\nAn  example  would be when an RSN ship has to respond  to\r\n\r\nviolations  of our territorial integrity or  pre-position\r\n\r\nherself in a situation which may require such a response.\r\n\r\nMilitary  operations often do not proceed in a  regulated\r\n\r\nor predictable way, and it is important that RSN officers\r\n\r\nare  fully and comprehensively trained so that  they  can\r\n\r\ncarry   out   their  missions  effectively  in   whatever\r\n\r\ncircumstances they may find themselves in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE INSTITUTE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Breach of ethical standards by bio-medical researchers)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mdm Halimah Yacob</b> asked the Minister for Health\r\n\r\n(a) how such a serious breach of ethical standards in the\r\n\r\nconduct  of  medical research on human  subjects  at  the\r\n\r\nNational  Neuroscience Institute could have  taken  place\r\n\r\nand  remained undetected for so long; (b) what safeguards\r\n\r\nwill  be  instituted to prevent such breaches and  better\r\n\r\nprotect   patients   from  unauthorised   medical   tests\r\n\r\nundertaken by bio-medical researchers as well  as  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  medical records are not released for purposes other\r\n\r\nthan the treatment of patients without their consent  and\r\n\r\nwhether  these  safeguards can be made public;  (c)  what\r\n\r\nsteps  will be taken to educate patients of their  rights\r\n\r\nso  that  they  too  can better protect  themselves  when\r\n\r\nconfronted  with  such situations; and (d)  what  control\r\n\r\nmechanism  is in place to prevent the use of questionable\r\n\r\nresearch   methods  on  human  subjects  for  bio-medical\r\n\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> The\r\n\r\nconduct of research on human subjects in Singapore has to\r\n\r\nbe  carried  out  in  accordance  with  rules  which  are\r\n\r\ninternationally accepted and which are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbased  on  the Helsinki Declaration.  Under these  rules,\r\n\r\nthe  welfare  of  the human subjects is paramount.    The\r\n\r\nresearch  procedure must also be approved by  independent\r\n\r\nEthics Committees of Hospitals from where the research is\r\n\r\nto be conducted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the NNI project, investigations show that Prof\r\n\r\nShorvon  and his assistant, Dr Ramachandran (who was  the\r\n\r\nProject Manager), deliberately subverted the rules.  They\r\n\r\ndid  not  tell the Hospital Ethics Committees  the  exact\r\n\r\ntests  that  were  going  to be conducted  on  the  human\r\n\r\nsubjects.    They  misled  the  Ethics  Committees   into\r\n\r\nthinking that they were only going to extract blood.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  they  carried out other tests which had  not  been\r\n\r\napproved.   These  tests were not conducted  with  proper\r\n\r\nsafeguards and exposed the human subjects to unacceptable\r\n\r\nrisks.   The  two  doctors also did not  tell  the  human\r\n\r\nsubjects  the whole truth about the tests.  There  was  a\r\n\r\nclear  and  deliberate breach of the Helsinki Declaration\r\n\r\nand our own national guidelines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unapproved testing started in May 2002. Most of\r\n\r\nthe  human  subjects were, however, tested in the  period\r\n\r\nNovember   to  December  2002.   By  January  2003,   the\r\n\r\nunethical  actions  came to light  and  the  project  was\r\n\r\nsuspended.   There was thus a period  of  about  5  to  6\r\n\r\nmonths where the unapproved testing was carried out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such conduct is serious and unacceptable. We will\r\n\r\nnot tolerate this.  Research is important.  But it has to\r\n\r\nbe  carried out ethically.  That has to be the foundation\r\n\r\non which we build our biomedical research capability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing seriously deficient about the\r\n\r\nsystems  and  procedures that we had put in  place.   The\r\n\r\nproblem  was  that we had two doctors in the project  who\r\n\r\nvery deliberately circumvented the rules.  It is not easy\r\n\r\nto  legislate against such conduct.  Everyday research is\r\n\r\nbeing  carried  out ethically.  Most people  are  honest.\r\n\r\nDrs  Shorvon  and Ramachandran are the exception.   Their\r\n\r\nconduct was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexposed   when  the  human  subjects  and  their  doctors\r\n\r\ncomplained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to look carefully at what we can do. To\r\n\r\nprevent any errant researcher from attempting to beat the\r\n\r\nsystem  by seeking out loopholes, we will look at how  we\r\n\r\ncan   further  strengthen  the  existing  systems.    The\r\n\r\nMinistry  appointed a Committee of Inquiry to  look  into\r\n\r\nthe system and procedures relating to the ethics approval\r\n\r\nand conduct of the study in question.  The Committee made\r\n\r\nseveral recommendations to strengthen the ethics approval\r\n\r\nprocess  in  hospitals for clinical research, ensure  the\r\n\r\nmedical   confidentiality  of  patient   information   in\r\n\r\nhospitals,  and improve the standards for the conduct  of\r\n\r\nclinical research.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will study the NNI Panel's report as\r\n\r\nwell  as  its Committee of Inquiry's Report, and will  do\r\n\r\nwhat  is  necessary to strengthen the components  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting research oversight system.  The hospital  ethics\r\n\r\ncommittees  and  research  monitoring  process  would  be\r\n\r\nstrengthened,  so that any deviations from  the  approved\r\n\r\nstated protocols are detected and remedied early.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we do not want to put in so many rules to\r\n\r\ncounter  dishonesty  that we end up  seriously  affecting\r\n\r\nhonest  researchers.  Experience shows  that  such  rules\r\n\r\nwill  not always deter dishonesty anyway.  What is really\r\n\r\nneeded,   in  addition  to  strengthening  the   existing\r\n\r\nsystems, is strong leadership in the various institutions\r\n\r\nthat  deal with research, and a strong culture of ethics.\r\n\r\nThere  has to be strong leadership with a deft touch,  so\r\n\r\nthat  the freedom to do proper research is not curbed  by\r\n\r\nbureaucracy  while, at the same time, errant  researchers\r\n\r\nare pulled up quickly.  We will look into this seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will also look into the education of\r\n\r\npatients  and  the  general public about  their  role  in\r\n\r\nmedical research.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Could the Minister\r\n\r\ncomment whether the patients\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunder  the unethical medical research suffered  any  side\r\n\r\neffects  or long-term effects as a result of unacceptable\r\n\r\nwithdrawal of their long-term medication?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I said, the tests that were\r\n\r\nconducted on the patients were done without the knowledge\r\n\r\nof their supervising doctors.

Schools  have\r\n\r\nguidelines   for   handling  school  discipline.    These\r\n\r\nguidelines  have been useful in helping schools  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith bullying.  Where necessary, schools may also consult\r\n\r\nGuidance Specialists in the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To part (c), every school has a counselling system\r\n\r\nin  place to help both pupils who are bullied and  others\r\n\r\nwith  discipline or behavioural problems.   Teachers  are\r\n\r\ntrained in basic counselling skills, and are able to help\r\n\r\nboth the bully and the bullied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On part (d), there are also two Teacher Counsellors\r\n\r\nin  each school to guide the more difficult pupils.   The\r\n\r\nTeacher   Counsellors  are  trained  in   more   advanced\r\n\r\ncounselling skills and crisis intervention.  In 2001, the\r\n\r\nSchool   Counsellor  Scheme  was  introduced  to  further\r\n\r\naugment the counselling resources in the schools.   Under\r\n\r\nthis  scheme, education officers who have retired or left\r\n\r\nthe  service are specially selected, trained and deployed\r\n\r\nto  schools  to  work  with the Teacher  Counsellors  and\r\n\r\nteachers.  There are currently 50 such School Counsellors\r\n\r\nwho  have  been trained or are undergoing training.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry   of   Education   also   works   closely   with\r\n\r\nprofessional   agencies  and  self-help   groups,   where\r\n\r\nnecessary, to deal with incidences of bullying as well as\r\n\r\nother incidences of behavioural problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> May I know\r\n\r\nwhether  boxing is one of the recognised  sports  in  our\r\n\r\nschools?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, I do not see the relevance of\r\n\r\nthat  question.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, staircases are escape routes during\r\n\r\nfires.   Hence,  they  have to be  adequately  protected.\r\n\r\nAlthough multi-storey carparks are usually designed  with\r\n\r\nopen-sided walls that allow good ventilation,  this  does\r\n\r\nnot  preclude  the possibility of smoke,  heat  and  fire\r\n\r\npenetrating the stairwell, thus hindering safe evacuation\r\n\r\nof people.  This is especially so if the fire occurs near\r\n\r\nthe  staircase.  Therefore, as long as the  staircase  is\r\n\r\nlocated  within  the multi-storey carpark  building,  the\r\n\r\nstairwell  will  have to be isolated and  its  walls  and\r\n\r\ndoors  will  have to be fire-resistant.  The  doors  also\r\n\r\nhave  to  be fitted with self-closing devices  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat the door is kept closed all the time to isolate  and\r\n\r\nprotect the stairwell.  This ensures that there is a safe\r\n\r\nroute  of  evacuation for people caught in a  fire  in  a\r\n\r\nmulti-storey car park.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot assume that fires will not occur at\r\n\r\nmulti-storey car parks or that people will not be  caught\r\n\r\nin them.

Despite  extensive\r\n\r\ndamage  to  several cars which caught fire, the staircase\r\n\r\nenclosures  in  this  case were unscathed  by  the  fire,\r\n\r\ndemonstrating the importance of fire resistant  doors  in\r\n\r\nensuring  a  safe  evacuation route for  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COOKED FOOD HAWKER STALLS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Vacancy and allocation)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  (a) how many hawker stalls for  cooked  food\r\n\r\nare  vacant  and where are these stalls, and (b)  whether\r\n\r\nhis  Ministry will review the allocation of these  hawker\r\n\r\nstalls which has been suspended for many years in view of\r\n\r\nthe severe structural unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Sir, we have 6,990 cooked food stalls in 135 hawker\r\n\r\ncentres.   However, the number of vacant stalls  is  very\r\n\r\nsmall,  only 46 in total.  After setting aside 21 of  the\r\n\r\nstalls  for  temporary use by hawkers  under  the  Hawker\r\n\r\nCentre  Upgrading Programme (HUP), the number  of  vacant\r\n\r\nstalls available for allocation is only 25.  These stalls\r\n\r\nare  put  up for tenders on a monthly basis.  The  tender\r\n\r\nfor this month has just closed on 17th April 2003 and the\r\n\r\nnext tender will be on 6th May 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Wang asked whether we would review the\r\n\r\nallocation  of stalls in view of structural unemployment.\r\n\r\nI  presume  he  is referring to the direct allocation  of\r\n\r\nstalls for hardship cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the scheme was discontinued in 1990, about 13\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  because, on the supply side, we had  stopped\r\n\r\nbuilding  hawker centres since 1985.  There is  therefore\r\n\r\nno  more new supply of vacant cooked food stalls built by\r\n\r\nENV  or HDB.  At the same time, on the demand side,  many\r\n\r\nof  the hardship cases then were not prepared to take  up\r\n\r\nvacant stalls as and when these stalls became available\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecause  they  prefer  to wait for  stalls  in  the  more\r\n\r\npopular centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the supply and demand situations, the\r\n\r\nscheme was discontinued and interested stallholders  have\r\n\r\nto  tender  for stalls as and when they become available.\r\n\r\nIn  the  past three years, we have allocated  240  cooked\r\n\r\nfood  stalls  through public tender.   On  average,  each\r\n\r\nstall attracted about 15 applications.  On the whole, the\r\n\r\ntender  scheme  has  worked  well  under  a  market-based\r\n\r\nmechanism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even though we have no plans to re-introduce\r\n\r\nthe  direct allocation of stalls for hardship  cases,  we\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  create  opportunities  for  potential\r\n\r\nstallholders.  Under the HUP, we are offering cash  grant\r\n\r\nto  enable  some of the first generation stallholders  to\r\n\r\nretire.    This  will  help  free  up  more  stalls   for\r\n\r\nnewcomers,  including the hardship cases.  So far,  about\r\n\r\n16%  of stallholders have opted for cash grants under the\r\n\r\nHUP.   One example is Dunman Food Centre where six stalls\r\n\r\nvacated by retiring stallholders had been tendered out so\r\n\r\nfar,  with  another 10 more stalls up for tender  in  the\r\n\r\nnext tendering exercise.  If this trend continues, we can\r\n\r\nexpect  that  a steady stream of stalls will continue  to\r\n\r\nbecome available for tenders under the HUP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BUILDING OF MOSQUE AT SENGKANG</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Ahmad\r\n\r\nMohd Magad -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.

My Ministry has  therefore\r\n\r\ndrawn  up  a  comprehensive set  of   Standard  Operating\r\n\r\nProcedures  in consultation with the Ministry  of  Health\r\n\r\nand  the major child care operators.  All 630 child  care\r\n\r\ncentre  operators  were briefed on the procedures  before\r\n\r\nthe centres re-opened on 16th April 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of our procedures can be found at the\r\n\r\nMCDS         websites         www.mcds.gov.sg         and\r\n\r\nwww.childcarelink.gov.sg.  Allow me just to  highlight  a\r\n\r\nfew  key  points, Sir.  Parents are reminded not to  send\r\n\r\ntheir children to the centres if their children are  ill.\r\n\r\nBesides  the health declaration forms, parents have  been\r\n\r\nissued   with  advisories  to  monitor  their  children's\r\n\r\ntemperature and health every morning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear procedures have been drawn up to handle\r\n\r\nchildren or staff who fall sick while in the centre.   We\r\n\r\nwill  close  the centres for 10 days if sick children  or\r\n\r\nstaff  are  found  to  be  suspected  or  probable   SARS\r\n\r\npatients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have advised student care operators, who provide\r\n\r\nbefore  and after school care services for primary school\r\n\r\nchildren, to use the same procedures as we have for child-care  centres.   The  People's  Association,  which  runs\r\n\r\nplaygroups   and   tuition  classes,  has   adopted   the\r\n\r\nprocedures  as well.  As I have mentioned, my  Ministry's\r\n\r\nprocedures for child-care operators are available on  our\r\n\r\nwebsite for any pre-school service providers to use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides procedures, MCDS has also developed a series\r\n\r\nof  public  communication programmes  targeted  at  young\r\n\r\nchildren,   parents  and  caregivers.  Public   education\r\n\r\nmessages  were  carried  in the  four  languages  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious media.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nYoung  children  are taught, in a fun  way,  about  basic\r\n\r\nhygiene.

For young children,  the  precautionary\r\n\r\nmeasures can only be effective if parents act responsibly\r\n\r\nand  not  allow their sick children to turn up in  child-care centres or schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FOREIGN WORKERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Preventive measures on spread of SARS)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mdm Halimah Yacob</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nManpower in view of the highly contagious nature  of  the\r\n\r\nSARS  virus  and bearing in mind the language  and  other\r\n\r\ndifficulties  faced by foreign workers and  their  living\r\n\r\nconditions, some of which may not have proper  sanitation\r\n\r\nfacilities  (a)  what measures are being taken  including\r\n\r\nscreening and education programmes to prevent the  spread\r\n\r\nof  SARS among foreign workers who are already working in\r\n\r\nSingapore;  (b) will the intake of foreign  workers  from\r\n\r\nSARS-affected areas be tightened; and (c) if there is  an\r\n\r\noutbreak of SARS among foreign workers what measures  are\r\n\r\nin place to contain the spread of the disease.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  my  Ministry  has  adopted  a  2-pronged\r\n\r\nstrategy  to  deal with the outbreak of SARS amongst  the\r\n\r\nforeign worker population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first approach is to minimise the risk of\r\n\r\ninfection  by  raising  awareness  within  the   existing\r\n\r\nforeign worker population in Singapore.  My Ministry  has\r\n\r\nbeen  working  with  the Ministry of  Health  to  prepare\r\n\r\ncustomised advisories to employers of foreign workers and\r\n\r\nto  the foreign workers themselves, including the foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic workers.

Both  employers\r\n\r\nand   employees,   whether  they  are   Singaporeans   or\r\n\r\nforeigners,  must take proactive steps  to  minimise  the\r\n\r\nchances of an outbreak of SARS at the workplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministerial Committee on SARS has also studied\r\n\r\nand  prepared contingency plans to deal with an  outbreak\r\n\r\nof  SARS among large numbers of foreign workers.  So far,\r\n\r\nthis has not happened.  The plan would include setting up\r\n\r\nquarantine  facilities  to isolate  affected  workers  in\r\n\r\ndesignated areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second approach is aimed at minimising the\r\n\r\nimport  of  new  SARS  cases via the  intake  of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers   from  SARS-affected  areas.   In  this  regard,\r\n\r\ncompanies  have been strongly urged to defer bringing  in\r\n\r\nnew  work pass holders from SARS-affected areas,  and  to\r\n\r\nrefrain from sending existing work pass holders or  their\r\n\r\nother  employees  to  SARS-affected areas  for  the  time\r\n\r\nbeing.   Where  it  is  absolutely necessary  to  do  so,\r\n\r\nemployers   must  place  the  work  pass  holders   under\r\n\r\nmandatory quarantine for a minimum of 10 days immediately\r\n\r\nupon  arrival in Singapore.  Work permit holders will  be\r\n\r\nplaced  under quarantine at designated dormitories  while\r\n\r\nemployment  pass  holders  will  be  placed  under   home\r\n\r\nquarantine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist employers during this difficult time, my\r\n\r\nMinistry   will  exercise  flexibility  in  renewing   or\r\n\r\nextending  work permits of existing workers in  Singapore\r\n\r\ncoming  from  the  SARS-affected areas beyond  the  usual\r\n\r\nmaximum period of stay.  The other prevailing work permit\r\n\r\nconditions  will  continue to apply to  such  renewal  or\r\n\r\nextension.

As of now, there\r\n\r\nis  still one work permit holder who is at Tan Tock  Seng\r\n\r\nHospital under observation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Woodlands dormitory, we had 89 work permit\r\n\r\nholders  under  quarantine, mostly existing  work  permit\r\n\r\nholders  who had been on home leave from their  employers\r\n\r\nand  who were coming back to Singapore.  Fortunately, all\r\n\r\nof  them  are  well; none of them has shown any  sign  of\r\n\r\nfever during this period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 126 current Employment Pass holders had\r\n\r\nreturned to Singapore from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSARS-affected areas since the quarantine requirement  was\r\n\r\nimplemented.   So far, 15 had completed their  period  of\r\n\r\nquarantine yesterday.  Two of those who were expected  to\r\n\r\ncomplete  their quarantine period yesterday  had,  during\r\n\r\nthat  period, left Singapore.  We are following  up  with\r\n\r\nthem and will take up their cases upon their return.   33\r\n\r\nnew Employment Pass holders had also completed their home\r\n\r\nquarantine and were certified fit.  The doctors gave them\r\n\r\na medical certificate to say that they had no fever, they\r\n\r\nwere  certified fit to commence work.  They  were  issued\r\n\r\nwith  new  Employment  Passes accordingly.   Two  of  the\r\n\r\napplicants  were  not issued with Employment  Passes  and\r\n\r\nwere  asked  to submit the required medical  certificates\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Employment Passes could  be  issued.   Their\r\n\r\nemployers  were also warned to comply with the quarantine\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from this experience of running a quarantine\r\n\r\nfor newly-arrived work permit or Employment Pass holders,\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  revise some of our procedures, particularly\r\n\r\nthose concerning the work permit holders, as a result  of\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have had to ask employers to slow  down  their\r\n\r\nintake  of  new work permit holders for the  time  being,\r\n\r\nespecially those coming from the SARS-affected areas.  We\r\n\r\nneed  to look for more facilities, more accommodation  to\r\n\r\nput  them  up.  In case they have to be sent to Tan  Tock\r\n\r\nSeng  Hospital for observation, upon their discharge from\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals,  we would have to find  better  isolation\r\n\r\nfacilities to accommodate them so that they are not mixed\r\n\r\ntogether  with any of the other work permit  holders  who\r\n\r\nare   under  quarantine.   Because,  if  they  are  mixed\r\n\r\ntogether, then it will complicate the quarantine for  the\r\n\r\nrest of the work permit holders.  They will end up having\r\n\r\nto  stay  for a longer period, as we have experienced  in\r\n\r\none instance in Tampines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we are seeking the cooperation of employers.\r\n\r\nWe ask them to please defer bringing in new workers for a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  time.   Let  us  look  for  more  and  better\r\n\r\naccommodation that can meet the needs of this  quarantine\r\n\r\nbefore we can allow them to bring in the work permit\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nholders  from these SARS-affected areas.  The purpose  is\r\n\r\nnot  to  prevent  them from recruiting  the  work  permit\r\n\r\nholders if they really need them, but it is just to allow\r\n\r\nus  more time to set up a better system to handle the new\r\n\r\narrivals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister spoke about language translations.

Of  course,  for  Employment  Pass  holders,\r\n\r\nlanguage is not a problem.  They are all better educated.\r\n\r\nEnglish is their lingua franca.  For the foreign domestic\r\n\r\nworkers,  they would be in Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog  and\r\n\r\nThai.   For  the construction workers, they would  be  in\r\n\r\nThai  and Tamil. For those from Bangladesh, we will  have\r\n\r\nthem  in Bangladeshi.  Whatever it is, we will have  them\r\n\r\nin the language that they are familiar with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to her second question on accommodation capacity\r\n\r\nthat  we have today for the work permit holders, we  have\r\n\r\nsufficient capacity for about 200 work permit holders  in\r\n\r\na centralised quarantine at any one time.  But because of\r\n\r\nthe  complication that once a batch comes in and somebody\r\n\r\nhas  to be sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for observation\r\n\r\nand, when he is discharged, he cannot go back to the same\r\n\r\ngroup, he has to be kept separate for a further period of\r\n\r\nobservation.  So, if we have a number of such cases -  as\r\n\r\nI  explained earlier on, we have eight out of the  second\r\n\r\nbatch  of  53  -  then we complicate the process  and  we\r\n\r\nincrease  the demand for accommodation.  That is  why  we\r\n\r\nare  now  in the process of looking for more and  better-suited accommodation, and we are requesting employers  to\r\n\r\nplease, in the meantime, slow down the intake, to give us\r\n\r\ntime to look for these facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Could the Minister please\r\n\r\nlet us know when these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntranslations  will  be  available,  because  the  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers are already at the doorsteps of hospitals?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> I believe my Ministry has got the\r\n\r\ntranslations  ready, and most of them  would  be  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess of being issued.

This will have an adverse impact  on\r\n\r\nour   employment   situation.   In   response   to   this\r\n\r\nunprecedented situation, many companies have had to  make\r\n\r\nquick   adjustments   to  their  employment   terms   and\r\n\r\npractices, such as getting their employees to take annual\r\n\r\nleave,  implementing shorter work weeks, and re-deploying\r\n\r\nstaff  to  optimise the use of manpower resources.  While\r\n\r\nthese   changes  will  impose  a  strain  on   employment\r\n\r\nrelationship, I am confident and also pleased  to  inform\r\n\r\nthe House that there have been no major labour-management\r\n\r\nrelations  problems at the workplace since the  onset  of\r\n\r\nthe SARS outbreak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, there have been enquiries and\r\n\r\nassistance  sought  as  to how to  manage  the  leave  of\r\n\r\nabsence of employees arising from SARS and how this leave\r\n\r\nof  absence  should be dealt with.  In this  regard,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  in  consultation with the  Singapore  Business\r\n\r\nFederation,  the Singapore National Employers  Federation\r\n\r\nand  the  NTUC had, on 2nd April 2003, issued  a  set  of\r\n\r\ntripartite  guidelines on leave of  absence  relating  to\r\n\r\nSARS  for  implementation by employers.   The  guidelines\r\n\r\ncover  salary  payment for leave of  absence  in  various\r\n\r\nsituations.    Feedback  received  from   employers   and\r\n\r\nemployees on the implementation of the guidelines is that\r\n\r\nthe  guidelines have been useful in helping them to  deal\r\n\r\nwith the employment issues relating to the SARS outbreak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On other issues such as staff deployment,\r\n\r\nsegregation,  insurance and compensation,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nBusiness Federation, in consultation with the Ministry of\r\n\r\nTrade and Industry, Ministry of Health, my Ministry,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  National  Employers Federation  and  NTUC  had\r\n\r\nalso, on 16th April 2003, released a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nset  of  advisories  and Frequently Asked  Questions  for\r\n\r\nemployers  on how such issues at the workplace  could  be\r\n\r\nappropriately dealt with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these advisories, employers are advised to\r\n\r\nexplain  to their employees the need to cover the  duties\r\n\r\nof  those who have been affected by SARS so that business\r\n\r\noperations  will  not be disrupted.  On the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nemployers   should   also  provide  training   and   take\r\n\r\nprecautionary measures to safeguard the safety and health\r\n\r\nof workers concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as mentioned earlier, the outbreak of SARS has\r\n\r\nbadly  affected  the hotels, airlines,  travel  agencies,\r\n\r\nrestaurants  and  retail businesses.   Hence,  we  expect\r\n\r\nemployment  in these sectors to be adversely affected  as\r\n\r\nwell.  To deal with this situation, my Ministry, together\r\n\r\nwith  the  Singapore Business Federation,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nNational  Employers  Federation  and  NTUC,  had  jointly\r\n\r\nannounced  measures on 15th April 2003 to help  companies\r\n\r\nin  these  sectors to reduce cost and to  preserve  jobs.\r\n\r\nThese  measures include getting employees to take  leave,\r\n\r\nimplementing shorter work week, temporary lay-offs and/or\r\n\r\nsending  workers for skills training and upgrading  under\r\n\r\nthe  training  programmes provided  by  my  Ministry  and\r\n\r\nseveral other such agencies. Where such measures are  not\r\n\r\nsufficient to sustain business survival or preserve jobs,\r\n\r\ncompanies  may  also  consider  temporary  wage  cut   in\r\n\r\nconsultation with their unions and workers.   To  further\r\n\r\nminimise job losses in these sectors, the Government  had\r\n\r\nalso announced on 17th April a package of relief measures\r\n\r\nto reduce business costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while there could be some problems and\r\n\r\ndifficulties affecting employer-employee relationship,  I\r\n\r\nam  confident  that employers, trade unions  and  workers\r\n\r\nwill  rally  together and work out amicable solutions  in\r\n\r\nthe spirit of labour-management cooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question on how many Singaporeans have been\r\n\r\nsent  on working trips to SARS-affected areas, we do  not\r\n\r\nhave  the  statistics  as there  is  no  requirement  for\r\n\r\ncompanies to provide us with this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninformation.  However,  the Ministry  of  Health  and  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  had,  through our advisories, strongly  advised\r\n\r\nemployers to defer sending their employees to these areas\r\n\r\nunless the working trips are absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with our strong tripartite cooperation and\r\n\r\nsupport among the social partners, I am confident that we\r\n\r\nwill  be able to overcome the disruptions caused  by  the\r\n\r\nSARS outbreak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HEALTH MEASURES AGAINST SARS OUTBREAK</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Health)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Health (a)\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the  situation of the Severe Acute  Respiratory\r\n\r\nSyndrome (SARS) outbreak in Singapore;

So this is a very serious problem confronting\r\n\r\nSingapore and the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start by summarising what we know and what we\r\n\r\ndo not know at the moment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now six weeks since WHO first issued its\r\n\r\nglobal  health alert on 12th March on cases  of  atypical\r\n\r\npneumonia.   For  the  Healthcare Workers  (HCW)  at  the\r\n\r\nfrontline  combating  SARS, this  has  been  a  long  and\r\n\r\ndemanding six weeks.  But six weeks is a relatively short\r\n\r\nperiod for a completely new disease.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WHO announced on 16th April that a newly\r\n\r\ndiscovered virus from the coronavirus family is the cause\r\n\r\nof SARS. Identification and characterisation of the exact\r\n\r\ncausative   virus  will  allow  development   of   better\r\n\r\ndiagnostic  tests and treatment protocols. A  significant\r\n\r\nstep  towards this was the recent sequencing of the viral\r\n\r\ngenome  by  scientists in the US, Canada, Hong  Kong  and\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are learning more about the spectrum of clinical\r\n\r\npresentations.   Most  patients  present   with   typical\r\n\r\nfeatures  with  a  sudden onset of  high  fever  with  or\r\n\r\nwithout  muscle  aches.   Some  patients  may  also  have\r\n\r\nchills,  shivering, cough and headache.   After  3  to  7\r\n\r\ndays, patients may start to have shortness of breath, and\r\n\r\nX-ray  changes  to their chest reflecting pneumonia.   In\r\n\r\nabout  80-90%  of cases, the patient gradually  recovers.\r\n\r\nHowever, in 10-15% of cases, after about seven days,  the\r\n\r\npneumonia  progresses and the patient needs treatment  in\r\n\r\nthe  intensive care unit with most requiring a ventilator\r\n\r\nto  help  them  breathe.  About 6% of cases  die  despite\r\n\r\nintensive care.  The majority of patients who succumb  to\r\n\r\nthe  disease are older persons above the age of 40 years.\r\n\r\nBut we have had three deaths from patients below 40 years\r\n\r\nold.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have observed a number of cases where the\r\n\r\nsymptoms  have  not  been typical.   This  has  made  the\r\n\r\ndisease even more difficult to combat.  This has occurred\r\n\r\nin   patients  with  many  pre-existing  chronic  medical\r\n\r\nconditions,   such   as  heart  disease   and   bacterial\r\n\r\ninfections that mask the symptoms and signs of SARS.   In\r\n\r\nsuch  cases, the fever may be low-grade at the  beginning\r\n\r\nand signs of lung infection occur very late in the course\r\n\r\nof  illness.  Such cases are very difficult to  recognise\r\n\r\nearly  and  pose  a  major challenge for  our  healthcare\r\n\r\nprofessionals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is SARS transmitted? Both WHO and the US CDC\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the  main  way  SARS  spreads  is  through\r\n\r\ntransmission of infectious droplets, for example, when  a\r\n\r\nSARS patient coughs or sneezes droplets into the air  and\r\n\r\nsomeone  else close by breathes these droplets  in.   Our\r\n\r\nown experience in Singapore supports this view since most\r\n\r\nof  our  cases  have  occurred  either  among  healthcare\r\n\r\nworkers  caring for SARS patients in hospital, or  family\r\n\r\nmembers  and friends of the patients who had visited  and\r\n\r\ncome  into  close  contact  with  them.   Based  on   our\r\n\r\nexperience,  patients appear to be most  infectious  when\r\n\r\nthey  are  ill.  Most of the SARS patients  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nhave  passed  on  their infection to a  small  number  of\r\n\r\npeople only, and through close contact.  However, we have\r\n\r\nalso  noted that there is a small number of SARS patients\r\n\r\nwho  appear  to be highly infectious, infecting  a  large\r\n\r\nnumber  of  people.  These people have  been  called  the\r\n\r\n\"super-spreaders\".  This may also have been  due  to  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  their  SARS illness had not  been  picked  up\r\n\r\nearlier  and they had infected a large number of  persons\r\n\r\nin  close  contact  with  them  by  the  time  they  were\r\n\r\ndiagnosed  with  SARS.   Hence, in Singapore,  four  SARS\r\n\r\npatients  have  been responsible for the transmission  of\r\n\r\nthe  infection  to  the vast majority  of  the  182  non-imported patients that we have seen so far in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there may be situations where SARS may have\r\n\r\nbeen transmitted through other routes.  For example,  the\r\n\r\noutbreak involving a large number of residents\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin an apartment block in Hong Kong suggests that SARS may\r\n\r\nbe  transmitted perhaps through some common environmental\r\n\r\nroute.   Transmission through contaminated surfaces  also\r\n\r\ncannot  be ruled out.  That is why we emphasise the  need\r\n\r\nfor  a  higher  standard  of personal  and  environmental\r\n\r\nhygiene.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, three diagnostic tests have been developed\r\n\r\nfor  SARS.   However,  all  the tests  have  limitations.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  test for antibodies to SARS in  the  blood.\r\n\r\nHowever,  this is present only from about 20  days  after\r\n\r\nthe  onset of clinical symptoms.  It therefore cannot  be\r\n\r\nused  to detect cases at an early stage. The second test,\r\n\r\nan  immunofluorescence  assay (IFA),  detects  antibodies\r\n\r\nreliably  as  of  day  10 of infection,  but  this  is  a\r\n\r\ncomparatively slow test that requires the growth of virus\r\n\r\nin cell culture.   The third test is a molecular test for\r\n\r\ndetection  of the SARS virus genetic material.   This  is\r\n\r\nuseful in the early stages of infection but at this stage\r\n\r\nof  development, the test method fails to  pick  up  many\r\n\r\npatients  with SARS.  WHO has stated that  more  work  is\r\n\r\nneeded  to  produce  a robust test  that  is  capable  of\r\n\r\nrapidly and reliably detecting cases at an early stage of\r\n\r\ninfection.    Many  laboratories,  including   those   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, are working to achieve this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, as yet, no specific treatment for SARS.\r\n\r\nWHO  has  stated that no treatment beyond good  intensive\r\n\r\nand supportive care has been shown to improve the outcome\r\n\r\nin patients with SARS.  About 8-9% of our cases have died\r\n\r\ncompared  to the global average of 6%.  The case fatality\r\n\r\nrate  in  Hong Kong has been about 7% but that in  Canada\r\n\r\nhas  been  about  9%.  A likely reason for  the  slightly\r\n\r\nhigher  fatality rate in Singapore compared to Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nis  that the daily occurrence of new cases here has  been\r\n\r\nmuch  lower than that in Hong Kong.  In Canada,  most  of\r\n\r\nthe  fatalities have occurred among elderly patients with\r\n\r\nco-existing chronic illnesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the current situation of SARS in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I had previously explained our strategy to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontain  SARS in Singapore. The main components  of  this\r\n\r\nstrategy  are  to identify and isolate symptomatic  cases\r\n\r\nearly,  to  quarantine contacts who have been exposed  to\r\n\r\npatients  with  SARS and to minimise the  number  of  new\r\n\r\nimported cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry decided early on to concentrate all SARS\r\n\r\ncases in TTSH and CDC.  Enhanced infection controls  were\r\n\r\nput  in  place.  No TTSH staff looking after  known  SARS\r\n\r\npatients have caught the disease for the last six weeks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important characteristic of SARS is that it is\r\n\r\nmore  infectious when the patient is sicker.   Hence,  it\r\n\r\ntends  to be transmitted quickly among healthcare workers\r\n\r\nwho  are not appropriately protected when they take  care\r\n\r\nof  SARS  patients.  The lack of a rapid diagnostic  test\r\n\r\nthat  can  be applied early, the non-specific  nature  of\r\n\r\nSARS  symptoms,  ie,  just  fever  and  cough,  and   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  the  co-existence of multiple  illnesses\r\n\r\nmasking  the  presence of SARS in the same  patient  have\r\n\r\nmade  it  very difficult to identify SARS patients  early\r\n\r\nand  reliably.  The outbreak in SGH that started in early\r\n\r\nApril  involved  a  single super-spreader  with  multiple\r\n\r\nillnesses.   The outbreak in SGH led to a cluster of SARS\r\n\r\ncases  in  NUH.  We are still mopping up the consequences\r\n\r\nof that setback.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has implemented additional measures to\r\n\r\ncontain  the outbreaks in hospitals and other  healthcare\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  including  nursing  homes.   Firstly,  all\r\n\r\nhealthcare  workers in all hospitals are now required  to\r\n\r\nwear N95 masks, gloves and gowns and to practise frequent\r\n\r\nhandwashing  after every patient contact.   In  isolation\r\n\r\nfacilities, Emergency departments and ICUs, they are also\r\n\r\nrequired  to  wear  goggles and hoods if  there  are  any\r\n\r\ninterventions.  This is to ensure that they  do  not  get\r\n\r\ninfected  by  patients who have SARS but  have  not  been\r\n\r\ndiagnosed  to have the disease.  Secondly, all healthcare\r\n\r\ninstitutions  are  now required to  monitor  their  staff\r\n\r\nclosely   through  twice-daily  temperature   monitoring.\r\n\r\nStrict instructions have been given to disallow any staff\r\n\r\nmember  who  has fever or is unwell to start or  continue\r\n\r\nworking.  Thirdly, all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhealthcare  institutions have set  up  special  teams  to\r\n\r\nprevent  and control SARS.  The Ministry is carrying  out\r\n\r\naudits  on  health care institutions to ensure compliance\r\n\r\nwith  the  infection control practices.  The  Ministerial\r\n\r\nSARS  Combat Unit, headed by SMS Khaw Boon Wan, will give\r\n\r\nleadership  and  political weight to the  hospital  audit\r\n\r\nteams.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Mdm Ho Geok Choo's questions,\r\n\r\nselective  closure  of affected areas  of  SGH  has  been\r\n\r\ncarried  out  instead  of closing  SGH  completely.   For\r\n\r\nexample, the patients and staff in wards 57 and  58  were\r\n\r\nall  transferred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital  en-bloc.   At\r\n\r\nthe  same time, staff who may have been exposed  to  SARS\r\n\r\npatients have all been quarantined.  SGH has also changed\r\n\r\nits  work practices so that teams of doctors work in only\r\n\r\none physical site, hence limiting the potential of cross-infection.   All public hospitals are closely  monitoring\r\n\r\ntheir  capacity  so  that  they can  take  the  necessary\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  match the need against their capacity.   As\r\n\r\nfor  using  private  hospitals to supplement  the  public\r\n\r\nhospitals,  this  is being explored.  One  option  is  to\r\n\r\nrefer some subsidised patients for selected treatment  in\r\n\r\nprivate hospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outbreak in SGH in early April also led to a\r\n\r\ncluster  of  SARS  cases at the Pasir  Panjang  Wholesale\r\n\r\nCentre.   We shut down the Centre for 10 days and imposed\r\n\r\nHome  Quarantine Orders on all the stallholders and their\r\n\r\nworkers  in the Centre.  The aim is to keep them isolated\r\n\r\nat  home  and prevent the infection from spreading.   The\r\n\r\nregular  buyers  at  the  Wholesale  Centre  are  closely\r\n\r\nmonitored  through  telephone surveillance.   This  is  a\r\n\r\nmassive effort to systematically isolate and contain  the\r\n\r\nspread.   We have harnessed all the Government  resources\r\n\r\nto  this  end.   We  need the cooperation  of  all  those\r\n\r\ninvolved, in order to break the chain of infection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also put in place a number of measures to\r\n\r\nensure that clusters of infection do not develop from new\r\n\r\nimported cases of SARS.  To reduce the number of imported\r\n\r\ncases,  we  are  carrying  out health  screening  through\r\n\r\ntemperature checks on incoming air and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsea  passengers  from  the  SARS  affected  areas.   This\r\n\r\ncomplements the checks that airlines have put in place at\r\n\r\ncheck-in counters.  Flight crews are also on the  lookout\r\n\r\nfor  ill  passengers on board aircraft.  All visitors  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  have  been  required  to  complete  a   Health\r\n\r\nDeclaration   Card  from  9th  April  this   year.    All\r\n\r\ntravellers  who  enter Singapore from affected  countries\r\n\r\nare  also  given  a Health Alert Notice  to  explain  the\r\n\r\nsymptoms  of SARS and how they can get help if they  fall\r\n\r\nill  with  suspected SARS.  We will continue  with  these\r\n\r\nmeasures for the long term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 120,000 people enter Singapore from Malaysia\r\n\r\neach day and half of those travel daily.  My Ministry  is\r\n\r\nworking  closely  with  our  Malaysian  counterparts   on\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  prevent and control SARS in our  respective\r\n\r\ncountries.   A  delegation of MOH and MHA  officials  met\r\n\r\nwith   their  Malaysian  counterparts  to  discuss  joint\r\n\r\nmeasures and the regular exchange of health information.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have to be realistic. Global travel means\r\n\r\nthat  new  imported  cases  will  occur  in  the  future.\r\n\r\nScreening  of  travellers is limited in its effectiveness\r\n\r\nas  it  will  not  pick up persons during the  incubation\r\n\r\nperiod.   Persons  can therefore be  well  as  they  pass\r\n\r\nthrough the screening procedures and develop SARS  later.\r\n\r\nA  single  imported  case  can trigger  off  an  outbreak\r\n\r\ninvolving many cases, especially if he or she is a super-spreader,  even though we quickly institute  the  control\r\n\r\nmeasures to isolate and ring-fence ill persons and  their\r\n\r\ncontacts so as to limit disease transmission.  Hence,  we\r\n\r\nmust  all  be prepared to accept that we are in this  for\r\n\r\nthe long haul.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to some of the specific questions\r\n\r\nraised  by  Members.   Dr Amy Khor asked  about  measures\r\n\r\ntaken for Singaporeans living in SARS affected areas.  My\r\n\r\nanswer is that they should follow the advice given by the\r\n\r\nlocal  health authorities where they live.   They  should\r\n\r\nalso check on the information provided by MOH through our\r\n\r\nwebsite  on how they can reduce the risk of catching  the\r\n\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2051</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong, Dr Michael Lim and Dr Chong Weng\r\n\r\nChiew  asked  how  we are recognising the professionalism\r\n\r\nand  contributions by our healthcare workers.  Let me put\r\n\r\non  record that we are proud of them and we commend  them\r\n\r\nhighly  for their dedication and professionalism.   I  am\r\n\r\npleased  to  inform  the House that  the  two  healthcare\r\n\r\nclusters, as employers of these healthcare workers,  have\r\n\r\nalready  implemented  a policy of covering  the  complete\r\n\r\nmedical  bills  of their staff and their families  should\r\n\r\nthey  fall ill with SARS in the line of duty.  For  these\r\n\r\nstaff, the medical expenses and medical leave will not be\r\n\r\ndeducted  from their yearly entitlement.  A Courage  Fund\r\n\r\nhas  been  set  up  by the two healthcare  clusters,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore    Medical   Association,   Singapore    Nurses\r\n\r\nAssociation  and Singapore Press Holdings,  to  help  the\r\n\r\nfamilies  of  needy patients in honour of all  healthcare\r\n\r\nworkers  in  Singapore.   The clusters have  in  place  a\r\n\r\nmechanism  to review the salary of our nurses  and  other\r\n\r\nhealthcare  workers  regularly.  Apart  from  the  salary\r\n\r\nreview,  we  will  look into other  ways  to  honour  and\r\n\r\nrecognise the exceptional contributions made by  all  our\r\n\r\nhealthcare workers at an appropriate time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to what we can do. My Ministry has\r\n\r\nput in place all the measures to minimise the risk of new\r\n\r\nclusters of infection from unrecognised cases of SARS  in\r\n\r\nour  hospitals and from imported cases.  However, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  caution  Members  that  in  the  absence  of  a\r\n\r\ndefinitive  diagnostic  test, it  is  very  difficult  to\r\n\r\nidentify and isolate such cases early.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, we only have two weapons to work with.\r\n\r\nFirst, the clinical symptoms, of which the onset of  high\r\n\r\nfever  is  an  important indicator.  Second, the  contact\r\n\r\nhistory which points to the possibility of being infected\r\n\r\nby a SARS patient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To win the battle against SARS, we need a change in\r\n\r\nmindset,  a  much higher level of social  discipline  and\r\n\r\nsocial  responsibility.  To make full use  of  the  first\r\n\r\nweapon,   we  must  encourage  everyone  to  take   their\r\n\r\ntemperature daily.  If you detect that you\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  fever and are unwell, do not go to work.   If  your\r\n\r\nchild has a fever, do not send your child to school.  See\r\n\r\na  doctor and stay at home until you are well.  When  you\r\n\r\ngo  to  the doctor's clinic, wear a face mask  so  as  to\r\n\r\nreduce the risk of spreading infection to others.  If you\r\n\r\ncough, cover your mouth and nose with tissue paper  or  a\r\n\r\nhandkerchief.  Do not spit on the floor or in  the  open.\r\n\r\nPractise  good  personal  hygiene  and  wash  your  hands\r\n\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this difficult period, Singaporeans should\r\n\r\nalso look out for one another.  If your family member  or\r\n\r\ncolleague  or  neighbour is sick, advise  him  to  see  a\r\n\r\ndoctor and stay at home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we must be truthful about our contact history.\r\n\r\nIf  we suppress information about our travel history, our\r\n\r\nlikely  contacts with probable or suspect SARS  patients,\r\n\r\nour  visits to the hospitals or other venues where we may\r\n\r\nhave contact with SARS patients, then we are giving false\r\n\r\ninformation and giving up a very important weapon in  our\r\n\r\nfight  against  SARS.   To the GP, for  example,  without\r\n\r\nknowing your contact history, he may arrive at the  wrong\r\n\r\ndiagnosis  and think that your fever and cough  are  just\r\n\r\nthe symptoms of a cold or a flu.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must recognise that it is in their\r\n\r\ninterest to work together with the Government to  prevent\r\n\r\nand  control SARS in our community.  If you are sick  and\r\n\r\nyou  seek medical treatment immediately, your chances  of\r\n\r\nrecovery are better.  You are less likely to infect  your\r\n\r\nfamily.  If everyone who has fever and is unwell stays at\r\n\r\nhome  and  away from crowds, then Singaporeans will  have\r\n\r\ngreater confidence that the likelihood of meeting a  very\r\n\r\ninfectious  person in a crowd will be much reduced.    In\r\n\r\nthis  way,  we  prevent  the  Battle  against  SARS  from\r\n\r\nbecoming a Crisis of Fear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Battle against SARS, if all Singaporeans work\r\n\r\ntogether, with our healthcare workers in the frontline in\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals, with all the Government resources backing\r\n\r\nthem, and all Singaporeans playing their part with higher\r\n\r\nsocial discipline and social responsibility,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthen I am confident that we can contain the disease.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lim, was that your Ministerial\r\n\r\nStatement?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In which case, I call upon the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister to make his Ministerial Statement and also\r\n\r\naddress the rest of the Questions in the Order Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SARS: A NATIONAL RESPONSE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Finance)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and  Minister for Finance in the light  of  the\r\n\r\ndifficult  economic situation, whether he is  willing  to\r\n\r\nallow property tax to be paid by instalments rather  than\r\n\r\nthe full tax be paid in one lump sum.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nTrade  and Industry (a) what is his Ministry's assessment\r\n\r\nof the impact of  the Iraq war and the outbreak of Severe\r\n\r\nAcute Respiratory Syndrome on the various sectors of  our\r\n\r\neconomy  and  the overall estimated economic growth  rate\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore  for 2003;

It  has\r\n\r\ntaken a heavy toll on our public health, our economy  and\r\n\r\nour  society.   We  have to muster all  our  resolve  and\r\n\r\nresources, in order to fight SARS.  Then we can bring the\r\n\r\nSARS  outbreak  under control, restore confidence,  boost\r\n\r\nmorale, and get the economy moving.  If we fail to do so,\r\n\r\nand  allow  the disease to overwhelm us, the consequences\r\n\r\nwill be catastrophic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tackling SARS calls for an effective and\r\n\r\ncomprehensive plan, rigorously implemented, with the full\r\n\r\nsupport   and  cooperation  of  Singaporeans.   We   have\r\n\r\nmobilised  the  whole  Government  machinery   for   this\r\n\r\npurpose.   The  Ministry of Health and the hospitals  are\r\n\r\nfully engaged in the medical measures to combat SARS.  In\r\n\r\naddition, we have set up a Ministerial Committee, chaired\r\n\r\nby Mr Wong Kan Seng, to coordinate all the ministries and\r\n\r\ndepartments involved, to support the Ministry  of  Health\r\n\r\nand to direct the broader response.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Hng Khiang has just presented the public\r\n\r\nhealth  measures.  Let me now explain the overall  action\r\n\r\nplan.  There are three battlefronts - public health,  the\r\n\r\neconomy and the society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Battlefront 1 - Public health</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, public health. Besides medically treating\r\n\r\nthose  who  have caught the disease, we must take  public\r\n\r\nhealth measures to stop the spread of the illness, and to\r\n\r\nminimise the number of people who fall ill.  We  need  to\r\n\r\nset up lines of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndefence around three groups of people.  First, those  who\r\n\r\nare  already  infected or who might be infected;  second,\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  not infected; and third, those  entering\r\n\r\nSingapore who might bring in the virus.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Detect, isolate and contain</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are already infected or who might be\r\n\r\ninfected,  our  strategy  is  to  \"detect,  isolate   and\r\n\r\ncontain\".  This means sending those who are ill with SARS\r\n\r\npromptly to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, contact tracing - to  identify  and locate those who have had contact  with\r\n\r\nSARS  patients, and issuing Home Quarantine Orders (HQOs)\r\n\r\nto  those  who  are at risk.  The HQOs are to  put  their\r\n\r\nhealth  under close monitoring, and also to prevent  them\r\n\r\nfrom  spreading  the virus to others.  This  way  we  can\r\n\r\nbreak  the  cycle of infection and spread, and bring  the\r\n\r\noutbreak under control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most stringent precautions are taken at the\r\n\r\nhospitals.  That is where most of the SARS patients  are.\r\n\r\nThey  must be prevented from infecting other patients  or\r\n\r\nhealthcare  workers.  If doctors and nurses get  infected\r\n\r\nand fall victim to the disease, our healthcare system may\r\n\r\ncollapse,  and  SARS will spiral out of  control.   Hence\r\n\r\nhealthcare  workers are required to don  protective  gear\r\n\r\nand  to monitor their own temperatures closely.  We  have\r\n\r\nalso  severely  restricted visits by family  members  and\r\n\r\nfriends   to  patients  in  hospital.   These   stringent\r\n\r\nmeasures are working.  Because of them, since 31st March,\r\n\r\nno  patients  in Tan Tock Seng Hospital have  fallen  ill\r\n\r\nfrom SARS as a result of being infected in the hospital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the community, we must trace all the contacts of\r\n\r\nSARS patients quickly and comprehensively, and place them\r\n\r\non  home quarantine.  For this strategy to work, patients\r\n\r\nand   their   families   have  to  cooperate   with   the\r\n\r\nauthorities,  to  tell  fully and  truthfully  where  the\r\n\r\npatient has been and whom he has had contact with.   And,\r\n\r\nif  there is somebody or some place you have been to, and\r\n\r\nyou  do  not  want to tell us about, well,  that  is  big\r\n\r\ntrouble.    Also  the  quarantine  system   has   to   be\r\n\r\nwatertight.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIt  takes  only one undeclared contact, one irresponsible\r\n\r\nbreach  of  an  HQO,  to  start a whole  new  cluster  of\r\n\r\ninfections.   It  is therefore absolutely essential  that\r\n\r\nthose  served with HQOs obey the orders and stay at home,\r\n\r\nand  not  put  many others at risk.  Thus we  have  acted\r\n\r\nfirmly   against  HQO  defaulters.   We  have   installed\r\n\r\nelectronic   cameras  in  their  homes,  and  implemented\r\n\r\ntougher  enforcement measures such as electronic tagging.\r\n\r\nWhile most people on HQOs have complied and cooperated, a\r\n\r\nminority are recalcitrant and incorrigible, and  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  public  understands that we  have  to  take  serious\r\n\r\nmeasures.   I received a fax today from a member  of  the\r\n\r\npublic who says, \"When you ring them up, better make sure\r\n\r\nthat  they are not using call forwarding.\"  I have  asked\r\n\r\nthe Minister in charge to fix that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the Minister for Health is amending the\r\n\r\nInfectious Diseases Act, on a Certificate of Urgency,  to\r\n\r\ngive  additional powers to the Ministry  to  take  action\r\n\r\nagainst persons who breach HQOs, refuse to cooperate with\r\n\r\nhealth  officers to take SARS control measures,  wilfully\r\n\r\nhide medical information related to SARS control, or fail\r\n\r\nto  comply with any directives or regulations related  to\r\n\r\nSARS  control.  Violators can be levied composition fines\r\n\r\nof  up  to  $5,000,  instead of being charged  in  court.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  the  general  penalty  for  committing   an\r\n\r\noffence  under the Act will be doubled, to a  maximum  of\r\n\r\n$10,000  or  6 months' imprisonment for a first  offence,\r\n\r\nand $20,000 or 12 months for a repeat offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These public health measures to \"detect, isolate and\r\n\r\ncontain\"  the disease are all the more necessary  because\r\n\r\nthere  is  not yet a diagnostic test for SARS, which  can\r\n\r\ntell quickly and reliably whether or not a suspected case\r\n\r\nhas   the   disease.   Scientists  in   A*STAR   research\r\n\r\ninstitutes  in Singapore have been working  flat  out  as\r\n\r\npart of a worldwide effort to identify and understand the\r\n\r\nSARS virus.  They have successfully mapped the genome  of\r\n\r\nthe  SARS virus, confirming and extending the results  of\r\n\r\nmappings   done  elsewhere.   The  Genome  Institute   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  developing  new  diagnostic  methods,  and\r\n\r\nseveral other diagnostic methods are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecoming available from other laboratories.  We  will  be\r\n\r\ntesting  these  out over the next weeks  and  months,  to\r\n\r\nidentify  the  best  methods to use, and  I  believe  the\r\n\r\nmethods will improve over time, as the scientists work at\r\n\r\nit.   The ultimate goal of the scientific research is  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a treatment and a vaccine for SARS, but this  is\r\n\r\nnot  going to occur overnight, and may take several years\r\n\r\nor even longer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Protect and Monitor the healthy</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are not infected, we are taking\r\n\r\nvigorous measures to prevent them from contracting  SARS.\r\n\r\nWe  need  to  pay special attention to public areas  with\r\n\r\nheavy  human  traffic,  and  mass  institutions  such  as\r\n\r\nschools and military camps.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of the Environment (ENV) has taken\r\n\r\npreventive  actions  to  raise the  overall  standard  of\r\n\r\npublic  health  and  hygiene, to  minimise  the  risk  of\r\n\r\nenvironmental transmission of SARS.  ENV will  clean  and\r\n\r\ndisinfect  public  areas, check for and eliminate  pests,\r\n\r\nensure  that  waste  disposal  and  collection  is   done\r\n\r\nproperly,  and  make  sure our sewerage  systems  are  in\r\n\r\nproper  working  order.  We will  also  ensure  that  our\r\n\r\nenvironmental   workers   are   properly   equipped   and\r\n\r\nprotected,  so  that they do not inadvertently  become  a\r\n\r\nmode  of  transmission.  Within the next week,  ENV  will\r\n\r\nwork  with  market stallholders to spring-clean  all  wet\r\n\r\nmarkets.   Food handlers in all food establishments  will\r\n\r\nbe required to take their temperatures twice a day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of National Development, together with\r\n\r\nHDB and Town Councils, has instituted several measures to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  cleanliness of our housing estates.   These\r\n\r\ninclude  stepping up the general cleaning of  HDB  common\r\n\r\nareas and implementing an SOP to respond to complaints of\r\n\r\nsanitary  pipe  leaks  within  24  hours.   The  Building\r\n\r\nControl  Authority  (BCA)  has  reminded  all  Management\r\n\r\nCorporations   of  private  buildings  to  maintain   the\r\n\r\nsanitary  pipes  in  their  buildings  in  good   working\r\n\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education (MOE) has also introduced\r\n\r\na series of measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSchools are educating students about SARS, issuing  every\r\n\r\nstudent with a personal thermometer, and teaching them to\r\n\r\ncheck  their own temperatures daily.  Students and  staff\r\n\r\nare  also  required  to  regularly declare  their  travel\r\n\r\nhistory.    The   institutes  of  higher   learning   are\r\n\r\nsegmenting their large campuses into smaller sections, to\r\n\r\nreduce  movement  across  the campus  and  to  facilitate\r\n\r\ncontact tracing should a SARS case occur.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development and Sports (MCDS) have implemented\r\n\r\nstandard operating procedures for child-care centres  and\r\n\r\nkindergartens, to screen and manage the children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) has instituted all\r\n\r\npossible precautionary measures.  It has disseminated  to\r\n\r\nall  Singapore  Armed Forces (SAF) units  information  on\r\n\r\nSARS,  tips  on  personal hygiene, travel  advisory,  and\r\n\r\nprocedures  for handling suspected SARS cases.   Critical\r\n\r\nunits  are  working in shifts to ensure  that  operations\r\n\r\ncontinue seamlessly in case there is an outbreak  in  the\r\n\r\nunits.    All  recruits  and  NSmen  undergoing   in-camp\r\n\r\ntraining will be screened for SARS daily.  By the end  of\r\n\r\nthis  month,  MINDEF will issue personal thermometers  to\r\n\r\nall   MINDEF   and  SAF  personnel  to  do  twice   daily\r\n\r\ntemperature  checks.  These measures will  keep  the  SAF\r\n\r\nSARS-free, while maintaining its operational readiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a useful practice for Singaporeans to take\r\n\r\ntheir  own temperatures daily and, if they have a  fever,\r\n\r\nto  stay  away from work or school and see their  doctor.\r\n\r\nTemperatures  are already being taken at many  workplaces\r\n\r\nand  large gatherings, and Members had their temperatures\r\n\r\ntaken  before  coming into Parliament  House  today.   It\r\n\r\nreassures  everyone who is there that the group  is  less\r\n\r\nlikely  to contain an infectious SARS case, and it  helps\r\n\r\nto  detect early anyone who is ill, before he can  infect\r\n\r\ntoo  many people.  Even if this measure is only partially\r\n\r\neffective,  it  will  still reduce the  chances  of  SARS\r\n\r\nspreading from one person to many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nothers,  and  thus  help us to bring the  outbreak  under\r\n\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every home should have a thermometer. Every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  should know how to take his temperature,  so\r\n\r\nthat  he  can  take personal responsibility for  his  own\r\n\r\nhealth,   and   monitor   his  own   and   his   family's\r\n\r\ntemperatures.  It will take a month or two to obtain  the\r\n\r\nsupplies, distribute the thermometers to homes, and teach\r\n\r\nSingaporeans how to use them.  Our first priority  is  to\r\n\r\nprovide  all  pupils in schools, and SAF personnel,  with\r\n\r\nthermometers.    After that we will progressively  supply\r\n\r\nthe  homes  with thermometers, and each home should  have\r\n\r\none.   By June, every student and every household  should\r\n\r\nhave a thermometer, and should use it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Safeguard borders</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third major concern is to prevent fresh cases of\r\n\r\nSARS  from being introduced into Singapore by travellers,\r\n\r\nand Singaporeans infected with SARS from going abroad and\r\n\r\ninfecting  other countries.  SARS is a major  problem  in\r\n\r\nChina  and  Hong  Kong, and cases have been  reported  in\r\n\r\nnearly  every  country in the region, including  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand  Indonesia.  We must expect new index cases to  enter\r\n\r\nSingapore from time to time.  This was, in fact, how  the\r\n\r\nSARS outbreak in Singapore started.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot shut our borders, and stop the movement of\r\n\r\npeople  and businesses completely.  But we must institute\r\n\r\neffective border controls, to identify people with  fever\r\n\r\nso  that they can be examined more thoroughly by doctors.\r\n\r\nWe have built thermal scanners that enable us to scan the\r\n\r\ntemperatures  of large numbers of people efficiently  and\r\n\r\nwithout intrusion.  If you walk past the scanner and your\r\n\r\nface  looks green on the monitor, that means you  are  in\r\n\r\nthe  pink of health.  If your face looks red, the Chinese\r\n\r\nsay the kuan kong face, then you better see a doctor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already started screening all inbound air\r\n\r\npassengers  from  SARS  affected  areas.   This  includes\r\n\r\npassengers  coming into Changi Airport for  transit.   As\r\n\r\nsoon as we acquire more scanners,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  will extend the screening to inbound passengers  from\r\n\r\nall areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also started screening all passengers\r\n\r\ndeparting  from Singapore.  At the airport, when  you  go\r\n\r\nfrom  the  land side to the air side through the barrier,\r\n\r\nyou will be screened.  These measures make Changi Airport\r\n\r\nboth  a safe transit point for passengers from all  round\r\n\r\nthe world, as well as a safe place to visit.  There is no\r\n\r\nreason  for  either locals or foreigners to avoid  Changi\r\n\r\nAirport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also paying close attention to the Causeway\r\n\r\nand  the  Second Link, where more than 100,000 travellers\r\n\r\nmove in and out daily. We have installed thermal scanners\r\n\r\nat   both   the  Woodlands  and  Tuas  land  checkpoints.\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Malaysian health and immigration officials\r\n\r\nhave  been meeting to discuss the SARS problem, and  will\r\n\r\nwork  closely together to draw up measures to screen  for\r\n\r\nSARS at the Causeway and the Second Link.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newly arrived work pass holders coming from SARS\r\n\r\naffected  areas  are being required to undergo  a  10-day\r\n\r\nquarantine to minimise the risk of their bringing in SARS\r\n\r\nto the workplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN leaders recognise the seriousness of the SARS\r\n\r\nproblem,  and  the need for a collective response.   They\r\n\r\nare  holding a Special ASEAN Leaders' meeting in  Bangkok\r\n\r\nnext  week,  to  coordinate our efforts and  collectively\r\n\r\nrespond  to  SARS  as  a region.  We  need  to  work  out\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  manage the movement of people across  ASEAN\r\n\r\nborders, so that we can stop SARS from spreading  between\r\n\r\ncountries while we maintain the flow of commerce.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Plan for the unexpected</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides taking immediate steps to keep the SARS\r\n\r\noutbreak  under  control, the Ministerial  Committee  has\r\n\r\nalso  been  working out contingency plans  to  deal  with\r\n\r\nvarious   scenarios  that  could  arise.   These  include\r\n\r\nmeasures  relating  to  health, the  economy,  transport,\r\n\r\nborder control, childcare centres, kindergartens and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nschools, emergency housing and social support, and public\r\n\r\ncommunications.   For  example, we are  working  out  the\r\n\r\nhousing and social support plan should a large number  of\r\n\r\npeople need to be quarantined, all at once.  We hope that\r\n\r\nwe  will not need these arrangements, but should any such\r\n\r\nsituation develop we will be prepared.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Battlefront 2 - The Economy</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second battlefront is the economy. The\r\n\r\nGovernment   is  working  with  the  Singapore   Business\r\n\r\nFederation  and business chambers to encourage businesses\r\n\r\nto  adopt  business continuity plans, so  that  they  can\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  operate  even  if  their  staff  fall  ill.\r\n\r\nSpecial  attention has been placed on essential services,\r\n\r\nsuch as utilities, to ensure uninterrupted services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the industry level, firms in the tourism trade\r\n\r\nare  working with the Singapore Tourism Board  to  devise\r\n\r\nways  to  bring  tourists back when  the  SARS  situation\r\n\r\nstabilises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important that investors and analysts\r\n\r\nunderstand the true SARS situation in Singapore, and what\r\n\r\nwe  are doing to get things under control.  Our policy is\r\n\r\nfull  and  transparent disclosure, so that  there  is  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  of  the  true  picture and people  can  trust  our\r\n\r\nstatements.   The  Ministry of Foreign Affairs  has  been\r\n\r\nbriefing the heads of foreign missions here, while EDB is\r\n\r\nin  contact  with the multi-nationals as  well  as  their\r\n\r\ncorporate  headquarters,  to keep  them  updated  on  the\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Impact of SARS on the economy</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the year, Singapore's economic\r\n\r\noutlook was mainly clouded by the impending Iraq War  and\r\n\r\nits impact on oil prices.  The war in Iraq has now ended,\r\n\r\nand  oil  prices  have  fallen,  lifting  some  of  these\r\n\r\nuncertainties.  However, SARS is now putting a strain  on\r\n\r\nour economy and creates a new and greater uncertainty for\r\n\r\nus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tourism and transport-related industries, such\r\n\r\nas  hotels, restaurants, retail, airlines, cruise  ships,\r\n\r\ntravel agents\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  taxi  services, have been most severely  hit.    Air\r\n\r\ntravel  has been reduced sharply.  Tourist arrivals  have\r\n\r\nfallen  by  61%  in the first 13 days of  April  and  are\r\n\r\nexpected to fall sharply for the second quarter of  2003.\r\n\r\nA number of events, conferences and conventions scheduled\r\n\r\nfor  April  and  May  this year have  been  cancelled  or\r\n\r\npostponed. China, which is our fastest growing source  of\r\n\r\ntourist   arrivals  before  the  outbreak,   has   banned\r\n\r\norganised  travel  to Singapore, Malaysia  and  Thailand.\r\n\r\nArrivals  from  Japan, South Korea  and  Hong  Kong  have\r\n\r\ndeclined sharply.  I was in one hotel a few days ago  and\r\n\r\nI  talked  to a worker there, and he said, \"We have  five\r\n\r\nlifts.  Three are closed.  There is nobody to ride up and\r\n\r\ndown.   We  are  only operating two to save  electricity.\r\n\r\nThe  workers  have been put on leave.  When  their  leave\r\n\r\nruns  out,  they  will be asked to go on  no-pay  leave.\"\r\n\r\nTimes are tough for the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the manufacturing sector has not been\r\n\r\naffected.   But if the SARS situation deteriorates in the\r\n\r\nregion  or  in  the major industrial countries,  it  will\r\n\r\naffect our export markets and important trading partners.\r\n\r\nIt  could shake global confidence, and disrupt production\r\n\r\nand  new  investments.  Then the impact  on  us  will  be\r\n\r\nbroader-based, and more severe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot predict exactly how the situation will\r\n\r\nunfold,  but MTI has lowered the GDP growth forecast  for\r\n\r\nthis  year  to  0.5% to 2.5%.  This is on the  assumption\r\n\r\nthat the outbreak does not spread worldwide and become  a\r\n\r\nglobal  pandemic.  The unemployment rate is  expected  to\r\n\r\nincrease  beyond the 4.2% last December.  While  we  will\r\n\r\ntry  to  preserve as many jobs as possible,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nexpect  more retrenchments this year, especially  in  the\r\n\r\ntourism and transport-related sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Relief measures</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises the economic hardship\r\n\r\nbrought  about by SARS.  To help alleviate the  immediate\r\n\r\nproblems,  we  announced on 17th April a  relief  package\r\n\r\nworth $230 million.  These\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmeasures  were targeted at the sectors most  affected  by\r\n\r\nthe  SARS  outbreak, namely, the tourism  and  transport-related sectors.  The measures will not fully offset  the\r\n\r\nimpact on these businesses, but they will help them  tide\r\n\r\nover   the  difficult  period  and  save  jobs,  wherever\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Home Quarantine Allowance Scheme</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another group who need help. People who\r\n\r\nhave  been  placed under Home Quarantine  Orders  (HQOs),\r\n\r\nhave  so  far not been given any allowance or assistance.\r\n\r\nWe  have  left  it  to employers to work  out  their  own\r\n\r\narrangements, for instance, by putting employees on  HQOs\r\n\r\non  medical  leave.   As  the HQO  cases  were  initially\r\n\r\ndispersed and the number manageable, this did not pose  a\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the closure of the Pasir Panjang Wholesale\r\n\r\nCentre  and  the  imposition  of  HQOs  on  about   2,400\r\n\r\nstallholders and workers at the Centre showed  that  HQOs\r\n\r\nmay  need  to be imposed on large numbers when a business\r\n\r\nestablishment  is ordered to shut.  Furthermore,  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can mitigate the financial burden of the  HQOs\r\n\r\non  the quarantined persons, it will reduce the incentive\r\n\r\nfor  people  to  breach  the HQO  in  order  to  continue\r\n\r\nworking.   Also,  people  will  be  more  willing  to  be\r\n\r\nidentified  and quarantined when they are traced  as  the\r\n\r\ncontacts of a SARS case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will therefore implement a Home\r\n\r\nQuarantine Order Allowance Scheme, to be administered  by\r\n\r\nthe  CDCs.  Under the scheme, the Government will pay  an\r\n\r\nallowance to self-employed persons who are serving  HQOs,\r\n\r\nto  make up part of their income.  It will also give  the\r\n\r\nallowance  to  establishments whose employees  have  been\r\n\r\naffected by HQOs.  In other words, if you are working for\r\n\r\na  company,  then  we will pay the HQO allowance  to  the\r\n\r\ncompany who is paying your salary.  This will defray part\r\n\r\nof  their manpower costs for the duration of the HQO.  It\r\n\r\nwill  be especially helpful to smaller businesses,  which\r\n\r\nmay otherwise be unable to survive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a small business establishment, in other words,\r\n\r\none with fewer than 50\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfull-time  workers, the assistance will be more generous.\r\n\r\nIf  the  whole  establishment is ordered to  shut  for  a\r\n\r\nperiod  on  account of SARS, then the firm  will  receive\r\n\r\nthis  ex-gratia payment for all its employees,  including\r\n\r\nthose  who are not on HQOs.  Because the firm is  closed,\r\n\r\nit  has to carry its manpower costs; and we will help  it\r\n\r\nto  carry  some  of these.  The cut-off of  50  full-time\r\n\r\nworkers  covers  more than 90% of business establishments\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For self-employed persons, the allowance will be a\r\n\r\nflat  rate of $70 per day, for the duration of  the  HQO.\r\n\r\nFor employees, the allowance will be his daily salary, up\r\n\r\nto  a maximum of $70 per day.  The allowance will be paid\r\n\r\nto  the  employer.  We will leave it to the employers  to\r\n\r\nmake   their   own  financial  arrangements  with   their\r\n\r\nemployees.  However, newly arrived work-pass holders  who\r\n\r\nare  required to undergo a 10-day quarantine will not  be\r\n\r\neligible for the HQO Allowance.  This allowance will also\r\n\r\nbe payable to all persons previously or currently already\r\n\r\non home quarantine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the HQO Allowance Scheme, the Government\r\n\r\nwill  be  bearing  a good part of the wage  cost  of  the\r\n\r\nbusinesses  affected.  MOF will provide full  details  of\r\n\r\nthis scheme later on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Specific Issues</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address specific economic issues raised\r\n\r\nby the MPs in their questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rental rebates</i>: Mr Gan Kim Yong asked about rental\r\n\r\nrebates  for HDB commercial tenants.  All HDB  commercial\r\n\r\ntenants  are  already enjoying a 20% rental  rebate  that\r\n\r\nlasts  until  31st  December this  year.   These  include\r\n\r\noperators  of  student  care  centres,  tuition  centres,\r\n\r\nchildcare  centres  and  kindergartens.   Some  are  also\r\n\r\nreceiving  additional rebate of up to 20% to bring  their\r\n\r\nrents  down to the prevailing market rent.  In  addition,\r\n\r\nHDB will pass on to its tenants the full savings from the\r\n\r\nrecently  announced  property  tax  rebates.   HDB   will\r\n\r\nmonitor the situation closely and will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconsider   providing   additional   assistance   to   its\r\n\r\ncommercial tenants, if necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Giro instalments for property tax</i>: Mr Chiam See\r\n\r\nTong  asked  whether  property  tax  could  be  paid   by\r\n\r\ninstalments.   The  answer is yes.  Taxpayers  have  been\r\n\r\nable to pay their annual property tax in 12 interest-free\r\n\r\nmonthly instalments since 1989, provided they do  it  via\r\n\r\nGIRO.   More  than  50% of taxpayers are  already  taking\r\n\r\nadvantage  of GIRO to pay their property tax  in  monthly\r\n\r\ninstalments, and the Government encourages more to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Indebtedness of Singaporean households</i>: Madam Ho\r\n\r\nGeok Choo asked about the indebtedness of households.   A\r\n\r\nstudy  by  the  Department  of  Statistics  showed   that\r\n\r\nhousehold financial liabilities have increased from  118%\r\n\r\nof  personal disposable income in 1995 to 174%  in  2000.\r\n\r\nIf  the  economic  downturn  continues,  it  could  lower\r\n\r\ndisposable  income  and  further increase  the  ratio  of\r\n\r\nhousehold financial liabilities to income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have to view this ratio in perspective.\r\n\r\nFirst,  72% of the liabilities are in the form of housing\r\n\r\nloans.   This  reflects  the high  housing  ownership  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  which is 92% compared to 60% to  70%  in  the\r\n\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, residential property assets, even after\r\n\r\naccounting  for the weak property prices, stood  at  $343\r\n\r\nbillion  in 2001.  Compared to housing mortgage loans  of\r\n\r\n$106 billion, households still own about $237 billion  of\r\n\r\nnet  housing assets - a huge amount.  If we include other\r\n\r\nhousehold  wealth, such as bank savings and  shares,  the\r\n\r\ntotal  net  wealth  of  households  represents  670%   of\r\n\r\ndisposable income, which is comparable to OECD countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, most households service their housing\r\n\r\nloans  through  their CPF savings and contributions.   So\r\n\r\nlong  as  they keep their jobs, the impact is manageable.\r\n\r\nThis is why the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is trying  its\r\n\r\nbest  to  minimise job losses, through enhanced  training\r\n\r\ngrants, skills upgrading and other measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Retail sector</i>: Ms Olivia Lum asked about measures\r\n\r\nto help the retail sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nDomestic  consumption has been affected  as  the  initial\r\n\r\nfear  of  SARS has kept consumers away from  all  crowded\r\n\r\nplaces, including retail shops and restaurants.  However,\r\n\r\nnot all retail outlets are equally badly affected.  And I\r\n\r\nbelieve, as confidence gradually returns, the restaurants\r\n\r\nwill  be  filling up again.  Those outlets in HDB estates\r\n\r\nfared  better than those in the Central Business District\r\n\r\nwhich  cater  primarily to tourists.   The  property  tax\r\n\r\nrebates are intended to help such establishments,  and  I\r\n\r\nstrongly  urge property owners to pass on the rebates  to\r\n\r\ntenants.   HDB  itself will be doing  so.   These  retail\r\n\r\noutlets can also send their workers for training and make\r\n\r\nuse  of  the  absentee payroll scheme  for  MOM  and  STB\r\n\r\napproved courses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Battlefront 3 - The Society</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third battlefront against SARS is in our\r\n\r\nsociety,  the  way  each  Singaporean  responds  to   the\r\n\r\nproblem, and cooperates with the measures which will help\r\n\r\nus  to  solve it.  This is the most critical battlefront.\r\n\r\nIf we lose this front, we will lose all the other fronts,\r\n\r\nand lose the war.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government is doing everything possible. But for\r\n\r\nthese policies and measures to succeed, every Singaporean\r\n\r\nmust play his or her part.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support the public health measures, all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   should   follow  the   daily   precautions\r\n\r\nrecommended  by  the  Ministry  of  Health   to   protect\r\n\r\nourselves  and  those around us.  We need  to  be  keenly\r\n\r\naware  of  our  social responsibility  to  our  families,\r\n\r\nfriends and fellow citizens, in containing the spread  of\r\n\r\nSARS.   See a doctor if you are unwell, telling  him  the\r\n\r\ntruth,  and  heeding his advice.  Go  to  Tan  Tock  Seng\r\n\r\nHospital  if  you suspect that you have contracted  SARS,\r\n\r\nand  abide  by the Home Quarantine Orders if you  are  in\r\n\r\nquarantine.  Do not travel to SARS-affected areas, unless\r\n\r\nyou  really cannot help it.  Take personal responsibility\r\n\r\nto  measure your own temperature and the temperatures  of\r\n\r\nyour family daily.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with the economic problem, we also need to\r\n\r\nwork  together.  The tripartite partners have rallied  to\r\n\r\nhelp  affected companies stay viable and preserve as many\r\n\r\njobs  as  possible.   The  NTUC, the  Singapore  National\r\n\r\nEmployers  Federation and the Ministry of  Manpower  have\r\n\r\nissued  a  joint  statement recommending  temporary  cost\r\n\r\nreduction  measures,  including  a  shorter  work   week,\r\n\r\nlayoffs and wage cuts.  They have also acknowledged that,\r\n\r\ndespite these measures, retrenchments will be unavoidable\r\n\r\nin the tourism and transport-related sectors, and advised\r\n\r\nemployers  to  treat  fairly  workers  who  have  to   be\r\n\r\nretrenched.   This  realistic and  constructive  approach\r\n\r\nwill  help  companies to stay afloat, and  help  as  many\r\n\r\nworkers as possible to keep their jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One group that is bearing the heaviest burden is our\r\n\r\ndoctors  and  healthcare  workers.   They  are   on   the\r\n\r\nfrontline of the fight against SARS.  Despite their heavy\r\n\r\nworkload, the extreme stress, and the risk that they  are\r\n\r\nexposed  to  daily,  they have not compromised  on  their\r\n\r\nprofessionalism or their dedication to duty.  We can  all\r\n\r\nbe  proud  that  in  such  a difficult  situation,  these\r\n\r\ndoctors, nurses and hospital attendants, who include non-Singaporeans,  have  shown  the  steadfast  courage   and\r\n\r\ncommitment  to  do their best to overcome  this  national\r\n\r\nproblem.  They are an inspiration to all of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Courage Fund is a tangible way for Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  show their support for the healthcare workers.  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  that  all  Members of this House will  join  me  in\r\n\r\nadding  our gratitude and support to the sentiments  that\r\n\r\nhave  been  expressed publicly by many Singaporeans  over\r\n\r\nthe   last   few  weeks.   But,  more  importantly,   the\r\n\r\nhealthcare workers need our cooperation, because  whether\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs  become easier or harder in the coming  weeks\r\n\r\nand months, depends on whether everyone is doing his part\r\n\r\nto contain the spread of the virus.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SARS will be a long-term problem for us. Now that\r\n\r\nit  has  spread to so many countries, scientists  believe\r\n\r\nthat it is not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be  eradicated  from  the  world.   We   have\r\n\r\ninstituted effective measures to contain the outbreak  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  As we discover more about the virus, we  will\r\n\r\nmodify and improve the arrangements to minimise the  risk\r\n\r\nof  infection.  But every Singaporean must adopt sensible\r\n\r\nprecautions   and  socially  responsible  habits,   while\r\n\r\ncarrying  on  with our normal day-to-day activities.   We\r\n\r\nhave to learn as one society to cope with the virus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life will not be the same as it was before SARS. We\r\n\r\nmust  adjust our habits and behaviour patterns so  as  to\r\n\r\ntackle   this  new  threat  and  adapt  to  the   changed\r\n\r\nenvironment.  Doing this [indicating] - Nemeste,  instead\r\n\r\nof   a   handshake  -  that  is  easy.    Watching   your\r\n\r\ntemperature,   keeping  yourself  healthy;   sequestering\r\n\r\nyourself,  if  you are not - that takes more  discipline.\r\n\r\nBut  with precautions and changes in habits which protect\r\n\r\nourselves  and  especially  other  Singaporeans,  we  can\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  make a living, bring up our  families,  and\r\n\r\nmaintain our social and community activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SARS is a grave challenge. But we have an effective\r\n\r\npublic  service,  a cohesive and cooperative  population,\r\n\r\nand  the  resources  to deal with the  problem.   We  are\r\n\r\nmobilising all these to tackle SARS.  I am confident that\r\n\r\ntogether   we   can   overcome  this   problem,   restore\r\n\r\nconfidence,  and  get  Singapore back  to  normal  again.\r\n\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>QUESTIONS ON THE MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister for Health\r\n\r\nwhether  the outbreak in SGH in the first week  of  April\r\n\r\ncould have been averted?

Because I understand\r\n\r\nthat,  right now, it is only done in the English language\r\n\r\nand  I  believe that many of the people who  receive  the\r\n\r\nHQOs are the older people who may not understand English.\r\n\r\nLooking  at the HQO, I also notice that, when  a  HQO  is\r\n\r\nissued,  it  is stipulated that school-going children  or\r\n\r\nyoung  siblings  would not be allowed to leave  the  home\r\n\r\nduring the period of quarantine.  But, on the other hand,\r\n\r\nthe  spouse  or  any other adults in the  home  would  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to leave.  Could he explain to us the difference\r\n\r\nin  the  treatment of the younger ones at  home  and  the\r\n\r\nadults?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a condition which says that when a\r\n\r\nworkman  comes to the house to carry out work within  the\r\n\r\npremises, they should be alerted that the person has been\r\n\r\nserved  with  a  HQO  so that the workman  can  take  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  precautions.   I am  just  wondering  whether,\r\n\r\nduring  a  time like this, when someone has  been  served\r\n\r\nwith  a  HQO, they should in fact allow anyone  into  the\r\n\r\nhome or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I have got a few questions as well.  On this  fight\r\n\r\nagainst SARS, or the SARS war, may I ask the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister how much longer is needed to solve this  problem\r\n\r\nover time.  He says it is a long haul.  But how long will\r\n\r\nthis long haul be?  All these measures that we are doing,\r\n\r\nin terms of temperature taking, checking at airports, and\r\n\r\nso  on,  will it be something which will stay for  a  few\r\n\r\nmore years or it might be overcome in a few months?   The\r\n\r\nreason  I  ask  is  because I think it is  good  to  give\r\n\r\nSingaporeans a good sense of how these things  are  going\r\n\r\nto affect their lives in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on all the measures being taken, I must\r\n\r\nfirst  say  that I do support all these measures  because\r\n\r\nthey are very important.  But is there also a danger that\r\n\r\nwe are over-reacting?  It seems that Singapore takes this\r\n\r\nmatter  very  seriously.   In contrast  with  many  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  some  countries are  quite  blase  about  the\r\n\r\nmatter  and  do  not  really seem to be  taking  it  that\r\n\r\nseriously as compared to Singapore.  Therefore,  even  in\r\n\r\ncontrast to the number of SARS incidents in Singapore per\r\n\r\npopulation, we seem to have a very high incident rate  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Is there a particular reason for this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a question on temperature taking for fever.\r\n\r\nI  think I have heard a lot being said about the checking\r\n\r\nof  persons through the thermometer for fever.  Is  it  a\r\n\r\nvery  safe measure?  How sure are we that having no fever\r\n\r\nwill mean that the person is not contagious, he will  not\r\n\r\ncarry  the virus and therefore will not spread  to  other\r\n\r\npeople?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> I would also like to ask the\r\n\r\nGovernment whether, in implementing the various measures,\r\n\r\nwe  have  taken human psychology into consideration.   To\r\n\r\nme,  Sir,  it seems that all the measures depend  on  two\r\n\r\nfactors:  one,  public spiritedness of the citizens,  and\r\n\r\nsecond,  by  penalty, in other words,  punishment.   But,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  it  not  true that there are  individuals  who,\r\n\r\nthrough  self-denial, will go to all extent to  say  that\r\n\r\nthey  do  not have SARS, and to be sent to Tan Tock  Seng\r\n\r\nHospital seems to them to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  sentence or label that they will try to avoid  at  all\r\n\r\ncosts?    Perhaps,  the  Government  should   also   have\r\n\r\nconsidered  human  psychology in this  respect  by  going\r\n\r\nthrough  better publicity to show the recovery  rates  of\r\n\r\npatients from Tan Tock Seng Hospital so that going to Tan\r\n\r\nTock  Seng Hospital is not considered a death penalty  or\r\n\r\nsentence.  That, I believe, is pretty important as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I beg your indulgence here also to express my\r\n\r\npersonal  tribute  to the healthcare  workers  for  their\r\n\r\nsacrifice in this battle against SARS.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, I have\r\n\r\nthree  questions  for  the  Health  Minister.   Two  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  so  far have been infected with  SARS  by  their\r\n\r\npassengers.   Can  I  ask the Minister  that,  since  the\r\n\r\nambulance  service  was introduced to  transport  suspect\r\n\r\nSARS patients to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, have members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public been ready to come forward to call  for  this\r\n\r\nservice  and to use it?  And how prompt is the  ambulance\r\n\r\ncoming  to  pick  up  the suspect  SARS  patients?   From\r\n\r\nreading  the press reports, it would seem that they  take\r\n\r\nseveral hours to come and that is why the family of eight\r\n\r\nwent  to the coffeeshop to have some drinks and then went\r\n\r\nto  a Chinese herbal medicine store, causing the risk  of\r\n\r\ninfection  to  the  community.  And, third,  I  share  Dr\r\n\r\nWang's concern that the public has this fear of Tan  Tock\r\n\r\nSeng  Hospital.  Can I ask the Minister  to  do  more  to\r\n\r\nallay the concerns on the ground about going to Tan  Tock\r\n\r\nSeng Hospital?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> I would like to\r\n\r\njoin Dr Wang in asking about the treatment of patients at\r\n\r\nTan Tock Seng Hospital.  I think there are some people in\r\n\r\nSingapore  who fear being sent to Tan Tock Seng  Hospital\r\n\r\nnow  because they think it is like a death sentence.   So\r\n\r\nit  will  be good if we can inform the public  about  how\r\n\r\npatients  are  treated there.  If they are not  infected,\r\n\r\nthey  will remain uninfected if they go to Tan Tock  Seng\r\n\r\nHospital and get out well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Health is if he could\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalso  enlighten us on the measures that have been put  in\r\n\r\nplace  to  help minimise the inconvenience of  those  who\r\n\r\nhave been served with Home Quarantine Orders.  I think so\r\n\r\nfar  the plight and also the sacrifice of many healthcare\r\n\r\nworkers  have  been  highlighted but not  much  has  been\r\n\r\nreported  or conveyed on the measures that have been  put\r\n\r\nin   place  to  help  those  who  are  served  with  Home\r\n\r\nQuarantine Orders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would also like to take this opportunity\r\n\r\nto  not  only thank the healthcare workers but  also  all\r\n\r\nthose  who  have been put in the frontline to help  fight\r\n\r\nthis battle against SARS, including the Minister, as well\r\n\r\nas  all  the  Government officials  and  those  who  have\r\n\r\nactually contributed to the Courage Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, DPM Lee has said that the\r\n\r\nGovernment is going flat out to develop a diagnostic test\r\n\r\nkit.   Sir, I am asking whether the Government is willing\r\n\r\nto  give  a  prize  or reward to the  first  person  that\r\n\r\ndevelops  this kit, in addition to his normal salary.   I\r\n\r\nthink this is an incentive needed because I think time is\r\n\r\nof the essence as far as SARS is concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, mention also has been made of the super-infector. Now that her name has been revealed by MOH and\r\n\r\nalso   published  in  the  papers,  with   such   adverse\r\n\r\npublicity,  I am certain that her life must  be  affected\r\n\r\nbadly.

On the second question: why limit\r\n\r\nthe Home Quarantine Order allowance scheme to only 50% of\r\n\r\nthe person's income?  Is this not a case of war against a\r\n\r\nvirus when the HQO is similar to the issue of the SAF-100\r\n\r\ncalling people out for national duty and that they should\r\n\r\nbe  fully compensated, instead of 50% of their salary, or\r\n\r\n$70  for  self-employed individuals?  Can we  follow  the\r\n\r\nclaims practice similar to the SAF when people are called\r\n\r\nup  for National Service to do make-up pay claim, so that\r\n\r\nthey get the full compensation rather than 50% of it?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> I have three\r\n\r\nquestions for the Deputy Prime Minister.

The  first  pertains to  the  Pasir  Panjang\r\n\r\nWholesale Centre.  The livelihood of the wholesalers  and\r\n\r\nthe  workers  there  has  been quite  badly  hit  by  the\r\n\r\nshutdown.   I would like to know whether, in addition  to\r\n\r\nthe Home Quarantine Order allowance and some of the other\r\n\r\nmeasures,  there  is  specific assistance  available  for\r\n\r\nthese wholesalers and their workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question pertains to the broader economic\r\n\r\nimpact.   The  DPM  has  announced  the  revised   growth\r\n\r\nestimates  and there has been a package of measures  that\r\n\r\nhas  been  announced.   This  is  obviously  premised  on\r\n\r\ncertain assumptions of the intensity and duration of  the\r\n\r\nSARS  virus impact on the economy.  May I ask, especially\r\n\r\nin  the light of some of the announcements from Hong Kong\r\n\r\non  their  measures  which appear to be  of  far  greater\r\n\r\nassistance, when or at what\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npoint would the Government deem it appropriate to revisit\r\n\r\nthe  issue  of  further  Government  assistance  for  the\r\n\r\neconomy?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask DPM\r\n\r\nwhether consideration may be given towards providing some\r\n\r\nform of residential facility for those who are unable  to\r\n\r\ntake  home quarantine perhaps because they are renting  a\r\n\r\nroom, or for those who repeatedly seem to have difficulty\r\n\r\nkeeping their Home Quarantine Orders?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike   to  ask  the  Minister  a  question  on  the  Home\r\n\r\nQuarantine  Order.  Presently, under the Home  Quarantine\r\n\r\nOrder, a person who is quarantined, the children are  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to  go out of the home, but the spousal  members\r\n\r\nare  allowed to.  In a situation when the Home Quarantine\r\n\r\nOrders are very limited or small in number, I think  that\r\n\r\nmakes  sense, because we have to balance the economy  and\r\n\r\nactivity  going  on.   But  when  the  number   of   Home\r\n\r\nQuarantine  Orders is 2,000-plus, as it is  now,  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  adult members of the family going about their work,\r\n\r\nis  there not quite a high possibility that there may  be\r\n\r\nsome cases which might lead to infection or to situations\r\n\r\nwhich  may not be truly watertight, as mentioned  by  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister just now?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I have a few\r\n\r\nquestions.

While we have been very effective\r\n\r\nin  all  the measures - and I think we have done all  the\r\n\r\nright  things  - the signal that this is sending  to  the\r\n\r\ninternational  community is that we  have  a  very,  very\r\n\r\nserious problem, compared to many others who may  not  be\r\n\r\ndoing  as  much as us.  So, we really need  to  do  a  PR\r\n\r\nexercise to rebuild the confidence once again for  people\r\n\r\nto have confidence to do business in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question, Sir, is one concerning people\r\n\r\nfrom SARS-affected areas.  Many residents have brought up\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nissue  as  to  why  we  have  not  been  so  decisive  in\r\n\r\nrestricting the entry of people from countries  that  are\r\n\r\nseverely affected, particularly from the various  regions\r\n\r\nin  China where we do not even know the severity  of  the\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question, specifically for the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Health,  is:  in  case children  are  affected,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  that has been raised to some of us  is  whether\r\n\r\nparents   will  be  allowed  to  visit  their   children,\r\n\r\nparticularly the very small ones.

To what extent  is  this\r\n\r\nnecessary  and how far do we go in determining the  level\r\n\r\nof  the  need to break up into two groups?  For  example,\r\n\r\nthe CDC is thinking of doing that.

In view of what has happened in\r\n\r\nthe  Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre, I would like to know\r\n\r\nwhether we should take steps to relocate our stockpile of\r\n\r\nrice  to  different locations, because I understand  that\r\n\r\nall  our rice is situated in one locality.  Would  it  be\r\n\r\nprudent for us to take some steps to ensure that, in case\r\n\r\nthere  is a repetition of what has happened in the  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang Wholesale Centre, our supply of rice would not be\r\n\r\naffected?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I have relates to a report which\r\n\r\nI  read in the newspapers a few days ago.  It quoted  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Trade and Industry as having said that  some\r\n\r\nheadway  has  been made in the progress  in  negotiations\r\n\r\nwith the Chinese authorities to allow Chinese tour groups\r\n\r\nto  come  to Singapore again.  Sir, I know we  are  in  a\r\n\r\ndilemma  over  this.   On the one hand,  we  need  to  do\r\n\r\nsomething  to boost the tourism sector to fill our  hotel\r\n\r\nrooms and to allow our retail shops to have more business\r\n\r\nbut,  on the other hand, I am just wondering whether this\r\n\r\nis really the right time to push for more Chinese tourist\r\n\r\narrivals,  in  view of the fact that China is  accounting\r\n\r\nfor  more  than half of the SARS cases around the  world.\r\n\r\nAnd here, we are talking about quarantining newly-arrived\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.

I would\r\n\r\nlike to ask whether we should carry this psychological PR\r\n\r\nwar  to  the  international  media  so  that  we  present\r\n\r\nourselves  as  doing everything we can  and  keeping  the\r\n\r\nsituation under control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we all know that PRC is a very significant\r\n\r\nsource  of  infection.  I would like to know whether  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Government,  as  well  as  the  international\r\n\r\ncommunity,   can  do  more  to  impress  upon   the   PRC\r\n\r\nauthorities to take extraordinary efforts to control  and\r\n\r\ncontain  this spread.  Because whatever we  do  here,  if\r\n\r\nmore come from overseas, particularly from China, we have\r\n\r\nthis going on and on, we will have great difficulties.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask whether we could share whatever we know\r\n\r\nin  Singapore with the PRC authorities as well  as  other\r\n\r\nASEAN countries which we intend to do soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Sir, DPM has\r\n\r\nmentioned  that  if the situation does not  improve,  the\r\n\r\nunemployment situation will get worse.  At this point  in\r\n\r\ntime,  for  those  industries that  have  been  affected,\r\n\r\nbesides  looking at the cost-cutting measures,  would  we\r\n\r\nalso want to urge the Government and the employers to  do\r\n\r\nmore to see how we can actually enhance the employability\r\n\r\nof  this  group  of workers?

I have a question for DPM Lee, and that  is,\r\n\r\nin  view  of  the  downturn, especially  in  the  service\r\n\r\nsector,  is there any consideration for us to re-look  at\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  contributions by employers, perhaps a reduction\r\n\r\nduring  this period?  This is because I remember  an  old\r\n\r\nlady  telling  me  once that if you  do  not  have  fresh\r\n\r\nvegetables  to  eat  daily,  why  think  of  drying   and\r\n\r\npreserving\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvegetables.

In  trying\r\n\r\nto  boost our psychological defence in this area, I agree\r\n\r\nwith some of the hon. Members about the public perception\r\n\r\nand  the  kind  of  information that they  are  receiving\r\n\r\nregarding  two  very important critical  aspects  of  our\r\n\r\ncontainment   and  isolation  policies,  ie,   the   Home\r\n\r\nQuarantine Orders.  We get a glimpse of some of the  SOPs\r\n\r\nthat  have  been put in place, but to the lay person  and\r\n\r\nthe  neighbours,  it is still not very  clear  what  home\r\n\r\nquarantine  actually means.  What we understand  is  that\r\n\r\nnot  everybody is actually put under quarantine at  home,\r\n\r\nbut  only  certain categories.  Then, would  there  be  a\r\n\r\ndanger  of cross-contamination for those who are  allowed\r\n\r\nto  leave  the  home?   But  if  you  were  to  ringfence\r\n\r\neverybody in, there is a question of daily living.  It is\r\n\r\nnot very clear how this is going to be maintained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect would be those who have to go for\r\n\r\ntreatment  in Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  We have been  told\r\n\r\nthat the earlier you go and seek treatment, the better it\r\n\r\nis.   But  after that, it is blank. Nobody  really  knows\r\n\r\nwhat  happens  in  it.  And again, as hon.  Members  have\r\n\r\nmentioned, there are the misperception and all  kinds  of\r\n\r\nrumours   and  exaggerated  horror  stories  about   what\r\n\r\nhappens.   So,  we  also  need to  know  what  would  the\r\n\r\nprogress  of the illness be like, so that it  is  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of a potential victim to say that, \"The  earlier\r\n\r\nI  go for treatment, my survival chances are better.\"  We\r\n\r\ndo not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nget  the  idea because there is no profiling of  what  it\r\n\r\nmeans  to be a patient and if your treatment is too late,\r\n\r\nwhat happens.

This  was a sudden  closure  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  recognises that because of its suddenness  it\r\n\r\nhas  affected  the business of tenants in  the  wholesale\r\n\r\ncentre.    Of  course,  the  closure  is  necessary   and\r\n\r\njustified to safeguard public health and also the  safety\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans  but, nevertheless, it  has  caused  the\r\n\r\ntenants financial loss, not to mention inconvenience  and\r\n\r\ndisruption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to recognise that it is not possible to\r\n\r\nadequately  compensate  for  such  loss  and  disruption.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  Government  will  provide  some  financial\r\n\r\nassistance to the affected tenants and workers.  First of\r\n\r\nall,  HDB  will waive the rentals for 10 days,  in  other\r\n\r\nwords,  for the full period of the closure.  Second,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will provide an ex gratia payment of $1,600 to\r\n\r\neach  tenant,  and  this is to cover  part  of  the  loss\r\n\r\narising  from  the goods that were destroyed.   When  the\r\n\r\nPasir  Panjang  Wholesale  Centre  was  closed  suddenly,\r\n\r\ntenants  were  not  allowed  to  enter  the  premises  to\r\n\r\nretrieve  their  goods.  As a result of that,  and  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of the disinfection that was carried out, most  of\r\n\r\nthe vegetables stored there\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhad  to  be  destroyed.  Finally, of course, tenants  and\r\n\r\nworkers whose incomes have been affected will be eligible\r\n\r\nfor  the  HQO  allowance which the Deputy Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nannounced earlier.  This allowance provides for up to $70\r\n\r\nper day per person.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked for an update on\r\n\r\nthe  vegetable supply situation.  Again, as a  result  of\r\n\r\nthe  closure of the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre, which\r\n\r\naccounted  for something like 70% of the total  vegetable\r\n\r\nsupply   in   Singapore,   from   Malaysia,   there   was\r\n\r\nconsiderable  disruption in the first day or  so.   Since\r\n\r\nthen, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore\r\n\r\n(AVA)  has  been  working  closely  with  the  six  major\r\n\r\nsupermarkets, as well as other distributors, which import\r\n\r\nvegetables directly, without going through Pasir  Panjang\r\n\r\nWholesale Centre, to increase their imports in  order  to\r\n\r\ncompensate  for  the  loss.  At the same  time,  AVA  has\r\n\r\nfacilitated  importers, who have been  placed  under  HQO\r\n\r\nfollowing  the closure, to make alternative  arrangements\r\n\r\nfor their vegetables to be brought in and to be delivered\r\n\r\ndirectly to their customers, without routing them through\r\n\r\nPasir Panjang Wholesale Centre.  AVA has also worked with\r\n\r\nImmigration and Customs Authority (ICA) to put  in  place\r\n\r\nprocedures to facilitate faster clearance of consignments\r\n\r\nat  the  Causeway.  In addition to that, AVA has approved\r\n\r\nadditional   suppliers  from  Malaysia  who  can   export\r\n\r\nvegetables  to Singapore.  Now, there are over  100  such\r\n\r\nsuppliers.    And  imports  of  vegetables   from   other\r\n\r\ncountries have also been stepped up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures, the re-routing of supplies\r\n\r\nthrough  supermarkets, opening up of secondary  wholesale\r\n\r\ncentres,   facilitation   of   imports   from   Malaysia,\r\n\r\nadditional suppliers, imports from other countries and so\r\n\r\non,  have resulted and contributed to an increase in  the\r\n\r\nsupply  that  is  available in the  market  today.   This\r\n\r\nmorning, I have been told that the supplies have actually\r\n\r\ngone  up  above  the  levels seen  before  Pasir  Panjang\r\n\r\nWholesale  Centre  was closed.  So, there  is  now  ample\r\n\r\nsupply of vegetables available in the market and I  would\r\n\r\nlike to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nurge  members  of  the public not to  rush  or  to  hoard\r\n\r\nvegetables  because  more  supply  will  be   coming   in\r\n\r\nregularly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the safety of the workers engaged\r\n\r\nin  transporting and selling vegetables, as  far  as  the\r\n\r\ndrivers  and  delivery  workers  are  concerned,  at  the\r\n\r\nCauseway, the AVA has now instituted special measures  to\r\n\r\nscreen  all  such workers coming in from Malaysia.   They\r\n\r\nwill  ask  for a health declaration.  They will ask  them\r\n\r\nwhether  they  have  been to the Pasir Panjang  Wholesale\r\n\r\nCentre from the 5th to 19th April.  On top of that,  they\r\n\r\nwill  take  their temperatures.  All these measures  have\r\n\r\nbeen explained to the importers, and also to my Malaysian\r\n\r\ncounterpart,  the  Minister for Agriculture.   They  have\r\n\r\nbeen  accepted.   We  need to do this  to  safeguard  the\r\n\r\nsafety  of  our  workers and the buyers involved  in  the\r\n\r\nvegetable  trade and also those involved  in  other  food\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are doing similar screening in the secondary\r\n\r\nwholesale centres which have been set up  -  the ones  in\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh,  Eunos Estate and Sin Ming.  All  these  will\r\n\r\nhelp  to ensure that the people who are working there  as\r\n\r\nwell as the supplies that are coming through are safe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as a result of the Pasir Panjang Wholesale\r\n\r\nCentre's  experience, we have also started to screen  the\r\n\r\ntemperature  of  users and visitors  to  the  Jurong  and\r\n\r\nSenoko  Fishing  Ports  and Markets,  because  a  similar\r\n\r\nsituation  in the fish market prevails.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nmost of our fish flows through these two markets.  So  we\r\n\r\nare  also taking additional safety measures in these  two\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me answer some of the\r\n\r\nquestions  belonging to MTI.  First, on the  question  of\r\n\r\nrice  stockpile, I am glad to report to Mr Tan Soo  Khoon\r\n\r\nthat,  in fact, we have a distributed network, and  there\r\n\r\nare   three   stockpiles  in  three  separate  locations,\r\n\r\nprecisely to ensure resilience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On electricity, we have switched to monthly\r\n\r\nadjustment.  Because oil prices\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  come  down, and the Iraqi oilfields have  not  been\r\n\r\ndestroyed, from next month, the electricity prices should\r\n\r\ncome down by over 10%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for water, it can be a health hazard if the water\r\n\r\nsupply  is cut off.  PUB's policy has been to thimble  it\r\n\r\ndown.  But, if after six months, the household would  not\r\n\r\npay  and would not agree to instalment payments, then  it\r\n\r\nis  cut off.  This policy is being reviewed in the  light\r\n\r\nof the SARS crisis.  In fact, PUB moved in immediately to\r\n\r\nrestore supply to 60 households to which water supply has\r\n\r\nbeen  cut  off.  So we are very mindful of the importance\r\n\r\nof water to maintain hygiene at a time like this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Khalis asked about the impact of the SARS\r\n\r\ncrisis  on  travel and tourism, and whether we  have  not\r\n\r\nbecome overly dependent on this sector.  In fact, tourism\r\n\r\nrevenue in the last 10 years has been steady, which means\r\n\r\nthat,  as  a  proportion of our GDP,  the  importance  of\r\n\r\ntourism to our economy has come down.  This does not mean\r\n\r\nthat  we do not want it to go up.  In fact, our objective\r\n\r\nis  to  try  and  jack  it up under the  Economic  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee recently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is too early to say what the long-term impact of\r\n\r\nthe  tourism  industry will be.  After September  11,  we\r\n\r\nthought  that the industry would die.  It recovered  soon\r\n\r\nenough.   After  the Bali bombing last  October,  tourism\r\n\r\nfell  to  almost  zero.   But within  a  few  months,  it\r\n\r\nrecovered.   So human beings adjust.  They do  their  own\r\n\r\nrisk assessments, precautions are taken and the flow  may\r\n\r\ncome  back.  And this is the approach we are taking  with\r\n\r\nrespect  to  our travel and tourism related  industry   -\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  down  now, so we have  got  the  emergency\r\n\r\npackage,  but  keep  the workforce as  much  as  we  can,\r\n\r\nretrain them, build safety hygiene into our products,  so\r\n\r\nthat amidst the choices that are available in the region,\r\n\r\nwe represent a superior and a safer product.  So, in this\r\n\r\nregard, I had a meeting with some of the top hoteliers in\r\n\r\nSingapore  just  last week, and we are  working  on  many\r\n\r\nthings\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntogether  to  see how we can gradually restore  foreigner\r\n\r\nconfidence in our travel and tourism industry.  From  the\r\n\r\ntime  you board SIA through Changi Airport, taxi  service\r\n\r\ninto our hotels and shopping centres, special precautions\r\n\r\nare  taken  to  ensure  a high level  of  precaution  and\r\n\r\nsafety.  All these things we will do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon asked whether we should, in fact,\r\n\r\nwelcome  Chinese tourists back into Singapore.  What  has\r\n\r\nhappened is this.  Because Malaysia quite suddenly banned\r\n\r\nChinese  tour  groups, it created a lot of  inconvenience\r\n\r\nfor  Chinese tour groups already in Singapore.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nwe  had  to help make alternative arrangements for  them.\r\n\r\nSince  then, we have been in discussion with the  Chinese\r\n\r\nNational Tourism Authority to see whether we can  address\r\n\r\nthe  specific  problems.  They are thinking  of  resuming\r\n\r\neither Singapore tours or Singapore-Thailand tours.   But\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore-Malaysia-Thailand  tours  are  no  longer\r\n\r\npossible  because of the actions the Malaysian government\r\n\r\nhas taken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also told us that they are very mindful - and\r\n\r\nthis was before the sacking of the Health Minister  -  of\r\n\r\nthe  healthcare  risk that they pose to  us.   So  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant that throughout Asia, in the affected areas, we\r\n\r\ntalk  to each other and we check outbound travellers  and\r\n\r\nthey   check  outbound  travellers.   We  check   inbound\r\n\r\ntravellers  and  they check inbound travellers.   And  in\r\n\r\nthis  way, we do not stop cross-border travel but protect\r\n\r\nourselves, and reduce the risks which are involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very crucial at a time like this that while we\r\n\r\nshould over-react on the side of caution and safety,   we\r\n\r\nshould not do unnecessary damage to our economy.   It  is\r\n\r\nto   be  expected  that  because  of  reporting  in   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  and on television, because of the  repetition\r\n\r\nof  certain  images, people who are not so familiar  with\r\n\r\nSingapore  get  a  distorted  picture.   So,   from   the\r\n\r\nbeginning,  MTI took the position that it is crucial  for\r\n\r\nour economic agencies to put out accurate information  to\r\n\r\nall our clients, and EDB and IE Singapore have been doing\r\n\r\nthis  on  a daily basis.  And this has created a  certain\r\n\r\nlevel of trust.  Not only have we been in contact with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  people  here,  the Chairman of  EDB  has  also  been\r\n\r\nwriting letters directly to the CEOs in the headquarters.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this, among the important account holders,\r\n\r\nthere remains a high level of trust in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night, as I was going through my e-mail, I\r\n\r\nreceived a note from EDB saying that the American Chamber\r\n\r\nof Commerce in Singapore will soon be issuing a statement\r\n\r\npraising  us  for  the  efforts that  we  have  made  and\r\n\r\nexpressing their full confidence in the precautions  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  taken  to safeguard the health  and  safety  of\r\n\r\nAmericans in Singapore, and affirming their commitment to\r\n\r\ncontinue to do business here.   In fact, tomorrow  night,\r\n\r\nStanchart  will  be carrying on with the celebrations  of\r\n\r\nits   150th  anniversary.   The  Chairman,  Sir   Patrick\r\n\r\nGillman,  and  other top executives  will  be  here,  and\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister will be speaking.  So, these things  are\r\n\r\ncontinuing,  and that is because when we  say  something,\r\n\r\nthey believe us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night, Members would have heard that Toronto\r\n\r\nhas  now gone on to the same list as Hong Kong, Guangzhou\r\n\r\nand  Beijing,  and that is very serious.   The  Mayor  is\r\n\r\nhopping  mad.  But WHO sees Singapore as a very important\r\n\r\ndemonstration  of  what can be done and  what  should  be\r\n\r\ndone.  German Chancellor Schroeder is continuing with his\r\n\r\nvisit to Singapore and other countries in South East Asia\r\n\r\nnext month.  So, if bit by bit, we restore confidence  by\r\n\r\nwhat  we are doing, then the tourists and travellers will\r\n\r\ncome here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just before I came here, I received a fax message\r\n\r\nfrom the Chairman of EDB of a letter just written to  him\r\n\r\nby  an  American company.  Because I have not cleared  it\r\n\r\nwith him in advance, I should not mention the name of the\r\n\r\ncompany,  but it is an electro-chemical company based  in\r\n\r\nNew  York.   Mr  Teo  Ming Kian had  sent  him  a  letter\r\n\r\nupdating  him  on the SARS situation, and he  wrote  back\r\n\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Thank you for the update. We understand that it is\r\n\r\nextremely  difficult but we are very  encouraged  by  the\r\n\r\nresponse of the Singapore Government to this crisis.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  last  paragraph of his letter is something  that  we\r\n\r\nshould think about.  He said:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"By the way, it occurred to me that Singapore's\r\n\r\ndecisive  and  effective handling of this serious  crisis\r\n\r\nmay    ultimately   result   in   significant    economic\r\n\r\nopportunities for Singapore in the future.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a time like this when we are in an emergency, he tells\r\n\r\nus this.  He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I believe that many US companies will hesitate\r\n\r\nbefore  investing  serious money in countries  which  are\r\n\r\neither unwilling or unable to properly deal with a crisis\r\n\r\nof  this  nature,  that  investment  may  instead  go  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  where there is a high degree of confidence  in\r\n\r\nthe Government and its willingness and ability to protect\r\n\r\nits  citizens  as well as many major foreign investments.\r\n\r\nI,  for  one, will think more than twice about  investing\r\n\r\nmillions   of  dollars  of  my  shareholders'  money   in\r\n\r\ncountries  where  the government is either  unwilling  or\r\n\r\nunable   to   protect  the  investment.   I  would   have\r\n\r\nabsolutely no hesitation in investing significant amounts\r\n\r\nof  additional money in Singapore.  As a matter of  fact,\r\n\r\nwe  are in the process of doing just that right now as we\r\n\r\nspeak.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat  cheered me up.  I showed it to Mah Bow Tan and  Yeo\r\n\r\nCheow  Tong  who were sitting next to me just  now.   And\r\n\r\nsince  Inderjit Singh raised this issue a moment  ago,  I\r\n\r\nthought  I  should  read  the last  paragraph  to  remind\r\n\r\nourselves that we should pull out all stops to solve this\r\n\r\ncrisis,  and  if  we  do  not  lose  our  nerves,  if  we\r\n\r\nconcentrate on what we have got to do and have an eye  on\r\n\r\nthe  medium and long term, then I think we will come  out\r\n\r\nof it ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\naddress  a point that Ms Braema raised regarding  foreign\r\n\r\nstudents.   Foreign students who come to our institutions\r\n\r\nfrom  SARS affected countries and travelled recently  are\r\n\r\nasked  to take leave of absence for 10 days, after  their\r\n\r\nreturn  before they are allowed to join the institutions.\r\n\r\nThis   happens   in   our   schools,   universities   and\r\n\r\npolytechnics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards hostels, what happens is this. If a\r\n\r\nforeign student arrives from a SARS affected country,  he\r\n\r\nwill undergo a medical check-up and we will house him  in\r\n\r\nan  outside  facility  for 10 days  and  he  has  another\r\n\r\nmedical  check-up before he is allowed to join the  other\r\n\r\nhostelites in the hostel.  And within the hostels,  there\r\n\r\nis  a daily temperature taking regime, and those who  are\r\n\r\nunwell  are asked to see a doctor.  There is a  sick  bay\r\n\r\nwhere  they  can  rest separately from the  rest  of  the\r\n\r\nhostelites.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a need for a Home Quarantine Order for\r\n\r\none  of  the  hostelites, because he went to  some  other\r\n\r\nplace  and  as a result of that he is subject to  a  Home\r\n\r\nQuarantine  Order, then we have outside facilities  where\r\n\r\nwe  can house these hostelites separately from the others\r\n\r\nin the hostel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin asked about the measures in schools and\r\n\r\ninstitutes  of  higher learning.  As  Members  know,  the\r\n\r\nschools  have taken a number of measures after they  have\r\n\r\nreopened over the last few weeks to try to ensure that as\r\n\r\nfar as possible, only those students who are well are  in\r\n\r\nschool.  So there is temperature screening routine.   The\r\n\r\nstudents  have  to  make  declarations  of  their  travel\r\n\r\nhistory and they should declare whether they have had any\r\n\r\noccasion  to  go to some of these places where  they  may\r\n\r\nhave  come into contact with SARS patients.  In the event\r\n\r\nthat  any student does become sick outside of school,  he\r\n\r\nshould  not  come to school and therefore the chances  of\r\n\r\ngetting  ill  as  a  result of coming into  contact  with\r\n\r\nsomeone  who is ill in school is minimal.  And  with  the\r\n\r\ntwice   daily   temperature  taking  routine   with   the\r\n\r\nthermometer that is issued to every student, teacher  and\r\n\r\nstaff  member, as soon as a student has a fever, he  will\r\n\r\nbe  picked  up very quickly and he will be isolated,  and\r\n\r\nthe chances of any infection will be minimised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the institutes of higher learning, the\r\n\r\npolytechnics  and  universities are now  in  the  reading\r\n\r\nperiod  before the examinations.  So there  are  no  mass\r\n\r\nclasses going on.  But in any case, the universities  and\r\n\r\npolytechnics  will take precautions for the examinations.\r\n\r\nAnd  as the Deputy Prime Minister has indicated just now,\r\n\r\nthey  have  developed plans to zone the universities  and\r\n\r\npolytechnics  and  to  try  and  minimise  cross-movement\r\n\r\nbetween  the different zones.   The universities and  the\r\n\r\npolytechnics  will also be looking at various  procedures\r\n\r\nto  see how they can do daily temperature taking when the\r\n\r\ninstitutions reopen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should stress also that social responsibility\r\n\r\nis one of the most important\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfeatures  as  well.  What we have done is  that  we  have\r\n\r\nasked parents and students to check themselves every  day\r\n\r\nbefore coming to the institutions, so that they will  not\r\n\r\ncome to the institutions if they are not feeling well.  I\r\n\r\nam  glad  that  there is high confidence  among  parents.\r\n\r\nAttendance  rate in schools has been very high,  but  the\r\n\r\nattendance rate is slightly lower than normal.  And I  am\r\n\r\nhappy  about  that  because it  shows  that  parents  and\r\n\r\nstudents  are  taking  their responsibilities  seriously.\r\n\r\nPreviously,  when  they  had been  slightly  ill  with  a\r\n\r\nsniffle,  slight sore throat or cough, they would  go  to\r\n\r\nschool.  Now, they are staying at home.  I think that  is\r\n\r\na  sensible and socially responsible thing to do.  In the\r\n\r\napproach that we are taking in the schools with regard to\r\n\r\nSARS,  we  take it really as a public education exercise.\r\n\r\nWe  take  the  opportunity to educate the students  about\r\n\r\nsocial  responsibilities, health issues, and how to  look\r\n\r\nafter  themselves.  And we hope that these messages  will\r\n\r\nalso  flow from the students into the homes and  help  to\r\n\r\neducate Singaporeans at large.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, thank you for allowing\r\n\r\nme  to  respond to a couple of points.  There  are  three\r\n\r\npoints here which I thought I should respond to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua traced the plight of the\r\n\r\nself-employed  who,  because of this  outbreak  of  SARS,\r\n\r\nwould  suffer, not that they have become victims  of  the\r\n\r\ndisease   but  that  their  income  would  be   affected,\r\n\r\nparticularly those who would need a licence to  carry  on\r\n\r\nwith  their  livelihood.  And if their income goes  down,\r\n\r\nthey  would  have cash flow difficulty, and  cannot  make\r\n\r\ntheir contribution to Medisave, thereby they cannot renew\r\n\r\ntheir licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure hon. Members that we would consider\r\n\r\nsuch  cases very sympathetically.  Their contribution  to\r\n\r\nMedisave is actually based on their income.  So if  their\r\n\r\nincome   indeed   goes  down,  their  contribution   will\r\n\r\nobviously  go down.  But even then, if they have  special\r\n\r\ndifficulty  trying to meet this lower contribution  rate,\r\n\r\nwe would be very happy to make arrangement to ensure that\r\n\r\ntheir licence\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  be  renewed and they can continue to earn a  living\r\n\r\nand support their families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Chen asked why was the foreign worker levy\r\n\r\nrebate  that  was  announced as part of  the  package  of\r\n\r\nmeasures  to help businesses affected by the outbreak  of\r\n\r\nSARS  limited to foreign workers in the gazetted  hotels,\r\n\r\nand  not  extended  to  all  foreign  workers.   In  that\r\n\r\ninstance,  the package was tailored, as DPM had explained\r\n\r\nwhen  he  announced the package, to the sector  that  was\r\n\r\nmost  directly hit, and this was the tourism sector,  ie,\r\n\r\nhotels, travel industry, restaurants and such like.  When\r\n\r\nwe  looked  at  that group, we found that  the  group  of\r\n\r\nforeign workers who were paying higher levy, most of them\r\n\r\nwere actually in the hotel sector.  As hon. Members know,\r\n\r\nthere  are  two  tiers of levy for work  permit  holders.\r\n\r\nThose  who have higher skills pay the lower levy of  $30.\r\n\r\nSo  the  levy  in itself is not a major cost  factor  for\r\n\r\nthose  at  the lower levy.  Those who are at  the  higher\r\n\r\nlevy  of  $240, most of them are actually  in  the  hotel\r\n\r\nsector.  Therefore, we decided that this is where we  can\r\n\r\nmake a difference.  This is where by reducing the levy by\r\n\r\nhalf, we can make a contribution to help the employers to\r\n\r\nweather this crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that I want to address was made by\r\n\r\nMdm  Halimah  and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang.  Both of  them  were\r\n\r\nconcerned  about those people who either lost their  jobs\r\n\r\nor suffered wage cuts as a result of the outbreak of SARS\r\n\r\nwhich  affects the economy.  In the case of Mr  Yeo  Guat\r\n\r\nKwang,  he  asked what we can do to help to  enhance  the\r\n\r\nemployability of those workers who were retrenched  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of the business downturn.  We would like to  help\r\n\r\nthese  workers to be re-deployed wherever there are jobs.\r\n\r\nWe  would  be prepared to retrain them for new jobs,  and\r\n\r\nthere  are  many schemes under the Ministry of Manpower's\r\n\r\nskills  upgrading and retraining programme.  So, I  would\r\n\r\noffer  this retraining programme to them.  In fact,  this\r\n\r\nweekend, there is a job fair organised by the North  West\r\n\r\nCDC,  and  they  have  brought  together  many  employers\r\n\r\noffering  nearly  1,000  jobs,  packaged  together   with\r\n\r\nappropriate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntraining programme, so that anybody who is unemployed can\r\n\r\nhave  a  chance  to be retrained for the  jobs  that  are\r\n\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even during this period when we have high\r\n\r\nunemployment  and  redundancy,  my  officers,  when  they\r\n\r\ntalked  to  the  companies which are in  the  process  of\r\n\r\nbringing workers from the SARS affected areas, were  told\r\n\r\nthat,  notwithstanding the present situation,  they  have\r\n\r\ngreat  difficulty recruiting workers.  That is  why  some\r\n\r\ncompanies  still  resort to bringing in new  work  permit\r\n\r\nholders  from SARS affected areas.  They know the danger.\r\n\r\nThey  know the risk, and they know that they have  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  this  additional step  of  putting  the  workers\r\n\r\nthrough  a  10-day  quarantine which costs  the  company.\r\n\r\nThey  have to pay for the costs of the quarantine.   They\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay  for the medical staff that  supervise  the\r\n\r\nworkers under quarantine.  But they are willing to do it,\r\n\r\nand  they  tell  my  officers that the  reason  is  that,\r\n\r\ndespite  this present situation, Singaporeans  are  still\r\n\r\nnot prepared to take these jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I want to take this opportunity to urge all our\r\n\r\npeople - if you need a job, there are jobs available, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  be  there  to  help  you,  we  will  find\r\n\r\nopportunity for you, but you must be prepared to make the\r\n\r\nadjustment, you must be prepared to undergo training,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, so that you can take on these jobs.   I  think\r\n\r\nthat  is the most viable solution.  Just giving out  more\r\n\r\nfinancial  support can only last so long.  It  is  not  a\r\n\r\npermanent  solution.  Yes, in the case of those  who  are\r\n\r\nvictims  of  SARS, we have this special  Home  Quarantine\r\n\r\nOrder allowance to assist them to tide over the period of\r\n\r\nhome  quarantine when they lose their income.   But  over\r\n\r\nthe  longer  term, the only way to support  yourself  and\r\n\r\nyour  family  is to get a job, and that is where  we  are\r\n\r\nhere to help you.  To retrain you for the job, if you  do\r\n\r\nnot  have the skills.  To help you to find a job, if  you\r\n\r\ndo not know how to go about doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nstart  off by responding to Dr Lily Neo's question  about\r\n\r\nhow  the  SGH outbreak started and whether it could  have\r\n\r\nbeen averted, and also how did that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlead  to  the  outbreak  in the Pasir  Panjang  Wholesale\r\n\r\nCentre.   I  hope  in explaining how these  got  started,\r\n\r\nMembers  can  appreciate  the difficulties  that  we  are\r\n\r\ndealing  with.   We  do  not have a  reliable  and  quick\r\n\r\ndiagnostic  test  system  now.   We  have  to  depend  on\r\n\r\nclinical  symptoms and we have to depend  on  very  rapid\r\n\r\ncontact  tracing  in order to ringfence the  contacts  to\r\n\r\nprevent  the  spread from widening,  which  is  also  the\r\n\r\nsecond question which Dr Lily Neo presented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This index case in SGH that caused this cluster was\r\n\r\nan  ex-patient  in  Tan Tock Seng  Hospital.   He  had  a\r\n\r\nmultitude of problems and he was discharged from Tan Tock\r\n\r\nSeng  Hospital on 20th March.  He recovered from some  of\r\n\r\nhis  problems, and this was a regular discharge  on  20th\r\n\r\nMarch.   On  22nd March, we decided that  Tan  Tock  Seng\r\n\r\nHospital would be a hospital dedicated for SARS.  So this\r\n\r\nwas in the middle of the problems that we were having  in\r\n\r\nTan  Tock Seng Hospital.  He was discharged on a  regular\r\n\r\nbasis because he recovered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of that decision to make Tan Tock Seng\r\n\r\nHospital  the dedicated hospital for SARS, when this  man\r\n\r\nhad gastrointestinal bleeding on 24th March, he had to go\r\n\r\nto  SGH because Tan Tock Seng Hospital was only admitting\r\n\r\npatients  for  SARS.  He went to SGH.  SGH took  all  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  precautions - screened  the  person.   He  had\r\n\r\ngastrointestinal bleeding.  He also had a foot ulcer  and\r\n\r\na  low  grade fever.  SGH took a chest X-ray,  which  was\r\n\r\ndone on the date of admission on 24th March.  The chest X-ray was clear.  Because of the symptoms he presented, SGH\r\n\r\ndid  not  consider  him to be a suspect  SARS  case,  and\r\n\r\ntreated  him  for his problems and put  him  in  an  open\r\n\r\ngeneral ward (Ward 57).  On the 5th day of admission,  on\r\n\r\n28th  March, he developed high fever.  So SGH  took  note\r\n\r\nand  gave him a repeat chest X-ray.  The repeat chest  X-ray was normal again.  He was treated with antibiotics on\r\n\r\n29th March and the temperature came down, indicating that\r\n\r\nthis  could  be  a bacterial infection and  not  a  viral\r\n\r\ninfection.  A blood culture showed that he had\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninfection of the blood by a bacteria, E. Coli.   A  third\r\n\r\nchest  X-ray was done on 30th March, and this  was  again\r\n\r\nnormal.  He was given a stronger antibiotic on 4th April,\r\n\r\nand  he did not have fever anymore.  But his chest  X-ray\r\n\r\non  4th April showed signs of pneumonia, and SGH did  the\r\n\r\nright thing, which was to send him to TTSH, because  with\r\n\r\na  chest  manifestation, he was considered as  a  suspect\r\n\r\nSARS case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, SGH management also began to notice a\r\n\r\ngroup  of their staff and healthcare workers coming  down\r\n\r\nwith  fever,  and  they went into alert.   A  cluster  of\r\n\r\npotential  problems was growing.  So on 5th  April,  they\r\n\r\ndecided  to  transfer Wards 57 and 58 to  Tan  Tock  Seng\r\n\r\nHospital.   The process took some time and  the  transfer\r\n\r\nwas completed.  The transfer started on 6th April, and it\r\n\r\nwas  completed on 7th April.  In transferring two  wards,\r\n\r\nwe had to move all the patients, many of whom were fairly\r\n\r\nsick,  and  the staff together with them.   We  initiated\r\n\r\ncontact tracing, involving 120 people - the patients  and\r\n\r\nthe  staff - to find out whom they were in contact  with.\r\n\r\nBecause  if they were infected, we did not know who  else\r\n\r\ncould  be  infected  in the two wards.   So  the  contact\r\n\r\ntraced everybody.  From the 120, we have to contact trace\r\n\r\na  few  hundreds  to see who they are.  By  the  time  we\r\n\r\ndetected his brother who had visited him in SGH, that was\r\n\r\nalready  8th April, one day later.  By then, his  brother\r\n\r\nwho  caused this cluster of problems in Pasir Panjang had\r\n\r\nonset  of fever on 4th April.  He still went to  work  at\r\n\r\nPasir  Panjang  Wholesale Centre on 5th  April.   He  was\r\n\r\nunwell  on  6th April; so he did not work on  6th  April.\r\n\r\nBut he went back on 7th April, and again on the 8th.   By\r\n\r\nthe  8th  of April, he was quite unwell; he was  sent  to\r\n\r\nNUH.  So by the time we realised he was a contact of  his\r\n\r\nbrother  in SGH, he had already been admitted to  NUH  on\r\n\r\nthe 8th.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this illustrates the difficulties we face. When\r\n\r\na   patient  is  presented  with  all  kinds  of  chronic\r\n\r\nproblems, it masks the typical symptoms that we associate\r\n\r\nwith  SARS - high fever and all the other symptoms,  plus\r\n\r\npneumonia  and  chest problem.  In this  case,  they  did\r\n\r\nthree X-rays, they did a blood test, and this did\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  manifest  itself till much later.   We  have  to  do\r\n\r\ncontact  tracing very quickly, but it still takes  us  24\r\n\r\nhours.   We  set  a target of completing contact  tracing\r\n\r\nwithin  48 hours.  So in this case, even if we  meet  the\r\n\r\nlimit of 48 hours, by that time the onset was on the  5th\r\n\r\nof April, he was very sick, and on the 8th he was already\r\n\r\nin NUH.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hindsight, could we have done better? The\r\n\r\nproblem  is  a significant one.  Obviously we could  have\r\n\r\ndone  better.  I think SGH management could be on greater\r\n\r\nalert when it comes to staff coming down unwell, which is\r\n\r\nnow  the new standard that we impose.  Any two healthcare\r\n\r\nworkers having fever in the same department now sends out\r\n\r\na   red  flag.   But  having  set  the  standard  of  two\r\n\r\nhealthcare workers having fever sending out a red flag, I\r\n\r\nhope  Members realise now a lot of red flags are  showing\r\n\r\nbecause it is not unusual to have fever.  And we set  our\r\n\r\nfever  threshold now at 37.5oC, which is not a very  high\r\n\r\ngrade  fever.  So, everybody is on very high alert.   And\r\n\r\ncontact tracing is not 100% foolproof.  We need people to\r\n\r\nbe very truthful about their contact history.  Otherwise,\r\n\r\nif  they  give us half a story, we miss out some  of  the\r\n\r\ncontacts and we cannot ringfence these people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to say that this SARS challenge is a\r\n\r\ntremendous  challenge for us.  We are flying  blind.   We\r\n\r\nonly have two instruments which are the clinical symptoms\r\n\r\n- fever, chills, cough, muscle aches - and then only much\r\n\r\nlater,  ie,  three days, five days, or seven days  later,\r\n\r\nyou  get the chest manifestations.  The second instrument\r\n\r\nwe  have is contact history so that we know that, even if\r\n\r\nyou  have  got  fever  and cough, but,  because  of  your\r\n\r\ncontact history, we must suspect that you have SARS.  And\r\n\r\nthat is why I said in my statement that we have to depend\r\n\r\non  people  taking temperature, and we have to depend  on\r\n\r\npeople being truthful to us in their contact history.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked about WHO guidelines, why we have\r\n\r\nto  follow them and why do we not set our own guidelines.\r\n\r\nWe   have  to  follow  a  certain  set  of  international\r\n\r\nguidelines because we have to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreport to WHO.  This is a global problem.  We cannot have\r\n\r\na different set of guidelines.  Then WHO would not have a\r\n\r\ntrue  picture  of  our situation.  But for  the  clinical\r\n\r\nguidelines  set by WHO where we can be more conservative,\r\n\r\nwe  have done so, for example, WHO guidelines on what  is\r\n\r\ndeemed  a  recovery.  When a person  is  deemed  to  have\r\n\r\nrecovered  from SARS, WHO says he must have no fever  for\r\n\r\n48  hours.   In Singapore, we set it at 72  hours.   Then\r\n\r\nthey  insist on a series of blood tests to see the  white\r\n\r\nblood count.  We do that too.  They insist on X-rays.  We\r\n\r\ndo  that.   They say you need 10 days' medical  leave  at\r\n\r\nhome.   Our rule is 14 days' home quarantine, that means,\r\n\r\nnot  just  10 days' medical leave at home, but we  insist\r\n\r\nthat  the  person  stays at home  for  14  days  on  Home\r\n\r\nQuarantine  Order,  and  he has  to  come  back  to  TTSH\r\n\r\nregularly  through the ambulance for his blood tests  and\r\n\r\nchest  X-ray.  So we follow WHO guidelines, in  terms  of\r\n\r\nreporting  of statistics, otherwise, there would  not  be\r\n\r\nsensible comparisons across the countries.  When it comes\r\n\r\nto  clinical guidelines, our staff here always try to  be\r\n\r\nmore  conservative, as I have illustrated on the criteria\r\n\r\nfor recovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked about epidemiological study group.\r\n\r\nWe  are  doing  this  constantly, trying  to  piece  this\r\n\r\ntogether  and  trying  to get a picture  of  the  disease\r\n\r\npattern.   We also have two WHO consultants with  us  and\r\n\r\none  consultant  from US CDC helping  us  to  track  this\r\n\r\npattern.  They of course provide the link to their parent\r\n\r\norganisations,   and  whatever  we   do   is   completely\r\n\r\ntransparent  to them and audited by them.   And  so  they\r\n\r\nhave  high  confidence in their parent headquarters  that\r\n\r\nwhatever  we report is the truth and not something  which\r\n\r\nwe  are  doctoring  to give a different  picture  to  the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also asked about the healthcare workers.\r\n\r\nAre  they  adequately  protected?   We  try  to  have  as\r\n\r\nstringent a level of protection as possible.  But  a  lot\r\n\r\ndepends  on  correct  usage  of  this  protection.    For\r\n\r\nexample,  if any of you have used the N95 mask, you  will\r\n\r\nfind  that  it is very, very uncomfortable.  It  is  very\r\n\r\nhard  to  breathe.  When I put it on, I find that  I  was\r\n\r\nbeing suffocated.  And I cannot imagine\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhow I could ever be a nurse.  But the nurse has it on for\r\n\r\neight  hours,  10  hours,  12  hours.   And  it  is  very\r\n\r\nuncomfortable.  In the open wards, it is very  warm  with\r\n\r\nthe  gown  and the mask.  These are not easy  conditions.\r\n\r\nIt has to be very tight-fitting, so it is hard to breathe\r\n\r\nand  if  it is not tight-fitting, then it does not  work.\r\n\r\nSo   it  requires  a  lot  of  vigilance  and  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ndiscipline.  Day in and day out, keeping this  protection\r\n\r\non  because you know that if you make a slip-up, it  will\r\n\r\nbe a very costly slip-up.  So for the healthcare workers,\r\n\r\nit is a lot of stress, and they are over-stretched in the\r\n\r\nwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the situation varies. When we have a big\r\n\r\ncluster  like  in SGH and in the Pasir Panjang  Wholesale\r\n\r\nCentre,  then of course the workload increases.   But  if\r\n\r\nyou  look  at  the situation across the public  hospitals\r\n\r\ntoday, Tan Tock Seng Hospital is well protected.   As  we\r\n\r\nmentioned in our statements, we have not had any  of  our\r\n\r\nhealthcare worker being infected for the last six  weeks.\r\n\r\nSo  the  morale  is  high.  They know that  if  they  are\r\n\r\ndiligent  and  they take good care of themselves  through\r\n\r\nthe  protection, they will continue to be protected.  But\r\n\r\nonce there is a slip-up, it will be a real setback.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resources in Tan Tock Seng Hospital are bearing\r\n\r\nup.  Our critical resources are the ICU and the isolation\r\n\r\nrooms.   In  the ICU, we are doing okay because  we  have\r\n\r\nnearly 40 ICU rooms and we are using about 20 each  time.\r\n\r\nSo  we still have some capacity.  Our isolation rooms are\r\n\r\nnow  very  stretched  because,  with  the  Pasir  Panjang\r\n\r\nWholesale  Centre cluster, we encourage  people  to  come\r\n\r\nforward  for  screening.   Because  we  do  not  have   a\r\n\r\ndiagnostic  kit,  we  have  to keep  them  in  individual\r\n\r\nisolation  suites to watch over them for some time.   And\r\n\r\ntherefore  the  isolation  rooms  are  filling  up   very\r\n\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other hospitals are bearing up reasonably well.\r\n\r\nAs  I have said, KK Hospital is also clean of SARS and  I\r\n\r\nthink  they  are managing very well.  Alexandra  Hospital\r\n\r\nhas  not had an episode of SARS.  As a result, the public\r\n\r\ngoes there and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey   are  now  feeling  the  strain  because  Alexandra\r\n\r\nHospital is a very small hospital and it is not  used  to\r\n\r\nthis  load.  So a lot of the load that used to go to TTSH\r\n\r\nand SGH now goes to Alexandra Hospital.  Changi Hospital,\r\n\r\nafter  their  episode in end-March, has not  had  another\r\n\r\nepisode.   So  they are again gearing up.  So,  today,  I\r\n\r\nwould  say TTSH, KK, Changi and AH are bearing  up  well.\r\n\r\nWe  have the problems in SGH.  They were doing okay until\r\n\r\nthe  recent  episode with Dr Alex Chao.  And in  NUH,  we\r\n\r\nstill have the cluster that was started by the brother of\r\n\r\nthe  index  case  in SGH which created a  cluster  there.\r\n\r\nThat one, we are still trying to keep it under control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have the Ministerial Combat Team under SMS\r\n\r\nKhaw  Boon  Wan.  He and his team have gone down  to  the\r\n\r\nhospitals  to button down the protection guidelines,  the\r\n\r\nexecution  of those protection guidelines, to  raise  the\r\n\r\nstandards  and  the  morale and the capabilities  of  the\r\n\r\nhospitals.   I think they are doing a great  job  and  we\r\n\r\nshould be able to see the situation improving day by day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our hospitals are coping fairly well with the\r\n\r\npublic  services.   As  to  hospital  charges,  we   have\r\n\r\nexplained  this before.  Screening is free.   So  if  you\r\n\r\ncome forward for screening in Tan Tock Seng Hospital,  it\r\n\r\nis  free.  If you are kept for observation, then you  are\r\n\r\ncharged C class rates.  So it is heavily subsidised.  And\r\n\r\nif  you  have financial problems, then our medical social\r\n\r\nworker  would apply Medifund for you.  So I do not  think\r\n\r\nSingaporeans should be concerned about the medical  costs\r\n\r\nof coming forward for screening or treatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other group of questions which Members raised\r\n\r\nand  which  I  thought  it is worthwhile  for  me  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough,  in  some detail, is the Home Quarantine  Order.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  detect a probable SARS or a high  suspect  SARS\r\n\r\ncase,  we  start contact tracing and the people  whom  we\r\n\r\ndetermine  to have contact with this patient, a  probable\r\n\r\nSARS  or a high suspect SARS, we will then issue the Home\r\n\r\nQuarantine  Order.  As far as this contact is  concerned,\r\n\r\nhe is still healthy, he is still well, but because of his\r\n\r\ncontact history with a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprobable SARS or a suspect SARS case, he is given a  Home\r\n\r\nQuarantine Order.  And the reason why we do so is that we\r\n\r\nwant  him  to stay at home, monitor his health constantly\r\n\r\nand the minute he has a high fever or other symptoms,  he\r\n\r\nwill  call us and we will dispatch an ambulance to  fetch\r\n\r\nhim  to Tan Tock Seng Hospital straightaway.  So in  that\r\n\r\nway,  we  minimise the likelihood of him infecting  other\r\n\r\npeople  in  his family as well as in the community.   But\r\n\r\nthe  other family members are not contacts of a  probable\r\n\r\nSARS  or  a  suspect SARS patient.  So if  they  are  not\r\n\r\ncontacts,  they  will  not be issued  a  Home  Quarantine\r\n\r\nOrder.   But  if  the other family members are  contacts,\r\n\r\nthey   will  also  be  issued  a  Home  Quarantine  Order\r\n\r\naccordingly.  Then how do we treat the children?  Because\r\n\r\nwe  felt that as schools are very sensitive institutions,\r\n\r\nwe  took the extra care of asking the children to also be\r\n\r\nquarantined even though the children will not be infected\r\n\r\nuntil the adult is infected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go through this again. If we detect a\r\n\r\nprobable  or  a  suspect  SARS  case,  we  determine  the\r\n\r\ncontacts.   Let us say, there are 20 contacts.   Then  we\r\n\r\nissue  a  Home  Quarantine Order  on  each  of  these  20\r\n\r\ncontacts.   These  20  contacts will have  an  incubation\r\n\r\nperiod  before  they become infectious.   The  incubation\r\n\r\nperiod is between three and 10 days.  But we insist  that\r\n\r\nhe  stays at home so that, whenever he has a fever or  he\r\n\r\nshows  symptoms and becomes infectious, we will pull  him\r\n\r\nout  to  TTSH.   The adult family members  will  not  get\r\n\r\ninfected  until  the  contact gets infected.   Then  they\r\n\r\nthemselves will take another incubation period  of  three\r\n\r\nto  10  days before they become infectious.  So the other\r\n\r\nfamily  members  can continue with their work  and  their\r\n\r\nlife,  because they are not infectious and they will  not\r\n\r\nbe   infectious  until  the  contact  becomes  infectious\r\n\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we not do the same for children? Medically,\r\n\r\nwe  should  do the same for children.  But  knowing   the\r\n\r\nsensitivity of parents over the children in the  schools,\r\n\r\nwe  decided that, for children of a contact, we  will  be\r\n\r\nextra kiasu and we also issue a Home Quarantine Order  on\r\n\r\nthem.  When we started, of course, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstipulated  it  as a requirement in the  Home  Quarantine\r\n\r\nOrder, as Mr Tan Soo Khoon raised.  This has caused  some\r\n\r\nconfusion  in  the public's mind.  Recently,  we  decided\r\n\r\nthat   we   would  actually  issue  an  individual   Home\r\n\r\nQuarantine  Order  on each of these children.   There  is\r\n\r\nanother situation where a family member is a probable  or\r\n\r\na suspect SARS case, in which case all the family members\r\n\r\nare  contacts and all the family members would be  issued\r\n\r\nHome  Quarantine Orders, including the children.   So  to\r\n\r\nminimise this confusion, nowadays, when a child is  asked\r\n\r\nto  stay  at home, we will issue a Home Quarantine  Order\r\n\r\nand there would not be any confusion among the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members asked what about financial support for\r\n\r\nthis  group.   If the contact is given a Home  Quarantine\r\n\r\nOrder  and the other family members are not at risk until\r\n\r\nthe  contact  becomes infectious, then the  other  family\r\n\r\nmembers can go about with their life as usual, go and buy\r\n\r\ngrocery,  etc.   But  we do have a  situation  where  the\r\n\r\nentire  family is served with the Home Quarantine  Order.\r\n\r\nThen  of  course  we will come in to provide  support  to\r\n\r\nthem,  in  case they need grocery, etc.  But if they  can\r\n\r\nmake  their own arrangements, ie, if their relatives  can\r\n\r\nbring  the food to them and leave it outside their  door,\r\n\r\nit  is all right.  This is just to be extra safe because,\r\n\r\nif  they follow the rules that we set for them, they  are\r\n\r\nnot  infectious until they exhibit the symptoms.  So  the\r\n\r\nworkman  can go to their house and do the repair as  long\r\n\r\nas  these people are responsible.  If they do not exhibit\r\n\r\nany  symptoms, they are not infectious and life goes  on.\r\n\r\nBut  the minute they have a fever and they have symptoms,\r\n\r\nthen they will call us and we will bring them to TTSH for\r\n\r\nscreening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we serve the Home Quarantine Order on a person,\r\n\r\nthe  CISCO  police who serves the order will set  up  the\r\n\r\ncamera  and give the instructions.  I accept Mr  Tan  Soo\r\n\r\nKhoon's  point that we should give it in four  languages.\r\n\r\nWe  will  do that.  But the CISCO police will explain  to\r\n\r\nthe person, who is served with the Home Quarantine Order,\r\n\r\nwhat  he has to do and how he reports through the  camera\r\n\r\nwhenever we call him up.  At the same time, we will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsend  a  nurse to visit the person under Home  Quarantine\r\n\r\nOrder and the nurse will have a kit with a thermometer, a\r\n\r\nface mask and also instructions, so that he knows how  to\r\n\r\ntake  his temperature on his own and, if he is sick, then\r\n\r\nhe  puts  on the surgical mask and wait for the ambulance\r\n\r\nto  come.   So, this is the way we explain to the  person\r\n\r\nwhat he has to do and, of course, it would help if we put\r\n\r\nit in four languages, and we will do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third group of questions which I thought is\r\n\r\nimportant for me to elaborate on is the situation in  Tan\r\n\r\nTock Seng Hospital and why Singaporeans fear going there.\r\n\r\nWe  have come out several times to explain the very  high\r\n\r\nlevel of infection control in Tan Tock Seng Hospital  and\r\n\r\nthat  it has been screening hundreds of people since  the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of  the  SARS outbreak, and people  have  been\r\n\r\ndischarged, they go on with life as usual.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, cross-infection in Tan Tock Seng Hospital has\r\n\r\nnot  taken place.  If, after screening, the Tan Tock Seng\r\n\r\nclinicians  feel  that you should be warded  for  further\r\n\r\nobservation, then you are kept in an isolation room.  You\r\n\r\nwill  not  infect others and others will not infect  you.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  healthcare workers who come to look  after  you\r\n\r\nwill all be fully gowned and fully protected.  So, again,\r\n\r\na very high level of infection control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are down with SARS, as I explained in my\r\n\r\nstatement,  the  main treatment is to  give  you  medical\r\n\r\nsupport and allow your body's immune system to combat the\r\n\r\nvirus  itself.   The  problem  is  when  you  have  other\r\n\r\ncomplications.   Then you need the full  medical  support\r\n\r\nsystem  to address these medical complications.  But  the\r\n\r\nactual  combating of the SARS virus would really be  done\r\n\r\nby the person's own immune system.  Of course, if you ask\r\n\r\nyourself,  logically  the earlier you  come  forward  for\r\n\r\ntreatment,  the better your chances of recovery,  because\r\n\r\nif  you  do not have the full medical support, especially\r\n\r\nin  the  ICU, when you have congestion in your lungs  and\r\n\r\nyou  cannot breathe, then no oxygen gets into your  blood\r\n\r\nstream\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  your chances of survival are very low.  But  if  you\r\n\r\nare  in  the  ICU, then they can intubate you,  they  can\r\n\r\nforce  oxygen  into  your lungs and cause  your  body  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to absorb the oxygen, and so you have a fighting\r\n\r\nchance.   So,  people  can stay in  the  ICU,  intubated,\r\n\r\nventilated, and then the body will have a chance to fight\r\n\r\nthe virus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the earlier Singaporeans who are down with SARS\r\n\r\npresent  themselves  for  treatment  and  for  this  full\r\n\r\nmedical  support to help them fight the SARS, the  higher\r\n\r\nthe  chances of survival.  If you track the kind of cases\r\n\r\nthat  come to our hospitals, when they come in very, very\r\n\r\nsick  and  very, very late, and they have to  go  to  ICU\r\n\r\nalmost  immediately,  then I think the  chances  are  all\r\n\r\nvery,  very  slim.   If you have been following  stories,\r\n\r\nthose  who  come very late and very sick and  go  to  ICU\r\n\r\nstraightaway, they have much lower chances of recovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, our recovery rate is still very good. 85%\r\n\r\nfully  recover.   Those who go to  ICU,  more  than  half\r\n\r\nrecover  too.   So,  again, I urge Singaporeans  to  come\r\n\r\nforward  if you have SARS.  Seek early treatment and  you\r\n\r\nwill  have better chances of recovery, you do not  infect\r\n\r\nyour  family,  and  you  do not cause  infection  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Warren Lee asked whether we need special\r\n\r\naccommodation  for the people on Home Quarantine  Orders.\r\n\r\nAs I explained, it is not necessary, because these people\r\n\r\nare not infectious.  We just want them to be isolated  in\r\n\r\ntheir  own  homes  and, if they have  a  fever  or  other\r\n\r\nsymptoms,  then  they present themselves immediately  for\r\n\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next set of issues is really the level of\r\n\r\ninformation  that  we  give out, ie,  whether  we  should\r\n\r\npublicise  the  names  of patients  and  people  on  Home\r\n\r\nQuarantine Orders.  Generally, we are reluctant to do so,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  think  we  should  try  to  preserve  medical\r\n\r\nconfidentiality as much as possible.  But where there  is\r\n\r\na  public health need, then we will do it.  If we need an\r\n\r\naccelerated contact tracing because the way we  go  about\r\n\r\nit  through detective work takes 24 or 48 hours and  that\r\n\r\ntakes\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntoo  long  and the risk is too high, then, of course,  we\r\n\r\nwill publish the names in the media.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for recalcitrants and defaulters, I think we\r\n\r\nshould  publish  their  names  and  shame  them  because,\r\n\r\notherwise, such Singaporeans will continue not to do what\r\n\r\nis  necessary of them.  So, although we try  to  preserve\r\n\r\nmedical  confidentiality, people who default and wantonly\r\n\r\nbreak the rules, we will definitely name them so that  we\r\n\r\ncan shame them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the supply of equipment, eg, masks, gowns,\r\n\r\ngoggles, thermometers, etc, there is a shortage of  masks\r\n\r\nworldwide.   But we are using all our resources  that  we\r\n\r\nhave in Singapore, eg, from MINDEF, MTI, IE Singapore, ST\r\n\r\nLogistics,  to  get ourselves the necessary  supplies  to\r\n\r\nkeep   our   healthcare  workers  protected.    So,   our\r\n\r\ncommitment  to  our healthcare workers is  that  we  will\r\n\r\nleave  no stones unturned to get this equipment for them.\r\n\r\nThermometers are less of a problem.  We have ordered more\r\n\r\nthan a million.  I think these will be available over the\r\n\r\nnext few months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua asked whether there is a difference\r\n\r\nin  the  minimum  number of days in the  Home  Quarantine\r\n\r\nOrders.   We  have  used  10 days  because  that  is  the\r\n\r\nincubation  period.   But  some employers,  for  example,\r\n\r\nimpose a voluntary quarantine of 14 days to make it  even\r\n\r\nsafer.   I think there is nothing to lose if you want  to\r\n\r\nextend  it to 14 days.  But, for us, we use a minimum  of\r\n\r\n10 days because that is the incubation period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is the sort of resources that we have. As you\r\n\r\nhave  heard  from  the  DPM, the full  resources  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are behind the Ministry of Health  to  combat\r\n\r\nthis  problem.  We have used resources from every agency.\r\n\r\nFrom MINDEF, we have used the medics; we have people from\r\n\r\nthe  People's Association to help us in contact  tracing;\r\n\r\nwe  have  used  detectives from the CID  to  help  us  in\r\n\r\ncontact  tracing;  we  have used  all  resources  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to tackle this problem.  And as you would have\r\n\r\nheard from the responses of the various Ministers, all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Ministries  are gearing up to tackle  the  different\r\n\r\naspects of how to deal with SARS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members asked about the treatment regime. When\r\n\r\nwe started off, as I said, there is no specific treatment\r\n\r\nregime.   The  Hong Kong experience, they  tried  to  use\r\n\r\nRibavirin, the anti-viral regime.  But as we all know, it\r\n\r\nhas  toxic  side effects and so we have to  use  it  very\r\n\r\ncarefully.     The   American   clinicians    are    more\r\n\r\nconservative,  and  they prefer  not  to  use  this  very\r\n\r\naggressive  approach.  So, our clinicians  have  to  make\r\n\r\nprofessional judgments, ie, when to use the full array of\r\n\r\nantibiotics and anti-viral regimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked about the situation in NUH Wards\r\n\r\n55  and  68.  These are the kinds of problem that we  are\r\n\r\nconfronted with nowadays, because our threshold of  alert\r\n\r\nis  now set very, very low.  When you have two staff with\r\n\r\nhigh  fever and patients with high fever, everybody  gets\r\n\r\nvery excited.  So, in SGH, on Good Friday, we transferred\r\n\r\nWard 74 to TTSH because of this combination of staff  and\r\n\r\npatients  having fever.  It was a precautionary  measure.\r\n\r\nWe transferred lock, stock and barrel, ie, one whole ward\r\n\r\nacross  -  a lot of resources and effort.  As  it  turned\r\n\r\nout, it was, thankfully, a false alarm.  The fever of the\r\n\r\nstaff  came down, and the patients in that ward,  because\r\n\r\nof their other medical problems, were showing this fever.\r\n\r\nBut we would rather be safe than sorry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, for NUH Wards 55 and 68, we had been\r\n\r\ntracking the situation, and it is a combination of  staff\r\n\r\nand patients having fever.  Some days the fever is up, on\r\n\r\nother  days  the fever is down.  The patients  there  are\r\n\r\ndiabetic  and kidney patients and, according to what  the\r\n\r\ndoctors  tell  me,  fevers  in such  situations  are  not\r\n\r\nuncommon.  But, at the same time, we are always  on  very\r\n\r\nhigh  alert, and we have to make a professional  decision\r\n\r\nwhen  a  combination of red flags comes up.  Do  we  just\r\n\r\nringfence  them  in  NUH or do we  physically  move  them\r\n\r\nacross  to  Tan Tock Seng Hospital?  So the  Director  of\r\n\r\nMedical Services and the Chairman of the Medical Board in\r\n\r\neach hospital\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  confronted  with such professional  decisions  every\r\n\r\ntime they are faced with situations like this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered most of the questions. I am\r\n\r\nsure there will be many other questions which I have  not\r\n\r\nanswered, in which case, I will respond later on.   I  do\r\n\r\nnot want to hold up the others.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, sorry to\r\n\r\ndisappoint you with more answers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I just focus on four or five main points which\r\n\r\nthe  other Ministers have not yet covered before Mr  Wong\r\n\r\nKan  Seng  tells us what he has been doing in the  Ex-Co.\r\n\r\nMost  of  my issues have to do with our policy  measures,\r\n\r\nour  response and commitment of resources and  effort  to\r\n\r\nthis task.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked whether we have enough resources.\r\n\r\nWe  will have enough resources.  Speaking as Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance, what is needed will be given.  Do not waste  it,\r\n\r\nbut if you need it, it will be given.  If you need drugs,\r\n\r\nmasks,  gowns,  thermometers, treatment facilities,  they\r\n\r\nshall  be  provided.   We can afford  it.   This  is  the\r\n\r\nnational priority.  But it must be properly used  and  we\r\n\r\nmust get the problem under control.  Of course, there  is\r\n\r\nnever  enough, and Members have asked for more.  I  would\r\n\r\nhave been disappointed had they not asked for more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia asked why not go all the way to the\r\n\r\nlimit,  ie,  do it like reservists' allowance or  make-up\r\n\r\npay  -  whatever your salary, make up 100%.  We  are  not\r\n\r\nquite making up 100%, but we are not doing 50%, which  is\r\n\r\nwhat  Mr  Steve Chia said.  I think he may have  misheard\r\n\r\nme.   We are doing 100%, up to a cap.  The cap is  $70  a\r\n\r\nday.  But, below that, whatever your pay is, you get  it.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  you are self-employed, we will just give  you  a\r\n\r\nflat rate of $70 a day.  We will give you the benefit  of\r\n\r\nthe doubt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is our philosophy? I think we are in a\r\n\r\nsituation where the economy is going\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  hurt,  many  Singaporeans are  going  to  hurt,  many\r\n\r\nbusinesses are going to hurt.  The Government cannot take\r\n\r\nit  upon  itself to make good everybody's loss.   Because\r\n\r\nfrom 4% growth we will go down to 1% or 0% growth.  Where\r\n\r\ndoes the Government find $6 billion, which is equal to 4%\r\n\r\nof  GDP, to make good?  It is not possible.  But, at  the\r\n\r\nsame time, where the Government's action directly impacts\r\n\r\nsomebody - I shut your company, I put you out of work,  I\r\n\r\nask  you  to  stay at home, or I close the  company  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  you  also have to stay  at  home  -  we  will\r\n\r\nprovide  assistance.   If  we  do  not  do  something  to\r\n\r\nmitigate the pain, to help you out, then you are going to\r\n\r\ntry your best to escape quarantine. And that is going  to\r\n\r\nmake  our public health problem worse.  So where  we  act\r\n\r\nand  there is hurt, we will try to make good.   I  cannot\r\n\r\nalways  compensate fully, but I can extend some allowance\r\n\r\nor some gestures to address the hurt.  In the case of the\r\n\r\nPPWC,  we are going to waive rentals for 10 days  and  we\r\n\r\nare  going  to  give  them another ex-gratia  payment  of\r\n\r\n$1,600  per stall, more or less covering up the  cost  of\r\n\r\nthe vegetables which became spoilt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it dollar-for-dollar? I think that is not\r\n\r\npossible,  because this is a situation where there  would\r\n\r\nbe  ups and downs, but to the extent that we can help, we\r\n\r\nwill.  So when it comes to the HQO allowance, if you  are\r\n\r\nin  the  lower income group, I will give you up to  100%.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, if you are self-employed and a hawker, you  may\r\n\r\nnot earn $70, but I am going to gloss that over. I do not\r\n\r\nwant  to  have  to examine your income tax returns,  your\r\n\r\nemployer's  records, or whatever the records  there  are,\r\n\r\nand  audit them. What I have suggested to my staff to  do\r\n\r\nis that when you are served with a HQO, you will be given\r\n\r\na  form.   If you are an employee, give the form to  your\r\n\r\ncompany.  Your company will deal with the CDC and make  a\r\n\r\nclaim.   If  you are self-employed, you submit the  form.\r\n\r\nWe  will  process it quickly and if we can, we  might  be\r\n\r\nable to give you part of the allowance early and then the\r\n\r\nother  part  after you have completed your HQO,  just  in\r\n\r\ncase you do not complete your HQO.  So, what we can do to\r\n\r\nalleviate the hurt we will do it, but we cannot say  that\r\n\r\nwe will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompensate everybody 100%, because that is not realistic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On economic assistance, this is an issue where, like\r\n\r\nOliver  Twist in the musical, he would ask, \"Can  I  have\r\n\r\nmore?\"   The  question is:  what is the solution  to  our\r\n\r\nproblem?   Will  we solve our economic  problem  or  SARS\r\n\r\nproblem  by having an economic stimulus package?   Is  it\r\n\r\nthat kind of a problem?  Is it because our wages are  out\r\n\r\nof  line, our market has disappeared, our costs  are  not\r\n\r\ncompetitive,  or  there is insufficient demand?  So  what\r\n\r\nhappens if the Government spends $1-$3 billion?  Well, we\r\n\r\nwill  all  have  a  warm feeling -  we buy  each  other's\r\n\r\nthings,  sell each other's things.  But we do  not  solve\r\n\r\nthe  problem. The fundamental problem is a public  health\r\n\r\none.   To get the economy going, you have got to get  the\r\n\r\nmedical,  public health part solved.  And that is  not  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of money, but of the organisation,  the  social\r\n\r\nresponsibility, the discipline and the commitment we  put\r\n\r\nto  it  to  fix the SARS problem and restore  confidence.\r\n\r\nThen the economy can pick up again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian Wall Street Journal coincidentally today\r\n\r\nhas  an  editorial on this subject. The  title  is  \"SARS\r\n\r\nBailouts  are a Bad Idea\" and the editorial explains  why\r\n\r\nit is a bad idea.  It says that if you have an earthquake\r\n\r\nor typhoon, you compensate everybody.  They rebuild their\r\n\r\nshops  and stores.  Then you go back to business as usual\r\n\r\nagain.   But this is not an earthquake or typhoon.   This\r\n\r\nis a change of the landscape.  Will the businesses be the\r\n\r\nsame  at  the end of this?  What kind of businesses  will\r\n\r\ncome back?  How should you adapt and move your people and\r\n\r\nyour capital and your workers, and find new jobs?  You do\r\n\r\nnot know yet.  So, if you help people stay in the tourism\r\n\r\nindustry, even though hotel occupancy is 10-20%, what  if\r\n\r\nthe tourists do not come back for quite a long time?  You\r\n\r\ncannot  afford it.  Supposing we give tax rebates.   Will\r\n\r\nthat  solve  the  SARS  problem?  Will  that  get  people\r\n\r\nspending  again?  As the editorial says,  they  are  more\r\n\r\nlikely to stash their money away to get them through  the\r\n\r\ndifficult times ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The editorial noted that various countries are\r\n\r\nlooking at budget packages.  Hong\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nKong  announced  a big package yesterday, which  prompted\r\n\r\nthis  editorial. Singapore had a small package.   So,  at\r\n\r\nleast, (according to the editorial) it could be said that\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  the  wisdom to resist micro-managing  the\r\n\r\neconomy  through  this crisis and it is hanging  back  in\r\n\r\norder  to allow the market mechanisms to work.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  we have to adjust.  We do not know where, but  we\r\n\r\nwould have to see how the epidemic goes, what happens  to\r\n\r\nthe regional economy and the global economy, and then  we\r\n\r\nadapt.  To pour money out now does not solve the problem.\r\n\r\nIt is premature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think their conclusion is worth reading. They\r\n\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Life is full of risks, and disease is one of them.\r\n\r\n...  When things go badly, especially all at once as with\r\n\r\nSARS,  there  is a natural temptation for  government  to\r\n\r\nstep  in.  But that means that the next round of  choices\r\n\r\nare  distorted by the expectation that there  will  be  a\r\n\r\nsafety net.  In a crisis which is ongoing like SARS, that\r\n\r\nchanged perception could be particularly damaging.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true role of government is in protecting against\r\n\r\ndangers  to  society as a whole which  the  market  isn't\r\n\r\ncapable of addressing.  SARS is just such a danger.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fight SARS, to get people quarantined, to change\r\n\r\npeople's  attitudes,  to  persuade  them,  is  what   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has to do.  The economic cost will continue to\r\n\r\ngrow  as long as the virus is on the loose but if  it  is\r\n\r\ncontained, recovery should soon be coming.  So, the  best\r\n\r\nway  to solve the economic problem is to concentrate  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  possible  resources on the medical  problem  and\r\n\r\nthat  is exactly what we are doing.  Of course, a request\r\n\r\nwill  arise.  I fully expected Mr Low Thia Khiang to  ask\r\n\r\nabout the GST.  He would be remiss if he did not do so at\r\n\r\nevery  opportunity.  But is that our  problem?   The  GST\r\n\r\nincrease  is  for  the end of the year, something  to  be\r\n\r\ndealt  with then.  And I hold out no promises  that  that\r\n\r\nwill change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen pointed out that this is a problem\r\n\r\nof  human  psychology.  He is absolutely right.   We  are\r\n\r\ndealing  with people.  We are dealing with human  beings.\r\n\r\nThey are frightened.  They are worried for themselves and\r\n\r\nfor  their  children.  They do not know how to react  and\r\n\r\nthey  are looking for leadership and guidance.  There  is\r\n\r\nfear.  There is denial.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd  as  the Chinese and the Hongkongers point  out,  the\r\n\r\nfear  of  SARS is more damaging to the economy than  SARS\r\n\r\nitself.  Because when you fear, you stay at home, you  do\r\n\r\nnot go out, you do not spend, you do not do anything, and\r\n\r\neverything grinds to a halt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to overcome this, and understand that these\r\n\r\nare  human problems.  We are all afraid of getting  sick.\r\n\r\nNobody  welcomes illness.  Your fever goes  up  a  little\r\n\r\nbit, you say, \"Something has gone wrong. Better take  the\r\n\r\ntemperature  again.\"   We have been  taking  temperatures\r\n\r\ndaily  in MTI and MOF. The first day, I was 37.1.  My  PA\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"You  are the champion.\"  I thought that  was  bad\r\n\r\nnews  but  I  still passed.  The next day, it  was  37.3,\r\n\r\nstuck in the right ear.  So I said, \"No, no.  Let's check\r\n\r\nmy  left  ear.\"   The left ear was lower.   It  is  human\r\n\r\npsychology.   You wish not to believe.   Today,  it  went\r\n\r\nback down to 36.8, so I am standing here.  That is just a\r\n\r\nsmall example of how frightened people can be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I have SARS? I wish I did not have. Maybe I am\r\n\r\nmistaken.   It  is  not really a fever.   If  I  see  the\r\n\r\nsinseh,  he  may  give me some banlangen  or  some  magic\r\n\r\npotion.   Or  take some garlic and vinegar and  then  all\r\n\r\nwill  be well. So, you have people who go from sinseh  to\r\n\r\nsinseh  and GP to GP, anything but confronting the truth,\r\n\r\nthe  awful  possibility that maybe you do have  SARS  and\r\n\r\nneed  to  go  to  Tan  Tock  Seng  Hospital.    And  that\r\n\r\npsychological  hurdle to, firstly, acknowledge  that  you\r\n\r\nmay have SARS, and, secondly, if you do have SARS, to  go\r\n\r\nto  Tan Tock Seng Hospital before you infect your family.\r\n\r\nEach one of those is a very big psychological hurdle  for\r\n\r\npeople  to  take.   So we have got to make  it  easy  for\r\n\r\npeople  to  make  these steps.  And it means  explaining,\r\n\r\nshowing them Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  I hear all sorts of\r\n\r\nHokkien  meanings that have been attributed to  Tan  Tock\r\n\r\nSeng  Hospital, but it is a perfectly safe place  and  we\r\n\r\nhave to get people to understand that.  If you have SARS,\r\n\r\ngoing in early is your best chance of coming out.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You also have to help people to be willing to take\r\n\r\nproper  measurements of their temperatures. And  we  have\r\n\r\ngot  to get people to watch out for each other - at work,\r\n\r\nin  their families.  So even if you are in denial,  which\r\n\r\nis a natural human reaction, your spouse, your parents or\r\n\r\nyour children would say, \"No, I think you are sick.   You\r\n\r\nbetter  go.\"  And they will badger you, harangue you  and\r\n\r\nnag  you until you go and see a doctor - not a sinseh,  a\r\n\r\ndoctor.   Through  this community support,  we  can  hold\r\n\r\ntogether and overcome this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no medical cure for SARS. We are not\r\n\r\nabsolutely  sure if the treatments will work except  that\r\n\r\nthey  will help to support you through the very difficult\r\n\r\nstage  of  the  illness.  But there is  a  public  health\r\n\r\nsolution  which  can  keep the disease  down  as  low  as\r\n\r\npossible  and  keep the transmission under  control.   We\r\n\r\nwill give everybody a thermometer.  I do not truly expect\r\n\r\nthat  100%  of Singaporeans would take their  temperature\r\n\r\nevery  day.  But if I can get 90% of Singaporeans  to  do\r\n\r\nthat,  and  if  a  super-spreader can be  detected  after\r\n\r\nspreading  to 2-3 people instead of 50, then  we  have  a\r\n\r\nchance  to bring the whole epidemic under control.   SARS\r\n\r\nmay  still be in the population, but the infection  level\r\n\r\nis something that we can live with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human beings have lived with such illnesses for\r\n\r\ngenerations.  Until this post-war generation, when  there\r\n\r\nwere   antibiotics,  people  lived  with  it  -   plague,\r\n\r\ndiphtheria, polio. It is quite common that you  will  get\r\n\r\nill, you will die at quite young ages, 30s or 40s - it is\r\n\r\npart of life and death.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Second World War, with antibiotics,\r\n\r\nsuddenly  people  felt  that  they  have  conquered   all\r\n\r\ndiseases.   They are eradicated, they are safe.   If  you\r\n\r\nare  sick,  you  go  to a doctor.  The doctor  gives  you\r\n\r\nmedicine.  Take the injection, and you will be well.  And\r\n\r\nit  was  good  for about one generation.  Then,  you  had\r\n\r\nantibiotic   resistance.   You  had  malaria   which   is\r\n\r\nresistant.    Now,   you  have  tuberculosis   which   is\r\n\r\nresistant.  You have Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus\r\n\r\nAureus (MRSA),\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsomething  which  is  terrible, if the  hospital  is  not\r\n\r\ncareful,  you  can get it.  You have got AIDS,  which  is\r\n\r\nalso  a viral disease like this one.  After 20 years,  it\r\n\r\nis still around.  There are treatments but no vaccine. It\r\n\r\nis  a  shock  for  this generation.  But  for  the  older\r\n\r\npeople,  life used to be like that, and so life goes  on,\r\n\r\neven  with these problems.  And I think we have  to  have\r\n\r\nthat attitude.  After a while, the reality will sink  in.\r\n\r\nWe  can deal with it.  We can cope with it.  We can fight\r\n\r\nSARS and we can have life going on normally, fully and we\r\n\r\nwill  be able to come out on top of it.  So I think  that\r\n\r\nis  the  approach that we have to take and I will ask  Mr\r\n\r\nWong  Kan  Seng  to explain to you some of  the  specific\r\n\r\nthings that he has been doing in his ExCo.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I know many Members have raised some\r\n\r\nissues which, as Chairman of the Ministerial Committee, I\r\n\r\nwill try to answer them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SARS problem we face today is the most serious\r\n\r\nthreat to our healthcare system, economy and society.  As\r\n\r\nfar  as my experience goes, it is unprecedented.   It  is\r\n\r\nhere   to  stay  for  some  time.   The  Government   has\r\n\r\nmarshalled  all its resources to deal with  it  and  will\r\n\r\nspare  no  effort  in  containing  and  controlling   the\r\n\r\nproblem.  We have to continue to function and to carry on\r\n\r\nwith our lives, or we will come to a standstill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of the Ministerial Committee has thus been\r\n\r\nto  put in place all the possible measures to return life\r\n\r\nin  Singapore as near to normalcy as possible, with  some\r\n\r\nchanges  to the way we do things.  At the same  time,  we\r\n\r\nhave also been thinking through and working out plans  to\r\n\r\naddress  all the possible scenarios that could arise,  to\r\n\r\nprevent them from occurring if we can, and if not, ensure\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  well prepared to deal with  them  if  they\r\n\r\noccur.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Health has dealt in depth on the\r\n\r\nmeasures that have been taken on the medical front and in\r\n\r\nour\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhospitals  to  help  contain  SARS.   The  Deputy   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  himself  has  outlined the  many  precautionary\r\n\r\nmeasures that the Ministerial Committee has put in  place\r\n\r\nat our airports and land checkpoints, workplaces, markets\r\n\r\nand  hawker  centres,  to allay  public  concern  and  to\r\n\r\nprevent the spread of SARS.  He has also outlined some of\r\n\r\nthe scenarios that we have made plans for, if they should\r\n\r\noccur.  I will not repeat them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one point that I want to emphasise is that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  going all out to contain  the  spread  of\r\n\r\nSARS, to protect you and your family's health. For us  to\r\n\r\nsucceed  in  containing the SARS problem and  to  restore\r\n\r\nlife  in  Singapore  to  an  even  keel,  we  need  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  to  play  his  part.  Everyone  must   adopt\r\n\r\nsocially responsible behaviour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Deputy Prime Minister has pointed out, the\r\n\r\nentire  Government machinery has been mobilised to tackle\r\n\r\nthis  problem.  We cannot allow all these efforts  to  be\r\n\r\nundone  by some irresponsible individuals.  On a personal\r\n\r\nnote,  I find the behaviour of some of these Singaporeans\r\n\r\non  Home  Quarantine Orders very disappointing,  eg,  the\r\n\r\nwell-publicised  case of the irresponsible  and  cavalier\r\n\r\nattitude of the family of eight who are related to the 70-year  old  SARS  case in Pasir Panjang Wholesale  Market.\r\n\r\nThis  kind of behaviour is something that should  not  be\r\n\r\ncondoned, as people like them are putting many others  at\r\n\r\nrisk.  These individuals either clearly do not understand\r\n\r\nthe  seriousness of the situation or simply do  not  care\r\n\r\nabout  the  dangers  that their  actions  could  pose  to\r\n\r\nothers.   We  will  come down hard on such  irresponsible\r\n\r\nindividuals from now on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we have decided that we would no longer issue a\r\n\r\nmere warning when an individual is found to have breached\r\n\r\nhis   Home   Quarantine  Order.   We  would   immediately\r\n\r\nelectronically   tag  anyone  who   breaches   the   Home\r\n\r\nQuarantine  Order.   All individuals on  Home  Quarantine\r\n\r\nOrders  are  checked regularly via the electronic  camera\r\n\r\nthat  is installed in their homes.  The camera is on only\r\n\r\nwhen  they are told to switch it on and, therefore, would\r\n\r\nnot\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninvade  the  privacy of their homes.  The CISCO  officers\r\n\r\nwill then call these people on the telephone and ask them\r\n\r\nto turn on their camera.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, the Deputy Prime Minister said that he\r\n\r\nreceived a letter from somebody who said that some  smart\r\n\r\nalec  may do call-forwarding on his mobile phone, so that\r\n\r\nhe  can be roaming around, while pretending to be on Home\r\n\r\nQuarantine Order.  Let me tell them:  Do not try!  Anyone\r\n\r\nwho  is on Home Quarantine Order and uses call-forwarding\r\n\r\nwill  have  that  facility cut off.  In other  words,  he\r\n\r\ncannot  do  call-forwarding.  That is what we have  asked\r\n\r\nSingTel  to do.  In any case, when a person is  asked  to\r\n\r\nappear  before the camera, he or his other family members\r\n\r\nwho  are  on  home quarantine will also appear.   At  the\r\n\r\nother end, which is the CISCO office, CISCO officers will\r\n\r\nbe  able to match the faces and background with what they\r\n\r\nhave  taken  at  the  time  the  electronic  camera   was\r\n\r\ninstalled.  So, unless a person can put a big picture  of\r\n\r\nhis home background and pretend to be there, it is purely\r\n\r\nimpossible.  Whatever it is, he cannot try that any  more\r\n\r\nbecause  he will have no call-forwarding facility  during\r\n\r\nthe  period of his home quarantine.  So, when CISCO calls\r\n\r\nthe  person, he will be asked to turn on the  camera  and\r\n\r\nthat is how he will be checked.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who thought that they can pretend\r\n\r\nnot to be around.  So when CISCO calls, the telephone was\r\n\r\nnot  answered.   That  was one  of  the  things  that  my\r\n\r\nofficers  have experienced.  Let me tell them about  this\r\n\r\ntoo.   The moment he does not answer the telephone  after\r\n\r\nthree  calls,  and  they  will call  three  times,  CISCO\r\n\r\nofficers  would  be  at his home and he  will  be  tagged\r\n\r\nelectronically.  So do not try that too.   Also,  do  not\r\n\r\npretend  not  to be at home when you do not  want  to  be\r\n\r\nbothered.   There were people who were being  called  and\r\n\r\nsaid  that they did not want to be bothered.  Do not  try\r\n\r\nthat  also.   I do not think that all this is  worth  the\r\n\r\neffort,  because once a person is on electronic tag,  the\r\n\r\nmoment he leaves the home he will be noticed at the CISCO\r\n\r\noperation\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncentre.   He \"chao buay lat\".  So far, we have  put  nine\r\n\r\nsuch  persons  on  electronic tag after they  refused  to\r\n\r\nanswer after three calls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the amendments to the Infectious Diseases Act\r\n\r\nto  allow  for composition fines to be imposed,  we  will\r\n\r\nalso  not  hesitate to impose fines on these individuals.\r\n\r\nIf  such  measures still do not work, we will charge  the\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant type in court and have them thrown in  jail.\r\n\r\nIf you read the newspapers today, we have prepared one of\r\n\r\nour  prisons for this purpose.  I do not think it is very\r\n\r\ncomfortable to stay in prison during this period of  home\r\n\r\nquarantine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is unfortunate that we have to resort to\r\n\r\nsuch  tough  measures  to ensure that  Singaporeans  obey\r\n\r\ntheir  Home  Quarantine Orders.  But this  is  a  serious\r\n\r\nissue.   We  are  also  making  it  an  offence  for  any\r\n\r\nindividual  who lies to the doctor when the  doctor  asks\r\n\r\nhim  some  basic  questions provided by the  Director  of\r\n\r\nMedical Services, eg, whether he has a fever, whether  he\r\n\r\nhas  come  into  contact with any  suspect  or  any  SARS\r\n\r\npatient, whether he has been to a SARS affected country - other  than Singapore - of course, in the last  14  days,\r\n\r\nwhether  he has been doctor-hopping, and so on.   If  his\r\n\r\nanswers are: \"no\", \"no\", \"no\" to these questions, but  if\r\n\r\nfound  out later that he has done all those things,  then\r\n\r\nhe  will  be  committing an offence under the  Infectious\r\n\r\nDiseases  Act.   Sir, we do not want  to  implement  such\r\n\r\nmeasures  lightly, as we recognise the emotional  anxiety\r\n\r\nand  fear  of  some  of  these people  who  are  on  home\r\n\r\nquarantine.  They face anxiety and fear because  they  do\r\n\r\nnot  know whether they will become a candidate for  SARS.\r\n\r\nBut to win this battle against SARS, we cannot afford any\r\n\r\nkinks in our armour, otherwise we put the whole community\r\n\r\nat  risk,  and  the  consequential impact  will  be  very\r\n\r\ndisastrous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is an open economy. Our borders must\r\n\r\nremain  open and we want to continue to welcome tourists,\r\n\r\nvisitors and businessmen to our shores.  However, we must\r\n\r\nalso  put precautionary measures in place to isolate  and\r\n\r\ncontain the SARS\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproblem  at  our entry points.  Thus, while all  incoming\r\n\r\nair passengers from SARS-affected areas and all points in\r\n\r\nChina   are  subject  to  temperature  screening,  health\r\n\r\nadvisories  and health declaration cards have  also  been\r\n\r\nimplemented  at the other checkpoints.  Since  yesterday,\r\n\r\nwe  have deployed three thermal imaging scanners  at  the\r\n\r\nland   checkpoints.   One  each  has  been  deployed   at\r\n\r\nWoodlands  Checkpoints and Tuas to check the temperatures\r\n\r\nof  those  coming in by bus and those walking in  by  the\r\n\r\nCauseway  or the Second Link.  Another has been  deployed\r\n\r\nat Woodlands Checkpoint to check outgoing passengers.  We\r\n\r\nwill  deploy more of these thermal imaging scanners  over\r\n\r\nthe   next  two  weeks  at  the  airport  and  the   land\r\n\r\ncheckpoints.  In addition, manual temperature checks will\r\n\r\nalso  be  implemented  within  the  next  two  weeks  for\r\n\r\npassengers  coming in by car or motorcycles  at  the  two\r\n\r\nland  checkpoints.  It is simply not practical to  deploy\r\n\r\nthe  current thermal imaging scanners in the outdoor area\r\n\r\nbecause  the  temperature will fluctuate.   These  checks\r\n\r\nwill  be  done  at  the secondary check area  where  100%\r\n\r\nsecurity checks are now in place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a responsible member of the international\r\n\r\ncommunity,  Sir, we have also taken steps to ensure  that\r\n\r\nwe  do not inadvertently \"export\" SARS to the rest of the\r\n\r\nworld.  Temperature checks have thus been instituted  for\r\n\r\nall  outgoing passengers at Changi Airport  and  bus  and\r\n\r\nfoot  passengers at the Woodlands Checkpoint.  This  will\r\n\r\nbe extended to Tuas Checkpoint in the next two weeks.  In\r\n\r\naddition, we will ensure that SARS patients and those  on\r\n\r\nHQOs  are  not allowed to leave Singapore.   So,  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  that  they  can just run away and  go  to  another\r\n\r\ncountry  because it will also be noted.   When  they  are\r\n\r\ndiscovered  checking out from our immigration checkpoints\r\n\r\nthey  will  be picked up and the law will come down  very\r\n\r\nhard  on  them.  We have also taken similar precautionary\r\n\r\nmeasures at the ferry terminals, a point which one of the\r\n\r\nMembers raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also working very closely with the Malaysian\r\n\r\ngovernment  to exchange information on SARS patients  and\r\n\r\nminimise cross-border infection.  The Joint\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBorder  Working Group, comprising health and  immigration\r\n\r\nofficials  from  both  countries,  has  been  working  to\r\n\r\nestablish  the agreed protocols and procedures to  enable\r\n\r\nSARS  cases  to be detected at our land checkpoints.   We\r\n\r\nare also keen to share information with the Malaysians on\r\n\r\nsuspected  and  probable  SARS cases  that  have  claimed\r\n\r\ntravel  history  to Singapore.  We read about  that  from\r\n\r\ntime  to time that they have been to Singapore.  We  need\r\n\r\nsuch  information  because it would  tell  us  when  that\r\n\r\nperson  came to Singapore, where he went to and  whom  he\r\n\r\nmet.   All  this information is useful and  important  in\r\n\r\ndoing contact tracing and containing the spread of SARS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 11th April 2003, new work permit and\r\n\r\nEmployment  Pass  holders  from SARS-affected  areas  are\r\n\r\nplaced  on  a 10-day quarantine upon arrival.  Similarly,\r\n\r\nby   next   week,  once  all  the  necessary   logistical\r\n\r\narrangements are settled, we will also place all new  and\r\n\r\nreturning  foreign  students who  are  attending  private\r\n\r\nschools, and Professional Visit Pass (PVP) holders coming\r\n\r\nin for a month or more from SARS-affected areas, on a 10-day   quarantine  upon  their  arrival.   Family  members\r\n\r\naccompanying  the foreign students and  workers  will  be\r\n\r\nsubject to the 10-day quarantine requirement too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private schools and sponsors of the PVP\r\n\r\napplicants   will   be  required  to   arrange   suitable\r\n\r\naccommodation  where the student or  PVP  holder  can  be\r\n\r\nquarantined.  These foreign students, PVP applicants  and\r\n\r\nfamily  members  will  be subject  to  daily  temperature\r\n\r\nchecks.   The  private schools and sponsors of  the  PVPs\r\n\r\nwill also be required to hire doctors to conduct pre- and\r\n\r\npost-quarantine medical check-ups for them.  The  student\r\n\r\npass  or  Professional Visit Pass will only be issued  at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of the quarantine period, and upon presentation\r\n\r\nof  a  medical report to certify a clean bill of  health.\r\n\r\nWith these measures, we will minimise the possibility  of\r\n\r\ntransmission  of  SARS in the workplace, private  schools\r\n\r\nand  living quarters of foreign workers.  We have to take\r\n\r\nspecial measures to quarantine these groups of foreigners\r\n\r\nas they are more likely to live\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand mix with the wider Singaporean community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also beefing up all our contact tracing\r\n\r\ncapability   by  seconding  more  officers   from   other\r\n\r\nMinistries and statutory boards to assist the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHealth  and  the National Environment Agency  colleagues.\r\n\r\nThis will allow quicker and better contact tracing to  be\r\n\r\ndone  so that cases that have come in close contact  with\r\n\r\nprobable  SARS  patients  can  be  quickly  isolated  for\r\n\r\nfurther observation.   A public communication campaign is\r\n\r\nalready underway to educate people about SARS.  Pamphlets\r\n\r\nhave  been distributed and new ones would be printed  and\r\n\r\nissued.   We  have  also  put out  messages  through  the\r\n\r\ntelevision and radio to inform the public about SARS  and\r\n\r\nwhat  they  themselves can do to prevent  the  spread  of\r\n\r\nSARS.   The  radio will also be used to put  across  such\r\n\r\nmessages in dialect to reach out to senior citizens.   We\r\n\r\nare  also organising dialogue sessions to be held by  the\r\n\r\nAdvisors for all the grassroots leaders and residents.  I\r\n\r\nknow  some  Members have already done this and many  have\r\n\r\nplanned  to  do this in the next one to two  weeks.   The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister himself will chair a dialogue on 2nd  May\r\n\r\nto  talk to community and religious leaders, shopkeepers,\r\n\r\nstallholders and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help the public to remember the hotline numbers\r\n\r\nfor  SARS   -   I know that some say that it is  quite  a\r\n\r\nmouthful  and they cannot remember the present number   - the  general  inquiry hotline will be  changed  to  1800-3339999, which is a toll free line.  I think Members will\r\n\r\nlike this number.  And the hotline number to call for  an\r\n\r\nambulance  to  send  somebody to Tan Tock  Seng  Hospital\r\n\r\nshould  that person need to check if he has got  SARS  or\r\n\r\nnot  will  be  changed to 993.  This  is  a  three  digit\r\n\r\nnumber.   It is very easy to remember.  Members know  999\r\n\r\nfor   Police;   995  for  Civil  Defence  ambulance   for\r\n\r\nemergency,   but for suspected SARS cases  going  to  Tan\r\n\r\nTock  Seng Hospital, please dial 993, and not 995.  These\r\n\r\ntwo numbers will be effective from midnight this Sunday.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Member asked how Cabinet Members ensure that the\r\n\r\nCabinet  can  function.  This is of greatest interest  to\r\n\r\nus,  as Cabinet Members.  So, for a few of our colleagues\r\n\r\nlike  Mr  Khaw  Boon  Wan and the three  doctors,  Vivian\r\n\r\nBalakrishnan, Ng Eng Hen and Balaji, we have set up video\r\n\r\nconference facilities for them  -  for ourselves  in  the\r\n\r\nCabinet  room, and for them in a separate  room.   Should\r\n\r\nthey  decide to come to attend Cabinet meetings, but  not\r\n\r\ninside  the  Cabinet room, they can go to this  room  and\r\n\r\ntalk  to  us  and  we can see them just  as  Members  are\r\n\r\nlooking at me on the screen now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the MOS says that they do not have a\r\n\r\nproblem  because  they are fully garbed, gowned,  masked,\r\n\r\netc, when they walk around in hospitals, they decided  to\r\n\r\ntake  this  extraordinary step not to attend the  Cabinet\r\n\r\nmeetings  while they are on this combat team, because  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  a minor possibility that we can get  infected,\r\n\r\nthe consequences will be quite bad for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This same isolate and contain strategy must also\r\n\r\napply at the organisational level.  I just described  how\r\n\r\nthe  Cabinet  is  trying to do this, and  how  individual\r\n\r\nMinistries are also doing it.  The Ministry of Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry   has  been  working  very  closely   with   the\r\n\r\nbusinesses  to  advise and help them on the precautionary\r\n\r\nmeasures  that  they should put in place to  prevent  the\r\n\r\nspread  of  SARS  in the workplace, such  as  temperature\r\n\r\ntaking  every  day to check the staff and  the  visitors,\r\n\r\nsegregation  of  their  staff  into  two  teams  and  not\r\n\r\nallowing  cross-contamination and so on.  They have  also\r\n\r\nbeen  asked  to develop business continuity plans  should\r\n\r\nsomething happen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, such precautionary measures have also\r\n\r\nbeen  put  in  place  for all Government  agencies.   For\r\n\r\nexample, we take the temperature of ourselves every  day.\r\n\r\nEvery  Government officer is now given a thermometer  and\r\n\r\nhe  is  required to take his temperature and he  will  be\r\n\r\nsupervised  by  his supervisor.  All Government  agencies\r\n\r\nhave  also  developed  detailed operating  procedures  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard the health of their front-line staff who may be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexposed  to  SARS patients in the course of  their  work.\r\n\r\nThese  include  the Immigration and Checkpoint  Authority\r\n\r\nofficers,  and my Immigration officers were quite  aghast\r\n\r\nwhen  they  found  incoming  travellers  at  the  Airport\r\n\r\npulling two hand trolleys and then putting their passport\r\n\r\nin   between  their  teeth.   So,  we  decided  to   take\r\n\r\nprecautions  so  that  they  do  not  inadvertently   get\r\n\r\ninfected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also taking precautions for our Police\r\n\r\nofficers,   paramedics,  soldiers   and   so   on.    The\r\n\r\nconsequences  of a SARS infection spreading  through  the\r\n\r\npublic service will be a serious one and we cannot afford\r\n\r\nto  shut down a Government department or a Ministry.  The\r\n\r\nsame  applies  to  the  others, particularly  those  that\r\n\r\nprovide  essential  services, because essential  services\r\n\r\nsuch  as  water,  electricity and public  transport  must\r\n\r\ncontinue to be provided, even during an emergency.   This\r\n\r\nis  a very serious problem for us and we must continue to\r\n\r\nrun  these services in order to have life carry on as per\r\n\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also identified a temporary office site that\r\n\r\ncan be used for a Government department in the event that\r\n\r\nthe whole department has to be vacated and we need to  do\r\n\r\nsome    cleaning.     Back-up   information    technology\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  has  also been put in  place  to  service\r\n\r\nthis.  Remote access and telecommuting work solutions are\r\n\r\nalso  being developed for the public service.  The public\r\n\r\nare  also  being encouraged to make greater  use  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious electronic services that Government agencies have\r\n\r\nlaunched  over the years, so that they can  minimise  the\r\n\r\nlevel of physical interaction at the public counters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we take all the necessary precautions to\r\n\r\nprevent  the  spread of SARS, we also  plan  for  various\r\n\r\nscenarios for which quickness of response and the ability\r\n\r\nto   muster  resources  at  extremely  short  notice   is\r\n\r\nabsolutely  crucial.  Even when reacting to a  situation,\r\n\r\nwe have to be very fast.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just quote the example of the closure of the\r\n\r\nPasir  Panjang Wholesale Market.  Mr Lim Hng Kiang called\r\n\r\nme\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  Saturday at about 8 o'clock, and we discussed what to\r\n\r\ndo  about the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market in  view  of\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  cases  there.   After  we  assessed  the\r\n\r\nsituation, we thought that we should close the  Wholesale\r\n\r\nMarket,  so that we can contain the spread of  SARS,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  the best course of action we thought we  should\r\n\r\nimplement  immediately.  So, I directed the  Director  of\r\n\r\nOperations, Police HQ, to marshall the Police officers to\r\n\r\nget  to the ground with Environment, MOH and AVA officers\r\n\r\nto  immediately  quarantine the place;  in  other  words,\r\n\r\ntotally  enclose the place.  And then we  cleared  people\r\n\r\nout and registered them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had to find about 3,000-4,000 people who were, in\r\n\r\none way or another, involved, connected or doing business\r\n\r\nin the Wholesale Market, and it is a very large number of\r\n\r\npeople  to  be contacted.  So, to do that, the  following\r\n\r\nday  we again got together a group of officers, this time\r\n\r\nfrom  the Peoples' Association, because they have a  wide\r\n\r\nnetwork  on the ground, all the 84 constituency  officers\r\n\r\nplus  their  staff were gathered together and  they  were\r\n\r\ngiven  a list of names to do the contact tracing.   While\r\n\r\npeople  are being traced with the names and once we  know\r\n\r\nwhere  they  are  and  are actually in,  CISCO  officers,\r\n\r\ntogether with another 100 Civil Defence officers, went to\r\n\r\nthe  homes to serve them with Home Quarantine Orders  and\r\n\r\nto  fix  the electronic cameras.  And we also  had  Civil\r\n\r\nDefence  officers  to  volunteer to become  interpreters,\r\n\r\nbecause  the people we contact may not speak Mandarin  or\r\n\r\nEnglish.  So we had to have interpreters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just the immediate action that we took to\r\n\r\ntrace,  contact, to serve the Home Quarantine Orders  and\r\n\r\nto  put  in the electronic cameras.  But there  are  many\r\n\r\nregular  retailers who go to the Pasir Panjang  Wholesale\r\n\r\nMarket and we thought it would be a useful measure if  we\r\n\r\nwere  also  to do temperature taking at all our  markets,\r\n\r\nand  that  is how we activated the PA network again  with\r\n\r\nour  community leaders, merchant and hawker associations,\r\n\r\nwith  Town Council staff and many others, to quickly help\r\n\r\nconduct temperature taking.  And the briefing was done on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMonday  afternoon.   Monday evening, they  went  back  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  with their own people together with the  hawkers\r\n\r\nthemselves  and  the following day, some  were  ready  to\r\n\r\nroll,  and  by now they have covered many of the  markets\r\n\r\nand  hawker  centres.  Because this  is  an  effort  that\r\n\r\ndepends  on  the  community, and we know  that  community\r\n\r\nleaders  are  volunteers, unless they are  housewives  or\r\n\r\nretirees.  So it is not possible to make this a sustained\r\n\r\neffort  in  taking body temperature of  every  hawker  or\r\n\r\nhawker   assistant.   From  tomorrow  onwards,   National\r\n\r\nEnvironment Agency officers  -  although they  were  also\r\n\r\ninvolved in the earlier task  -  will take over the  task\r\n\r\nof  temperature-taking for about 20,000 stallholders  and\r\n\r\ntheir  stall  assistants.   This  will  then  make  it  a\r\n\r\nsustainable effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Ministry of the Environment and the Town\r\n\r\nCouncils  have  done  thorough  checks  and  taken  extra\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  ensure  that the  Hong  Kong  Amoy  Gardens\r\n\r\nscenario  should not occur here, we take no chances.   We\r\n\r\nhave identified and prepared two HDB blocks to be used as\r\n\r\nemergency  housing in the event that we have  to  move  a\r\n\r\nwhole block of residents to another block should the need\r\n\r\narise.   I hope that this will not come about, but should\r\n\r\nit happen or has to happen, then at least we are prepared\r\n\r\nfor  this eventuality.  This is to protect the residents.\r\n\r\nI  know  that they will be inconvenienced but that cannot\r\n\r\nbe  helped because investigations have to be carried  out\r\n\r\nsmoothly and without hindrance for us to identify whether\r\n\r\nthere  are other causes that could lead to, say,  several\r\n\r\ncases  of unconnected residents living in the same  block\r\n\r\nhaving  SARS.   We hope that there would not  be  such  a\r\n\r\ncase.  But should that be the situation, then we may have\r\n\r\nto activate a plan like that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The logistics and utilities as well as the\r\n\r\noperational  plan to effect such a mass  evacuation  have\r\n\r\nalready   been  worked  out.   So,  while  we  take   all\r\n\r\nprecautionary measures, we cannot afford to be complacent\r\n\r\nthinking  that everything is fine with all these measures\r\n\r\nin place.  We still\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  got  to think through and review and refine  as  we\r\n\r\ngain experience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the actions at the individual and national\r\n\r\nlevels  are not enough, because SARS is a global  problem\r\n\r\n-   in  Asia,  America, Europe.  To fully  contain  SARS,\r\n\r\ninternational cooperation is essential.  Such cooperation\r\n\r\nis  already happening on the medical front where  medical\r\n\r\nprofessions  share information; they share  the  research\r\n\r\nthat  they have done and so on.  The significant  strides\r\n\r\nmade  on  this  within a short time in the fight  against\r\n\r\nSARS shows what could be achieved if nations are prepared\r\n\r\nto  work  together to overcome this problem, provided  we\r\n\r\nall work on it together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the ASEAN Leaders will be meeting in Bangkok\r\n\r\nnext  Tuesday  together with their Health  Ministers  and\r\n\r\nMinisters  in charge of immigration matters,  to  discuss\r\n\r\nthe  measures that ASEAN member nations could take  as  a\r\n\r\ncollective group to keep our borders open and to  contain\r\n\r\nthe  spread  of SARS. Ideally, we should also  get  to  a\r\n\r\nposition  where we can assure the rest of the world  that\r\n\r\nit  is  safe to travel in and out of ASEAN.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nit  is encouraging to note that China and Hong Kong  also\r\n\r\nrecognise the importance of global cooperation  and  they\r\n\r\nmay also be joining the meeting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, whether we like it or not, SARS\r\n\r\nwill  be with us for some time.  It is important that  we\r\n\r\ndo  not allow ourselves to be defeated and continue  with\r\n\r\nour  normal life with suitable adjustments.  As  long  as\r\n\r\nthe  necessary  precautionary  measures  are  taken,  all\r\n\r\nactivities can and should continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that the majority of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave  already  made the adjustments and are  carrying  on\r\n\r\nwith  their normal lives.  This is evident from the  many\r\n\r\nmass  community events that are going on  as  planned  as\r\n\r\nwell as the crowds at hawker centres and food courts.   I\r\n\r\nmyself was at a restaurant last Saturday and it was full.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, Sir, the Government is treating this\r\n\r\nthreat very seriously.  Attention is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npaid  at  the highest level, and the Government will  not\r\n\r\nlet  up  on its efforts to contain and overcome the  SARS\r\n\r\nsituation.   If  all  Singaporeans  cooperate  and   stay\r\n\r\nunited,  we  will  weather this crisis like  many  others\r\n\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Two supplementary\r\n\r\nquestions, Mr Speaker, Sir.  For the Minister for  Health\r\n\r\n-  if  people are afraid of going to TTSH because of  the\r\n\r\nirrational fear that TTSH is highly contagious, will  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  consider setting up an intermediate testing  or\r\n\r\nholding  centre at a different location for  suspect  and\r\n\r\nprobable   cases?   This  will  actually  alleviate   the\r\n\r\npublic's  concern and encourage more people  to  be  more\r\n\r\nwilling to approach this intermediate medical centre  for\r\n\r\nSARS  testing, rather than to avoid it totally.  This  is\r\n\r\nhuman psychology at work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question for the Minister for Home Affairs - how much is one thermal imaging scanner? If private\r\n\r\ncorporations  are  interested to  install  one  at  their\r\n\r\nbusiness  premises to check for SARS, will it be possible\r\n\r\nand allowed?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I was a bit interrupted\r\n\r\nthere.   But  as I understand it, Mr Chia is  asking  how\r\n\r\nmuch  does  each  thermal  scanner  cost.   Is  that  his\r\n\r\nquestion?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Yes, and whether it would\r\n\r\nbe  allowed  for private companies and corporations  that\r\n\r\nwant to install it at their premises to test for SARS.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, this thermal imaging scanner\r\n\r\nis  a scarce resource.  Right now, we do not have many of\r\n\r\nthem,  and  we have to depend on the company  to  produce\r\n\r\nthis.  But because of the urgency of this matter, we have\r\n\r\ndecided  to  take from them first and started  to  deploy\r\n\r\nthem at our airports and land checkpoints.  How much does\r\n\r\nit  cost?   I  was  told  it is  more  than  $100,000  or\r\n\r\nthereabouts.  So it shows that we are sparing no efforts,\r\n\r\nincluding the price of this scanner, to install  as  many\r\n\r\nas we can, because we have to deal with this immediately.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> When the supply is more in\r\n\r\nthe future, and because\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSARS  is  going to stay with us for quite some  time,  if\r\n\r\nprivate   companies  request  to  install  it  at   their\r\n\r\npremises, will that be allowed?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, we have to see how we want\r\n\r\nto  maximise this scarce resource.

Just\r\n\r\nnow  I  think  Mr Lim Hng Kiang was under the  impression\r\n\r\nthat  I questioned the validity of the home as a suitable\r\n\r\nplace for home quarantine.  I fully agree with that as  a\r\n\r\nmedical practitioner.  I was actually trying to refer  to\r\n\r\npeople   who  were  recalcitrant  in  trying   to   break\r\n\r\nquarantine,  and  Mr Wong Kan Seng has told  us  what  he\r\n\r\nwould  be  doing for that group of people.  But, perhaps,\r\n\r\nhe  might want to address the group who is given  a  Home\r\n\r\nQuarantine Order because of a contact at work,  and  then\r\n\r\nbecause  they are living with maybe distant relatives  or\r\n\r\nactually  renting  a  room, find  that  the  relative  or\r\n\r\nlandlord saying, \"Look.  Please, I don't want you  to  be\r\n\r\nin the same household.\"  What do they do then?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Could I seek clarifications, Sir? The\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health earlier mentioned that we  have  had\r\n\r\nthis  epidemiological study group all this while.  May  I\r\n\r\nask him what kind of study results have been obtained  so\r\n\r\nfar  and  could he share that with us?  The Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  also said earlier that all the medical  staff  in\r\n\r\nour  public  hospitals  are protected  with  face  masks.\r\n\r\nCould  I  ask him whether face masks are sufficient?   Or\r\n\r\nshould  they  don  space suit outfits as  well?   Is  the\r\n\r\nconjunctiva  of the eyes not an entry route for  viruses?\r\n\r\nCould I also ask him whether Tan Tock Seng Hospital could\r\n\r\nshare their good practices with other hospitals?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Health also said earlier that anti-viral drugs are being used by our doctors in our public\r\n\r\nhospitals.   Can I ask him whether it is correct  to  say\r\n\r\nthat   there   is  no  medicine  that  can  combat   SARS\r\n\r\ncoronavirus?   Why  then  are  our  doctors   using   the\r\n\r\navailable  anti-viral drugs now that they have many  side\r\n\r\neffects?   The  Minister also did not answer  my  earlier\r\n\r\nquestion on public directives for better containment  and\r\n\r\ncontact tracing of SARS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister said earlier that those\r\n\r\nunder  quarantine can claim $70 a day.  But it  has  also\r\n\r\nbeen  mentioned that they can claim $70 from the  Courage\r\n\r\nFund.  Does it mean that now they can claim $140 a day?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Steve Chia asked whether we\r\n\r\ncan  have a different facility as intermediate care.   In\r\n\r\nfact, that is possible by going to the polyclinic.   But,\r\n\r\nof  course, if you know that you have contact with a SARS\r\n\r\npatient, then I think you should go directly to TTSH.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Warren Lee asked whether we can have alternative\r\n\r\nhome   arrangements.   As  I  have   tried   to   explain\r\n\r\npainstakingly,  the person who is on home  quarantine  is\r\n\r\nwell and is not infectious until he has the symptoms.  So\r\n\r\nhe  can  continue renting a room or staying at home.   It\r\n\r\nwould  be  very  difficult for  us  to  make  alternative\r\n\r\narrangements  for  accommodation for all  people  serving\r\n\r\nHQOs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked about the epidemiological study.\r\n\r\nI am no expert.  I will get my staff to give her whatever\r\n\r\nthey  have  found out.  For the staff who are  in  direct\r\n\r\ncontact  with  unknown or potential SARS  patients,  like\r\n\r\npeople  in  the A&E, ICU and emergency departments  where\r\n\r\nthey have to deal with potential SARS patients, then they\r\n\r\nput  on  the  full suit, together with the goggles.   For\r\n\r\nthose who have to do actual interventions, then they  put\r\n\r\non  the  hoods.   That  is how I  have  explained  in  my\r\n\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no cure for SARS. In the early stages,\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  thought that Ribavirin would be useful.   The\r\n\r\nclinicians  in Singapore are not as aggressive  in  their\r\n\r\napproach  as the Hongkongers.  I think we are  closer  to\r\n\r\nthe  American  clinicians and, therefore,  we  have  used\r\n\r\nRibavirin  very, very conservatively, because we  realise\r\n\r\nthe toxic side effects of this anti-viral regime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public directives - we are building up the contact\r\n\r\ntracing setup, organisation, data collection, as Mr  Wong\r\n\r\nKan  Seng  explained.   And when these  things  are  more\r\n\r\nsystematic,  of  course, we will then be  able  to  issue\r\n\r\nthese out in proper public directives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some confusion on the Courage Fund. The\r\n\r\nCourage Fund offers up to $70 per day for people who come\r\n\r\nforward   for  screening  and  who  are  then  held   for\r\n\r\nobservation.   Because we felt that  for  some  of  these\r\n\r\npeople  in the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre, especially\r\n\r\nthe  casual  workers,  if they are  served  with  a  Home\r\n\r\nQuarantine Order, then what DPM announced today will kick\r\n\r\nin,  and  they will be given the financial support.   But\r\n\r\neven  just to come forward for screening, and you have  a\r\n\r\ntemperature  and you are held in Tan Tock  Seng  Hospital\r\n\r\nfor  observation for a few days, there may be a  loss  of\r\n\r\nincome  for these people.  So the Courage Fund  has  come\r\n\r\nforward  to say that for screening and observation,  they\r\n\r\nwill also provide the financial support for up to $70 per\r\n\r\nday.   So  there  is  no  double  payment  for  the  Home\r\n\r\nQuarantine Order people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I hope Members have exhausted all\r\n\r\nquestions.

At that time, I informed the House that a private\r\n\r\nsector-led committee, called the Company Legislation  and\r\n\r\nRegulatory Framework Committee, was doing a comprehensive\r\n\r\nreview of our company law.  The Committee was chaired  by\r\n\r\nDr  Philip Pillai, Senior Partner of Shook Lin & Bok, and\r\n\r\ncomprised  lawyers, businessmen, academics and Government\r\n\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After extensive deliberations, including two rounds\r\n\r\nof public consultation, the Committee submitted its final\r\n\r\nreport to the Government in October 2002 with a set of 77\r\n\r\nrecommendations.   All  the  recommendations  have   been\r\n\r\naccepted for implementation.  These recommendations  will\r\n\r\nhelp to simplify business regulations,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncreate  a more conducive business environment, and  lower\r\n\r\nthe   costs   of  capital  raising  and  maintenance   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   They  also  improve  Singapore's   corporate\r\n\r\ngovernance  and  regulatory  framework,  and  align   our\r\n\r\npractices with the leading jurisdictions.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.42 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the Committee's\r\n\r\nrecommendations will require amendments to the  Companies\r\n\r\nAct,  the Securities and Futures Act, and the SGX listing\r\n\r\nrules.   It  will  also  require  the  enactment  of  new\r\n\r\nlegislation, such as the Limited Partnerships Act and the\r\n\r\nLimited  Liability Partnerships Act.  The  amendments  to\r\n\r\nthe Companies Act will be done in two phases.  This Bill,\r\n\r\nwhich   seeks   to   implement  20  of  the   Committee's\r\n\r\nrecommendations,   is  the  first   phase.    The   other\r\n\r\nrecommendations  require more complex amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nCompanies Act, and will be implemented later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now highlight the main amendments\r\n\r\nproposed in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Reducing Business Costs</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote entrepreneurship, our company law must\r\n\r\nnot impose unnecessary regulatory burden on start-ups and\r\n\r\nsmall  private companies.  Unlike public companies  where\r\n\r\nthere  are  greater  public  interests  to  protect,  for\r\n\r\nprivate  companies we need to strike a different balance,\r\n\r\nin  order to maintain acceptable standards while  keeping\r\n\r\nbusiness  costs low.  I shall now highlight some  of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee's  recommendations that  will  help  to  reduce\r\n\r\nbusiness  costs  for  small  and  private  companies   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Removing the Statutory Audit Requirement</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, all companies in Singapore are required\r\n\r\nby  law  to  have their accounts audited by  an  external\r\n\r\nauditor.  Clause 35\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\namends   section  205  to  remove  the  statutory   audit\r\n\r\nrequirement  for  dormant companies, as  statutory  audit\r\n\r\nserves  no  public purpose and imposes unnecessary  costs\r\n\r\nfor  such companies.  A dormant company is defined in the\r\n\r\nCompanies Act as a company with no significant accounting\r\n\r\ntransactions during the financial year.  The  removal  of\r\n\r\nstatutory audit for dormant companies is in line with the\r\n\r\npractices in UK and Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 35 further amends section 205 to remove the\r\n\r\nstatutory  audit  requirement for  small  exempt  private\r\n\r\ncompanies.    An  exempt  private company  is  a  private\r\n\r\ncompany  with not more than 20 shareholders who  are  all\r\n\r\nnatural persons.  More than 75% of companies in Singapore\r\n\r\nare  exempt  private companies.  Most of them are  owner-managed.   This means that all the shareholders are  also\r\n\r\ndirectors of the company.  For such companies, audit will\r\n\r\nbe  left as a business decision, instead of being imposed\r\n\r\nas a legal requirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee had initially considered removing the\r\n\r\nstatutory  audit  requirement  for  all  exempt   private\r\n\r\ncompanies.    However,  after  receiving  feedback   from\r\n\r\nbusinesses and auditors, the Committee decided  to  adopt\r\n\r\nthe  approach in UK and Australia, where statutory  audit\r\n\r\nis   removed  only  for  small  private  companies.   The\r\n\r\nthreshold for defining small companies will be  based  on\r\n\r\nturnover,  which could be raised over time.   After  much\r\n\r\ndeliberation,  the  Committee  recommended  removing  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  audit requirement for exempt private companies\r\n\r\nwith  annual  turnover below $5 million.  The  Government\r\n\r\nhas  accepted the Committee's recommendation, but decided\r\n\r\nto  implement  it  in  two steps, to  give  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity and the audit firms some time to adjust to  the\r\n\r\nnew  arrangement.  The prescribed revenue threshold  will\r\n\r\nfirst be set at $2.5 million when this Bill becomes  law,\r\n\r\nand raised to $5 million one year later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the public consultation, there were some\r\n\r\nconcerns  that the removal of statutory audit would  lead\r\n\r\nto a deterioration in corporate governance standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis  should not happen.  For public companies and  large\r\n\r\nprivate   companies,  audit  would  remain  a   statutory\r\n\r\nrequirement.   For  small exempt  private  companies,  it\r\n\r\nmakes sense to leave audit as a business decision.  There\r\n\r\nis  no  public interest at stake.  In addition,  adequate\r\n\r\nsafeguards   will   be  put  in  place.    For   example,\r\n\r\nshareholders  representing at least 5% of  the  company's\r\n\r\nshares   can  compel  the  company  to  prepare   audited\r\n\r\naccounts.   All  companies  must  also  maintain   proper\r\n\r\naccounting records and prepare \"true and fair\"  financial\r\n\r\nstatements   that   comply  with  prescribed   accounting\r\n\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Professionally Qualified Company Secretaries</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, professionally qualified company secretaries.\r\n\r\nAnother  move  to reduce business cost is to  remove  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  requirement for private companies  to  appoint\r\n\r\nprofessionally   qualified  company   secretaries.    The\r\n\r\nprivate  company must still appoint a company  secretary,\r\n\r\nbut  this  person  need  not be a lawyer,  accountant  or\r\n\r\nprofessional company secretary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, all companies in Singapore are required\r\n\r\nto  appoint a professionally qualified company secretary.\r\n\r\nIn  contrast, in Australia, Hong Kong and UK, there is no\r\n\r\nsuch  requirement for private companies.  The requirement\r\n\r\nin Singapore was instituted in 1987 as a means to improve\r\n\r\nthe  quality of corporate records of Singapore companies.\r\n\r\nWhile  the  requirement is a useful safeguard for  public\r\n\r\ncompanies, it is not necessary to impose this on  private\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Such companies can choose to have an employee\r\n\r\nor director to perform the company secretarial functions.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, they can outsource to firms which  provide\r\n\r\ncompany secretarial support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some company secretaries and accountants have\r\n\r\nexpressed  concerns that the Committee's  recommendations\r\n\r\nwould  lead  to job losses for company secretarial  firms\r\n\r\nand  audit  firms.   The Government is mindful  of  these\r\n\r\nconcerns.   However, we do not think that the demand  for\r\n\r\nservices  provided by audit firms and company secretaries\r\n\r\nwould disappear as a result of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthese  changes.  According to a survey conducted  by  the\r\n\r\nAssociation  of Small and Medium Enterprises,  more  than\r\n\r\n50%  of the companies surveyed indicated that they  would\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  engage  professionally  qualified   company\r\n\r\nsecretaries, even if the law does not require them to  do\r\n\r\nso.   In  addition, 78% of the companies said they  would\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  have  their  accounts  audited,  as   their\r\n\r\nshareholders  or  external parties,  such  as  banks  and\r\n\r\nfinance companies, would require audited accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Simpler Business Regulations</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight some of the amendments that\r\n\r\nwill help to simplify the regulations faced by companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Written Resolutions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the shareholders of a private company can\r\n\r\npass  a  resolution without having to meet  face-to-face.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  passing  of  the resolution  requires  the\r\n\r\napproval  of  all shareholders.  This is  not  consistent\r\n\r\nwith  the  approval thresholds for resolutions passed  at\r\n\r\nface-to-face  meetings,  where ordinary  resolutions  and\r\n\r\nspecial  resolutions would require 50% and  75%  approval\r\n\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 29 amends section 184 to allow private\r\n\r\ncompanies  to pass ordinary and special resolutions  with\r\n\r\n50%   and   75%  approval,  regardless  of  whether   the\r\n\r\nresolutions are passed at a face-to-face meeting  or  via\r\n\r\nwritten  means.   The amendment will also  allow  written\r\n\r\nresolutions  to be passed through the use  of  electronic\r\n\r\ncommunication channels, such as email.  This will  enable\r\n\r\nprivate  companies  to make decisions more  expeditiously\r\n\r\nand conveniently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a safeguard, a shareholder or a group of\r\n\r\nshareholders representing at least 5% of the total voting\r\n\r\nrights  can  require the company to hold  a  face-to-face\r\n\r\nmeeting  to discuss and vote on the resolution.  This  is\r\n\r\nto   ensure  that  the  company  does  not  use   written\r\n\r\nresolutions as a means to deprive dissenting shareholders\r\n\r\nof the opportunity to be heard at a face-to-face meeting.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Annual General Meetings</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, private companies are required to hold\r\n\r\nannual  general  meetings every year.  Clause  26  amends\r\n\r\nsection  175 to allow a private company to dispense  with\r\n\r\nits annual general meeting if all its shareholders agree.\r\n\r\nThis  change is consistent with the practice in  the  UK.\r\n\r\nIt will benefit private companies, especially those where\r\n\r\nall the shareholders are also directors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, company law reform is an on-going process. The review by the Company Legislation and\r\n\r\nRegulatory  Framework Committee marks a significant  step\r\n\r\nforward,  but  it is not the end.  We need  to  regularly\r\n\r\nreview  our  laws and regulations to ensure  they  remain\r\n\r\nbusiness-friendly and keep up with the practices  in  the\r\n\r\nleading  jurisdictions.  Such reviews  will  require  the\r\n\r\ncollaboration  of the private sector and the  Government,\r\n\r\nand the active interest of all stakeholders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  in  the Companies (Amendment)  Bill.   I\r\n\r\nwelcome  the  various moves which are undertaken  in  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of  ensuring that the company law and  regulatory\r\n\r\nframework  for Singapore is modern, accords  with  global\r\n\r\nstandards  and  one  which  will  promote  a  competitive\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is in this same spirit that I will focus on\r\n\r\nthe  issue of definition of substantial shareholding  for\r\n\r\ncompliance  purposes.   The  interpretation  of  the  new\r\n\r\nsection  83,  as  described in clause 10,  like  the  old\r\n\r\nsection 83, will continue to have far-reaching effects on\r\n\r\ncapital markets here, not least of all, our stock market.\r\n\r\nAny  over-zealousness, witting or unwitting, to  apply  a\r\n\r\nmore  conservative  interpretation than  necessary,  will\r\n\r\nserve  to  stifle  our  own  stock  market  growth,   and\r\n\r\nultimately  to limit the ability of our listed  companies\r\n\r\nto raise capital.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to elaborate. Clause 10 of the Bill\r\n\r\nrepeals and re-enacts section 83 to require the reporting\r\n\r\nof   changes  in  substantial  shareholding   where   the\r\n\r\nshareholding  exceeds  discrete 1% threshold,  above  the\r\n\r\nminimum 5% threshold, the 5% level being defined as  what\r\n\r\nwould constitute a substantial shareholding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an improvement from the present position,\r\n\r\nwhich  is, I believe, similar to that being done  in  the\r\n\r\nUK.   But,  Sir, this does not address the dilemma  being\r\n\r\nfaced  by  funds,  particularly big funds,  investing  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The underlying challenge is one of  the  need\r\n\r\nfor   international  fund  managers  to   aggregate   the\r\n\r\ninterests of the various funds which they operate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, the approach has been, like in the UK, to\r\n\r\naggregate  shareholdings across all associated  entities,\r\n\r\nincluding funds, within a corporate group.  This approach\r\n\r\nrequires  review,  especially  in  the  context  of   our\r\n\r\ncircumstances where our companies are relatively  smaller\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  market capitalisation and where  there  is\r\n\r\ninsufficient breadth of investible companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, international fund managers manage a variety of\r\n\r\nfunds,    comprising   typically   mutual    funds    and\r\n\r\ninstitutional  funds for which they serve  as  investment\r\n\r\nadvisors.   These funds are developed for investors  with\r\n\r\nvarying  needs  and  requirements  subject  to  different\r\n\r\ninvestment   objectives,  time  horizon  guidelines   and\r\n\r\nrestrictions.  The funds also invest in a wide  range  of\r\n\r\ninvestments,  such as equities, bonds  and  money  market\r\n\r\ninstruments.   No  two funds within the  same  group  are\r\n\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real test of control, which is essentially the\r\n\r\nunderlying focus, is in the voting of shares.   Within  a\r\n\r\ncorporate  group,  there may be  a  number  of  entities,\r\n\r\nincluding companies, funds and managed investment schemes\r\n\r\nwhich hold voting shares in the same listed company.   In\r\n\r\ndeciding  how  to  vote  their shares,  the  entity,  for\r\n\r\nexample, a fund, must act in the best\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninterests  of  its members.  This may not necessarily  be\r\n\r\naligned  with the interest of the corporate  group  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole nor of the other entities within the group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in light of the differing nature of the funds,\r\n\r\nshareholdings should not be aggregated across  the  funds\r\n\r\nfor   the  purposes  of  complying  with  the  disclosure\r\n\r\nrequirement of substantial shareholding interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me highlight this unsatisfactory treatment in\r\n\r\nreal  operating terms, to bring home the extent to  which\r\n\r\nwe   are   imposing  unduly  high  compliance  costs   on\r\n\r\ninternational fund managers investing in Singapore.   One\r\n\r\nmajor fund manager recounted how his group's filings  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  accounted  for 17%  of  the  total,  when  the\r\n\r\ngroup's  holdings  represented a mere  1%  of  the  total\r\n\r\nexposure.  Another fund manager has a department of  four\r\n\r\nindividuals  dedicated to ensuring such  compliance,  but\r\n\r\nwith  no clear idea of what the value-add is.  Of course,\r\n\r\nit  can be argued that a similar trend can be drawn  from\r\n\r\nthe  UK investments.  However, the practical question is:\r\n\r\ncan these fund managers ignore the UK market?  The answer\r\n\r\nis  no.  Can they ignore the Singapore market?  I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  we should be deluded into thinking that they  have\r\n\r\nto be invested in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, this is not the only cost. The real cost\r\n\r\nis  in  the consequential curtailing of the liquidity  of\r\n\r\nour own listed companies and their ability to tap capital\r\n\r\nfrom  a  wider shareholding base.  Investors of Singapore\r\n\r\nequities  fight shy of raising exposure in the fear  that\r\n\r\nthey  may  breach  the  law as a group  even  though  the\r\n\r\ndecisions are frequently undertaken independently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore propose that, in instances where\r\n\r\ninternational fund managers acquire listed shares not for\r\n\r\npurposes  of  control  and where the  funds  are  managed\r\n\r\nseparately,  they  be allowed to apply for  an  exemption\r\n\r\nfrom aggregating the interests in respect of funds.  This\r\n\r\ncan be done on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential that we keep pace with changing\r\n\r\nmarket practices.  My proposal\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  reduce the compliance burden of the international\r\n\r\nfund  managers and result in more meaningful  disclosure.\r\n\r\nIt  will also go a long way towards enhancing Singapore's\r\n\r\nposition as a wealth management centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Companies\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present first instalment of amendments to the\r\n\r\nCompanies  Act  comes  not long  after  the  Government's\r\n\r\nannouncement of its adoption of all 77 recommendations of\r\n\r\nthe Companies Legislation and Regulatory Framework Review\r\n\r\nCommittee   (CLRFC).    That   it   comes   so    quickly\r\n\r\ndemonstrates,  to  many  in the business  community,  the\r\n\r\nseriousness  of intent on the part of the  Government  in\r\n\r\ntrying to reform and review the companies regulatory  and\r\n\r\nlegislative  framework  in Singapore,  just  to  make  it\r\n\r\nrelevant  and  to help enhance the value  proposition  of\r\n\r\nSingapore as a place to do business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, the focus on reducing the cost of\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  Singapore could not have  come  at  a  more\r\n\r\nappropriate  time.  Against the backdrop  of  an  already\r\n\r\nweakened  economy, businesses in Singapore are  presently\r\n\r\nbracing  themselves for tougher times ahead.  The effects\r\n\r\nof  the deadly SARS virus are beginning to bite hard into\r\n\r\nour economy.  Already, we are seeing how people have been\r\n\r\nlaid off in the airline industry because of poor business\r\n\r\nprospects  and  taxi drivers having to  take  home  less,\r\n\r\nbecause of a general public fear of contracting the virus\r\n\r\nwhile riding in a taxi.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time like this, any move by the Government to\r\n\r\nreduce  cost, and in particular business cost, is welcome\r\n\r\nnews  indeed.   In this regard, the move  to  change  the\r\n\r\nlegislative  and  regulatory framework for  companies  in\r\n\r\norder to keep business cost low is a positive step in the\r\n\r\nright   direction.   For  too  many  years,  businessmen,\r\n\r\nespecially  those  running small and medium  enterprises,\r\n\r\nhave been suffering under the weight of rising\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbusiness  cost and becoming uncompetitive in the process.\r\n\r\nIt  is  indeed true that every regulatory hurdle that  is\r\n\r\nput  in  the  way  of  businessman  is  a  cost  to  him.\r\n\r\nStreamlining  our rules and regulations  would  not  only\r\n\r\nsimplify our compliance procedures but would also help to\r\n\r\nbring   down   our   costs   and   hence   increase   our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I applaud, Sir, the present initiative by the\r\n\r\nGovernment in moving to change our company law  framework\r\n\r\nand  regulatory  regime  to make us  more  efficient  and\r\n\r\ncompetitive, I do wonder whether we are doing  enough  by\r\n\r\njust  focusing  on the subject so narrowly.   Can  we  do\r\n\r\nbetter?   Sir, we should remember that the issue  of  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  business, even from a company law  perspective,\r\n\r\ngoes  beyond the subject matter of company law.  A review\r\n\r\nshould  also  cover other similar regulatory  regimes  as\r\n\r\nwell.   For  instance, we should review the SFA  and  the\r\n\r\nlisting rules of the Singapore Exchange with the specific\r\n\r\nview  of reducing our cost, if that is the intent of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, you will recall, Sir, that at the\r\n\r\nlast Committee of Supply sitting, I did mention that  the\r\n\r\nlisting  rules  in Singapore, while they seek  to  create\r\n\r\ngreater  transparency in the market place, have  in  some\r\n\r\nways  contributed to the cost of doing business here.   I\r\n\r\nam   referring  in  particular  to  quarterly   reporting\r\n\r\nrequirements  which listed companies  in  Singapore  must\r\n\r\ncomply  with over time.  I may have mentioned  then  that\r\n\r\nmany listed companies here find quarterly reporting to be\r\n\r\nunduly burdensome and may not be entirely appropriate  in\r\n\r\nsome cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I did a survey amongst my firm's existing\r\n\r\nclients   to  determine  whether  they  agree  with   the\r\n\r\nsentiments  as expressed.  In this regard, Sir,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to express my interest in the matter as a solicitor\r\n\r\nand   may  have  an  interest  in  the  outcome  of  this\r\n\r\nlegislation.  All who replied were unanimous  in  telling\r\n\r\nme  that  they find quarterly reporting to be burdensome.\r\n\r\nIn   some  cases,  there  is  very  little  variation  in\r\n\r\ninformation provided from quarter to quarter.  This\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\napplies   especially   to  property  investment   holding\r\n\r\ncompanies.   I  understand that not all  stock  exchanges\r\n\r\naround  the world require quarterly reporting from  their\r\n\r\ncompanies.  It is significant to note that the main board\r\n\r\nof   the  Hong  Kong  Stock  Exchange  does  not  require\r\n\r\nquarterly reporting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did also mention earlier that imposing quarterly\r\n\r\nreporting  requirement may affect  our  ability  to  sell\r\n\r\nlistings  in Singapore as a value proposition.   In  this\r\n\r\nregard,  I  would  like to ask the Minister  whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  come  to  any  decision  on   quarterly\r\n\r\nreporting requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, quarterly reporting is just one example of how,\r\n\r\nin  our  effort  to  be transparent,  we  may  have  gone\r\n\r\noverboard.   I  will cite another example.   The  present\r\n\r\npractice  in the industry requires companies that  depart\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Code of Corporate Governance to give  detailed\r\n\r\nexplanations   for  its  departure.    In   the   present\r\n\r\nregulatory climate in Singapore, and being afraid of  the\r\n\r\nrap  on the knuckle, companies have gone to great lengths\r\n\r\nto explain every instance of departure from the corporate\r\n\r\ngovernance code.  Such an undertaking is also thought  to\r\n\r\nbe  unduly burdensome.  This, unfortunately, demonstrates\r\n\r\nthe  carrying  out  of the desire to be  transparent  and\r\n\r\naccountable  to  the extreme.  You will appreciate,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  every endeavour to comply with the regulations will\r\n\r\ncome with a price.  In this regard, I would also like  to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister whether the MAS could issue a  further\r\n\r\ndirective  to specify the extent to which explanation  is\r\n\r\nrequired  for  not complying with the Code  of  Corporate\r\n\r\nGovernance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, necessary that if we are to\r\n\r\nundertake  a  review of the Companies Act to help  reduce\r\n\r\nbusiness costs, we should also at the same time undertake\r\n\r\nthe  review of other relevant legislation and regulations\r\n\r\nwith the same view in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank\r\n\r\nMrs  Lim  Hwee  Hua and also Mr Sin Boon  Ann  for  their\r\n\r\ncontributions.   I  have  a lot  of  sympathy  for  their\r\n\r\napproach  and priorities, and let me explain our position\r\n\r\nand what we can do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the definition of substantive shareholding which\r\n\r\nMrs Lim raised, currently, an investor holding 5% or more\r\n\r\nof  the  voting shares of a listed company has to  notify\r\n\r\nthe  company  and the SGX of any changes in  shareholding\r\n\r\nwithin two calendar days.  For example, if it moves  from\r\n\r\n5.3%  to  5.5%, he has to tell the company and SGX  about\r\n\r\nthis  0.2%  change.   The aim is to make  sure  that  the\r\n\r\ncompany   and  SGX  are  aware  of  who  the  substantial\r\n\r\nshareholders  are  and what are the  movements  in  their\r\n\r\nshareholdings.    In  a  takeover  situation,   this   is\r\n\r\nimportant information for everybody.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In computing this shareholding, the investor must\r\n\r\ninclude both his direct interest and his deemed interest.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words,  he  has  to  aggregate  several  items\r\n\r\ntogether - very likely.  Direct interest is what he holds\r\n\r\nhimself.  But, if he is in a corporation, deemed interest\r\n\r\nwill  include  shares held by related  corporations,  eg,\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries   and  associates.   This   requirement   to\r\n\r\naggregate their direct and deemed interests is similar to\r\n\r\nthe  practices  in the US, UK, Australia and  Hong  Kong.\r\n\r\nSo, it is not just the Commonwealth jurisdictions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is a rationale, which is to improve the\r\n\r\nlevel of transparency by allowing the company and SGX  to\r\n\r\nknow  who  exercises effective control over the company's\r\n\r\nshares.   Otherwise, you will have a front, a dummy,  and\r\n\r\nthen  you  operate a wayang kulit from behind,  and  that\r\n\r\ncauses problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we need proper disclosure, we also recognise\r\n\r\nit  is important to reduce the reporting burden for  fund\r\n\r\nmanagers  and  investors.  That is why  we  accepted  the\r\n\r\nrecommendation to make the changes which are in the  Bill\r\n\r\ntoday:  first,  to require notification  only  when  your\r\n\r\nshareholding changes by one percentage point, a  discrete\r\n\r\n1% threshold above the minimum\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n5%.  So, if you go from 5.3% to 5.5%, you do not have  to\r\n\r\nreport.   But if you cross the next threshold,  which  is\r\n\r\n6%, then you will have to report, which is like what Hong\r\n\r\nKong  and  the UK are doing.  And instead of two calendar\r\n\r\ndays,  you  will have two business days.   So,  over  the\r\n\r\nweekend, you do not count those days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are minor improvements. But, as Mrs Lim\r\n\r\npointed  out,  there will still be reporting requirements\r\n\r\nthat  may  still  be  onerous.  So,  we  will  study  her\r\n\r\nsuggestion to see whether it is feasible for us to exempt\r\n\r\ncertain  categories of investors and fund  managers  from\r\n\r\nthe   requirement  to  report  their  direct  and  deemed\r\n\r\ninterests.   We will have to study it, because  it  is  a\r\n\r\ngrey area.  There are reasons why we want to know who the\r\n\r\nsubstantial  shareholders are.  For sensitive  companies,\r\n\r\nthere  may  be  a  double reason.   But  even  for  other\r\n\r\ncompanies, we must have an effective definition  and  one\r\n\r\nthat   is   not   too   difficult  and  whose   reporting\r\n\r\nrequirements are not too burdensome.  But we  will  study\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann raised two questions:</b> one, on\r\n\r\nquarterly reporting, whether we have made any decision on\r\n\r\namending  this.  He had raised this in the  Committee  of\r\n\r\nSupply and I had promised to look into the matter,  which\r\n\r\nI have done, and he has kindly given me the response from\r\n\r\nhis survey of his own clients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quarterly reporting will enhance Singapore's\r\n\r\ntransparency  and standing as a world-class business  and\r\n\r\nfinancial  centre.   As  we move  to  a  disclosure-based\r\n\r\nregime,  it  becomes more important for investors  to  be\r\n\r\ninformed  more  frequently of the progress  of  publicly-listed  companies.   Developed  economies  like  the  EU,\r\n\r\nCanada,  US  and  Japan, and also some  developing  Asian\r\n\r\neconomies like China, India, Malaysia and Thailand,  have\r\n\r\nall  implemented  quarterly reporting  for  their  listed\r\n\r\ncompanies.   We introduced mandatory quarterly  reporting\r\n\r\nfor  listed  companies  from 1st  January  this  year  to\r\n\r\nfurther  improve Singapore's transparency and  disclosure\r\n\r\nstandards.  But quarterly reporting does impose  cost  on\r\n\r\ncompanies, particularly the smaller ones.  And it is  not\r\n\r\njust the financial aspects, but also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  significant amount of management attention is required\r\n\r\nto  prepare  the  quarterly statements to  the  necessary\r\n\r\nstandards   for  public  release.   And  these   can   be\r\n\r\nburdensome,  especially  when  business  conditions   are\r\n\r\ndifficult and profits are down.  Considering the  current\r\n\r\nconditions,  it makes sense to defer quarterly  reporting\r\n\r\nfor  some  smaller  companies to help them  reduce  their\r\n\r\nbusiness cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, listed companies with a market\r\n\r\ncapitalisation  above  $20 million  are  required  to  do\r\n\r\nquarterly  reporting for financial years  starting  after\r\n\r\n1st   January  2003.   Companies  that  fall  below  this\r\n\r\nthreshold have been given a 1-year deferment.  They  will\r\n\r\nstart  quarterly reporting for financial  years  starting\r\n\r\n1st January 2004.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have decided to make the following changes to the\r\n\r\nquarterly    reporting    requirement.     The     market\r\n\r\ncapitalisation threshold will be raised from $20  million\r\n\r\nto  $75  million,  based on the 31st  March  2003  market\r\n\r\ncapitalisation  data published by SGX.  This  will  defer\r\n\r\nquarterly   reporting  for  about  half   the   mainboard\r\n\r\ncompanies and nearly all the Sesdaq companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, quarterly reporting will also be deferred\r\n\r\nfor   a   newly-listed  company,  if   its   IPO   market\r\n\r\ncapitalisation is $75 million or below.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we will review the quarterly reporting\r\n\r\nrequirement for these smaller companies in mid-2005.   We\r\n\r\nwill  review it and we will decide at that point what  to\r\n\r\ndo.   Thus, quarterly reporting for these companies  will\r\n\r\nbe  deferred  by  at least three years, compared  to  the\r\n\r\nlarger companies.  SGX will be implementing these changes\r\n\r\nwith immediate effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Code of Corporate Governance, Mr Sin asked\r\n\r\nwhether  the requirement for listed companies to  provide\r\n\r\nan  extensive explanation in their annual reports for any\r\n\r\ndeviation from the Code is unduly burdensome.   The  Code\r\n\r\ncontains 15 principles and 55 guidelines.  The guidelines\r\n\r\nserve to illustrate and elaborate on the principles.  The\r\n\r\ncompanies  are encouraged to comply with the  guidelines,\r\n\r\nas they are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngood  corporate  governance  practices.   But  these  are\r\n\r\nguidelines, not requirements.  Nor do we intend companies\r\n\r\nto  publish pages of detailed legalistic explanations  of\r\n\r\ntheir  corporate  governance practices,  as  some  listed\r\n\r\ncompanies  have done in their annual reports  this  year.\r\n\r\nSo,  to  explain why you did not comply, you  would  have\r\n\r\nanother long turgid small-print document.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in their annual reports, companies should\r\n\r\nfocus on how they have applied the principles of the Code\r\n\r\nwhich  embody its spirit, rather than the many individual\r\n\r\nguidelines.   They should, however, disclose and  explain\r\n\r\nany  deviation from the guidelines, which is  similar  to\r\n\r\nthe  disclosure obligations in jurisdictions like the  UK\r\n\r\nand  Australia.  But it is up to the companies to  decide\r\n\r\nhow  detailed their corporate governance statements  need\r\n\r\nto  be.   The  market  will judge  the  quality  of  each\r\n\r\ncompany's disclosures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this approach, SGX will not routinely review\r\n\r\nand   query   the   contents  of   corporate   governance\r\n\r\ndisclosures  in their companies' annual reports,  but  it\r\n\r\nmay act, if it receives a complaint, a tip-off, or if  it\r\n\r\nhas cause to suspect that a company has not complied with\r\n\r\nthe  listing  rules or if there is a false or  misleading\r\n\r\ndisclosure.  This approach is consistent with the move to\r\n\r\na disclosure-based regime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if companies understand that this is a guide,\r\n\r\nand  they put into their annual report a statement  which\r\n\r\nthey  judge appropriate as to how they have complied with\r\n\r\nit  and  where they have not complied with  it,  that  is\r\n\r\nsufficient.   We will not, for example, go and  ask  them\r\n\r\nwhy  the  explanation for item No. 53 out of 55 items  is\r\n\r\nnot  long  and  detailed enough.  I hope  that  makes  it\r\n\r\nclear.   I think the SGX also would be very relieved  not\r\n\r\nto   have   to   burden   itself  with   these   detailed\r\n\r\nsupervisions, and these moves should make it easier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should say that, in order for the regulators to be\r\n\r\nable to supervise the system\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsensitively,  we need to have good feedback  from  people\r\n\r\nand  from  companies for us to know what is  working  and\r\n\r\nwhat  is not, what is tiresome without serving a purpose,\r\n\r\nand  what  is just form without substance.   It  is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult for the regulator on his own to get this  feel.\r\n\r\nWe   will   try  our  best,  but  we  are  not  ourselves\r\n\r\npractising.   We  are  regulating  or  supervising.   So,\r\n\r\nunless   the  participants  are  willing  to   speak   up\r\n\r\neffectively and forcefully and press their point, and  if\r\n\r\nthey  are  not heard the first time, to try  again,  then\r\n\r\nsometimes we may not get their message and we may end  up\r\n\r\nwith an outcome which does not really work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these two cases, the matters have been discussed.\r\n\r\nThere  has been feedback, the matters were debated,  some\r\n\r\nadjustments  were made but, actually, further adjustments\r\n\r\nwere   necessary  because  I  think  the  situation   was\r\n\r\nchanging, and the business conditions change.  When  this\r\n\r\nhappens, it is incumbent on the participants, the  people\r\n\r\nwho  are affected, to speak up and let us know.  And,  as\r\n\r\nwe  have said many times in Parliament and elsewhere, you\r\n\r\nhave  to  have the confidence to speak up and  not  worry\r\n\r\nthat  if  you speak up you may be blackmarked or  knocked\r\n\r\ndown or some other thing may befall you.  Because if  you\r\n\r\ndo  not speak up, then we would not know and it would not\r\n\r\nbe fixed.  So, we have to have that mutual confidence and\r\n\r\nrapport  and,  if  one  avenue  does  not  work,  to  try\r\n\r\ndifferent avenues.  Finally, we may or may not agree, but\r\n\r\nI  think  it  is important that the issues  have  a  full\r\n\r\nairing  and the decision is a considered one, taking  all\r\n\r\nviews and all facts into account.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for hearing  out\r\n\r\nthe people in industry and making the necessary changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the other point about explanations\r\n\r\nfor  departures from the corporate governance code, would\r\n\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister not agree with me that part  of\r\n\r\nthe  reason why people have gone to the other extreme  of\r\n\r\ngiving detailed explanation is because they fear\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  heavy hand of the regulator?

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill collates a number of minor amendments\r\n\r\nto several Acts. They are mostly technical amendments but\r\n\r\nlet me highlight the key ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to the Arbitration Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, clause 3 amends the Arbitration Act to\r\n\r\nempower  the  High  Court  of  Singapore  to  enforce  an\r\n\r\narbitral  award  irrespective of  whether  the  place  of\r\n\r\narbitration  is  Singapore or elsewhere.  This  amendment\r\n\r\nwas recommended by the Legal Services Working Group under\r\n\r\nthe  Economic Review Sub-Committee on Service  Industries\r\n\r\nand is modelled after the UK and Hong Kong legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as part of our drive to make Singapore an\r\n\r\ninternational arbitration hub, we want to attract  people\r\n\r\nto  conduct their arbitrations in Singapore. For this  to\r\n\r\nhappen,  it is important that arbitration awards made  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are enforceable in whatever country assets  in\r\n\r\nquestion  are found.  This is not a problem for countries\r\n\r\nthat  are  parties to the New York Convention, where  any\r\n\r\nsignatory  country's awards can be enforced in any  other\r\n\r\nsignatory  country. Singapore is a signatory country,  as\r\n\r\nare most other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem arises when awards from Singapore are to\r\n\r\nbe  enforced  in a non-New York Convention  country.   In\r\n\r\nsuch  cases,  there  is  no automatic  recognition  of  a\r\n\r\nSingapore award by that country.  However, many of  these\r\n\r\ncountries  have  laws that allow recognition  of  foreign\r\n\r\narbitral   awards  on  a  reciprocal  basis.   Thus,   if\r\n\r\nSingapore   is  able  to  recognise  awards  from   these\r\n\r\ncountries,  they  will  likewise  recognise  awards  from\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, this amendment to make it possible for\r\n\r\nforeign  awards  that  cannot currently  be  enforced  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  be enforced here.  There will  not  be  an\r\n\r\nautomatic right to enforcement, as the leave of our  High\r\n\r\nCourt  will be required.  Of course, this does  not  mean\r\n\r\nthat  the Court will automatically grant leave to enforce\r\n\r\nforeign  awards in all cases.  The award  must  first  be\r\n\r\nsubject  to  the  requirements in section 46(1),  namely,\r\n\r\nthat  there must be an agreement by the parties to submit\r\n\r\nthe  dispute  to  arbitration and the  award  must  be  a\r\n\r\ndecision  on  the  substance of the dispute  made  by  an\r\n\r\narbitral   tribunal.   For  example,  the   Courts   have\r\n\r\ndeveloped  rules for the enforcement of foreign judgments\r\n\r\nand  arbitration awards, and similar principles would  be\r\n\r\nconsidered by a Court in deciding whether to grant leave.\r\n\r\nThus, leave to enforce an award may not be granted if the\r\n\r\nperson  against  whom it is sought to be  enforced  shows\r\n\r\nthat    the    arbitral   tribunal   lacked   substantive\r\n\r\njurisdiction  to make the award, or that the  enforcement\r\n\r\nof  the award would be contrary to public policy.   Also,\r\n\r\nif  the  composition of the arbitral tribunal is  not  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the agreement of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nparties or the applicable arbitration law, the Court  may\r\n\r\ndecline to enforce the award.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to the Business Registration Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Business Registration Act. Section 22 of\r\n\r\nthe Act currently makes it an offence for an undischarged\r\n\r\nbankrupt  to  take  part  in  or  be  concerned  in   the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  any business required  to  be  registered\r\n\r\nunder that Act without the leave of the High Court or the\r\n\r\nwritten permission of the Official Assignee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends the Act by extending the existing\r\n\r\nlaw  to  cover  persons who are adjudicated  bankrupt  in\r\n\r\nanother  jurisdiction.  Such a person will also  have  to\r\n\r\nseek  the leave of the High Court or permission from  the\r\n\r\nOfficial  Assignee  before  he  can  take  part  in   the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  any business required  to  be  registered\r\n\r\nunder the Business Registration Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment was proposed following a case\r\n\r\nwhere  the  Attorney-General's  Chambers  was  unable  to\r\n\r\nprosecute  a  person  as he was adjudicated  bankrupt  in\r\n\r\nanother  jurisdiction.   This amendment  will  bring  the\r\n\r\nBusiness Registration Act in line with section 148 of the\r\n\r\nCompanies Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to the Prisons Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, clause 12 amends the Prisons Act to address an\r\n\r\nexisting  uncertainty.   Prisons  Department  has  always\r\n\r\ngiven  one-third  remission for sentences  for  prisoners\r\n\r\nserving  imprisonment  in default  of  payment  of  fine,\r\n\r\nalthough it is not clear from section 224 of the Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure  Code  that  such  prisoners  are  entitled  to\r\n\r\nremission.   This amendment will make it clear  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Home Affairs can make regulations  relating\r\n\r\nto  the granting of remission in respect of sentences  of\r\n\r\nimprisonment  and imprisonment in default of  payment  of\r\n\r\nfine.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendments to enhance District Court's sentencing power</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, clause 16, read with the Schedule, amends the\r\n\r\nActs  listed  in  the  first column of  the  Schedule  to\r\n\r\nempower  the  District Courts to impose the full  penalty\r\n\r\nprescribed under these Acts. Such empowering is not  new.\r\n\r\nIt is already found in many other Acts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, there have been cases where the\r\n\r\nDistrict  Courts have found that the merits of  the  case\r\n\r\nwarranted the maximum punishment provided under the Acts.\r\n\r\nHowever,  they  were  unable to mete out  the  punishment\r\n\r\nbeyond  that  provided under the Criminal Procedure  Code\r\n\r\n(or  CPC).   In  particular, under the CPC, the  District\r\n\r\nCourt  can only impose a fine of up to $10,000 while  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  fines provided in many of the Acts range between\r\n\r\n$20,000 and $250,000.  This amendment will therefore give\r\n\r\nthe   District  Courts  the  flexibility  to  impose  the\r\n\r\nappropriate punishment up to the maximum allowable  under\r\n\r\nthe Acts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to the Land Acquisition Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, clause 8 amends the Land Acquisition Act to\r\n\r\nallow the Collector of Land Revenue to waive, in suitable\r\n\r\ncases,  the  need for appellants to deposit security  for\r\n\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such deposits are required whenever appeals are\r\n\r\nmade  to the Appeals Board against a compensation  award.\r\n\r\nThe  deposits  will be used to satisfy the costs  in  the\r\n\r\nevent  that  the  Board  makes an  order  awarding  costs\r\n\r\nagainst  the  appellant.  Currently, the Act  requires  a\r\n\r\ndeposit  equivalent to one-third the amount of the  award\r\n\r\nor  $5,000, whichever is lower.  However, there have been\r\n\r\ncases  in  the past where the deposits are of such  small\r\n\r\namounts that it does not make sense to collect them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment will allow the Collector to waive\r\n\r\nsuch  deposits in cases where the amount is insignificant\r\n\r\nand  relieve  the  Appeals Board from the  administrative\r\n\r\ntask  of  maintaining  the  accounts  for  such  deposits\r\n\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to the Payment and Settlement Systems (Finality\r\n\r\nand Netting) Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, clause 11 amends the Payment and Settlement\r\n\r\nSystems  (Finality  and  Netting)  Act  to  empower   the\r\n\r\nMonetary  Authority  of Singapore  to  compound  offences\r\n\r\nunder  that  Act  that  are  prescribed  as  compoundable\r\n\r\noffences.   This  is to move away from prosecuting  every\r\n\r\nbreach  of  the provisions by offering the  offenders  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to compound the breaches.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 also amends the same Act to confer\r\n\r\njurisdiction on District Courts to try any offence  under\r\n\r\nthat Act and to impose the full penalty or punishment  in\r\n\r\nrespect of the offences.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Miscellaneous amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to wrap up, let me take the\r\n\r\nHouse briefly through the remaining key provisions of the\r\n\r\nBill  which  are  in  the nature of  facilitating  better\r\n\r\nadministration of the Acts in question.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to the Interpretation Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, clause 2 amends the definition of\r\n\r\n\"prescribed\" in the Interpretation Act to facilitate  the\r\n\r\nuse   of   electronic   forms   in   appropriate   cases.\r\n\r\nRegulations often prescribe forms to be used for  various\r\n\r\nprocesses or applications.  The amendment will allow such\r\n\r\nforms  to be made available on websites, rather  than  be\r\n\r\nprinted  in the Regulations themselves.  This is in  line\r\n\r\nwith the move towards more electronic communications  and\r\n\r\ntransactions, as well as increasing e-Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to the Companies Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 amends the Companies Act to require the\r\n\r\nliquidator  of a company that has been wound up  to  keep\r\n\r\nthe relevant books and papers of the company for a period\r\n\r\nof 2 years instead of 5 years as is presently the case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will relieve the burden on liquidators to\r\n\r\nmaintain the books of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompany after dissolution, and will avoid further storage\r\n\r\ncosts  upon  dissolution.  So  far,  there  has  been  no\r\n\r\nrequest  to  inspect  the books of a  company  after  the\r\n\r\nwinding up order has been made.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendments  to  the  Mutual  Benefit  Organisations  Act,\r\n\r\nSocieties Act and Trade Unions Act</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 10, 14 and 15 amend the Mutual Benefit\r\n\r\nOrganisations Act, the Societies Act and the Trade Unions\r\n\r\nAct  respectively  to substitute all  references  to  the\r\n\r\nOfficial Assignee with the Official Receiver.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Official Receiver deals with the winding up\r\n\r\nof  companies, he would be the more appropriate authority\r\n\r\nto   deal   with   the  winding  up  of  mutual   benefit\r\n\r\norganisations, societies and trade unions rather than the\r\n\r\nOfficial   Assignee   who  deals   with   bankruptcy   of\r\n\r\nindividuals.   The  amendment  will  allow  the  Official\r\n\r\nReceiver  to apply the same powers that he has under  the\r\n\r\nCompanies Act in the winding up of a company.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to the Public Trustee Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 amends the Public Trustee Act to allow the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  assign to the Public Trustee functions  and\r\n\r\nduties  relating to victims of motor accidents and  their\r\n\r\nclaims  to  compensation.  This will  enable  the  Public\r\n\r\nTrustee  to  handle  duties  such  as  administering  the\r\n\r\nagreement  between the Government and the Motor Insurance\r\n\r\nBureau  relating  to the compensation of  motor  accident\r\n\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to the Bankruptcy Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends the Bankruptcy Act to clarify that a\r\n\r\nprivate  trustee  does  not have the  power  to  issue  a\r\n\r\ncertificate of annulment where a composition is  accepted\r\n\r\nby  the creditors or where a proved debt and the expenses\r\n\r\nof  the  bankruptcy  have been fully paid.   Such  powers\r\n\r\nshould  only  be exercised by the Official  Assignee.   A\r\n\r\nprivate  trustee  who feels that an annulment  should  be\r\n\r\nmade could refer the matter to the Official Assignee  for\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to the Civil Service College Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 is a minor technical amendment to the Civil\r\n\r\nService  College  Act to effect a change  in  terminology\r\n\r\nfrom  the existing \"Board of Governors\" to the \"Board  of\r\n\r\nDirectors\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to the Moneylenders Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, clause 9 amends the Moneylenders Act\r\n\r\nby  deleting  the information that is currently  required\r\n\r\nfor  the  proof  of  a  debt due to  a  moneylender,  and\r\n\r\nproviding  instead for such information to be  prescribed\r\n\r\nby  rules made under the Bankruptcy Act.

It was\r\n\r\ndrafted  in  consultation  with the  relevant  Government\r\n\r\nagencies and statutory boards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me highlight the main changes to the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will allow the electronic lodgement of\r\n\r\ndocuments  affecting  land to update  the  land  register\r\n\r\nthrough electronic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmeans;  namely,  the  Internet (clause  4).  The  current\r\n\r\nframework  of  the  Act only allows manual  lodgement  of\r\n\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are clear benefits in switching to ELS.\r\n\r\nLet  me cite some examples.  Lawyers using ELS will  save\r\n\r\non  manpower and transportation costs, as there  will  be\r\n\r\nfewer  trips  to SLA for lodgement.  There will  also  be\r\n\r\nlower  incidence  of  documentation  data  errors,  which\r\n\r\nattracts additional fees.  The new system has an in-built\r\n\r\nautomated checking mechanism that will assist lawyers  in\r\n\r\ntheir preparation of documents by minimising data errors.\r\n\r\nAlso,  lawyers will be able to offer better  services  to\r\n\r\ntheir clients through more effective case management, for\r\n\r\nexample,  by checking their accounts with SLA  concerning\r\n\r\nlodgement fees and the status of their lodged documents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, finally, Sir, they will also be able to use\r\n\r\nvalue-added  services such as being alerted  to  expiring\r\n\r\ncaveats  which  will help to ensure that  their  clients'\r\n\r\ninterests are not left unprotected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land registry's perspective, ELS will do\r\n\r\naway with the need to re-key data at the SLA's end as the\r\n\r\ndata  is  transmitted from the lodging party.  This  will\r\n\r\neffectively   ensure   almost  100%   accuracy   of   the\r\n\r\ninformation  captured.  This will  better  safeguard  the\r\n\r\nintegrity  of  the  land  register  and  enhance   public\r\n\r\nconfidence in land dealings in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the types of documents that can be lodged\r\n\r\nelectronically,  for  a  start,  when   the   system   is\r\n\r\nimplemented, only caveats, writs of execution and  orders\r\n\r\nof   court  can  be  lodged  electronically.   These  are\r\n\r\ndocuments  that do not pass title to the  land  from  the\r\n\r\nregistered  owner  to  another person.   Other  types  of\r\n\r\ndocuments  will still need to be submitted physically  to\r\n\r\nSLA even after the electronic format of the documents has\r\n\r\nbeen transmitted to SLA via ELS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason why we are limiting the application\r\n\r\nof  ELS  to  these  documents is because  the  Electronic\r\n\r\nTransactions  Act does not apply to documents  that  pass\r\n\r\ntitle in immovable property.  As land is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprobably  the  most valuable asset to most  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nthere  are concerns in extending the application  of  the\r\n\r\nElectronic Transactions Act to land documents  that  pass\r\n\r\ntitle  or  interest from the landowner to other  parties.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  these land documents  will  still  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom ELS because the priority of their lodgement will  be\r\n\r\nsecured  at  the  point  in time  when  their  electronic\r\n\r\nformats are transmitted to SLA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, also, the Bill will enable the Registrar to\r\n\r\ndispense with proof of execution of documents.   At  law,\r\n\r\nexecution  of  land  documents has  to  be  witnessed  by\r\n\r\nsomeone other than a party to the document.  This  is  to\r\n\r\nprevent  any  doubts  being  raised  subsequently  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether  the  document  was  properly  executed  by   the\r\n\r\nparties.  Given the nature of the documents covered under\r\n\r\nELS, which do not pass title, we have decided to dispense\r\n\r\nwith   attestation.   This  amendment   will   not   only\r\n\r\nfacilitate easy usage of ELS, but also obviate  increased\r\n\r\nbusiness costs of arranging for witnesses to sign  either\r\n\r\nelectronically or by way of digital cards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill will also deal with the execution of\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Currently, the Bill provides for companies to\r\n\r\nexecute  by  way  of  affixing the  common  seal  in  the\r\n\r\npresence  of  two  of its officers.   In  the  electronic\r\n\r\nenvironment,  this  will not be possible.   Instead,  the\r\n\r\nBill  will  allow the Registrar to prescribe  such  other\r\n\r\nacceptable  manner  of execution.   One  such  manner  of\r\n\r\nexecution  would  be  for them to execute  the  documents\r\n\r\nthrough their authorised officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, this Bill will help Singapore to\r\n\r\nachieve  its vision of implementing eGovernment services,\r\n\r\nwherever  possible,  to  ensure  easy  accessibility   of\r\n\r\nGovernment services via the Internet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I wish to seek a\r\n\r\nclarification  on clauses 13 and 14 which  are  to  amend\r\n\r\nsections  161 and 164 of the Act.  The original  sections\r\n\r\n161(1) and 164(1) of the Act allow the public access\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  the  Land Register and to obtain a certified copy  of\r\n\r\nany document lodged with it upon payment of a fee.  These\r\n\r\nsections  will be amended to allow the public  to  search\r\n\r\nand  obtain  a copy of such electronic documents  as  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  shall  determine.  This  means  that  not  all\r\n\r\nelectronically  lodged documents can be accessed  by  the\r\n\r\npublic.   My  question is: which are the  documents  that\r\n\r\nwill  no  longer be available for public inspection,  and\r\n\r\nwhy  is  there a need to limit public access  to  certain\r\n\r\ndocuments  which  will result in less  information  being\r\n\r\navailable to the public?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, as I understand it,\r\n\r\nit  is  not the purpose of this amendment to limit public\r\n\r\naccess to the documents but rather to save public time in\r\n\r\nchecking.   Also,  possibly, because  of  the  electronic\r\n\r\nenvironment,   the  clause  gives  flexibility   to   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar to protect the integrity of the database.  Just\r\n\r\nin  case there is a need to limit, there is the power  to\r\n\r\ndo so, but the intention is not to limit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Further clarification. If the\r\n\r\nintention is not to limit, but the amendment states  that\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar will now determine what kind of  documents\r\n\r\nwill be available, is it not clear enough to say that  it\r\n\r\nis  to limit?  The Bill says that it is to limit.   So  I\r\n\r\nwonder  why  impose such a limit and give  the  Registrar\r\n\r\nsuch  a  power to determine what document to release  and\r\n\r\nnot  to release.  So where is the right of the public for\r\n\r\ninformation in the database?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> As I said, Sir, we are\r\n\r\ndoing  this in phases.  The important thing is to protect\r\n\r\nthe  databases.   So,  in terms of even  how  the  public\r\n\r\naccesses  the documents, it is better to give the  powers\r\n\r\nto  the  Registrar  to implement any steps  that  may  be\r\n\r\nneeded, for example, to ensure the identity of the public\r\n\r\naccessing the documents.  I think it is good to give  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  these  powers,  which  can  be  exercised,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary.   But  the intention is not  to  limit  public\r\n\r\naccess,  but  for him to ensure that whoever accesses  it\r\n\r\nwill  not,  for  example, corrupt or abuse the  database.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  technical point.  If Mr  Low  wants  further\r\n\r\nclarification, this can be sent to him.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the Senior Minister\r\n\r\nof State agree - and this puzzles me - that these are two\r\n\r\ndifferent  issues?   How  do  you  prevent  people   from\r\n\r\naccessing  the database to try to do something  funny  to\r\n\r\nit,  damage  the  database, and  to  restrict  access  to\r\n\r\ncertain documents?  I do not understand why they have  to\r\n\r\nbe together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, like I said, what is\r\n\r\nimportant  is to clarify the policy intent.   The  policy\r\n\r\nintent  is  not  to  restrict whatever  level  of  public\r\n\r\naccessibility  that is currently enjoyed.   That  is  the\r\n\r\nmain  point.  I think that is the point Mr Low is  trying\r\n\r\nto make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill - [Assoc.
