As   for\r\n\r\nshopkeepers who own their HDB shops, they can exit  from  the\r\n\r\nretail  trade  by  selling their shops in  the  open  market.\r\n\r\nEvery  year, about 5% of HDB shopkeepers exit from the retail\r\n\r\ntrade  through  one of these means.  Between 1998  and  2000,\r\n\r\nthere were about 800 terminations, 1,200 assignments and  500\r\n\r\nresale cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB also allows shopkeepers to change the use of their\r\n\r\nshops,  except  in cases where the conversion  is  likely  to\r\n\r\ncause  disamenities to HDB residents.  Between 1998 and 2000,\r\n\r\nHDB  gave approval for 600 shop tenants and lessees to change\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  their shops.

In this particular case, HDB  feels\r\n\r\nthat  change  of  use  to an eating house  will  create  more\r\n\r\ndisturbance,  more  disamenity, more noise  nuisance  to  the\r\n\r\nresidents.

Over  the\r\n\r\nyears,  a disparity in rent has arisen because some HDB  shop\r\n\r\ntenants  are old resettlement cases, paying highly subsidised\r\n\r\nrates  while  other tenants have obtained their  premises  by\r\n\r\ntender, paying market rents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To moderate the impact on tenants who have been paying\r\n\r\nsubsidised   rents,  HDB  staggered  the  rental  adjustments\r\n\r\ntowards  prevailing  market rate over four  renewals,  at  3-yearly  intervals,  in other words, over  a  12-year  period,\r\n\r\nstarting from 1988.  The implementation was also carried  out\r\n\r\nin  phases.  Tenants who are renewing their tenancies for the\r\n\r\n4th time this year were converted to the 3-year fixed tenancy\r\n\r\nin 1989.  They had their tenancies renewed for the first time\r\n\r\nin  1992  and the second time in 1995.  At each renewal,  the\r\n\r\nrental increases were capped at 30% of existing rents.   When\r\n\r\nthe  tenancies were renewed for the third time in  1998,  the\r\n\r\nrents   were  raised  to  75%  of  market  rate.   The  final\r\n\r\nadjustments to market rents are taking place now, at the  4th\r\n\r\nrenewal  of their tenancies.  Some rents have been increased,\r\n\r\nwhile others have been maintained or reduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By moving all tenants gradually towards the appropriate\r\n\r\nmarket rates, HDB ensures that all shopkeepers compete  on  a\r\n\r\nlevel-playing  field.  This is only fair to all  shopkeepers.\r\n\r\nHowever,   recognising   the   present   difficult   economic\r\n\r\nconditions, HDB will be enhancing the rental rebates for  all\r\n\r\nits  commercial and industrial tenants across-the-board.  The\r\n\r\nrebates  will  provide some relief to all HDB  shop  tenants,\r\n\r\nincluding  those  whose  rents  are  being  adjusted  upwards\r\n\r\ntowards market rate.  The details of HDB's rebates will be in\r\n\r\nthe  package of measures to be announced by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nTrade and Industry in his Ministerial Statement shortly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like to declare that I am a lessee of an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to pose three questions to the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister whether the recent efforts to\r\n\r\nassist  HDB  shop  retailers in their predicaments  would  be\r\n\r\ndefeated  by  the adjustments of HDB rentals  to  the  market\r\n\r\nrates?   May  I ask whether the market rates that  are  being\r\n\r\nused as benchmarks for the present rental adjustments reflect\r\n\r\nthe  prevailing economic climate?  And also may I ask whether\r\n\r\nthe  present method of assessing the market rates,  based  on\r\n\r\nrecent HDB lettings, is a fair practice?  Because it has been\r\n\r\nknown  that  many novice and enthusiastic new lessees  always\r\n\r\ntender higher prices and be successful at such prices that do\r\n\r\nnot conform to the prevailing rentals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, let me take the last question\r\n\r\nfirst which pertains to the method of assessing market rates.\r\n\r\nWhat  are  the so-called market rates, are they  fair  market\r\n\r\nrates   -   I  think  that  is the  thrust  of  the  Member's\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nWhat  HDB  does is that it appoints a panel of  valuers,  and\r\n\r\nthese  are private sector valuers, these are not HDB valuers,\r\n\r\nto  assess the market rates based on, first, the rentals that\r\n\r\nhave  been tendered in the area, but also taking into account\r\n\r\nthe  specific location of the shop, the micro location of the\r\n\r\nshop,  the orientation of the shop, the traffic of the  shop,\r\n\r\nthe  size  of  the shop, and so on.  So in this respect,  the\r\n\r\nfair  market  rate that HDB uses to adjust the rentals  is  a\r\n\r\nresult of professional judgement on the part of this panel of\r\n\r\nvaluers.  I think the Member would realise that valuation  is\r\n\r\nnot  an  exact  science, there is a judgement involved.   But\r\n\r\nthat judgement is exercised by professionals and is exercised\r\n\r\nindependent of HDB.  HDB will then take that value and use it\r\n\r\nas a market benchmark rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens if a tenant is not satisfied with that\r\n\r\nrate?   He  has recourse to several avenues of  appeal.   The\r\n\r\nfirst  avenue  of  appeal is HDB itself.  He  can  defer  the\r\n\r\nsigning  of the tenancy agreement pending an appeal  to  HDB.\r\n\r\nHDB will then assess the merits of that appeal and decide\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccordingly.  If HDB's decision on that appeal is  still  not\r\n\r\nsatisfactory, the tenant has recourse to another avenue which\r\n\r\nis  the  Chief Valuer himself.  The Chief Valuer is of course\r\n\r\nthe Government's valuer and his judgement can be taken as  an\r\n\r\nindependent   judgement,  independent  from  the   panel   of\r\n\r\nprofessional valuers that was appointed by HDB.  So these are\r\n\r\nthe  various  avenues  of  appeal  if  the  tenants  are  not\r\n\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the first question which the Member asked,\r\n\r\nwhich  is whether these adjustments contradict or run counter\r\n\r\nto  the  package of measures.  First of all, let me reiterate\r\n\r\nagain  the purpose of this adjustment.  We need to, first  of\r\n\r\nall, get the cost structure correct for HDB shops.  What do I\r\n\r\nmean  by  this?  If, for example, you have two shops side  by\r\n\r\nside,  one  paying  much lower rental than  the  other,  then\r\n\r\nobviously it is going to be very difficult for competition to\r\n\r\nbe  fair because the cost for one shop is much lower than the\r\n\r\nother.  And this was the situation when we had in many places\r\n\r\na lot of resettlement cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member will recall, resettlement cases were given\r\n\r\nvery, very highly subsidised rentals in the early days.   And\r\n\r\nwe  now  have a situation where we have got people coming  in\r\n\r\nand  tendering  in  the open market.  And  we  have  a  third\r\n\r\nsituation where there are shops which are now being sold  and\r\n\r\nthe  new  landlords of these shops are now letting out  their\r\n\r\nshop  premises.   We  have got all these different  types  of\r\n\r\nshops  and the shop tenants in each of these shops are paying\r\n\r\ndifferent rentals.  Obviously, this is not going to make  for\r\n\r\na  very  fair  competitive environment in  the  neighbourhood\r\n\r\nestate.   And this is reason why, in 1988, 12 years ago,  HDB\r\n\r\ndecided that it was time to gradually remove this anomaly and\r\n\r\ndisparity  in rent, so that everybody can start  off  on  the\r\n\r\nsame  basis, and that is the only way for the shopkeepers  to\r\n\r\ncompete on an equal basis and to decide whether they are able\r\n\r\nto  do  that kind of business in that area or not.  And  that\r\n\r\nexercise has been going on, as I indicated earlier,  for  the\r\n\r\nlast 12 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of those shops had their rentals adjusted. All of\r\n\r\nthem had their rentals\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadjusted  upwards  in  the course of the  last  12  years  at\r\n\r\nvarying  rates of increase.  The last increase was  in  1998.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  during  the  last crisis, at  the  third  renewal,\r\n\r\nrentals  were increased, but up to 75%.  At that  time,  when\r\n\r\nthey  were renewed for the third time, tenants knew that,  at\r\n\r\nthe  next renewal, rentals would go up to market.  Of course,\r\n\r\nsince  1998, the prevailing market rents have also come down.\r\n\r\nSo  when  we  are talking about adjusting to market,  we  are\r\n\r\nactually  not  adjusting the last 25%, but  we  are  actually\r\n\r\nadjusting less than that in most cases.  There are some cases\r\n\r\nwhere  the adjustments are slightly higher, but most  of  the\r\n\r\ntime,  the  adjustments  should be slightly  less.   And  the\r\n\r\npurpose of all this is really to make sure the cost structure\r\n\r\nis correct, that the operating environment is fair to all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having done that, we look at the situation at the moment\r\n\r\nand  we  have  decided, after a review, that we  will  do  an\r\n\r\nadjustment   across-the-board.   And   this   would   benefit\r\n\r\neverybody,  not just those whose rentals have  been  adjusted\r\n\r\nupwards, but also those rentals which have been maintained or\r\n\r\nwhich  have been brought down to market.  So everybody  still\r\n\r\ncontinues to operate on a level playing field.  And  I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is the best way to ensure that the shopkeepers are able\r\n\r\nto  compete and compete fairly, and they are able to  make  a\r\n\r\nconsidered decision whether the costs that they are incurring\r\n\r\nallow them to do the kind of business they want to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The package of measures that we have announced recently\r\n\r\ncomplements  this in the sense that for those who  find  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  not able to continue to do business at these  fair\r\n\r\nmarket rentals, there are various options open to them:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) They can sublet their shop. They are allowed to\r\n\r\nsublet their shop, either half or, if they wish to, they  can\r\n\r\nassign the whole shop to somebody else.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) They can change their trade. If they feel that this\r\n\r\nparticular  business is not doing well, they  can  decide  to\r\n\r\nchange the trade to something else, or they can assign it  to\r\n\r\nsomebody else to change their trade.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) They can also decide that they may want to exit the\r\n\r\nbusiness   completely,  take  advantage  of   the   voluntary\r\n\r\nretirement scheme (VRS) that I announced in Parliament during\r\n\r\nthe  last  Budget, take an ex-gratia payment of $48,000,  and\r\n\r\nlook for an alternative means of livelihood.  MOM has put  in\r\n\r\nplace  schemes to assist these shopkeepers who do  decide  to\r\n\r\ntake  the  VRS  to look for alternative jobs, or  to  go  for\r\n\r\nupgrading  or retraining.  NTUC has also indicated that  they\r\n\r\nare prepared to bring them into a franchise scheme.  So there\r\n\r\nare  various alternatives if shopkeepers are not able to cope\r\n\r\nwith  the  rentals that have been set for them.  But  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst place, I think we ought to make the rentals fair across-the-board  for  everybody, and then we decide  what  are  the\r\n\r\nassistance  schemes that we can put in place if  somebody  is\r\n\r\nnot able to cope, and that is what HDB has done.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the Minister did not answer my second\r\n\r\nquestion  whether the market rates that have been used  as  a\r\n\r\nbenchmark  for  the  recent  rental  adjustment  reflect  the\r\n\r\npresent economic climate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> The market rates are set on a regular\r\n\r\nbasis.

So  to that extent, I would say, yes,  the  present\r\n\r\ncurrent  market rates are reflective of the current  economic\r\n\r\nconditions.   But that is on a general basis.

If\r\n\r\nthe  shopkeeper  finds that he is unable  to  cope  with  the\r\n\r\nrental  increases, as I said earlier, there are other avenues\r\n\r\nfor  him  to  continue to earn a living, including subletting\r\n\r\nhis shop, and having sublet his shop, taking that revenue  to\r\n\r\ndefray part of the cost of his shop, or assigning the shop to\r\n\r\nsomebody  else and still being able to earn some  income  or,\r\n\r\nalternatively, exiting from the retail trade altogether.  But\r\n\r\nto  subsidise and to continue to subsidise, as the Member  is\r\n\r\nsuggesting,  some of these shops in order  to  keep  them  in\r\n\r\nbusiness is, I think, not a correct approach for HDB to take.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I have a question\r\n\r\non  the  valuation.

And  in  this  round  of\r\n\r\nincreases that we did, when was the valuation done and, also,\r\n\r\nis  the valuation done on a collective basis, or is there  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  value  every  shophouse  according  to   its\r\n\r\nlocation, type of renovation that may have been done, type of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrade  that  it has been doing, and that perhaps  will  be  a\r\n\r\nbetter way of judging the value?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Rental reviews and valuation are done\r\n\r\non a regular basis.  It is being done now on an annual basis.\r\n\r\nReviews  on a location by location basis are done,  but  they\r\n\r\nare  staggered.  There is a programme whereby rental  reviews\r\n\r\nare  done on a locational basis.  In the review of the rents,\r\n\r\nthe  professional valuers will look at the general  location,\r\n\r\nspecific address of the shop, they look at the direction  and\r\n\r\nwhat the tendered rents have been.  They do not just look  at\r\n\r\nthe  highest rental, they also look at the range of  tendered\r\n\r\nrentals in order to make sure that there are no exceptionally\r\n\r\nhigh  rentals,  as  the Member mentioned  just  now.   Is  it\r\n\r\npossible that, in some cases, rentals are exceptionally  high\r\n\r\nbecause somebody wants a shop very badly?  I am told that the\r\n\r\nvaluers also look at such exceptional circumstances, and then\r\n\r\nthey  finally come to a judgement as to what is a fair market\r\n\r\nrental.  It is not unexpected that there is a dispute between\r\n\r\nwhat  the tenant should pay, or what he is prepared  to  pay,\r\n\r\nand what the HDB says he should pay.  When such disputes give\r\n\r\nrise   to   appeals,  the  appeals  would  then  be  adjudged\r\n\r\naccordingly.   Each  appeal is looked at  seriously,  and  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  any  cause for revision of that  rental  for  that\r\n\r\nspecific shop, it will be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

This would  benefit  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector in the long term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To effect the corporatisation, the Government granted\r\n\r\nthe  corporatised  PWD  a moratorium  period  of  five  years\r\n\r\nstarting  from  1st April 1999.  During this period,  PWDCorp\r\n\r\nPte  Ltd  is  to continue with architectural and  engineering\r\n\r\nconsultancy, project management, and construction supervision\r\n\r\nfor  the construction and engineering projects of Ministries.\r\n\r\nThis  is  to  ensure  a  smooth  transition  process  in  the\r\n\r\ncorporatisation.  However, projects of $20 million  or  below\r\n\r\nare   opened   for  competition  among  the  private   sector\r\n\r\nconsultants.   The value of work assigned to  PWDCorp  during\r\n\r\nthe  moratorium period is not more than what was already with\r\n\r\nthe PWD before its corporatisation.  PWDCorp does not perform\r\n\r\nany construction works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector has in fact benefited as a result of\r\n\r\nthe PWD corporatisation.  Before its corporatisation, PWD was\r\n\r\nhandling  all Ministry projects.  Since corporatisation,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has directly awarded more than $450 million  worth\r\n\r\nof  projects  each year to other private sector  consultants.\r\n\r\nNearly half of these are sizeable projects worth between  $12\r\n\r\nmillion and $20 million in value each.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I believe the\r\n\r\nMinister  of State mentioned $450 million worth of contracts.\r\n\r\nCould  I  know how much this is as a percentage of the  works\r\n\r\ngiven out by the Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, I do not have the figures\r\n\r\nwith  me, but let me just do a mental calculation.

Is there any inclination to push it up  higher?\r\n\r\nIs  the  private  sector  up to the job?   Historically,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has had reasons to doubt the private sector.

Once\r\n\r\nthe moratorium is over, they will have to compete on an equal\r\n\r\nfooting.

According  to  our\r\n\r\nstatistics  and  information, lower skilled workers  are  not\r\n\r\nonly  more vulnerable to retrenchments, but also find it more\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  seek re-employment.  If we do not  help  these\r\n\r\nworkers  upgrade their skills, many of them could  also  face\r\n\r\nthe  prospect of long term structural unemployment even after\r\n\r\nthe economy and the labour market recover.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that we have forgotten about\r\n\r\nexecutives and professionals.  They need help of a  different\r\n\r\nkind.  We offer employment assistance to displaced executives\r\n\r\nand  professionals  through  our  Career  Centre,  known   as\r\n\r\nCareerLink@mom.   The centre provides information  on  labour\r\n\r\nmarket  trends,  advice  on  job opportunities  and  training\r\n\r\nopportunities, and employment assistance for the  unemployed.\r\n\r\nIt  helps all categories of job seekers, including executives\r\n\r\nand  professionals,  as long as they are Singapore  citizens.\r\n\r\nThe  centre also works with organisations like the  Singapore\r\n\r\nNational   Employers  Federation  and  the  Singapore   Human\r\n\r\nResource   Institute  to  reach  out  to  professionals   and\r\n\r\nexecutives should they require employment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassistance.  Currently, 11% of the visitors to the centre are\r\n\r\ndiploma or degree holders.  And 23% of jobs in the CareerLink\r\n\r\njob bank are for professionals, managers and executives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last month, my Ministry also revamped our\r\n\r\nEmployment Town website (http://www.employmenttown.gov.sg) so\r\n\r\nas   to  provide  some  of  CareerLink's  services  over  the\r\n\r\nInternet,  online.  The revamped Employment  Town  will  help\r\n\r\nInternet-savvy executives and professionals in  their  search\r\n\r\nfor  jobs and learning opportunities, without them having  to\r\n\r\nphysically  visit  the career centre  at  my  Ministry.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry's job bank is also available on Employment Town.  To\r\n\r\nexpand  the available job options, the website also  provides\r\n\r\nlinks to other job banks, recruiters and employment agencies.\r\n\r\nIt  also  provides  information on  training  incentives  and\r\n\r\ntraining providers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the issue of retraining, executives and\r\n\r\nprofessionals  are mostly degree and diploma holders  who  do\r\n\r\nnot  lack basic skills.  Our training programmes have  to  be\r\n\r\nmore  focused.  For example, my Ministry has worked with  the\r\n\r\nInfocomm   Development  Authority  (IDA)  on  two   Strategic\r\n\r\nManpower Conversion Programmes (SMCP) to help executives  and\r\n\r\nprofessionals  make  a  career  transition  to  the  Infocomm\r\n\r\nsector.   This  programme,  which  was  launched  last  year,\r\n\r\nprovides  funding  support for employers  who  send  existing\r\n\r\nemployees or newly recruited staff for conversion training in\r\n\r\ninformation technology.  The programme also has a Facilitator\r\n\r\nScheme  for  individuals who have not  been  able  to  secure\r\n\r\nemployment  yet  and  hence are not able  to  get  employers'\r\n\r\nfunding support.  Facilitators will assess the suitability of\r\n\r\nthese candidates and register them for the conversion course.\r\n\r\nThey will also help to place trainees with suitable employers\r\n\r\nupon  completion of the course.  To date, some 250 mid-career\r\n\r\nexecutives have benefited from the programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the economic situation, my Ministry\r\n\r\nhopes  to work with economic agencies to roll out the  scheme\r\n\r\nin other sectors and to expand the training\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnumbers.

But in view of the commitment, in most cases very\r\n\r\nheavy  commitment,  of  most mid-level executives,  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Minister would consider some form of  insurance\r\n\r\nscheme with a view to perhaps legislating it, such as what is\r\n\r\nbeing done in many European countries, the idea here being to\r\n\r\nhelp  executives and professionals to tide over a  reasonable\r\n\r\nperiod  of time in between jobs when they get laid off,  such\r\n\r\nas in the current downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> We are going to encounter such ups\r\n\r\nand  downs  in  our economic growth from time  to  time.   We\r\n\r\nshould  not  deviate  from  some fundamental  positions  just\r\n\r\nbecause we run into an occasional hiccup.  We have had such a\r\n\r\ndownturn  before:  in  the  mid-70s,  in  1985/86  and,  more\r\n\r\nrecently,  in  1998.   We  have not  introduced  unemployment\r\n\r\ninsurance,  if  that is the concept that the hon.

Introducing  unemployment\r\n\r\ninsurance would be an additional cost factor for employers.\r\n\r\nWe  have always believed that our workers should save for the\r\n\r\nrainy  day.   We help them to save through the CPF mechanism,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  enable  them to meet their mortgage  commitments\r\n\r\nbesides  saving for old age.  Over and above  the  CPF,  many\r\n\r\nworkers  are  also  able to put aside additional  savings  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own, particularly when we are talking about executives\r\n\r\nand  professionals.  I would like to remind the  hon.  Member\r\n\r\nthat CPF contribution is capped at a ceiling of $6,000 of the\r\n\r\nsalary.    Income  above  $6,000  is  not  subject   to   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution   at  all.   Therefore,  there   is   tremendous\r\n\r\nopportunity for people in this category - the executives  and\r\n\r\nprofessionals  earning  more  than  $6,000  -  to  put  aside\r\n\r\nadditional  savings  on their own so  that  they  are  better\r\n\r\nprepared  for  any sudden ups and downs in  the  economy.

Individuals, including  unemployed  workers,\r\n\r\ncan benefit from the SRP incentives through the SRP Surrogate\r\n\r\nEmployer  Scheme run by NTUC and the self-help  groups.   The\r\n\r\nSRP has shown encouraging results.  As of end June this year,\r\n\r\nclose  to  54,000 training places have been  achieved.   This\r\n\r\nincludes  about  8,300 individuals who had  enrolled  in  SRP\r\n\r\ntraining  through  the Surrogate Employer Scheme.   There  is\r\n\r\ngood  representation  of  older workers.   Some  45%  of  SRP\r\n\r\ntrainees are aged 40 and above.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has asked for an indication of the number of\r\n\r\nmiddle-aged  workers  who  are  able  to  find   jobs   after\r\n\r\nretraining.  My Ministry and the NTUC initiated a survey last\r\n\r\nyear.   About  75%  of  workers who  took  up  full-time  SRP\r\n\r\ntraining  after  being retrenched were  able  to  secure  re-employment  within three to six months after their  training.\r\n\r\nWhen  asked  if SRP training had equipped them with  relevant\r\n\r\nskills  for  their new jobs, close to 60% agreed or  strongly\r\n\r\nagreed that it had done so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mendaki, one of our SRP's Surrogate Employers, conducted\r\n\r\na  similar survey recently among the retrenched workers  whom\r\n\r\nthey   had  sent  for  full-time  SRP  training.    All   the\r\n\r\nrespondents  received  job offers after  completing  the  SRP\r\n\r\ncourses. 70% of those who had undergone the programme were re-employed  within three months after training.  Close  to  80%\r\n\r\nwho were employed during the survey were also earning between\r\n\r\n$1,000  and  $1,500  a month. Most importantly,  78%  of  all\r\n\r\nrespondents  said  that the SRP course  had  been  useful  in\r\n\r\nhelping them to gain employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to add that the SRP has not only\r\n\r\nbenefited retrenched workers or the unemployed.  It has  also\r\n\r\nbenefited  employers  and in-employment  trainees,  in  other\r\n\r\nwords,  workers  who  are  still employed  and  have  a  job.\r\n\r\nAccording to the same survey commissioned by my Ministry  and\r\n\r\nNTUC,  70%  of employers reported that workers who  underwent\r\n\r\nthe  SRP  training had become more productive. 75% of workers\r\n\r\nwho had undergone in-employment training indicated that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey   were   more   confident  of   handling   greater   job\r\n\r\nresponsibilities and more complex tasks after the training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These results are an indication of the positive impact\r\n\r\nof  the  Skills Redevelopment Programme training on enhancing\r\n\r\nthe  skills of our older and less educated workers.

Hence, our skill upgrading programmes,  as  I\r\n\r\nexplained  earlier  on, offer enhanced  support  and  special\r\n\r\nincentives   to  the  older  workers.   Besides  the   Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment   Programme,  we  have  the   National   Skills\r\n\r\nRecognition System (NSRS) and other initiatives funded by the\r\n\r\nGovernment to help older and less educated workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate skills upgrading for older workers who do\r\n\r\nnot  possess  formal  education, we introduced  the  National\r\n\r\nSkills Recognition System in September last year.  This is an\r\n\r\nindustry-driven  framework to, firstly,  develop  and  review\r\n\r\nstandards  for job-specific skills and, secondly,  to  accord\r\n\r\nrecognition   for   standards   achieved   through   national\r\n\r\ncertification.  There is no entry educational requirement for\r\n\r\nthe National Skills Recognition System courses.  As a result,\r\n\r\nolder  workers without formal education can achieve certified\r\n\r\nNational   Skills  Recognition  System  standards  that   are\r\n\r\nrecognised  by the industry.  Industries where NSRS  training\r\n\r\nhas  been implemented include the hotel, marine, cleaning and\r\n\r\ncall centre industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also allocated resources to help older and lower\r\n\r\nskilled  workers acquire critical enabling skills which  will\r\n\r\nenhance  their employability.

As you  can\r\n\r\nsee  from the survey results which I gave just now, in  fact,\r\n\r\nemployers   do  recognise  the  benefits  of  putting   their\r\n\r\nemployees  or  new recruits through the Skills  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nTraining   programmes.   Increasingly,  as  more   and   more\r\n\r\nemployers  recognise  the benefits of  such  skills  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and that, in fact, an older worker  can  make  an\r\n\r\nequally good contribution to the company's effort, I am  sure\r\n\r\nthere  will  be more opportunities opening up for  the  older\r\n\r\nworkers.  But it has got to be a two-way effort, that is, the\r\n\r\nolder workers have to make that extra effort to upgrade their\r\n\r\nskills  so  that they can continue to make a contribution  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the company to compete and, on the other hand, we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to promote the benefits of employing older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  if  he  knows what the  reasons  are  for  the\r\n\r\nemployers'  reluctance to employ older workers and  what  can\r\n\r\nthe  older workers do to change the perception that employers\r\n\r\nmay have of them of not being suitable for their work.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> There are many reasons why some\r\n\r\nemployers are reluctant to employ older workers.  One of  the\r\n\r\nmore  commonly  cited reasons is the lack of  skills  by  the\r\n\r\nolder  workers,  who  are less able to do  the  job  that  an\r\n\r\nemployer\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  in the company.  This is an area that we can tackle  and\r\n\r\nwe  are  determined to tackle this through a wide variety  of\r\n\r\ntraining programmes. But there are other more market  reasons\r\n\r\nwhy some employers prefer a younger worker for a certain type\r\n\r\nof  work.  In some cases, we also have older workers who  are\r\n\r\nless  reluctant  to take on the job.  For instance,  we  have\r\n\r\nemployers in the food manufacturing industry crying  out  for\r\n\r\nworkers  and  they  are prepared to take older  workers,  but\r\n\r\nolder  workers are not prepared to take the job because  they\r\n\r\nare  required to work on a 12-hour shift and to be  in  their\r\n\r\nduty  stations for a fairly long period of time during  their\r\n\r\nworking  hours.  There are many reasons and we will  have  to\r\n\r\novercome  them over a period of time by constantly  educating\r\n\r\nemployers and, at the same time, upgrading the capability  of\r\n\r\nour  older  workers so that they are in a better position  to\r\n\r\ntake on these jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, discrimination\r\n\r\nagainst  older  workers  seems to be rather  widespread.   My\r\n\r\nexperience is also similar to the other MPs.  I have heard of\r\n\r\ncomplaints of people who are 40 years old and above who  find\r\n\r\nit  difficult  to get a job.  Sir, I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister   whether   he  is  willing  to  legislate   against\r\n\r\ndiscrimination against older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, as I have explained earlier on,\r\n\r\nit  is  not  a  question of discrimination  that  some  older\r\n\r\nworkers encounter greater difficulties getting a job, in  the\r\n\r\nsense that employers have ruled them out purely on age alone.\r\n\r\nThere  may  be some companies that have done that,  in  which\r\n\r\ncase  obviously,  they are missing out  on  opportunities  to\r\n\r\nrecruit workers that can help them.  On the other hand, there\r\n\r\nare many situations where the older workers are not given the\r\n\r\njob  simply  because of a mismatch and this  mismatch,  as  I\r\n\r\nexplained  earlier, can happen from both point of view.   The\r\n\r\nemployer may have an expectation of a certain level of skills\r\n\r\nwhich  the  older workers may not have, or the older  workers\r\n\r\nmay have certain expectations of the working environment that\r\n\r\nthe  employers are not able to provide.  So legislation  will\r\n\r\nnot cure\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  problem.

There was a step increase in\r\n\r\nrecruitment  in  1996,  following a  major  revision  to  the\r\n\r\nEducation Scheme of Service. Recruitment increased  from  the\r\n\r\nlevel of 1,000 per year prior to 1996, to an average of 1,950\r\n\r\nfrom 1996 to 1998, approximately double.  During the economic\r\n\r\ncrisis  in 1999, my Ministry took the opportunity to increase\r\n\r\nrecruitment  resulting in an exceptionally  large  intake  of\r\n\r\n3,325  trainee  teachers that year.  That  means   more  than\r\n\r\nthree  times what we have been recruiting per year  prior  to\r\n\r\n1996.  The increased recruitment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover  these  last  few  years has largely  been  due  to  the\r\n\r\nimproved scheme of service for the Education Service, and the\r\n\r\nrelative attractiveness of teaching compared to other careers\r\n\r\nduring the economic downturn.  Recruitment has settled at the\r\n\r\nlevel  of around 2,250 per year in the last two years.   This\r\n\r\nis  the level which my Ministry would be comfortable with  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  the staffing level of the teaching force  which  is\r\n\r\nnow about 24,000 strong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has maintained the same criteria and\r\n\r\nstandards  for recruitment throughout this period.   We  have\r\n\r\ncontinued to target our teacher recruitment at the  top  one-third   of  each  Primary  One  cohort,  which  will  include\r\n\r\ngraduates, school leavers with  good  `A' level results,  and\r\n\r\nthe  top  band  of  Polytechnic Diploma  graduates.   Besides\r\n\r\nsatisfying our shortlisting criteria, all applicants  to  the\r\n\r\nEducation  Service  are  interviewed by  a  panel  comprising\r\n\r\nsenior  educationists,  very often  senior  principals.   The\r\n\r\ninterview  panel  assesses  candidates  not  only  on   their\r\n\r\nacademic  qualifications alone but also on their interest  in\r\n\r\nteaching,  and  personal and leadership qualities  that  will\r\n\r\nenable  them  to  be good teachers.  While they  are  in  the\r\n\r\nNational Institute of Education undergoing training,  trainee\r\n\r\nteachers  are  also assessed for their aptitude and  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards teaching.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to cite one statistic to show how the\r\n\r\nnew  teachers  that  we are recruiting are  better  prepared.\r\n\r\nAbout  63%  of all new teachers recruited from 1996  to  2000\r\n\r\nwere  graduates or were enrolled into the National  Institute\r\n\r\nof  Education  for degree programmes.  As  a  result  of  the\r\n\r\ngreater number of graduates recruited, the overall percentage\r\n\r\nof  graduates in the teaching force has increased from  40.9%\r\n\r\nin  1996  to  55.4% in 2000, and we expect the proportion  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to rise.   I would like to assure Mr Sin  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  continue  to uphold  the  high  standards  in\r\n\r\nrecruiting good teachers for our schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, will the Minister be able to give\r\n\r\nme  an indication of the number of complaints made by parents\r\n\r\nagainst  the quality of teachers in schools over  the  years,\r\n\r\nand  whether  this number has gone down or has  remained  the\r\n\r\nsame?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, I am not able to give Mr Sin\r\n\r\nstatistics on this, because complaints can be defined in many\r\n\r\ndifferent ways.  So we do not keep statistics of this nature.\r\n\r\nMy  sense  is  that, yes, parents do take a greater  interest\r\n\r\ntoday  in the education of their children, and they  do  come\r\n\r\ninto  contact  with the teachers more often to discuss  about\r\n\r\ntheir children.  I think this is something positive and to be\r\n\r\nwelcomed, and I would encourage both parents and teachers  to\r\n\r\ntake  part  in  this  kind of discussion in  a  positive  and\r\n\r\nconstructive way for the benefit of students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say though that the young teachers are\r\n\r\ndoing very well.

I hope that this House, the public  and\r\n\r\nparents  will join me in encouraging and cheering  our  young\r\n\r\nteachers on, so that they will continue to do even better for\r\n\r\ntheir students.

As the  major  sea-lanes  are  our\r\n\r\neconomic  arteries,  Singapore's trade will  be  affected  if\r\n\r\npiracy  causes  ships  to  bypass our  main  shipping  lanes.\r\n\r\nPiracy  also poses serious threats to life at sea  and  could\r\n\r\nendanger navigational safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the coordinated efforts of various\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies, we have been effective in addressing the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  armed robberies within our waters.  Since  1991,\r\n\r\nthere  has  not  been  a  single  case  of  sea  robbery   in\r\n\r\nSingapore's  waters.   However, our territorial  waters  form\r\n\r\nonly  a  small  part  of  the main  shipping  lanes.   Piracy\r\n\r\nincidents outside our waters could still pose a threat to our\r\n\r\ninternational trading activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bilateral level, Singapore has been working\r\n\r\nclosely  with  Indonesia  to  address  the  problem  in   the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Straits   that  straddles  both   Singapore   and\r\n\r\nIndonesian  waters.   The law enforcement  agencies  of  both\r\n\r\ncountries  established  the  Indonesia-Singapore  Coordinated\r\n\r\nPatrol  (ISCP) to curb sea robbery in the Singapore  Straits.\r\n\r\nThe ISCP efforts include the regular exchange of information,\r\n\r\neffective operational channels of communication, as  well  as\r\n\r\ncross border pursuits.  The ISCP was also held up at the 1999\r\n\r\nInternational  Maritime Organisation  (IMO)  Piracy  Regional\r\n\r\nSeminar  in Singapore as a possible model for other countries\r\n\r\nto emulate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore also supports multilateral efforts to combat\r\n\r\npiracy  and  armed robbery against ships in the  region.   We\r\n\r\nworked  with the Japanese to conclude the \"Tokyo  Appeal  and\r\n\r\nModel  Action  Plan\" to strengthen counter measures  and  co-operation    among    coast    guard    agencies,    maritime\r\n\r\nadministrations  and  shipping  community  in  combating  the\r\n\r\nproblem in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also actively support the IMO's efforts in\r\n\r\nformulating   cooperative  arrangements  among   neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries  to  deal  with piracy and  sea  robberies  in  the\r\n\r\nMalacca Straits and South China Sea region.  We assisted  the\r\n\r\nIMO  in hosting and organising an anti-piracy seminar for the\r\n\r\nAsian  region  in  February  1999 and  a  follow-up  regional\r\n\r\nmeeting  in  March  2001  aimed at  promoting  and  enhancing\r\n\r\nregional cooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shipping community has a part to play in the fight\r\n\r\nagainst  piracy  and armed robbery.  MPA issues  Port  Marine\r\n\r\nCirculars to the shipping community advising them on measures\r\n\r\nto  reduce the risk of piracy and sea robbery attacks.   Such\r\n\r\nmeasures include an anti-attack plan that covers the need for\r\n\r\nenhanced  surveillance, detection equipment,  and  radio  and\r\n\r\nalarm procedures in the event of an attack.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piracy and hijacking are transnational crimes that\r\n\r\nrequire  the coordinated efforts of governments and  affected\r\n\r\nparties.

Therefore,\r\n\r\nmany  vehicles use it to get to the city during  the  morning\r\n\r\npeak  hours  and to return from the city during  the  evening\r\n\r\npeak  hours  as well as in the late evenings.   This  is  the\r\n\r\nreason for the traffic jams along it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) along the CTE spreads out\r\n\r\nthe  traffic flow to the city during the morning  peak  hours\r\n\r\nand hence reduces congestion in the morning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve the traffic situation along the CTE, the Land\r\n\r\nTransport   Authority  has  embarked  on  three  major   road\r\n\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the improvement to Upper Serangoon Road,\r\n\r\nwhich  includes a second level viaduct between Upper Aljunied\r\n\r\nRoad  and Upper Paya Lebar Road and the extension of the road\r\n\r\nto  Sengkang.  When completed in early 2002, Upper  Serangoon\r\n\r\nRoad  will  be  an attractive route to and from  Hougang  and\r\n\r\nSengkang and will help divert some of the vehicles away  from\r\n\r\nCTE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the improvement to the CTE-Braddell Road\r\n\r\njunction.   It will be completed by the end of 2002.   Today,\r\n\r\nvehicles queue back from this junction into the CTE and  slow\r\n\r\ndown  traffic  along the expressway.

Growth in the US, Japan and EU\r\n\r\nhas  slowed  sharply.  Strong growth during the  boom  years,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  the  US,  led  many  companies  to  ramp   up\r\n\r\nproduction  capacity, expecting demand to  continue  growing.\r\n\r\nWhen  demand slowed, partly because of the NASDAQ crash, they\r\n\r\nwere  caught  off-guard, forcing them to cut  production  and\r\n\r\nreduce  cost.  The simultaneous downturns in the US,  the  EU\r\n\r\nand Japan now feed negatively into each other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global electronics downturn has worsened even more\r\n\r\ndramatically in the last few months.  Worldwide semiconductor\r\n\r\nsales  declined  by  24% in May 2001.   Global  semiconductor\r\n\r\nsales  are expected to fall by 25-30% this year, down sharply\r\n\r\nfrom  +37%  growth  last year.  The global DRAM  industry  is\r\n\r\nexpected  to plunge by an unprecedented 55% this  year,  down\r\n\r\nfrom +37% last year.  The electronics industry is expected to\r\n\r\nremain weak at least till the end of 2001.\r\n\r\n.     Malaysia is also slowing down, compounding the problems\r\n\r\nthat  we face.  In  Indonesia, political uncertainty has made\r\n\r\neconomic recovery even more difficult but we hope that  under\r\n\r\nPresident  Megawati's  leadership, the situation  there  will\r\n\r\nimprove.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Singapore's Economic Performance</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot have a worse alignment of the planets. As a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  weaker external environment,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy   deteriorated  further  in   the   second   quarter.\r\n\r\nAnnualised quarter-on-quarter growth was -10.1% compared\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  -10.9% in the first quarter.  On a year-on-year  basis,\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economy slowed sharply to -0.8%  in  the  second\r\n\r\nquarter  from  +4.6% and +11.0% growth in  the  previous  two\r\n\r\nquarters.   The  slowdown was across all the  major  sectors,\r\n\r\nparticularly manufacturing where output fell by 11%  in  May,\r\n\r\ndue largely to the 20% plunge in the electronics industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our export performance has also worsened, in line with\r\n\r\nweaker  export  markets.  Non-oil domestic  exports  fell  by\r\n\r\n16.9% in June and 9.4% in the second quarter of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labour market is also showing weakness.\r\n\r\nRetrenchments  rose  in  the first  quarter,  reflecting  the\r\n\r\ndownturn  in  the  global electronics  cycle  and  weaker  US\r\n\r\ngrowth.  We expect it to increase as companies start shedding\r\n\r\nworkers.   Several  MNCs like Maxtor and  Aiwa  have  already\r\n\r\nannounced  job  cuts.   Many have also  moved  to  a  shorter\r\n\r\nworkweek.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the sharp deterioration in economic\r\n\r\nconditions, we have revised the 2001 growth forecast down  to\r\n\r\n0.5-1.5 % this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Measures to Cushion Impact of the Downturn</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite almost 10% growth last year, many businesses,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  smaller ones, have not  recovered  from  the\r\n\r\neffects of the regional crisis in 1998.  We therefore left in\r\n\r\nplace  some  of the measures introduced in the last  package.\r\n\r\nIn this year's Budget, we have reduced corporate and property\r\n\r\ntax  rates  to  help  companies, especially  SMEs.   To  help\r\n\r\nhouseholds  and  workers,  the income  tax  rates  have  been\r\n\r\nlowered.  In addition to CPF top-ups, the Government has also\r\n\r\ngranted  rebates  on personal taxes, service and  conservancy\r\n\r\ncharges  and  rentals.   A new \"Utilities  Save\"  scheme  was\r\n\r\nintroduced  to  help  households pay higher  electricity  and\r\n\r\nwater bills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cushion the effects of the current downturn, the\r\n\r\nGovernment has put together a package of additional  measures\r\n\r\nwhich  I  will now announce.  They are classified into  three\r\n\r\ncategories: namely,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures  to accelerate the building of economic  and  social\r\n\r\ninfrastructure; cost-cutting measures to help companies;  and\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  help  those retrenched and  to  promote  worker\r\n\r\nretraining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further details will be given by the respective agencies\r\n\r\nover the next few days.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economic and Social Infrastructure</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the open nature of our economy, it is difficult to\r\n\r\nstimulate  the economy by generating domestic demand  through\r\n\r\nGovernment  pump-priming.  However, there are  some  projects\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Government can bring forward.   Accelerating  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of our economic and social infrastructure will  let\r\n\r\nus  take advantage of low tender prices, and will enhance our\r\n\r\ncapabilities  over  the long-term.  Some  of  these  projects\r\n\r\ninclude  the  development  of  Jurong  Island,  drainage  and\r\n\r\nsewerage  works, road and commuter facilities, and  upgrading\r\n\r\nof  IT  projects at polytechnics and universities.  In total,\r\n\r\nbringing forward these projects will inject $204 million into\r\n\r\nthe  economy in this financial year and $512 million  in  the\r\n\r\nnext financial year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Cost-Cutting Measures</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Labour Cost</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour cost is a key component of total business cost.\r\n\r\nIn  difficult times, adjusting wages is an important  way  to\r\n\r\nsave  jobs  and  prevent  companies from  going  under.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the unions have therefore been  pushing  for\r\n\r\nflexible  wages.  We have made good progress in  building  up\r\n\r\nthe variable wage component over the years, although there is\r\n\r\nstill  some  way  to  go.   So far, about  30%  of  unionised\r\n\r\ncompanies  but  only  2.4%  of non-unionised  companies  have\r\n\r\nimplemented  a monthly variable component.  In  this  current\r\n\r\neconomic downturn, the variable component that we have  built\r\n\r\nup  provides our first buffer.  It is far better to cut  back\r\n\r\non  bonuses  and  perks than to retrench  workers.  Companies\r\n\r\nwhich are not doing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwell  should  use  this  mechanism to  pay  smaller  variable\r\n\r\nbonuses this year, in line with the NWC recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjusting the CPF contribution rates is a measure of\r\n\r\nlast  resort and should never be done lightly.  In  the  1998\r\n\r\npackage,  the  Government cut the employers' CPF contribution\r\n\r\nby 10 percentage points to help companies reduce costs and to\r\n\r\nsave  jobs.   It was progressively restored by six percentage\r\n\r\npoints  as the economy recovered in the last two years.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment   would  like  to  restore  the   remaining   four\r\n\r\npercentage  points  as soon as possible because  the  CPF  is\r\n\r\nessentially  our  retirement savings plan.  Keeping  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rates below the 20% level for too long will mean\r\n\r\nless savings for our old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal circumstances, we would have restored a\r\n\r\nfurther increment of employer CPF contributions at the end of\r\n\r\nthis year.  However, in the present difficult conditions, the\r\n\r\nfirst  priority is to save jobs by helping companies to lower\r\n\r\ncosts.   The Government has therefore decided not to increase\r\n\r\nthe  employer CPF contribution rate at the end of this  year.\r\n\r\nWe  will  review  the situation again in the middle  of  next\r\n\r\nyear.   This gives certainty to the first half of  next  year\r\n\r\nand  translates to a saving of $920 million for employers for\r\n\r\nthe first six months of next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some businessmen have suggested to MTI that the CPF\r\n\r\nshould  be  cut again.  We do not believe that such  a  major\r\n\r\nmove  is  justified at this stage.  However,  if  the  global\r\n\r\neconomy continues to deteriorate, we may have to consider all\r\n\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Foreign Worker Levy</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hold down business costs further, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nManpower will extend the current reduced foreign worker  levy\r\n\r\nrates  for another year till June 2002.  This will  cost  the\r\n\r\nGovernment revenue of $324 million.  Existing controls on the\r\n\r\nintake of Work Permit holders remain unchanged to ensure that\r\n\r\nemployers  do  not  become over-reliant on  foreign  workers,\r\n\r\nespecially the lower skilled foreigners.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Property Tax Rebate</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nannounced a cut in the property tax rate from 12% to 10%  for\r\n\r\nall  commercial, industrial and residential properties.  That\r\n\r\nreduction  was to take effect from 1st July this  year,  when\r\n\r\nthe  25%  property tax rebate for commercial  and  industrial\r\n\r\nproperties ended.  The Ministry of Finance has now decided to\r\n\r\nextend  the  25%  property  tax  rebate  for  commercial  and\r\n\r\nindustrial properties for a year from 1st July this  year  to\r\n\r\n30th  June  next year.  As the property tax has been  reduced\r\n\r\nfrom  12%  to  10% on 1st July this year, the effective  rate\r\n\r\nduring  this  period would thus be 7.5%  as  compared  to  9%\r\n\r\nbefore this.  This will cost the Government $257 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rental Rebate</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, JTC and HDB withdrew part of the\r\n\r\nrebates  given in the 1998 package of measures.  In  view  of\r\n\r\nthe  current downturn, we have decided to extend  the  rental\r\n\r\nrebates  for  another year till end June  next  year  and  to\r\n\r\nincrease the quantum of rebates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC will grant an additional 10% rental rebate, giving\r\n\r\nan  effective  rebate  of  up  to  20%.   HDB  will  give  an\r\n\r\nadditional  5% rebate on top of the existing 5% (and  another\r\n\r\nrebate of up to 20% for those paying above market rates)  and\r\n\r\nthis will extend for a year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, CAAS will offer a 15% basic rental rebate for\r\n\r\nwarehouse, office and concession space in the Airport  for  a\r\n\r\nyear  till  the  end of June next year.   It  will  also  not\r\n\r\nincrease the airport service charge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB, JTC and CAAS will also pass on the savings from the\r\n\r\nreduction  in the property tax rate to their tenants.   Other\r\n\r\nlandlords  are encouraged to similarly pass on the  reduction\r\n\r\nin property taxes to their tenants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For market and hawker stallholders, the Ministry of the\r\n\r\nEnvironment,  HDB and JTC will be giving a 10% rental  rebate\r\n\r\nto  their  stallholders  who  are  paying  market  rent.   An\r\n\r\nadditional rental rebate of up to 20%\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  be  given if the rebated rent is still higher than  the\r\n\r\nprevailing market rent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these rental rebates will take effect from 1st July\r\n\r\n2001  for  a  year  and  they will cost the  Government  $272\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Transport Cost</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To soften the impact on regional trade and travel, the\r\n\r\nMaritime  and Port Authority of Singapore will give 20%  port\r\n\r\ndues  concession  for container ships and commercial  harbour\r\n\r\ncraft.   This will save businesses $7 million for the  period\r\n\r\n1st July this year to 30th June next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Access to Finance</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some companies face greater difficulties gaining access\r\n\r\nto capital for their businesses during this downturn as banks\r\n\r\nbecome more cautious.  To help local companies, the Singapore\r\n\r\nProductivity  and  Standards  Board  (PSB)  will  raise   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  risk  sharing of the Local  Enterprise  Finance\r\n\r\nScheme  (LEFS) from 50% to 70% for one year from  1st  August\r\n\r\n2001.   In  anticipation  of the increased  demand,  we  will\r\n\r\nincrease  the  loan availability under LEFS by  $60  million.\r\n\r\nPSB  is  also  working on a new programme  to  make  it  more\r\n\r\nflexible for banks to lend to SMEs with varying credit  risks\r\n\r\nby covering part of the risk through a loan insurance scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help medium-sized companies, the coverage of LEFS\r\n\r\nwill also be expanded to cover enterprises with at least  30%\r\n\r\nlocal  equity,  with  fixed asset investment  of  up  to  $50\r\n\r\nmillion and employment size of not more than 300 workers  for\r\n\r\nservice  companies.  This is significantly  higher  than  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  limit  of  $15  million  in  terms  of  fixed  asset\r\n\r\ninvestment  and  200 workers for service companies.   A  loan\r\n\r\nline  of  $60  million will be set aside  for  this  purpose.\r\n\r\nTogether  with the additional $60 million mentioned  earlier,\r\n\r\nthe total loan availability under LEFS will be raised by $120\r\n\r\nmillion from $600 million now to $720 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional grants will also be set aside under the\r\n\r\nEnhanced Local Enterprise Technical Assistance Scheme (LETAS)\r\n\r\nto  enhance  specific programmes which help  local  companies\r\n\r\nstrengthen their capital\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstructure,   trim  cost,  improve  cashflow  and   streamline\r\n\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures are for a period of one year.\r\n\r\nBesides  the  additional  loan line of  $120  million,  these\r\n\r\nmeasures  are  expected to cost the Government an  additional\r\n\r\n$10 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Measures to Help the Unemployed and Promote Worker Retraining</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrenchments are expected to reach 20,000 this year.\r\n\r\nOlder  workers and less educated workers are more  vulnerable\r\n\r\nto  retrenchment  in  a  downturn, and Members  raised  their\r\n\r\nconcern  in this House earlier on at Question Time.  Many  of\r\n\r\nthem  face  difficulty  getting  re-employed.   To  help  the\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers, and particularly those in the vulnerable\r\n\r\ngroups,  the  Ministry  of Manpower (MOM)  is  expanding  its\r\n\r\nemployment assistance and training programmes in a major way.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Increased Efforts in Job Matching</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of job matching, MOM currently operates a\r\n\r\ncareer  centre.   The centre provides information  on  labour\r\n\r\nmarket trends, advice on job and training opportunities,  and\r\n\r\nemployment assistance.  Because of the economic downturn, the\r\n\r\ncentre has served twice the number of users in recent months.\r\n\r\nTo  reach  out to even more workers, MOM will further  expand\r\n\r\nthe  centre's  services and increase  the  number  of  access\r\n\r\npoints  to these services.  It will work with NTUC, self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  and  other community organisations to make  available\r\n\r\nsimilar services and information at their locations.  MOM has\r\n\r\nalso  put  in more services on the Internet and expanded  its\r\n\r\nEmployment Town website.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From next month, MOM will also be starting a series of\r\n\r\ncommunity  based job fairs to bring together job seekers  and\r\n\r\nemployers.  And it is targeting to organise an average of one\r\n\r\njob fair per month for the rest of the year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>`People For Jobs' Traineeship Programme</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many retrenched workers will find that the jobs which\r\n\r\nthey  are  used to will no longer be available  in  Singapore\r\n\r\neven  after the economy recovers.  This is especially so  for\r\n\r\nolder  and  less educated workers previously engaged  in  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector.  To stay employed, some  of  them  will\r\n\r\nhave to switch to other industries, particularly those in the\r\n\r\nservices sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making this change requires openness and flexibility on\r\n\r\nthe part of both workers and employers.  Workers will have to\r\n\r\nmake  some  adjustments and accept different job requirements\r\n\r\nand  work  environments.  Employers on their part  should  be\r\n\r\nmore  prepared to hire such mid-career workers who  are  good\r\n\r\nworkers  but newcomers to the industry and to help ease  them\r\n\r\ninto their new jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help older workers with low education make this\r\n\r\nadjustment,  MOM  is  piloting a  new  programme  called  the\r\n\r\n\"People  for  Jobs\" Traineeship Programme.  The programme  is\r\n\r\nakin to an apprentice programme for mid-career workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the programme, MOM will provide financial support\r\n\r\nof  up  to $3.80 per hour or $600 per month for three  months\r\n\r\nfor  companies which employ these retrenched workers, and who\r\n\r\nagree to put in place a mentorship or traineeship arrangement\r\n\r\nto  help  settle  in  these workers.  MOM has  found  several\r\n\r\nemployers  who  are  prepared  to  take  part  in  the  pilot\r\n\r\nprogramme.   Together, they are able to  provide  immediately\r\n\r\n400  places  in the services sector.  And these include  jobs\r\n\r\nsuch as sales and retail assistants, room stewards, telephone\r\n\r\noperators  and  housekeepers.   MOM  hopes  to  expand   this\r\n\r\nprogramme  rapidly and to increase the number of  traineeship\r\n\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Expansion of Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of skills training, MOM and NTUC operate the\r\n\r\nSRP  to  help  lower  educated  workers  acquire  certifiable\r\n\r\nskills.  Through the SRP, some 54,000 workers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave   equipped  themselves  with  relevant  skills  to  stay\r\n\r\nemployable.   In  view  of the economic  downturn,  MOM  will\r\n\r\nfurther  enhance the programme.  The list of approved courses\r\n\r\nwill  also be significantly expanded to benefit more  workers\r\n\r\nand  employers.   And we hope to double  the  number  of  SRP\r\n\r\ntrainees this year from 20,000 to 40,000 workers.  This  will\r\n\r\ncost  an additional $28 million.  And should there be greater\r\n\r\ndemand, MOM is ready to expand the programme further.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Incentives for Employers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For workers sponsored by employers, SDF funds up to 80%\r\n\r\nof  the  course fees incurred for workers less than 40  years\r\n\r\nold.  For workers aged 40 and above, SDF funds up to 100%  of\r\n\r\nthe  course fees.  Currently, many employers sending  workers\r\n\r\nfor  SRP  training have to pay the full fees first and  claim\r\n\r\nfor reimbursement only after completion of the courses.  With\r\n\r\nthe  business  downturn,  many employers  may  not  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to come up with the cash upfront.  MOM is therefore\r\n\r\nworking   out  an  arrangement  with  PSB  and  the  training\r\n\r\nproviders  so  that the employers only need to  pay  the  net\r\n\r\namount.  Details will be announced once they are finalized.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to course fee support, absentee payroll\r\n\r\nsupport  is also provided to employers to encourage  them  to\r\n\r\nsend less skilled workers for training.  From 1st August this\r\n\r\nyear,  the  absentee payroll support will be  increased  from\r\n\r\n$5.10  to  $5.40 per trainee hour for workers  less  than  40\r\n\r\nyears  old,  and  from $6.15 to $6.50 per  trainee  hour  for\r\n\r\nworkers  older  than  40  years.   We  hope  that  this  will\r\n\r\nencourage more employers to send their workers for training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to NTUC, around 30,000 workers are already, or\r\n\r\nwill  be, on temporary layoff or shorter workweek.  We should\r\n\r\nput  this  slack to good use.  Companies that are facing  low\r\n\r\ndemand  and  have consequently implemented shorter  workweeks\r\n\r\nand  temporary  layoffs  should send their  workers  for  SRP\r\n\r\ntraining.  And during this period of training,  workers  will\r\n\r\nreceive $3.80 per trainee\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhour  or $600 per month as training allowance.  Participating\r\n\r\ncompanies,  which  might  otherwise  have  retrenched   their\r\n\r\nworkers, need not top up the training allowance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these measures, we hope to persuade employers to\r\n\r\nuse  the  business slowdown to upgrade the  skills  of  their\r\n\r\nworkers  rather than quickly resorting to layoffs.  By  doing\r\n\r\nso,  they  will be more competitive and better prepared  when\r\n\r\nthe economy turns around.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Help For Retrenched Workers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals on their own, including those who are\r\n\r\nunemployed,  can  also  sign  up for  SRP  through  surrogate\r\n\r\nemployers like the self-help groups and NTUC.  The Government\r\n\r\nhelps  to  pay  for the course fees of these  workers,  while\r\n\r\nthese surrogate employers provide additional support for low-income earners and those who are unemployed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1999, 8,000 workers benefited from SRP training\r\n\r\nunder the sponsorship of surrogate employers.  To enable  the\r\n\r\nsurrogate  employers to reach out to more workers,  SDF  will\r\n\r\nincrease  the  course fee support given to  them.   From  1st\r\n\r\nAugust  this  year, SDF will increase its course fee  support\r\n\r\nfor  trainees aged 40 and above under the surrogate  employer\r\n\r\nscheme from 80% to 100%.  In addition, for trainees below  40\r\n\r\nyears  old, the Ministry of Manpower will provide a  separate\r\n\r\ngrant  from the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund to surrogate\r\n\r\nemployers to offset part of their cost.  These measures  will\r\n\r\nhelp to encourage the self-help groups and NTUC to reach  out\r\n\r\nto even more individuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unemployed workers who go for SRP training will improve\r\n\r\ntheir  short and long-term re-employment prospects,  but  may\r\n\r\nhave  financial difficulties during the training period.   To\r\n\r\nhelp  them,  the  Government provides a  training  allowance.\r\n\r\nFrom  1st  August  this  year, we will  raise  this  training\r\n\r\nallowance from $3 per hour capped at $500 per month to  $3.80\r\n\r\nper  hour capped at $600 per month, which is the same  amount\r\n\r\ngiven to workers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder employment who have taken time off for training.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enabling Skills for Less-Educated Workers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant number of workers still lack basic skills\r\n\r\nthat  are  increasingly required at the workplace.   Together\r\n\r\nwith  its  partners, the Ministry of Manpower has  introduced\r\n\r\ntwo  programmes: the National IT Literacy Programme  and  the\r\n\r\ncommunity-based CREST programme to help these workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National IT Literacy Programme, jointly developed\r\n\r\nwith  IDA,  aims  to improve the employment prospect  of  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  by  equipping  them  with  basic  computer  and\r\n\r\nInternet  skills.  The Ministry of Manpower  will  invest  $8\r\n\r\nmillion  for the first year and another $19 million over  the\r\n\r\nnext  two years to ensure that the training courses are  kept\r\n\r\naffordable for all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CREST programme, or Critical Enabling Skills\r\n\r\nTraining, introduced by PSB in November 1998, aims to provide\r\n\r\nseven  cores skills, such as `Learning-to-Learn',  `Literacy'\r\n\r\nand   `Problem  Solving  and  Creativity'  to   enhance   the\r\n\r\nemployability  of  an  individual  worker.   Presently,  only\r\n\r\nworkers  sponsored  by  employers are given  funding  support\r\n\r\nthrough  SDF  for attending such training.  With effect  from\r\n\r\nOctober this year, the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund  will\r\n\r\nprovide  funding  support through community self-help  groups\r\n\r\nfor individuals without employer support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These training and training support efforts will cost\r\n\r\nabout $40 million over the next year.  However, we should not\r\n\r\nsee  budget  here as a constraint.  We hope that  the  demand\r\n\r\nwill grow, and the Government is prepared to spend as much as\r\n\r\nis  needed  to help more Singaporean workers stay employable.\r\n\r\nThe key is to help them stay employable.  The goal is easy to\r\n\r\ndefine but hard to achieve.  We welcome more ideas on how our\r\n\r\nworkers can be better prepared for global competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic slowdown is also causing the retrenchment\r\n\r\nof  executives and professionals.  As they have skills,  many\r\n\r\nof  them will be able to find alternative employment,  albeit\r\n\r\nat  lower salaries.  Despite the slowdown, the Government  is\r\n\r\ncontinuing  to  recruit,  for example,  teachers  and  school\r\n\r\nadministrators  in  the  Ministry of  Education,  and  senior\r\n\r\nofficers to serve in many Ministries.  The Government  cannot\r\n\r\nbecome  the employer of last resort, but it is on the lookout\r\n\r\nfor  good  people to strengthen the Ministries and  statutory\r\n\r\nboards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professionals will also benefit from EDB's Training and\r\n\r\nAttachment  Programme.  EDB is stepping  up  its  efforts  to\r\n\r\nbuild capabilities in research and development (R&D), product\r\n\r\nand  market  development  through  this  programme  will   be\r\n\r\nextended  to  training in local companies.   Companies  which\r\n\r\nface constraints in providing training in-house can work with\r\n\r\nour  research  institutes and research centres to  host  such\r\n\r\ntraining,  fully funded by Government.  This  programme  will\r\n\r\nhelp companies to continue training and building capabilities\r\n\r\nat  a  time when they are under pressure to cut back on these\r\n\r\nlong-term activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In putting together this package, we are grateful for\r\n\r\nthe  suggestions made by many organisations and  individuals,\r\n\r\nincluding   members   of   the   Committee   on   Singapore's\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness,  the Singapore Chinese Chamber  of  Commerce\r\n\r\nand  Industry, the Singapore Confederation of Industries, the\r\n\r\nReal  Estate  Developers' Association and the Feedback  Unit.\r\n\r\nThe  total cost impact of the measures announced in this off-Budget  package is estimated at $2.2 billion over  one  year.\r\n\r\nThis  is  equivalent to 1.4% of GDP.  Though not as large  as\r\n\r\nthe  package  announced at the end of 1998 during  the  Asian\r\n\r\nfinancial crisis, it is a significant package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the US economy is currently at a virtual\r\n\r\nstandstill, there are some signs of improvement.   There  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  pickup in the leading index, and consumer confidence\r\n\r\nhas held firm in recent months.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFederal Reserve Chairman Greenspan sounded a cautious note of\r\n\r\noptimism  in  his  recent  testimony  to  the  US  House   of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives.  Although he still saw greater risks on  the\r\n\r\ndownside,  he  also  saw  signs of a  bottoming  out  of  the\r\n\r\ndownturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This package will help businesses cope with the crisis.\r\n\r\nIt will also help workers, especially older and less-educated\r\n\r\nworkers, to prepare themselves to retain their jobs  or  find\r\n\r\nnew  jobs.  And it will supplement the measures announced  in\r\n\r\nthe Budget in February, especially the corporate and personal\r\n\r\ntax   reductions,  and  the  rebates  to  help   lower-income\r\n\r\nhouseholds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we must be realistic. No package of Government\r\n\r\nspending  can neutralise the global downturn, the electronics\r\n\r\nslump, or the regional problems which are the root causes  of\r\n\r\nthe slowdown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI will monitor closely the economic situation in the\r\n\r\ncoming months.  If the global situation worsens, we have  the\r\n\r\nresources to do more, and will be ready to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as we navigate carefully through this difficult\r\n\r\nperiod,  we  can  be  confident of Singapore's  future.   Our\r\n\r\nmedium  and long-term prospects are good, provided we do  not\r\n\r\nmake  major mistakes.  The Singapore economy is fundamentally\r\n\r\nsound,  and  the  confidence of MNCs  and  investors  in  our\r\n\r\neconomy  remains  high.   For example,  even  though  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments   into   the  region  have  declined,   Singapore\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  attract major investments from abroad.   Major\r\n\r\nprojects  announced recently include a 12-inch wafer  fab  by\r\n\r\nTaiwan's  UMC, a state-of-the-art TFT Liquid Crystal  Display\r\n\r\nplant  by Toshiba-Matsushita, a regional distribution  centre\r\n\r\nby  Daimler-Chrysler, and a pharmaceutical research centre by\r\n\r\nEli  Lilly.  On the services side, leading B2B companies, eg,\r\n\r\nE2open  and Converge, have set up their Asia-Pacific hubs  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Autodesk, an established US software company, has\r\n\r\nalso  set  up  its  Asia-Pacific  headquarters  and  its  R&D\r\n\r\noperations here.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing investment commitments in the first half\r\n\r\nof this year totalled $5.9 billion, in terms of fixed assets,\r\n\r\nwhich is about two-thirds the $9 billion target for the whole\r\n\r\nof  this year.  So there is a reasonable chance that we  will\r\n\r\nbe  able to achieve our target of $9 billion this year.  When\r\n\r\nrealised,  these  commitments are expected to  generate  $4.3\r\n\r\nbillion of value added and create about 8,700 jobs.  Services\r\n\r\ncommitments  reached $800 million in terms of total  business\r\n\r\nspending  in the first half of the year, and are expected  to\r\n\r\ngenerate  $750  million in value added and  3,600  jobs  when\r\n\r\nrealised.   In  addition, our current  negotiations  on  Free\r\n\r\nTrade   Agreements  with  major  economies  will   open   new\r\n\r\nopportunities for our businesses and attract more  FDIs  into\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the present slowdown is largely cyclical, we\r\n\r\nmust  press  on  with  the  restructuring  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy.  Despite the dot.com crash, the New Economy  is  for\r\n\r\nreal  and  we  must  make use of IT and e-commerce  to  raise\r\n\r\nproductivity and add value.  The entry of China into the  WTO\r\n\r\nwill put pressure on wages all over the world, especially  at\r\n\r\nthe  lower  end.   Whether we like  it  or  not,  because  of\r\n\r\nglobalisation, we are competing with hundreds of millions  of\r\n\r\neager  and hungry Chinese and Indian workers for the  low-end\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must therefore scramble up the value ladder quickly.\r\n\r\nAnd,  to  do  this,  we must liberalise and rationalise  many\r\n\r\nsectors  of  the economy, for example, in banking,  telecommu\r\n\r\nnications,  and  power generation and supply.   As  companies\r\n\r\ntighten  their belts, they should try not to put off  longer-term   improvement  plans.   They  should  build   up   their\r\n\r\ncapabilities  and reposition themselves for  the  turnaround.\r\n\r\nSome  companies  will  not be able  to  do  this  because  of\r\n\r\nfinancial difficulties.  For them, the cost-cutting  measures\r\n\r\nwill provide some help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers should take this opportunity to train and\r\n\r\nupgrade so that we can switch quickly to new and better jobs.\r\n\r\nThe   Government  will  do  everything  possible  to  attract\r\n\r\ninvestment, promote enterprise\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and help our workers stay employable.

Could the Government take a stronger stand  in\r\n\r\nfuture  towards  such  requests?  Would the  Government  also\r\n\r\nconsider  reviewing the employment pass policy, eg,  reducing\r\n\r\nthe number of employment pass for job areas which can be well\r\n\r\nperformed by Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during this\r\n\r\nperiod,  we  should look for all the bright spots that  there\r\n\r\nare  on  our  radar screen.  There is one major  bright  spot\r\n\r\nwhich  needs repeated emphasis, ie, China.  China is expected\r\n\r\nto  grow  at 7% over the next five years despite this  global\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn.  Those of us who have been to  China  are\r\n\r\nable  to sense the organic growth, the self-sustaining growth\r\n\r\nresulting  from the development of its own domestic  economy.\r\n\r\nChina will become\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery  big  and  the  earlier  we  size  up  the  threats  and\r\n\r\nopportunities, the better we will be prepared for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would describe it as a kind of a juggernaut which we\r\n\r\nsee  coming  down  the road, still at first  gear,  lumbering\r\n\r\nalong,  but gradually picking up speed.  We can either  stand\r\n\r\nin  front of the juggernaut and turn to cardboard or we study\r\n\r\nit  carefully  and say, \"Look, let us find a good  hand-hold,\r\n\r\nget  our  skateboard ready, put on our Walkman, and  hitch  a\r\n\r\nride  when the juggernaut gathers speed.\"  And we can do this\r\n\r\nbecause we have an inside track into China.  We have cultural\r\n\r\nrelations,  we have good political relations,  and  China  is\r\n\r\nalready our No. 1 investment destination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from the viewpoint of the economic agencies, we are\r\n\r\nnow conducting a review to increase our presence in China  in\r\n\r\na  major  way.   Take tourism as an example.  Throughout  the\r\n\r\nlast  crisis,  tourism  growth from  China  increased  double\r\n\r\ndigits,  and  we  can  expect tourism growth  from  China  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  increasing in the coming years.  As  each  province\r\n\r\nopens up, many millions of Chinese will want to travel and we\r\n\r\nmust  capture our share of it.  There are many areas in which\r\n\r\nChina  will offer opportunities, including a reverse flow  of\r\n\r\ninvestments into Southeast Asia.  I have been monitoring  the\r\n\r\ninvestment  trends, and Chinese investment in  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nbeen  rising steadily.  Still small, but a significant trend,\r\n\r\nand we should build on it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are other countries like India which\r\n\r\nwe  should  look at.  EDB will be increasing  the  number  of\r\n\r\noverseas trade delegations and any opportunities that we  are\r\n\r\nalerted to, we would disseminate to the business community as\r\n\r\nquickly as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo asked about what we can do to encourage employers\r\n\r\nto  take  a more generous and liberal attitude towards  older\r\n\r\nworkers.   This is a major issue for us.  It is a  structural\r\n\r\nproblem  because  many  of  our baby-boomers  never  had  the\r\n\r\nopportunity and they still have 20 to 30 years of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworking  life  ahead of them and they are not well  educated.\r\n\r\nAmong them, there is widespread fear that if their number  is\r\n\r\ncalled,  then  it  is very difficult for  them  to  find  re-employment.    It  is  widespread.   I  have,   in   my   own\r\n\r\nconstituency, grassroots leaders who are in this predicament.\r\n\r\nI  have  received  letters  from others  who  complain  about\r\n\r\ncompetition from foreign workers and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last weekend's Talking Point, Mr Heng Chee How, Mr\r\n\r\nStephen Lee and one of the workers retrenched, Mr Anwar, gave\r\n\r\na  very  moving  account of their experiences.   It  requires\r\n\r\nattitudinal change on the part of all players in our economy.\r\n\r\nFirstly, among our workers, retrain, at the minimum, learn e-mail.  Try, do not say, \"Look, I am too old for it.\"  If  you\r\n\r\ncannot  even  send e-mail and work the computer keyboard,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  very difficult to be re-employed, and  it  is  not\r\n\r\ndifficult to learn.  The key here is a psychological  barrier\r\n\r\nand  we must help them to overcome it.  We have a whole  slew\r\n\r\nof  programmes which we announced earlier to help  those  who\r\n\r\nare interested to upgrade themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of employers, Mr Stephen Lee told us that\r\n\r\nthere  is already a shift but we should accelerate the shift.\r\n\r\nIt  is  very important for us.  If you study McDonalds,  they\r\n\r\nhave  done  a  very good job and we should do a special  case\r\n\r\nstudy  on  McDonalds.  Many of us are used,  when  we  go  to\r\n\r\nMcDonalds, to have aunties and uncles serve us, and that term\r\n\r\nhas  acquired a certain affectionate ring to it.   When  they\r\n\r\ncome  to wipe the tables or to collect our trays, people  try\r\n\r\nto  minimise  their work.  So when they can, they  will  also\r\n\r\ndispose of their disposables and stack the trays up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did McDonalds achieve this? Not by paying these\r\n\r\nworkers  very high wages - in fact, if they had to  pay  them\r\n\r\nvery  high wages, they would never have been employed in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  place -  but by altering work design.  If you look  at\r\n\r\nthe  keyboard at McDonalds, it is very simple: one  fillet-o-fish, one big Mac, you press the button, it is done.  You  do\r\n\r\nnot require very much training and the workers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwear  smart uniforms, they go for outings together, they  get\r\n\r\nfree meals, they become a little community.  If the employers\r\n\r\nare prepared to make this investment in management, they will\r\n\r\nfind that this investment will more than pay for itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give you another example. Robinsons, which is\r\n\r\nwell-known for their excellent service, they have  got  older\r\n\r\nstaff,  more  stable staff.  Many of our departmental  stores\r\n\r\nget  into  a vicious circle where, to save costs,  they  hire\r\n\r\npart-timers.  Part-timers are not committed because they  see\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs only as part-time jobs.  So if you ask them about\r\n\r\na  product, they will say, \"Can you please look at the  label\r\n\r\nyourself?\"   When  you go to Robinsons, they  work  a  system\r\n\r\nwhere,  because  workers stay there  longer,  and  they  have\r\n\r\nincentivised  on commissions as a whole floor,  they  have  a\r\n\r\nvested  interest.   Every time they see a customer  come  in,\r\n\r\nthey have to ensure he stays as long as possible on the floor\r\n\r\nand  not to leave the floor empty-handed.  Older workers  are\r\n\r\nmore  mature,  more  committed and more responsible  and  are\r\n\r\nbetter for this.  For many jobs in the service sector, we  do\r\n\r\nnot  really require techno-geeks or those who have  got  very\r\n\r\ngood  physical  reflexes.  They can be put to better  use  in\r\n\r\nmany sectors.  The whole certification programme is, in fact,\r\n\r\nto  help  them  to  do a better job and to provide  a  better\r\n\r\nservice.  Singaporeans are increasingly prepared to pay  more\r\n\r\nfor better services.  That is why they go to Starbucks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we have been investing in this area, we have\r\n\r\nmade  progress.  All of us would have noticed how the quality\r\n\r\nof  service of taxi-drivers and bus drivers in the  last  few\r\n\r\nyears  has  improved  dramatically.   It  did  not  come   by\r\n\r\naccident.   It came because between NTUC, the taxi companies,\r\n\r\nPSB  and  other agencies, they have been pushing it  year  by\r\n\r\nyear and so we have upgraded ourselves.  Let countries around\r\n\r\nus  take the low-end risks but we move up.  There is no point\r\n\r\nin  our  scolding  employers  or legislating  to  force  them\r\n\r\nbecause this would only pile up their costs and some of  them\r\n\r\nare already suffering. What we can do is, on the part\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof all parties, help to nudge employers and workers towards a\r\n\r\ndifferent  configuration.   In this  way,  we  build  up  our\r\n\r\nservices  sector  and build up a greater capacity  to  absorb\r\n\r\nolder workers in our economy.  We need plenty of ideas and  I\r\n\r\nwould  welcome  anyone  with any idea  from  any  quarter  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  raise  them, either to MTI  or  our  statutory\r\n\r\nboards, or to PSB, NTUC or any agencies, or to raise them  up\r\n\r\nin this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also asked about employment pass holders. For\r\n\r\nwork permit holders, we have a dependency ratio which ensures\r\n\r\nthat   the  foreign  workers,  who  are  in  Singapore,  help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  find  employment.  In many factories  now,  the\r\n\r\nthird  shift is done by foreign workers.  Let us think  about\r\n\r\nthis.   Without  foreign workers anchoring the  third  shift,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  first shift and second shift for  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nbecause  no one is going to plonk a factory in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nnot  operate  it  24 hours a day.  Without large  numbers  of\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  in  Singapore, many Singaporeans  would  be\r\n\r\nwithout  jobs.  Of course, on the shop floor, in a particular\r\n\r\noffice,  there may be a certain friction in the  sense  that,\r\n\r\n\"Look, why am I laid off?  Why is he not laid off?  Why is my\r\n\r\njob  given to someone from another country who is working for\r\n\r\nless?\"  I can understand this anguish among many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand  many of them have written to me.  But from the viewpoint\r\n\r\nof  the economy, filling in the gaps in our economy allows us\r\n\r\nto  operate  a  much more complex and sophisticated  economy,\r\n\r\ngiving us jobs which we could not otherwise have.  If we were\r\n\r\nnot a high-tech centre, and we can only be a high-tech centre\r\n\r\nif  we  have  large  numbers  of scientists  and  researchers\r\n\r\nworking  here, many technical jobs would not be available  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that we have been relatively\r\n\r\nliberal  on employment pass holders.  When we encouraged  Eli\r\n\r\nLilly to come here to set up an R&D centre for the biomedical\r\n\r\nsciences,  they  were  afraid  that  when  they  come   here,\r\n\r\nSingapore is a small city-state, the range of skills that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  need  would not be available.  Why not go to  China  or\r\n\r\nEurope where everything is available?  I said, \"Do not worry.\r\n\r\nYou come here.  If you need to bring in workers and expertise\r\n\r\nfrom other countries, we will help you.\"  And because of this\r\n\r\nassurance, they come here.  And because they come here, there\r\n\r\nwill be good jobs for Singaporeans.  Yes, at the local level,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are hurt and we must help them. But  the  macro\r\n\r\npicture  is  extremely important.  The key is to ensure  that\r\n\r\ninvestments  continue  to  flow  into  Singapore.   If   they\r\n\r\ncontinue  to flow into Singapore, we are all right.   If  EDB\r\n\r\nreports to me that the pipeline is running out, then  I  will\r\n\r\nhave to come back to this House quickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, first of\r\n\r\nall,  I  would  like  to  thank the Minister  for  Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry  for  announcing this set of measures  valued  at  a\r\n\r\ntotal of $2.2 billion.  I would like to say that I find  this\r\n\r\nset of measures very comprehensive although it was done in  a\r\n\r\nshort  period  of  time,  since his  announcement  about  the\r\n\r\nmeasures earlier this month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister a few questions, Sir.\r\n\r\nSingapore is said to be a very export-oriented economy.  Some\r\n\r\nof  our detractors have said that Singapore is a very exposed\r\n\r\neconomy.   Now, with the downturn, including even the  United\r\n\r\nStates,  Japan and our regional neighbours, we  are  possibly\r\n\r\ngoing  into  a  further downturn.  I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  that, although now we have a set of measures  worth\r\n\r\n$2.2  billion,  in  the event of a further drastic  downturn,\r\n\r\nwould he be prepared to consider further off-Budget measures.\r\n\r\nIn  this downturn, as the Chinese saying goes, we should  wei\r\n\r\nyu  chou  mou (????), which means to plan and build our  huts\r\n\r\nbefore the rain comes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the $2.2 billion measures are very meaningful, I\r\n\r\nfind  something  lacking in what the Minister  has  proposed.\r\n\r\nAlthough  he  has  announced several  measures,  particularly\r\n\r\nthose  by  MOM to help workers in skills retraining,  what  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask the Minister is whether he could  be  more\r\n\r\ngenerous in providing for capital\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrants  for  companies  in the area of equity  human  capital\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   This is the area where we can build  our  only\r\n\r\nresource,  which is the human capital.  Therefore, could  the\r\n\r\nGovernment consider giving more grants in helping  SMEs  when\r\n\r\nthey  want  to  embark on R&D programmes  involving,  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister   has   stated,  information  technology,   software\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  communications  and  other  areas  in  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy?   I  think  to  build up the human  capital  and  to\r\n\r\nprepare ourselves for this new economy is very important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also mentioned about the possibilities\r\n\r\nof China.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Leong, could I ask you to confine\r\n\r\nyourself to asking questions?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Yes, Sir. Could I ask the Minister,\r\n\r\nsince he mentioned that China is a bright spot, what are  the\r\n\r\nplans  that  his Ministry has in helping local  companies  to\r\n\r\nstrongly  link  up  with China, in particular,  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nbusiness missions and training missions?  How do we  link  up\r\n\r\nwith businesses in China so that we could at least latch onto\r\n\r\nChina,  which is a growth area, despite the downturn  in  the\r\n\r\nother economies?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, a point on CPF cuts. I am also pleased to\r\n\r\nhear  the Minister mentioning about the holding back  of  the\r\n\r\nrestoration of the 4% CPF cut until a review in the middle of\r\n\r\nnext year.  This is very comforting for the local businesses.\r\n\r\nI  also agree with the Minister that there is no need for any\r\n\r\ndrastic CPF cut now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Leong, may I remind you that for\r\n\r\nMinisterial Statements, you can only ask questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> I would like to ask the Minister, in\r\n\r\nspite  of  the confidence that he has instilled by mentioning\r\n\r\nthat  there  will  be  no further cuts in  the  CPF  for  the\r\n\r\nbusiness sector, whether he is aware that there is a need for\r\n\r\nmore  cost-cutting measures for the business  sector  because\r\n\r\noperating cost and business cost are, in fact, a major factor\r\n\r\nin  retaining their competitiveness.  Could the  Minister  be\r\n\r\nmore generous again in looking at various\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  rates  and fees that can be  cut  so  that  these\r\n\r\nbusinesses   will  be  able  to  enjoy  a  more   competitive\r\n\r\nenvironment  because business cost is a factor  for  them  to\r\n\r\nremain competitive?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to ask the Minister about the\r\n\r\nextension  of property tax rebate.  He did mention  about  an\r\n\r\nextension   of   property  tax  rebate  for  commercial   and\r\n\r\nindustrial  properties.  My question is:  why is this  rebate\r\n\r\nnot also extended to the residential sector as well?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, inevitably, this package\r\n\r\nwill  be compared to the $10.5 billion package which  we  had\r\n\r\nthe  last time.  Let us go back to the $10.5 billion  package\r\n\r\nand what it consisted of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the $10.5 billion, $7.5 billion consisted of CPF and\r\n\r\nNWC  deductions.   In  other  words,  most  of  that  package\r\n\r\nconsisted  of a deep wage cut across the board in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nDo we need to do that this time round?  So far, the necessity\r\n\r\nis  not  obvious. Whatever we do, we cannot give work to  the\r\n\r\nwafer  fabs  or  to  the  disk-drive  factories  or  to   the\r\n\r\npetrochemical  island,  or  to our pharmaceutical  companies.\r\n\r\nThe  reason why business is down is not because of high  wage\r\n\r\ncost,  but  because the global market is  down.   If  we  cut\r\n\r\nwages,  I  think that may not be a wise thing to do,  because\r\n\r\nthere is no need to.  In fact, the reason why we have to  cut\r\n\r\nwages  so  deeply  the  last  time  round  was  because   the\r\n\r\ncurrencies  around us depreciated by about 40-50% while  ours\r\n\r\ndepreciated by  only 15-20%.  So, suddenly, we had to face  a\r\n\r\nmargin  of  20-25% and therefore we took the  15%  wage  cut.\r\n\r\nThis  time  round, when you look at our relative unit  labour\r\n\r\ncost,  it is still competitive.  So because there is no  need\r\n\r\nto  do  a major wage cut this time round, the present package\r\n\r\nshould  be  sufficient.  But having said that, I should  also\r\n\r\nsay  that if things get worse in the future, then we may have\r\n\r\nto  do  more and we will consider all possibilities.   I  can\r\n\r\nunderstand the reluctance  by all of us, by the unionists, by\r\n\r\nSingaporeans generally, to resort lightly to a CPF reduction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the exposure of Singapore to the global economy, what\r\n\r\nis the alternative?  Ever since we became independent, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknew that our own domestic economy was too small.  If we rely\r\n\r\nonly  on the regional economy,  I think we will be much worse\r\n\r\noff.  In fact, it was because we did not rely on the regional\r\n\r\neconomy in the last crisis that we went through it reasonably\r\n\r\nwell.   So  we  try  to  buffer  ourselves.   We  have  close\r\n\r\noutriggers  which  are grounded in ASEAN.   We  have  further\r\n\r\noutriggers  which  reach out to Japan,  Europe  and  America.\r\n\r\nBut,  unfortunately, when the flows everywhere are down, then\r\n\r\nwe  are  down.   It  cannot be helped.  Is this  a  criticism\r\n\r\nagainst our economic strategy to globalise our economy?   Not\r\n\r\nat  all.   In fact, globalisation is the best diversification\r\n\r\nthat we can have for our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong asked about what else we should do on China. I\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier that we have good links with China which we\r\n\r\nshould  build  on.   Recently, the  Senior  Minister  was  in\r\n\r\nSuzhou.   President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier  Li  Lanqing\r\n\r\nwere  there  for the ceremony to mark the conclusion  of  the\r\n\r\nfirst phase and the opening of subsequent phases.  When I was\r\n\r\nin  Shanghai for the APEC meeting, at a cocktail, one Chinese\r\n\r\nVice  Minister  came  up to me and said,  \"You  know,  Suzhou\r\n\r\nattracted more investments this year than Shanghai.\"  I could\r\n\r\nnot  believe  my  ears  -  Suzhou had more  investments  than\r\n\r\nShanghai!   Later on, when I went to Suzhou,  they  confirmed\r\n\r\nit.   Think  about it.  All of us know about  Shanghai.   Few\r\n\r\npeople realise that Suzhou has done so well, and the flagship\r\n\r\nof  Suzhou  is our industrial park.  So if you read  internal\r\n\r\nChinese  literature, Singapore's standing in  China  is  very\r\n\r\nhigh.  Our passport is held in high regard.  We are known  to\r\n\r\nbe  trusted.  So we should build upon this.  The trouble  is,\r\n\r\nbecause the situation in China is changing so fast, for  many\r\n\r\nof us, in our minds, we have not pressed the \"Refresh\" button\r\n\r\non China.  And for China, you must press the \"Refresh\" button\r\n\r\nevery  six  months  to  make sure that you  have  an  updated\r\n\r\npicture.  With the Olympic Games and with the opening of  the\r\n\r\nwestern region, there will be many new possibilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In MTI now, we are conducting a major review of our\r\n\r\nChina  policy,  and we are bringing in our  Ministries.   One\r\n\r\nidea, which we are working seriously on, is this. We are  now\r\n\r\nsending   many of our scholars to the West.  When  they  come\r\n\r\nback,  we  will send them for a one-year bond-free attachment\r\n\r\nto  China.  They will be fully paid, they do a job, they  get\r\n\r\nattached  either to a company or an institute, improve  their\r\n\r\nMandarin,  know  what  China is like at the  basement  level,\r\n\r\nbuild  up deep knowledge in MTI and all the statutory boards.\r\n\r\nThen  after a few years, we have a few hundred such officers,\r\n\r\nand  I  think we should extend it to the other Ministries  as\r\n\r\nwell,  we  will  build up a deep inside knowledge  of  China.\r\n\r\nThen  whatever  happens there, we will know how  to  position\r\n\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is a big market. I was talking to David Abel, my\r\n\r\ncounterpart in Myanmar.  When I was in Kunming, I ate turtles\r\n\r\nwhich were imported from Myanmar.  He said, \"Ah, turtles,  we\r\n\r\nexport  lots  to Yunnan.\"  But Yunnan has been  importing  so\r\n\r\nmany  snakes, especially the poisonous variety, from  Myanmar\r\n\r\nthat  the  rat problem in Myanmar is getting out of  control.\r\n\r\nSo  he told the Chinese, \"Look, can you please slow down your\r\n\r\neating of Myanmar snakes?\"  The Chinese market  will open all\r\n\r\nkinds  of possibilities, and we must get into it early,  know\r\n\r\nwhat  is  happening,  position ourselves,  make  use  of  the\r\n\r\nstrengths and the assets that we have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also asked whether we will provide grants for\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  upgrade human resources, R&D and  so  on.   In\r\n\r\nfact, we are doing a lot  -  EDB, PSB, NSTB.  We have a whole\r\n\r\nrange which is available.  Recently, I announced on behalf of\r\n\r\nNSTB a post-graduate programme,  $500 million for five years,\r\n\r\nto  promote  post-graduate  training  so  that  we  have  the\r\n\r\nknowledge workers to power the knowledge economy.  And if  Mr\r\n\r\nLeong  has any particular ideas which are additional to  what\r\n\r\nwe already have, MTI will be very happy to hear of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope I have answered all his questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about property tax on residential\r\n\r\nproperties?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> I am sorry. Let me read out\r\n\r\nthe  section to Members again.  This was carefully vetted  by\r\n\r\nthe  Finance Minister.  It says, \"The MOF has now decided  to\r\n\r\nextend  the  25%  property  tax  rebate  for  commercial  and\r\n\r\nindustrial properties for a year from 1st July this  year  to\r\n\r\n30th  June  next year, . and the effective rate  during  this\r\n\r\nperiod would thus be 7.5% as compared with 9% before this.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister  whether his Ministry  might  have  under-estimated the severity of the recession facing us this  time.\r\n\r\nOf course, if we look at Chairman Greenspan's estimate, he is\r\n\r\ncautiously  optimistic.  But the US economy is  a  very  wide\r\n\r\neconomy,  unlike the Singapore economy which is really  based\r\n\r\non  IT  and high-tech.  If the Minister has studied the order\r\n\r\nbook versus built ratio, for many of the high-tech companies,\r\n\r\nthis  is  one of the worst recessions in their history.   And\r\n\r\nwhen  I  was coming to Parliament today, I  heard on the  BBC\r\n\r\nthat ABB of Sweden has cut 8,000 workers.  This has just been\r\n\r\nannounced  and is based on this order-book-built  ratio.   My\r\n\r\nwife  and I work for US multi-national companies and both  of\r\n\r\nthese companies have complete capital freeze for the next six\r\n\r\nmonths.   This  means it is zero.  Both these big  US  multi-national  companies are not spending any dollars  on  capital\r\n\r\nequipment.    I  think, to me, the recession  facing  us,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  in  the  high-tech sector, is  quite  severe.  I\r\n\r\nthought  perhaps  in the package announced by  the  Minister,\r\n\r\nthere  might be an under-estimation  of the severity  of  the\r\n\r\nchallenges facing us.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  assure  Dr  Wang  that we are not  making  light  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic situation at all.  In fact, Business Times two weeks\r\n\r\nago printed an analysis by Stephen Roach from Morgan Stanley.\r\n\r\nHe  is sometimes called the \"Resident Bear\" in the investment\r\n\r\ncommunity.  He wrote a carefully reasoned piece that in  fact\r\n\r\nthe  whole  world has already entered into a  recession.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, among private analysts, there is a range of views and\r\n\r\nhe represents one end of it.  We cannot be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsure.   We read Greenspan very carefully and he said that  he\r\n\r\nis  beginning to see \"the market structuring a bottom.\"  They\r\n\r\nare  very carefully chosen words.  He is beginning to see the\r\n\r\nmarket structuring a bottom.  In other words, he has not  yet\r\n\r\nseen a bottom, but maybe there is a bottom forming.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, the National Economic Advisor, Larry\r\n\r\nLindsey,  said that the US economy is at a virtual standstill\r\n\r\nbut  with the tax cut and  the interest cut, next year  there\r\n\r\nshould  be growth.  Paul O'Neil, US Treasurer, declares  that\r\n\r\nhe  is  an  optimist, and next year it will be at  least  3%.\r\n\r\nAmong  Federal  Reserve Governors, they said US  growth  this\r\n\r\nyear  will be between 1.25% and 2%.  This means that for  the\r\n\r\nsecond  half  they expect maybe 1-2% growth.   Therefore,  an\r\n\r\nupturn  at the end of the year.  Of course, you may say  that\r\n\r\nthese being officials, they have got to err on the optimistic\r\n\r\nside  in order not to talk down the market.  But, at the same\r\n\r\ntime, these are very serious people with access to reams  and\r\n\r\nreams  of  comprehensive data.  So I do not think  we  should\r\n\r\nlightly second guess them.  What we have done is this.  Look,\r\n\r\nyes,  on the scale between optimism and pessimism, we are  on\r\n\r\nthe   pessimistic   side.   But  we  cannot   be   completely\r\n\r\npessimistic  at  this point in time.  If we use  up  all  our\r\n\r\nammunition  now, there will be little left  later.   So  hold\r\n\r\nback the 155s, hold back the F16 strikes, but do all that  is\r\n\r\nnecessary,  given the situation now.  If we need to  do  more\r\n\r\nlater, if you are right in your gloomy prognostication,  then\r\n\r\nwe will do more.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister that in the light\r\n\r\nthat the manufacturing sector is employing a large number  of\r\n\r\nmanpower,  what  steps  are being  taken  to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nhollowing  out  effects of the manufacturing sector,  because\r\n\r\nthis  has long-term implications for our manpower deployment?\r\n\r\nSecond, I want to know that if the downturn gets worse,  what\r\n\r\nplans  will be put in place to reduce the livelihood problems\r\n\r\nof  workers  affected by prolonged unemployment.  Third,  why\r\n\r\ncan  we  not be more generous in our training allowance?

The mood is grey.  Hordes  of  Taiwanese\r\n\r\ncompanies  have  been shifting operations  to  the  mainland.\r\n\r\nYears  ago,  George Perot talked about a great hissing  sound\r\n\r\nbecause  of NAFTA.  I think Taiwan is hearing a great hissing\r\n\r\nsound now from mainland China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We anticipated this. We have been telling our people\r\n\r\nthat  the  only way for us to earn high wages is to  keep  on\r\n\r\nupgrading,  which  means going up the  value  chain,  product\r\n\r\ndesign, value adding services, knowledge intensity, R&D, high-tech.  Two months ago, I went to Delphi.  Delphi is the  auto\r\n\r\nelectronic spinoff from General Motors.   They used  to  make\r\n\r\ncar  radios.  But after a while, they decided that car radios\r\n\r\nwere  not  a product they were good at, because we  were  too\r\n\r\nexpensive here in Singapore and there were tariff barriers to\r\n\r\nsurmount.   But  they have been thriving and  still  growing.\r\n\r\nMaking  what?   They  now make small electronic  sensors  for\r\n\r\nmotorcar air bags.  You may use this sensor only once  in  10\r\n\r\nyears  and  when you need it, it had better work.  Otherwise,\r\n\r\nyou  may  die.   So  when it comes to very high  value  added\r\n\r\nproducts,  we are trusted, we are reliable, we  are  able  to\r\n\r\ncreate  a system discipline.  They make the little electronic\r\n\r\ncomponents  that  are now in every spark  plug.   I  did  not\r\n\r\nrealise this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in engineering school years ago, for me, a\r\n\r\nspark plug was just a physical device and if the gap was  too\r\n\r\nbig,  you just hammered it to the right gap, and it was okay.\r\n\r\nNow you open the car, you cannot tinker with your carburetor,\r\n\r\nyour  spark  plug,  because they are all  electronic.

You\r\n\r\nneed  people,  you  need  a certain discipline,  you  need  a\r\n\r\nculture of learning, of upgrading and group effort.  So  this\r\n\r\nis the way we are going to solve the hollowing out problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo also asked:</b> can we do more for the livelihood\r\n\r\nof  the  unemployed?  We are beginning to  see  increases  in\r\n\r\nunemployment.  It is not yet a serious problem.  If  we  need\r\n\r\nto  provide  direct income support, should  the  retrenchment\r\n\r\nsituation  become much worse, I believe we will  do  so.   We\r\n\r\nhave  many  safety  nets in place at the national  level,  by\r\n\r\ncivic  organisations and grassroots organisations.   Children\r\n\r\nwill   always   be  looked  after.   There  are  scholarships\r\n\r\navailable, book grants available.  We make sure that there is\r\n\r\na  safety net should things get worse for everyone.  That  is\r\n\r\nthe  Government's commitment to the people of Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nwe have the resources to do it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we should increase allowances, well, these\r\n\r\nare  allowances and they are not a replacement for  salaries.\r\n\r\nOur fear is while doing all these things, we must not provide\r\n\r\na  disguised dole.  Someone asked earlier whether  we  should\r\n\r\nnot  have an unemployment insurance for more educated workers\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  It starts with the best of intentions, but it\r\n\r\nhas   led  to  long-term  structural  unemployment  in   many\r\n\r\ncountries.   Because a point comes when it is not worth  your\r\n\r\nwhile   to  work,  and  it  is  better  to  declare  yourself\r\n\r\nunemployed  or under-employed and collect something.   So  we\r\n\r\nare  very  mindful of that.  But if we have got  to  do  more\r\n\r\nlater, we will consider whether some adjustments can be made.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, my question to the Minister is\r\n\r\non  the  issue  of reading of the economy,  as  Dr  Wang  has\r\n\r\nbrought up.  There seems to be at least a six-month,  if  not\r\n\r\nlonger,  lag  in the way that the Government is  reading  the\r\n\r\neconomy as compared to how the rest of the private sector  is\r\n\r\nreading it, and this has been shown a number of times in  the\r\n\r\npast  few  years.  In fact, it was just a month ago when  the\r\n\r\nMinister  mentioned  that there was no  need  for  off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures, and here we are - the off-Budget measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my question to the Minister is: are the leading\r\n\r\nindicators that we are using to read the economy good  enough\r\n\r\nthis  time  round, given the rate at which  the  economy  has\r\n\r\ndropped from +10% to -10%, which is a 20% swing?  So my  fear\r\n\r\nis  that we may not be reading it well enough.  We also heard\r\n\r\nthe  Minister mentioning a recovery by the end of this  year,\r\n\r\nand  I  think  this  is far from what many other  people  are\r\n\r\nsaying  about a recovery in the second half of next  year  or\r\n\r\neven  the  end of next year.  So my fear is: are  we  through\r\n\r\nthese  measures administering the wrong medicine at the wrong\r\n\r\ntime?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third issue on the China strategy, while I know\r\n\r\nthat  the Ministry is trying to derive a China strategy  that\r\n\r\nmay  be  a  long-term strategy, in my opinion, with impending\r\n\r\nWTO, with Olympic games coming to China in 2008, in the short\r\n\r\nterm  there are tremendous opportunities, especially  in  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure area.  Could we, maybe through a package  deal\r\n\r\nof  investments between SMEs and GLCs, quickly make  our  way\r\n\r\ninto China to see whether we can tap on some of the near-term\r\n\r\nopportunities that are available?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final question is that while we are worried about the\r\n\r\nfire-fighting that is going on, about the drop in economy, we\r\n\r\nshould not lose sight of the long-term gains that we can  get\r\n\r\nin a knowledge economy, and many of us have asked this before\r\n\r\nbut  we  have  not seen any contribution.  I am  asking  this\r\n\r\nquestion  on  how  we  can help entrepreneurs  and  start-ups\r\n\r\nsurvive, and even in a worse situation when all the financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions, including the VCs whom the Government had\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunded  in  the last few years, are being very  reluctant  to\r\n\r\nactually  pump in any money into start-ups and  new  ventures\r\n\r\neven  though  there  may  be ideas and  they  may  be  viable\r\n\r\ncompanies.  So the idea of a lifeline fund, and I believe the\r\n\r\nMinister knows what I am talking about.  I hope that while we\r\n\r\nmay  fire  fight, let us see whether we can do something  for\r\n\r\nthe long term through policies like encouraging start-ups and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  thank  Mr  Inderjit  Singh for his helpful  comments  and\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We construct a number of scenarios. One of them is the\r\n\r\none  which Stephen Roach proposed: It is as bleak and as dark\r\n\r\nas  we  can  make  it.  Even if it comes  to  that,  we  will\r\n\r\nsurvive,  and  we  will get out of it,  and  we  will  emerge\r\n\r\nstronger.  But should some other scenarios eventuate, then it\r\n\r\nis  important that in administering the medicine, we  do  not\r\n\r\noverdo it, because there is a price to be paid when we  over-medicate.   It  is a question of balance.  And what  we  have\r\n\r\ndone  is, at this point in time, given the situation,  we  do\r\n\r\nthis  first.   If  we  do  not  have  to  do  more,  that  is\r\n\r\nmarvellous.  If we have to do more, we will do more.  That is\r\n\r\nthe  position that we are taking.  So there is no attempt  to\r\n\r\ngloss over the current difficulties.  In fact, the assessment\r\n\r\nis a very realistic one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, I spoke to the Mexican Economic Minister\r\n\r\nwho is on a one-day visit here.  He was quite worried.  He is\r\n\r\n90% dependent on the US economy for exports, and one-third of\r\n\r\nthe  Mexican  GNP is derived from the US.  So  he  feels  the\r\n\r\nchill  immediately.  We were exchanging notes and he said  he\r\n\r\nwas  going to the US after that and he had arranged a  series\r\n\r\nof calls with economic agencies there in order to get a first-hand feel of the situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important leading indicator is not the one that\r\n\r\nwe   construct  for  Singapore.   It  is  the  one  that   is\r\n\r\nconstructed for the US economy, and that leading indicator in\r\n\r\nthe last few months had tended a little upwards, which is why\r\n\r\nwe  are not sure whether that doomsday scenario will in  fact\r\n\r\neventuate.  We will wait and see.  We\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhope  that our pessimism is unfounded.  But if it is founded,\r\n\r\nthen  we  will  do more.  That is the position  that  we  are\r\n\r\ntaking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On China, on the possibility of SMEs and GLCs working\r\n\r\ntogether, we should encourage it but we should not force  it.\r\n\r\nEvery  time we have a trade delegation going to China, and  I\r\n\r\nwill  be  leading one to the western region  next  month,  we\r\n\r\nbring   along  GLCs  and  SMEs  together,  including   Muslim\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  this time, because some of them  will  find  the\r\n\r\nMuslim market in China of interest to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to helping start-up companies, particularly in high-tech, with a lifeline, as I have explained to Mr Singh\r\n\r\nearlier, we are doing it but not as a handout, and it will be\r\n\r\ndisastrous for our own reputation if we just hand  out  money\r\n\r\nto  people  who  cannot  be saved.   But  if  they  are  good\r\n\r\ninvestments,  we  are open to the possibilities.   We  remain\r\n\r\ncommitted to TIF.  In fact, we will be increasing the quantum\r\n\r\nof TIF.  We maintain our links to all the top venture capital\r\n\r\nfunds  in  Silicon Valley and other parts of the world.   And\r\n\r\nour  commitment  to  the  promotion of  technopreneurship  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is a long-term one, and the dot-com crash  has  not\r\n\r\nreduced our enthusiasm for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nso  far  we  have been highlighting the IT and  manufacturing\r\n\r\ndownturn.  The building construction has been going through a\r\n\r\ndownturn  since  the  last  Asian crisis.   The  very  recent\r\n\r\nrecession  is more or less a final knockout blow.  Would  the\r\n\r\nMinister  consider  accelerating some of the  infrastructural\r\n\r\nprojects  and  perhaps  some  of  the  Government's  building\r\n\r\nprogrammes, so that at least they can provide a little bit of\r\n\r\nsmelling  salt to revive this poor chap who has been  knocked\r\n\r\nout?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the real\r\n\r\nestate  developers have been in communication  with  MTI.   I\r\n\r\nhave  met  a number of them personally to hear their concerns\r\n\r\nand  their views of the real estate market in Singapore.   It\r\n\r\nis a very important part of the domestic economy.  It is one\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarket  which  we  have some control over and  therefore  one\r\n\r\nwhich  we should watch carefully the development of.  We  are\r\n\r\naccelerating  infrastructural projects.  I  mentioned  Jurong\r\n\r\nIsland,   polytechnics  and  universities,  sewerage   works,\r\n\r\ndrainage,  roads, tunnels, and so on.  If we over-accelerate,\r\n\r\nwe  may end up doing things which are unnecessary and wasting\r\n\r\nmoney.  Worse, we may do things  in a rush we should not have\r\n\r\ndone.   So  this  acceleration package which I  talked  about\r\n\r\nearlier  is the best that we can do at this stage, given  the\r\n\r\namount of time that we have.  In the coming months, if  there\r\n\r\nare  other  possibilities of bringing forward infrastructural\r\n\r\nprojects, we will certainly consider doing those things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the property market, it will find its own balance.\r\n\r\nIt  is not as if transactions have stopped.  But at the right\r\n\r\nprices,  transactions continue.  And from time to  time,  you\r\n\r\nhear  of  projects  which are reasonably priced  which  clear\r\n\r\nreasonably  well.   So I listened to real  estate  developers\r\n\r\nvery carefully, but also know where they are coming from, and\r\n\r\nfrom  MTI's  perspective, our responsibility is not  just  to\r\n\r\nthem but also to home buyers and to Singaporeans generally.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfirst, I would agree with the Minister's approach that  while\r\n\r\nlooking at the difficulties that are presently before us,  we\r\n\r\nshould not lose sight that the middle and long-term prospects\r\n\r\nare  not bleak but relatively good.  And in preparing for it,\r\n\r\nI  think  we should also look at some of the lessons that  we\r\n\r\nhave  learned from the last Asian currency crisis.   Most  of\r\n\r\nthe problems then had been with the CPF and wage cuts and  we\r\n\r\nare  helping workers to adjust.  I am quite enlightened about\r\n\r\nGovernment  still continuing with recruitment.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  ask  whether  the  Government  will  also  recruit  older\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is on the wage levels which we are\r\n\r\ntalking about, especially with the lower income workers.  You\r\n\r\ncan say that there will be pressures to bring wages down, but\r\n\r\nthere  is also a problem of having, as Singaporeans,  certain\r\n\r\nliving\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstandards and our own cost of living to maintain, and  living\r\n\r\nstandards  have  been  down.  If we  allow  freely  the  wage\r\n\r\npressures  to  go  down, it would mean  lowering  our  living\r\n\r\nstandards which is not good for all Singaporeans.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nhow are we going to do that and build social cohesion?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other element is that during the economic crisis ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Thomas, are you making a speech?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> No, I am asking questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Ask your questions now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> One is whether Government will\r\n\r\nrecruit;  two  is  how do we prevent wages for  lower  income\r\n\r\ndropping too low such that they cannot maintain their  living\r\n\r\nstandards?   And  the third question is this.   In  the  last\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis, we heard about executives and  people  who,\r\n\r\ninstead of being retrenched, were terminated and they  had  a\r\n\r\nlot of hardship because they lost their jobs and they had  no\r\n\r\nretrenchment benefit, and there was some abuse of the system.\r\n\r\nWhat would the Government do about that?  The other point  is\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Thomas, can you be direct and ask your\r\n\r\nquestion?  Because we have a lot of other Members waiting  to\r\n\r\nask their questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do you have any more questions?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> One more. The last one is on the\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar.  During this crisis we  have  a  weakening\r\n\r\nSingapore dollar.  The CPF has already been cut.  How  do  we\r\n\r\nprotect the value of the CPF?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the\r\n\r\nemployment  of  older workers, I assure Mr  Thomas  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  not  be a laggard in  this  area.   On  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of social cohesion at a time like this,  I  think\r\n\r\nmany of us were very appreciative of NTUC's announcement\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyesterday to lower prices for low income groups and  to  help\r\n\r\nchildren of retrenched workers.  I think that package touched\r\n\r\na  lot  of people.  And, where we can, all of us, in our  own\r\n\r\nway,  should  help.  In this way, the crisis  bonds  us  more\r\n\r\nclosely  together and grassroots here will  play  a  critical\r\n\r\nrole.   The  role played by the NTUC in the restructuring  of\r\n\r\nSingapore economy is an enormously important one.  There  are\r\n\r\nmany things that we take for granted in Singapore which other\r\n\r\ncountries  cannot  do,  not because  they  do  not  have  the\r\n\r\nknowledge, but because they face opposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago, when a Japanese Minister visited us,\r\n\r\nhe  asked  to visit PSA, and he wants PSA to take a stake  in\r\n\r\none of the Japanese ports.  And he lamented that, when he was\r\n\r\na young man, Yokohama was one of the world's great ports, but\r\n\r\nnow  Singapore  and Hong Kong have surged  so  far  ahead  of\r\n\r\nYokohama.   He wants to turn things around.  He  cannot,  not\r\n\r\nbecause  the Japanese do not have the knowledge, but  because\r\n\r\nthe unions block change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways to adjust to change. One, you put\r\n\r\nfriction,  slow it down so that the pain is  less.   But  the\r\n\r\nresult  is  when  the change comes, the  pain  will  be  much\r\n\r\ngreater.   Or  you say, \"OK, these are the hot spots.   Let's\r\n\r\nlubricate.   Let's be a bit more tolerant, send  workers  for\r\n\r\ntraining, give allowances, help the unemployed.\"  That is our\r\n\r\nway.   And we have been able to achieve this only because  in\r\n\r\nmany  of  the programmes which we announced earlier, we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  able to work very closely with the NTUC.  So the  NTUC,\r\n\r\nin  terms  of attracting investments to Singapore, is  really\r\n\r\none  of  our  most important weapons, and the  point  of  our\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion is a very important one.  And  if  there  is\r\n\r\nabuse  by employers in the way they treat workers or retrench\r\n\r\nworkers,  I say, \"We come down like a ton of bricks  on  them\r\n\r\nbecause  there is a social contract.\"  These are  the  rules.\r\n\r\nWe  all work together because these rules apply to all of us.\r\n\r\nIf  you are not required to, then we bite our tongue and say,\r\n\r\n\"Yes,  that  is  your prerogative.\"  But if  you  breach  the\r\n\r\nrules, then I say, \"MOM will go after them.\"  And\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif we know of such cases, I say, \"Let's blow the whistle.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the value of the Singapore dollar, we manage the\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar  in  order to preserve  the  value  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrency.   We do not fool around with it in order  to  alter\r\n\r\nwage level.  And that is the reason why we have been able  to\r\n\r\nmaintain the value of the CPF, and that is a policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  questions  in  three  areas.   First,  the  overall\r\n\r\nstrategy.  I agree that globalisation is the only way to  go.\r\n\r\nBut  does the Minister think our economy is as robust  as  it\r\n\r\nshould be?   In 1998, we seemed to be one of the last one  to\r\n\r\nenter  the recession and now we seem to be one of the  first.\r\n\r\nIs that a misperception?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, pump priming. With these measures, will the\r\n\r\nGovernment  be  in  deficit?   And  if  it  is  going  to  be\r\n\r\nprojecting a deficit, will it actually achieve one?  Because,\r\n\r\nagain,  in the past, we projected a deficit, but we  did  not\r\n\r\nachieve it.  Perhaps, we under spent.  In respect of the pump\r\n\r\npriming  of  infrastructure projects, I agree  it  is  not  a\r\n\r\nquestion of quantum, but actually achieving it.  And in  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  the role of the PWD, which we talked about  earlier\r\n\r\nin  this  House,  has  to  be  really  looked  at,  with  the\r\n\r\nmoratorium of five years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area is the Government's help for the\r\n\r\nindividuals.   Sir,  I would like to ask the  Minister  again\r\n\r\nabout the training allowance brought up by my colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMP  for  Tanjong Pagar GRC Dr Vasoo.  If this is the training\r\n\r\nallowance  for  programmes which we  believe   truly  provide\r\n\r\ntraining,  why does the Minister believe that it might  be  a\r\n\r\n\"disguised dole\" or is in danger of being so?  And if it is a\r\n\r\ntrue  training  programme, why should our allowance  be  $600\r\n\r\nwhich  is  not  a  living  wage?   And  in  connection   with\r\n\r\nindividuals again, the question of keeping enough savings  in\r\n\r\nthe CPF and keeping costs down low for the company to survive\r\n\r\nis very real.  Can I then ask the Minister, if we do generate\r\n\r\nbudget surpluses, whether\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe anticipate a larger top-up in order to meet the shortfall?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much as I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  answer many of Mr Simon Tay's  questions,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  do so because they are really the prerogative of  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister.   You know it is very easy  to  achieve  a\r\n\r\nbudget  deficit.  In most countries, they achieve it  without\r\n\r\ndifficulty.   And  I do not think we should  set  that  as  a\r\n\r\ntarget at all.  If we need to spend on a particular programme\r\n\r\nbecause we are in difficulty, if it improves our capacity, we\r\n\r\nwill do so, but not in order to spend money for its own sake.\r\n\r\nI  think  that will be a disaster.  The reason  why  we  have\r\n\r\nsurvived  previous crises and emerged stronger from  each  of\r\n\r\nthem  is  because  we have been disciplined,  and  we  should\r\n\r\ncontinue to be so.  And if we do not make major mistakes this\r\n\r\ntime  round,  we will not emerge worse off.  I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  not  to  lose  sight of  the  importance  of  that\r\n\r\ndisciplined response to problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked whether the allowance can become a\r\n\r\ndole  and,  if it is not a dole, why can it not be increased.\r\n\r\nBut  one  shades off into the other.  And if you put yourself\r\n\r\ninto  the  mind  of the individual, beyond a point,  he  will\r\n\r\nattend  any course because it pays him well.  So we have  got\r\n\r\nto  be  mindful.  There is a trade-off.  There is an  optimal\r\n\r\npoint to be struck and we should strike it carefully, and not\r\n\r\nblithely take the position that the more the better.  It need\r\n\r\nnot  be.   It can lead to a lot of other problems, maybe  not\r\n\r\nfor the individual himself, but for other people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not think the Minister\r\n\r\nhas   answered  my  questions  on  the  CPF  top-up  and  the\r\n\r\nrobustness of the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> On direct income support, as I\r\n\r\nsaid  earlier,  if we need to do more, because of  widespread\r\n\r\nunemployment,  we  will  do so.

And that is one reason why,\r\n\r\nwhen  negotiating  all these free trade agreements,  we  make\r\n\r\nsure  that we have broadband economic connectivity  with  all\r\n\r\nparts  of  the  world.  What is unfortunate is that  all  the\r\n\r\nplanets are now in the wrong alignment simultaneously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do a regression analysis of the Singapore economy\r\n\r\nwith the key variables, although the variables are connected,\r\n\r\nthese  three  variables stand out  -   the  US  economy,  the\r\n\r\nsemiconductor cycle, Malaysia and Indonesia.  The US  economy\r\n\r\nis  down,  semiconductor is down, Malaysia and Indonesia  are\r\n\r\nnot  in the best position.  Maybe, and this is a prayer, with\r\n\r\nthe  opening  of  a new chapter in Indonesia under  President\r\n\r\nMegawati, one planet has moved out of this misalignment.   We\r\n\r\nhad  a  meeting  in  MTI yesterday, we are  quietly  hopeful.\r\n\r\nIndonesia is a major trading partner of Singapore.  It brings\r\n\r\nopportunities to many little businessmen all over the island.\r\n\r\nIf  Indonesia can restore political stability, the rupiah, as\r\n\r\nit  is,  makes  Indonesia highly competitive  even  vis-a-vis\r\n\r\nChina.  And if they can establish free trade zones in various\r\n\r\nparts  of the archipelago and create conditions which  assure\r\n\r\nbusinessmen of stability, I think they can take off.   And  I\r\n\r\nwas  cheered  that the US, the EU, Japan, the IMF,  have  all\r\n\r\ncome  up  with  strong  statements in  support  of  President\r\n\r\nMegawati.   We would do our part, but we are small.   We  can\r\n\r\nonly  play  a catalytic role.

I would therefore like to ask the Minister,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  if  there  is  a need to revisit  the  strategy  of\r\n\r\nbuilding the economy on the twin pillars of manufacturing and\r\n\r\nservices,  and,  secondly,  what really  is  our  ability  to\r\n\r\ndiversify away from the huge reliance on electronics.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we continue\r\n\r\nto  hold strongly the view that we must keep manufacturing as\r\n\r\nan   important  part  of  our  economy  and  to   have   both\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and services as twin engines of our growth.  In\r\n\r\nthe  last  economic crisis, without manufacturing,  we  would\r\n\r\nhave  been in deep trouble.  This time round, both are  down.\r\n\r\nNext  time round, it may be the other way.  So it is hard  to\r\n\r\nsay.    The   fact   that  we  have  both,  gives   us   more\r\n\r\ndiversification.  But, of course, the world is  changing,  IT\r\n\r\nis  changing  the nature of industry.  Within  manufacturing,\r\n\r\nwithin electronics itself, we have to diversify and move into\r\n\r\nmore knowledge-intensive activities the best way we can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is one reason why we are making very major\r\n\r\ninvestments in the bio-medical sciences.  It will  take  many\r\n\r\nyears before that sector bears fruit but, if we do not do the\r\n\r\nwork  now,  there will be no harvest later.  Our hope  is  to\r\n\r\nmake  that  the fourth pillar of manufacturing in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nafter electronics, engineering and petrochemicals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhilst I agree with the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napproach   taken  by  the  Government,  especially   when   I\r\n\r\npersonally  think that the economy may well  recover  in  the\r\n\r\nsecond  half  of next year, I would like to ask the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether he could take steps to rectify the situation  on  the\r\n\r\nground, of which I am very deeply concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you could bear with me, I would like to use an\r\n\r\nexample to illustrate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can you get directly to your question?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Yes, Sir.

Just only about three  months\r\n\r\nago,  we thought the economy was going to expand quite nicely\r\n\r\nthis  year.  The question I want to ask the Minister is:  how\r\n\r\nis  it  that  our econometric model can be off  the  mark  so\r\n\r\nquickly?  Is it a model that we can use, for example, to take\r\n\r\neconomic  decisions on what is going to happen  further  down\r\n\r\nthe road?  If not, are we just going to base our decisions on\r\n\r\nUS leading indicators, like Mexico?  In other words, how good\r\n\r\nis our forecasting?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to ask the Minister is: despite\r\n\r\nthe   bright   spot  of  China  entering  the   World   Trade\r\n\r\nOrganisation,  there  is concern among the  business  circle,\r\n\r\nthose  I talk to, that getting the Olympic Games to be staged\r\n\r\nin  Beijing  is  likely  to soak up  or  suck  in  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ninvestments   away  from  Asia.   What  is   the   Minister's\r\n\r\nassessment of this, Sir?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the first\r\n\r\npoint  about the accuracy of econometric modelling, the model\r\n\r\nis  only as good as we understand the world and we must  have\r\n\r\ngood  inputs.  Globalisation has reduced inventory cycles  so\r\n\r\nthat  when  there  is a shock in one part of  the  world,  it\r\n\r\ntransmits  very  quickly to other parts.  Old assumptions  no\r\n\r\nlonger  hold  true.  Last year, because of the Nasdaq  crash,\r\n\r\nChristmas  sales  in the US were down.  By November/December,\r\n\r\nit  was  felt  by  purchasers, it was felt by the  airfreight\r\n\r\ncompanies.    By  January,  Federal  Express  cut   back   on\r\n\r\nemployment  because they saw the economy  turning  down.   In\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  had a wafer fab which still  had  full  order\r\n\r\nbooks  in February and they rushed to complete it.  And  they\r\n\r\nbroke  a record from \"Sand to Silicon in 16 months\",  but  by\r\n\r\nthe  time they opened the fab, the order book had fallen out,\r\n\r\nto their regret.  And this is because the transmission is now\r\n\r\nalmost  direct, that when orders are placed, they are  placed\r\n\r\nnot only with those who supply the items, the same orders are\r\n\r\nsent  to the supplier's supplier's suppliers.  And the result\r\n\r\nis inventory buffers have come down sharply and there is much\r\n\r\nless  buffer in the economic system as a whole, which is  why\r\n\r\nshocks get transmitted very quickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  good  thing is: if we can come down so quickly,  we  can\r\n\r\nalso   climb  up  quickly.   That  is  the  obverse  of  this\r\n\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a problem. Last year, we kept on reviewing our\r\n\r\neconomic  forecast upwards;  this year, we kept on  reviewing\r\n\r\nit  downwards.  I do not think we can do any better,  because\r\n\r\nthis is a global problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the Minister has not responded to\r\n\r\nmy second point about China, on the Olympic Games.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nquite know enough about this to give a considered reply to Mr\r\n\r\nChng.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of\r\n\r\nthe greatest problems SMEs are facing in this downturn is the\r\n\r\nsudden  decline in orders and decline in revenue  and,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult,  some  SMEs are not able to get enough cash  flow  to\r\n\r\nservice  the  interest.  I wonder whether the Government  can\r\n\r\nactually  do something to help these companies in  the  short\r\n\r\nterm  service  their  interest or  even  some  other  working\r\n\r\ncapital problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when times\r\n\r\nget  more difficult, it is natural that interest rates go  up\r\n\r\nfor  higher-risk loans, and some companies face  difficulties\r\n\r\ngetting  financing  for working capital.  The  assessment  of\r\n\r\nsuch  risks cannot be done by the Government, cannot be  done\r\n\r\nby  PSB.   It  can  only  be done by banks  and  by  lenders.\r\n\r\nWhether  or not we can tweak LEFS in such a way as to provide\r\n\r\nsome assistance is something that we can consider, but I need\r\n\r\nto get my staff to study it more carefully before agreeing to\r\n\r\nthe proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  two questions.  The first is: the  package  is\r\n\r\nsilent  on  measures to help the unemployed or retrenched  to\r\n\r\nservice home mortgages, unlike the schemes available in 1998.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to know whether the Government has  plans  to\r\n\r\nprovide  such schemes in light of the fact that about  20,000\r\n\r\nare expected to be retrenched this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question, Sir, is on the calibration of the\r\n\r\nGovernment's response.  In 1998, the growth was 0.5% and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment came out with a $10 billion package.  Even netting\r\n\r\noff the CPF wage cut aspect, it was still about $2.5 billion.\r\n\r\nThis  time round, our forecast is 0.5% to 1.5%.  So  the  low\r\n\r\nend  is in a similar range to 1998 and, as the Minister says,\r\n\r\nit  is  structuring a bottom.  So we have not seen the bottom\r\n\r\nyet.   The  package of $2.2 billion, in fact,  includes  some\r\n\r\ncarry-through measures from the last cycle.  So the  question\r\n\r\nreally  is:   why  is  the  Government  being  somewhat  more\r\n\r\nrestrained  this  time in its package when  compared  to  the\r\n\r\nsituation in 1998?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said\r\n\r\nearlier,  the  retrenchment problem is still not  widespread.\r\n\r\nThere is widespread fear because of growing retrenchment, but\r\n\r\nthe  retrenchment itself is not yet widespread.  We can sense\r\n\r\nthis at our meet-the-people sessions - the number of hardship\r\n\r\ncases  that  we  are  seeing.  If it does become  widespread,\r\n\r\nwhich  means  that our darker scenario is the  more  accurate\r\n\r\none,  then we may need a package of income support for  those\r\n\r\nwho are in distress.  But we have not reached that point yet.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, the Minister has not answered my\r\n\r\nsecond question on calibration of response.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought I\r\n\r\nanswered that we have to calibrate our response to the actual\r\n\r\nsituation.   If  this  turns out to  be  a  relatively  short\r\n\r\ndownturn  and at the end of this year or early next year  the\r\n\r\nglobal  economy turns up again, then these measures which  Mr\r\n\r\nIswaran talks about ought not to be necessary.  But if it  is\r\n\r\nmore prolonged, which is entirely possible, then we will have\r\n\r\nto  do more.   And some of what we do will have to be in  the\r\n\r\nform of direct income support to individuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the area of\r\n\r\ntourism,  which  I  think  can help  our  retail  sector,  my\r\n\r\nquestion  is:   why  are we satisfied with just  double-digit\r\n\r\ngrowth?   I  think there are a lot more Chinese tourists  out\r\n\r\nthere who are interested to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncome to Singapore.  So what are the plans that are being  put\r\n\r\nin  place  to  attract more of them to  come  here,  to  stay\r\n\r\nlonger, to spend more and also to buy more branded goods, eg,\r\n\r\njewellery, watches, etc?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know whether the Ministry has plans\r\n\r\nto weed out those unscrupulous tour agents and shopkeepers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Goh is\r\n\r\nright  that  tourism  is  one sector  which  we  should  give\r\n\r\nparticular  promotion  to during this  period.   And  tourism\r\n\r\narrivals from China and India will put food on the table  for\r\n\r\nmany families in Singapore.  Therefore, this is an area which\r\n\r\nwe  should  try  to do more on.  It is likely that  Singapore\r\n\r\nTourism Board will open more offices in China to exploit  the\r\n\r\nrapid  growth in Chinese tourism beyond China.  They  already\r\n\r\nhave  a  very  large domestic tourism, but as  each  province\r\n\r\nbuilds  up  its  middle-class, the desire to travel  is  very\r\n\r\ngreat,  and many of them like to come to Singapore.   And  we\r\n\r\nshould welcome them.  For historical reasons, because we were\r\n\r\nafraid that some of these tourists may in fact turn out to be\r\n\r\nillegal migrants, we have put all kinds of controls in  order\r\n\r\nto  ensure  adequate safeguards.  We have  relaxed  some  two\r\n\r\nyears ago, and MTI is now taking the issue up to MHA again to\r\n\r\nsee   whether  we  can  relax  it  further,  to   make   visa\r\n\r\napplications easier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point about the consumption of Chinese tourists,\r\n\r\nmany of them come here on package tours which are very cheap.\r\n\r\nThen,  when they come here, instead of being brought  to  see\r\n\r\ncultural sites, they are brought to shop and they are made to\r\n\r\npay  high  prices because these are the only shops  they  are\r\n\r\nbrought  to.  We have been collecting statistics.   They  are\r\n\r\nhigh spenders, especially in jewellery items.  On the Chinese\r\n\r\nside,  they have been wanting us to help them weed out  these\r\n\r\nzero-cost  package tours, which are really an abuse,  and  we\r\n\r\nare  working with them but it is not quite easy, because that\r\n\r\nis the way the market is operating.  If people want such\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntours, they will get such tours, one way or the other.

On PWD, our responsibility is not  only  to  the\r\n\r\nindustries.  It is also to those workers in PWD who work with\r\n\r\nus faithfully for all these years.  So when we told them that\r\n\r\nwe were going\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  privatise it, we owed them a responsibility and we had to\r\n\r\nencourage  them  to  move  out from  a  permanent  Government\r\n\r\nservice into a private company.  To give them that assurance,\r\n\r\nand  they have families to support, we told them, \"All right,\r\n\r\nfive  years' moratorium.\"  I think we should stick to it  and\r\n\r\nnot because we are under pressure, cause a breach of faith in\r\n\r\nthe solemn undertaking which we gave them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I would like to pose two questions to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister.   May  I ask whether the  HDB  rental  rebates\r\n\r\nannounced  earlier  would more than  offset  the  recent  HDB\r\n\r\nrental hikes, or would the Minister consider reversing  these\r\n\r\nHDB rental hikes to give an even better impact on these post-budget  measures?  Could I also ask the Minister  whether  he\r\n\r\nwould  give  more  incentives to  businesses,  factories  and\r\n\r\nmanufacturers to turn the downturn time to opportune time  by\r\n\r\nhelping   them  to  revamp  and  upgrade  to  improve   their\r\n\r\ncompetitive edge and their productivity?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, Dr Lily Neo had an\r\n\r\nexchange with Minister Mah Bow Tan earlier on this particular\r\n\r\nissue of rental rebates.  There are really two choices.   For\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  already below market rental, we  could  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Look,  you do not qualify for the additional  rebates\r\n\r\nbecause you are already below market rental.\" Or we say, \"Let\r\n\r\nus  separate the two aspects\".  There is already a  long-term\r\n\r\npolicy  to bring them up to market rentals so that  shops  on\r\n\r\nthe  same row operate on a level playing field and,  on  that\r\n\r\nbasis,  we  give  them their rebates.  Or have  two  separate\r\n\r\nclasses of shops.  I agree with Minister Mah Bow Tan that the\r\n\r\none  we  have  proposed is the fairest.   As  to  whether  in\r\n\r\nspecific dollars and cents for particular shops, whether  the\r\n\r\nnet  result  is positive or negative, that question  I  would\r\n\r\nhave to refer to Minister Mah Bow Tan for response because  I\r\n\r\nam  not  familiar with the exact details.  It probably varies\r\n\r\nfrom shop to shop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the other question about incentives to help our\r\n\r\nshops upgrade and become more productive, as you know,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have many programmes under PSB to help them.  It  is  not\r\n\r\neasy.   Very often, it depends on whether their own  children\r\n\r\nare  prepared  to  take over those shops  and  to  have  them\r\n\r\nupgraded.  For those whose children are not prepared to  join\r\n\r\ntheir fathers' shops, then we have got a scheme to help  them\r\n\r\nexit.  I believe each is given a grant of $48,000.  We cannot\r\n\r\navoid this restructuring.  Basically, we have too much retail\r\n\r\nspace in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, in Bedok Reservoir, Sheng Siong opened a new\r\n\r\nsupermarket.   They  say, \"Special sale - eight  cucumbers  - $0.30\".   Everyone flocks there.  My residents are  all  very\r\n\r\nhappy. But all the neighbourhood shops are very unhappy.  Can\r\n\r\nwe  stop  it?   Is it good to stop it?  Even if there  is  no\r\n\r\nSheng  Siong,  there is Carrefour, there is  Walmart.   There\r\n\r\nwill be other chains operating, which will be able to sell at\r\n\r\nlower  costs  because  they  have  got  better  supply  chain\r\n\r\nmanagement and they have got stronger purchasing power.   Our\r\n\r\njob  is  to  facilitate adjustment, not to  add  friction  to\r\n\r\nmarket adjustment.  That is the approach we are taking.   For\r\n\r\nthose  who  want to make the adjustment, we help them  in  as\r\n\r\nmany  ways as we can.  For those who want to exit, we try  to\r\n\r\nmake it as easy for them to exit as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, the \"People for Jobs\" Traineeship\r\n\r\nProgramme is a good programme to help workers who would  find\r\n\r\nit  difficult to take up technical based courses.

In other words, budget  would  not  be  a\r\n\r\nconstraint and if there are better ways to make the programme\r\n\r\nwork, we will do as much as possible. This is a big group  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the baby-boomers, many of whom do not  even  have\r\n\r\nmore than six years of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation.

The\r\n\r\nGovernment  places  great emphasis on the training  of  civil\r\n\r\nservants.   Our target is to give every officer at least  100\r\n\r\nhours  of  training  per year.  Public  sector  organisations\r\n\r\ncannot deliver effective, high level of service unless public\r\n\r\nservants  are  well-trained.  It is not only about  equipping\r\n\r\nofficers  with  work-based skills  to  better  perform  their\r\n\r\nduties,   but   with  management  tools  for   organisational\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   We also want to imbue in them the  appropriate\r\n\r\nvalues and mindset as public servants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's intense competition for talent, good people\r\n\r\nconsider  more  than pay and career prospects  when  deciding\r\n\r\nwhether  to  take  up a job. They also look for  avenues  for\r\n\r\nfurther  training and personal development in the  course  of\r\n\r\ntheir work.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  public  service will not be able to recruit  and  retain\r\n\r\ngood   officers   if  it  does  not  offer  them   meaningful\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  be trained and developed  for  challenging\r\n\r\nassignments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Civil Service College plays a key role in\r\n\r\ntraining  civil  servants.   It offers  a  wide  spectrum  of\r\n\r\nprogrammes.    There   are  courses  on  management   issues,\r\n\r\nincluding  human resource management and employee performance\r\n\r\nmanagement,  and operational matters like use of  IT  in  the\r\n\r\npublic service, service quality, finance and accounting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other courses focus on leadership and policy\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  The College also provides consultancy  services\r\n\r\non    public    sector    reform    initiatives,    promoting\r\n\r\norganisational,   people  and  system   development   through\r\n\r\nprogrammes  like  learning  organisation,  people   developer\r\n\r\nstandards, the ISO 9000 and the SQA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the frontiers of the knowledge economy are\r\n\r\nconstantly advancing and our operating environment is rapidly\r\n\r\nchanging.   Public officers have to keep their knowledge  and\r\n\r\nskills  up to date to stay relevant and productive.  We  thus\r\n\r\nhave  to  continually improve existing programmes offered  by\r\n\r\nthe  College,  as well as to develop new programmes  to  meet\r\n\r\nfresh  requirements.  We also have to pay  attention  to  the\r\n\r\ndelivery   of  training  programmes  and  the  organisational\r\n\r\nstructure  of the College.  Our aim is to make training  more\r\n\r\naccessible  to public sector organisations and help  them  in\r\n\r\ntheir organisational development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the background to the plan to convert the Civil\r\n\r\nService  College  into a self-funding statutory  board  under\r\n\r\nPSD.    The   College's  activities,  such  as  new  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and  consultancy projects,  typically  have  long\r\n\r\ngestation periods.  The College has to bear the developmental\r\n\r\ncost first and recoup them when the projects are completed or\r\n\r\nthe  new  programmes are rolled out.  Some of  the  College's\r\n\r\nprogrammes  would  then  have application  beyond  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice.   As  a statutory board, the College can internalise\r\n\r\ntheir  cost and revenues from its activities and so  maintain\r\n\r\nmore flexible control over its finances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the point of view of human resources, the demand\r\n\r\nfor  the  Civil  Service College's training  and  consultancy\r\n\r\nservices  is not constant over time.  The College  needs  the\r\n\r\nflexibility  to  assemble  teams of  competent  trainers  and\r\n\r\nconsultants,  in  sync  with  its work  schedules,  including\r\n\r\nemploying  them  on  short-term basis for specific  projects.\r\n\r\nThe College will be able to do this much more effectively  as\r\n\r\na statutory board rather than as a Government department.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Personnel Guidance Unit is presently not part of the\r\n\r\nCollege.   It  provides  consultancy  services  and   applied\r\n\r\norganisational   psychology.    It   helps   public    sector\r\n\r\norganisations  select  new  recruits,  as  well  as   provide\r\n\r\nprogrammes   for  organisational  diagnosis   and   personnel\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  These are closely related to the Civil  Service\r\n\r\nCollege's   broader   consultancy   services   on   promoting\r\n\r\norganisational  excellence. Putting  the  Personnel  Guidance\r\n\r\nUnit  together  with the College will enable the  College  to\r\n\r\nprovide an integrated range of services spanning assessments,\r\n\r\nselection, training and organisational development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the main aspects of the Bill. The\r\n\r\nboard of the statutory board shall consist of a Chairman  and\r\n\r\n5  to 15 other members, all of whom shall be appointed by the\r\n\r\nMinister, as provided by clause 5.  The statutory board  will\r\n\r\ntake  on  the existing functions of the Civil Service College\r\n\r\nand  Personnel  Guidance Unit.  The primary function  of  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  board  will  be  to provide  training  for  public\r\n\r\nservants    and   contribute   to   the   public    service's\r\n\r\norganisational  development efforts.  The functions,  objects\r\n\r\nand duties of the statutory board are laid out in clause 13.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 18 to 29 are the financial provisions. The\r\n\r\nstatutory  board will be self-funded with its main source  of\r\n\r\nfunding being fees for the services it provides.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of property, liabilities and employees are\r\n\r\nprovided  in  clauses 30 to 36.  All properties,  assets  and\r\n\r\nliabilities  of  the  Civil  Service  College  and  Personnel\r\n\r\nGuidance Unit departments will be transferred to the  College\r\n\r\nupon its formation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll  the  employees of the two departments,  apart  from  the\r\n\r\nAdministrative Officers,\r\n\r\nwill also be transferred to the statutory board at terms that\r\n\r\nare  no  less favourable than those enjoyed by the  employees\r\n\r\nbefore the transfer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provisions in the Bill are standard provisions\r\n\r\nfound in the Acts of other statutory boards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has been continually restructuring\r\n\r\nitself   to  stay  effective  and  relevant  in  a   changing\r\n\r\nenvironment.  We have been spinning off statutory boards from\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  to give them more autonomy and flexibility  in\r\n\r\ntheir  operations.   We  have separated  the  regulatory  and\r\n\r\noperating functions of some statutory boards, hiving off  and\r\n\r\ncorporatising  their  operating  functions  into  independent\r\n\r\ncompanies and setting up regulatory agencies to supervise the\r\n\r\nindustries.   As  new  issues and areas emerge  which  demand\r\n\r\nfocused  attention,  we are also merging  existing  statutory\r\n\r\nboards  and  setting up new ones.  The work of restructuring,\r\n\r\nhowever,  is never finished.  The restructuring of the  Civil\r\n\r\nService  College,  as a statutory board, will  enable  it  to\r\n\r\nbetter  focus on training and organisational development  for\r\n\r\nthe public service.  This will help us to further upgrade the\r\n\r\nCollege   and  enhance  its  value  to  the  public  service.\r\n\r\nUltimately,  this  should  result in  better  trained  public\r\n\r\nservants who will help to create a first-class public service\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, a lot is expected of the civil\r\n\r\nservice.   It  has  to continue to be efficient,  responsive,\r\n\r\ninnovative  and service oriented if it were to meet  the  new\r\n\r\ndemands  and  needs  of the public and  to  function  in  the\r\n\r\nrestructuring process of the Government organisations.  It is\r\n\r\nespecially  true  now  as  our society  is  undergoing  rapid\r\n\r\nchanges,  especially  in  the way  people  communicate.   The\r\n\r\nInternet has made it possible for people to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngive  feedback more directly.  It has also resulted in demand\r\n\r\nfor e-services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Service College has a very important role in\r\n\r\ntraining  civil  servants to meet this challenge,  especially\r\n\r\nbecause  the Government aspires for the civil service  to  be\r\n\r\namong  the best in the world.  Indeed, the quality  of  civil\r\n\r\nservants  determines whether the public service  is  able  to\r\n\r\nrespond  to the new challenges and demands.  In this context,\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to  ask how would the Civil  Service  College\r\n\r\nrespond  to  the challenge of civil service in  providing  e-services  to  the  public, ie, how the College  supports  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service in this challenge, and how the College  itself\r\n\r\nis  responding to the challenge of e-services.  Secondly, how\r\n\r\nwould  the  College assist officers who are  moved  from  one\r\n\r\ndepartment  or Ministry to another so that they can  continue\r\n\r\nto function efficiently?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the plan for the Civil Service College\r\n\r\nlaid out by the Deputy Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, I rise to support\r\n\r\nthe  incorporation of the Civil Service College as a separate\r\n\r\nentity  to  allow it to be run autonomously, efficiently  and\r\n\r\neffectively.   The Civil Service College, if run successfully\r\n\r\nand  getting our civil servants to discharge their duties and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities diligently, will not only benefit the  civil\r\n\r\nservants  but also the members of the public whom  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants serve.  I see a lot of potential for the College  to\r\n\r\nnetwork with the industries and private sector organisations,\r\n\r\nboth  in  Singapore and overseas.  I am sure that the College\r\n\r\nwill be seeking out opportunities to benefit from opening  to\r\n\r\nand  participation  from  the academia,  the  private  sector\r\n\r\ncompanies and professional services firms.  As some MNCs will\r\n\r\nbecome powerful and influential in the globalised world,  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector  officers need to understand  how  these  MNCs\r\n\r\nwork.  The civil service should also benchmark itself against\r\n\r\nthe best practices adopted by excellent globalised MNCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have an excellent public service. We have an\r\n\r\nestablished  tradition  of  evolving  and  strengthening  the\r\n\r\nperformance standards of our civil servants.

Of course, we have the odd occasion of  failures,\r\n\r\nof  doing  things  less  well.  All  these  have  become  the\r\n\r\ninstitutional  memory  and wealth knowledge  and  information\r\n\r\nretained  in  our  public service.  The world  is  converging\r\n\r\ntowards  requiring  high standards of ethics  and  governance\r\n\r\nfrom governments for its citizens.  There is a need for civil\r\n\r\nservants and entrepreneurs, CEOs and professional managers to\r\n\r\nunderstand  each  other.   The  College  can  facilitate  the\r\n\r\nexchange   and  participation  in  each  other's   work   and\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has benefitted from the experience of many\r\n\r\nestablished public service of developed countries.   We  have\r\n\r\nlearnt  from  them  and adapted in ways  that  work  best  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Sir, I think it is now our turn to help the  less\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries  to  improve  the  standard  of   public\r\n\r\nservants for the benefit of the citizens of the world.  And I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Civil  Service  College  will  provide  space  and\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  the public sector employees  of  overseas\r\n\r\ncountries.  Like the Jamaican MP who is impressed with Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  Lee  Kuan  Yew's  memoirs  in  how  Singapore   has\r\n\r\nsucceeded when many others had failed, and we also read  from\r\n\r\nthe  press report of Chinese bureaucrats who decided that  by\r\n\r\ndoing the Master in Public Administration is better than  the\r\n\r\nMBA  because  it  is  more appropriate  to  their  work,  are\r\n\r\nexamples  of  the attitudes and actions taken by well-meaning\r\n\r\ncivil  servants if opportunities are made available for  them\r\n\r\nto carve a career in the public service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As learning has become even more important in the\r\n\r\nglobalised and deregulated world and the active participation\r\n\r\nof citizens on our civil society, I would urge the Government\r\n\r\nto  continue  to provide the necessary funds and  support  in\r\n\r\nensuring that adequate resources are provided.  In the  fast-changing  world, civil servants also require to be adequately\r\n\r\ntrained and developed for their jobs.  As the iron rice  bowl\r\n\r\nmentality of civil service is a thing of the past, the  well-trained civil servants can take comfort that they can make  a\r\n\r\ncareer switch with ease, making\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuse of their skills, knowledge and experience in their second\r\n\r\nand subsequent careers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I presume that the Civil Service College\r\n\r\nwill  train all levels of public servants from the lowest  to\r\n\r\nthe  highest  grades.   This is in  line  with  the  learning\r\n\r\nculture which we wish to inculcate in Singapore.  The  nature\r\n\r\nof  work  requires people working in teams.  It  requires  an\r\n\r\nintegrated and inter-disciplinary approach to problem solving\r\n\r\nand innovation in the delivering of services to the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with its new character and status, I have no doubt\r\n\r\nthat  the  College will become a world-class  institution  of\r\n\r\nlearning for Singapore's civil servants.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I would support the\r\n\r\nestablishment of the Civil Service College as an  institution\r\n\r\nof  education  to improve the quality of our civil  servants.\r\n\r\nThis  College, I understand, is not new.  It was  already  in\r\n\r\nexistence  on  or about the time when the PAP took  power  in\r\n\r\n1959  or thereabouts.  But I wonder why after nearly 40 years\r\n\r\nthe Government wants  to formalise its establishment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the formal establishment of such a\r\n\r\nCollege, but I have some reservations.  A glaring anomaly  is\r\n\r\nthat  it  is supposed to be an institution of education,  but\r\n\r\nturns  out  to be more a political institution.   It  is  not\r\n\r\nformed  under  the jurisdiction of the Ministry of  Education\r\n\r\nbut   under  the  charge  of  the  Prime  Minister's  Office.\r\n\r\nPoliticians are made to be in charge of this College and  not\r\n\r\nprofessional educators.  I think this is significant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand to be corrected, Sir. I believe that it was\r\n\r\nformed  in  the early days to educate civil servants  on  the\r\n\r\nthreat  of  Communism and dangerous left-wing elements  which\r\n\r\nwere  present  in  those early days.  But, today,  there  are\r\n\r\nhardly such threats any more.  Communism in Russia and  China\r\n\r\nhas  collapsed for good.  Both these countries have abandoned\r\n\r\nCommunism as a doctrine and there is no fear of spread of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunism  to other countries, including Singapore,  anymore.\r\n\r\nIf such is the case, then what is the thrust of the teachings\r\n\r\nof the College these days?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is well known for its efficiency. I certainly\r\n\r\nhave  no objections to the training of our civil servants  to\r\n\r\nbe  efficient, but I hope that the efficiency  of  our  civil\r\n\r\nservants is neutral to all parties.  The civil servants  must\r\n\r\nserve  the  whole population without any fear or favour,  and\r\n\r\nnot  to favour any political parties.  Sir, I would take this\r\n\r\nopportunity to tell the civil servants in Singapore that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition in Singapore is a loyal opposition.  We are  loyal\r\n\r\nto  the Constitution and loyal to Singapore.  We are just  as\r\n\r\nresponsible  as the ruling party or any other Singaporean  in\r\n\r\nregard  to nation building, and keeping Singapore a  peaceful\r\n\r\nand prosperous place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am saying this because in my early days of\r\n\r\nparticipating  in politics, my experience was that  when  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  made an application to the HDB or to  the  Police\r\n\r\nfor  a  public  entertainment licence, we were  treated  with\r\n\r\nsuspicion  by  civil  servants.  Those applications  were  in\r\n\r\nrelation to a simple thing like holding a public dinner,  and\r\n\r\nyet there was always a long delay.  There was always complete\r\n\r\nsilence  to our application.  And what we had to  do  was  to\r\n\r\nsend  constant  reminders and make  telephone  calls  to  the\r\n\r\nauthorities, but we got no answers.  Those applications, mind\r\n\r\nyou,  were not earth shattering applications.  They were just\r\n\r\nsimple procedural applications to hold a public dinner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My experience was that when I telephoned an officer, he\r\n\r\nwould  say, \"Oh, your application has gone all the  way  up.\"\r\n\r\nMy  goodness,  can  you  believe  that?   It  was  a   simple\r\n\r\napplication, and the application went all the way up, and  no\r\n\r\nanswer  had come down yet.  That was why there was  a  delay.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am  not exaggerating.  A simple application  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  to hold a public dinner, and yet our  application\r\n\r\nhad  to  go all the way up to the top.  Any application  from\r\n\r\nthe Opposition appeared to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike a hot potato to the civil servants, and no one wanted to\r\n\r\nmake a decision on it.\r\n\r\nWith the formal establishment of the Civil Service College, I\r\n\r\nhope that the right things can be taught in this College,  to\r\n\r\ndefuse  the  fear  and suspicion of the Opposition,  and  not\r\n\r\ntreat  us  as  if  we are like animals with horns  and  sharp\r\n\r\nteeth.  I would like to remind the civil servants that we are\r\n\r\nalso  Singaporeans who treat Singapore as our home.  Our true\r\n\r\nintention  is also to make Singapore a better place  to  live\r\n\r\nin.   I  hope this message somehow can get into the teachings\r\n\r\nof the Civil Service College.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps I will\r\n\r\ntake  Mr Chiam's points first since they are fresh and  vivid\r\n\r\nin our minds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam is mistaken. The Civil Service College has\r\n\r\nnothing to do with the Political Study Centre.  The Political\r\n\r\nStudy  Centre is what the PAP Government set up in 1959  when\r\n\r\nit  first  came  into  power in order to  educate  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants  in the realities of Singapore's politics  and  what\r\n\r\nthe   communist  threat  was  and  what  the  nation-building\r\n\r\npriorities  were.   That  was in  1959.   The  Civil  Service\r\n\r\nCollege  is  the  successor of what used to be  called  CSSDI\r\n\r\n(Civil Service Staff and Development Institute) which was  at\r\n\r\nHeng  Mui  Keng  Terrace  at Pasir Panjang.   It  runs  staff\r\n\r\ncourses,  courses for middle management, courses  for  senior\r\n\r\nmanagement,  courses on governance, courses on  good  English\r\n\r\nwriting, courses on how to be a good civil servant, including\r\n\r\nhow to deal expeditiously with difficult hot potatoes!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSSDI had been there for many years. It was converted\r\n\r\ninto  a  Civil Service College about a decade ago and now  we\r\n\r\nare going to convert this into a statutory board, so that  it\r\n\r\ncan  operate  more  flexibly and have more leeway  in  hiring\r\n\r\npeople  and  taking people on contract, in  doing  activities\r\n\r\nbeyond  the strict traditional mandate.  Because, as  Mr  Loh\r\n\r\nMeng  See  says, the Civil Service College also has  to  have\r\n\r\nlinks  with  what is happening in the outside  world,  to  be\r\n\r\nbenchmarked against best practices amongst the MNCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the two are totally separate, and politics is not in\r\n\r\ncharge,  neither  are  politicians  in  charge.   These   are\r\n\r\nprofessional  educational courses which need to  be  run  for\r\n\r\ncivil   servants  at  all  levels,  from  the  top  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary potential, all the way down to the clerical officer\r\n\r\nor  to the EO.  So it is a completely neutral outfit.  It has\r\n\r\nnothing to do with the travails or the vicissitudes which the\r\n\r\nOpposition gets into from time to time.  I have no doubt that\r\n\r\nwe  will  inform all civil servants that the Opposition  does\r\n\r\nnot  consist of animals with horns and sharp teeth, and  that\r\n\r\nthey   should  defuse  their  fear  and  suspicion   of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  I will make a point of informing them this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi asked about e-services. E-services are indeed\r\n\r\nan important public sector initiative because it is a way for\r\n\r\nus  to improve our service, a way for us to get across to the\r\n\r\npublic  to provide our services, to get responses to  service\r\n\r\nthem better.  Therefore, the College provides a comprehensive\r\n\r\nrange  of  IT  programmes  to help  the  officers  to  become\r\n\r\ncomfortable  and  adept at IT in order to support  electronic\r\n\r\ndelivery  of  services.  In the management programmes,  there\r\n\r\nare  also modules to prompt participants to consider  how  e-government  could be adopted to help respective organisations\r\n\r\nimprove  their internal processes and service delivery.   The\r\n\r\nCollege  itself  is  also adopting infocomm  technologies  to\r\n\r\nbetter  service  its  customers and has started  offering  e-learning services through its open academy.  So this  is  one\r\n\r\nsignificant area for the College to focus on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The College also does assist officers who are moved from\r\n\r\none  department  or Ministry to another,  as  Mr  Hawazi  has\r\n\r\nasked.   It offers skills programmes to help officers  to  be\r\n\r\ntrained  for  new  work requirements if  this  is  necessary.\r\n\r\nApart  from  the  skills  specific programmes,  it  also  has\r\n\r\ndeveloped mental programmes to help officers prepare for  and\r\n\r\ncope with different transitions in life, including changes in\r\n\r\nthe work environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See asked about benchmarking against MNCs\r\n\r\nand the private sector.  Most of our programmes are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfocused on the needs of the public service.  That is the main\r\n\r\nmission  of  the Civil Service College.  But we do  recognise\r\n\r\nthat   some   of  these  programmes  offer  a  platform   for\r\n\r\ninteraction  among participants from the public  and  private\r\n\r\nsectors  which enriches the learning environment and  exposes\r\n\r\nparticipants to more valid initiatives and perspectives.   So\r\n\r\nalthough the College's courses are geared towards the  public\r\n\r\nsector,  some  of  these courses are open to  private  sector\r\n\r\nparticipants,  except for a few in-house  courses  which  are\r\n\r\nespecially sensitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training for foreign civil services - indeed we do\r\n\r\nprovide  training  as  well  as consultancy.   In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nCollege  frequently serves as a one-stop  contact  point  for\r\n\r\nforeign  civil services on matters relating to public service\r\n\r\nreforms  and initiatives because many foreign civil  services\r\n\r\nare   interested  in  finding  out  more  about   Singapore's\r\n\r\ncorporate governance.  These interactions are valued  by  the\r\n\r\nCollege.   They  provide opportunities for the  learning  and\r\n\r\nsharing  of best practices in public administration and  they\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the  understanding  between  Singapore  and   the\r\n\r\nforeign  civil  services.  We have had  amongst  other  civil\r\n\r\nservices, civil servants from Bhutan, Botswana, China, Macau,\r\n\r\nThailand  and Vietnam, to come to the College, and  they  use\r\n\r\nthe  services which are often specially tailored to the needs\r\n\r\nof the respective civil services.  I think with the increased\r\n\r\noperational  flexibility of a statutory  board,  the  College\r\n\r\nwill  be  better  placed to assemble teams  of  trainers  and\r\n\r\nconsultants quickly in response to these requests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Loh Meng See asked whether the courses cover\r\n\r\nall levels of the civil service.  The answer is yes.  Because\r\n\r\ntraining is relevant and important to all levels and  so  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes  cater to all levels according to  their  learning\r\n\r\nneeds,  ranging  from management development  programmes  for\r\n\r\nsenior civil servants to office skills programmes for support\r\n\r\nlevel  civil  servants.  It does not mean  the  College  does\r\n\r\nevery  single course.  For example, it does not offer  unique\r\n\r\nvocational training like nursing or civil defence  which  the\r\n\r\nprofessional organisations will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovide.    But  the  College  provides  the  broad  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes for the whole range of the civil service, from the\r\n\r\nbottom to the top.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [BG Lee Hsien Loong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.38 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LAND TITLES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill amends the Land Titles Act to, firstly,\r\n\r\nfacilitate the conversion of land from the common law  system\r\n\r\nto  the land titles system of registration; secondly, improve\r\n\r\nthe administration of the Act; and thirdly, clarify the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drafting this Bill, we have consulted the relevant\r\n\r\nGovernment departments dealing with land as well as  the  Law\r\n\r\nSociety of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me highlight the main changes to the Act. I will,\r\n\r\nfirst, discuss the amendments to facilitate the conversion of\r\n\r\nthe  remaining 2% of our lands from the old common law  deeds\r\n\r\nsystem to the land titles system of registration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently two land registration systems in\r\n\r\nSingapore   -   the  \"old\"  common  law  system   under   the\r\n\r\nRegistration  of  Deeds  Act  and  the  \"new\"   land   titles\r\n\r\nregistration  system under the Land Titles Act.   The  latter\r\n\r\nprovides  for  a  simpler  and clearer  land  register.   The\r\n\r\nexercise  to  convert  all the lands in  Singapore  from  the\r\n\r\ncommon  law  system  to the land titles  registration  system\r\n\r\nstarted in 1996 and we aim to complete it by the end of  this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Registrar of Titles has converted about 9,200 land  lots\r\n\r\nwith   a  balance  of  about  2,500  lots.   Completing   the\r\n\r\nconversion is hampered by certain technicalities in  the  law\r\n\r\nwhich the following amendments will address.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Bill will allow the Registrar to convert\r\n\r\nleases  of about 3,000 flats which were registered under  the\r\n\r\ncommon  law system during the 1950s and 60s.  This was before\r\n\r\nthe Land Titles (Strata) Act came into operation.  Currently,\r\n\r\nit  is  not  possible  for  the  Registrar  to  initiate  the\r\n\r\nconversion of these leases.  The amendments pave the way  for\r\n\r\nthis.  In addition, to facilitate the process, as one owner's\r\n\r\nnon-response can hold up the entire development's conversion,\r\n\r\nthe  amendments provide that the Registrar can advertise  the\r\n\r\nnotice of conversion in the local daily newspapers and send a\r\n\r\ncopy  of  the  notice  to the owner informing  him  that  the\r\n\r\nconversion will take place after the expiry of 21  days  from\r\n\r\nthe  date  of  publication  of the notice.   Thereafter,  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  will  simultaneously  convert  the  land  and  the\r\n\r\nleasehold  title  for  all  the  flats  so  that  the  entire\r\n\r\ndevelopment can be brought under the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Bill will enable the Registrar to convert land\r\n\r\nof whatever tenure.  Currently, leases with an unexpired term\r\n\r\nof  less than 10 years have been excluded as it was felt that\r\n\r\nthey  would  be  expiring soon.  However,  if  they  are  not\r\n\r\nincluded in the conversion exercise, we will have to  operate\r\n\r\ntwo systems in the meantime.  This does not make sense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also allow the Registrar to issue a\r\n\r\ncertificate of title in the name of a deceased proprietor  to\r\n\r\nprevent  conversions being held up for months or  even  years\r\n\r\nbecause of delay in settling the estate matters.  Some of the\r\n\r\nAustralian  states  faced  with  this  problem  have  similar\r\n\r\nprovisions in their laws to deal with this issue.  However, I\r\n\r\nwish  to assure Members that although a certificate of  title\r\n\r\nwill  be  created, it will remain in the Registrar's  custody\r\n\r\nand  only released to the personal representatives after  the\r\n\r\ndeceased proprietor's estate has been settled.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also deals with common law private leases.\r\n\r\nThese  are  very  old leases created in the  1800s.   A  good\r\n\r\nnumber  of them do not even state a date for the commencement\r\n\r\nof  the  leases.   They  indicate  the  tenure  but  not  the\r\n\r\ncommencement  date, which is necessary for  the  issuance  of\r\n\r\ntitles upon conversion of the lands.  So, the Bill allows the\r\n\r\nRegistrar,  for  the  purposes of converting  the  lands,  to\r\n\r\nassume that the lease commenced from the date of the lease.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on the other amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land converted from the common law system is held with a\r\n\r\ncaution  stating  that the title is subject  to  pre-existing\r\n\r\nclaims  or encumbrances.  This means that the State does  not\r\n\r\nguarantee the title to be free from encumbrance and  a  buyer\r\n\r\nof  qualified  title must still investigate the  pre-existing\r\n\r\ncommon  law deeds, making the conveyance more expensive.   It\r\n\r\nis  only  when  the  caution lapses that  the  title  becomes\r\n\r\nindefeasible,  backed by a State guarantee.  Sir,  under  the\r\n\r\npresent law, a caution lapses only if there is a sale of  the\r\n\r\nland  after title conversion.  The Bill will provide for  the\r\n\r\nautomatic  lapsing of cautions 10 years after  the  land  was\r\n\r\nconverted,  or  after 2 years from the commencement  of  this\r\n\r\namendment, whichever is later, even if there has been no sale\r\n\r\nafter title conversion.  This will result in more unqualified\r\n\r\ntitles,   which   benefits   the   public,   as   the   title\r\n\r\ninvestigations  are  easier  and  therefore   cheaper.   This\r\n\r\namendment  will  reduce the number of qualified  titles  from\r\n\r\nabout  13% to about 7% after 2 years and completely eliminate\r\n\r\nthem after 10 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also now make it necessary for anyone\r\n\r\ndealing  with  a  landowner to conduct  bankruptcy  searches.\r\n\r\nThey  can  no longer rely on the Land Titles Act to exonerate\r\n\r\nthem from notice of any bankruptcy proceedings affecting  the\r\n\r\nlandowner.  This is necessary as the Bankruptcy Act  provides\r\n\r\nfor  the  automatic vesting of a bankrupt's property  in  the\r\n\r\nOfficial Assignee.  The land register therefore may not  show\r\n\r\nthat the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbankrupt's  property is now vested in the Official  Assignee.\r\n\r\nThis  amendment  will  not make things onerous  for,  say,  a\r\n\r\nprospective   purchaser,   because   in   practice,   lawyers\r\n\r\ninvariably   make   bankruptcy   searches   during   property\r\n\r\ntransactions.  These searches are easy to carry  out  as  the\r\n\r\nOfficial  Assignee's records are computerised  and  available\r\n\r\nfor remote online search.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now touch on the amendment relating to\r\n\r\nrestrictive   covenants.   A  restrictive  covenant   is   an\r\n\r\nagreement  made  by  one  landowner with  the  owner  of  the\r\n\r\nneighbouring  land not to do certain acts or  things  on  his\r\n\r\nland  such  that  it would adversely affect the  neighbouring\r\n\r\nland, for example, not to build a block of flats on his land.\r\n\r\nFor   registered  lands  under  the  Land  Titles  Act,   the\r\n\r\nrestrictive covenant will last for 20 years from the date  of\r\n\r\nits creation or notification on the land register.  It can be\r\n\r\nextended for 10 years each time.  For lands registered  under\r\n\r\ncommon law, a restrictive covenant can last forever unless it\r\n\r\nis  released  by  the  owner  of  the  neighbouring  lots  or\r\n\r\nextinguished by an order of court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most of the existing restrictive covenants created\r\n\r\nat  common  law are obsolete as they have been superseded  by\r\n\r\nplanning  and  other  regulatory laws.   The  Bill  therefore\r\n\r\nprovides that restrictive covenants created at common law  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  unregistered  land  may,  unless  extended,   be\r\n\r\nextinguished automatically after the expiration of  20  years\r\n\r\nfrom the date of its creation or the expiration of five years\r\n\r\nfrom  the  date of notification on the land register  or  two\r\n\r\nyears  from  the  date of the commencement  of  this  amended\r\n\r\nprovision,  whichever  is the latest.   This  amendment  will\r\n\r\nfacilitate urban redevelopment of the land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Bill clarifies the position on unilateral\r\n\r\nseverance of joint tenancies.  In 1993, a new way to sever  a\r\n\r\njoint   tenancy  was  introduced,  that  is,   severance   by\r\n\r\nunilateral declaration.  A person who co-owns property  as  a\r\n\r\njoint  tenant is able to sever the joint tenancy by a  simple\r\n\r\nunilateral notice in writing.  At law,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseverance  usually results in equal shares.  But  there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  owners  claiming to unilaterally sever joint  tenancies\r\n\r\ninto  unequal shares.  The Registrar is not in a position  to\r\n\r\nverify  the  truth of such claims.  Therefore, the  Bill  now\r\n\r\nstates  very  clearly that unilateral severance  of  a  joint\r\n\r\ntenancy can only be in equal shares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment also clarifies that tenants-in-common can\r\n\r\nconvert  their  holdings  by way of a  declaration  to  joint\r\n\r\ntenancy  only if they are tenants-in-common in equal  shares.\r\n\r\nCo-owners  with  unequal shares who wish  to  hold  as  joint\r\n\r\ntenants can do so by way of a transfer as there is in  effect\r\n\r\na  transfer of some of the interest of the co-owner with  the\r\n\r\nlarger share to the one with the lesser share.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me deal with the definition of \"land\". The\r\n\r\ncurrent   definition   of   \"land\"   includes   airspace   or\r\n\r\nsubterranean  space which is held apart from the  surface  of\r\n\r\nthe earth.  This definition has posed problems because in the\r\n\r\nnew  mixed-use developments, the State is required  to  issue\r\n\r\ntitles   for   parcels  of  land  comprising   airspace   cum\r\n\r\nsubterranean  space.   One example of this  is  the  Sengkang\r\n\r\nMRT/LRT  station which will be four storeys above ground  and\r\n\r\ntwo levels underground.  To facilitate such developments, the\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"land\" is amended to enable title to be  issued\r\n\r\nfor  a parcel of airspace cum subterranean space.  This  will\r\n\r\nfacilitate   the   creative  design  of  complex   integrated\r\n\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will go a long way towards improving the\r\n\r\nadministration of land law in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>STATUTES (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS AND REPEAL) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is to effect a number of minor or\r\n\r\ntechnical amendments to several Acts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Repeal of the Coin Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Coin Act. Clause 5 repeals the Coin Act.\r\n\r\nThe  Coin  Act regulates the import and export of coins.   It\r\n\r\nwas  enacted  way back in 1903 during the Straits  Settlement\r\n\r\ndays  to  prevent large inflows of coins that  threatened  to\r\n\r\ndisplace  the circulation of Straits Settlement coins.   That\r\n\r\nobjective  obviously is no longer valid today.  Currency  now\r\n\r\nflows  via electronic and other means.  It is highly unlikely\r\n\r\nfor  there to be a need to impose regulatory controls on  the\r\n\r\nflow  of coins.  Even if such a need arises, this can be done\r\n\r\nunder other legislation, such as the Currency Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to the Interpretation Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, clause 2 seeks to amend the Interpretation Act\r\n\r\nby   replacing  the  Greenwich  Mean  Time  with  Coordinated\r\n\r\nUniversal  Time as the basis for defining Singapore  Standard\r\n\r\nTime.   The  Greenwich  Mean Time is  based  on  astronomical\r\n\r\nobservations  and is no longer used for scientific  purposes.\r\n\r\nThe  Coordinated  Universal Time is the only  practical  time\r\n\r\nscale  maintained and disseminated under the Metre Convention\r\n\r\nand  is  recommended for use by international bodies such  as\r\n\r\nthe   International  Bureau  of  Weights  and  Measures   and\r\n\r\nInternational  Telecommunication Union.  Many countries  have\r\n\r\nconverted  to the Coordinated Universal Time as  it  is  more\r\n\r\nreliable, stable and accessible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore, as a Member State of the Metre\r\n\r\nConvention, should officially adopt the Coordinated Universal\r\n\r\nTime.  The time difference between the two is a small\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfraction of a second which is insignificant to most users.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to the Charities Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, third, the Charities Act requires the trustee of an\r\n\r\norganisation  which wishes to be conferred charitable  status\r\n\r\nto  register  it  with  the Commissioner  of  Charities  with\r\n\r\nsupporting  documents.   In addition,  a  registered  charity\r\n\r\nwhich  is  amending its trust deeds or any  other  registered\r\n\r\nparticulars, or is no longer in operation is also required to\r\n\r\ninform  the  Commissioner of the change.  Failure  to  comply\r\n\r\nconstitutes an offence.  However, as the Act is silent on the\r\n\r\ntime   frame   for   compliance,   the   Commissioner   faces\r\n\r\ndifficulties in enforcing these requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 seeks to amend the Charities Act by formalising\r\n\r\nthe  operational  procedures adopted by the  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nCharities   since  1997.   Unless  an  extension  is   given,\r\n\r\nregistration  and provision of all relevant  information  and\r\n\r\ndocuments will have to be completed within three months  from\r\n\r\nthe establishment or incorporation of the charity.  A charity\r\n\r\nthat has ceased to be a charity or has amended its trust deed\r\n\r\nor   any  other  registered  particulars  should  notify  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner within seven days of the change.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, under the Chemical Weapons Convention, Singapore\r\n\r\nis  required  to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction  over\r\n\r\nour  citizens  who  engage  in  activities  contravening  the\r\n\r\nConvention.   Clause 4 amends the Act to make it  clear  that\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Courts has jurisdiction to try such acts  done\r\n\r\nor  omitted  to be done outside Singapore by any  citizen  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment to the Singapore Academy of Law Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 seeks to amend the Singapore Academy of Law\r\n\r\nAct  to  allow  the  Academy to circulate  summary  financial\r\n\r\nstatements to its members.  On request of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany  member, the full financial statements will be  available\r\n\r\nfor inspection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 also provides for rules to be made so that the\r\n\r\nAcademy  need not circulate the summary financial  statements\r\n\r\nto  certain specified classes of members, for example,  those\r\n\r\nwhose  membership  has been suspended.   This  has  not  been\r\n\r\nfinalised  yet,  but will be finalised  in  the  rules.   The\r\n\r\nclause  also  provides for rules to prescribe the  conditions\r\n\r\nunder which these statements may be circulated as well as the\r\n\r\ninformation to be contained in the statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment  to  the Intellectual Property Office of  Singapore Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, clause 11 amends the Third Schedule of the\r\n\r\nIntellectual  Property Office of Singapore  Act  by  deleting\r\n\r\n\"65\"  in item 3 from the Schedule.  The Third Schedule  lists\r\n\r\ndown offences in the Registered Designs Act, Trade Marks  Act\r\n\r\nand Patents Act, the proceedings of which may be conducted by\r\n\r\nan  officer duly authorised in writing by the Chief Executive\r\n\r\nof  the  Intellectual  Property  Office  of  Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nreference to section 65 of the Registered Designs Act  should\r\n\r\nbe  removed  as the section deals with falsification  of  the\r\n\r\nRegister,  which  is  a serious offence involving  fraud  and\r\n\r\ndishonesty.  The equivalent provisions in the Trade Marks Act\r\n\r\nand Patents Act were not included in the Schedule.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment  to  the NUS Act and Institute of  Southeast  Asian Studies Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 amends the National University of Singapore\r\n\r\nAct  by replacing the words \"Vice-Chancellor\", \"Deputy  Vice-Chancellor\"  and \"Bursar\" with \"President of the University\",\r\n\r\n\"Deputy President of the University\" and \"the chief financial\r\n\r\nofficer of the University\" respectively.  Consequent to  this\r\n\r\namendment,  clause  10  seeks  to  amend  the  Institute   of\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asian  Studies Act by replacing  the  word  \"Vice-Chancellor\" with \"President\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now briefly outline the rest of the\r\n\r\namendments which are in the nature of tidying up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other Miscellaneous Amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the restructuring and privatisation of Government\r\n\r\nhospitals,  the references in a number of Acts to \"Government\r\n\r\nhospitals\"  and  \"health officers\"  in  the  service  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment are obsolete.  Hence, consequential amendments are\r\n\r\nproposed  to  the Infectious Diseases Act, the Motor-Vehicles\r\n\r\n(Third-Party  Risks and Compensation) Act, the  Prisons  Act,\r\n\r\nthe   Private   Hospitals  and  Medical  Clinics   Act,   the\r\n\r\nTermination  of Pregnancy Act and the Voluntary Sterilisation\r\n\r\nAct to omit such references.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends section 106D of the Companies Act to\r\n\r\ninclude  a  reference to \"units\" of shares and debentures  in\r\n\r\nthe  definition  of  \"sophisticated  investor\".   This  is  a\r\n\r\nconsequential  amendment  to  those  made  in  the  Companies\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Act 2000 which came into effect on 22nd  January\r\n\r\n2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 seeks to reinstate the definition of the term\r\n\r\n\"construction  works\" in the Employment  of  Foreign  Workers\r\n\r\nAct.   Presently, this term is explained as having  the  same\r\n\r\nmeaning  as  the same term used in the Construction  Industry\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board (\"CIDB\") Act.  As the CIDB Act was repealed\r\n\r\nin  1999, this amendment seeks to define \"construction works\"\r\n\r\nas used in its entirety in the CIDB Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 amends section 2 of the Housing Developers\r\n\r\n(Control and Licensing) Act by deleting the words \"section  4\r\n\r\nof\"  from the definition of \"housing developer\" as a  banking\r\n\r\nlicence is no longer issued under section 4.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lastly, clause 16 amends section 18(d) of the\r\n\r\nRegistered  Designs Act by replacing the word \"Gazette\"  with\r\n\r\nthe  words \"prescribed manner\".  This will enable the  notice\r\n\r\nof   registration  and  representation  of  a  design  to  be\r\n\r\npublished in the manner prescribed by rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just a very short\r\n\r\nclarification.   It  is  regrettable that,  in  NUS,  we  are\r\n\r\nchanging  the  title of \"Vice-Chancellor\" to \"President\".   I\r\n\r\naccept  it  as part of moving with the time.  My question  is\r\n\r\nwhether  the  title \"Chancellor\" was defined in NUS  as  well\r\n\r\nbecause my understanding is that, if I recall correctly,  the\r\n\r\nPresident of the Republic is the Chancellor of the  NUS.   So\r\n\r\nif  we change \"Vice-Chancellor\" to \"President\", \"Deputy Vice-Chancellor\" to \"Deputy President\", are we retaining the title\r\n\r\nof  \"Chancellor\"?  And if we do, the new order  list  in  the\r\n\r\nuniversity with Chancellor and President, then it seems  that\r\n\r\nwe have got a mixture of two cultures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, this is for the parent\r\n\r\nMinistry,  Ministry  of  Education,  and  the  university  to\r\n\r\ndecide.  As the amendment only relates to Vice-Chancellor,  I\r\n\r\nwould  take  it  that  the  word \"Chancellor\"  remains.   The\r\n\r\namendment   is  for  operational  purposes.   I  think   most\r\n\r\nuniversities  in  the  world  are  moving  towards  the  term\r\n\r\n\"President\".   So  in  terms  of easy  recognition  and  easy\r\n\r\nfacilitation  of dialogue and other operational matters,  the\r\n\r\nuniversity deems it better to change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Assoc.

I  have  also  taken   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  incorporate seven other  amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nIncome Tax Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax Changes Announced in the 2001 Budget Statement</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall begin with the tax changes announced in the 2001\r\n\r\nBudget Statement. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) To help us maintain our tax competitiveness and\r\n\r\nlower  the  tax  burden of businesses, a  new  corporate  tax\r\n\r\nregime  will be introduced from the Year of Assessment  2002.\r\n\r\nThere are two components to this:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) a reduction of the corporate income tax rate by one\r\n\r\npercentage point to 24.5%;  and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) a tax exemption scheme for companies whereby three-quarters of up to the first $10,000 of a company's chargeable\r\n\r\nincome, and one-half of up to the next $90,000 will be exempt\r\n\r\nfrom corporate tax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 17, 23 and 25 to 30 amend the Act to provide for\r\n\r\nthese changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) To reduce the tax burden of individuals, as well as\r\n\r\nto reward individual effort and enterprise, individual income\r\n\r\ntax  rates will be reduced by between two and five percentage\r\n\r\npoints.  Clause 31 amends the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Because of the good performance of the economy in\r\n\r\n2000,  I had announced a one-off, across-the-board rebate  of\r\n\r\n10%  on  individual income tax to share the  budget  surplus.\r\n\r\nClause 32 amends the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) To encourage businesses to make the best use of\r\n\r\ntechnology,  a  tax write-down of allowances  over  a  5-year\r\n\r\nperiod  has  been  granted  for certain  capital  expenditure\r\n\r\nincurred  to  acquire approved intellectual property  rights.\r\n\r\nClause 15 amends the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) To encourage self-employed persons to save more for\r\n\r\ntheir  retirement by voluntarily contributing more  to  their\r\n\r\nCPF\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccounts, I announced an increase in the tax exemption  limit\r\n\r\nfor  CPF  contributions made by the self-employed  such  that\r\n\r\nself-employed  persons will basically receive  the  same  tax\r\n\r\nbenefits  from the CPF scheme as both employer  and  employee\r\n\r\ncombined.  This is currently 36% of their income, or $25,920,\r\n\r\nwhichever is lower.  Clauses 12 and 19 amend the Act for this\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f) To motivate employees to greater innovation and\r\n\r\nenterprise,  a  new tax exemption scheme for  employee  stock\r\n\r\noptions,  the  Company  Stock Option scheme  was  introduced.\r\n\r\nClauses 10 and 11 amend the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g) To encourage greater philanthropy, donations to\r\n\r\nInstitutions of a Public Character of shares that are  listed\r\n\r\non  the  SGX as well as unit trusts that are readily tradable\r\n\r\nin  Singapore will be made tax deductible.  Clause 18  amends\r\n\r\nthe Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax Changes Not Announced in the 2001 Budget Statement</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now move on to tax changes not announced in the\r\n\r\n<br><br>2001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Proceeds from the Disposal of Assets Held by Charities</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Government grants tax exemption on the\r\n\r\nincome  of a charity if it spends at least 80% of its  income\r\n\r\nand   donations   on  charitable  activities  in   Singapore.\r\n\r\nProceeds  from  the  disposal of  assets  are,  however,  not\r\n\r\nsubject  to the 80% spending rule.  To correct this  anomaly,\r\n\r\nclause  11  amends  the  Act  to ensure  that  all  receipts,\r\n\r\nincluding proceeds from the disposal of assets of a  charity,\r\n\r\nwill be subject to the 80% spending rule with effect from 1st\r\n\r\nJune 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Buyback of Preference shares</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment will make the tax treatment for buyback\r\n\r\nof  preference shares the same as the existing tax  treatment\r\n\r\nfor the redemption of preference shares.

Clauses  4  to  7\r\n\r\namend the relevant sections of the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Interest Income from POSBank</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the merger of POSBank and DBS Bank, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had announced that tax exemption on all  interest\r\n\r\nincome from POSBank savings deposits will continue until 31st\r\n\r\nDecember  2001.  Tax exemption would apply only to the  first\r\n\r\n$100,000 balance of each POSBank savings account-holder  from\r\n\r\n1st  January 2002 to 31st December 2004.  Before the  merger,\r\n\r\ninterest  income received from POSBank savings  deposits  was\r\n\r\ntax-exempt.  The phasing out of tax exemption was to give DBS\r\n\r\nBank  time  to  restructure POSBank's assets to yield  higher\r\n\r\nreturns,  so  that  it can offer POSBank  depositors  deposit\r\n\r\nrates  that  are  comparable  with  those  offered  by  other\r\n\r\ncommercial banks.  Clause 8(c) amends the relevant section of\r\n\r\nthe Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Third Child Maternity Leave Payment</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his National Day Rally Speech, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nannounced that Third Child Maternity leave will allow working\r\n\r\nmothers  to  take time off to bond with their  new-born  baby\r\n\r\nwithout  suffering  a loss of wages.  Third  Child  Maternity\r\n\r\nLeave  payments  will  be treated as earned  income  for  tax\r\n\r\npurposes.  With the implementation of the baby bonus and paid\r\n\r\nThird  Child Maternity Leave, the Government has also decided\r\n\r\nthat  the amount of further tax rebate granted in respect  of\r\n\r\nthird  and  fourth child born on or after 1st April  2001  be\r\n\r\nsubject  to  a  cap  of  $20,000  and  $40,000  respectively.\r\n\r\nClauses  3(b) and 24 amend the relevant sections of  the  Act\r\n\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Singapore Exchange</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Income Tax Act has been amended last year to provide\r\n\r\nfor Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExchange  Derivatives Trading Limited, which  took  over  the\r\n\r\nactivities  of  the former SIMEX, to continue  to  enjoy  tax\r\n\r\nexemption  until  2003.   Since October  last  year,  certain\r\n\r\nfunctions  of the above company had been transferred  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Exchange Derivatives Clearing Limited.  Clause 8(b)\r\n\r\namends the Act to provide for tax exemption on the prescribed\r\n\r\nincome derived by the Singapore Exchange Derivatives Clearing\r\n\r\nLimited  from  the commencement of its business  up  to  31st\r\n\r\nDecember  2003.  Additionally, the Act is amended to  provide\r\n\r\nexemption  of  dividends  paid out  of  those  exempt  income\r\n\r\nderived   by  the  Singapore  Exchange  Derivatives  Clearing\r\n\r\nLimited, subject to certain conditions.  Clause 11 amends the\r\n\r\nrelevant section of the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Annual Limits of General Provisions Made by Finance Companies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the Government decided to temporarily suspend\r\n\r\nthe  annual  limits  of general provisions  made  by  finance\r\n\r\ncompanies  for a period of two years.  As the two years  have\r\n\r\npassed, clause 13 amends the relevant section of the  Act  to\r\n\r\nreinstate these annual limits.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the last change pertains to the Supplementary\r\n\r\nRetirement Scheme (SRS).  This scheme encourages Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  save  voluntarily  over and above their  CPF  savings  by\r\n\r\nallowing a range of tax benefits.  The main tax benefits are:\r\n\r\ncontributions  to the SRS will be tax deductible,  investment\r\n\r\nreturns with the exception of dividends will accumulate  tax-free, and only 50% of the withdrawals from an SRS account  at\r\n\r\nretirement will be taxable.  Clauses 2, 3, 7, 8(a), 14, 19 to\r\n\r\n22 and 29 amend the Act for these purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I commend the Bill to the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto speak in support of this Income Tax (Amendment) Bill.  The\r\n\r\nBill\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseeks  to implement the numerous income tax changes announced\r\n\r\nby  the  Government for the FY2001 Budget.  As most of  these\r\n\r\ntax changes have been well debated in this House, I shall not\r\n\r\ndelve  into them.  However, the Bill also covers a new issue,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the  introduction of the Supplementary  Retirement\r\n\r\nScheme  (SRS).   As  this SRS has not been fully  debated  in\r\n\r\nParliament,  I  feel that it is worthwhile to  raise  certain\r\n\r\nissues  concerning the SRS so that we can have a full  debate\r\n\r\non this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Matching Contribution from Employers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my first point concerning the\r\n\r\nSRS  is that, overall, the objectives of the proposed SRS are\r\n\r\ncommendable.   Essentially, the SRS  is  meant  to  encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and residents to voluntarily contribute to their\r\n\r\nown  retirement  fund,  over  and  above  the  mandatory  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one negative impression of the SRS is that it\r\n\r\nappears to cater to and is more favourable as a tax incentive\r\n\r\nto the higher income group.  As we all know, about 70% of the\r\n\r\nlower  income group of the population do not pay income  tax.\r\n\r\nFor the lower income group, the tax savings in absolute terms\r\n\r\nare  smaller  and  less meaningful, compared  to  the  higher\r\n\r\nincome group.  But it is the lower income group that needs to\r\n\r\nsave for their retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to assist the lower income group and encourage\r\n\r\nthem  to contribute more actively to the SRS is to allow  for\r\n\r\nmatching  contribution, also on a voluntary basis,  from  the\r\n\r\nemployers.  The employers' matching contribution can be up to\r\n\r\na  limit  of  1:1 basis, but it need not be set  as  a  fixed\r\n\r\nmatching   quantum  since  it  is  meant   as   a   voluntary\r\n\r\ncontribution  from  employers.   For  example,  the  matching\r\n\r\ncontribution can be just on a 1:2 basis, or at such a rate or\r\n\r\nproportion as the employers feel appropriate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the employers' matching formula\r\n\r\nis  one of the reasons for the success of the equivalent  SRS\r\n\r\nscheme in the US.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Equal Contribution Limits for Both Locals and Foreigners</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the scheme allows the contribution of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and permanent residents of up to 15%  of  their\r\n\r\nannual  income  or $10,800.   For foreigners,  the  limit  is\r\n\r\nhigher,  at  35% of their annual income or $25,200.   Sir,  I\r\n\r\nfind  this  discrepancy  in  the  contribution  rates  rather\r\n\r\nstrange.  In fact, I find it very hard to understand.  If the\r\n\r\nintention of the Government is to encourage Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nPRs to save more for their old age, then we should allow them\r\n\r\na  higher limit.  In contrast, the foreigners do not need  to\r\n\r\nremain in Singapore and, therefore, there is no reason for us\r\n\r\nto   be  concerned  about  their  retirement  funding  needs.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a higher limit for foreigners means that they enjoy\r\n\r\nmore tax benefits.  To be consistent, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  consider  whether the  contribution  limit  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and PRs can be increased to the same  level  as\r\n\r\nfor foreigners.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Increase of Tax Exempt Limit to 100%</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the proposal is to limit the tax-exempt\r\n\r\nportion  of SRS withdrawal to only 50%.  Again, I  find  this\r\n\r\nruling  rather  strange.  If the Government  is  sincere  and\r\n\r\ntruly  wants Singaporeans and PRs to save more for their  old\r\n\r\nage,  then it would well be beneficial for the Government  to\r\n\r\nallow  100%  of  their  SRS withdrawals to  enjoy  tax-exempt\r\n\r\nstatus.   This  is the same tax-exempt basis for  normal  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions.   So  why not be more  generous?   Why  be  so\r\n\r\nstingy?  Why not allow SRS contributions to enjoy a full 100%\r\n\r\ntax  exemption upon withdrawal?  If Singaporeans and PRs  can\r\n\r\nvoluntarily  save  for their old age, then they  will  become\r\n\r\nless  of  a burden to the state.  Although I do not know  how\r\n\r\nmuch  tax will be lost if we give 100% tax-exempt benefit,  I\r\n\r\nfirmly  believe that it is worthwhile to give such a  benefit\r\n\r\nfor Singaporeans and PRs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Extension of the 62-Year-Old Age Limit</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present, the scheme restricts the contributor to\r\n\r\nan  age  limit  of  62 years.  Many older  Singaporeans  have\r\n\r\nenquired\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas   to  why  there  is  an  age  limit  of  62  years.   Why\r\n\r\ndiscriminate  against  them?  If  Singaporeans  and  PRs  are\r\n\r\nprepared  on their own to contribute to their SRS  beyond  62\r\n\r\nyears  old,  they should be encouraged to do so.  However,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that the Minister and his Ministry are  concerned\r\n\r\nwith  the  risk of round-tripping, meaning that a contributor\r\n\r\npays  money into his SRS and then withdraws money immediately\r\n\r\nat the same time, with tax benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can contain this problem by setting a moratorium\r\n\r\nof,  say,  five years on all new SRS contributions after  age\r\n\r\n62.   This way, the 5-year moratorium will ensure that  older\r\n\r\nworkers  can save for their old age and overcome the  problem\r\n\r\nof round-tripping, as they can only withdraw their money five\r\n\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to reiterate that I find the SRS scheme\r\n\r\nmeaningful.  I am in full support of the scheme.  However, as\r\n\r\ncan  be seen from the points that I have raised above, I just\r\n\r\nwish that the Government can be more generous in the benefits\r\n\r\nand  conditions for the SRS scheme, so that more Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand PRs can be encouraged to participate voluntarily.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Leong has made several\r\n\r\nproposals for changes to the SRS scheme and I will respond to\r\n\r\nthem in turn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, he says that the structure of the SRS scheme\r\n\r\nseems  to favour the higher income persons.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nassure   him  that  this  is  not  so.   I  think  Mr   Leong\r\n\r\nmisunderstands the intent of the SRS scheme.  Let me explain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, I have to stress that SRS is a\r\n\r\nsupplementary  savings scheme and not an enhancement  of  the\r\n\r\nbasic  CPF  scheme.   The  CPF  is  the  primary  scheme  for\r\n\r\nretirement  savings.  At the long-term CPF contribution  rate\r\n\r\nof   40%,   a  typical  Singaporean's  CPF  savings   provide\r\n\r\nindividuals  with a reasonable monthly retirement  income  in\r\n\r\naddition  to a fully paid-up home of his own, all  paid  from\r\n\r\nCPF savings plus additional monies for his\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmedical  needs.  However, the contributions towards  CPF  are\r\n\r\ncapped  at  a  salary  of $6,000 a month.   This  means  that\r\n\r\nearnings  beyond  this amount will not enjoy tax-free  status\r\n\r\nfor savings under the basic CPF scheme.  Thus, the SRS scheme\r\n\r\nhas  been  set  up to allow those who wish to increase  their\r\n\r\nretirement  savings  beyond what is  allowed  under  the  CPF\r\n\r\nscheme to do so.  The SRS will allow them to supplement their\r\n\r\nCPF  savings,  but on a tax-deferrable and not  a  tax-exempt\r\n\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also suggests that employers should be allowed\r\n\r\nto contribute to the SRS.  I do not think this will be a wise\r\n\r\nproposal.   Singapore  already has an employee  and  employer\r\n\r\nscheme in the CPF, totalling 40%.  Allowing employers to make\r\n\r\ncontributions to SRS would put further pressure  on  them  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  beyond  20% and thus raise their  business  cost.\r\n\r\nSRS  is  structured as a voluntary scheme and any  individual\r\n\r\ncan  choose to place part of his earned income in SRS  up  to\r\n\r\nthe  prescribed  cap.   There  is,  therefore,  no  need  for\r\n\r\nGovernment to dictate or encourage employers to pay  part  of\r\n\r\nthe wages in the form of SRS contributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong is also concerned that the higher contribution\r\n\r\ncap  allowed  for  foreigners in the SRS  would  be  seen  as\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory  against Singaporeans.  He suggests  that  the\r\n\r\nsame  cap  be  applied  to both Singaporeans  and  foreigners\r\n\r\nalike.   I  would  point  out  that  it  is  not  true   that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  treated less favourably.   Foreigners  are\r\n\r\nallowed  a  higher percentage cap on their SRS  contributions\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are not permitted to participate  in  the  CPF\r\n\r\nscheme and therefore do not enjoy the tax benefits of the CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions.   Singaporeans and PRs who contribute  towards\r\n\r\nboth  CPF and SRS will, in fact, enjoy tax reliefs of  up  to\r\n\r\n51%  of  their gross income, subject to a cap of  $6,000  per\r\n\r\nmonth.  This is, therefore, more favourable than the 35%  SRS\r\n\r\ntax relief, subject to the same cap, enjoyed by foreigners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons why foreigners are allowed to\r\n\r\nparticipate in the SRS scheme was because when the CPF scheme\r\n\r\nwas removed from them, there was concern\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the lack of a retirement scheme might discourage foreign\r\n\r\ntalents from working in Singapore.  The SRS was introduced to\r\n\r\noffset  that change.  Mr Leong also suggests that  Government\r\n\r\nshould be more generous and allow SRS withdrawals to be fully\r\n\r\ntax-exempt, instead of enjoying the tax benefit of about 50%.\r\n\r\nI believe that our SRS provisions are already very generous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we have allowed tax relief to SRS\r\n\r\ncontributions.  We also allow investment income,  except  for\r\n\r\ndividends, to accumulate tax-free and subject only 50% of the\r\n\r\nsavings withdrawn from SRS to tax, even though in the  normal\r\n\r\ntax  deferral  scheme, usually the entire  sum  withdrawn  is\r\n\r\nfully  taxed.   The  50% tax concession  on  withdrawals  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  very attractive considering that a retiree's  tax\r\n\r\nrate  is  likely to be lower than his normal terminal  salary\r\n\r\ndue to a reduction in his income after retirement.  A retiree\r\n\r\nalso  has  the option to spread out his withdrawals  over  10\r\n\r\nyears  after  retirement to further lower his tax  liability.\r\n\r\nAllowing  SRS withdrawals to be fully tax-exempt  would  make\r\n\r\nthe  SRS  scheme a completely tax-exempt scheme like the  CPF\r\n\r\nscheme.  This  would be too generous.  If it is allowed,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would indeed be seen to be favouring higher income\r\n\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong believes that the age limit of 62 should not be\r\n\r\nimposed  on participation in SRS.  He suggests that  the  age\r\n\r\ncap be lifted.  The Government, in deciding the age limit for\r\n\r\nparticipation in SRS, had to weigh the desire  of  those  who\r\n\r\nwant to withdraw their SRS savings as early as possible, with\r\n\r\nthe  accompanying  tax benefits, against those  who  want  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  the  SRS for as long as they  wish.   A  fair\r\n\r\nsolution  is,  therefore,  to  peg  the  age  limit  to   the\r\n\r\nprevailing  statutory retirement age currently at  62.   This\r\n\r\nmeans  that  beyond  62, the SRS account will  be  closed  to\r\n\r\ncontributions but the SRS savings will be freely withdrawable\r\n\r\nwithout  penalty and would enjoy a concession of being  taxed\r\n\r\nonly on 50% of the sum withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the moratorium proposal as suggested by\r\n\r\nMr Leong would be a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  solution.  The date on which  SRS  participants\r\n\r\ncan  start withdrawing their savings is also the date the new\r\n\r\ncontributions would stop.  Otherwise, as Mr Leong has  noted,\r\n\r\nthe  possibility of round tripping could arise.  I would like\r\n\r\nto  point out that the age limit for participation in the SRS\r\n\r\nwould  rise  over time along with any rise in  the  statutory\r\n\r\nretirement age in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to thank Mr Leong again for his\r\n\r\ncomments and ideas.  But as SRS has just been introduced,  we\r\n\r\nwill  monitor its progress and if improvements are  warranted\r\n\r\nthey would be introduced when appropriate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>OFFICIAL SECRETS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the\r\n\r\nBill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Official Secrets Act (OSA) guards against\r\n\r\ndisclosure of official documents and information as this  can\r\n\r\nbe  detrimental to national and public interest.   It  is  in\r\n\r\nline  with  this  objective that I am  presenting  this  Bill\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, increasingly, many governmental functions have been\r\n\r\ndevolved  to statutory bodies.  This ensures that the  public\r\n\r\nsector   continues  to  remain  nimble  and   responsive   to\r\n\r\nchallenges of the future.  This also allows statutory  bodies\r\n\r\nto  have greater flexibility to compete in the recruitment of\r\n\r\nprofessional talent by tapping external expertise from either\r\n\r\nlocal   or   overseas  organisations.    With   the   greater\r\n\r\nflexibility,  statutory  bodies  will  better  harness  their\r\n\r\nprofessional capabilities and concentrate on developing their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncore  competencies, whilst the Ministries focus on  the  core\r\n\r\nfunctions  of  policy planning and resource  allocation.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  MINDEF is better able to concentrate  on  the  core\r\n\r\nMinistry   functions   of   policy  planning   and   resource\r\n\r\nallocation,  while  the statutory body, Defence  Science  and\r\n\r\nTechnology   Agency   (DSTA)   focuses   on   providing   the\r\n\r\ntechnological and engineering support to the Singapore  Armed\r\n\r\nForces.  Similarly, MTI is able to better focus on policy and\r\n\r\nplanning  in  maintaining Singapore's competitiveness,  while\r\n\r\nthe  statutory bodies, EDB and TDB, concentrate on increasing\r\n\r\nforeign direct investments and trade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this devolution of functions results in officers in\r\n\r\nthese statutory bodies having access to official information.\r\n\r\nThis  is  inevitable as the officers require this information\r\n\r\nto  discharge their functions properly and effectively.   The\r\n\r\nOSA  currently  only covers Ministries.  To ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the OSA continue to cover these officers, it is\r\n\r\nnecessary to extend the scope of the Act to include selective\r\n\r\nstatutory bodies.  Prior to conversion into a statutory body,\r\n\r\nsuch  information would have been handled by the officers  as\r\n\r\nMinistry  officials  and  therefore covered  under  the  OSA.\r\n\r\nHence,  what  this Bill essentially does is  to  restore  the\r\n\r\nposition to what it was before the formation of the statutory\r\n\r\nbodies.   It  also extends coverage to new matters  that  the\r\n\r\ndesignated  statutory bodies may cover.   There  is  thus  no\r\n\r\nchange  to  the  substantive scope of the  OSA's  provisions.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  some  of  these  selected  statutory  bodies  are\r\n\r\ncovered  by  the  statutory bodies and Government  companies'\r\n\r\nProtection  of  Secrecy Act (PSA) but the  scope  of  PSA  is\r\n\r\nnarrower than the OSA.  This is not satisfactory in so far as\r\n\r\nofficial  information vital to national security and national\r\n\r\ninterest  is  concerned.   Hence,  these  selected  statutory\r\n\r\nbodies are now placed under the OSA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to amend the OSA by introducing a\r\n\r\nSchedule   of  Organisations  comprising  selected  statutory\r\n\r\nbodies and DSO National Laboratories to be protected\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder  the  OSA.   In  this way, the provisions  relating  to\r\n\r\nwrongful  communication  of  information,  falsification   of\r\n\r\nreports,   forgery,  personation  and  possession  of   false\r\n\r\ndocuments  will apply to these organisations.  The  President\r\n\r\ncan amend this Schedule from time to time by notification  in\r\n\r\nthe Gazette.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MHA has consulted all the Ministries to identify\r\n\r\nthe  statutory bodies under their charge that handle official\r\n\r\ninformation vital to national security or national  interest.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  the  Monetary Authority of  Singapore  handles\r\n\r\ninformation  which can impact economic security and  contains\r\n\r\nmarket   sensitivities.   CISCO  has   access   to   official\r\n\r\ninformation relating to national safety and security such  as\r\n\r\nthe  protection of key installations.  Similarly,  the  other\r\n\r\nlisted   organisations   deal   with   official   information\r\n\r\npertaining  to  their  domain of work.   DSO,  whilst  not  a\r\n\r\nstatutory  body,  has  been included because  it  engages  in\r\n\r\nsensitive  defence  research and  development  programmes  to\r\n\r\nprovide  cutting  edge technologies and capabilities  to  the\r\n\r\nSAF.   It  therefore  requires a high  degree  of  access  to\r\n\r\ncritical   and  sensitive  information  relating   to   SAF's\r\n\r\ndevelopments and plans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these amendments, we aim to ensure that\r\n\r\nofficial  information continues to be properly protected  and\r\n\r\nmanaged.  This can only be for Singapore's good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Assoc.

The current provision  enables  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  prescribe a rebate on all or any  part  of  tax\r\n\r\npayable for vehicles in accordance with their class, category\r\n\r\nor description.  However, there is currently no express power\r\n\r\nto impose conditions in the grant of such rebates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 11A of the RTA to allow for the\r\n\r\nissue  of  supplementary licences for all motor vehicles  and\r\n\r\nnot  just  motorcars.  This will enable the  Vintage  Vehicle\r\n\r\nScheme  to  be administered under this section  of  the  Act.\r\n\r\nUnder  this  scheme, vintage vehicles, ie, those manufactured\r\n\r\nbefore  1940,  are  exempted from the payment  of  additional\r\n\r\nregistration fee and COE, but they are restricted in usage to\r\n\r\n28  days per calendar year.  Owners are required to pay a fee\r\n\r\nfor the supplementary licence when the vehicle is used on the\r\n\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, vehicle owners are currently given a 14-day grace\r\n\r\nperiod to renew their vehicle's road tax licence from date of\r\n\r\nexpiry.   Although no late penalty fee is levied during  this\r\n\r\nperiod, a vehicle with an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpired licence is prohibited from being used or kept on  any\r\n\r\nroad.   As  the compulsory insurance requirement  is  checked\r\n\r\nonly  at  the  point of road tax renewal, it is difficult  to\r\n\r\ntell  whether vehicle owners who renew their road tax licence\r\n\r\nlate  actually  have the requisite insurance coverage  during\r\n\r\nthe grace period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From records, an average of about 30% of the road tax\r\n\r\nrenewals  are effected during this grace period.   To  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  number  of late renewals and the possibility  that  such\r\n\r\nvehicles  may  be  driven without proper  insurance  coverage\r\n\r\nduring the grace period, it is proposed to abolish the 14-day\r\n\r\ngrace  period.   Such  a move is in the  interest  of  public\r\n\r\nsafety.   Clause 4 therefore allows for the imposition  of  a\r\n\r\nlate penalty fee if the motorist fails to renew his road  tax\r\n\r\nlicence upon expiry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends section 28 to empower the Registrar to\r\n\r\nissue general licences in respect of all vehicles instead  of\r\n\r\nonly  motor  vehicles, and to suspend and  revoke  a  general\r\n\r\nlicence  in certain circumstances.  Clause 5 also aligns  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  licensing provisions with those under  the  proposed\r\n\r\nsection  28A  pertaining to special  purpose  licences.   For\r\n\r\nMembers'  information,  such general licences  are  currently\r\n\r\nissued only to manufacturers, repairers and dealers of  motor\r\n\r\nvehicles.   They are for temporary use on new and  unlicensed\r\n\r\nvehicles  when they are driven on the roads to  be  sent  for\r\n\r\nservicing  or  repairs  before they  are  registered  or  re-licensed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 30th May 2001, the Minister for Communications\r\n\r\nand  Information Technology announced that the Land Transport\r\n\r\nAuthority (LTA) and the Economic Development Board (EDB) were\r\n\r\nworking  on  a  scheme  to  encourage  companies  to  conduct\r\n\r\nresearch and development in vehicle technologies here.  Under\r\n\r\nthis scheme, to be called the Transport Technology Innovation\r\n\r\nand  Development Scheme (TIDES), new generation vehicles such\r\n\r\nas   fuel-cell  and  hybrid  vehicles  can  be  brought  into\r\n\r\nSingapore for test-bedding and research\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  development purposes.  Since exemptions to  Certificates\r\n\r\nof  Entitlement  and  Additional  Registration  Fee  will  be\r\n\r\ngranted  to  vehicles under this scheme,  LTA  and  EDB  will\r\n\r\nensure  that only vehicles used for test-bedding and research\r\n\r\nand  development  purposes will be granted  such  exemptions.\r\n\r\nThis scheme is not meant to support commercial operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped that Singapore, with its excellent IT and\r\n\r\nphysical  infrastructure, will be regarded by  many  Original\r\n\r\nEquipment Manufacturers (OEMs) as an ideal location for test-bedding  and  development  of Intelligent  Transport  Systems\r\n\r\n(ITS).   To  facilitate the implementation  of  this  scheme,\r\n\r\nclause  6  of the Bill amends the Road Traffic Act  (RTA)  by\r\n\r\ninserting   a  new  section  28A  to  permit  car   equipment\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  and  R&D institutions  to  apply  for  special\r\n\r\npurpose licences for vehicles to be used for such purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vehicles under this scheme must meet all prevailing\r\n\r\nvehicle  safety  and emission standards before  they  can  be\r\n\r\nlicensed.   Inspection requirements are imposed  before  they\r\n\r\ncan  be  used for testing on public roads.  This will  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the vehicles meet Singapore's roadworthiness and safety\r\n\r\nstandards.   The amendments in clause 6 also require  special\r\n\r\npurpose  licence  vehicles  to  possess  a  valid  policy  of\r\n\r\ninsurance during the period of licence in compliance with the\r\n\r\nrequirements under the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks  and\r\n\r\nCompensation) Act (Cap. 189).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, motorists in arrears of road tax are liable to be\r\n\r\ncharged  in Court for keeping or using a vehicle without  the\r\n\r\nrequisite   road   tax   vehicle  licence.    Under   current\r\n\r\nprovisions, the Court has powers to impose a fine  for  these\r\n\r\noffences,  but  is  not empowered to make an  order  for  the\r\n\r\npayment  of road tax arrears.  This results in many motorists\r\n\r\ndelaying  the  payment  of the arrears after  settling  their\r\n\r\ncourt fines. Clause 8 therefore creates a new section 29A  to\r\n\r\nempower  the  court  convicting any person  charged  with  an\r\n\r\noffence  under section 15 or 29 to order such person  to  pay\r\n\r\nany outstanding road\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntax.  If the person defaults, the arrears can be recovered in\r\n\r\nthe same manner as the recovery of fines.  This new provision\r\n\r\nis  in line with existing provisions in the Road Traffic Act,\r\n\r\nwhich allow the Court to order convicted motorists to pay  up\r\n\r\nany arrears of Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) or Vehicle Entry\r\n\r\nPermit (VEP) charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 repeals section 72 as it deals with an offence\r\n\r\nalready  covered by the Environmental Pollution  Control  Act\r\n\r\n(Cap.  94A).  The Ministry of the Environment (ENV) has taken\r\n\r\nover  enforcement against vehicles emitting  excessive  smoke\r\n\r\nsince  June 1999.  The offences for excessive smoke  emission\r\n\r\nare  now  set  out  in  the Environmental  Pollution  Control\r\n\r\n(Vehicular Emissions) Regulations 1999, which is administered\r\n\r\nby ENV.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, vehicle seizure powers under section 95 of the RTA\r\n\r\ncan  only  be  invoked  when there  is  a  person  using  the\r\n\r\noffending  vehicle, or when there is reasonable  belief  that\r\n\r\nthe  vehicle  is  being used at the point of  seizure.   This\r\n\r\nhampers  enforcement  action when  such  vehicles  are  found\r\n\r\nparked or unattended on public roads.  Some of these vehicles\r\n\r\ninclude   de-registered  or  unregistered  vehicles,  foreign\r\n\r\nregistered  vehicles without requisite licences, eg,  Vehicle\r\n\r\nEntry Permit, or with outstanding ERP notices, vehicles  with\r\n\r\nfalse  number plates and engine chassis discrepancy  detected\r\n\r\nat  Inspection Centres and authorised scrap yards.  Clause 12\r\n\r\ntherefore amends section 95 to enable powers of seizure to be\r\n\r\nexercised  even though the owner, driver or person in  charge\r\n\r\nof the vehicle is not present.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of the Bill repeals and re-enacts section 100\r\n\r\nto  relocate  the  classification and description  of  public\r\n\r\nservice  vehicles (PSVs) as the second schedule to  the  RTA,\r\n\r\nwhich  is created by clause 19.  The schedule may be  amended\r\n\r\nfrom  time to time by LTA by order published in the  Gazette.\r\n\r\nWith  rapid developments in the motor vehicle industry,  such\r\n\r\nclassifications  and  descriptions are  best  set  out  in  a\r\n\r\nschedule,  which allows greater flexibility  to  make  timely\r\n\r\namendments as required.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 creates a new section 123A that will enable\r\n\r\nLTA  to  remove  stationary vehicles  from  the  expressways.\r\n\r\nUnder  section  123  of the RTA, powers to remove  stationary\r\n\r\nvehicles and to collect towing charges presently reside  only\r\n\r\nwith the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP).  Since 1998, as\r\n\r\nan  interim measure, the DCP has authorised LTA to  tow  such\r\n\r\nvehicles under the Expressway Monitoring and Advisory  System\r\n\r\n(EMAS).    The   new  section  123A  will  empower   LTA   to\r\n\r\ncompulsorily  tow stationary vehicles found  on  expressways,\r\n\r\nregardless  of whether the cause is a breakdown,  abandonment\r\n\r\nor  the commission of an offence.  This will ensure that  any\r\n\r\nobstruction  or  hazard  on  the expressway  can  be  removed\r\n\r\nquickly.   Clause  14  further makes it an  offence  for  any\r\n\r\nunauthorised  person to tow away any stationary vehicle  from\r\n\r\nan  expressway tunnel.  This is to ensure safety for both the\r\n\r\ntowing operator and the other motorists using the tunnel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, clause 16 inserts a new section 131A to\r\n\r\ninclude   additional   modalities  for   serving   prescribed\r\n\r\ndocuments.   This will facilitate the serving of notices  and\r\n\r\nsummonses.   It  replaces sections 131(3) and  (4)  that  are\r\n\r\ndeleted by clause 15.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill contains several amendments, the primary\r\n\r\nobjective  being to keep the legislation relevant to  support\r\n\r\nnew  developments  in technology and improve  procedures  for\r\n\r\nbetter administration and more effective enforcement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  clause  4 of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill  removes\r\n\r\nthe  14-day grace period prior to the composition of the late\r\n\r\npenalty  fee  for the renewal of road tax.  The 14-day  grace\r\n\r\nperiod has been given for a long time for owners to renew the\r\n\r\nroad  tax  licence from the date of expiry.   There  are  all\r\n\r\nkinds  of  reasons why an owner may not be able to renew  the\r\n\r\nlicence on time.  Why can the Minister not continue with  the\r\n\r\nexisting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicy?  As the grace period has been granted for so long and\r\n\r\nnot to make things more difficult for the owners, why can  it\r\n\r\nnot be continued?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a vehicle with an expired road tax is driven\r\n\r\nwithout  insurance  cover, it is  a  different  matter.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should not make it less flexible than  it  is  at\r\n\r\npresent.   How many of such cases were there last  year  when\r\n\r\ncars with expired road tax without insurance were involved in\r\n\r\naccidents without insurance recourse?  How does the  granting\r\n\r\nof  a  14-day grace period affect public safety on the roads?\r\n\r\nIs  a  car  without a current road tax inherently less  safe?\r\n\r\nOr,  by stretching the logic, does a car with a one year road\r\n\r\ntax safer than a car with a six months road tax?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is on clause 8 which empowers the court\r\n\r\nto  order  payment for road tax arrears in addition to  court\r\n\r\nfines.  Under the present regulations, if a person is charged\r\n\r\nin  court for using a vehicle without the required road  tax,\r\n\r\nthe  court has only powers to impose a fine for the  offence.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  empowered to order for payment of road  tax.   I\r\n\r\nshould point out that the road tax due should not be taken as\r\n\r\narrears.    Or, if it were, it should only be considered  for\r\n\r\nthat  part  that was due up to the time when the  person  was\r\n\r\ncaught  driving without the road tax.  Technically, the  road\r\n\r\ntax licence runs over a certain currency period.  I am not  a\r\n\r\nlawyer  here.   The  professors of  law  in  this  House  may\r\n\r\nclarify, but I plead for moderation in applying fines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is on clause 11 which repeals section 72\r\n\r\nof the Road Traffic Act.  This matter is now being dealt with\r\n\r\nunder  the  Environmental Pollution Control Act.   I  am  not\r\n\r\nsure.   Perhaps the Minister could clarify who is  now  going\r\n\r\nafter  all the excessive smoky vehicles  that we see  running\r\n\r\non  the roads.  In the days when it was not an offence making\r\n\r\na  phone  call  while driving on the road, I could  tell  the\r\n\r\nMinister  that I had been one ever eager to make phone  calls\r\n\r\nto  the  Police  on  these smoky vehicles when  I  saw  them.\r\n\r\nNowadays,  I just see them passing by.  And I must  say  that\r\n\r\nthe Police has been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery  efficient in the handling of such reports, at least  at\r\n\r\nthe  receptionist  end.  They always give me  the  impression\r\n\r\nthat  the culprits will be caught. I wonder, with this  shift\r\n\r\nto  ENV,  how  would  the patrolling  of  these  vehicles  be\r\n\r\nhandled.  Does the ENV maintain a group of patrol vehicles on\r\n\r\nthe look out for these smoky vehicles on the roads?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of the Bill and  not\r\n\r\nto answer the tough legal questions raised by the Chairman of\r\n\r\nthe GPC on Communications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I only have a couple of points to make regarding\r\n\r\nclause  14 which inserts a new section 123A into the existing\r\n\r\nlegislation,  so  as to give the authority or  an  agent  the\r\n\r\npower to tow vehicles away from expressways.  I am sure  that\r\n\r\neveryone agrees with the policy to remove stationary vehicles\r\n\r\nfrom   expressways.   Such  vehicles  pose  serious  hazards,\r\n\r\nespecially  where  the  road  shoulders  are  not  too  wide.\r\n\r\nHowever, I seek clarification from the Minister about the new\r\n\r\nprovision  as set out in clause 14.  First, why  is  there  a\r\n\r\nneed  to  provide additionally for removal of  vehicles  from\r\n\r\nexpressways  when  the  original  provision  in  section  123\r\n\r\nalready  provides  for  removal  of  vehicles  generally   in\r\n\r\ncircumstances such as where the vehicles cause unnecessary or\r\n\r\nunreasonable  obstruction to traffic or otherwise  causing  a\r\n\r\nhazard?   It is quite easy in my view to include LTA officers\r\n\r\nwithin this main section.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the new section 123A, subsection (2), imposes\r\n\r\nthe duty on the authority or its agent to take the vehicle to\r\n\r\na parking place, that is, near to that part of the expressway\r\n\r\nfrom which the vehicle is removed.  Why impose such a duty on\r\n\r\nthe  authority?  It can be inconvenient both to the authority\r\n\r\nand  to the driver.  In any case, the provision seems  to  be\r\n\r\nimprecise.   What does it mean to be \"near\"?  How  would  the\r\n\r\ndriver  know which parking place his car has been  towed  to?\r\n\r\nTo avoid doubt and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconfusion,  would it be better to designate car  parks  where\r\n\r\nthe LTA or its agent would tow vehicles to?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there is a requirement that the owner would be\r\n\r\ngiven  notice in writing of the removal and location  of  the\r\n\r\ncar.   If  a car owner of a stalled vehicle on the expressway\r\n\r\nwere   to  leave  the  vehicle  unattended  while  he  sought\r\n\r\nassistance,  he might well return to find his car  no  longer\r\n\r\nthere.   What does he do?  Does he wait at home for a  notice\r\n\r\nin  writing  to arrive at his doorstep?  How long would  that\r\n\r\ntake?   Would this not cause unnecessary anxiety?  The  first\r\n\r\nsensible  response of any driver would be to  report  to  the\r\n\r\nPolice that the car is missing, presumed stolen.  Would  this\r\n\r\nnot  create  additional work unnecessarily for everyone,  for\r\n\r\nthe  authority, for the Police, for the owner of the vehicle?\r\n\r\nWhy  can there not be a simpler mechanism, say, a number  for\r\n\r\nall  drivers  to call to find out whether the  car  has  been\r\n\r\ntowed away by the authority legally and, if so, where has  it\r\n\r\nbeen towed to or whether it has been stolen?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is a special provision barring the towing\r\n\r\nof vehicles from any, and I quote, \"tunnel forming part of an\r\n\r\nexpressway\" other than by the authority or its agent.   First\r\n\r\nof  all,  how does one know whether a tunnel is  part  of  an\r\n\r\nexpressway or not?   And secondly, why should a car owner not\r\n\r\nbe  allowed to arrange for the towing away of his vehicle  if\r\n\r\nthat can be done in safe circumstances?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope some of these issues would be thoroughly\r\n\r\naddressed as the implementation of this provision may be  the\r\n\r\nsource of confusion and frustration to the motoring public if\r\n\r\nthe  operational  issues are not sorted  out.   The  motoring\r\n\r\npublic should be properly informed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill  keeps\r\n\r\nour legislation relevant to the support of the development in\r\n\r\nland  transport technologies, and is in keeping with our  on-going efforts to improve procedures for better administration\r\n\r\nand more effective enforcement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to comment on the proposed new\r\n\r\nsection  123A, subsection (9), which states that the  surplus\r\n\r\nfrom the sale or disposal of the vehicle under subsection (8)\r\n\r\nshall  be forfeited by the Government when it is not  claimed\r\n\r\nby  the vehicle owner.  My suggestion is that the surplus  be\r\n\r\ndonated  to  charity,  as is the case  of  unclaimed  lottery\r\n\r\nprizes.  This will send a clear signal to the public that the\r\n\r\nprimary intention of the Government is administrative, and it\r\n\r\nis  an effective solution to the problem at hand.  It is  not\r\n\r\njust that Government is after their money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would also avoid criticism that the Government has\r\n\r\nactually  profited out of the convenience of  the  legislated\r\n\r\nlaws.  Members of the public who fail to collect the  sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney  due  to them would be less unhappy with the Government\r\n\r\nbecause the money has actually been turned over to charity as\r\n\r\nprovided  for under the law.  Should the Minister agree  that\r\n\r\nthe  unclaimed  surplus go to charity, then there  should  be\r\n\r\ncorresponding  amendments to section 123, subsection  (5)  of\r\n\r\nthe principal Act which also deals with a similar issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to comment on the new subsection (8)\r\n\r\nof section 123A.  It provides that if the Government wants to\r\n\r\nsell  the  vehicle under subsection (2), it has to  give  one\r\n\r\nmonth's  notice  in  the Government  Gazette.   On  this,  my\r\n\r\npersonal  view is that most of our people do not have  access\r\n\r\nto  the  Government Gazette.  They do not read the Government\r\n\r\nGazette at all.  I propose that the authority should at least\r\n\r\nnotify  the  vehicle owners in writing of  its  intention  to\r\n\r\ndispose  of or sell the vehicle to recover cost, and this  is\r\n\r\nsimilar to that of subsection (4).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on a few issues relating to\r\n\r\nthe new section 131A.  I can appreciate that the proposed new\r\n\r\ninsertion  aims to provide the authority with  more  ways  to\r\n\r\nserve  its  notices  and summonses on the  people  concerned.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it  does  not adequately address  the  difficulties\r\n\r\narising from the service of these notices or summonses.   The\r\n\r\nmost  common complaint from the people on the ground is  that\r\n\r\nthey did not receive the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnotices  or  summonses  in the first  instance  due  to  many\r\n\r\nreasons, and as a result, they had to pay heavier penalties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of summonses sent through registered mail,\r\n\r\nthe  problem is that most of the time there is no one at home\r\n\r\nand the intended recipient of the registered letter has to go\r\n\r\nto  the  designated  post office to  collect  his  notice  or\r\n\r\nsummons,  and  they have to go during working hours.   If  he\r\n\r\ndrives, he has to find a parking lot, and if there are a  lot\r\n\r\nof  people,  he has to queue up to just collect the  summons.\r\n\r\nAs a result, you have a very angry man there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, in the case of the summons not\r\n\r\ncollected by the intended recipient, the authority will  have\r\n\r\nto  send another registered letter or resort to other ways of\r\n\r\nserving the summons on him.  To the best of my knowledge,  if\r\n\r\na  registered letter is not collected, the relevant authority\r\n\r\nwill summon him to court.  So most people feel that the whole\r\n\r\nprocess   is  an  unnecessary   waste  of  time,  money   and\r\n\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is in the court or at our meet-the-people\r\n\r\nsessions,  much time is spent on ascertaining the reason  why\r\n\r\nthe defendants did not receive the summonses. Sometimes we do\r\n\r\nnot  know  who  is telling the truth and who  is  lying,  and\r\n\r\nwhether they have actually received the summonses or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister can spell out clearly in the\r\n\r\nlaw  the Government's stand on the issues relating to how the\r\n\r\nnotices or summonses should be served.  I propose that  under\r\n\r\nsection 131A, we should at least cover two key principles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, all summonses, notices or orders deemed to be\r\n\r\nduly served on the intended recipients by any of the channels\r\n\r\nas provided for under the new section 131A shall be deemed to\r\n\r\nbe  duly served on the defendant concerned.  Secondly, it  is\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility  of the individual  to  ensure  that  all\r\n\r\nofficial documents sent to the address registered by him with\r\n\r\nthe  National  Registration  Office  or  the  Land  Transport\r\n\r\nAuthority  are duly acknowledged.  In other words,  the  last\r\n\r\nknown\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naddress shall suffice for the purpose of this section.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will send a clear signal to the members of the\r\n\r\npublic  that unless it is for exceptional and valid  reasons,\r\n\r\nthey cannot claim that they have not received the notices  or\r\n\r\nsummonses,  and  use  this as an excuse for  not  paying  the\r\n\r\ncomposition fine before the due date.  Then, the people  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  accept that the summonses have been duly served  on\r\n\r\nthem, and they have to pay the fines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that my above suggestions will be duly considered\r\n\r\nby the Minister.  With that, I support the Amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank\r\n\r\nall the Members for their support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me answer the queries raised by the GPC\r\n\r\nChairman.  His first point is on why should we remove the 14-day  grace period.  He is right that the 14-day grace  period\r\n\r\nwas  given  a  long, long time ago, at a time  when  possibly\r\n\r\nrenewal  notice  was not sent, or it was sent  and  it  would\r\n\r\narrive  at the recipient's home very near the date of expiry.\r\n\r\nBut  nowadays  it is a different story.  Because  of  greater\r\n\r\nefficiency,  motorists would receive the  renewal  notice  at\r\n\r\nleast  six  weeks  before the date of expiry.   So  there  is\r\n\r\nreally  no  good reason for them not to pay the road  tax  in\r\n\r\ntime.  Of course, there could be some reasons like if you are\r\n\r\noverseas  for  more than a month or so.  If  there  are  good\r\n\r\nreasons, LTA can consider waiving the penalty fee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the more important point is that, if you look at the\r\n\r\ntrend, currently, as I mentioned in my speech, 30% of vehicle\r\n\r\nowners  only  renew their road tax during  the  14-day  grace\r\n\r\nperiod.   And we do not have record to show how many of  them\r\n\r\nactually do not have insurance coverage because we only check\r\n\r\ninsurance  coverage at the point of renewal.   Therefore,  it\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  unreasonable to  expect  that  many  of  them\r\n\r\nactually  are  driving their vehicles without insurance,  and\r\n\r\nthat is a very dangerous matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  is  prudent to minimise this  possibility  by\r\n\r\nsaying that they must renew their road tax before the date of\r\n\r\nexpiry.   That  would enable LTA to check whether  they  have\r\n\r\ninsurance coverage before the road tax is renewed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, his second point is about road tax arrears. Road\r\n\r\ntax  is  payable for keeping or using a vehicle.  If a person\r\n\r\nkeeps  a  vehicle and refuses to pay the road tax  after  the\r\n\r\nroad  tax  has  expired, then he owes the  Government  money.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  anything that he owes must be paid back,  because\r\n\r\nit  is due to the State.  Currently, after a court case,  the\r\n\r\ncourt fines him, he still owes LTA money, LTA will then  have\r\n\r\nto go and recover the money by asking him to pay.  If he does\r\n\r\nnot  pay, we go to the court, take a court order to seize his\r\n\r\nvehicle  and  then auction and sell it.   So  it  is  a  long\r\n\r\nprocess.   That  is  why there are some people  who  actually\r\n\r\nignore this and they refuse to pay up the arrears even  after\r\n\r\nthe fine.  So with this amendment, the court can, at the time\r\n\r\nwhen  the fine is imposed, also order the motorist to pay  up\r\n\r\nthe arrears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chay's final point is about the enforcement of\r\n\r\npollution or smoke emission.  The enforcement is now  carried\r\n\r\nout  by ENV officers.  So LTA no longer enforces this.  I was\r\n\r\ntold  that  ENV officers will take a different approach  from\r\n\r\nthe  LTA.   In the past, LTA officers actually patrolled  and\r\n\r\nstopped vehicles and brought them for smoke testing.   But  I\r\n\r\nwas  told  that  ENV  now  would station  their  officers  at\r\n\r\nstrategic locations, use digital cameras to take pictures  of\r\n\r\nvehicles  emitting  smoke  from  the  rear,  and  then   take\r\n\r\nenforcement action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to Prof. Chin's questions. Firstly, he\r\n\r\nasked  why did we need to have an additional section 123A  if\r\n\r\nwe  already  have  section  123.  Section  123  is  currently\r\n\r\nadministered by the Traffic Police.  So LTA has to go through\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Commissioner of Police for all  the  enforcement\r\n\r\nactions.   Administratively, it is not a very efficient  way.\r\n\r\nBy  creating  section 123A, LTA would be  able,  on  its  own\r\n\r\naccord,  to take enforcement action and deal direct with  the\r\n\r\nmotorists.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked about section 123A(2), ie, taking the\r\n\r\nvehicle  to  a parking place that is near to the  expressway,\r\n\r\nwhy  did  we  impose such a duty and what was the meaning  of\r\n\r\n\"near\".   The reason why we want to remove vehicles from  the\r\n\r\nexpressway  is  to  ensure that motorists on  the  expressway\r\n\r\nwould  not be endangered by stationary vehicles.  And how  do\r\n\r\nwe carry out this duty?  We carry out this duty by appointing\r\n\r\ntowing   agents.   The  towing  agents  have  to   meet   the\r\n\r\nrequirement by getting to the scene within 10 to 15  minutes.\r\n\r\nSo  they  cannot tow the vehicles too far away  because  then\r\n\r\nthey  may  not  be  able  to fulfil this  requirement.   Some\r\n\r\nmotorists  would  want  the  tow operator  to  tow  to  their\r\n\r\nworkshops,  or  other  car parks and this  would  affect  the\r\n\r\noperation  of  the  towing operator.  As such,  the  proposal\r\n\r\nstipulates that the tow operator would only need to tow to  a\r\n\r\nplace  nearby.   In  fact, in practice, LTA  would  designate\r\n\r\nnearby  HDB and URA car parks for these vehicles to be  towed\r\n\r\nto.  Sometimes, a motorist may make a request and say instead\r\n\r\nof  this car park, why not tow to the next car park which  is\r\n\r\nmore convenient for him.  In this regard, LTA can be flexible\r\n\r\nas  long  as  the  tow  operator  feels  that  it  would  not\r\n\r\ncompromise  on its stringent time requirement.  So  the  word\r\n\r\n\"near\"  is  used  for  this purpose so  that  there  is  some\r\n\r\nflexibility on where the car park should be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Prof. Chin made a very good point on what if a\r\n\r\nmotorist is not at the scene when the vehicle is towed  away,\r\n\r\nand  what  could he do to find out what has happened  to  his\r\n\r\nvehicle.  Yes, the Bill says that he will be given a  notice.\r\n\r\nBut  Prof. Chin is right that the notice would only come  one\r\n\r\nor  two  days  later.  What he can do is  to  call  the  EMAS\r\n\r\nhotline number at 3334111, as suggested by Prof. Chin.  I  am\r\n\r\nsure a lot of motorists could see this number when they drive\r\n\r\nalong  the expressway.  LTA would publicise this number,  and\r\n\r\nif  a  motorist finds that his vehicle is not there, this  is\r\n\r\nthe number to call.  In fact, this number is manned 24 hours.\r\n\r\nOf  course, they can go to the police if they want,  but  the\r\n\r\npolice would also ask them to call the EMAS hotline number.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked how would one know whether or not a\r\n\r\ntunnel is part of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpressway.    Currently,  the  CTE  tunnels  have   signages\r\n\r\ndelineating  the entrances of the tunnels to  give  motorists\r\n\r\nadvance  notice.  With this amendment coming into  operation,\r\n\r\nthese  tunnels,  as  part of the expressway,  would  also  be\r\n\r\ngazetted and additional publicity would be given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question raised by Prof. Chin is whether, in a\r\n\r\ntunnel, the motorist can arrange for his own tow truck to tow\r\n\r\naway  the  vehicle.  Sir, motorists are allowed to use  their\r\n\r\nown  towing  service on expressways, which are  not  tunnels,\r\n\r\nprovided  that the private towing service arrives before  the\r\n\r\nEMAS   towing  service.   But  to  ensure  the   safety   and\r\n\r\nconvenience of the other motorists on the expressway,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  that stalled vehicles are towed away quickly,  and\r\n\r\nnot  be left on the carriageway or shoulders.  Therefore,  if\r\n\r\nthe  EMAS  towing service arrives first, the stalled  vehicle\r\n\r\nwould be towed away by the EMAS towing service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to a tunnel, it is a very vulnerable\r\n\r\nenvironment.   Because overseas experience has shown  that  a\r\n\r\nsmall  accident  in a tunnel could lead to a  major  disaster\r\n\r\ninvolving many casualties.  Hence, it is necessary  that  tow\r\n\r\noperators are familiar with the tunnel regulations, entrances\r\n\r\nand  exits.  They should also be equipped with first aid  and\r\n\r\nfire  fighting skills, familiar with the location  of  tunnel\r\n\r\nsafety  equipment, the safety procedures  and  assist  in  an\r\n\r\nemergency  evacuation.  LTA's appointed  towing  operator  is\r\n\r\nfully  equipped  with  the set skills and  knowledge.   Other\r\n\r\ntowing operators may not be trained to operate safely in  the\r\n\r\nCTE   tunnels.   In  addition,  the  appointed  towing   crew\r\n\r\ncomprises  two  operators, one would assist  to  recover  the\r\n\r\nstalled  vehicle,  and  the other would  ensure  that  safety\r\n\r\nprocedures,  such as the use of safety cones,  are  observed.\r\n\r\nThis  would ensure maximum safety inside the tunnel.   Unlike\r\n\r\nother  towing  companies,  they usually  have  only  one-man-operated tow crew.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come to Mr Ong Ah Heng's questions. First, he\r\n\r\nasked  why the unclaimed surplus money could not be given  to\r\n\r\ncharity  and  why  should  it go  to  the  Government.   Sir,\r\n\r\nforfeiture of unclaimed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsurplus  money  to  Government,  after  setting  off  against\r\n\r\noutstanding  charges under section 123A, is  consistent  with\r\n\r\nthe  other  fiscal provisions in RTA.  These  provisions  are\r\n\r\ncorrect  because we should not mix charity with the provision\r\n\r\nof  unclaimed money going to the Government.  The  Government\r\n\r\nwould  have  its own programme and budget for  charity  work.\r\n\r\nBut this is unclaimed money and it should go to the State.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ong asked whether, under section 123A(8),\r\n\r\npublication  by Gazette before the vehicle is  auctioned,  we\r\n\r\nshould  also make it a requirement to notify the owner before\r\n\r\nit  is  auctioned.  Let me say that this notification in  the\r\n\r\nGazette  is  a requirement before the vehicle is put  up  for\r\n\r\nauction.  But, administratively, once the vehicle is towed to\r\n\r\na  parking place, the vehicle owner will be notified, and  if\r\n\r\nhe  does  not  collect the vehicle, he will  be  reminded  to\r\n\r\ncollect  the  vehicle.  In the end, when the vehicle  is  not\r\n\r\ncollected  at all, it will then be put in the Gazette  for  a\r\n\r\nmonth  before it is auctioned.  Yes, administratively, I  can\r\n\r\nask  LTA to send another letter again to tell him that we are\r\n\r\ngoing   to   auction   his   vehicle.    We   can   do   that\r\n\r\nadministratively, but it is not required to  be  put  in  the\r\n\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Ong asked how we could make sure that people\r\n\r\nwould  not argue that they had not received the notifications\r\n\r\nor  notices of summonses.  The amendment here is to  make  it\r\n\r\nclear that,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  using one of the means indicated in serving a notice,  it\r\n\r\nis  deemed to have been served.  In fact, Mr Ong said that we\r\n\r\nshould make clear that this is so.  That is what we are doing\r\n\r\nnow,  that  is, by passing this law and publicising  it.   As\r\n\r\nlong  as  notices  are served by one of these  means,  it  is\r\n\r\ndeemed  to have been served and that it is the responsibility\r\n\r\nof  the owner to comply with the requirement of the law.   We\r\n\r\ncannot  force the owner to acknowledge whether or not he  has\r\n\r\nreceived  the  notice.   What the law requires  is  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  agency has served the notice and it is  therefore\r\n\r\nup  to  the  individual or vehicle owner to comply  with  the\r\n\r\nrequirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered all the questions and I\r\n\r\nthank Members for their support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Dr John Chen Seow Phun].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed. \"\r\n\r\n- [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Fifteen</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Minutes past Six o'clock pm</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
