Members of the House are\r\n\r\naware that from the outset of our existence, it has\r\n\r\nbeen  our  desire  to  send a goodwill  mission  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia  to clear away what one newspaper  called\r\n\r\n\"the cobwebs of suspicion and antagonism\" that have\r\n\r\nexisted  and  accumulated in  the  past  few  years\r\n\r\nbetween us. We naturally had our trade relations in\r\n\r\nmind,  for in seeking our basic aim to improve  the\r\n\r\nstandard of living of the people of this territory,\r\n\r\nwe  must  be  ever watchful to improve the  general\r\n\r\nprosperity of the island. The inspiration  for  the\r\n\r\ngoodwill  mission, however, Sir, went  well  beyond\r\n\r\nthe question\r\n\r\nof trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the principal objective of the people of this\r\n\r\nterritory - independence - is to have any real meaning,\r\n\r\nwe must now seek to lay the foundations of friendly\r\n\r\nrelations   which  will  transform  our   immediate\r\n\r\nneighbours   into  our  allies  of   tomorrow.   We\r\n\r\nrecognise  the fundamental truth that  it  will  be\r\n\r\npossible  for  us  to survive  and  prosper  as  an\r\n\r\nindependent  political entity only if we  have  the\r\n\r\nactive  and  full  and  friendly  support  of   our\r\n\r\nneighbours and the British Commonwealth of Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Rendel Constitution does not permit\r\n\r\nthis  Government an active part in foreign affairs,\r\n\r\nwe,  the  elected  Government  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore, consider  it  our  duty  to   lay   the\r\n\r\nfoundation   today  for  the  foreign   policy   of\r\n\r\ntomorrow,  with the full knowledge of Her Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment,  from  whom  we  have  received   every\r\n\r\nassistance in pursuing our policy of seeking closer\r\n\r\nfriendly relations with our neighbours\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the context of this desire on the part\r\n\r\nof  the  people of Singapore to initiate close  and\r\n\r\nfriendly relations with its neighbours, that it was\r\n\r\nnatural   that   our  first  thoughts   turned   to\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  our  closest neighbour  and  the  first\r\n\r\nterritory  in  this part of the  world  to  achieve\r\n\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the tireless efforts of the Indonesian\r\n\r\nConsul-General    in    Singapore,    Dr.    Hermen\r\n\r\nKartowisastro, and to the receptive attitude of the\r\n\r\nIndonesian Government, we received an invitation to\r\n\r\nsend  a  goodwill mission to Indonesia between  the\r\n\r\n9th and 14th September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should add that we kept the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment fully informed and, although because  of\r\n\r\nthe  manifold matters it had to deal with on taking\r\n\r\noffice  it  could  not  accept  the  suggestion  of\r\n\r\nsending  a  full  mission  jointly  with  us,   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government sent  an  observer  and  its\r\n\r\nblessings and good wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Djakarta, in Bandoeng and in Palembang the\r\n\r\nSingapore  goodwill mission was received with  full\r\n\r\nhonours and every courtesy.

As the Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\n\r\nHis Excellency Ide Anak Agoeng Gde Agoeng, put it:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Indonesia is glad to welcome the first Chief\r\n\r\nMinister of Singapore, a son of Singapore,  leading\r\n\r\nthe first elected Government of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are such close neighbours that we can almost\r\n\r\nsee  each other from our windows, and I assure  you\r\n\r\nthat  we have watched the course of development  in\r\n\r\nthe   next  house  with  great  interest  and  much\r\n\r\nsympathy.

One of the unexpected advantages  of\r\n\r\nindependence is that those who are independent  can\r\n\r\nchoose  their  own friends. We, in  Indonesia,  are\r\n\r\ndoubly  fortunate that in our closest neighbour  we\r\n\r\nhave also a good friend.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members are perhaps aware of the measure  of\r\n\r\nagreement  achieved by the goodwill  mission.  This\r\n\r\nwas  incorporated in a joint communique issued  on\r\n\r\nthe 12th of September, and it contained nine points\r\n\r\nwhich I shall read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"1. A full Economic Mission (jointly with the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya, if they so desire)  will  be\r\n\r\nwelcomed  by the Indonesian Government in  December\r\n\r\n1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. A working party will be sent by the Government\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  (jointly  with  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya, if  they so desire) in the first  half  of\r\n\r\nOctober this year for the purpose of: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) arranging the venue and date for a full Economic Mission; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) drafting the agenda of all subjects to be discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The Indonesian Government announced: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) in clarification of their new Import Regulations, that there will be no\r\n\r\ndiscrimination    against    imports     from      Singapore, including textiles;\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and,  incidentally, Sir, the same was  declared  in\r\n\r\nrespect of our neighbouring island, Hongkong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(b) a temporary relaxation, at the urgent\r\n\r\nrequest of the Singapore goodwill mission, of\r\n\r\nthe   ban  on  export  of  slab  rubber  from\r\n\r\nSumatra,  to  take  effect  as  soon  as  the\r\n\r\ndetails are worked out by the working  party.\r\n\r\nThis  relaxation is without  prejudice  to  a\r\n\r\ncompletely  new  approach  by  the   Economic\r\n\r\nMission; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) that the matter of importation of dried fish\r\n\r\nfrom   Singapore   is  being  sympathetically\r\n\r\nconsidered  in  the  context  of  Indonesia's\r\n\r\nobligations   vis-a-vis  other   neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries. Details will be discussed  by  the\r\n\r\nworking party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The Singapore Goodwill Mission announced that\r\n\r\nit  will  sympathetically consider the question  of\r\n\r\nreimbursement  in  Malayan dollars  for  Indonesian\r\n\r\nfish  and  timber imported into Singapore,  and  of\r\n\r\ntransport  facilities for fish caught in Indonesian\r\n\r\nwaters,  and  will authorise the working  party  to\r\n\r\nwork out details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The Singapore Goodwill Mission reiterated its\r\n\r\nassurance of full co-operation in establishing  and\r\n\r\nmaintaining normal, healthy trade relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The Singapore Goodwill Mission, recognising\r\n\r\nthe  basic  importance of the payments  problem  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and the part that a favourable  solution\r\n\r\ncan   play   in   stimulating  trade  between   the\r\n\r\nrespective countries, will examine at an early date\r\n\r\nthe   means   to  achieve  a  mutually   acceptable\r\n\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The Indonesian Government would welcome the\r\n\r\nappointment of a Trade Commissioner to Indonesia at\r\n\r\nan  early  date  to maintain the goodwill  achieved\r\n\r\nduring the recent talks and to serve as a permanent\r\n\r\nliaison between the respective governments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  would  add,  Sir,  that  he  was  not  referring\r\n\r\nentirely to trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"8. The Singapore Goodwill Mission stressed the\r\n\r\nimportance of closer relationships in the  cultural\r\n\r\nand educational spheres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The Singapore Goodwill Mission expressed its\r\n\r\ndeep  appreciation of the very friendly spirit  and\r\n\r\nthe  generous hospitality with which  it  has  been\r\n\r\nreceived by the Indonesian Government.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to Indonesia without expecting anything\r\n\r\nmore  than to establish a friendly climate  for  an\r\n\r\nEconomic  Mission  and it is entirely  due  to  the\r\n\r\ngoodwill of the Indonesian Government that we  have\r\n\r\ncome back with an agreement so full of promise  for\r\n\r\nour   future  relations.  One  concession  of   the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Government symbolises the goodwill  and\r\n\r\nthe friendship of Indonesia towards Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The export of slab rubber from Sumatra is\r\n\r\nprohibited  because of two reasons. Sumatra  has  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of modern factories which are quite capable\r\n\r\nof  coping  with  the slab rubber  production.  The\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Government  wishes  to  discourage  the\r\n\r\nproduction of slab rubber in order to encourage the\r\n\r\nproduction of the far more profitable sheet rubber.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when we pointed out that the  ban  on\r\n\r\nexport  of  slab  rubber meant the unemployment  of\r\n\r\nthousands    of   our   workers,   the   Indonesian\r\n\r\nGovernment,  basing  itself  on  a  policy  of  the\r\n\r\ndesirability  of  helping a neighbour  in  time  of\r\n\r\nneed,  assured  us  that  it  would  relax,  though\r\n\r\ntemporarily, the ban in order to assist us. I  know\r\n\r\nno more dramatic gesture to express the goodwill of\r\n\r\nIndonesia to the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like, in this House, as one privileged\r\n\r\nto  be  the  chief  elected representative  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, to express to the Indonesian Government the\r\n\r\ndeep  appreciation of the people of  Singapore  for\r\n\r\nthe  reception accorded to the goodwill mission and\r\n\r\nthe  friendship  that Indonesia has  shown  towards\r\n\r\nSingapore.

Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nEmergency Regulations and their use during the past\r\n\r\nfew  years  have disturbed the conscience  of  many\r\n\r\ndecent  law-abiding citizens. We, as  the  people's\r\n\r\nfirst  elected Government, in the policy speech  by\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the Governor on the first day of the\r\n\r\nsitting   of  this  House,  undertook  to   examine\r\n\r\nexhaustively  \"the  Emergency  Regulations  with  a\r\n\r\nview,  in  so far as is practicable, to  dispensing\r\n\r\nwith such powers as are no longer necessary and  to\r\n\r\nthe   exercise   of   powers  essential   for   the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of law and order within the  framework\r\n\r\nof normal legal procedure.\" We added, Sir, that \"in\r\n\r\nconsidering this matter, regard will be had to  all\r\n\r\nthe   factors  involved,  including  the  Emergency\r\n\r\nsituation in the Federation of Malaya\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, although we outlined our policy with\r\n\r\nsome caution, leaving ourselves room to retain such\r\n\r\npowers  as confidential information which might  be\r\n\r\nmade   available  to  us  might  indicate   to   be\r\n\r\nnecessary,  we  were at that time - I  will  frankly\r\n\r\nconfess - of  the view that we could sweep  away  the\r\n\r\nentire   structure  of  the  Emergency  Regulations\r\n\r\nwithout endangering the fabric of security  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  That  was  the 22nd  of  April,  1955 - five\r\n\r\nmonths ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after His Excellency's speech, Sir, we\r\n\r\nwatched  efforts  to  fan  and  twist  a  perfectly\r\n\r\nlegitimate trade dispute at the Hock Lee Bus  Depot\r\n\r\ninto  an instrument for mob violence which exploded\r\n\r\nin  the  horrible riots and brutal murders  of  May\r\n\r\n12th.  That  was  our  first  introduction  to  the\r\n\r\ntechnique of a group of hardened persons, loyal  to\r\n\r\na  foreign ideology of tyranny, who, without regard\r\n\r\nto human suffering, seek the creation of conditions\r\n\r\nof  chaos and the violent overthrow of a democratic\r\n\r\nform of government, in order to bring the people of\r\n\r\nthis territory under their control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We next witnessed, not long after, another\r\n\r\nlegitimate  strike,  this  time  at  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board,  being twisted and tortured  in  an\r\n\r\neffort to repeat the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuccess  of  the Hock Lee riots. Strenuous  efforts\r\n\r\nwere made to paralyse our economic life. It did not\r\n\r\nmatter   how  much  the  pitiable,  misled   worker\r\n\r\nsuffered,  if  only these malevolent organisers  of\r\n\r\nchaos  could  succeed in their aim of overthrow  of\r\n\r\nthe Government by mob violence and the creation  of\r\n\r\nconditions which would bring about the supremacy of\r\n\r\ntheir  brand  of ideological tyranny. But  for  the\r\n\r\nexistence  of some sincere trade unionists  in  the\r\n\r\nTrades  Union Congress, in the Naval Base,  and  in\r\n\r\nthe  docks,  there could have been an even  greater\r\n\r\nholocaust than the Hock Lee riots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a letter signed by the Member for Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah  (Mr  Lim Ching Siong) throws light  on  the\r\n\r\nconduct   of   these  pseudo-trade  unionists   who\r\n\r\norganised  the  abortive illegal strikes - I  repeat,\r\n\r\nillegal strikes - of last June. The letter was  typed\r\n\r\non  the head-note of the Singapore Factory and Shop\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Union,  149  Middle Road,  Singapore,  7,\r\n\r\ndated 12th of June, 1955, addressed to the Manager,\r\n\r\nSingapore  Cold  Storage Company, Limited,  Orchard\r\n\r\nRoad,  Singapore.  In referring  to  the  so-called\r\n\r\nsympathy strike of the workers of the Cold Storage,\r\n\r\nthis is what it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"Sir,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to notify you that the action taken by\r\n\r\nour  members  is not directed against your  Company\r\n\r\nbut  is  taken in support of the common demands  of\r\n\r\nfraternal  unions  presented to the  Government  in\r\n\r\nrespect of detained unionists.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There we have, Sir, the naive admission by the\r\n\r\nHon.  Secretary - the  name is  Lim  Ching  Siong - the\r\n\r\nadmission that the workers are made to suffer,  not\r\n\r\nin  pursuance of a trade dispute, but in  order  to\r\n\r\nblackmail the people's Government by mob coercion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a technique, Sir, of the Communists\r\n\r\nthroughout the world to infiltrate trade unions and\r\n\r\nto  work ostensibly for the welfare of the labourer\r\n\r\nin  order  to gain his confidence. Then,  when  the\r\n\r\ntime  is  considered ripe, they sacrifice him.  The\r\n\r\nMalays,  Sir, have a word for this type of  pseudo-trade unionists. They call them \"topengs\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the trade unionists at that time who was\r\n\r\ndetained,  the House will remember,  was  Yong  Kok\r\n\r\nKim,  President  of that very union  of  which  the\r\n\r\nMember\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Bukit Timah was and is the Hon. Secretary. The\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party  aliases  of  Yong  Kok  Kim,   as\r\n\r\nadmitted  by him, were Sang Swee Sen, Ah  Yong  and\r\n\r\nYong Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, is what the Member for Bukit Timah had\r\n\r\nto  say about the detention of Yong Kok Kim. I read\r\n\r\nfrom  an  article in the Straits Times  of  Monday,\r\n\r\nJuly  11, 1955, headlined \"JAIL ME TOO, SAYS  LIM\".\r\n\r\nIt  is  cheap to shout to the bushes that  you  are\r\n\r\nlooking  for wars when it is known full  well  that\r\n\r\nthis Government does not arrest arbitrarily. Let us\r\n\r\nsee  what  the statement was that the  hon.  Member\r\n\r\nissued.  In  a  statement  issued  from  the  Union\r\n\r\nHeadquarters in Middle Road, Mr Lim said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The abuse of power provided by the Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations  has  once more been displayed  by  the\r\n\r\narrest of Mr Yong Kok Kim.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Abuse of power, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I\", said Mr Lim, \"share the same beliefs and\r\n\r\nhave  the same aims as Fong Swee Suan and Yong  Kok\r\n\r\nKim. I therefore challenge the Government to arrest\r\n\r\nme too\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that was July 11, 1955. On August 24, 1955,\r\n\r\nMr Yong Kok Kim was convicted in an open court  of\r\n\r\nlaw  and sentenced to five years' imprisonment  for\r\n\r\nterrorist activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the light of this statement of the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bukit Timah - that he shares the same  aims  and\r\n\r\nthe  same beliefs as this convicted man - and in  the\r\n\r\nlight  of  the statements he has seen fit to  issue\r\n\r\ncriticising the present Bill, in lurid language,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is pertinent to enquire and to  ask  him\r\n\r\nwhether  he speaks as a man loyal to the democratic\r\n\r\nprocess   and  to  the  people  and  territory   of\r\n\r\nSingapore, or whether he speaks as a Communist  and\r\n\r\na   fellow  sympathiser  of  the  Communists.  That\r\n\r\nquestion  was  once before addressed  to  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  by  the  Hon. the Chief Secretary.  It  was\r\n\r\nevaded  with the heavy-handed technique we know  so\r\n\r\nwell.  He  said,  \"I  will not  answer  a  colonial\r\n\r\nofficial.\"  Now,  I,  Sir, who have  the  privilege\r\n\r\ntoday  of standing here in this House as the  chief\r\n\r\nof the people's representatives, ask him to declare\r\n\r\nhimself,  so  that the people will  know,  when  he\r\n\r\nspeaks about this Bill, where he stands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our examination, Sir, of the Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations,  we studied voluminous  memoranda.  We\r\n\r\nreceived   top-level   representations   from   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, and I spent some time in  the\r\n\r\nSpecial   Branch  and  its  departments   examining\r\n\r\ndocuments,  investigating  procedure,  looking   at\r\n\r\nfiles, and talking to ex-terrorists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, it is important that the hon.\r\n\r\nMembers   of   this  House  should  know   of   the\r\n\r\nrepresentations  from  the  Federation  of  Malaya.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bourne, as Chief of Operations against  the\r\n\r\nterrorists  in  the  Federation,  and  the  Defence\r\n\r\nSecretary  of  the Federation emphasised  with  the\r\n\r\nutmost  gravity that any relaxation on the part  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   in  its  laws  against  Communism   and\r\n\r\nCommunists  would mean a stab in the  back  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation. They said we would make of Singapore  a\r\n\r\nrest camp and a rearming centre for terrorists  and\r\n\r\nwould create a wide open door for them to pour into\r\n\r\nthe Federation, so that in a matter of a few months\r\n\r\nthe  security position of the Federation  could  be\r\n\r\njeopardised. To us, Sir, on this side of the House,\r\n\r\nand I hope to all in this House, the welfare of our\r\n\r\nbrothers  across the Straits is a  matter  of  very\r\n\r\nreal  and immediate concern. If there was no  other\r\n\r\nreason,  that  plea was sufficient in itself,  Sir,\r\n\r\nfor  us to exercise the utmost vigilance for  their\r\n\r\nprotection. But that plea alone, the needs  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  alone, were not the sole  reason,  Sir,\r\n\r\nfor  this Bill. After what we believe to have  been\r\n\r\ncareful  consideration - anxious consideration,  Sir,\r\n\r\non  my part - in the light of the attitude with which\r\n\r\nI  originally  approached the whole problem,  I  am\r\n\r\ntoday satisfied that this law is essential for  the\r\n\r\nprotection  of the people of this country  and  for\r\n\r\nits  nascent  democracy.  It  is  the  primary  and\r\n\r\nsupreme  duty  of a government to provide  for  the\r\n\r\nsafety and security of its citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1948 there has existed in this territory,\r\n\r\nand  to a very far larger extent in the Federation,\r\n\r\na  subversive organisation inspired by an  ideology\r\n\r\nof  tyranny and violence, which indulges in all the\r\n\r\ntechniques of murder and intimidation, and seeks to\r\n\r\noverthrow the people's government of today,  as  it\r\n\r\nsought to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noverthrow  the colonial government of yesterday.  It\r\n\r\ndoes  not  matter to these people that if they  were\r\n\r\nsuccessful,  they  would bring  ghastly  misery  and\r\n\r\nstarvation  to the whole population of Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nask  this  House  to remember this:  Singapore  eats\r\n\r\nbecause it serves the free world. If Singapore  were\r\n\r\nto become Communist, we would cut ourselves off from\r\n\r\nthose whom we serve. We would be unable to earn  our\r\n\r\nliving,  and as we produce nothing, we would  starve\r\n\r\nmiserably and suffer even more than we have suffered\r\n\r\nunder  the  Japanese occupation. But that  does  not\r\n\r\nmatter  to  these  gentlemen of  this  international\r\n\r\nsubversive  organisation  that  seeks  to  bring  us\r\n\r\nwithin  the fold of their tyranny - these people  who\r\n\r\npretend to seek the welfare of the common man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such an organisation existing and constituting\r\n\r\na  real threat to our security and to the safety  of\r\n\r\nindividuals,   the   question  remains,   Sir:   can\r\n\r\nGovernment  protect  its  citizens;  can  Government\r\n\r\nprotect the country by use of the normal process  of\r\n\r\nthe law? Justice in our Courts, Sir, is based on two\r\n\r\nfundamentals, as you are aware, and as  some  of  my\r\n\r\nhon. Friends across the floor are aware. One is that\r\n\r\nthe honest citizen, who is in the great majority  of\r\n\r\nthe  population,  99 per cent, would  be  ready  and\r\n\r\nwilling to give the Police all information he has of\r\n\r\nany  criminal activity. The second is that he  would\r\n\r\nbe  ready to give freely of his knowledge on oath in\r\n\r\nopen  court. Unfortunately, Sir, as Members of  this\r\n\r\nHouse   are  fully  aware,  this  small  but   well-disciplined  group  of  hard  core  terrorists   has\r\n\r\nsucceeded  in  a  large measure in intimidating  our\r\n\r\npopulation,  so  that  few of  them  will  volunteer\r\n\r\ninformation,  and  none of them will  come  to  open\r\n\r\ncourt  to  give  evidence  for  fear  of  his  life.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Sir, it often takes a very  long  time,\r\n\r\nsometimes  years,  to  build up  a  picture  of  the\r\n\r\nactivities of terrorists. They have many aliases  as\r\n\r\nYong Kok Kim, the President of my hon. Friend across\r\n\r\nthe floor, had - several Communist Party aliases. They\r\n\r\nhave  a  technique of changing their home addresses,\r\n\r\nand  changing their places of work, and you have  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up  the  picture from statements  by  various\r\n\r\npersons detained, who know only the aliases, and who\r\n\r\ncan give you certain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninformation;  but by the time the jigsaw  puzzle  is\r\n\r\ncomplete,   some  of  the  persons  who   gave   the\r\n\r\nstatements on which the picture is built may already\r\n\r\nhave  been  repatriated.  Sir,  I  like  it  to   be\r\n\r\nunderstood that under this law it is not a  question\r\n\r\nof  imprisonment,  it  is a question  of  preventive\r\n\r\ndetention - detention  to prevent  conduct  which  may\r\n\r\ngravely  prejudice the security and  safety  of  the\r\n\r\nState and its citizens. Very often, Sir, we consider\r\n\r\nthat  the departure of the detainee to his place  of\r\n\r\noriginal  birth would put him sufficiently far  away\r\n\r\nfrom  us  to  render  him  innocuous,  or  at  least\r\n\r\nharmless. In those circumstances, Sir, it  has  been\r\n\r\nand   will  continue  to  be  the  policy  of   this\r\n\r\nGovernment to repatriate as soon as possible as many\r\n\r\nas  we  can.  These people having been  repatriated,\r\n\r\nSir, all we have remaining are their statements, and\r\n\r\nthese often give very valuable information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no government can abdicate its duty to protect\r\n\r\nits  citizens, and since we cannot utilise the  full\r\n\r\nmagnificent judicial process and judicial  tradition\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have for the trial of these individuals\r\n\r\nwho constitute a threat to our security, we have  to\r\n\r\nseek extra-judicial means for our very survival, and\r\n\r\nyet  give  the  maximum possible protection  to  the\r\n\r\ncitizens. Sir, in this search for a law to  fit  the\r\n\r\nformula  of  the  maximum security for  the  citizen\r\n\r\nwithin  the  context of the basic  security  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry,  we have studied the laws of our neighbours\r\n\r\nwho have the same problems. I have supplied to every\r\n\r\nsingle  Member of this House copies of the  Security\r\n\r\nof  Pakistan  Act, the Preventive Detention  Act  of\r\n\r\nIndia,  and  the  Public Order Preservation  Act  of\r\n\r\nBurma. Each and every one of these laws of our great\r\n\r\nneighbours   gives  powers  to  the   Executive   of\r\n\r\npreventive  arrest and detention.  If  hon.  Members\r\n\r\nhave  studied these laws, Sir, they must admit  that\r\n\r\nthe  Bill now before this House is far and away  the\r\n\r\nmost  liberal, the most circumspect in every detail,\r\n\r\nand  the  one that gives the greatest protection  to\r\n\r\nthe  basic rights of a human being. We, on this side\r\n\r\nof  the  House, Sir, have striven with sincerity  to\r\n\r\ngive every possible protection to the honest citizen\r\n\r\nfrom  the possible abuse of executive power,  and  I\r\n\r\nventure  to say that we have done far more  in  that\r\n\r\ndirection,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  respect  to  our  neighbours,  than  all  our\r\n\r\nneighbours  combined. They are far  greater  people\r\n\r\nwith  far  longer traditions of democracy  than  we\r\n\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in Indonesia, Sir, I naturally made\r\n\r\nthe  same enquiries. This matter has been very much\r\n\r\non  my  mind, and I learned that in Indonesia  they\r\n\r\nhave  a  law  known  as S.O.B. which  provides  for\r\n\r\npreventive  arrest and detention.  Unfortunately  I\r\n\r\nhave  been unable to obtain a translation  as  yet,\r\n\r\nbut  I will certainly supply a copy to hon. Members\r\n\r\nas soon as I can get it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Government is only too anxious to give the\r\n\r\nmaximum  possible protection within the context  of\r\n\r\nthe  protection  of the people in  the  country.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that the P.A.P. and the P.A.P. - dominated\r\n\r\nunions, startled by the evidence of which they were\r\n\r\nin  ignorance - and, frankly, I have to confess,  of\r\n\r\nwhich  I  was  in  ignorance  before - that  all  our\r\n\r\nneighbours  have  these  laws  which  provide   for\r\n\r\npreventive arrest and detention - have now  come  out\r\n\r\nwith  a  strange and a fantastic explanation.  They\r\n\r\nsay  it  is  quite  all  right  for  India,  Burma,\r\n\r\nPakistan and Indonesia to have these laws. They are\r\n\r\nindependent  countries, but we  are  a  colony.  We\r\n\r\nshould  not  have  any! A colony,  it  seems,  Sir,\r\n\r\ncannot, must not, and should not legislate for  the\r\n\r\nsecurity   of   its  citizens  and  its   form   of\r\n\r\ngovernment. What a fantastic stand for a Party that\r\n\r\npretends  to hope one day to govern the  people  of\r\n\r\nthis territory!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been suggested by my Friend, the\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Timah, that this law will be  used\r\n\r\nby this Government, Sir, to perpetuate colonialism!\r\n\r\nI  am  happy  for the recent constitutional  crisis\r\n\r\nbecause,  amongst  other things, Sir,  the  private\r\n\r\ncorrespondence  between His Excellency  and  myself\r\n\r\nwas ordered to be published, and any person who has\r\n\r\nread  that  correspondence knows that the Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment  and each and every one of  the  Parties\r\n\r\nconstituting  it,  and each and every  one  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers  on this side of the House, was  ready  and\r\n\r\nwilling to sacrifice himself in order to pursue the\r\n\r\nprinciple   of  rapid  self-government   for   this\r\n\r\nterritory.  Anyone  knowing that  but  pretends  to\r\n\r\nbelieve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  this Government will use the law in order  to\r\n\r\nperpetuate colonialism is defrauding himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been some criticisms - on the face\r\n\r\nof them legitimate, and some of them, in fact, very\r\n\r\nconstructive - directed against this Bill. The first\r\n\r\none  I will deal with is that it seeks to make  law\r\n\r\nfor  three years what has so far been law for  only\r\n\r\nthree months at a time. In the past we had to renew\r\n\r\nthis  law  every  three  months.  The  question  of\r\n\r\nrenewal  of a law every three months was  based  on\r\n\r\nthe  concept of the existence of an emergency. This\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Sir,  believes  in  facing  facts.   A\r\n\r\nsituation  which  has existed for eight  years  and\r\n\r\npromises to exist for many more cannot be called an\r\n\r\nemergency.  That, Sir, is a misnomer. It  is  today\r\n\r\npart  of  the  fabric  of our  lives.  It  is  just\r\n\r\npossible,  Sir,  that the amnesty  which  has  been\r\n\r\noffered  by the Federation and ourselves may  bring\r\n\r\nabout  a  radical change in the situation. If  that\r\n\r\nhappens - I pray it happens - I will be only too  happy\r\n\r\nto  review  the  situation and  to  remove  what  I\r\n\r\nfrankly admit is an inroad in the rule of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the Singapore Government offered the\r\n\r\namnesty  because  we hope to attract  back  to  the\r\n\r\nnormal healthy democratic way those who were  loyal\r\n\r\nnationalists  but  who,  through  frustration   and\r\n\r\nbitterness  and inability to improve  the  existing\r\n\r\nconditions,  strayed into the camp of violence  and\r\n\r\ntyranny.  We  are  not hopeful  that  international\r\n\r\nCommunism  will really relax its efforts to  obtain\r\n\r\nby  violence, control of this strategic island.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  Sir, although we  cannot  see  at\r\n\r\npresent the end of the situation which requires the\r\n\r\nexistence  of this law, we wish to give this  House\r\n\r\nan   opportunity,  before  it  is   dissolved,   of\r\n\r\nreviewing the whole situation. This Government  has\r\n\r\nnever  avoided,  and so long as I survive  on  this\r\n\r\nside  will  never  avoid its responsibilities,  and\r\n\r\ninstead  of  making it four years and \"passing  the\r\n\r\nbuck\" to the next government, we will have to  face\r\n\r\nthis  House,  at  least  five  months  before   its\r\n\r\ndissolution, and review the situation. That is  the\r\n\r\nreason  for  the  three-year  period.  It  is   not\r\n\r\nintended as a permanent measure, but it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  not  conceivably a palliative for three months.\r\n\r\nLet us face it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second criticism, Sir, which has been\r\n\r\nlevelled  at the Bill is that the power  to  order\r\n\r\ndetention has been given to the Chief Secretary,  a\r\n\r\ncolonial  official. We did consider that before  we\r\n\r\ndrafted  the Bill, and it seemed to us  a  somewhat\r\n\r\ninvidious  position for the Judges  of  the  Appeal\r\n\r\nTribunal  to sit in judgment on a decision  for  an\r\n\r\norder of detention of the Council of Ministers, and\r\n\r\nwe  thought that there was sufficient protection if\r\n\r\nthe  Council of Ministers could have the  power  of\r\n\r\nreview  every six months. This criticism, Sir,  has\r\n\r\ncome  from many sides - from perfectly decent people,\r\n\r\nfrom the Press, and from some loyal trade unionists\r\n\r\nwhom  we have learnt to respect at a time when many\r\n\r\nwent  berserk. They have convinced us that, despite\r\n\r\nthe illogical position, it would be more acceptable\r\n\r\nto  give  the  power of original detention  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernor-in-Council.  Hon.  Members  have  received\r\n\r\nfrom me this morning notice of an amendment which I\r\n\r\nshall  move at the Committee stage of this Bill.  I\r\n\r\nhave accepted and acceded to the criticism, and the\r\n\r\nBill now provides that not the Chief Secretary  but\r\n\r\nthe  whole  Council of Ministers will consider  the\r\n\r\nreports before an order of detention is issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another criticism is that this power of detention\r\n\r\nis  extended from that against persons  who  are  a\r\n\r\nthreat  to  public security, to persons who  are  a\r\n\r\nthreat  to  the maintenance of essential  services.\r\n\r\nThis   extension  which  follows  our   neighbours'\r\n\r\nprovisions  was introduced in order to protect  the\r\n\r\ncountry  against possible acts of sabotage  and  in\r\n\r\norder  to  protect the worker against the  type  of\r\n\r\nillegal  general strike with which he  was  saddled\r\n\r\nand  under which he suffered last June. We consider\r\n\r\nthat  the  worker  should  be  protected  from  the\r\n\r\n\"topengs\",  the pseudo-trade unionists,  when  they\r\n\r\nseek  to  sacrifice  him  and  the  community.   We\r\n\r\nconsider  that  the community should  be  protected\r\n\r\nagainst illegal strikes in essential services,  and\r\n\r\nthe  operative word is \"illegal\". There  cannot  be\r\n\r\nand  there  never  will  be  any  question  of  the\r\n\r\nutilisation of these powers against persons who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare lawfully pursuing their constitutional right to\r\n\r\nstrike after proper notice has been given, even  in\r\n\r\nessential services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was an eye-opener to us - the general\r\n\r\nstrike  of last June. We all knew, the whole public\r\n\r\nknew,   who   were  the  principal  and  ostensible\r\n\r\norganisers of that illegal strike, and yet when  we\r\n\r\nsought to obtain evidence in order to bring them to\r\n\r\ncourt;   when  we  examined  more  than  70   trade\r\n\r\nunionists for statements - though many of them freely\r\n\r\nand frankly gave names and indicated in what manner\r\n\r\nthere  was intimidation and a threat to bring about\r\n\r\nthis   general  strike - not  one,  Sir,  would  give\r\n\r\nevidence   in  public.  When  it  came  to   formal\r\n\r\nstatements for the Police records, they  said,  \"We\r\n\r\nwent on strike because we felt like going on strike\r\n\r\nthat day! Nobody told us! We each individually just\r\n\r\ndecided that we wanted to take a holiday that  day,\r\n\r\nso  we went on strike! That is all there was to it!\r\n\r\nWe just decided to go on strike!\" Very clever. Very\r\n\r\nclever.  And  we are being blamed today,  Sir,  for\r\n\r\nseeking to protect the people from these who made a\r\n\r\nlaughingstock of the law, of the security  and  the\r\n\r\ncomfort of decent citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in answer to the fears of\r\n\r\nresponsible  trade unionists, I have already  given\r\n\r\nnotice  that I will introduce amendments to  clause\r\n\r\n3, that I will delete the word \"supplies\", and that\r\n\r\nI  will  define with precision the words \"essential\r\n\r\nservices\",  so that there need be no  fear  of  any\r\n\r\nambiguity.  The new clause, as it will be  amended,\r\n\r\nis before hon. Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should like to say a few words about the\r\n\r\nprotection  which this Bill gives to  the  ordinary\r\n\r\ncitizen.  Neither  my friends of  the  P.A.P.,  nor\r\n\r\nthose who are not my friends of the P.A.P.; nor the\r\n\r\nunions  which called that absurd meeting on  Sunday\r\n\r\nand  issued  its abusive memorandum, illogical  and\r\n\r\nlying, which some have received today: nor even the\r\n\r\nProgressive Party which in the past used  to  stand\r\n\r\nfor  the  progress of vested interests,  have  seen\r\n\r\nfit,  Sir,  to  draw attention to the  immeasurable\r\n\r\nimprovements  we  have  brought  to  the   original\r\n\r\nEmergency Regulations for the detention of persons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuspected  of conduct prejudicial to the safety  of\r\n\r\nthis territory. It seems, Sir, that at least in this\r\n\r\ncity  and in this territory there is no such  thing\r\n\r\nas  fair play in politics. We have been abused  and\r\n\r\nmaligned, but not one word was said, Sir, about the\r\n\r\nsuccessful   efforts   for   improvement   and   to\r\n\r\nliberalise the law that now stands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should in this House like to take the\r\n\r\nopportunity,  which is mine, to draw  attention  to\r\n\r\nthese  improvements because it seems  to  me  that,\r\n\r\nlike   this  so-called  nine-man  committee   which\r\n\r\nrepresents 80,000 people, it is just possible  that\r\n\r\nhon.  Members themselves have not read the Bill.  I\r\n\r\nhave  already  drawn  attention  to  the  amendment\r\n\r\nmaking  it  necessary  for  the  whole  Council  of\r\n\r\nMinisters  to  decide  on  the  original  order  of\r\n\r\ndetention. There is no such safeguard in any  other\r\n\r\nlaw of preventive detention, past or present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to give the citizen the greatest sense\r\n\r\nof  security possible, Sir, this law requires  that\r\n\r\nthe Appeal Tribunal should consist of three Judges,\r\n\r\nmen whose traditions of impartiality, integrity and\r\n\r\nresponsibility   through  the   decades   in   this\r\n\r\nterritory  have earned the respect of every  single\r\n\r\nmember of every community. It is three Judges, Sir,\r\n\r\nwho will form the Appeal Tribunal. There is no such\r\n\r\nprotection in any other law in any other  territory\r\n\r\nwhich provides for preventive detention and arrest.\r\n\r\nThe  Appeal  Tribunal, Sir, if  it  considers  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  not  enough  evidence  to  justify   the\r\n\r\ndetention,  can order the release of the  detainee.\r\n\r\nThat  order  is  final.  It  does  not  matter  how\r\n\r\ndangerous the Government or the Special Branch  may\r\n\r\nthink  a  man  is. If the Tribunal of three  Judges\r\n\r\norders his release, Government must obey. Under the\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations and under the  laws  of  our\r\n\r\nneighbours, the Appeal Tribunal can only advise the\r\n\r\nGovernment. The Government retains the final say as\r\n\r\nto whether it is to release the man or not. But we,\r\n\r\nand I who have worked in our Courts, have so strong\r\n\r\na  sense of respect for the responsibility  of  our\r\n\r\nJudges  that we are content and happy to leave  the\r\n\r\nmatter in their hands: and if the three Judges,  or\r\n\r\nthe majority of them, decide that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nman  must  be released, Government has  no  further\r\n\r\nsay.  This,  Sir,  is  a  radical  change  in   the\r\n\r\nprinciple   of  laws  of  preventive   arrest   and\r\n\r\ndetention.  No other country in the  world,  not  a\r\n\r\nsingle   one   of  our  neighbours,  provides   the\r\n\r\nprotection to the detainee which this law does.  It\r\n\r\nis  a malicious falsehood to suggest that this  law\r\n\r\ngives  the Government power to arrest anybody  whom\r\n\r\nit  dislikes - the  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar,  for\r\n\r\nexample - and keep him in prison on a free holiday at\r\n\r\nthe expense of the Government -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> With \"Class A\" rations!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Consequently  any  legislation   under\r\n\r\nwhatever  title - whether  Emergency  Regulations  or\r\n\r\nPreservation  of  Public  Security  Ordinance - which\r\n\r\ncontains provisions interfering with or restricting\r\n\r\nsuch  rights  is undesirable. We intensely  dislike\r\n\r\nsuch interference or restriction. At the same time,\r\n\r\nwe  also  intensely abhor the causes which make  it\r\n\r\nnecessary    to    introduce    such    restrictive\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know why the Emergency Regulations were\r\n\r\nintroduced  and  how  they  were  operated  to  the\r\n\r\ndislike  of the people. How certain parts of  these\r\n\r\nrestrictive  Regulations were removed not  so  very\r\n\r\nlong  ago,  and  how quickly the same objectionable\r\n\r\nparts   had  to  be  re-introduced  by  this   same\r\n\r\nAssembly!  In giving an account of these events,  I\r\n\r\nam not saying that the reasons for the introduction\r\n\r\nof the Emergency Regulations and those which led to\r\n\r\ntheir  re-introduction not very long  ago  are  the\r\n\r\nsame, but they both result in the loss of life  and\r\n\r\nproperty and are detrimental to the peace and order\r\n\r\nof this Colony.

Sir, as a trade unionist,  I\r\n\r\ncannot but express the alarm of the trade unionists\r\n\r\nin   this   Colony.  The  Labour  Front   Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment  has come into power because the  people\r\n\r\nhad  placed  their  faith  on  the  programme  they\r\n\r\npromised  to carry out. One of the central features\r\n\r\nof  their  programme was the Emergency Regulations.\r\n\r\nThese   Regulations  were  imposed  to   meet   the\r\n\r\npolitical conditions that arose at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this year, Sir, most of us in this\r\n\r\nHouse - I  am  afraid  I have got  to  say  with  the\r\n\r\nexception  of  the  Progressive Party - realised  the\r\n\r\nfeeling of the people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin this country on the Emergency Regulations. These\r\n\r\nRegulations were no longer serving the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nsaving  the country from a grave political  crisis,\r\n\r\nbut  were,  in  fact,  a fetter  on  the  political\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the people in this country.  Trade\r\n\r\nunionists and freedom fighters were fully alive  to\r\n\r\nthis threat of the Malayan freedom movement and  to\r\n\r\nordinary   trade  union  activity.   The   colonial\r\n\r\nGovernment  was struggling to convey the impression\r\n\r\nthat  they were helping the people of this  country\r\n\r\ntowards  self-government, and were encouraging  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of trade unions. I say \"struggling  to\r\n\r\nconvey  the  impression\" because  they  desired  to\r\n\r\nmaintain themselves in this country by the  use  of\r\n\r\nthe power of the Emergency Regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Labour Front Coalition Government is in\r\n\r\npower,   but  under  a  very  different   political\r\n\r\nsituation. We have today people who are  no  longer\r\n\r\nafraid  of  fighting  for their democratic  rights,\r\n\r\npeople  who  no longer intend to live in servility,\r\n\r\npeople who will no longer submit in silence to  the\r\n\r\nthreat and coercion brought upon them by this piece\r\n\r\nof legislation. What is most important, Sir, is that\r\n\r\nour   people,  who  stood  together  against  these\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations, have sent to this  Assembly\r\n\r\nHouse  today  their representatives  to  carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir election pledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Labour Front came into power, it was\r\n\r\nfaced  with  difficulty - problems of the  riots  and\r\n\r\ngeneral industrial unrest. In fact, as an aftermath\r\n\r\nof the elections and the release of energy, and the\r\n\r\nfeeling of greater hopes after the years under  the\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations, the riots in May this  year\r\n\r\nseemed  almost  inevitable. Industrial  unrest,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  has not ceased and is not likely to  cease\r\n\r\nas   long   as   conditions   of   employment   are\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory.  With  a greater  volume  of  trade\r\n\r\nunion  activity  and the determined  stand  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers   to  improve  the  conditions  of  living,\r\n\r\nindustrial unrest will continue to exist unless, of\r\n\r\ncourse, the Government is able to carry out  social\r\n\r\nand  economic  reforms  in  the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these Bills before us today are a great\r\n\r\nthreat to trade unionists who are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndetermined to fight and to secure better  terms  of\r\n\r\nemployment for the workers. Trade unionists are  no\r\n\r\nlonger  silent and submissive, and to add to  this,\r\n\r\nwe  have the threat of new legislation which is, in\r\n\r\nfact,  no different from the Emergency Regulations.\r\n\r\nSuch legislation can easily be interpreted by trade\r\n\r\nunionists  as  being  in  the  interests   of   the\r\n\r\nemployers.  The  views of genuine trade  unionists,\r\n\r\nwho  are truly representative of the workers,  have\r\n\r\nbeen frequently expressed during the past few days,\r\n\r\nand I am sure that the Government is aware of these\r\n\r\nviews. As a method of expressing their views,  they\r\n\r\nhave sought to raise a hue and cry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am against the imposition of new legislation.\r\n\r\nIf  our cries should pass unheeded, I would like to\r\n\r\nremind Members of the Government that they will  be\r\n\r\ntaken  to task in the future on the election pledge\r\n\r\nthey made to the public early this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, only last night the Naval Base Labour Union\r\n\r\ndeplored  this Security Bill. Outside this Assembly\r\n\r\nHouse now, officials and members of the Naval  Base\r\n\r\nLabour Union are demonstrating against this Bill by\r\n\r\npeaceful  picketing. At this stage, the workers  of\r\n\r\nthe  armed Services are presenting their grievances\r\n\r\nto  the management. They cannot but feel unhappy at\r\n\r\nthe  legislation  which may be used  against  them.\r\n\r\nSir,  I have been directed by the Naval Base Labour\r\n\r\nUnion  to  state that the members of the Union  are\r\n\r\npledged to oppose this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, the Chief Minister, during his now very famous\r\n\r\nelection  campaign under the old  apple  tree,  had\r\n\r\nsaid  many uncomplimentary things about the present\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations.

The\r\n\r\nrestrictions  on  democratic  liberties  under  the\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations are just as repugnant  under\r\n\r\nany  other name.

For seven years now  the\r\n\r\nforces  of colonialism in this country have sought\r\n\r\nto  frustrate  the aspirations of the  people  for\r\n\r\ndemocracy and political freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emergency Regulations were enforced by the\r\n\r\ncolonial  power  on  the  excuse  that  they  were\r\n\r\nnecessary for the suppression of Communism in this\r\n\r\ncountry.  We  were  told  that  once  the   wicked\r\n\r\nCommunists   were  destroyed, good,   god-fearing,\r\n\r\ndemocratic-minded and freedom-loving  people  like\r\n\r\nour  Hon. the Chief Secretary and other executives\r\n\r\nof  colonialism in this country would be  able  to\r\n\r\nsolve  all  our  political,  social  and  economic\r\n\r\nproblems   for  us.  But  after  seven  years   of\r\n\r\nEmergency   Regulations;  years  of  arrests   and\r\n\r\ndetentions without trial; or banishment orders and\r\n\r\nbroken  families  and homes;  of  untold  miseries\r\n\r\nsuffered  by thousands of men and women; years  of\r\n\r\nsuppression  of the basic democratic  freedoms  of\r\n\r\nspeech, assembly, association and publication;  of\r\n\r\nthe  suppression of the intellectual liberties  of\r\n\r\nthe   people, - the  general  social  and  political\r\n\r\nunrest  in  this country continues.  This  general\r\n\r\nunrest  will  continue and even  grow,  until  its\r\n\r\nbasic cause has been removed. This basic cause  is\r\n\r\ncolonialism. If the general unrest, the political,\r\n\r\nsocial and economic dissatisfactions are to cease,\r\n\r\ncolonialism must cease first. That is an essential\r\n\r\npre-condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why have the Emergency Regulations failed in\r\n\r\nachieving anything at all, besides increased human\r\n\r\nmisery  and  suffering? They have  failed  because\r\n\r\nthey   do   not  provide  any  solution  for   the\r\n\r\npolitical,  social and economic problems  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry. These problems require political,  social\r\n\r\nand  economic solutions - not punitive  or  military\r\n\r\nsolutions. The anti-democratic provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations and now of the  new  Public\r\n\r\nSecurity   Bill  are  essentially   punitive   and\r\n\r\ncompletely ineffective colonial remedies  for  the\r\n\r\ndeep-rooted   political,   social   and   economic\r\n\r\ndiseases  of colonialism. Colonialism and colonial\r\n\r\nofficials  cannot cure this disease, because  they\r\n\r\nare  part  of  the  disease themselves.  The  only\r\n\r\nsolution for the disease of colonialism is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nending  of  colonialism  and  its  replacement  by\r\n\r\ncomplete political independence and full democracy\r\n\r\nfor the peoples of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colonial officials will, of course, claim that\r\n\r\nthey  are busy getting the people of this  country\r\n\r\nready  for freedom and democracy. I am not a  very\r\n\r\nclever  person,  Sir,  like  the  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary, who can prove that black is white,  and\r\n\r\nthat Fascist laws and democratic laws are one  and\r\n\r\nthe same thing. I must confess that my Party and I\r\n\r\ncannot  understand how the people of this  country\r\n\r\ncan  progress  towards  democracy  when  they  are\r\n\r\ndenied the most basic democratic rights. Only  the\r\n\r\nwilfully  blind and the politically ignorant  will\r\n\r\nclaim  that the powers of detention without trial,\r\n\r\nand   the   restriction  on  freedom  of   speech,\r\n\r\nexpression and assembly, have not had a repressive\r\n\r\neffect   on   genuine  political  expression   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restrictions on democratic liberties have always\r\n\r\ngot  a  political purpose behind them. Laws  which\r\n\r\ndeny democratic rights are valuable, for instance,\r\n\r\nto   colonial   officials  for  the   purpose   of\r\n\r\nintimidating  the  free  expression  of  political\r\n\r\nviews   which   are  contrary  to  the   aims   of\r\n\r\ncolonialism.   Such  laws  are  useful   for   the\r\n\r\nsuppression of political and social expressions of\r\n\r\npopular  discontent  which are  dangerous  to  the\r\n\r\ncolonial system. They are also extremely useful to\r\n\r\nthose  who hate to see the emergence of  a  strong\r\n\r\nand  genuine trade unionism in this country. There\r\n\r\nis  nothing surprising or shocking about  colonial\r\n\r\nofficials who support these laws. Repressive  laws\r\n\r\nare necessary for the preservation of colonialism,\r\n\r\nand it is part of the duties of colonial officials\r\n\r\nto pass such laws. But it is an entirely different\r\n\r\nmatter  for elected representatives of the  people\r\n\r\nto  support  such  laws. Not only  must  they  not\r\n\r\nsupport  such laws, but they must actively  oppose\r\n\r\nBills like the Public Security Bill. Failure to do\r\n\r\nthis will be a great betrayal of the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe people to the interests of colonialism. It  is\r\n\r\nespecially  true for hon. Members  of  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront.  The  Labour  Front  fought  and  won   the\r\n\r\nelections on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na   platform   which   condemned   the   Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations  and asked for their repeal.  Everyone\r\n\r\nknows  that  the  Preservation of Public  Security\r\n\r\nBill is the same old enemy of democratic liberties\r\n\r\nin  a  new and more permanent disguise. The Labour\r\n\r\nFront now preserves the restrictions on democratic\r\n\r\nrights which they promised to repeal. It looks  as\r\n\r\nif  the  Labour  Front  has changed  its  backseat\r\n\r\ndrivers! During the elections they behaved  as  if\r\n\r\nthe people were the backseat drivers of the Labour\r\n\r\nFront.  It is right and honourable for the elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the people to  recognise  only\r\n\r\nthe  people  who  elected them as their  back-seat\r\n\r\ndrivers,  but the people appear now  to  have  met\r\n\r\nwith  a tragic rebuff. The Labour Front has chosen\r\n\r\nthe   forces  of  colonialism  as  their  backseat\r\n\r\ndrivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ridiculous to talk of public security under\r\n\r\ncolonialism.  What public security is  there  when\r\n\r\nmembers of the public can be arrested and detained\r\n\r\nwithout trial? What public security is there  when\r\n\r\nmembers of the public are denied their basic human\r\n\r\nrights?  Let  us not be hypocrites!  Let  us  call\r\n\r\nthings  by  their correct names.

I have always been an admirer of\r\n\r\nhis  tactics  in  Court, for  he  is  the  supreme\r\n\r\nadvocate of the strategy of attack when you are on\r\n\r\nthe  defensive.

Let him ask for a mandate  for  this\r\n\r\nmost  important of all the Labour Front's election\r\n\r\nplatforms - a  mandate for the Emergency Regulations\r\n\r\nto  be attired, not in a policeman's uniform,  but\r\n\r\nin the Chief Minister's bush jacket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that the Public Security Bill is\r\n\r\nbut  an alias for the Emergency Regulations.

That is  the  most\r\n\r\nserious political mistake that any political Party\r\n\r\ncan  make in this part of the world.

They  wrote  in   their\r\n\r\nplatform that they would repeal the whole  of  the\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations when  the  People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty, with care, circumspection and deliberation,\r\n\r\nsaid  they  would repeal the Emergency Regulations\r\n\r\nwhich  provide  for  arrest and detention  without\r\n\r\ntrial, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly  and\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  publication.\" If the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\ntoday  accurately  represents  the  feelings,  the\r\n\r\ntemper  and  the  views of the  people,  then,  no\r\n\r\ndoubt, he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  his colleagues would be returned with greater\r\n\r\nstrength and greater confidence. They would have a\r\n\r\nmandate to go through with this legislation; and I\r\n\r\nand  my  Party,  if we were also returned  by  our\r\n\r\nconstituents, would have less reason to doubt  the\r\n\r\npolitical integrity, if not the sagacity,  of  the\r\n\r\nhon. Members on the other side of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, the Chief Minister himself let one\r\n\r\nof the biggest cats out of the political bag when,\r\n\r\nin  a moment of anger and bitterness, he recounted\r\n\r\nhow a colonial Governor tried to inveigle him into\r\n\r\na  conspiracy  to cheat the people.  The  colonial\r\n\r\nGovernor  invited  him  to  repeal  the  Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations.  Then they, the colonial  government,\r\n\r\nwould re-impose them under the Governor's reserved\r\n\r\npowers.  The Chief Minister, his sense of  decency\r\n\r\nrebelling  at  this indecent suggestion,  said  he\r\n\r\nwould not cheat the world in such a way as to make\r\n\r\nit believe that he was an honest democrat, and the\r\n\r\nGovernor  was - if I may quote the words of  another\r\n\r\npublication  which  we  have  all  received   this\r\n\r\nmorning, a memorandum which the Chief Minister has\r\n\r\nreferred  to  in slighting terms - \"the vicious  and\r\n\r\nrepugnant\" instrument of oppression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are now being asked to elevate rules and\r\n\r\norders  under the Emergency Regulations, from  the\r\n\r\nlowly  status  of  Emergency  Regulations  to  the\r\n\r\nresplendent status of being part of the normal law\r\n\r\nof  the land. The reason advanced is that this  is\r\n\r\nnecessary   to  combat  Communist  terrorism   and\r\n\r\nsubversion.  Sir,  no  one denies  that  there  is\r\n\r\nCommunist terrorism or subversion. When any \"ism\",\r\n\r\nbe it Communism or Fascism, resorts to violence or\r\n\r\nterror, it must be resisted. But we are at the same\r\n\r\ntime  being asked to believe in democracy. We  say\r\n\r\nwe  believe  in democracy because  it  is  a  more\r\n\r\nliberal and a more civilised way of life.  We  say\r\n\r\nwe  dislike Communism because, under that form  of\r\n\r\ngovernment, they have arbitrary powers  of  arrest\r\n\r\nand  detention without trial. They  have,  what  we\r\n\r\nfortunately  so  far have not got here,  arbitrary\r\n\r\npowers  of physical liquidation without trial.  So\r\n\r\nwe are told that the democratic way of life is far\r\n\r\nsuperior. Yet, for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover eight years now the British and their friends\r\n\r\nhave  gradually worked themselves into a frame  of\r\n\r\nmind  when,  in  the name of democracy,  they  can\r\n\r\nintroduce  every rule and every order which  is  a\r\n\r\ncomplete denial of the basic tenets and beliefs of\r\n\r\ndemocracy.   That   I  think   is   the   greatest\r\n\r\npsychological  defeat suffered by the  British  in\r\n\r\nthis battle between the two fanaticisms\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Communism and anti-Communism.

In fact, the Chief Minister would\r\n\r\nhave  the support of the People's Action Party  if\r\n\r\nhe decided to bring further penalties against rape\r\n\r\nand  murder, if it were found to be too  prevalent\r\n\r\nin this part of the world.

What he is seeking to do in the  name\r\n\r\nof  democracy is to curtail a fundamental  liberty\r\n\r\nand  the most fundamental of them all - freedom from\r\n\r\narrest  and  punishment without having violated  a\r\n\r\nspecific  provision of the law and being convicted\r\n\r\nfor  it.  Of  course,  the  Chief  Minister  could\r\n\r\nquibble and say, \"After all, it is not punishment;\r\n\r\nit  is not imprisonment; it is detention under the\r\n\r\nmost  benign  and  kind conditions.\"  But  no  man\r\n\r\nshould be deprived of his liberty. It may be  that\r\n\r\nsuch  a  liberal way of life does not  and  cannot\r\n\r\nexist  in  conditions in South-East Asia.  But  if\r\n\r\nthat  is so, then let the Chief Minister at  least\r\n\r\nhave the courage to go back to the people and tell\r\n\r\nthem so, and seek a mandate to do what he wants to\r\n\r\ndo. I am sure he will understand that it is better\r\n\r\ndone that way now than deferred for three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important observation which the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  has  allowed to drop from  his  lips  is\r\n\r\nthat,  after eight years of the Emergency, we  are\r\n\r\nfaced with a problem as grave and as acute as when\r\n\r\nit began. It is the most conclusive proof that the\r\n\r\nEmergency Regulations are not the answer either to\r\n\r\nCommunist  terrorism or Communist subversion.  The\r\n\r\nEmergency    Regulations   have   not    destroyed\r\n\r\nCommunism,  but it may well destroy democracy.  It\r\n\r\nhas  not completely frightened the Communists, but\r\n\r\nit  may  act  as  a  dampening  restraint  on  the\r\n\r\nnationalists. Of course the Chief Minister has not\r\n\r\ngiven  his assurance to me personally that I would\r\n\r\nnot  suffer  under  these Regulations - but  we  all\r\n\r\nbelieve, at least we all should believe,  that  as\r\n\r\nlong as his Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  in control, conscientiously, scrupulously, and\r\n\r\nhonestly  working these rules and regulations,  no\r\n\r\none  will be penalised or made to suffer who  does\r\n\r\nnot deserve to be penalised or made to suffer.

I  am not  saying  that  India,\r\n\r\nBurma,  Pakistan and Indonesia have not got  their\r\n\r\nown Communist problems. Communism, as I understand\r\n\r\nit, and not only from textbooks, is a product  of\r\n\r\nsocial  and  economic frustration and  discontent.\r\n\r\nWhen  you have this social and economic discontent\r\n\r\nand it is exacerbated by the irritants of colonial\r\n\r\ncontrol,  then you have a situation  growing  into\r\n\r\ncancerous proportions. I am not suggesting that if\r\n\r\nwe are free tomorrow of the eminent members of the\r\n\r\ncivil  and legal services who sit with us here  as\r\n\r\nof right under the constitution, we should be free\r\n\r\nfrom all our troubles. But I do say that we have a\r\n\r\nmuch  better  chance  of  resolving  the  internal\r\n\r\nsocial  and economic discontent than we  ever  can\r\n\r\nhave now. To me, Sir, it is an act of faith.

But Asia in revolt, Asia on\r\n\r\nthe march, is a very different proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister, with his flair for colourful\r\n\r\nmetaphor, will appreciate this when I say that the\r\n\r\nproblem of Communist subversion and terrorism  has\r\n\r\nbecome  a  cancer  in  our  body  politic.   These\r\n\r\nEmergency   Regulations  at  best  can   only   be\r\n\r\nbarbiturates.  They numb the pain. They  lull  one\r\n\r\ninto  a  sense of security, into an illusion  that\r\n\r\nperhaps, after all, the thing that causes the pain\r\n\r\nis  not  there. But I myself would prefer  a  bold\r\n\r\ncure. I would take one bold step to freedom.  Then\r\n\r\nI say we have a fighting chance to resolve our own\r\n\r\nsocial and economic problems when they are reduced\r\n\r\nto  the proportions which they naturally assume in\r\n\r\nany  part  of the world, for anywhere  social  and\r\n\r\neconomic discontent inevitably leads to industrial\r\n\r\nand social unrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that such a free government, speaking\r\n\r\nfor  the  people, deciding its destiny  absolutely\r\n\r\nand  unreservedly, could drastically repeal  those\r\n\r\nparts  of the Emergency Regulations which militate\r\n\r\nagainst  the  fundamental rights of  human  beings\r\n\r\nanywhere  in  the world. This would  not  lead  to\r\n\r\nCommunism  if such a step were accompanied  by  an\r\n\r\nequally  bold  and  drastic  economic  and  social\r\n\r\nreform. To shrug and doubt is to admit defeat. You\r\n\r\nmay  stifle political discontent, but it will come\r\n\r\nout  at  some  subsequent  date  in  a  much  more\r\n\r\nvirulent  form. If we take our chance now,  I  say\r\n\r\nMalaya  can  succeed  as an independent  and  free\r\n\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emergency as a violent struggle is very\r\n\r\nprobably going through a decline, and a new  phase\r\n\r\nof  bitter political struggle is opening up.

I am sure the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications will be the first to say that  that\r\n\r\nis  what is wrong with Communist States. Then what\r\n\r\nis done in the name of democracy is right. When it\r\n\r\nis done in some other name, it is wrong. But these\r\n\r\nare  fundamental beliefs. They may or may not work\r\n\r\nin  Asia,  that  no one can say. But  one  can  say\r\n\r\nthis:one must have the courage to make it work, to\r\n\r\ntry   it;   for  if  it  cannot  work,  then   the\r\n\r\nalternative is one of constant suppression the end\r\n\r\nof which no one knows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that for seven years now we have\r\n\r\ndeveloped  an  Emergency  mentality.  Many  people\r\n\r\nbelieve that the only way to keep down any form of\r\n\r\nagitation,  which anybody may have  exploited  for\r\n\r\ntheir  own personal or political ends, is  by  the\r\n\r\nuse  of repressive laws, more policemen, and  more\r\n\r\narrests.  But  this  has been proved  false  after\r\n\r\nseven  years.  I hate to think that after  another\r\n\r\nthree  or four years, or whenever it may  be  when\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister decides to  go  back  to  the\r\n\r\npeople, that it is again to be proved false. It  is\r\n\r\nsuch  a  futile answer to the Communist challenge.\r\n\r\nIf  we are to survive as a free democracy, then we\r\n\r\nmust be prepared, in principle, to concede to  our\r\n\r\nenemies - even  those who do not  subscribe  to  our\r\n\r\nviews - as much constitutional right as you  concede\r\n\r\nyourself.  My  plea - to  quote  from  sonic-one  in\r\n\r\nanother  context - is  that the  time  has  come  in\r\n\r\nMalaya  for  an agonising reappraisal of  strategy\r\n\r\nand  strength. To go on blindly in the  hope  that\r\n\r\nsomehow  or  the  other  suppression  can  prevent\r\n\r\nlatent  social, economic and political discontents\r\n\r\nfrom  manifesting  themselves and  disrupting  the\r\n\r\nstructure of society is a piece of folly to  which\r\n\r\nmy Party does not subscribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Chief Minister, before he launches into\r\n\r\nanother furious tirade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagainst me and my Party, to think of the political\r\n\r\nimplications  it  has, first, on himself  and  his\r\n\r\nParty,  and, second, on Singapore and  Malaya.

The Member for Bukit Timah  has  his\r\n\r\nmind  so  firmly  fixed  on  the  evil  doings  of\r\n\r\ncolonial officials - of those few of us who  survive\r\n\r\nin this exalted Chamber -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Very comfortably survive!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> - that he seems to be quite unable to\r\n\r\nput  his mind at all on to the problems which face\r\n\r\nthe  Government of Singapore today and which  face\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  today.  He, apparently,  is  quite\r\n\r\nhappy  to  face a situation in which, as he  says,\r\n\r\nthere will be continued general unrest because  of\r\n\r\nthe    basic   cause   of   colonialism.   Because\r\n\r\ncolonialism,  in his view, denies  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  today their basic human rights,  he  is\r\n\r\nprepared,  apparently, to continue,  from  day  to\r\n\r\nday, allowing Singapore to continue in a state  of\r\n\r\nunrest - a state of unrest which, if I know anything\r\n\r\nabout  it, so far from his trying to stop  it,  he\r\n\r\nwill  try  to inflame. So much for the Member  for\r\n\r\nBukit Timah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now how terribly similar is the attitude of the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar! He treated us to a  long\r\n\r\ndissertation on what he thought the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nought  to  do.  Fortunately, he is not  yet  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, and I, for one, and I am sure all  on  my\r\n\r\nside  of  the House are quite confident  that  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  will  judge  what  he  should  do\r\n\r\nwithout receiving free advice from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Tanjong Pagar, who enjoys, of course,\r\n\r\nall the delights of play-acting in this House,  of\r\n\r\nappealing  to  the  Gallery and  never  having  to\r\n\r\nhonour a cheque.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to revert, if I may, to the point that I was\r\n\r\ngoing  to make which I feel is distressing and  is\r\n\r\ndangerous. It is that while the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  understands  and sees  the  danger  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunist ideology, and is fully conscious of  it,\r\n\r\nhe  is,  in fact, I think, half fascinated by  its\r\n\r\ndynamism and by its selflessness. But what does he\r\n\r\ndo?  All  he does is to tell us that the Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations and colonial methods will not stop the\r\n\r\nMalayan  Communist Party in Singapore. Of  course,\r\n\r\nthey  will not. No one ever suggested they  would,\r\n\r\nand  I  certainly  do  not suggest  that,  through\r\n\r\nmeasures  such  as the Emergency  Regulations  and\r\n\r\nthese  new  Bills, we can root out Communism  from\r\n\r\nthe  body  politic  in Singapore.  Of  course,  we\r\n\r\ncannot.  All we can do with these measures  is  to\r\n\r\ntry and stop it getting out of hand and to try and\r\n\r\ntake  away  its  most dangerous leaders.  But  the\r\n\r\nbasic  issue is the issue which must be fought  by\r\n\r\nthe   citizens  of  Singapore -  not  by   colonial\r\n\r\nofficials - but by the citizens of Singapore and  by\r\n\r\ntheir  leaders, and by such people as  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong Pagar sets himself out to be.  It  is\r\n\r\nfor  you  to fight this battle. It is for  you  to\r\n\r\ncapture  the minds and the hearts of the  citizens\r\n\r\nof Singapore and to stop them being led away along\r\n\r\nthat  false  and  sterile  trail  which  leads  to\r\n\r\nCommunist  dictatorship which I know  you  do  not\r\n\r\nwant to see in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do warn you and all Members of this House, with\r\n\r\nthe  utmost sincerity, against being deluded  into\r\n\r\nthis idea that you can avoid being involved in the\r\n\r\nstruggle  between  Communism and  democracy.   You\r\n\r\ncannot avoid it. It is here today. It is with  you\r\n\r\nnight   and  day.  Do  not,  I  beg  you,   delude\r\n\r\nyourselves with some such extraordinary phrase  as\r\n\r\n\"dynamic neutralism\".  There is not such thing  as\r\n\r\n\"dynamic  neutralism\" in the Communist  philosophy\r\n\r\nof  life which is challenging you today, here  and\r\n\r\nnow.  I say to you that if you wait,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich is what the Member for Tanjong Pagar wants  to\r\n\r\ndo - he  says he cannot fight Communism until  he  has\r\n\r\ngot  rid  of colonialism; he cannot fight  Communism\r\n\r\nuntil  Singapore has got independence - I say to  you,\r\n\r\nyou  cannot afford to wait. The struggle is here for\r\n\r\nyou  to  fight  it now, and the more vigorously  you\r\n\r\nfight  it,  the quicker you will get independence - an\r\n\r\nindependence  which  is worth  while.  Do  not  give\r\n\r\nyourself  the excuse of not being independent  today\r\n\r\nto  refuse to do what is now your duty and what,  if\r\n\r\nyou  do not do it now, it may be too late to  do  in\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Suspension of sitting</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

We have today, of course,  the  Public\r\n\r\nSecurity  Bill  which, if we boil  it  down  to  its\r\n\r\nessence,  would  be  just  about  the  same  as  the\r\n\r\nEmergency Regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it has always been our view that\r\n\r\nextraordinary  times need extraordinary  Bills,  and\r\n\r\nextraordinary measures must be used to keep law  and\r\n\r\norder.  Our  view,  however, is that  the  Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations,  or  the  present  security   measures,\r\n\r\nshould not be kept one day longer if necessary.  The\r\n\r\nEmergency\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulations  were  a temporary  measure  renewable\r\n\r\nevery  three  months.  This,  of  course,  has   its\r\n\r\nadvantage.  Any  cases  in  which  Government  might\r\n\r\ndetain people might be brought up and aired, and any\r\n\r\ngrievances  that people genuinely  have  may  get  a\r\n\r\nhearing.  The  Government also have to  make  out  a\r\n\r\ncase, when the life of the Emergency Regulations  is\r\n\r\nending  and it is time to have it renewed,  to  show\r\n\r\nthat the Emergency Regulations are still necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Public Security Bill is to be put on the\r\n\r\nStatute  book  for a period of three  years.  I  say\r\n\r\nagain   that   measures  such   as   the   Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations   or  the  Public  Security   Bill   are\r\n\r\ndistasteful to the people. They are distasteful  for\r\n\r\nvarious  reasons which I will try to explain  later,\r\n\r\nbut all are agreed that they are not a very pleasant\r\n\r\nthing  to  keep. We governed Singapore  before  1948\r\n\r\nwith  no such rules, and I hope that there will come\r\n\r\nthe  day when we can remove all such Regulations and\r\n\r\nreturn  to a normal life. To keep security  measures\r\n\r\non  the Statute book is something that nobody likes.\r\n\r\nIt  is  something that we would like to put  in  the\r\n\r\nbackyard, but putting it on the Statute book, making\r\n\r\nit  law,  it  is  just like moving that  distasteful\r\n\r\nsubstance into the house itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people in Singapore and anywhere else value\r\n\r\nfreedom,  and  anything that is going to  take  away\r\n\r\npersonal  freedom from them will be distasteful  and\r\n\r\nundemocratic. But I say, for a large majority of the\r\n\r\npeople,  we  need to have such measures  to  protect\r\n\r\nthem,  but people do not like it. I would  say  that\r\n\r\nthe people who say they are for it just tolerate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who dislike such measures, I think, can\r\n\r\nbe classified under three categories. Obviously, the\r\n\r\nfirst   category   of  people  are  the   subversive\r\n\r\nelements.  They hate it, and they hate it  with  all\r\n\r\ntheir might, and you know why they hate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category of people would be, I should\r\n\r\nsay,  the ordinary citizens, probably connected with\r\n\r\ntrade  unions and respectable people. Some of  these\r\n\r\npeople, I should say, may have been called in by the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch for interrogation. There  may  be  a\r\n\r\ncase  against them, but more often, as  I  know  it,\r\n\r\nthey are usually let off and, of course,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis Bill has given them the jitters that probably\r\n\r\nthey  will be the victims of interrogation by  the\r\n\r\npolice. There are grounds for their fears,  and  I\r\n\r\nthink  that the power that such measures as  these\r\n\r\nRegulations give to the Government should be  used\r\n\r\nmost  sparingly,  especially with trade  unionists\r\n\r\nwho are trying to better the standard of living of\r\n\r\nthe  workers. They have legitimate reasons. If  we\r\n\r\ncan  prove to trade unionists that these  measures\r\n\r\nare not against people doing the right things,  we\r\n\r\nwill  probably  win over a very large  section  of\r\n\r\nmoderately-minded persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the last category of people who dislike\r\n\r\nthese  measures would be the ordinary  men-in-the-street. They dislike them for this reason. We know\r\n\r\nthat  if  a  member of the subversive elements  is\r\n\r\nhauled  in  and interrogated, and later  on  other\r\n\r\npeople  are called in to give evidence, they  will\r\n\r\ndo  so  on the quiet; but if you ask them to  come\r\n\r\nforward to give their evidence on oath, they  will\r\n\r\ncringe and they will suppress any information that\r\n\r\nthey  have.  The reason obviously is fear - fear  of\r\n\r\nreprisal.   In  the  same  way,  the  peace-loving\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore are afraid of this, not from\r\n\r\nthe  subversive elements, but from the police.  We\r\n\r\nknow that the power might be given to the Governor\r\n\r\nin  Council that the case might be handled by  the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent  or  Assistant  Superintendent   of\r\n\r\nPolice, but, invariably, the investigation part of\r\n\r\nit  must  be  done by the rank and file.  I  have,\r\n\r\nduring  my  short term here, received a number  of\r\n\r\ncomplaints  about  detectives  putting  fear  into\r\n\r\npeace-loving citizens by telling them,  \"You  play\r\n\r\nball  with us, otherwise we might book you in  for\r\n\r\nthis.\"  This is very serious, and I bring  forward\r\n\r\nthis  point of view because in the Public Security\r\n\r\nBill   there  is  power  given  to  the   ordinary\r\n\r\nInspector   to  search  a  house  and  arrest   on\r\n\r\nsuspicion.  I  believe that must be  rectified  to\r\n\r\nmake   it  safer  for  peace-loving  citizens   to\r\n\r\nconsider  that  their home is  their  castle,  and\r\n\r\nunless there is very strong suspicion, this  power\r\n\r\nshould never be used at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have just recently heard of an offer of\r\n\r\namnesty  offered by the Government  to  subversive\r\n\r\nelements. What does this amnesty tell us?  Is  the\r\n\r\nsituation  getting worse, or is still  normal,  or\r\n\r\nhas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  gone  better? It must have pointed to  one  of\r\n\r\nthese  three.  I should say that such  an  amnesty\r\n\r\noffer  does indicate that the situation is getting\r\n\r\nmore  normal, because I should like to think  that\r\n\r\nsuch  a  measure is indicative as being  the  last\r\n\r\nround for subversive elements to come out so  that\r\n\r\nwe can again lead our normal way of life. If it is\r\n\r\ngoing  to give us peace, as we hope it would  give\r\n\r\nus  peace,  then I think to put this Bill  in  the\r\n\r\nform  of the Public Security Bill for three  years\r\n\r\nwould  not be justifiable. We do not know  whether\r\n\r\nthis  Emergency situation will end in three months\r\n\r\nor  in six months, or whatever time it may be, but\r\n\r\nmy  contention  is that the moment  the  Emergency\r\n\r\nsituation  eases, then we must let  the  Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations lapse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparing the two Bills - the established Bill,\r\n\r\nwhich is the Emergency Regulations, and the second\r\n\r\none, this Public Security Bill - I would prefer that\r\n\r\nthe  Emergency Regulations remain as they  are  so\r\n\r\nthat we can have a review every three months.  You\r\n\r\nwill  gather, from what I have said, that  we  are\r\n\r\nnot  in favour of the present Public Security Bill\r\n\r\non  the point of the length of time and the  power\r\n\r\nit  might give to the Police - especially the junior\r\n\r\npolice officers. This power, as I have said, given\r\n\r\nto  them  must  be very carefully  considered.  An\r\n\r\nexperienced  man need not have much guidance,  but\r\n\r\nraw  hands may sometimes provoke serious incidents\r\n\r\nwhich  might undermine the faith of the people  in\r\n\r\nthe police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am talking in this trend because I feel that we\r\n\r\nshould  have  the  people  co-operating  with   the\r\n\r\npolice, and every step that we take should  strive\r\n\r\ntowards this end. I hope that the Government  will\r\n\r\nconsider  what I put forward to them in the  light\r\n\r\nthat it is for the good of all concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  proposed new legislation, as we  see  it,  is\r\n\r\nmerely  a  subterfuge to a large  extent  for  the\r\n\r\nexisting    Emergency   Regulations.   The    only\r\n\r\ndifference   which  I  welcome  as  a  substantial\r\n\r\nimprovement  is  that  an  Appeal  Tribunal,  with\r\n\r\napparent real power, will sit in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplace    of    the    Advisory   Committee    whose\r\n\r\nresponsibility  is to make recommendations  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernor  who may either accept or reject  them  at\r\n\r\nhis pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear that Government still\r\n\r\nrecognises  the need for Emergency powers,  and  by\r\n\r\nintroducing  the  proposed legislation  (which,  if\r\n\r\napproved,  will be incorporated into  the  ordinary\r\n\r\nlaws  of the Colony) it seeks to retain these  oft-criticised  Emergency powers on  a  more  permanent\r\n\r\ninstead of a temporary basis, subject to review and\r\n\r\nextension once in every three months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in view of the several amendments\r\n\r\njust  proposed by the Hon. the Chief  Minister,  in\r\n\r\nview   of  the  Chief  Minister's  desire  not   to\r\n\r\nlegislate  the  Bill  today  but  to  put   it   in\r\n\r\nCommittee,  and  in  view of the  Chief  Minister's\r\n\r\nassurance that further constructive suggestions and\r\n\r\ncriticisms   will   be   considered   and   further\r\n\r\namendments,  if any, and if desirable, be  adopted,\r\n\r\nmy Party will reserve our position until then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although I\r\n\r\nam  a schoolmaster by profession, it is no part  of\r\n\r\nmy  normal duties to ensure that the Members of the\r\n\r\nOpposition do their homework. They have  come  into\r\n\r\nthis Assembly today and, in their speeches, some of\r\n\r\nthem  have  given considerable evidence  that  they\r\n\r\nhave  not done their homework. They have apparently\r\n\r\nnot   read  the  Bill.  They  have  not  read   the\r\n\r\namendments.  They  have not even  listened  to  the\r\n\r\nspeeches  in  the Assembly, but still I  will  pass\r\n\r\nthis by because those things are in the public  eye\r\n\r\nand will remain so, no doubt.

I think  that\r\n\r\nhe  went extremely far in questioning our integrity\r\n\r\nand  later  the integrity of the Judges; as  indeed\r\n\r\nthe   People's  Action  Party  makes  a  habit   of\r\n\r\nquestioning the integrity of almost anybody who  is\r\n\r\nnot a Party member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, our pre-election pledges are contained in\r\n\r\nthis  little  booklet.

The  heading is  \"The  Repressive Laws\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The situation in Singapore does not warrant the\r\n\r\ncontinuation of the Emergency Regulations and  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front  will  seek  the  removal  of   this\r\n\r\nunnecessary  and undemocratic restriction  on  the\r\n\r\nliberty of the people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"The  situation does not warrant this  unnecessary\r\n\r\nrestriction\" - I hope you will pay attention to  the\r\n\r\nwording  because that is not a categorical promise\r\n\r\nto  repeal  the  Regulations.  It  is  a  definite\r\n\r\nstatement  that,  in a certain situation,  certain\r\n\r\naction will be taken and if the situation changes,\r\n\r\nthe action will necessarily change too. We did not\r\n\r\nsay that we would repeal the Emergency Regulations\r\n\r\nat  any cost. What we said was, \"The situation, as\r\n\r\nwe  see  it  now,  looks good and  promising.  The\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations  are therefore  unnecessary\r\n\r\nand unwarranted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition can, if they like - they have not\r\n\r\ndone  so - accuse us of being \"political innocents\"\r\n\r\nand  of being unduly optimistic. They can say that\r\n\r\nwe  were blind to the real dangers around us. They\r\n\r\ncan   say  that  we  were  unrealistic  about  the\r\n\r\nstrength  of  the  Communist menace,  and  I  will\r\n\r\nfreely  admit  that  when we were  drafting  these\r\n\r\nPrinciples  and Aims and this Four-Year Programme,\r\n\r\nI,  for  one, did not foresee that riots would  be\r\n\r\nfomented  in the streets of Singapore. I  did  not\r\n\r\nforesee  innocent people would be beaten to  death\r\n\r\nin  the  streets.  I  did  not  foresee  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Factory and Shop Workers'  Union  would\r\n\r\nhave  a  Communist as its President, nor  that  he\r\n\r\nwould  be  put into open court, prosecuted,  tried\r\n\r\nand convicted. I could not foresee those things. I\r\n\r\ndid not foresee that a harmless schoolboy would be\r\n\r\nshot down in the open street by a Communist killer\r\n\r\nsquad.  I  had not imagined that kind of activity,\r\n\r\nbut  it  happened.  We did not  foresee  the  full\r\n\r\ngravity  of the attack that would be made as  soon\r\n\r\nas  democracy  began to grow in strength  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry. The People's Action Party may have  known\r\n\r\nbetter. If so, I am afraid, in that case, I cannot\r\n\r\ncongratulate  them on their close acquaintanceship\r\n\r\nwith the forces of destruction. We did not realise\r\n\r\nthe  full  danger. We have had to learn by  bitter\r\n\r\nexperience. We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  be  accused of past optimism; but  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  we can be accused of lack of courage or  of\r\n\r\nshirking the realities of the present situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this Government came into power, the\r\n\r\nsituation has changed in many ways. It has changed\r\n\r\nvery  much  for  the  better with  regard  to  our\r\n\r\nprospects of early self-government. It has changed\r\n\r\nvery  much  for  the  better with  regard  to  our\r\n\r\nprospects  for trade, particularly with Indonesia.\r\n\r\nThere  are  many points on which we  can  say  the\r\n\r\nsituation  is  much better. But we must  also  say\r\n\r\nthat  the situation is worse in this respect: that\r\n\r\nthe Communist machine has gone into action, as  it\r\n\r\nalways  does  go  into action when  it  sees  that\r\n\r\ndemocracy  is  starting to grow up  and  establish\r\n\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual need has arisen, and we must legislate\r\n\r\nnow  to  meet the actual need and not to meet  the\r\n\r\nsituation  of nine months ago. I do not think  the\r\n\r\nOpposition will profess to say that the  situation\r\n\r\nhas  not,  in  some  respects,  deteriorated.  The\r\n\r\nterrorist situation has not deteriorated. I  think\r\n\r\nthey will have to admit that. What they may try to\r\n\r\nsay  is  that,  in enunciating the principle  that\r\n\r\nlaws  are  not  eternal  and  that  laws  must  be\r\n\r\nadjusted to the needs of the moment, they may  say\r\n\r\nthat,  in saying that, I am putting forward a  new\r\n\r\nand unheard-of principle. They rather tend to talk\r\n\r\nin  terms  of absolutes and to say that  democracy\r\n\r\nresides  in  one particular law and that  kind  of\r\n\r\nthing. Now, this is not a new principle at all. It\r\n\r\nis  a principle which was accepted just now by the\r\n\r\nMember for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong). He said\r\n\r\nthat  extraordinary situations need  extraordinary\r\n\r\nlaws.  It was a principle put forward by the great\r\n\r\nGreek law-giver Solon more than two thousand years\r\n\r\nago,  and also by the Chinese teacher Mo Tzu about\r\n\r\nthe  same  time; but I expect that  those  classic\r\n\r\nexamples  may  not appeal to all  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition. Perhaps they prefer to have the  words\r\n\r\nof  the Soviet jurist, Krylenko. He has since been\r\n\r\nliquidated,   but,  in  his  time,   he   was   an\r\n\r\nestablished   authority.  He  said,  \"At   certain\r\n\r\nmoments in history, we quite consciously sacrifice\r\n\r\nall these guarantees\" (that is, the guarantees  of\r\n\r\njustice through\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnormal  court  procedure) \"to the  necessity  of  a\r\n\r\nswift revolutionary struggle.\" The fact is that  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  admire the Communist model. We are against\r\n\r\nit. We can take Mr Krylenko as a practical man. He\r\n\r\nknew  the relative instability and unpopularity  of\r\n\r\nhis  government, and he knew that it was  necessary\r\n\r\nto  defend  it. But the fact is that this principle\r\n\r\nthat  laws are not eternal - the principle that  laws\r\n\r\nmust  meet  the needs of the moment - is a world-wide\r\n\r\nprinciple  which stands and will always stand.  The\r\n\r\nquestion  is:What are the laws that are  needed  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  deal with terrorism  and  subversion\r\n\r\ntoday in 1955? That is the question we have to deal\r\n\r\nwith,  and the Opposition, in considering  it,  has\r\n\r\ndismissed  it  with  a wave of  its  hand,  Saying,\r\n\r\n\"India,  Pakistan and Burma - Oh no, we  cannot  take\r\n\r\nthose countries as our models because they are free\r\n\r\ndemocracies,  and  here we are still  tainted  with\r\n\r\ncolonialism!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> They would not be here\r\n\r\notherwise!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Well, shall I give them another\r\n\r\nexample  from Russia?

This  is\r\n\r\na  decree  of  December,  1934,  for  dealing  with\r\n\r\nterrorism:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum period of investigation - 10 days;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused receives a copy of the charge only 24\r\n\r\nhours before he is brought to trial;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused is denied any right to defence;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused is denied any right to appeal;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused is excluded specifically from any\r\n\r\npossible amnesty; and finally,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sentence of shooting is to be carried out im\r\n\r\nmediately after the trial is concluded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is  how  Big  Brother in  Russia  deals  with\r\n\r\nanybody  who tries to rise up against him!

That is how the  Communists\r\n\r\nrule  their own country. I do not hold it up as  an\r\n\r\nexample for this House to follow. I hold it up as a\r\n\r\nwarning  of  what  will be imposed  on  us  by  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  if they can get control. That  is  what\r\n\r\nyou  will have if you allow these subversive forces\r\n\r\nto  catch  hold of the Government and  to  dominate\r\n\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We here are not, thank God, concerned with\r\n\r\ndefending the totalitarian system in which unity is\r\n\r\nimposed  by repression. Perhaps I ought to  digress\r\n\r\nhere  for  a moment because the Member for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  (Mr  Lee Kuan Yew), coming  down  from  his\r\n\r\ncloud  of  rhetoric, became rather  heated  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion of what totalitarianism is. He appeared to\r\n\r\nthink that totalitarianism resided in some specific\r\n\r\nitem or law - which is a complete misapprehension. In\r\n\r\ncase  he  does not accept my word for  it,  I  have\r\n\r\nbrought in here a standard political dictionary  by\r\n\r\nTheimer  and Campbell - an encyclopaedia, in fact - and\r\n\r\nif  he likes me to refer to it, I will refer to  it\r\n\r\nfor him. Briefly, I will sum it up by saying that a\r\n\r\ntotalitarian state is a concept which was coined by\r\n\r\nMussolini in the early 1920's, and it means a State\r\n\r\nin  which every single activity, every association,\r\n\r\nevery  individual, and everything in the State,  is\r\n\r\nwelded  by  force  into a single monolith  directed\r\n\r\nfrom  the  top. That is totalitarianism, and  every\r\n\r\nactivity, even the thoughts of the children and the\r\n\r\nthoughts  of  the  adult, are subordinated  to  the\r\n\r\nState.  For  a man who is respected and admired  by\r\n\r\nmany   people  in  this  city,  to  use  the   word\r\n\r\n\"totalitarianism\"  and thereby to  seek  to  accuse\r\n\r\nIndia,  Pakistan  and Burma, and  many  other  free\r\n\r\ncountries  of  being  totalitarian,  is   to   talk\r\n\r\nnonsense. I would not put it more highly than that,\r\n\r\nbut   I  would  suggest  to  hon.  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  that when they use words,  they  should\r\n\r\nuse  them with respect for their meanings, and they\r\n\r\nshould   not  try  to  arouse  feelings  by   using\r\n\r\nemotional words when they know very well that those\r\n\r\nwords would not, in fact, hold water -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.\r\n\r\nWould  the  Minister for Communications  and  Works\r\n\r\ndescribe  the  laws  that I  have  referred  to  as\r\n\r\ndemocratic?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> It is a point to which I am coming,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, if the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  can\r\n\r\ncontain his impatience for a moment.

I endorse a good deal of what  he  said,\r\n\r\nbut  I  suggest that he remember this:  that  when\r\n\r\nBurma  cast  off  the colonial  system  and  freed\r\n\r\nitself  from  imperialism,  it  was  then  that  a\r\n\r\nCommunist  walked  into the Cabinet  Chamber  and,\r\n\r\nwith  his  tommygun, wiped out  practically  the\r\n\r\nentire  democratic government of  Burma.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Communists will always seek  to  do  to\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  They know that they have  no  hope  of\r\n\r\nwinning  power by democratic methods, and as  soon\r\n\r\nas  democracy looks strong, they set out  to  kill\r\n\r\nit.  That  is  what will happen here as  democracy\r\n\r\ngrows stronger here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another People's Action Party statement on the\r\n\r\n26th  of  April cried out, with an  air  of  great\r\n\r\nconviction,   that  no  law  should  hinder   free\r\n\r\nassociation, free speech and free publication, and\r\n\r\nthat  no  consideration of security  should  weigh\r\n\r\nagainst the principle of freedom. That was said by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tanjong Pagar. He is a lawyer - and I\r\n\r\nam  told he is a very able one - but he showed  less\r\n\r\nthan the legal precision of thought when he sought\r\n\r\nto proclaim the principle of absolute unrestricted\r\n\r\nfreedom - for anybody to say anything he likes;  to\r\n\r\npublish anything he likes; for any group of people\r\n\r\nto  associate  together for any  purpose  to  take\r\n\r\njoint action of any sort -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information,\r\n\r\nSir.

[Interruption.] The\r\n\r\npoint at issue is the matter of a speech which was\r\n\r\nmade  on the 26th of April. I do not think we need\r\n\r\ndally any longer over it. As I read it, it appears\r\n\r\nto me to be using words in a very cloudy and vague\r\n\r\nway,  as  the  People's Action Party  often  does,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  feel that if they  become  precise,\r\n\r\nthey  have to say things they do not like. As long\r\n\r\nas  they can keep broadly to absolute freedom,  it\r\n\r\nis  all right, but when coming down to details, it\r\n\r\ngets  more difficult. The fact, of course, is that\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member knows perfectly well, as everybody\r\n\r\nknows  that  freedom depends on  law  and  not  on\r\n\r\nabsence of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this very Assembly, Mr Speaker, Sir, we meet\r\n\r\nfreely  for  democratic  purposes.  We  have  free\r\n\r\nspeech  and  what we say is freely published,  but\r\n\r\nthe  whole  freedom of working  in  this  Assembly\r\n\r\ndepends,  Mr Speaker, on our Standing Orders  and\r\n\r\non  the  very  considerable powers which  you,  as\r\n\r\nSpeaker, exercise under the Standing Orders.  Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  who  do  not know their  Standing  Orders\r\n\r\nshould  look  at pages 16 and 17 where  they  will\r\n\r\nfind  that Mr Speaker has powers without  appeal;\r\n\r\nnot  merely  to  say, \"Sit down\", but  to  control\r\n\r\npeople, to suspend them and even, if necessary, to\r\n\r\nremove  them  by  force from the Chamber  if  they\r\n\r\nbehave in a grossly disorderly way. If this honourable,  learned  and  respected  House  cannot  run\r\n\r\nfreely  without  having controls -  very  arbitrary\r\n\r\ncontrols - in  the hands of Mr Speaker to  suppress\r\n\r\nany  individual or individuals who  behave  badly.\r\n\r\nthen I think it is fair to say that the government\r\n\r\nof  a country must also have reasonable powers  in\r\n\r\norder  that  it should also be able to  deal  with\r\n\r\npeople  who  are setting out to subvert  democracy\r\n\r\nand to destroy freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I am trying to make is that to abandon\r\n\r\nthe  rule of law in the name of theoretical freedom\r\n\r\nwill, in fact, often make freedom impossible, and I\r\n\r\nam  sure that when the Member for Tanjong Pagar and\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Bukit Timah come down  from  their\r\n\r\nrosy cloud of rhetoric to the cool thought which  I\r\n\r\nhope  they sometimes take, they will realise  that\r\n\r\nlaw  is  the basis of freedom and not the enemy  of\r\n\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Action Party habitually prophesy\r\n\r\nthat  dire  calamity will follow  if  anybody  does\r\n\r\nanything  that  the People's Action  Party  do  not\r\n\r\nlike.  The  Progressives  have  sometimes  shown  a\r\n\r\ntendency  to  blow other people's trumpets  and  to\r\n\r\nborrow  other people's clothes, and they  sometimes\r\n\r\ntry  to  follow the People's Action Party  line.  I\r\n\r\nmust,   however,   congratulate  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nSerangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong) who made undoubtedly\r\n\r\nthe  best  speech we have heard from the Opposition\r\n\r\ntoday  by  a  very long way. Although the  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party  prophecies  have  almost  invariably\r\n\r\nproved wrong in the past, they still fret and fume\r\n\r\nand  cry havoc. They still bellow out, \"Freedom  is\r\n\r\nin  danger! Trade unionism is in danger! Everything\r\n\r\nis in danger! Vote for the P.A.P.!\" It is true that\r\n\r\nthere is danger, but the danger does not lie in the\r\n\r\ndirection  which the P.A.P. seeks to indicate.  The\r\n\r\ndanger  does  not stand in the open light  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly   and   in  the  open  workings   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. The danger lurks in the backstreets and\r\n\r\nin  the  lorongs;  in  the network  of  underground\r\n\r\nsubversion;  in intimidation by word and  deed,  by\r\n\r\nthreat  and  by  murder. The  danger  lies  in  the\r\n\r\ndeliberate  dissemination of hatred,  distrust  and\r\n\r\nfalsehood,  as  conscious and purposeful  means  of\r\n\r\npolitical action.

We have our\r\n\r\nresponsibility to the people of the country, and we\r\n\r\nshould carry out that responsibility with the  full\r\n\r\nsense  that  we  are trying to give leadership  and\r\n\r\nguidance where it is very much needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Theng Chiang (Rochore):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  see  that the Opposition is almost unanimous  in\r\n\r\ntheir  attack on the Public Security Bill.  It  was\r\n\r\nonly  to  be  expected and it is also natural  that\r\n\r\nthey  should  point out to us that, by  introducing\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  we  are  going  against  our  election\r\n\r\npledges.  However,  none  of  them  has  taken  the\r\n\r\ntrouble  to  analyse  the causes  of  the  wave  of\r\n\r\nstrikes  we have had in Singapore since the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  took office some six months ago. No one  can\r\n\r\ndeny  that  some strikes at least are  inspired  by\r\n\r\nforces  which do not have the welfare of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  at heart. Nor can anyone  deny  that\r\n\r\nthere are Communist sympathisers in Singapore.  Yet\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Government took the opportunity  of  the\r\n\r\ngrant  of amnesty in the Federation to offer  local\r\n\r\nCommunists the chance to surrender themselves,  the\r\n\r\nresponse has been practically nil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also escaped the notice of our opponents\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  is still a Crown Colony  and  that\r\n\r\nsubversive  elements under the cloak of nationalism\r\n\r\nare   fomenting  discontent  among   the   innocent\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When sovereign Republics such as India, Pakistan\r\n\r\nand Burma have such laws, there is no reason why we\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  while  we are  striving  for  self-government  and ultimate independence,  should  not\r\n\r\ntake  measures to maintain law and order,  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  colonial powers may not use any disorder  that\r\n\r\nmay  prevail  in  the  country  as  an  excuse  for\r\n\r\ndelaying  the grant of self-government.

It  is  indeed  a  tragedy  that  certain\r\n\r\nprofessional unionists have infiltrated  into  some\r\n\r\nunions  with no other motive than to promote  their\r\n\r\nown  interests  and  for their  own  glorification.\r\n\r\nUntil the workers realise that they are being duped\r\n\r\nand  learn to manage their own affairs, it will  be\r\n\r\nin  the  interests of the people if the  Government\r\n\r\ntake steps to ensure that they are not subjected to\r\n\r\nunnecessary suffering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House provides for safeguards\r\n\r\nagainst  arbitrary  arrest and  detention,  and  if\r\n\r\nanyone  is  subjected  to such  treatment,  he  can\r\n\r\nappeal  to a Tribunal consisting of two High  Court\r\n\r\nJudges  and  a  District Judge.

When\r\n\r\nwe  were returned to power, I was still of the mind\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  have  the  Emergency  Regulations\r\n\r\nrepealed, but in May, just one month after we  were\r\n\r\nreturned to power, Sir, our friends over there, not\r\n\r\nall  may be, but our friends over there, with their\r\n\r\nfriends  in  the Bus Workers' Union  and  in  other\r\n\r\nunions, were responsible for the riots of May  12th\r\n\r\nand  responsible for the deaths of so many innocent\r\n\r\npeople. It is because of that, Sir, that I now feel\r\n\r\nthat  such Regulations cannot, and should  not,  be\r\n\r\nrepealed  in  the interests of public security.  If\r\n\r\nthere  is  any blame to be attached for introducing\r\n\r\nthis Preservation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Public  Security Bill, it  is  because  of  the\r\n\r\nactivities  of people such as those represented  by\r\n\r\nthe other side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many trade unionists now say that this Bill\r\n\r\nwill react to the detriment of trade unionism,  and\r\n\r\nyet,  Sir, since we came into power in April  until\r\n\r\nnow, there have been 213 strikes, 162 of which  can\r\n\r\nbe  attributed  to friends of the P.A.P.  Can  they\r\n\r\nhonestly   say   that  the  Emergency   Regulations\r\n\r\nrestrict  their activities? Can they  honestly  say\r\n\r\nthat?   In  1953  and 1954 - two  years - the  total\r\n\r\namounted  to  only thirteen strikes as against  213\r\n\r\nwithin  five months this year! They say  that  this\r\n\r\nlaw will restrict the freedom of assembly, and yet,\r\n\r\nsince  the  Labour Coalition Government  came  into\r\n\r\nbeing,  we have, I do not know how many times,  had\r\n\r\npickets   outside  this  Assembly.  Is  there   any\r\n\r\nrestriction on the freedom of assembly? They should\r\n\r\nask  themselves  that, instead of coming  here  and\r\n\r\ntalking in high-faulting language about restriction\r\n\r\non  the freedom of trade unionists, restriction  on\r\n\r\nthe  freedom of association, movement and assembly.\r\n\r\nI have received this morning a memorandum issued on\r\n\r\nbehalf of 94 trade unions at a meeting held in  the\r\n\r\npremises   of   the  City  Council  Labour   Unions\r\n\r\nFederation.  Can  that  Federation  say,   in   all\r\n\r\nhonesty,  that the Emergency Regulations  prevented\r\n\r\nthem  from  striking last year and this year?  They\r\n\r\ncannot  say  that! Can they honesty  say  that  the\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations were ever used against  them\r\n\r\nin  their  strikes? They have never been used!  The\r\n\r\nfact  is  that  their strike was  a  constitutional\r\n\r\nstrike,  and there was no reason why the Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations should be applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another illustration, Sir. As the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nhas  said,  Mr Yong Kok Kim, who was the President\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore Factory and Shop Workers' Union,\r\n\r\nwas  charged  in open court and was sentenced.  Did\r\n\r\nthe  Government take any action against the  Union?\r\n\r\nNo,  he was charged not because of his trade  union\r\n\r\nactivities, but he was charged and sent  to  prison\r\n\r\nbecause  of his subversive activities. So can  they\r\n\r\nsay   that  the  Emergency  Regulations   or   this\r\n\r\nPreservation of Public Security Bill  is  aimed  at\r\n\r\ntrade unions? Definitely not!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This memorandum I referred to just now, Sir, is\r\n\r\nsigned  by  Mr Jamit Singh, Secretary  to  the  94\r\n\r\nunions and Secretary of the Singapore Harbour Board\r\n\r\nStaff  Association. They called a strike this year.\r\n\r\nWere the Emergency Regulations ever applied in that\r\n\r\nstrike? No, they were free to strike and, in  fact,\r\n\r\nthey were even assisted in their claims by a number\r\n\r\nof other unions. But did we take action against the\r\n\r\nother  unions?  No, because those  activities  were\r\n\r\ngenuine trade union activities. Therefore,  I  want\r\n\r\nto say again and I would ask our friends over there\r\n\r\nto  search  their own hearts whether this  law  was\r\n\r\never used against trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong)\r\n\r\nsaid that it would be better if we had stuck to our\r\n\r\nEmergency Regulations and come back to the Assembly\r\n\r\nevery  three  months for renewal.  Sir,  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  has said that the security of the  public\r\n\r\nis  not  an  emergency. Therefore it  is  wrong  to\r\n\r\ndescribe that as an emergency, and this law that we\r\n\r\nseek  to  introduce for three years does  not  mean\r\n\r\nthat  it  will live for three years. If a situation\r\n\r\narises where there is no further need for it, there\r\n\r\nwill  be no need to use the powers given under this\r\n\r\nlaw  at  all. The Chief Minister says, \"It  is  the\r\n\r\nprimary  and  supreme  duty of  any  government  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  the  safety  and  security   of   its\r\n\r\ncitizens\", and this Bill, Sir, seeks to provide for\r\n\r\nthat safety and security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

If it please\r\n\r\nyou, Sir, of all the speeches we heard this morning\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Opposition, it seems to me the one  that\r\n\r\nreally  represents the feelings of the  decent  and\r\n\r\nloyal citizens of Singapore was the one made  by  a\r\n\r\nNominated  Member, the hon. Mr Ong  Piah  Teng - his\r\n\r\nrepugnance, his keen anxiety, his gratitude for the\r\n\r\nimprovements    effected,   and    his    reluctant\r\n\r\nacceptance.  I can assure him that, for  our  part,\r\n\r\nthere   is  no  question  of  being  pleased  about\r\n\r\nbringing  before this Assembly and placing  on  the\r\n\r\nStatute book the perpetuation of a law that  is  an\r\n\r\ninroad into the democratic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprocess.  There is no question about that.  We  are\r\n\r\nnot  proud  of having to do it, but in  facing  our\r\n\r\nresponsibilities, we do have to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, much has been made, and that, to my\r\n\r\nsurprise, by the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr  Lee\r\n\r\nKuan Yew), including every member of his Party,  of\r\n\r\na  suggestion  that  I have broken  faith  with  my\r\n\r\nelectorate  and questioning my political integrity.\r\n\r\nSir,  it has been suggested that every time we want\r\n\r\na measure of this character, we should dissolve the\r\n\r\nHouse  and  go  before the public  and  have  fresh\r\n\r\nelections.  It may be that the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar is even a greater political innocent than  he\r\n\r\npretends  I  am,  but I must confess  that  I  have\r\n\r\nnever,  at  any  time, read  or  heard  of  such  a\r\n\r\nfantastic procedure. I would say to him one  thing,\r\n\r\nSir - it  may be necessary for him and his  Party  to\r\n\r\nindulge in that sort of conduct, but for myself,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  have to wait till the end of the  term  of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  in order to face my  electorate.  I\r\n\r\nface  my  electorate every day. Cairnhill  sits  in\r\n\r\njudgment  on Marshall every single day. During  the\r\n\r\nelection,  and since then - last week was  the  last\r\n\r\ntime  I  reiterated it - I have made a solemn promise\r\n\r\nto the electorate, which no Member opposite has had\r\n\r\nthe  courage to do, that if the time ever came when\r\n\r\nhalf the voters in my Division decided that they no\r\n\r\nlonger had faith in me, they could ask me to leave.\r\n\r\nSingapore  can  speak through Cairnhill  today  and\r\n\r\ntomorrow, and the day after tomorrow. I do not have\r\n\r\nto go running to my electorate every time I think a\r\n\r\nmeasure  is necessary for their welfare.  I  am  on\r\n\r\ntrial there every day. There can be no question  of\r\n\r\nbreach  of faith with my electorate. I do not  seek\r\n\r\nthis  position against the wishes of the people  of\r\n\r\nthe country, Sir, and I should imagine that if hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  opposite, one of whom my young friend  the\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching Siong) has so\r\n\r\nostentatiously refused to answer the question as to\r\n\r\nwhere  his loyalty lies - whether it is to Singapore\r\n\r\nor  to  Communism - I should imagine that it  is  not\r\n\r\nbeyond  their  capacity to organise  a  petition - if\r\n\r\nthey really had any faith\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the suggestion that the people of Singapore  or\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Cairnhill would want to  reject  me\r\n\r\nbecause of this law which I now think necessary  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  for their welfare.

Sir, the  Communists  could\r\n\r\ninterpret anything into anything as it suits  them.\r\n\r\nRed is black and filth is something you can eat and\r\n\r\nshove  down the throats of the poor workers.

Then  we come to the Member  for  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah  (Mr Lim Ching Siong) whose speech and whose\r\n\r\nfuture speeches must now be viewed in the light  of\r\n\r\nhis  unhappy refusal to inform this House  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore of where his loyalty lies.  He\r\n\r\nhas told us, Sir, that this is a colonial law, that\r\n\r\nit is a betrayal of the interests of the people for\r\n\r\nthe  interests of colonialism, and that  it  is  an\r\n\r\nenemy  of democratic liberties. Well, Sir, I should\r\n\r\nlike for a moment to envisage what would happen - and\r\n\r\nI  hope  that  those who are from India  here  will\r\n\r\nforgive me - if this were repeated in India which has\r\n\r\nan  identical law. I take it then, by analogy, that\r\n\r\nIndia  is  introducing and perpetuating a  colonial\r\n\r\nlaw  for  the betrayal of the people of the country\r\n\r\nin the interest of colonialism and that India is an\r\n\r\nenemy   of   democratic  liberties.  It   will   be\r\n\r\nremembered  that the Bill before the House  is  far\r\n\r\nmore  liberal than the law that has been and is  in\r\n\r\nforce in India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said, Sir, \"What public security can\r\n\r\nthere  be  when a man can - be arrested and detained\r\n\r\nwithout trial?\" Has he stopped to think what public\r\n\r\nsecurity can there be when police officers  can  be\r\n\r\nshot   to   death   and   witnesses   killed    and\r\n\r\nintimidated - which  is  happening  and   which   has\r\n\r\nhappened - what public security can there be?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, we come, Sir, to the pink barbiturates of\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is good, is it not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

The answer,\r\n\r\nSir, is this: The Emergency Regulations of the past\r\n\r\nand the Public Security Bill of today will not cure\r\n\r\nthis  country  of Communism. All it can  do  is  to\r\n\r\ncontain  it,  to lessen its possible  effect  until\r\n\r\nsuch time as the tender growth of democracy in this\r\n\r\nterritory  is  sufficiently strong and  flourishing\r\n\r\nthat the forces of evil and their vitriolic hatred,\r\n\r\nwhich  pours out of them like sap out of  a  rubber\r\n\r\ntree,  cease to have the vicious effects they  have\r\n\r\nin blinding the people of the country to their true\r\n\r\nwelfare. That is all this Bill is expected to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong) has\r\n\r\nmade  somewhat serious charges against  members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Police  Force and asks us to  view  them  with\r\n\r\nsuspicion. Sir, it is this Force which protects his\r\n\r\nlife,  his safety, his property and his honour.  It\r\n\r\nis  this Force which makes it possible for him  and\r\n\r\nfor the rest of us in this country to walk about in\r\n\r\npeace,  without fear of molestation, and I feel  it\r\n\r\ncomes  ill  to  make  accusations  of  so  vague  a\r\n\r\ncharacter  about the Force which has proved  itself\r\n\r\nworthy  of our gratitude in times of stress and  in\r\n\r\ntimes  of  peace.  If  he has complaints  with  any\r\n\r\nbasis, it is surely a matter of elementary courtesy\r\n\r\nand  decency  that  the details  should  have  been\r\n\r\ncommunicated  to the Chief Secretary or  to  myself\r\n\r\nand investigated? I trust, Sir, that he will, at  a\r\n\r\nnot  too distant future, take an opportunity either\r\n\r\nto   withdraw  those  unhappy  allegations  or   to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate them. It is easy to attack  those  who\r\n\r\ncannot hit you back, and I feel that that is not  a\r\n\r\ngesture  which the Member for Serangoon would  care\r\n\r\nto make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, one novel suggestion comes from the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Seletar. He asks us now that we have got  this\r\n\r\nnew  Bill  to release the old criminals. I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow where the logic is, but I would like to assure\r\n\r\nhim  that his suggestion has certainly given me  an\r\n\r\nidea  and  perhaps we can work it out in Committee.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  we can work out, Sir, a provision  whereby\r\n\r\nthose who have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndetained  in  the  past  can  be  given  the   full\r\n\r\nprotection   of  the  provisions  of  the   present\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  including the right of  appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nAppeal Tribunal in spite of having failed in  their\r\n\r\npast  appeals.  I am not promising anything  except\r\n\r\nthat  I  would like to consider that idea which  he\r\n\r\nhas given us today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final thing, Sir, and it comes as a surprise\r\n\r\nto  me: it is that not a single Member opposite, in\r\n\r\nconsidering the provisions of this Bill,  has  seen\r\n\r\nfit  to  refer  to our duty to the Federation -  not\r\n\r\none.  The Federation, it seems, does not exist when\r\n\r\nit  comes to indulging in political manoeuvring but\r\n\r\nwe,  On  this side of the House, have  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility and we will not forget our  duty  to\r\n\r\nthose across the Straits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor has any single Member of the Opposition\r\n\r\nsuggested  how  we  can meet  this  threat  to  the\r\n\r\nsecurity  of  the  people  and  of  the  individual\r\n\r\nwithout  extra-judicial powers.

We\r\n\r\nhope, therefore, that they will no longer be needed\r\n\r\nafter  that  period  and,  accordingly,  all  these\r\n\r\nvarious  matters have been put together  into  this\r\n\r\none Bill which, by sub-clause 2 of clause 1, is  to\r\n\r\nremain  in force for a period of only three  years.\r\n\r\nAs  the  title  of  the Bill indicates,  these  are\r\n\r\ntemporary additions to our criminal laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part I of the Bill deals with definitions\r\n\r\napplicable throughout the Bill and needs no further\r\n\r\nexplanation from me at this stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II is directed at the Malayan Communist\r\n\r\nParty  and  its killer squads, who seek  to  impose\r\n\r\ntheir  rule  by murder, arson and intimidation.  It\r\n\r\nprovides  increased penalties for those who  attack\r\n\r\nlife or property by the use of explosives, and  for\r\n\r\nthose  who  consort with them. It also  deals  with\r\n\r\nthose who furnish supplies to these people who seek\r\n\r\nto undermine public security, and it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovides   penalties  for  the   making   and   the\r\n\r\npossession  of subversive documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust that this House will accept the necessity for these\r\n\r\nadmittedly stern measures in order to deal with the\r\n\r\nruthless  and  secret  activities  of  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party.
