Firstly, historically close ties between the\r\n\r\ntwo countries gave Singapore retail investors a keen interest in\r\n\r\nMalaysian   companies.   They  wanted  to  invest  in  Malaysian\r\n\r\ncompanies  even after the KLSE and the SES parted ways  in  1973\r\n\r\nand  Malaysian counters were delisted from the SES in 1990.  And\r\n\r\nsecondly,  Clob  made  it  much more  convenient  for  Singapore\r\n\r\ninvestors  to  buy  Malaysian  shares.   Investors  here   could\r\n\r\ntransact  in S$ without being exposed to foreign currency  risk;\r\n\r\nand  they  could deal through Singapore brokers, with whom  they\r\n\r\nwere more familiar.  This was why Clob was successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the cessation of the trading of Malaysian shares on\r\n\r\nClob in September 1998, retail investor interest has shifted  to\r\n\r\nSingapore shares listed on the SES.  This can be seen  from  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the turnover on SES.  From October 1998  to  March\r\n\r\n1999, SES recorded an average monthly turnover of S$9.8 billion.\r\n\r\nThis  figure,  without  Clob trading, is  63%  higher  than  the\r\n\r\naverage of S$6.0 billion per month transacted in the same shares\r\n\r\nduring  the  8-month period (from January 1998 to  August  1998)\r\n\r\nbefore  Clob  ceased  trading in Malaysian counters.   The  main\r\n\r\nreason  is loss of convenience with the closure of Clob and  the\r\n\r\nimposition of capital controls in Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It therefore appears that investors on Clob have for now\r\n\r\nshifted their interest from Malaysian to Singapore shares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been accusations that Clob investors shorted\r\n\r\nMalaysian shares, and were responsible for the collapse  of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  stock market.  But very few institutions invested  in\r\n\r\nMalaysian  shares  through Clob.  SES figures  confirm  that  an\r\n\r\noverwhelming majority of Clob investors (in fact more than  98%)\r\n\r\nwere individuals rather than institutional investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent comprehensive analysis by the Singapore Business\r\n\r\nTimes, based on data obtained from SES, conclusively refuted the\r\n\r\ncharge that Clob caused the decline in the KL Stock Exchange.  I\r\n\r\nhave  circulated the full BT analysis to Members.  You can  find\r\n\r\nit on your seats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BT found no evidence of significant short-selling on Clob.\r\n\r\nJudging  by  share buy-ins by SES, short-selling of Clob  shares\r\n\r\nhad been negligible.  BT also analysed trading data on the three\r\n\r\ndays  each year which showed the largest falls in the KLCI,  for\r\n\r\nthe last five years. It found few Clob counters among the top 30\r\n\r\nlosing  stocks on those days.  Further, turnover in  these  Clob\r\n\r\ncounters was much lower than the corresponding turnover\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  the  KLSE - generally less than 5% of KLSE turnover for  the\r\n\r\nsame  counters.   This is hardly the picture of  rampant  short-selling on Clob.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BT studied more closely the period from the end of 1996,\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Asian crisis, up to 31st August 1998,  just  before\r\n\r\nMalaysia  imposed capital controls.  Mr Speaker, Sir, with  your\r\n\r\npermission,  I will ask the Clerk to distribute a chart  showing\r\n\r\nhow  the KL stock index as well as Clob investors' shareholdings\r\n\r\nmove  during  this  period.  [Copies of chart (Cols.  1665-1666)\r\n\r\ndistributed to hon. Members.]  Members will see from  the  chart\r\n\r\nthat  over  this period Clob holdings of Malaysian  shares  rose\r\n\r\nsteadily,  even as the KL Composite Index declined  continuously\r\n\r\nand  steeply  together with other regional stock  indices.   The\r\n\r\nKLCI  lost  three quarters of its value, falling from  1,238  on\r\n\r\n31st  December  1996  to  302 by 31st  August  1998.   But  Clob\r\n\r\ninvestors doubled their holdings of Malaysian shares,  from  5.7\r\n\r\nbillion  on  31st December 1996 to 11.7 billion on  31st  August\r\n\r\n1998.   This  is  counting the total number  of  shares.   Their\r\n\r\nholdings  increased  steadily quarter by  quarter,  despite  the\r\n\r\ndecline  of  the KLCI and the deepening economic crisis  in  the\r\n\r\nregion  and  in Malaysia. The sell-down of Malaysian shares  did\r\n\r\nnot take place in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1999/19990506/19990506-HA-0701665.gif\">chart - KLSE Composite Index and Clob Investors' Shareholdings of Malaysian Shares (Dec 96 -  Aug 98) (Cols. 1665-1666)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the recent rally in the Malaysian market, at\r\n\r\ntoday's  prices  many  Clob investors  are  sitting  on  losses.\r\n\r\nWhether  they  decide to sell, hold or buy more  shares  on  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  stock market once their trading accounts  are  opened\r\n\r\nwill depend on their assessment of the value of their shares and\r\n\r\nof the rules governing their trades.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Update on the Clob Issue</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan has asked for an update on the frozen\r\n\r\nClob  shares.

I have circulated\r\n\r\ncopies of the SES statement to Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that SES' Central Depository Pte Ltd\r\n\r\n(CDP)  signed  an  agreement in September  last  year  with  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Securities Clearing Automated Network Services Sdn Bhd\r\n\r\n(SCANS), a subsidiary of KLSE.  The agreement provided  for  the\r\n\r\nmigration  of  all  Clob  shares to  investors'  own  securities\r\n\r\naccounts  with the Malaysian Central Depository (MCD), based  on\r\n\r\nprocedures  determined and announced by the KLSE.   As  the  SES\r\n\r\nstatement explained, the SES and CDP have done what is  expected\r\n\r\nof  them  under  the Agreement.  But till today  SCANS  has  not\r\n\r\nfulfilled  its  part of the agreement, which would  enable  Clob\r\n\r\ninvestors to have their shares in their own securities  accounts\r\n\r\nand to trade their shares on the KLSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, certain \"private sector\" solutions have\r\n\r\nbeen   proposed.   One  is  by  Mr  Akbar  Khan,  a  Singaporean\r\n\r\nbusinessman  resident  in Malaysia.  He has  formed  a  company,\r\n\r\nEffective  Capital Sdn Bhd, which on 30th April 1999 offered  to\r\n\r\nbuy Clob shares from investors for cash.  The prices offered are\r\n\r\non  average 58% lower than the prices quoted on the KLSE  as  at\r\n\r\n30th April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been media reports of other possible\r\n\r\noffers,  including an offer to Clob investors  of  shares  in  a\r\n\r\nclosed-end investment fund, to be listed on the KLSE, and  which\r\n\r\nwill gradually divest the shares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SES statement yesterday gave details of its discussions\r\n\r\nwith Mr Khan on his offer. This was to inform Clob investors  of\r\n\r\nthe  background  to Mr Khan's proposal, and of SES'  discussions\r\n\r\nwith  Mr  Khan and his Singapore lawyer, Mr Sat Pal  Khattar  of\r\n\r\nKhattar Wong and Partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SES has maintained throughout that \"private sector\"\r\n\r\noffers  by  Mr Khan or any other party cannot and do not  affect\r\n\r\nCDP's Agreement with SCANS.  This is the advice of SES' lawyers,\r\n\r\nwho have also consulted Queen's Counsel on the offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  lawyers have also advised the SES that Clob investors were,\r\n\r\nand  remain, legal owners of their shares.  The Agreement signed\r\n\r\nby  SCANS recognises that Clob shares have the same legal rights\r\n\r\nas the same classes of shares listed on the KLSE, and gives full\r\n\r\neffect to these legal rights.  Indeed Clob shares have continued\r\n\r\nto receive dividends and offers for rights issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SES has therefore insisted on clear and reasonable\r\n\r\narrangements being made for Clob investors who do not accept any\r\n\r\nprivate  offers.  They should have their shares  transferred  to\r\n\r\ntheir own accounts with the MCD and be allowed to trade them  on\r\n\r\nthe KLSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Khan's offer, which is a cash offer for Malaysian\r\n\r\nsecurities, does not need to comply with regulatory requirements\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   However,  in view of  the  considerable  public\r\n\r\ninterest, the SES has pointed out where the offer documents fall\r\n\r\nshort of generally accepted international standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SES' lawyers have advised that the CDP has a duty to\r\n\r\ndisseminate  details of any offers made to Clob  investors,  and\r\n\r\nconvey  acceptances  of the offers to the  offerors.   CDP  will\r\n\r\ncarry  out this obligation to inform Clob investors and  collect\r\n\r\ntheir  responses to Mr Khan's offer.  In so doing,  neither  SES\r\n\r\nnor   CDP   will  be  sponsoring,  sanctioning  or  making   any\r\n\r\nrecommendation  to  Clob investors as to whether  to  accept  or\r\n\r\nreject the offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clob investors should carefully study the offer by Mr Khan,\r\n\r\nbefore  deciding  for themselves whether to take  it  up.   They\r\n\r\nshould consider all relevant factors, including the prices  that\r\n\r\nEffective Capital has offered for their shares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clob investors who do not wish to sell their shares on the\r\n\r\nterms  offered  by  Mr Khan, or to accept any  other  subsequent\r\n\r\noffers,  do not have to do so.  Their legal ownership  of  their\r\n\r\nClob shares is not in issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SES will continue to press the KLSE and SCANS to meet\r\n\r\ntheir obligations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder  the  migration  Agreement.  As the SES  has  stated,  the\r\n\r\nrespective  obligations of the two parties are  not  matters  of\r\n\r\nopinion, but a legal question which can be determined.  SES  has\r\n\r\nobtained  legal  advice that the agreement is a legally  binding\r\n\r\nand enforceable contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also taken up the Clob issue with the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Government at the political level.  Prime Minister Goh\r\n\r\nChok  Tong  discussed  the Clob issue  with  Prime  Minister  Dr\r\n\r\nMahathir at a bilateral meeting in Hanoi in December last  year.\r\n\r\nBoth  PM  Goh and Dr Mahathir subsequently told the  press  that\r\n\r\nClob  would be included in the package of outstanding  bilateral\r\n\r\nissues to be discussed and resolved by the two Governments.   Dr\r\n\r\nMahathir  said  at a press conference in Hanoi on 17th  December\r\n\r\n1998, and I quote: \"I thought that it is best that we resolve as\r\n\r\na package, including of course the problem of CPF and Clob.\"  Dr\r\n\r\nMahathir also said, and again I quote: \"We would rather like  to\r\n\r\nsettle the whole thing as a package so that the water supply  is\r\n\r\nlinked to the problem of the railway, CIQ, CLOB and CPF\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Malaysian Government subsequently changed its\r\n\r\nstand.   On  13th  March 1999, Reuters quoted Malaysian  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  Tun  Daim  Zainuddin saying that  discussions  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaysia on the Clob issue should be left  to  the\r\n\r\nKLSE  and  SES,  and were not part of the overall  \"package\"  of\r\n\r\nissues  to be discussed at the government level.  Reuters quoted\r\n\r\nTun  Daim: \"I've always maintained it's between KLSE and SES.  .\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, it is not part of the package; if they want to\r\n\r\ninclude  it  in  the  package, it is up  to  the  parties,  both\r\n\r\ngovernments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysian and Singaporean senior officials have met twice\r\n\r\nthis  year  on 11th March and on 21st and 22nd April to  discuss\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  package  deal.  At both meetings,  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\ndelegation asked that Clob be removed from the agenda as it  was\r\n\r\nnot a Government-to-Government issue.  Singapore's response\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  both  occasions  was that the Clob issue should  not  remain\r\n\r\noutstanding when the package is finally resolved.  This  remains\r\n\r\nSingapore's stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government and SES will make every effort to resolve\r\n\r\nthe  Clob  issue  expeditiously.  Clob investors  have  provided\r\n\r\nsupport  for  Malaysian shares over the  years,  even  when  the\r\n\r\nmarket was declining over the two years before the imposition of\r\n\r\ncapital  controls.   It is not to anyone's  advantage  for  Clob\r\n\r\ninvestors to feel that they are being treated unfairly,  or  for\r\n\r\nthe international markets to perceive so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, I have a number of\r\n\r\nsupplementary questions for the Deputy Prime Minister.  (1)  May\r\n\r\nI  ask the Deputy Prime Minister, since the statistics from Clob\r\n\r\nshow a diametrically opposite picture from that in the Malaysian\r\n\r\nWhite Paper, whether SES or even the Government would inform the\r\n\r\nMalaysian   government  of  these  statistics   through   normal\r\n\r\nchannels?  (2) May I also ask the Deputy Prime Minister  whether\r\n\r\nthe issue of frozen Clob Malaysian shares could be brought up to\r\n\r\ninternational   organisations  such   as   WTO   or   even   the\r\n\r\nInternational Court of Justice for resolution since it was clear\r\n\r\nthat  the  trading  of Malaysian shares on Clob  was  all  along\r\n\r\ncompletely legal and the freeze was because the MCD had  changed\r\n\r\nits  rules regarding nominee shareholdings on 31st August  1998,\r\n\r\ncoupled  with  SCANS  not  fulfilling its  legal  obligation  of\r\n\r\ntransferring the shares to individual accounts with MCD?  (3)  I\r\n\r\nwould  also  like  to ask him why CDP, as the  umbrella  nominee\r\n\r\nholder for Clob Malaysian shares, has not taken any legal action\r\n\r\non this issue so far?  (4) Since any private sector party is not\r\n\r\nprecluded from making an offer for Clob Malaysian shares,  could\r\n\r\nan organisation such as GIC or Temasek make an offer to purchase\r\n\r\nthe  shares at reasonable prices?  In this respect, why  is  SES\r\n\r\neven  considering the offer from an individual such as Mr  Akbar\r\n\r\nKhan?   Who  is he?  Does this mean that any future  offers  for\r\n\r\nClob  shares by any individual, regardless of the background  or\r\n\r\nstanding,  will  also  receive the same consideration  from  the\r\n\r\nStock Exchange of Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will of course\r\n\r\nextend copies of the analysis from the Business Times as well as\r\n\r\nthe  statistics I have given to Members today and the  graph  to\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian  authorities.  We hope they would be  helpful  to\r\n\r\nthem when studying the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for bringing the matter to the World Trade Organisation\r\n\r\nor  the International Court of Justice, this is not a matter  in\r\n\r\nthe  purview  of  the WTO, nor is it a treaty  between  the  two\r\n\r\ncountries, because the agreement was signed between SCANS on the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  side and CDP on the Singapore side.  But  as  I  have\r\n\r\ninformed  Members, we are taking legal advice, including  advice\r\n\r\nfrom  QC,  on our rights in this matter.  That also answers  the\r\n\r\nquestion on legal action.  We are taking advice on our rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could GIC or Temasek offer to buy? Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nthink  that  would  be  very  dangerous.   Individual  investors\r\n\r\ninvested  on  Clob  on their own.  This was  over  the  counter.\r\n\r\nThese  were not shares which were listed on the Singapore  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange.  They were shares listed elsewhere and not subject  to\r\n\r\nour   disclosure   rules  or  corporate  governance   standards.\r\n\r\nInvestors  went in hoping to make a good return.  There  was  no\r\n\r\narrangement  that  if  they made a good return,  the  Government\r\n\r\nwould  collect  a small percentage, and if they went  down,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would bear some of the loss.  So for the  Government\r\n\r\nto  go in with GIC or Temasek to offer to buy these shares  from\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,   I  think,  would  be  a  very,  very   dangerous\r\n\r\nprecedent.    The   whole  idea  that  individuals   must   take\r\n\r\nresponsibility for their investment and must consider  carefully\r\n\r\nand decide and take the rough and the smooth is there.  What the\r\n\r\nGovernment can do in this circumstance, which has arisen, is  to\r\n\r\ntake up with the Malaysian authorities to try and get the matter\r\n\r\nresolved and that, as I have explained to Members, we are in the\r\n\r\nprocess of doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the SES consider Mr Akbar Khan's offer? Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the  short answer is  that  we  have  reason  to\r\n\r\nbelieve, and we satisfied ourselves, that Mr Akbar\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nKhan   was   acting  with  the  endorsement  of  the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave  two supplementary questions for the DPM.  Firstly,  I  see\r\n\r\nthat  we cannot go to WTO.  But could we explore the possibility\r\n\r\nof  arbitration in a third country?  Secondly, would SES demand,\r\n\r\nand  I  use  the word \"demand\", MCD to comply with the agreement\r\n\r\nreached  on  18th September between SES and KLSE  SCANS  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  migration of Clob shares, especially as  the  Clob\r\n\r\nshares have been transferred to an omnibus account?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will explore all\r\n\r\npossibilities and take QC's advice as to what our rights are and\r\n\r\nhow they can be given effect.  The QC's advice is that this is a\r\n\r\nlegally binding enforceable agreement and that, in fact, we  are\r\n\r\nentitled to specific performance from the other party.   How  to\r\n\r\nget  that  done, whether arbitration or not, these  are  matters\r\n\r\nwhich I leave to the lawyers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for demanding that MCD complies, indeed that is what we\r\n\r\nhave been raising with MCD.  It is not  a matter of raising  our\r\n\r\nvoices.  It is a matter of getting rights recognised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> The graph which the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister has provided shows conclusively that there\r\n\r\nwas no dumping of Malaysian shares on Clob.  I presume it is the\r\n\r\nvolume  of  shares.  I have two questions in order to  make  the\r\n\r\npicture  complete.  The first question is the volume  of  shares\r\n\r\nthat  he has provided on this graph.  What is the percentage  of\r\n\r\nthis volume compared to the volume of those respective shares on\r\n\r\nthe  KLSE?  Is it a large volume?  Or is it a small volume?  Can\r\n\r\nsignificant movements on the Clob really affect Malaysian  stock\r\n\r\nprices that much?  The second question I have is that the  graph\r\n\r\nand the details which have been provided here show, for example,\r\n\r\nthe  increase  in  the volume of Clob shares.   What  about  the\r\n\r\nstatistics  on short selling as such?  Are there any  statistics\r\n\r\non the volume and value of short selling?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not have the\r\n\r\nfigures  on  what percentage the Clob shares accounted  for  the\r\n\r\ncorresponding  total  number of shares in  these  companies.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve it would be small, probably around a quarter.  But I  am\r\n\r\nhazarding a guess.  Most of the trading with Malaysia and KL and\r\n\r\nnearly  all  of  the institutional investors, who  are  the  big\r\n\r\nplayers, invested in KL rather than in Clob.  Clob was providing\r\n\r\na facility for Singaporean investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the volume of short selling, as I said in my reply,\r\n\r\nit  was small.  We do not have direct numbers for this.  What we\r\n\r\nhave are the figures for share buy-ins because when somebody  is\r\n\r\nshort  and  unable  to  recover his position  by  the  time  the\r\n\r\ndelivery is due, then the Exchange will go in and buy-in on  his\r\n\r\nbehalf  in order to meet his obligations.  The volume of buy-ins\r\n\r\non  Clob  has been very low and, therefore, we believe that  the\r\n\r\nvolume of shorting has been very low.  The fact is that overall,\r\n\r\nClob  shareholders have increased their total holding of shares.\r\n\r\nEach  time,  the stock market fell, they bought into  a  falling\r\n\r\nmarket.   Over two years, it shows that overall, they  were  not\r\n\r\ndumping  Malaysian  shares.  They were  investing  in  Malaysian\r\n\r\nshares and they doubled their holdings in two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> It seems that from this\r\n\r\nincident,  Singaporeans  are  being  singled  out  and   treated\r\n\r\ndifferently from other investors in other countries.

Firstly, are there any other investments other  than\r\n\r\nthe Clob shares that have been affected by the controls that the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  government has placed specifically for  Singaporeans?\r\n\r\nFor  example, I recall that we have some ringgit holdings.  What\r\n\r\nhas  happened to them?  Secondly, is there any message from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to Singaporeans regarding investing in the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nmarket  in the future?

Many Members of this House have debated extensively  on\r\n\r\nthe  Report.   I will focus my speech on the \"Opportunities  for\r\n\r\nAll\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Report on \"Opportunities for All\", it was\r\n\r\nmentioned  that  as a society Singaporeans must  give  a  second\r\n\r\nchance  to those who want to try again, and Singaporeans of  all\r\n\r\nages  will always have  opportunities to upgrade and renew their\r\n\r\nknowledge and skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC has always subscribed to this principle. Through\r\n\r\nvarious schemes, we have been encouraging our workers to upgrade\r\n\r\ntheir  skills  and  be  relevant to the workplace  and  society.\r\n\r\nExamples are the Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP), the NTUC-Education  and  Training Fund and other funding  schemes.   Many\r\n\r\nworkers  have  taken opportunities available to  them  and  have\r\n\r\nbenefited from the various schemes, getting for themselves trade\r\n\r\ncertificates that are recognised nationwide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while the NTUC, together with the Government, is\r\n\r\nstressing  the  need  to  give the lower income  Singaporeans  a\r\n\r\nsecond  chance, there are still many cases of older Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  have  been denied such chances when it comes to  a  crunch.\r\n\r\nAge  seems to be the main determining factor of entry into  many\r\n\r\ncompanies,  for  example, those from the wafer  fabrication  and\r\n\r\nsemi-conductor industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of how skilful, flexible and adaptable an\r\n\r\nelderly  Singaporean  may  be, he may  still  have  very  little\r\n\r\nopportunities   in   contributing  in  such   companies.    Many\r\n\r\nrecruiting   companies  have  specifically  asked  for   younger\r\n\r\nworkers,  even  though  there are older  workers  with  relevant\r\n\r\nskills.   As  a result, such good paying jobs go mainly  to  the\r\n\r\nyounger  job seekers.  We must not forget that our older workers\r\n\r\nare willing and ready to try again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give a scenario which is very common in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  particularly  now when restructuring  exercises  are\r\n\r\nconducted by companies adversely affected by the recent economic\r\n\r\ndownturn.   A  skilled  worker in the electronics  industry  was\r\n\r\nretrenched  at  the  age  of  45.   Probably,  he  is  the  sole\r\n\r\nbreadwinner of the family.  He has the necessary skills and even\r\n\r\nthe certificates.  However, in job fairs conducted by recruiting\r\n\r\ncompanies, he is told, although he has what it takes to fit into\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  recruiting companies, that they are  looking  for\r\n\r\nyoung  individuals who are below the age of 40.  Sad, but  true,\r\n\r\nthat  mid-career  workers  who are retrenched  are  facing  such\r\n\r\nproblems.  Does it mean that if I am a skilled worker, but  over\r\n\r\n40  years old, and retrenched, I will have to settle for a  low-paying  cleaner's job, a packer's job, something that  will  not\r\n\r\ntap into the knowledge and skills that I had acquired over my 20\r\n\r\nyears of working life?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are facing a growing pool of older workers, and we, as a\r\n\r\nnation, must not see that as a problem, but to capitalise on  it\r\n\r\nas  an  opportunity.   Such  older  workers  have  a  wealth  of\r\n\r\nknowledge  and  skills that the nation can tap  on,  instead  of\r\n\r\nfacing premature redundancy in society.  Statistics show that in\r\n\r\nthe electronics industry, 61.2% of those still looking for a job\r\n\r\nsaid that they cannot meet with the minimum age requirement  set\r\n\r\nby recruiting companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore must remain committed to developing the full\r\n\r\npotentials  of  its  citizens,  as  stated  in  the  report   on\r\n\r\n\"Opportunities for All\".  I think it is time for us  to  examine\r\n\r\nthe  next  step.   And  after realising the  potentials  of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens, through\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntraining and upgrading, how can Singapore, as a nation, make use\r\n\r\nof  these  human  resources to further push the country  another\r\n\r\nstep ahead?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, human resource personnel should not be\r\n\r\nallowed to make a mockery of our plans for life-long learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nbefore I go into the subject matter of this debate, let me  take\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity  to  give my response  on  the  issue  of  SAP\r\n\r\nschools.   This  issue  has been discussed  on  many  occasions.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the more important thing is whether or  not  we\r\n\r\ncould  have a feasible policy.  Some people suggested  that  the\r\n\r\nSAP  schools  and the other schools could become sister  schools\r\n\r\nwhere  some  common activities can be carried out.   However,  I\r\n\r\nfeel that even if it is done in this way, some people will still\r\n\r\nfeel  that  it is not enough.  In my view, a more direct  method\r\n\r\nwould  be like what Senior Minister proposed not long ago,  that\r\n\r\nis, to allow some top students from the minority groups to study\r\n\r\nin the SAP schools, that is to say, to break through the present\r\n\r\nsituation in which only Chinese students are studying in the SAP\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support such a proposal because this would eliminate some\r\n\r\nof  the  doubts  which people have on the SAP  schools.   By  so\r\n\r\ndoing,  we would allow the top students from the various  ethnic\r\n\r\ngroups  more  options to study in a number of top schools  other\r\n\r\nthan  the handful of traditional \"branded\" schools such  as  the\r\n\r\nRaffles  Institution, etc. This would not  affect  the  original\r\n\r\nmission of the SAP school.s.  It is a positive development.   It\r\n\r\nis  an  enlargement of the roles of the SAP schools.  As in  the\r\n\r\ndays  of the old Nanyang University (Nantah) which also had  the\r\n\r\nMalay  Studies Department, it did not affect the characteristics\r\n\r\nof  Nantah at that time.  So I feel SAP schools today  would  be\r\n\r\nwilling to accept this proposal and this is perhaps the time for\r\n\r\nthe minority ethnic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngroups  to indicate their willingness to participate in  such  a\r\n\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to speak on the Singapore 21 report and\r\n\r\nto  give  my personal views on it. We can be said to be  at  the\r\n\r\nthreshold of the 21st century.  As we are stepping into the 21st\r\n\r\ncentury,  this  Singapore 21 report has  highlighted  two  major\r\n\r\ndilemmas that we will be facing.  First, the dilemma inherent in\r\n\r\nour social structure and the other is the dilemma that will come\r\n\r\nwith  our  globalisation  effort to  develop  Singapore  into  a\r\n\r\ncosmopolitan  city.   However, both these dilemmas  concern  one\r\n\r\nvery  basic  question, that is, how to enhance  our  social  and\r\n\r\nnational cohesion and to reduce the centrifugal force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Prime Minister Goh mentioned the basic conflict\r\n\r\nin  our  social  structure, that is, the tension or  perhaps  we\r\n\r\ncould  say the pulling force in our multi-racial society.   This\r\n\r\nis an inherent conflict.  Secondly, while we are globalising and\r\n\r\ndeveloping  Singapore into a global city, on the  one  hand,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  encourage our people to venture overseas and,  on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, we spare no efforts to attract foreign  talents  to\r\n\r\ncome  here.   This has actually created a conflict  between  the\r\n\r\ncentrifugal  force  and centripetal force.   To  the  bona  fide\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  those who were born and bred here,  they  have  a\r\n\r\nvery  special  passion  for Singapore.  This  was  stated  in  a\r\n\r\nsentence  from  the  poem entitled Ascending the  Tower  by  the\r\n\r\nfamous      poet      of      the      Tang      Dynasty,      \"\r\n\r\n\",  Wang Chan, which translated loosely means, whether a  person\r\n\r\nis  doing well or not, he would have a special emotional feeling\r\n\r\nfor  the land on which he was born and bred.  Therefore, we  can\r\n\r\nsee that many of our Singaporeans who were posted overseas would\r\n\r\nbecome  very  homesick during the festive seasons.   They  would\r\n\r\nmiss  the  dear ones in Singapore, and also from time  to  time,\r\n\r\nthey  will  miss  the  food we have in  our  hawker  centres  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   How  do we enhance this feeling of Singaporeans  so\r\n\r\nthat  they can feel passionately about Singapore, even when they\r\n\r\nare overseas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the very naturally nurtured feelings for those\r\n\r\nwho  were  born  and  bred in Singapore, I feel  that  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant  thing is that we have to make everyone feel  that  he\r\n\r\nloves  his  country and the country loves him.  Everyone  should\r\n\r\nfeel  that  he  has a share in this country.   On  the  national\r\n\r\nlevel, we have this Home Ownership Scheme.  That is a very  good\r\n\r\nexample  of  how to make everybody feel that he has a  share  in\r\n\r\nthis  nation.  National service has also reminded every  citizen\r\n\r\nthat  he  has  a  share in this nation and that is  why  we  say\r\n\r\neveryone has a responsibility in the destiny of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to enhance our people's sense of belonging and\r\n\r\nownership, I feel that the Government should enlarge this policy\r\n\r\nto reach to the people, particularly in the business sector.  We\r\n\r\nshould  encourage  more companies to have this \"Employee  Shares\r\n\r\nOwnership\" scheme, that is to say, let the employees own  shares\r\n\r\nin  the  company  they work for.  Nowadays, some  companies  are\r\n\r\nalready  implementing this system.  Every employee, irrespective\r\n\r\nof  the position in that company, would have some shares in  the\r\n\r\ncompany.   So  they are both employees and shareholders  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany.   This  would naturally give them a stronger  sense  of\r\n\r\nbelonging  for the company.  If this company has  only  a  small\r\n\r\nminority  of senior officers owning shares in the company  while\r\n\r\nthe vast majority of the employees have none, and you want these\r\n\r\nemployees  to  develop a sense of belonging to  the  company,  I\r\n\r\nthink this would be a very difficult task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like an army going to war, and after the war, all the\r\n\r\ncredits  go  to the general, and his soldiers who  risked  their\r\n\r\nlives  fighting  in the frontline were given no  recognition  at\r\n\r\nall.   How  are  we  going  to cultivate  in  them  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nbelonging, and I am sure that the morale will be very  low  too.\r\n\r\nHowever,  to  make a person cultivate his sense of belonging  to\r\n\r\nhis  country,  I  think it concerns not only  the  materialistic\r\n\r\naspect.   Spiritual and cultural factors are equally  important.\r\n\r\nIn  this  aspect, I must emphasise the importance of a  cultural\r\n\r\nsense  of  identity.   As a multi-racial society,  we  must  pay\r\n\r\nparticular\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattention  to  the sense of cultural belonging  of  the  various\r\n\r\nraces, that is, to allow all the communities to feel comfortable\r\n\r\nin  their own cultural environment.  Just as what Prime Minister\r\n\r\nGoh  Chok Tong said in this House yesterday, Singapore is not  a\r\n\r\nnation  yet.  Therefore, we have to work harder in   forging   a\r\n\r\nnational  identity  to promote better unity  among  the  various\r\n\r\nraces  and  to establish in them a sense of loyalty towards  our\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while we are seeking a common identity, we should\r\n\r\nalso  allow  diversities to exist.  We should allow the  various\r\n\r\nraces  to preserve their own cultural traditions.  This  is,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  our  current policy.  Culture is the spiritual pillar  of\r\n\r\nthe  individuals.  That a person has a strong  passion  for  his\r\n\r\ncountry,  to  a  large extent, is due to the foundation  of  his\r\n\r\ncultural identity.  A cultural sense of belonging would  enhance\r\n\r\nhis  feelings and passion for the land on which he  lives.   Any\r\n\r\ndifferences  in the various cultures would undermine  our  unity\r\n\r\nand it is something that we could not completely eliminate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we should do is to try and forge better consensus and\r\n\r\nto have a better sense of belonging.  What I want to say is that\r\n\r\nthe  policy  which  is implemented by our Government,  that  is,\r\n\r\nobtaining  consensus while maintaining diversity, is  a  correct\r\n\r\npolicy.  When we are moving towards the 21st century, we  should\r\n\r\ntry  and strengthen this policy and not to weaken it.  It is not\r\n\r\nfeasible to try and have a homogenous society because each  race\r\n\r\nand  community  will treasure and defend its  existing  culture,\r\n\r\nhabits, traditions, customs, language and religious beliefs.  To\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  community,  which is the  majority  here,  or  the\r\n\r\nminorities such as the Malays or Indians, it is the  same.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  our Malay brothers have this saying, biar  mati  anak,\r\n\r\njangan  mati adat.  Cultural tradition is actually the  soul  of\r\n\r\nthe  tribes,  or we could call it the tribal soul.   They  value\r\n\r\nthis tribal soul more than their children. Multi-culturalism  is\r\n\r\nactually an important component part of the Singapore heartware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that in our multi-cultural social environment, this\r\n\r\nis  also  a  very  important factor to attract foreign  talents.\r\n\r\nBecause I discover that many permanent residents or new citizens\r\n\r\nfrom  other  countries  who come and settle  down  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nactually do not come directly from their native countries.  Many\r\n\r\nof  them have actually gone to countries which they believed  to\r\n\r\nbe  ideal  societies  such as the United States  of  America  or\r\n\r\nEurope.   After  staying  there for  some  time,  they  came  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  and eventually decided to settle down permanently  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.    Why?    It  is  because  of  this   multi-cultural\r\n\r\nenvironment which makes them feel very comfortable and at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some of the activities or gatherings organised by the\r\n\r\nResidents'  Committees  and  at the  new  citizens'  oath-taking\r\n\r\nceremony  organised  by  the  Immigration  Department,  I  would\r\n\r\nnormally take the opportunity to ask these new citizens why they\r\n\r\nhave decided to migrate to Singapore.  Generally, they will tell\r\n\r\nme that they perceive that in Singapore they would receive equal\r\n\r\ntreatment and equal opportunity.   Most of them are bilingual in\r\n\r\ntheir  mother  tongue as well as English.  In our multi-cultural\r\n\r\nenvironment, they feel at home and very comfortable.  It is very\r\n\r\neasy  for  them to merge into our society here.   On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand, in other countries, they may be able to earn a living, but\r\n\r\nthey  could  not help having this feeling of being  second-class\r\n\r\ncitizens.  This type of personal experience was mentioned by  Dr\r\n\r\nLee Tsao Yuan yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 3rd May 1999, there was a report by the Straits Times\r\n\r\nentitled  \"Racial Tone to US Handling of Spy  Story\".   In  this\r\n\r\narticle, it mentioned that just because of one isolated incident\r\n\r\nwhere  a  Chinese  scientist was alleged to  have  stolen  their\r\n\r\nsecret and passed it to China, now everyone in the United States\r\n\r\nis  saying that all the Asian migrants, particularly the Chinese\r\n\r\nin  the US and those who have obtained US citizenship, are spies\r\n\r\nfrom  China and their loyalty for the United States is in doubt.\r\n\r\nI believe that many foreign talents would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncome  to  Singapore  from  the United  States  or  the  European\r\n\r\ncountries not without a reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on our present policy of forging an\r\n\r\nidentity while maintaining diversity, I must reiterate that this\r\n\r\nis  a  correct  policy.   When we are moving  towards  the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury,  what  we  need  to do is to  strengthen  this  policy.\r\n\r\nHowever, we cannot deny that, as I said just now, every race and\r\n\r\nevery  nationality would have its own identity, and there  is  a\r\n\r\ncertain  conflict  between the existing \"tribal  soul\"  and  the\r\n\r\n\"national soul\" that we want to establish.  As we cannot  use  a\r\n\r\npressure cooker or a big melting pot to melt all the races  into\r\n\r\none,  the conflict between the tribal soul and the national soul\r\n\r\nwould take a long time to be amalgamated.  What we need to do is\r\n\r\nto maintain the present situation of harmonious living among our\r\n\r\nraces.    We   have   to   enhance  the  communication,   mutual\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and unity among the various races.   That  is  to\r\n\r\nsay, our present policy must be maintained and sustained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I feel that we need to have a very strong\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  maintain  such a  pluralistic  policy.   In  our\r\n\r\npresent  situation of harmonious living among the  races,  to  a\r\n\r\nlarge  extent, credit must be given to our strong Government  in\r\n\r\ngiving  equal treatment to all the various races, and to protect\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the minority groups.  In the past few decades,\r\n\r\nthe  Government has been hitting hard at the racists  and  tried\r\n\r\nits  best  to eliminate the conflicts among the races to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  centrifugal force and to enhance the centripetal  force  to\r\n\r\npromote  unity  among  the various races.   We  have  emphasised\r\n\r\nparticipation  of  all citizens.  In such a  complicated  social\r\n\r\nstructure like ours, we need to have nothing short of  a  strong\r\n\r\nGovernment.   Whether it is in the family or in  a  company,  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  have  very fair and strong parents and  management  to\r\n\r\navoid confusion.  I think it is the same for a country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we are moving into the 21st century, we need to\r\n\r\nhave  a consensus.  I believe the Singapore 21 Committee led  by\r\n\r\nRAdm Teo held various discussion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npanels  and dialogue sessions and in the process, the  consensus\r\n\r\nhas  been  forged.   This is definitely of  great  help  to  the\r\n\r\nenhancement of the Singapore heartware and definitely beneficial\r\n\r\nto our development in the next century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng (Minister without Portfolio) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister without Portfolio (Mr Lim Boon Heng):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  a  Straits Times journalist, after  hearing  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister yesterday, wrote in her column this morning: \"why\r\n\r\nthe  sobering  message?\"  She reflected not only her  views  but\r\n\r\nthose  of  some of her colleagues as well.  This, after  what  I\r\n\r\nthought  was  a  very  clear message from  the  Prime  Minister,\r\n\r\nsupplemented by personal accounts from other Members,  that  our\r\n\r\nsociety  is  one with many fault lines.  These fault  lines  are\r\n\r\nfundamentals as we continue with nation building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The journalist said that the Prime Minister did not give\r\n\r\nexamples to explain why he delivered his sobering message.  Yet,\r\n\r\nI thought he gave many, from other parts of the world, to remind\r\n\r\nus  that our fault lines can give way as disastrously.  At least\r\n\r\none  Member, Mr Zainul Abidin, gave the example of Malays in the\r\n\r\nSAF as one indicator of our fault lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is there a gap between those above 50 years of age,\r\n\r\nand  those  a  generation younger in  their  30s?   Have  we  so\r\n\r\nsucceeded  in blurring ethnic lines that the younger  generation\r\n\r\nalready  accepts race as a non-issue?  As a Backbencher  in  the\r\n\r\n80s, I attended several clan functions.  For one who is English-educated, it meant hard work preparing to speak in Mandarin, and\r\n\r\nthere was always not enough time.  There was only one Lim in the\r\n\r\nBackbench, me.  How I wished there were more, so that  the  load\r\n\r\ncould  be  shared.  At one of these functions, I said  I  wished\r\n\r\nthere were more Lims in Parliament.  I did not get to finish  my\r\n\r\nsentence to express my sentiment, because I was drowned  out  by\r\n\r\nthe  applause!  All I could do after that was to meekly say that\r\n\r\nI  wished  in future there would be more Lims.  And, again,  big\r\n\r\napplause.   So,  it  taught  me that whilst  we  have  enshrined\r\n\r\nequality of race, language\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  religion as the cornerstone of our nation, we disregard the\r\n\r\nfault lines at our peril.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, last year, as part of our May Day celebrations, we\r\n\r\nput up a live TV programme.  As we did not have the money to put\r\n\r\nup  separate programmes in the four languages, we insisted  that\r\n\r\nTCS  8 agree that we have items in English, Tamil and Malay,  in\r\n\r\naddition to Chinese.  Of course, everybody knows that TCS 8 is a\r\n\r\nChinese  channel.   We thought we were being  sensitive  to  the\r\n\r\nminority  races  in  making sure that  it  was  a  multi-lingual\r\n\r\nprogramme,  but we got a very negative reaction  from  a  Berita\r\n\r\nHarian journalist!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we need a more recent example to remind us, it is the\r\n\r\nemotion with which Members spoke in this House on the subject of\r\n\r\nSAP schools and the nurturing of a Chinese elite.  If we use the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's imagery of the four interlocking circles,  the\r\n\r\nemotions  raised  over  SAP schools pose  us  a  very  pertinent\r\n\r\nquestion: How much non-overlapping space will each circle  allow\r\n\r\nthe others?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should all be very pleased if the primordial forces the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister referred to have mutated to benign  forms,  like\r\n\r\nspent  volcanoes.   But  the  Prime Minister  reminded  us  very\r\n\r\nclearly  yesterday that dormant volcanoes can  erupt,  and  with\r\n\r\ngreat  force.   This  is why we must set realistic  expectations\r\n\r\nabout  Singapore 21.  We must start with the correct  assessment\r\n\r\nof what we are, and build from here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore 21 is about building a nation with hearts that\r\n\r\nbeat  as  one.   It means citizens feeling they belong  here  so\r\n\r\ndeeply  they  will defend it.  It is about developing  roots,  a\r\n\r\nthick  web of roots, so that the tree will stand even  when  the\r\n\r\nstorm  is fierce.  What does this mean in practical terms?   Our\r\n\r\nroots  are  our  families, our friends,  the  networks  we  form\r\n\r\nthrough  churches,  mosques or temples,  the  networks  we  form\r\n\r\nthrough  other community organisations, and the bonds we develop\r\n\r\nthrough  friendship struck in school.  It is also about  getting\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to feel they too have created a piece of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by any account, the S21 Committee has reached out to a\r\n\r\nvery large number of Singaporeans.  Yes, the Committee practised\r\n\r\n\"consultation\"  and  distilled  what  6,000  Singaporeans   have\r\n\r\ncontributed into one document.  But there will be the balance of\r\n\r\nthe  3.1 million Singaporeans, who are not among the 6,000,  who\r\n\r\nwill  feel that they have not been consulted.  Indeed, Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nreflected this the day before yesterday, when he said his  party\r\n\r\nhad no part in it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be some among the 6,000 who are left\r\n\r\ndissatisfied  because their pet ideas are not  included  in  the\r\n\r\nfinal document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be expectations of greater consultation as part\r\n\r\nof  public policy formulation.  So we have to understand what is\r\n\r\npossible,  and what is not.  Those of us who work in  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions  engage  union leaders and workers in  numerous  dialogue\r\n\r\nsessions, as many as our diaries would permit us.  Yet we cannot\r\n\r\navoid the comment from time to time from some union leaders that\r\n\r\nthere was a lack of consultation!  So let us be quite clear that\r\n\r\nconsultation does not mean every citizen is to be consulted, and\r\n\r\nthat  every  point  each citizen brings  up  will  be  included,\r\n\r\nbecause it is impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet every citizen wants to participate and feel part of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But participation does not only mean being  directly\r\n\r\nconsulted.  Participation also means doing things ourselves, for\r\n\r\nour  benefit,  and  for  society.  I  think  this  is  far  more\r\n\r\nimportant.  We have to create that sense among Singaporeans that\r\n\r\nthey  play  a  part actively in our society.   Never  mind  what\r\n\r\npriorities  Government  may have, so long  as  we  are  able  to\r\n\r\ncontribute what we think is meaningful to ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a group of Singaporeans who participate in this\r\n\r\nway,    through   community   groups   and   voluntary   welfare\r\n\r\norganisations.  They go beyond discussing issues  and  expecting\r\n\r\nGovernment to do something about it, to make things\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhappen themselves.  And they do not wait to be invited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want something done, will we shake out of our\r\n\r\ninertia,  and  do something about it?  The older  generation  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  had no choice but to do things for themselves,  be\r\n\r\nit  to  set up funds for the needy, or to build schools.   If  a\r\n\r\npoorer  educated  group of Singaporeans could do  so,  there  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely no reason why a better educated group now cannot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all depends on whether we are prepared to make the\r\n\r\neffort.   Sir,  let me cite a simple example.   You  might  even\r\n\r\nregard it as trivial.  26 of my primary one classmates meet once\r\n\r\na  year,  with our form teacher.  We are a real mixed  group  of\r\n\r\npeople  - workers, shopkeepers and one politician!  How  did  it\r\n\r\nhappen?   Was  it  started by the school principal,  or  by  the\r\n\r\nteacher?   No,  we were brought together by three close  friends\r\n\r\nfrom  the class.  They had met regularly every Sunday since they\r\n\r\nleft  school.  One day one of them thought it would  be  a  good\r\n\r\nidea to organise a class get-together.  So from the names in  an\r\n\r\nold  school magazine, they set about contacting the class.  They\r\n\r\ncalled  up people with the same name in the telephone directory,\r\n\r\nsometimes  getting scolded for their trouble!   There  are  more\r\n\r\nthan one person with the same name, and those with the name \"Lim\r\n\r\nBoon Heng\" in the directory are not mine.  The three of them did\r\n\r\nnot  wait for others to act.  They took the initiative, and even\r\n\r\nnow  each year, they organise the get-together.  So my point is,\r\n\r\nif  we feel strongly about something and are prepared to do  it,\r\n\r\nwe  can,  and we can make a difference, and we enjoy  doing  the\r\n\r\nthings that matter to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said developing roots also mean the bonds we develop\r\n\r\nthrough  school.   Here, I believe that there  are  considerable\r\n\r\nmerits  in  the old school system, when a child can  study  from\r\n\r\nprimary  one  right through to `A' levels.  I went to  one  such\r\n\r\nschool.   Twelve  years  in the same school  must  surely  allow\r\n\r\nstronger bonds to develop than a six, four or two years stay  in\r\n\r\ndifferent  schools.  And it is not just bonds of  friendship  of\r\n\r\nstudents in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame  year, but inter-generational as well.  So should we review\r\n\r\nour  systems  and do those things which would allow Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthemselves to develop such bonds?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said the sense of belonging to Singapore means doing\r\n\r\nthings ourselves.  It depends on each of us.  And there are many\r\n\r\nthings  to  do.  If anyone is looking for ideas of what  to  get\r\n\r\ninvolved in, let me point out one - the support system  for  the\r\n\r\nelderly, in view of the ageing population.  It is an area  where\r\n\r\nGovernment has not got itself too deeply involved as yet.  It is\r\n\r\nan  excellent  area to be left for those who  want  to  see  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of a civil society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already some practising the spirit of civil\r\n\r\nsociety.  They are the grassroots organisations, the unions, the\r\n\r\nco-operatives  and  the voluntary welfare organisations.   There\r\n\r\nare  many who sacrifice a lot of time to do things for the  good\r\n\r\nof others.  My definition of civil society may be different from\r\n\r\nothers.   Some  think civil society excludes government  or  the\r\n\r\nestablishment.   I  have no such qualms.  I believe  in  getting\r\n\r\nthings  done,  either by ourselves or with  Government  and  the\r\n\r\nestablishment.  If it helps to get things done by  working  with\r\n\r\nGovernment,  I see no objection to it.  The satisfaction  is  in\r\n\r\ngetting things done, not in the exclusion of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rooting Singaporeans also means getting Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nfeel  that  this is the land of opportunity.  Some  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmigrate  because there are better or more exciting opportunities\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  These are Singaporeans who apparently have the self-confidence to compete as foreign talent elsewhere.  On the other\r\n\r\nhand,  we have Singaporeans - mostly descendants of migrants  or\r\n\r\nforeign  talent  - who object to foreign talent competing  here.\r\n\r\nIf  we are to be a land of opportunity, we need the talent  mass\r\n\r\nhere  for it to happen.  So the vision of Singapore 21 means  we\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  developing  the self-confidence  to  compete  with\r\n\r\nforeign  talent on our own turf, absorbing foreign  talent,  and\r\n\r\nmoulding them into Singaporeans, and if not possible, pro-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   It  is this critical mass of  talent  that  will\r\n\r\nenlarge  that sphere of opportunity for our younger  generation.\r\n\r\nIf we are able to bring the best and brightest in the world like\r\n\r\na  magnet  here, then our own will be able to compete with  them\r\n\r\nand derive the satisfaction of competing with the best.  Just as\r\n\r\nsome  of our top talent right now feel they want to compete with\r\n\r\nthe  world's best elsewhere.  So I think it is for us  to  bring\r\n\r\ntalent here to Singapore and not to exclude them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, I think, to me, it is quite clear that\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister is right.  It will be a long road to S21, and\r\n\r\nwe  must  persevere  in  this effort,  for  our  good,  for  our\r\n\r\nchildren's good, and for our grandchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Bukit Timah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I would like to support the motion standing in the\r\n\r\nname of RAdm Teo Chee Hean and the Singapore 21 report presented\r\n\r\nby the Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned by Prime Minister Goh yesterday and many of my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  who  spoke before me, the basic  principle  of  this\r\n\r\nreport  is  how to cultivate in our people the sense of  loyalty\r\n\r\ntowards our nation.  That is on the basic foundation established\r\n\r\nby  our  first  generation of leaders in Singapore.   They  have\r\n\r\ntaken  the  decision to build up Singapore on  this  foundation.\r\n\r\nWhat  decisions will the second generation leaders and the third\r\n\r\ngeneration leaders take?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the most important reminder to us is the pledge\r\n\r\nthat  is being taken by our students every morning at the  flag-raising ceremony.  Although this pledge was worded by our  first\r\n\r\ngeneration leaders some 30 years ago, it is still relevant to us\r\n\r\nnow,  and I believe it will continue to be relevant in the  next\r\n\r\ncentury.   The  pledge  reads: \"We, the citizens  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\npledge  ourselves  as  one united people,  regardless  of  race,\r\n\r\nlanguage  or  religion, to build a democratic society  based  on\r\n\r\njustice and equality so as to achieve happiness, prosperity  and\r\n\r\nprogress for our nation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that at one political gathering, some people\r\n\r\ncommented  that  the survival of Singapore was  an  accident  in\r\n\r\nhistory.   But  if  you  look at our  nation  building  and  our\r\n\r\nsurvival,  it  can be said to be the result of a very  important\r\n\r\ndecision  taken by our leaders.  We live by this  decision.   We\r\n\r\ntreasure  this  will  to build up our nation.   It  is  not  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of just the Government but the responsibility  of\r\n\r\neverybody.  The second generation leaders and people, the  third\r\n\r\ngeneration leaders and people, do they still maintain this  will\r\n\r\nof survival?  So when we are talking about a multi-racial, multi-religious and multi-lingual society, the feasible way is  to  be\r\n\r\nlike  in the past, to exercise tolerance, mutual respect, mutual\r\n\r\nunderstanding of one another's culture, to observe the festivals\r\n\r\nand  the religious celebrations of the various races.  Just like\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Prime Minister said yesterday and what my  colleague,\r\n\r\nMinister Lim Boon Heng, and Mr Goh Choon Kang have said, we want\r\n\r\nto forge a common identity while maintaining diversity.  This is\r\n\r\nsomething  which  is  repeated  over  and  over  again  in   our\r\n\r\nParliamentary debate.  This is characteristic of Singapore.   We\r\n\r\ncan treat this as an advantage but it could also turn out to  be\r\n\r\na  disadvantage  to us.  It depends on how we want  to  continue\r\n\r\nwith our policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we have many Parliamentarians from the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth countries coming to Singapore for the CPA  meeting.\r\n\r\nI  asked them what they felt was the characteristic in Singapore\r\n\r\nthat they found to be most attractive.   Almost everyone of them\r\n\r\ntold  me  that the most attractive feature of Singapore  is  our\r\n\r\nmulti-racial society.  They were amazed that our people who  are\r\n\r\ndressed  in  the  Malay national dress, the Chinese  or  western\r\n\r\ndresses   were  happily  chatting  away  at  a  common  function\r\n\r\ntogether,  using English as the common language.   Yet,  in  the\r\n\r\nnext minute, they would turn and speak in their own languages to\r\n\r\npeople of their own community.  It is simply fantastic!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One expert who has been doing research on the history of\r\n\r\nthe various\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountries remarked that he  envied our bilingual policy.  We are\r\n\r\nan  amalgamation  of  the strong points of  the  various  races.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is one of the very few countries in the  world  where\r\n\r\nthe  people could have command of a first language and a  second\r\n\r\nlanguage  which  are of completely different backgrounds  -  our\r\n\r\nChinese,  English, Malay and Tamil.  Other people consider  this\r\n\r\nas  some  great assets to us.  Then why do we want to give  them\r\n\r\nup?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that we must learn to forge a\r\n\r\ncommon  identity  while maintaining diversity.   As  what  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Goh  has  said, we must be able to  communicate  among\r\n\r\nourselves  in English and, at the same time, allow  the  various\r\n\r\ncommunities to maintain their traditional cultures and  customs.\r\n\r\nAnd  this  is an advantage and a unique characteristic  for  our\r\n\r\nfuture  survival.  So in places where there are differences,  we\r\n\r\nshould have mutual tolerance and understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past 30 years, we have succeeded in maintaining\r\n\r\nharmony.   I  feel that in the future, we could  still  maintain\r\n\r\nthis  racial harmony.  Now we have this S21 Report.  Many people\r\n\r\nare  asking  why we need to discuss this Report.   Have  we  not\r\n\r\nlived  harmoniously all this while?  But our leaders  have  very\r\n\r\ngood  foresight.  They feel that even in this peaceful time,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to be prepared for any crisis that may come in the future.\r\n\r\nWe must learn how to overcome all the problems and challenges in\r\n\r\nour process of nation building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such major premises, I would like to deliberate on\r\n\r\nsome  details of the Report.  In the last few days, we have been\r\n\r\ndiscussing  how  to  make  everyone identify  with  the  nation.\r\n\r\nBecause of the upgrading of their educational and skills  level,\r\n\r\nand the globalisation of our economy, many people feel that they\r\n\r\nare  now  citizens  of  the whole world.   This  is  inevitable.\r\n\r\nAccording  to some preliminary survey, about 10% to 20%  of  our\r\n\r\npeople have such a feeling.  But the majority, the other 70%  to\r\n\r\n80% of our people, are busy hovering around the basic things  in\r\n\r\nlife.   They  want  to have a stable job, a  stable  society,  a\r\n\r\npleasant living environment and a house\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  flat of their own, and have no problem in their daily needs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  some people will ask: why are they not concerned  with\r\n\r\nthis  S21  Vision?   Why  are  they  not  participating  in  the\r\n\r\ndiscussion  on  this  issue?   It  is  not  that  they  are  not\r\n\r\nconcerned.   They are actually concerned with the  matter.   One\r\n\r\nelderly  person told me  that when we are on board a plane,  our\r\n\r\nlife  is  committed to the pilot.  We would not  ask  the  pilot\r\n\r\nwhether he has been adequately trained, how many hours of flying\r\n\r\ntime  he has clocked, is he experienced, or is he confident that\r\n\r\nhe  would fly us all safely to our destination.  We do not  need\r\n\r\nto  go  into  all  that.  So in our case, we  have  elected  our\r\n\r\nleaders. They are the talented people.  They have the ability to\r\n\r\nlead  us.   We  are in good hands.  It is not that  we  are  not\r\n\r\nconcerned.   But  we  feel confident, because  we  have  a  good\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have contacted the People's Association and the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education to find out what are the feelings of  our  people,\r\n\r\nthe ordinary citizens of Singapore.  Singaporeans are very busy.\r\n\r\nThey  are  busy  attending classes, training,  busy  with  their\r\n\r\nfamily  and a lot of things to do.  And the People's Association\r\n\r\nreported to me that last year, for the RCs, the CCCs, the CCMCs,\r\n\r\nie,  the grassroots organisations, the participation rate was  7\r\n\r\nmillion.   Of course, many people participated in more than  one\r\n\r\nevent.   On  the average, our Residents Committees conduct  some\r\n\r\n200  to  300 activities in a year.  The Sports Council  told  me\r\n\r\nthat  the participation rate was 1.2 million in their activities\r\n\r\nlast year. The National Arts Council said its audience was about\r\n\r\n700,000.  Besides, we have the activities organised by NTUC, the\r\n\r\nwelfare organisations and the religious organisations.  I  think\r\n\r\nwe could easily gain an entry in the Guinness World of Records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can safely say that Singapore is a nation where the\r\n\r\npeople  are  actively participating in various community  works.\r\n\r\nJust  now  Minister  Lim has also mentioned  that  participation\r\n\r\ncould  be  of different levels.  How do we make them  feel  that\r\n\r\ntheir views and ideas are being reflected?  As I said just  now,\r\n\r\nwe must recognise that there is a limitation in every country,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  our  country, taking  into  consideration  the\r\n\r\nenvironment  around us.  Under such circumstances,  we  need  to\r\n\r\nelect  some able people to lead us.  It is not possible for  the\r\n\r\npeople to be directly involved in all activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our children, irrespective of their background, are assured\r\n\r\nof  places  in the school.  Every child will have a place  in  a\r\n\r\nschool.   There is no one in Singapore who has to stop schooling\r\n\r\nbecause of financial difficulties.  I believe that our political\r\n\r\nleaders  can make such a promise. There is no one who  has  been\r\n\r\ndenied  medical  treatment  because of  financial  difficulties.\r\n\r\nThere is no one who has no place, nowhere to go to, no place  to\r\n\r\nstay  in.   I think if we conduct a thorough survey, we  can  be\r\n\r\nfound to be quite a successful nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to religion, not many countries in the world\r\n\r\ncan  have  a  Sikh temple, Chinese temples,  Catholic  churches,\r\n\r\nmosques  or  Protestant churches, all within the radius  of  one\r\n\r\nkilometre, as in our Waterloo Street area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone told me a very interesting observation. She\r\n\r\nnoticed  that a good number of believers who had gone to worship\r\n\r\nat  the  Guan  Yin  Temple at Waterloo  Street,  passed  by  the\r\n\r\nKrishnan Temple next door, and spontaneously took out some money\r\n\r\nand  dropped it into the donation box outside.  This is  a  very\r\n\r\nspecial  situation  in Singapore where our  people  respect  one\r\n\r\nanother, and respect the religions of the other races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I mentioned that in the schools, our students are\r\n\r\nactively  participating  in  all  the  activities.   How  do  we\r\n\r\nmaintain  such  a  practice?   In  a  family,  my  Parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues have already deliberated on it.  So I do not want  to\r\n\r\nwaste  time  repeating  it.  But I want to  mention  one  point.\r\n\r\nWhenever we talk about the family, foreign talents, and an aging\r\n\r\npopulation,  these are the key issues.  We are Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nif  we do not want foreign talents, how many babies have we  had\r\n\r\nin  Singapore?  In the 70s, it was about 22 to 23  per  thousand\r\n\r\nper year.  In 1997, it was about 15 per thousand per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear.    According   to  a  Japanese  report  on   International\r\n\r\nStatistics, this figure will be dropping every year.  The  birth\r\n\r\nrate may drop to 12 per thousand per year.  Can we find a way to\r\n\r\nbreak through?  We always talk about solving this problem of  an\r\n\r\naging population.  But have we given a thought to increasing our\r\n\r\nbirth  rate?  Now that most women are working, can we  encourage\r\n\r\nthem  to have more babies?  So this is one area we need to  look\r\n\r\ninto.   The  mindset of our people is such that many people  are\r\n\r\nthinking  that they are citizens of the world.  But the majority\r\n\r\nof  our people are still identified with Singapore.  Then,  when\r\n\r\nwe  have  foreign talents, how do we make them  settle  down  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and  merge into our society?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The younger generation of Singaporeans must understand\r\n\r\nthis.  We have our limitations.  We have to be sensitive of  our\r\n\r\nenvironment  and  we  are a small population.   If  we  want  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  our  position as one of the top ten countries  in  the\r\n\r\nworld in terms of economic development and standard of living, I\r\n\r\nthink  we  must  attract foreign talents and we must  feel  that\r\n\r\neveryone  of us has a share and a part and role to play  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to raise is that just now, when we\r\n\r\ntalked  about participation and we said that we are  a  closely-knit  society, one thing we can improve is that we  may  perhaps\r\n\r\nset  up  or  establish a systematic \"Emotion  Contact  Station\".\r\n\r\nWhile we are all busy, very naturally, we take our interpersonal\r\n\r\nrelationship for granted.  Many voluntary workers told  me  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  been volunteering for their whole life.  People  who\r\n\r\nhave  been donating blood for the past 20-30 years have  enjoyed\r\n\r\nsome  priority  when  they  go  for  medical  treatment  in  the\r\n\r\npolyclinics or hospitals.  When they reach the age of 60,  their\r\n\r\nblood  will not be accepted.  So at  61, they cease to be blood-donors,  and simultaneously all the special treatment previously\r\n\r\ngiven to them will be suspended.  I would like to say that  when\r\n\r\nwe  want to cultivate the spirit of care and concern, it is  not\r\n\r\nonly in the families but also in the community.  Now all the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools are built by the Government.  Our ordinary citizens  can\r\n\r\nonly   participate  in  the  school's  management   consultative\r\n\r\ncommittee.   I  think  we  should give the  parents,  and  well-wishers, more roles to play in the management of the schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a former Principal of the Chinese High School, Mr\r\n\r\nCheng  An  Lun  passed  away.  At his  funeral,  the  Old  Boys'\r\n\r\nAssociation and the School Board arranged for his hearse to pass\r\n\r\nthrough the school ground for the teachers and students  to  pay\r\n\r\ntheir  last  respects, and many people in the educational  field\r\n\r\nare  very touched by such an arrangement.  It is a very touching\r\n\r\nshow  of respect and recognition for someone who has contributed\r\n\r\nenormously in the field of education during his lifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Government has rich financial resources. We could\r\n\r\nwell  afford  to  spend some money to recognise  those  who  had\r\n\r\ncontributed  to  our society in other fields,  such  as  sports,\r\n\r\narts,   music,   education,  etc.   Together   with   the   clan\r\n\r\nassociations,  Old  Boys' Associations and the  other  community\r\n\r\norganisations,  we  can  show some form  of  respect,  care  and\r\n\r\nconcern  for former sportsmen, sportswomen, artists,  musicians,\r\n\r\netc.   Recently,  we read in the newspapers that some  sportsmen\r\n\r\nwho had in their heyday won honours for our nation, but in their\r\n\r\nold age, they lived in isolation and poverty with nobody to look\r\n\r\nafter  them.  Perhaps the Sports Council could set up some  sort\r\n\r\nof  \"Emotion Contact Station\".  In our society where everyone is\r\n\r\nvery   busy,  where  the  economy  is  prosperous,   we   should\r\n\r\nsystematically  try  to  have some sort  of  communication  with\r\n\r\npeople who have contributed to our society in the past.  We have\r\n\r\nspent  a  lot  of  time and effort to develop our  economy.   We\r\n\r\nencourage  foreign investors to invest here and to  create  jobs\r\n\r\nfor our people.  However, as we have stable and strong reserves,\r\n\r\nwe  should  seriously consider tying up our economic development\r\n\r\nwith the development of our heartbeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, we should also put some of our local artworks or\r\n\r\nlocal songs on the Internet, so as to show to the world what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have.   For  example,  it is very  difficult  to  plant  our\r\n\r\nnational  flower,  the orchid.  I have not conducted  a  survey.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  National  Parks Board may think  that  it  is  too\r\n\r\ndifficult  to have orchids planted everywhere in Singapore.   It\r\n\r\nis  very  difficult to make the orchid flower bloom,  so  it  is\r\n\r\neasier  to  have some greenery instead.  There is nothing  wrong\r\n\r\nwith  it.  But I think we should spend more effort and money  on\r\n\r\nthe  propagation of our national flower.  At least, have  it  on\r\n\r\nthe Internet.  With Singaporeans travelling to all places in the\r\n\r\nworld, a look at our national flower on the Internet, will bring\r\n\r\nback fond memories f things back home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also to cultivate our arts bodies, like the dance\r\n\r\ngroups  and the various arts groups.  We should spend more  time\r\n\r\nand  effort  to  cultivate them.  If  you  go  to  the  European\r\n\r\ncountries,  you  will see a lot of these arts festivals,  choral\r\n\r\nfestivals, dance festivals, and what have you.  When we have the\r\n\r\n\"Sing Singapore\" campaign, perhaps we could tie up with the CDC.\r\n\r\nAs  a  matter of fact, on the 5th of June, the Bukit  Timah  CDC\r\n\r\nwill  have a \"Singspiration\" involving some 10,000 people.  This\r\n\r\nmay  not have an immediate effect or attract  immediate response\r\n\r\nfrom the people.  But if we were to promote this in a systematic\r\n\r\nmanner, we could have very good results.  Recently, we have  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of NAC, that is, if we raise $5 million, the Government\r\n\r\nwould give us another $15 million to promote our arts activities\r\n\r\nand  many  of these arts groups were also very envious  of  this\r\n\r\ngrant to us.  I feel that when our economy has developed to such\r\n\r\na  level,  we should also try to promote this sort of  Singapore\r\n\r\nheartbeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Committee for the Implementation of the\r\n\r\nSingapore   21  Committee's  recommendation  would   take   into\r\n\r\nconsideration what has been  discussed in these few  days.   Our\r\n\r\nfirst generation leaders built up Singapore when we had no  army\r\n\r\nand no reserves, but we survived. Now that we have a strong army\r\n\r\nand strong reserves, we should do better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, I would like to start\r\n\r\nby  congratulating  RAdm Teo Chee Hean  and  his  team  for  the\r\n\r\nexcellent Singapore 21 report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore 21 Committee has stated quite clearly and\r\n\r\nunequivocally,  and this is fundamentally critical,  that  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  matters.  Singapore would be given up  as  lost  if\r\n\r\nthere is any Singaporean who feels that the affairs of Singapore\r\n\r\ndo not matter to him.  We are well aware that our society is the\r\n\r\nstrongest  if  every  Singaporean feels  himself  a  part.   The\r\n\r\nalienation  of  any member can only serve to weaken  the  social\r\n\r\nfabric  of our society.  Therefore, if there was previously  any\r\n\r\ndoubt,  it should be put to rest that every Singaporean  counts.\r\n\r\nIn  Singapore, there is a place for everyone, regardless of  his\r\n\r\nstation in life, race, language or religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also enlightening to know in the report that\r\n\r\n\"the  methods  of  steering cannot remain as  they  have  always\r\n\r\nbeen\".   By  making  that  point, it is  a  presumption  and  an\r\n\r\nacknowledgement  that our people will and have matured  to  take\r\n\r\nthe   right  decisions  in  the  collective  interest   of   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   But I note the caution that the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nmade  yesterday, and just now, Minister Lim Boon Heng  cautioned\r\n\r\nSingaporeans that the presumption and acknowledgement are  based\r\n\r\non  our  maturity as a people, and that we cannot expect changes\r\n\r\nto  be  made unless we are ready to make the right decisions  in\r\n\r\nthe  collective interest of all Singaporeans.  We all know  that\r\n\r\nthe  best  way to govern Singapore is to get the involvement  of\r\n\r\nall  the  people,  and  not on the few.  We  need  to  focus  on\r\n\r\npersons,  and  not  on property.  Ultimately,  the  strength  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  on the free development of public opinion,  from\r\n\r\nthe bottom-up approach, and not based on authoritarian rule from\r\n\r\nthe top.  It is demonstrating the trust and faith we have in the\r\n\r\nmaturity of our people.  It is also based on the belief  that  a\r\n\r\nstate  and  society with the means of some change  provides  the\r\n\r\nmeans of its conservation, and I think it is heartening that the\r\n\r\nSingapore  21 report is also trying to shape the change  in  the\r\n\r\nway  Government  responds  to the interests  and  needs  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before our people can become active citizens, they really\r\n\r\nneed  to possess the requisite citizenship skills.  And we  take\r\n\r\nfor granted that every Singaporean actually possesses the skills\r\n\r\nto  become active citizens.  Our citizens need to know  how  the\r\n\r\nnational   economy  works,  what  constitutes  GDP  growth   and\r\n\r\nrecession,   the  annual  Government  budget   of   income   and\r\n\r\nexpenditure.   On  issues like healthcare, the  environment  and\r\n\r\nimportant truths about public policies, safety and security, law\r\n\r\nand  justice systems, the citizens should be educated  on  these\r\n\r\nimportant  national issues through public education  programmes.\r\n\r\nEven  if  they have been taught in schools, but because  of  the\r\n\r\nchanges  made over the years, it is important that our  citizens\r\n\r\nbe updated and continually be educated on the current affairs of\r\n\r\nour  country.  Even then, as alluded earlier, a citizen will  be\r\n\r\nmaking  an important contribution when he is able to look  after\r\n\r\nhimself and his family.  The shared pursuit of happiness,  peace\r\n\r\nand prosperity gives meaning to living in a community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hope actually lies in Singapore with a growing middle\r\n\r\nclass.   A  larger  middle class should contribute  to  a  safe,\r\n\r\nsecure   and   orderly  society.   A  society  can   easily   be\r\n\r\ndestabilised  if  the  demagogues are allowed  to  play  up  the\r\n\r\nfeelings  of  the less successful, and the lower  income  groups\r\n\r\nagainst  the rich and successful through the politics  of  envy.\r\n\r\nIt  is important, as it has been our aspiration in Singapore, to\r\n\r\ngrow the middle-class in Singapore.  It is, therefore, important\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  upgrade  the talents and capabilities  of  as  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  as  possible, so that they can  benefit  from  our\r\n\r\ngrowth and prosperity and a better quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who work in the corporate world have been\r\n\r\nchallenged  to  measure  our corporate performance  through  the\r\n\r\nconcept  of  Economic  Value  Added  (EVA).   In  the  area   of\r\n\r\nGovernment, we can also measure the performance of public sector\r\n\r\nthrough, perhaps, a modified version of Social Value Added.   We\r\n\r\nneed to set stringent performance quality standards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the  public sector to deliver the public and social good  of\r\n\r\nthe  highest  value  in  the most efficient  and  cost-effective\r\n\r\nmanner.   The  civil  service has an onerous  responsibility  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  public funds are used in the  most  judicious\r\n\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to promote active citizenship participation, the\r\n\r\npublic  sector must, and can take the lead and set the  example.\r\n\r\nIt  is really the attitude and conduct in rendering services  to\r\n\r\nthe  public  that  show whether the Government,  Ministries  and\r\n\r\nagencies are taking the public seriously.  For example,  in  the\r\n\r\narea  of  healthcare, it is important that the  specialists  and\r\n\r\nsenior  consultants  continue to treat  `C'  class  patients  in\r\n\r\nrestructured and Government hospitals, showing that we care  for\r\n\r\nthe poor.  In education, improving the teacher-student ratio  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  weaker students, and the provision of  facilities  to\r\n\r\nmake   it   easier  for  disabled  students  to  attend  school,\r\n\r\ndemonstrate  our  concern  for the  weak  and  disabled  in  our\r\n\r\ncommunity.  In housing, the provision of lifts to stop at  every\r\n\r\nfloor  is  beneficial to the elderly residents.   These  efforts\r\n\r\nserve  to  inspire and motivate the public.  The  citizens  will\r\n\r\nactively  respond  to  give  useful and  constructive  feedback,\r\n\r\nbecause they have seen and heard the actions taken.  The  public\r\n\r\nfunds are not wasted but devoted to meet priority areas of  need\r\n\r\nin our community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of the PAP Town Councils has produced\r\n\r\nfavourable and beneficial outcomes.  Our HDB housing estates are\r\n\r\nbetter  maintained.   The Town Councillors who  are  drawn  from\r\n\r\namong grassroots leaders and volunteer professionals have helped\r\n\r\nto  make  judicious decisions in the use of limited Town Council\r\n\r\nfunds,  and the choices necessary in meeting the many  competing\r\n\r\nneeds  to  beautify  and improve the living environment  in  the\r\n\r\nhousing estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next important step would be to strengthen the\r\n\r\nwork  of  the Community Development Councils (CDCs).   In  fact,\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  long had the people sector and the  organisation\r\n\r\nthat   has  been  playing  that  role  is  really  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation.  The CDCs, through the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople's Association, should be seen as the body linking all the\r\n\r\ncivic groups that represent the people sector.  And I share  the\r\n\r\nsame  view  with Minister Lim Boon Heng earlier when  he  talked\r\n\r\nabout  the civil society and the groups should not work  to  the\r\n\r\nexclusion  of  the Government and the establishment.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nhere,  I would argue that it is so very important that the civic\r\n\r\ngroups work with a Government body like the People's Association\r\n\r\nto get things done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should encourage the social clubs, golf and country\r\n\r\nclubs,  arts  and  culture  groups,  interest  groups,  all  the\r\n\r\norganisations  and associations in Singapore  to  adopt  a  more\r\n\r\nproactive  approach in sponsoring and participating  in  sports,\r\n\r\nart,  culture, the environment and social services sectors.   In\r\n\r\nfact, there is already a very large sector and large groups that\r\n\r\nare  involved in many social service activities.   And  I  think\r\n\r\nwhat  is needed is to get them more organised, to get them  more\r\n\r\nnetworked, so that their resources are better used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, citizenship does not only apply to the individuals.\r\n\r\nThe  corporations  are also important, and we  should  encourage\r\n\r\nmore companies to be good corporate citizens.  Incentives should\r\n\r\nbe given to encourage them to set up charitable foundations.  In\r\n\r\ntoday's  Straits  Times  Life section, they  reported  the  many\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries  of  foundations  which  give  scholarships,   for\r\n\r\nexample,  and  the  many  courses that foundations  are  already\r\n\r\ngiving  in  Singapore.  We think there are many more foundations\r\n\r\nthat could be set up by companies and individuals.  What we need\r\n\r\nis  to  have support on a regular basis, both financial  and  in\r\n\r\nkind.   Here,  I  will  echo Mrs Yu-Foo  Yee  Shoon's  call  for\r\n\r\nGovernment to give greater incentives and support to bodies that\r\n\r\nwant  to  serve  charitable  and  public  causes.   Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Finance and the Inland Revenue Authority  could  be\r\n\r\nmore generous in this regard.  Corporations need not necessarily\r\n\r\nbe  thinking of the advertising and commercial value  in  giving\r\n\r\nsuch  charity, or at least directly.  There will  be  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ngoodwill in their work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) also need\r\n\r\nattention,   and  they  need  to  be  managed  by  professionals\r\n\r\nqualified  to  handle the issues and activities on  a  sustained\r\n\r\nbasis.   VWOs usually started out with a vision and  mission  of\r\n\r\nthe  founders  in  meeting a need in the community.   We  should\r\n\r\nencourage as many talented and bright young Singaporeans to take\r\n\r\nup career positions in the VWOs.  Unless the VWOs themselves are\r\n\r\nwell  managed,  it  would  be  difficult  for  them  to  attract\r\n\r\nvolunteers willing to devote time and energy to serve  in  these\r\n\r\nagencies.  The beneficiaries will be well taken care of if there\r\n\r\nare committed professionals and dedicated volunteers serving  in\r\n\r\nthe  VWOs.  Sir, as we hope that there will be volunteers,  VWOs\r\n\r\nshould first be professionally  and better managed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also alternative approaches in serving the needs\r\n\r\nof  the  community.  The area that has successfully  tapped  the\r\n\r\nspirit   of   volunteerism  and  self-help  is  the  cooperative\r\n\r\nmovement.   The NTUC has been highly successful in  spearheading\r\n\r\ncooperative projects in Singapore.  Perhaps other bodies  should\r\n\r\nalso  consider the cooperative approach as a way to  participate\r\n\r\nin  the  people  and  civic sector.  It was a pleasant  surprise\r\n\r\nreally  when  the  virus affected the pork  business,  the  pork\r\n\r\nmerchants  actually organised themselves as  a  cooperative,  to\r\n\r\nfind   solutions  to  their  business  problems.   And   it   is\r\n\r\ninteresting  to  see a group of merchants organising  themselves\r\n\r\nand,  of  course, we have our ex-colleague, Mr Ho Kah Leong,  as\r\n\r\nthe adviser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cooperative approach is really a formidable approach\r\n\r\nbecause  there  is a social responsibility in  its  mission  and\r\n\r\nprofit  maximisation is not its ultimate objective.  The  mutual\r\n\r\nself-help  community  approach has a  role,  even  in  a  highly\r\n\r\ncompetitive globalised trading environment.  Perhaps  an  active\r\n\r\ncooperative  movement can revive the spirit of volunteerism  and\r\n\r\nself-help as we move into the 21st century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the S21 Committee has set the direction with the\r\n\r\nvision and strategies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  hope that all Singaporeans will rally behind this vision  and\r\n\r\nmake  it  a  reality, and we, Singapore, become a  gracious  and\r\n\r\ncompassionate society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise  to  register  my  support  and  commitment  as  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean to the vision for Singapore in the 21st century.   I\r\n\r\ncongratulate Minister Teo Chee Hean for his leadership and thank\r\n\r\nthe  various  committees for the numerous hours which  they  had\r\n\r\nsacrificed to process this project of people and ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not disagree with any of the good things already\r\n\r\nsaid  of  this  Report.  I ask myself when I walk  out  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  do  I  feel a recharged energy to want to operationalise\r\n\r\nthese five ideals in my personal and corporate life?  There  are\r\n\r\n93  of  us  in this House, and therefore altogether 93 families.\r\n\r\nAssuming we have an average of four per household, then whatever\r\n\r\neach  of us has learnt in this House will impact on 372 persons.\r\n\r\nAt  the broader level, as leaders in corporations and MPs taking\r\n\r\ncharge  of thousands of Singaporeans, how do we, in our  various\r\n\r\npositions,  create the environment for these five ideals  to  be\r\n\r\ntranslated into actionable programmes and manifest measures,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they become real to our company staff and to the  man  and\r\n\r\nwoman in the street?  That is the energy I am raking and I would\r\n\r\nlike to see it being harnessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said that there will be no implementation body\r\n\r\nand he hopes that the people sector will respond and take charge\r\n\r\nwhere  it seems fit.  This seems to indicate a move from a  top-down  management  style to one that is bottom  up.   This  is  a\r\n\r\nsignificant paradigm shift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam may not agree with me, but if we, as lay\r\n\r\ncitizens,  seize  the spirit and act on it, we are  shaping  the\r\n\r\nbeginning of an open society.  It is clear that people are asked\r\n\r\nto exercise active\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizenry, not as \"armchair critics\" as what Mr David  Lim  once\r\n\r\nsaid, but as \"ready to act and willing-to-do Singaporeans\".   We\r\n\r\ndo  not  need to wait for the Government to take the  lead.   We\r\n\r\nseek  consultation and form partnerships with  Government  where\r\n\r\npossible,  but  we  can independently serve through  appropriate\r\n\r\nchannels and cease to live as consumers expecting our desires to\r\n\r\nbe always made known and to be satisfied by the authorities.   I\r\n\r\ntotally agree with Minister Lim Boon Heng just now asking us not\r\n\r\nto wait to be invited to serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, as professionals, civil servants, corporate\r\n\r\npersonnel, volunteers, advocates and lay citizens, all  roll  up\r\n\r\nour  sleeves,  wet our feet, dirty our hands, and serve  at  the\r\n\r\nfrontline  with  other Singaporeans to problem  solve  and  find\r\n\r\nsolutions together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore would make a call to all Singaporeans and\r\n\r\ncorporations,  including each of our Ministries, to  show  their\r\n\r\ncommitment  to  S21 by putting down the top five  to  10  things\r\n\r\nwhich they will do in 1999 to translate and operationalise these\r\n\r\nfive  ideals.   Minister  Tarmugi  took  the  lead  to  do  this\r\n\r\nyesterday,  and  I  thank  him for that,  and  I  hope  he  will\r\n\r\nseriously consider leading a Family 21, a proposal which I  made\r\n\r\nduring  the Budget debate and reinforced again yesterday  by  Mr\r\n\r\nSinnakaruppan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, on \"every Singaporean counts\", my company will\r\n\r\nfocus  on  human  resource development  and  examine  where  the\r\n\r\npotential  of  each  of  my staff can be enhanced.   On  \"strong\r\n\r\nfamilies\",  I  have already started flexible time for  staff  to\r\n\r\nreport  any time during 8-10 am for working mothers who need  to\r\n\r\ntake their children to school, or have other family schedules to\r\n\r\nattend  to.  Personally, I will work harder with my children  to\r\n\r\ntranslate  the  five family values created by  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development,  which I believe  form  the  pillars  of\r\n\r\nstrong families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On promoting multi-culturalism, I try to include many\r\n\r\nethnic  groups  as I can in my social and business  network,  to\r\n\r\nexpose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy  children and staff to different cultures and ways  of  life.\r\n\r\nThese are small examples and I would like to build on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that we take this Report further and invite the\r\n\r\nwhole  country  to  contribute their ideas on how  to  translate\r\n\r\nthese five ideals and share them through the Internet.  What  we\r\n\r\nget  will be an astounding range of actionable ideas, I am sure.\r\n\r\nBy engaging in this process, we are spreading the S21 energy and\r\n\r\nlet people buy into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if some of the specific recommendations made by the\r\n\r\n6,000  contributors require partnerships between Government  and\r\n\r\nthe  people, then I would like to highlight a few needs.  First,\r\n\r\nthe  need for constructive engagement.  To be true to the spirit\r\n\r\nthat  every Singaporean counts and we must work together to make\r\n\r\nthe  difference, the Government and the people sector must learn\r\n\r\nto  find  answers  to  our problems and  work  together  as  co-producers  of  community.   Indeed, not  all  civil  bodies  are\r\n\r\nunconditional  blessings to society, but we  cannot  stop  their\r\n\r\ngrowth   and  rising  expectations.   How  does  the  Government\r\n\r\nmoderate  the cacophony of voices and collectivise  the  diverse\r\n\r\nviews  into cooperation without conformity?  It is not  an  easy\r\n\r\nprocess, but it is something we have to deal with.  The  process\r\n\r\nwill  always  be untidy and a continual struggle,  like  in  all\r\n\r\naspects  of  life.  That is not what we need to  fear  about  or\r\n\r\navoid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inevitably, I think we will swing from a fear of\r\n\r\nhyperdemocracy that paralyses action due to unresolved  opinions\r\n\r\non  major  issues to a dread of hypodemocracy where people  grow\r\n\r\naccustomed  to  the \"I don't think, I don't care  and   I  won't\r\n\r\nhelp\"  attitudes.   These attitudes reflect a  dependency  ethos\r\n\r\ngrafted  in kiasu Singaporeans too used to believing  that  \"the\r\n\r\nGovernment will do it and control all anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need a breakthrough. We need to confront this\r\n\r\napathy and perceived fears.  We need to learn to engage with one\r\n\r\nanother in a constructive mode, which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincludes  sharing  information,  conducting  two-way  dialogues,\r\n\r\nenablement and access to resources.  In my own experience  as  a\r\n\r\nvolunteer advocate for the last 10 years, I will rate the  level\r\n\r\nof  \"constructive  engagement\" between the  Government  and  the\r\n\r\npeople sector at an average 5, on a scale of 10 points.  I  have\r\n\r\ngood  stories gathered from grassroots experiences.  I also have\r\n\r\nnegative ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, \"constructive engagement\" is key to active\r\n\r\ncitizenry, because when people feel engaged, they will serve and\r\n\r\nstay  active.   Being  engaged is not  merely  fund-raising  for\r\n\r\nwelfare  organisations or following what is already  decided  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government.   Engagement for many young  professionals  and\r\n\r\nexecutives means having meaningful two-way dialogues with policy\r\n\r\nmakers   to  test  new  ideas  and  offering  helpful  feedback,\r\n\r\nsometimes  criticisms  to  Government without  being  ostracised\r\n\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to truly encourage open engagement, it is helpful for\r\n\r\nthe  Government, in particular the bureaucracy, to refrain  from\r\n\r\nhurling  discouraging remarks at its critics that they \"did  not\r\n\r\nhave  the  big  picture\"  or they \"did  not  do  their  research\r\n\r\nthoroughly\" or they \"did not know enough of the legislation\"  or\r\n\r\nwere  simply \"ignorant of what went on in the field.\"   Instead,\r\n\r\nGovernment officers must check their arrogance and defensiveness\r\n\r\nand  instead  adopt  the attitude that it  is  the  job  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to  use  State  resources  and  its  administrative\r\n\r\nmachinery  to gather and share information for policy decisions.\r\n\r\nWhat  follows  is  the need to persuade the public  towards  its\r\n\r\nconvictions.  This belief in public persuasion requires a  first\r\n\r\nprinciple  belief, not to believe that \"the Government  has  all\r\n\r\nthe answers\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir, when people do put up their ideas, the\r\n\r\nGovernment will not put them down, in the spirit of S21.  People\r\n\r\ndo  not  want  to  follow   -   they  want  to  join.   Even  if\r\n\r\nGovernment's decision turned out to be the best option, and this\r\n\r\nwas  indeed often the case, the ripple effect caused  by  giving\r\n\r\npeople more time and space to reach the same conclusion on their\r\n\r\nown, is just as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant  as the goals themselves.  It makes people feel  \"they\r\n\r\ncount\", even though they do not see eye to eye on some matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the need for higher level of tolerance for\r\n\r\ndifferences.   Sir,  when two persons get  together,  there  are\r\n\r\ndifferences.   And in active citizenry, there are  going  to  be\r\n\r\nstrong and different ideas, but we must be prepared to negotiate\r\n\r\nand balance.  I was heart-warmed by the way DPM Tony Tan and  PM\r\n\r\nopenly  dealt  with their differences of opinions regarding  the\r\n\r\nscrapping  of  scholarships.  I hope to see  such  pluralism  of\r\n\r\nideas being tolerated at all levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluralism creates and generates creativity. The ability to\r\n\r\nthink  out-of-the-boxes during brainstorming  stages  in  policy\r\n\r\ndecisions  must  know no boundaries and fear.   The  authorities\r\n\r\nmust  let  go for people to respond nimbly, with competence,  to\r\n\r\nsocial problems.  Notwithstanding that national cohesion must be\r\n\r\nguided  by  an  underpinning of common values to  serve  as  our\r\n\r\ncompass  to  serve and act, it is the pluralism of thoughts  and\r\n\r\ndreams  as  well  as action models that will generate  the  much\r\n\r\nsought  after  creativity in our search for fresh approaches  to\r\n\r\nproblem-solving.  It takes time for us to find a  balance.   But\r\n\r\nit  first  takes big hearts and strong minds to accept  feedback\r\n\r\nand suggestions, including criticisms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, is the need for sustained commitment to service. I\r\n\r\nurge  the  civil  bodies not to believe at the  onset  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is insincere about civic involvement.  It is as  much\r\n\r\nour  duty to engage attention of policy makers by seeking shared\r\n\r\nperspectives  without assuming that \"people are  always  right\".\r\n\r\nMuch  too often we exaggerate our differences and fail  to  work\r\n\r\nhard  at developing our overlapping interests.  We need to  stop\r\n\r\ncriticising a half glass of water as half empty, instead  accept\r\n\r\nthat it is half full and we want to fill it up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to identify people processors for creating\r\n\r\nsuccessful links between\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnetworks,   whether   top-down  or  lateral   ones.    Sustained\r\n\r\nengagement  across  sectors  and within  sectors,  even  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore context of managed activism, requires strong minds and\r\n\r\na positive spirit all round to believe that service to community\r\n\r\nis   about   comprehending  the  problem,   deliberating   tough\r\n\r\ndecisions,   setting  realistic  goals,  following  through   by\r\n\r\nlearning to work together and adopting a high level of give-and-take  attitude.  These are human resource matters  that  require\r\n\r\nfocus and strengthening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, to create what I would call a \"Singapore\r\n\r\nConnected\",   or  precisely  a  human  website.   I   urge   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to make visits to their neighbourhood voluntary and\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations to see how they can add value  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   So  much has been done by our MPs  in  facilitating\r\n\r\nvolunteer  involvement and improving the lives of  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nA  lot  more  can be done with the help of everybody.   I  fully\r\n\r\nsupport  what MP Mrs Lim Hwee Hua said in the recent publication\r\n\r\nof  CONTACT - that \"Neighbourhood Committees can be an important\r\n\r\nlink  among residents and community leaders . the residents know\r\n\r\ntheir  own and mutual needs best.  The old kampong spirit  is  a\r\n\r\nstrong  underpinning and helps define the larger  family  beyond\r\n\r\nour family members.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to use five Chinese words\r\n\r\nstrung  up in one meaning to sum up my commitment to the  vision\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  21.   It  is \"wo men de guo jia\",  translated  in\r\n\r\nEnglish  to  mean  \"our  country\".  Idiomatically,  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nphrase  \"wo  men  de  guo jia\" encapsulates several  components,\r\n\r\nincluding \"wo\" the self; \"wo men\" the collective \"We\"; \"jia\" the\r\n\r\nfamily;  and \"guo jia\" the country.  You have to get  all  these\r\n\r\ncomponents in to make sense of the words \"our country\" - \"wo men\r\n\r\nde  guo  jia\".  The link word between people and country is  the\r\n\r\ncentre  word  \"de\" which means \"ownership\".  Like DPM  Tony  Tan\r\n\r\nsaid  not  long  ago, what you do not defend, you  do  not  own.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to call Singapore a country of our choice, we need to\r\n\r\nnurture  the individuals and strengthen the families so that  as\r\n\r\nstakeholders  of this country, they will bond and band  together\r\n\r\nto safeguard its future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no \"Me\" if there is no family, and if there are no\r\n\r\nfamilies,   there  is  no  country.   In  Chinese  we   say,   (\r\n\r\n)   \"mei  you  jia na hui you wo\", \"mei you jia na hui  you  guo\r\n\r\njia\".   It  is  these  linkages from  the  self  to  family  and\r\n\r\nextending  it to society and the nation that shape the heartbeat\r\n\r\nand robust health of Singapore.  I travel a lot, Sir, and I only\r\n\r\ntravel on SIA, because after a few days in foreign land, as soon\r\n\r\nas  I  get  into an SIA plane, I immediately feel \"at home\".   I\r\n\r\nneed  a  \"Singapore  touch\", the batik  clothes,  and  even  the\r\n\r\n\"Singapore Smile\".  When the SIA aircraft landed on home ground,\r\n\r\nI  felt  the  \"warmth and safety\" of home.  These  are  precious\r\n\r\nfeelings that this little piece of land gives me and my  family;\r\n\r\nnowhere  else  do I feel this way.  And I realise we  must  work\r\n\r\nhard to prevent it from being torn apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister is so right that we still have a lot to\r\n\r\ndo.    Let  us  go  forward,  irrespective  of  race,  language,\r\n\r\nreligion,  gender  and  age, in a pathfinding  process,  through\r\n\r\nadventure   and  mutual  strengthening,  become   S21   citizens\r\n\r\npulsating in one strong and dynamic heartbeat, and develop  from\r\n\r\ncountry to nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Harun bin A. Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  allow  me to join in the debate in respect of  the  motion\r\n\r\nmoved by the Minister for Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not easy to embark on the task of\r\n\r\nmobilising  the  forces of our multi-racial, multi-cultural  and\r\n\r\nmulti-religious Singapore society to give feedback,  suggestions\r\n\r\nand  inputs  which could become the platform for  the  lives  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans in the years ahead, namely, Vision 21.  It is  even\r\n\r\nmore  so  after  having  dialogues  and  interviews  with  6,000\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   to  follow  up  on  their  ideas  and   opinions.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  wish  to place on record my  congratulations  and\r\n\r\nthanks  to  the  S21  Committee for  their  unyielding  efforts,\r\n\r\nchaired  by RAdm Teo and his Committee members.  I am  sure  the\r\n\r\nfindings and proposals of the Committee will be well received by\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore and, hopefully, translated into  action\r\n\r\nfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, active citizens will determine the\r\n\r\nheartbeat of our society.  In order to achieve this, we need  to\r\n\r\ngive full support and overcome any impediments that could affect\r\n\r\nthe   active  participation  of  the  people.   For  the  Malays\r\n\r\nparticularly,  I  wish to quote from the speech  of  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  and Minister for Defence, Dr Tony  Tan,  as  it\r\n\r\nappeared in the Berita Harian issue of 28th February 1999:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is not reasonable for employers not to employ persons\r\n\r\nof  suitable  skills  and talent simply  because  they  are  not\r\n\r\nChinese or for the SAF not to appoint or award promotion on  the\r\n\r\ngrounds solely of being Malays.  It is stupid on our part to  do\r\n\r\nsuch things.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, on 11th March 1999 in Berita Harian, Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and Minister for Defence, Dr Tony Tan further said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"There are many Malay commanders, officers, warrant\r\n\r\nofficers  and specialists in the SAF.  They serve  in  the  same\r\n\r\nfield  as  their  non-Malay counterparts and others.   When  the\r\n\r\nMalays  continue to climb up the education ladder, they will  be\r\n\r\nqualified to fill more and even higher posts in the SAF.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on 1st April 1999, Berita Harian made a report from\r\n\r\nJakarta  concerning  remarks made  by  the  Singapore  Chief  of\r\n\r\nDefence Force, Lieutenant-General Bey Soo Khiang:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In fact, President Habibie has received the wrong\r\n\r\ninformation.   We  practise a system of  meritocracy.   All  SAF\r\n\r\nstaff  are  accorded equal treatment on the basis  of  equality,\r\n\r\nregardless  of race.  In fact, there are many Malay officers  in\r\n\r\nthe  SAF  and  they  have  made contributions  towards  national\r\n\r\ndefence like other races.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am deeply touched because I was greatly elated after\r\n\r\nreading  the  speeches which I quoted above.  Why?  Because  all\r\n\r\nthis  while,  the topic of Malays in the Singapore Armed  Forces\r\n\r\nhas  been a very sensitive issue, a grey area which is difficult\r\n\r\nto  put  light in the open, not only by the Singapore community,\r\n\r\nbut  even  myself; perhaps also my MP colleagues.  Such concerns\r\n\r\nand  sensitivities from these speeches, I think, will be a  sort\r\n\r\nof  encouragement  and  stimulant  which  will  spur  the  Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity  to  attain greater heights and work together  in  the\r\n\r\nnational arena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scepticism and misgivings, which have abated confidence on\r\n\r\nmeritocracy, are obvious.  New horizon has arisen and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeritocracy is no longer an instrument to avert misunderstanding\r\n\r\nbut  it has been shown to be exercised fully.  So I am sure  the\r\n\r\nMalay  community, which has always been loyal  to  this  beloved\r\n\r\ncountry,  will  bury any feeling of suspicion and  apprehension.\r\n\r\nWe  must  put  our  shoulders to the wheel in order  to  acquire\r\n\r\nknowledge.  Speeches made by our leaders should be used  by  the\r\n\r\nMalay  community as a yardstick to build a more  meaningful  and\r\n\r\nexcellent  life,  especially  with  regard  to  the  issues   of\r\n\r\nretraining,   the   knowledge  based  economy  (KBE),   lifelong\r\n\r\neducation and others which will enhance the credibility  of  the\r\n\r\nMalay society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch upon the dearth of\r\n\r\nMalays participating in grassroots activities.  For example,  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  of participation ratio, I think less than 6%  Malays\r\n\r\ntake  an active part in grassroots activities.  Now that we have\r\n\r\nVision  S21,  I hope more Malays will participate in  grassroots\r\n\r\nactivities  because the People's Association has identified  and\r\n\r\nanalysed the reasons for the inadequate participation of  Malays\r\n\r\nin  grassroots  activities, such as problems  of  prayer  times,\r\n\r\nhalal food issues and the frequent dinners and festivities which\r\n\r\nthey have to pay for to attend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that the obstacles which I have mentioned above\r\n\r\nhave  been  addressed  by  the People's  Association  and  local\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations by providing halal  food  and  holding\r\n\r\nmeetings  after 7.30 pm, after prayer times.  When Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nincluding  the Malays, work together as a nation, more  benefits\r\n\r\nwill be garnered.  Otherwise, the ingredients are incomplete and\r\n\r\nthe  end result is simply not delicious.  I therefore feel  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no reason for the Malay community not to be  able  to\r\n\r\nwork hand-in-hand and to participate in national activities such\r\n\r\nas  in the Residents' Committees, Community Development Councils\r\n\r\nand others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, with more active participation of Malays in\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations, many local and national issues can be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomprehended  and  adopted  resulting in  stronger  inter-racial\r\n\r\nrelationship.   Besides, more feedback will be  made  available.\r\n\r\nThus, a part of S21 Vision would have been fulfilled and a  more\r\n\r\nharmonious living is bonded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very much impressed and it is\r\n\r\ntherefore  incensed in my heart by the speech made yesterday  by\r\n\r\nPM  Goh  Chok Tong in this House.  He spoke at length concerning\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  nation.  He said that Singapore  is  not  yet  a\r\n\r\nnation  and he foresees the possibility that something  untoward\r\n\r\nmight  happen  if  we are not on our guard and prioritising  our\r\n\r\ncountry  and society above our own self-interests. I  feel  that\r\n\r\nthe  sense of belonging of Singaporeans has existed and has been\r\n\r\nproven  by  the  fact that Singapore has participated  in  every\r\n\r\nfield  of activities.  The sense of pride of being a Singaporean\r\n\r\nis  more  evident when they are abroad.  I believe that if  this\r\n\r\nspirit  is  nurtured  and inculcated, the  hopes  of  our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister will certainly be realised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I feel that whilst the national leaders practise\r\n\r\nthe policy of working hand-in-hand, we should be on the look-out\r\n\r\nand  ensure that those entrusted with this policy work together.\r\n\r\nI  fear  there may be some of them who are in disagreement  with\r\n\r\neach  other.   In this event, certain sectors of the  population\r\n\r\nwill  point  a  finger at the Government whereas, in  fact,  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of the Government is correct and is made in the interest\r\n\r\nof  the  people.   When this eventually happens, the  scepticism\r\n\r\ntowards  the word \"trust\" will emerge and will become a question\r\n\r\nmark without a full stop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge that Singaporeans use and exercise the word \"trust\"\r\n\r\nas  a  panacea, which can cure all ailments, great or small,  in\r\n\r\nour  multi-racial,  multi-lingual and  multi-religious  society.\r\n\r\nHopefully,  the  hopes  of our Prime Minister  and  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nalike  will  be  realised  when  we  continue  to  practise  our\r\n\r\nfundamentals  of  life.  As the Malay saying  goes,  \"Living  by\r\n\r\nmutual help which will help to stabilise our stance to create  a\r\n\r\none nation and people of Singapore \".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majulah Singapura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Firstly,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to congratulate Minister Teo and his team for a  very\r\n\r\ngood  report which contains simple yet meaningful messages which\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans can relate to.  It is extremely  difficult  to\r\n\r\ncrystallize abstract ideas into simple messages, and I think the\r\n\r\ncommittee has done an excellent job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a country with very little resource, and the\r\n\r\nmain resource we have is manpower, and hence people are its most\r\n\r\nimportant   asset.   For  Singapore's  future  to   be   bright,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans must take an active interest in Singapore's future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember why I first got involved in politics in the mid-80s. I have always believed that Singaporeans must take an\r\n\r\nactive  interest in Singapore if Singapore was to have a future.\r\n\r\nAt  that  time in the 80s, I have felt that many in the  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration had a different viewpoint from the views espoused  by\r\n\r\nGovernment.   I  had two choices.  I could have either  been  an\r\n\r\narmchair  critic  or  joined the party to make  different  views\r\n\r\nknown.  I chose the latter.  While in politics, I was not a  yes\r\n\r\nman,  but  more  often  than not, I was  willing  to  express  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  view  whenever I thought that the  different  view  I\r\n\r\nexpressed was a viable alternative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a firm believer of active citizenship where every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  is  encouraged to take an  active  role  in  making\r\n\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  better place to live in.  However, the reality is that it  is\r\n\r\ntougher  than what it seems.  I remember that when I was working\r\n\r\nin   a  Government-related  institution,  it  was  amazing  that\r\n\r\nsometimes,  senior officers act contrary to what the  Government\r\n\r\npreaches.   The  policies formulated within the institution  ran\r\n\r\nagainst the grain of the principles that we have been taught  to\r\n\r\nbelieve in.  If you had a valid point that they could not rebut,\r\n\r\nthey  will use a different approach; they will send your  report\r\n\r\nto  a  committee which will just sit on your report and not make\r\n\r\nany  decisions  on  it.  If I, as a Member of Parliament,  could\r\n\r\nfeel  the frustration of being an active citizen, what more  the\r\n\r\nman-in-the-street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making active citizenship a reality requires a major change\r\n\r\nin  the  mindset.  The first thing to do is to  have  an  active\r\n\r\nresponse  to opinion.  The public sector must take the  lead  in\r\n\r\npromoting active citizenship as invariably all Singaporeans will\r\n\r\ncome into contact with Government agencies.  And where should we\r\n\r\nbegin?  I  think  this House should lead by  example.   If  good\r\n\r\nsuggestions are thrown up, let Ministries be bold enough to  say\r\n\r\nyes.   It is often easier to say no than to say yes.  Sometimes,\r\n\r\nthe  reply is no, but the suggestion resurfaces later as  a  new\r\n\r\npolicy  of the Ministry.  I am glad that the Singapore 21 report\r\n\r\nstates  that  a  difference  of  views  should  be  seen  as  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to benefit from the diversity of ideas,  and  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  no loss of face if good ideas come from the  people.\r\n\r\nThis  active response to opinion must filter down to the  public\r\n\r\nsector.  We  must  go beyond the service quality  committees  to\r\n\r\npeople  sector  committees, comprising  of  individuals  in  the\r\n\r\npublic, private and people sectors, whose role is to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  public sector is promoting active citizenship in a positive\r\n\r\nmanner.   I believe that the task ahead is a gargantuan one  and\r\n\r\nchanging this mindset will require tremendous political will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating an active citizenship culture goes beyond just\r\n\r\ncreating  an active response to opinion.  We have to start  from\r\n\r\nthe very young, right from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkindergartens,  the schools and the universities.   We  have  to\r\n\r\nchange  the  entire mindset.  I remember that in  my  days,  the\r\n\r\nteacher  was always right, and teachers did not take too  kindly\r\n\r\nto  students who pointed out their mistakes or took a  different\r\n\r\nview.   The  educational  institutions  must  create  the  right\r\n\r\nenvironment  for our young to be active citizens.   Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmust  learn that the future of Singapore lies in the citizenship\r\n\r\nthat  is able to look beyond the individual and the family.   We\r\n\r\nmust  build  a  citizenship that is able to  contribute  to  the\r\n\r\nnation  and believe that their future is invariably tied to  the\r\n\r\nfuture of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in promoting active citizenship, we must not\r\n\r\nforget  that  access  is  also  important.   People  wishing  to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in giving feedback or being involved  in  community\r\n\r\nprojects  must  be  able to find access easily.   Although  many\r\n\r\nMinistries  or  organisations have tended to  promote  high-tech\r\n\r\naccess via the Internet, we must not forget that there are  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  are not Internet savvy.  A  simple  toll-free\r\n\r\nphone  line will probably be an easier alternative.  If we  want\r\n\r\nto  promote  and make active citizenship a reality,  it  has  to\r\n\r\nstart  from the two key sectors that have a major impact on  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  all Singapore families. Firstly,  the  public\r\n\r\nsector,  which every Singaporean will have to come into  contact\r\n\r\nwith,  and secondly, educational institutions which will nurture\r\n\r\nour young and mould their minds.  If we can succeed in these two\r\n\r\nareas,  we  will have planted the seeds for active  citizenship.\r\n\r\nMay it one day grow like a mighty oak and spread its branches so\r\n\r\nthat  it  will  touch the hearts and minds of all  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nThe day this happens, I think we will have succeeded in creating\r\n\r\na Singapore tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> As I read\r\n\r\nthe S21 report, amidst the background of a very troubled region,\r\n\r\nI  immediately became aware of the very key lesson contained  in\r\n\r\nthe  report, that is, about the need to accommodate change.  One\r\n\r\nof the reasons for the political problems in the region, I feel,\r\n\r\nis the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninability  of  Government  to deal  with  inevitable  forces  of\r\n\r\nchanges, both within the Government and within the society  that\r\n\r\nthey   govern.    As  a  result,  the  process  of   change   is\r\n\r\nunnecessarily   accompanied  by  chaos,  anger,   violence   and\r\n\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, S21 is about accommodating change. Some of the\r\n\r\nideas  and  concepts  contained in  the  report  indeed  require\r\n\r\naccommodating  a very revolutionary change in mindset.   If  you\r\n\r\nmeasure  the  S21  report against past  trends,  it  may  appear\r\n\r\nrevolutionary  because the ideas may be a  very  vast  departure\r\n\r\nfrom  past and present mindsets.  If you measure the S21  report\r\n\r\nagainst  the expectations that accompanied it, it can  be  quite\r\n\r\npessimistic  because  of the sheer overwhelming  task  ahead  to\r\n\r\nachieve  this  vision,  and  because  of  the  many  conflicting\r\n\r\ndilemmas and issues that we must hurdle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But herein lies the real value of this report; one that\r\n\r\nrecognises  and  accommodates the diversity of views;  one  that\r\n\r\nprovides  for opportunities for all Singaporeans to participate;\r\n\r\none that allows us to deal with the very uncomfortable conflicts\r\n\r\nand dilemmas as we go through a peaceful evolutionary process of\r\n\r\nchange through consensus and collective effort.  Whether  it  is\r\n\r\nforeign talent, SAP schools, multi-culturalism, Malays in SAF or\r\n\r\nSimei  Briskwalkers,  the important thing is  that  there  exist\r\n\r\navenues for discussions, debate and a fruitful engagement.   But\r\n\r\nwe  must be aware of the responsibility that accompanied it, and\r\n\r\nthat  the evolutionary process cannot be compromised and allowed\r\n\r\nto tear our society apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam is here today, because\r\n\r\nyesterday,  he  said he cannot recall any public  discussion  on\r\n\r\nS21.  Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam may wish to know the feedback group of\r\n\r\nwhich  I  chaired,  the  mass media group,  devoted  its  entire\r\n\r\nactivities  last year on S21.  In fact, I recall a  report  from\r\n\r\nthe  Feedback  Unit's annual conference papers  last  year,  and\r\n\r\namongst  other  suggestions, it called for the increase  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  NCMPs  so  that  Opposition  Members  in  Parliament\r\n\r\nconstitute  at  least 10% of the Members of Parliament  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also remember that when these suggestions were brought\r\n\r\nforward,  there  were many who had reservations  and  hesitation\r\n\r\nabout  putting  their names to these suggestions,  because  they\r\n\r\nfeared about making such revolutionary proposals.  But I assured\r\n\r\nthem that a genuine and sincere feedback is indeed welcomed,  as\r\n\r\nindeed  is  the purpose of S21.  It may be a very new experience\r\n\r\nfor  these people, but I am sure they, like the 6,000 others who\r\n\r\nwere  involved  in  the process, have experienced  not  only  an\r\n\r\nincrease   in   the   avenues  and  channels  for   constructive\r\n\r\nconsultation  and  feedback, but also in participating  in  what\r\n\r\nmany see as a new arena in public discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the moment, only those with exceptional high-level of\r\n\r\nseriousness  and  commitment are likely  to  enter  this  arena,\r\n\r\nbecause   of   their  perception  of  OB  markers,   their   own\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of  defamation laws,  and  issues  of  political\r\n\r\ndiscussion  and  discourse.  But seen from this point,  one  can\r\n\r\nappreciate   that  the  experience  has  indeed  been   a   very\r\n\r\nsignificant milestone in the feedback and consultation  process.\r\n\r\nTo   me,  the  S21  consultation  process,  in  its  spirit  and\r\n\r\ncharacter, will hopefully set the tone, pace and style of public\r\n\r\ndiscussion in Singapore in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, S21 to me is also about changing mindset. I\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly welcome the call by the Minister for more  active\r\n\r\ncitizenship  and for greater involvement of civil  societies  at\r\n\r\nthe  grassroots level.  But for this to happen, we need a change\r\n\r\nin  mindset.   Civil societies should seize this opportunity  to\r\n\r\nbecome more engaged at the neighbourhood level.  But a change in\r\n\r\nmindset on the part of the Government and civil service is  also\r\n\r\nneeded.  I venture to suggest that we turn the community centres\r\n\r\nto  be centres for civil societies outside the management of the\r\n\r\nPeople's   Association.   Very  much  like  the  town  councils,\r\n\r\nprivatising  its  operations to private managing  agents,  civil\r\n\r\nsocieties can and should take the lead to provide a whole  range\r\n\r\nof programmes and services to help the community.  The community\r\n\r\ncentres can become a virtual office, a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhome  for  all  civil  societies  at  the  neighbourhood,  civil\r\n\r\nsocieties working in tandem with the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we also need a change in mindset on the way Government\r\n\r\ncommunicates with its constituents.  A Western diplomat, whom  I\r\n\r\nhad   lunch   with  yesterday,  on  learning  about  the   daily\r\n\r\nproceedings  of  a  Member of Parliament in Singapore,  remarked\r\n\r\nthat  the  Members of Parliament in Singapore indeed  work  very\r\n\r\nhard,  and  is worth every penny that they are paid.   And  this\r\n\r\ndrew  a  response from another Roundtable colleague of mine  who\r\n\r\nsaid  that democracy is calculated or measured by the number  of\r\n\r\ncontacts  that  Members  of  Parliament  here  have  with  their\r\n\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore could indeed be the most democratic nation in the\r\n\r\nworld.  However, my sense is that, even this, we need to have  a\r\n\r\nchange   of  mindset.   Many  Singaporeans  want  to  go  beyond\r\n\r\nfeedback,  beyond  submitting  survey  forms,  beyond   dropping\r\n\r\nsuggestions  at  suggestion boxes at  Ministries  and  statutory\r\n\r\nboards.  The meet-the-people session is perceived by some to  be\r\n\r\na  place  that  you  go to when you have a  problem.   But  most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans do not have a problem that they need to go  to  the\r\n\r\nMPs.   They  want to talk, discuss, listen and engage their  MPs\r\n\r\nand    Ministers   beyond   press   statements   and    official\r\n\r\nannouncements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told by a friend recently that he finds it very\r\n\r\nrefreshing  to hear, while he is driving to work, Mr David  Lim,\r\n\r\nMr Lim Swee Say and Mr Inderjit Singh on Radio Chat Show.  It is\r\n\r\nsuch  a thrill for Singaporeans to now realise that at the press\r\n\r\nof  a  button, while driving to work, they can have a chat  with\r\n\r\ntheir  Ministers on the radio.  And the value is not so much  of\r\n\r\nthose  participating in these chat shows, but the  demonstration\r\n\r\nof  the accessibility, the spontaneity and the human touch  that\r\n\r\nthis  new  communication provides.  Again, I venture to  suggest\r\n\r\nthat Ministries and statutory boards tap on this new opportunity\r\n\r\nin  media  communication with the public.   Press  officers,  as\r\n\r\nofficial  spokesmen,  are  not merely messengers  of  Government\r\n\r\nannouncements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But really the biggest enemy, to me, in changing our\r\n\r\nmindsets  is  in ourselves, when we measure others  by  our  own\r\n\r\nstandards, especially when they fall far short of our own ideals\r\n\r\nand  values,  As a Board member of the Singapore Cooperative  of\r\n\r\nRehabilitative  Enterprises (SCORE), it frustrates  me  to  face\r\n\r\nwalls  after  walls of obstacles when trying to  find  jobs  for\r\n\r\nrehabilitated  drug offenders.  Many would  not   even  want  to\r\n\r\nconsider them as cooks or other manual labour.  Yet, I  find  it\r\n\r\nvery  paradoxical that a security guard who looks after millions\r\n\r\nof  dollars  of  inventories are seldom  scrutinised  for  their\r\n\r\nbackground.  Even the stringent background checks carried out by\r\n\r\nstatutory boards, Ministries and the civil service may sometimes\r\n\r\nact  as  a  barrier to do mundane jobs and those which  are  not\r\n\r\nexposed to security threats.  We must change this mindset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask every Singaporean to find a place in Singapore 21\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  the  collective response of society  that  will\r\n\r\ndetermine  the  progress that we will make out of  this  Report.\r\n\r\nBeing   active  citizens  need  not  necessarily  being   active\r\n\r\ncommittee  members  of social organisations,  although  this  is\r\n\r\ncertainly preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that I wish to change mindsets as far as\r\n\r\ncivil  society is concerned is also the fact that sometimes  the\r\n\r\ncivil  society is preoccupied with the notion that  to  maintain\r\n\r\nindependence,  they  need  to operate  outside  and  apart  from\r\n\r\nGovernment.   I  think  civil societies  need  to  change  that,\r\n\r\nbecause what is important is not so much to be operating outside\r\n\r\nGovernment  but to really give value to the people who  rely  on\r\n\r\nthe  services.  And this is where I call on civil  societies  to\r\n\r\nreally  take  a  look  at  their  mode  of  operation  and  tell\r\n\r\nthemselves  that  our independence and our  conviction  and  our\r\n\r\nideals  for  civil society rest very much on our conscience  and\r\n\r\nour  belief  in the cause that we do.  Never mind the perception\r\n\r\nthat working with Government may sometimes make people feel that\r\n\r\nwe are being co-opted into Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, to me, S21 is about being Singaporean. It is not\r\n\r\njust about, like I said, being active members of committees, but\r\n\r\nwe  can  also be good citizens of Singapore just by  being  good\r\n\r\nneighbours,  being a helpful colleague and being  a  responsible\r\n\r\ncorporate  citizen, being a decent person, being a  Singaporean,\r\n\r\nany  Singaporean, so long as you are not indifferent or so  long\r\n\r\nas you are not disinterested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the motion, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport  the motion on Singapore 21.  No one in his  right  mind\r\n\r\nwould  oppose  S21.  No one would want to oppose the  clear-cut,\r\n\r\nwholesome,  motherhood  statements.  To  oppose  would  be  like\r\n\r\nturning against what is good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it need not necessarily mean that motherhood\r\n\r\nstatements  could  not be the powerhouse of ideas  nor  that  it\r\n\r\ncould not be the mother of all visions.  It can be all that  and\r\n\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pertinent question is: does it mean that it is widely\r\n\r\naccepted   on  the  ground  and  permeates  through  Singaporean\r\n\r\nsociety?  Honestly, not.  Not being opposed is one thing.  It is\r\n\r\nanother  to  be rooted and anchored in the hearts and  minds  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, in the souls of all Singaporeans.  Sir, it is  yet\r\n\r\nto  be etched and ingrained in the collective will and psyche of\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked some grassroots leaders and residents about S21.\r\n\r\nIt  is  of not much interest to them.  Some have not heard about\r\n\r\nit.   In  the kopi tiam, they are not bothered, honestly.   They\r\n\r\nsay,  boh  chap.   It is not a bread and butter issue  to  them.\r\n\r\nThey  are all too busy making a living for themselves.    Others\r\n\r\ncould not understand.  It is too chim, too deep for them.   Liak\r\n\r\nboh  kew,  they  say.   It  is too abstract,  philosophical  and\r\n\r\nperplexing.  They are indeed put on the horns of dilemmas,  when\r\n\r\nwe  talk  about the five dilemmas.  One told me that it is  like\r\n\r\nthe literati talking to the literati, and it is of no concern to\r\n\r\nthe  ordinary   folks in the street.  This may not,  of  course,\r\n\r\nreflect everything and not an entirely accurate summary, but  it\r\n\r\nis a perception on the ground.  Some say,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplease, talk as much as you want on S21, but remember do not  be\r\n\r\nlike  NATO   -   No  Action  Talk  Only.   What  they  are  more\r\n\r\ninterested in is what happens after this.  Sir, may I ask:  what\r\n\r\ncan  be  done to change this mindset and make Singapore 21  part\r\n\r\nand parcel of the Singaporean way of life?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent interview, RAdm Teo Chee Hean was reported to\r\n\r\nhave said in the papers that S21 has no target, no set programme\r\n\r\nand  no  agency to drive its implementation.  I want to ask  how\r\n\r\nthen  can we measure the success or otherwise of S21?  How  then\r\n\r\ncan  S21 touch the hearts of Singaporeans, reach all sectors  of\r\n\r\nSingaporean  society,  and  be the  cornerstone  of  Singaporean\r\n\r\nsociety?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things do not just happen overnight. The fact that S21 is\r\n\r\nformulated   and  debated  indicates  that  it   needs   to   be\r\n\r\ncrystallised  and be given a push.  We need a  facilitator.   We\r\n\r\nneed an organising genius.  We need an agency with the resources\r\n\r\nand the network to connect up the people, to uphold and keep the\r\n\r\nvision alive in the hearts and in the heartland, in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore, in reality, is a city state, not a nation,\r\n\r\nwith  a  big population or a big hinterland.  We are the  Sparta\r\n\r\nand  Athens of the East.  Singapore is a city state with a  tiny\r\n\r\npiece   of   property  and  a  small  multi-racial   population,\r\n\r\nsurrounded by much bigger neighbours.  We must not forget  that.\r\n\r\nYesterday,  the Prime Minister put this issue in perspective  in\r\n\r\nthis  House.   We have to compete fiercely in order to  survive.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to  make  ourselves useful to the world  in  order  to\r\n\r\nsurvive,  while at the same time dedicate enormous resources  to\r\n\r\ndefence and security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debates on values, priorities, aspirations and OB markers\r\n\r\nmust  take  into account these fundamental parameters  governing\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We cannot run away from the strategic imperatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the preface to the text of S21, it is proclaimed\r\n\r\nthat  the  five  ideas, arising from the five dilemmas,  form  a\r\n\r\nvision for the future.  It states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They are ideals that we strive for, to add to the timeless\r\n\r\nones  we  already  hold  as  a  nation   -   meritocracy,  clean\r\n\r\ngovernment, racial and religious harmony.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to differ on this point. It is an exaggeration\r\n\r\nand  a  misplaced  optimism, to catapult  and  categorise  clean\r\n\r\ngovernment, racial and religious harmony as the \"timeless ones\".\r\n\r\nThis  \"timeless\" quality or qualification seems to suggest  that\r\n\r\nthey  are given or solidly anchored in the context of Singapore.\r\n\r\nIf we believe they are, we are sadly mistaken.  Clean government\r\n\r\nand  racial and religious harmony are not given.  They  are  far\r\n\r\nfrom  being  internalised or institutionalised.  It  will  be  a\r\n\r\nmistake to presume or pretend that they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chew Swee Kee scandal, involving the then Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation and $700,000 of \"political gift\", helped to bring down\r\n\r\nthe Lim Yew Hock government and propelled the PAP into power  in\r\n\r\nthe  1959  General Elections.  The PAP, elected into government,\r\n\r\nproceeded  to  fulfil  its  election manifesto  and  made  clean\r\n\r\ngovernment a touchstone and unshakable pillar of the Government.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, erring officials are taken to task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not plain sailing. We have to keep an eye on things,\r\n\r\nespecially  when in some other countries, to be on the  take  is\r\n\r\npart of the political culture.  It is an intrinsic part of their\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I met some officials from another country and was told\r\n\r\nthat  being  elected is a ticket to wealth and prosperity.   You\r\n\r\nneed funds to get elected in the first instance.  After you  get\r\n\r\nelected,  you need to repay your benefactors, and  the  gate  is\r\n\r\nwide  open for patronage, for lining your own pockets.  This  is\r\n\r\nindeed a contagious environment for greed and corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nadesan Chandra, a Singaporean football referee,\r\n\r\nexemplified the Singaporean non-corrupt ethos, when he  rejected\r\n\r\na bribe to fix a match in Kuwait in 1987, and he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is just not Singaporean to be corrupt. Taking \"dirty\r\n\r\nmoney\"  has never been my cup of tea.  I am proud that I reacted\r\n\r\nand behaved like a genuine Singaporean.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, in Singapore, are clearly and absolutely against\r\n\r\ncorruption.   We  would have no part in such corrupt  practices.\r\n\r\nAnd  it  is  this  clean  government  policy  that  won  us  the\r\n\r\ninvestments and helped us to create jobs for our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clean government is able to lead with authority,\r\n\r\nsincerity  and is able to inspire and galvanize the people,  who\r\n\r\nwill  respond  to  calls for sacrifices and  belt-tightening  in\r\n\r\ntimes of crisis, as during this economic downturn.  But it is  a\r\n\r\nconstant  battle  of vigilance and of conviction.   Surely  this\r\n\r\ndeserves  to  be enshrined in S21, as an intrinsic and  integral\r\n\r\npart  of our Singaporean way of life, and not just mentioned  in\r\n\r\npassing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is even more critical to highlight, emphasise and\r\n\r\nreinforce  racial  and  religious  harmony,  rather  than   just\r\n\r\nmentioning it again in passing.  Racial and religious harmony is\r\n\r\nvital.   It  is  the very foundation for our internal  cohesion,\r\n\r\nbonding and indeed prosperity.  Without it, everything else will\r\n\r\nfail and fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest we forget, there were the Maria Hertogh riots of 1950,\r\n\r\nthe  racial riots of 1964 and across the Causeway, the May  13th\r\n\r\nriots  of 1969, which had spillover effects on Singapore  during\r\n\r\nthat  time.   I  remember  I  was a first-year  student  in  the\r\n\r\nuniversity.  Outside the campus, there were soldiers in  uniform\r\n\r\nwith  their  rifles ever ready to patrol the  streets.   Further\r\n\r\nafield,  there are racial and religious conflicts in Sri  Lanka,\r\n\r\nLebanon, Bosnia, Yugoslavia and Indonesia, nearby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Racial and religious harmony is precious. It must not be\r\n\r\ntaken  for granted.  It does not just happen.   We have to  work\r\n\r\nat  it constantly, day in and day out, in our place of work,  in\r\n\r\nour  neighbourhood  and  in  our very  own  homes.   Racial  and\r\n\r\nreligious  harmony  is  fragile.   Agent  provocateurs  or  some\r\n\r\ndisgruntled  and misguided fundamentalists or chauvinists  could\r\n\r\neasily stir the pot and arouse the emotions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, Sir, at the same time, commend the S21 Committee\r\n\r\nfor taking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  open  and consultative approach, and for reaching  out  and\r\n\r\ntouching  base  with 6,000 Singaporeans.  This is the  bottom-up\r\n\r\napproach  and  consultation at its best, and is indeed  laudable\r\n\r\nand very welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members of the public are glad and detected a shift in\r\n\r\nS21 towards a more open society, and a trend towards giving more\r\n\r\nspace  to individuals, with the battle cry of \"Every Singaporean\r\n\r\nmatters\".    Every  Singaporean is precious  and  matters.   His\r\n\r\nviews  matter.   His  interests matter,  and  his  contributions\r\n\r\nmatter.   One  can say that it is one for all and all  for  one.\r\n\r\nTogether,  we  make the difference.  We make the difference  for\r\n\r\nour families, for our society, and for our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But individual interests must be balanced by community\r\n\r\ninterests and national interests.  Individual interests must not\r\n\r\nbe allowed to ride roughshod over community and national\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the \"Shared Values\" paper, which was published and\r\n\r\ndebated in Parliament in 1991, it was clearly stated that one of\r\n\r\nthe  five  core values is \"Nation before community  and  society\r\n\r\nabove  self\".  The \"Shared Values\" paper expounded that,  and  I\r\n\r\nquote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Singapore is an Asian society. It has always weighted\r\n\r\ngroup interests more heavily than individual ones.  This balance\r\n\r\nhas  strengthened social cohesion, and enabled  Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\npull  together  to  surmount difficult challenges  collectively,\r\n\r\nmore  successfully  than other societies.  An  emphasis  on  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  has  been  a key survival value  for  Singapore.   We\r\n\r\nshould preserve and strengthen it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While strengthening communitarianism, the \"Shared Values\"\r\n\r\npaper  recognises  that  the individual also  has  rights  which\r\n\r\nshould  be  respected, and therefore added another  core  value:\r\n\r\n\"Regard and Community Support for the Individual\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the end, it is a matter of accommodation and a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  balance.   S21 should address this  and  put  it  in\r\n\r\nperspective.   Otherwise, individual interests may  loom  larger\r\n\r\nthan community and national interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the civil society, where active citizens participate\r\n\r\nfully in all sectors and make a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifference  to  society, civic groups, charitable organisations,\r\n\r\nclans,  and non-government organisations, all have relevant  and\r\n\r\nunique  roles  to play.  Each group has special and  significant\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  make and no doubt can make  a  difference  to\r\n\r\nsociety,  provided they are not self-interested and not  blinded\r\n\r\nand obsessed by self-interests.  We should not support those who\r\n\r\nuse  civic  groups as hobby horses to advance their own  selfish\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, over the years, a quick succession of strategic\r\n\r\nroadmaps or compasses.  In 1984, we had `Vision 1999'; in  1991,\r\n\r\nwe  had  `Shared Values'; and last year, the National  Education\r\n\r\nProgramme was in full swing with the Singapore Story Exhibition.\r\n\r\nAnd  now  Singapore  21.  Each of these, I  must  say,  has  its\r\n\r\nspecific purposes.  But it is all rather bewildering to the man-in-the-street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the way forward to the 21st century? How could we\r\n\r\nsell  S21 to the people?  How do we make sense of S21?  How many\r\n\r\nof  us,  for  example, remember the five core values  of  Shared\r\n\r\nValues,  which were debated in this House in 1991?  Honestly,  I\r\n\r\ncould  not  remember all the details.  I have to  hurry  to  the\r\n\r\nLibrary  to dig out the five core values in order to incorporate\r\n\r\nit.  Incidentally, the five core values, for the record, are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nation before community and society above self.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family as the basic unit of society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regard and community support for the individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consensus instead of contention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Racial and religious harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, therefore, the real test of S21, that is the point I\r\n\r\nwant to make, is whether any one of us could remember what it is\r\n\r\nall  about in a couple of years' time.  This is why I say if  we\r\n\r\nare  serious  about  S21, we should revise  it  and  incorporate\r\n\r\nelements  of Shared Values and National Education,  and  have  a\r\n\r\nnational civic body, or even a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnon-government body, to chart its course and promote it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S21 is our compass for the 21st century, and this compass\r\n\r\nwill  only  work well and guide us to the right path  if  it  is\r\n\r\nfounded on the fundamentals of Singapore and the geopolitics  of\r\n\r\nthe region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting aside our different approaches, at the end of the\r\n\r\nday,  S21 is about ownership of Singapore, S21 is about  passion\r\n\r\nfor Singapore, S21 is about commitment to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said in his National Day\r\n\r\nRally  speech  in  1996,  \"You have to feel  passionately  about\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Being Singaporean should resonate in our hearts  and\r\n\r\nminds.\"   If  S21 helps us to feel passionately about Singapore,\r\n\r\nit  is worth it.  Let us together then make it happen, and  make\r\n\r\nthe  difference  for  Singapore, for  our  children  and  future\r\n\r\ngenerations of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item of business under\r\n\r\ndiscussion be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions\r\n\r\nof Standing Order No. 1 - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE 21</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

The\r\n\r\nfive  key  issues identified encapsulate well the main  dilemmas\r\n\r\nfaced  by  Singapore as we move closer to becoming  a  developed\r\n\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I read the report, what went through my mind was: what\r\n\r\ndifference  will  this report make to the lives of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nimmediately and later?  Twenty years later, when I look at  this\r\n\r\nreport,  will I see it as a landmark report that really  made  a\r\n\r\ndifference  to  the lives and soul of Singaporeans?   Will  this\r\n\r\nreport  be seen as a defining moment in the history of Singapore\r\n\r\nwhere  Singaporeans really felt a difference?   Will  we  see  a\r\n\r\ngolden era of active citizens who care and share with others  in\r\n\r\nthe  wider community?  Will there be a difference thereafter  in\r\n\r\nthe political process and participation?  Is politics and public\r\n\r\npolicy  debate going to be only for politicians or for  everyone\r\n\r\nwho  has a stake in Singapore?  Will this new trinity of people,\r\n\r\npublic  and private sector consultation and cooperation  be  the\r\n\r\nnew political theory to be expounded and practised?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is Singapore ready to undertake an adventure into\r\n\r\nuncharted  waters  to define the parameters  of  greater  public\r\n\r\ninvolvement in policy-making, yet without upsetting  some  norms\r\n\r\nand  conventions built over the years?  Many, Sir, both  locally\r\n\r\nand  internationally, will be watching, whether these  are  mere\r\n\r\npropaganda  statements  for  public  consumption  or  a  genuine\r\n\r\nprogramme to bring about real change.  I am confident  that  the\r\n\r\ncomposition  of the S21 Committee and the many participants  who\r\n\r\ntook  part  in it had Singapore and Singaporeans at  heart  when\r\n\r\nthey  deliberated  the  report and  its  recommendations.   They\r\n\r\nreflect  the future Singapore Singaporeans want.  I am confident\r\n\r\nthat the Government and the people can make the quantum leap  to\r\n\r\nachieve the vision and the many goals defined in the S21 report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I originally intended to speak on the topic of active\r\n\r\ncitizens,  but when the Hon. Prime Minister spoke  yesterday,  I\r\n\r\nwas taken aback, to be candid, because he stated that we are not\r\n\r\na nation yet.  But earlier on, when I heard Hon. Minister Mr Lim\r\n\r\nBoon  Heng speak, he had mentioned that he was surprised by  the\r\n\r\narticle written by a journalist in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyesterday's  Straits  Times  where  she  stated  that  she   was\r\n\r\nsurprised at what the Prime Minister had said, and that  perhaps\r\n\r\nshe  said that there was a difference in viewpoint between those\r\n\r\nin  the  30s  and 50s.  And that brings me, Sir, to  the  fourth\r\n\r\nissue   that   is  raised  in  the  report,  that  is,   feeling\r\n\r\npassionately for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must confess that when the Prime Minister said yesterday\r\n\r\nthat we are not a nation yet, I was surprised because I grew  up\r\n\r\nin  the post-independence generation, and for me, all I know  is\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  my  home.  Perhaps there is  this  difference  in\r\n\r\nunderstanding what is Singapore all about and what is  Singapore\r\n\r\nas  a nation, and whether it means different things to different\r\n\r\npeople.   Sir, I belong to the post-independence generation.   I\r\n\r\nunderwent a school system where day in and day out we were  told\r\n\r\nthat:  This  is our home, this is our nation.  This was  carried\r\n\r\nthrough   secondary  school,  pre-university,  in  my   National\r\n\r\nService,  and  the university.  That is how we all were  brought\r\n\r\nup,  Sir.  So for the young, I am quite sure, just like me, many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  read the Prime Minister's  speech  yesterday,\r\n\r\nthey  would have been equally surprised because to most  of  us,\r\n\r\nSingapore is our nation.  But I understand the context in  which\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister made his speech - that Singapore is a  young\r\n\r\nnation and that there are pitfalls to be worried about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I endorse the speech of the Prime Minister in respect\r\n\r\nof  being on guard against fault lines in society.  But we  must\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  ensure  that Singapore as a  nation  continues  to\r\n\r\nbecome  stronger  and that the Government continues  to  develop\r\n\r\nthis  trust  and  in  being a fair Government  to  everybody  in\r\n\r\nsociety.   Singapore is a complex society comprising  people  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  races,  religions, languages  and  backgrounds.   One\r\n\r\nthing  that  has stood out, and I speak to everybody  who  comes\r\n\r\nfrom   different  racial  backgrounds,  language  or   religious\r\n\r\nbackground, is that what we have is a fair Government and it  is\r\n\r\na  Government that we trust.  And I think this is something that\r\n\r\nis  peculiar and something that all Singaporeans would  like  to\r\n\r\ncherish.   I  would like to encourage all Singaporeans  to  work\r\n\r\ntowards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nensuring that we continue to have a Government that is not  only\r\n\r\nfair but there is something also which is trustful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I elaborated earlier, I grew up in the post-independence generation. To me, the definition of Singapore\r\n\r\nright  up to the 1990s was that I did not see the difference  in\r\n\r\nbeing  Chinese, Indian or Malay.  But somewhere in the 1980s,  I\r\n\r\nfelt  that there was a difference in Government policy and  that\r\n\r\nwe had started focusing on issues regarding the different racial\r\n\r\ngroups  in  Singapore, and that there we took a divergent  line.\r\n\r\nAnd  perhaps  one  of the concerns that the Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\nraised  in  regard  to  these  differences  that  may  arise  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that  could have arisen in the  course  of  different\r\n\r\npolicies that have been implemented by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, things like community development organisations, we\r\n\r\nhave  to re-look whether they go towards building Singapore into\r\n\r\na cohesive, united society, or do they in the end, end up making\r\n\r\nour  society  a  divisive society.  I would  like  to  share  an\r\n\r\nexample.   I met the CEO of Sinda earlier this week and  he  had\r\n\r\ninformed  me that when they placed an advertisement  asking  for\r\n\r\nindividuals  to  sign up for their skills retraining  programme,\r\n\r\n90%  of  those who called Sinda called and complained.   90%  of\r\n\r\nthose who called were Chinese.  When they were told that Chinese\r\n\r\ncould  not  sign  up  for  this programme,  because  this  is  a\r\n\r\nprogramme organised by Sinda, they had complained, \"Why are  you\r\n\r\ndiscriminating  because  I am a Chinese?\"   This  gives  a  very\r\n\r\npeculiar picture in Singapore, because it makes us look back and\r\n\r\nwonder  whether  some of these measures that we have  introduced\r\n\r\nover these years have led to a more cohesive society, or we  are\r\n\r\nin  a  way  inadvertently leading to a society which may  become\r\n\r\ndivisive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I endorse the call of the S21 Committee that we make\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  feel passionately about Singapore.  My  generation\r\n\r\nis a generation that grew up and did national service.  And if I\r\n\r\nasked  many  of  my friends who had undergone national  service,\r\n\r\npush comes to shaft, \"Will you stand up for your country?\"  And\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  will tell you that, do or die, they will stand up and die for\r\n\r\nthis  country,  because this is the only nation  that  they  all\r\n\r\nknow.   I  endorse the call of the Committee to develop stronger\r\n\r\nties and a stronger commitment to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the topic which I came to speak\r\n\r\nabout, Sir, which is active citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now share with the Members of this House on\r\n\r\nwhat are some of my thoughts to encourage Singaporeans to become\r\n\r\nactive  citizens and what can be done to ensure that this report\r\n\r\nand its recommendations do become milestones in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, is the question of whether we should develop\r\n\r\nnational or international citizens.  The report states  that  an\r\n\r\nactive  citizen is one who takes an active part as a citizen  in\r\n\r\nmaking the country a better place to live.  I wish that the term\r\n\r\n\"our  citizens\"  would have been even more  broadly  defined  as\r\n\r\npeople who make both the country and the world a better place to\r\n\r\nlive.   There  are  many  Singaporeans  who  have  distinguished\r\n\r\nthemselves internationally in making the world a better place to\r\n\r\nlive.  I hope, Sir, many more Singaporeans would be involved  in\r\n\r\ninternational  volunteer work besides local volunteer  work,  so\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans are known not only as active citizens locally\r\n\r\nbut also internationally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here I see great potential for Singapore International\r\n\r\nFoundation  to  garner  the  many volunteers,  particularly  the\r\n\r\nincreasing   number  of  senior  citizens  to  do  international\r\n\r\nvolunteer  work.   I  welcome the setting  up  of  the  National\r\n\r\nVolunteer  Centre  by MCD and hope that it would  help  mobilise\r\n\r\nvolunteers for both local and international volunteer work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another area where I see a great role is for employers\r\n\r\nand schools to be involved in greater volunteer work.  The reach\r\n\r\nof  the  schools  and  all employers practically  reaches  every\r\n\r\nhousehold.  If we can develop a volunteer programme whereby  all\r\n\r\nschools and all employers are involved in doing community  work,\r\n\r\njust\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby setting aside one hour a week to undertake community work,  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  would  have  reached a large number  of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ngetting  involved  in volunteer work.  And by  imbibing  in  the\r\n\r\nyoung,  particularly in the schools, a sense of doing  community\r\n\r\nservice, a sense of doing common volunteer work, I think this is\r\n\r\nsomething that they carry on throughout their life and  it  will\r\n\r\nshow commitment to serving the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I do hope to see is greater volunteerism among\r\n\r\nthe  public sector and private sector employees so that not  one\r\n\r\nsector but all sectors of the society are involved in building a\r\n\r\nbetter  Singapore.   I  also  hope that  the  proposed  National\r\n\r\nVolunteer Centre can reach out to both employers and schools  in\r\n\r\na big way in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another recurrent thing that has appeared in the\r\n\r\ncolumn  of  Active  Citizens  in the  S21  Report  is  that  the\r\n\r\nrecurrent theme among a number of Singaporeans is that they  are\r\n\r\nnot  being consulted and there is a climate of fear in  speaking\r\n\r\nout  against Government policies which they feel are ineffective\r\n\r\nor  wrong.   The  Government has made big, bold moves  from  not\r\n\r\nhaving  enough  consultation with the public to where  there  is\r\n\r\nsubstantial consultation.  But the public view is that there  is\r\n\r\nstill not enough consultation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I recollect an incident. About four years ago, when\r\n\r\nI  participated  in a public dialogue session, a  young  person,\r\n\r\nwhom  I  believed was from the university, got up and criticised\r\n\r\nthat  there was not enough freedom in Singapore and she went  on\r\n\r\nto  criticise  the Government.  Then I turned around  and  asked\r\n\r\nher,  \"The fact that you stand up and criticise, don't you  feel\r\n\r\nthat  you have the freedom?\".  And she kept quiet.  What I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  highlight  is  that, while they  complain,  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmeasures  have  been  undertaken  by  the  Government  for  more\r\n\r\nconsultation.    However,  the  public  not  only   wants   more\r\n\r\nconsultation,  but they would also like to be consulted  at  the\r\n\r\npre-policy stage rather than at the post-policy stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a classic example, particularly during the Feedback\r\n\r\nUnit  sessions,  is the feedback session held  over  the  Budget\r\n\r\nsession.  Many of these feedback panel participants usually feel\r\n\r\nthat  the feedback and discussion on the Budget should  be  done\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Budget is presented and not after it is  presented.\r\n\r\nSo  there  was a call for the consultation and feedback sessions\r\n\r\nto  be held before a policy is made rather than after the policy\r\n\r\nis  made.  I hope this is something that the Government can look\r\n\r\ninto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what can the Government do? The Government, for a\r\n\r\nstart, could encourage the relevant non-sensitive information to\r\n\r\nbe  disseminated timely so that members of the public  can  give\r\n\r\nconsidered  feedback  or  suggestions.   At  times,  the  public\r\n\r\nsuggestions may not be helpful, not because they are not thought\r\n\r\nthrough  but  because they are premised on inadequate  or  wrong\r\n\r\ninformation.  This leads to a win-win situation as we have a far\r\n\r\nlarger  pool  of  people  looking  at  the  problem  and  giving\r\n\r\nsuggestions.   It  may  be difficult for  some  civil  servants,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the Administrative Service officers  who  are  the\r\n\r\nbest  and brightest, to accept that the public can come out with\r\n\r\nbetter  policy  options.  This may be due  to  the  mindset  and\r\n\r\nexpectations  of the Administrative Service to be the  best  and\r\n\r\nhave considered everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering policy options, the civil servant may\r\n\r\nharbour  a  feeling that the suggestion from  a  member  of  the\r\n\r\npublic which is accepted and implemented may imply a failure  on\r\n\r\ntheir  part  to  have  identified and implemented  it.   Such  a\r\n\r\nthinking must be discarded and the mindset must be changed.  The\r\n\r\nPS21  guidelines and programmes that have been implemented  have\r\n\r\ngone  to  a  large extent to change the mindset  of  the  public\r\n\r\nservice, but more can definitely be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also definitely more scope for pre-policy\r\n\r\nconsultation.  I applaud the call by the Deputy Prime  Minister,\r\n\r\nBG  Lee  Hsien  Loong, in March this year at the  Administrative\r\n\r\nService  Dinner, that the Administrative Service  should  change\r\n\r\nits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmindset  and to involve the people sector in its policy  making.\r\n\r\nI  am  convinced that our Ministers recognise the sea change  in\r\n\r\npublic eagerness to participate.  But it has to sink deep in the\r\n\r\nmentality  of  the civil servants.  Perhaps,  they  need  to  be\r\n\r\nadvised that not all the information is official secret  and  to\r\n\r\nshare information and gain policy input from the public is a win-win formula not only for the public service but for Singapore as\r\n\r\na whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to encourage a culture of consultation and involvement\r\n\r\nwith  the  public,  the civil service must  also  recognise  and\r\n\r\nreward  officers who take this process seriously and engage  the\r\n\r\npublic for better policy making.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also a call to make more use of technology to\r\n\r\nimprove  the consultative process.  I would urge all  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments to make greater use of technology like the  Internet\r\n\r\nto  get speedy feedback and suggestions from as large a pool  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans as possible so that everybody will feel that he has\r\n\r\ncontributed  towards policy making in Singapore.  What  can  the\r\n\r\npeople  do  then?   It  takes  two to  tango.   Equally,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  that  the public respond with vigour,  sincerity  and\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  The discussions must be on a platform of  doing\r\n\r\nand  achieving the best for Singaporeans and Singapore.  We must\r\n\r\nbe tolerant to different views.  The participation by the public\r\n\r\nshould  not be merely armchair criticisms and offering of views.\r\n\r\nThey must also follow through, where possible, with action, what\r\n\r\nthe  report referred to as \"walk the talk\".  The Government must\r\n\r\nalso  facilitate this.  Groups of individuals who share  similar\r\n\r\ninterests  and want to advocate certain views should be  allowed\r\n\r\nto  flourish  without unease.  Rules and regulations  should  be\r\n\r\nchanged  to  help  create and flourish the development  of  such\r\n\r\ninterest groups.  At the same time, we must also recognise  that\r\n\r\nnot  all  Singaporeans want to participate in such consultation.\r\n\r\nThey  are happy that there are avenues for them to give feedback\r\n\r\nand discuss matters they feel strongly about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other complaint among Singaporeans is that, although\r\n\r\nthey hold differing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviews,  they  are  afraid to speak up for fear  of  being  black\r\n\r\nmarked  or  picked up by the Internal Security  Department.   We\r\n\r\nknow  that there is no such black mark namelist and this  is  an\r\n\r\nunjustified perception.  The Government must work harder to help\r\n\r\nclear this perception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, some of our laws, which were prepared in the\r\n\r\n1950s or 1960s to deal with a different era, must be relooked at\r\n\r\nso  that they would give comfort to Singaporeans.  Many of these\r\n\r\nlaws  are so widely defined that they can be picked up, arrested\r\n\r\nor  charged for any of these widely defined offences.   Perhaps,\r\n\r\nwe  can relook at some of these laws to make sure that they  are\r\n\r\nnot  very  narrowly defined and people need not fear  when  they\r\n\r\nspeak  up their minds or when they want to go out and do  things\r\n\r\nwhich are in the interest of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps, here, the OB markers could be made clear so\r\n\r\nthat people do not harbour any suspicion or fear of being picked\r\n\r\nup.   When an OB marker is arbitrarily defined, it frightens the\r\n\r\npublic  and many may withdraw from public participation.  Public\r\n\r\ndiscussion   should  be  encouraged  not  only   in   Government\r\n\r\norganisations  like the Feedback Unit, People's  Association  or\r\n\r\nthink-tanks like IPS.  Ministers, MPs and civil servants  should\r\n\r\nmake  time to participate in as many relevant forums as possible\r\n\r\nto  increase  the  consultative  process.   Just  like  justice,\r\n\r\nconsultation must not only be done but must also be seen  to  be\r\n\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other thing that the Report calls for is for\r\n\r\nactive  citizens  to  take  action  and  assume  responsibility,\r\n\r\nrolling up their sleeves to help implement what they envision or\r\n\r\nsuggest.   This  is something very laudable.   The  public  must\r\n\r\nrecognise  that not all their views and opinions  are  workable.\r\n\r\nWhen a decision is finally reached, they must equally close rank\r\n\r\nand  support  it  wholeheartedly  for  democracy  is  all  about\r\n\r\naccepting the views and opinions of the majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see the S21 Report as a guidance to what a parent\r\n\r\nwill give to his young children who have just turned 21 years of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nage.  It is up to the young person to decide what he wants to do\r\n\r\nwith  the guidance which his parents has given, just as the  S21\r\n\r\nCommittee  has  given  this  Report to  the  Singapore  society.\r\n\r\nSingapore is coming of age as we enter the new millennium.   Let\r\n\r\nus  work together to make the 21st century a place where we  can\r\n\r\ndream  and  realise our vision of a home, a home we can  all  be\r\n\r\nproud of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfor  allowing me to join in this debate.  I rise in  support  of\r\n\r\nthe motion standing in the name of the Minister for Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the outset, I would like to congratulate the S21\r\n\r\nCommittee on an effort that has been quite sincere to canvass  a\r\n\r\nwide  spectrum  of  views  in order  to  forge  this  vision  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  in the next century.  The process has been bipartisan\r\n\r\nand  exhaustive, if not exhausting, given the Committee's desire\r\n\r\nto reach out to as many Singaporeans as possible.  The result is\r\n\r\ncertainly  a  compelling  vision that  embraces  our  collective\r\n\r\naspirations as a people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an important point made in the S21 Report is that the\r\n\r\nfive key ideas complement those that have already served us well\r\n\r\n-  clean  government,  meritocracy,  and  racial  and  religious\r\n\r\nharmony.   Yesterday, our Prime Minister made a passionate  case\r\n\r\nwhy  these ideals, particularly our multi-racial harmony, should\r\n\r\nnot  be  taken for granted.  To me, it was a timely and sobering\r\n\r\nreminder to keep our feet firmly planted on the ground  even  as\r\n\r\nwe  reach  for  the  stars.   I was not  puzzled  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  speech or the import of his message.   In  fact,  it\r\n\r\nstruck  a chord.  So I do not think it is a generational  issue.\r\n\r\nBut I do think it is a matter of perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a concern among some Singaporeans that we may\r\n\r\nbe  becoming  more ethnocentric at the expense of  our  national\r\n\r\nidentity.  Some Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicies  like the advent of self-help groups, the establishment\r\n\r\nof  SAP  schools  or the introduction of ethnic  quotas  in  HDB\r\n\r\nestates  may  have accentuated these anxieties.  While  each  of\r\n\r\nthese policies has its own forceful rationale, each also has  an\r\n\r\ninescapable  ethnic dimension.  And some have  argued  that  all\r\n\r\nsuch  policies should be dismantled because of their ethnic hue.\r\n\r\nOthers  feel that some policies, especially those that segregate\r\n\r\nlike the self-help groups, should be reviewed.  Indeed, this was\r\n\r\nthe  thrust of the Straits Times commentary today on yesterday's\r\n\r\nproceedings  in  Parliament.  Yet,  others  have  absolutely  no\r\n\r\nproblems with any of these policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to me, it is clear from this debate, be it on self-help groups, SAP schools, or any of the other ethnic based\r\n\r\nissues,  that  we  Singaporeans, all  of  us,  attach  paramount\r\n\r\nimportance to multi-racial harmony.  It is also equally clear to\r\n\r\nme  from  this  debate that we do not all agree  on  what  form,\r\n\r\ndirection  or,  indeed, the paradigm we should adopt  in  moving\r\n\r\nforward as a society to maintain that harmony.  One view is that\r\n\r\nthe  four circles, which the Prime Minister described yesterday,\r\n\r\nshould progressively migrate closer together and, ultimately, be\r\n\r\nperfectly  aligned,  creating one circle,  one  homogeneous  and\r\n\r\nunified society.  An alternative perspective is that whilst  the\r\n\r\noverlap   should   be  maximised,  a  certain   variegation   is\r\n\r\nunavoidable, indeed, it may be necessary, creating a clover-like\r\n\r\nmosaic  where there is common ground and yet there are  distinct\r\n\r\nareas as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have listened to these alternative points of view\r\n\r\nwith  much attention, not just in the course of this debate  but\r\n\r\nover the years.  I too have had my doubts, especially when I was\r\n\r\nasked to take up the assignment as the first CEO, Sinda.  It was\r\n\r\nwith    considerable   trepidation   that   I    accepted    the\r\n\r\nresponsibility.   I  was concerned that I might  unwittingly  be\r\n\r\npart of an endeavour that might undo a lot of good work that had\r\n\r\nbeen  done over the last decades, that it would set us  back  in\r\n\r\nour  efforts  to build a multi-racial society, and  that  is  an\r\n\r\nideal  I hold very close to my  heart.  But once I took  on  the\r\n\r\njob, I was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsurprised and, I must say, relieved to find that there  were  no\r\n\r\nteeming  hordes of parochialists waiting to engage in a game  of\r\n\r\none-upmanship with other communities.  Instead, to my  pleasure,\r\n\r\nwhat  I  did  find were individuals who were eager to contribute\r\n\r\nwithin the context of the community.  They had recognised a need\r\n\r\nwithin  the  community  and  had  been  seeking  resources   and\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  do  so.   The  self-help  group  gave  them  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to be active citizens, in the parlance of  Singapore\r\n\r\n21.   And I am sure other colleagues who are in Parliament today\r\n\r\nlike  Mr  Chan  Soo  Sen and Mr Zainul Abidin  could  attest  to\r\n\r\nsimilar experiences in CDAC and Mendaki.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to me, the self-help groups are very much like a paint\r\n\r\nbrush.  In the hands of an artist, it is a tool of creation.  In\r\n\r\nthe  hands of a tradesman, it is a tool of utility.  But in  the\r\n\r\nhands of a vandal, it is a tool of destruction.  It is very much\r\n\r\nthe  intent  of  the user and how we manage its use.   Self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  are  a  response to a challenge within the  context  and\r\n\r\nconstraints of present day realities.  And I believe  a  similar\r\n\r\nargument  can  be  made  for  other  ethnic  based  policies  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It is for this reason that I believe such endeavours\r\n\r\ndeserve  continued support from the people and  the  Government.\r\n\r\nBut  it  is precisely because that in the wrong hands, they  can\r\n\r\nalso  go  tragically astray that we must also be  vigilant.   We\r\n\r\nmust  encourage  CDAC,  Mendaki, AMP,  Sinda  and  the  Eurasian\r\n\r\nAssociation to find common ground to work together.  But we must\r\n\r\nalso  be  willing to blow the whistle if we feel they are  going\r\n\r\nastray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are self-help groups an ideal solution? Probably not. But\r\n\r\nthen  again, I do not think we live in utopia.  Are there risks?\r\n\r\nI think so.  But I am not convinced that we will be closer to an\r\n\r\nideal   society   by   merely  dissolving   or   merging   these\r\n\r\norganisations today.  Ultimately, the challenge for Singapore is\r\n\r\nto  maintain racial and religious harmony within a society  that\r\n\r\nis changing and is facing new constraints all the time.  We need\r\n\r\npragmatic and dynamic responses to these challenges.  But we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  a consensus on what model or what modality we  should\r\n\r\nuse.  What it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncalls  for  is a practical mind to respond as we see appropriate\r\n\r\nat  that  time  to  these  challenges, without  undermining  our\r\n\r\nfundamental beliefs, but making sure that it contributes to  the\r\n\r\noverall growth of our society.  And it is in this context,  with\r\n\r\nthe  on-going  endeavour  as  the basis,  that  an  effort  like\r\n\r\nSingapore 21 will also thrive.  That, to me, Sir, was the import\r\n\r\nof the Prime Minister's message yesterday, and a message which I\r\n\r\nfeel all Singaporeans would do well to bear in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of active citizenship is an attractive and\r\n\r\ncompelling  one.  To me, it is an invitation to each citizen  to\r\n\r\nbe  actively  engaged  at all levels in  this  endeavour  called\r\n\r\nSingapore,  in order to make a difference to society.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to share some observations I have about active citizenship\r\n\r\nbased on my experience with NGOs, VWOs, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one, active citizenship will start from the bottom up.\r\n\r\nSome  may think that being an active citizen means participating\r\n\r\nin  policy discussions and formulation at the highest  level  of\r\n\r\nGovernment.   While  this is an important  contribution,  active\r\n\r\ncitizenship  cannot  just be about sitting  at  a  round  table,\r\n\r\ndebating  the relative merits of various policy options.   There\r\n\r\nare  other more earthly matters that are equally worthy  of  our\r\n\r\nattention and energy.  These include municipal issues  and  also\r\n\r\nsocial  concerns  within  our neighbourhood.   The  citizen  who\r\n\r\nparticipates in a Neighbourhood Watch Group is as worthy of  our\r\n\r\nrecognition  as  another who is a member of the  National  Crime\r\n\r\nPrevention Council.  No contribution can be too small, no matter\r\n\r\nat what level it is made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel that active citizenship is about commitment. A\r\n\r\nregular  lament in Singapore is the lack of time,  and  I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  legitimate  grouse and one  that  cannot  be  taken\r\n\r\nlightly, given the genuine time pressure that Singaporeans  face\r\n\r\nin our daily grind.  Yet, what I find ironic is that some of the\r\n\r\nmost  active  citizens I have had the pleasure  of  meeting  are\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  also involved in numerous other activities  and\r\n\r\nthis   is  in  addition  to  juggling  their  family  and   work\r\n\r\ncommitments.  They are truly an inspiration to all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  us  and  they teach us an important lesson that we  can  all\r\n\r\ncontribute  if we choose to make active citizenship an  integral\r\n\r\npart of our lives.  To do so, we need to be creative and perhaps\r\n\r\nfind one area of interest in which to participate in tandem with\r\n\r\nour  interests  at  the  different phases  of  our  lives.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  one  could  contemplate the life cycle  of  an  active\r\n\r\ncitizen  as  commencing at the student stage in social  service,\r\n\r\nmoving  on into young adulthood in youth groups, and then  going\r\n\r\non  as  a young parent into parenting organisations, as an older\r\n\r\nparent  in  school  management,  and  ultimately,  as  an  older\r\n\r\nSingaporean in senior citizen groups and counselling.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter of will.  The opportunities will always be there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I do believe active citizenship requires a\r\n\r\npositive mindset.  Last year, I was involved in a forum on civil\r\n\r\nsociety.  What surprised me most in the course of the discussion\r\n\r\nwas  the  suspicion that some of the panelists had  about  being\r\n\r\nassociated  with  Government-related  entities,  be  they   town\r\n\r\ncouncils,  CDCs or feedback groups.  They felt that their  civil\r\n\r\nsociety  credentials  might somehow be  tarnished  if  they  got\r\n\r\ninvolved  in such organisations.  I cannot understand  why  they\r\n\r\nhave  such  distrust.   If  an organisation  serves  worthwhile,\r\n\r\nsocial and community objectives that we can identify with,  then\r\n\r\nshould  we  not feel moved to participate in its activities  and\r\n\r\nsupport  it?   Or is the mere fact that it enjoys some  form  of\r\n\r\nGovernment blessing a turn-off?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot has been said about how active citizenship can be\r\n\r\nfacilitated.  As an ex-civil servant, I think one area is surely\r\n\r\nin  the civil service.  The civil service can undertake measures\r\n\r\nto  create  more opportunities for Singaporeans  to  give  their\r\n\r\nviews  in the course of policy formulation.  One trick could  be\r\n\r\nto  define  the problem and issue first, and wait  for  a  while\r\n\r\nlater  before  we  come  up  with the  solutions,  allowing  the\r\n\r\nintervening time for individuals with the knowledge and interest\r\n\r\nto contribute their point of view.  It would also be helpful, as\r\n\r\nmany others in this House have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid, when contributions are received, even if they have already\r\n\r\nbeen  thought  of by the Government agencies, it will  still  be\r\n\r\nworth our while to acknowledge the value of these contributions.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, occasionally, at least, it would be helpful to\r\n\r\nexplain why certain ideas cannot be accommodated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that all this would probably spell much hard work, a\r\n\r\nvery  circuitous  route  in  the way  policy  is  formulated  in\r\n\r\nGovernment.   But  if we can strike a balance between  efficient\r\n\r\npolicy  formulation and a Singapore 21 compliant  approach  from\r\n\r\ntime to time, then I think we will be better off as a country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to people, a lot has been said about the\r\n\r\npeople  sector  and  its active citizenship and  involvement  in\r\n\r\ncontributing  ideas.  One observation I would like  to  make  is\r\n\r\nthat we should not be deterred if our ideas do not automatically\r\n\r\nget  absorbed in the policy process.  Indeed, one should  expect\r\n\r\nthat  more often than not, the ideas may not find such  support.\r\n\r\nBut  we  must  have  the  maturity  and  the  tenacity  to  both\r\n\r\nunderstand  the mechanics of the process and, at the same  time,\r\n\r\nto persevere in order to get our point of view across.  That,  I\r\n\r\nthink, is the mark of a truly active citizen who has his eye  on\r\n\r\nthe ball.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a point on our leaders. We certainly want leaders who\r\n\r\nwill  listen and actively seek opinions.  In fact, we  certainly\r\n\r\nwant  leaders  who would even make themselves available  through\r\n\r\nradio  chat  shows to us.  But we also want leaders who,  having\r\n\r\nlistened all those points of view, will make a decision that  is\r\n\r\nin  the long-term interest of this country, not leaders who will\r\n\r\nslavishly follow a majority point of view.  That is not why  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore elected leaders.  We have been elected  and\r\n\r\nthe Ministers have been there in office because we have faith in\r\n\r\ntheir  judgement,  and it is important that  that  judgement  be\r\n\r\nexercised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, a point on the communication of this very\r\n\r\nimportant report.  S21, in my view, is quite fundamental and  it\r\n\r\nshould not reach a point where it does not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nget  absorbed by its total audience, all Singaporeans,  a  point\r\n\r\nthat  my  colleague,  Dr  Ong Chit Chung,  also  stressed.   One\r\n\r\nperception of this report is that it is the work of an  English-educated  intelligentsia.  Weighty words  like  \"knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy\",  \"active citizenship\" and \"Singapore  heartbeat\"  have\r\n\r\nbeen  used in this report.  But the Singapore heartbeat pulsates\r\n\r\nnot  just  in  Shenton  Way  and  Raffles  Place,  but  also  in\r\n\r\nChinatown, Geylang Serai, Serangoon Road and Ang Mo Kio.   I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  this  report  will make  good  copy  in  the  various\r\n\r\nlanguages,  but  whatever  the  case,  we  must  ensure  that  a\r\n\r\nconcerted effort is made to ensure that the message reaches  all\r\n\r\nquarters,  so that S21 remains a living document in  the  hearts\r\n\r\nand minds of all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport  of the motion standing in the name of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have well appreciated, understood and\r\n\r\narticulated the ideas contained in the report, especially in the\r\n\r\nlast section about active citizens, and especially the last  two\r\n\r\nMembers  who  have spoken.  I shall not repeat these  ideas.   I\r\n\r\nshould  like, instead, to focus my remarks on three areas:   (1)\r\n\r\nhow  do we think of the future and change? (2) how do we consult\r\n\r\nand  take  decisions?   (3) what do we mean  when  we  call  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to be \"active people\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a member of the Singapore 21 Committee and I hope that\r\n\r\nI  shall answer some of those who doubt this report and who have\r\n\r\nlabelled  its  recommendations as  mere  platitudes.   I  cannot\r\n\r\nsatisfy  those  who  are cynics, who have made  up  their  minds\r\n\r\nwithout reading this report or really listening.  But I do  hope\r\n\r\nto   persuade  those  who  may  be  skeptical,  those  who  have\r\n\r\nlegitimate doubts but, nevertheless, keep an open mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first point is: how do we think of the future and\r\n\r\nchange?   Singapore, our country, is driven by its  future.   We\r\n\r\nmay not have five-year plans, like many other countries, but  we\r\n\r\nare constantly setting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nourselves strategic visions and new aspirations such as those in\r\n\r\neducation  and  technopreneurship.  Often we  imagine  new  city\r\n\r\nscapes,  right  down to the details of a new  city  skyline  and\r\n\r\nliving  areas.   We  constantly talk  and  drive  towards  these\r\n\r\nfutures.   In  so doing, this change becomes naturalised,  taken\r\n\r\nfor granted.  What seems incredible today, is possible tomorrow,\r\n\r\nand then, \"of course\", the next day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you one example of our aims to be a global\r\n\r\ncity.   This was first, perhaps, articulated by the then Foreign\r\n\r\nMinister,  Mr  S  Rajaratnam.  But the idea of globalisation  or\r\n\r\nregionalisation took on greater significance in  the  Next  Lap.\r\n\r\nIn 1991, when the goal of Singapore going global or regional was\r\n\r\npushed, many had doubts, and few institutions (whether public or\r\n\r\nprivate  sector) had this as part of their aims and  programmes.\r\n\r\nGlobalisation  and the desire to be a global city  required,  in\r\n\r\nthis   sense,  a  change  of  mindset,  a  revolution   in   our\r\n\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet today, some eight years later, global or regional plans\r\n\r\nfigure   prominently  in  the  aspirations  of  most  companies,\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies and citizens.  It is taken for granted  that\r\n\r\nSingapore aims to be a global city and a regional hub.   We  are\r\n\r\nnot  there  yet, but we are firmly on that path.  The revolution\r\n\r\nin  thinking has been naturalised, so much so that when we  look\r\n\r\nback,  it  is too easy to think, \"what was the fuss about\"?   We\r\n\r\nhave   not  experienced  such  a  change  suddenly.    We   have\r\n\r\nexperienced a sea change that is deep and real, but  yet  subtly\r\n\r\nrealised.  Change has been like water on a stone.  So,  I  hope,\r\n\r\nit will be with the recommendations of the Singapore 21 report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In calling for such a change, do we neglect present\r\n\r\nrealities?   Yesterday,  Prime  Minister  Goh  Chok  Tong,   who\r\n\r\ncommissioned  this  report on Singapore's  heartware,  cautioned\r\n\r\nthat  all  Singaporeans should have a realism of  where  we  are\r\n\r\ntoday.   I  agree.  I do not take this as a dampener, nor  do  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  it was intended to be.  The Prime  Minister  also\r\n\r\nheld out the prospect of a future in which we can be a nation, a\r\n\r\ntribe  of Singaporeans and this is an important vision.  Realism\r\n\r\nis important to how we think\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  the  future.   It is the necessary difference  between  a\r\n\r\nvision and a pipe dream.  But to have a vision, ideals are  also\r\n\r\nnecessary.   It is part of the difference between mere  survival\r\n\r\nand a rich life here in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the Singapore 21 report is based on a\r\n\r\nrealistic  assessment of both immediate and longer term  trends.\r\n\r\nWe  all  should  be  aware of the present economic,  social  and\r\n\r\npolitical  uncertainties in the region around us.  Amidst  these\r\n\r\ngreat  imponderables,  we have very few  certainties  which  the\r\n\r\nreport  looks at: (1) that our youth and children are  different\r\n\r\nfrom  us  or  the preceding generation and will be part  of  the\r\n\r\nchange  that Singapore will experience in the 21st century;  (2)\r\n\r\nthat the aged that this report talks about are not those who are\r\n\r\naged  today, but all of us here, who are in our 30s  or  40s  or\r\n\r\nolder;  and (3) that in a globalised world and the drive towards\r\n\r\na  knowledge-based economy, one of the few certainties about the\r\n\r\nfuture is that it will be different from the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, how do we think about the future and make\r\n\r\nplans amidst such uncertainties and changing circumstances? Some\r\n\r\nhave  called  for  implementation, here and now,  of  particular\r\n\r\npolicies and details.  These are in the Singapore 21 Report  and\r\n\r\ndeliberations of the subject committees.  Many suggestions  have\r\n\r\nbeen canvassed, separately published and released.  But this  is\r\n\r\nnot  the essence of S21 or how we have tried to think about  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  Singapore 21 offers, in this sense, a compass, and  not\r\n\r\na  blueprint or road map, as the hon. Member, Dr Ong Chit Chung,\r\n\r\nmentioned.   This compass is to better recognise and  deal  with\r\n\r\nthe uncertainties and rapid change which we will face ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you look at a road map of Singapore from last year,\r\n\r\nthere  is a very real prospect there will be new roads and whole\r\n\r\nhousing estates that you will not find in that map.  If  you use\r\n\r\na road map\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom five years ago, you are bound to get lost.  If you look  at\r\n\r\na  road map from the 1970s or the 1960s, you will think that you\r\n\r\nare  in  a  different country.  Road maps go out  of  date  very\r\n\r\nquickly in Singapore.  But the cardinal points of north,  south,\r\n\r\neast  and  west remain the same.  They are what you can navigate\r\n\r\nwith,  even  as  the terrains change.  And it is these  cardinal\r\n\r\npoints  of  a  compass for the coming century that Singapore  21\r\n\r\noffers as guidance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to my next point. How do we consult and take\r\n\r\ndecisions?  It has already been mentioned that some 6,000 people\r\n\r\nwere  consulted and contributed ideas to the S21  Report.   Some\r\n\r\nhave  questioned  if this is enough.  Others have  wondered  how\r\n\r\nrepresentative  these people were, whether the  ordinary  public\r\n\r\nwere  allowed  their say.  Opposition Members, MP Mr  Chiam  See\r\n\r\nTong  and NCMP Mr J B Jeyaretnam, have suggested that they  were\r\n\r\nintentionally left out.  They forget that Singapore 21 Chairman,\r\n\r\nMinister  Teo Chee Hean, wrote to all MPs in this House  to  ask\r\n\r\nfor  their  views.  This is how and why Member of Parliament  Mr\r\n\r\nLow Thia Khiang became one of the 6,000 people consulted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But was 6,000 enough, and how representative and open was\r\n\r\nthe process?  This is the important question.  6,000 may seem to\r\n\r\nbe a small percentage of our population.  But it represents many\r\n\r\nhours  and  much  work  in both listening and  discussing.   The\r\n\r\nCommittee could have consulted more people, of course, but if we\r\n\r\ndid  so,  we  may well have delayed the Report on  Singapore  21\r\n\r\nuntil  it  was already the 21st century.  More to the point,  we\r\n\r\nwere open through the Internet and other fora to all.   Also,  I\r\n\r\nwould say that we reached a point at which most of the views  we\r\n\r\nreceived   from  additional  people  were  things   others   had\r\n\r\npreviously said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say we consulted 6,000 people, this does not mean,\r\n\r\nof  course, that Singapore 21 Report is a compilation of all the\r\n\r\nideas  and  views  we heard, nor does it mean that  6,000  would\r\n\r\nagree to all of the Report.  Consultation does not always\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmean  consensus.  Indeed, the more we heard, the more  difficult\r\n\r\nit  was  to find concurrence and convergence.  This was part  of\r\n\r\none  of our stated dilemmas, and we lived, and still live,  with\r\n\r\nthe tensions in this process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Member of Parliament, Mr S Iswaran, said before me, we\r\n\r\ncan  listen, but we have to make decisions.  I can tell you  all\r\n\r\nthings  were debated, or debatable.  I can tell you  there  were\r\n\r\ndifferences,  big and small.  There were differences  among  the\r\n\r\npeople  we  spoke  to, between the subject  committees  and  the\r\n\r\npeople they heard from, there were differences between one  such\r\n\r\ncommittee and another, and there were differences even among the\r\n\r\nmain   committee  themselves.   But,  indeed,  differences   and\r\n\r\ndiversity  are healthy.  It is part of being an open and  plural\r\n\r\nsociety, and it is part of the process of consultation.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  thank, as a member of S21, all those who participated.\r\n\r\nI  learnt  much from them, even if I did not include  all  their\r\n\r\nideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally, part of the process of consultation was to find\r\n\r\ncommon  ground,  not  to  reduce things  to  the  lowest  common\r\n\r\ndenominator,  but to distil key principles.  In  this,  the  S21\r\n\r\nCommittee  exercised  judgment.   Under  the  guidance  of   its\r\n\r\nChairman,  Minister Teo, some suggestions have  been  left  out,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  found  little  or no  wider  agreement.   Others,\r\n\r\nespecially  those  dealing  with specific  policies,  have  been\r\n\r\nsurfaced  in  the subject committee deliberations, but  are  not\r\n\r\npart  of  the  main Report.  If you look at these deliberations,\r\n\r\nyou  will see consideration of such ideas as flexible work hours\r\n\r\nand a 5-day week, dual citizenship, that GPCs should hold public\r\n\r\nhearings  on  important  issues, and  that  we  need  to  better\r\n\r\ndistinguish  grassroots organisations from the  People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty.   Such  policies  have  been debated,  because  they  are\r\n\r\nimportant  and controversial ideas.  But they do  not  form  the\r\n\r\ncore  of  Singapore 21 principles, because they are not settled,\r\n\r\nand do not yet find consensus, if they ever will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with this approach. This is necessary if the\r\n\r\nReport is not to become a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlaundry list of miscellaneous and perhaps conflicting items.   I\r\n\r\nagree  because the S21 Report was not set up to look at specific\r\n\r\npolicies, but at the heartware that undergirds all policies.   I\r\n\r\nagree  because after all the consultations, someone must  decide\r\n\r\nand  act.   Perhaps,  most  importantly,  I  agree  because  the\r\n\r\nSingapore 21 Report is not an end point, not the final  word  on\r\n\r\nthis policy or that.  Rather, what I hope is that this Report is\r\n\r\na  beginning,  a  launch pad for future and  further  review  of\r\n\r\npolicies  that  concern or touch on the principles  of  the  S21\r\n\r\nReport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what I tried myself to do when, in this House two\r\n\r\ndays  ago,  I spoke against the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill  at  its  Third Reading.  It is not that the  Singapore  21\r\n\r\nReport  says that such a Bill is wrong.  It is that I fear  that\r\n\r\nit  may  have consequences that run in tension with some of  the\r\n\r\nprinciples.   Others  in  this House  or  in  the  Singapore  21\r\n\r\nCommittee, I think, do not agree, and they are free  to  do  so.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I have listened, in these past two days, to other MPs\r\n\r\nattach  many  different  concerns to  the  broad  framework  and\r\n\r\nprinciples  of the S21 Report, from the call to give more  money\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Government to the Consumers' Association of Singapore\r\n\r\n(CASE), to the use of parks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of this is in the Report, but this is the point. I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  what  can  make the  Singapore  21  Report  truly\r\n\r\nsomething, that is, from the people and for the people, is  that\r\n\r\nwe  talk about the principles and apply them to new policies  as\r\n\r\nthey  emerge.   Not  whether we talked to  6,000  or  60,000  or\r\n\r\n600,000 or everyone in Singapore twice, but whether this  Report\r\n\r\nwill  go  on to be discussed, debated and accepted, in whole  or\r\n\r\npart,  by  the people as part of the new and specific  different\r\n\r\nissues  they  will face in the future.  I hope, in  this  sense,\r\n\r\nthat  the  S21 Report will be a continuing source of discussion,\r\n\r\nsomething  of continuing relevance and acceptance, but  also  of\r\n\r\ncontroversy.  Because principles are like that.  They  allow  us\r\n\r\nto  constantly question a particular direction of where  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing,  and not merely the details of how to get there.  Change,\r\n\r\nas I see it, is a continuing process, especially change that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naims  at  mindsets and key principles.  And I hope that the  S21\r\n\r\nReport  will  be part of a process of change, and  not  its  end\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of this is already happening, I believe. For example,\r\n\r\nI  hope  that some of the Singapore 21 discussions on attracting\r\n\r\nforeign talent and looking after Singaporeans will be of use  to\r\n\r\nthe Committee on Manpower 21.  When I read DPM Lee Hsien Loong's\r\n\r\nrecent speech to the civil service and his call for them  to  be\r\n\r\nmore open to views from citizens, I thought it furthered part of\r\n\r\nthe call to enable greater consultation and an active citizenry.\r\n\r\nI  have  followed, similarly, the establishment of  a  citizen's\r\n\r\nnetwork,  which  calls itself \"The Working  Committee  on  Civil\r\n\r\nSociety\",  and I see it as part of the response to the  S21  and\r\n\r\nits  call  for  an  active people sector.   I  hope  other  such\r\n\r\ninitiatives  will  follow, not just from the Government  in  the\r\n\r\npublic sector, or because the Government calls for it, but  also\r\n\r\nfrom the private sector and from the people sector.  I hope that\r\n\r\nsuch  initiatives will be aligned to the concerns and principles\r\n\r\nof the S21 Report, even if they do not explicitly refer to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn now to my third and final point. What do we\r\n\r\nmean  when we call for Singaporeans to be \"active people\"?  This\r\n\r\ndeals  with  a  particular part of the S21 Report,  that  I  co-chaired with the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar, Mr Lim Swee Say,\r\n\r\non  \"consultation and consensus against decisiveness  and  quick\r\n\r\naction\".   It also relates to the call to make sure that  \"Every\r\n\r\nSingaporean matters\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not agree that the call for an active people or for\r\n\r\nevery  Singaporean to matter are platitudes.   Rather,  I  think\r\n\r\nthese  principles  call  for  a  quiet  revolution  in  the  way\r\n\r\nSingapore has traditionally done things, and the way governments\r\n\r\nin  the past have viewed people.  It is a  quiet revolution that\r\n\r\nis  required by changed circumstances in the global economy  and\r\n\r\nthe  political  landscape, and by a people  who  have  different\r\n\r\naspirations.   It  is  also an unfolding revolution  that  faces\r\n\r\nconsiderable obstacles today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have been used to saying, \"People are our\r\n\r\nonly resource\".  This is an accepted truth.  But part of the way\r\n\r\nthis  truth has been seen is that people become just a resource.\r\n\r\nThat  is to say, people become important only in so far as  they\r\n\r\ngive utility to the national good, the economic bottom line.  In\r\n\r\nthis  view,  people can be seen as having to fit  into  assigned\r\n\r\njobs  and created categories or else they do not fit in at  all.\r\n\r\nIn this, there is a tendency to see people solely in an economic\r\n\r\nparadigm,  as  cogs  in  a grand machine,  and  not  as  people.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the machine, in this misinterpretation  of  \"people\r\n\r\nare  our only resource\", was designed, driven and refined  by  a\r\n\r\nsmall elite, and not the people themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe this is an over generalisation. But such a contrast\r\n\r\nallows  us to see the quiet but real revolution in the  call  to\r\n\r\nmake  every Singaporean matter, and to have an active citizenry.\r\n\r\nWhat  the  S21  Report  calls for goes beyond  the  politics  of\r\n\r\nconsultation  that Prime Minister Goh and his second  generation\r\n\r\nteam brought.  It calls not just for ideas but for actions.   It\r\n\r\ncalls not just for suggestions but for initiative.  It calls for\r\n\r\nparticipation.  It calls for ownership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S21 Report is not saying that we are already there.\r\n\r\nThe  Report points to obstacles.  This includes especially  what\r\n\r\nwe  have  referred  to  as  the \"Black Book\"  and  \"Black  Hole\"\r\n\r\nproblems, that people do not speak or act because they  fear  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  held against them, or because there is no feedback  or\r\n\r\ndiscernible response to what they have put forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to changing this is to change mindsets, like water\r\n\r\non a stone.  We need, as a society and a polity, to be convinced\r\n\r\nof the utility of an active people sector, and be less afraid of\r\n\r\nits possible disutility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By \"utility\", I mean that an active people sector can\r\n\r\nproduce new ideas and initiatives, or refine existing ones; that\r\n\r\nit  can  act  as a genuine partner to state agencies;  and  that\r\n\r\nconsultation   and  participation  strengthen   legitimacy   and\r\n\r\nownership of actions taken to address problems.  I also see that\r\n\r\na people sector can cut across\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrace  and other differences to help widen our common ground  and\r\n\r\nhelp make us more of the Singaporean tribe.  There is a utility,\r\n\r\nin  this sense, in having a people sector in both the process as\r\n\r\nwell as the end product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By \"disutility\", I mean that we need to lessen our fear of\r\n\r\nchange  and of including new people in the way we make decisions\r\n\r\nand  of  getting things done; that we need to clarify and lessen\r\n\r\nthe  out of bound or \"OB\" markers of what people can say and do;\r\n\r\nand that while real national security concerns can and should be\r\n\r\nmet, we need not fear every shadow or every word or act.  To  do\r\n\r\nthis, to increase utility and lessen our fear of disutility,  we\r\n\r\nwill  require that the Government has a greater trust and  that,\r\n\r\nincreasingly, people understand the fragilities of  our  society\r\n\r\nand  will  act responsibly.  We will correspondingly  require  a\r\n\r\npeople who do, in fact, understand and act responsibly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our desired society is not one in which Government is\r\n\r\nstrong and people are weak.  Nor in calling for an active people\r\n\r\nsector,  is  it a desire to see Government weak and  the  people\r\n\r\nstrong.   The  two are not always and necessarily  in  conflict.\r\n\r\nOur  desired  society  lies in the growth of  an  active  people\r\n\r\nsector,  participating in community and national issues,  as  an\r\n\r\nindependent entity.  When I say \"independent\", I do not mean one\r\n\r\nthat is determined to oppose, nor do I mean one that is beholden\r\n\r\nto obey.  I mean, one that is free to agree and cooperate, or to\r\n\r\ndisagree and make counter arguments.  With such an independence,\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  see  that  the  two can come  together  and  truly\r\n\r\ncooperate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can read the S21 Report for yourselves, although some,\r\n\r\nnot  all,  have.  Fewer of you will have the time or inclination\r\n\r\nto  read the summary of deliberations of the subject committees.\r\n\r\nLet me just quote one section about our desired society, and the\r\n\r\nattempt   to  resolve  the  dilemma  between  consultation   and\r\n\r\nconsensus against decisiveness and quick action.  I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The [desired] society will be open to a diversity of\r\n\r\nideas.  The increased interaction between the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngovernment  and the people sector will deepen the  mutual  trust\r\n\r\nand facilitate the Government's decision-making.  With trust, it\r\n\r\nwill  be easier for the Government to act quickly and decisively\r\n\r\nunder imperative circumstances.  .  While consultation will  not\r\n\r\nalways lead to agreement or acceptance, it will lead to a better\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the constraints and problems faced by both  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the people sector.  . Underpinning  our  desired\r\n\r\nsociety  are 2 key factors.  First, the Government must be  open\r\n\r\nand  receptive  to ideas.  . Second, the people sector  must  be\r\n\r\nconstructive and responsible in its actions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In calling for an active people sector, the S21 Report does\r\n\r\nnot  assume  that  for the next century we can always  guarantee\r\n\r\ngood  government  and able leaders from the  PAP  or  any  other\r\n\r\nparty.  It does not assume that we always have a Mr Lee Kuan Yew\r\n\r\nor  Mr  Goh Chok Tong.  What the S21 Report does call for is  an\r\n\r\nequal place for active citizens.  Some years ago, I believe  the\r\n\r\nthen Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew considered the danger if the\r\n\r\nleadership of Singapore were all to perish on a single airplane,\r\n\r\nfor  that was the size of our leadership and establishment then.\r\n\r\nWho  would  run  Singapore,  he  rightly  asked  then.   He  was\r\n\r\nconcerned  that without this planeload of leaders,  our  country\r\n\r\nwould fail.  In 1997, the year in which he commissioned the  S21\r\n\r\nCommittee,  our  present Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok  Tong,  had\r\n\r\nasked us not to depend wholly on a small elite for all ideas and\r\n\r\ninitiatives.   If  a  government of the future  should  fail  or\r\n\r\nperish in that hypothetical airplane Senior Minister Lee alluded\r\n\r\nto, it will always be a loss to our country.  But if there is an\r\n\r\nactive, able and responsible people sector, it need not  be  our\r\n\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me close. We are used to imagining the global city of\r\n\r\nSingapore  in the future.  There are even sketches of  what  our\r\n\r\nfuture downtown in Marina Bay will look like.  The Singapore  21\r\n\r\nReport   does  not  focus  on  skyscrapers  and  infrastructure,\r\n\r\nhowever.  The S21 Report looks at the future in a different  but\r\n\r\ncomplementary  way.  In putting people at the  centre,  the  S21\r\n\r\nReport  seeks to describe the necessary qualities and principles\r\n\r\nthat  must  guide people who will live, work, and give  life  to\r\n\r\nthat city and our common future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, I believe there is a dose of realism, as Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Goh  has called for.  There is, I hope,  also  a  good\r\n\r\nmeasure  of  faith, idealism and vision, that  is,  \"heartware\".\r\n\r\nFor  it is this marriage between realism and such heartware that\r\n\r\ncan and must carry Singapore into the next century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,   I  would  like  to  speak  on   two   of   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  by  the Singapore 21 Committee.   First,  Every\r\n\r\nSingaporean   Matters,  and,  secondly,  Strong  Families:   Our\r\n\r\nFoundation and Our Future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on Every Singaporean Matters. It is recommended in\r\n\r\nthe  S21  report that on the personal side everyone should  make\r\n\r\nfull  use of his strong points and develop his potential to  the\r\n\r\nfullest.  On the society side we should respect the professional\r\n\r\nskills of the individuals, reward the successful ones, encourage\r\n\r\nthose  who are yet to succeed and give those who have  failed  a\r\n\r\nsecond  chance.  The Government should take the lead in changing\r\n\r\nthe  mindset of our people so that everyone would recognise  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  everybody has his or her own talent.  So long as  we\r\n\r\ndo our work well we can be outstanding talents in our respective\r\n\r\ntrades or industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, we must understand that success should\r\n\r\nnot  be  measured  only  in terms of economic  or  materialistic\r\n\r\nsuccess.   We  should also take into consideration  performances\r\n\r\nin  the  fields  of  culture, arts and  sports.   The  Committee\r\n\r\nrecognises that our human resource is very precious.   It  urges\r\n\r\neveryone to work hard and with the assistance of the society, we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to give full play to our potential and to develop\r\n\r\nour  talents  to  the fullest.  This is very important  for  our\r\n\r\ndevelopment in the 21st century.  As it was pointed out  by  the\r\n\r\nCommittee,  the  criteria of success are not only  in  terms  of\r\n\r\neconomic  and materialistic success.  In Singapore, most  people\r\n\r\nfeel  that  there  are  two avenues  to  success.   One  is  for\r\n\r\nindividuals to go to the top schools, get\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood  results, get a scholarship and a first class honours,  and\r\n\r\nthen  become  senior  officials in the Government  or  political\r\n\r\nleaders.   The  other  is  after  graduating,  either  from  the\r\n\r\nsecondary schools or from the university, they work hard in  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  world and then given the good opportunity they  strike\r\n\r\ngold, become very wealthy, make a lot of money, just like Mr Peh\r\n\r\nChin Hua.  He is a typical example of such success stories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, we have some entrepreneurs who have made\r\n\r\ntheir  fortune through technology and this is what we  call  the\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurs.  There are also some very outstanding performers\r\n\r\nin  the field of arts or culture, but it is just a flash in  the\r\n\r\npan.  They are not deemed to be \"success\" in the context of  our\r\n\r\nsociety.  There may be some very successful teachers, some  very\r\n\r\nsuccessful tailors, but they are hardly recognised as successful\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Although we give rewards to the best teachers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, how do we say which teacher is the most successful or\r\n\r\nwhich  journalist  is the most successful journalist,  or  which\r\n\r\ntailor is the best tailor?  Are we generally very respectful  of\r\n\r\nthem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 21st century we must expand the criteria of success\r\n\r\nto cover a larger area.  Of course, Singapore is a small country\r\n\r\nwith  a small population.  The market is small and there  are  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  restrictions.   If you write a  story  based  on  local\r\n\r\nscenes,  how many readers can you get?  If you produce  a  local\r\n\r\nfilm of strong local flavour, how many audience can you get?  If\r\n\r\nyou want to study nuclear physics, do we have enough facilities,\r\n\r\nand even after you have completed your studies, will your talent\r\n\r\nbe  put to optimum use in Singapore?  The Government should help\r\n\r\nthese  people  so  that they can develop  their  talent  to  the\r\n\r\nfullest and become a model of success.  So success should not be\r\n\r\nconfined  to only those who become senior officials or  big-time\r\n\r\nbusinessmen.   We should let Singaporeans develop their  talents\r\n\r\nin every field so that we can become a more vibrant country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have to make full use of our\r\n\r\ntalents and we must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  recognise  that  individual wisdom  and  capabilities  are\r\n\r\ndifferent from one another.  The Government should educate  them\r\n\r\naccording  to their abilities and make use of the various  types\r\n\r\nof  materials  to  mould  them into  successful  products.   Our\r\n\r\nprimary school streaming, technical stream or academic stream in\r\n\r\nthe secondary schools or the vocational training are examples of\r\n\r\nteaching according to the abilities of the students.  The wisdom\r\n\r\nor  capabilities  may be inborn.  We should  not  over-emphasise\r\n\r\ninborn  wisdom  so as not to discourage people from  wanting  to\r\n\r\nupgrade themselves.  We should emphasise acquired knowledge  and\r\n\r\ntraining and the positive effect of this acquired knowledge.  As\r\n\r\nit  is  said,  diligence  can compensate  for  the  slowness  in\r\n\r\nlearning.   In  any society, the highly intelligent  people  are\r\n\r\nalways  in  the minority.  To reform our society,  we  need  the\r\n\r\nefforts  of everyone.  Therefore, it is important that  we  must\r\n\r\nencourage  and  motivate  the majority  to  participate  in  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Singapore in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I like to talk about the family. The report has\r\n\r\nemphasised  on  the  importance of  family  ties.   The  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration should understand and look after the older people and\r\n\r\nthe Government and society should also help the older people  to\r\n\r\nadjust  to  the new environment so that they can enjoy  life  in\r\n\r\ntheir  autumn years.  The report has also mentioned that in  our\r\n\r\nsociety, family is the foundation for our future.  But in recent\r\n\r\nyears, we have noticed that the divorce rates have gone up  from\r\n\r\nyear to year.  In 1987, there were only 2,708 divorce cases.  In\r\n\r\n1997,  it  had increased to 4,888 cases, an increase  of  80.5%.\r\n\r\nThis  has  caused much misery and harm to the parties.   On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  there  are many young people who  have  reached  a\r\n\r\nmarriageable age but they are unable to find suitable  partners,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  ladies.  They are  unable  to  find  suitable\r\n\r\npartners  and  once they have grown out of the marriageable  age\r\n\r\nthey  will  have  to remain single for the rest of  their  life.\r\n\r\nThis  high  divorce rate and the fact that many people  are  not\r\n\r\ngetting married are very important problems that we have to look\r\n\r\ninto.  The report should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiscuss  how  the Government or society would educate  and  help\r\n\r\nthese  people  to resolve this matter.  Although  we  know  that\r\n\r\nthere is no easy solution to this issue, this problem has to  be\r\n\r\nresolved  one  way  or another.  We want the family  to  be  the\r\n\r\nfoundation  for  our future.  We must look into how  to  resolve\r\n\r\nthis  problem.  Then with other favourable factors, we would  be\r\n\r\nable to sustain our growth and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  yesterday the Prime Minister  mentioned  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech that Singapore was not a nation yet.  For a moment I  was\r\n\r\ntaken  by  surprise. Subsequently, after listening to  his  very\r\n\r\ncareful explanation, I realised that what the Prime Minister had\r\n\r\nsaid  was that Singapore is not a \"tribe\" nation yet.  The Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  wanted us to create a Singapore tribe.   He  described\r\n\r\nour  society  as a society which was formed by four  overlapping\r\n\r\ncircles, with each circle representing one racial community, and\r\n\r\nin  those areas where the circles do not overlap, the individual\r\n\r\ncommunity will develop on its own.  And where they overlap,  the\r\n\r\ncommunities would converge and  form a unified society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a multi-racial society we are able to live in harmony because\r\n\r\nwe  have mutual trust and understanding of one another.  We want\r\n\r\nto  build ourselves into a nation.  The Prime Minister's  speech\r\n\r\nis very meaningful.  Every Singaporean should study it in depth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I would like to speak on the relationship between the\r\n\r\npeople,  the public sector and the private sector.  We can  also\r\n\r\ndescribe  this  in  terms  of three circles.   These  are  three\r\n\r\ninterlinked circles and these circles represent the people,  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector  and the private sector.  The  question  is:  are\r\n\r\nthese  three  circles  of equal size and are  their  overlapping\r\n\r\nareas  big enough?  Over the last 18 months, we have discussions\r\n\r\nand  deliberations.  From the people's point of  view,  we  have\r\n\r\ndiscovered that some Singaporeans are still skeptical. They  are\r\n\r\nworried that there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  be a black hole or a black list in the Singapore  system.\r\n\r\nThey  feel  that  if  they  make some  good  suggestions,  these\r\n\r\nsuggestions  may still not be endorsed by the Government.   When\r\n\r\nthese  suggestions  are objectionable to  the  Government,  they\r\n\r\nwould  get into trouble with the authorities. Of course,  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  agree with such a view.  But it is worth noting that  there\r\n\r\nare in fact some Singaporeans who have such worries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Government's perspective, of course, to rule the\r\n\r\nnation, we will have to look at the macro interest and the long-term needs of the nation.  From the people's point of view, some\r\n\r\nsuggestions  may  be  driven by narrow  interest  or  individual\r\n\r\ninterest,  and  hence  not fully aligned with  the  Government's\r\n\r\nview.  As a result, when policies are announced, some people may\r\n\r\njust know a little bit about the Government's policy and do  not\r\n\r\nknow the full rationale of the policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there is no doubt that these three circles\r\n\r\nare  of different sizes.  The circle representing the Government\r\n\r\nis  the  biggest and the private sector is medium size,  whereas\r\n\r\nthe  circle representing the people is the smallest.  Of course,\r\n\r\nwe  want  to  create a Singapore tribe, we want to  enlarge  the\r\n\r\ncircle of the people and we want to enlarge the areas where they\r\n\r\nare  overlapping.   At the same time, we must also  enhance  the\r\n\r\nsense of belonging of the Singapore tribe.  On the one hand,  we\r\n\r\nmust let the two circles of the people and the private sector be\r\n\r\ngradually  enlarged so as to be the same size  as  that  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   On  the  other  hand,  we  want  to  enlarge   the\r\n\r\noverlapping areas of these three circles.  If we can succeed  in\r\n\r\nforging  consensus while maintaining diversity, then our  future\r\n\r\nwould be very bright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve this objective of seeking more\r\n\r\nidentity,  more consensus and less diversity, there  are  a  few\r\n\r\nthings  that  we  have to look into.  Let me  illustrate  by  an\r\n\r\nepisode of a conversation  between two people whom I shall  call\r\n\r\nthe \"Big Self\" and the \"Small Self\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Small Self would say, \"Well, I am very encouraged by\r\n\r\nthis  Singapore 21 Vision because it implies that in the future,\r\n\r\nmy  family, my community, the Government and the nation would be\r\n\r\nenhanced and they would attach more importance to me, to myself,\r\n\r\nmy  needs,  my achievements and my ideals.  Under the five  main\r\n\r\npillars  in  the  S21 vision, when I go to the  university,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will give me a scholarship and even send me  overseas\r\n\r\nfor  higher  education.  After studying,  if  I  have  a  better\r\n\r\nopportunity overseas, the Government will allow me to break  the\r\n\r\nbond and I can work overseas.  In order to enhance the Singapore\r\n\r\nHeartbeat,  the  Government  would  allow  me  to  have  a  dual\r\n\r\ncitizenship.   Then  the  Singapore citizenship  will  become  a\r\n\r\nguarantee, a security.  Next time, when I come back, my  family,\r\n\r\nmy  parents  will  look  after my children.   My  community,  my\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders  would  serve  me  and  improve  my   living\r\n\r\nenvironment.   So  it is \"Everybody for Me\"  and  that  is  very\r\n\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Big Self does not agree. He said, \"I am also very\r\n\r\nenlightened and encouraged by this S21 vision.  But  my  feeling\r\n\r\nis  different because the emphasis in these five main pillars is\r\n\r\nnot  only  just to enhance the Government's esteem of me.   But,\r\n\r\nmore  importantly, it is how I can devote more time and  efforts\r\n\r\nto  strengthen the family ties, and to better serve the country.\r\n\r\nOne  day, I saw a Singaporean running towards a bus stop.   When\r\n\r\nhe  was  about 20 metres from the bus stop, he saw that the  bus\r\n\r\nwas  about to drive off the bus bay. He waved to the bus  driver\r\n\r\nto  wait  for him.  The bus driver saw him running.  He  stopped\r\n\r\nthe  bus,  opened the door and let him board the bus.  But  this\r\n\r\nSingaporean, after boarding the bus, did not even take a look at\r\n\r\nthe  bus  driver.  He just bought the ticket and  sat  down.  On\r\n\r\nreaching  his destination, he alighted from the bus.  Just  like\r\n\r\nthat - not a word of thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed disheartening to see how these people behave.\r\n\r\nFor the Singaporean  scholarship holders, they are like this man\r\n\r\nwho  was running after the bus. When this scholarship- bus came,\r\n\r\nhe waved, stopped the bus, and got in.  Upon reaching his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndestination, he graduated, just walked down and broke the  bond,\r\n\r\nwith  not  even  a word of thanks.  His reasoning  is  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should help him to realise his dream.  I am  worried\r\n\r\nthat  there are Singaporeans of such mentality.  I am even  more\r\n\r\nworried  that there seems to be more and more such Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nFrom  the personal point of view, looking at the S21 Vision,  we\r\n\r\nshould  realise that, yes, I have a vision, I have an ideal.   I\r\n\r\nhope that the big environment of Singapore 21 would provide more\r\n\r\nopportunities for me to realise my dream.  But at the same time,\r\n\r\nI must also realise that every Singaporean has his or her ideal.\r\n\r\nSo  when I am striving towards realising my dream, I should also\r\n\r\nconsider  the  dreams  of  the other  Singaporeans.   We  should\r\n\r\nrespect others as well.  We cannot be too self-centred.  Looking\r\n\r\nfrom  the  society's point of view, I hope that we would  change\r\n\r\nthe way we assess the individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Peh Chin Hua said in Parliament that we\r\n\r\nshould  preserve the good traditional values.   His  speech  was\r\n\r\nvery  impressive.   But what worries me is that  the  next  day,\r\n\r\nthere was a photograph in the Straits Times showing Mr Peh  with\r\n\r\nhis  Porsche.  I am worried that our young people may just  look\r\n\r\nat  the  picture and do not read the wordings.  They  will  say,\r\n\r\n\"Oh,  Singapore 21 means one day I will be able  to  live  in  a\r\n\r\nbungalow  house,  and drive a Porsche, like Mr  Peh  Chin  Hua.\"\r\n\r\nThey  would  have neglected the main crux of Mr Peh  Chin  Hua's\r\n\r\nspeech. We have to take note that S21 does not want to assess  a\r\n\r\nperson's  success  by  his materialistic  success  because  this\r\n\r\nsuccess could well just be a nominal success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, I have been working with the trade\r\n\r\nunions.   In  my heart, I feel that the trade union leaders  and\r\n\r\ngrassroots leaders are truly working very hard for the  ordinary\r\n\r\ncitizens.   They take pains to show care and concern  for  these\r\n\r\npeople.  They are ordinary people but have extraordinary spirit.\r\n\r\nI  think  this  is  a real spirit.  This is an enriched  spirit.\r\n\r\nThese are the people whose success warrants our commendation  in\r\n\r\nthe  21st  century.   Of  course, everyone  has  his  own  will,\r\n\r\neveryone has his own ambition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery  one  of  us will pursue our ideals in our  own  way.   In\r\n\r\nwhatever trade or whatever industry we are in, we must  see  how\r\n\r\nwe  could  contribute to our society, and to contribute  to  our\r\n\r\nnation.  We should not always think of what people should do for\r\n\r\nme,  but  rather we should say, \"What  can I do for the people.\"\r\n\r\nWe  would  have derived that satisfaction.  The satisfaction  is\r\n\r\nnot just personal satisfaction, but a collective satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am using this episode between the Big Self and the Small\r\n\r\nSelf  to reflect my feelings.  To me, this S21 report may be one\r\n\r\nsame report, but because everyone of us has his own mindset, and\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have  different ideals, we would derive   different\r\n\r\ninspirations  from  this  S21.   If  we  are  to   reflect   our\r\n\r\ninspiration from this S21, from the view of the Small Self,  S21\r\n\r\ngives  better  lives to the individuals.  It is  like  everybody\r\n\r\nsleeping  on  the  same bed but each having his  own  individual\r\n\r\ndream.  Four million people having four million different ideas,\r\n\r\nand  each  goes  his  own way.  Yes, when times  are  good,  the\r\n\r\ncountry  can develop and prosper.  But, once there is a national\r\n\r\ncrisis, or we are hit by some calamities, we will not be able to\r\n\r\nstay united in one heart as a nation, and we will be wiped out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nation building is a long and winding road. There are\r\n\r\nbound  to be some bumpy patches here and there.  If we  want  to\r\n\r\ntackle   each  problem  as  it  comes  along,  and  face  danger\r\n\r\nfearlessly,  we must plan ahead even in peace time.  We have  to\r\n\r\nanticipate the occurrence of any crisis.  Our destiny is in  our\r\n\r\nhands.   To  me, it is a very important question of  whether  we\r\n\r\ncould  look  at  this  matter from  a  collective  view.    This\r\n\r\n\"heartware\" engineering of Singapore 21 is a long-term  project.\r\n\r\nWe  are only at the beginning stage.  We need a long process  of\r\n\r\ndeliberation to come to a consensus like the Big Self.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  one  day,  everyone  of us in Singapore  would  have  this\r\n\r\npassion  to  do his best to contribute all that he  can  and  to\r\n\r\nshine   on   others,  and  to  respect  the  values  of   fellow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Singaporean should, first of all, respect the\r\n\r\nparents, love the family and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontribute  towards society.  And I hope that every  Singaporean\r\n\r\nwould  have this fearless spirit to face the intense competition\r\n\r\nahead of us.  As we are evolving into a knowledge-based economy,\r\n\r\nwe  have  to courageously face the challenges ahead  of  us  and\r\n\r\nstrive  for  excellence.  We must use our talent as our  assets,\r\n\r\nour local talents as well as the foreign talents, to create more\r\n\r\njob  opportunities, more foreign investments so  that  Singapore\r\n\r\ncan become a society where everyone would have an opportunity to\r\n\r\npursue  his  dream.   I  hope that every Singaporean  will  have\r\n\r\nloyalty  towards our nation, to be proud of our  nation  and  to\r\n\r\ncreate the Singapore tribe as described by our Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, I hope that everyone would have this notion in\r\n\r\nmind  that everyone has a responsibility in the destiny  of  the\r\n\r\nsociety.   Everyone should lead by example.  We should take  the\r\n\r\nlead  and  work  for the good of our nation.  The direction  has\r\n\r\nbeen set in our Singapore 21 Vision. In this process of building\r\n\r\nan  ideal  society, there may be times when we are going  uphill\r\n\r\nand sometimes, we may be moving downhill.  Whatever it is, if we\r\n\r\nare not careful and adopt the mindset of the Small Self,  we may\r\n\r\nroll  down  the slope.  But if everyone of us can look  at  this\r\n\r\nSingapore 21 in the spirit of the Big Self, I believe we can all\r\n\r\nmove  uphill  and scale greater heights.  With the  stage  being\r\n\r\nenlarged by this Singapore 21 for our nation building, the three\r\n\r\nsectors  - the public, private and the people sectors  -  should\r\n\r\neach  play  its  own  role,  respect one  another,  support  one\r\n\r\nanother,  and be dependent on one another to turn the  dream  of\r\n\r\nthis Singapore 21 Vision into reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, hon. Members may wonder why my name is listed  as\r\n\r\nNo. 7 to speak on this motion today and I am now speaking as No.\r\n\r\n16.   The reason is very simple.  Just now, Dr Michael Lim  told\r\n\r\nme  that  he  had  some important matters to attend  to,  as   a\r\n\r\npatient was waiting for him at the hospital.  I felt that saving\r\n\r\nlife is very important. Mutual help and mutual\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nco-operation are equally important.  I believe this is  part  of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore 21 spirit.  That was why I agree to swap with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, today is the 6th of May. There are\r\n\r\nonly another 238 days more to the Year 2000.  In a short span of\r\n\r\njust  a  few  months' time, we will be stepping  into  the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury.  But  when we look at our neighbours, they  are  having\r\n\r\nsocial unrest, political conflicts, revolutions and disturbances\r\n\r\nresulting in a very uncertain situation.  But in Singapore,  our\r\n\r\nGovernment has used this regional financial crisis to  test  our\r\n\r\npeople.   By presenting this Singapore 21 vision, it  paves  the\r\n\r\nway  for us to march into the 21st century in a higher  key.   I\r\n\r\nfeel  that this is something which all Singaporeans should  take\r\n\r\npride in.  I would like to commend the Committee led by RAdm Teo\r\n\r\nfor  successfully bringing us this creative concept of  the  S21\r\n\r\nvision  and  to lead Singapore into a better and more prosperous\r\n\r\nsociety in the 21st century.  As such,  I support this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it has often been said, everyone has a role to play in\r\n\r\nthe  survival  of our country.  When the country is  prosperous,\r\n\r\nall  its  citizens  are happy and proud.  But when  the  country\r\n\r\nmeets  with  difficulties, everyone should hold up  his  or  her\r\n\r\nresponsibility to defend the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours is an enlightened society. Our policy is transparent.\r\n\r\nOur  Government is  concerned with the well-being of our people,\r\n\r\nand  it  attaches great importance to the views of  the  people.\r\n\r\nThe  setting  up  of the Feedback Unit  is a good  example.   In\r\n\r\norder  to implement policies which are beneficial to our people,\r\n\r\nand  to  build up consensus through consultation, our  Ministers\r\n\r\nhave been visiting the constituencies regularly to have dialogue\r\n\r\nsessions with the people and to find out first-hand the problems\r\n\r\nof  our  people.  We have also the Feedback Unit to collect  and\r\n\r\ncollate  feedback and views from our people.  In the past,  when\r\n\r\nthe   Government  departments  wanted  to  implement  some   new\r\n\r\npolicies, they would just carry on with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimplementation without consultation with the people.  This  kind\r\n\r\nof  \"do  first  talk  later\" attitude  had  incurred  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ndispleasure and dissatisfaction among the people.  But  now,  it\r\n\r\nis  different.  With this consultation with the people, a lot of\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding can be cleared and problems resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you a few examples. First, the \"Sale of\r\n\r\nTenanted  Shops\"  scheme.   In the early days,  all  the  leases\r\n\r\nissued by HDB were for 99 years. Recent changes in policy   have\r\n\r\nresulted  in  a recommendation to reduce them to 30-year  leases\r\n\r\ninstead.  But before this policy was implemented, the matter was\r\n\r\nreferred  to the Feedback Unit to find out the response  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.   I personally convened and chaired a number of dialogue\r\n\r\nsessions  with  the shop owners to hear their  views.  The  shop\r\n\r\nowners were happy that they had a chance to voice their views on\r\n\r\nthe  matter.   In the process of these dialogue sessions,  there\r\n\r\nwere  some heated but very meaningful discussions.  In  the end,\r\n\r\nwe  presented  the  recommendations of the  discussions  to  our\r\n\r\nMinister  for  National Development, Mr Lim Hng  Kiang  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  accepted the recommendations  of  these  dialogue\r\n\r\nsessions conducted by the Feedback Unit.  The concept of  a  30-year  lease  for  the sale of shophouses was announced  and  the\r\n\r\nresponse  was  very good.  At the moment, many  shopholders  are\r\n\r\nrequesting that the Minister for National Development sell  more\r\n\r\nshop  premises  to  them.  So we can see that  if  a  policy  is\r\n\r\nimplemented  after  consultation with the  people  concerned  it\r\n\r\nwould be strongly supported by the people and will receive  very\r\n\r\nfavourable response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the carpark for heavy vehicles. Many\r\n\r\ndrivers of heavy vehicles informed me that it was very difficult\r\n\r\nfor them to find parking lots for their heavy vehicles.  When we\r\n\r\npresented  these views to the relevant authorities,  the  answer\r\n\r\nwas that the available parking lots were more than the number of\r\n\r\nheavy vehicles.  So it was not a problem.  But from the feedback\r\n\r\ngiven  by the drivers, we understood that they were still having\r\n\r\na  lot of problems parking their heavy vehicles.  I invited  all\r\n\r\nthe heavy-vehicle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrivers  to  take part in our dialogue sessions.   I  discovered\r\n\r\nthat although there were enough parking lots, many of these lots\r\n\r\nwere  situated at some far away and remote places, such as   the\r\n\r\nindustrial park in Tuas or some isolated areas in Woodlands, and\r\n\r\nthese  drivers had difficulty going to the carparks in the early\r\n\r\nmorning  because there was no public transport to  go  there  to\r\n\r\npick up their vehicles.  We conveyed these views to the Minister\r\n\r\nand  we  are indeed very grateful to Minister Lim Hng Kiang  who\r\n\r\ngraciously  directed that more car parks for heavy  vehicles  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  near  the  housing estates.  To a  certain  extent,  this\r\n\r\nproblem is resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these two important examples, it clearly illustrates\r\n\r\nthat  consultations and discussions before implementation  of  a\r\n\r\npolicy  are  of utmost importance. I believe in the  process  of\r\n\r\nimplementing the cost-saving measures, the Government  has  also\r\n\r\nconducted various dialogue sessions with the businessmen,  NTUC,\r\n\r\ntrade  unions,  and grassroots leaders. As a  result,  when  the\r\n\r\nmeasures were implemented, they received strong support  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, and the implementation was smooth and successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore 21 Vision Committee has reached out to some\r\n\r\n6,000  people.  This has once again emphasised the  Government's\r\n\r\nesteem of the views of our people.  Our airport is No. 1 in  the\r\n\r\nworld, our port is first-class, our workers' quality is also No.\r\n\r\n1  in  the world.  Singapore is a small island nation.  We  have\r\n\r\nthis  achievement which every Singaporean can be proud  of.   We\r\n\r\nhave  so  many \"No. 1\" honours in our bag.  This is because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment listens to the people, and the people are  given  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of clear and transparent explanations  of the  policies\r\n\r\nby  the Government  before they are implemented.  We are all  in\r\n\r\none heart.  We work together and the Government has placed great\r\n\r\nesteem  on  the  views of the people.  Unfortunately,  there  is\r\n\r\nstill a small group of people, because of personal grudges,  who\r\n\r\nhave  raised  some arguments which could incite the  people  and\r\n\r\ngive rise to unnecessary misunderstanding.  That is regrettable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you a few examples. When we first implemented\r\n\r\nthis COE system, a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndialogue  session was conducted.  I was present at this dialogue\r\n\r\nsession.  The arguments for and against the concept was  debated\r\n\r\nfuriously  and rigorously at the session.  It was a very  heated\r\n\r\nargument  indeed.  In fact, the argument was so heated  that  an\r\n\r\nenvironment was created where  some unnecessary misunderstanding\r\n\r\nwas generated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second example was recently, in my constituency, when\r\n\r\nwe  announced this Selective En-Bloc Redevelopment  scheme,  the\r\n\r\nmain  purpose  was  to  resolve the  transport  problem  because\r\n\r\nHillview  Avenue is a place where we do not have  enough  public\r\n\r\ntransportation and many residents have approached me  and  asked\r\n\r\nme  to  request  for this en-bloc redevelopment.   According  to\r\n\r\nsurveys,  more  than 90% of the residents supported  this  view.\r\n\r\nBut there was a small minority of people who objected to it, and\r\n\r\none of them asked me in the dialogue session, \"What good is this\r\n\r\npolicy?   What good is this new development plan?\"  I  told  him\r\n\r\none of the important advantages is that the new development site\r\n\r\nis  very  near to the MRT.  He said, \"I do not need an MRT.\"   I\r\n\r\nasked  him  why.  He said, \"I have a car.  I do not  need  MRT.\"\r\n\r\nThe other residents who were present shook their heads.  I said,\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is good that you have a car.  It is good for you.  But\r\n\r\n80%  of  the  residents  do  not own  cars.   They  need  public\r\n\r\ntransportation.   MRT  is  a  very  effective  means  of  public\r\n\r\ntransportation.\"   We  can  see  from  this  example  that  this\r\n\r\nresident was only concerned with his own personal interest.   He\r\n\r\nlooked at the matter purely from his own personal point of view.\r\n\r\nOne thing I was very happy was that when his wife heard what  he\r\n\r\nsaid, she gave him a pinch and asked him not to pursue the line.\r\n\r\nI can see that when the Government implements this policy, it is\r\n\r\nfor the advantage of the majority of the residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another example, as we all know about two years ago, Ang\r\n\r\nMo  Kio  had  a Main Upgrading Programme and there was  a  small\r\n\r\ngroup of people, because of some personal problems, who objected\r\n\r\nto the upgrading.  Even yesterday, I was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiscussing  with DPM Lee on this matter.  Results of the  voting\r\n\r\nfor   MUP showed that in one of the blocks, less than 75% of the\r\n\r\nresidents supported the programme. As a result, when the MUP was\r\n\r\ncarried  out,  this  block  could not  be  upgraded.   When  the\r\n\r\naffected residents came to know about it, they hurriedly went to\r\n\r\nDPM  Lee  and  asked whether they could have  another  round  of\r\n\r\nvoting.  DPM told them, \"No, you have only one chance to  vote.\"\r\n\r\nWhen  you  look  at  this  whole thing,  you  should  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration the benefits of the majority and not just your own\r\n\r\npersonal interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said yesterday that ours is a multi-racial society, and we had to exercise mutual tolerance and\r\n\r\nunderstanding among ourselves.  If anyone is to raise some  very\r\n\r\nsensitive  issues, such as religious or racial  issues,  chances\r\n\r\nare  that  they  will give rise to disputes and misunderstanding\r\n\r\nwhich  will  result  in great harm being  done  to  our  nation.\r\n\r\nEveryone of us should look at national interest first.  The  two\r\n\r\nChinese  characters for nation or country are:  \"Guo  and  Jia\".\r\n\r\nGuo  is  nation, Jia is family.  Nation first,  then family.  We\r\n\r\nmust  first  have the nation before we can have the family.   We\r\n\r\nmust bear this basic principle in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the whole world, there are wars, famine and\r\n\r\npoverty  everywhere.   When we look at  our  region,  there  are\r\n\r\nunrests  and troubles.  But take a look at Singapore.   We  have\r\n\r\npolitical  stability and a strong economy. Our people  live  and\r\n\r\nwork  in  peace and contentment. This proves that all  the  past\r\n\r\nefforts of the Government are not in vain. The concerted efforts\r\n\r\nof the people and the Government have reaped great rewards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the support from the people, we have become a\r\n\r\nprosperous country. According to statistics kept by the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation,  we  have presently 26,026 grassroots  leaders  who\r\n\r\nhave   created  and  contributed  much  to  our  nation.   These\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders  work  very  hard.   They  sacrifice   their\r\n\r\nprecious  time and money to work for the benefit of  the  nation\r\n\r\nand  the  people.   We should also not forget the  10,000-20,000\r\n\r\nvoluntary  welfare officers who, out of love  for  their  fellow\r\n\r\ncitizens,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  contributed much to society without asking for any reward.\r\n\r\nI think we should give due respect to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the selfless spirit of these grassroots leaders\r\n\r\nand  voluntary welfare officers should be given due commendation\r\n\r\nand the value of their services should be recognised.   Although\r\n\r\nwe  have now more than 30,000 community leaders, this represents\r\n\r\nonly  1%  of  our population.  We hope that there will  be  more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans coming forward to volunteer their services  to  the\r\n\r\nnation.  I  suggest  that  the Government  issue  \"Good  Citizen\r\n\r\nAwards\"   to  these  people, albeit  they are  just  1%  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation.  But I feel that these good citizens could  be  role\r\n\r\nmodels  for others to emulate.  We should encourage more  people\r\n\r\nto come forward and do even more for our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another 238 days, we will be going into the 21st\r\n\r\ncentury.   I hope that the Government will take this opportunity\r\n\r\nto   issue  2,000  \"Good  Citizen  Awards\"  to  those  who  have\r\n\r\ncontributed much to our society, and to encourage more people to\r\n\r\ntake  part.   Gradually, we can have more and more awards  being\r\n\r\nissued.   Our  cohesion  will be enhanced,  and  then  an  ideal\r\n\r\nSingapore  and an ideal home in the 21st century will be  within\r\n\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we hope that the people and the Government could\r\n\r\nput  in  a  concerted effort to develop Singapore  into  a  more\r\n\r\nprosperous and more progressive country.  Finally, I  wish  that\r\n\r\neveryone  in  Singapore  would love his  country  and  love  his\r\n\r\nfamily.   I hope that the Singapore 21 vision could be  realised\r\n\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to support the Singapore 21 Report.  I think it is a  good\r\n\r\nReport and we should all support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went through the Report and I was quite impressed. I\r\n\r\ncame to page 54 and there was this short paragraph.  I will read\r\n\r\nit out:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Fourthly, there should be an attempt to spell out the \"out-of-bound markers\" in more precise and transparent terms. When\r\n\r\nthese \"OB\" markers are clearer,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  can  be encouraged to take a more active part  in  civic\r\n\r\nlife,  knowing that there is less danger of straying  into  them\r\n\r\nunwittingly.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Committee has asked the Government to spell out these\r\n\r\nout-of-bound  markers.  It is not specific.  The  Committee  did\r\n\r\nnot  specify any particular field where Singaporeans should  not\r\n\r\ndwell  too  deeply into.  When I read this, I  was  thinking  of\r\n\r\nareas like race and religion, but I am not so sure.  That is why\r\n\r\nI want the Minister to clarify this point later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, the fact that this has been asked means that young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans want guidance, clear boundaries, so that  they  can\r\n\r\nthink  and act within set rules, and they will not think  beyond\r\n\r\npre-set  boundaries.  Do young Singaporeans want this,  I  asked\r\n\r\nmyself,  to be told what they can say and what they cannot  say?\r\n\r\nCan  this  be  the  basis  for creative  minds  to  flourish  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?  Can we have meaningful discussion and thinking?  Why\r\n\r\ndo  people  need OB markers before participating in debates  and\r\n\r\ndiscussion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read this, I was drawn back to the discussion I had\r\n\r\nearlier on in this House when I asked for the toning down of the\r\n\r\ncall  on  foreign talent in this economic crisis.  I,  who  have\r\n\r\nstood  in this House with a record of nearly 19 years of  public\r\n\r\nservice, was labelled by a Minister to be doing a disservice  to\r\n\r\nmy  country  for  bringing  up this  subject  in  this  Chamber.\r\n\r\nCalling  for  toning  down a message is a  disservice,  I  asked\r\n\r\nmyself?  Then how can an ordinary Singaporean stand up to  raise\r\n\r\nissues  when  such  treatment was meted out to  a  long-standing\r\n\r\nfellow MP?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no wonder that the Committee has asked for OB\r\n\r\nmarkers,  so  as  not  to \"stray into them  unwittingly\".   That\r\n\r\nrequest for clear guidelines or OB markers could reflect a  lack\r\n\r\nof  confidence  people  have  in their  judgment  and  in  their\r\n\r\nthinking.  I just want the Minister to enlighten this  House  on\r\n\r\nwhy this recommendation was put into Singapore 21, as I feel  it\r\n\r\nis contrary to openness and creativity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to the discussion on foreign talent very\r\n\r\ncarefully, because I started it in this House, and now I am less\r\n\r\nclear about\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  term  \"foreign talent\".  It would seem that we are throwing\r\n\r\nthe  net  very  wide,  to  include people  like  SIA  girls  and\r\n\r\nhairdressers.   To  me, there is a difference between  need  and\r\n\r\ntalent.  I think it is corporate wisdom to employ Japanese girls\r\n\r\nto be SIA stewardesses to serve the Japanese sector.  That is  a\r\n\r\nneed  and  we  should encourage that.  It is also good  that  we\r\n\r\nshould employ European girls to man the European sector and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, Indian girls to man the Indian sector.  But that is  not\r\n\r\ntalent.   To  me, it is a need.  Therefore, I want to  be  clear\r\n\r\nnow.   Later,  I hope the Minister or someone can tell  me  what\r\n\r\n\"foreign talent\" really stands for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand if we get an international figure like Mr\r\n\r\nOlds  to  look  after  DBS  Bank.  He  is  well  known.   He  is\r\n\r\nknowledgeable.   We  all  accept it and  most  Singaporeans  too\r\n\r\naccept  it.  It seems that if you talk to Singaporeans  and  say\r\n\r\nthat foreigners are now talented people, they would say that  we\r\n\r\nsurely must have local talents too.  We must give Singaporeans a\r\n\r\nsense  of  pride  being Singaporeans.  If not, this  S21  Report\r\n\r\ncarries  no meaning.  We want Singaporeans to stand tall.   Yet,\r\n\r\nwe  give  too much praise on foreigners.  We have good  bankers,\r\n\r\ngood  business  leaders, administrators and they  must  be  very\r\n\r\ngood,  or else Singapore cannot be what we are today.  We rarely\r\n\r\nsingle  out  such  people for recognition.   We  take  them  for\r\n\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure we must have many Singaporeans who will be good\r\n\r\nrole models for younger Singaporeans, and we should highlight\r\n\r\nthese people who have made good in their respective fields.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tommy Koh, for example, Fock Siew Wah and even Philip\r\n\r\nYeo.  I criticised him but I respect that man, because I think\r\n\r\nhe has good talent.  He has got vision.  He can go round the\r\n\r\nworld and scout for good and appropriate industries to come to\r\n\r\nthis country, so that they can set up factories here and give\r\n\r\njobs to our people.  That is talent.  So we should, in fact, pay\r\n\r\na little bit more emphasis to our local talent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give another example. We always cite Christopher\r\n\r\nTan as a foreign talent,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  I  think  he is a local talent.  I know him.   We  went  to\r\n\r\nschool together.  We went to university together.  We stayed  in\r\n\r\nthe  same  college.   He  took  up biochemistry.   But  he  left\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  he went to Calgary and made  a  good  name  for\r\n\r\nhimself.   He stayed there and he established a good  name.   We\r\n\r\nare  proud of him and we brought him over.  But now we call  him\r\n\r\nforeign talent.  Maybe he has not changed his citizenship.   But\r\n\r\nthese are our own local talent, and we should be proud of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Singaporeans deserve a clearer definition of\r\n\r\n\"foreign  talent\".  Who are these talented  people?   I  am  not\r\n\r\nagainst foreign talent.  I want it to be very clear.  But I want\r\n\r\nus in this House to let Singaporeans know who are these talented\r\n\r\npeople.   Have we, for example, any figures to show Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthat the number of such talented foreigners working here is  not\r\n\r\na threat to them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all I want to say, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.41 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Senior Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nfirst, let me congratulate the members of the Committee and  its\r\n\r\nChairman for having spent so much time and effort to crystallise\r\n\r\n6,000-odd views into a few pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discussions in this House, which I have read and\r\n\r\nsometimes  listened to, give hope that what we  started  umpteen\r\n\r\nyears  ago  is being pushed forward.  No society is static.   No\r\n\r\nsociety  remains,  either going up or going down.   We  did  the\r\n\r\neasier   part,   getting  raw,  basic  clashes  to   be   muted,\r\n\r\ndistributing the population into mixed housing estates,  sending\r\n\r\nthem to the same schools, preventing them from segregating.   It\r\n\r\nwill take much more to get them to finally accept each other and\r\n\r\nbegin to trust each other.  And it takes just one mishap and you\r\n\r\nwill  find  segregation begins all over again.  Only  those  who\r\n\r\nhave  seen in raw life what happens to people when they clash  - and  your  uniform is your face, your shape, your  appearance  - will understand what primeval hate is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have a stable, quiet, relatively placid situation.\r\n\r\nAnd  on  this, we build.  I have seen societies of a  very  high\r\n\r\nstandard go down in its civility.  The Britain I went to in  the\r\n\r\n1940s,  after  seven years of war - 1939 to 1945 -  was  a  very\r\n\r\ncivil  society,  which  I  admired greatly.   Now,  bombs,  lone\r\n\r\nbomber, IRA bombs, football hooligans.  What went wrong?   I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know.   Immigrants?  Travel? Foreign influence?   TV?   But\r\n\r\nsomething has been lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen the Japanese as conquerors and I saw them\r\n\r\nrehabilitate  and re-establish themselves.  I  could  not  help,\r\n\r\nreluctantly, but admire their sterling qualities as a nation, as\r\n\r\na  race,  the Yamato race.  And they have all the advantages  of\r\n\r\nhomogeneity, solidarity and total commitment to each other.  But\r\n\r\neven  they  now,  under  the impact of  globalisation,  open  to\r\n\r\nforeign  influences, are faced with heart-wrenching problems  of\r\n\r\nboth their economic restructuring which will alter the nature of\r\n\r\ntheir  society  and life-time employment, and also  the  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich  they  interact  with the world.  Japan  now  has  over  a\r\n\r\nmillion  families  working abroad.  How do  they  re-absorb  the\r\n\r\nchildren of these engineers, executives, managers who have  been\r\n\r\neducated  in Japanese schools but exposed to foreign influences?\r\n\r\nI  know  of Japanese diplomats who have travelled all  over  the\r\n\r\nworld  with their families, and their children have been  unable\r\n\r\nto  fit  in,  and  have  settled in Los Angeles  or  London,  or\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  They are faced with very serious problems of change,\r\n\r\nand so are we.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past is valuable in telling us how we got here, and\r\n\r\nhaving  us  understand what are our perils, what are  our  fault\r\n\r\nlines, and do not mistake them.  They are not going to disappear\r\n\r\nin  20,  30,  40 years.  But if we are aware of it, it  is  like\r\n\r\nliving  with an earthquake fault.  We can build buildings  which\r\n\r\nmay be able to stand the shocks.  That is my hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disappointed with the Opposition, particularly Mr\r\n\r\nChiam.    It  is  Singapore's  culture  that  if  you  are   the\r\n\r\nOpposition,  you  oppose.  And he is unable  to  see,  good  man\r\n\r\nthough he is in many ways, that this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis a basic issue of the future of our society.  He says it is  a\r\n\r\nPR  effort.   Enormous amount of energy, work went into  it!   I\r\n\r\nread  the  Committee's  deliberations or summaries  of  it,  and\r\n\r\ncongratulated and encouraged the Minister for Education.  It  is\r\n\r\nin  the right direction.  But it is not easy, and it will not be\r\n\r\naccomplished  in one generation.  Some of the things  that  some\r\n\r\nMembers  have  spoken of may not be achieved in 20  generations.\r\n\r\nYou  can have cultural change and acculturation.  But to have  a\r\n\r\nDNA change, to have it into one melange, that is not easy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will we become one tribe? Not possible. If we try, we\r\n\r\nwill  bring  misfortune to ourselves.  Because there are  tribal\r\n\r\nelements  in  our society that say: I want to  be  myself.   The\r\n\r\nSikhs  do  not  want to be absorbed.  The various  Muslim  sects\r\n\r\nthemselves do not want to be absorbed by other sects, let  alone\r\n\r\nby  other religions.  And I say, leave well alone, let  us  find\r\n\r\ncommon  ground, because those are the cards that we  were  dealt\r\n\r\nwith.  So much easier if we are all one race, one language,  one\r\n\r\nreligion.   And that was Jafaar Albar's cry when  he  wanted  to\r\n\r\nbeat  us  down:  Satu  bangsa, satu bahasa,  satu  ugama.   That\r\n\r\nexcludes me, of course, and excludes a lot of other people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, having gone through that stress, we came to the\r\n\r\nconclusion  that  we have to be the opposite, tolerant  of  each\r\n\r\nother,   accommodative,   multi-racial,  multi-lingual,   multi-religious,  multi-cultural.  In other words, I am  not  foisting\r\n\r\nmyself  on you.  But we face severe challenges.  What  has  gone\r\n\r\nbefore cannot be extrapolated easily into the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last eight and a half years since I resigned as\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister,  I  have  had the advantage  of  time  and  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to attend meetings with top bankers, top  executives\r\n\r\nin  different parts of the world, and I have concluded that  our\r\n\r\nprevious aspiration of becoming the centre for Southeast Asia is\r\n\r\ninadequate, because this is a global stage, whether you like  it\r\n\r\nor not.  Therefore, to play in this global market, you must have\r\n\r\ntalent of a global standard.  Perhaps more time should be  spent\r\n\r\nto get this message across.  Maybe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Member for Ayer Rajah would better understand.  Yes, we have\r\n\r\ngood  bankers.   But  he  is  wrong, if  he  believes  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore banks are thriving because they are wonderful bankers.\r\n\r\nBecause  I  protected them with Koh Beng Seng.  I prevented  the\r\n\r\nforeign banks from opening branches and having ATMs, and allowed\r\n\r\nSingapore   banks  to  place  their  ATMs  and  their   branches\r\n\r\nthroughout  all the HDB estates, and they grew.   And  now  they\r\n\r\nhave  become important financial international institutions  for\r\n\r\nus.   But  if they continue to play in that league, we  will  be\r\n\r\nwiped  out.  Why do I say that?  Because of the speed with which\r\n\r\ntechnology is going.  Because I have been exposed as a member of\r\n\r\nan  international advisory board of a big American bank, I  have\r\n\r\nseen  the speed at which they themselves are changing, and  they\r\n\r\nare  spreading throughout the world.  And we cannot  stop  them.\r\n\r\nWe can continue with this protectionism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave away productivity prize at Suntec City to some 30,\r\n\r\n40  people.  One of them was a Citibank man, and Citibank is one\r\n\r\nof  the  best retail banks in the world.  So I asked him,  after\r\n\r\nthe  ceremony,  \"When we liberalise, what do  you  expect?\"   He\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"I  will  treble my customer base.\"  I said,  \"Why?\"   He\r\n\r\nsaid, \"I have got international products.\"  Banking is no longer\r\n\r\njust  taking  in  your  deposits and  then  lending  it  out  on\r\n\r\nmortgages.  As a society matures, people earn enough to begin to\r\n\r\nwant  to  make  sure that their money is put to good  use,  will\r\n\r\nmultiply, and in their retirement, they have a comfortable  nest\r\n\r\negg.   So banks offer this.  A good bank has got a whole panoply\r\n\r\nof  products.   What  is it you want?  Children's  education,  I\r\n\r\noffer  you  this;  your  old age, offer  you  that.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nCitibank   combined  with  Travellers.   Why?   Travellers   has\r\n\r\ndeveloped in America the most extensive network of customers  to\r\n\r\nwhom  they  offer  the widest panoply of products  -  insurance,\r\n\r\nanything  you want, mutual funds, the lot.  But it has  not  got\r\n\r\nthe  international reach to customers world-wide.  Citibank  has\r\n\r\nthat.   They  came together.  And once they have  settled  their\r\n\r\ninternal problem of two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanagements coming together, all those super-products which  our\r\n\r\nbanks  cannot think of, but which Travellers has already  worked\r\n\r\nout,  and are all in computers, they will go worldwide, and  you\r\n\r\nare wiped out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citibank does not want branches any more. With an educated\r\n\r\npopulation, you only need an ATM.  And in time, you do not  even\r\n\r\nneed  any ATM.  You can do Internet banking.  You need  the  ATM\r\n\r\nonly for drawing out cash.  And once you have the cashcard,  you\r\n\r\ndo not need the ATM.  You put your cashcard, your smartcard into\r\n\r\nyour  computer, and you draw and you top up, or you pay in.   So\r\n\r\nwhere is the ability of the Singapore Government to protect  our\r\n\r\nfour big banks?  It will be gone in 10 years or less.  So unless\r\n\r\nwe  move  forward,  and  fast, we are wiped  out.   We  will  be\r\n\r\nmarginalised,  and  marginal players in our own  domestic  base.\r\n\r\nAnd  it is a very dangerous position to be in.  We will be  like\r\n\r\nNew Zealand.  They have been wiped out.  There is no New Zealand-owned bank that can back the New Zealand economy if it runs into\r\n\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken to the bankers for the last six, seven years\r\n\r\nto move, but they have run in the same old way, too comfortable,\r\n\r\nplease  give  us more time.  And they did nothing in  that  time\r\n\r\nuntil we decided to move and we said, \"Right, we will move.  DBS\r\n\r\nand  POSBank  with  the  top  management  will  take  over  your\r\n\r\nbusiness.\"   That forced OCBC to start looking, to  upgrade  its\r\n\r\nmanagement.   It  wanted  a  Chinese because  it  thinks  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  that  the Chinese culture in the  bank  must  not  be\r\n\r\nupset;  hunted and found Mr Alex Au, who made Hang Seng  Bank  a\r\n\r\nsuccess  in  Hong  Kong, and was taken by StanChart  in  London.\r\n\r\nThey brought him back here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is more than one man. Neither Alex Au nor Mr John\r\n\r\nOlds  can  succeed unless they find a team to inject into  every\r\n\r\ndepartment the level of expertise that we will require  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  competition.  Ten years ago, if you had asked me,  I  would\r\n\r\nsay  we were doing not badly in banking.  Now I am convinced  we\r\n\r\nare  headed  down the hill.  And this is an enormous opportunity\r\n\r\nfor  us.   We  are one of the few countries, besides Hong  Kong,\r\n\r\nwhere our banks are standing up.  We have got the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncredibility;  we have the resources.  This is the  time  we  can\r\n\r\nupgrade  ourselves  and  form partnerships  with  banks  in  the\r\n\r\nregion, upgrade them, inject capital, inject expertise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just in banking. I could go on ad infinitum,\r\n\r\nbecause I spend much time on it.  The same globalisation process\r\n\r\nis  forcing  SIA and NOL to compete worldwide.   You  can  be  a\r\n\r\nbeautiful regional airline.  You will be marginalised.   Because\r\n\r\nthe  customer wants to go to odd places that SIA does not go to.\r\n\r\nI  want  to go to Buenos Aires, Santiago.  The American airlines\r\n\r\nare  going global.  The Europeans have seen the light  and  they\r\n\r\nhave  decided  they must have a few airlines  that  can  compete\r\n\r\nglobally.  So they have lifted their restrictions within  Europe\r\n\r\nand  allowed  free competition, so that in the next  few  years,\r\n\r\ntwo,  three or maybe more airlines will emerge who can then take\r\n\r\non the Americans and go global.  Then wherever you are stranded,\r\n\r\nSeoul,  Nairobi,  Lagos, you just go to the  airline,  whichever\r\n\r\nairline, and say, \"Here is my ticket.  I want out.\"  We have not\r\n\r\ngot  the critical mass to go global.  So we have to team up  and\r\n\r\ngo  global  in a relay team.  So SIA, like it or not,  teams  up\r\n\r\nwith  Air  New Zealand, Ansett.  Coach-sharing alone with  Delta\r\n\r\nAirlines  and  Swissair  does  not  work.   It  is  going   with\r\n\r\nLufthansa.   It  has got to go into some other network  so  that\r\n\r\nwhen  you  book  into an SIA ticket, stranded  anywhere  in  the\r\n\r\nworld, there is this relay that will take you out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to be a global player. That means your management\r\n\r\nmust  be  global,  of  that  standard.   Same  with  NOL.    NOL\r\n\r\nunfortunately  bought into APL, just before  the  market  turned\r\n\r\ndown.   But if you want to be in that industry, you got to cover\r\n\r\nall the Pacific Basin ports.  So it is in trouble and Temasek is\r\n\r\nthe  biggest shareholder.  Temasek decided to look for the  best\r\n\r\nChief Executive, shortlisted them and decided on a Dane who  ran\r\n\r\nMaersk, one of the top shipping container lines.  It is the only\r\n\r\nway we go.  Either we go that way or we are marginalised and our\r\n\r\nhorizon shrinks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we come to the total talent. Why do I bring up\r\n\r\nunmarried graduate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmothers?   Because the talent pool cannot expand or even  retain\r\n\r\nits present size if you take out of that pool your best mothers.\r\n\r\nIt is as simple as that.  And the impact is being felt.  We talk\r\n\r\nof  creativity, entrepreneurs, initiative, drive, yes.   At  the\r\n\r\nend, in any field, the top men have got top minds, good balance,\r\n\r\ngood  judgement.  You can take any member of any US Fortune 500.\r\n\r\nAnd  that  is  drawing  out of a pool of  260-something  million\r\n\r\nAmericans.   We  have  3  million  Singaporeans  who   are   not\r\n\r\nreproducing themselves in the optimal way.  If we do not draw in\r\n\r\nthese talents, we will be marginalised.  The other countries  in\r\n\r\nSouth  East  Asia will offer markets.  The banks want  to  come.\r\n\r\nHuge  customers  to  whom they can sell new products  which  the\r\n\r\nlocal banks will not be able to offer.  All this will go on  but\r\n\r\nso  long as Singapore has got its four banks competing, we  will\r\n\r\nbe all right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, every Singaporean counts. That is important. But\r\n\r\nwhen the final decision is made, as with every committee and  as\r\n\r\nwith  every  Cabinet, some people's judgement counts  more  than\r\n\r\nothers.  And no Prime Minister will stay long in his job  if  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  understand that.  You listen to every Minister.   You\r\n\r\nare not an expert in banking.  I was not.  You have to go by the\r\n\r\njudgement,  having  read all the details,  whose  judgement  you\r\n\r\nthink  is sound.  And all this is possible only if there is  not\r\n\r\nonly leadership but a leadership that can interpret its will and\r\n\r\nits plans into action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned a lot from the Catholic Church. They have lasted\r\n\r\nnearly  2,000 years.  The churches that have no hierarchy,  they\r\n\r\nhave not lasted very long. We have the Quakers, Baptists, and so\r\n\r\non.   But this church has lasted 2,000 years.  They have a  core\r\n\r\nof  Cardinals  who  then  elect  the  Pope.   And  they  have  a\r\n\r\npriesthood  that keeps the faith and the flock.  We  need  them.\r\n\r\nWe  need  a core of people who are dedicated to the survival  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Singaporeans because every  Singaporean  counts.\r\n\r\nBut  for  their survival, we need this extra.  If your  computer\r\n\r\nhas  got  32  megabytes and you are putting in  a  program  that\r\n\r\nrequires  128, you'd  better go out and start buying  extra  and\r\n\r\nput it in.  And if you find your Pentium II too slow, you go and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuy  your  Pentium III, or you are not in the game.  You  cannot\r\n\r\ndownload, you cannot interact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it comes down to what kind of an administration do\r\n\r\nwe have that will be able to translate the ideas, the plans of a\r\n\r\nGovernment.  And what kind of a political establishment  do  you\r\n\r\nhave  that  will  ensure that there is  a  flow  of  talent,  of\r\n\r\ntalented people, Singaporeans, and they have to be.  This is one\r\n\r\narea where non-Singaporeans are out because I am entrusting  the\r\n\r\nfuture of 3 million people into your hands.  And I want to  make\r\n\r\nquite sure that your instincts are immediately for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nI  do not know whether other political parties will ever be able\r\n\r\nto  duplicate  what we have done.  But the PAP has  built  up  a\r\n\r\ncadre  of membership of several thousands of which some  80  are\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament and a grassroots leadership which  Mr  Ang\r\n\r\nMong Seng has said is now 20,000-odd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most important is the core in the civil service of\r\n\r\nexpertise on how to run the various Ministries.  So at  the  end\r\n\r\nof  the day, we need this framework.  Yes, we are safer now than\r\n\r\nin  the  1960s which used to worry me because I could count  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  people on whom I had to depend to get  things  done.\r\n\r\nBut without that hard core, there is no Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have listened to Mr Simon Tay. I wish it were possible\r\n\r\nthat  just  by our being civic minded, by having more  NGOs,  we\r\n\r\nwill  throw  up another leadership.  It will not.  It  does  not\r\n\r\nhappen that way.  That is the problem many countries face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, in Indonesia, they have to choose\r\n\r\nbetween  an  elite which has been brought together by  32  years\r\n\r\nunder  President  Suharto.   It  may  or  may  not  be  able  to\r\n\r\ncompletely  abandon  its  past, but it is  a  conglomeration  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  talents in Indonesia that has been able  to  run  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  They may change at the top.  But the central  core  of\r\n\r\npeople who have been running the system, whoever gets to the top\r\n\r\nwill find that he has to draw from the same group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the problem that the Malaysian opposition faces.\r\n\r\nUMNO  has  been at the heart of Government since 1955.  Keadilan\r\n\r\nhas got to offer an alternative.  What is the alternative?  That\r\n\r\nis their problem.  As a very shrewd political commentator, Samad\r\n\r\nIsmail, said, \"That's their problem.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the alternative? And that is Singapore's problem.\r\n\r\nYou  have  listened  to  Mr  Chiam.  You  have  listened  to  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam.   I ask you, \"What is the alternative?\"   I  am  not\r\n\r\ninterested in what political scientists say.  I am interested in\r\n\r\nthe  real  workings of Singapore.  Why have we brought Mr  Simon\r\n\r\nTay and the others in as Nominated MPs?  Because we want to hear\r\n\r\nserious  men and women with serious ideas so that we can  engage\r\n\r\nthe  population in a dialogue.  But will you come out and  spend\r\n\r\nthe  next  30  years  of  your life running  around  building  a\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisation?   And at the  end  of  the  day,  when\r\n\r\nelection  time comes, put up the posters, find the  people  whom\r\n\r\nyou can enthuse and vote for you?  That is a different problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that comes back to the nature of our society. You come\r\n\r\nback  to  Singapore  21.   We  are not  Americans.   In  certain\r\n\r\nrespects,  I  wish we could have become more American  in  their\r\n\r\ngrassroots volunteerism.  Sometimes, late in the evening, when I\r\n\r\nfinish  with  my work, I will check with my wife  who  has  been\r\n\r\nreading all the literature that I brought home.  All the various\r\n\r\nassociations send me their newsletters.  And she would  talk  to\r\n\r\nme about the American newsletter.  This is 20, 30 years ago.  As\r\n\r\na result, they keep on sending it to me till today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early days, the first American expatriates came,\r\n\r\nthey  formed  a  committee to help other  expatriate  wives  and\r\n\r\nfamilies to familiarise themselves, where to shop, where to  get\r\n\r\ndoctors, dentists, what is reliable, what is not reliable.   And\r\n\r\nthey  formed committees to help newly-arrived wives  to  adjust.\r\n\r\nThe  American Embassy had nothing to do with it.  The  Singapore\r\n\r\nInternational  Foundation  has  to  go  out,  send  people  from\r\n\r\nSingapore to Sydney, Perth, Vancouver and London to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norganise  them.  That is culture.  One has a civilisation  where\r\n\r\nin  covered wagons they went across the prairies and fought  the\r\n\r\nRed Indians and said, \"I am going to form a town here.  And this\r\n\r\nis  High  Street, this is Main Street.  I am the banker,  you're\r\n\r\nthe sheriff, he's the mayor.  Now, let's get going.\"  That is  a\r\n\r\ndifferent history, started with the Mayflower and a lot of other\r\n\r\nshiploads of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a different past. And if you dismantle what we\r\n\r\nhave  done so far, you will never rebuild anything to  take  its\r\n\r\nplace in time.  We have got this far and I am greatly encouraged\r\n\r\nthat  we are pushing this big boulder up the hill.  And it needs\r\n\r\npushing  up the hill.  If you can achieve half of what this  S21\r\n\r\nReport says, in the next 20 years, that is a tremendous triumph.\r\n\r\nAnd it will require tremendous efforts to get there.  But I take\r\n\r\ngreat  satisfaction that there is a team in place  that  can  do\r\n\r\nthis  and can listen to Tan Cheng Bock who has a different point\r\n\r\nof view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On OB markers, let me put it very simply. If your\r\n\r\nintention  is  to improve Singapore, you do not worry  about  OB\r\n\r\nmarkers.  It is as simple as that.  It is when your intention is\r\n\r\nto  twist your Minister's tail, to show that you are smart, that\r\n\r\nis  risking  it.   I  think  Claire  Chiang  says,  \"Should  not\r\n\r\ncriticise people when they make foolish suggestions.\"  But  this\r\n\r\nis  part  of the open debate.  If you do not demolish  a  stupid\r\n\r\nsuggestion, it may take root and it would create problems for us\r\n\r\nto  demolish it later.  It is a free country.  But you must  not\r\n\r\nbe  afraid.  No American is afraid to be demolished.   He  comes\r\n\r\nout  with something stupid, he gets a clout, he shrugs  it  off,\r\n\r\nmaybe  comes up with another silly letter.  But in our  society,\r\n\r\nface  is  important.  So we will try, when you twist my tail,  I\r\n\r\nwill only tweak your ear.  But this is a serious business and  I\r\n\r\nthink we should be able to make it. [Applause].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nfirst,  I  would like to thank the Prime Minister for expressing\r\n\r\nthe  Government's strong support and acceptance of  the  report.\r\n\r\nThis  is a strong signal of the Government's commitment for  the\r\n\r\npublic sector to work hand-in-hand with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  people sector and the private sector to achieve the  vision\r\n\r\nof  Singapore 21. I would also like to thank Senior Minister Lee\r\n\r\nfor  joining  this  debate and providing his  unique  historical\r\n\r\nperspective on the issues we face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to thank all the Members who have spoken in support\r\n\r\nof the motion and for their strong endorsement of the vision set\r\n\r\nout in the report. I appreciate the time and effort that Members\r\n\r\nhave  taken,  not just to read the report, but to study  it  and\r\n\r\nprovide their own views and interpretations of what this  vision\r\n\r\nmeans  to  them.  This vision provides a compass, the guideposts\r\n\r\nas  we  move forward into the 21st century.  Our discussions  in\r\n\r\nthis House have given more substance, fleshed out the ideas, and\r\n\r\nwill contribute towards making this vision a reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Prime Minister reminded us that we are a\r\n\r\nstate, but not yet a nation.  He put this debate on Singapore 21\r\n\r\nin perspective.  Nation-building is an on-going task.  It is the\r\n\r\nwork  of  many  generations.  Our people are  made  up  of  many\r\n\r\nstrands,  with  different  languages,  cultures  and  religions.\r\n\r\nThese strands will not dissolve into one indistinguishable mass,\r\n\r\nnor  would  we  want this to be so.  We are closer  today  as  a\r\n\r\npeople  than we started out as a country 33 years ago.   But  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  try to homogenise everyone.  In the House,  in  the\r\n\r\ncorridors,  I have already been asked, \"We have got the  English\r\n\r\nversion.  Where is the Chinese, Tamil and Malay versions?\"   The\r\n\r\nsame  ideas,  the  same vision, but we want  to  read  it  in  a\r\n\r\nlanguage that is most comfortable to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister said, we should maximise the area of\r\n\r\noverlap, while leaving enough space for each group to grow.  The\r\n\r\nself-help  groups  are  one such example.   Where  we  can  work\r\n\r\ntogether,  we should.  But the strength of the self-help  groups\r\n\r\nis that they can address issues specific to each community in  a\r\n\r\nway  that  is most comfortable for the community.  These  issues\r\n\r\nmay  precisely be the ones that are the most fundamental and the\r\n\r\nones which need to be solved in order for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe issues to be overcome, and the problems to be tackled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each community needs its own space. Each community wants to\r\n\r\nretain  a connection with its roots. But we also need a unifying\r\n\r\nvision  to  draw these strands together - to give  us  a  common\r\n\r\ngoal,  a  common purpose, so that we can strive forward together\r\n\r\nas a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multi-racialism, meritocracy and incorruptibility have been\r\n\r\nthe cornerstones on which our country is built. On top of these,\r\n\r\nwe  can add another layer, the five key ideas of Singapore 21 to\r\n\r\nguide  us  into  the future - Every Singaporean Matters,  Strong\r\n\r\nFamilies,  Opportunities  for All, The Singapore  Heartbeat  and\r\n\r\nActive  Citizenship.  I agree with Dr Ong Chit Chung  about  the\r\n\r\ndangers of unbridled individualism and self-interest.  The  five\r\n\r\nideas  have  to  be  taken in context  and  all  together.   The\r\n\r\nindividual has to be placed in the context of community,  family\r\n\r\nand nation, and Mr Lim Swee Say has expressed this well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of coming up with the Singapore 21 report is,\r\n\r\nin  itself,  an example of the possibilities and the limitations\r\n\r\nof  consultation. It was quite an exercise for  the  77  subject\r\n\r\ncommittee  members to consult and solicit feedback as widely  as\r\n\r\nwe   did.  The  subject  committee  members  spent  many   hours\r\n\r\ndiscussing with various groups of people. We had over 80  forums\r\n\r\nand discussion sessions.  In the time we had, a little more than\r\n\r\na  year,  we  managed to have reasonably substantive discussions\r\n\r\nwith  some  6,000 Singaporeans. Each of them, I have  no  doubt,\r\n\r\nrepresents and reflects the views of many more Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But can we speak to every one of our 3 million Singaporeans\r\n\r\nin  every consultation exercise, not just in Singapore,  but  in\r\n\r\nevery corner of the globe?  Sir, it is obviously not possible on\r\n\r\nevery  issue  to  consult every Singaporean directly.   On  some\r\n\r\nissues,  like  the budget which Mr Ravindran referred  to,  pre-announcement consultation is not possible because of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarket  sensitivity.   And good Finance  Ministers  and  central\r\n\r\nbankers  all  over the world have developed the  art  of  either\r\n\r\nmaintaining a stoic silence or of making Delphic predictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Singaporean can provide his feedback and express his\r\n\r\nviews.  There are no limitations and limits on this.  They  need\r\n\r\nnot  be  weighty national issues.  As any Member  of  Parliament\r\n\r\nwill   know,   constituents  regularly  provide   feedback   and\r\n\r\nsuggestions  on  what  might  be  considered  mundane  municipal\r\n\r\nissues.   But  this  makes  a difference  to  people  living  in\r\n\r\nneighbourhoods  and on the ground - should  a  bush  be  removed\r\n\r\nbecause  it  obstructs the view of drivers and pedestrians,  can\r\n\r\nthe timing of the traffic lights at a junction be adjusted, what\r\n\r\nis   the  best  way  to  deal  with  litter  or  crime  in   the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood.  There are many examples which Mr Ang  Mong  Seng\r\n\r\nhas raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it has been in the discussion on Singapore 21. We\r\n\r\nconsulted as many as we could directly and every Member of  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  every Singaporean, was invited to send his views.   That\r\n\r\nis consultation and feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about building consensus? During the consultation\r\n\r\nprocess, among all the ideas and views expressed, a few surfaced\r\n\r\nagain  and  again, and gained prominence, not because they  were\r\n\r\nexpressed again and again, but because they have the most merit.\r\n\r\nThese  ideas  became  the five key ideas  of  the  Singapore  21\r\n\r\nvision.   Not  every one might have agreed with them  initially,\r\n\r\nand  even  at  the  end,  not every one might  agree  with  them\r\n\r\ncompletely. But, we have to exercise our judgement,  decide  and\r\n\r\nmove  on.   That  is  also part of the process.  These  are  the\r\n\r\npossibilities and the limitations of consultation and  consensus\r\n\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a vision to guide us and a willingness to build a\r\n\r\nconsensus,  we  can  pull together as one people.  We  can  work\r\n\r\ntowards becoming a symphony - playing in harmony; rather than  a\r\n\r\ncacophony  producing  a  discordant and meaningless  mixture  of\r\n\r\nsounds,  with each stubbornly insisting on playing  to  his  own\r\n\r\ntune, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  listening to what other people are playing.   That  is  the\r\n\r\ndifference  between  a society based on a  vision  of  consensus\r\n\r\nrather than a lack of vision based on contention.  The energetic\r\n\r\nand enthusiastic contributions of NMP Mdm Claire Chiang stand in\r\n\r\nstark contrast, a refreshing contrast, to the approach taken  by\r\n\r\nMr Jeyaretnam, or the approach taken by Mr Chiam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have achieved economic success through tripartism.\r\n\r\nWorkers,  employers  and Government work together  to  create  a\r\n\r\nconducive  business  environment,  and  create  good  jobs   for\r\n\r\nworkers,  allowing the whole country to enjoy  economic  growth.\r\n\r\nThis is a model that is unique to us in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad spoke about the Singapore 21 vision calling\r\n\r\nfor  a new tripartism - a new tripartism this time in the social\r\n\r\nsphere:   the  people sector, public sector and  private  sector\r\n\r\nworking  together.   Again, this can be our  unique  model,  our\r\n\r\nunique solution to building Singapore's heartware.  Mr Lim  Boon\r\n\r\nHeng,  Mr  Loh  Meng See, Mr Iswaran, Mdm Claire Chiang  and  Mr\r\n\r\nSimon  Tay shared this call for a new tripartism.  Mr  Loh  Meng\r\n\r\nSee  asked whether Singaporeans possess the skills to be  active\r\n\r\ncitizens, while Mr Zulkifli Baharudin and Dr Michael Lim  called\r\n\r\nfor  a mindset change in the public service so that we can build\r\n\r\na cooperative relationship.  Well, I think we all have to take a\r\n\r\nstep forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vision of social tripartism is a compelling vision,\r\n\r\nwith  people  sector organisations, public sector  organisations\r\n\r\nand private sector organisations, coming together, all taking  a\r\n\r\nstep  forward together, reaching out to each other  and  looking\r\n\r\nfor  ways  in which they can work with each other to  strengthen\r\n\r\nour social capital, the heartware, of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran and other Members have asked, \"So, what's\r\n\r\nnext?\"   Some Members, Mr Chew Heng Ching and Dr Lily  Neo  have\r\n\r\nasked  the Government to take the lead in implementing Singapore\r\n\r\n21.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of the Government, the public sector has\r\n\r\nalready been asked to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreview  its  policies and programmes, to ensure  that  they  are\r\n\r\naligned  to the Singapore 21 vision - not Y2K compliant but  S21\r\n\r\ncompliant.   But what more should the Government do?    Left  to\r\n\r\nitself, the momentum of the Singapore 21 vision created  by  the\r\n\r\ndebate  in this House may slacken and dissipate, because of  the\r\n\r\nwide  range  of issues and interests. I would therefore  propose\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  also play the  role  of  facilitator  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  21  to  guide  the process  along,  and  provide  the\r\n\r\nnecessary support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have consulted the Prime Minister on this, and the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has agreed.  Once the House endorses the Singapore  21\r\n\r\nvision,  the Prime Minister will ask the Minister of  State  for\r\n\r\nDefence,  Mr David Lim, to consult with various stakeholders  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  21  - the people sector, the private sector  and  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector - to see how their initiatives can be facilitated\r\n\r\nto  make Singapore 21 a reality.  This could take the form of  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  21  Facilitation  Committee.   Its  task  is  not  to\r\n\r\nimplement  the  Singapore 21 vision.  Rather, it would  help  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen and sustain the process of active citizenship, and to\r\n\r\nprovide  encouragement and visibility for  the  efforts  by  the\r\n\r\npeople,  private  and  public  sectors  as  they  work  to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore 21 a reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore 21 involves individuals, families, the\r\n\r\ncommunity and the nation. Singapore 21 is not the responsibility\r\n\r\nof  any one person or body or agency.   There is no Ministry for\r\n\r\nSingapore  21.   It  is the responsibility of  everybody,  every\r\n\r\nagency,  every  Singaporean, to interpret these  key  ideas  and\r\n\r\ntranslate  them into plans and actions. Only then  can  we  move\r\n\r\nforward to make Singapore 21 become a reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge Members of this House to take this message to their\r\n\r\nconstituencies,  and  to  stress  these  key  ideas   in   their\r\n\r\nconstituency activities and functions.  I ask those contributing\r\n\r\ntheir time in the people sector, those serving in the public and\r\n\r\nprivate  sectors,  to consider how they can  work  more  closely\r\n\r\ntogether.   All  these  will help make  Singapore  21  become  a\r\n\r\nreality.   Deputy Prime Minister Lee, in his address  to  senior\r\n\r\ncivil servants on 29th March this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear,  has already asked the public service to consider  how  to\r\n\r\nbuild  the  ideas  of  Singapore 21 into their  programmes.   On\r\n\r\nTuesday,  you  heard  the  Minister for   Community  Development\r\n\r\nannounce  a  number  of initiatives, for example,  the  National\r\n\r\nVolunteer Programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge every Singaporean to re-examine himself, his goals,\r\n\r\nhis attitudes to success, his attitudes to his family and fellow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans;  and  to come forward to play a  greater  role  in\r\n\r\ncommunity  life.   Mr  Chan Soo Sen put it nicely  in  Confucian\r\n\r\nterms.  We also heard stories from the Ramayana.  Other Members,\r\n\r\nDr  Teo  Ho  Pin, Dr Toh See Kiat, Mr Tay Beng Chuan and  others\r\n\r\ncame  up with their views on what the ideal Singaporean  or  the\r\n\r\nideal  society  should be. Prof Chin Tet  Yung  put  it  nicely.\r\n\r\nEvery Singaporean, any Singaporean, can lead a happy, successful\r\n\r\nand fulfilling life.  He can be a good parent, a good neighbour,\r\n\r\nand  an active citizen.  And he can say that in all this, he did\r\n\r\nhis best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it leaves me now to once again thank Members of the\r\n\r\nHouse for supporting the S21 vision so enthusiastically, and for\r\n\r\nproviding such thoughtful insights. I also wish to thank all the\r\n\r\nmembers of the Singapore 21 Committee who have worked for over a\r\n\r\nyear  to bring clarity and focus to the varied views which  they\r\n\r\nhave  heard from Singaporeans from all walks of life.   I  thank\r\n\r\neveryone who has contributed to forging the Singapore 21 vision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After today, we will move on to the next phase - a far more\r\n\r\nchallenging  phase  -  of turning this vision into reality.   In\r\n\r\nthe  past  few  days  we  have heard heartwarming  stories.   Mr\r\n\r\nBernard Chen spoke of how his father came to regard Singapore as\r\n\r\nhome.  We are glad that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe did, and fortunate that he did, as Singapore is the better by\r\n\r\ntwo  Members of this House.  Members have shared with  us  their\r\n\r\ninnermost thoughts and personal feelings as they struggled  with\r\n\r\ntheir own dilemmas in life.  Let these stories from the past  be\r\n\r\nheld  up as good examples for all of us  -  of committed, active\r\n\r\ncitizens.   And let the icon of the kiasu Singaporean fade  into\r\n\r\n20th  century, and, in its place, emerge the active  Singaporean\r\n\r\n-   the  Singaporean of the 21st century, the icon  of  the  new\r\n\r\nSingaporean.    Beyond   looking  out   for   ourselves,   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean must look out for the larger Singaporean family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my hope that every Singaporean, each in his own way,\r\n\r\nwill  stand  up  and  be  counted, and find  a  way  to  make  a\r\n\r\ndifference to his family, his neighbourhood, his community,  and\r\n\r\nto  Singapore.   There  can  be  no  effort  too  small  or  too\r\n\r\ninsignificant.  And in the process, we would have built a better\r\n\r\nfuture  for  ourselves  and  our children.    Let  us  all  work\r\n\r\ntogether  to  translate the Singapore 21  vision  into  reality.\r\n\r\n[Applause].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House endorses the Vision for Singapore in the\r\n\r\n21st  century  as  set  out in the report of  the  Singapore  21\r\n\r\nCommittee  \"Singapore  21: Together, We  Make  The  Difference\",\r\n\r\ncontained   in  Paper  Misc.  2  of  1999,  as  the  basis   for\r\n\r\nstrengthening  the  heartware  of  Singapore  and  meeting   the\r\n\r\naspirations of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\" - [Dr Lee Boon Yang].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Twenty Five</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Minutes to Seven o'clock pm</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PORK VENDORS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  (a) whether his Ministry is planning any  financial\r\n\r\nassistance  schemes  either on its own or in collaboration  with\r\n\r\nbanks  to  assist pork vendors in setting up chiller facilities;\r\n\r\nand  (b)  whether his Ministry will accord some  flexibility  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate pork vendors who decide to change their trade due  to\r\n\r\nfinancial difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Environment Ministry has arranged with three financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions  to  provide loans to assist meat  stallholders  in\r\n\r\nbuying  chillers.
