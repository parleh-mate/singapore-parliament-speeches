All\r\n\r\nalong  we  have  been in close  contact  with  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring   countries   in   all   fields    of\r\n\r\nactivities,   such   as   trade,   communications,\r\n\r\nshipping    and   aviation.   These   neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries have been making use of this place as  a\r\n\r\nmost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconvenient  transit  centre.  We  occupy  a   most\r\n\r\nimportant position in Southeast Asia. But we  also\r\n\r\nrealise  that Southeast Asia is a very complicated\r\n\r\narea. The Vietnamese people are suffering from the\r\n\r\nravages of war. Other countries are also suffering\r\n\r\nmany  calamities. They have different  historical,\r\n\r\npolitical  and social backgrounds. The  people  of\r\n\r\nthese  countries  have different faiths,  beliefs,\r\n\r\ncreeds,  customs  and  traditions.  In  order   to\r\n\r\nunderstand the religious, cultural, political  and\r\n\r\nsocial  backgrounds  and  the  conditions  of  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries and their  people,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  set up the Institute  of  Southeast\r\n\r\nAsian  Studies which can make a thorough study  of\r\n\r\nall  these  matters. The emphasis in international\r\n\r\nrelationships  at  present  is  on  regional   co-operation, either political or economic. It is  in\r\n\r\ntheir  mutual interest if they seek  a  wider  and\r\n\r\nhigher  level of co-operation. The setting  up  of\r\n\r\nthis  Institute, therefore, is very necessary  and\r\n\r\ntimely at this juncture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my memory does not play me false, I recollect\r\n\r\nthat  our  scholarly Minister  for  Education  has\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier in this House about the  setting\r\n\r\nup  of such an Institute as is now envisaged under\r\n\r\nthis  Bill. If action had been taken earlier,  the\r\n\r\nInstitute would already have been set up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to ask the Minister a few\r\n\r\nquestions.  What work has this Institute  done  so\r\n\r\nfar?  Has the Government allotted any sum of money\r\n\r\nto  the Institute to carry on with its work? Where\r\n\r\nis the Institute and who is responsible for it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  would seem to be many factors in favour  of\r\n\r\nsetting  up  an  agency  like  the  Institute   of\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asian Studies which this Bill  seeks  to\r\n\r\nestablish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be fair to say that our well-being, if\r\n\r\nnot  our survival, is related, to some extent,  to\r\n\r\nthe  destiny  of the countries in  the  region  of\r\n\r\nwhich (to quote a most recent document) we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  fulcrum. It is to our advantage to  encourage\r\n\r\nsystematic  garnering of more  and  more  critical\r\n\r\nknowledge of the countries around us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appropriate for us to conduct regional\r\n\r\nstudies  in  the way we propose to do. Singapore's\r\n\r\nstrategic location makes it an eminently desirable\r\n\r\nand suitable spot to become not only a centre, but\r\n\r\nthe   Centre   for  Southeast  Asian  Studies.   A\r\n\r\nsuccessful Singapore Institute of Southeast  Asian\r\n\r\nStudies will certain1y reflect favourably  on  our\r\n\r\nnational prestige, where previously we have had to\r\n\r\nnote  the  existence of South-east  Asian  Studies\r\n\r\ncentres  in  exotic  places  like  Yale;  Harvard:\r\n\r\nWashington - Washington, Missouri; Canberra; Hull;\r\n\r\nand   London  where  I  believe  South-east  Asian\r\n\r\nStudies comes under the generous umbrella  of  the\r\n\r\nSchool of African and Oriental Studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good to envisage numbers of scholars, not\r\n\r\nonly  from the region, but also from the Far West,\r\n\r\nthat  is, from Europe and perhaps Africa and  from\r\n\r\nthe Far East, like San Francisco on the west coast\r\n\r\nof the United States, coming to Singapore to share\r\n\r\ntheir  knowledge. But there is also the  practical\r\n\r\nadvantage  that spreading knowledge of the  region\r\n\r\nwill  result  in  more people with  lay  interests\r\n\r\nwanting  to come to Singapore and to this  region.\r\n\r\nAnd  they  will come here, Sir, not  to  seek  the\r\n\r\nflesh-pots by which, alas, tourists are  only  too\r\n\r\nfrequently beguiled, but to seek repast of a  more\r\n\r\nintellectual kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other interesting and possibly\r\n\r\nprofitable  by-products. With improved  and  wider\r\n\r\nknowledge  of  the  region,  there  may  also   be\r\n\r\nknowledgeable  interest in  the  possibilities  of\r\n\r\ninvestment and economic development in the region.\r\n\r\nPolitical  and  international decisions  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries  may  also derive from a  more  informed\r\n\r\npublic opinion. There is some testimony to the sad\r\n\r\ncondition of uniformed public opinion about South-east  Asia  in far-away countries. Too often  have\r\n\r\nour  emissaries abroad been asked if Singapore  is\r\n\r\nsituated in South China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now mention one or two points relating to\r\n\r\nthe  development  of  the  proposed  Institute  of\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asian Studies. If initially the director\r\n\r\nof  this Institute be a visitor to this region,  a\r\n\r\npundit so to speak from abroad, in other words, an\r\n\r\nexpatriate,  could we initiate steps  as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible to ensure that we have a director who  is\r\n\r\nindigenous    to   the   region,   preferably    a\r\n\r\nSingaporean?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make this point because I feel, and this\r\n\r\nfeeling  has been to some extent substantiated  in\r\n\r\nconversations  with  one  or  two   people,   that\r\n\r\nscholars  in  this region would be more  ready  to\r\n\r\nestablish rapport with somebody whom they feel may\r\n\r\nbe   more   spiritually  sympathetic  with   their\r\n\r\naspirations.   Whether   we,   in   our    prudent\r\n\r\nobjectivity, like it or not, there are  people  in\r\n\r\nthe region whose sense of nationalism has been  so\r\n\r\nexacerbated by their experience of recent  history\r\n\r\nthat  they  even carry the fear of so-called  neo-colonialism into the academic sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to make is that this\r\n\r\nInstitute could also provide opportunities for the\r\n\r\nstudy  of  languages in the region. I notice  that\r\n\r\nthe   erection,   equipment  and  maintenance   of\r\n\r\nlibraries  feature  in  the  provisions   of   the\r\n\r\nInstitute.   This  would  certainly  involve   the\r\n\r\nacquisition  of  local materials,  however  poorly\r\n\r\norganised  the local book trade of the region  may\r\n\r\nbe. In fact, this aspect may make the problems  of\r\n\r\ntranslation into a lingua franca more urgent. I am\r\n\r\nsure  the very latest devices will be used in  the\r\n\r\nrapid  study  of local languages. Presumably,  the\r\n\r\nerection  of  laboratories mentioned in  the  Bill\r\n\r\nwould refer to language laboratories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another point is the possible extension of\r\n\r\nthe  resources  and  facilities  of  the  proposed\r\n\r\nInstitute to a wider audience than that consisting\r\n\r\nonly    of   professional   scholars   and   their\r\n\r\nancillaries.  Perhaps some of the members  of  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  public  in Singapore,  who  are  suitably\r\n\r\ninclined,   could  benefit  from  the  Institute's\r\n\r\nactivities  -  perhaps  through  seminars,  public\r\n\r\nlectures, lecture\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourses  and the like. The general adult education\r\n\r\npotential of the Institute should not be ignored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the publishing of books and other\r\n\r\npublications features among the provisions of  the\r\n\r\nproposed  Institute. But a layman like myself  may\r\n\r\nfind  deterring the presence of footnotes, learned\r\n\r\nannotations, and similar rubrics which  formidably\r\n\r\ncharacterise  the work of scholars.  It  would  be\r\n\r\nuseful  if  books popularising area studies  could\r\n\r\nalso  be  forthcoming, with the contents of  these\r\n\r\nbooks  not  in  any  way losing  in  accuracy  and\r\n\r\nscholarship   by   the   simplicity    of    their\r\n\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, and as a relevant corollary to all I have\r\n\r\njust  said, could encouragement be given  to  area\r\n\r\nstudies   being   actively   extended    in    our\r\n\r\nuniversities?  I  say  this  because  recently   I\r\n\r\nreceived  an  enquiry  about  the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nsomeone  following a programme of area studies  in\r\n\r\nthe   University  of  Singapore   in   a   certain\r\n\r\ndiscipline.  I  shall not mention  the  discipline\r\n\r\nconcerned because of the fear of having to make  a\r\n\r\nreference   to  a  specific  department   in   the\r\n\r\nUniversity.  I  found that area studies  were  not\r\n\r\nconducted in this particular discipline. Relations\r\n\r\nbetween  the Institute and our universities  would\r\n\r\nbe  more productive if area studies are encouraged\r\n\r\nas much as possible in our universities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to underline my support for this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L.

If he had read the last two sentences\r\n\r\nin  page  9  of  the Bill, he would have  got  the\r\n\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the Institute of Southeast\r\n\r\nAsian Studies Bill will serve as an impetus and  a\r\n\r\nguide  to  those who have been looking forward  to\r\n\r\nthe  establishment  of such  an  Institute  to  do\r\n\r\nresearch into the various aspects of this  region.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a research centre, especially\r\n\r\na   centre   to  study  the  problems  confronting\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia, is, vital for Singapore. Singapore\r\n\r\nrealises  her  significance in the region  and  is\r\n\r\ntaking  cautious  steps to  promote  regional  co-operation. Such an Institute not only provides  an\r\n\r\nacademic research centre\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor our intellectuals but it also helps to resolve\r\n\r\nthe  problems of Southeast Asia by coming up  with\r\n\r\nmethods and answers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my maiden speech in this House I touched\r\n\r\non the problems of this region. I pointed out that\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia has all along been the  centre  of\r\n\r\nattraction of the world. This is not because  this\r\n\r\narea  is  rich and strong but because it has  been\r\n\r\nrecognised  and considered as one of  the  weakest\r\n\r\nareas  in  the  world. As we  know,  most  of  the\r\n\r\ncountries  in  this  region  are  newly   emerging\r\n\r\ncountries. We are all classified either within the\r\n\r\neconomic  scope  of under-developed  countries  or\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries.  Southeast  Asia  has   been\r\n\r\nlooked  upon  as  a region which is  not  able  to\r\n\r\nmobilise  its political and economic resources  to\r\n\r\nbargain with the more advanced countries or  super\r\n\r\npowers  on  an equal footing. One can hardly  deny\r\n\r\nthat  all  these  factors were  created  by  human\r\n\r\nbeings   in   past  decades  when  the   political\r\n\r\nsituation in the world was entirely different. Now\r\n\r\nthat  most  of  the  newly emerging  countries  in\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia are struggling to achieve  progress\r\n\r\nand  the  ultimate aim of equal  status  with  the\r\n\r\nadvanced countries in the world, we must find ways\r\n\r\nand means to counter these prevailing factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the problems confronting the countries\r\n\r\nin  Southeast Asia? What are the factors hampering\r\n\r\nthe  progress of countries in this region? How can\r\n\r\nthese  problems be solved? What measures are ideal\r\n\r\nto  solve these problems? All these questions  can\r\n\r\nbe  closely  studied by a critical examination  of\r\n\r\nthe  nature  of  the conflicts and  disputes  that\r\n\r\noccur  in our midst if we have a Research  Centre.\r\n\r\nHence  the  establishment  of  the  Institute   of\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asian Studies which will  shoulder  the\r\n\r\ntask of enlightening us with a clearer picture  of\r\n\r\nthe  problems in this region in the crucial 1970s.\r\n\r\nIf  one  speaks on the problems of Southeast  Asia\r\n\r\nwithout pointing out the root or complexity of the\r\n\r\nproblems  and  the methods to solve them,  one  is\r\n\r\njust  being impractical. We must find out the true\r\n\r\nfacts of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblems and the fundamental factors causing  such\r\n\r\nproblems  before  we  can  solve  them.  In   this\r\n\r\nrespect,  Sir,  I  am  of  the  opinion  that  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of the Institute of Southeast  Asian\r\n\r\nStudies   will   be  able  to  make   an   immense\r\n\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look into the historical background of the\r\n\r\nnewly  emerging countries of Southeast  Asia.  One\r\n\r\nstruggle  comes  after another.  These  struggles,\r\n\r\nwhether  of a bloody or peaceful nature,  have  no\r\n\r\nultimate  aim.  These occurrences  in  a  country,\r\n\r\nwhether  of  an  advantageous or a disadvantageous\r\n\r\nnature,  will certainly influence the economy  and\r\n\r\nthe  social pattern of another country because  we\r\n\r\nare  all  situated  within  the  same  region  and\r\n\r\nsurrounded by the same waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the countries in Southeast Asia have gone\r\n\r\nthrough  similar stages when struggling for  their\r\n\r\nindependence.  We  were  all  once  upon  a   time\r\n\r\ncolonies of the big powers. We all fought  against\r\n\r\ncolonialism to achieve independence. Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nit   would  not  be  untrue  to  say  that   after\r\n\r\nindependence some countries still carry on on  the\r\n\r\nsame  basis as their former colonial masters  did,\r\n\r\nwith their direct experiences of societies in  the\r\n\r\nwest.   Some   countries  have  even   turned   to\r\n\r\ndependence  on guarantees from the big powers  for\r\n\r\nsurvival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the midst of these complexities, it is\r\n\r\nessential   to  study  all  affairs  and   matters\r\n\r\nappertaining  to Southeast Asia.  In  this  multi-racial  region,  besides having gone  through  the\r\n\r\nsame  struggle for political independence as other\r\n\r\ncountries, we too have similarities in the  social\r\n\r\nstructure, behaviour of people, culture, religion,\r\n\r\netc.  So  if differences of interests which  arise\r\n\r\nwithin  this  region  are unresolved,  they  could\r\n\r\nultimately threaten the peace and progress of this\r\n\r\nregion.  On  the  basis  that  the  countries   in\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia are inter-dependent on one  another\r\n\r\nin   this  new  era,  each  country  must  develop\r\n\r\nregional  initiative in economic co-operation  and\r\n\r\nmutual assistance and understanding. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestablishment of such an Institute emphasises  the\r\n\r\nimportance  we  place on our own  region  and  the\r\n\r\nimportance   of   understanding   our    immediate\r\n\r\nneighbours.     Through     participation     with\r\n\r\nintellectuals, scholars, teachers, etc, of  other\r\n\r\ncountries  around  us, we are  able  to  know  our\r\n\r\nneighbours  better  and they  will  understand  us\r\n\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, co-operation is a necessary ingredient for\r\n\r\nprogress.  You  may agree with me  that  with  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of this Institute, we are  paving  a\r\n\r\nmore   radical   approach  towards  cultural   and\r\n\r\neducational  co-operation with countries  in  this\r\n\r\nregion.  Although  the establishment  of  such  an\r\n\r\norganisation will involve the Government in  extra\r\n\r\nfinancial expenditure, I consider this expenditure\r\n\r\nto be necessary if we are to become more vital and\r\n\r\ncreative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I am happy to note that in clauses\r\n\r\n16 and 17 of the Bill, the Board is given power to\r\n\r\naccept gifts on behalf of the Institute, and it is\r\n\r\nalso provided that gifts to the Institute shall be\r\n\r\nexempt  from income tax. I am confident that  such\r\n\r\nprovisions in the Bill will encourage more aid and\r\n\r\nassistance  from the general public to ensure  the\r\n\r\nsuccess of this Institute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, looking at this Bill, I am confident that it\r\n\r\nwill  receive acclaim and support from  those  who\r\n\r\nare  interested in problems concerning our  nation\r\n\r\nand Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad\r\n\r\nthat  the proposed Institute has evoked among  our\r\n\r\nBack-benchers such a lively interest in  Southeast\r\n\r\nAsian  affairs.

Benda,\r\n\r\nProfessor of History, Yale University, and now con\r\n\r\ncurrently  Acting Director of the Southeast  Asian\r\n\r\nStudies   Programme   in  Yale   University.   The\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore has lent the Institute one\r\n\r\nof   its   large  bungalows  within  its  grounds.\r\n\r\nAlterations and additions are being carried out to\r\n\r\nthis bungalow and work is expected to be completed\r\n\r\nin  the  first  week of June.  This  will  be  the\r\n\r\ntemporary home of the Institute until it moves  to\r\n\r\nthe  three  top  floors of the new  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  library building which is  planned  for\r\n\r\ncompletion  in  roughly  two  years'   time.

It was\r\n\r\noriginally  estimated that for the 5-year  period,\r\n\r\n1966-1970,  there would be an average growth  rate\r\n\r\nof  8  per  cent, or nearly 30,000 direct exchange\r\n\r\nlines  would  have  to be installed  to  meet  the\r\n\r\npublic's  demand for telephones.  But  the  actual\r\n\r\nnumber of direct lines installed during the  years\r\n\r\n1966  and  1967  was 5,800 and 8,400 respectively,\r\n\r\nwhich  gives an average rate of growth of  12  per\r\n\r\ncent  over  two years, or 50 per cent higher  than\r\n\r\nthe  original estimated rate of growth  of  8  per\r\n\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the present waiting list for telephones\r\n\r\nis  2,400,  and with the Government's  development\r\n\r\nplans  being further accelerated, the  demand  for\r\n\r\ntelephones  must therefore increase still  further\r\n\r\nand  the  Board has no alternative but  to  revise\r\n\r\nupward its plans again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet this increasing demand, the Board has set\r\n\r\naside $15.6 million for development this year, and\r\n\r\nanother  $16 million for next year, thus making  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  over $31 million for the two  years  on\r\n\r\ndevelopment programmes and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncapital  expenditure  in building  new  exchanges,\r\n\r\nlaying new cables and installing new equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the new 50,000 exchange lines now under\r\n\r\nconstruction   at   the   junction    of    Exeter\r\n\r\nRoad/Devonshire  Road to meet the rapidly  growing\r\n\r\nhotel  and business sector along the Orchard  Road\r\n\r\narea,  the  Board has plans to erect  another  two\r\n\r\nexchanges in the near future, one in the  Crawford\r\n\r\narea  and perhaps another small exchange to  serve\r\n\r\nthe Ama Keng area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase in the Board's activities,\r\n\r\nthere  has  been a corresponding increase  in  the\r\n\r\nduties  and responsibilities of the Board members.\r\n\r\nIt  is  considered that the business of the  Board\r\n\r\nhas   reached  a  stage  to  warrant  an  enlarged\r\n\r\nmembership, which is the sole aim of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

It   is  time  that  we  enlarged   the\r\n\r\nmembership of the Board so that it would  be  more\r\n\r\nefficient in achieving the objectives as  outlined\r\n\r\nby  the President in his speech in this House.  As\r\n\r\nexplained by the Minister for Communications,  the\r\n\r\nwork  of the Telephone Board is increasing day  by\r\n\r\nday and this Bill is necessary for the development\r\n\r\nof telephone communications in the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, besides increasing the membership of the\r\n\r\nBoard,  the Minister should also pay attention  to\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of  the Board workers.  He  should\r\n\r\nappoint   another  representative  of  the   Board\r\n\r\nworkers  to sit on the Board. At present there  is\r\n\r\nonly  one  representative  of  the  staff  of  the\r\n\r\nTelephone Board sitting on the Board. If one  more\r\n\r\nrepresentative is added, I am sure the workers  of\r\n\r\nthe  Telephone Board will have more confidence  in\r\n\r\nthe Board. They will co-operate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin achieving their objective of being more\r\n\r\nefficient  and thus improving the economy  of  the\r\n\r\nRepublic.  With  the  introduction  of   the   new\r\n\r\nEmployment Bill, there will be doubts and fears in\r\n\r\nthe  minds  of  the workers. Therefore,  with  two\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the staff members  sitting  on\r\n\r\nthe  Board,  the  interests of the S.T.B, workers\r\n\r\nwill be ensured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to draw the attention of the\r\n\r\nMinister  to the need for erecting more  telephone\r\n\r\nbooths in the Republic. He should give this matter\r\n\r\nhis  serious consideration. There have  been  many\r\n\r\napplications for the erection of telephone  booths\r\n\r\nin  the  rural  areas,  but  they  have  not  been\r\n\r\nentertained. Applications for the installation  of\r\n\r\ntelephones in private premises have also not  been\r\n\r\nentertained due to lack of facilities.  There  are\r\n\r\nareas  with  cables  but  without  appliances  and\r\n\r\nequipment. There are also areas -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I hope they can\r\n\r\nformulate a policy on the use of public telephones\r\n\r\nin  booths  in  the  interests of  maintaining  an\r\n\r\nefficient service. At present a person can  use  a\r\n\r\npublic  telephone by paying ten cents and  he  can\r\n\r\nspeak  for  as long as he likes. There are  booths\r\n\r\nwhere  people  make use of the  phone  for  hours,\r\n\r\nespecially  when  two  lovers  are  talking.  This\r\n\r\nprevents others from using the telephone,  and  it\r\n\r\ncan be serious if the matter is important or there\r\n\r\nis an emergency. In order to prevent the misuse of\r\n\r\ntelephones in booths, I suggest that a time  limit\r\n\r\nbe  imposed  on  the  use of  the  telephone.  For\r\n\r\nexample, on paying ten cents a person can use  the\r\n\r\ntelephone for only 10 to 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with the increase in the\r\n\r\nmembership  of the Board from seven to  nine,  the\r\n\r\nBoard should be able to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink of more facilities which can be given to the\r\n\r\npublic  and  see  to  it that these  will  not  be\r\n\r\nmisused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker,, Sir, of the\r\n\r\npresent  seven members on the-Board there  is,  as\r\n\r\nstated   by  the  Member  for  Kampong  Kembangan,\r\n\r\nalready one representative from the N.T.U.C. I  am\r\n\r\nafraid that his request for an additional workers'\r\n\r\nrepresentative is not acceptable' to  me  because,\r\n\r\nin  my view, one workers' representative should be\r\n\r\nmore  than  adequate for the purposes of  workers'\r\n\r\nrepresentation. In fact, I found  to  my  surprise\r\n\r\nthat  although  the Singapore Telephone  Board  is\r\n\r\nsuch  a  large corporation with a capital  of  $20\r\n\r\nmillion  and  a  general reserve of  $25  million,\r\n\r\nthere is not even a Ministry representative on the\r\n\r\n7-member Board. So I have decided that of the  two\r\n\r\nnew  members who will be sitting on the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTelephone   Board,  one  will  be   a   Government\r\n\r\nrepresentative who will keep an eye on  the  large\r\n\r\nfunds   that   are   being   disbursed   in   this\r\n\r\norganisation.  All  the' other  members  are  non-Government members, and I think it should  be  so.\r\n\r\nThis  very  important  organisation,  which  comes\r\n\r\nunder  the  general heading of Telecommunications,\r\n\r\nis  a  monopoly at present, because  there  is  no\r\n\r\nother  competing telephone company  to  offer  its\r\n\r\nservices  to  the public. I would like-members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public  to participate in the supervision  of\r\n\r\nthis organisation and I look forward to appointing\r\n\r\na   non-Government   member  -   perhaps   another\r\n\r\naccountant  or  an economist -  to  serve  on  the\r\n\r\nBoard. This will have to be done very soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the request to increase the number of\r\n\r\ntelephone   booths,  this  matter   is   receiving\r\n\r\nattention.

But\r\n\r\nI  wish  to  state that there are over 750  public\r\n\r\ntelephone booths throughout the island  and  I  am\r\n\r\ngiven to understand that they are frequently used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

No  such\r\n\r\npower exists in the existing Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28 of the Bill makes it necessary for the\r\n\r\nSecretary  of the Board to exhibit a copy  of  the\r\n\r\nannual  report and accounts of the Board  in  each\r\n\r\ntemple  administered by the Board. Hitherto,  such\r\n\r\nreports  and  accounts are  required  only  to  be\r\n\r\npublished   in  the  Gazette.  As  the  Government\r\n\r\nGazette may not be readily available to all Hindus\r\n\r\nattending  their  temples, the exhibition  of  the\r\n\r\nannual  report and accounts at the temple premises\r\n\r\nwill enable those Hindus who attend the temples to\r\n\r\nknow the activities of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 34 of the Bill expressly prohibits the\r\n\r\nBoard   or   any  committee  of  management   from\r\n\r\npermitting any temple administered by the Board or\r\n\r\nproperty belonging to any endowment to be used\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  political  purposes.

With  the\r\n\r\npassage  of  time,  we found  discrepancies  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of the changed conditions in the Republic.\r\n\r\nWe  naturally  need some changes. I consider  this\r\n\r\nBill  to  be  very desirable. The Hindu Endowments\r\n\r\nBoard will be set up to administer Hindu religious\r\n\r\nand  charitable  endowments. The  members  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard  must  be  Hindus as  well  as  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  No member, however, can  dominate  the\r\n\r\nBoard's affairs for a prolonged period, unlike  in\r\n\r\nthe  past  when  a certain group of members  could\r\n\r\ndominate   Hindu  affairs  with  their  autocratic\r\n\r\npolicies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of the Bill, every member is\r\n\r\nallowed  to serve on the Board for not  more  than\r\n\r\nthree years.

The\r\n\r\nCouncil,  which is a registered society under  the\r\n\r\nSocieties  Ordinance, was established in  December\r\n\r\n1958  to  co-ordinate the work  of  all  voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare   organisations  in  Singapore.   It   has\r\n\r\ncontributed much in welfare work in the  past  ten\r\n\r\nyears of its existence, especially during times of\r\n\r\nfire,  flood, and other calamities. In recognition\r\n\r\nof  its past services and the planned expansion of\r\n\r\nits  future activities, including the construction\r\n\r\nof  the Singapore Social Service Centre, the  time\r\n\r\nis  now  opportune  to incorporate  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nCouncil of Social Service by legislation so as  to\r\n\r\naccord  it the status due to it. This is  provided\r\n\r\nfor in clause 3 of the Bill. Since the Council  is\r\n\r\nalready  a  going concern, clause 5  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides  for the transfer of all its  assets  and\r\n\r\nliabilities to the new corporate body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill provides for the composition\r\n\r\nof   the   Council   which   shall   comprise    a\r\n\r\nrepresentative each of the 83 organisations as set\r\n\r\nout  in  the  Schedule  to  the  Bill.  These   83\r\n\r\norganisations  are  already  represented  in   the\r\n\r\nexisting  Council. Power, however, is provided  in\r\n\r\nclause 6 (2) of the Bill for the Minister to amend\r\n\r\nthe  Schedule on the advice of the Council or  the\r\n\r\nBoard   of   Management  so  as  to   enable   new\r\n\r\norganisations  that  may  be  established  to   be\r\n\r\nrepresented   in  the  Council,  or  delete   such\r\n\r\norganisations  which  shall cease  to  operate  as\r\n\r\nwelfare  or charitable organisations. Besides  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the 83 organisations as set out\r\n\r\nin  the Schedule to the Bill, clauses 7 and  8  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill allow for two additional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmembers in the Council as representatives  of  the\r\n\r\nassociate members and two ex-officio members,  and\r\n\r\nthey  are the Director of Social Welfare  and  the\r\n\r\nHead  of the Department of Social Work and  Social\r\n\r\nAdministration, University of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objects of the Council which are set out in\r\n\r\nclause   10  include  the  coordination   of   all\r\n\r\nvoluntary   welfare   activities   in   Singapore,\r\n\r\nimprovement  of  standards  of  welfare  work  and\r\n\r\nencouragement  of  welfare  work  in  fields   not\r\n\r\ncovered  by  Government, initiation, organisation,\r\n\r\nassistance  in schemes of social service,  raising\r\n\r\nand administering funds and goods entrusted to it,\r\n\r\nas  well as advising Government on legislation  in\r\n\r\nfields of social welfare work or in furtherance of\r\n\r\nthe  objects of the Council.

It is introduced in  time  to\r\n\r\ncope  with the social welfare services which  will\r\n\r\nbe limited in expansion because of the increase in\r\n\r\ndefence  expenditure  in the  approaching  crucial\r\n\r\nyears ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Social Affairs has promptly\r\n\r\ntaken  appropriate and practical steps to maintain\r\n\r\nand   enhance  the  reputation  that  the   social\r\n\r\nservices in Singapore are acknowledged to  be  the\r\n\r\nbest  in  the whole of South-east Asia. I am  sure\r\n\r\nthat  all Members of the House will agree with  me\r\n\r\nin my appreciation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past, the Singapore\r\n\r\nCouncil  of Social Service was in existence  as  a\r\n\r\nvoluntary  organised body formed  by  some  social\r\n\r\nworkers and civic-minded citizens who saw the need\r\n\r\nto  co-ordinate  whenever and where-ever  possible\r\n\r\nthe  work of voluntary welfare bodies and to avoid\r\n\r\nduplication of their activities. In addition, they\r\n\r\ntried to encourage efforts in fields not presently\r\n\r\ncovered  either  by  voluntary  workers   or   the\r\n\r\nDepartment of Social Welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the existing Council has done\r\n\r\ngood work. Let me mention here one commendable and\r\n\r\nmost  striking  example. On 13th  February,  1959,\r\n\r\nwhen  the Tiong Bahru fire rendered 5,000  persons\r\n\r\nhomeless,  the  Council undertook  the  tremendous\r\n\r\ntask  of  raising $700,000 within a month for  the\r\n\r\nrelief of the homeless. There were other fires and\r\n\r\nfloods  from  time  to time.  In  each  case,  the\r\n\r\nCouncil was able to raise funds and obtain  relief\r\n\r\nfor the victims at short notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the praiseworthy welfare work\r\n\r\ndone by the Council and other voluntary bodies  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter of great credit to the good people who  are\r\n\r\nengaged   in   this   work.   They   deserve   our\r\n\r\nappreciation and thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Social Affairs has correctly\r\n\r\ntimed the introduction of this Bill to incorporate\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Council of Social Service. It  will\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  help to strengthen  and  perfect  the\r\n\r\nexisting voluntary organisations or welfare bodies\r\n\r\nand will further benefit the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to say a\r\n\r\nfew words in praise of the objects which this Bill\r\n\r\nis   intended   to  achieve,  in  particular   the\r\n\r\npromotion and publicity of voluntary welfare work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many words of approbation have been uttered in\r\n\r\nthis  House  in  respect of  various  efforts  and\r\n\r\nventures, but not enough, in my opinion, has  been\r\n\r\nuttered  in respect of voluntary efforts.  I  take\r\n\r\nthis opportunity to express my appreciation -  and\r\n\r\nI  can quite certainly say the appreciation of all\r\n\r\nMembers of this House - of the efforts of all  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary workers in the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the value of the effort, is not only in the\r\n\r\nfunction  of its contribution, but more  important\r\n\r\nstill  in  its  exemplariness of concern  for  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of one's community and country. It  is  an\r\n\r\neffort  generated by the altruism which I  believe\r\n\r\nis  a  common human component of all our  peoples,\r\n\r\nand the House should give more recognition to this\r\n\r\naltruism  and accord it the commendation  that  it\r\n\r\ndeserves. I am sure that the Council, as envisaged\r\n\r\nin   this  Bill,  will  succeed  in  co-ordinating\r\n\r\nvoluntary  efforts  and  improving  standards   of\r\n\r\nsocial activity and thereby I hope it will succeed\r\n\r\nin  publicising its efforts and attracting more of\r\n\r\nthe disinterested benevolence of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I notice that an unfortunate omission\r\n\r\nhas  been made in this Bill, that is the provision\r\n\r\ndeclaring that this is a council or institution of\r\n\r\na  public  character for the purpose of  exempting\r\n\r\nfrom income tax donations made to it. I would like\r\n\r\nto  believe,  Sir,  that  this  Bill  contemplates\r\n\r\nexempting donations to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  institution from income tax. This  has  been\r\n\r\nomitted  from this Bill. Perhaps when the Minister\r\n\r\nsums up he can enlighten us on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng temporarily in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): This is a very\r\n\r\ngood  Bill which deserves our support. I  give  my\r\n\r\nfull support to it. I hope the Member for Nee Soon\r\n\r\nwill  not  say that he cannot support  it.  In  my\r\n\r\nview,  this Bill should have been introduced  much\r\n\r\nearlier,  so  that all the voluntary organisations\r\n\r\nin   Singapore  could  become  members   of   this\r\n\r\nstatutory  body  in  order to improve  the  social\r\n\r\nservices  of our Republic. But it is not too  late\r\n\r\nto introduce this Bill and we welcome it now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to\r\n\r\nassociate  myself with the last  two  Members  who\r\n\r\nspoke  in support of this Bill and in appreciation\r\n\r\nof  the services rendered by the various voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations  and  their  contributions  to   our\r\n\r\nnation. For example, these organisations have made\r\n\r\ngreat  contributions in organising relief for  the\r\n\r\nvictims  of outbreaks of fire and other  kinds  of\r\n\r\ncalamity.   They   do  this   in   a   spirit   of\r\n\r\nunselfishness  and a sense of public-spiritedness.\r\n\r\nIt is because of their contributions that the less\r\n\r\nfortunate members of our society are able to enjoy\r\n\r\nsome  of the comforts of life. They have thus  the\r\n\r\nhope  and  the  will  to  continue  earning  their\r\n\r\nlivelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes without saying that the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  always interested in  the  welfare\r\n\r\nservices  of  the  country. For example,  we  have\r\n\r\ngiven  a  lot of money by way of public assistance\r\n\r\nto  the  less fortunate members of our society.  I\r\n\r\nremember that in 1966 the sum allotted for  public\r\n\r\nassistance was about $9.6 million. In 1967 it  was\r\n\r\nabout  $7  million. This money  was  disbursed  to\r\n\r\npeople  who were suffering from chronic  diseases,\r\n\r\nparticularly those who suffered from tuberculosis,\r\n\r\nand to the unemployed. At the same time, we have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  set up homes for the aged to look after  old\r\n\r\npeople  and also homes for children to look  after\r\n\r\nthe helpless children of our Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this goes to show the socialist spirit of our\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the humanitarianism  that  we  are\r\n\r\nseeking  to  establish. As  a  centre  for  social\r\n\r\nservices,  the  Government has  a  great  responsi\r\n\r\nbility,  particularly in view of  the  accelerated\r\n\r\nwithdrawal of the British troops by 1971. We  will\r\n\r\nbe  faced with two problems, namely, economic  and\r\n\r\ndefence.  Under these circumstances,  we  will  of\r\n\r\nnecessity require more voluntary organisations  to\r\n\r\nstep  up  their activities and thereby assist  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  carrying out social  services  and\r\n\r\nalso  help  solve the problems relating  to  these\r\n\r\nservices. It is my earnest hope that the  well-to-do  and  rich members of our society will be  more\r\n\r\ninterested in social services. I appeal to them to\r\n\r\nbe  more  generous in their contributions  to  the\r\n\r\nsocial  services  of Singapore  so  that  all  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary organisations and the Singapore  Council\r\n\r\nof  Social Service will have more money  to  carry\r\n\r\nout social service work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nSir,  I rise in support of the Bill introduced  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister.

In fact, redevelopment of these\r\n\r\nareas  has  been  proceeding  satisfactorily.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment,  however, considers it important  that\r\n\r\nthere  should be maximum private participation  in\r\n\r\nour  urban  redevelopment programme. To this  end,\r\n\r\nprivate  development  tax  concessions  have  been\r\n\r\napproved  for  development  projects  in  some  20\r\n\r\ndesignated  areas in the city. These  provide  for\r\n\r\nexemption  of property tax on vacant  land  during\r\n\r\nthe  period  of  construction  and  reduction   of\r\n\r\nassessment rates from 36 per cent to 12  per  cent\r\n\r\nover  a  period  of 20 years on  completion  of  a\r\n\r\nproject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax concessions by themselves will not, however,\r\n\r\nbring  about  development if the landlord  or  the\r\n\r\nowner  of  the  land is unable  to  obtain  vacant\r\n\r\npossession  from  his tenants where  such  tenants\r\n\r\ntake  advantage of the protection against eviction\r\n\r\nafforded  to  them  under  the  Control  of   Rent\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to demand exhorbitant sums as  a  price\r\n\r\nfor   surrendering   vacant  possession   to   the\r\n\r\nlandlord.  In  some instances, the landlords  have\r\n\r\nrefused  to pay such excessive sums as a  premium,\r\n\r\nas  it  were,  for the development of their  sites\r\n\r\nand,  as  a  result, development has  been  unduly\r\n\r\nhampered and delayed in some areas which are  ripe\r\n\r\nfor redevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the law now stands, there\r\n\r\nare   serious  setbacks  in  the  way  of  private\r\n\r\ninvestors   who   genuinely   want   to    promote\r\n\r\ndevelopment in Singapore, and the Bill now  before\r\n\r\nthis  House  is designed to encourage and  promote\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  the  private sector  by  enabling\r\n\r\nlandlords  of  premises,  which  are  at   present\r\n\r\nprotected and controlled by 'the Control  of  Rent\r\n\r\nOrdinance,   to   recover  possession   of   these\r\n\r\ncontrolled  premises for development  purposes  on\r\n\r\npayment  of  a  reasonable  compensation  to   the\r\n\r\ntenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is the intention to refer this Bill to\r\n\r\nSelect Committee in order that full\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  public  views,  particularly  on  the\r\n\r\ncompensation  rates proposed, can be  obtained,  I\r\n\r\nshall merely touch on certain salient features  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides, inter alia, for the Minister\r\n\r\nto  designate certain areas in Singapore that  are\r\n\r\nearmarked   for   development.   A   landlord   of\r\n\r\ncontrolled premises in a designated area may apply\r\n\r\nto  a  Board,  called  the \"Tenants'  Compensation\r\n\r\nBoard\", for an order to recover possession of  his\r\n\r\ncontrolled  premises. The Board,  before  granting\r\n\r\nthe  application,  is required to  satisfy  itself\r\n\r\nthat  the landlord has a genuine intention as well\r\n\r\nas  the financial means to develop the area,  that\r\n\r\nthis  plan for development has been approved by  a\r\n\r\npublic  officer appointed by the Minister for  the\r\n\r\npurpose, and that he would compensate dispossessed\r\n\r\ntenants  and sub-tenants. If the Board grants  the\r\n\r\napplication, the landlord would have to  give  his\r\n\r\ntenants at least three months' notice to quit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist the Board in arriving at a fair and\r\n\r\njust  assessment of compensation,  the  Bill  lays\r\n\r\ndown as guide lines minimum limits of compensation\r\n\r\nto  be  awarded which will vary according  to  the\r\n\r\nnature  of  the  user of the controlled  premises,\r\n\r\nthat is to say, whether commercial or residential.\r\n\r\nIt  is  considered that the formula that has  been\r\n\r\nadopted  offers  a satisfactory approach  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter.  It is not claimed to be a perfect formula\r\n\r\nthat  will  provide  a ready  answer  to  all  the\r\n\r\nsituations that the Board will be confronted with.\r\n\r\nIf there is such a formula, we have been unable to\r\n\r\ndevise it. The merit of the formula that has  been\r\n\r\nadopted  in  clause 7 of the Bill is  that,  apart\r\n\r\nfrom its simplicity, it does confer upon the Board\r\n\r\na great deal of flexibility in its determinations.\r\n\r\nOnly  experience  gained in the  working  of  this\r\n\r\nproposed legislation will show whether the formula\r\n\r\nadopted will assist the Board in carrying out  the\r\n\r\nmain  objective of the Bill which is,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,   the   promotion   and   encouragement   of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  the  private  sector  in  certain\r\n\r\ndesignated areas in our Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I state at this stage that\r\n\r\nany  alternative proposals to the Select Committee\r\n\r\non  the compensation provisions as well as on  any\r\n\r\nother  provisions in this Bill, will  be  welcomed\r\n\r\nand will receive very careful consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tenants' Compensation Board's order for\r\n\r\nrecovery of possession of controlled premises  and\r\n\r\nan   award  of  compensation  will  be  final  and\r\n\r\nconclusive  and  will also be enforceable  against\r\n\r\nunauthorised  persons  on the  premises;  but  the\r\n\r\ninterests of tenants and sub-tenants are protected\r\n\r\nby  a  provision which imposes a duty on the Board\r\n\r\nto   advise   all   interested  parties   of   the\r\n\r\nproceedings before the Board, enabling  them  thus\r\n\r\nto be heard before the Board prior to the granting\r\n\r\nof  an  order  for  the possession  of  controlled\r\n\r\npremises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a landlord fail to compensate or fail to\r\n\r\ncomplete  development within the period laid  down\r\n\r\nin  the  Bill,  the  Government  may  compulsorily\r\n\r\nacquire the controlled premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statment to the Bill outlines in\r\n\r\na general way the various provisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend this Bill to Members as a useful\r\n\r\nmeasure that should contribute to the planning and\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the city area and at the same  time\r\n\r\nhave  the  long-term  effect  of  adding  to   its\r\n\r\naesthetic attractions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in\r\n\r\nfull  agreement with the spirit of the Bill as  it\r\n\r\nis  designed  to encourage and promote development\r\n\r\nin the private sector in Singapore. It is the duty\r\n\r\nof every loyal citizen to co-operate and assist in\r\n\r\nthe development of Singapore and, if need be, even\r\n\r\nto  make sacrifices. But such sacrifices should be\r\n\r\nmade  to benefit the State and not any section  of\r\n\r\nthe  community. In this respect, may  I  draw  the\r\n\r\nattention of the House to two aspects of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premises affected by the Bill are those that\r\n\r\nwere   built  before  January  1947.   Under   the\r\n\r\nprotection of the Control of Rent Ordinance  (Cap.\r\n\r\n242), the rents of these premises are considerably\r\n\r\ncheaper  than those of premises of a similar  type\r\n\r\nbuilt  after  the war. They are, in fact,  cheaper\r\n\r\nthan Housing Board premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum compensation of eight years' rent for\r\n\r\ncommercial  premises  and  six  years'  rent   for\r\n\r\nresidential premises provided in clause 7 (1)  (a)\r\n\r\nand  7  (1) (b) is anything between one-fifth  and\r\n\r\none-tenth of the current market value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, therefore, seems to benefit the\r\n\r\nlandlords immediately. My main concern is for  the\r\n\r\npoor  sub-tenants who live in cubicles or in small\r\n\r\nunits  which they rent from sub-tenants  of  chief\r\n\r\ntenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you will\r\n\r\nagree that it is difficult, if not impossible,  to\r\n\r\nexpect  these sub-tenants to get to see the  terms\r\n\r\nof tenancy made between the landlord and the chief\r\n\r\ntenants at the time when they accepted their  sub-tenancy.  In  any  negotiations  for  compensation\r\n\r\nresulting  in  awards granted by  the  Board,  the\r\n\r\nlandlord,  according to clause 9 (1) (a) ,  is  not\r\n\r\nliable to pay compensation to a sub-tenant if  the\r\n\r\ntenant  has  sublet the premises contrary  to  the\r\n\r\nterms  of  his tenancy. It seems to me  that  this\r\n\r\nclause  penalises the poor and ignorant sub-tenant\r\n\r\nwhile, in fact, it was the chief tenant who  ought\r\n\r\nto   be   penalised  for  breach  of  his  tenancy\r\n\r\nagreement. Moreover, the chief tenant will get the\r\n\r\nBoard's  award  while  the  poor  sub-tenant   may\r\n\r\npossibly  be evicted in accordance with  clause  4\r\n\r\n(6) of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I urge this House to consider the\r\n\r\nBill  with  the utmost care while encouraging  and\r\n\r\npromoting development in the private sector. Steps\r\n\r\nshould  be  taken  to ensure that  the  burden  of\r\n\r\nsacrifice,  if  sacrifice  has  to  be  made,   is\r\n\r\nequitably shared by all parties concerned and  not\r\n\r\nborne solely by the poor tenants and sub-tenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,I have no doubt that this Bill has a lot  of\r\n\r\nsalient  points  in its favour, and  most  of  the\r\n\r\nlandowners who genuinely believe in development of\r\n\r\ntheir  properties  must  hail  this  as  one  step\r\n\r\nforward   in   the   development   of   Singapore.\r\n\r\nPersonally,  I believe such a Bill has  long  been\r\n\r\noverdue.  However, I understand that it is  better\r\n\r\nlate than never.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government has managed in a relatively\r\n\r\nshort  space  of time to re-house a fifth  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation  in modern housing estates,  and  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  this is quite a record in the world.  Yet  a\r\n\r\ngood  number  of  our people are still  living  in\r\n\r\ncongested  squalor in many of the  privately-owned\r\n\r\nresidential  premises or even shophouses  in  many\r\n\r\nparts  of  our  city. I understand most  of  these\r\n\r\nresidential  premises are leased to tenants,  many\r\n\r\nof  whom exploit the shortage of accommodation  by\r\n\r\nsub-letting  as much space as is humanly  possible\r\n\r\nto  other  tenants.  These  sub-tenants  are  thus\r\n\r\ncompelled  to live in almost sub-human  conditions\r\n\r\nand  surroundings. These houses  are  therefore  a\r\n\r\nconstant  risk  to human lives in  terms  both  of\r\n\r\nhealth and fire. Sir, I am as sorry for these sub-tenants as for the owners of such properties. They\r\n\r\nare  victims of the Control of Rent Ordinance. The\r\n\r\nlaw  protects the principal tenants from  eviction\r\n\r\nand an increase in rents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Bill, although very commendable, may\r\n\r\nyet  prove to be a boom to the principal  tenants.\r\n\r\nSo  far,  these  persons  have  enjoyed  very  low\r\n\r\nrentals  and  thus saved a fortune. Many  of  them\r\n\r\nhave acquired another fortune by subletting to  as\r\n\r\nmany  persons  as  possible. Now  these  principal\r\n\r\ntenants  have  the prospects of  getting  a  third\r\n\r\nfortune,  namely, compensation for vacating  their\r\n\r\nrented  premises. Surely there must be a limit  to\r\n\r\nso   much  good  fortune  being  given  to   these\r\n\r\nprincipal  tenants.  Why must  the  landowners  or\r\n\r\nproperty owners be at the losing end all along the\r\n\r\nway? The Bill expects these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nowners to develop the properties out of their  own\r\n\r\nfunds.  I  do  hope, therefore, that the  Tenants'\r\n\r\nCompensation Board, when formed, will bear in mind\r\n\r\nthe  loss  of reasonable income by the owners  for\r\n\r\nmany  years. The amount of compensation calculated\r\n\r\nmust  be based more on what the owners can  do  in\r\n\r\nthe  development  of Singapore than  on  what  the\r\n\r\ntenants   hope   to  extract  from   society.   If\r\n\r\ncompensation  is to be paid to a principal  tenant\r\n\r\nwho  has  sublet  the house to others,  then  this\r\n\r\ncompensation   should  also   be   proportionately\r\n\r\nparcelled out to the sub-tenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see in clause 7, sub-clause (1) (a), (b)\r\n\r\nand  (c) ,  that a minimum compensation is stressed\r\n\r\nin  relationship to controlled premises. Surely if\r\n\r\nstress is made on a minimum compensation, it would\r\n\r\nbe equally fair if a possible maximum compensation\r\n\r\nis  also stressed so as to cut down demands  to  a\r\n\r\nsensible amount. Otherwise, where is the limit  to\r\n\r\ndemands by unreasonable tenants?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister why only certain areas\r\n\r\nwill  be  designated? How are these  areas  to  be\r\n\r\nearmarked?  Is  it by reason of  the  age  of  the\r\n\r\nareas, congestion, squalid conditions, ugliness or\r\n\r\ntourist  attractions? If these  are  the  reasons,\r\n\r\nthen  practically the whole city of Singapore must\r\n\r\nbe designated for re-development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I also wish to express my support\r\n\r\nfor  this  Bill,  especially  the  provisions   to\r\n\r\nestablish the Tenants' Compensation Board and  the\r\n\r\npayment of compensation to tenants before recovery\r\n\r\nof controlled premises. This Bill should have been\r\n\r\nintroduced  earlier. It is introduced  only  today\r\n\r\nbut I feel that it is still not too late yet. Past\r\n\r\nexperience  shows  that  many  people  wanting  to\r\n\r\nrecover  their  property  and  premises  exercised\r\n\r\nstringency  in  the amount of compensation  to  be\r\n\r\npaid.  Thus,  tenants normally refused  to  accept\r\n\r\nsuch compensation. They demanded more compensation\r\n\r\nand the owners refused to give in to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir demands. In the end, it usually resulted  in\r\n\r\nfights and court cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would say that the Minister is\r\n\r\njudicious in introducing certain provisions in the\r\n\r\nBill  which  will benefit many of our  people  and\r\n\r\nwhich   will   solve  many  of  our  housing   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment problems. In my opinion, many  of  our\r\n\r\nstreets  have to be extended and many  dilapidated\r\n\r\nhouses should give way to development in order  to\r\n\r\nmodernise our city. This Bill will enable this  to\r\n\r\nbe done, so I must support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.31 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

These  powers,   which   are\r\n\r\nprovided in this Bill, will be much more extensive\r\n\r\nthan  those  conferred  on the  Rent  Conciliation\r\n\r\nBoard  set up under the Control of Rent Ordinance.\r\n\r\nUnder  normal  circumstances, such  functions  and\r\n\r\npowers would have been exercised by the High Court\r\n\r\nwhich  should be the proper body for administering\r\n\r\na  statute  affecting the very serious rights  and\r\n\r\nliabilities of litigants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, examples of these wide judicial\r\n\r\npowers are -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the power to grant orders for the recovery\r\n\r\nof possession of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controlled premises under clauses 4 (3) and\r\n\r\n11 of the Bill;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the power to enforce execution of the Board's\r\n\r\norder under clause 4 (6) of the Bill;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the power to award compensation under clause\r\n\r\n6 (12) which will far exceed the powers of a civil\r\n\r\nDistrict Judge;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) orders of the Board cannot be challenged\r\n\r\neither  by  appeal  or by prerogative  writs\r\n\r\neven  where  there have been blatant  errors\r\n\r\nof  the  law  or  even where the  Board  has\r\n\r\nacted ultra vires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Even  in the case of the lesser powers exercisable\r\n\r\nby  the  Rent  Conciliation Board, the Legislature\r\n\r\nhad wisely seen fit to make the proceedings before\r\n\r\nthe  Board judicial proceedings. I would  strongly\r\n\r\nrecommend  that, in view of this, section  8  (4),\r\n\r\n(5),  (6),  (7),  and (8) of the Control  of  Rent\r\n\r\nOrdinance ought to be adopted as parts of clause 6\r\n\r\nof this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to draw attention to clause 6\r\n\r\n(10)  of  the Bill which intends to allow  a  non-qualified person to appear before the Board. I  am\r\n\r\nnot  a protagonist of a closed-shop policy insofar\r\n\r\nas lawyers are concerned. But having regard to the\r\n\r\ngravity  of  the issues which would be before  the\r\n\r\nBoard  and the need to make the Board observe  the\r\n\r\nprinciples  inherent  in judicial  proceedings,  I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest  that all persons appearing  before\r\n\r\nthe  Board  should  be  practising  advocates  and\r\n\r\nsolicitors. They are not only capable of assisting\r\n\r\nthe  Board  in  a judicial manner,  but  are  also\r\n\r\nsubject to disciplinary proceedings if they should\r\n\r\nfail  to observe the rules of professional conduct\r\n\r\nand    the   regulations   applicable   to    such\r\n\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 (3) of the Bill seeks to define the\r\n\r\nexpression  \"commercial purposes\" and \"residential\r\n\r\npurposes\".  The  Bill  has  overlooked,  it  would\r\n\r\nappear,  cases  where controlled premises  may  be\r\n\r\nused both for commercial and residential\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurposes.  It  is, therefore, suggested  that  the\r\n\r\nHouse  should consider how compensation should  be\r\n\r\nawarded  in cases where the premises are used  for\r\n\r\nthese mixed purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One views with concern the provisions of clause\r\n\r\n15  (3) of the Bill making the order of the  Board\r\n\r\nnot  only final but beyond challenge of any appeal\r\n\r\nor  prerogative  writs  even  though  the  Board's\r\n\r\njudgment may be tainted with error in law or  made\r\n\r\nin lack of jurisdiction. I feel that this proposal\r\n\r\nshould  be deleted and the provisions of  sections\r\n\r\n11,  12  and  13 of the Control of Rent  Ordinance\r\n\r\nshould be substituted in its place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above this, I would support the intent\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill  which  I think  is  timely  if  the\r\n\r\neconomic  development  of  Singapore  is  to  move\r\n\r\napace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

With the passage of this Bill  I  think\r\n\r\nmany  developers will be able to take part in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's urban renewal programme. In the  long\r\n\r\nrun  this Bill will bring about a better and  more\r\n\r\naesthetic  looking  city.  It  will  resolve  many\r\n\r\nproblems,  such  as  the  congestion  in   certain\r\n\r\nstreets  and  areas.  There  will  also  be   more\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities and economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can say that the persons who drafted this Bill\r\n\r\nhave  done  their best to look after the interests\r\n\r\nof both land-owners and tenants. But some people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsider that the compensation stipulated  in  the\r\n\r\nBill  to  be  paid to tenants and  sub-tenants  is\r\n\r\nrather  low.  Take, for instance, the  case  of  a\r\n\r\nthree-storey building. If the premises come  under\r\n\r\nthe  Rent  Control Ordinance, then the rent  would\r\n\r\nnormally be not more than $150 per month.  If  the\r\n\r\npremises  are used for residential purposes,  then\r\n\r\nunder  the Bill the tenant can only get a  minimum\r\n\r\nof  150  times  12 times $6, namely,  $10,800.  If\r\n\r\nthere   are  three  tenants  occupying  the   same\r\n\r\nbuilding, then each household will be getting only\r\n\r\n$3,600.  That is not too bad. But, in fact,  these\r\n\r\npremises would normally have been in existence for\r\n\r\nquite  a long time and not many people are staying\r\n\r\nin  the  same building. So each household will  be\r\n\r\ngetting only a very meagre sum as compensation. In\r\n\r\naddition  to  this, they will have to  move  house\r\n\r\nwithin   a  short  time.  So  there  is  a   great\r\n\r\ndifference  between the benefit they  can  get  as\r\n\r\ncompensation and the loss they will have to  incur\r\n\r\nand the inconvenience suffered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my calculation, the situation is\r\n\r\nlike  this. If the law is put into effect, I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Tenants'  Compensation  Board  will  consider\r\n\r\nevery case with sympathy and consideration and not\r\n\r\nstick  always to the minimum rate of compensation.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  the sub-tenants and sub-sub-tenants  in\r\n\r\nthe building should be given due consideration. We\r\n\r\nall  remember that during the years of the  Second\r\n\r\nWorld  War when there was a housing shortage  many\r\n\r\nchief  tenants  made  use of  the  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nexploit their sub-tenants and extract money out of\r\n\r\nthem.  They disregarded the Rent Control Ordinance\r\n\r\nand other relevant laws, if any.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the law in existence up till now, no\r\n\r\nprotection  whatsoever  is given  to  sub-tenants.\r\n\r\nAlthough  according  to  the  proposed  Bill  sub-tenants  may get some compensation from the  chief\r\n\r\ntenants, many members of the public think that the\r\n\r\nprotection  and the benefits given to  sub-tenants\r\n\r\nunder this Bill are not sufficient. I feel that in\r\n\r\nstipulating  the compensation to be given  by  the\r\n\r\nBoard to the chief tenant, consideration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould also be given to the amount of compensation\r\n\r\nto be given to the sub-tenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the amount necessary for the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  premises,  the  Bill   does   not\r\n\r\nstipulate a maximum. It is therefore not  possible\r\n\r\nto assess the position. But the Bill provides that\r\n\r\nwhen an application is made for the development of\r\n\r\npremises,  the  owner has to  prove  that  he  has\r\n\r\nsufficient  funds to develop the site and  furnish\r\n\r\nthe   necessary  funds.  This  is  what  the  Bill\r\n\r\nstipulates. But this is not very clear and I  hope\r\n\r\nthat   when   the  Bill  is  referred  to   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, a more definite picture on this  matter\r\n\r\ncan  emerge and more clear cut provisions will  be\r\n\r\nput into the Bill. I hope also that the Board will\r\n\r\nbe given a clear picture in regard to this matter,\r\n\r\nespecially  when  there is no appeal  against  the\r\n\r\nfinal decision of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I merely wish to bring up a small point. I am\r\n\r\nsure  the  Minister is well aware that  there  are\r\n\r\ntenants,  or more precisely occupiers,  who  enjoy\r\n\r\nphysical occupation of the controlled premises and\r\n\r\npay  their  rent under the names of  the  previous\r\n\r\ntenants from whom they have taken over the tenancy\r\n\r\nright.  There are, of course, cases of assignments\r\n\r\nor  transfers  effected without the knowledge  and\r\n\r\nconsent  of  the  landlord.  But  there  are  also\r\n\r\ninstances  of  occupiers  who  are  relatives   or\r\n\r\nsurviving   members   of  the  deceased   tenants.\r\n\r\nAccording to the provisions of clauses 10, 11  and\r\n\r\n12  of  the  Bill, I presume - and I  stand  to  be\r\n\r\ncorrected,  Sir  -  that such  occupiers  will  be\r\n\r\nclassified  as trespassers and that they  will  be\r\n\r\npaid  only ex-gratia payments. It would  be  gross\r\n\r\ninjustice  to treat these occupiers as trespassers\r\n\r\nsimply   because  they  do  not  have  a   tenancy\r\n\r\nagreement with the landlord in their own names.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would request the Minister to look into\r\n\r\nthis   problem   and   introduce   some   remedial\r\n\r\nprovisions  to  protect  the  interest  of   these\r\n\r\noccupiers.  Notwithstanding what I  have  said,  I\r\n\r\nsupport this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave  no complaint against the intent of the Bill.\r\n\r\nThe  objectives  attempted by  it  are  worthy  of\r\n\r\nsupport  by  both the landlords and  the  tenants.\r\n\r\nThere  is no doubt that Singapore needs very rapid\r\n\r\ndevelopment. There is even less doubt that one  of\r\n\r\nthe  major causes retarding development  has  been\r\n\r\nthe  operation  of the Control of  Rent  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwhich, for over 20 years, has pegged rents at such\r\n\r\nunrealistic levels so that slums remain slums. The\r\n\r\nexistence of the Control of Rent Ordinance for  so\r\n\r\nlong  has  also resulted in abuses and  inequities\r\n\r\nbeing  deeply entrenched and interwoven  into  our\r\n\r\nsocial  and  economic system. Therefore,  while  I\r\n\r\napplaud  the  Government  for  the  bold  move  to\r\n\r\nrectify an ancient ill, I must, at the same  time,\r\n\r\nsound a note of caution as to the possible adverse\r\n\r\nrepercussions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many tenancies of rent controlled premises have\r\n\r\nchanged  hands  many times and,  quite  frequently\r\n\r\nwith the knowledge and connivance of the landlord,\r\n\r\nat  very  high premiums. For instance, it  is  not\r\n\r\nunknown that certain premises along the busy parts\r\n\r\nof  North Bridge Road have changed hands with  tea\r\n\r\nmoney  paid out as high as $100,000. If  the  last\r\n\r\ntenant  who  paid this huge sum  of  money  for  a\r\n\r\ntenancy of the premises is evicted, it will  be  a\r\n\r\nvery    difficult   problem   for   the    Tenants\r\n\r\nCompensation  Board to determine the right  amount\r\n\r\nof compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is required to award a fair and\r\n\r\nreasonable sum, but this sum will not be less than\r\n\r\neight  years' rent paid for the premises. Assuming\r\n\r\nthat  the  Board  has found it  a  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nlandlord  has taken tea money -and this is  always\r\n\r\nvery  difficult to prove, although  it  is  highly\r\n\r\ninconceivable that any landlord would have allowed\r\n\r\na  change of tenancy if his palm were not  greased\r\n\r\nwith  money,  is the Board in a position  to  take\r\n\r\ninto  account  the  landlord's share  of  the  tea\r\n\r\nmoney? If not, will not the landlord get an unfair\r\n\r\nadvantage? Even if the Board can take into account\r\n\r\nthe landlord's share of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntea  money,  it can at best take into account  the\r\n\r\nlast  tenancy  transfer, as it is highly  unlikely\r\n\r\nthat  earlier tenants can be traced or, if traced,\r\n\r\nwill volunteer information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many instances, the tea money paid by the last\r\n\r\ntenant, partly to the landlord and partly  to  the\r\n\r\nprevious  tenant, represents a sizable investment,\r\n\r\nand probably almost his entire capital will, as it\r\n\r\nwere,  be  gone and replaced only fractionally  by\r\n\r\nthe  Board's award. How many such businesses owned\r\n\r\nby  such tenants will be adversely affected  I  do\r\n\r\nnot pretend to be able to guess. But I should like\r\n\r\nthose charged with declaring an area as designated\r\n\r\nfor development, or with the onerous duties of the\r\n\r\nBoard, to bear in mind that brand-new shopping and\r\n\r\nbusiness  premises will mean very  little  if  the\r\n\r\nbusinesses  that are expected to occupy  them  are\r\n\r\nmade  bankrupt  by  the process  of  building  the\r\n\r\npremises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I make these observations fully conscious of\r\n\r\nthe  provisions contained in clause 7 (2)  of  the\r\n\r\nBill,  which  allows the Board to give  regard  to\r\n\r\ngoodwill,  probable loss of income, disruption  of\r\n\r\nbusiness, cost of removal, etc. The basic fact  is\r\n\r\nthat if the award comes anywhere near the tenant's\r\n\r\nexpectations,  the need for this  Bill  would  not\r\n\r\nhave  arisen because the tenant would have already\r\n\r\ncome  to  an agreement with the landlord. But  the\r\n\r\nvery nature of this Bill is to enable the landlord\r\n\r\nto  recover  premises which  he  cannot  do  under\r\n\r\nexisting conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nfeel in all sincerity that the Government must  be\r\n\r\ncommended  for  this  very sensible  Bill  on  the\r\n\r\nrecovery  of  possession  of  controlled  premises\r\n\r\ndesigned  to encourage and promote development  in\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector in Singapore. The  Government\r\n\r\nhas,   of  late,  placed  much  emphasis  on   the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  incentives  to  accelerate   the\r\n\r\nindustrial   and  economic  development   of   our\r\n\r\ncountry.

But such changes\r\n\r\nmust be made with the least possible hardship  and\r\n\r\nin  the  most  fair and equitable  manner  to  all\r\n\r\nclasses of people, be they capitalists or workers,\r\n\r\nlandlords or tenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is in this Bill an elaborate list of\r\n\r\nprovisions to ensure that a landlord claiming land\r\n\r\nmust  have  a  sincere intention  to  develop  the\r\n\r\nproperty. There is a heavy penalty - which is  the\r\n\r\ncompulsory acquisition of the controlled  premises\r\n\r\nby  Government - should a landlord after  recovery\r\n\r\nof  the  premises fail to complete its development\r\n\r\nwithin   a   prescribed  period.  The   safeguards\r\n\r\nprovided  in  this  Bill  against  abuses  by  the\r\n\r\nlandlord are indeed quite complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also heartening to note that fairly\r\n\r\nadequate   provisions  have   been   proposed   to\r\n\r\ncompensate tenants affected by this Bill. I  refer\r\n\r\nto  the  proposed  establishment of  the  Tenants'\r\n\r\nCompensation  Board,  the minimum  payment  of  at\r\n\r\nleast  six years' and eight years' rent to evicted\r\n\r\ntenants   of  residential  and  business  premises\r\n\r\nrespectively.  And there are also  provisions  for\r\n\r\ncompensation  for loss of goodwill, disruption  of\r\n\r\nbusiness,  etc. I am, however, quite  ignorant  of\r\n\r\nthe basis upon which the Government has arrived at\r\n\r\nthe  decision  to pay a minimum of six  and  eight\r\n\r\nyears' rent to tenants of residential and business\r\n\r\npremises  respectively. I  will  be  glad  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Law  and National  Development  can\r\n\r\nenlighten me on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of evicted tenants, may I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that these persons be given  priority  to\r\n\r\nmove  back to their original area of residence  or\r\n\r\nbusiness,  if such is possible, after  development\r\n\r\nof  the  area has been completed? There  are  some\r\n\r\nwho,  I  believe, for good reasons would prefer  a\r\n\r\ntemporary  rather than a permanent uprooting  from\r\n\r\ntheir original area of tenancy. Certain areas, for\r\n\r\nexample,   are   strategic  areas   for   business\r\n\r\noperations enabling lower transportation costs and\r\n\r\nwithin  convenient reach of many other  facilities\r\n\r\nif  these amenities still exist after development.\r\n\r\nThere  is no reason to deny priority to those  who\r\n\r\noriginally enjoyed them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I further wish to suggest a more comprehensive\r\n\r\nprocedure  to  deal with claims  from  tenants  of\r\n\r\nbusiness   houses.   Such   claims   may   involve\r\n\r\nsubstantial amounts and can be highly complicated.\r\n\r\nAs  such,  I do not feel that the rulings  of  the\r\n\r\nTenants'  Compensation  Board  can  adequately  do\r\n\r\njustice.  To be fair, it is my contention  that  a\r\n\r\ndissatisfied tenant should have option  to  appeal\r\n\r\nto a higher authority, preferably to a civil court\r\n\r\nof law. This will certainly act as a counter-check\r\n\r\nto  the  rulings of the Board and justice will  be\r\n\r\nmore fully ensured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

In  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, we will not only receive the  views  of\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  House but, what  is  even  more\r\n\r\nimportant,  the  written  representations  of  the\r\n\r\npublic. And if landlords or tenants wish to appear\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore the Committee, they will be most welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But perhaps I can here deal with some of the\r\n\r\nsalient points raised by hon. Members. One or  two\r\n\r\nMembers   are   not  very  conversant   with   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Control of Rent Ordinance. These\r\n\r\nare,  I  am  afraid, rather complicated provisions\r\n\r\nand even some lawyers do not understand them. Many\r\n\r\nhon.  Members were concerned with the position  of\r\n\r\nthe  sub-tenant or the sub-sub-tenant.  Under  the\r\n\r\nControl  of  Rent Ordinance, the landlord  of  the\r\n\r\npremises is the landlord of the principal  tenant.\r\n\r\nBut  the principal tenant is the landlord  of  the\r\n\r\nsub-tenant. And the sub-tenant is the landlord  of\r\n\r\nthe  sub-sub-tenant, and so on.  But,  of  course,\r\n\r\nthere  are  persons who are, in legal terminology,\r\n\r\ntrespassers and some are merely licensees. I  will\r\n\r\nnot bother hon. Members with the legal definitions\r\n\r\nof who is a tenant and who is a licensee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our problem here has been to find a quick method\r\n\r\nof evicting tenants, sub-tenants, sub-sub-tenants,\r\n\r\nlicensees  and  trespassers by  paying  those  who\r\n\r\ndeserve compensation a reasonable compensation and\r\n\r\nallowing  the  landlord to rebuild as  quickly  as\r\n\r\npossible. In law, the trespasser is in a very weak\r\n\r\nposition.  He trespasses. He should not be  there.\r\n\r\nWhy  should  he be paid? A licensee, on reasonable\r\n\r\nnotice,  must  vacate. It is only when  a  tenancy\r\n\r\nexists that the protection of the Control of  Rent\r\n\r\nOrdinance  comes into force. These are all  rather\r\n\r\ncomplicated  problems. And it is no  use  evicting\r\n\r\nonly  tenants and sub-tenants without  getting  an\r\n\r\norder  against  licensees and trespassers  because\r\n\r\nthen  you  will  have to go to the High  Court  to\r\n\r\nevict trespassers and licensees. It will be a long\r\n\r\ntime  before you get judgment in your  favour  and\r\n\r\nthere can be appeal after appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Member for Bukit Panjang, who is a lawyer\r\n\r\nhimself  and  who understands these problems,  has\r\n\r\nmade  many  important points. He is worried  about\r\n\r\nthe  order  of the Board being a final  order.  He\r\n\r\nwants  an appeal at least on a question of law.  I\r\n\r\nwould\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagree  that,  as far as the amount of compensation\r\n\r\nis concerned, there should be no appeal as in land\r\n\r\nacquisition cases. But when there is an  issue  as\r\n\r\nto  whether a man is a tenant or a licensee  or  a\r\n\r\ntrespasser, then the Board may slip up. But  these\r\n\r\nare  matters which the Select Committee  can  deal\r\n\r\nwith.  I am sure the legal profession itself  will\r\n\r\nmake representations, if not similar then somewhat\r\n\r\non  the same lines as have been made by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Bukit Panjang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for compensation, in my opening speech I said\r\n\r\nthat  the formula was not a perfect formula and  I\r\n\r\nwould  be happy if any Member in this House  could\r\n\r\nsuggest  or devise a perfect formula. Roughly,  we\r\n\r\nwork  on  the  lines that reasonable  compensation\r\n\r\nwould  be  somewhat equivalent to  the  tea  money\r\n\r\nwhich is being paid in Singapore for a transfer of\r\n\r\nthe  tenancy  or for the surrender of  possession.\r\n\r\nBut,  obviously,  even the  amount  of  tea  money\r\n\r\nvaries.  You  pay  more  tea  money  for  business\r\n\r\npremises than for a residence. Hence eight  years'\r\n\r\nrent   for  business  and  six  years'  rent   for\r\n\r\nresidential premises. But this will vary not  only\r\n\r\nfrom  business to business but also from place  to\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Joo Chiat wants to know why we do\r\n\r\nnot declare the whole island a designated area. To\r\n\r\ndo that would raise even a bigger howl. I think it\r\n\r\nwould  be  best  that  we proceed  cautiously  and\r\n\r\ndesignate only certain areas as a start,  probably\r\n\r\nthe  area within a mile of Raffles Place.  I  say,\r\n\r\n\"for a start\" and, then we go on. The areas to  be\r\n\r\ndesignated will be designated by the Minister but,\r\n\r\nof  course, on the recommendations of his planners\r\n\r\nand  other  urban renewal experts. When the  Board\r\n\r\nfirst  starts to sit, we do not want to  flood  it\r\n\r\nwith so many applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for Anson,\r\n\r\nwho  is not here, raised certain questions of  law\r\n\r\nas  to  why  sub-tenants who under  the  principal\r\n\r\ntenancy should not have gone into the premises are\r\n\r\nbarred    by    this   Ordinance   from    getting\r\n\r\ncompensation; for even\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder  the Control of Rent Ordinance, the landlord\r\n\r\ncan  recover possession of the premises  from  his\r\n\r\nprincipal  tenant if under the principal  contract\r\n\r\nof  tenancy,  subletting  is  prohibited  and  the\r\n\r\nprincipal  tenant  sublets. It  is  a  contractual\r\n\r\nobligation  which, if broken, gives  the  landlord\r\n\r\ncertain remedies. If I let out my house to you  on\r\n\r\ncondition  that you do not let it  out  to  anyone\r\n\r\nelse,  and  you  do,  well, you  are  looking  for\r\n\r\ntrouble. And so is that somebody else who takes it\r\n\r\nfrom you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think I need say much\r\n\r\nmore  except  that  I should  put  on  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  Members of this House  who  have  shown\r\n\r\nsuch great interest in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That the Bill be committed to Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  consisting of Mr Speaker  as  Chairman\r\n\r\nand seven Members as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr E.

Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law in force at present in Singapore relating\r\n\r\nto  patents  is  contained in the Registration  of\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom Patents Ordinance (Cap. 181)  which\r\n\r\nprovides  for  the registration  in  Singapore  of\r\n\r\npatents  granted  in  the  United  Kingdom.   Such\r\n\r\nregistration   confers   privileges   and   rights\r\n\r\nrelating to the invention similar in all respects\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  those conferred by the issue of the patent  in\r\n\r\nthe   United  Kingdom.  There  are,  however,   no\r\n\r\nprovisions  in our Ordinance to require  patentees\r\n\r\nto  work their inventions in Singapore. There  are\r\n\r\nalso  no  provisions empowering the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nPatents  in Singapore to grant compulsory licences\r\n\r\nfor  the making, using, exercising and vending  of\r\n\r\npatented  inventions in Singapore. The  result  is\r\n\r\nthat  owners  of patents registered  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nhave  in  most  cases not bothered to  work  their\r\n\r\ninventions  in  Singapore.  This  is  particularly\r\n\r\nevident  in  the field of patented  medicines  and\r\n\r\ndrugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand for patented medicines in Singapore,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  can  only be met by importation  which\r\n\r\nhas caused a substantial loss in foreign exchange.\r\n\r\nAn   analysis  of  major  patented  pharmaceutical\r\n\r\nproducts purchased by private consumers shows that\r\n\r\nthere  would  be a saving in foreign  exchange  of\r\n\r\nabout  $2  million per year if local manufacturers\r\n\r\nare   permitted  to  manufacture  patented  drugs.\r\n\r\nImportant   drugs,   which  if   manufactured   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  can be made available at  lower  costs,\r\n\r\nare being imported and sold to local consumers  at\r\n\r\nhigher  prices.  In order to make  available  such\r\n\r\ndrugs  to the public at reasonable prices  and  in\r\n\r\norder  to  develop our pharmaceutical industry,  a\r\n\r\nsystem   of   compulsory  licensing  is   urgently\r\n\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A compulsory licence is an authorisation given by\r\n\r\na  competent authority to a person other than  the\r\n\r\nowner  of  the  patent  to  make,  sell,  use  and\r\n\r\nexercise  the  patented product  even  though  the\r\n\r\nbeneficiary  of  the  compulsory  licence  has  no\r\n\r\nauthorisation  from  the  owner  of  the   patent.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the laws of many countries  provide  for\r\n\r\ncompulsory licences, in actual fact, the number of\r\n\r\ncases  in which these provisions have been invoked\r\n\r\nare relatively few. This is no indication that the\r\n\r\nsystem of compulsory licences has not attained the\r\n\r\nmain  objective  for which it  was  created.  This\r\n\r\nobjective is to cause the working of the patented\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvention in the country. If the owner of a patent\r\n\r\ndoes  not work his invention or hesitates to grant\r\n\r\ncontractual licences on reasonable terms, the mere\r\n\r\nfact  that  the  law  empowers  the  granting   of\r\n\r\ncompulsory  licences for the  manufacture  of  his\r\n\r\ninvention  will  usually  induce  him   to   grant\r\n\r\nlicences by contract on reasonable terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill in clauses 3 and 5\r\n\r\nempowers   the  Registrar  of  Patents  to   grant\r\n\r\ncompulsory  licences  in respect  of  the  making,\r\n\r\nusing,   exercising   and  vending   of   patented\r\n\r\ninventions  concerned with food or medicine  or  a\r\n\r\nsurgical  or curative device and also  on  certain\r\n\r\ngrounds  -  in  respect of classes  of  inventions\r\n\r\nlisted  in  the  Schedule to the  Bill.  Clause  5\r\n\r\nhowever  provides  that the  Registrar  shall  not\r\n\r\ngrant  a  licence in respect of a  patented  food,\r\n\r\nmedicine  or  surgical or curative device  if  the\r\n\r\npatentee   satisfies  him  that  he  has   already\r\n\r\nestablished  or is about to establish an  industry\r\n\r\nin Singapore for the making of such food, medicine\r\n\r\nor surgical or curative device.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registrar is empowered in clause 7 to revoke\r\n\r\na  patent  under certain circumstances  two  years\r\n\r\nafter  he has granted a licence to manufacture  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  the  invention  to  which  the   patent\r\n\r\nrelates.   These  provisions  are   necessary   to\r\n\r\nencourage   the  commercial  working   of   recent\r\n\r\ninventions  in  Singapore  and  will  benefit  our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  programme.  The  Minister  will\r\n\r\nhave power to add to the list in the said Schedule\r\n\r\nas and when required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 10, the Registrar is empowered, where\r\n\r\nthe  patentee and the licensee are unable to agree\r\n\r\non  the amount of the royalty or compensation,  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  the  amount of royalty or  compensation\r\n\r\npayable to the patentee under a compulsory licence\r\n\r\nbut  such royalty or compensation shall not exceed\r\n\r\nten  per cent of the net ex-factory sale price  in\r\n\r\nbulk of the patented article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that the rights conferred\r\n\r\nby a patent shall not be deemed to be infringed by\r\n\r\nthe  making,  importation or obtaining  by  or  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the Government of any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npatented medicine or drug for distribution or  use\r\n\r\nin  any  dispensary,  hospital  or  other  medical\r\n\r\ninstitution  maintained by or  on  behalf  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment or otherwise specified by the  Minister\r\n\r\nby notification in the Gazette. The patentee shall\r\n\r\nbe   notified  by  the  Government  as   soon   as\r\n\r\npracticable of such making or user and in  default\r\n\r\nof  any  agreement  between the patentee  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, the Registrar may determine the amount\r\n\r\nof   royalty  or  compensation  payable   to   the\r\n\r\npatentee,  but such royalty or compensation  shall\r\n\r\nnot  exceed  five per cent of the  net  ex-factory\r\n\r\nsale price in bulk of the patented article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An appeal lies against any decision of the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  to  an Appeal Tribunal to  be  presided\r\n\r\nover by a Judge of the High Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I must emphasise that it is not\r\n\r\nthe purpose of this Bill to deprive any person  of\r\n\r\nhis  rights  under a patent.

In theory no  state  can  be\r\n\r\ncalled  upon to enforce through its tribunals  the\r\n\r\npenal laws of other states, or to try a person for\r\n\r\nan  offence alleged to have been committed  beyond\r\n\r\nits  frontiers, if a man commits a crime in China,\r\n\r\nyou  do  not try him in Singapore, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThe principles of the independence and sovereignty\r\n\r\nof   each   country  militate  against  any   such\r\n\r\nobligation. It has, however, for a long time  been\r\n\r\nrecognised  by various states that it  is  not  in\r\n\r\ntheir interest to afford refuge to criminals  from\r\n\r\nother  countries. On the contrary, it is in  their\r\n\r\ninterests  to  return  the fugitive  criminal  for\r\n\r\ntrial  and  punishment to the state in  which  the\r\n\r\noffence was committed or in which the criminal was\r\n\r\nconvicted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involving, therefore, as it does the extension of\r\n\r\nthe  criminal jurisdiction of one state beyond its\r\n\r\nown  territorial  limits into  those  of  another,\r\n\r\nextradition   forms,  at  the  present   day,   an\r\n\r\nimportant    and   integral   part    of    Public\r\n\r\nInternational  Law,  and is as  such,  apart  from\r\n\r\ninternational  comity,  generally   regulated   by\r\n\r\nmutual  arrangement or treaty between the  various\r\n\r\nstates.  Most  states  in the  modern  world  have\r\n\r\nextradition laws in force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these few remarks, I will now survey the\r\n\r\nhistorical  background to the existing extradition\r\n\r\nlaws in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Laws have been derived from two English\r\n\r\nStatutes  -  the  Extradition  Act,  1870,   which\r\n\r\napplies  to  extradition to foreign countries  and\r\n\r\nthe Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881, which applies to\r\n\r\nextradition  among  Commonwealth  countries.  Both\r\n\r\nthese Statutes have outlived their usefulness. Not\r\n\r\nonly  is  their  continued existence  incompatible\r\n\r\nwith  the  independent  and  sovereign  status  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  but also, since they belong to  another\r\n\r\nage,   they  fail  to  take  into  account  modern\r\n\r\nconcepts  that have now become part of extradition\r\n\r\nlaws in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommonwealth. For example, they do not provide for\r\n\r\na  state to refuse extradition of a person who  is\r\n\r\nto  be charged with or surrendered for a political\r\n\r\noffence   or   for  an  offence  of  a   political\r\n\r\ncharacter. Apart from anything else, it is clearly\r\n\r\nright and proper that Singapore should now be able\r\n\r\nof  its  own  accord  to  enter  into  extradition\r\n\r\ntreaties  with foreign states though the  treaties\r\n\r\nalready made by the United Kingdom and Malaysia on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of Singapore will continue to apply  until\r\n\r\nsuch  time  as  the Government decides  that  they\r\n\r\nshould cease so to apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Commonwealth countries there will\r\n\r\nbe  no necessity to enter into bilateral treaties,\r\n\r\nfor a common scheme for extradition was agreed  to\r\n\r\nat  the Commonwealth Law Ministers Conference held\r\n\r\nin  May  1966,  in London at which  I  represented\r\n\r\nSingapore. It was agreed at that meeting that this\r\n\r\ncommon  scheme  should apply to  all  Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncountries and is to be included in the legislation\r\n\r\nof  each  country; though this does  not  preclude\r\n\r\nmodification  of  the general  scheme  in  certain\r\n\r\ncircumstances. The common scheme, which  has  been\r\n\r\nwritten  into this Bill, is significant  since  it\r\n\r\nincorporates a revised list of agreed extraditable\r\n\r\noffences,  which  will have application  not  only\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to extradition as between  Singapore\r\n\r\nand   other  Commonwealth  countries,   but   also\r\n\r\n(subject  to  treaty)  as  between  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nforeign states. For the sake of clarity, I  should\r\n\r\nmention at this point that the distinction that is\r\n\r\nmade  in  the  United  Kingdom  Acts  between  the\r\n\r\nexpression \"extradition\" as applying to  surrender\r\n\r\nof fugitive criminals among independent states and\r\n\r\nthe   expression  \"fugitive  offenders\"  as  being\r\n\r\nrestricted  to  cases  of  surrender  as   between\r\n\r\ndifferent  parts of the British Commonwealth,  now\r\n\r\ndisappears. Indeed, as the Bill makes  clear,  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  dealing  with  surrender  to   foreign\r\n\r\nstates  follow  much  the same  pattern  as  those\r\n\r\ndealing with surrender to Commonwealth countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Members will notice that the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom Acts to which I have referred  are\r\n\r\nrepealed  by  this proposed legislation.  It  will\r\n\r\nfurther  be  observed that the Malaysian  Warrants\r\n\r\nand  Summons  (Special Provisions) Act,  1965,  is\r\n\r\nalso  repealed. The reason for this  is  that  the\r\n\r\nsame  ground  is covered by Part  V  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\ndealing  with  extradition to and  from  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThis   Part  provides  a  simple  and  expeditious\r\n\r\nprocedure  for  the  return of fugitive  offenders\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore  to Malaysia. It is  the  sort  of\r\n\r\nsimplified   procedure  as  between   neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries that was envisaged in the common scheme.\r\n\r\nMalaysia  in  its Commonwealth Fugitive  Criminals\r\n\r\nAct,   1967   (No.  54  of  1967)   has   included\r\n\r\ncorresponding provisions. These provisions provide\r\n\r\nfor  Magistrates  to  issue  or  endorse  warrants\r\n\r\nrather  than the more complicated \"requisition  to\r\n\r\nMinister\"  procedure laid down  for  surrender  of\r\n\r\nfugitives   to   foreign  and  other  Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncountries.  They also extend to a wider  range  of\r\n\r\noffences  than is the case with foreign and  other\r\n\r\nCommonwealth countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement to the Bill describes\r\n\r\nin   some   detail  the  nature  of  the   various\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  the Bill and I do not  propose  to\r\n\r\nelaborate on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I would, for the information of\r\n\r\nMembers, mention that enabling legislation  giving\r\n\r\neffect  to  the  common scheme  has  already  been\r\n\r\nenacted  in  the  United  Kingdom,  Australia  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia - there may well be others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a very\r\n\r\ninteresting  Bill and I must commend it.  For  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time in a very long while, we have  a  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  is  really well drafted. Over the ages  all\r\n\r\nover  the world two principles have contested with\r\n\r\neach   other  for  final  expression.   Both   are\r\n\r\ncivilised principles. One, of course, is  that  no\r\n\r\nstate must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallow  its  territory to be used as  a  haven  for\r\n\r\ncommon criminals. The second one, especially after\r\n\r\nthe   French  Revolution,  is  that  no  political\r\n\r\noffender  should be extradited. Even to  this  day\r\n\r\nthe  battle between these two principles  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  finally resolved. I am glad to note that  we\r\n\r\nhave  made  adequate provisions in  this  Bill  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard   political  offenders   who   come   to\r\n\r\nSingapore and find haven here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are, however, a few\r\n\r\nprovisions  which  I  would like  to  consider  in\r\n\r\ndetail,  at least for the purpose of rationalising\r\n\r\nthe  faults.  We have three clauses -  clause  26,\r\n\r\nclause  37  and clause 45 of the Bill.  All  these\r\n\r\nthree  clauses  deal  with  an  order  made  by  a\r\n\r\nmagistrate for committal. If the committed  person\r\n\r\nis  not happy with the order of the magistrate, he\r\n\r\nhas got two different types of redress. Clause  37\r\n\r\ndeals  with  Malaysia. It lays down  that  if  the\r\n\r\ncommitted  person is not satisfied with the  order\r\n\r\nof  the  magistrate he can make an application  to\r\n\r\nthe  High  Court.  It is a very simple  procedure.\r\n\r\nWhereas clause 12, dealing with a foreign country,\r\n\r\nand   clause   26,  dealing  with  a  Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncountry, lay down that he can bring the matter  up\r\n\r\nin  the High Court by way of habeas corpus proceedings.  I  do  not  see  logically  why  we  should\r\n\r\nmaintain  this  difference in this  Bill.  If  the\r\n\r\nprocedure  in  clause 37 is the more rational  and\r\n\r\nsimple,  then, of course, it should apply  to  the\r\n\r\nother  two clauses as well. Or, on the other hand,\r\n\r\nif  the habeas corpus procedure is a simpler  one,\r\n\r\nthen, of course, it should be made to apply  to  a\r\n\r\nMalaysian  offender  as well.  It  may  not  be  a\r\n\r\nfundamental point, Mr Speaker, Sir, but  I  think\r\n\r\nit  will make for clarity and symmetry in the  law\r\n\r\nif this can be rationalised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 45 gives the Minister the power to vary\r\n\r\nthe Schedules of this Bill and I am very concerned\r\n\r\nwith  the  First  Schedule  which  lays  down  the\r\n\r\nvarious  offences  for which an  offender  can  be\r\n\r\nextradited. What I am concerned with  is  that  in\r\n\r\nmaking a variation, we should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that  a  person  who  is  already   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  having committed an offence  which  is\r\n\r\nnot covered by the Schedule, should not be brought\r\n\r\nunder  this  purview merely by  a  change  in  the\r\n\r\nSchedule itself. These are the small points  which\r\n\r\nI really want to discuss, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make one other point. I notice\r\n\r\nthat in this Bill and in one other Bill, there  is\r\n\r\nan index laid out. I notice that most of the other\r\n\r\nBills  that  have  been brought before  Parliament\r\n\r\nfrom time to time do not have an index at all. Can\r\n\r\nI  make  a  suggestion, Sir? In future, all  Bills\r\n\r\nshould have indexes like this because it makes  it\r\n\r\nsimpler for reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr  Tang See Chim and other hon. Members:</b>  Hear,\r\n\r\nhear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did say in my\r\n\r\nopening speech that Part V of the Bill deals  with\r\n\r\nextradition  to and from Malaysia and  provides  a\r\n\r\nsimple and expeditious procedure for the return of\r\n\r\nfugitive offenders from Singapore to Malaysia.  As\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Bukit Panjang well knows, we  were\r\n\r\nnot   very  long  ago  a  part  of  Malaysia.  For\r\n\r\nhistorical reasons, we are more closely  connected\r\n\r\nwith Malaysia than with other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as foreign countries are concerned, it is\r\n\r\nnot  so  easy to come to some extradition  treaty.\r\n\r\nHence the difference between the procedure for the\r\n\r\nextradition   of  fugitives  from   Singapore   to\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  those to and from Commonwealth  and\r\n\r\nforeign  countries. The procedure for  extradition\r\n\r\nas between Commonwealth countries was agreed to at\r\n\r\nthe  London Law Conference which I mentioned.  The\r\n\r\nprocedure  for  extradition between Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia has been agreed to between Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Schedule, the Minister has powers to\r\n\r\nvary it. But here again\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  list  of  offences  that  are  specified   as\r\n\r\nextraditable  offences as far as the  Commonwealth\r\n\r\nis  concerned, was again agreed to  after  a  long\r\n\r\nargument  at the London Law Conference.  It  forms\r\n\r\npart of a common scheme which has been adopted  by\r\n\r\nthe  Commonwealth countries subject to  variations\r\n\r\nor modifications as each country chooses to adopt.\r\n\r\nThere  has been one difficulty, which is this.  If\r\n\r\nyou commit the offence of murder in Singapore, you\r\n\r\nare  liable  to  be  sentenced to  be  hanged.  As\r\n\r\nMembers well know, the United Kingdom have got rid\r\n\r\nof  capital punishment perhaps to suit  their  own\r\n\r\nlocal   social  conditions.  Our  conditions   are\r\n\r\ndifferent.  They want a discretion  - a  discretion\r\n\r\nnot  to  return  persons  who  commit  murder   in\r\n\r\nSingapore and run to the United Kingdom. They  say\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  against their social  conscience  if\r\n\r\nthese   offenders   are   returned   because,   on\r\n\r\nconviction,  they  are liable to  be  hanged.  Our\r\n\r\nargument is that the crime is committed here.  And\r\n\r\nsurely the punishment to be meted out should be in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  our laws, not theirs.  I  merely\r\n\r\nraise  this matter because, as between  country  A\r\n\r\nand  country B, there may be modifications to  the\r\n\r\nscheme.  Some countries may not choose  to  return\r\n\r\noffenders   for   certain  offences.   Hence   the\r\n\r\nprovision  enabling  the  Minister  to  vary   the\r\n\r\nSchedule.  But I give the hon. Member my assurance\r\n\r\nthat  we will not vary the Schedule in respect  of\r\n\r\ncrimes  that have already been committed in  order\r\n\r\nto fix someone who has done it and is about to run\r\n\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Barker].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MEDICINES (ADVERTISEMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>AND SALE) (AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.26 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill was introduced in the last Parliament\r\n\r\nbut has since lapsed in view of the dissolution of\r\n\r\nParliament on 8th February, 1968.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill makes a number of significant amendments\r\n\r\nto   the   Medicines  (Advertisement   and   Sale)\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past few years, the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nhas  been  receiving numerous complaints regarding\r\n\r\nundesirable  advertisements  appearing  in   local\r\n\r\nnewspapers  concerning  medicines  or  unqualified\r\n\r\npersons  claiming  cures  for  a  wide  range   of\r\n\r\nconditions,   from   sexual   weakness,    chronic\r\n\r\nsterility, menstrual disorders to kidney diseases,\r\n\r\netc.   In   general,   these  advertisements   are\r\n\r\ndeceitful, misleading and are calculated  to  dupe\r\n\r\nthe uninformed and gullible members of the public,\r\n\r\nso that they can part with their money to purchase\r\n\r\nthese  so-called \"miraculous cures\" for all  their\r\n\r\nills. Existing Ordinances for the control of  such\r\n\r\nadvertisements,     namely,     the      Medicines\r\n\r\n(Advertisement and Sale) Ordinance, 1955, and  the\r\n\r\nIndecent  Advertisement Ordinance (Cap. 142),  are\r\n\r\ninadequate and prosecutions under these Ordinances\r\n\r\nhave    proved    difficult   and    unsuccessful,\r\n\r\nparticularly  as advertisers have  got  round  the\r\n\r\nrestrictions by using homonyms and synonyms, or by\r\n\r\nclaiming  to advertise medical skills  instead  of\r\n\r\nmedicines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has given very careful consideration\r\n\r\nto  this  problem  before this  present  stage  of\r\n\r\nproposing an Amendment Bill to this House. As  far\r\n\r\nback  as  1962, a Committee was formed to  examine\r\n\r\nthe problem and suggest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures of control with the following terms of\r\n\r\nreference:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To study the current undesirable and unethical\r\n\r\n\"cures\" and \"advertisement of cures\", and to\r\n\r\nsuggest measures of control.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  Committee  made certain recommendations  for\r\n\r\ncontrol. Subsequently, in 1966, the Committee  was\r\n\r\nresuscitated under the same Chairman, Dr Gwee  Ah\r\n\r\nLeng, with the following terms of reference:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To study the current unethical, dishonest and\r\n\r\nundesirable    advertisements    pertaining     to\r\n\r\ntreatment,  cures, and to the medical,  skills  of\r\n\r\nunqualified  persons  and to suggest  measures  of\r\n\r\neffective control.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unanimous conclusions of this Committee\r\n\r\nextended   the  recommendations  of  the  previous\r\n\r\nCommittee by reviewing and adding to the  list  of\r\n\r\ndiseases prohibited for general advertising and by\r\n\r\nrecommending  a  general ban on all advertisements\r\n\r\npertaining' to medical skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also made certain recommendations\r\n\r\nfor   the  effective  control  of  labelling   and\r\n\r\nimportation  of  drugs which are being  separately\r\n\r\ndealt  with  by  the  Controller  of  Imports  and\r\n\r\nExports as they relate to his control measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the Committee's report have been\r\n\r\ndistributed  to Members of this House through  the\r\n\r\nClerk of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to elaborate on the Bill, clause\r\n\r\nby clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 sets out the short title and\r\n\r\ncommencement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends section 4 of the Ordinance by\r\n\r\nsubstituting a Schedule in place of  the  list  of\r\n\r\nconditions  and diseases mentioned in  respect  of\r\n\r\nwhich  advertisements are prohibited. The Schedule\r\n\r\nmay  be  amended by notification in  the  Gazette.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement is obviously less cumbersome than\r\n\r\nhaving    to   amend   the   Ordinance    whenever\r\n\r\ncircumstances make it necessary to amend the list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 creates a new section aimed at\r\n\r\nprohibiting  advertisements  relating  to  medical\r\n\r\nskill or service.

The Chinese Physicians' Association  have\r\n\r\nalso  officially  declared  its  stand  in  public\r\n\r\nagainst advertisements by medical practitioners of\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese school. However, in their case,  they\r\n\r\nare  handicapped by lack of a disciplinary  board,\r\n\r\nThe amendment in this new section will, therefore,\r\n\r\nreinforce the hand of medical practitioners of the\r\n\r\nChinese  school who will now be able to see  their\r\n\r\nstand  reinforced  by law. This  prohibition  will\r\n\r\nfinancially affect a number of publications in the\r\n\r\nChinese medium, but public interest must supersede\r\n\r\nprivate  interest, however much we may regret  the\r\n\r\nloss of income to these establishments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends section 5 of the Ordinance so\r\n\r\nthat the prohibition of advertisements on articles\r\n\r\nrelating  to  abortion  is  extended  to  prohibit\r\n\r\nadvertisements  referring  to  medical  skill   or\r\n\r\nservice relating to abortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5, which amends section 6 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  is  consequential  on  the   preceding\r\n\r\nsections.  It  tidies up the  references  made  to\r\n\r\nvarious  prohibitions so that these are  correctly\r\n\r\nreferred to. As part of the tidying-up process,  a\r\n\r\nnew  subsection is added to provide for  reference\r\n\r\nto  the new prohibition of advertisments referring\r\n\r\nto  medical  skill or service within this  section\r\n\r\nwhich sets Out provisions as to offences under the\r\n\r\npreceding sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends section 7 of the Ordinance so as\r\n\r\nto  clarify that where the required disclosure  of\r\n\r\ncomposition of a medicine is written in a language\r\n\r\nother  than  the English language, such disclosure\r\n\r\nmust be made in the English language as well as in\r\n\r\nany other language that may be used in addition to\r\n\r\nthe English language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 creates a Schedule of diseases and\r\n\r\nconditions in respect of which advertisements  are\r\n\r\nto  be controlled.

The study by\r\n\r\nthe Committee under Dr Gwee Ah Leng has indicated\r\n\r\nthat the diseases and conditions mentioned in  the\r\n\r\nSchedule  constitute the happy  hunting-ground  of\r\n\r\nthose  unscrupulous advertisers who  seek  to  get\r\n\r\nrich  quickly  by  preying  on  the  anxiety   and\r\n\r\ndesperation  of the unfortunate victims  of  these\r\n\r\ndiseases and conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there are a number of parties likely to be\r\n\r\ninterested in the proposals contained in the Bill,\r\n\r\nsuch    as   doctors,   physicians,   pharmacists,\r\n\r\ndentists,   importers  of  drugs  and  advertising\r\n\r\nagencies, it has been decided that the Bill should\r\n\r\nbe  referred to a Select Committee if  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading  is approved, so that wider 'consideration\r\n\r\nmight be given to the suggested amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as my predecessor in the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHealth has stressed, may I say that we owe a  duty\r\n\r\nto  the  people of Singapore to protect them  from\r\n\r\nthe  unscrupulous exploitation of the  quacks  and\r\n\r\nothers  of  the  kind who make money  out  of  the\r\n\r\nsufferings and despair of those who are not  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  judge wisely. These amendments  will\r\n\r\ntranslate a universally accepted principle in  the\r\n\r\nmedical code of ethics into a provision of the law\r\n\r\nof  the land. I am confident that hon. Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House  will  give  their  support  for   the\r\n\r\nenactment of this proposed legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Semi)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of this Bill in Parliament, we\r\n\r\nwill   be   able   to   control  effectively   the\r\n\r\nadvertising of certain medicines in newspapers and\r\n\r\nother publications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we go through the pages of\r\n\r\nthe   Malay   newspapers,   we   find   ridiculous\r\n\r\nadvertisements of medicines which claim to be able\r\n\r\nto  turn  an old man into a young man and  an  old\r\n\r\nlady  into a virgin. How is this possible? I  have\r\n\r\nread  an  advertisement in a Malay  newspaper  not\r\n\r\nlong ago about a certain medicine which claims  to\r\n\r\nbe  able to increase the sexual potency of men. It\r\n\r\nclaimed  that if a male person took that medicine,\r\n\r\nhe would be like an elephant who had gone wild. If\r\n\r\nthis  claim is correctly made, I feel that such  a\r\n\r\nmedicine  is very dangerous. If every male  person\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  were  to take this  medicine,  what\r\n\r\nwould happen to our female population? I have also\r\n\r\ncome  across an advertisement in a newspaper about\r\n\r\na  certain kind of medicine called Ma'jun which is\r\n\r\nsupposed to turn old ladies into virgins. If  this\r\n\r\nclaim  is  justified and all our female population\r\n\r\nwere  to take this medicine, what would happen  to\r\n\r\nour  male population? However, these medicines are\r\n\r\nnot as effective as they are claimed to be. On the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  they affect the health of those  people\r\n\r\nwho  take  them.  I feel that the  newspapers  and\r\n\r\nother     publications    which    print     these\r\n\r\nadvertisements do so purely with a  profit  motive\r\n\r\nand  without  consideration  for  the  welfare  of\r\n\r\nmembers of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for\r\n\r\nsome  time  now, certain so-called and self-styled\r\n\r\n\"medical   practitioners\"   have   wantonly    and\r\n\r\nunethically claimed to cure and treat all kinds of\r\n\r\nillnesses - in particular female ailments, such as\r\n\r\noverdue   menstruation  -  and  they  have   often\r\n\r\nprocured  illegal abortions as well. In the  past,\r\n\r\nthese  quacks and street pedlars used to stand  at\r\n\r\nstreet   corners  announcing  their  presence   by\r\n\r\nbeating  gongs and playing music from their  vans.\r\n\r\nThey  then  orate to the people present about  the\r\n\r\nmiraculous qualities of the medicines they peddle.\r\n\r\nBy  such  means,  these rogues and vagabonds  were\r\n\r\nable to sell whatever oil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey were peddling as a miraculous cure for broken\r\n\r\nbones.  To  my  surprise, I also found  they  were\r\n\r\nselling plain 'Aspro' pills as pregnancy pills and\r\n\r\nas cures for sterility and so on. However, by such\r\n\r\nmeans,  they could reach only a limited number  of\r\n\r\npeople  who happened to be attracted by the  music\r\n\r\nfrom  their  vans and gongs and who fell  prey  to\r\n\r\ntheir  oratory. But now these pedlars  and  quacks\r\n\r\nhave  become  wiser. In order  to  reach  a  wider\r\n\r\nsection  of the public, they now use the Press  to\r\n\r\nadvertise  their  wonderful  medicines  and  their\r\n\r\nnonsense.  These  malpractices,  therefore,   have\r\n\r\nbecome  a  real  menace to  our  society.  It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, opportune that this Bill be  passed  to\r\n\r\ncontrol such malpractices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these pedlars and quacks have already\r\n\r\nunscrupulously  exploited  and  cheated  a   large\r\n\r\nsection  of the general public. Not only  did  the\r\n\r\nsusceptible victims lose large sums of money, but,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  their diseases were made worse  by  the\r\n\r\ntreatments and drugs. In some cases I believe  the\r\n\r\nresults were fatal. Such cases are the talk of the\r\n\r\ntown. In fact, too many of our good citizens  have\r\n\r\nfallen   into   these   traps   because   of   the\r\n\r\nadvertisements claiming these miraculous cures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our innocent public need protection and it\r\n\r\nis  our  responsibility and duty to see that  they\r\n\r\nare  protected as fully as possible. The Medicines\r\n\r\n(Advertisement  and  Sale)  (Amendment)  Bill   is\r\n\r\nundoubtedly welcomed by all. On the other hand, it\r\n\r\nis very much regretted that it was not passed long\r\n\r\nago.  It  should have been brought to  this  House\r\n\r\nmuch  earlier.  Nevertheless, with this  amendment\r\n\r\nBill,   it   is   hoped  that   unscrupulous   and\r\n\r\nunprincipled  drug  pedlars  will  be  dealt  with\r\n\r\naccordingly, so that our innocent citizens will be\r\n\r\nprotected and no one will be deceived by unethical\r\n\r\nmedical advertisements and swindled by quacks  and\r\n\r\nmedical pedlars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise  in support of this Bill.  When  our\r\n\r\nancestors  came from different parts of the  world\r\n\r\nto this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsmall  island,  they  brought  with  them  various\r\n\r\nmethods of treating all kinds of ailments. We have\r\n\r\nstill   some   people  here  who  practise   these\r\n\r\ntraditional  methods. Of course,  there  are  some\r\n\r\nmethods which are effective. But with the progress\r\n\r\nof  time  we  should replace them with the  latest\r\n\r\nmedical  methods  to  treat  the  sick  among  our\r\n\r\npeople. Some people who fall ill just buy any kind\r\n\r\nof  medicine  for treatment without going  to  the\r\n\r\nhospital    for   proper   care.   When    people,\r\n\r\nparticularly those who have to work all  day  long\r\n\r\nfall ill, they hope to be cured in the fastest and\r\n\r\nquickest  way.

I have three copies of the\r\n\r\nlatest   editions.  All  these   are   large-sized\r\n\r\nadvertisements and we can see all sorts of  things\r\n\r\nin them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

In this edition  we\r\n\r\ncan   see  advertisements  publicising  \"cure-all\"\r\n\r\nmedicines for various diseases. For instance:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If you want to think of bearing children, come\r\n\r\nto  us.  We are specialists in promoting fertility\r\n\r\nand  infertility. If there is no  efficacy,  money\r\n\r\nwill be refunded in full.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  so  on.  Sir,  the  advertisements  are  very\r\n\r\nattractively  worded. Some quacks have  their  own\r\n\r\nready-made medicines for sale and distribution  in\r\n\r\nthe  market. Some of these are advertised  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  as having been patented and registered\r\n\r\nwith  the Government. As a result, ignorant people\r\n\r\nare  misled into believing that the Government has\r\n\r\napproved  and  recognised the  medical  skills  of\r\n\r\nthese  quacks. Hence, these quacks have their  way\r\n\r\nwith  the  public.  Consequently,  the  Government\r\n\r\nearns a disreputable name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we continue to allow these unscrupulous and\r\n\r\ngood-for-nothing quacks to have their way with the\r\n\r\npublic, maybe one day, Mr Speaker, we will see in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe     newspapers    more    shocking     medical\r\n\r\nadvertisements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before us will, therefore, exercise some\r\n\r\nsort  of  control over these pedlars of  medicines\r\n\r\nand  quacks. Of course, this Bill will not  affect\r\n\r\nall  those  who  are professionally  qualified  in\r\n\r\nmedicine.  At  present, the best  way  to  control\r\n\r\nthese  quacks  is to deny them the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nadvertise  their  products in the  newspapers  and\r\n\r\nthus mislead the poor people. We must educate  the\r\n\r\npeople to the efficacy of modern medicine. At  the\r\n\r\nsame time, however, we must exercise some sort  of\r\n\r\ncontrol  over medical advertisments which  mislead\r\n\r\nthe public. That is why I support this Bill. It is\r\n\r\nby  legislation that we can control these  medical\r\n\r\nadvertisments.  This is only one  way  of  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  the quacks. There are other ways to  control\r\n\r\nand  regulate  their activities.  I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Minister  for Health  will  consider\r\n\r\nsetting  some  sort  of  official  examination  to\r\n\r\nlegalise some of the Chinese qualified Sinsehs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nas the only medical Member in this House, although\r\n\r\nseemingly  incognito,  and  as  a  member   of   a\r\n\r\nprofession  that  requires  no  advertisments,   I\r\n\r\ncannot resist the temptation to say a few words on\r\n\r\nthis  amendment Bill. The original  Ordinance  has\r\n\r\nbeen  in existence for some years, but somehow  it\r\n\r\nhas  proved  to  be inadequate. It  has  too  many\r\n\r\nloopholes, and all sorts of savoury and Un savoury\r\n\r\nadvertisments    on   medicines   and    so-called\r\n\r\nprofessional  skills are able to  find  their  way\r\n\r\ninto   the  newspapers,  to  the  profit  of   the\r\n\r\nadvertisers.  Such  fanfare  is  not   worthy   of\r\n\r\ndetailed mention in this House or even to fall  on\r\n\r\nthe ears of hon. Members. Suffice it for me to say\r\n\r\nthat  the advertisers are either gods or fakes  in\r\n\r\nwhat  they so blantantly claim to be able  to  do.\r\n\r\nIllnesses  of any description, fatal or otherwise,\r\n\r\nare  practically guaranteed to be cured.

I presume, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nlooking  at  such advertisements in  some  of  the\r\n\r\ndaily  papers,  one must have the impression  that\r\n\r\nthe advertisers are either leading the readers  up\r\n\r\nthe garden path or they are trying to promise them\r\n\r\nelixirs of life. Most of our citizens must  surely\r\n\r\nhave    developed   a   sufficient    degree    of\r\n\r\nsophistication to ignore or laugh at such  medical\r\n\r\nclaims.  Unfortunately,  quite  a  number  of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  happen to be gullible enough to  swallow\r\n\r\nthese  advertisements, hook, line and sinker,  and\r\n\r\nput  their hard-earned wages and even their  lives\r\n\r\ninto the hands of these smart manipulators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore time for the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nto plug up any loophole in the existing Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe  amendment Bill seems to me to be  doing  just\r\n\r\nthis.
