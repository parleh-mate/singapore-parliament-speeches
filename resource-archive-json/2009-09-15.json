We have made good progress in ramping up the number of childcare centres.&nbsp; Since August last year, 23 new centres have been set up, increasing the number of centres from 748 to 771 as at end August this year.&nbsp; These new centres have added an additional of over 2,700 childcare places, a 4% increase within a year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By March 2010, we would expect another 25 new childcare centres to be operational, contributing an additional 2,500 places.&nbsp; My Ministry will continue to release sites to childcare centre operators progressively over the next few years.&nbsp; These centres will be located in areas where there is assessed demand for childcare places.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the affordability of infant care services, we have been monitoring the infant care fees closely after increasing the infant care subsidy from $400 to $600 last August.&nbsp; We are happy to note that infant care median fees have remained fairly stable, with fees rising by about 2%, from $1,177 last August to $1,200 this August.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The increase in the number of childcare centres has also helped to <p align=\"left\">Column: 1452</p>\r\nprovide more infant care places and moderate infant care fees.&nbsp; The 23 new centres developed since August last year have added over 250 infant care places to the sector.&nbsp; I believe that our efforts to set up more centres will allow market forces and competition to maintain fees at an affordable level.&nbsp; I would also urge childcare centre operators to exercise restraint in setting their fees.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Second, if foreigners are to be recruited to be caregivers, will the Ministry impose any minimum qualifications on these caregivers so that the safety and well-being of the infants and young children in their care are ensured?&nbsp; Third, would allowing infants as young as two months to be put in infant care centres effectively defeat the purpose of the 16-week maternity leave granted to mothers?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

On the second question about safety&nbsp;&ndash; my Ministry has set up benchmarks, standards and licensing requirements.&nbsp; If they do not fulfil the Ministry's requirements, we will not give them the licence.&nbsp; If operators do not do a proper job to recruit qualified people, we will also withdraw their licences.&nbsp; All caregivers, whether local or foreign, should fulfil the requirements, such as five GCE \"O\" Level passes, training, and so on.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=\"left\">Column: 1453</p>\r\nThe third question was about infant care, whether parents will use the maternity leave provided by the Government and employers.&nbsp; We will leave it to the individual family.&nbsp; What we try to do is to give people a choice.&nbsp; So we try to provide infant care for babies as young as two months but whether&nbsp;parents want to use their maternity leave or they want to put their infants into infant care, the working women can make their decisions.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Previously&nbsp;&ndash; as Mayor Zainudin knows since he also supervised NTUC's childcare&nbsp;unit&nbsp;&ndash; we only recruited people with three GCE \"O\" Level passes.&nbsp; Now, the requirement is five GCE \"O\" Level passes and we want to improve on this further.&nbsp; As my Minister said during the COS debate, quality and training for teachers would be the key challenges for my Ministry and MOE.&nbsp; Therefore, we will look into the salary package and how to help this industry improve.&nbsp; I am sure the Member also knows that lately, my Ministry has been very generous in giving grants to some of the anchor operators to train their people.&nbsp; I am sure the Member knows we even give scholarships.&nbsp; We even give some assistance for&nbsp;set-up <p align=\"left\">Column: 1454</p>\r\ncosts and administrative costs.&nbsp; In previous years, there was no such thing but from this year onwards we gave operators a lot of assistance.&nbsp; We will work harder with MOE and other training institutions to see how to help to train these professionals and at the same time, make sure they have reasonable rewards in this industry.&nbsp; But it is a challenge.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2008, there were 2,860 applications for maintenance orders made by ex-spouses.&nbsp; This is actually a&nbsp;decrease from 3,021 in 2007 and 3,618 in 2006.&nbsp; On average, 86% (around 2,720) of these cases were \r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 1456</p>\r\n\r\napplications for enforcement of maintenance orders, where applicants failed to get payment on an existing maintenance order from their ex-spouse.&nbsp; Some of the reasons cited for non-payment are the ex-spouse&rsquo;s inability to pay because&nbsp;of a loss of job, increased financial commitments because of&nbsp;a new family or continued unemployment. We do not have available information on the average amount of maintenance granted per child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The enforcement of maintenance orders follows the process for all other Magistrate&rsquo;s Complaints under the Criminal Procedure Code.&nbsp; The applicant has to, first,&nbsp;go to court&nbsp;to file the enforcement complaint.&nbsp; If the applicant does not have a lawyer to represent him or her, the applicant would then&nbsp;need to be present in court a second time, when the court issues the summons and fixes a date for a Mention. On the third occasion, the applicant would then have to attend court for the first Mention and, if both parties are present and agreeable, they can go for mediation on the same day.&nbsp; If both&nbsp;parties can reach a settlement&nbsp;through mediation, then the judgment would be recorded by the judge and the case is concluded.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it does not always stop there.&nbsp; Sometimes,&nbsp;parties have to return to court another day for the trial on the matter.&nbsp; Therefore, it takes a minimum of three court appearances and sometimes, many more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We acknowledge that there is scope to improve the procedures and introduce more effective measures to enforce compliance of orders, while ensuring that the system is fair to all parties.&nbsp; I had, at this House, mentioned during the last Committee of Supply Debate that my Ministry would review how enforcement of maintenance can be enhanced.&nbsp; We have invited views from the public and from Members of this House.&nbsp; My Ministry, the Ministry of Law, the Family Court, the Attorney-General&rsquo;s Chambers and various \r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 1457</p>\r\n\r\nagencies have been studying the matter in the past few months.&nbsp; We have also received many suggestions from members of the public and organisations, including the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are currently studying their various suggestions, as well as reviewing proposals.&nbsp; Some of these measures&nbsp;include introducing stiffer penalties to deter defaults, and simplifying the process of seeking enforcement.&nbsp; There were also suggestions such as giving free access to marital records and making public the maintenance payments of divorcees to their former spouses and children&nbsp;&ndash; all these are also being considered. &nbsp;The review should be completed in a few months' time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Phua has also asked if we could consider allowing applications for the enforcement of maintenance orders to be heard at Night Court.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I have been informed by the Courts that this will not be practical.&nbsp; The Night Court deals with essentially regulatory offences in which the offenders plead guilty.&nbsp; If the offender decides not to plead guilty, his case will be heard in the day court.&nbsp; Such hearings, which often entail Respondents&rsquo; and Claimants&rsquo; presentations, could be lengthy and there may be insufficient time for such proceedings to be conducted at night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in order to serve the public better, the Subordinate Courts has recently extended its operations throughout the lunch hour, so we can squeeze in some time there.&nbsp;

go to court at least three times in order to pursue payment of a maintenance order, which has already been made, is too many times.&nbsp; So, rather than just looking at nights or lunch hours, what we are really trying to do is to reduce the number of times that they have to go to court.&nbsp;

Prof. Paulin Tay Straughan (Nominated Member):&nbsp;</B> Sir, I have three supplementary questions.&nbsp; The first relates to the role of teachers.&nbsp; They are inevitably the frontline identifiers.&nbsp; Can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary&nbsp;elaborate on how well teachers are trained in the role of counsellor/mentor, because that is not an easy task and is not an innate kind of ability either?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second question relates to the balance between student privacy and through-train information, so that when they move from institution to institution, there is sufficient information on their at-risk behaviour so that the next institution will not be caught off guard.&nbsp; What is in place for that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third,&nbsp;I wonder if the Ministry would consider reducing class size in secondary schools, because it seems&nbsp;that that is where the impact of all kinds of challenges come on the teenagers, when they are searching boundaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps a better staff-student ratio may help students&nbsp;morph into their new identities as young adults, and for teachers and other educators/mentors to be able to better identify students with such a need.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M:</B> &nbsp; Sir, as I mentioned, the approach to addressing&nbsp;the issues&nbsp;is three-fold.&nbsp; One of them is to build the ability of teachers to spot them.&nbsp; We have been working with the Health Promotion Board's psychologists.&nbsp; There is a committee right now or an effort called Reach where teachers are being trained by&nbsp;full-time school counsellors to learn to spot the symptoms of depression or even to look at behaviours that may lead to depressions.&nbsp; Right now, this is piloted in the north zone schools.&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope to finish this by the end of this year, and then roll it out to the rest of the schools, so that \r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 1463</p>\r\nevery teacher has some level of skill or competency to spot such problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, on the question of information, this passing of information on students has&nbsp;just started this year&nbsp;when we started to populate the information in the School Cockpit for counsellors to know about the students who have been counselled from their previous school.&nbsp; We assure Members of the House that we make sure the privacy of the students is taken care of.&nbsp; The information&nbsp;is confidential and only the relevant officers, who are usually the full-time school counsellors (FTSCs), will have access to this information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third,&nbsp;class size for secondary classes is always an issue that will be reviewed over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point of time, what we have done instead is to increase the number of support that students get.&nbsp; For example, we have already increased the number of allied educators that support teachers in the&nbsp;classes.&nbsp; We have provided more FTSCs in schools where we find there is a need for them, and also operations managers to take away some of the administrative matters that teachers would&nbsp;otherwise have to do.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 1463</p>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:ENGINEERING SCHOLARSHIPS-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:ENGINEERING SCHOLARSHIPS:::1466-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In other words, in 2009, slightly more than 30% of all PSC scholarships awarded were for Engineering and the Sciences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2008, PSC received 2,300 applications, with 6% or 140&nbsp;indicating Engineering as their top choice of study.&nbsp; Another 17% or 390 applicants indicated the Sciences as their top choice of study.&nbsp; The PSC awarded 72 scholarships in 2008, out of which 11 (15%) and 14&nbsp; (20%) were for Engineering and the Sciences respectively.&nbsp; This means that 35% of all PSC scholarships awarded in 2008 were for Engineering and the Sciences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PSC offers its scholars the flexibility to pursue a wide range of courses, including Engineering, the Sciences and Humanities, in different countries.&nbsp;

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B>&nbsp; Sir, Singapore views the haze situation as a very serious issue. Transboundary haze creates health and social problems for our citizens, and has adverse impacts on our economy, tourism and the transportation/aviation industry. Forest fires also release large quantities of carbon emissions into the atmosphere, contributing to the long-term effects of climate change. The source of this transboundary haze is largely attributed to the fires in Indonesia.&nbsp; Of late, there have also been fires in other parts of the region. We have thus been working with our regional neighbours to solve the haze problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the ASEAN framework, Singapore hosts the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC) that monitors the regional hotspot situation and provides early warning to our neighbours when the ASMC observes significant rise in hotspot counts. Meanwhile, the ASEAN Secretariat also serves as the Interim ASEAN Coordinating Centre (ACC) to facilitate channelling of regional resources to countries requesting for assistance to combat forest fires.&nbsp; However, Sir, the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution which was signed in 2002 has yet to be ratified by both Indonesia and the Philippines. The effectiveness of regional cooperation under ASEAN depends very much on the willingness of its individual members to live up to their international obligations.&nbsp; The Indonesian media has reported that the Indonesian parliament (DPR) has highlighted the ASEAN Haze Agreement as one of six priority bills to be ratified before their current term ends on 30th September.&nbsp; Sir, we hope the DPR will do so expeditiously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from the ASEAN framework, we had in 2006 formed the Sub-regional Ministerial Steering Committee (MSC) on Transboundary Haze Pollution comprising Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand to enhance haze \r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 1468</p>\r\ncollaboration in the southern ASEAN region.&nbsp; The MSC, Sir,&nbsp;has met eight times within a span of three years, and seeks to assist Indonesia in implementing its Plan of Action (PoA) to combat haze. The bilateral Indonesia-Singapore collaboration in Jambi Province and the Indonesia-Malaysia collaboration in Riau Province provide progress reports to the MSC.&nbsp; The MSC also closely monitors the hotspot situation in the region. &nbsp;Indonesia has committed to achieving hotspot reduction of 50% in 2009, 75% in 2012 and 95% in 2025, using 2006 hotspot data as a baseline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at the 8th MSC on 19th August this year hosted by Singapore, MSC countries agreed to ban all open burning including suspending permits for prescribed burning activities in fire-prone areas. &nbsp;Countries also agreed to step up enforcement measures, and to promote public awareness to control fires.&nbsp; These measures, Sir, will help prevent and mitigate haze during the <I>El Nino</I> season in the short-term.&nbsp; To facilitate implementation of longer-term sustainable measures, Singapore will be contributing by playing host to a MSC forum on the 28th of&nbsp;October this year for local authorities of MSC countries and international organisations to share experiences and best practices in addressing the transboundary haze pollution challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the bilateral front, our collaboration in Jambi Province has progressed very well.&nbsp; Thus far, we note that the hotspots in Jambi Province and in particular, the Muaro-Jambi Regency where our programmes are being implemented, have been relatively low as compared to the other fire-prone provinces and districts in Indonesia. We will thus continue to share technical expertise to help build up our region's capacity to overcome the haze problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stronger <I>El Nino</I> conditions in the next few months could exacerbate the dry\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 1469</p>\r\nconditions in the region and result in a prolonged dry season and increased hotspot activities.&nbsp; Major international events like the F1 Grand Prix and the APEC meetings will be held in the next few months and scrutiny of the haze situation by the international media is inevitable. &nbsp;I have therefore offered to the Indonesian State Minister of Environment, Rachmat Witoelar, Singapore&rsquo;s assistance to suppress the fires if necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we acknowledge that Indonesia has been trying to implement measures to bring down the hotspots. &nbsp;As to whether or not their plan of action is on target, it&nbsp;will be up to Indonesia to review, but we believe that the Indonesian Government remains sincere in combating haze as it affects the health and quality of living of their citizens as well. &nbsp;Where the region lacks the expertise and resources, we should invite international participation to enhance our efforts. &nbsp;It will take strong political resolve by Indonesia to enforce their laws to prevent forest fires, support and co-operation within ASEAN, as well as resources from the international community, to successfully battle the transboundary haze problem.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Er Lee Bee Wah:&nbsp;</B> Sir, supplementary question, please.&nbsp; Indonesian Environment Minister told media that all five members of the Sub-regional&nbsp;MSC on Transboundary Haze Pollution,&nbsp;including Singapore, agreed not to internationalise our haze issue.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether this is&nbsp;true and why should Singapore agree to it.&nbsp; Does the Minister think that the Indonesian Government is very slow in taking action to combat this haze issue?&nbsp; Does&nbsp;he think that we have to protest before they start taking action?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Whether they are slow or not, it is something which we have to continue to monitor.&nbsp; I do not think we have to protest because we have already protested and that is why we have the MSC meetings starting from 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, Sir, despite the best of efforts of ASEAN, the haze continues to&nbsp;plague our region and this is actually due to limited resources available in the region to prevent and mitigate forest fires.&nbsp; So we \r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 1471</p>\r\nbelieve that it is important that ASEAN countries continue to seek assistance from the international community for resources and expertise to augment the region's efforts to combat the haze issue.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)</B><B>:</B>&nbsp;Sir, three supplementary questions for the Minister.&nbsp; I would like the Minister to come back to the ASEAN Haze Agreement which he mentioned earlier.&nbsp; Three years ago in the House he said that Indonesia should show its political resolve by signing the ASEAN Haze Agreement.&nbsp; However, as he mentioned, to-date it has not been done.&nbsp; And&nbsp;I would like the Minister to comment on whether he thinks that this is a must-have in order to comprehensively resolve the issue or can significant progress still be made even if the agreement is not signed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second question: some Indonesian parliamentarians have spoken to the media and they have said that one of the reasons why they do not want to ratify the agreement is that they feel it should be tied in to banning illegal logging which they say Indonesia has been losing revenue and&nbsp;has benefited other countries instead.&nbsp; So I would like the Minister to tell the House whether this issue is also on the ASEAN agenda.&nbsp; Are they&nbsp;looking into the issue of illegal logging or not?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the last question is this. There was a recent <I>Straits Times</I> report that assessed that slash-and-burn in Indonesia \"continues unabated\".&nbsp; I would&nbsp;like the&nbsp;Minister to comment on whether he agrees with that assessment and what he thinks is the root cause of that.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> Sir, the ASEAN Haze Agreement is an important agreement.&nbsp; It means&nbsp;that all the 10 member countries have agreed to&nbsp;put together their own domestic plans to deal with the haze problem.&nbsp; So if you ask me \r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 1472</p>\r\nwhether we must have it, we must because we agreed to have it.&nbsp; And so we hope that Indonesia will ratify the agreement as quickly as possible and therefore put in place programmes which they have done so because they have a plan of action, and therefore all of us can work together to ensure that we keep our house in order so that this problem can be under control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But having said that, even though Indonesia has not ratified, we have moved&nbsp;forward because we realise that there are&nbsp;challenges for which&nbsp;we cannot wait.&nbsp; So when the&nbsp;last haze&nbsp;in 2006 came about, we felt that it was important for at least the five ASEAN countries to come together and deal with this collectively.&nbsp; Thus far, both Singapore and Malaysia have made progress by&nbsp;collaborating with some of the local provinces in Indonesia.&nbsp; So our collaboration, for example, in the&nbsp;Jambi Province has proven that it is possible for us to work together with the&nbsp;provinces to come&nbsp;up with an alternative plan to deal with this challenge.&nbsp; As I mentioned in my reply, so far the hotspot counts coming from the&nbsp;area&nbsp;in which we are collaborating&nbsp;seemed to be low as compared to the other fire-prone areas.&nbsp; So I think it is important for the agreement to come into effect but at the same time we cannot wait and therefore we have to move and find other channels, other platforms to deal with the challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue of illegal logging is&nbsp;an on-going discussion.&nbsp; It is not&nbsp;an issue that&nbsp;has been discussed among the Environment Ministers but I am sure it&nbsp;has been debated in the other forums.&nbsp; But as far as Singapore is concerned, we keep telling the Indonesian counterparts that if they have come across anybody who has done illegal logging, they should be prosecuted based on the laws of the country.&nbsp; So&nbsp;there is nothing to prevent&nbsp;Indonesia from taking the necessary action in dealing with whoever is responsible for illegal logging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 1473</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question as to whether or not the slash-and-burn has gone unabated, the hotspot counts have been increasing.&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you use that as a correlation, that means it has gone \"unabated\" if&nbsp;you want to use that word.&nbsp; But at least in those areas in which Singapore and Malaysia are collaborating with the Indonesian provinces, their numbers seem to be coming down or at least it is holding steady.&nbsp; So what it means is that there are alternative means to removing, clearing land, and so on.&nbsp; So the challenge is really for us to share best practices and that is why we have agreed to host the MSC&nbsp;forum at the end of October where we hope to invite heads of the various provinces across the region to come together and&nbsp;learn from&nbsp;both the experiences of Singapore and Malaysia so that they can then go back and decide as to whether or not they want to adopt those practices.&nbsp; I think that is one of the better ways in which we can achieve an outcome&nbsp;&ndash; to get some of the local regional heads to decide.&nbsp; If Jambi can do it with Singapore, if Riau can do&nbsp;it with&nbsp;Malaysia, perhaps they can also do it.&nbsp; We have offered our assistance in terms of training but beyond that, if there are other things that they have to do, they have to find their own sources.&nbsp; In terms of expertise, we are prepared to share with any other provinces that&nbsp;are prepared to work with us in this area.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B>&nbsp; Sir, the Active, Beautiful and Clean (ABC) Waters Programme seeks to transform our drains, canals and reservoirs into beautiful, vibrant and flowing streams, rivers and lakes. In creating these new social and recreational focal points for the community to enjoy, we hope that they will develop a bond with water, and hence cherish and keep our water resources clean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the initial phase from FY 2007 to FY 2011, 28 projects will be implemented progressively across the island. For each project, PUB will develop the details of the design and seek the inputs of the community before implementing it. Thus far, the PUB has completed three demonstration projects at Kolam Ayer, Bedok Reservoir as well as MacRitchie Reservoir which was recently launched in end July. I am heartened to note that the amenities and features are well-utilised by Singaporeans. For example, community events such as the National Day Observance Ceremony, Mid-Autumn and Chinese New Year festival celebrations have been held at these waterfronts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, construction works are ongoing for nine other projects and these include a floating island at Sungei Punggol, as well as a water performance stage and a heritage bridge at Lower Seletar Reservoir. Both projects are scheduled to be completed next year.&nbsp; Seven more tenders are scheduled to be called within this financial year, including Kallang River at Bishan Park, MacRitchie Reservoir Phase Two and the Geylang River Phase One. For the remaining projects, PUB and its consultants are in the process of planning and designing them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Member has asked&nbsp;if there were any plans to upgrade the Ulu Pandan Canal and Park Connector parallel to the Mount Sinai Estate. I am pleased to \r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 1475</p>\r\ninform that the stretch of Sungei Ulu Pandan in the vicinity of Mount Sinai is one of the 28 projects that will be implemented. The proposed site is within walking distance to the estate, about 500 metres downstream of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A key feature of the project will be a constructed wetland that will provide a habitat for urban biodiversity and enhance the surrounding environment. There are also plans to integrate the canal and park connector with the nearby Centre for Aquatic Science Research that is being set up by PUB, NUS and Deltares. Together with the wetland, these will create new recreational and educational opportunities for the residents. They will be able to get closer to the water, enjoy it and learn more about it. Other details of the project are still being worked out. Later this year when the options are more developed, we look forward to consulting Mr De Souza and his community leaders in ensuring that the eventual design meets the community&rsquo;s needs. Construction on the project is scheduled to start in the third quarter of&nbsp;next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond engaging the community in the design stage, we also look to the community to take ownership of the project over time, eg,&nbsp;in organising activities at the project and helping to keep the waters clean. We look forward to the enthusiasm and strong support of each and everyone in Singapore to make the ABC Waters Programme a success.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> <B>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B> Sir, I thank the&nbsp;Minister&nbsp;for his reply.

Through upfront ownership taxes, road tax and fuel tax, the Government seeks to manage road use. This is complemented by the ERP, which manages peak congestion. Naturally, however, measures to reduce or manage road congestion are also environmentally-friendly. Further, the structure of our taxes does in fact encourage people to use vehicles that are fuel-efficient and produce less emissions.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we provide a Green Vehicle Rebate (GVR), which is calibrated so that a typical hybrid car does not attract higher upfront ownership taxes than the equivalent conventional car&nbsp;&ndash; despite the higher Open Market Value (OMV) of a hybrid car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, road taxes, which are based on engine capacity,&nbsp;are higher for bigger cars, which tend to consume more fuel and produce more emissions than small cars.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we have also taken environmental considerations into account when setting fuel taxes. In Budget 2008, the special tax rate for Euro-IV diesel cars was reduced significantly, in recognition of their improved emission standards compared to pre-Euro-IV diesel cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In determining the special tax to be imposed on Euro-V compliant diesel engines, the Government will consider the fuel-efficiency and emission standards of Euro-V cars relative to both Euro-IV and petrol cars.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 1478</p>\r\n\r\n<B>Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> I thank the Minister for his response.

Would the Minister not agree that our tax structure should encourage or at least not penalise the use of more fuel-efficient vehicles? Put it another way,&nbsp;if the regime makes it cheaper to buy and maintain a less fuel-efficient car, does that not mean the regime is flawed?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> First, I quite agree with Mr Hri Kumar that we should not and, in fact, we do not penalise more fuel-efficient cars. The whole structure of our tax system for vehicles today, in fact, does not penalise more fuel-efficient cars&nbsp;&ndash; it rewards them. Road tax is a classic example of that. But even by way of our tax on fuel, the petrol tax taken together with the special tax for diesel, it is clear that we are rewarding more fuel-efficient vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We reduce the special tax significantly from something like four times of the road tax to 2.7 times of the road tax in Budget 2008, in recognition of the fact that it is more environmentally-friendly than the pre-Euro-IV cars. We will take a look at the Euro-V very carefully, study its emission standards. If it is true that it got much lower carbon emissions compared to petrol cars, but it does have slightly higher particulate matter emissions. These are things we will study and find the appropriate special tax to impose. But on his basic questions, we do not penalise more fuel-efficient cars. We do not penalise more environmentally-friendly cars. At the margin, we have, in fact, favoured them. And the calculation of what we achieved through the green vehicle rebate together with the road tax structure, does point to that.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:HDB RENTAL FLATS--><p align=left>Column: 1479<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:HDB RENTAL FLATS:::1481-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>HDB RENTAL FLATS</span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Waiting period and criteria-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Waiting period and criteria)</span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hri Kumar Nair-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.&nbsp; <B>Mr Hri Kumar Nair</B> asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the current average waiting period for the allocation of rental flats; (b) how does the Ministry prioritise applications; and (c) whether there is any requirement for occupiers of rental flats to take active steps to improve their financial position.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman) (for the Minister for National Development):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, about a year ago, the average waiting period for a rental flat was 21 months.&nbsp;I am pleased to inform the Member that the average waiting period currently has dropped to about 13 months.

On the demand side, in February this year, Members will recall that HDB introduced a set of revised rental eligibility criteria. For those who have enjoyed one housing subsidy, HDB will take into account their assets, including proceeds from the last flat sale. Those who previously owned private property will not qualify for a rental flat.&nbsp;In addition, if the applicant has children who own private property or HDB flat with room(s) that may accommodate him, he would not qualify.&nbsp; Approved applicants are added to the queue according to their date of applications.&nbsp;For those already in the rental queue before February this year&nbsp;when the revised eligibility criteria took effect, they will retain their queue \r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 1480</p>\r\npositions if they satisfy the revised criteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rental tenants, especially younger households, are encouraged to work towards home ownership.

Even for those who have downgraded, meaning that they have sold their flats and they really need rental flats, we do not see rental flats as the end point for them, but it is transitional.&nbsp; Hopefully,&nbsp;they can continue to improve their circumstances and, therefore, move up and go for another home ownership flat.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar):</B> Can&nbsp; the Ministry consider stepping up some publicity to build awareness for the new tightened criteria for rental flat applications?

Some of the solutions that HDB explore with these households include: (a) subletting a spare room; (b) including working family members to share the loan burden; and (c) reducing the monthly instalments by extending the loan repayment period.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding these options, if they still cannot afford to keep their flat, HDB will help them to downgrade, by providing them an additional loan that they can afford. However, despite providing ample time and assistance, HDB occasionally encounters lessees who are not willing to work towards a sustainable financial solution.&nbsp;In such cases, HDB has no choice but to undertake compulsory acquisition but, only as a last resort, to prevent their debt from accumulating further.&nbsp;Even after HDB issues its letter of intent to compulsorily acquire the flat, HDB will still allow the lessee to sell his flat in the open market if he is serious about doing so without further delay.&nbsp;This is evident from the small number of flats recovered by HDB compared with the number of accounts in arrears.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Sir, HDB's intention is really not to displace families.&nbsp; HDB's intention is to help families manage their arrear situation, and&nbsp;many of them have accumulated their arrears quite significantly.&nbsp; What HDB is trying to do is to prevent them from accumulating their arrears further so that they do not come into a situation where their outstanding loan becomes larger than&nbsp;their original loan, which means that they have accumulated so much interest that the loan has become&nbsp;larger or that the property value is lower than the outstanding loan, which means they are in negative equity.&nbsp; So when HDB advises them to sell their flats, it is effectively to advise them to downgrade hopefully to a flat that is more affordable to them.&nbsp; How does HDB help them?&nbsp; They will look at some of the possible alternatives after that.&nbsp; Firstly,&nbsp;we look at the possibility of&nbsp;granting them another loan.&nbsp; If they are really in financial difficulties, HDB is prepared to give them another loan to downgrade.&nbsp; Some of the challenges that these families have&nbsp;are that their income is not high enough or they are not able to afford a loan that will allow them to purchase another flat, which means that they are not ready to own another home, as I mentioned earlier in the&nbsp;reply.&nbsp; As such, we look at other options.&nbsp; Do they have family members who are able to accommodate them while they&nbsp;try to save&nbsp;to improve on their financial situation and purchase another flat?&nbsp; Secondly, we will also refer them to the CDCs to see whether they can improve on their earning capacity so that they are able to get another loan from HDB subsequently.&nbsp; The other alternative that we have is to offer them&nbsp;interim rental housing which is a scheme that HDB has put in place where the managing agents of HDB flats&nbsp;manage some of these flats and they will refer these families for interim housing.&nbsp; We do \r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 1485</p>\r\n\r\nnot want the families to be entrenched in such interim housing but it is meant for temporary accommodation while they work towards longer-term solutions.&nbsp; So, effectively, there are options available for some of these families.&nbsp; If they really cannot find other options, we will consider them for rental&nbsp;flats.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The resident is asked to sell the flat because the arrear is too high or HDB has to resell or repossess the flat.&nbsp; He could not get a HLE, a loan from HDB, because he is not qualified or he is required to upgrade, but obviously he cannot upgrade;&nbsp;he has no relative or family member to share accommodation with and he has no financial means to go and rent premises from the open market&nbsp;because the rent&nbsp;is too high.&nbsp; So what is the alternative?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman</B>:&nbsp; Sir, as I have mentioned earlier, given the description by Mr Low, one of the options that we will offer them is the interim rental housing.&nbsp; This is a short-term rental housing to help them with accommodation&nbsp;if, as Mr Low mentioned, they really do not have any other rental accommodation options.&nbsp; Of course, we would prefer that they continue to stay with their family, if they have family members&nbsp;to support them.&nbsp; While they are staying in the interim rental housing, we will look and explore other possibilities, like how we can&nbsp;support and help them.&nbsp; The reasons why they are not earning or not working will have to be explored.&nbsp; These are situations where we need case management by the social service sector to be able to help some of these families.&nbsp; I think if Mr Low has a specific case in mind&nbsp;and would like to refer it to us, we would be more than glad to review the case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE--><p align=left>Column: 1486<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE:::1487-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The infections may also be non-invasive causing conditions such as middle-ear infections and sinusitis.&nbsp; In Singapore, there were about 70 hospitalisations among children under&nbsp;five years of age for pneumococcal disease every year.&nbsp; Since 2000, we have recorded seven deaths among young children from invasive pneumococcal disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, a vaccine is available to protect children against this disease.&nbsp;

Insurance companies are required to have sound risk management systems and maintain adequate financial resources in order to meet their obligations to policyholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry regulates Medisave-approved Integrated Shield Plans to ensure that they make proper use of Medisave monies for the welfare of policyholders. We require the Integrated Shield Plans to focus on catastrophic coverage where risk-pooling is most effective. They must retain the core co-payment principle through features such as deductibles and co-insurance. This is to discourage over-consumption and help to keep premiums affordable.&nbsp; Before a plan \r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1488<p>\r\ncan be marketed, it is scrutinised by my Ministry to ensure that it complies with these basic requirements.&nbsp; The insurers compete to provide their policyholders with the most cost-effective insurance protection over their lifetime in the most sustainable manner.&nbsp; We encourage them to innovate with new product features but we discourage comprehensive first dollar coverage which has led to many moral hazard problems elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We encourage insurers to be transparent and upfront with their customers by keeping their terms and conditions simple and clear.

The gender distribution of trainees was fairly equal with females taking up slightly more than half the training places. About two-thirds of the trainees possessed secondary and below education, while the remaining one-third had post-secondary education. About two-thirds of the trainees were Chinese, Malays made up one-fifth, with&nbsp;the rest of the trainees&nbsp;Indians and other races.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers have shown support in the training of mature workers. Approximately half of the workers sent for training by employers were mature workers. Take for example Robinsons' group, a well-known retailer&nbsp;and a strong believer in people development through training. Robinsons has been very supportive of the Retail WSQ programme. As an in-house approved training organisation (ATO), they have developed two Retail WSQ modules called \"The Service Ambassador\" and made it compulsory for all frontline operations staff to attend. Apart from this, Robinsons also organised the Retail WSQ programme Certificate in Retail Operations conducted by the Singapore Institute for Retail Studies (SIRS). In all, Robinsons had&nbsp;taken up&nbsp;938\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1491<p>\r\ntraining places in year 2009, of which, about half, 408&nbsp;were taken up by mature workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <I>Adult Training Survey</I> conducted in 2008 by my Ministry showed that older workers had benefited from training in different ways.&nbsp; For example, 60% of employed workers aged 50-64 who underwent training over the 12 months ending June 2008 reported that the training had enabled them to be more productive at work, comparable to the average of 58% for all workers who underwent training.&nbsp; Forty-two percent of these&nbsp;older&nbsp;workers felt that they were able to deliver better service, higher than the average of 38% across all ages.&nbsp;Older workers also indicated that training had enabled them to retain their job or to obtain a permanent job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is Ms Chandriga d/o Krishnasamy. Ms Chandriga, a mature worker,&nbsp;was working as a part-time security officer earning about $300 a month when she registered with the&nbsp;Central CDC in January 2009. As she had an interest in cooking, the CDC supported her training in Workplace Skills courses under the Employability Skills System (ESS) followed by the Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) in Food Production conducted by At-Sunrice. Ms Chandriga completed the course in May 2009 and is now employed full-time in a Japanese restaurant, earning about $1,200 per month. She is a good example of how age is never a barrier to learning new skills and moving into better jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would encourage companies to support the training of all their workers regardless of age.&nbsp; This is an important strategy for us&nbsp;to continue to enhance our productivity and&nbsp;competitiveness.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> &nbsp; I think the statistics and figures are really heartening. \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1492<p>\r\nIt shows that the older workers are very willing to go for training and the companies that have sent them for the training are truly commendable and also it shows that they have benefited from it.&nbsp; What I would like to ask the Minister is despite this, older workers continue to raise concerns that they face obstacles in getting employment, therefore what more can we do in view of the fact that they are flexible and prepared to go for training.&nbsp; One of the common complaints raised by employers is they are inflexible, they are not prepared to go for training, they are not productive but the figures the Minister has cited show otherwise, what more can we do to remove the obstacles to employment of older workers?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, employment of older workers is a very important issue and Members will know we have announced in this House before that we are going to introduce re-employment legislation&nbsp;by 2012, that will require employers to offer re-employment opportunities for all workers who reach the age of 62.&nbsp; This is one important step towards enhancing the employment of older workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;If older workers were to be employed effectively, the employers must continue to provide training and upgrading for these older workers so that their skills can remain relevant to the industries that we are moving into.&nbsp; From the Government's point of view, we will continue to work with our tripartite partners, through our tripartite workgroups, on the&nbsp;implementation of re-employment to reach out to companies even ahead of the introduction of the re-employment legislation; to encourage companies to be early adopters of these re-employment practices.&nbsp; We will also provide funding and help through our Advantage!

First, MDA requires MediaCorp to outsource a minimum number of local content hours to independent production companies annually.&nbsp; Currently, about 35% of local PSB production hours are outsourced to independent production companies, and this is an increase compared to 26% in 2005.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, we have a more competitive and creative environment and this approach has also helped to ensure a constant flow of fresh programme ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, MDA has also introduced direct commissioning of PSB programmes since 2007 to bring about competition for PSB funds.&nbsp;Today, about 10% of the total PSB funds are set aside for this purpose.&nbsp; MDA invites independent production companies as well as MediaCorp&rsquo;s production units to pitch ideas to develop high-quality programmes that would appeal not only to Singapore viewers but also to an international audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of this and other measures, Singaporeans today enjoy a greater range of content choices and higher quality productions from PSB funding.&nbsp;Some of our local PSB programmes received the highest ratings on their respective channels.&nbsp;They have also won international accolades.&nbsp;Last year, our local PSB programmes won 20 awards and 16 other nominations at renowned international award events. Our local productions are also being acquired by established regional media players and channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1495<p>\r\nOn the usage of PSB funds, MDA recognises the importance of ensuring transparency and accountability, and adopts a stringent approval process.&nbsp; In addition to discussions on programming strategies and PSB themes, in-principle approval from MDA is required before a production is commissioned to ensure the programme meets specific PSB objectives. Regular comprehensive reviews of the annual PSB Funding Agreement are conducted to ensure that MediaCorp has fulfilled its commitments in terms of total output and range of PSB programmes as well as outsourced production requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MDA also sets target viewership ratings and Programme Appreciation Index as Key Performance Indicators for PSB programmes.&nbsp;The latter is measured in terms of the level of informative value, relevance, enjoyment and effectiveness in promoting social values, and our culture and heritage.&nbsp;MDA conducts quarterly PSB Appreciation Surveys to determine the Programme Appreciation Index. The survey results have been positive and encouraging. The past four surveys over the last year, showed that eight out of 10 Most Appreciated Programmes were PSB-funded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MDA also receives regular feedback from its various advisory committees on the range and quality of TV and radio programming, including PSB programmes.&nbsp; Such feedback helps to enhance the overall quality of PSB programmes going forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MDA is commissioning an independent review of the effectiveness and efficiency of PSB funding, and will use the findings to develop other meaningful key performance indicators for PSB programmes.&nbsp; Let me conclude by saying that&nbsp;MDA will exercise proper oversight of how PSB funds are used and continue to \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1496<p>\r\nwork with the industry and stakeholders to enhance the quality of local productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Calvin Cheng (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Calvin Cheng (Nominated Member):</B> Thank you,&nbsp;Minister, for&nbsp;your comprehensive answer.

That has grown by about 10%, and in part, the limit is determined by the amount of radio and TV licence fees as well as the cost of production. Increasingly, we note that&nbsp;the cost of quality production has increased and what we want to try and do is to have about 35% of the money that we channel over to MediaCorp, perhaps be channelled into independent production houses so&nbsp;that there is a variety of programme genres, a variety of&nbsp; programmes not necessarily&nbsp;from MediaCorp alone. Rather than talk about subsidising,&nbsp;we&nbsp;work in partnership with MediaCorp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, MDA stepped in to&nbsp;co-fund \"The Little Nonya\". In part we did this, not knowing that it would be&nbsp;a commercial success. But&nbsp;we felt that \"The Little Nonya\"&nbsp;offered the opportunity to shine the spotlight on local culture and&nbsp;heritage.&nbsp; And together with the opening of the Peranakan Museum, I think it indeed had brought Peranakan culture to the forefront over the past 18 months or so. In doing so, we also retained the rights to subsequent revenue streams as a \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1497<p>\r\nresult of DVD sales or sales to overseas media&nbsp;and broadcasting companies.&nbsp;So we enjoy part of the success that follows from this production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to add that, if we have not gone in to work with MediaCorp on this, there is a possibility that \"The Little Nonya\" would not have been produced in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost was actually quite a bit higher than the usual drama series, because of the sets,&nbsp;expensive costumes and the amount of research that had to be conducted for this to be a viable production. So what we will&nbsp;do&nbsp;is to work with MediaCorp on the best ideas and&nbsp;determine which are the ones that deserve funding.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>3.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker:</B>&nbsp; Order.&nbsp; End of Question time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<I>Pursuant to Standing Order No. 22(3), Written Answers to Question Nos.&nbsp;19, 21-22&nbsp;and 25&nbsp;on the Order Paper are reproduced in the Appendix*.&nbsp;&nbsp;Question Nos. 18, 20, 23-24 and 26-32&nbsp;have been postponed to the next available sitting of Parliament.</I>]</p>\r\n</div></span><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr>*Cols. 1539-1546.<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n<!--SECTION_NAME:BILLS-->\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<p align=\"left\">Column: 1497</p>\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:COPYRIGHT (AMENDMENT) BILL-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:COPYRIGHT (AMENDMENT) BILL:::1501-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>COPYRIGHT (AMENDMENT) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc.

Hence, this&nbsp;Bill seeks to update the Tribunal&rsquo;s scope of coverage, to ensure that the Tribunal remains relevant in the face of these technological advances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS)&nbsp;conducted a round of public consultations over six weeks from 11th February to 24th March last year to solicit views on possible changes to the Copyright Tribunal. &nbsp;It received valuable feedback from IP rights organisations, academics and user groups which were carefully considered.&nbsp; Where appropriate, they have been incorporated in the provisions of this Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now&nbsp;highlight the key amendments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the amendment to expand the Tribunal&rsquo;s jurisdiction over all types of copyright works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, under the existing Copyright Act, the Tribunal&rsquo;s jurisdiction is confined to disputes over specified types of copyright works for a limited number of uses.&nbsp; For example, the Tribunal can hear disputes over the fees payable for making copies of literary works by educational institutions for teaching purposes, or the making of recordings and films of works for the purpose of broadcasting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This limits the ability of the Copyright Tribunal to deal with copyright disputes \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1499<p>\r\narising from new technological advances.&nbsp; For example, the reproduction and storage of digital sound recordings in hard disks for commercial use is prevalent today.&nbsp; However, disputes arising from such use do not currently come under the purview of the Tribunal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendment, therefore, seeks to refine the Tribunal&rsquo;s jurisdiction to allow the Tribunal to play its intended role in the face of technological developments.&nbsp; With the proposed amendment, the Tribunal will be able to hear licence disputes relating to all types of copyright works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the second amendment seeks to refine the scope of the Tribunal&rsquo;s jurisdiction to cover licensors who are in the business of collectively administering copyright licences for different copyright owners.&nbsp; This change is mainly in recognition of the fact that licensors such as collecting societies and commercial agencies are capable of amassing a wide repertoire of copyright works. &nbsp;As such, they are able to adopt a relatively strong bargaining position vis-&agrave;-vis licensees or businesses that make use of the copyright works under their purview. &nbsp;In this way, the Copyright Tribunal can act as a check against licensors imposing unreasonable licensing fees and terms. &nbsp;IPOS intends, in due course, to enact regulations to further amplify this provision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Individual copyright owners will be excluded from the Tribunal&rsquo;s jurisdiction.&nbsp; This approach of excluding individual copyright owners is also the practice in Australia and the United Kingdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A third amendment is to empower the Tribunal to vary the terms of any licence scheme, to the extent of substituting the licence scheme, as deemed reasonable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently under the Copyright Act, the Tribunal is only authorised to vary a \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1500<p>\r\nlicence scheme.&nbsp; The current provisions do not expressly empower the Tribunal to substitute a new scheme. However, in practice, the Tribunal may have to order a copyright licence scheme to be substantially varied if justified on the facts of a case.&nbsp; In doing so, the question may then arise as to whether such changes have the effect of substituting a new scheme, which the Tribunal does not appear to be empowered to do under the current provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This amendment will provide certainty that the Tribunal can&nbsp;do so, that is to say, the Copyright Tribunal, in order to make rulings that are reasonable and fair in a broad range of circumstances, may substantially vary an existing licence scheme, to the extent of substituting it with a new scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;on amendments to the structure of the Copyright Tribunal,&nbsp;the Copyright Act provides for the appointment of&nbsp;one President and up to four other members. &nbsp;Each Copyright Tribunal hearing requires a quorum comprising the President and at least&nbsp;two members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In practice, with so few members appointed, this can pose difficulties in convening the Tribunal promptly as the Tribunal members&rsquo; personal schedules may be conflicted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed amendments will give the Minister the powers to appoint two more Deputy Presidents and up to 15 members to the Copyright Tribunal.&nbsp; This will provide a bigger pool of members to fill the three requisite positions to convene a Tribunal hearing.&nbsp; The amendments also empower the Deputy Presidents to preside over Tribunal proceedings in place of the President.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the expansion of the Tribunal&rsquo;s scope of jurisdiction may result in an increase in the number of cases, these amendments will allow multiple tribunals \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1501<p>\r\nto be held concurrently, if such a need arises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion&nbsp;&ndash; in summary, these amendments will expand and clarify the powers as well as improve the operations of the Copyright Tribunal to ensure that it can effectively and expeditiously discharge its duties to hear all copyright disputes in the face of continuing changes in technology and usage of copyright works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 12.75pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 12.75pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 12.75pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.&nbsp;&ndash; [Assoc.

Self-Exclusion is where an individual voluntarily decides to exclude himself or herself from casinos. Third-Party Exclusions cover some 29,000 undischarged bankrupts and beneficiaries of the Public Assistance and Special Grant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1503<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NCPG has conducted fairly extensive discussions with the public, stakeholders and its partners on the exclusion process.&nbsp; Following these discussions, it has rolled out the Family Exclusion process in April this year.&nbsp; On the other hand,&nbsp;one key feedback it has received is that it should simplify and shorten its Self and Third-Party Exclusion processes so as to more efficiently and effectively protect those who are vulnerable towards problem gambling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NCPG has recommended three amendments to the Act, which the Government supports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, to remove the need for a Committee of Assessors to convene and decide on exclusion for Self and Third-Party.&nbsp; There is no need for any \"judgment\" or exercise of discretion for the decision on such exclusions because Self-Exclusion is voluntary and Third-Party is by fiat. &nbsp;For the same reason, the opportunity to object and appeal against an order for Third-Party Exclusion has been removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, to remove the need for hard copy notifications for both Self and Third-Party exclusions. Those who have bankruptcy petitions against them or who are applying for Public Assistance and Special Grant would already be notified of potential casino exclusion as part of the administrative process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And lastly, to enable the Council to notify the casinos, Casino Regulatory Authority and the Police of exclusions via electronic means, as opposed to informing them using paper documents.&nbsp; This will facilitate the administration process for exclusion orders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, once approved, the provisions of the Act will come into force by&nbsp;15th October 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1504<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>3.12 pm</p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak on the Second Reading of the Casino Control&nbsp;(Amendment) Bill and I am glad that this Bill is being tightened further.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, who could have forgotten the TV advertisement, where a father pleads with his daughter to break into her piggy bank to fuel his gambling addiction.&nbsp; Very touching but, at the same time, extremely disturbing.&nbsp; It shows the abysmal depth to which a gambler might descend, to feed his perverse and insatiable addiction to gambling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a 2007 survey by the National Council on Problem Gambling, nearly all the respondents welcomed the casino exclusion order and said that they would apply for casino expulsion orders to ban family members having gambling problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is&nbsp;the good piece of news. &nbsp;On the flip side, the survey&nbsp;indicates that the number of people who felt that gambling&nbsp;could lead to an unhappy family life, has decreased. There is a new-found acceptance towards gambling.&nbsp; Many more gamblers believed that having the right gambling skills could lead to a large payoff and the number of gamblers, with a dogged determination to recover what they lost, had doubled according to the survey. Therefore the $100 entry levy or $2,000 annual membership might have little impact on gamblers, and you do not even have to be hardcore addicts, to try to \"<I>cheong</I> \" as much as you can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports&nbsp;did a survey on Participation in Gambling\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1505<p>\r\nactivities among Singapore Residents in the year 2008. &nbsp;The Chinese are well known for their fondness for gambling but what is disturbing is that, over the span of three years, between 2005 and 2008, the number of Malay and Indian gamblers has increased from 12% to 22% and 30% to 36% respectively. The number of low income earners, those earning up to $2,000 monthly, gamble more and the numbers are increasing, according to&nbsp;the survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these are worrisome facts and figures. &nbsp;We decided to go ahead with the casino project to give a fillip to our economy and in particular our tourism sector but what about those poor, weak-willed, easily-led, misguided individuals amongst us who are unable to resist temptation?&nbsp; What are we going to do about them? How are we going to rein them in?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my views on the Integrated Resorts (IRs)&nbsp;are known but I welcome the further tightening of the screws to filter out the \"Exclusives.\"&nbsp; They might not realise the good \"fortune\"&nbsp;that we are bringing upon them by restricting their presence at the IRs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, persons on Public Assistance, undischarged bankrupts and those who make a voluntary application for exclusion are excluded from the casinos,</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>but now with the doing away of the Committee of Assessors for the issuance of the exclusion order, makes life easier and hassle-free for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has come a long way over the past&nbsp;50 years.&nbsp; The hard-earned wealth that Singapore painstakingly accumulated over the years helps to pay for several social programmes like Public Assistance.&nbsp; We do not want to have instances where our ComCare and other Public Assistance programme beneficiaries, instead of using the money given \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1506<p>\r\nto alleviate their hardship, blow it on chips, blackjack and the one-armed bandit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these amendments allow for automatic exclusion of undischarged bankrupts and persons on Government social assistance.&nbsp; The concept itself is good, since undischarged bankrupts and persons on Government social assistance really should not be gambling at casinos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These amendments make it administratively easier, as well as send a strong message across that gambling is not for those who cannot afford to do so and this approach is to be commended. However, the question is: how is the casino going to implement this on the ground? &nbsp;Will they be doing ID checks on&nbsp;all patrons?&nbsp; Sir, this is not the normal kind of ID checks that clubs would do, ie, that of checking age, but this would probably require a computer database and an efficient checking process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extra effort must be taken by the authorities to ensure that the list of those excluded is regularly and thoroughly maintained to prevent misunderstanding. A person who is no longer a bankrupt or on Public Assistance may wish to explore the casino but if a non-updated list prevents him or her from entering, the negative effects on the casino, our tourism sector and our much-vaunted efficiency would be far greater.&nbsp; Casinos overseas do not have such stringent checks.&nbsp; Would it be a deterrent, albeit a small one, to tourists if the checks are slow and hamper entry into the casino?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, how is \"poor credit record\" under the existing&nbsp; section 165(1)(c) defined?&nbsp; This is the only instance in which the Committee has discretion in making an exclusion order against a person, but it is not clearly defined under the Act.&nbsp; Would the Minister consider clarifying what \"poor credit record\" means, so as to\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1507<p>\r\npromote transparency in making exclusion orders?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the amendments on the casino tax provide a more nuanced approach to taxation of gaming profits.&nbsp; Previously, profits were taxed without regard to whether the casino was a party to the wager.&nbsp; The amendments clarified that (i) profits earned from games where casino is a party to the wager are taxable, and (ii) moneys received from games where casino merely conducts the game are taxable.&nbsp; In practice, how will the taxman know how much the casino earns through either method?&nbsp; If false declarations are made, will the taxman be able to find out?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While there is a deterrent found in the current legislation&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;allowing for the collection of up to&nbsp;four times of the underpaid tax&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;is this sufficient to prevent deliberate under-declaration of income, especially when it is so easy to do so?&nbsp; At the same time, is it too harsh to impose personal criminal liability on those who make incorrect returns or give any incorrect information in relation to any matter affecting a casino operator&rsquo;s liability to pay tax?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, first of all, this offence does not require any guilty intent &ndash; instead, the moment the person makes an incorrect return or gives any incorrect information, he is guilty, whether he intended to evade tax or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, is it fair to hold individuals criminally responsible? Would it be better instead to hold the casino operator company criminally responsible?&nbsp; Yes, there is a stronger deterrent effect in holding individuals criminally responsible but we must remember who benefits the most at the end of the day.&nbsp; If there is tax evasion &ndash; it is the company rather than the individuals running it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1508<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two points coupled together make it especially harsh to hold individuals criminally liable &ndash; they do not benefit directly, and yet can be held criminally liable even if they were merely negligent (rather than actively trying to evade tax) in preparing tax returns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on this note, I support the Casino Control (Amendment) Bill.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.20 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Christopher de Souza:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the main amendments to the Casino Control Act is that those who give incorrect tax returns on gaming revenue will face stiffer penalties.&nbsp; In addition to paying double the underpaid amount, they can be fined up to $25,000 or jailed for up to two years or both.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support this amendment under section 149A of the Bill.&nbsp; This will send a clear signal to the casino operators to put in place rigorous accounting processes to ensure that their relevant departments and staff adhere to the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other major amendment is to automatically exclude from the casino un-discharged bankrupts, persons on Public Assistance as well as those who voluntarily want to be kept out, thereby removing the need for a Committee of Assessors to make an exclusion order in respect of each such person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to make three points arising from these amendments, and the family exclusion orders which already exist in the Act:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, we cannot rely on pathological gamblers or probable problem gamblers to self exclude themselves.&nbsp; Incidentally, these terms \"pathological\" or \"problem gamblers\" are phrases used in a 2008\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1509<p>\r\nMCYS Report on Participation in Gambling Activities Amongst Singaporean Residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, family exclusion orders which already exist in the Act under sections 158 to 164, which allow families to apply for exclusion of problem gamblers from casinos, are also unlikely to have much impact as I understand that, to date, only 14 families have gone beyond enquiring about these orders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to NCPG, Singapore is the second place in the world to have such family exclusion orders, after the state of South Australia, where only 170 enquiries were received between July 2004 and July 2008.&nbsp; According to a&nbsp;<I>Straits Times</I>&nbsp;report on 2nd April this year, \"If South Australia's experience is any guide, however, Singapore will see few applications for family exclusion orders.&nbsp; In the four years up to last June, there were 18 applications for such orders in the Australian state, and only eight were issued.&nbsp; The rest were dismissed or withdrawn.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third point is that&nbsp;I think it is important to remember the objective of the Casino Regulatory Authority (CRA),&nbsp;which is captured in section 8 of the Act.&nbsp; In particular, section 8(c) reads:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"The objects of the Authority are to maintain and administer systems for the licensing, supervision and control of casinos, for the purpose of containing and controlling the potential of a casino to cause harm to minors, vulnerable persons and [importantly] society at large.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, it is an object of the CRA to study and stem the negative social implications of casinos beyond the casino, ie, \"in society at large\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, my proposal is to make it explicit in the Bill, or at least in the Minister&rsquo;s reply in this debate, that the \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1510<p>\r\nCRA is empowered to work with NCPG and MHA to track whether the casinos are creating irreversible damage to our social fabric in the form of:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) money-laundering activities;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) rise in problem gambling and the effects it has on families;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) growing number of people resorting to loans from loan sharks; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) an increase in prostitution syndicates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also proposed that the Bill, or the Minister&rsquo;s reply, should make it explicit that the CRA is empowered to collect data on these social implications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CRA can be empowered to take on this co-ordination and data-collection role through an avenue which already exists in the original Act, namely, section 10(2)(d) which states that the CRA may \"carry out research or other educational activities relating to casino gaming, or to support (financially or otherwise) the carrying out by others of such activities or the provision by others of information or advice\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I ask, should not the CRA be empowered under section 10(2)(d) read with its object as stated under section 8(c) to become the co-ordinating body between MHA and NCPG so that it will have enough data to accurately calibrate the level of regulation of casinos to ensure a minimal amount of negative social impact on Singaporeans and their families and a reduced amount of casino related offences, like money laundering, soliciting and loansharking?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, NCPG is primarily dedicated towards preventing problem gamblers from gambling and MHA is committed to fighting crime.&nbsp; Their roles are separate, distinct.&nbsp; Whereas, to battle the negative \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1511<p>\r\nsocial implications which the casinos will bring, we need to have synergies between these organisations.&nbsp; This will translate into a clear understanding of what is an effective level of casino regulation.&nbsp; This role should be fulfilled by the CRA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A further avenue to provide the CRA with such power is section 9(2) of the original Act which states:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"The Authority may undertake such other functions and duties as the Minister may assign to the Authority and in so doing, the Authority shall be deemed to be fulfilling the purposes of this Act &hellip;\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My proposal for empowering the CRA to:<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) possess oversight of the social implications casino gambling has on Singaporeans&nbsp;&ndash; these implications being problem gambling, loan sharking, money laundering and heightened vice activities, and (thereby);</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) calibrate its regulation of casinos to minimise such negative social implications finds support in the second reading of the original Bill where&nbsp;Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng stated:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"... having casinos could mean more people gambling and getting themselves&nbsp;&ndash; and their families&nbsp;&ndash; into trouble. Concerns were expressed that crimes, such as loan sharking, money laundering and prostitution, could increase and tarnish Singapore's reputation as a clean, safe and secure place ...\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deputy Prime Minister Wong&rsquo;s candid statement finds support in empirical data. According to the Credit Counselling Singapore (CCS), the number of debt-distressed individuals who cite gambling as a major cause of their financial problem grew from 12.7% in 2006 to 27.5% in 2008.&nbsp; The percentage more than doubled.&nbsp; \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1512<p>\r\nEven more worrying, younger people, age 40 and below, make up a bigger proportion or 60.7% of this group of debtors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that the major pre-occupation of the Act and this Bill is to empower the CRA to regulate only what happens in the casino.&nbsp; This would be ineffective to battle negative social implications outside of the casino, ie,&nbsp; in the society at large, which is an explicit priority of the CRA under section 8(c).&nbsp; So as to achieve this objective, would the Minister consider the proposal to empower the CRA to (1) carry out the co-ordinating and data collection function between MHA and NCPG in order that (2) it is armed with valuable insight into the social implications casino gambling has on Singaporeans&nbsp;&ndash; these implications being problem gambling, loansharking, money laundering and heightened vice activities, which information will (3) allow the CRA to calibrate its regulation of casinos to minimise such negative social implications in society at large.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This proposal is consistent with the object of the CRA under section 8(c) of the original Act and the broad power it can be given under two other sections of the original Act, namely, section 10(2)(d) and section 9(2). &nbsp;This proposal will also allow the CRA to take on a more effective role in minimising the social implications of problem gambling outside of the casino, ie, in Singapore society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the amendments but seek the Minister&rsquo;s reply on my proposal which attempts to make the regulatory framework tighter and more effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.29 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member):</B> Sir, the public was asked to accept the potential social fallout from casinos due to their projected economic benefits, including tax revenue.&nbsp; Thus, it \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1513<p>\r\nis interesting that the Bill introduces clause 7 which allows the Minister to remit the tax on gaming revenue if he considers it just and equitable.&nbsp; I am aware that a similar provision exists in other tax legislation, such as the Income Tax Act and the Property Tax Act, giving the Minister power to remit those taxes if he considers it just and equitable.&nbsp; However, in the context of the Integrated Resorts, under what circumstances would it be just and equitable to forgive the casino tax due from a casino operator?&nbsp; Could the Minister clarify whether there is concern about the viability of the IRs due to the mixed projections put forth by the various analysts?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another provision which should be clarified is clause 4 concerning the new section 146B.&nbsp; In particular, section 146B, sub-section (5), provides that if a casino operator does not submit tax returns for two consecutive accounting periods, then the Comptroller of Income Tax can take this into account in making his assessment.&nbsp; In particular, it is provided that the Comptroller can take the failure into account and make an assessment of \"an amount of casino tax greater than that</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>which he would otherwise have considered to be appropriate.\" Does this mean that the amount of tax is going to be over-assessed because the casino operator failed to file returns?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This does not seem to be an appropriate response. By contrast, other tax legislation, such as the Income Tax Act, makes it an offence not to file returns, which attracts certain penalties and fines which, on principle, seems more justifiable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 8 introduces the offence of making an incorrect return or giving incorrect information. This becomes an offence under new section 149A and it is punishable with the following&nbsp;&ndash; a penalty of double the tax underpaid due to the error, and either fine or imprisonment or \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1514<p>\r\nboth. This section is worded very generally and does not distinguish between errors which are deliberately or recklessly made, and errors made after due diligence was exercised. By contrast, the corresponding provision under the Income Tax Act, section 95, clearly distinguishes between the two types of errors&nbsp;&ndash; those made under due diligence are punishable only by a penalty equivalent to the tax which was underpaid. Under the proposed section 149A, errors made after due diligence will also potentially attract double tax and fine or imprisonment. Why does the provision not distinguish between the two types of errors?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, regarding Exclusion Orders, I am glad to note that the new section 165A provides for the blanket exclusion of undischarged bankrupts, from entering the casino, rather than a cumbersome case-by-case approach. This blanket exclusion for undischarged bankrupts, in effect, adopts a suggestion made by the Member for Hougang, Mr Low Thia Khiang, in 2006, when the Bill was first debated.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Order.&nbsp; I propose to take the break now.

Prof. Paulin Tay Straughan:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;thank you for this opportunity to speak on this Bill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I followed the discourse on the introduction of Integrated Resorts to the Singapore landscape when the proposal \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1515<p>\r\nwas first discussed in April 2005 and, subsequently, in February 2006 when the Casino Control Bill was debated and passed. Personally, I think it is important that after the extensive public consultation with the respective concerned parties, the decision taken by the Government was that individual Singaporeans should be entrusted to make their own decisions on whether they want to participate in the casino activities. Nonetheless, as a community, we are also concerned about the implications of having two IRs in Singapore on the vulnerable segments of our population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With your permission, Sir, I would like to speak on this aspect of the amendment &ndash; the clauses that aim to protect vulnerable segments of our community from the ill-effects of gambling. In the consideration of Exclusion Orders, we have to be cognizant of the delicate balance between seeking preventive measures and the impediment of civil liberties. I am of the view that we should only invoke the law in extreme cases where vulnerable individuals cannot protect themselves, and the gains from invoking the Exclusion Orders outweigh the social costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 14 seeks to insert a new section 165A to the Bill, which invokes an automatic exclusion from entering, remaining in and gaming in a casino, individuals who are on social assistance funded by the Government or a statutory body. I find resonance with this exclusion clause as individuals who are in need of financial assistance should not have surplus for funding gambling activities. In addition to Government or statutory bodies, there are also private agencies which offer financial assistance to the vulnerable poor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask the Minister if there is a mechanism for these private philan\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1516<p>\r\nthropies to seek to exclude their beneficiaries from participating in casino gaming?<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clauses 15 and 16 relate to the Family Exclusion Order.&nbsp;There are several concerns I have with the Family Exclusion Order, which&nbsp;have not, in my opinion, been adequately addressed in earlier debates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The definition of a \"family\" embraced by the National Council for Problem Gambling is a very broad one.&nbsp;I quote from the Council&rsquo;s website, \"Exclusion is available to immediate family members defined as spouses, children, parents and siblings, including adopted and step relations.\" In addition, minors below 21 years of age or are incapacitated due to physical or mental impairment could apply for the Family Exclusion with an extended family member or a Minister-appointed person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be indicted as a problem gambler through the Family Exclusion Order is a serious charge, and a socially humiliating experience. I am particularly concerned with frivolous or wilful charges initiated by individuals who are seeking means to harm or curtail civil liberties of family members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister if there are processes and safeguards in place to protect innocent members of the community in such instances. For example, will the named individual be spared from emotional distress when a Family Exclusion Order is initiated but not yet verified? Will there be punitive measures taken against those who initiate wilful charges to prevent abuse and misuse of the Family Exclusion Order?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike Mr&nbsp;de Souza, I was very surprised to learn that there were so many&nbsp;enquiries received by the NCPG. As of June 2009, the <I>Business Times</I> reported that there were 78 enquiries. This is just a \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1517<p>\r\nlittle less than half the number of enquiries received in South Australia over a four-year period.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Inevitably, regardless of the outcome, invoking a Family Exclusion Order will result in animosity and ill-will between family members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the Parents Maintenance Act, once the law is invoked to manage family ties and relationships, the family loses its distinctive altruistic nature and the social ties between affected members are irrevocably damaged.&nbsp; In short,&nbsp;the family&nbsp;will cease to function as a family where social obligations are driven by notions of love and compassion.&nbsp; Instead, the exchanges will be policed by the law, and will very likely cease to exist once the whip is lifted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to seek an insight into how the NCPG manages the potential fallout between family members when this Exclusionary Order is invoked.&nbsp; I understand from published reports that there are at least two individuals who are likely to be barred from entering the casinos here because of the application for a Family Exclusion Order initiated by their spouses.&nbsp; Was the NCPG successful in reinstating a functional spousal relationship in these initial cases?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we strive to plug the gaps through a comprehensive legislative Bill, we must be cognisant that we have yet to address a fundamental concern regarding the establishment of the two Integrated Resorts in Singapore&nbsp;&ndash; and that is the glamorisation and normalisation of casino gambling (which, in turn, may inevitably normalise other forms of gambling).&nbsp; In particular, we must be vigilant of the potential draw the Casinos in the IRs will have on our youths.&nbsp; In this regard, the NCPG must step up its education \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1518<p>\r\ninitiatives to be targeted at young Singaporeans who are testing boundaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Like many other Singaporeans, I was very concerned with the introduction of the Integrated Resorts (IRs)&nbsp;and, of course, followed the debates on the Casino Control Bill from the&nbsp;start.&nbsp; I would like to seek a few clarifications from the Ministry on the section of the Bill with regard to persons to be excluded from the casinos and also to raise some related concerns on problem gambling which other Members of the House have also spoken on today.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I understand it, the spirit of the proposed amendment to section 165 of the principal Act is to offer more protection to those persons and their families who are most at risk from losing everything they have through uncontrolled gambling.&nbsp; While there was provision in the original Act for a person with poor credit record to make a voluntary application for exclusion, the new amendments take away this option for those who are on Public Assistance or are undischarged bankrupts.&nbsp; There will now be automatic exclusion for these persons.&nbsp; In fact, I understand that this is already the practice with the third-party exclusion order and it has also been stated in a brochure I saw on casino exclusion published by the National Council on Problem Gambling.&nbsp; I have to say this definitely offers more protection to a particular group of persons who might be most at risk, particularly to the children and elderly parents who might rely on their children for support and these would be the more vulnerable groups.&nbsp; This might well be the reason for the amendment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1519<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, like my fellow Member, Assoc. Prof. Paulin Tay Straughan, I am concerned about whether automatic exclusion or some of the exclusion orders would erode the sense of responsibility of the individual by taking away the powers of self-determination.&nbsp; If individuals are not allowed to determine for themselves what is good for their families and to make the right judgments and decisions, take responsibility for their own families, it might reinforce the attitude of dependency on the State.&nbsp; And automatic exclusion I feel could&nbsp;perhaps&nbsp;reinforce an attitude of dependency on the State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must encourage people to take responsibility for their lives.&nbsp; I am sure we would all like Singaporeans to be much more self-reliant and resilient.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, it is irresponsible for someone on Public Assistance or someone who is an undischarged bankrupt especially to use Public Assistance funds to gamble or to use it to pay the $100 admission charge to the casinos.&nbsp; However, automatic exclusion may not actually stop persons with poor credit records from potentially developing gambling problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone can still get their fix from other forms of gambling they are permitted&nbsp;&ndash; 4D, football betting&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;or even take that bus ride up to Genting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In drawing up the amendment, I am sure the Ministry was thinking of protecting those at risk and it is indeed not easy to strike an exact balance between regulation and protection of the more vulnerable members of society.&nbsp; At the same time, with automatic exclusion, it could also stigmatise those who, for whatever reason, are on Public Assistance.&nbsp; I would urge that exclusion orders, when they are implemented, to be done with due consideration of their impact on the individual on their sense of responsibility to their families as well as the impact on their family relationships \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1520<p>\r\nand also to ensure that these individuals have the chance to improve their financial circumstances.&nbsp; I hope the Minister will further explicate the reasons for automatic exclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to ask&nbsp;for more explanation on how automatic exclusion will be implemented.&nbsp; Does it mean there will be much more inter-agency cooperation because different agencies handle casino regulation, Public Assistance and bankruptcy?&nbsp; Would MCYS and the Public Trustees Office share information and automatically and regularly update the Council on the names and particulars of persons on Public Assistance and undischarged bankrupts, including automatically informing the Council when a bankrupt has been discharged?&nbsp; Will there be a time lag between the discharge of&nbsp;a bankrupt and the revocation of an exclusion order by the Council?&nbsp; And is there still provision for someone who may wish to object to his exclusion as provided for in the existing Chapter 165 of the Act or will this no longer apply once automatic exclusion kicks in?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not in opposition to the spirit of the law with regard to protecting those most at risk.&nbsp; We are all aware of the destructive and painful effects of problem&nbsp;gambling on families and individuals.&nbsp; Singapore is entering into new territory with the IRs and our regulatory mechanisms will be tested as the IRs start to operate and these would include the laws on exclusion orders.&nbsp; Perhaps, we should have a period of careful study once the casinos are in operation to monitor the efficacy of the legislation as well as the regulatory mechanisms, including those mechanisms that are managed by the casinos themselves, and not be afraid to make further amendments in the future, if necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please allow me now to turn to another issue of concern&nbsp;&ndash; the regulations and restrictions on public advertising of \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1521<p>\r\nthe casinos.&nbsp; When the Integrated Resorts open, we can expect a lot of fanfare, glitz, media coverage and advertising.&nbsp; It will be premature to presume that increased media coverage and advertising will encourage Singaporeans to gamble more.&nbsp; But we should be careful not to discount the impact of aggressive advertising on human behaviour, particularly if casino-related activities are portrayed as glamorous lifestyle and entertainment options.&nbsp; There are already regulations against advertising on gambling in Singapore and I understand there will be restrictions on advertising of the casinos in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to seek further clarifications on specific regulations regarding advertising of the IRs and casino activity.&nbsp; Will casino operators be subject to a certain advertising code of practice?&nbsp; For instance, would advertising depicting gambling-related activities or any aspect of the IRs which relates to gambling&nbsp;be allowed at bus-stops near schools?&nbsp; We already have some regulations on certain activities such as the screening and advertising of R(A) movies in Singapore, with the rationale being to protect the innocence of the young.&nbsp;&nbsp;Will we have more specific regulations to protect the vulnerable with regard to IR advertising and how will this be implemented and enforced?&nbsp; In some of the Australian states, restrictions on advertising and promotion of gambling and casinos are written into legislation.&nbsp; In the Australian Capital Territory's Gambling Industry Code of Practice, there is also a stipulation that information about gambling counselling services must be made available in conjunction with advertising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it stands, it appears that gambling might be on its way to becoming more socially acceptable.&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo had earlier cited certain surveys to show that the number of gamblers has increased.&nbsp; I find it interesting also to read in the survey on participation and \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1522<p>\r\ngambling activities among Singapore residents in 2008 which was published by the National Council on Problem Gambling, that compared to the findings in&nbsp;2005, the proportion of respondents in 2008 who considered 4D, Toto, Singapore Sweep and social gambling as leisure activities actually increased and \"increased substantially\", in the survey's own words.&nbsp; I believe around 50% of respondents considered these forms of gambling to be leisure activities.&nbsp; Other Members of the House have spoken on these disturbing trends as well.&nbsp; I am aware that MCYS and National Council on Problem Gambling are seriously addressing these issues and that they have already made a headstart on them.&nbsp; I hope that the relevant Ministries will continue to monitor and review the measures on gambling-related activities and to propose new legislation as the need arises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will also like to lend my voice to support my fellow Member, Mr Christopher de Souza's call for the Casino Regulatory Authority to work more closely with NCPG and the Ministry of Home Affairs to track the social impact of the activities of casinos on Singapore as a whole, for instance, to track the trends or any rise in illegal activities or negative activities in society at large such as money laundering, loansharking and vice activities.&nbsp; In last month's parliamentary session, there seemed to be&nbsp;a lot of concern about the visibility of illegal moneylenders and how they harass residents in HDB estates.&nbsp; These clearly are concerns for many Singaporeans and I hope that we continue to monitor and track how we regulate the casinos in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Calvin Cheng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.13 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Calvin Cheng:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1523<p>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I only have two comments, specifically on section 165(A) \"Persons to be excluded from Casino\".&nbsp; I applaud the move to automatically exclude certain categories of persons from casinos, persons manifestly unsuited from going near any gambling place.&nbsp; I hope that the Minister can consider another category of such persons, namely, persons who have committed offences under the Common Gaming Houses Act, the Betting Act, and the Private Lotteries Act.&nbsp; The reason why I think these people should also be automatically excluded is&nbsp;that they have committed crimes related to gambling and a casino is a place for that very specific purpose. &nbsp;Some of these people may have retained links to gambling syndicates, and may be more likely to offend, if given access to&nbsp;casinos and the many gamblers in these casinos. &nbsp;For example, a recalcitrant illegal bookmaker may find a casino fertile recruiting ground for gamblers interested in his illegal activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may think this suggestion to exclude such a category of persons too harsh. May I also suggest the following: that the automatic exclusion stands for a period of time after their conviction, for first time offenders convicted under the above acts, after which the exclusion is lifted. &nbsp;Repeat offenders under the same abovementioned acts could be excluded for longer periods of time, with recalcitrant offenders excluded permanently, subject to periodic reviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) in the Chair]</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will address the issues raised by Members with respect to the casino exclusion orders and the social safeguards.&nbsp; This is probably the second or third time I am participating in a debate on the casinos, and the casinos have not even&nbsp;opened.&nbsp; It shows that this is not the first and will probably not be the last time that we will have to calibrate and adjust our regulatory and operational postures with respect to casinos.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me, first, reassure Mdm Ho Geok Choo, Mr Christopher de Souza and Ms Audrey Wong that we will establish a set of social safeguards which are, in fact, more stringent than that in many other jurisdictions.&nbsp; Apart from the common safeguards, such as the minimum age of 21 and the process of self-exclusion, we also have safeguards which are uncommon or uniquely Singaporean&nbsp;&ndash; for instance, the casino entry levy, the prohibition of casino advertising in the local mass media, as well as Family and Third-Party Exclusions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Christopher de Souza will be pleased to note that section 129(1) of the Casino Control Act requires the casino operators to take all appropriate steps to ensure that undesirable activities, such as prostitution and illegal money lending, do not take place within their premises. &nbsp;The Police and the Casino Regulatory Authority will work closely with the casino operators to ensure that their\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1525<p>\r\ncasinos are free from such undesirable activities.&nbsp; Any casino operator who contravenes section 129(1) of the Casino Control Act shall be liable to disciplinary action, which is spelt out in section 54 of the Act.&nbsp; In addition, should loansharking, money laundering and syndicated vice activities be detected&nbsp;in the casinos, the Police will not hesitate to prosecute the offenders.&nbsp; Outside of the casinos, there will also be existing laws and processes to guard against such undesirable activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Casino Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s core duty, therefore, remains the regulation of the casinos.&nbsp; However, having said that, I agree with Mr Christopher de Souza that the Casino Regulatory Authority, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) and MCYS will clearly have to work&nbsp;together and collaborate in order to monitor and to address the overall social impact of casino gambling. &nbsp;In fact, these various agencies&nbsp;have already begun to work very closely together and they do meet very regularly at staff level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Calvin Cheng has also suggested that persons who have committed offences under the Common Gaming Houses Act, the Betting Act and the Private Lotteries Act, and I presume he also means loansharks,&nbsp;should be excluded from the casinos as they may have links with gambling syndicates.&nbsp; I think this is an interesting suggestion which we will consider.&nbsp; Nevertheless, let me reassure him that the Police and the Casino Regulatory Authority will work closely with the casino operators to make sure that our casinos are free from such undesirable activities and individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will assess and monitor the effectiveness of the social safeguards after the casinos are open, and as I have said earlier, if we need to tighten, we will do so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1526<p>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now move on to Family Exclusions.&nbsp; Family Exclusions enable a family to exclude a particular family member with a serious gambling problem from entering the casinos.&nbsp; A Committee of Assessors will be appointed by the NCPG which will sit to hear and to review each case before making a Family Exclusion Order.&nbsp; An Order&nbsp;will only be&nbsp;issued&nbsp;if there is reasonable apprehension that the respondent may cause serious harm to his family members because of his or her gambling.&nbsp; The making of the Order has to be appropriate in the circumstances, and the respondent has to be given&nbsp;an opportunity to object to the application, and the Committee&nbsp;must be&nbsp;satisfied that it would be in the best interests of both the respondent and his family members to make&nbsp;such an&nbsp;Order.&nbsp; So there will be safeguards in the process by which such Orders are executed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A respondent&nbsp;will be&nbsp;regarded to have caused serious harm to his family if, for instance,&nbsp;because of his gambling habit he has previously engaged in gambling activities irresponsibly,&nbsp;has done so repeatedly over a period of not less than&nbsp;three months or in a particularly irresponsible manner over a lesser period.&nbsp; It is difficult to spell out in fine detail, but these will be judgments which we will have to leave to the Committee of Assessors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Paulin Tay Straughan has asked about measures to prevent abuse of the Family Exclusion Order.&nbsp; All members of the Council and anybody sitting in the&nbsp;Committee of Assessors will be deemed&nbsp;to be&nbsp;public servants under section 193 of the Casino Control Act. &nbsp;Hence, a false declaration made to the Council or&nbsp; Committee is an offence under section 182 of the Penal Code.&nbsp; Such an offence draws a punishment of imprisonment for a term up to one year, or a fine which may extend to $5,000, or both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1527<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to assure&nbsp;Prof. Straughan that the procedures that the NCPG has put in place for the Family Exclusion aim to help the family and the person with&nbsp;a gambling problem.&nbsp; The first point of contact for a family member who wishes to make an application for an Order will, in fact, be with a social worker.&nbsp; The social worker will help to stabilise the family, while taking a non-adversarial stance with the member with&nbsp;a gambling problem. Both the problem gambler and the family members&nbsp;will be&nbsp;invited to attend interviews, offered counselling and necessary&nbsp;support by the social worker.&nbsp; So it is meant to be a supportive and non-adversarial interaction in the first instance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NCPG has also consulted extensively on the composition of the Committee of Assessors.&nbsp; It will be chaired by a NCPG member and, thus far, the Council has asked two of its members, who are retired High Court judges, to chair these Committees.&nbsp; The other members of the Committee&nbsp;will be&nbsp;drawn from&nbsp;professions such as social workers and counsellors as well as grassroots leaders, Justices of the Peace and school principals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Family Exclusion empowers a family that is adversely affected by a problem gambler to seek assistance in curbing the problem behaviour of the gambler.&nbsp; As at 31st August 2009, seven&nbsp;Family Exclusion Orders have been issued.&nbsp; Of these seven cases,&nbsp;three cases have opted to continue with counselling on a voluntary basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amongst the seven cases,&nbsp;two were made by wives against their husbands,&nbsp;three were made by parents against their sons, and&nbsp;two were made by sisters against their brothers.&nbsp; For both cases made by wives, the husbands were supportive and agreed to the Order.&nbsp; Of the&nbsp;three cases that were&nbsp;requested by\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1528<p>\r\nparents, there was no indication of a strained relationship with their sons.&nbsp; In fact, they had earlier bailed their&nbsp;sons out of their debts and the children were remorseful and understood their parents' reason for making such an application.&nbsp; Of the&nbsp;two applications&nbsp;made by sisters, the brothers were also supportive and understood the reasons why the sisters made these two&nbsp;applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the NCPG handles more cases in the future, I am sure there&nbsp;will be&nbsp;more difficult, more complex and more adversarial cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;But with a social work approach to these cases, we believe that&nbsp;we will try, to the maximum extent possible, to avoid an adversarial outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Christopher de Souza expressed concern that the Family Exclusion may not have much impact.&nbsp; I think time will tell.&nbsp; We should look at things in totality and remember that this is just one part of a total package of social safeguards that we have put&nbsp;in place after carefully studying the experiences and lessons of other jurisdictions.&nbsp; And, as I have said earlier,&nbsp;we are prepared to tweak these measures, if need be, in order&nbsp;to suit our own unique context and circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Third-Party Exclusion, undischarged bankrupts and recipients of Public Assistance and Special Grants from the Government will be excluded from the casinos.&nbsp;&nbsp;We estimate that there are about&nbsp;29,000 people who will be excluded under this scheme.&nbsp; I would like to inform Ms Audrey Wong that there has, in fact,&nbsp;been no change in policy.&nbsp; This is something which I had previously stated during the earlier&nbsp;parliamentary debate in 2005. The objective of the Third-Party Exclusion is to protect persons who are already in severe financial hardship and&nbsp;can ill afford to gamble, from getting into further debt.&nbsp; The proposed amendments simplify the legal process.&nbsp; For this group of persons, there is no need for any \"judgment\" or discretion to be exercised \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1529<p>\r\nby the Committee of Assessors since the exclusion criteria are clear cut.&nbsp; For the same reason, the opportunity to object and appeal against casino exclusion has also been removed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Calvin Cheng would be pleased to know that dependants of those receiving Public Assistance and Special Grants will be automatically excluded from the casinos.&nbsp; The dependants of undischarged bankrupts would not, however,&nbsp;be automatically excluded, as it may not always be the case that these dependants are financially vulnerable.&nbsp; For dependants of undischarged bankrupts, I would suggest that they consider voluntary Self-Exclusion and the NCPG&nbsp;can work with the families who come forward for such help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I share&nbsp;Prof. Straughan&rsquo;s concern for persons who are receiving assistance from other charities, but I am not willing to automatically exclude them.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that they consider voluntary Self-Exclusion. And perhaps the benefactors can consider making this a pre-condition&nbsp;before offering assistance.&nbsp; But the NCPG will explore&nbsp;her idea further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NCPG will also accept applications to exclude persons with a poor credit record.&nbsp; On this point, I must say that it has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; It will&nbsp;take into account the total debts, the unpaid bills&nbsp;the person has accumulated, his earning capacity, overall financial circumstances, emotional stability and family support.&nbsp; These are cases which we cannot&nbsp;hard-wire and hard-code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Ms Audrey Wong that it is not easy to balance between over-regulation and protection of the more vulnerable members of our society.&nbsp; On this issue, I am inclined to agree with Mdm Ho Geok Choo that those in financial hardship should not be gambling at the casinos.&nbsp; And I am sure Ms Audrey Wong \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1530<p>\r\nwill also agree that we do want to send&nbsp;a strong message that gambling is not for those who cannot afford to do so.&nbsp; It is not a means to make a living.&nbsp; It is not a means&nbsp;to salvage an already compromised financial situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Audrey Wong asked about the process of implementing the Exclusions.&nbsp; Yes, there will certainly be inter-agency link-up.&nbsp; The NCPG will obtain, on a regular basis, an updated list of undischarged bankrupts and Public Assistance and Special Grant recipients from the Insolvency and Public Trustee&rsquo;s Office and from my Ministry&rsquo;s ComCare database respectively.&nbsp; This list will be sent to the Casino Regulatory Authority, the Police and the casino operators.&nbsp; The NCPG is currently finalising the process for Third-Party Exclusions and Ms&nbsp;Wong and Mdm Ho&nbsp;can be assured that we will make&nbsp;the process as speedy and efficient as possible.&nbsp; That is also the reason why we have to amend the legislation to enable us to transmit this information in a soft copy form, to ensure that the information is accurate and updated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo also asked about the checks conducted to ensure that excluded persons do not enter the casinos.&nbsp; Under the law, section 126 of the Casino Control Act states that the onus is on the casino operator not to allow an excluded person into the casinos. The Casino Regulatory Authority and my Ministry will hold the operators&nbsp;to this duty.&nbsp; As to whether the stringent checks to detect excluded persons will deter tourists, I think the operators&nbsp;will have to exercise some ingenuity in order to create an&nbsp;effective&nbsp;semi-permeable membrane.&nbsp; In other words, for <I>bona fide</I> tourists, they should be able to get through easily.&nbsp; For those who are excluded, they should find it virtually impossible to get through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as advertising is concerned, I am pleased to inform Ms Audrey Wong that my Ministry will be working closely \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1531<p>\r\nwith the Casino Regulatory Authority to promulgate the casino advertising regulations.&nbsp; Regulations&nbsp;on casino advertising to our local population are a key social safeguard, as we do not want to promote&nbsp;or normalise gambling. The regulations will be in line with the advertising restrictions that the integrated resort&nbsp;operators agreed to when we first conducted a Request for Proposal for the integrated resorts,</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>and they agreed, at that point in time, that there would be no advertising to the local population. These restrictions include prohibitions on advertising in free-to-air and cable TV, radio, newspapers, and outdoor advertising, such as at bus stops and on public buses. The advertising regulations will only permit casino advertising within Changi Airport, the Singapore Visitor Centres, and tourist attractions. Even then, the information disseminated on the casinos should be factual and not promotional in nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me&nbsp;finally turn&nbsp;to youth gambling, which is a concern that I share with many Members of this House. That is one of the&nbsp;reasons why we chose a minimum age&nbsp;of 21 years for entering the casinos, rather than 18 years, in contrast to other forms of gambling. We recognise that casino gambling is&nbsp;potentially more addictive and more dangerous, especially to young people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NCPG has&nbsp;identified youths as a key target group.&nbsp; It has conducted consultations with students from schools and tertiary institutions, as well as with youths-at-risk, in order to find out their motivations for gambling. NCPG and its partners have also developed youth programmes to reach out to students.&nbsp;A recent example is the \"Play It Right\" youth outreach initiative by the Singapore Management University's Recreational Gaming Club, which was supported by the NCPG to reach out to students in our\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1532<p>\r\nlocal universities, in order&nbsp;to raise awareness of problem gambling, to allow people to identify early signs of problem gambling and also to know the community resources which are available.&nbsp;This is an excellent example of empowered youths&nbsp;reaching out to other youths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of NCPG's capability-building efforts, it recently organised a Train-the-Trainers Workshop in August this year to train social work practitioners, youth workers and psychologists to deal with young people. This workshop was conducted by Dr Jeffrey Derevensky, who is a world-renowned expert in youth gambling, prevention and treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, we will continue to work with schools, tertiary institutions and our other community partners to expand our outreach and our public education efforts, as well as to focus our efforts in capacity- and capability-building, especially when it comes to young people, who are the most vulnerable members of our population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me end by urging all Members to&nbsp;support these amendments, as we&nbsp;walk this fine line between&nbsp;ensuring that, for the majority of our people, they would be given sufficient freedom and latitude to exercise responsibility, whilst for the minority who are most vulnerable, we do our best to protect them, sometimes even from their own bad judgments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be prepared to take clarifications, Mr Deputy Speaker, before Mrs Lim Hwee Hua rounds up the debate.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Deputy Speaker:</B> Any clarifications?&nbsp; Mr de Souza.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Christopher de Souza:</B> Sir, I thank Minister, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, for&nbsp;his considered reply. The Minister&nbsp; mentioned section 129. &nbsp;I am aware of that section. &nbsp;I think section 129, sub-section (2) refers to going after casino operators&nbsp;&ndash; if they\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1533<p>\r\nfail to carry out reasonable checks to prevent a series of crimes happening in the casino. So that is, again, casino-centric. That is a focus within the casino.

Again, my point is different from that.&nbsp; I am asking whether the Minister would consider that CRA be empowered, after collecting the data and looking at the information, to tweak and regulate upstream, the casino to ensure that the trickle-down negative social implications do&nbsp;not happen.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, I share Mr Christopher de Souza's motivation. But it is a question of how we achieve this objective.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have handled this casino issue&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;in my stints at the Ministry of Trade and Industry,&nbsp;MICA,&nbsp;MCYS and even partly when I was in MND. The lesson&nbsp;I have learnt&nbsp;is that in dealing with this complex issue we,&nbsp;in fact, need a network approach and we need multiple agencies to&nbsp;all do what they are best at, but to share information, coordinate and collaborate. I may be misreading your speech but the gist of your speech was that we should empower and even put a duty on the Casino Regulatory Authority to do all these things. That means, apart from regulating the casinos itself, it should also concern itself with all the upstream, downstream and side-stream issues related to the many social ills which could arise from casino gambling.

My colleague, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan has explained in detail&nbsp;the non-tax concerns as well as addressed the suggestions&nbsp;raised by the Members. So let me now address the specific tax-related queries&nbsp;raised by Mdm Ho Geok Choo and Ms Sylvia Lim in turn.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo has raised queries on three aspects of the provisions concerning the administration of the casino tax. The first is on how IRAS will keep track of the profits which the casino operators would accrue from&nbsp;the different types of gaming activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The casino operators are to comply with the set of internal controls requirements issued by the Casino Regulatory Authority for key processes within the casino. The internal controls specified include how the revenue is to be collected, counted and reconciled for every casino game. For example, the wagering activities at the slot machines will be tracked by the machines' meters and these are linked to a slot management system. This system can, in turn, generate reports on the breakdown of gaming activities like the amount of payouts and casino profits on a daily basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casino operators are also subjected to scrutiny by internal and external auditors, at least once a year. The audit findings relating to the computation of casino tax will then be sent to IRAS for review. And IRAS, in addition, will conduct its own audits and follow-ups with the casino operators on any irregularities discovered in the audits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1536<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho also raised the point on the penalties for tax evasion.&nbsp; She asked if these are sufficient. If there is a wilful intent to evade casino tax, as we are told earlier on, the operator will be liable to a penalty of four times the amount of the tax underpaid. We also note that this provision is in line with similar provisions in the other tax acts such as the Income Tax Act and the Betting and Sweepstake Duties Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho raised a question&nbsp;revolving around the phrase, \"any person of the proposed section 149A.\" She is concerned that IRAS will impose on individuals&nbsp;a fine, or jail term for making incorrect returns or giving incorrect tax-related information, regardless of whether the action was intentional. Let me&nbsp;clarify that this provision is not intended to target individuals. And that the phrase, \"any person\" means any legal person. It is primarily targeted at the casino operators. We have used the phrase, \"any person\" to give the authorities sufficient flexibility to act&nbsp;against individuals such as errant employees and tax agents who collaborate with the casino operators to commit a crime. And I should also add that this is a legal term that is aligned with all the other tax acts such as the Income Tax Act. Ultimately, we should take note that the casino operators are responsible for filing casino tax returns accurately. And that filing an incorrect tax return under this provision is an offence by itself, regardless of whether there is an intention to evade tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me, now, move on to the comments raised by Ms Sylvia Lim. Ms Lim has asked under what scenarios the Minister will remit casino tax as provided for under section 148A of the Act.&nbsp; Let me&nbsp;clarify that section 148A is aligned with similar provisions in the other tax acts such as sections 89(I) and 92(II) of the Goods and Services Tax and Income Tax Act respectively. And these sections are exercised under only very special and\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1537<p>\r\nexceptional circumstances such as poverty or equity reasons. While we do not anticipate usage of these sections, we, nonetheless, propose the addition of these sections to give the Minister the flexibility to remit casino tax, if he assesses that a remission is just and equitable. Let me also confirm that this does not include a consideration on the viability of the IRs as raised by the Member.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Lim has also asked why the proposed section 146B(V) that gives the Comptroller powers to assess tax due and section 149A that governs penalties for incorrect tax returns are not similar to the provisions in the Income Tax Act. Let me just clarify that in the review of the Casino Control Act, references were made to the other tax acts, in addition to the Income Tax Act. So it is not just the Income Tax Act. And for this particular provision, section 146B(V), the more relevant act is actually the Goods and Services Tax Act, which is under a self-assessment system, as opposed to the Income Tax Act which is under an official assessment system. So section 146B(V) was modelled after section 45(VII) of the GST Act to address a similar scenario where the tax payer fails to make a tax return. And the higher casino tax assessment provided for here, acts as a deterrent to encourage the timely filing of returns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And finally on section 149A, let me clarify that income tax filing involves individuals and business entities and the distinction as outlined by the Member is relevant. This is because an offence under section 149A which relates to incorrect \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1538<p>\r\nfiling is assessed to be a lesser charge,</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2008, 14 young persons below the age of 21 committed suicide.&nbsp; There were 19 and 15 in 2007 and 2006 respectively.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each suicide represents a tragedy for the family and loved ones involved. Each case is unique, and we should not simplistically over-generalise the causes that lead to suicide. The medical literature indicates that multiple factors, including depression, desperation, emotional instability, anxiety or inability to deal with stress may all play a role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main lesson for us is that a person who is resilient and well supported by family and friends will be better able to cope with the many challenges of life. Early detection and professional advice will also be useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the complexity of the problem, the Government adopts a multi-pronged strategy and a many helping hands approach to prevent suicide.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, we aim to build greater resiliency in young people.&nbsp; Our schools provide opportunities for students acquire social-emotional skills to enable them to cope with life's challenges.&nbsp; This enhances their resilience.&nbsp; An example is the \"Mind Your Mind\" programme launched by the Health Promotion Board in collaboration with the Ministry of Education.&nbsp; The programme targets primary and secondary school students and covers topics such as stress and anger management, building positive self-esteem and recognising depression.&nbsp; Resiliency and character building are also elements that are built into many of my Ministry&rsquo;s programmes and services targeting young people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we work with community partners and supporting ecosystems on preventive measures to reduce suicidal tendencies. Families play a crucial role as the first source of care and emotional support for the young.&nbsp; MCYS strives to build strong and stable families through our various initiatives such as our series of family life education programmes.&nbsp; In schools, teachers, school counsellors, and guidance specialists are also trained to actively identify and support students in distress.&nbsp; Support services are also available at the Family Service Centres and most social service agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On top of this, the Samaritans of Singapore runs a 24-hour crisis hotline to counsel anyone in distress, including those with suicidal tendencies.&nbsp; Past record suggested that young people contemplating suicides do indeed make use of this hotline to seek help in addressing their concerns and suicidal thoughts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1541<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the Government engages health workers and social service professionals to identify and help high risk individuals such as youth in crisis.&nbsp; Treatment programmes available in our healthcare institutions include the Child Guidance Clinic under the Institute of Mental Health.&nbsp; The Institute of Mental Health also works with general practitioners in the community to provide the first line of treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, research has consistently shown that early identification of warning signs of suicidal thoughts is an important factor in preventing suicides.&nbsp; One important approach is therefore to increase public awareness of mental health issues and to promote mental wellbeing.&nbsp; The annual Suicide Prevention Week by the Samaritans of Singapore, for example, helps to increase public&rsquo;s understanding of suicidal thoughts and the available avenues for help.&nbsp; Through talks and workshops, members of the public are equipped with information on where one could seek help, and how to identify early warning signs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst on this subject of public awareness, I would also like to make a plea for the mass media not to over-sensationalise cases of suicide. We do not want to cause even more pain to the remaining family members, and certainly do not want to promote copy cat suicides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must all do our part to identify, reach out and enable vulnerable persons to access the support services available. We also need to be especially supportive&nbsp;of the families whose lives have been torn apart by the impact of a suicide.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Column: 1541</p>\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:CONSENSUAL SEX AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:CONSENSUAL SEX AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE:::1544-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>CONSENSUAL SEX AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE</P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mdm Cynthia Phua </B>asked the Minister for Education with the rise in the number of young people indulging in consensual sex (a) what is the Ministry doing to address this problem; (b) whether the Ministry has conducted any studies to find out why this trend is increasing; and (c) whether the Ministry will review its sex education programme to increase its effectiveness.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address this trend, MOE provides sexuality education in schools to complement the primary role that parents play in this area of their children&rsquo;s behaviour and development.&nbsp; Age appropriate sexuality education is delivered through the formal curriculum on Health Education, Civic and Moral Education and Science as well as through the co-curricular programme \"Growing Years\", which seeks to equip students with the essential knowledge and skills to form healthy relationships with the opposite sex, while making responsible, values-based decisions on matters of sexuality. It advocates abstinence as the best option for teens and helps them to understand the risks and consequences of pre-marital sex. Teenagers are also educated about Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), including HIV, and protection against these diseases from a health perspective, through the Health Promotion Board&rsquo;s (HPB) programme, \"Breaking Down Barriers\".&nbsp; Students, who are likely to be sexually active, are given one-on-one counselling sessions by their Full Time School Counsellors or referred to other health services with parental consent.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As parents are a child&rsquo;s first educators, MOE has been working with HPB and MCYS to better equip parents to play their role through a programme called \"Love Them. Talk About \r\n<p align=left>Column: 1543<p>\r\nSex\".

LTA requires all vehicles to be sent for periodic inspections to ensure that they are roadworthy, and that they have not been illegally modified. Owners of vehicles that fail the inspection would be required to rectify the fault.&nbsp; LTA also conducts regular enforcement checks on the roads and carries out blitzes island-wide to detect such modified vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last two years, no workshops have been prosecuted for being involved in illegal engine modifications.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P>\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>\r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES-->\r\n<P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t<div align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n\t\t\r\n        \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t<div align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n\t\t\r\n        \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t<div align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n\t\t\r\n        \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
