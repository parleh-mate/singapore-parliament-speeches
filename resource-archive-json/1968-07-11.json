I quote Hansard, Volume 27, No. 4,  column\r\n\r\n220, line 15:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In order to utilise fully the facilities in the\r\n\r\n10  creches,  a number of vacant places  in  these\r\n\r\ncreches  will  be offered to children  of  working\r\n\r\nparents  in  the higher income groups. But  unlike\r\n\r\nthose  from families with incomes below  5500  per\r\n\r\nmonth  who  will  continue to  enjoy  the  heavily\r\n\r\nsubsidized  creche facilities, children  from  the\r\n\r\nhigher  income  families  will  have  to  pay   an\r\n\r\neconomic admission charge.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of this new policy were announced by\r\n\r\nme  on 6th July, 1968, at the fifth Annual Parents\r\n\r\nDay for children\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncentres  and  creches held at  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nConference   Hall.

The maximum\r\n\r\nnumber  of  children  for any  one  family  to  be\r\n\r\nadmitted  is  four.  Priority in  admission  will,\r\n\r\nhowever, be given to children in the lowest income\r\n\r\ngroup and orphans whose guardians can satisfy  the\r\n\r\ncitizenship requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child whose parents are in receipt of public\r\n\r\nassistance  allowance will  be  admitted  free  of\r\n\r\ncharge.

I  said yesterday that  a  person  who\r\n\r\nretires  at  the  age  of  55  will  have  certain\r\n\r\ndisadvantages. I said there are some workers  who,\r\n\r\non  reaching  55 years of age, are  preparing  for\r\n\r\ntheir  death.  But,  there  are  others  who,   on\r\n\r\nreaching  this  age, are still very energetic  and\r\n\r\nfull of spirit and vitality, in addition to having\r\n\r\nmuch  precious experience gained from their  work.\r\n\r\nAt  55,  they are beginning to launch  into  their\r\n\r\nambitious  enterprises. Such people  constitute  a\r\n\r\ngood number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the advanced countries, Britain\r\n\r\nand  America,  for some examples of these  people.\r\n\r\nThey  normally reach the height of success at  the\r\n\r\nages  of 70 to 80. This is a very good example  to\r\n\r\nshow that the retiring age for a worker should not\r\n\r\nbe 55 years of age and there should not be any law\r\n\r\nto  retire  a worker when he reaches 55  years  of\r\n\r\nage.  I  would say that the basis for assessing  a\r\n\r\nperson's retiring age should be his performance in\r\n\r\nthe work. It should not be based on age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is the standardisation of the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  hours of work per week. I should  have\r\n\r\nsupported  this provision, but I have  reasons  to\r\n\r\nhope  that the Minister for Labour should be aware\r\n\r\nthat  as a result of the increase of working hours\r\n\r\nper week, there is a risk that employers will make\r\n\r\nuse  of  this  provision as a pretext to  retrench\r\n\r\ntheir workers. I therefore hope the Minister  will\r\n\r\ncaution the employers not to take such action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I wind up, I would like to say positively\r\n\r\nthat  this  Bill,  of course,  is  meant  for  the\r\n\r\neconomic  stability of our country  hereafter  and\r\n\r\nfor  its  consolidation and continued  prosperity.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  all  industries,  whether  pioneer  or\r\n\r\nalready     established,    and    all    business\r\n\r\nestablishments should increase their productivity.\r\n\r\nThis  will also ensure that the 50,000 odd workers\r\n\r\nwho  will  be  left unemployed after  the  British\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  will have re-employment opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis  is  also thinking in terms of the employment\r\n\r\nopportunities  for our thousands of  young  people\r\n\r\nwho will be entering the labour market every year.\r\n\r\nOn these two matters - increasing productivity and\r\n\r\nproviding employment opportunities - the first  is\r\n\r\nan old problem, but the second is a new challenge.\r\n\r\nWhen  there  is a new problem, we must  adopt  new\r\n\r\nmethods to meet it. There must be a new resolve to\r\n\r\nmeet  new problems. It is not surprising  that  we\r\n\r\nshould   encourage  our  people   to   work   more\r\n\r\ndiligently.  When  I began to speak  on  the  Bill\r\n\r\nyesterday,  I already said that there was  nothing\r\n\r\nto   cavil  about  it.  But  because  of  the  few\r\n\r\nshortcomings which I have enumerated above - they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  like bristle-tails and maggots which will eat\r\n\r\naway the whole body of the Bill - it is hoped  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour will accept the constructive\r\n\r\npropositions   of  the  Back-benchers.   We   have\r\n\r\nconsulted the views of the electorate and we  hope\r\n\r\nthe Minister will deliberate on the Bill and amend\r\n\r\nit accordingly so as to make it perfect. It should\r\n\r\nbe  like  a bright light lighting up the  path  to\r\n\r\neconomic progress and national survival. It should\r\n\r\nnot  turn  the  relationship which now  exists  so\r\n\r\nharmoniously  between  labour  and  capital  into,\r\n\r\nfiguratively speaking, a volcano erupting on  Bali\r\n\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.17 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise  to lend my support  to  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading  of  the  Bill moved by the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour.  If  it is passed by this House,  it  will\r\n\r\nreplace the existing three Ordinances, namely, the\r\n\r\nLabour  Ordinance,  1955,  the  Clerks  Employment\r\n\r\nOrdinance,   1957,   and   the   Shop   Assistants\r\n\r\nEmployment Ordinance, 1957. The new Bill  embodies\r\n\r\nmost  of  the  provisions in the three  Ordinances\r\n\r\nmentioned above, and introduces some new ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new Bill is intended to rationalise and\r\n\r\nregularise  the working conditions of both  white-collar  and blue-collar workers, whether they  are\r\n\r\nemployed  in  commercial  and  trading  firms   or\r\n\r\nindustrial  establishments in the  new  industrial\r\n\r\nestates,   and   to   increase  productivity   and\r\n\r\nefficiency. It will do away with all the anomalies\r\n\r\nin  the existing Ordinances and is more in keeping\r\n\r\nwith  our  concept of an equal and  just  society.\r\n\r\nUnless our Government seeks to establish a healthy\r\n\r\ninvestment climate so necessary and vital for  the\r\n\r\nsetting up of export-oriented and labour intensive\r\n\r\nindustries,  our  task to solve  the  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem will be hopeless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage more investments in industries, both\r\n\r\nfrom local and foreign sources, certain terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions of service should be so legislated that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  is  little room for prolonged  negotiations\r\n\r\nunder  the present Industrial Relations Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1960.  In  the  national interest and  to  develop\r\n\r\ngreater  economic growth, such a Bill as  the  new\r\n\r\nEmployment Bill is essential for the crucial years\r\n\r\nahead.  The measures as provided in the  new  Bill\r\n\r\nmay  on  the  surface appear to be  repugnant  and\r\n\r\nretrogressive to our trade unionists, but I am  of\r\n\r\nthe  opinion  that there are only  a  few  clauses\r\n\r\nwhich  may  have  to be amended to  safeguard  the\r\n\r\ninterests    of   workers   against   unscrupulous\r\n\r\nemployers. I will deal with the important  clauses\r\n\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House must always bear in mind\r\n\r\nthat  newly  emergent  independent  countries  and\r\n\r\nother  countries  situated in this  part  of  Asia\r\n\r\nwhich have achieved independence much earlier than\r\n\r\nwe   have,  are  also  actively  promoting   their\r\n\r\neconomic  growth  in diversifying  their  hitherto\r\n\r\nagricultural economy. This they do by  encouraging\r\n\r\nthe  setting up of light and secondary industries.\r\n\r\nThese   countries   have   cheaper   labour    and\r\n\r\nunfavourable working conditions and the  terms  of\r\n\r\nemployment  of  the workers are exploited  to  the\r\n\r\nfull  by  capitalists. We in Singapore are already\r\n\r\nfinding  it difficult to compete in certain  types\r\n\r\nof  manufactures for export because of lower  cost\r\n\r\nof products from these other countries. To compete\r\n\r\nwith  them,  we  will have to use  automation  and\r\n\r\ncomputers in our industries, which will mean  that\r\n\r\nwe  will  employ only a small number  of  workers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we cannot provide jobs for our mounting\r\n\r\nunemployed employables who are flooding the labour\r\n\r\nmarket  each year. For us, the alternative  is  to\r\n\r\ncreate the maximum number of job opportunities for\r\n\r\nour  untapped labour force who can be  trained  to\r\n\r\nacquire  new  skills. Our people  have  a  natural\r\n\r\naptitude  for work in labour intensive industries,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the textile mills, electronic industries,\r\n\r\nmetal   and  steel  fabricated  industries,  ship-building  and ship repairing industries,  etc.  In\r\n\r\norder  to  attain these latter objectives  and  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  challenges ahead brought about  by  the\r\n\r\naccelerated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBritish  withdrawal,  we  must  have  settled  and\r\n\r\nstable  labour  conditions to give confidence  and\r\n\r\ninducements  to  foreign, and local  investors  to\r\n\r\nmake  our  Republic the industrial  base  of  this\r\n\r\nregion.  The  enactment of this Bill into  law  at\r\n\r\nthis crucial period of our short history will go a\r\n\r\nlong  way  to promote and foster that  climate  so\r\n\r\nnecessary for our economic survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I advise hon. Members of Parliament who are\r\n\r\nfrom  the  trade unions that it is  their  bounden\r\n\r\nduty to pass on by every means to every worker  at\r\n\r\nevery   level   in  the  land  the   meaning   and\r\n\r\nsignificance of the Employment Bill.  The  enemies\r\n\r\nof our State should not be allowed a chance to use\r\n\r\nthis  Bill as a rallying cause for their  disloyal\r\n\r\nand unpatriotic motive to create industrial strife\r\n\r\nand  thereby engender chaotic economic conditions.\r\n\r\nIf they succeed, we will fall into their trap. Our\r\n\r\nnation  will perish and we will never rise  again.\r\n\r\nOur  identity  as  an  independent  and  sovereign\r\n\r\nSingapore in this part of Asia will pass into  the\r\n\r\nlimbo of history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Employment Bill, I agree, will generate\r\n\r\nwith  good cause, fears in the minds of the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  Members  of this House,  as  it  will  open\r\n\r\nopportunities   to  ruthless   and   less   social\r\n\r\nconscious   employers   to   exploit   labour   by\r\n\r\nextracting  the maximum of financial  returns  and\r\n\r\ngiving  the minimum of benefit in return.  But  in\r\n\r\nthe  final analysis, it takes two willing  parties\r\n\r\nto    form    a   harmonious   and   understanding\r\n\r\npartnership, and with goodwill on both sides  much\r\n\r\ncan be accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In industries and commercial houses, labour and\r\n\r\ncapital  must strive sincerely for a  healthy  and\r\n\r\ntrue  partnership. There must be some  measure  of\r\n\r\nsacrifice  for  the  national  interest  and   not\r\n\r\nsectional    interest   in   order   to    achieve\r\n\r\nproductivity and efficiency at the highest  pitch.\r\n\r\nWhen these twin objectives are achieved, then only\r\n\r\ncan  we  produce goods at competitive  prices  for\r\n\r\nexport.  The sort of relationship existing between\r\n\r\nlabour and capital will finally decide our destiny\r\n\r\nas  to whether we can succeed as an industrial and\r\n\r\nservicing base for South-east Asia and a  thriving\r\n\r\nand prosperous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnation.  Much depends upon the type of  leadership\r\n\r\nwe have in both camps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two years of industrial relations as\r\n\r\ncompared  with those of the 1950s,  which  gave  a\r\n\r\nsour and bitter taste to labour, have demonstrated\r\n\r\nthat   we   have   progressive   and   enlightened\r\n\r\nmanagement  on  the one hand and  responsible  and\r\n\r\nsensible trade union leaders on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now make a few comments on two or three\r\n\r\nnew  provisions  in the Bill. If they  are  passed\r\n\r\nwithout  amendments,  they  will  have  unsettling\r\n\r\neffects on the minds and morale of labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 - employment of a person after the age\r\n\r\nof  55  years.  To  retire compulsorily  a  worker\r\n\r\nearning   less  than  $750  from   his   firm   is\r\n\r\nunrealistic   and  not  alive   to   our   present\r\n\r\ndeveloping economy. Our nation has just  begun  to\r\n\r\nindustrialise and in many of our small and medium-sized local enterprises, supervisors, technicians,\r\n\r\nforemen and charge-hands usually draw salaries  of\r\n\r\nless  than $750. With the experience and expertise\r\n\r\nacquired  during the long years of  their  working\r\n\r\nlife, they are mainly responsible for running  the\r\n\r\nfirms  for  their employers. If these  supervisory\r\n\r\nand  shop-floor staff and experienced workers  are\r\n\r\nretired  at the age of 55, these enterprises  will\r\n\r\nbe  crippled and replacements will be difficult to\r\n\r\nfind. A more reasonable age to retire a worker  in\r\n\r\nthese special categories which may be spelt out in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  should be 60 years if  they  are  still\r\n\r\nmedically fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 47 - payment of bonus. In most existing\r\n\r\ncollective agreements between management and trade\r\n\r\nunions,  there is already a provision for  payment\r\n\r\nof  bonus  ranging  from half a month's  to  three\r\n\r\nmonths'  wages. To take away these fringe benefits\r\n\r\nfrom the workers without giving back something  to\r\n\r\nthem  would  be unfair and harsh. A bonus  is  the\r\n\r\nequivalent  of  a  red  packet  which  the   Asian\r\n\r\nemployer as a matter of tradition or custom  gives\r\n\r\nto his workers during the New Year as a gesture of\r\n\r\ngoodwill.  This bonus provides a source  of  ready\r\n\r\ncash  either to purchase new clothes and shoes  to\r\n\r\ncelebrate the most important festive occasion once\r\n\r\na year,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  to  purchase books, school uniforms, etc, for\r\n\r\nschool-going children when school reopens  at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning of each year. Therefore, it is necessary\r\n\r\nas  a safeguard in the interest of workers against\r\n\r\nirresponsible  employers to provide  a  clause  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  bonus with a minimum of  one  week's\r\n\r\nwages and a maximum of one month's wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a further incentive to and as a reward for\r\n\r\ngreater productivity and profit for the worker, we\r\n\r\nshould  consider  provision for  an  extra  bonus,\r\n\r\nadditional to the statutory maximum of one month's\r\n\r\nwages  mentioned above. This additional bonus  has\r\n\r\nto be earned and must be related to the net profit\r\n\r\nof  the firm. The worker's actual contribution, by\r\n\r\nworking  harder  and putting  in  more  effort  to\r\n\r\nincrease productivity, thereby producing goods  at\r\n\r\na  more competitive price to earn more profits for\r\n\r\nthe  firm,  should be recognised in some  concrete\r\n\r\nand financial form. His entitlement to a share  of\r\n\r\nthe  net  profit is a just claim as  he  would  be\r\n\r\npartly  responsible  for any favourable  financial\r\n\r\nresults each year. The quantum of his share should\r\n\r\nnot  be  the  subject of negotiation  because,  as\r\n\r\noften as not, such negotiations lead to industrial\r\n\r\ndisputes   and  sours  the  industrial   relations\r\n\r\nbetween  labour  and management. I  would  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the  share of the net profit of the  company\r\n\r\nshould  range from two to four per cent among  all\r\n\r\nworkers   drawing  less  than  $750   per   month.\r\n\r\nProvision of this small percentage out of the  net\r\n\r\nprofit  may directly affect the yearly  bonus  and\r\n\r\nfees  of  the  directors  and  management  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany.  But  in showing this generosity  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers, the company will be more than compensated\r\n\r\nby the goodwill and co-operation that is expressed\r\n\r\nby  the  workers  in more efficient  productivity.\r\n\r\nThere  should be no bargaining on the  quantum  of\r\n\r\nbonus. It should be left to the sole discretion of\r\n\r\nthe  management.  Existing  collective  agreements\r\n\r\nwith  the  bonus clause should, in my opinion,  be\r\n\r\npermitted  to  run  out  by  the  end   of   1968,\r\n\r\nirrespective of their expiry date. New  agreements\r\n\r\nshould be negotiated in the spirit of the new Bill\r\n\r\nwhen it is passed by this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the enactment of this new Bill into law, it\r\n\r\nwould be wise that the first agreement drawn up in\r\n\r\nthe  context of this Bill should be for a duration\r\n\r\nof  five  years  instead of three  years  for  new\r\n\r\nindustries  to  be  set up and industries  already\r\n\r\ngranted  pioneer  status. It  takes  a  few  years\r\n\r\nbefore  any newly established industry can  really\r\n\r\nstand on its feet and show a sound balance sheet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may sound unreasonable in my views, but in the\r\n\r\nlong run the country in particular and the workers\r\n\r\nin   general  will  reap  the  benefit  when   the\r\n\r\nindustries  can  progress  and  become  viable  to\r\n\r\ngenerate greater economic growth. This clause,  if\r\n\r\nincorporated into the Bill, will also add  impetus\r\n\r\nto  more  and  more foreign investors coming  into\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I have to sound a warning. To make a\r\n\r\nsuccess of the operation of this Employment  Bill,\r\n\r\nboth   workers   and   employers   must   remember\r\n\r\nconstantly that both labour and management have to\r\n\r\nmake  sacrifice  in the national interest  and  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  industrial peace at  all  costs  in  the\r\n\r\ncrucial   years  ahead.  By  maintaining   cordial\r\n\r\nindustrial relations, a good image of Singapore as\r\n\r\na country of economic and political stability will\r\n\r\nbe  projected  abroad with more foreign  investors\r\n\r\nbeing  attracted  to our shores. In  other  words,\r\n\r\nwith  more industries established, more jobs  will\r\n\r\nbe created, more types of manufactures can be more\r\n\r\nexported,  more  profits can be  earned  and  more\r\n\r\nrevenue  will  go  to Government  for  defence  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  our security. The end result will  be  a\r\n\r\nmore  prosperous Singapore in which everyone -  be\r\n\r\nhe  an  employer or a worker -will share  in  this\r\n\r\nprosperity.   Our   citizens   should   discipline\r\n\r\nthemselves  and face the future economic  problems\r\n\r\nwith  good sense, soberness and make some personal\r\n\r\nsacrifices. What is considered a sacrifice in  the\r\n\r\nshort-term  interest  will  produce  material  and\r\n\r\nfinancial benefits in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill moved by the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.31 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, Singapore is not an agricultural country  and\r\n\r\nhas  no natural resources. It is an industrial and\r\n\r\ntrading  centre.  Therefore,  the  people   should\r\n\r\r\nconsider  what  future is in store  for  them.  It\r\n\r\nfollows  that plans to provide for the future  and\r\n\r\nensure  the  country's prosperity  should  be  our\r\n\r\ncommon responsibility. The labour laws, too,  need\r\n\r\ncareful review because this will affect the future\r\n\r\nof  our  people  and that of the nation.  A  great\r\n\r\nmajority  of the population of Singapore comprises\r\n\r\nthe labour force. Labour unrest means the people's\r\n\r\nunrest, and the people's unrest means a threat  to\r\n\r\nthe nation's prosperity in the future. Every piece\r\n\r\nof labour legislation should be carefully examined\r\n\r\nin  its  proper  perspective and the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement,  that  is,  the  National  Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress, should be consulted. We do not  wish  to\r\n\r\nsee   labour  disputes  in  our  country,  as  had\r\n\r\nhappened before the P.A.P. assumed office. We need\r\n\r\nto  ensure  good relationship between  labour  and\r\n\r\nmanagement   which   will  result   in   increased\r\n\r\nproductivity  and prosperity for the country.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  plays the role of an intermediary  and\r\n\r\nsteps  should be taken to create an atmosphere  of\r\n\r\nconfidence in both parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Bill has generated a heated debate\r\n\r\nnot  only within the House but also outside by the\r\n\r\ntrade  union movement. We realise that all workers\r\n\r\nwill  wonder what their fate will be as they  will\r\n\r\nbe  affected  in  one way or other  by  the  Bill.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they may be adversely affected. There  are\r\n\r\ngroups of workers whose interests have never  been\r\n\r\nlooked after and who have been exploited by  their\r\n\r\nemployers in the past. Such workers may benefit as\r\n\r\na result of this Bill, because previously they had\r\n\r\nto work more than 44 hours a week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Ministry should not only introduce or\r\n\r\namend labour laws but it must also be prepared  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  workers  from  being  victimised  by\r\n\r\nunscrupulous employers. We have come across  cases\r\n\r\nof  workers who had to work more than 44 hours per\r\n\r\nweek\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout   being  paid  overtime;  also  cases   of\r\n\r\narbitrary  dismissals of workers at  the  whim  of\r\n\r\nemployers.  I  hope  this Bill  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\novercome  all  these difficulties and  ensure  the\r\n\r\nsecurity of the workers in the years ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  inner  circles and rank and file members  of\r\n\r\nthe  trade  union  movement have long  awaited  an\r\n\r\nemployment law to cover all classes and categories\r\n\r\nof  working  people other than those in managerial\r\n\r\nand  executive positions. The Employment  Bill  as\r\n\r\nintroduced by Government, however, falls short  of\r\n\r\nexpectations   as   seamen,   domestic   servants,\r\n\r\nwatchmen  and security guards do not  come  within\r\n\r\nthe  ambit  of  the  Bill. The  rationale  of  our\r\n\r\nattitude is that every employee who enters into or\r\n\r\nworks under a contract of service with an employer\r\n\r\nmust receive the protection of the employment  law\r\n\r\nof the country. In this respect, it is worth while\r\n\r\nto  note  that  the scope of the law will  embrace\r\n\r\nemployees working in undertakings engaged  in  the\r\n\r\ntransport  of passengers or goods by  road,  rail,\r\n\r\nsea,  inland  waterways  or  air,  including   the\r\n\r\nhandling   of  goods  at  docks,  quays,  wharves,\r\n\r\nwarehouses or airports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the point of view of the labour movement, it\r\n\r\nis  acceptable in principle, to repeal the  Labour\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  1955, the Clerks Employment Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1957,   and   the   Shop   Assistants   Employment\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 1957. These were introduced during  the\r\n\r\ncolonial regime to cause class distinction and  to\r\n\r\ndiscriminate further between those covered by  the\r\n\r\nlaws  and those falling outside the scope  of  the\r\n\r\nlaws.   In   principle,  it   is   acceptable   to\r\n\r\nrationalise,  to  streamline  and  to  standardise\r\n\r\nemployment  practices  and  to  lay  down  minimum\r\n\r\nconditions of employment by enacting a new law  to\r\n\r\nreplace the outdated and messy laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The replacement of the existing labour laws by\r\n\r\none  employment law is not a controversial matter.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  controversial are certain provisions  in\r\n\r\nthe Employment Bill which tend to remove\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  rights  of  the workers from enjoying  fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits,  and the reasons propounded  to  justify\r\n\r\ntheir  removal.  To take away the  benefits  which\r\n\r\nworkers   are  now  enjoying  through   collective\r\n\r\nbargaining  or  through other legitimate  ways  is\r\n\r\nterribly unreasonable and unjust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major offences against workers is the\r\n\r\nattempt  to  remove from the field of negotiations\r\n\r\nthe  matter  of bonus and ex-gratia  payments.  In\r\n\r\nthis  respect,  the  loss of this  right  will  be\r\n\r\ngrievously  felt. Bonus has become  entrenched  in\r\n\r\nthe  salary structure of the private sector and  a\r\n\r\nvital  supplement to the worker's income.  It  has\r\n\r\nbecome  payable not only to workmen, clerks,  shop\r\n\r\nassistants  and  other classes of  employees,  but\r\n\r\neven to executives in the private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of negotiability of bonus has been\r\n\r\nestablished  by the trade unions and  accepted  by\r\n\r\nthe Industrial Arbitration Court. The concept that\r\n\r\nbonus  is  payable only when there are  reasonable\r\n\r\nprofits  is  prevalent in Singapore. This  is  the\r\n\r\ntrend in Singapore and the emergence of this trend\r\n\r\nis  consistent  with the principle that  employees\r\n\r\nshould have the right to claim an equitable  share\r\n\r\nof  profits  as  a  result of  their  labour.  The\r\n\r\nproposal  to  remove  bonus  from  the  field   of\r\n\r\nnegotiations  and  outside  the  purview  of   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration Court is the rudest  shock\r\n\r\nworkers  have had and an indirect censure  of  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Court. I do not think  that\r\n\r\nthe  President  and the Deputy  President  of  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration Courts and  panel  members\r\n\r\nhave  not  used their good sense and  judgment  in\r\n\r\ngiving  awards  on  matters like  bonus.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect, there is no necessity to circumscribe the\r\n\r\njurisdiction  of the Court unless  the  Court  has\r\n\r\nbeen making haywire decisions. I believe that  the\r\n\r\nCourt,  in  making  awards,  has  been  guided  by\r\n\r\nsection  31 of the Industrial Relations Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1960, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In determining a trade dispute the Court may\r\n\r\nhave  regard  not  only to the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\npersons immediately concerned but to the interests\r\n\r\nof the community as a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhole  and  in  particular the  condition  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy of the State.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The Court, I am sure, has followed the guidance in\r\n\r\nsection  31 of the Industrial Relations  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwhen it stated in an award in the case between the\r\n\r\nChartered  Bank and the Bank Employees'  Union  on\r\n\r\n17th November, 1966, that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On the whole, in the present economic context,\r\n\r\nit  would  be preferable to effect adjustments  in\r\n\r\nbonus  whether upwards or downwards as the general\r\n\r\neconomic  condition, the particular  circumstances\r\n\r\nof  each  case and the position of the parties  in\r\n\r\neach   particular  dispute  are  being  considered\r\n\r\nrather  than  to make adjustments  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nbasic salaries which are matters of more long-term\r\n\r\napplication.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Industrial Arbitration Court is to\r\n\r\nconsider  all the policy statements  made  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and stick to the principle  enunciated\r\n\r\nin the case cited, there could be virtually a wage\r\n\r\nfreeze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I venture to say that if in due\r\n\r\ncourse  workers discover that there  has  been  an\r\n\r\noverall loss rather than gain, it may well lead to\r\n\r\nan  assault on the wage front. In view of the fact\r\n\r\nthat employers can refuse to pay bonus in spite of\r\n\r\nhigher  productivity, it will  be  interesting  to\r\n\r\nwatch  in which direction the Court will  tip  the\r\n\r\nscale. To my mind, it will be a good thing for the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  as  a  matter of  policy,  to  direct\r\n\r\nemployers   and   trade   unions   to   work   out\r\n\r\nproductivity bonus scales and payments rather than\r\n\r\nremove  the  payment of bonus from the purview  of\r\n\r\nnegotiability.  Should any dispute  arise  between\r\n\r\nthe  parties, it could be referred to the National\r\n\r\nProductivity Council which, I expect, can reliably\r\n\r\nbe depended upon to give correct advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, the National Productivity\r\n\r\nCouncil   can   be  given  statutory   powers   to\r\n\r\ninvestigate  and to make decisions on productivity\r\n\r\nproblems.  The question of increasing productivity\r\n\r\nin  any  firm  or undertaking and the  payment  of\r\n\r\nproductivity  rewards  can  also  be  worked   out\r\n\r\nbetween the particular employer, employees' representatives\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the National Productivity  Council.\r\n\r\nThere  must  be  the  machinery  for  working  out\r\n\r\nproductivity plans, examining the results and  for\r\n\r\nnegotiating  the  payment of incentive  awards  to\r\n\r\nmake   any   productivity   drive   achieve    its\r\n\r\nobjectives.    The    question    of    increasing\r\n\r\nproductivity is an urgent matter and should be  of\r\n\r\nserious  concern to employers, Government  workers\r\n\r\nand   their  organisations  in  the  interest   of\r\n\r\neconomic progress. In this respect, if workers are\r\n\r\nasked to give their wholehearted support to higher\r\n\r\nproductivity programmes and campaigns,  they  must\r\n\r\nbe    allowed   to   participate   actively    and\r\n\r\nconstructively  in  formulating  and  implementing\r\n\r\nthem.  When  there  is  success,  there  must   be\r\n\r\nconcrete and reasonable returns or rewards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with the foregoing point, it is\r\n\r\nbeyond  comprehension why the payment of bonus  to\r\n\r\nworkers, a vital incentive to higher productivity,\r\n\r\nis  to  be non-negotiable. This is indeed a  great\r\n\r\ninjustice   to  workers.  The  trade   unions   do\r\n\r\nvehemently  protest  against the  attempt  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to remove bonus or ex-gratia  payments\r\n\r\nfrom  the  purview of negotiability. It cannot  be\r\n\r\nexpected that all employers will wisely and fairly\r\n\r\npay productivity bonus. The game of the carrot  or\r\n\r\nthe  stick may very well degenerate to the  extent\r\n\r\nwhere an employer provides incentives for personal\r\n\r\nfavours. It is too far-fetched to believe that all\r\n\r\nemployers  who  are  making  profits  will  pay  a\r\n\r\nproductivity  bonus  notwithstanding  the  profits\r\n\r\nwhich  can  be  attributed to the productivity  of\r\n\r\nlabour. If clause 47 stands unamended, workers can\r\n\r\nexpect to lose everything in the form of bonus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at this juncture I wish to ask\r\n\r\nthe   Government  to  be  ever  watchful   against\r\n\r\nunscrupulous  employers taking  advantage  of  the\r\n\r\nEmployment   Act  and  the  Industrial   Relations\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Act to sour up industrial  stability,\r\n\r\nharmony  and progress. I am prompted to  say  this\r\n\r\nbecause  there are indications that some employers\r\n\r\nare   interpreting   the   introduction   of   the\r\n\r\nEmployment Bill and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Relations (Amendment)  Bill  as  a\r\n\r\nsign of \"go-ahead licence to skin the workers\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Minister for Labour himself\r\n\r\ninformed  the House of two uncrupulous  employers,\r\n\r\nwhoever  they may be, who have taken advantage  of\r\n\r\nthe  situation.  I  hope the  Government  will  be\r\n\r\nwatchful   against   employers   victimising   the\r\n\r\nworkers.  This  warning is necessary  because  the\r\n\r\nMinister   has   apparently  now   realised   that\r\n\r\nemployers can abuse the situation created  by  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the  Employment  Bill  and   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations (Amendment) Bill. I  wish  to\r\n\r\ntell the Government that the workers can take  all\r\n\r\nthe  verbal snipings of the Minister in the proper\r\n\r\nspirit, but they will react in the most unfriendly\r\n\r\nway  and  manner  if the Employment  Act  and  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations (Amendment) Act become beach-heads  for the final assault on their job security\r\n\r\nand economic well-being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers, whether white-collar, blue-collar,\r\n\r\nor   bare-neck,  are  not  unconcerned  about  the\r\n\r\neconomic expansion and advancement of the  nation.\r\n\r\nI  am sure they will be prepared to sacrifice some\r\n\r\nof  their most important benefits if, by doing so,\r\n\r\nmore  jobs are created for their unemployed  sons,\r\n\r\ndaughters,  relatives and friends. I am  sure  the\r\n\r\nworkers  who  receive bonus will  be  prepared  to\r\n\r\ncontribute anything between 10 and 20 per cent  to\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Provident Fund if that can  generate\r\n\r\neconomic expansion and activity. This proposal has\r\n\r\nbeen  made  by the National Trades Union Congress,\r\n\r\nand  the offer to the Government is still open for\r\n\r\nthe free negotiability of bonus. This offer, which\r\n\r\nI  have  mentioned,  is the workers'  energy  pact\r\n\r\noffer for national development. The employers  can\r\n\r\nmatch  it if they wish to accept the challenge.  I\r\n\r\nwill  disagree with anyone, including the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour,  that  workers are not  squeezers  of\r\n\r\nfringe benefits, trying to cover every\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontingency they can think of, from the  altar  to\r\n\r\nthe  hospital  and from the cradle to  the  grave.\r\n\r\nMore often than not, it is the employers who would\r\n\r\nbe  prepared to provide more fringe benefits  than\r\n\r\npay adequate wages and rewards for productivity. I\r\n\r\ndare say that if workers are properly remunerated,\r\n\r\nthey will be least bothered about losses of fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits,  like sick leave which, I am sure,  they\r\n\r\ndo not hope to enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the sick leave provision in clause\r\n\r\n44, I do not consider it a productivity booster. I\r\n\r\ndo not agree with the belief that a worker will be\r\n\r\nproductive  if  he works under the fear  that  his\r\n\r\nfamily will suffer if he becomes sick. Under  this\r\n\r\ncondition, he will more likely put in the  minimum\r\n\r\neffort  to  avoid  sickness. The provision  of  14\r\n\r\ndays'  paid  sick  leave  in  each  year,  if   no\r\n\r\nhospitalisation is necessary, and  28  days,  when\r\n\r\nhospitalisation   is   required,   is   definitely\r\n\r\ninadequate. I do not imagine any doctor  can  cure\r\n\r\nanyone  suffering  from a chronic  illness  in  28\r\n\r\ndays.  It  is  unimaginable how a  malingerer  can\r\n\r\npretend to be seriously ill and get his employer's\r\n\r\ndoctor  to  recommend his admission to a hospital.\r\n\r\nIt  is harder to imagine how such a malingerer can\r\n\r\nwrangle   his  way  in  getting  admitted   to   a\r\n\r\nGovernment hospital. I do not see how a malingerer\r\n\r\ncan abuse such a benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I wish to say is that the National Trades\r\n\r\nUnion Congress do not stand by workers abusing any\r\n\r\nbenefit provided. We would agree to the Government\r\n\r\nand  employers  \"smoking  out\"  the  culprits  and\r\n\r\npunishing   them.  But  the  way  the   Government\r\n\r\nproposes to solve their dilemma is like that of  a\r\n\r\nfrantic man who, being unable to catch the rats in\r\n\r\nthe  house, burns his house and everything  in  it\r\n\r\ndown,  regardless  of  the lives  of  his  family.\r\n\r\nHowever,   I  am  gratified  to  know   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will consider the proposals made by the N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the provisions for annual leave\r\n\r\nand  public  holidays, I do agree  that  they  are\r\n\r\nwithin   reasonable   limits   for   new   pioneer\r\n\r\nindustries. To show that the trade union movement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoes  have a social conscience and responsibility,\r\n\r\nwe  agree to the inclusion of clause 42 whereby  a\r\n\r\nworker  who absents himself without excuse on  the\r\n\r\nday  preceding or following a public holiday  will\r\n\r\nnot  receive any public holiday pay.  This  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant and necessary punitive provision against\r\n\r\nthose who interrupt the proper functioning of  the\r\n\r\nundertaking.  I would go to the extent  of  saying\r\n\r\nthat  any  worker  who makes  a  habit  of  taking\r\n\r\n\"French  leave\"  should  be properly  disciplined,\r\n\r\nbecause  we cannot allow ourselves to behave  like\r\n\r\nsome others in another country where, in spite  of\r\n\r\nthe  country's  political and  economic  position,\r\n\r\nthey fail to turn up for work following New Year's\r\n\r\nDay  and other public holidays. To behave  in  the\r\n\r\nsame manner would be disastrous for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the next clause in the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Bill I wish to discuss is  clause  53.\r\n\r\nThis  clause  should be read in  conjunction  with\r\n\r\nclause  7  of the Industrial Relations (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.  It is clear that only collective agreements\r\n\r\nof  industrial  undertakings that  have  commenced\r\n\r\nbusiness  on or after January 1968 are covered  by\r\n\r\nthe  two  provisions.  The National  Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress  fully  support  the  encouragement   and\r\n\r\nprotection of pioneer industries. In this respect,\r\n\r\nit  has  formed the Pioneer Industries  Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion  to  look  after  the  interest  of  pioneer\r\n\r\nindustries  and  their employees. This  particular\r\n\r\nunion  is a credit to the good sense of the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, I hope the Government will\r\n\r\nnot  only  consider the amendments to be moved  by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Bukit Ho Swee but also accept them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I have to say that the\r\n\r\nintentions  of the Employment Bill  are  good  and\r\n\r\nthough I am generally in agreement with the spirit\r\n\r\nof the Bill, I have certain questions to ask.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 requires that every person who attains\r\n\r\nthe  age  of  55 may continue to work  only  after\r\n\r\ngetting  approval  from the Commissioner  who  may\r\n\r\nimpose  conditions  for  continued  employment.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to draw the attention of the  Minister\r\n\r\nto  the following. There are many old people -  by\r\n\r\n\"old\" I mean people between 55 and 60 years of age\r\n\r\n-  who  still have many children to support,  like\r\n\r\nmyself. There are other old people who have grown-up  children but these children are unemployed and\r\n\r\nare dependent on their father. Clause 15 gives the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  arbitrary powers to  decide  on  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood   of  the  whole  family  without   any\r\n\r\nprovision for appeal. For these reasons,  I  think\r\n\r\nthis clause should be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of \"employer\" in page 3 of the\r\n\r\nBill  does not include company, association,  body\r\n\r\ncorporate,  etc.  Although in page  10,  line  37,\r\n\r\n\"body  corporate\" is mentioned, I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nknow  from  the  Minister  whether  the  Bill   is\r\n\r\nintended  to  cover employers such  as  companies,\r\n\r\nassociations, bodies corporate as well as persons.\r\n\r\nIn  this  connection, I wish to draw the attention\r\n\r\nof  the  House to the definition of \"employer\"  in\r\n\r\nthe Central Provident Fund Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Part X of the Bill\r\n\r\nentitled  \"Employment of Women\" deals with  female\r\n\r\nworkmen only. The definition of \"employee\" in page\r\n\r\n2   includes   workman,  but  the  definition   of\r\n\r\n\"workman\"   in  page  6  does  not   include   all\r\n\r\ncategories  of  employees.  For  instance,  female\r\n\r\nclerks  are  included  under  the  definition   of\r\n\r\n\"employee\"   but  not  under  the  definition   of\r\n\r\n\"workman\".  Hence,  the restrictions  provided  in\r\n\r\nPart  X  under the general heading \"Employment  of\r\n\r\nWomen\"  are,  in fact, applicable only  to  female\r\n\r\nworkmen. May I know from the Minister if  this  is\r\n\r\nintentional,  and  if so, why are  female  workmen\r\n\r\ndiscriminated from female clerks and other  female\r\n\r\nemployees?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I now refer to\r\n\r\nclause  112 (b) on page 37 of the Bill? I  do  not\r\n\r\nobject  to  the requirement that employers  should\r\n\r\nnotify the Employment Exchange of vacancies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\navailable  in  their  establishment.  I   do   not\r\n\r\nunderstand why the Minister should prevent persons\r\n\r\nfrom   engaging  employees  except   through   the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Exchange. He seems to have  overlooked\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that in many small establishments,  the\r\n\r\nwife  and children help out in the business.  This\r\n\r\nclause  prevents  the sons of the  proprietors  of\r\n\r\nsmall   shops  from  working  in  their   father's\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  requires them  to  seek  employment\r\n\r\nelsewhere  while  the father has to  employ  other\r\n\r\nproprietors'  sons in his shop.  Furthermore,  the\r\n\r\nengagement  of an employee is not always  accepted\r\n\r\nmerely  on  his  skill or ability. The  factor  of\r\n\r\ntrust often comes in. Where trust is involved, the\r\n\r\nemployer would certainly want an employee  who  is\r\n\r\nrecommended  to  him  rather  than  take   on   an\r\n\r\nunrecommended   stranger.   Would   the   Minister\r\n\r\nconsider   amending  this  clause  to  allow   the\r\n\r\nemployment   of  wives  and  children   of   small\r\n\r\nestablishments and to allow employers to  take  on\r\n\r\nemployees on their own where trust is involved?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Bill\r\n\r\nis designed to increase efficiency and is based on\r\n\r\nthe principle of a full day's pay for a full day's\r\n\r\nwork.  In the light of mounting unemployment  when\r\n\r\ncompetition  for jobs will be keen,  I  hope  that\r\n\r\nthis   Bill   will  help  in  attracting   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestment  in  Singapore  and  create  more   job\r\n\r\nopportunities for our people. It must  be  pointed\r\n\r\nout  that  this  will call for greater  sacrifices\r\n\r\nfrom  the  workers. I hope that the Minister  will\r\n\r\ntake   appropriate  steps  before  the   Bill   is\r\n\r\nimplemented  to  explain to the  workers  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  that  it  is  designed  to  help  increase\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Bill will, in effect, reduce\r\n\r\nthe  earnings of the lower income group. This will\r\n\r\nunavoidably   cause   hardship   to   them.    But\r\n\r\ncompensation  for this hardship  can  be  made  if\r\n\r\nGovernment  lakes appropriate steps to  lower  the\r\n\r\nprices  of locally produced goods. With increasing\r\n\r\nprotection given to manufacturers, it is  possible\r\n\r\nthat some irresponsible manufacturers will exploit\r\n\r\nthis  situation  and  raise prices  unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nThis will bring up the cost of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nliving for the lower income group. I urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment to look into this seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am strongly against the provision\r\n\r\nin  the  Employment Bill which stipulates  that  a\r\n\r\nperson shall retire at the age of 55. We all  know\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  saying,  \"At thirty,  one  is  quite\r\n\r\nyoung, and one enters middle age at 40 and 50.\" So\r\n\r\nwith  this  provision in the Bill, a  person  will\r\n\r\nhave to retire compulsorily on reaching the age of\r\n\r\n55. He will be put in cold storage. That will mean\r\n\r\nthat  he will be frozen and starved to death. When\r\n\r\na person is 55 years old, it does not mean that he\r\n\r\nis  senile. I am 63 years old. When I was 55 I was\r\n\r\nelected  a  Member of this House. I have  been  in\r\n\r\nthis  House all this while and I do not admit that\r\n\r\nI am old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when Dr Lee Siew Choh of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis was in this Chamber, he shivered\r\n\r\nwhenever he stood up to speak because he could not\r\n\r\nstand the air-conditioning here. As you can see, I\r\n\r\nam not clad in any cardigan or overcoat. There was\r\n\r\none  Parliamentary sitting which  lasted  up  till\r\n\r\nmidnight and the Chamber was extremely cold. I was\r\n\r\nstill  wearing  my ordinary shirt and  I  did  not\r\n\r\nshiver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you order a person to retire at 55 years of\r\n\r\nage, it is too arbitrary and very unreasonable. We\r\n\r\nknow  that most Chinese people work for  a  living\r\n\r\nwithout the benefit of a pension. If these  people\r\n\r\nare  forced to retire at 55, whom do we expect  to\r\n\r\nmaintain their children? Can we refer them to  the\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare Department? Moreover,  the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Department pays public assistance  out  of\r\n\r\npublic funds. This would mean that you are putting\r\n\r\nout of operation people who are still economically\r\n\r\nactive  and  maintaining them at  public  expense.\r\n\r\nThis  is not fair. In my view, this clause  should\r\n\r\nbe deleted from the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, at 55 a person is still\r\n\r\nstrong  enough  to work. He can  even  be  at  the\r\n\r\nforefront  of our economic activities. This  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  important year in his life. He has  got  all\r\n\r\nthe experience of his life when he reaches 55.  He\r\n\r\nis  cultured  and at the prime of  his  life.  The\r\n\r\nyoung people may still be suckling and without any\r\n\r\nexperience to take over from the old-timers. I  am\r\n\r\nin  full support of young people working,  but  we\r\n\r\nmust  not allow them to take over everything.  Due\r\n\r\nrespect must be given to old people. They must  be\r\n\r\nwell  looked after. I think I am the oldest Member\r\n\r\nin  this  House and I must speak my mind  on  this\r\n\r\nclause.  I am representing many people in  my  age\r\n\r\ngroup.  I hope the Minister will review clause  15\r\n\r\nand  take  steps  to delete it. Whether  a  person\r\n\r\nretires  or  not  at  55  should  depend  on   his\r\n\r\nperformance  and not on his age.  If  he  has  the\r\n\r\nability  to  work, then he should  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to do so. In fact, many people occupying\r\n\r\ntop  positions in organisations and in  Government\r\n\r\nservice are old people. There are some old  people\r\n\r\nwho  are  Presidents and Prime Ministers. It  does\r\n\r\nnot  mean  that when one is 55 he is incapable  of\r\n\r\ndoing anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the provision of payment of\r\n\r\nbonus,  we should realise that people employed  in\r\n\r\nChinese firms draw a very low salary. They  get  a\r\n\r\nbonus  only  at  the  end of  the  year.  This  is\r\n\r\nutilised for extra expenditure on their family. It\r\n\r\nenables them to buy new shoes and new clothes  and\r\n\r\ndefray  other expenses so that they  can  enjoy  a\r\n\r\nhappy  New Year. So if the bonus is denied to  the\r\n\r\nworkers,  how do we expect them to go through  the\r\n\r\nNew  Year? Their salary is very low and they  have\r\n\r\nno  savings for the New Year festival.  Where  can\r\n\r\nthey  get  the  money to pay for  their  New  Year\r\n\r\nexpenses? They have to depend on the bonus. In  my\r\n\r\nview,  the  provision restricting the  payment  of\r\n\r\nbonus should be deleted from the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, under the colonial government of\r\n\r\nGreat Britain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  later,  during  the semi-colonial  days,  the\r\n\r\nworkers of Singapore were entirely at the mercy of\r\n\r\nthe employers.

The conditions\r\n\r\nof  employment of workers in Singapore then became\r\n\r\nmore reasonable and rationalised. Various benefits\r\n\r\nwere  given  to  them.  All  these  benefits  were\r\n\r\ngranted  on a reciprocal basis between labour  and\r\n\r\nmanagement.  The  aim was to maintain  social  and\r\n\r\nindustrial  stability. As a result of this,  there\r\n\r\nwas  tremendous  improvement and progress  in  the\r\n\r\ncommercial   and  industrial  field.   There   was\r\n\r\nprosperity all round.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A trade union house was erected for the working\r\n\r\nclass  under the leadership of a democratic  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement. This is a glorious  page  in  the\r\n\r\nhistory of Singapore. It is a great achievement by\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P.  Government  in  striving   for   the\r\n\r\ninterests of the workers of Singapore. This is  an\r\n\r\nundeniable fact. It is there for everybody to see.\r\n\r\nIt  is a monument to the pro-labour policy of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir. Singapore is a small island\r\n\r\nlacking  in  natural resources and an agricultural\r\n\r\nbase.  Ever since it was opened up as a  port,  it\r\n\r\nhas been a base for the United Kingdom. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  accelerated withdrawal of British troops from\r\n\r\nSingapore will inevitably have grave repercussions\r\n\r\non  Singapore.  Within the  next  few  years,  the\r\n\r\nproblems  confronting Singapore  will  be  of  the\r\n\r\nutmost  importance.  This  will  be  the  greatest\r\n\r\nchallenge  we have ever had. It will be  the  most\r\n\r\ndifficult period that we have to go through. I  am\r\n\r\nglad  to  know,  however, that the Government  has\r\n\r\nalready  taken steps to prepare for the  worst  to\r\n\r\ncome.  Steps have already been taken for  a  rainy\r\n\r\nday,  as was indicated by the Minister for Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs  and  Minister for Labour  in  this  House\r\n\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister said that the\r\n\r\nEmployment   Bill  was  introduced   for   various\r\n\r\nreasons. He then outlined these very carefully  in\r\n\r\nthis House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Employment Bill, he said, was intended to pave\r\n\r\nthe  way  for greater economic growth in Singapore\r\n\r\nin  order  to ensure our survival in the next  few\r\n\r\nyears.  He also assured the House that it  is  not\r\n\r\nthe intention of the Government to allow labour to\r\n\r\nbe exploited through the Employment Bill. The long-term interests of the workers in Singapore will be\r\n\r\nsafeguarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also the intention to ensure that Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  be able to overcome the difficulties arising\r\n\r\nout  of  the  accelerated  withdrawal  of  British\r\n\r\nforces by the end of 1971. The problems have  been\r\n\r\npicturesquely painted by the Minister. Because  of\r\n\r\nthe  withdrawal of British troops, a sum  of  $450\r\n\r\nmillion,  representing  the  expenditure  of   the\r\n\r\nForces,  will  be  withdrawn from  circulation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  As a result of the British withdrawal,\r\n\r\nmore  than 50,000 people will be unemployed,  both\r\n\r\ndirectly and indirectly. 21,000 civilian employees\r\n\r\nin  the  British bases will be directly  affected.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  a  lot  of other ancillary  services\r\n\r\nprovided  by  taxi  drivers,  amahs,  shopkeepers,\r\n\r\nrestaurants,  bars  and others will  be  adversely\r\n\r\naffected by the withdrawal of British Forces  from\r\n\r\nSingapore.  And  added to all  this  will  be  the\r\n\r\nschool-leavers numbering some 25,000  coming  into\r\n\r\nthe   labour  market  every  year.  These  massive\r\n\r\nfigures   of  unemployment  are  frightening   and\r\n\r\nindicate   the   seriouness  of  the  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the British troops are withdrawn, Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  not get the assistance of the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nin   its  defence.  So  we  will  have  to  defend\r\n\r\nourselves. As a result, we will have to  build  up\r\n\r\nour  military capability. We will have to shoulder\r\n\r\nthe responsibility of ensuring our security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to overcome these problems, massive\r\n\r\neconomic financing is needed. We know that capital\r\n\r\nis   a   motivating  force  in  industry.  Without\r\n\r\ncapital,  industrialisation will be  a  flop.  The\r\n\r\nsuccess  of  industrialisation  depends   on   the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of factories and this requires  capital.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  Government has to encourage  both\r\n\r\nlocal and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforeign  capitalists to invest in  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment   has   also   given   investors   many\r\n\r\nincentives   and   tax   holidays   as   well   as\r\n\r\nconcessions.  For  instance,  profits  earned   in\r\n\r\nSingapore by foreign capital will be allowed to be\r\n\r\nremitted  back  to the country of origin.  We  are\r\n\r\nfully  aware of the problems and the necessity  of\r\n\r\nconcessions. But in spite of the attractive  terms\r\n\r\nthat we are giving to foreign capitalists, we have\r\n\r\nnot  been  able to get enough foreign  capital  to\r\n\r\ninvest here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the Government has introduced the\r\n\r\nEmployment   Bill.  It  is  to  give  better   and\r\n\r\nfavourable  terms to the employers,  even  at  the\r\n\r\nexpense  of  the workers to some extent.  I  think\r\n\r\nthis is unavoidable. But to ensure the survival of\r\n\r\nthe  country as well as safeguard the interest  of\r\n\r\nour  future  generations,  we  have  to  view  the\r\n\r\nEmployment Bill dispassionately. I appreciate that\r\n\r\nthe   provisions  in  the  Employment   Bill   are\r\n\r\nnecessary  and  quite inevitable. I  support  this\r\n\r\nBill in principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are certain clauses in the Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  require  amendments.  I  must  indicate  my\r\n\r\nsupport for the proposed amendments to be moved by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Bukit  Ho Swee,  especially  the\r\n\r\ndeletion  of  clause  15  relating  to  compulsory\r\n\r\nretirement of employees at the age of 55.  Another\r\n\r\namendment is in relation to sick leave.  Also  the\r\n\r\namendments to clauses 46, 47 and 53.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to put forward the views of the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Thomson for the consideration  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour. The first point is whether he\r\n\r\nwill  consider restricting the application of this\r\n\r\nBill  to the Jurong Industrial Estate only so that\r\n\r\nworkers  in other sectors will not be affected  as\r\n\r\nthey  are covered by existing agreements.  If  the\r\n\r\nexperiment turns out to be successful in Jurong in\r\n\r\nattracting more foreign capital and creating  more\r\n\r\nemployment  opportunities,  then  we  may  perhaps\r\n\r\nconsider extending the scope of the application of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  to other sectors as well. If this  Bill\r\n\r\ncan  really  bring  about  the  success  that   is\r\n\r\nenvisaged  for  it,  then  the  Jurong  Industrial\r\n\r\nEstate will become more and more prosperous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to suggest is that before\r\n\r\nthe provisions of this Bill are enforced, adequate\r\n\r\npublicity should be given to the intention of  the\r\n\r\nBill  which is to safeguard the long-term interest\r\n\r\nand the survival of Singapore. The people must  be\r\n\r\ntold  that it is their responsibility to make some\r\n\r\nsacrifices   to  ensure  the  survival   and   the\r\n\r\ncontinuing      prosperity      of      Singapore,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding  the  withdrawal  of  the  British\r\n\r\nforces. The people must be made to believe that it\r\n\r\nis in their own interest that this Employment Bill\r\n\r\nhas  been  introduced. It is only then  that  they\r\n\r\nwill realise the necessity of this Bill. When they\r\n\r\nare  properly informed, we will be able to enforce\r\n\r\nthe Bill more effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I think it is generally appreciated that this\r\n\r\nBill   has  been  introduced  in  order  to   meet\r\n\r\neffectively  the serious economic challenges  that\r\n\r\nwe  face. However, the Government appears to  have\r\n\r\nmade  certain  dubious assumptions.  Factors  like\r\n\r\nincreased productivity, greater efficiency and the\r\n\r\nlike  are  not  hampered solely  by  the  workers.\r\n\r\nCertainly  there have been a number of restrictive\r\n\r\npractices   by   workers   which   have   hampered\r\n\r\nproductivity, efficiency and so on. But  it  would\r\n\r\nbe  a  very  grave error to assume that  employers\r\n\r\nhave nothing to contribute towards this situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have made a study of the reasons for\r\n\r\nthe  failure  of British industry in recent  years\r\n\r\nhave very cogently pointed out that the guilt  for\r\n\r\nthe failure of British industry can by no means be\r\n\r\nattributed  to the British workers alone.  British\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs have also been seriously  guilty  of\r\n\r\nhampering  industrial productivity and  efficiency\r\n\r\nby  persistent  use  of  obsolete  and  antiquated\r\n\r\nequipment, outdated management techniques  and  so\r\n\r\nforth.  Surely, something must be done  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat the employers also on their part remove\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobstacles to increased productivity and industrial\r\n\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be appreciated that this Bill will fail\r\n\r\nto  achieve its objectives if only the workers are\r\n\r\nexpected  to sweat their guts out in an effort  to\r\n\r\nincrease  productivity when they clearly  will  be\r\n\r\ninhibited from making their contribution  if  they\r\n\r\nare  expected to do so on the basis of  antiquated\r\n\r\nequipment  and outdated production techniques.  To\r\n\r\nmany   employers,  particularly  local  employers,\r\n\r\nincreased productivity is of less concern to  them\r\n\r\nthan  increased profits. They can  be  assured  of\r\n\r\nincreased  profits without increased  productivity\r\n\r\nif  workers  are expected to sweat out their  guts\r\n\r\nfor  them.  But  managements  themselves  make  no\r\n\r\nsignificant    contribution   towards    increased\r\n\r\nproductivity and industrial efficiency through the\r\n\r\nuse  of  modern  equipment and  modern  production\r\n\r\ntechniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be an appropriate moment for me to\r\n\r\nthrow  out  this  challenge to  the  employers  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. Subject to certain amendments  to  some\r\n\r\nof  the  provisions  of the  Bill  which  will  be\r\n\r\nintroduced  at a later stage, the National  Trades\r\n\r\nUnion Congress accepts the objectives of the Bill.\r\n\r\nWe  are ready to be patriotic and to discharge our\r\n\r\npatriotic  obligations  for  a  better  and   more\r\n\r\nprosperous Singapore. When it comes to the crunch,\r\n\r\nthe  Government knows that it will have to  depend\r\n\r\nlargely  on  the  patriotic  sentiments   of   our\r\n\r\nworkers.  All  our  stakes are in  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nworkers  cannot run away in moments of  crisis  to\r\n\r\nmore  prosperous countries. By and large, we shall\r\n\r\nstand  or  fall with Singapore and are, therefore,\r\n\r\nready  to  make our contribution. But I  challenge\r\n\r\nthe   employers  of  Singapore,  especially  local\r\n\r\nemployers,  to state whether they will accept  the\r\n\r\nspirit of this legislation and will make the  same\r\n\r\npatriotic contribution as the workers are expected\r\n\r\nto  do.  By all means, let them make their profit,\r\n\r\nfor  profitability is a legitimate motive. But are\r\n\r\nthey prepared to plough back a substantial portion\r\n\r\nof their profits into re-investment for industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion?  Will they be prepared to  get  rid  of\r\n\r\nobsolete\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmachinery and antiquated production techniques and\r\n\r\ntake   to   modern   machinery  and   methods   of\r\n\r\nproduction? If they are prepared to do this,  then\r\n\r\nthe  workers and the Government of Singapore  will\r\n\r\nbe able to respect them as being motivated more by\r\n\r\npatriotism   than   by   mere   consideration   of\r\n\r\nprofitability. But if our local employers  do  not\r\n\r\ndo  this, then their patriotism must be subject to\r\n\r\nserious doubt. In that event, they will show that,\r\n\r\nunlike  the workers, they cannot be depended  upon\r\n\r\nin  a  moment of crisis. In other words,  when  it\r\n\r\ncomes  to  the real crunch, they will be  men  who\r\n\r\nwill  be  ready to leave the sinking ship and  fly\r\n\r\noff elsewhere with their ill-gotten gains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I throw out this challenge in this Chamber, the\r\n\r\nsupreme  legislature  of our  Republic,  to  local\r\n\r\nemployers  in the name of the workers of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  in  all  seriousness. Let them answer  it  in\r\n\r\nclear and categorical terms. I am certain that the\r\n\r\nworkers  of  Singapore will prove  ready,  by  and\r\n\r\nlarge,  to  discharge Their patriotic obligations.\r\n\r\nBut we would like to know publicly how and in what\r\n\r\nmanner  the  employers propose to discharge  their\r\n\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While accepting the major premises on which this\r\n\r\nBill  has  been  formulated, I must, nevertheless,\r\n\r\nquestion the need for some of the provisions in it\r\n\r\nand  the  validity  of  the  reasons  advanced  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of these provisions. The most glaring  of\r\n\r\nthe objectionable parts are clauses which seek  to\r\n\r\nreduce  certain  vital  terms  and  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice  to  below the minimum level  set  by  the\r\n\r\nformer colonial administration. This may be deemed\r\n\r\nnecessary    to   attract   foreign    investment,\r\n\r\nespecially from countries with archaic or anarchic\r\n\r\npatterns  of  industrial relations. I  concede  to\r\n\r\nthis.  But  what I do not concede to is  that  the\r\n\r\nBill  in  its present form can achieve the purpose\r\n\r\nfor which it is intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many factors govern a potential investor's\r\n\r\ndecision to come and set up shop in Singapore. One\r\n\r\nof  them  is political stability. Another  is  the\r\n\r\ncost of labour. We must remember that the cost  of\r\n\r\nlabour is not governed solely by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe level of wages and the kind of fringe benefits\r\n\r\ngiven.  It is also measured by efficiency, by  the\r\n\r\nmorale  of the men labouring on the factory floor,\r\n\r\nand  how much effort they are prepared to put into\r\n\r\ntheir work to produce not only in quantity but  in\r\n\r\nquality  as  well.  It is measured  by  individual\r\n\r\nenthusiasm  and it can be lowered by  frustration,\r\n\r\nrestlessness and the governing conviction that the\r\n\r\nworker  is being exploited. Singapore workers  are\r\n\r\nneither  unruly nor pampered. Official  statistics\r\n\r\nshould  prove this. But even if they  were,  would\r\n\r\nyou  attract  investment merely by  offering  such\r\n\r\nlabour on the cheap? Naturally not. But what could\r\n\r\nbe attractive to many businessmen worth their salt\r\n\r\nis labour which is efficient, enthusiastic and, in\r\n\r\nterms  of  wages  and fringe benefits,  reasonably\r\n\r\npriced. For this reason, though I support the move\r\n\r\nto  standardise working conditions for  the  blue-collar  and  white-collar workers at a level  that\r\n\r\nwill  attract new enterprises, I question the need\r\n\r\nto  regard such standardisation as an exercise  to\r\n\r\nset the limit for one and all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing economies it is a fact of life that\r\n\r\nthere are \"rich\" industries and \"poor\" industries.\r\n\r\nLet  us be practical and regard new industries  as\r\n\r\nthe   poor   ones.  That,  of  course,  need   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  be  the  same.  But  the   rich   and\r\n\r\nestablished industries are rich industries.  There\r\n\r\nis  no getting away from that. It is equitable  to\r\n\r\nask  workers  to tighten their belt and  sacrifice\r\n\r\nmerely  to  enhance  the  profit  of  these   rich\r\n\r\nindustries. There would be a rationale  for  doing\r\n\r\nthis  if  there  were  machinery  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nsavings in cost, by reducing benefits for workers,\r\n\r\nwould  be channelled 'directly into expansion  and\r\n\r\ndiversification that would create  more  jobs  for\r\n\r\nlocal  people.  And  I  stress  the  words  \"local\r\n\r\npeople\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other considerations. One, how can\r\n\r\nwe  be  sure that expansion or diversification  is\r\n\r\nnot  already  dictated by natural  growth  in  the\r\n\r\nbusiness, which should rightly be financed by  the\r\n\r\nowners  or  from  company  reserves,  rather  than\r\n\r\nsubsidised further by reductions in the  share  of\r\n\r\nprofit allotted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the workers? Two, how can we be sure that  the\r\n\r\nsavings  in cost from reduction of fringe benefits\r\n\r\nunder the proposed legislation will not be used to\r\n\r\nenhance the terms and conditions of executives who\r\n\r\nare  happily  outside the scope of the  Employment\r\n\r\nBill? There is no such machinery. Perhaps it would\r\n\r\nnot   be  in  the  best  interest  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\ninvestment promotion programme to try  to  set  up\r\n\r\nsuch machinery which might scare some of the weak-hearted among the potential investors. Workers are\r\n\r\nprepared  to make sacrifices for the Republic.  We\r\n\r\ndo   not   expect  foreign  capitalists  to   make\r\n\r\nsacrifices  for  Singapore. They should  come  and\r\n\r\nmake  money and prosper just as we hope  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill prosper along with them. But we do expect our\r\n\r\nParliament and our Government to make every effort\r\n\r\nto  ensure that sacrifices will be called for from\r\n\r\nSingaporeans only where necessary and  that  their\r\n\r\nsacrifices will not be in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this House moves into Committee stage, a\r\n\r\ncolleague   from  the  trade  unions   will   move\r\n\r\namendments   to   the   Employment   Bill.   These\r\n\r\namendments have been framed after most careful and\r\n\r\nheart-searching consideration. We have taken  into\r\n\r\naccount  the overall interest of the Republic  and\r\n\r\nthe  difficult economic challenges facing us  all.\r\n\r\nWe   in   the  trade  unions  have  decided   that\r\n\r\nadjustments  must  be made and that  workers  must\r\n\r\nrise to the occasion. At the same time, we believe\r\n\r\nthat  certain safeguards are fundamental and lines\r\n\r\nmust   be  drawn  to  distinguish  sacrifice  from\r\n\r\nsacrilege.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not here as responsible leaders of a trade\r\n\r\nunion   movement   to   sloganise   against    the\r\n\r\nshortcomings of this Employment Bill. We are  here\r\n\r\nto  point out constructively to the Government how\r\n\r\nit  can better achieve its purpose as outlined  by\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Labour in this House yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for instance, the provision of\r\n\r\nhospitalisation  under  clause  44  of  the  Bill.\r\n\r\nHospitalisation leave, as the Bill  proclaims,  is\r\n\r\nto be limited to 28 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo  matter  how seriously ill a person is  or  how\r\n\r\nseriously injured he may be through any event,  he\r\n\r\nwould  only  be paid for 28 days in the  hospital.\r\n\r\nWould  the  Minister  for  Labour  also  care   to\r\n\r\nlegislate that a broken leg or a broken hand of  a\r\n\r\nworker  must be mended by the doctor  in  28  days\r\n\r\nflat?  If  assurances can be  given  by  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health that his doctors  would  cure\r\n\r\nevery  serious  ailment inside the  period  of  28\r\n\r\ndays, then we, on our part, will willingly concede\r\n\r\nto   have  28  days  as  the  maximum  period  for\r\n\r\nhospitalisation. I do not know  by  what  rule  of\r\n\r\nmedical  science the Minister for Labour has  come\r\n\r\nto the conclusion that miracles can be achieved in\r\n\r\nhospital within 28 days. From the employers' point\r\n\r\nof view, this would be a most desirable feature of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill for the simple reason that after 28 days\r\n\r\nof  hospitalisation, they need no longer pay a man\r\n\r\nhis wages. Assuming that the sole bread-winner  in\r\n\r\na  family  is being hospitalised for two or  three\r\n\r\nmonths,  does the Minister for Labour not  realise\r\n\r\nthat  the man's family would have to queue  up  at\r\n\r\nthe  Social Welfare Department for dole after  the\r\n\r\n28-day period is over? Perhaps the alternative  to\r\n\r\nthis  could be for the hospitalised man to  return\r\n\r\nto his employer, medically half or quarter fit for\r\n\r\nduty.  In what way will this increase productivity\r\n\r\nand  efficiency and be an added incentive for  the\r\n\r\nemployer  is once again a closely guarded  mystery\r\n\r\nthat only the Minister for Labour can reveal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other equally ridiculous provision on which a\r\n\r\nlot  has been said by my colleagues in this  House\r\n\r\nis clause 15 of the Bill. Suffice it for me to say\r\n\r\nthat  the  effect of this clause will be this.  If\r\n\r\nsomeone reaches the age of 55, he will be  put  in\r\n\r\ncold  storage  if  he  is unfortunate  not  to  be\r\n\r\nemployed  by someone else. On the other  hand,  we\r\n\r\nare all bending backwards to improve the skills of\r\n\r\nour  citizens with experience. On the other  hand,\r\n\r\nwe  are advocating a complete wastage of skill  by\r\n\r\nlegislating  against people who are  mentally  and\r\n\r\nphysically fit to work beyond the age of 55.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for instance, the question of annual leave.\r\n\r\nWhilst I welcome the attempt to standardise annual\r\n\r\nleave for industrial and non-industrial workers, I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  the Government must have a  very  good\r\n\r\nreason to divide annual leave into two categories,\r\n\r\nnamely, 7 days for workers with less than 10 years\r\n\r\nof service, and 14 days for workers with more than\r\n\r\n10  years of service, the principle being that  an\r\n\r\nolder worker needs a longer holiday than a younger\r\n\r\nperson setting out on a career. At present, in the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector clerical workers enjoy  an  annual\r\n\r\nleave going up to 21 days per annum. This has been\r\n\r\nthe   result  of  free  negotiations  between  the\r\n\r\nemployers  and  the trade unions.  The  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court  has  in  a  number  of  awards\r\n\r\naccepted this as a pattern and there have been  no\r\n\r\nsignificant complaints from the employers. Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  reason  for  shortening  annual\r\n\r\nleave is to give an incentive to employers. If  it\r\n\r\nis not so, why does the Government not think of  a\r\n\r\nthree-tier system whereby all employees can  enjoy\r\n\r\na maximum of 21 days' annual leave after they have\r\n\r\nput  in,  say, 15 years of service?  I  think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  as  a  large  employer,  has   always\r\n\r\naccepted this principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, there are other provisions in the Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been introduced merely in  the  blind\r\n\r\nhope  that it would serve as an incentive  to  the\r\n\r\nemployers  and not for any well-defined or  cogent\r\n\r\nreasons.  My  other colleagues in the trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement, during the course of the debate on  this\r\n\r\nBill, will touch on the other provisions, such  as\r\n\r\nannual bonuses in the private sector and so on. In\r\n\r\nshort,  far from sloganising on the ills  of  this\r\n\r\nBill,  we  will, when this debate ends,  make  the\r\n\r\nHouse  realise that certain provisions are utterly\r\n\r\nunnecessary  for  the aims and purposes  that  the\r\n\r\nBill proposes to achieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nhad  occasion to warn employers against the misuse\r\n\r\nof  the provisions of this Bill. In fact, he  even\r\n\r\ndrew  their  attention to his ability in  wielding\r\n\r\nthe  stick.  We  in  the  trade  union  world  are\r\n\r\ngrateful to him for this timely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwarning.  But  we  must point  out  that  had  the\r\n\r\nMinister   not  harboured  any  fears   that   the\r\n\r\nemployers would indeed react in a manner different\r\n\r\nfrom  what was really intended, then he would  not\r\n\r\nhave  had  occasion to issue this severe  warning.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, in the knowledge that\r\n\r\nprevention  is  always better than cure,  I  would\r\n\r\nmost  sincerely urge the Government to re-consider\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  harsher  provisions  in  the  Bill,\r\n\r\nparticularly  if these will not serve  the  larger\r\n\r\ninterest of the community at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister also indicated yesterday that\r\n\r\nthe Government will be making amendments to clause\r\n\r\n38  to  ensure that where an employee  working  in\r\n\r\nessential   services  of  the  Government   or   a\r\n\r\nstatutory board is required to work part of a rest\r\n\r\nday, he shall only be entitled to part of a day in\r\n\r\nsubstitution. Sir, we agree that work essential to\r\n\r\nthe  community must be carried on every day of the\r\n\r\nweek. But we must point out that if an employee is\r\n\r\ncalled upon to work on part of his rest day,  then\r\n\r\nhis rest day or holiday is completely spoiled.  If\r\n\r\nthis  amendment is proposed, the trade unions will\r\n\r\nrequest  that if an employee is asked to  work  on\r\n\r\npart  of his rest day, he should be entitled to  a\r\n\r\ncomplete  day  off in lieu. We are confident  that\r\n\r\nthe Government will be magnanimous enough to grant\r\n\r\nthis request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Bill has no doubt placed\r\n\r\nrestrictions on trade union practices in obtaining\r\n\r\nfringe  benefits,  but the  trade  unions  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector are free to enter into negotiations\r\n\r\nwith  the  employers for better  wages.  But  what\r\n\r\nabout  the employees in the public sector? In  the\r\n\r\npast  few years, every claim of the civil  service\r\n\r\nfor  wage  adjustments or removal of anomalies  in\r\n\r\nthe salary structure of the civil service has been\r\n\r\nbrushed aside and the civil service has been  told\r\n\r\nto  wait  for the findings of the Harvey  Salaries\r\n\r\nCommission. The Commission's recommendations  have\r\n\r\nbeen in the hands of the Government for some time.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  the  intention of  the  Government  with\r\n\r\nreference   to   the  recommendations?   Are   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations going to cold storage, or is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  going  to  accept  them?  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister concerned will make a statement  on  this\r\n\r\nduring  the  course of this debate.  We  from  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  vote  for the  Bill  but  with  the\r\n\r\namendments  we propose, and I am sure  this  House\r\n\r\nwill  not  fail  to  note  that  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement has responded positively to the call  for\r\n\r\nsacrifice. All we ask in return is that this House\r\n\r\nand  the  Government think again on  some  of  the\r\n\r\nobjectionable  provisions  so  that  this  Act  of\r\n\r\nParliament  will be a law based  not  on  a  panic\r\n\r\ndecision  but on a rational analysis  of  what  is\r\n\r\nbest for Singapore at this particular time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.54 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nposterity  will  either look upon this  Employment\r\n\r\nBill as the Magna Carta of industrial Singapore or\r\n\r\nit  will simply dismiss it as an Act full of sound\r\n\r\nand fury, signifying nothing. My only hope is that\r\n\r\nposterity will not also add that it was a  classic\r\n\r\nexample  of  men  who  did  not  understand  their\r\n\r\nfellowmen. Sir, we are dealing with human  beings,\r\n\r\nnot   mere   figures,  and   it   is   upon   this\r\n\r\nunderstanding, or the lack of it, that the success\r\n\r\nor failure of this Bill would very much depend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, first, let me hasten to add that I support\r\n\r\nthe  proposition  that the  Bill  is  a  necessary\r\n\r\nalternative  to  what really amounts  to  national\r\n\r\nsuicide,  for  it is clear to all of  us  that  we\r\n\r\ncannot maintain the status quo any longer. And the\r\n\r\nstatus  quo by any standard, whether in developing\r\n\r\nor  developed  economies, is  grim,  a  continuing\r\n\r\nunemployment  problem  in an expanding  population\r\n\r\nand  an  inadequate  rate  of  growth  of  foreign\r\n\r\nmarkets for our manufactured goods; a loss  of  15\r\n\r\nper  cent of the Gross National Product after  the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  of the British troops, and  an  almost\r\n\r\ninsatiable  need  for new investments.  These  are\r\n\r\nformidable problems of this island Republic devoid\r\n\r\nof  the economic buffers of a big nation with land\r\n\r\nand natural resources. To keep the status quo without\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nredoubling  our efforts  would  result  in  a\r\n\r\nsituation  very similar to the one which prevailed\r\n\r\nin  the mid l950s. For it must mean that if  every\r\n\r\nother  person  in  the street is  unemployed  and,\r\n\r\nworse  still, because of our education  policy  an\r\n\r\neducated   unemployed,  then  social  unrest   and\r\n\r\ndiscontent  would increase. In such  a  situation,\r\n\r\nthere  is no doubt as to how far and how well  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  could capitalise. Only  this  time  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  greatly  different. There  will  be  no\r\n\r\nBritish  air  power or sea power to  deter  anyone\r\n\r\ninclined  to fish in troubled waters. This  could,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  mean our second phase of  colonisation\r\n\r\nor  our  last  experience of peace, stability  and\r\n\r\nrelative  plenty. It is in this context  that  the\r\n\r\nlong-term view of this Bill should be tested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to set above all other things a\r\n\r\nnew  order, a new pattern of relationships between\r\n\r\nGovernment, labour and management for the  future.\r\n\r\nIts  over-riding intention is the  eradication  of\r\n\r\nweaknesses and abuses in the present system of our\r\n\r\nlabour  relations. Let those who are now fortunate\r\n\r\nto  be  in employment remember that without  sound\r\n\r\nlabour and economic conditions, their own jobs are\r\n\r\ninsecure. Let those who are union members remember\r\n\r\nthat  they  form  but a minority of  workers.  Let\r\n\r\neverybody  remember  that widespread  unemployment\r\n\r\njeopardises  not only law and order but  the  very\r\n\r\nsocial order for which so many have worked so long\r\n\r\nand so hard. This Bill will also create employment\r\n\r\nopportunities, increase productivity  and  attract\r\n\r\ninvestment.   These   are   all   very   desirable\r\n\r\nobjectives which must find full support  not  only\r\n\r\nfrom  this  House but also from all citizens.  But\r\n\r\ngood intentions alone are not good enough. We  are\r\n\r\ndealing   with  the  mechanics  of  a  law   which\r\n\r\npurportedly  embraces these good  intentions.  The\r\n\r\nmechanics,  therefore,  must  stand  the   closest\r\n\r\nscrutiny to bear evidence that the good intentions\r\n\r\nwould in fact be applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now touch on certain clauses of the\r\n\r\nBill? In clause 15, from the employers' angle, the\r\n\r\nmisgiving on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  provision is that it is too wide. It  covers\r\n\r\neverybody  employed  in  Singapore,  as  the  word\r\n\r\n\"person\"  is  used  in  this  clause  instead   of\r\n\r\n\"employee\". This will cover any person from a peon\r\n\r\nto  a  managing  director. If this clause  is  not\r\n\r\namended and if it is applied rigidly, then instead\r\n\r\nof  increasing  productivity,  we  may  create   a\r\n\r\nreverse effect. For example, we are still short of\r\n\r\nvery  skilled  personnel for  our  industries.  We\r\n\r\ncannot afford at this juncture to retire them  off\r\n\r\nwhen they are still fit to work after 55 years  of\r\n\r\nage.  The concept behind this provision is a sound\r\n\r\none,  as  the object is to get rid of unproductive\r\n\r\npersons   and  those  in  \"soft\"  jobs.  In   many\r\n\r\ncollective  agreements, there are  provisions  for\r\n\r\nretirement  at  55. But there are also  provisions\r\n\r\nfor  retirement benefits to be given. However,  in\r\n\r\nthe  very  large  majority  of  small  businesses,\r\n\r\nespecially the family type businesses,  there  are\r\n\r\nno such provisions. An old employee may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  related  to  the employer and  most  of  these\r\n\r\npeople,  as in the small Chinese businesses,  live\r\n\r\non the premises. If such people were to be retired\r\n\r\nat  the age of 55, they would have no place to go,\r\n\r\nlet alone the means to earn a livelihood. To allay\r\n\r\nthe  fears of uncertainty and insecurity among our\r\n\r\nolder workers, this clause must be removed. In any\r\n\r\ncase,  any  sensible employer will not  employ  an\r\n\r\ninefficient and unproductive worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.
