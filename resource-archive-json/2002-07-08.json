For\r\n\r\nexample, customers should install firewall and anti-virus\r\n\r\nsoftware on their PCs to block out hackers, and  log  off\r\n\r\ntheir computers when not in use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the recent hacking incident, which\r\n\r\naffected a number of DBS customers, the Police are  still\r\n\r\ncarrying out their investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to DBS, which has been conducting its own\r\n\r\ninternal investigation, its findings were that the bank's\r\n\r\nown  Internet system had not been hacked, but it was  the\r\n\r\ncustomers'  PCs which had been hacked.  By accessing  the\r\n\r\ncustomers'  PCs, the hacker(s) had been able  to  capture\r\n\r\nthe  PINs and IDs of these customers.  The hacker(s) then\r\n\r\nused  the  captured customer information to access  their\r\n\r\naccounts to make fraudulent withdrawal transfers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police and DBS have advised the public on\r\n\r\ncertain  precautionary measures to take and good security\r\n\r\npractices to adopt when conducting on-line banking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penalties for hacking into bank systems are already\r\n\r\nprescribed  in the Computer Misuse Act.

They fear that commercial banks,  with  the\r\n\r\nhelp   of  the  bureau,  will  have  access  to  client's\r\n\r\ninformation  about the state of his or her finances  that\r\n\r\nthey  were  not  privy to before.  These  are  reasonable\r\n\r\nconcerns and deserve to be addressed squarely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banking Act provides the legal framework on the\r\n\r\nuse of customer information.  This provision is found  in\r\n\r\nparagraph  7 of Part II of the Sixth Schedule. Banks  are\r\n\r\nonly permitted to disclose credit-related information  to\r\n\r\nthe  recognised  credit bureau such as personal  details,\r\n\r\nthe   type  and  number  of  credit  facilities  granted,\r\n\r\nrepayment trends and bankruptcy records.  Banks  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to disclose deposit information.  This  includes\r\n\r\nany   funds,   safe   deposit  boxes  or   safe   custody\r\n\r\narrangements of a customer under management  by  a  bank.\r\n\r\nThis  is  an important distinction between credit-related\r\n\r\ninformation  and deposit information.  The credit  bureau\r\n\r\nand other MAS approved institutions participating in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbureau  will  only  have access to  a  customer's  credit\r\n\r\nhistory.   The  purpose for such access is restricted  to\r\n\r\nthe  assessment  of credit-worthiness of  customers,  and\r\n\r\nfurther disclosure to any other person is prohibited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, a credit bureau that the banks want to\r\n\r\nuse  must  demonstrate its ability to  address  financial\r\n\r\nprivacy  concerns competently, and to discharge its  role\r\n\r\neffectively in providing accurate reports.  MAS will only\r\n\r\nrecognise and gazette the credit bureau when the concerns\r\n\r\nare  adequately  addressed, possibly in  the  form  of  a\r\n\r\nwritten code of conduct for the bureau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a credit bureau fail to maintain the high\r\n\r\nstandards expected of it, MAS will not hesitate to cancel\r\n\r\nits  recognition  of the bureau. Once  this  happens,  it\r\n\r\nbecomes illegal for banks to provide customer information\r\n\r\nto the credit bureau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS recognises that the Consumer Credit Bureau has\r\n\r\nan  important  role  to play in the  financial  industry.\r\n\r\nWith  the establishment of a credit bureau, members  will\r\n\r\nhave  more information to anticipate potential  bad  debt\r\n\r\nsituations before they occur. They will be able to better\r\n\r\nmanage  their  overall level of bad debts.  Studies  have\r\n\r\nalso  shown  that credit bureaus in other countries  have\r\n\r\nenabled   credit   providers  to  differentiate   between\r\n\r\ncustomers, and manage and price them accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

In  response\r\n\r\nto SFCCI's recommendation and after many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonths  of  consultation with members of  the  local  and\r\n\r\ninternational   business  community  in  Singapore,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  introduced the Singapore Business  Federation\r\n\r\nBill,  providing for mandatory membership of the  SBF  of\r\n\r\nall  local  companies  with a  paid-up  capital  of  $0.5\r\n\r\nmillion   and  above,  and  foreign  companies  with   an\r\n\r\nauthorised capital of $0.5 million and above.   The  Bill\r\n\r\nwas  passed by this House in October last year,  and  the\r\n\r\nSBF was formed in April this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I explained to this House last year during the\r\n\r\ndebate   on  the  SBF  Bill  that  we  supported  SFCCI's\r\n\r\nrecommendation  that  membership of  the  SBF  should  be\r\n\r\nmandatory as the earlier practice of voluntary membership\r\n\r\nby  business  chambers  and  associations  had  not  been\r\n\r\neffective.    The   business   community   had   remained\r\n\r\nfragmented despite our best efforts, and lacked a  strong\r\n\r\nand   united   private   sector  umbrella   organisation.\r\n\r\nCompulsory  membership would ensure that the  SBF  has  a\r\n\r\nstrong membership base, and has the mandate of the entire\r\n\r\nbusiness community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory membership of business chambers can also\r\n\r\nbe  found  in  other countries.  In France,  Germany  and\r\n\r\nBrazil,   for   example,  chambers   of   commerce   have\r\n\r\nlegislative  rights to collect fees from businesses.   To\r\n\r\nensure  that this requirement will not be unduly  onerous\r\n\r\non  our  companies,  we  have exempted  small  companies,\r\n\r\npartnerships and sole proprietorships from having to join\r\n\r\nand  contribute to the SBF.  Hence, only local  companies\r\n\r\nwith   paid-up   capital  and  foreign   companies   with\r\n\r\nauthorised capital of $0.5 million and above are required\r\n\r\nto be members of the SBF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use paid-up capital because it is a simple\r\n\r\ncriterion  and  generally  correlated  with  size.   MTI,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  the pro-tem committee  of  the  SBF,  did\r\n\r\nconsider   other  criteria  like  profitability,   annual\r\n\r\nturnover  and employment size, but came to the conclusion\r\n\r\nthat,  whatever  criterion or set of  criteria  we  used,\r\n\r\nthere  would be difficulties wherever the line was drawn.\r\n\r\nIn the end, we decided on paid-up capital\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas   the   simplest  and  least  contentious   criterion.\r\n\r\nRecognising,  however,  that exemptions  may  be  clearly\r\n\r\njustified  based on this criterion, the Act  enables  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to allow them.

With effect  from\r\n\r\n2003,  SAT  I  will  account for 25%  of  the  university\r\n\r\nadmission    criteria   for   students   with   `A'-level\r\n\r\nqualifications.    `A'-level   results   constitute   the\r\n\r\nremaining   75%.    Co-curricular  activities   will   be\r\n\r\nallocated  up to 5% as bonus points.  From 2005,  project\r\n\r\nwork will account for 10%, reducing the weightage of  the\r\n\r\n`A'- level results to 65%.  SAT I will remain at 25%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the minimum criteria for admission to NUS or\r\n\r\nNTU,  `A'-level students must have passes in at  least  2\r\n\r\nsubjects  at `A'-level, have taken the General  Paper  at\r\n\r\nthe  same sitting, have taken a Mother Tongue paper,  and\r\n\r\nhave  taken  SAT  I.  Of course, these  are  the  minimum\r\n\r\ncriteria.   Admission,  of course,  is  based  on  merit.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  whether  an  applicant  is  successful  in  a\r\n\r\nparticular\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse  will  depend  on his or her results  relative  to\r\n\r\nother  applicants  for  the  places  available  on   that\r\n\r\nparticular course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee recommended that a reasoning test be\r\n\r\nincluded  as  one component of the admission criteria  to\r\n\r\ncomplement   the  content-based  `A'-level  examinations.\r\n\r\nSuch  a  test  will enable the universities to  assess  a\r\n\r\ncandidate's  analytical skills, as well as his  potential\r\n\r\nand  ability to deal with generic and new problems.   The\r\n\r\nSAT  I  was  chosen  as  it  is  a  well-established  and\r\n\r\ninternationally recognised reasoning test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question that Mdm Ho raised is with regard\r\n\r\nto  the  proposal  last  year by  the  President  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of California to do away with the SAT I as its\r\n\r\nadmission  criteria.   This  has  been  well  publicised.\r\n\r\nDespite  this, it would be an overstatement to  say  that\r\n\r\n\"several  prominent American universities are doing  away\r\n\r\nwith  the  SAT I\".  Indeed, according to the  US  College\r\n\r\nBoard,  about  80% of the US's 1,800 4-year  universities\r\n\r\nare currently using SAT I scores in their admissions, and\r\n\r\nthese universities include prominent institutions such as\r\n\r\nHarvard, Stanford and Yale.  They find the SAT I a useful\r\n\r\nstandardised means of measuring the applicant's readiness\r\n\r\nto undertake the university course of study.  And this is\r\n\r\nparticularly so in the United States where  they  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  any  standardised examinations at the  high  school\r\n\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been a number of suggested reasons as to\r\n\r\nwhy the University of California has proposed to drop the\r\n\r\nSAT  I.  According to the President of the University  of\r\n\r\nCalifornia, it was because the SAT I by itself  does  not\r\n\r\npredict  college achievement well.  The UK magazine,  The\r\n\r\nEconomist,  in commenting on the SAT and the decision  of\r\n\r\nthe  University of California, suggested that the problem\r\n\r\nmight  not have been with the reliability or accuracy  of\r\n\r\nthe  test, but that for political or social reasons,  the\r\n\r\nUniversity wanted a different mix of students  than  what\r\n\r\nwould  have resulted from using the SAT I.  If  so,  such\r\n\r\nreasons are not relevant in our context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our assessment is that the current SAT I is a\r\n\r\nsuitable reasoning test for our purposes.  We use  SAT  I\r\n\r\nas   a   complement   to   the  content-based   `A'-level\r\n\r\nexaminations.   Furthermore,  our  universities   receive\r\n\r\napplications from those with other qualifications, eg, we\r\n\r\nhave   polytechnic  diploma  candidates,  and   we   have\r\n\r\ncandidates   with  foreign  high  school  qualifications.\r\n\r\nBroadening  the basket of admission criteria  allows  the\r\n\r\nuniversities to gain a fuller picture of the student, and\r\n\r\ngives  students more opportunities to exhibit their range\r\n\r\nof talents and potential for university education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US College Board recently announced a number of\r\n\r\nchanges  to  SAT  I, to be implemented  from  2005.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education  and  our  universities  will  be\r\n\r\nreviewing  the  implications  of  these  changes  on  our\r\n\r\nuniversity admission criteria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask the Minister whether it is true  that  some\r\n\r\nelements  of  the SAT are coachable; in other  words  the\r\n\r\nkids  can be drilled to sit for it.  If this is so, would\r\n\r\nthe usage of the SAT for admission criteria to university\r\n\r\nencourage  the kind of attributes that we are  trying  to\r\n\r\nmove  our kids away from, which is learning by rote,  and\r\n\r\ntaking  away  what we wanted out of SAT,  which  is  pure\r\n\r\nreasoning skills?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, some practice with the SAT\r\n\r\nI  tests  will be useful for students because  they  will\r\n\r\nacquire  certain  familiarities with the  rubric  of  the\r\n\r\nexamination  paper and the types of questions  that  come\r\n\r\nup.  But the content level of these papers is about where\r\n\r\nour  students would be if they had completed  their  `O'-level  English and Mathematics.  So, any further  efforts\r\n\r\nrequired  will really not be necessary, because  if  they\r\n\r\nhave  got their `O'-level Mathematics and Language,  that\r\n\r\nshould really be sufficient as content material for  them\r\n\r\nto  take the SAT I, and, after that, it is really a  test\r\n\r\nof their reasoning and critical thinking abilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EMPLOYMENT SITUATION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Update)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Gan Kim Yong</b> asked the Minister for Manpower\r\n\r\nif he will provide an update on the employment situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen) (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\nline  with  the improvement in the economy,  retrenchment\r\n\r\nmoderated in the first quarter of 2002.  A total of 4,857\r\n\r\nworkers were laid off during this period.  This level was\r\n\r\nclose to half that in each of the preceding two quarters.\r\n\r\nHowever,  job  creation  continues  to  be  weak.   Total\r\n\r\nemployment  has  declined by about 14,000  in  the  first\r\n\r\nquarter  this year for the third successive  quarter,  as\r\n\r\nthe  lagged  effects of the economic downturn  last  year\r\n\r\ncontinued to affect demand for manpower. The losses  were\r\n\r\nconcentrated  in  the construction sector,  about  10,000\r\n\r\njobs,  due  to  persistent declines in both  private  and\r\n\r\npublic  building  activities.   Manufacturing  employment\r\n\r\nfell  by  about 2,000, less sharply than in the preceding\r\n\r\nthree  quarters, owing to some recovery in  manufacturing\r\n\r\nactivities.    Services   producing    industries    also\r\n\r\nexperienced cut-backs in employment, about 2,000 jobs, in\r\n\r\nthe quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, the seasonally adjusted overall\r\n\r\nunemployment  has reached a high of 4.5%  in  March  this\r\n\r\nyear.   The  rate is expected to rise to about 5-5.5%  in\r\n\r\nthe  later half of this year, as there is usually  a  lag\r\n\r\nbetween the economic recovery and employment growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If recovery continues, we can expect more creation\r\n\r\nof  new  jobs particularly in favour of those with higher\r\n\r\nskills and knowledge.

We will have to  bear\r\n\r\nin  mind, as I said in my main answer, CPF members depend\r\n\r\nupon  timely  crediting of their CPF  contributions  into\r\n\r\ntheir  accounts  so  that  they can  meet  their  housing\r\n\r\nmortgage repayments.  They may have to pay hospital bills\r\n\r\nfor themselves or for their dependants.  They may have to\r\n\r\nwithdraw money to pay for their children's education,  if\r\n\r\nthey  have  taken out a loan against their CPF under  the\r\n\r\nEducation Scheme.  So, if we allow employers to delay the\r\n\r\npayment  and  if  we do not have any measures  that  will\r\n\r\nencourage,  and, in fact, compel employers to meet  their\r\n\r\nstatutory  obligations  on time,  we  will  end  up  with\r\n\r\nquestions in Parliament by other Members asking why is it\r\n\r\nthat the Board is not recovering or helping employees  to\r\n\r\nhave  their CPF credited on time.  And, we will  have  to\r\n\r\nanswer those other questions instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to have a balanced policy. Where we can,\r\n\r\nif  there  are  really  genuine reasons,  the  Board  can\r\n\r\nconsider  giving  some extension/grace period.   But  the\r\n\r\nBoard cannot say it will not impose penalties or it  will\r\n\r\njust  overlook late payments and allow employers  to  get\r\n\r\noff  scot-free,  because if we adopt that  approach  then\r\n\r\nmany  more employers may choose not to pay their  CPF  on\r\n\r\ntime  and  then we can run into hundreds of thousands  of\r\n\r\nworkers, CPF members, having difficulties.

Now that  there\r\n\r\nis  a  demand for 3-room flats - I am not denying that  - there  is  a way for us to satisfy that demand in  a  way\r\n\r\nwhich is most sensible for the total housing market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Is the Minister saying that if\r\n\r\nthe HDB is going to build 3-room flats, the selling price\r\n\r\nwill  be  the same or higher than the current  discounted\r\n\r\nprice  that the HDB bought the flat from the open  market\r\n\r\nfor sale to applicants?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, HDB does not build new 3-room\r\n\r\nflats.

At the end of  the\r\n\r\nday,  HDB  buys them back and rents them to  Jurong  Town\r\n\r\nCorporation  (JTC),  and  JTC, in  turn,  rents  them  to\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.   My  residents  have  complained  that\r\n\r\nsometimes  there were so many foreign workers staying  in\r\n\r\ntheir  block.  All these were unsold 3-room flats.  Could\r\n\r\ncertain regulations be imposed on 3-room flats rented  to\r\n\r\nJTC?   We  should  not rent all these  flats  to  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.   Maybe we could rent these flats to  those  who\r\n\r\nreally need 3-room flats at a further discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I think the Member is referring to\r\n\r\nthe SHIFT programme, which is administered by Jurong Town\r\n\r\nCorporation.

When   the\r\n\r\nsurface  concrete is carbonated, corrosion of  the  steel\r\n\r\nbars within the slab sets in. The corroded steel expands,\r\n\r\nthus  causing the concrete surrounding the steel bars  to\r\n\r\ncrack.   This  problem may affect flat  owners  as  their\r\n\r\nflats become older.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Lease agreement, HDB flat owners are\r\n\r\nresponsible for the repair of spalling concrete in  their\r\n\r\nflats.   HDB flat owners who encounter spalling  concrete\r\n\r\nproblems  in  their flats can, however,  report  them  to\r\n\r\ntheir respective HDB Branch Offices.  HDB can assist  the\r\n\r\nflat  owners  to  investigate the problem  and  recommend\r\n\r\nappropriate  remedial action.  For flat owners  who  have\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in finding a suitable repair contractor  on\r\n\r\ntheir  own,  HDB can also assist to provide them  with  a\r\n\r\nlist  of repair contractors, whom they can negotiate with\r\n\r\non a strictly private basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, may I\r\n\r\nask  the  Senior Parliamentary Secretary, when  does  HDB\r\n\r\nexpect a new flat to have spalling concrete problem?

So,  if  the flat is within the  one-year  old\r\n\r\nperiod,  then the spalling concrete, if it occurs,  would\r\n\r\nbe a workmanship problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> I would like a\r\n\r\nclarification  from  the Senior Parliamentary  Secretary.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  for  flats that are above 20 years  old,  ie,\r\n\r\nthose  built in the early 1980s, there are about  450,000\r\n\r\nflats, and there was a scheme of three\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears,  and  only about 2%, ie, 17,000 flats  were  given\r\n\r\nassistance.   In 1987, there was a change in the  quality\r\n\r\nof  concrete,  from 20 to 30.  And because  of  that,  we\r\n\r\nnotice  that  there  is a difference  in  the  degree  of\r\n\r\nspalling  concrete in the newer flats,  but  not  in  the\r\n\r\nolder  flats.  So, I would like to appeal to the Ministry\r\n\r\nto  consider helping those flats that are above 20  years\r\n\r\nold in the IUP or the MUP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first\r\n\r\nof  all,  under  the MUP programme, HDB repairs  spalling\r\n\r\nconcrete  defects  on a goodwill basis,  for  the  simple\r\n\r\nreason  that these flats would be very old.  In order  to\r\n\r\nqualify  for MUP, the flats would be way above  10  years\r\n\r\nold.  Spalling concrete is a problem of an aging process.\r\n\r\nFlats  need maintenance.  As flats age, problems set  in.\r\n\r\nSo spalling concrete is a maintenance problem.  It is not\r\n\r\na  design  or workmanship problem.  New flats have  fewer\r\n\r\nproblems.  That is the reason why the Member pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat  flats  built after 1990s, for example,  have  fewer\r\n\r\nproblems  because they are young.  When we are young,  we\r\n\r\nhave  no  problems.  We have no arthritis, or rheumatism.\r\n\r\nAs  we  grow  older, problems set in.  So we will  see  a\r\n\r\nspecialist or a doctor.  It is not true that flats  built\r\n\r\nin  the  early  80s  have  a high incidence  of  spalling\r\n\r\nconcrete.   They  have high incidence  because  they  are\r\n\r\nolder.   You  ask  any  doctor, he will  say  that  older\r\n\r\npatients have more problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB conducted two goodwill repairs over two periods.\r\n\r\nIn  1988,  HDB conducted a goodwill repair, and  repaired\r\n\r\nflats  with spalling concrete defects.  75,000 households\r\n\r\nbenefited  from  that goodwill repair  and  it  cost  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  $30 million - big money in those days.   Then\r\n\r\nin  1995  to 1998, HDB conducted another goodwill  repair\r\n\r\nscheme  for  something like 27,000 households.   So  with\r\n\r\nthese  two  goodwill repair schemes completed, HDB  feels\r\n\r\nthat there are very few spalling concrete defects left in\r\n\r\nthe  flats.  Those that come on-stream now would be taken\r\n\r\ncare of during the MUP programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> May I ask the Senior Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary,  based on natural deterioration  of  concrete,\r\n\r\nwhich he mentioned as carbonation, how many years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoes  he  think  a  new flat built by  HDB  will  have  a\r\n\r\nspalling  concrete  problem?  My  understanding  is  that\r\n\r\nconcrete,  if  properly constructed, can last  60  years.\r\n\r\nMaybe he can let us know how long it can last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nconcrete,  if well maintained, can last for a long  time,\r\n\r\nlonger  than 60 years.  But during the durability period,\r\n\r\nthere will be minor repairs here and there.  The spalling\r\n\r\nconcrete  needs  routine maintenance, which  we  need  to\r\n\r\ncater for flats which are way above 10 years old.  So  in\r\n\r\nour environment which is high in moisture, and in certain\r\n\r\nplaces which is high in carbon dioxide, carbonation takes\r\n\r\nplace faster.  For example, in the kitchen area which  is\r\n\r\nheavily used for cooking, then we will find that spalling\r\n\r\nconcrete may occur faster than in the living room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like the\r\n\r\nSenior Parliamentary Secretary to give us some statistics\r\n\r\nto  show that spalling concrete only happens in the older\r\n\r\nflats  and not the newer flats, especially in 1987,  when\r\n\r\nthere was a change in the grade of concrete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc.

For flats built before 1983,  flats\r\n\r\nwhich  are  about  18 years old, the number  of  spalling\r\n\r\nconcrete  defects is 39.3 per thousand  households.   For\r\n\r\nflats  built between 1983-1986, the number of defects  is\r\n\r\n25.9  per  thousand households.  For flats built  between\r\n\r\n1987-1990, the number of defects is very low, ie, 1.8 per\r\n\r\nthousand households because they are very young.  And for\r\n\r\nvery  new  flats built between 1991-2002, the defects  of\r\n\r\ncourse   is   miniscule,  1.5  incidents   per   thousand\r\n\r\nhouseholds.   So Members can see that the correlation  is\r\n\r\nvery  simple.   When the flats are young, there  are  few\r\n\r\nproblems.  When they are old, there are lots of problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> May I clarify with the Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary?

It  is   the   design,\r\n\r\nconstruction  and  maintenance  that  will   affect   the\r\n\r\ndurability of the concrete structure.  So, the design and\r\n\r\nconstruction are important.  We have many new flats built\r\n\r\nin  the  1990s  using grade concrete,  and  yet  we  have\r\n\r\nspalling concrete problems.  Does it mean that the HDB is\r\n\r\ngoing to repair all these spalling concrete problems  for\r\n\r\nflats built in the 90s?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> For these cases, perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Member  would  like to highlight  to  the  Ministry.\r\n\r\nBasically, spalling concrete happens within the flat, and\r\n\r\nit is outside the purview of the town council.  I am sure\r\n\r\nall  town  councils  in Singapore maintain  their  common\r\n\r\nproperty very well.  The spalling concrete is an internal\r\n\r\nmatter.   It is between the flat owner and his  property.\r\n\r\nA  simple maintenance like repainting, for example,  will\r\n\r\nprevent  carbon dioxide from penetrating the outer  layer\r\n\r\nof the concrete, thereby corroding the steel bars.  As  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  if the flat is within one year old, we are obliged\r\n\r\nto  repair.   If it is outside one year, we will  take  a\r\n\r\nlook,  but the flat owner must repair.  Spalling concrete\r\n\r\nis  a  slow  process.   It  is easily  detected.   It  is\r\n\r\ninexpensively  repaired.  One can do it  himself  if  the\r\n\r\nrepair area is small, meaning 1.5 square metres.   If  it\r\n\r\nis  larger, he can always contact a contractor.  HDB has,\r\n\r\nthrough the two goodwill programmes, trained hundreds  of\r\n\r\ncontractors  who are competent in repairing the  spalling\r\n\r\nconcrete.  And the cost is very cheap, ranging  from  $50\r\n\r\nto a few hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder\r\n\r\nwhether   the   Senior   Parliamentary   Secretary    has\r\n\r\nstatistical data on spalling concrete, so as  to  compare\r\n\r\nthe older Tiong Bahru estate at Seng Poh Road area, built\r\n\r\nbefore the HDB, with flats that were built\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the 80s.

Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I think I am\r\n\r\nqualified to speak about the conditions of flats in Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru,  being  the  MP for the last 10  years.   Spalling\r\n\r\nconcrete does occur in Tiong Bahru flats, like all flats.\r\n\r\nIn  all concrete buildings, spalling concrete will occur.\r\n\r\nIt  is a matter of when.  If the flat is maintained well,\r\n\r\nspalling concrete appears much later down the road.   The\r\n\r\ndesign  of  the flat, as well as the grade  of  concrete,\r\n\r\ndoes affect the occurrence of spalling concrete.  At  any\r\n\r\none  time, HDB flats are designed according to the latest\r\n\r\nbuilding  codes.   So  there is no  question  of  cutting\r\n\r\ncorners in the construction of the HDB flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> The Senior Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary stated that it is the owner's responsibility to\r\n\r\nmaintain  and  repair  spalling concrete.   But  spalling\r\n\r\nconcrete  always happens at the slab that is between  two\r\n\r\nflat  units.  And the leakage of the moisture  is  always\r\n\r\nfrom  the upper unit going down to the slab and into  the\r\n\r\nlower  unit itself.  In such a case, it is difficult  for\r\n\r\nthe owner of the lower flat to maintain that slab that is\r\n\r\naffecting  the  owner  below.   So  would  the   Ministry\r\n\r\nconsider  helping  the owner in the  repair  of  spalling\r\n\r\nconcrete?   I  would like to appeal to  the  Ministry  to\r\n\r\nseriously look into this under the IUP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc.

If it  is\r\n\r\na  case  of pure spalling concrete, then it is simple  to\r\n\r\nrepair, because the owner has absolute control\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover his ceiling.  He does not need to interfere with the\r\n\r\nneighbour  upstairs.   If  it is  a  case  of  a  ceiling\r\n\r\nleakage,  ie, water seeping through the toilet,  then  it\r\n\r\nneeds  the  cooperation of two parties - the upper  floor\r\n\r\nneighbour  and  the lower floor neighbour.   The  law  is\r\n\r\nquite   clear   that   both  parties   must   share   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  Sometimes, both parties cannot  come  to\r\n\r\nan  agreement, either because of the timing or the nature\r\n\r\nof  the repair, in which case HDB will step in and be the\r\n\r\nexpert counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, the Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary has put the blame of  maintenance\r\n\r\non  the real cost of spalling concrete.

Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> The simplest form of\r\n\r\nmaintenance is to repaint the ceiling of the flat, as and\r\n\r\nwhen is required.  If we use good water-proof paint,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  then  it should last between 5-7  years.   Some\r\n\r\npaints  are  moisture  resistant.  So,  by  painting  the\r\n\r\nceiling of the flat, it will prevent carbon dioxide  from\r\n\r\npenetrating  the  surface of the  concrete.   The  carbon\r\n\r\ndioxide  reacts with the alkaline on the steel  bars  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  reduces  the rust-proof nature  of  the  steel\r\n\r\nbars.

The first issue is: what is the  cause  of\r\n\r\nthe  spalling  concrete?  If the cause  of  the  spalling\r\n\r\nconcrete  is  due to the design, as some Members  allege,\r\n\r\nand  it can be proven as such, then obviously it is HDB's\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to fix it, either in  the  flat  that  is\r\n\r\ncurrently affected by spalling concrete or to fix  it  in\r\n\r\nfuture designs.  But if it is a matter of deterioration - natural   wear   and   tear  -   then,   obviously,   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility lies with the owner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if any Member of the House here feels that\r\n\r\nflats  in  his  constituency or estate  are  affected  by\r\n\r\nspalling  concrete  due  to design  or  poor  workmanship\r\n\r\nproblems, then, by all means, please take it up with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry and, if we can establish the cause, we will take\r\n\r\nthe  necessary measures.  There is no point in trying  to\r\n\r\nlump the two issues into one because, obviously, there is\r\n\r\na limit to the kind of maintenance that HDB can carry out\r\n\r\nin  the  flats.  HDB flats are 10, 15, 20, 30 years  old.\r\n\r\nWear  and  tear takes place, and some of the repairs  and\r\n\r\nmaintenance  must be undertaken by the owners themselves.\r\n\r\nThis  is  perfectly normal.  If the wear and  tear  takes\r\n\r\nplace  after 10-15 years, to expect the HDB to  undertake\r\n\r\nrepairs is obviously not fair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, of course, we spend a\r\n\r\nconsiderable amount of money going back to the flats  for\r\n\r\ninterim  upgrading, main upgrading, goodwill repairs  and\r\n\r\nso on and so forth.

They are thus required to pay about $25,000  per\r\n\r\nflat  for the conversion of their flat leases into strata\r\n\r\ntitles.  Most of this cost - about $20,000 per flat -  is\r\n\r\nthe cost of purchasing the common property from HDB.  The\r\n\r\nresidents have to pay this sum because they did  not  pay\r\n\r\nfor  this common property, such as the car parks, at  the\r\n\r\npoint  of  original  purchase.  The cost  of  the  common\r\n\r\nproperty is computed taking into account the net car park\r\n\r\nincome  forgone for the remaining period  of  the  lease.\r\n\r\nThe  remaining $5,000 comprises costs incurred by HDB for\r\n\r\nsurvey  fees, legal fees and construction works necessary\r\n\r\nto  comply  with  statutory building  control  and  other\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, for lessees in HUDC estates in\r\n\r\nPhases  I  &  II, these are governed by the HUDC  Housing\r\n\r\nEstates Act.

Can I ask  the  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of State what is the response of the  US  State\r\n\r\nDepartment or the US Embassy to the disagreement that  we\r\n\r\nhave lodged with them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

For example, when we received  last\r\n\r\nyear's  report,  we  corresponded  with  the  US  Embassy\r\n\r\nsetting  out the inaccuracies, eg, for stating  Singapore\r\n\r\nto  be a destination country for trafficking of women for\r\n\r\nsexual exploitation.  We said that this was not so.   But\r\n\r\nthis  inaccuracy  was  again  reflected  in  this  year's\r\n\r\nreport.   So  it is a matter of continuing dialogue.   We\r\n\r\nwill  continue to point out these inaccuracies to the  US\r\n\r\nEmbassy and, over time, to convince them that we are  not\r\n\r\nwhat  they say we are.  But what is more important,  Sir,\r\n\r\nis  that  Singaporeans here know of the  tough  laws  and\r\n\r\nmeasures, and our position on this matter.  For  example,\r\n\r\neven in the US Congress, the Under Secretary herself\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid  that  people  can debate about  the  criteria  and,\r\n\r\nindeed, they are looking at so many countries.  It is not\r\n\r\na  matter  of science.  But, of course, we disagree  with\r\n\r\nthe  classification and we have said so very clearly, and\r\n\r\nwe will continue to point out inaccuracies in the report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, in the dialogue that we are\r\n\r\nhaving  with the US Embassy, have they pointed to  us  in\r\n\r\nwhich areas we are supposed to have failed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, for example, on the\r\n\r\nquestion  of foreign women coming to Singapore  to  offer\r\n\r\ncommercial  sex  services, it is a  matter  of  different\r\n\r\ncountries'  approach,  whether  this  amounts  to   human\r\n\r\ntrafficking for sexual exploitation.  As far as Singapore\r\n\r\nis  concerned, we are very clear.  We have answered  this\r\n\r\nquestion  before  in  this House  a  few  times,  ie,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, we take an approach that is pragmatic and that\r\n\r\nworks  for  us.   The Minister himself  and  myself  have\r\n\r\nresponded on how things are done in Singapore.   We  know\r\n\r\nthat  there  is prostitution.  Women do come  here.   But\r\n\r\nwhat is important is that the women who come here are not\r\n\r\ncoerced, forced or tricked into prostitution.  They  come\r\n\r\nhere  voluntarily.  That is important.  So it could be  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of definition and approach.

Even for these  cases,  the  security\r\n\r\ndeposit is still required to ensure that the VWO complies\r\n\r\nwith  the conditions of the tenancy agreement as well  as\r\n\r\nto  cover the cost of repairs and rectifications  arising\r\n\r\nfrom any damage to the property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, the Singapore Land Authority\r\n\r\nrequires  a  security  deposit, currently  set  at  three\r\n\r\nmonths.

They provide future-oriented practical training of high quality, relevant  to\r\n\r\nthe  needs of industry.  They constantly keep abreast  of\r\n\r\nthe  latest  developments in technology and the  changing\r\n\r\nneeds  of our economy in order to adequately prepare  the\r\n\r\nstudents for the job market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polytechnic students are trained in a wide variety\r\n\r\nof  practice-oriented  areas.  They  include  courses  in\r\n\r\nengineering,  media  and design, information  technology,\r\n\r\nhealth  sciences,  chemical and life  sciences,  maritime\r\n\r\nstudies, building and construction, and business, finance\r\n\r\nand  law.   To meet the changing demands in our  economy,\r\n\r\nthe   polytechnics  constantly  update   their   existing\r\n\r\ncourses.  Where\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary,  new courses are introduced, for  example,  in\r\n\r\nareas   such  as  mobile  and  wireless  computing,   and\r\n\r\nbiomedical engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polytechnic graduates are highly valued as practice-oriented and knowledgeable middle-level professionals,\r\n\r\nmanagers   and  technologists.   In  the  2001   graduate\r\n\r\nemployment  survey  conducted by the  four  polytechnics,\r\n\r\nabout  75% of fresh graduates found jobs within the first\r\n\r\nthree  months  of graduation. The average  gross  monthly\r\n\r\nsalary of fresh graduates was about $1,500.  Despite  the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn,  a good majority of  our  polytechnic\r\n\r\ngraduates  were  able to find jobs quickly.   This  bears\r\n\r\ntestimony to the quality of the training provided by  the\r\n\r\npolytechnics, and its relevancy to the needs of industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rationale for a Fifth Polytechnic</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first polytechnic, the Singapore Polytechnic,\r\n\r\nwas  established almost 50 years ago in  1954,  to  train\r\n\r\nmiddle-level  professionals to support the  technological\r\n\r\nand  economic development of Singapore.  Since  then,  we\r\n\r\nhave  established  three  more polytechnics  -  Ngee  Ann\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  in  1963, Temasek Polytechnic  in  1990  and\r\n\r\nNanyang   Polytechnic  in  1992.  Together,  these   four\r\n\r\npolytechnics  have  spearheaded the training  of  skilled\r\n\r\nmanpower to meet the needs of our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, with the improvements in our education\r\n\r\nsystem, about 40% of each primary one cohort are admitted\r\n\r\nto  polytechnics, compared with 28% 10  years  ago.   The\r\n\r\naverage  primary one cohort has also risen  significantly\r\n\r\nin  size,  from  a low of about 40,000 in the  1980s  and\r\n\r\nearly 1990s, to about 50,000 since 1995.  The first batch\r\n\r\nof  these  larger primary one cohorts, which is the  1988\r\n\r\n\"Year  of the Dragon\" cohort, came to our primary schools\r\n\r\nin  1995, and is expected to reach the polytechnic  level\r\n\r\nin  the  year  2005.  The four polytechnics  are  already\r\n\r\noperating at full capacity.  To cater to the increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  cohort  size eligible for polytechnic education,  we\r\n\r\nneed  about 4,000 additional polytechnic places  for  our\r\n\r\npre-employment training every year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the provision of pre-employment training,\r\n\r\nthe  polytechnic sector is also expected  to  shoulder  a\r\n\r\nsignificant share of skills renewal and upgrading for our\r\n\r\nworkforce.  The polytechnics have established close links\r\n\r\nwith  industry and are therefore well-placed  to  provide\r\n\r\ncontinuing education and training in a diverse  range  of\r\n\r\npractice-oriented programmes.  Graduates  from  the  ITE,\r\n\r\npolytechnics  and even universities who  require  further\r\n\r\ntraining or specialist skills upgrading now turn  to  the\r\n\r\npolytechnics  for their training needs.   Such  continual\r\n\r\nupgrading   and   renewal  of  skills  ensure   life-long\r\n\r\nemployability for our workforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has therefore decided to set up a fifth\r\n\r\npolytechnic,  the Republic Polytechnic, to cater  to  the\r\n\r\nneed  for increased capacity for pre-employment training.\r\n\r\nThe Republic Polytechnic, together with the four existing\r\n\r\npolytechnics, will also cater to the increase  in  demand\r\n\r\nfor  continuing  education  and  training.   Furthermore,\r\n\r\nbuilding  a new polytechnic offers us the opportunity  to\r\n\r\ninject new ideas and introduce innovations into a crucial\r\n\r\nsector  of  our  education system.   This  will  catalyse\r\n\r\nimprovements and the introduction of new ideas  into  the\r\n\r\nentire polytechnic sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advent of the new economy brings with it new\r\n\r\nchallenges  for  our  economy  and  the  workforce.   The\r\n\r\nRepublic  Polytechnic's vision, mission  and  educational\r\n\r\nphilosophy   will   be  geared  towards   meeting   these\r\n\r\nchallenges,  which  are characterised  by  globalisation,\r\n\r\nglobal competition, rapid technological advancements  and\r\n\r\nchanging business models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Republic Polytechnic will offer three core\r\n\r\nprogrammes  of  study  in  Engineering,  Information  and\r\n\r\nCommunications Technology (ICT) and Applied Sciences with\r\n\r\na  focus on Biomedical Sciences.  In the new economy, the\r\n\r\nEngineering industry continues to play an important  role\r\n\r\nin   providing   critical   services   to   support   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector.   ICT  continues   to   remain   a\r\n\r\nstrategic  resource  in  business  and  Government.   The\r\n\r\nBiomedical Sciences industry is poised for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrapid  growth  as Singapore aims to be a world-class  hub\r\n\r\nfor  the  life  sciences  industry  with  total  business\r\n\r\ncapabilities  for manufacturing, and R&D of  high  value-added biomedical sciences products and services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Republic Polytechnic will adopt a new approach\r\n\r\nof  integrating  Business  models  into  the  three  core\r\n\r\nprogrammes  of  study as well as offer hybrid  programmes\r\n\r\nthat  will  combine Business with any one of these  three\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   Such an approach will be in line  with  the\r\n\r\nincreasing  need by the industries for graduates  trained\r\n\r\nin a multi-disciplinary way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Republic Polytechnic will commence operations in\r\n\r\nthe year 2003 with a pioneer intake of 800 students.   It\r\n\r\nwill  increase  its  intake  gradually,  admitting  1,200\r\n\r\nstudents in 2004, and 1,800 in 2005, the latter being the\r\n\r\n\"dragon\"  cohort.

IDA was established in  1960  as  an\r\n\r\nintegral  part  of the World Bank Group to provide  long-term  loans at zero interest to the poorest of developing\r\n\r\ncountries  which  have  little or  no  access  to  market\r\n\r\nfinancing.   IDA's  lending  helps  to  build  the  human\r\n\r\ncapital,  infrastructure, institutions and policies  that\r\n\r\ndeveloping countries need to achieve sustainable economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.  IDA is funded largely by contributions from  the\r\n\r\ngovernments  of  member countries.   There  are  162  IDA\r\n\r\nmember  countries today, out of 183 World  Bank  members.\r\n\r\nThis Bill paves the way for Singapore to join the 88%  of\r\n\r\nWorld Bank members already in IDA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is already a member of the four other\r\n\r\ninstitutions  under  the  World Bank  group,  namely  the\r\n\r\nInternational  Bank for Reconstruction  and  Development,\r\n\r\nthe  International Finance Corporation, the Multi-Lateral\r\n\r\nInvestment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuarantee   Agency,  and  the  International  Centre   of\r\n\r\nSettlement of Investment Disputes.

Singapore's\r\n\r\nparticipation  in IDA will also enable our companies  and\r\n\r\nconsultants to share their expertise through IDA financed\r\n\r\nprojects.

Since  then, three private sector led  Committees\r\n\r\nset  up  by  my  Ministry,  the  Monetary  Authority   of\r\n\r\nSingapore, and the Attorney-General's Chambers, have been\r\n\r\nactive in reviewing Singapore's corporate governance  and\r\n\r\nregulatory framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Committees was the Disclosure and\r\n\r\nAccounting   Standards  Committee   (DASC).    The   DASC\r\n\r\nsubmitted its final report to the Government in September\r\n\r\n2001,   with   a  set  of  recommendations   to   improve\r\n\r\nSingapore's   accounting   standards   setting   process,\r\n\r\ndisclosure    requirements   and   rules    on    auditor\r\n\r\nindependence.  The Government has accepted all  the  DASC\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  This Bill seeks to implement  the  DASC\r\n\r\nrecommendations that require amendments to the  Companies\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Registry of Companies and\r\n\r\nBusinesses  has also embarked on several key  initiatives\r\n\r\nto  further  its  mission of making  Singapore  best  for\r\n\r\nbusiness.    This   includes  the  introduction   of   an\r\n\r\nelectronic  filing  system called  BizFile,  which  would\r\n\r\nallow  round  the clock filing and information  retrieval\r\n\r\nservices  over  the Internet for RCB's  customers.   This\r\n\r\nBill  seeks  to introduce legislative changes that  would\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the  implementation of an  electronic  filing\r\n\r\nsystem  for  companies in Singapore.  It  also  seeks  to\r\n\r\nsimplify  the incorporation process and reduce  the  time\r\n\r\nrequired  to  incorporate a company in  Singapore.   This\r\n\r\nBill also contains other amendments which are intended to\r\n\r\nupdate  and  streamline certain procedures and provisions\r\n\r\nin the Companies Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now highlight the main amendments\r\n\r\nproposed  in the Bill, starting with those to effect  the\r\n\r\nDASC's recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Compliance with Accounting Standards</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To position Singapore as the key business and\r\n\r\nfinancial   centre,  we  need  to  give   investors   the\r\n\r\nconfidence that companies registered in Singapore present\r\n\r\ntrue and fair financial statements that are in accordance\r\n\r\nwith   internationally  accepted  accounting   standards.\r\n\r\nIncidents  such  as  Enron and Worldcom  have  shown  the\r\n\r\ndangers  of misrepresenting financial statements.   While\r\n\r\nthe  Government cannot ensure the integrity of  financial\r\n\r\nreporting, we can put in place a regulatory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nframework that facilitates proper disclosure.  Currently,\r\n\r\nthere  are  no  statutory requirements for  companies  in\r\n\r\nSingapore to comply with prescribed accounting standards.\r\n\r\nClause 37 amends section 201 to require all companies  to\r\n\r\ncomply  with  prescribed accounting standards.   This  is\r\n\r\nsimilar to the practice in the UK and Australia.  Similar\r\n\r\nto  the  approach  in  UK, we would  allow  companies  to\r\n\r\ndeviate from the prescribed accounting standards if,  and\r\n\r\nonly  if,  such  deviations are  necessary  for  them  to\r\n\r\npresent a true and fair set of financial statements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 37 also requires companies to make full and\r\n\r\ndetailed   disclosures  in  their  financial   statements\r\n\r\nregarding    the    nature,   financial    effect,    and\r\n\r\njustifications,  for such deviations.  As  an  additional\r\n\r\nsafeguard,  the  directors'  decision  to  deviate   from\r\n\r\nprescribed   accounting  standards  would   require   the\r\n\r\nconcurrence of the companies' external auditor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 61 repeals the Ninth Schedule. The Ninth\r\n\r\nSchedule  contains a listing of items to be disclosed  in\r\n\r\nthe companies' accounts and was included in the Companies\r\n\r\nAct during a time when accounting standards were not well\r\n\r\ndeveloped.    Today,  the  situation  is  different,   as\r\n\r\naccounting  standards have become much  better  developed\r\n\r\nover the years.  With the move towards a disclosure-based\r\n\r\nregime  and  a legislation of compliance with  prescribed\r\n\r\naccounting standards, it is no longer necessary  for  the\r\n\r\nCompanies Act to contain additional provision relating to\r\n\r\nfinancial    reporting   and   disclosure   requirements.\r\n\r\nInstead,  companies would comply with the  reporting  and\r\n\r\ndisclosure  requirements  that  are  prescribed  in   the\r\n\r\naccounting  standards, or by market intermediaries,  such\r\n\r\nas the Stock Exchange.  These requirements are more up-to-date  and  they can better reflect the changing needs  of\r\n\r\nthe market place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Council on Corporate Disclosures and Governance</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, accounting standards in Singapore are set\r\n\r\nby  the  Institute  of  Certified Public  Accountants  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  (ICPAS), which is a professional  organisation\r\n\r\nof accountants.  ICPAS has done a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood  job over the years.  To improve the efficiency  and\r\n\r\nrigours  of its accounting standards setting process,  it\r\n\r\nhas  also  aligned many of our accounting standards  with\r\n\r\nthose  issued  by the International Accounting  Standards\r\n\r\nBoard.    However,  as  compliance  with  the  accounting\r\n\r\nstandards would be made a legal requirement, it would not\r\n\r\nbe  appropriate  for  the  accounting  standards  setting\r\n\r\nauthority  to  reside  with a professional  organisation.\r\n\r\nAnd,  in  leading  jurisdictions  such  as  the  UK   and\r\n\r\nAustralia,  accounting standards are set  by  independent\r\n\r\nbodies   comprising  representatives   from   businesses,\r\n\r\nprofessional  organisations,  academic  institutions  and\r\n\r\ngovernment.  This allows the key stakeholders to  have  a\r\n\r\nmore  direct  say on how accounting standards  should  be\r\n\r\nset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 36 introduces a new section 200A which\r\n\r\nprovides for the establishment of an independent panel to\r\n\r\nprescribe  accounting standards for Singapore  companies.\r\n\r\nThe  proposed  panel would be known  as  the  Council  on\r\n\r\nCorporate  Disclosure  and  Governance.   Under  the  new\r\n\r\narrangements, the ICPAS would continue to play a  pivotal\r\n\r\nrole  to  support  the  new  Council  in  the  accounting\r\n\r\nstandards  setting  process.   In  addition  to   setting\r\n\r\naccounting  standards, the new Council  would  also  make\r\n\r\nrecommendations  to  the Government  on  the  review  and\r\n\r\nenhancement  of  Singapore's  corporate  governance   and\r\n\r\ndisclosure  policies.   The new  Council  would  comprise\r\n\r\nmembers   from  businesses,  professional  organisations,\r\n\r\nacademic   institutions  and  Government.   The   Council\r\n\r\nMembers  would be appointed by the Minister for  Finance.\r\n\r\nMoving   forward,  the  new  Council  would   provide   a\r\n\r\ncollaborative  mechanism  for  the  private  and   public\r\n\r\nsectors  to  continuously review and improve  Singapore's\r\n\r\ncorporate governance and regulatory framework.  We expect\r\n\r\nto  set up the new Council in August this year, after the\r\n\r\nlegislative amendments have been approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Directors' Report</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 201 of the Act currently requires all\r\n\r\ncompanies to include a report by the Directors  in  their\r\n\r\nAnnual  Report.   The  DASC has felt  that  some  of  the\r\n\r\ndisclosure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequirements  in  the Directors' Report,  such  as  those\r\n\r\npertaining to the company's financial position do not add\r\n\r\nmuch value as they essentially repeat information that is\r\n\r\nalready  provided  in the company's financial  statement.\r\n\r\nAs  a result, Directors' Report becomes overly cluttered.\r\n\r\nClause  37 removes the requirement from section  201  for\r\n\r\nDirectors  to disclose such details in their  report.   A\r\n\r\nstatement by Directors as required under section  201(15)\r\n\r\nof the Companies Act would be retained as it requires the\r\n\r\nDirectors to confirm that the company is solvent and that\r\n\r\nthe  financial  statements presented to shareholders  are\r\n\r\ntrue and fair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Introduction of BizFile</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we strive to improve Singapore's regulatory\r\n\r\nframework, we also need to ensure that our processes  are\r\n\r\nefficient  and business-friendly.  RCB has been  actively\r\n\r\nworking with the private sector on ways to streamline its\r\n\r\nprocesses  so  as to bring about greater convenience  and\r\n\r\nlower   cost  to  its  customers.   One  of   RCB's   key\r\n\r\ninitiatives is the introduction of a web-based electronic\r\n\r\nfiling   system   called  \"BizFile\".    BizFile   enables\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  and  professionals  to  perform  filing  and\r\n\r\ninformation  retrieval on-line at any time  of  the  day.\r\n\r\nBizFile  also  enables RCB to reduce  business  cost  and\r\n\r\nexpedite  the  turn  around time  for  incorporation  and\r\n\r\nfiling.   The  introduction of BizFile would raise  RCB's\r\n\r\nservice  standards  and  align  its  practices  with  its\r\n\r\ncounterparts  in  the  US, UK  and  Australia.   RCB  has\r\n\r\nlaunched  the  first phase of BizFile, which  deals  with\r\n\r\nincorporation  of  companies in January  this  year.   It\r\n\r\nplans to launch the second phase of BizFile by the end of\r\n\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight the amendments in the Bill that\r\n\r\nwould facilitate the implementation of BizFile.  With the\r\n\r\nmove   to   an  electronic  filing  system,   RCB   would\r\n\r\nconsolidate  its existing hardcopy forms into  electronic\r\n\r\nforms.  Currently, a person who wants to file information\r\n\r\nwith  RCB  has  to  fill in several hardcopy  forms  that\r\n\r\ncapture  some duplicate data items.  BizFile also removes\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  manual data entry by  the  RCB  officers,\r\n\r\nthereby reducing the time and cost required for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprocessing  the application.  BizFile further  simplifies\r\n\r\nthe  filing and incorporation process by doing away  with\r\n\r\nhardcopy   certificates,   statutory   declarations   and\r\n\r\naffidavits.  There are several clauses in the Bill,  such\r\n\r\nas clauses 8, 16, 19 and 24, that amend the Act to remove\r\n\r\nthe  need for statutory declarations or affidavits.   RCB\r\n\r\nwould verify the user's identity online, using his unique\r\n\r\nnational  pin,  which  is also the  CPF  PAL  pin  before\r\n\r\nallowing    the   user   to   submit   his    declaration\r\n\r\nelectronically.  Singaporeans who do not have CPF PAL pin\r\n\r\nwould  be  assigned an ID and password by RCB  for  their\r\n\r\nBizFile transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 amends section 17 to replace the issue of a\r\n\r\nhardcopy  certificate  of  incorporation  via  electronic\r\n\r\nnotification.   Any member of the public  who  wishes  to\r\n\r\ncheck  the  registration status of a company  can  do  so\r\n\r\nonline, at no charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 also provides for the issue of a hardcopy\r\n\r\ncertificate of incorporation upon the payment of  a  fee.\r\n\r\nThis is to cater to companies that still require hardcopy\r\n\r\nincorporation  certificates for other purposes,  such  as\r\n\r\nfor submission to overseas regulators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Removal of Pre-Incorporation Checks for Similar Names</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of registering company names,\r\n\r\njurisdictions  such  as the US, UK,  Australia  and  Hong\r\n\r\nKong,  do  not conduct any pre-incorporation  checks  for\r\n\r\nsimilar  names.  These jurisdictions have found that  the\r\n\r\nchecking  for similar names only delays the incorporation\r\n\r\nprocess  and increases business cost.  They only  conduct\r\n\r\npre-incorporation checks for identical,  undesirable  and\r\n\r\ngazetted  names.   This enables same  day  incorporation,\r\n\r\nwhich  has  become the service standards that businessmen\r\n\r\nwould  expect.   To benchmark our service  standards  for\r\n\r\nincorporation to that of the US, UK, Australia  and  Hong\r\n\r\nKong,  we  propose  to  align RCB's practice  with  these\r\n\r\njurisdictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 of the Bill removes the requirement under\r\n\r\nsection 27 for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegistrar  to  do  pre-incorporation checks  for  similar\r\n\r\nnames.   Under  the  new arrangements, an  applicant  who\r\n\r\nwishes to register a company name can first perform  some\r\n\r\npreliminary checks from BizFile to see if the name he  is\r\n\r\napplying for is similar to that of an existing company or\r\n\r\nbusiness.  Bizfile would alert the applicant if there  is\r\n\r\nan existing company or business with a similar name.  The\r\n\r\napplicant  can  then decide whether he wants  to  proceed\r\n\r\nwith  the  application or select another name.   The  law\r\n\r\nwould  continue  to provide protection  and  avenues  for\r\n\r\nredress  for  incumbent  companies  and  businesses.   An\r\n\r\naggrieved  party can lodge a complaint to  the  Registrar\r\n\r\nagainst  the  company or business, with a  similar  name,\r\n\r\nwithin  twelve  months from the date of  registration  of\r\n\r\nthat  company  or  business.   After  twelve  months,  an\r\n\r\naggrieved party can still bring the matter to the  court.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the practice in the UK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, the proposed\r\n\r\namendments  in  this  Bill are part  of  a  comprehensive\r\n\r\nexercise to review our company legislation and to enhance\r\n\r\nSingapore's competitiveness as a global business centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another private sector led Committee, called the\r\n\r\nCompanies Legislation and Regulatory Framework Committee,\r\n\r\nis  in  the  process  of reviewing our  company  law  and\r\n\r\nregulatory  framework.   This Committee  has  posted  its\r\n\r\ndraft report on the Internet for public consultation, and\r\n\r\nis   expected  to  submit  its  recommendations  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  later this year.

The  Bill  seeks  to\r\n\r\nimplement the major recommendations of the Disclosure and\r\n\r\nAccounting Standards Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is establishing itself as a major\r\n\r\nfinancial   centre  in  the  world,   we   should   adopt\r\n\r\ninternationally   recognised  and   accepted   accounting\r\n\r\nstandards  and practices.  However, recent  instances  of\r\n\r\nmajor corporate disclosure failings, like Enron, Worldcom\r\n\r\nand  Xerox  in  USA, have shown that no  amount  of  good\r\n\r\ncorporate  governance  regulations or  strict  accounting\r\n\r\nstandards  can guard against management bent  on  crooked\r\n\r\nreporting.   This  is  particularly  glaring   as   these\r\n\r\nincidents  occur in the USA which prides  itself  as  the\r\n\r\nmotherland    of    good   corporate   disclosures    and\r\n\r\ntransparency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the record, Sir, I support the creation of the\r\n\r\nproposed  panel  of Council on Corporate  Disclosure  and\r\n\r\nGovernance.  If its role is only to serve as  a  body  to\r\n\r\nmake  recommendations, then there must be  retained  some\r\n\r\nteeth in the regulatory framework for existing Government\r\n\r\nagencies  to  police and fine offenders who  flout  these\r\n\r\nrules.   I read in the newspapers that in the USA itself,\r\n\r\nthey  are  thinking of charging the dishonest  management\r\n\r\nresponsible  for making untruthful disclosures  in  their\r\n\r\ncompanies' accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with my disappointment that no amount of\r\n\r\ngood   corporate  governance  regulations  can  safeguard\r\n\r\nagainst  dishonest management, I would like to raise  the\r\n\r\nissue  of  quarterly reporting.  Quarterly  reporting  is\r\n\r\nrequired from next year onwards for listed companies.   I\r\n\r\nhad supported this idea in the past in the hope that more\r\n\r\nregular    reporting   would   enable   better   business\r\n\r\ninformation and transparency.  However, I now come to the\r\n\r\nview  that  quarterly  reporting may  have  some  serious\r\n\r\ndisadvantages.    As  evident  in  the   USA,   quarterly\r\n\r\nreporting  has caused top management of companies  to  be\r\n\r\nvery  short-term  focused  on quarterly  results.   Share\r\n\r\nprices  jump  or plummet on every piece of  good  or  bad\r\n\r\nnews.   Management's attention becomes distracted by  the\r\n\r\nneed  to report good results every quarter, year in  year\r\n\r\nout,  which is not an easy thing to achieve, even by  the\r\n\r\nbest of management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I, therefore, have come to the conclusion that\r\n\r\nquarterly  reporting has severe disadvantage  of  forcing\r\n\r\ncompanies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  market  analysts to be too short-term  and  narrowly\r\n\r\nfocused.   Hence,  I would like to ask the  DPM  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance to reconsider the  requirement  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  quarterly reporting by listed  companies  from\r\n\r\nnext year onwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise two issues relating to\r\n\r\nthe  on-going  holding  costs of  companies.   Currently,\r\n\r\nabout  75%  of Singapore's 100,000 companies are  dormant\r\n\r\nand  tax-exempt  companies.   The  reason  is  that  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  wish to incorporate companies in  readiness\r\n\r\nto  start  a business.  However, most of these  companies\r\n\r\nremain   dormant   for  a  long  time.   Meanwhile,   the\r\n\r\nshareholders  have  to  incur some  unnecessary  on-going\r\n\r\ncosts, such as to appoint a qualified accounting firm  to\r\n\r\nprepare audited accounts, and to appoint a professionally\r\n\r\nqualified company secretary to file accounts.  These  two\r\n\r\nrequirements add to operating costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider  whether  the  above  two  requirements  can  be\r\n\r\nreduced  or simplified, especially for dormant  or  small\r\n\r\ncompanies.  The total cost could amount to a few thousand\r\n\r\ndollars,  which  are  not truly necessary  for  small  or\r\n\r\ndormant companies.  While we encourage companies to adopt\r\n\r\ngood international reporting and accounting practices,  I\r\n\r\nagree  with the private sector's Company Legislation  and\r\n\r\nRegulatory  Framework  Committee in  its  recommendations\r\n\r\nthat  these requirements should not be proscribed by law,\r\n\r\nespecially  for small and dormant companies.   Naturally,\r\n\r\nactive  companies of certain size and activity should  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to  adopt  these  practices  for  good   public\r\n\r\ndisclosure reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, Mr Leong Horn Kee raised\r\n\r\ntwo   points.   First  is  on  the  quarterly   reporting\r\n\r\nrequirement,  and the second is on the audit  requirement\r\n\r\nfor dormant companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the quarterly reporting requirement, this issue\r\n\r\nhad  been  brought up last year when the  Disclosure  and\r\n\r\nAccounting Standards Committee (DASC) issued its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndraft   report  for  public  consultation.   Some  listed\r\n\r\ncompanies  felt  that the requirement for  more  frequent\r\n\r\nreporting  would add to cost and could lead to short-term\r\n\r\nfocus,  as  Mr  Leong pointed out.  However,  there  were\r\n\r\nother  respondents, such as investors, who supported  the\r\n\r\nDASC's proposal, because they would like listed companies\r\n\r\nto   be   more  transparent  and  to  have  more   timely\r\n\r\ndisclosures.  America, Canada, Thailand and Malaysia  all\r\n\r\nhave quarterly reporting for listed companies.  Quarterly\r\n\r\nreporting is also required for companies listed  on  Hong\r\n\r\nKong's Growth Enterprise Market (the GEM market) and  the\r\n\r\nTokyo's  Stock  Exchange's mother market  for  start-ups.\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  and  Tokyo are considering  having  quarterly\r\n\r\nreporting  for all listed companies, in other words,  for\r\n\r\ntheir   main   boards.   Australia  and  United   Kingdom\r\n\r\ncurrently  require six-monthly reports for  their  listed\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an issue where there are trade-offs. But, on\r\n\r\nbalance,  the  DASC felt that quarterly  reporting  would\r\n\r\nbenefit  the  listed  companies  in  the  long  run,   as\r\n\r\ninvestors   would  gravitate  towards  more   transparent\r\n\r\ncompanies.   In addition, quarterly reporting would  also\r\n\r\nhelp to improve Singapore's transparency and standing  as\r\n\r\na world-class business and financial centre.  To give the\r\n\r\nlisted  companies enough time to prepare themselves,  the\r\n\r\nDASC  has  recommended a transition  period,  before  the\r\n\r\nquarterly  reporting requirement is  imposed,  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not expect compliance cost to increase\r\n\r\nsignificantly  with  quarterly  reporting,  because   the\r\n\r\nfinancial results that are used for the quarterly  report\r\n\r\ndo  not need to be audited.  Many listed companies  would\r\n\r\nsubmit  regular  financial  reports  to  their  Board  of\r\n\r\nDirectors, and the additional cost involved in presenting\r\n\r\nthese reports to the public should not be too high.  Some\r\n\r\nlisted companies in Singapore have already started  doing\r\n\r\nquarterly  reporting.   Drawing from  the  experience  of\r\n\r\nthese   companies  and  countries  which   have   started\r\n\r\nquarterly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreporting, listed companies in Singapore should not  face\r\n\r\ntoo   much   difficulties   in   implementing   quarterly\r\n\r\nreporting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong's second point has to do with statutory\r\n\r\naudit   for   small   and  dormant  companies   and   the\r\n\r\nrecommendation  to remove the statutory  requirement  for\r\n\r\nprivate  companies  to  appoint professionally  qualified\r\n\r\ncompany  secretaries.  I thank Mr Leong for his comments.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Company Legislation and Regulatory Framework\r\n\r\nCommittee  has  received  similar  feedback  on  the  two\r\n\r\nproposals  from the business community.  The  Committee's\r\n\r\nreview  is still on-going.  The Committee has posted  its\r\n\r\ndraft report on the Internet for public feedback.  Public\r\n\r\nconsultation ends on 31st of July.  I would look  forward\r\n\r\nto  Mr  Leong making his comments to the Committee  which\r\n\r\nwill  take  them into consideration, together with  other\r\n\r\ncomments  from the public consultation, before submitting\r\n\r\nits final recommendations to the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Lee Hsien Loong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BUSINESS REGISTRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Business Registration Act provides the\r\n\r\nbasic  framework  of governance for sole  proprietorships\r\n\r\nand partnerships in Singapore.  The Business Registration\r\n\r\nAct was last amended in April 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have highlighted in the Second Reading of the\r\n\r\nCompanies (Amendment) Bill that the Registry of Companies\r\n\r\nand Businesses (\"RCB\") is working on an electronic filing\r\n\r\nsystem called BizFile.  As in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncase  of the Companies (Amendment) Bill, this Bill  seeks\r\n\r\nto  introduce  legislative changes that would  facilitate\r\n\r\nthe   implementation  of  BizFile   for   businesses   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   This  Bill also seeks to streamline  certain\r\n\r\nprocedures  and  provisions in the Business  Registration\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now highlight the main amendments\r\n\r\nproposed in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Removal of the Need for Physical Signatures, Certificates of Registration, Statutory Declarations and Affidavits</i>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case of companies, BizFile would simplify\r\n\r\nthe   process  for  business  owners  to  register  their\r\n\r\nbusinesses and update their records with RCB.   The  user\r\n\r\nneed  not  submit  any hardcopy forms,  declarations  and\r\n\r\naffidavits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends section 9 to dispense with the need\r\n\r\nto   issue  hardcopy  certificates  of  registration   as\r\n\r\nevidence of registration.  The hardcopy certificate would\r\n\r\nbe  replaced  by an electronic notification.   Section  9\r\n\r\nwould  also be amended to remove the requirement for  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  owner  to  display a  hardcopy  certificate  of\r\n\r\nregistration.  Any member of public who wishes  to  check\r\n\r\nthe  registration status of a business can do so  online,\r\n\r\nat  no  charge.  However, if a business requires hardcopy\r\n\r\ncertificates of registration for other purposes, such  as\r\n\r\nfor  submission  to  overseas regulators,  it  can  still\r\n\r\nobtain hardcopy certificates from RCB upon the payment of\r\n\r\na fee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Removal of Pre-Registration Checks for Similar Names</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Second Reading of the Companies\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill,  I have explained  the  rationale  for\r\n\r\nremoving  the requirement for the Registrar  to  do  pre-incorporation  checks for similar  names.   I  have  also\r\n\r\nexplained  how  the  proposed removal would  benefit  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community  and how there  would  be  sufficient\r\n\r\nsafeguards to protect the interest of incumbent companies\r\n\r\nand  businesses.   Clause 8 of the Business  Registration\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill aligns the provision in section 11  with\r\n\r\nthe corresponding provision in the Companies (Amendment)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill.   Under the new section 11, the Registrar  will  no\r\n\r\nlonger do pre-registration checks for similar names.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendments in this\r\n\r\nBill are expected to benefit business owners in terms  of\r\n\r\nlower   costs,   more  efficient  service   and   greater\r\n\r\nconvenience.   It would also align RCB's  practices  with\r\n\r\nits  counterparts in the US, UK and Australia, and  allow\r\n\r\nRCB to provide better service to its customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to speak\r\n\r\nin  support  of this Bill.  As the Deputy Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas    explained,   the   Bill   will   facilitate    the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  electronic filing for  companies  via\r\n\r\nBizFile   and  simplify  some  procedures  for   business\r\n\r\nregistration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I particularly support the intent and trend adopted\r\n\r\nby  the  Government to make business registration easier,\r\n\r\ncheaper and faster. This is the basic purpose of BizFile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in line with this approach, I would like to\r\n\r\nraise two suggestions to the Deputy Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first suggestion is with regard to the\r\n\r\nregistered  address  of  a  business.   At  present,  the\r\n\r\nrequirement  is that businesses must be registered  in  a\r\n\r\nbusiness address.  A company is not allowed to register a\r\n\r\nresidential  address as the registered business  address.\r\n\r\nWe know that many Singaporeans have formed companies with\r\n\r\nthe  intent to eventually start a business.  Pending  the\r\n\r\nstart of the business, these companies are dormant.   The\r\n\r\nneed  to  be registered in a business address means  that\r\n\r\ncompanies  often  have  to  be registered  with  business\r\n\r\naddresses  of  law  firms  and audit  companies.   Though\r\n\r\nsmall,  often there is a fee to be paid.  For  the  firms\r\n\r\nwhose  addresses are being used as the business  address,\r\n\r\nthis  requirement adds to unnecessary administrative  and\r\n\r\ncorrespondence work.  Hence, I would like to suggest that\r\n\r\nthe Government consider allowing residential\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naddresses  to  be  used as registered and  correspondence\r\n\r\naddresses of firms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the present residential addresses are\r\n\r\nnot  permitted  to  be  used for  conducting  businesses,\r\n\r\nexcept  for  certain approved purposes, such as  IT-based\r\n\r\nstart-ups.   So  as  to  foster  the  growth  of  a  more\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial  climate  and  a  more  business-friendly\r\n\r\nenvironment,  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister to consider liberalising the restriction on  the\r\n\r\nuse of residential addresses for the conduct of business.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  the allowed businesses should not  create  a\r\n\r\ndisamenity  to the residential neighbourhood.   Singapore\r\n\r\ndoes  not  have many houses with garages,  so  we  cannot\r\n\r\nboast  that many bright ideas from Singaporeans germinate\r\n\r\nfrom  garages.  But many Singaporeans live in HDB  flats.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we should be proud to say that  many  of  our\r\n\r\ngreat  businesses sprouted from the living rooms  of  HDB\r\n\r\nflats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion, Sir, is with regard to\r\n\r\nliquidation  of companies. We can now claim  that  it  is\r\n\r\nvery easy to form a company in Singapore, especially with\r\n\r\nthe  advent of BizFile.  I am not sure whether we can say\r\n\r\nthe  same  for the liquidation of companies.  As  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid   earlier,  many  Singaporeans  form  companies   in\r\n\r\npreparation  to  start a business.  However,  several  of\r\n\r\nthese  businesses remain dormant and may  never  see  the\r\n\r\ndaylight of a day of business.  Finally, they have to  be\r\n\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest that the relevant\r\n\r\nbodies  study  the  procedures and  requirements  in  the\r\n\r\nliquidation  or closing of companies.  I  am  told  that,\r\n\r\ntypically, liquidation of a company costs between $5,000-$15,000.  For a small or dormant company, this would be a\r\n\r\nlarge sum.  I concede that regulations on liquidation  of\r\n\r\ncompanies should require more careful handling so  as  to\r\n\r\nprotect  creditors.   I would like to  request  that  the\r\n\r\nprocedures  should  be simplified and  made  cheaper,  if\r\n\r\npossible.    One  suggestion  is  to  use   BizFile   for\r\n\r\nelectronic filing of closing of dormant companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Leong\r\n\r\nraised  two  points.   First, using  home  addresses  for\r\n\r\nbusinesses to register their addresses.  We have,  as  Mr\r\n\r\nLeong  pointed  out, a Technopreneur  Home  Office  (THO)\r\n\r\nScheme.  The Technopreneur Home Office Scheme was started\r\n\r\nin  1999  to allow a businessman who qualifies under  the\r\n\r\nScheme  to  register  his  residential  address  as   his\r\n\r\nbusiness   address,   and  the  idea   was   to   promote\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurship by reducing start-up cost.  There is  a\r\n\r\ngood  reason  for  separating commercial activities  from\r\n\r\nresidential  areas. We need to ensure  that  the  use  of\r\n\r\nresidences   to  conduct  businesses  will  not   disturb\r\n\r\nneighbours and affect the living environment.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nonly  certain types of business activities, for  example,\r\n\r\nthose that are not noisy and do not cause pollution,  are\r\n\r\nallowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong mentioned dormant companies. With the new\r\n\r\nBizFile  arrangement with the Registry of  Companies  and\r\n\r\nBusinesses,  one  can  set up  a  company  within  a  few\r\n\r\nminutes.  So the need to set up a dormant company well in\r\n\r\nadvance,  before a person actually starts business,  will\r\n\r\nbe  substantially reduced.  I think that problem will  be\r\n\r\nsolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for which business we should allow to operate\r\n\r\nwithin a residential premise, this is something which  we\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  study.   If  we are  satisfied  that  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  does  not cause problems to the  neighbours,  I\r\n\r\nthink we can consider allowing it.  It may or may not  be\r\n\r\na  technopreneurship type of business.  But I would  urge\r\n\r\nMr  Leong to consider the point of view of neighbours  of\r\n\r\npeople  who do business at home.  Because if they have  a\r\n\r\nbusiness  where  there are lots of customers  coming  and\r\n\r\ngoing,  or where there is noise, smoke or smell -  as  an\r\n\r\nMP,  I am sure Mr Leong would have met many such cases  - then  he has to answer to the neighbours as well  as  the\r\n\r\nperson who wants to do the business.  A balance will have\r\n\r\nto be struck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also asked about simplifying process of\r\n\r\nliquidation.  Here, I agree with Mr Leong that we need to\r\n\r\nstrike a balance between having safeguards to protect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncreditors  and  employees and, on  the  other  hand,  not\r\n\r\nimposing unnecessary business cost.  To encourage  people\r\n\r\nto  start businesses, we must not make it too onerous and\r\n\r\ncostly  for those who have failed and have to  exit.   In\r\n\r\nrecent  years, the Government has reviewed the bankruptcy\r\n\r\nlaw to make it easier for people who have failed in their\r\n\r\nbusiness ventures to come back and try again.  As part of\r\n\r\nthe  review  of our Company Law, the Company  Law  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee  (CLRC) is also looking at ways  to  streamline\r\n\r\nour  insolvency  legislation  and  lower  the  costs   to\r\n\r\ncompanies that are going through judicial management  and\r\n\r\nliquidation.  The CLRC has also recommended that we study\r\n\r\nand   learn   from   the  developments   in   the   major\r\n\r\njurisdictions.  For example, the UK has recently  started\r\n\r\nits review on its insolvency regime.  The UK's review was\r\n\r\nprompted by the need to promote an enterprise culture and\r\n\r\nto  encourage entrepreneurs who have failed  honestly  to\r\n\r\ntry  again.   At the same time, the law will continue  to\r\n\r\nprovide  sufficient  safeguards  for  the  protection  of\r\n\r\ncreditors and employees.  So, this is something which the\r\n\r\nCLRC  will  have  in  mind  as  it  comes  out  with  its\r\n\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Lee Hsien Loong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PARLIAMENTARY PENSIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Parliamentary Pensions Act, a\r\n\r\npolitical office-holder from Political Secretary to Prime\r\n\r\nMinister serves on pensionable terms.  The post of  Mayor\r\n\r\nis  a  recent  creation.   Hence,  it  is  currently  not\r\n\r\nincluded in the Parliamentary Pensions Act.

First,  it can be counted as service  towards  an\r\n\r\noffice-holder's  pension.   Secondly,  if  he  does   not\r\n\r\nqualify for an office-holder's pension, then his years of\r\n\r\nservice  as  a  Mayor can also count  as  his  period  of\r\n\r\nservice towards a Member's pension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment seeks to put the position of Mayor\r\n\r\ntogether  with  office-holders, such as  Prime  Minister,\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister, Speaker and Ministers.  Sir, these\r\n\r\nare  public  officers  under  the  Constitution  and   it\r\n\r\nrequires its holders first to be elected into Parliament.\r\n\r\nI   believe   this  is  why  their  pensions  are   under\r\n\r\nParliamentary Pensions Act, rather than under  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice Pensions Act.  These officials direct and oversee\r\n\r\nmatters affecting national security, foreign affairs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  other policy matters, and they should be recognised.\r\n\r\nThe  question is whether the appointment of Mayor can  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  as  public office in the same category.   The\r\n\r\nMayor is not appointed under the Constitution, or any law\r\n\r\npassed  by  Parliament.  Rather, the Mayor  is  appointed\r\n\r\nunder  the rules of the People's Association Act.   These\r\n\r\nrules  are designated by the Board of PA, and Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  House did not have a chance to consider whether such\r\n\r\nMayors are required in the first place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the House is being asked to consider allowing\r\n\r\npublic  funds to be used to give pension to  Mayors.   Is\r\n\r\nthe  People's Association expecting the House to  rubber-stamp  their  plans, which will be put in place,  without\r\n\r\nconsulting  Parliament?   Does  this  make  sense,  since\r\n\r\nParliament  was not involved in approving or disapproving\r\n\r\nthe creation of such an appointment in the first place?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, should service as a Mayor count as\r\n\r\nadditional  service  to qualify for a  Member's  pension?\r\n\r\nUnder  the current Act, a Member should serve a total  of\r\n\r\nnine  years  as  an MP before qualifying for  a  Member's\r\n\r\npension.   This  amendment will allow time  served  as  a\r\n\r\nMayor to count as additional years to be added on to  his\r\n\r\nservice  as  an  MP.   Why does the  Government  see  the\r\n\r\nnecessity  to  do this?  Is the Government not  confident\r\n\r\nthat the Mayors can chalk up nine years as an MP?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the People's Association CDC Rules, the\r\n\r\ncriteria for the appointment of Mayor have changed twice.\r\n\r\nIn the most recent amendment on 24th November 2001, there\r\n\r\nis no longer a requirement for a Mayor to be the Chairman\r\n\r\nof  a  town  council.  In other words,  so  long  as  the\r\n\r\npotential  Mayor is Chairman of CDC, he will qualify  for\r\n\r\nappointment  as a Mayor.  Why was this change  made?   It\r\n\r\nmust be because I believe the Board of the PA, headed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister, considers that there would be Mayors\r\n\r\nwho  may  not be Town Council Chairmen, ie, they are  not\r\n\r\nelected  Members  of  Parliament.   Is  it  correct,   in\r\n\r\nprinciple, to give them a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember's  pension when they have not served enough  years\r\n\r\nas  a  Member?

Of  course,   as\r\n\r\nvolunteer employers, one can make voluntary contributions\r\n\r\ntowards   their  respective  CPF  accounts.   Would   it,\r\n\r\ntherefore, not be in line with the general policy of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  also  convert  pensions  for  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament,  ministerial and other offices,  to  keep  in\r\n\r\nline  with  the rest of the working people in  Singapore?\r\n\r\nIn  this  way, our citizens would observe that Parliament\r\n\r\nhas not introduced in any way any form of discrimination,\r\n\r\nas  perceived  by  them, in favour of MPs,  Ministers  or\r\n\r\nother officers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconnected  to  Parliament,  eg,  Mayor,  that  is   being\r\n\r\nintroduced through this proposed amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding Mr Low\r\n\r\nThia  Khiang's point on why we did not come to Parliament\r\n\r\nto  seek approval for the creation of the post of  Mayor,\r\n\r\nand  the  formation  of  Community  Development  Councils\r\n\r\n(CDCs),  it  is  the prerogative of the  Government,  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  in particular, to decide  what  sort  of\r\n\r\nstructure  of government he wishes to have.  Since  1997,\r\n\r\nwe  have  created Community Development Councils to  help\r\n\r\nthe Government to carry out and implement the policies of\r\n\r\nsome   of  our  Ministries.   Hence,  we  have  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment Councils.  In the past, because we had  small\r\n\r\nCommunity Development Councils, we therefore required the\r\n\r\nChairman,  if he is to be appointed as a Mayor,  to  also\r\n\r\nbecome  the Chairman of a Town Council, apart from  being\r\n\r\nthe Chairman of a Community Development Council.  But for\r\n\r\nthose Chairmen of Community Development Councils who  are\r\n\r\nnot  Chairmen of Town Councils at the same time, then  we\r\n\r\nsay  that  they will carry on and be called  Chairmen  of\r\n\r\nCommunity Development Councils, and not Mayors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, we had two Mayors, in Tanjong Pagar and\r\n\r\nMarine Parade GRCs, because both Mr Eugene Yap and Dr  Ow\r\n\r\nChin  Hock  were  Chairmen of both Councils  -  the  Town\r\n\r\nCouncil as well as the Community Development Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the last General Election, we thought that,\r\n\r\nfor  better organisation, efficiency and for synergy,  we\r\n\r\nshould  enlarge  the  Community Development  Councils  by\r\n\r\nreducing the number of CDCs from nine to five.  By  doing\r\n\r\nso,    therefore,    we   increased   tremendously    the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities of the Chairmen of Community Development\r\n\r\nCouncils,  if they were required to be Chairmen  of  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils,   and  they  may  be  loaded  with  unnecessary\r\n\r\nimplementation  and operational duties.  So,  we  decided\r\n\r\nthat  we  make an amendment to the rules to only  require\r\n\r\nhim  to  be  the  Chairman of the  Community  Development\r\n\r\nCouncil in order to become the Mayor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so doing, we also recognise that this is a very\r\n\r\nimportant  position and, obviously, we  will  not  simply\r\n\r\nappoint  anyone  unelected to  be  the  Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunity Development Council or as Mayor.  That will not\r\n\r\nserve  the  objectives of the Government.  We could  just\r\n\r\nhave  General  Managers.  In fact, for the administrative\r\n\r\ndetails  and implementation, we have the General Managers\r\n\r\nof  the CDCs running the day-to-day operations.  When  it\r\n\r\ncomes  to  direction,  strategy,  policy  and,  in   some\r\n\r\ninstances, even talking to the Ministers concerning  what\r\n\r\nthe  CDC  should do, we needed the Mayors to do the  job.\r\n\r\nHence,  the  post  of  Mayor  was  created,  and  he  has\r\n\r\nsubstantial responsibilities and, therefore, he shall  be\r\n\r\nan elected person.  There will be no occasion that we can\r\n\r\nthink of that will make us appoint an unelected person to\r\n\r\nbe  a Mayor.  I think Mr Low can be assured of that.   In\r\n\r\nthe  same way, we have made the Town Council Chairman  an\r\n\r\nelected MP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of whether it is fair to compare the\r\n\r\nMayor to other appointments in the Parliamentary Pensions\r\n\r\nAct,  eg,  the  Prime Minister, Ministers,  Ministers  of\r\n\r\nState,   Parliamentary  Secretaries  and  the   Political\r\n\r\nSecretary,  are they of the same level or why  should  we\r\n\r\nput  a  Mayor  in  the  same category as  office-holders,\r\n\r\noffice-holders  are  important  political   appointments,\r\n\r\nbecause   they   help  the  Government  carry   out   its\r\n\r\nobjectives,  and these appointments are  decided  by  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low said that the Prime Minister, Ministers and\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries are defined in the Constitution\r\n\r\nand,  therefore,  the  power  is  derived  from  what  is\r\n\r\nprovided  for  in the Constitution.  In the Constitution,\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  have posts such as Ministers  of  State  nor\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretary, and yet we have these posts  in  our\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Pensions Act.  In the  case  of  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary,  he  does not even need to be an  elected  MP.\r\n\r\nThe  Prime Minister, with his prerogative and powers, can\r\n\r\nappoint any person to be a Political Secretary, and he is\r\n\r\nfully   entitled  to  pension  under  the   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nPensions Act, albeit not being an elected person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no reason why Mayors should not be\r\n\r\nconsidered  in  the same category and be eligible  for  a\r\n\r\npension in the same way as other office-holders.   For  a\r\n\r\nMayor  who  is  a new Member - a \"new Member\"  means  any\r\n\r\nMember  of  Parliament elected after 1995  -  he  is  not\r\n\r\neligible for an MP pension.  He is eligible for CPF.  So,\r\n\r\nfor  a  Mayor who is a new Member, he needs to accumulate\r\n\r\neight years of service as Mayor in order to qualify for a\r\n\r\npension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of an old Member who has got reckonable\r\n\r\npensionable  service as an MP, then  his  time  spent  as\r\n\r\nMayor,  if  it is less than eight years, can be  computed\r\n\r\nfor   the   purpose  of  considering   his   MP   pension\r\n\r\neligibility.  Hence, two-thirds of his service  as  Mayor\r\n\r\nis counted as an MP's service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among our present Mayors, we have both examples - those who are old Members and those who are new Members.\r\n\r\nBut,  for new Members, they need to serve long enough  in\r\n\r\norder to qualify for a pension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have, in a way, dealt with Mr Low Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang's questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Mr Chandra Mohan's question, I was quite\r\n\r\ncurious  as  to  why  he is interested  in  Parliamentary\r\n\r\npension when the subject does not really concern him.   I\r\n\r\nnow  understand  he is talking about a  different  issue,\r\n\r\nlike   why   do   we  want  to  consider  office-holders'\r\n\r\nappointments even as pensionable.  He says that the trend\r\n\r\nhas  been  towards CPF.  Yes, indeed, it  has  been,  but\r\n\r\nthere  are certain key appointments that we have kept  as\r\n\r\npensionable  service,  eg,  the  Administrative  Service,\r\n\r\nForeign  Service  and  Intelligence  Service  are   still\r\n\r\npensionable services.  There are good reasons  for  this.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  for  office holders,  we  think  that  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  that they remain on pensionable  service  and,\r\n\r\nhence, we keep them on pensionable service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for Members of Parliament, we have made a\r\n\r\ndecision way back in 1995 that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  new Members of Parliament, elected henceforth, shall\r\n\r\nbe paid CPF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I wish to seek a\r\n\r\nclarification  from the Minister. The  Minister,  in  his\r\n\r\nanswer,  said  that the appointment of office-holders  is\r\n\r\nthe  prerogative of the Prime Minister.  It seems  to  me\r\n\r\nthat the Minister is saying that the job of Parliament is\r\n\r\njust to approve the spending of public funds for whatever\r\n\r\nappointments  that  have  been  created  by   the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  Should that be the role and job of Parliament?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> It is definitely not the role of\r\n\r\nParliament  to decide on what posts to create.   That  is\r\n\r\nthe prerogative of the Prime Minister and the Government.\r\n\r\nAs  to whether the post should be pensionable or not,  in\r\n\r\ncertain  instances,  like in the  civil  service,  it  is\r\n\r\ntotally the prerogative of the Government to decide which\r\n\r\npost  should be pensionable and which post should not  be\r\n\r\npensionable.

We  have  to  make\r\n\r\nsure  and  be  clear that the post is not  an  office  of\r\n\r\nprofit, just like Ministers' posts are not considered  as\r\n\r\noffice  of  profit. Therefore, the latter are already  in\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution.  But in the case of Mayor, it is  not.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  under  Article 2(5) of the Constitution,  the\r\n\r\nPresident has made an order to consider the post of Mayor\r\n\r\nas  not being an office of profit.

As a member of\r\n\r\nthe Financial Action Task Force, Singapore had adopted  a\r\n\r\nset of Eight Special Recommendations, one of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich was to take immediate steps to ratify and implement\r\n\r\nthe Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the terrorist threat that Singapore and the\r\n\r\nrest  of  the world are facing today is like  nothing  we\r\n\r\nhave  ever encountered before. The recent events  of  the\r\n\r\npast  year  have  shown  that  terrorism  has  become   a\r\n\r\ntransnational phenomenon, one that no country  is  immune\r\n\r\nto.   Given the indigenous resources and extensive  reach\r\n\r\nof  these  groups, the threat of terrorism will  continue\r\n\r\nfor a long time to come.  It is widely believed that many\r\n\r\nterrorist activities are funded through a series of money\r\n\r\nlaundering  operations.  Hence, targetting the  financial\r\n\r\naspect of these transnational groups will be an effective\r\n\r\nway   to  cripple  and  disrupt  their  operations.   The\r\n\r\nintegrity of our financial systems must be prevented from\r\n\r\nbeing used by terrorist organisations. We already have  a\r\n\r\nvigorous  system of checks to detect and counter criminal\r\n\r\nuse  of the financial system.  The Terrorism (Suppression\r\n\r\nof Financing) Bill will further strengthen our ability to\r\n\r\nmonitor  such transactions and take appropriate  actions.\r\n\r\nLet me now deal with the key provisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Prohibition against dealing with Terrorist Property (Part II of the Bill)</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II of the Bill covers prohibition against\r\n\r\nterrorist   property.   Specifically,   we   can   target\r\n\r\nproperties that may be used in connection with  terrorist\r\n\r\nacts.  Clause 2 of the Bill defines property as assets of\r\n\r\nevery  kind, whether tangible or intangible,  movable  or\r\n\r\nimmovable,  including bank credits,  travellers  cheques,\r\n\r\nbank  cheques,  money orders, shares, securities,  bonds,\r\n\r\ndrafts and letters of credit.  Clauses 3 to 6 of the Bill\r\n\r\nmake  it  an  offence to provide or collect property  for\r\n\r\nterrorist   acts,  provide  property  and  services   for\r\n\r\nterrorist purposes, use or possess property for terrorist\r\n\r\npurposes,  and  deal with property of terrorists.   These\r\n\r\nprohibitions apply to every person in Singapore  and  any\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen outside Singapore who is dealing  with\r\n\r\nterrorist property.  These clauses give effect to Article\r\n\r\n2(1)  of  the Convention.  Besides giving effect  to  the\r\n\r\nConvention, these clauses also give effect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the United Nations Security Council Resolution  1373.\r\n\r\nClause  7  of the Bill empowers the Minister to exempt  a\r\n\r\nperson   from   the  prohibition  against  dealing   with\r\n\r\nterrorist property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Disclosure (Part III of the Bill)</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III of the Bill imposes a duty of disclosure.\r\n\r\nThe Convention obligates Singapore to identify and detect\r\n\r\nterrorist  property for purposes of possible  forfeiture.\r\n\r\nTo  meet  this, clause 8 of the Bill imposes  a  duty  on\r\n\r\nevery  person  in  Singapore and every Singapore  citizen\r\n\r\noutside  who  has  possession,  custody  or  control   of\r\n\r\nterrorist   property,   or   information   regarding    a\r\n\r\ntransaction  in  terrorist  property  to  disclose   such\r\n\r\ninformation  to the Police.  Clause 10 of the  Bill  also\r\n\r\nprovides   that  every  person  in  Singapore   who   has\r\n\r\ninformation  which  can  prevent  the  commission  of   a\r\n\r\nterrorism   financing   offence,   or   assist   in   the\r\n\r\napprehension, prosecution or conviction of a person for a\r\n\r\nterrorism  financing  offence  to  immediately  inform  a\r\n\r\npolice officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, clause 9 of the Bill empowers the Minister,\r\n\r\nby  order in the Gazette, to require any person or  class\r\n\r\nof  persons to continually determine whether they possess\r\n\r\nterrorist property. However, let me assure the House that\r\n\r\nthis  will not be invoked unnecessarily.  We foresee that\r\n\r\nthis  provision  would  be  used  for  a  person  who  is\r\n\r\nsuspected  of having dealings with terrorist property  or\r\n\r\npersons  who  had  previously had such  dealings  without\r\n\r\ntheir knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Seizure,  Freezing and Confiscation of Terrorist Property (Part IV of the Bill)</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Part IV of the Bill also spells out\r\n\r\nin detail the manner in which a terrorist property may be\r\n\r\nseized, frozen or confiscated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, application for search and seizure. Clause\r\n\r\n11  of  the  Bill  empowers a High Court Judge  to  issue\r\n\r\nwarrants for search and seizure of any terrorist property\r\n\r\nand  restraint  orders in respect of terrorist  property.\r\n\r\nClause 20 of the Bill provides\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   such   warrants  and  restraint  orders  generally\r\n\r\ncontinue for six months but may be extended. Clause 14 of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  makes it an offence for a person to  whom  the\r\n\r\norder  has been served contravene with a restraint order.\r\n\r\nClause  21  of  the Bill allows the Court  to  order  the\r\n\r\nforfeiture of terrorist property. Clauses 12  and  22  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  provide that the affidavit in support  of  the\r\n\r\napplication  for  warrants  for  search  and  seizure  of\r\n\r\nterrorist property, and for order of forfeiture,  may  be\r\n\r\nmade by the investigating officer on his information  and\r\n\r\nbelief.   Personal knowledge by the investigating officer\r\n\r\nthat  the property is terrorist property is not required.\r\n\r\nClause 18 of the Bill further provides that the Attorney-General  may apply to revoke or vary warrants or  orders.\r\n\r\nClause  24  of  the Bill provides that if  the  Judge  is\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that the property is linked to  terrorists  or\r\n\r\nthat  it  will  be  used to facilitate  or  carry  out  a\r\n\r\nterrorist  act, the Judge shall order the  forfeiture  of\r\n\r\nthe property.  Where the Judge refuses an application for\r\n\r\nforfeiture, clause 26 of the Bill provides that the Judge\r\n\r\nshall  also  identify the property and declare  that  the\r\n\r\nproperty is not subject to forfeiture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, management of terrorist property. Clauses 15\r\n\r\nto  17  set  out  the appointment of  a  manager  of  the\r\n\r\nterrorist property who can be the public trustee.  Clause\r\n\r\n28  of  the  Bill  also provides that  the  property  may\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  seized, restrained or  managed  by  the\r\n\r\nappointed person, pending any appeal.  This is to prevent\r\n\r\nthe  property from being scurried away.  Clause 29 of the\r\n\r\nBill  also empowers the Judge to nullify any transactions\r\n\r\nthat  have  occurred  after the property  was  seized  or\r\n\r\nrestrained,  except where such transactions were  carried\r\n\r\nout in good faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, safeguards. Clause 13 of the Bill provides\r\n\r\nthat the Judge may require undertakings from the Attorney-General  with respect to the payment of damages or  costs\r\n\r\nfor the warrant or restraint order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, clauses 19 and 27 of the Bill provide recourse\r\n\r\nfor a person who has an interest in the property that was\r\n\r\nseized, restrained or forfeited, to apply to revoke\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  vary the warrant or order, or set aside the order  of\r\n\r\nforfeiture within 60 days of the order of forfeiture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Mutual Assistance and Extradition (Part V of the Bill)</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill provides that the International\r\n\r\nConvention  for  the  Suppression  of  the  Financing  of\r\n\r\nTerrorism  can  be used as a basis for mutual  assistance\r\n\r\nand   extradition  with  another  state  party   to   the\r\n\r\nConvention  without  the  need for  a  bilateral  treaty.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, clause 32 of the Bill empowers the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Law  to make an order to apply the Mutual Assistance\r\n\r\nin   Criminal  Matters  Act  to  a  state  party  to  the\r\n\r\nConvention  so as to allow assistance to be  rendered  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  investigation or prosecution of a  terrorism\r\n\r\nfinancing  offence.   Hence,  all  the  requirements  for\r\n\r\nMutual  Assistance  in Criminal Matters  Act  will  apply\r\n\r\nexcept  for  the requirement of a treaty.  The assistance\r\n\r\nthat  is  rendered  may  be  subject  to  conditions   or\r\n\r\nexceptions  in  the order that is made under  the  Mutual\r\n\r\nAssistance  in Criminal Matters Act.  The Convention  can\r\n\r\nalso  be  treated as an extradition treaty in respect  of\r\n\r\nterrorism   financing  offences  between  Singapore   and\r\n\r\nanother  state party to the Convention.  This is  similar\r\n\r\nto  the  Hijacking of Aircraft and Protection of Aircraft\r\n\r\nand International Airports Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Jurisdiction (Part VI of the Bill)</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, terrorism is essentially a transnational crime.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot deal with terrorism effectively if we  do  not\r\n\r\ncooperate  with other nations, or if we have powers  only\r\n\r\nto  deal  with offences committed within Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nConvention  thus  requires states to prosecute  offenders\r\n\r\nwho  cannot  be extradited.  Part VI of the  Bill  covers\r\n\r\nextra-territorial jurisdiction.  Specifically, clause  34\r\n\r\nprovides  for extra-territorial jurisdiction for offences\r\n\r\nunder  clauses 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill that are  committed\r\n\r\noutside Singapore by Singaporeans or any person.  Where a\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen  commits an offence  relating  to  the\r\n\r\ndealing  with terrorist property or failure  to  disclose\r\n\r\ninformation, he may be dealt with as if the  offence  had\r\n\r\nbeen committed in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Miscellaneous (Part VII of the Bill)</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill also covers other\r\n\r\nmiscellaneous  areas  under Part VII  of  the  Bill,  eg,\r\n\r\nclause 35 which is a standard provision on the commission\r\n\r\nof  an  offence by a corporation to prevent  anyone  from\r\n\r\nseeking refuge behind corporations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 37 of the Bill empowers the Minister to amend\r\n\r\nthe  Schedule by an order published in the Gazette.   The\r\n\r\nBill  contains  a  Schedule on actions  which  constitute\r\n\r\nterrorist  acts, such as an act constituting  an  offence\r\n\r\nunder  the  Hijacking  of  Aircraft  and  Protection   of\r\n\r\nAircraft  and  International Airports Act.  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nnot  yet  a signatory to all the treaties and Conventions\r\n\r\nrelating to terrorism.  As and when we become a party  to\r\n\r\nthese  treaties and Conventions, we can  add  on  to  the\r\n\r\nSchedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 38 of the Bill allows that the Minister may\r\n\r\nalso make regulations for the purpose of carrying out  or\r\n\r\ngiving  effect  to  the provisions  of  the  Bill.   This\r\n\r\nprovides  the  Minister  the flexibility  to  take  quick\r\n\r\naction against terrorist financing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 39 makes a related amendment to the\r\n\r\nMonetary  Authority of Singapore Act to  repeal  and  re-enact section 27A so as to empower the Authority to  make\r\n\r\nregulations concerning any financial institution or class\r\n\r\nof  financial  institutions in  order  to  discharge  any\r\n\r\nobligation  binding on Singapore by virtue of a  decision\r\n\r\nof the Security Council of the United Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill is testimony of\r\n\r\nSingapore's commitment to the international fight against\r\n\r\nterrorism.  Once the Bill is passed, we will take actions\r\n\r\nin  accordance  with it.  We are playing a  cat-and-mouse\r\n\r\ngame  with  the  terrorists; they  will  be  looking  for\r\n\r\nloopholes  to  exploit, even as we take measures  against\r\n\r\nthem.  We will monitor the effectiveness of the Bill, and\r\n\r\nfine tune it further if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, terrorism has to\r\n\r\nbe fought on many fronts, not least of all, the financial\r\n\r\nfront.   To  deprive terrorists of funds would ultimately\r\n\r\nlead  to  the saving of lives and properties.   There  is\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  a great public interest to be  served  here,\r\n\r\nand  I therefore strongly support this Bill.  At the same\r\n\r\ntime,  there must be some care to ensure that  people  or\r\n\r\ninstitutions  are  not  wrongly  accused  of   supporting\r\n\r\nterrorism.   Such accusations must only be  made  on  the\r\n\r\nstrongest  evidence,  as  the  consequences  of  a  wrong\r\n\r\naccusation  may have severe repercussions on  individuals\r\n\r\nor  institutions.  This Bill must therefore be  carefully\r\n\r\nscrutinised in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even defining what is a terrorist is not an easy\r\n\r\nthing.  I would start by looking first at the definitions\r\n\r\nof  \"terrorist\" and \"terrorist act\" in this  Bill.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthe   definition  of  a  \"terrorist\"  in  clause   2   is\r\n\r\ntautologous,  ie, the definition of \"terrorist\"  contains\r\n\r\nthe  word  itself.  Thus, a \"terrorist\"  is  someone  who\r\n\r\ncommits  or  attempts to commit any terrorist  act.   The\r\n\r\ntrue meaning of a terrorist therefore has to be found  in\r\n\r\nwhat  he does or threatens to do, and why he wants to  do\r\n\r\nsuch acts.  This is defined in sub-clause 2.  It involves\r\n\r\nnine types of actions and two types of intents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, with regard to the type of actions. They\r\n\r\ninvolve  the  use of the word \"serious\"  as  in  \"serious\r\n\r\nviolence against a person\", \"serious damage to property\",\r\n\r\nor  \"serious  risk  to the health or the  safety  of  the\r\n\r\npublic\".   I  wonder  whether this  is  too  restrictive.\r\n\r\nAnyone  planning a criminal act that would  amount  to  a\r\n\r\nseizable  offence, with the appropriate intent should,  I\r\n\r\nwould  have thought, be enough to trigger this provision.\r\n\r\nThe  key  difference between a criminal act and one  that\r\n\r\namounts to a terrorist act seems to be in the intent.  If\r\n\r\nthe  act  is one of the nine, done with the intention  to\r\n\r\ninfluence  or  compel  any  government  or  international\r\n\r\norganisation to do or not do something, or to  intimidate\r\n\r\nthe  public or a section of the public, it amounts  to  a\r\n\r\nterrorist  act.   This  is  a good  attempt  at  defining\r\n\r\nterrorist acts, but it requires a great deal of  care  in\r\n\r\ninterpreting or using it.  To take one example,  where  a\r\n\r\ngunman robs a goldsmiths shop,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  puts all those around him in fear - shop assistants,\r\n\r\nmembers of the public nearby, customers - he can actually\r\n\r\nqualify as a terrorist under that definition, because  he\r\n\r\nthreatens serious violence to persons with the intent  to\r\n\r\nintimidate  a section of the public under the definition.\r\n\r\nDoes  that  mean that his property can be forfeited?   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  if  he  robs the shop, intending  to  benefit  a\r\n\r\nterrorist  entity, he is within the definition.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  will  ensure that the definition  will  be\r\n\r\napplied with care, and not misused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the fundamental principles in criminal\r\n\r\njustice  is  the burden and standard of proof.   Everyone\r\n\r\nknows  that the burden on the prosecution is to  prove  a\r\n\r\ncase  beyond reasonable doubt.  The standard  of  \"beyond\r\n\r\nreasonable doubt\" is to ensure the public's confidence in\r\n\r\nthe  administration  of criminal  justice,  that  no  one\r\n\r\nshould  be subjected to punishment without strong  proof.\r\n\r\nThe  Bill  has some provisions that seem to  affect  this\r\n\r\nfundamental principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me say that I agree with the careful\r\n\r\ndrafting   of   clauses  3  to  7,  providing   for   the\r\n\r\nprohibitions    against   the   collection,    provision,\r\n\r\npossession or dealing of property to aid terrorist  acts.\r\n\r\nHere,  the burden on the prosecution is a heavy  one,  to\r\n\r\nprove  beyond reasonable doubt.  There are various  types\r\n\r\nof  intent  - to collect, provide, possess or  deal  with\r\n\r\nproperty  to support or facilitate terrorist acts.   This\r\n\r\nis as it should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I would like to make two other\r\n\r\nreferences to the standard of proof that may give rise to\r\n\r\nconcerns.  The first relates to the power of the Judge to\r\n\r\nforfeit property.  The Judge only has to be satisfied, on\r\n\r\na balance of probabilities, that the property is one that\r\n\r\nis  owned or controlled by the terrorist entity, or  that\r\n\r\nit  is used or about to be used by terrorists, given  the\r\n\r\nseriousness of forfeiture orders, should the standard  of\r\n\r\nproof not be higher?  Forfeiture orders may result in the\r\n\r\nclosure  of  businesses or the eviction of  occupants  in\r\n\r\nproperties  so forfeited.  I would like the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nassure  this  House  that the relevant  authorities  will\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  best  proof  be  provided  before   an\r\n\r\napplication for forfeiture is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade.  This is especially so as the application can be ex\r\n\r\nparte.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue I wish to raise is that clause 35\r\n\r\nprovides  that a partner, director or manager, and  other\r\n\r\ntypes  of employees such as the secretary, may be  guilty\r\n\r\nof  one  or more of the offences if his company, firm  or\r\n\r\nsociety,  is  proved  to  have  committed  one   of   the\r\n\r\nprohibition offences set out in the Bill.  Sir, clause 35\r\n\r\nprovides  that the accused then has to exonerate  himself\r\n\r\nby  proving  that the offence was committed  without  his\r\n\r\nconsent or connivance, and that he had exercised all  due\r\n\r\ndiligence to prevent such an offence.  Sir, this reversal\r\n\r\nof  the  burden of proof is a serious one, affecting  the\r\n\r\npresumption of innocence that our criminal justice system\r\n\r\nis  based  on.   Departures from this principle  must  be\r\n\r\nfully  justified.  I would ask the Minister what are  the\r\n\r\nreasons  for  imposing on directors, managers,  partners,\r\n\r\nsecretaries  and  the like, this burden  of  exoneration.\r\n\r\nAgain,  we  would  want to be extra careful  in  accusing\r\n\r\nanyone  of  aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation.\r\n\r\nI  hope that we will receive assurances from the Minister\r\n\r\nthat  the  utmost care will be taken to obtain  the  best\r\n\r\nevidence  against  individuals  or  institutions   before\r\n\r\nproceedings under this Bill are commenced against them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the September 11 incident has changed the\r\n\r\nworld,   and  significantly  affected  the  attitude   of\r\n\r\neveryone  when  talking about the  dangers  of  terrorist\r\n\r\nattacks.   We must however not be paranoid, and  we  must\r\n\r\nguard  against  those  who might take  advantage  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  fear  and  paranoia  to  harm  others  by  false\r\n\r\naccusations.   I regret that while there  is  a  duty  on\r\n\r\neveryone  to  disclose what they suspect to be  financial\r\n\r\noperations  in  aid of terrorism, there is  no  provision\r\n\r\nthat  would  make it a criminal offence  for  someone  to\r\n\r\nfalsely   and   maliciously  accuse   another   of   such\r\n\r\nactivities.  The Bill does provide for the protection  of\r\n\r\nthose  who  made genuine disclosures, even  if  mistaken.\r\n\r\nBut  it does not provide for sanctions against those  who\r\n\r\nmight  maliciously  accuse their neighbours  or  business\r\n\r\nopponents of such activities.  I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  like to know what the Minister intends to do about\r\n\r\nsuch cases, if they do occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we now live under the shadow of the terrorists.\r\n\r\nThis  Bill  is  a necessary measure in the  global  fight\r\n\r\nagainst terrorism.  I am sure that this Bill will  be  an\r\n\r\nimportant  addition  to the armoury of  laws  that  would\r\n\r\nprotect Singapore from the terrorists and ensure that  we\r\n\r\nare  not  a  safe harbour for those who are  involved  in\r\n\r\nsupporting or financing such activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, September 11,\r\n\r\n2001  has  left  an  indelible impact  in  the  minds  of\r\n\r\neveryone  of the evils posed by acts of terrorism.   That\r\n\r\nterrorism has gone global is a fact and its very  act  is\r\n\r\nindeed a crime against humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorist threats to the public in Singapore are as\r\n\r\nreal  as the recent discovery of the network in Singapore\r\n\r\nand the neighbouring countries has shown.  All these acts\r\n\r\nof violence can only operate with financial backing.  The\r\n\r\nbigger   the   destruction,  the  bigger  the   financing\r\n\r\ninvolved.   To deal with terrorism effectively,  we  must\r\n\r\ntherefore  strike at its very core, ie, the financing  of\r\n\r\nterrorism.   The  financing  of  terrorist  act  is   the\r\n\r\nlifeline  that  we  will have to  choke  to  disable  any\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  such acts to be initiated.   This  Bill\r\n\r\nrepresents our contribution to global efforts  to  combat\r\n\r\nterrorism.  I have no doubt that the Bill will  have  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of the House.  However, in making laws for  this\r\n\r\npurpose,  we  need to balance the need for  security  and\r\n\r\npreservation of civil liberties.  While in favour of  the\r\n\r\nBill,  there  are certain clauses that seem too  wide  or\r\n\r\nunclear.    The   Bill  imposes  strict   guidelines   on\r\n\r\ndisclosures  in  two  areas, and I  would  like  to  seek\r\n\r\nclarifications  as  they  have  implications  on  persons\r\n\r\nrelated to one another or to suspect.  Take clause  8(1),\r\n\r\naccordingly, anyone in Singapore or outside Singapore who\r\n\r\nhas information pertaining to any transaction or intended\r\n\r\ntransaction belonging to a terrorist suspect  is  obliged\r\n\r\nto disclose such information. What this means is that any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmember  of  the terrorist's immediate family  is  charged\r\n\r\nwith  the obligation of disclosure.  Such family members,\r\n\r\nlike  the spouse, children, parents or siblings, are more\r\n\r\nlikely  than  not  to have knowledge of  the  terrorist's\r\n\r\naffairs.  Would such persons therefore be more likely  to\r\n\r\nbe  subject  to  prosecution for breach of  the  duty  of\r\n\r\ndisclosure?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds us of the chaos created during the\r\n\r\nCultural  Revolution in China, where family members  were\r\n\r\nobliged to tell on one another.  The distrust and discord\r\n\r\nsown  as  a  result of such legislation could lead  to  a\r\n\r\nbreakdown  of  the  family system.   Would  Singapore  be\r\n\r\nheading  towards such an eventuality if  this  Bill  were\r\n\r\npassed  without a review on its implications?   Would  it\r\n\r\nnot  be  better for us to work on the responsibility  and\r\n\r\nconscience of persons to be discerning in these areas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other concern is that imposing a duty of\r\n\r\ndisclosure on any Singapore citizen outside Singapore may\r\n\r\nbe  stretching  the  clause too  wide.   Would  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  overseas be exposed to peril?  If  a  terrorist\r\n\r\nknew that a particular Singapore citizen, say, in London,\r\n\r\nhad   information  about  his  transaction  or   proposed\r\n\r\ntransaction regarding any property belonging  to  him  or\r\n\r\nhis  terrorist organisation, what would the terrorist  do\r\n\r\nwith this Singapore citizen in light of this clause?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 on `Search and Seizure' raises a concern.\r\n\r\nThe  proviso permits a Judge, upon the application of the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General,  to  issue a  warrant  authorising  any\r\n\r\nperson  (usually a Police Officer) to search any building\r\n\r\nand  seize  any  property  which  the  authorised  person\r\n\r\nreasonably  believes may be the subject of  an  order  of\r\n\r\nforfeiture.   What  is  worrying is  that  the  Attorney-General  may  make  such  an application  based  on  mere\r\n\r\ninformation and belief.  The question is, to what  extent\r\n\r\ncan  the  Attorney-General rely on mere  information  and\r\n\r\nbelief?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proviso in clause 21 authorises the Attorney-General to apply to a Judge to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforfeit any property owned or controlled by or on  behalf\r\n\r\nof  a  terrorist  or  a  terrorist organisation,  or  any\r\n\r\nproperty  that has been or will be used to facilitate  or\r\n\r\ncarry out a terrorist act.  The concern here is that  the\r\n\r\nJudge  orders  the  property  to  be  forfeited  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   if  he  is  satisfied,  on  a   balance   of\r\n\r\nprobabilities,  that  the property  falls  within  clause\r\n\r\n21(a)  or  21(b).  One would have thought that  a  higher\r\n\r\nstandard  of  proof of beyond reasonable doubt  would  be\r\n\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an intervening period from the moment a\r\n\r\nproperty is seized, pursuant to clause 11(1), till it  is\r\n\r\nforfeited,   pursuant  to  clause  24(1).    During   the\r\n\r\nintervening  period,  a  Judge, at  the  request  of  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General, may appoint a person  to  take  control\r\n\r\nof,   manage   or   deal  with  the  forfeited   property\r\n\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is disturbing to note that the person so\r\n\r\nappointed  has  the power to destroy property  which  has\r\n\r\nlittle or no value.  Whilst we can appreciate the need to\r\n\r\nsell  property  that is perishable, I am of  the  opinion\r\n\r\nthat no one should have the power to destroy property  of\r\n\r\nlittle  or no value unless it is ordered by the Judge  to\r\n\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16(5) empowers a Judge to order the\r\n\r\ndestruction of any property if he is satisfied  that  the\r\n\r\nproperty  has little or no financial or other  value.   I\r\n\r\nbeg  to  ask what constitutes the extent of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAlso,  what  constitutes a balance of probabilities  and,\r\n\r\nfor  that  matter,  what is meant by  \"beyond  reasonable\r\n\r\ndoubt\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose an amendment to clause 28 as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sub-clause (c), perhaps we could add a new sub-clause (d) as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(d) any property seized, restrained or controlled\r\n\r\nin  accordance  with sub-sections (a) to (c),  which  may\r\n\r\nbear  interest  shall  be  held in  an  interest  bearing\r\n\r\naccount; and the interest accruing on the property  shall\r\n\r\nbe added to it on its release or forfeiture.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the basic objectives of the\r\n\r\nproposed Bill are admirable and deserving of our support.\r\n\r\nHowever, we must not in our enthusiasm to deal with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nterrorism  fail  to  guard against any  provisions  which\r\n\r\nimpinge on the protection for the common folks.  In other\r\n\r\nwords, we ought to ensure that the provisions in the Bill\r\n\r\nmust also give adequate protection to the common man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps one of the most important aspects of the\r\n\r\nBill  is the definition of the word \"terrorism\" or,  more\r\n\r\nspecifically,  \"terrorist act\".  Prof. Chin  had  earlier\r\n\r\nalluded  to  the definition and explained the meaning  of\r\n\r\nthe  two limbs encapsulated under clause 2(2)(a).  I take\r\n\r\nit  from  his comments, and even among us, that  we  have\r\n\r\ndifferent ideas of what a terrorist act is.  But I  think\r\n\r\nwe  should not let this difficulty prevent us from making\r\n\r\na  decision, at least for the moment, on what we mean  by\r\n\r\nterrorist act and what we should do about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all do not condone terrorism. If I may say\r\n\r\nso,  even  as  of now, a less severe form of terrorism  - extortion   -  is  an  offence  under  our  Penal   Code.\r\n\r\nTerrorism,  as defined in the Bill, is not  the  way  any\r\n\r\ncivilised entity promotes itself.  If any of us wishes to\r\n\r\ncompel a government to do something, we do it through the\r\n\r\nlegitimate  political process.  If we seek  to  sway  the\r\n\r\nopinion of people, then we have to appeal to their hearts\r\n\r\nand minds, not by using fear of harm or violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, successful civilisations and nations are those\r\n\r\nwhich  are  able  to muster the support of  their  people\r\n\r\nthrough  a  commonly  accepted  political  process.   The\r\n\r\nMongols  in  the 12th century, for instance, were  united\r\n\r\nunder the leadership of Genghis Khan.  As a nation,  they\r\n\r\nshared  a  common vision for themselves, and maybe  their\r\n\r\ncommon  desire for power led them to conquer others.   It\r\n\r\nwould  have  been, I believe, very difficult for  Genghis\r\n\r\nKhan  to  achieve  so  much,  if  he  merely  relied   on\r\n\r\ninstilling  fear in his own people to achieve  his  aims.\r\n\r\nBut,  did he instill fear in other people?  Yes  and  no.\r\n\r\nBut the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresult  showed the difference.  By the time his grandson,\r\n\r\nKublai  Khan,  reigned, the Mongol Empire covered  almost\r\n\r\nthe  whole of mainland Asia and parts of Eastern  Europe.\r\n\r\nIn  places  where  the Mongols embraced  local  political\r\n\r\ncultures,  like China and in Northern India,  the  people\r\n\r\ncontinued  to  make progress.  However, in  places  where\r\n\r\nthey merely plundered in order to subdue, like in Baghdad\r\n\r\nor  Central Europe, the contribution of Mongol  rule  was\r\n\r\neither  miniscule  or negative.  If  the  people  do  not\r\n\r\nwillingly  accept a certain rule or ideology,  very  soon\r\n\r\nthat rule will crumble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of force and fear, Sir, to instill\r\n\r\ncompliance is not mere ancient history.  The totalitarian\r\n\r\nregime in the previous USSR was known to have used, quite\r\n\r\nextensively,  force incursion so as to ensure  acceptance\r\n\r\nof  its ideas.  Dissenters were sent either to the  gulag\r\n\r\nor  some  other remote places or made to simply disappear\r\n\r\nfrom  the records.  More significantly, the fear of  such\r\n\r\nreprisals  caused  a terror among the people.   For  some\r\n\r\ntime, the people bowed and followed but, within 70 years,\r\n\r\nthe USSR crumbled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Control by the state must be pursuant to genuine\r\n\r\nconsensus,  not the other way round, where  consensus  is\r\n\r\npursuant  to  genuine control.  There may  be  groups  of\r\n\r\npeople  who  behave  in a manner so  repugnant  to  one's\r\n\r\nbeliefs  and  values.  But no one has a sacred  right  to\r\n\r\nimpose forcibly on them one's own values and laws by  the\r\n\r\nuse of fear and threat of serious harm.  Even if one does\r\n\r\nso,  the  effect  is always superficial, as  history  has\r\n\r\nshown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Sir, terrorism has no place in promoting any\r\n\r\ncivilisation  or  the  cause of  any  ideology  or  major\r\n\r\nreligion  in  the  world.   There  is  thus  a  need   to\r\n\r\ndistinguish terrorism from other legitimate acts  of  war\r\n\r\nwhich,  I  think, the Bill seeks to do in its  definition\r\n\r\nsection.   The  Bill  excludes  from  the  definition  of\r\n\r\nterrorist  act,  legitimate acts of war  as  governed  by\r\n\r\ninternational law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, war too has its rules. And if we look at\r\n\r\nAlexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Han\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWu Ti, Mohamed, Charlemagne, the wars fought by them were\r\n\r\nin   accordance  with  rules  accepted  by  the   peoples\r\n\r\ninvolved.   That  is  why no one  ever  accused  them  of\r\n\r\nterrorism  before  or  now.   For  instance,  acts  which\r\n\r\ndefinitely  would  harm women, children  and  other  non-military  civilians were and are not legitimate  military\r\n\r\nacts  by  the standard of any civilised society.   It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  important  that we do  not  allow  any  group,\r\n\r\nreligious  or otherwise, to be inspired or encouraged  by\r\n\r\nterrorism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the greater part of humanity abhors terrorism,\r\n\r\nand  must seek ways to curtail it.  I see that this  Bill\r\n\r\nseeks  to do just that, at least in contributing  towards\r\n\r\nour common campaign towards terrorism.  Though it may  be\r\n\r\nargued  that  the  cause of terrorism  is  political  and\r\n\r\nsocial, one of the engines of terrorism is finance.   Our\r\n\r\neffort to deal with the financial aspect of terrorism  is\r\n\r\none of the many prongs that we, as a nation, should apply\r\n\r\nto  effectively  deal  with  this  issue.   The  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity   Act   deals  mainly  with  security   aspects,\r\n\r\nparticularly  with the individuals directly  involved  in\r\n\r\nterrorist    acts.    But   terrorism   today    involves\r\n\r\ninternational network.  Funds and goods are transacted in\r\n\r\nthe process.  The ISA and existing legislation do not say\r\n\r\nmuch  about  this.  So this Bill seeks  to  address  this\r\n\r\nproblem.   In  this  regard,  I  suggest  that  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  and  this House continue to formulate  ways  to\r\n\r\naddress  the  political and social  elements  that  breed\r\n\r\nterrorism,  while  we support this Bill  to  address  the\r\n\r\nissues as promulgated therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely for Singapore to act on suppressing the\r\n\r\nfinancing  of terrorists' activities.  Without access  to\r\n\r\nfunds  or  financial support, it would be more  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  terrorists  to  conduct or  sustain  their  acts  of\r\n\r\nterror.   We  will be tightening the noose  around  their\r\n\r\nactivities,  which  are  most  likely  to  involve   mass\r\n\r\ndestruction and hurt innocent lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill should pose as a deterrence to potential\r\n\r\nwould-be  terrorists  who  intend  to  use  Singapore  to\r\n\r\ntransfer funds or finance terrorists here or elsewhere in\r\n\r\nthe  world.   Through this Bill, we will  send  a  strong\r\n\r\nsignal to those terrorists not to mistake Singapore as  a\r\n\r\nsafe  haven  for their funds.  The Bill also reminds  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  remain  vigilant  and  not   contribute\r\n\r\ninnocently to any terrorist acts indirectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to go into the definition of\r\n\r\n\"terrorism\", which my learned colleague has so eloquently\r\n\r\ncovered  already.  However, I agree with his  definition.\r\n\r\nMay I highlight that terrorist activities usually involve\r\n\r\nlong-term planning and patience.  Their activities may go\r\n\r\nunnoticed for years, and they are masters of substitutes,\r\n\r\nand  might have assimilated into our society as  tenants,\r\n\r\nneighbours,  colleagues  or friends.   Singaporeans  must\r\n\r\nrealise that that is the playing field today, and be more\r\n\r\nvigilant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need not change our lifestyle, but it is\r\n\r\nimportant   that   we  bring  home   the   message   that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  must  not  be complacent.   Terrorism  does\r\n\r\nstrike  at close range, in the region, and right here  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   For  example, it  took  years  to  plan  the\r\n\r\nSeptember 11 disaster that saw the collapse of  the  twin\r\n\r\ntowers  of  the  World  Trade Center,  and  the  loss  of\r\n\r\nthousands  of lives in the United States.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthe  culprits  had  gone unnoticed and undetected  for  a\r\n\r\nwhile  prior to September 11.  There must be hundreds  of\r\n\r\ninnocent people who are now, on hindsight, regretting not\r\n\r\npaying more attention to the hijackers who had led  lives\r\n\r\nalong theirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the years that terrorists planned their acts\r\n\r\nof  terrorism,  many innocent people may  have  concluded\r\n\r\nbusiness dealings with them or may even have rented their\r\n\r\nproperties or have contributed to their acts unknowingly.\r\n\r\nThese   innocent   people  should  not  be   unreasonably\r\n\r\nclassified  as  terrorist sympathisers,  and  have  their\r\n\r\nproperties confiscated under this Bill.  They should  not\r\n\r\nbe  penalised if they were ignorant of the on-going.   In\r\n\r\nenforcing this law, Mr Speaker, Sir, I ask\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  we have to be firm and professional, so as  not  to\r\n\r\nunduly put stress on the business community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Prof. Chin\r\n\r\nsuggested  that the use of the word such as \"serious\"  in\r\n\r\nthe  definition of \"terrorist act\" in the Bill may be too\r\n\r\nrestrictive.  The reasons for this restrictive definition\r\n\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, this is a Bill which gives effect to the\r\n\r\nInternational  Convention  for  the  Suppression  of  the\r\n\r\nFinancing  of Terrorism.  As such, the Bill's  definition\r\n\r\nof  \"terrorist act\" therefore adopts the wording  of  the\r\n\r\nConvention, and they are totally consistent with what  is\r\n\r\nbeing  used in other countries as well.  The Convention's\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"terrorist act\" includes an act intended to\r\n\r\ncause  death or serious bodily injury to a civilian  when\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of such act is to intimidate the  population\r\n\r\nor to compel a government to do or refrain from doing any\r\n\r\nact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Singapore is not alone in adopting such a\r\n\r\ndefinition.  Our definition is also consistent  with  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  used in other countries' similar  legislation\r\n\r\non  terrorism in the Commonwealth countries, such as  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom's  Terrorism  Act  2000,  Canada's  Anti-Terrorism  Act  and  the Australia's Suppression  of  the\r\n\r\nFinancing of Terrorism Bill.  Since this Bill is to  give\r\n\r\neffect to an International Convention, there is no reason\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  deviate  from  the  international  standards\r\n\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, this is also to maintain consistency with\r\n\r\nthe  definition of \"terrorist acts\" used in our own  law,\r\n\r\nand  that  law  is  the  United  Nations  (Anti-Terrorism\r\n\r\nMeasures)  Regulations.  So, all those words we  find  in\r\n\r\nthis  particular  Bill are exactly the same  as  what  we\r\n\r\nalready   have  in  our  United  Nations  (Anti-Terrorism\r\n\r\nMeasures)   Regulations.   We  are  not  doing   anything\r\n\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin has suggested that anyone planning a\r\n\r\ncriminal act which amounts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  a seizable offence should be caught by the definition\r\n\r\nof  \"terrorist  act\".  In my view, to  define  \"terrorist\r\n\r\nact\" to include any seizable criminal offence may be  too\r\n\r\nwide  and  over-inclusive.  We  should  target  our  laws\r\n\r\nagainst   offences  which  clearly  have  a  nexus   with\r\n\r\nterrorism.   Seizable offences, with  reference  to  non-Penal  Code  offences, are offences which are  punishable\r\n\r\nwith imprisonment for a term of three years or more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin has also raised the example of a gunman\r\n\r\nwho  had  robbed  a  goldsmith shop,  and  asked  if  his\r\n\r\nproperty  can  be seized or forfeited.  Let me  reiterate\r\n\r\nthat   the   main  focus  of  this  Bill  is  not   about\r\n\r\ncriminalising terrorist acts, but about criminalising the\r\n\r\nfinancing  of  terrorist  acts.   As  such,  whether  the\r\n\r\nrobber's  property  will  be  forfeited  will  depend  on\r\n\r\nwhether   a  person  who  has  committed  any  of   those\r\n\r\nprovisions  relating to the financing of terrorist  acts.\r\n\r\nA mere commission of a robbery will not make his property\r\n\r\nliable to seizure or forfeiture under the law even if  he\r\n\r\nhad,  in  carrying out robbery, intimidated a section  of\r\n\r\nthe people around the shops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a real life example of this. On 18th\r\n\r\nMay  2001,  members  of the Kumpulan Mujahideen  Malaysia\r\n\r\n(KMM),   staged  a  robbery  of  the  Southern  Bank   in\r\n\r\nPeninsular  Malaysia.   They were initially  regarded  as\r\n\r\nrobbers.   But investigations subsequently revealed  that\r\n\r\ntheir actions were in support of the KMM, which aimed  to\r\n\r\nwage  a  holy  war  against the Malaysian  government  to\r\n\r\nestablish  a purist Islamic state.  Obviously, then  they\r\n\r\nwere  more  than  just  ordinary  robbers.   So,  by  our\r\n\r\ndefinition,  they  will be regarded as  terrorists.   And\r\n\r\nthis is not the only example that happened last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-1970s, three gunmen robbed a bank of\r\n\r\nRM122,000  in  Petaling Jaya.  Later, it was  found  that\r\n\r\nthey  were  also responsible for two murders.   If  these\r\n\r\nwere  all,  then,  of course, those who  were  found  and\r\n\r\nconvicted  subsequently will be convicted as robbers  and\r\n\r\nmurderers.   But when it was established that  they  were\r\n\r\nactually members of the CPM Marxist-Leninist Faction  and\r\n\r\nhad robbed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  augment the CPM's funds, then, obviously,  they  were\r\n\r\nmore  than just ordinary robbers and murderers.  The  two\r\n\r\npersons  they  murdered under the CPM's instruction  were\r\n\r\nthe Inspector General of Police, Tan Sri Abdul Rahman  in\r\n\r\n1974, and the Chief Police Officer of Perak, Tan Sri  Koo\r\n\r\nChong  Kong in 1975.  So, again, by definition under  our\r\n\r\nBill, we will consider them as terrorists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin is correct in asserting that the key\r\n\r\ndifference  between a purely criminal act  and  one  that\r\n\r\namounts to a terrorist act lies much in the intent or the\r\n\r\nmotive  established.   But this  is  not  unique  to  the\r\n\r\ncurrent   Bill.    Intent  is  the  key   ingredient   in\r\n\r\ndetermining culpability, even in purely criminal  actions\r\n\r\nand  offences.   Often,  in  criminal  cases,  there  may\r\n\r\npotentially  be more than one offence in the  laws  which\r\n\r\ncan  apply  to  the  same action  and  the  same  set  of\r\n\r\ncircumstances.   Which one to proceed with  requires  not\r\n\r\nonly  interpretation, but commonsense and judgment.   Let\r\n\r\nme  assure  Prof.  Chin that there is  no  lapse  in  the\r\n\r\nhandling  of  such  situations  in  criminal  cases.   In\r\n\r\ndetermining offences under this particular Bill, the  law\r\n\r\nwill  always be applied with care and due diligence.   We\r\n\r\nwill  always  be very careful, and not simply  abuse  the\r\n\r\npowers provided for in the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of burden, there is indeed a high\r\n\r\nburden  on the prosecution, because the offences  created\r\n\r\nby  the  Convention  and the Bill  are  very  serious  in\r\n\r\nnature.   For example, any person convicted of  providing\r\n\r\nor   collecting  property  for  terrorist  acts  can   be\r\n\r\nsentenced  to imprisonment for up to 10 years,  or  to  a\r\n\r\nfine  of  up to $100,000.  Since the offences are serious\r\n\r\nin  nature,  then we have deliberately only targeted  the\r\n\r\nprovisions   against  persons  who  have   knowingly   or\r\n\r\nintentionally committed such acts.  This will ensure that\r\n\r\nthe   innocent  persons  are  not  prosecuted  for   such\r\n\r\noffences.   But  if there is evidence to  show  that  the\r\n\r\nperson  has turned a blind eye to the commission of  such\r\n\r\nacts, then the same provisions will allow us to prosecute\r\n\r\nhim, as these provisions also contain a lower threshold\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  \"having reasonable grounds to believe\" in cases where\r\n\r\nit  is not possible to prove that the person has wilfully\r\n\r\nor  knowingly committed such acts.  So I think  there  is\r\n\r\nenough  flexibility built into the legislation to  enable\r\n\r\nus   to  deal  effectively  with  the  various  types  of\r\n\r\noffenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin and Mdm Ho, I believe, also expressed\r\n\r\nconcern on the order of forfeiture and the Judge  has  to\r\n\r\nbe  satisfied on the balance of probability, and also the\r\n\r\nquestion  about  ex  parte.  Let me first  clarify  Prof.\r\n\r\nChin's point on ex parte.  The application for the  issue\r\n\r\nof  warrant of seizure or restraint order under clause 11\r\n\r\nis  made ex parte because there is a need to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  offenders do not have a chance to dispose  of  their\r\n\r\nproperties.    But  once  the  property  is   seized   or\r\n\r\nrestrained  under clause 11, the forfeiture  application,\r\n\r\nwhich is made under clause 24, is not made ex parte.  The\r\n\r\nowner  of  the  property will have a right  to  be  heard\r\n\r\nbefore the Judge orders forfeiture of the property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the use of balance of probability as a\r\n\r\nstandard  of proof for forfeiture, this is not  something\r\n\r\nnew  that we are doing.  The same standard is also  found\r\n\r\nunder  the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious\r\n\r\nCrimes  (Confiscation  of Benefits)  Act  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nforfeiture of proceeds derived from drug trafficking  and\r\n\r\nother  serious crimes.  The Bill therefore maintains  the\r\n\r\nsame  standard  of proof for the purpose  of  forfeiture.\r\n\r\nFurther,  this standard on the balance of probability  is\r\n\r\nalso  used in the Canada Anti-Terrorism Act.  So, let  me\r\n\r\nassure the House that, in conducting investigations  into\r\n\r\nthese  offences, the enforcement agencies will strive  to\r\n\r\nobtain the best evidence to support the allegations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the onus imposed on corporate bodies,\r\n\r\nwhich  is also a question raised by Mr Andy Gan, to  make\r\n\r\nsure that we do not unnecessarily restrict the businesses\r\n\r\nof  our companies, clause 35, as we have put it there, is\r\n\r\na  standard provision commonly found in the existing Acts\r\n\r\nas well.  It is not something that we just created out of\r\n\r\nnowhere.   A  body  corporate can only  act  through  its\r\n\r\nofficers.  It is not unreasonable therefore to expect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nofficers  of a body corporate to be responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nacts  of  a company, such that the officers must give  an\r\n\r\naccount  of themselves if the company commits an offence.\r\n\r\nLet  me  give  Members examples of similar provisions  in\r\n\r\nother  legislation.  They are the Electricity  Act  2001,\r\n\r\nthe  Gas  Act  2001, the Planning Act, the Civil  Defence\r\n\r\nAct, the Building Control Act, the Control of Vectors and\r\n\r\nPesticides  Act and, finally, the Fire Safety  Act.   So,\r\n\r\nthis  question of duty of the corporate officers is  also\r\n\r\nclearly defined in other similar legislation that I  have\r\n\r\njust cited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin is concerned about people who make\r\n\r\nmalicious     complaints,    leading    to    unnecessary\r\n\r\ninvestigations  and the accused party  suffering  anxiety\r\n\r\nand  stress.  Although the Bill does not provide for  the\r\n\r\noffence  of  malicious accusation, this is not  different\r\n\r\nfrom,  say, defaming a person.  The person so defamed  or\r\n\r\naccused  can always sue the person making the  defamatory\r\n\r\nstatement or accusation.  If the accusation is made to  a\r\n\r\npolice  officer,  then the accuser can  also  be  charged\r\n\r\nunder  the Penal Code.  For example, section 182  of  the\r\n\r\nPenal  Code makes an offence for any person to  give  any\r\n\r\npublic  servant  any  information to  cause  such  public\r\n\r\nservant  to  use  the  lawful powers  to  the  injury  or\r\n\r\nannoyance of any person.  A person who is convicted under\r\n\r\nsection 182 can be sentenced to imprisonment, as well  as\r\n\r\nto  a  fine.   So,  if  a person falsely  or  maliciously\r\n\r\nreported his neighbour for committing a terrorist act  or\r\n\r\nactivity to a police officer, he can be dealt with  under\r\n\r\nthe  Penal  Code,  and  there is  no  need  to  put  this\r\n\r\nprovision  in  the Bill.  The Penal Code is  adequate  to\r\n\r\ndeal with such offenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to some of the points raised by Mdm\r\n\r\nHo.   Mdm Ho's view is that we are placing too much  onus\r\n\r\non the family members, like the spouse, children, parents\r\n\r\nor siblings, because, she says, they are more likely than\r\n\r\nnot  to have knowledge of the terrorist affairs.   But  I\r\n\r\nthink  this is debatable.  Let me give an example of  the\r\n\r\nJemaah  Islamiyah  group.  Many of their  family  members\r\n\r\nactually  claimed that they did not know.  So  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink it is fair to say that their spouse\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  immediate  family members will definitely  know,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  if they report the matter, it may  lead  to  a\r\n\r\nbreak-up  of  families,  like  in  the  case  during  the\r\n\r\nCultural Revolution.  I think the problem of the Cultural\r\n\r\nRevolution is a totally different one.  I do not think we\r\n\r\nshould  just simply leave things be and leave it  to  the\r\n\r\nconscience and the sense of responsibility of individuals\r\n\r\nto  report a terrorist act or financing of such act,  and\r\n\r\nnot  put  this  into the law.  If everybody  does  behave\r\n\r\nresponsibly and acts with conscience, I think we  do  not\r\n\r\nneed any laws.  We will then be living in utopia.  But we\r\n\r\nknow  that  we are living on the earth.  So it cannot  be\r\n\r\ndone.   Therefore, it is better that we provide for  this\r\n\r\nin  the  legislation to ensure that if family members  do\r\n\r\nknow,  and  it can be seen and shown that they  do  know,\r\n\r\nthen  it  is  their duty to make such  a  report  to  the\r\n\r\nPolice.   But, of course, in the investigation, we  shall\r\n\r\nbe thorough about this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho's suggestion to exempt information received\r\n\r\nbecause  of  privileged information, eg, in the  case  of\r\n\r\nlawyers, I do not think this is necessary because  clause\r\n\r\n8(4) of the Bill provides that it shall be a defence  for\r\n\r\na  person  charged  for  failure to  prove  that  he  has\r\n\r\nreasonable  excuse for not making the disclosure  and  it\r\n\r\nshall  be  left to the court to decide on the  merits  of\r\n\r\neach case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho also asked what extent the Attorney-General\r\n\r\nrely  on  information and belief to apply to a  Judge  to\r\n\r\nissue  seizure and search warrants, and she asked if  the\r\n\r\nburden  of  proof should be higher than  the  balance  of\r\n\r\nprobability, and whether a conviction of terrorism should\r\n\r\nbe  made first before forfeiture should take place.   Her\r\n\r\nview  is  that  no one should have the power  to  destroy\r\n\r\nproperty  of little or no value unless it is  ordered  by\r\n\r\nthe  Judge  to  do  so.   She also proposes  that  seized\r\n\r\nproperty  which may bear interest be held in an interest-bearing account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address her questions in sequence. Clause 12\r\n\r\nof  the Bill provides that an affidavit in support of the\r\n\r\napplication  for  a  warrant of  search  and  seizure  of\r\n\r\nterrorist  property  may  be  made  by  an  investigation\r\n\r\nofficer  based  on his information and belief,  and  such\r\n\r\ninformation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand belief are the result of investigations conducted  by\r\n\r\nthe  investigation officer, who would most likely be  the\r\n\r\npolice officer or a Commercial Affairs officer.  He would\r\n\r\nnot  act just because he had a dream the night before and\r\n\r\nsaid, \"I believe and, therefore, I act.\"  They do not act\r\n\r\nlike  that.  I do not think we can allow him to act  like\r\n\r\nthat  too.  So he must conduct an investigation and  show\r\n\r\nthat there are indeed reasonable grounds for his belief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Attorney-General, therefore, does not rely on\r\n\r\nhearsay  or mere information received.  He will  ask  the\r\n\r\ninvestigation  officer,  \"What  have  you  found  in  the\r\n\r\ninvestigation?\" and satisfy him before he applies to  the\r\n\r\ncourt for the issuance of a search and seizure warrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House may wish to note that clause 11 of the\r\n\r\nBill provides that the court may require undertakings  to\r\n\r\nbe  given  in  respect  of application  for  warrants  or\r\n\r\nrestraint order, and the undertaking is a form  of  check\r\n\r\nto  prevent  any  abuse of powers.  The indemnity  is  to\r\n\r\nensure that the law enforcement agencies investigating  a\r\n\r\ncase  must have sufficient grounds before applying for  a\r\n\r\nwarrant for seizure or a restraint order.  So he does not\r\n\r\njust act on impulse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof based on the balance of probability is the\r\n\r\nstandard  employed under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking\r\n\r\nand  Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits)  Act\r\n\r\nfor the forfeiture of properties or proceeds derived from\r\n\r\ndrug  trafficking  and other serious crimes.   The  Bill,\r\n\r\ntherefore, maintains the same standard of proof  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of forfeiture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 of the Bill allows a Judge to order\r\n\r\nforfeiture  of  property owned or  controlled  by  or  on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of any terrorist or terrorist entity.  The  order\r\n\r\nof  forfeiture may also be made if the property has  been\r\n\r\nor  will  be used to facilitate or carry out a  terrorist\r\n\r\nact.   There is no requirement to have a conviction first\r\n\r\nof  the offences of providing or collecting property  for\r\n\r\nterrorist  acts,  providing  property  and  services  for\r\n\r\nterrorist purposes, use or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossession of property for terrorist purposes and dealing\r\n\r\nwith  property  of  terrorists.   This  is  because   the\r\n\r\nintention is to ensure that terrorist properties  can  be\r\n\r\nconfiscated by the Government.  But let me assure Members\r\n\r\nthat strong evidence will be adduced before the Attorney-General applies to a Judge for such a forfeiture order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 of the Bill also allows a person appointed\r\n\r\nto  destroy  seized  properties that have  little  or  no\r\n\r\nvalue.  But the person must first apply to the Judge  for\r\n\r\nthe  destruction order.  In other words,  he  cannot  say\r\n\r\nthat,  \"I  do not like this thing lying on my desk\",  and\r\n\r\nthen  he starts to destroy it.

TDB fulfills its mission primarily through broad-based  programmes, such as organising trade missions  and\r\n\r\nfairs,  and  helping companies navigate  through  foreign\r\n\r\nbureaucracies via its overseas trade offices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Singapore is the 16th largest trading nation\r\n\r\nin  the  world.   Our exports have quadrupled  from  S$50\r\n\r\nbillion  in 1985 to S$218 billion in 2001.  Our  external\r\n\r\ntrade  is  three  times the size of  our  GDP.   We  have\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  evolved from an entrepot base  serving  the\r\n\r\nregion, to an international hub for trade and commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore embarks on a new phase of economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  we  can  no longer rely  solely  on  inward\r\n\r\nforeign investments to propel our economic growth.   Many\r\n\r\nof   our   competitors  have  begun  adopting  the   same\r\n\r\nstrategies  to  attract investments, and  they  are  fast\r\n\r\nnarrowing  the lead we enjoy.  At the same time,  we  are\r\n\r\nencumbered by the tarnishing of Southeast Asia's image as\r\n\r\nan  attractive investment destination, and  its  loss  of\r\n\r\ninvestor mind-share to the economies of Northeast Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To overcome these challenges, we need to broaden and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  our  base  of local enterprises,  to  provide\r\n\r\nadded  ballast to our economy.  We need to build  vibrant\r\n\r\nand  robust  local  companies  which  can  serve  as  our\r\n\r\nadditional  engines  of growth.  In order  to  grow,  our\r\n\r\ncompanies must venture overseas, given our small domestic\r\n\r\nmarket.   We  should  therefore  help  them  develop  the\r\n\r\ncapabilities, connections and access to capital that they\r\n\r\nneed to spread their wings overseas.  In other words, our\r\n\r\naim  should  be  to  develop  a  corps  of  enterprising,\r\n\r\ncompetitive International Singapore Companies (ISCs)  who\r\n\r\nwill  have  their  home  bases and core  capabilities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  while  expanding and  establishing  a  strong\r\n\r\npresence in the region and beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this objective, TDB has been given a new\r\n\r\nmission  to  help  Singapore-based  companies  grow   and\r\n\r\ninternationalise successfully.  To reflect this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew mission, it has been renamed International Enterprise\r\n\r\nSingapore  or \"IE Singapore\", since 1st April  2002.   IE\r\n\r\nSingapore  is now the primary economic agency  overseeing\r\n\r\nthe  growth of our external wing.  It will help our local\r\n\r\nenterprises   upgrade  their  capabilities   to   compete\r\n\r\ninternationally,  develop their access to  marketing  and\r\n\r\ndistribution networks, and help them gain deep  knowledge\r\n\r\nand  intelligence about overseas markets.   It  will  re-engineer  its major activities, from offering basic-level\r\n\r\nmarket information to providing value-adding intelligence\r\n\r\nand  capability development programmes;  from  organising\r\n\r\nbroad-based  programmes to providing customised  help  to\r\n\r\nenterprises;   and  from  generating  trade   volume   to\r\n\r\nstrengthening enterprises' home bases in Singapore  while\r\n\r\nthey develop their overseas markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IE Singapore has also taken over from SPRING\r\n\r\nSingapore  the responsibility of helping our SMEs  expand\r\n\r\noverseas.   As  part  of  this effort,  it  will  promote\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  an SME-hub by attracting enterprises  from\r\n\r\nthe  US, European Union, Japan and other countries to  be\r\n\r\nbased here, so that they can collaborate with Singapore's\r\n\r\nISCs to venture into the region.  These new functions  go\r\n\r\nbeyond  the  former  TDB's  traditional  role  in   trade\r\n\r\npromotion.  However, as trading is the first step towards\r\n\r\ninternationalisation,  IE  Singapore  will  continue   to\r\n\r\npromote  and  develop  the trade  sector,  including  hub\r\n\r\nservices like shipping, marketing and distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the TDB Act thus reflect the new\r\n\r\nname,  and  the  enlargement of the mandate,  powers  and\r\n\r\nfunctions of IE Singapore.

It also  allows\r\n\r\nIE Singapore to enter into memoranda of understanding and\r\n\r\nother  similar arrangements with foreign partners.   This\r\n\r\nwill  enable  the  Board  to gather  and  share  valuable\r\n\r\ninformation  about overseas markets with the ISCs,  which\r\n\r\nis crucial to aiding their expansion abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendments to the TDB\r\n\r\nAct  will  allow IE Singapore to expand its  work  beyond\r\n\r\ntrade  promotion,  and  to  focus  on  the  three  Cs   - Competency, Connections and Capital needed by  companies.\r\n\r\nIE  Singapore  will help companies build competencies  in\r\n\r\nbusiness    processes   like   strategy   and   planning,\r\n\r\ninternational marketing, manpower development,  financial\r\n\r\nmanagement,  as well as market information and  analysis.\r\n\r\nIE   Singapore   will  provide  companies  the   business\r\n\r\nopportunities   through   its   extensive   network    of\r\n\r\ninternational  connections.  It will also help  companies\r\n\r\ngain  access  to a wider range of financing  options  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  venture abroad.  Through all these initiatives,\r\n\r\nIE  Singapore  aims to help many of our  promising  local\r\n\r\ncompanies  become  tomorrow's world-class  champions,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can  contribute to a strong  and  sustainable\r\n\r\ngrowth in the next phase of our economic development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the change\r\n\r\nof  name to International Enterprise Singapore Board from\r\n\r\nTrade  Development Board reflects the true nature of  the\r\n\r\nBoard  -  that of enhancing Singapore's competitive  edge\r\n\r\nover   other  countries,  assisting  Singapore  companies\r\n\r\nmoving  abroad,  and building up of an extensive  network\r\n\r\nlinking    Singapore   businesses   to   their    foreign\r\n\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International trade normally takes place when there\r\n\r\nare competitive advantages in doing so.  For example,  if\r\n\r\ncountry  A  can produce electrical products cheaper  than\r\n\r\ncountry  B,  it would be logical for trade to take  place\r\n\r\nbetween  the  two countries.  However, if country  B  has\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  who  can invest in country  A  to  produce\r\n\r\nthose electrical goods and export them back to country  B\r\n\r\nand other parts of the world, then country B will benefit\r\n\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, IE Singapore Board should expand its role and\r\n\r\ndo this beyond just assisting Singapore-based enterprises\r\n\r\nfind  new  markets  abroad  and compete  internationally.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  am  glad  to  hear  the  Minister  has  just\r\n\r\nmentioned   that  we  are  also  assisting   in   capital\r\n\r\nprovision,  which  is  of  great advantage  to  companies\r\n\r\nmoving abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IE Singapore should also assist Singapore companies\r\n\r\nidentify  potential  areas  of development  in  different\r\n\r\ncountries,  taking  advantage of that country's  strength\r\n\r\nand  exporting  these goods back to Singapore  and  other\r\n\r\nplaces in the world.  It could perhaps play the role of a\r\n\r\nmatch-maker and marry related Singapore enterprises so as\r\n\r\nto  make  strategic investments in a second country  with\r\n\r\nthe purpose of securing a line of supply for a series  of\r\n\r\nproducts that Singapore needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are all well aware, China is an emerging\r\n\r\nmarket.   Its  vastness means that there  are  sufficient\r\n\r\nopportunities  for everyone.  However, China's  emergence\r\n\r\nhas   also   altered  the  dynamics   of   the   business\r\n\r\nenvironment.  We cannot ignore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  changes.   We  need to bring on  a  new  corporate\r\n\r\nmindset as we compete with some of the best in the  world\r\n\r\nto  carve  out a niche of our own.  I read with  interest\r\n\r\nthe success story of Singapore media group SNP Panpac  in\r\n\r\nLiaoning province in China published in the Straits Times\r\n\r\non  6th July 2002.  In less than two years, it has opened\r\n\r\nup  a market for its bilingual teaching books.  With  the\r\n\r\nnew  defined  role  of  the  IE  Singapore  Board,  I  am\r\n\r\nconfident  that  there  will be many  more  such  success\r\n\r\nstories.   Perhaps,  IE Singapore can  look  at  how  the\r\n\r\nnetworks  built  up  by Panpac in Liaoning  educationists\r\n\r\ncould   further  be  capitalised  and  introduce  related\r\n\r\nservices linked to those existing partnerships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major functions of IE Singapore is to\r\n\r\npromote,  facilitate  and regulate  forward  and  futures\r\n\r\ntrading  in  rubber  and other commodities.   It  may  be\r\n\r\ntimely  now  to  rethink Singapore's role in  rubber  and\r\n\r\ncommodity trading.  As most local rubber dealers are  not\r\n\r\nlarge  enough  to be market makers, and as  producers  of\r\n\r\nlatex  and  rubber sheets are bypassing  them  and  going\r\n\r\ndirect  to buy, say, for example, the tyre makers,  would\r\n\r\nit  then  be  necessary now for Singapore  to  invest  in\r\n\r\nrubber plantations abroad?  It is indeed necessary, as  I\r\n\r\ncan  see  it,  so  as to ensure a steady supply  of  good\r\n\r\nquality   rubber   for  our  rubber  traders   to   quote\r\n\r\ncompetitive  prices,  and  for Singapore  to  expand  its\r\n\r\ninvestment  abroad  in  plantations,  instead   of   just\r\n\r\ninvesting  the  money  in the Singapore  rubber  fund  on\r\n\r\nsecurities.    To   distinguish   Singapore   from    our\r\n\r\ncompetitors,  it  is necessary for us  to  re-focus,  and\r\n\r\nperhaps accept more risks in our ventures abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Andy\r\n\r\nGan  brought  up two points, ie, in terms  of  capability\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and cluster developments.

IE\r\n\r\nSingapore   would  groom  ISCs  by  offering   customised\r\n\r\nassistance  at  each  stage  of the  internationalisation\r\n\r\nprocess.  IE Singapore has created a new department known\r\n\r\nas  the Capability Development Group which will focus  on\r\n\r\nthe following areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, building up companies' business\r\n\r\ncapabilities.

To support the\r\n\r\ninternationalisation of companies to successful partners,\r\n\r\nIE Singapore would create and facilitate on-line and off-line  international networking platforms.   IE  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  also  encourage foreign enterprises to  locate  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   for  business  partnerships  with   Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, helping companies to raise funds for\r\n\r\noverseas  ventures  and manage the financial  risks.   IE\r\n\r\nSingapore would provide programmes to raise awareness  on\r\n\r\nvarious  financing  options and  help  companies  develop\r\n\r\nfinancial strategies to venture abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the clusters specifically, in terms of industry\r\n\r\nclusters,  IE  Singapore  is currently  focusing  on  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  six technology business:  lifestyle  business,\r\n\r\ninfrastructure business, business services, international\r\n\r\ntrading and trade logistics.

Its focus then was  on  three\r\n\r\nkey  areas:  productivity; standards and  metrology,  and\r\n\r\nsmall and medium enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 20 years, PSB has spearheaded the\r\n\r\nnation-wide  Productivity Movement as a key part  of  our\r\n\r\neconomic  strategy.  Going forward, there is a  continued\r\n\r\nneed  to champion productivity, as it will determine  how\r\n\r\ncompetitive we are, and how fast our living standards can\r\n\r\nrise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as Singapore progresses from an investment-driven to an innovation-driven economy, we should refocus\r\n\r\nour  productivity strategy.  The emphasis has  to  be  on\r\n\r\nincreasing  Total  Factor Productivity  (TFP),  in  other\r\n\r\nwords, getting increases in output through better use  of\r\n\r\nresources  and  better  ways  of  organising  firms'  and\r\n\r\nindustries' operations. There is a limit to how  much  we\r\n\r\ncan    raise   productivity   through   greater   capital\r\n\r\ninvestments  alone.   While  capital  investments  remain\r\n\r\ncritical for economic growth, gains in productivity  will\r\n\r\nincreasingly   come   from   new   ideas   and    quality\r\n\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSB has thus revised its mission to focus on\r\n\r\nincreasing our TFP by promoting innovation.  It will help\r\n\r\nour  workers  and enterprises build up their capabilities\r\n\r\nto  innovate  and  create higher value.   PSB  will  help\r\n\r\nupgrade  our domestic non-tradable sectors to  make  them\r\n\r\nmore   productive  and  resilient.   It  will  also   pay\r\n\r\nparticular  attention  to the development  of  our  local\r\n\r\nSMEs,  whose productivity lags significantly  behind  the\r\n\r\nlarger companies in Singapore, as well as that of SMEs in\r\n\r\nthe  developed countries. In addition, PSB will  continue\r\n\r\nto promote standards and quality to enhance productivity,\r\n\r\nto   ensure   product  safety,  and  to  promote   market\r\n\r\nrecognition and acceptance of our products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSB's new name, SPRING Singapore, encapsulates these\r\n\r\nchanges in its mission and functions.

Section 5(1) of  the  current\r\n\r\nAct  stipulates that the Board shall consist  of  members\r\n\r\nrepresenting the interests of the Government,  employers,\r\n\r\ntrade  unions,  professional and academic  staff  of  the\r\n\r\ninstitutions of higher learning in Singapore.   Clause  6\r\n\r\namends  this section to allow Board members to  come  not\r\n\r\nonly  from these bodies, but also from any other  sectors\r\n\r\nor  classes  of persons, such as the business  community.\r\n\r\nThis will provide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility in the selection and appointment  of\r\n\r\nBoard members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 amends section 42(3) to increase the\r\n\r\nmaximum penalty for offences under regulations made under\r\n\r\nthe  Act.   It  raises the maximum fine  from  $5,000  to\r\n\r\n$10,000, and the maximum imprisonment term from 6  months\r\n\r\nto  2  years.  This is principally aimed at aligning  the\r\n\r\npenalty  for  non-compliance  (by  conformity  assessment\r\n\r\nbodies)  in  the  testing  and assessment  of  controlled\r\n\r\ngoods, with the penalty under the Consumer Protection Act\r\n\r\nfor  the supply of non-registered controlled goods.  Both\r\n\r\noffences  result in the same consequence,  that  is,  the\r\n\r\nsupply  of  unsafe controlled goods, but at  present  the\r\n\r\npenalties  under  the PSB Act are much  less  than  those\r\n\r\nunder the Consumer Protection Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendments to the PSB\r\n\r\nAct  address  the  fundamental  need  for  Singapore   to\r\n\r\nprogress  up  the  innovation ladder in order  to  remain\r\n\r\ncompetitive.  We need to help local SMEs, in  particular,\r\n\r\nto  anticipate  and  adapt  to emerging  trends,  discard\r\n\r\nmodels and practices that have outlived their usefulness,\r\n\r\nand  reinvent  themselves.  We need to  usher  in  a  new\r\n\r\nSPRING  of  fresh  ideas, new capabilities  and  creative\r\n\r\ninitiatives   in  the  workplace  and  in  the   business\r\n\r\nenvironment,  in order to propel our economy  to  greater\r\n\r\nheights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ANIMALS AND BIRDS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</b> Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Animals and Birds Act was enacted in 1965 to\r\n\r\nconsolidate the various legislation relating to  animals.\r\n\r\nIt  contains legislation to prevent the introduction  and\r\n\r\nspreading  of  animal and bird diseases, to  control  the\r\n\r\nimport  and  export  of  animals and  birds,  to  prevent\r\n\r\ncruelty  to animals, control livestock products,  and  to\r\n\r\nregulate the use of veterinary biologics.  This  Act  has\r\n\r\nnot  undergone any major review since its enactment.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  proposed this Bill for  the  purposes  of,\r\n\r\nfirstly, to enhance the prevention and control of animal,\r\n\r\nbird  and  fish diseases; secondly, the strengthening  of\r\n\r\nthe  provisions for the prevention of animal cruelty; and\r\n\r\nthirdly, improving the operational efficiency of the Agri-Food  and  Veterinary  Authority  in  administering   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  this  Act.  I shall now  go  through  and\r\n\r\nexplain the rationale of the main features of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhance  the  prevention and control of animal  and  bird diseases</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is always a potential risk, although\r\n\r\ngenerally remote, for a disease agent present in animals,\r\n\r\nbirds and fishes, to develop an ability to infect humans.\r\n\r\nIn  recent  years, there have been reports world-wide  of\r\n\r\noutbreaks  of  animal  diseases that  can  be  passed  to\r\n\r\nhumans,  such as the Mad Cow Disease, the Avian Bird  Flu\r\n\r\nand  the  Nipah  Virus  Disease  found  in  pigs.   These\r\n\r\ndiseases  pose  a threat to public health.   Also,  there\r\n\r\nhave  been  outbreaks of other animal diseases,  such  as\r\n\r\nFoot  and Mouth Disease, which do not affect humans,  but\r\n\r\ncould nevertheless have a significant impact on trade  in\r\n\r\nanimals,   birds  and  their  products.    Singapore   is\r\n\r\ncurrently  free from such diseases, but  we  need  to  be\r\n\r\nvigilant  and  alert  to keep these  and  other  emerging\r\n\r\nthreats at bay.  This Bill strengthens the provisions for\r\n\r\ndisease  prevention,  control and  detection,  so  as  to\r\n\r\nenable the AVA to deal with animal-related diseases  more\r\n\r\neffectively  and  promptly.  Let me  elaborate  on  these\r\n\r\namendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a major international trading hub for\r\n\r\naquatic animals, such as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nornamental  fish,  with its trade  valued  at  about  $75\r\n\r\nmillion annually.  Currently, the Act does not cover fish\r\n\r\ndiseases.  Clause 3 of this Bill proposes to include fish\r\n\r\ninto  the  definition  of  \"Animal\"  in  this  Act.   The\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"fish\" covers fishes, crustaceans, mollusks\r\n\r\nand  other aquatic animals.  This amendment will  provide\r\n\r\nthe  necessary  protection for  the  health  of  fish  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and the regulation of trade in aquatic  animals\r\n\r\nin accordance with international requirements.  Clause  3\r\n\r\nalso allows for the Minister to expand the definitions of\r\n\r\n\"animal\"   and   \"disease\"  through  an   order   and   a\r\n\r\nnotification in the Gazette respectively, should diseases\r\n\r\ntransmitted by other organisms currently not  covered  in\r\n\r\nthis Act subsequently become significant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the AVA can deny diseased animals or\r\n\r\nbirds  being  imported into Singapore.  The amendment  in\r\n\r\nclause  8  of  the  Bill will further enhance  the  AVA's\r\n\r\npowers  by  allowing the AVA to prevent  the  entry  into\r\n\r\nSingapore of any vehicle, ship or aircraft, suspected  of\r\n\r\ncarrying diseased animals or birds, without the need  for\r\n\r\nthe  animals  or birds to be inspected and  found  to  be\r\n\r\ndiseased.  For instance, the animals or birds may not  be\r\n\r\nshowing  signs  of a disease when they  left  the  source\r\n\r\ncountry,  but  it  is  later known that  they  have  been\r\n\r\nexposed  to the disease and therefore pose a risk.   This\r\n\r\nproposed  power would be exercised only  if  the  AVA  is\r\n\r\nsatisfied that the suspected diseased animals or birds on\r\n\r\nboard   the  vehicle,  ship  or  aircraft,  can  pose   a\r\n\r\nsignificant risk to the health of our population, or  our\r\n\r\nanimals or birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 11 of the Act currently requires imported\r\n\r\ndogs and cats to be confined on board a ship, unless  the\r\n\r\nAVA  authorises  their landing.  This is to  prevent  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  into Singapore of any diseases  that  these\r\n\r\ndogs  and cats may carry.  Any animals and birds imported\r\n\r\nor  transhipped  by  sea via Singapore could  potentially\r\n\r\nintroduce diseases into Singapore.  Clause 9 of the  Bill\r\n\r\ntherefore expands the scope of section 11 to enable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe AVA to confine to the ship, any animal and bird being\r\n\r\nimported or transhipped by sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6, 13 and 14 of the Bill enhance AVA's\r\n\r\npowers  to  examine and deal with animals and birds  that\r\n\r\nare diseased or suspected of being diseased.  Animals and\r\n\r\nbirds to be imported or exported out of Singapore can  be\r\n\r\ndetained  at  a  quarantine station  for  examination  to\r\n\r\nensure that they are free from disease.  They can also be\r\n\r\ndestroyed  if they are found to be a disease  risk.   AVA\r\n\r\ncan  also  examine  animals or birds suspected  of  being\r\n\r\ndiseased  to make a disease diagnosis.  This can  include\r\n\r\ntaking  environmental  samples, such  as  their  feed  or\r\n\r\nbedding  materials, or destroying the animals and  birds,\r\n\r\nif  indeed  that  is necessary to diagnose  the  disease.\r\n\r\nAnimals  or  birds  which have been in contact  with,  or\r\n\r\nexposed  to,  diseased animals or  birds,  or  which  may\r\n\r\nperpetuate the disease, can also be destroyed to  prevent\r\n\r\nfurther spread of the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is an animal or bird disease outbreak, the\r\n\r\nmovement  of  people  and vehicles  into  and  out  of  a\r\n\r\ndiseased  area  may  become the means for  spreading  the\r\n\r\ndisease  around  Singapore.  By virtue of the  amendments\r\n\r\nunder  clause 16 of the Bill, the Minister may order  the\r\n\r\nrestriction  of  movement  of  people  and  vehicles   in\r\n\r\ndiseased areas in order to contain the problem.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  assure  the House, however, that  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwould  exercise  this  power only  in  serious  cases  of\r\n\r\ndiseases that can affect humans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 29 of the Bill updates the provisions for\r\n\r\nestablishing quarantine stations for animals and birds in\r\n\r\nveterinary centres.  It provides for the AVA to establish\r\n\r\nor designate more quarantine stations if the AVA assesses\r\n\r\nthat this is necessary for disease control.  The AVA  can\r\n\r\nalso  license veterinary centres to ensure that they  are\r\n\r\nproperly  managed  and  equipped  for  the  treatment  of\r\n\r\nanimals and birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology has progressed globally to a level where\r\n\r\nthere  are genetically modified organisms and GMO derived\r\n\r\nproducts which have been commercialised or are in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  process of being commercialised.  Clause 30  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  provides for the regulation of the import  and  the\r\n\r\npossession of animal-related GMOs in order to ensure that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  inadvertent  introduction  of  undesirable\r\n\r\nanimal-related  GMOs  or GMO-derived  products  that  can\r\n\r\ncompromise  the  health  of our  population,  or  of  our\r\n\r\nanimals and birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Strengthen  provisions for animal welfare and  prevention of animal cruelty</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the abandonment of animals, besides being a\r\n\r\ncruel act, also contributes to the proliferation of stray\r\n\r\nanimals.  Over the years, the AVA, unfortunately, has not\r\n\r\nseen  any reduction in the rate of abandonment of animals\r\n\r\nby  owners.  Each year, the AVA and SPCA have to put down\r\n\r\nabout 9,000 dogs and 12,000 cats.  The AVA and SPCA  also\r\n\r\nimpound  around 200 and 1,000 pure breed dogs  each  year\r\n\r\nrespectively.   Clauses 20-22 of the Bill strengthen  the\r\n\r\nAVA's  power  to  deal  with  cruelty  to  animals.   The\r\n\r\nabandonment of animals without reasonable cause  is  made\r\n\r\nan  offence.   This  is to serve as a  deterrent  against\r\n\r\nirresponsible   pet  owners.   In  addition,   the   Bill\r\n\r\nincreases the maximum penalty for animal cruelty offences\r\n\r\nfrom  the  current $500 fine and/or a jail  term  of  six\r\n\r\nmonths  to  a  proposed $10,000 fine or a  jail  term  of\r\n\r\ntwelve months.  The Bill also provides AVA with the power\r\n\r\nto  enter and search any premises with suspected  cruelty\r\n\r\ncases.   Animals subjected to cruelty can be  taken  away\r\n\r\nfrom  their  owners  and can be medically  treated  by  a\r\n\r\nlicenced veterinarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 25 of the Bill provides for a new section to\r\n\r\nregulate the keeping and breeding of animals and birds to\r\n\r\nensure  public  health and safety, and to prevent  animal\r\n\r\ncruelty.   It  also regulates the feeding of animals  and\r\n\r\nbirds  to  keep  in  check  the  proliferation  of  stray\r\n\r\nanimals,  which  in  turn  can  help  in  preventing  and\r\n\r\ncontrolling the spread of animal and bird diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Improve AVA's operational efficiency</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4, 6, 8, 13-15, 25 and 28 of the Bill\r\n\r\ninclude amendments to give AVA the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nflexibility to outsource some of its functions to augment\r\n\r\nits  own  services.   The Director-General  of  the  AVA,\r\n\r\nsubject  to  any  general or special  directions  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  can designate suitably qualified persons  from\r\n\r\nthe private sector, such as authorised examiners in order\r\n\r\nto  carry out inspections, examinations, tests, treatment\r\n\r\nand  certification of animals and birds  for  import  and\r\n\r\nexport,   and   for  the  diagnosis  of   disease.    The\r\n\r\nimpoundment  of strays and identification of animals  and\r\n\r\nbirds,  eg,  through  micro-chipping,  can  similarly  be\r\n\r\noutsourced  to  private entities.  The  AVA  will  direct\r\n\r\nthese  authorised examiners on the functions  to  perform\r\n\r\nand  specify  the  procedures and  conditions  for  these\r\n\r\nauthorised  examiners  to comply  with.   The  authorised\r\n\r\nexaminers will not be given enforcement powers.  The  AVA\r\n\r\nwill  still retain overall control and accountability  in\r\n\r\nthe  final  judgment  on disease  control  based  on  the\r\n\r\nfindings   and   recommendations  of   these   authorised\r\n\r\nexaminers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 26 of the Bill re-enacts the existing section\r\n\r\n57  to  make clearer the procedure for the forfeiture  of\r\n\r\nitems.   The revised provisions are similar to  those  in\r\n\r\nthe  Wholesome Meat and Fish Act.  Clauses 24 and  31  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  enhance the AVA's powers of investigation  and\r\n\r\nenforcement  and  facilitate the AVA  to  carry  out  the\r\n\r\nfunctions  of  this Act more effectively.  This  includes\r\n\r\npowers to suspend or revoke licences and permits, require\r\n\r\nthe  production  of  documents,  remove  obstructions  to\r\n\r\nentering   a  premise  or  vehicle,  to  facilitate   the\r\n\r\nexamination  of  any animal or bird, and  compound  minor\r\n\r\noffences.  These provisions will allow for more effective\r\n\r\nenforcement of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum penalties for offences committed under\r\n\r\nthe  Act are also increased under clause 34 of the  Bill.\r\n\r\nThis  is  to  maintain the level of deterrence  as  these\r\n\r\npenalties have not been revised since the Act was enacted\r\n\r\nin  1965.  Offences that present a lower risk of  disease\r\n\r\nspread will incur penalties not more than $5,000 in  fine\r\n\r\nand/or jail term of up to six months.  Offences that have\r\n\r\na higher risk of disease spread and a greater\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimpact  on  animal  and public health will  incur  higher\r\n\r\nmaximum penalties of a $10,000 fine and/or a jail term of\r\n\r\nup to twelve months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the Animals and Birds\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill will strengthen the existing  provisions\r\n\r\nto  prevent the introduction into, and control the spread\r\n\r\nof   diseases  of  animals  and  birds,  including   fish\r\n\r\ndiseases, in Singapore.  It will better enable the AVA to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  the  animals, birds and  fish  diseases  more\r\n\r\neffectively and promptly in order to protect  the  health\r\n\r\nof   Singaporeans   from   transmissible   animal-related\r\n\r\ndiseases.   It  will also strengthen provisions  for  the\r\n\r\nprevention of animal cruelty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\nThe  Bill  will address concerns on the spread of  animal\r\n\r\nand  bird  diseases  and  provide better  protection  for\r\n\r\nconsumers  in  Singapore.  With the growing awareness  on\r\n\r\nanimal   welfare,  it  is  also  timely  to  revise   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Animals and  Birds  Act  to  prevent\r\n\r\ncruelty to animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a civilised society, acts of cruelty should be\r\n\r\nprevented, not only to humans, but also to animals.   The\r\n\r\nrecent  incidents  on  cruelty  to  animals  have  raised\r\n\r\nconcerns  on  how we can address cruel acts  on  animals.\r\n\r\nBut,  Sir,  we must be careful to achieve a fair  balance\r\n\r\nbetween  protecting animals and protecting human  rights.\r\n\r\nAlthough  stringent penalties will serve as a  deterrent,\r\n\r\nit  may impose unfair punishment to some who infringe the\r\n\r\nAct,  especially first-time offenders, or those who  were\r\n\r\nprovoked by animals to act recklessly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now highlight the following specific\r\n\r\nprovisions   in   the   Bill  to  seek   the   Minister's\r\n\r\nclarifications.   One,  inconsistent  provisions  in  the\r\n\r\nBill.   There seems to be inconsistencies in the proposed\r\n\r\nBill  with  regard  to  the mode  of  transportation  for\r\n\r\nanimals and birds into Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClause  7  of the Bill amends section 9 of the  principal\r\n\r\nAct  by  empowering an authorised officer  to  board  any\r\n\r\nship,  aircraft, or train, for the purpose  of  examining\r\n\r\nany  animal  or  bird.   But it  has  not  empowered  the\r\n\r\nauthorised  officer  to  board any  vehicle  transporting\r\n\r\nanimals or birds into Singapore. This provides a loophole\r\n\r\nfor  the importation of animals or birds by land.  I hope\r\n\r\nthe  Minister can explain why the authorised  officer  is\r\n\r\nnot  empowered to examine animals or birds on  board  any\r\n\r\nvehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 8 of the Bill, section 10 provides the\r\n\r\npower  for  the  Director-General to deal  with  diseased\r\n\r\nanimals   and   birds  being  imported  into   Singapore.\r\n\r\nHowever,  section 10(1) only specifies animals and  birds\r\n\r\non  board vehicle, aircraft or ship.  There is no mention\r\n\r\nof   train.   Thus,  the  Director-General  is  also  not\r\n\r\nempowered  to  deal  with animals and birds  imported  by\r\n\r\ntrains.  This provision is also inconsistent with  clause\r\n\r\n7,  as  the mode of transportation is not comprehensively\r\n\r\nspelt  out.   Similarly, clause 16 of the  Bill  has  not\r\n\r\nempowered  the  Minister  to  restrict  the  movement  of\r\n\r\nanimals  and birds by train into, within or  out  of  any\r\n\r\ndisease infected area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the inconsistent provisions in the Bill will\r\n\r\nnot  provide  a watertight system to prevent and  control\r\n\r\nthe spread of animal and bird diseases into Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister can address these concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, clause 3 of the Bill adopts a different\r\n\r\ndefinition for animals as compared to section 42  of  the\r\n\r\nAnimals and Birds Act.  The definition in clause  3  does\r\n\r\nnot include reptiles and insects.  May I clarify with the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  the  proposed  Bill  will  cover   the\r\n\r\nimportation  of  reptiles  and  insects?   Reptiles   and\r\n\r\ninsects  can  also  be  potential disease  carriers  into\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Balance  between protecting animals and protecting  human rights</i> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I agree that more should be done to\r\n\r\nprotect the welfare of animals, we must also consider the\r\n\r\nrights of human beings.  Clause 20 amends section 43\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  deals  with cruelty to animals.  It has  increased\r\n\r\nthe  maximum penalty for a fine not exceeding $500  or  a\r\n\r\nterm of imprisonment not exceeding six months or both, to\r\n\r\na  fine  not  exceeding $10,000 or a term of imprisonment\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding 12 months or both.  We need to  address  a\r\n\r\nfundamental  question.   Is cruelty  to  animals  such  a\r\n\r\nserious   criminal  offence  that  warrants  a   12-month\r\n\r\nimprisonment term for the offenders?  This is  especially\r\n\r\nso  for first-time offenders.  According to section 42 of\r\n\r\nthe  Animals  and Birds Act, the definition  of  \"animal\"\r\n\r\nincludes  any  beast,  bird,  fish,  reptile  or  insect,\r\n\r\nwhether  wild or tame.   Therefore, technically speaking,\r\n\r\nif  a  mosquito, which is an insect, bites you,  and  you\r\n\r\nkill  the  mosquito by cruelly beating  it,  you  may  be\r\n\r\nimprisoned for such an act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think this is the intention of the\r\n\r\nproposed  Bill.  We need a clearer definition on  cruelty\r\n\r\nto animals, as spelt out in section 42.  By enhancing the\r\n\r\npowers  of  the  court, we may send a wrong  signal  that\r\n\r\noffenders  of  cruelty  to  animals  should  be  severely\r\n\r\npunished.   I  am concerned about the recent imprisonment\r\n\r\nsentences  served on animal abusers.  To achieve  a  fair\r\n\r\nbalance  between protecting human rights  and  protecting\r\n\r\nanimals,  I  propose  that we should  adopt  a  graduated\r\n\r\npunishment  system whereby first-time offenders  will  be\r\n\r\nfined,  and repeat offenders may be fined or jailed.   In\r\n\r\nthis  way,  we not only deter acts of cruelty to  animals\r\n\r\nbut  also protect human rights.  Sir, we must not readily\r\n\r\nsend  our people to jail, just because of cruel  acts  on\r\n\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Operational efficiency of AVA</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to achieve greater operational efficiency in\r\n\r\nenforcing the Animals and Birds Act, we need to  adopt  a\r\n\r\nholistic  approach to control animals in Singapore.   All\r\n\r\npet  animals  must  be  licensed and  tagged,  so  as  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate the traceability of owners and animals.   This\r\n\r\nwill  improve the effectiveness of enforcing the Act with\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  abandonment of animals  by  owners.   We\r\n\r\nshould also strengthen the Act to instill a greater sense\r\n\r\nof  responsibility  among pet owners.   At  present,  any\r\n\r\nperson can purchase or adopt an animal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  a pet without undergoing any training to care for the\r\n\r\nanimal.   As  a result, some animal owners may  encounter\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in  keeping  their  pets,  thus  losing  or\r\n\r\nabandoning  their pets.  This will consequently  increase\r\n\r\nthe  population  of  strays and pose  a  higher  risk  of\r\n\r\ndisease spread in our society.   I would suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister to include specific provisions on responsibility\r\n\r\nof pet owners in the Animals and Birds Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Licensing of veterinary centres</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 29, section 65 sets out a new provision to\r\n\r\nlicense  veterinary centres.  I support this measure.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to raise a concern on its impact on  business\r\n\r\ncosts.  I hope the licensing procedures and fees will not\r\n\r\nimpose  an  undue cost burden on the veterinary  centres,\r\n\r\nwhich might result in the closure of these centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Act was enacted in 1965 for, inter alia, the\r\n\r\nprevention of cruelty to animals and birds, for  measures\r\n\r\npertaining  to  the  general welfare and  improvement  of\r\n\r\nanimals  and birds in Singapore.  The proposed amendments\r\n\r\nare  timely  and  to  be welcomed.  There  was  a  recent\r\n\r\nnewspaper  report that the Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\ndoes  not  allow the keeping of cats in HDB flats.   Dogs\r\n\r\nare allowed.  The relevant non-governmental organisations\r\n\r\nhave voiced their disappointment and made submissions  to\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  to  review their position with  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nprohibition against cats.  It may be argued that this  is\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory in nature.  HDB may well have good reasons\r\n\r\nfor  their  current  position.   Perhaps  the  HDB  could\r\n\r\nfurther   review,   together  with  interested   parties,\r\n\r\nincluding relevant NGOs, to see if their rules  could  be\r\n\r\nmodified  to allow one cat per household as a pet  for  a\r\n\r\nstart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also encourage our children and adults to\r\n\r\npromote  in schools, homes and workplaces, the prevention\r\n\r\nof cruelty to animals and birds.  They must be encouraged\r\n\r\nto promote the general\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwelfare  and  improvement of animals and birds,  both  at\r\n\r\nhome and in the environment as a whole, and, I would  add\r\n\r\nalso, prevention of cruelty to animals in the zoo.   This\r\n\r\nwill,  I  believe, make us, as human beings, more  caring\r\n\r\nand  compassionate and, hopefully, less selfish and self-centred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or more of our polytechnics and/or universities\r\n\r\nshould  also consider, if found practicable, to introduce\r\n\r\nveterinary science as a discipline, either as  a  diploma\r\n\r\nor  degree course, to encourage our young boys and  girls\r\n\r\nto  take up this course, so that in the process, it  will\r\n\r\nimprove the welfare and care for animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring up another point. As I read\r\n\r\nsection   69H  in  clause  31  of  the  Bill,  it   says,\r\n\r\n\"Protection  from  liability\", and  this  is  actually  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  principle that needs to be considered, not  just\r\n\r\nthis  particular  Bill but also quite a lot  of  statutes\r\n\r\nthat would be relevant.  It says in section 69H:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"No suit or other legal proceedings shall lie\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Authority,  the  Director-General  or   any\r\n\r\nauthorised officer, police officer, officer of customs or\r\n\r\nany  other  person  acting under  the  direction  of  the\r\n\r\nAuthority  or Director-General for anything which  is  in\r\n\r\ngood  faith done in the execution or purported  execution\r\n\r\nof this Act or any rules made thereunder.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sense, this is a provision to exculpate the\r\n\r\nState  from any form of liability.  On the whole, it  may\r\n\r\nbe  a  good provision.  But it may be timely to note that\r\n\r\nif  you look at the legal entity called the \"Republic  of\r\n\r\nSingapore\"  or the State, it is the richest legal  entity\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  It has also, arguably, the most number of\r\n\r\ncivil   servants,  staff  and  legal  officers  who   are\r\n\r\ncompetent and well informed to carry out the duties under\r\n\r\nthe  Act.   Therefore, should they  be  given  the  extra\r\n\r\nprivileges  of immunity from legal suits, ie,  not  being\r\n\r\nable  to  be  sued  at  all?   Unlike  private  citizens,\r\n\r\ncompanies  or  NGOs,  it  is  something  to  be  reviewed\r\n\r\nperhaps, although one can well understand the State needs\r\n\r\nto be protected as much as possible from legal liability.\r\n\r\nBut  there  must come a time when there  is  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility and fear of potential legal action for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndamages or other legal remedy by which then, there would,\r\n\r\nin    all    probability,   be   higher   standards    of\r\n\r\nprofessionalism, and this surely must  be  good  for  the\r\n\r\nState as a whole in the long term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge, therefore, maybe in futuro, that this\r\n\r\nprovision, and provisions of a like nature, be considered\r\n\r\nin  the  various  statutes  of  Singapore  that  we  have\r\n\r\ncurrently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will\r\n\r\nreply  to Dr Teo Ho Pin's points first and then cover  Mr\r\n\r\nChandra Mohan's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to start by commending Dr Teo for\r\n\r\nhaving obviously gone through this Bill with a fine-tooth\r\n\r\ncomb,  and  for detecting what he felt were  inconsistent\r\n\r\nprovisions in the Bill.  I am even more happy  to  report\r\n\r\nthat  my civil servants have gone through this Bill  with\r\n\r\nan  even  finer tooth comb.  I would like to  assure  him\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  no loopholes.  Let me  deal  with  them\r\n\r\nspecifically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo was worried about inconsistent definition of\r\n\r\nthe  means  of transport referred in section 9.   Let  me\r\n\r\nfirst  bring  him back to sections 7 and 8  of  the  Act.\r\n\r\nSection  7  provides that no one can import an animal  or\r\n\r\nbird into Singapore without a licence.  In section 8,  if\r\n\r\nand when that person does import such a live organism, he\r\n\r\nhas to report to the AVA.  Section 9, which Dr Teo refers\r\n\r\nto,  places an additional burden upon the captain  of  an\r\n\r\naircraft,  a  ship, or the guard of a train.   These  are\r\n\r\nmodes  of  transport  which are  large  and  require  the\r\n\r\nofficers  specifically  to  board  and  conduct  a   more\r\n\r\ndetailed  examination and in which we want to  place  the\r\n\r\nonus  of notification, not just on the importer of  these\r\n\r\nanimals or livestock, but on the person in charge of that\r\n\r\naircraft,  ship  or train.  This is also related  to  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  in certain cases, livestock may not  even  be\r\n\r\nimported  into  Singapore.  They may be  transhipped  via\r\n\r\nSingapore.  And such a person may say, \"Look,  I  am  not\r\n\r\nimporting this animal or bird, and I do not feel  that  I\r\n\r\nneed to apply for an import licence.\"  Section 9 gives us\r\n\r\nthe specific\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nauthority to require that the master or captain  of  this\r\n\r\ntransportation means will specifically inform us that  he\r\n\r\nhas  on board such livestock.  And if we feel that  there\r\n\r\nare  public health concerns, we may then decide  that  we\r\n\r\nmay need to board to conduct an inspection or, indeed, to\r\n\r\nconfine the animal to that ship, aircraft  or train.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next section where he was worried about is the\r\n\r\napparent exclusion of the word \"train\" from vehicle.   We\r\n\r\nhave  just  checked with the Attorney-General's  Chambers\r\n\r\nand  I  have  been  informed that when they  refer  to  a\r\n\r\nvehicle,   they   mean  a  conveyance  or   transmission,\r\n\r\nespecially  a  structure with wheels in which  things  or\r\n\r\npeople  are  transported by land.   And  I  am  therefore\r\n\r\nassured  that  this  includes trains.   So  there  is  no\r\n\r\nloophole in that respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move on, he brought up the issue of a balance\r\n\r\nbetween  human rights and animal rights.  Let me,  first,\r\n\r\nassure  Members  of the House that there  are  no  animal\r\n\r\nrights.   We  are not conferring any rights  on  animals.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the issue of cruelty has got everything  to  do\r\n\r\nwith  humanity and with social norms.  When an animal  is\r\n\r\nabandoned,  hurt  or  stolen,  the  emotional  pain   and\r\n\r\ndistress  which the owner of that animal  feels  is  very\r\n\r\nmuch  a  human issue.  It is not simply an  issue  of  an\r\n\r\nanimal right.  Similarly, when a dog is cooked alive with\r\n\r\nan  acetylene torch, as has indeed happened in Singapore,\r\n\r\neven  though that dog is a stray, it offends  our  social\r\n\r\nnorms, our sensitivities as to what is appropriate in our\r\n\r\nculture.   So I want to reassure the House that  when  we\r\n\r\nare  talking about cruelty to animals, we are not talking\r\n\r\nabout stomping on a cockroach or killing a mosquito.   We\r\n\r\nare  talking  about  the  need to  have  the  ability  to\r\n\r\nintervene  when people indulge in acts which  go  against\r\n\r\nour  social norms, or indulge in acts which will actually\r\n\r\ncause distress and pain to fellow human beings.  So,  let\r\n\r\nme  assure  the House that it is all about human  beings.\r\n\r\nIt is not about animal rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then went on to talk about the operational\r\n\r\nefficiency  of the AVA and how we need it.  He  suggested\r\n\r\nthat all pet animals be licensed and tagged.  Let me\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirst  tell  him  that we license all  dogs  and  we  tag\r\n\r\nimported  dogs.   We  do  not tag  rabbits,  chinchillas,\r\n\r\nguinea  pigs  and all the other things.  In fact,  if  we\r\n\r\nwere  to  indulge in that, it will surely raise our  fees\r\n\r\nand  it would be something which, I am sure, will not  be\r\n\r\npopular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our stand is that we will do only what is necessary\r\n\r\nand  what  is  reasonable.   And  having  put  all  these\r\n\r\nlicensing  requirements in place, the  AVA  will  operate\r\n\r\nonly  on a cost recovery basis.  We do not intend to make\r\n\r\nmoney  from  this,  and  we  will  not  indulge  in   any\r\n\r\nunnecessary tests, licensing or any other procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to move on to the points raised by Mr\r\n\r\nChandra Mohan.  The issue of cats in HDB flats is  not  a\r\n\r\nnew  issue.  Again, I want to stress that it is not about\r\n\r\ncats.   It is about human beings, social norms and public\r\n\r\nacceptance.    To-date,  there  has  been  a  difference,\r\n\r\nwhether you like it or not, in terms of public acceptance\r\n\r\nof  dogs  vis-a-vis cats.  It is not a matter of what  is\r\n\r\nright, or what is wrong.  There is a difference.  In  the\r\n\r\npast,  the HDB has incessantly received complaints  about\r\n\r\ncats  from  other  residents who obviously  are  not  cat\r\n\r\nlovers.  There is a difference between a cat and  a  dog.\r\n\r\nCats  are  nomadic by nature.  A cat is not  some  animal\r\n\r\nwhich normally takes kindly to a leash.  A cat is not  an\r\n\r\nanimal  which  you  can leave in a flat.   The  moment  a\r\n\r\nwindow  or  any opening is available, that cat will  move\r\n\r\nout.   The  cat  is  nomadic  by  nature.   The  cat  has\r\n\r\ndefecation   or   urinary  habits  which  may   aggravate\r\n\r\nneighbours.   The caterwauling of cats is part  of  their\r\n\r\nmating ritual, and the veterinarians in the AVA have told\r\n\r\nme  that cats caterwaul in post-coital agony - not  post-coital  ecstasy  - it is also a source of irritation  for\r\n\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that it is a never, never situation\r\n\r\nwith  cats.   I  am  just pointing  out  that  there  are\r\n\r\nproblems.   What  the  HDB has to do  is  to  strike  the\r\n\r\nappropriate balance between the needs and desires of all,\r\n\r\nif  not most, of the residents.  Nevertheless, I am aware\r\n\r\nthat  the  Cat Welfare Society has submitted a re-appeal,\r\n\r\nand the Ministry will examine the re-appeal for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfresh grounds.  And if indeed there is merit in this,  or\r\n\r\nthere  are ways in which we can be more flexible  in  our\r\n\r\nimplementation, we will certainly look at it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he talked about the zoo, I hope he was not\r\n\r\nimplying that there was any cruelty in our zoo.   Because\r\n\r\nI  am  very,  very certain that our zoo is,  in  fact,  a\r\n\r\nshowcase  of how animals should be treated and kept  and,\r\n\r\nin  fact, looked after in the most appropriate way.  And,\r\n\r\nin  fact, it is exactly the educational value of the  zoo\r\n\r\nwhich,  I  think,  will  actually bring  about  a  better\r\n\r\nattitude  of  human  beings to the  proper  treatment  of\r\n\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his suggestion of the university running a\r\n\r\nveterinary science course, this, obviously, is  something\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Ministry of Education will  have  to  decide.\r\n\r\nBut,  from  my perspective, I do not think this  will  be\r\n\r\nnecessary.   Members of this House may be  keen  to  note\r\n\r\nthat it is harder to get into a veterinary school than it\r\n\r\nis   to  get  into  a  medical  school.   The  number  of\r\n\r\nveterinarians we need in Singapore is much, much  smaller\r\n\r\nthan  the  number of doctors we need.  And if we  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  the  critical mass to conduct a good, high  quality\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  are  better  off sending  people  with  this\r\n\r\nability and aptitude to appropriate overseas centres  for\r\n\r\ntheir training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point he made is about protection from\r\n\r\nliability.   I  think  those  are  generic  points,   not\r\n\r\nspecific to this Bill itself.  But the only thing which I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  say in reply is that this  protects  the\r\n\r\nAuthority, the Director-General and public officials  who\r\n\r\nare performing their duties pursuant to directions of the\r\n\r\nlegislation,  or  to rules passed by Parliament,  or  the\r\n\r\nappropriate  Executive, and that they are doing  this  in\r\n\r\ngood faith.  If these officers do not perform the task in\r\n\r\ngood  faith, they are liable to prosecution, not only  by\r\n\r\nthe  public,  but  even internally, subject  to  our  own\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  processes and indeed criminal  prosecution.\r\n\r\nI think, as a lawyer, he would agree with that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If members of the public feel that laws are unfair,\r\n\r\nthe appropriate forum for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   is  this  Parliament,  and  that  is  why  Members\r\n\r\nscrutinise all legislation which is passed down here, and\r\n\r\nall rules and subsidiary legislation emanating from that.\r\n\r\nIf  the  laws have been misapplied, members of the public\r\n\r\nhave a recourse to the legal system.

There are  two\r\n\r\ntypes  of  plumbers, namely, sanitary plumbers and  water\r\n\r\nservice  plumbers.  Sanitary plumbers carry out  sanitary\r\n\r\nworks,  such as the installation of sanitary fittings  in\r\n\r\ntoilets  and  laying of sanitary pipe work,  while  water\r\n\r\nservice plumbers carry out plumbing works for the  supply\r\n\r\nof  drinking  water.   Both sanitary  and  water  service\r\n\r\nplumbers are regulated by PUB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sewerage and Drainage (Amendment) Bill seeks to\r\n\r\nabolish  the  registration of  sanitary  plumbers.   This\r\n\r\nderegulation, however, applies only to sanitary plumbers.\r\n\r\nWater  service plumbers will continue to be regulated  by\r\n\r\nPUB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the registration scheme for\r\n\r\nsanitary  plumbers was started in 1976.  The  scheme  was\r\n\r\nintroduced  to  build  up  a  pool  of  experienced   and\r\n\r\nqualified sanitary plumbers.  Today, there are about  550\r\n\r\nsanitary  plumbers registered with PUB.  To  qualify  for\r\n\r\nregistration, they must pass the relevant skills  courses\r\n\r\nconducted by the Construction Industry Training Institute\r\n\r\nand  the Institute of Technical Education.  However,  not\r\n\r\nall   sanitary  works  require  the  skills  of  a  fully\r\n\r\nqualified  plumber to do the job.  There are two  aspects\r\n\r\nof  works  carried  out by registered sanitary  plumbers.\r\n\r\nOne  is  to  carry  out  minor sanitary  works,  such  as\r\n\r\nchanging and relocating toilet bowls.  The other  is  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of the sanitary pipe work in new  buildings\r\n\r\nand developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, minor sanitary works are not difficult in\r\n\r\nnature.   A  normal renovation contractor will  have  the\r\n\r\nskills  to  do a good job.  But, currently, a  renovation\r\n\r\ncontractor cannot undertake any sanitary work  unless  he\r\n\r\npossesses the full qualifications and is registered  with\r\n\r\nPUB.   This  has resulted in a protected market  for  the\r\n\r\nqualified  sanitary  plumbers even  for  works  that  are\r\n\r\nrelatively  simple and straightforward.   Abolishing  the\r\n\r\nregistration of sanitary plumbers will open up the market\r\n\r\nfor  other contractors to undertake minor sanitary  works\r\n\r\nand lower the cost of such services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the construction of sanitary pipe work in new\r\n\r\nbuildings and developments, the Sewerage and Drainage Act\r\n\r\nhas  a  provision to require the developer  to  engage  a\r\n\r\nqualified architect or engineer to be responsible for the\r\n\r\nproper  design  and construction of the  sanitary  works.\r\n\r\nThis  aspect  of  sanitary  works  will  continue  to  be\r\n\r\nregulated by PUB which will continue to conduct checks on\r\n\r\ncompleted  sanitary works.  This provision is  sufficient\r\n\r\nto  ensure  the sanitary facilities in new buildings  and\r\n\r\ndevelopments are properly installed.  There is  therefore\r\n\r\nno  need for PUB to continue with the registration scheme\r\n\r\nfor sanitary plumbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, PUB has been in discussion with the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Plumbing  Society  (SPS)  on   its   proposed\r\n\r\nderegulation of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregistered  sanitary plumber scheme.  SPS  has  indicated\r\n\r\nthat it will put up an accreditation scheme for qualified\r\n\r\nsanitary  plumbers.  This would allow qualified  sanitary\r\n\r\nplumbers  to  be recognised and engaged for more  complex\r\n\r\nsanitary  piping  work  required for  new  buildings  and\r\n\r\ndevelopments.   SPS  will encourage  existing  registered\r\n\r\nsanitary  plumbers to become its members.  It  will  also\r\n\r\ntake  steps to promote and market their plumbers to serve\r\n\r\nthe  public  and  work  with the training  institutes  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to upgrade the skills of the sanitary plumbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now move on to the main\r\n\r\nprovisions in this Bill.  The main provision of the  Bill\r\n\r\nis  clause 6.  It repeals sections 36 and 37, and removes\r\n\r\nthe  requirement  for registration of sanitary  plumbers,\r\n\r\nhence, opening up sanitary work to other contractors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clauses make consequent and minor changes\r\n\r\nto  the  Act to effect the deregulation of the Registered\r\n\r\nSanitary Plumbers Scheme.  The deregulation will  benefit\r\n\r\nhouse  owners  and  developers,  as  they  will  not   be\r\n\r\nrestricted to engaging only registered sanitary  plumbers\r\n\r\nto  carry out sanitary works.  The deregulation will give\r\n\r\nhouse owners and developers a wider choice of contractors\r\n\r\nor  plumbers.  This will result in lower cost for them to\r\n\r\ncarry out sanitary works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  amendment to remove the need  to  register\r\n\r\nplumbers.  May I add that this is long overdue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanitary plumbers have been defined just now. I am\r\n\r\nglad that the definition was clarified.  They are neither\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  the  design of plumbing systems,  including\r\n\r\ngas,  water  or sanitary systems, nor in certifying  work\r\n\r\ndone.   In  most  cases,  architects  and  engineers  are\r\n\r\nresponsible   for  the  design  of  these  systems   and,\r\n\r\nultimately, responsible for the completed jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, doing away with having to pay for a licensed\r\n\r\nplumber  would save cost for property owners,  especially\r\n\r\nprivate  property owners.  However, the concern would  be\r\n\r\nthe  flooding of the market by untrained persons claiming\r\n\r\nto  be  qualified  plumbers.  This will disadvantage  the\r\n\r\ngenuine tradesmen and put the public at risk.  To further\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the interests of the public, the trade  should\r\n\r\nbe   encouraged  to  implement  self-checks  from  within\r\n\r\nitself,  to  ensure quality work provided.  This  can  be\r\n\r\ndone  through the setting up of trade associations.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  Singapore  Plumbing  Society,  established\r\n\r\nsince  1959, with members in the plumbing trade,  can  be\r\n\r\nencouraged   to   provide   training   opportunities   to\r\n\r\ncontinuously upgrade members of the plumbing trade.  Such\r\n\r\na  set-up  would also serve as a forum to  keep  existing\r\n\r\ntradesmen  abreast of new products and new  skills.   The\r\n\r\ntraining  programmes can be conducted  jointly  with  the\r\n\r\nConstruction Industry Development Board or the  Institute\r\n\r\nof  Technical  Education, and I am glad the Minister  has\r\n\r\nalso  mentioned that there will be courses to  train  new\r\n\r\nplumbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Society can also be tasked to register plumbers\r\n\r\nwho abide by their codes of ethics.  More emphasis should\r\n\r\nbe  placed on plumbers who are qualified members of  such\r\n\r\nan   association.   Only  these  should  be  allowed   to\r\n\r\npractise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore\r\n\r\nPlumbing Society is in support of this Bill.

E. Lim (Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr David T. E. Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nbeg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the local media play an important nation-building role in our multi-racial and multi-religious\r\n\r\nsociety.  They need to have a deep appreciation for local\r\n\r\nsensibilities  and sensitivities, and a  clear  sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility and commitment to Singapore.  This is  why\r\n\r\nwe  have  rules on shareholding limits to ensure that  no\r\n\r\none  can  manipulate  our local media  to  undermine  our\r\n\r\nsociety.  However, since the shareholding controls in the\r\n\r\nNewspaper  and  Printing Presses Act  (NPPA)  were  first\r\n\r\nintroduced in 1977, there have been many changes  in  the\r\n\r\ninvestment,    financing   and   corporate   environment.\r\n\r\nInvestment options, like trust funds, futures  and  stock\r\n\r\noptions,   are  now  common.   New  corporate  structures\r\n\r\ninvolving  holding, subsidiary and sister companies  have\r\n\r\nalso  sprung up.  Such changes can have an impact on  the\r\n\r\nownership and control of newspaper companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing legislation does not cater adequately\r\n\r\nfor  these  changes.  It is therefore possible  for  some\r\n\r\nentities  to  exploit these grey areas to circumvent  the\r\n\r\nshareholding provisions and other controls  in  the  Act,\r\n\r\nthereby   exercising  undue  influence  over  our   media\r\n\r\ncompanies.  This Bill, therefore, proposes amendments  to\r\n\r\nthe  Newspaper  and Printing Presses Act  to  update  the\r\n\r\nshareholding controls in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAct.   We are also taking this opportunity to update  the\r\n\r\npenalty scheme in the NPPA and to make other revisions to\r\n\r\nthe Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now speak on these issues in turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 1999, Capital Group Companies\r\n\r\nIncorporated  (or  \"Capital\" in short), an  international\r\n\r\nfund manager, acquired more than 5% of ordinary shares in\r\n\r\nSingapore Press Holdings (SPH).  Technically, Capital did\r\n\r\nnot  breach the 3% shareholding limit in the NPPA.   This\r\n\r\nwas  because, as currently worded, the NPPA only  applies\r\n\r\nto  beneficial owners, and not nominee shareholders  like\r\n\r\nCapital.  However, certain nominee shareholders can  vote\r\n\r\non  behalf  of  their clients and, therefore,  can  exert\r\n\r\ninfluence over a company.  But the policy intent  of  the\r\n\r\nownership  limit in the NPPA is to ensure that no  single\r\n\r\nperson  or  company  can exercise undue  control  over  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper  company.   The  shareholding  limits   should,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  also  apply  to fund managers  who  have  the\r\n\r\ndiscretion to exercise voting rights of shares on  behalf\r\n\r\nof the beneficial owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that this policy intent is carried out,\r\n\r\nthe Government stated in October 1999 that we would amend\r\n\r\nthe   NPPA   ownership  provisions  to  adopt  the   same\r\n\r\ndefinition as the ownership provisions in the Banking Act\r\n\r\n(BA),  but  retain the 3% figure.  This  is  because  the\r\n\r\nownership provisions in the BA are more comprehensive, as\r\n\r\nthey  are  based  on  the concept of interest  in  voting\r\n\r\nshares.   This  covers  any person,  other  than  a  bare\r\n\r\ntrustee,  who  has an interest in a share, such  as  fund\r\n\r\nmanagers  like  Capital.   As the Singapore  Broadcasting\r\n\r\nAuthority  Act contains ownership provisions that  mirror\r\n\r\nthose in the NPPA, corresponding changes would be made to\r\n\r\nthe SBA Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparing the Bill, we noted that as the new\r\n\r\ndefinition   of  \"shareholding  interest\"   covers   more\r\n\r\nparties,  retaining the original 3%  figure  may  be  too\r\n\r\nrestrictive.   Such  a low limit could  affect  the  fair\r\n\r\nvalue  of  the  shares of a listed media company  in  the\r\n\r\nstock  market  by limiting buyers from acquiring  a  more\r\n\r\nsubstantial stake for their portfolios.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking   into   account  feedback  from  the   investment\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  industry players that  we  consulted,  we\r\n\r\ndecided  to raise the shareholding threshold figure  from\r\n\r\n3% to 5%.  This 5% figure will address our concerns about\r\n\r\nundue   influence  over  a  media  company,  while  still\r\n\r\nproviding leeway for investors to take a larger stake  in\r\n\r\na listed media company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight the new provisions on\r\n\r\nshareholding  controls.  Clause 3  of  the  Bill  repeals\r\n\r\nsection  10  and inserts new sections 10A  to  10H.   The\r\n\r\ncurrent   3%  shareholding  limit  is  aligned   to   the\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"substantial shareholding\" in the Companies\r\n\r\nAct and the Banking Act, which refer to a 5% interest  in\r\n\r\nvoting  shares.   A  new shareholding threshold  at  12%,\r\n\r\nwhich  mirrors that in the BA, has also been  introduced.\r\n\r\nIt addresses aggregated shareholdings of a person and his\r\n\r\nassociates, where \"associates\" includes close  relatives.\r\n\r\nThis  will address the loophole in the current Act, which\r\n\r\ndoes   not   take  into  account  relationships   between\r\n\r\nshareholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new sections will also address passive increases\r\n\r\nin  shareholdings,  and shareholders acting  in  concert.\r\n\r\nLegislative powers will be introduced for the Minister to\r\n\r\ndirect   the   transfer  and  disposal  of,  and   attach\r\n\r\nconditions to, excess shareholdings and impose  penalties\r\n\r\nfor breach of shareholding limits.  The maximum penalties\r\n\r\nfor  contravening the shareholding provisions  are,  upon\r\n\r\nconviction,  a fine not exceeding $50,000 or imprisonment\r\n\r\nfor  a  term  not exceeding three years or  both.   As  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent to recalcitrant offenders, a further  fine  not\r\n\r\nexceeding $5,000 will be imposed for every day  that  the\r\n\r\noffence continues after conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the update of the penalty\r\n\r\nsystem in the NPPA.  Currently, the substantive penalties\r\n\r\nfor  publishers  consist of revoking  their  licences  or\r\n\r\ncharging  them in court.  These penalties are too  severe\r\n\r\nfor lesser offences, for example, when publications carry\r\n\r\npictures that go beyond acceptable norms.  To provide  an\r\n\r\nappropriate  penalty  for  lesser  offences,  clause   12\r\n\r\ninserts new section 33A to empower the Minister to impose\r\n\r\ncomposition fines instead, which are out-of-court\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsettlements  for  offences  chargeable  in  court.    For\r\n\r\nconsistency  across the NPPA and other  legislation,  the\r\n\r\nBill  also introduces amendments to update the  scale  of\r\n\r\nfines  in  the NPPA, as there has not been an across-the-board  review of the penalties since the Act was  enacted\r\n\r\nin  1975.  The maximum fine under the NPPA will generally\r\n\r\nbe raised from $10,000 to $50,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on the other amendments to the\r\n\r\nAct.   Currently,  the receipt of funds  from  a  foreign\r\n\r\nsource  for  purposes other than commercial  purposes  is\r\n\r\nprohibited,  so  that no person can  subvert  our  media.\r\n\r\nHowever, in today's networked global economy, it  is  not\r\n\r\nuncommon  or difficult for foreign parties to register  a\r\n\r\ncompany  in  Singapore  or work through  a  local  agent.\r\n\r\nClause  4  of the Bill, therefore, amends section  11  to\r\n\r\nbroaden  the current definition of a \"foreign source\"  to\r\n\r\ninclude  foreign funds channelled through a local  agent.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  can  also declare any  local  incorporated\r\n\r\ncompany or association as a foreign source if it has  any\r\n\r\nforeign directors or members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 13 of the Bill updates the exemption\r\n\r\nclause  in  section  34  to  be  consistent  with   other\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang:</b> Sir, the print media\r\n\r\nconstitutes an integral part of our daily lives.

They can provide more coverage on  the  arts\r\n\r\nand  community.  They can give insights, invoke passions,\r\n\r\nenhance  appreciation, and thus push  the  arts  and  the\r\n\r\ncommunity to greater heights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An arts and community supplement, like the Computer\r\n\r\nTimes supplement distributed with the Straits Times, will\r\n\r\nbe  a  welcome gesture of the print media.   Let  us  pay\r\n\r\ntribute  to the talents and fashion of our arts community\r\n\r\nand  the  tens  of thousands of volunteers  in  community\r\n\r\nservice.  Let us give them a pat on their backs.  Let  us\r\n\r\nhelp  them spread their passion and volunteerism  to  the\r\n\r\nthousands who have been moved by the power of the pen  to\r\n\r\nfollow in their footsteps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Newspaper\r\n\r\nand  Printing Presses (Amendment) Bill, together with the\r\n\r\nSBA  (Amendment) Bill, is clear evidence of  Government's\r\n\r\ncontrol  over  the  media.   Control  comes  by  way   of\r\n\r\nempowering  the Minister to decide who should be  allowed\r\n\r\nto  own a substantial number of shares.  New section  10A\r\n\r\nof  the Bill prohibits any person to become a substantial\r\n\r\nshareholder  without approval of the Minister.   It  also\r\n\r\nprohibits   shareholders  to  act  together  with   other\r\n\r\nshareholders to exercise their voting rights if  together\r\n\r\nthey hold more than 5% of the voting shares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 10B further prohibits an indirect\r\n\r\ncontroller, by way of having 12% of the shares, or voting\r\n\r\npower  of the company with its associates unless,  again,\r\n\r\nthe Minister approves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is interesting that in this section, it\r\n\r\ndefines   in   detail  what  relationship  is  considered\r\n\r\nassociate.  I think we could also use the same  principle\r\n\r\nto examine, in the future, whether there is a conflict of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterest  in  holding  positions in  public  offices,  in\r\n\r\nprivate  companies and GLCs.  The control by the Minister\r\n\r\nwould  also  now  empower him to compel  shareholders  to\r\n\r\ndispose  of  their shares.  New section 10E empowers  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  do  so if, for example, he finds  that  the\r\n\r\nshareholder is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) not a fit and proper person; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) he is a person whose likely influence is to\r\n\r\nlead  the newspaper or broadcasting company to no  longer\r\n\r\nconduct its business prudently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder what does this Bill mean by \"a person who\r\n\r\nis not fit and proper\" to hold such shares.  Does it mean\r\n\r\nonly  persons  who  are  associated  with  the  PAP   are\r\n\r\nconsidered  as  fit and proper?  I also  wonder  what  is\r\n\r\nmeant  by  \"no  longer  conduct its business  prudently?\"\r\n\r\nWhat  does  this  refer to?  Does it refer  to  financial\r\n\r\nprudence or political prudence, or prudence in reports on\r\n\r\nthe Opposition?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, do we believe in an open society, market\r\n\r\neconomy  and a free exchange of ideas?  Or do we  believe\r\n\r\nin  control?   On the one hand, the PAP Government  talks\r\n\r\nabout market economy but requires shareholders, newspaper\r\n\r\nand  broadcasting companies to be subject to approval  to\r\n\r\nown  shares.   In  one breath, the PAP  Government  talks\r\n\r\nabout openness and transparency.  In the same breath, the\r\n\r\nPAP  is empowering Ministers with the wide discretion  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  the media by controlling who can own shares  and\r\n\r\nhave  voting  rights in the companies.  This  effectively\r\n\r\nensures that the management of a media company is  firmly\r\n\r\nin  the  hands  of  the Government.  It echoes  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment says and toes the Government's line.  This,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  Sir,  would be the underlying  cornerstones  of\r\n\r\nremaking Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Act\r\n\r\nwas  enacted  in  1974  for the  licensing  of  newspaper\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Newspaper companies are private in nature and\r\n\r\nnot  state-owned.   There should, therefore,  be  liberal\r\n\r\nmarket  forces  at  play,  with regard  to  ownership  of\r\n\r\nshareholdings in these companies.  Take precedents like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  USA, England, India and Australia, I wonder if  there\r\n\r\nare  similar provisions restricting the shareholdings  of\r\n\r\nshareholders and directors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are, Mr Speaker, Sir, a democratic nation and\r\n\r\nthere  must be freedom of the press and ownership of  the\r\n\r\npress.   The Government is here to govern and  should  be\r\n\r\nless   involved  with  newspaper  companies   and   about\r\n\r\nshareholders  of such companies, just like other  private\r\n\r\nand  public  companies, where the  Government  should  be\r\n\r\nleast  involved. There should be, preferably, a hands-off\r\n\r\napproach  as  the  years go by.  And let  there  be  more\r\n\r\nliberal  ways so that we have a more vibrant and  dynamic\r\n\r\nnewspaper  and  printing presses  industry  in  the  days\r\n\r\nahead.     If  there  is  abuse or danger  posed  to  the\r\n\r\nsecurity  or well-being of our nation, there  are  enough\r\n\r\nlaws  in Singapore to deal with such potential offenders.\r\n\r\nHaving   read  the  provisions,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   the\r\n\r\nprovision under clause 12, relating to the compounding of\r\n\r\noffences,  is  most welcome, and the Hon.  Minister  will\r\n\r\nhave  the  discretion  to allow compounding  of  relevant\r\n\r\ncases  and  that will avoid the necessity for prosecution\r\n\r\nin a court of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to the newspaper industry, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmay I be permitted also to say that since Independence in\r\n\r\n1965,  we,  in  Singapore, I understand, cannot  purchase\r\n\r\nMalaysian    newspapers   in   Singapore.      Similarly,\r\n\r\nMalaysians   cannot  purchase  Singapore  newspapers   in\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   We  in Singapore and Malaysians in  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nhave free access to the Internet, foreign newspapers  and\r\n\r\nmagazines  from  all over the world, but  not  from  each\r\n\r\nother's   countries.   Information   is   available   and\r\n\r\naccessible very easily. Then why this restriction between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Malaysia  on  the  availability  of   our\r\n\r\nrespective newspapers?  There may be political reasons in\r\n\r\nthe  1960s,  and perhaps 1970s and 1980s.  It  shows  how\r\n\r\nsuspicious our politicians and Malaysian politicians were\r\n\r\nand  still  are,  but  our citizens may  look  at  things\r\n\r\ndifferently. I for one do.  We need a set of new thinking\r\n\r\namongst  our  political leaders and  Malaysian  political\r\n\r\nleaders.  It is about time political leaders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  both countries revisited these rules with a genuine\r\n\r\ninterest  in  building  more  trustworthy  and  practical\r\n\r\napproaches to dissemination of information and  political\r\n\r\nand social issues between our two nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political leadership must venture to close the\r\n\r\ngap  and  create  the right ambience and  environment  to\r\n\r\nlearn  from each other, to respect each other and  create\r\n\r\npositive  rapport between the citizens of  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   And once the citizens of both countries  read\r\n\r\neach other's newspapers, both sides would appreciate each\r\n\r\nother's  political arguments and rationale for political,\r\n\r\neconomic  and  social decisions made  by  our  respective\r\n\r\nleadership.  Let us all be more enlightened and  progress\r\n\r\non  with  accurate facts, critical arguments and  various\r\n\r\narguments,  and  let  the citizens  and  people  of  both\r\n\r\ncountries decide for themselves and respond genuinely and\r\n\r\nmore  positively  based on ideas and  thoughts,  and  not\r\n\r\nmanouverings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a side note relating to the newspapers' ability\r\n\r\nto  educate  their  readers, may  I  also  encourage  our\r\n\r\nnewspapers to cite in their articles or stories, all  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  websites and articles and Government  materials\r\n\r\nand  their  websites  being  relied  on  by  journalists,\r\n\r\npoliticians  and civil servants so that the reader  would\r\n\r\nbe  aware where the sources came from.  So, at the end of\r\n\r\neach   article,   there  must  be,  almost  compulsorily,\r\n\r\nwebsites  and articles that were relied on, so  that  the\r\n\r\ndiscerning  reader would move on to read those  articles,\r\n\r\nand  we would find better debates, not just in Parliament\r\n\r\nbut  in  Singapore  as a whole.  Our  citizens  are  more\r\n\r\nintelligent, I would say, and more discerning these days,\r\n\r\nand let them decide, after analysing the facts and issues\r\n\r\nas they perceive it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the speakers\r\n\r\nwho  have  spoken  in support of the Bill.  A  number  of\r\n\r\nissues  have  been  raised, some  of  them  not  directly\r\n\r\nrelated  to the amendments, but let me take them  in  any\r\n\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Andy Gan has asked that the media encourage the\r\n\r\narts by giving it greater\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncoverage.  I leave this to the media to follow up on this\r\n\r\nsuggestion.   I  also  hope  that  they  will  give  more\r\n\r\ncoverage to the arts, since I wear the other hat of being\r\n\r\nthe Minister in charge of the arts in Singapore.  But  to\r\n\r\nbe  fair, I think the coverage of arts has increased over\r\n\r\nthe  years,  and  some of the newspapers  are  publishing\r\n\r\nsupplements  from time to time.  Some  of  them  do  have\r\n\r\nenhanced coverage of arts events in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan has raised a number of issues and\r\n\r\nalso  some  suggestions for newspaper companies  to  cite\r\n\r\nwebsites when they write their articles. Again,  I  leave\r\n\r\nthis   to  the  newspaper  companies  to  take   up   his\r\n\r\nsuggestion.  The power of web technology really is in the\r\n\r\nconnectivity, and I think there are already many  of  the\r\n\r\nhyperlinks provided on the news sites that one can  visit\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substantial issues raised about this particular\r\n\r\nBill  concern  control over the media.  Mr Chandra  Mohan\r\n\r\nasked  whether  other  countries  have  also  limits   on\r\n\r\nownership.    Indeed,  they  do.   As  I  know,   foreign\r\n\r\nownership  of newspapers is capped at 20% in  the  United\r\n\r\nStates.   Likewise, in Canada, it is capped at  25%.   In\r\n\r\nFrance,  foreign ownership is not allowed.  And I believe\r\n\r\nthere  are  also ownership restrictions in Australia  and\r\n\r\nUK,  although  in Australia these are being  reviewed  at\r\n\r\nthis  point  in  time.  So we are not  alone  in  setting\r\n\r\nownership  restrictions for foreign owners.   The  reason\r\n\r\nfor  this  is  that it is important that we do  not  have\r\n\r\nundue foreign influence in our local media.  The controls\r\n\r\nare  put  in  place so that Singaporeans can  decide  for\r\n\r\nthemselves  what  kind of a life they  want  to  have  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  we  can  decide for  ourselves  how  our\r\n\r\nsociety will develop and grow.  The controls are not  put\r\n\r\nin place to silence anyone, nor are they put in place for\r\n\r\nthe  Government to tell the media what they can or cannot\r\n\r\nwrite.   The Government does not tell editors  what  they\r\n\r\nshould write in their editorials.  Journalists can  write\r\n\r\nop-ed  pieces and, from time to time, they do write op-ed\r\n\r\npieces  that  are critical of Government policies.   They\r\n\r\nreport on the news, sometimes to the chagrin of Ministers\r\n\r\nor Backbenchers,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  they do not quite get the message they want reported.\r\n\r\nSo  there  is no attempt here to determine how the  media\r\n\r\nshould  report the news.  But our objective is to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  a  credible, a strong and  a  responsible\r\n\r\nmedia.  And for this reason, we have put in controls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The control that Mr Low Thia Khiang referred to, as\r\n\r\nto who can own shares, and why this is up to the Minister\r\n\r\nto decide, refers only to substantial shareholdings.  And\r\n\r\nthere  is a big difference here.  Mr Low Thia Khiang,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, or any other Member in this House, or any  other\r\n\r\nperson  in  Singapore  or elsewhere  can  buy  shares  in\r\n\r\nnewspaper  companies without any restriction and  without\r\n\r\nany permission from the Minister.  But when his aggregate\r\n\r\nof  shares exceeds 5%, then he requires the permission of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister.   This is to ensure that  no  one  person,\r\n\r\ncompany or entity holds a large amount of shares  and  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  able  to  exercise undue  influence  over  the\r\n\r\noperations of that newspaper company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe, I have dealt with the issues that\r\n\r\nMembers have raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, is the Minister saying\r\n\r\nthat  this Bill only restricts foreign ownership,  as  he\r\n\r\njust  now cited examples of other countries?

Is that the clause he was  referring\r\n\r\nto?  I am not quite sure of the question, Mr Speaker.

I  stated\r\n\r\nthat corresponding changes would be made to the Singapore\r\n\r\nBroadcasting  Authority Act (SBA Act)  as  its  ownership\r\n\r\nprovisions   mirror  those  in  the  NPPA.    This   Bill\r\n\r\nintroduces those changes to the shareholding controls  in\r\n\r\nthe SBA Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the principle of safeguarding against undue\r\n\r\ninfluence,  the Bill also proposes amendments  to  extend\r\n\r\nthe provisions on broadcasting companies to their holding\r\n\r\ncompanies and make other updates to the Act.  As  I  have\r\n\r\nalready  spoken  in  some detail on the  changes  to  the\r\n\r\nshareholding  controls in the NPPA, which are  paralleled\r\n\r\nin  this Bill, I propose to now concentrate on the  other\r\n\r\nchanges to the SBA Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to first explain that our regulatory\r\n\r\nregime   for   media  companies  takes  a  differentiated\r\n\r\napproach.    Stricter  controls  apply  to   broadcasting\r\n\r\ncompanies, because broadcast is a more emotive media than\r\n\r\nprint.   In  the  wrong hands, it can be easily  used  to\r\n\r\nmanipulate  audience's opinion and  undermine  our  hard-earned social harmony and stability.  It is with this  in\r\n\r\nmind  that  we have put in place ownership and management\r\n\r\ncontrols for broadcasting companies.  However, changes to\r\n\r\ncorporate structures can circumvent this intent.  Let  me\r\n\r\nillustrate.   In  the media business, a  holding  company\r\n\r\nwith  several  media subsidiaries is a  common  ownership\r\n\r\nstructure nowadays, eg, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation\r\n\r\nis  a  holding company of subsidiary media companies like\r\n\r\nFox  News  Channel  and Fox Broadcasting  Company.   Such\r\n\r\nholding companies may, and in many instances do,  have  a\r\n\r\nlarge influence over the operation of their subsidiaries.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  SBA Act currently does not apply  to  such\r\n\r\nholding companies.  This is unlike the Banking Act  where\r\n\r\nthe   shareholding   provisions  extend   to   designated\r\n\r\nfinancial holding companies.  We therefore need to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namend  the  SBA  Act to ensure that no single  person  or\r\n\r\nforeign   party  can  buy  up  majority   stakes   in   a\r\n\r\nbroadcasting  holding company and unduly influence  their\r\n\r\nbroadcast  subsidiaries.  Clause 4 of the Bill  therefore\r\n\r\namends  section  43  to  extend  the  definition   of   a\r\n\r\nbroadcasting  company, to include  its  holding  company.\r\n\r\nThe  shareholding and management provisions in Part X  of\r\n\r\nthe  Act  will  thus  also apply to broadcasting  holding\r\n\r\ncompanies.   For existing broadcasting companies,  MITA's\r\n\r\nintention is to grant approval to their holding companies\r\n\r\nupon application, for the relevant provisions in the Act.\r\n\r\nDepending on the situation, the Minister may also  exempt\r\n\r\ncertain holding companies from the provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now go through the other changes to the\r\n\r\nAct.   Clause  3  amends section 20 to  provide  that  no\r\n\r\nperson shall provide a licensable broadcasting service in\r\n\r\nor  from  Singapore without a broadcast  licence  granted\r\n\r\nunder section 20 or a class licence granted under section\r\n\r\n21.  This corrects the current legal loophole relating to\r\n\r\nthe  class  licence scheme, where the continued operation\r\n\r\nof a licensable broadcasting service by a person or group\r\n\r\nafter  the  application of his or its class  licence  has\r\n\r\nbeen  suspended, is not addressed.  The changes will  not\r\n\r\naffect  the  light  touch nature  of  the  class  licence\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill amends section 44 to clarify\r\n\r\nthat  the  full  Board of Directors, Board  Chairman  and\r\n\r\nChief  Executive Officer, of a broadcasting company,  are\r\n\r\nto  be  approved by the Singapore Broadcasting Authority.\r\n\r\nIt  also  provides  an  updated definition  of  a  \"Chief\r\n\r\nExecutive Officer\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the Bill amends section 47 to clarify\r\n\r\nthat  the  49% foreign ownership limit for a broadcasting\r\n\r\ncompany  applies  to  the aggregate of  shareholdings  by\r\n\r\nforeign sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, sections 46 and 73 of the Act are amended to\r\n\r\nbroaden the definition of foreign source and to widen the\r\n\r\nexemption  clause  in  the Act  respectively.   As  these\r\n\r\nprovisions are parallel to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNewspaper  and Printing Presses Act I shall not elaborate\r\n\r\nany further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree\r\n\r\nwith  the  amendments to limit foreign ownership  in  the\r\n\r\nbroadcasting  industry and the powers  empowered  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  This will ensure that the local media, and  in\r\n\r\nparticular  the broadcasting media, will not be  used  by\r\n\r\nforeign influences and provide necessary checks to  avoid\r\n\r\nundesirable outcomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as in the Newspaper and Printing Presses\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill, I would like to ask  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nurge the broadcasting companies to place more emphasis on\r\n\r\nthe  promotion of the arts.  The recent Arts Festival has\r\n\r\ndrawn  to  a  close.   It has been  touted  as  the  best\r\n\r\nfestival in its history.  But may I ask how many of these\r\n\r\nprogrammes,    including   both   local   and    overseas\r\n\r\nproductions, will reach the households in the heartlands?\r\n\r\nSome  of  these  productions  are  extremely  rare,   and\r\n\r\nconsidered  gems  in  the  arts  community.    They   are\r\n\r\nperformed  by leading and outstanding masters, directors,\r\n\r\nartistes,  musicians, conductors and choreographers.   We\r\n\r\nare indeed privileged to have them perform right here  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, yet it is regrettable that not enough is being\r\n\r\ndone to maximise their presence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a more regular basis, local professional arts\r\n\r\ncompanies,  like Singapore Symphony Orchestra,  Singapore\r\n\r\nChinese  Orchestra  and  Singapore  Dance  Theatre,  have\r\n\r\nregular performances.  These are considered national arts\r\n\r\ncompanies.  It is unfortunate that their performances and\r\n\r\nhard work are not telecast in its entirety on television,\r\n\r\nthe  reason being broadcasting companies fear  they  will\r\n\r\ncompromise profitability and viewership.  We should  ride\r\n\r\non  well-known personalities and excellent productions to\r\n\r\nenhance arts appreciation and arts viewership.  I am sure\r\n\r\nthat I have the support of the National Arts Council that\r\n\r\nthe media bears a moral responsibility and obligation to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npromote arts in Singapore.  We should encourage the media\r\n\r\nto  increase the broadcast time made available  for  arts\r\n\r\nprogramme   and   telecast  such  productions   live   to\r\n\r\nhouseholds, if not at least a delayed telecast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to look at the programmes on local\r\n\r\ntelevision  channels,  arts programmes  are  almost  non-existent.   In  a  week's television programme  schedule,\r\n\r\nonly  about 5.5 hours of programmes broadcast on  Central\r\n\r\nChannel  are  arts related programmes.  This  constitutes\r\n\r\nabout  4.7% of the channel's total broadcast  time  in  a\r\n\r\nweek.   If  we look at all the local channels,  including\r\n\r\nChannel NewsAsia, Suria, Channels 5 and 8, and Channels I\r\n\r\nand  U,  arts programmes make up less than 1%.  We should\r\n\r\ncultivate  our  local  media to broadcast  selected  arts\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  especially local productions, bringing  them\r\n\r\nto the heartlanders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent exchange of letters in the media between\r\n\r\nMediaCorp   Singapore   and  Singapore   Press   Holdings\r\n\r\n(MediaWorks)  on the amount of subsidy each receives  has\r\n\r\ndrawn widespread concern on public service broadcasting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public service broadcasting is television meant to\r\n\r\nmeet  diverse needs and interests, including that of  our\r\n\r\nminorities.    The  society  gains  as  one.    Increased\r\n\r\nbroadcast time of arts programmes will act as a  catalyst\r\n\r\nto  boost the arts scene and enhance appreciation  level.\r\n\r\nThe  arts  is  a  sector justifiable as a public  service\r\n\r\nbroadcasting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to see revenue derived by the Singapore\r\n\r\nBroadcasting  Authority be put to good use, as  subsidies\r\n\r\ngiven to broadcasting companies are to encourage them  in\r\n\r\ntheir efforts to boost our local arts scene.  We need  to\r\n\r\nre-position  the  arts  and make  it  accessible  to  the\r\n\r\nheartlanders.   I  believe the media  has  an  undeniable\r\n\r\nresponsibility in helping Singapore realise that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Act\r\n\r\nwas  passed in 1994 to regulate dealing in, operation of,\r\n\r\nand ownership in broadcasting services and broadcasting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napparatus.   Our Government should, as far  as  possible,\r\n\r\nlet  market  forces decide on ownership  of  broadcasting\r\n\r\ncompanies.   We  should have a more liberal  approach  to\r\n\r\nownership  of broadcasting in Singapore and  open  up  to\r\n\r\ninternationalised    broadcasting,    in    line     with\r\n\r\ninternationalisation of businesses, professions, cultural\r\n\r\nactivities  and  sports.   The need,  therefore,  to  get\r\n\r\napproval to appoint the Chief Executive Officer, Chairman\r\n\r\nor  Director  from  the Singapore Broadcasting  Authority\r\n\r\nseems  to go against normal market forces.  And I  wonder\r\n\r\nif  there have been any negative appointments recently to\r\n\r\nintroduce this strict rule in this proposed Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Broadcasting Authority may also wish to consider\r\n\r\nand  be allowed to have more liberal ways of broadcasting\r\n\r\nprogrammes  from abroad, especially ASEAN countries.   We\r\n\r\nshould  broadcast  more  ASEAN countries'  programmes  on\r\n\r\nradio and television, so that we become more educated and\r\n\r\nenlightened about our neighbours.  What do we know  about\r\n\r\nMyanmar, Kampuchea or even Thailand?  I will be the first\r\n\r\none  to  admit  that  I  know very little.   Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nBroadcasting Authority and the printing presses  likewise\r\n\r\nhave a national duty to educate our citizens and leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet and modern communication systems\r\n\r\ntraversed by our people abroad would certainly allow them\r\n\r\nto  have  more  access to broadcasts of these  countries.\r\n\r\nLet us, as Singaporeans, take the initiative of promoting\r\n\r\nASEAN  broadcasts in Singapore.  We could  perhaps  start\r\n\r\nwith  their channels involving culture, songs and sports.\r\n\r\nIn this way, other ASEAN countries too would do likewise.\r\n\r\nIt is important that locally, amongst our people and also\r\n\r\nin  the  international arena, we  are  seen  to  be  more\r\n\r\nliberal,  just like in our other walks of life, including\r\n\r\ntrade,  business, professional work, cultural  works  and\r\n\r\nsports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, let me deal\r\n\r\nwith what Mr Chandra Mohan has raised on the question  as\r\n\r\nto why we need\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  approve the appointments of Chairman, CEO  and  other\r\n\r\ndirectors of the Board for broadcasting companies.   This\r\n\r\nhas   been  the  policy  intent  all  along.   There  are\r\n\r\nprovisions  under the Newspaper and Printing Presses  Act\r\n\r\n(NPPA)  to  ensure that we appoint people  whom  we  feel\r\n\r\nwould take on the responsibility of running the newspaper\r\n\r\ncompany.   Likewise, we should do so for the broadcasting\r\n\r\ncompanies.   There  is no particular  reason  or  trigger\r\n\r\npoint, as Mr Mohan is suggesting, as to why we are  doing\r\n\r\nthe amendment at this point in time, except that it is  a\r\n\r\npolicy  intent, and that we are making the amendments  to\r\n\r\nthe Act, and so we have put it in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained earlier the reasons for doing so\r\n\r\nwhen  I  spoke  on the NPPA.  I emphasised in  my  Second\r\n\r\nReading speech that television broadcast, as a media,  is\r\n\r\nespecially potent in the way it arouses emotions.  It  is\r\n\r\none  thing  to read about a fiery speech in a  newspaper,\r\n\r\nbut  that  only appeals to those with a certain intellect\r\n\r\nwho  can  absorb the meaning of the words.  But when  you\r\n\r\nsee this on television, whether or not you understand the\r\n\r\nwords, you read the facial expressions, you read the body\r\n\r\nlanguage, you see whether the person is animated or  not,\r\n\r\nand  you  see  how the crowd reacts.  And  all  that  can\r\n\r\ncreate an emotive response.  For that reason, we want  to\r\n\r\nbe  particularly careful about how broadcasting companies\r\n\r\noperate.   And  for  this reason, we  have  put  in  this\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Andy Gan has appealed for the\r\n\r\nbroadcast  media to play a broader role in promoting  the\r\n\r\narts, and Mr Chandra Mohan has appealed for the promotion\r\n\r\nof  greater  understanding within ASEAN.  Both  are  good\r\n\r\nsuggestions, and it is commendable that we should want to\r\n\r\ntry  to do more in these areas.  Again, I would leave  it\r\n\r\nto the broadcast companies to consider these suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would just say that while we can put on\r\n\r\nprogrammes  on the arts or on ASEAN, at the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nday,   it  is  whether  people  watch  these  programmes.\r\n\r\nBroadcast companies are commercial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentities.   If  we subsidise them with a  lot  of  public\r\n\r\nfunds,  then  we  must be sure that the  subsidies  bring\r\n\r\nabout  a  certain benefit.  As it is, there  are  already\r\n\r\nquestions about whether we should collect as much  TV  or\r\n\r\nradio  licence  fees as we do now, and we have  explained\r\n\r\nwhy  this  is necessary, why this is important,  and  how\r\n\r\nthis   does   benefit  society  through  public   service\r\n\r\nbroadcasting  on channels such as Suria or Arts  Central.\r\n\r\nThe  fact  that  we can enjoy a certain  degree  of  arts\r\n\r\nprogramming  in  Arts  Central is because  we  have  such\r\n\r\npublic service broadcast funds.  To do more means that we\r\n\r\nhave  got to raise more fees.  And, again, I do not think\r\n\r\nthat will be popular or acceptable at this point in time.\r\n\r\nBut  within  the  limits, I think  we  can  take  up  the\r\n\r\nsuggestions  of  both Mr Andy Gan and Mr  Chandra  Mohan.\r\n\r\nBut we just need to bear in mind that it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  thing to produce a stage; it is quite another  thing\r\n\r\nto produce the audience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr David T.E.

However, in  some  cases,  the\r\n\r\nparent  agency  overseeing the VWO requests  to  pay  the\r\n\r\nrentals  directly to SLA to avoid incurring late  payment\r\n\r\ncharges.

Carbonation\r\n\r\nreduces  the  level of alkalinity in the  concrete,  thus\r\n\r\nallowing the steel bars in the concrete to corrode.   The\r\n\r\ncorrosion  causes  the steel bars to expand  forcing  the\r\n\r\nconcrete  surrounding  the  steel  to  crack  and  spall,\r\n\r\nexposing the steel bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spalling concrete is a natural phenomenon and it\r\n\r\noccurs  in  all  concrete buildings as the buildings  age\r\n\r\nover  time.  It is not peculiar to any flat type or flats\r\n\r\nwhich  were  built in certain years or during  a  certain\r\n\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB flat owners who encounter spalling concrete\r\n\r\nproblems  in  their  flats  can  report  them  to   their\r\n\r\nrespective HDB Branch Offices.

For flat  owners\r\n\r\nwho   have  difficulty  in  finding  a  suitable   repair\r\n\r\ncontractor on their own, HDB will also assist to  provide\r\n\r\nthem  with  a  list  of repair contractors  for  them  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate with on a private basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the lease, HDB flat owners are responsible for\r\n\r\nthe repair of spalling concrete in their flats.

In  dollar\r\n\r\nterms,  an adult would receive $10 subsidy per attendance\r\n\r\nfor  acute  illness  and $36 subsidy per  attendance  for\r\n\r\nchronic  illness.   For child and elderly  patients,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's subsidy is higher, at $15.50 per  attendance\r\n\r\nfor  acute  illness  and $54 per attendance  for  chronic\r\n\r\nillness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General practitioners (GPs) contracted under the\r\n\r\nPrimary Care Partnership Scheme (PCPS) are subsidised  on\r\n\r\nthe  same  basis as elderly attendance at the polyclinics\r\n\r\nto  cover their operating costs, rental and GST.

E. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David T. E. Lim:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1997 compensation to Singapore\r\n\r\nTelecommunications (SingTel) was for the  premature  loss\r\n\r\nof   its  monopoly  rights.   Deloitte  and  Touche,   an\r\n\r\ninternational  accounting  firm,  was  engaged   by   the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Authority of Singapore (now the  Info-communications  Development Authority  of  Singapore)  to\r\n\r\nwork  out  the  compensation amount.  They  computed  the\r\n\r\ncompensation  based on the loss of future earnings  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of the early expiry of SingTel's monopoly rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review committee of civil servants endorsed the\r\n\r\nsum  recommended.  As it was based on loss  of  earnings,\r\n\r\nand  as  earnings would normally be subject to  tax,  the\r\n\r\ncommittee  worked on the basis that the compensation  was\r\n\r\ntaxable.   As  this  was a natural assumption,  it  never\r\n\r\noccurred  to  the  committee to ask  the  Inland  Revenue\r\n\r\nAuthority  of Singapore (IRAS) for a specific  ruling  on\r\n\r\ntax.   Unfortunately, subsequent events showed  that  the\r\n\r\ncommittee was mistaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chronology confirms that the error was an honest\r\n\r\nmistake  arising  from  a wrong assumption  by  the  1997\r\n\r\nreview committee. While a lesson has been learnt from the\r\n\r\nerror,  it  would be inappropriate to punish  the  review\r\n\r\ncommittee  or any of its members for it. To do  so  would\r\n\r\nonly  encourage a culture where civil servants  shy  away\r\n\r\nfrom  taking responsibilities, and avoid making decisions\r\n\r\nfor fear of committing mistakes.  This is the opposite of\r\n\r\nwhat  we  are  trying to achieve, not just in  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  but  in  Singapore society. However,  it  is  no\r\n\r\nexcuse  for civil servants not to endeavour to get  their\r\n\r\nfacts  right, and to check and double-check  details  and\r\n\r\nassumptions.\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
