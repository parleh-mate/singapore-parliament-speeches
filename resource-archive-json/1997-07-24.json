The  Minister   has   also\r\n\r\ndisclosed that currently, our NPPs are understaffed.   The  NPCs\r\n\r\ncan solve this problem because 120 officers can man each NPC  at\r\n\r\nany  one time, compared with the current 15 officers per NPP  in\r\n\r\nthe 92 NPPs nationwide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I applaud the efforts of the Singapore Police Force to\r\n\r\nbe  constantly on the look-out to improve the manner  we  handle\r\n\r\ninternal  security  of  our country making  Singapore  safe  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   My  concern is that this very restructuring  may\r\n\r\ncompromise the security and safety of Singaporeans.  In my view,\r\n\r\nthe  introduction  of  the NPCs is in  actual  fact  a  move  to\r\n\r\ndownsize the Police Force.  I do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  believe  for  one  moment that this is  done  to  cut  down\r\n\r\nemployment  of  police  officers,  but  rather,  I  believe  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  or  the  Police  Force has  got  a  manpower  shortage\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with all employers in Singapore, the Singapore Police\r\n\r\nForce  also  faces a similar problem, ie, shortage of  manpower.\r\n\r\nMore so in the uniformed services as generally Singaporeans shun\r\n\r\nsuch  jobs.  I understand also the staff turnover is high  which\r\n\r\nmeans that we have difficulty in keeping those already recruited\r\n\r\ninto  the  Force.   This problem, Sir, could perhaps  be  solved\r\n\r\nthrough several ways.  One is of course the recruitment of  non-Singaporeans  which  the  Police Force is  already  doing.  More\r\n\r\nshould  be  done as there are well-trained police personnel  who\r\n\r\nare more than happy to make Singapore their home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other measure is the freeing of manpower from non-essential areas and deploying well-trained officers to jobs\r\n\r\nwhich  are crucial to the effectiveness of the Police Force.   I\r\n\r\nshall  speak  more  on  this subject  when  I  move  a  separate\r\n\r\namendment on the privatisation of services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third and perhaps most important measure is to review the\r\n\r\nsalaries  and  terms of service of the organisation.   I  am  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  this  measure as we must not  take  our  low  crime\r\n\r\nsituation  for granted.  This low crime situation is due  mainly\r\n\r\nto  the  effectiveness  of the police in  deterrence  and  crime\r\n\r\nsolving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This effectiveness must be maintained if we are going to\r\n\r\ngive Singaporeans the Best Home.  Peace time security is no less\r\n\r\nimportant than preparing for external defence.  Hence, I am most\r\n\r\nconcerned that the restructuring may mean that we see less  foot\r\n\r\npatrols,  less bicycle patrols and less policemen on the  roads.\r\n\r\nSuch presence may seem to be unproductive and wasteful.  But  it\r\n\r\nis  these  very efforts which deter crime.  It is these  efforts\r\n\r\nwhich give our citizens a sense of security and confidence.  How\r\n\r\ncan this be measured or valued?  Just like how do we measure  or\r\n\r\nvalue  National Service.  Our police, aptly named the Home Team,\r\n\r\nis constantly in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndirect  contact with Singaporeans and tourists alike  and  their\r\n\r\nmorale and pride must be maintained at the highest level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this House would like to be assured by the Minister\r\n\r\nthat the reorganisation will enable Singaporeans to continue  to\r\n\r\nenjoy the safety and security which we currently have, and  that\r\n\r\nhis  Ministry will do its utmost to make our Home  Team  into  a\r\n\r\nworld class Police Force, if there is such a measure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, before\r\n\r\nI  speak,  I  suppose  I should say that  I  have  no  pecuniary\r\n\r\ninterest when I refer to instances but, of course, I am  drawing\r\n\r\nfrom my knowledge and experience at the Criminal Bar.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to speak on the accountability of the uniformed\r\n\r\norganisations  in  this country to the public.   We  have  heard\r\n\r\noften enough from the Ministers and from the PAP leaders of  how\r\n\r\nthe Government is transparent and accountable to the people.   I\r\n\r\nthink  the time has now come for us to translate some  of  these\r\n\r\nutterances  into  positive steps to show  that  the  Police  are\r\n\r\naccountable,  not only the Police but also the  other  uniformed\r\n\r\norganisations, are accountable to the people.   I  think  it  is\r\n\r\ntime  we gave some measure of control over what happens in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  to  our people.  And my party has been advocating  this\r\n\r\nfor some time now in its slogan \"Power to the People\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to speak on the role of the Police Force. Sir, the\r\n\r\nPolice, first and foremost, serve the public.  They are here  to\r\n\r\nlook after the interest of the public and to protect them.  They\r\n\r\nmust not be seen, and it would be dangerous if they are seen, to\r\n\r\nbe serving their political masters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago when we had a prosecution against the party,\r\n\r\none police officer, who was in the witness stand, quite candidly\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Anything that comes from a political party, I can't  deal\r\n\r\nwith  it.  I have to refer it to the Minister for instructions,\"\r\n\r\nalthough   he  had  the  power  to  deal  with  that  particular\r\n\r\napplication  from the party.  But that is not the  point  of  my\r\n\r\namendment today.  My amendment is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nabout  the  complaints  that are made, from  time  to  time,  by\r\n\r\nmembers of the public about violence used by the police officers\r\n\r\nwhilst  they  are  under questioning or in the  custody  of  the\r\n\r\npolice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, any such complaint is referred to the\r\n\r\nInternal   Investigation  Section  of   the   police.    It   is\r\n\r\ninvestigated by police officers, although we are told it forms a\r\n\r\nseparate  branch of the police.  But nothing is said  about  how\r\n\r\nthe  investigations are carried out and if there is any  report,\r\n\r\nthat report is not made known to the public or to the victim who\r\n\r\nmade  the complaint.  He is merely told in a very curt note that\r\n\r\nthere is no evidence of his complaint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some four years ago, there was a boy of 14 who was taken in\r\n\r\nby  the  police and he was detained for about seven hours.   And\r\n\r\nwhen  he  was  finally  released, he was found  to  have  severe\r\n\r\ninjuries  on  him.   The  father reported  it  to  the  Internal\r\n\r\nInvestigation  Section  and later on consulted  the  solicitors.\r\n\r\nWhen  the solicitors wrote to the Division for the names of  the\r\n\r\npolice  officers  who  had interrogated the  boy  and  in  whose\r\n\r\ncustody he had been for seven hours, the Divisional head refused\r\n\r\nto  disclose the names of the officers, and this dragged on  for\r\n\r\nsome period of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think in the cause of transparency and accountability, it\r\n\r\nis  time  that the Ministry considered setting up a body outside\r\n\r\nthe  Police Force to consider complaints against the  police  by\r\n\r\nmembers of the public.  In Britain, they have had for some  time\r\n\r\nnow  what  is  known  as a police watch committee.   Is  it  not\r\n\r\npossible  for  us  in  Singapore, in  this  age,  to  have  such\r\n\r\ncommittees   in  every  police  area,  composed  of  respectable\r\n\r\ncitizens living in that area and who would be responsible enough\r\n\r\nto act responsibly, to inquire into the complaints and to direct\r\n\r\nor  to request any action to be taken, if action is to be taken?\r\n\r\nThat would give our citizens and the public a greater measure of\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the Police Force, that there is  an  independent\r\n\r\nneutral  body which will investigate any complaints made against\r\n\r\nthe police by them.  That would enhance\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  role of the police in the eyes of the people, and they will\r\n\r\nno  longer  be  looked  upon as merely serving  their  political\r\n\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, I do not know why\r\n\r\nthe  NCMP  always refers to Britain.  Why do we always  have  to\r\n\r\nfollow  Britain?  I think the British have their  own  problems.\r\n\r\nThank you very much, we can manage ourselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the latest announcement by the Ministry on the pay\r\n\r\nreview of the Police Force is anxiously awaited.  I hope it will\r\n\r\nbe  positive.  It will no doubt help to boost the morale of  the\r\n\r\nForce but, more importantly, it will attract more aspiring young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to make law enforcement as their career.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police Force has always placed human resource as its\r\n\r\ntop  priority.  It constantly upgrades the skill of the officers\r\n\r\nand reorganises the Force, in order to be more effective and  to\r\n\r\nkeep up with the ever changing situation in crime fighting.  The\r\n\r\nrecent move to form Neighbourhood Police Centres, by integrating\r\n\r\nthe NPPs would go a long way to enhance the effectiveness of our\r\n\r\nmen  in  uniform.   On  this,  I  am  more  optimistic  than  my\r\n\r\ncolleague, Mr Chng.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no matter how one reorganises, the Force will\r\n\r\nalways  require more able and dedicated recruits  and  with  the\r\n\r\nscarce  human  resource in Singapore and with  so  many  sectors\r\n\r\ncompeting  for so few,  it will always be difficult  to  attract\r\n\r\nyoung, dedicated people to the Force.  I would therefore like to\r\n\r\nsuggest that since not all posts in the Police Force have to  be\r\n\r\ntrained  so vigorously to serve as law enforcement officers,  it\r\n\r\nwould  seem a waste to deploy all those who have undergone  such\r\n\r\ntraining to serve in duties which do not require such discipline\r\n\r\nand  skill.  I am referring to those officers being deployed  to\r\n\r\ntasks   such  as  issuing  parking  summons  for  minor  traffic\r\n\r\noffences, clerical or administrative duties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some countries, I understand, issuing summons for\r\n\r\nillegal  parking or minor traffic offences is being  privatised,\r\n\r\nor they engage retirees to carry out this task.  As for clerical\r\n\r\nand administrative duties,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthose  who are engaged in the Police Force need not be from  the\r\n\r\nuniformed  group.   They  can be drawn from  the  civilian  work\r\n\r\nforce.    This  would mean that those who join the Police  Force\r\n\r\nand  have undergone vigorous training will be deployed only  for\r\n\r\nactive police duty, so as to maximise their effectiveness in the\r\n\r\nuniformed group.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun bin A. Ghani:</b> Sir, may I seek a clarification\r\n\r\nfrom  Mr  Jeyaretnam?   I thought Mr Jeyaretnam  said  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Police  and other personnel are  not  accountable  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Is he saying that police  and  uniformed  personnel\r\n\r\nare  not accountable to the people of Singapore?  He said it  in\r\n\r\nhis introduction just now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I thought I made it quite clear when I spoke\r\n\r\nthat  when  the public have complaints against the Police,  they\r\n\r\nare  not  told  how  the  investigation was  carried  out,  what\r\n\r\nstatements were taken and the final report is not made known  to\r\n\r\nthe  person who made the complaint.  That is exactly what I mean\r\n\r\nwhen  I  say accountable.  The Police have to be accountable  to\r\n\r\nthe  people, and if the people have a grievance, then the Police\r\n\r\nshould answer the people and account to them for their actions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I just like to\r\n\r\nmake  a  point about Mr Jeyaretnam's comments just  now  on  the\r\n\r\ncomplaint  against the Police.  He, of course,  will  know  that\r\n\r\nthere  are always checks against the misuse or improper  use  of\r\n\r\nmethods  of  interrogation by police officers, not  only  it  is\r\n\r\nprovided  for  in  the  Penal Code in respect  of  offences  for\r\n\r\noppressive  questioning,  the courts have  also  taken  it  upon\r\n\r\nthemselves to monitor and to look at statements made by  accused\r\n\r\npersons  to  police officers to see whether they are voluntarily\r\n\r\nobtained.   And there have been some cases where such statements\r\n\r\nhave been rejected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do believe that a well-trained professional Police\r\n\r\nForce would want their statements taken by them to be admissible\r\n\r\nas  evidence.   I think checks and balances are  in  the  system\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  control  of  the  Police  and  that  they   are\r\n\r\naccountable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to crime control in neighbourhoods. Sir,\r\n\r\nSingapore  is fortunate to have a comparatively low crime  rate.\r\n\r\nWe must be one of the very few countries in the world that needs\r\n\r\nto  advertise that low crime rate does not mean no  crime.   The\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood  Police  Post (NPP) is a key  institution  in  the\r\n\r\nfight  against  crime in Singapore.  There are now  91  NPPs  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The NPP is the most visible link between the  Police\r\n\r\nand  the  people.  It forges ties between officers and residents\r\n\r\nand  provides  the  latter with a real sense of  security.   The\r\n\r\nofficers  also  get to know the neighbourhood  well,  adding  to\r\n\r\ntheir ability to cope with local crime quickly.  Since the start\r\n\r\nof  the  scheme  in 1983, the NPP has gained a solid  reputation\r\n\r\namong  residents.   It  is  usually  the  first  recourse   when\r\n\r\nresidents  want  to report a crime or dispute.   The  fact  that\r\n\r\ncrime  is generally low  in the estates testifies to the success\r\n\r\nof the police in general and the NPP scheme in particular.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this month, the Minister announced the setting up\r\n\r\nof  three Neighbourhood Police Centres (NPCs) to provide  better\r\n\r\nservice to the residents; the first to be set up in October, the\r\n\r\nothers  in  the  first  part of next  year.   Sir,  the  reasons\r\n\r\nreported for the redesign of the NPP scheme are said to be  two-fold:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, expanding the duties of NPP officers will encourage\r\n\r\nbetter  qualified persons to join the Police.   Second, the  new\r\n\r\nscheme  will  be  more  efficient in  terms  of  using  manpower\r\n\r\nresources.   Whether the redesign will achieve  these  ends,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, remains to be seen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, there are several concerns that I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister can address.  First, will the reorganisation mean  that\r\n\r\nno  new  Neighbourhood Police Posts will be built?  This  is  of\r\n\r\nparticular  concern  to  those who  have  just  moved  into  new\r\n\r\nneighbourhoods. For example, Woodlands is still  served  by  the\r\n\r\nBukit  Panjang NPP.  It is natural for residents who  have  just\r\n\r\nmoved  to a new area, such as Neighbourhood 5 or 6 in Woodlands,\r\n\r\nto  feel  more insecure as they need time to adjust to  the  new\r\n\r\nenvironment.   They, more than anyone else,  in  my  experience,\r\n\r\nhave requested for more police patrols.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, does the redesigned structure mean more or less\r\n\r\nvisibility  in terms of foot or bicycle patrols in the  estates?\r\n\r\nIt  has  to  be  recognised  that  one  of  the  most  effective\r\n\r\ndeterrents  against  crime  has  been  the  presence  of  police\r\n\r\nofficers in vulnerable areas.  Fast response cars or car patrols\r\n\r\nmay  be  more efficient, but not as effective in terms of police\r\n\r\npresence as men on foot patrols.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, will the redesigning of the NPPs also take into\r\n\r\naccount  the fact that it is now possible to keep watch  through\r\n\r\nthe use of surveillance cameras?  Surveillance equipment may  be\r\n\r\nexpensive but never as good as officers on the ground.  However,\r\n\r\nthey  can  be  on  24  hours  a day providing  round  the  clock\r\n\r\nsecurity.   These  cameras are already a common  sight  in  some\r\n\r\nprivate  properties  here.  Although they  are  used  in  public\r\n\r\nstreets  and  facilities, it is much more  widespread  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries  such as England.  In the long run, such  devices  may\r\n\r\nhelp   to  alleviate  the  shortage  of  manpower  in  uniformed\r\n\r\nservices, which was referred to by other MPs, while providing  a\r\n\r\nhigh  degree of security in areas monitored by such  means.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, I do not mean to advocate that these devices are  placed\r\n\r\nin such a manner as to intrude on the privacy of residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is worth emphasising in closing that the prevention\r\n\r\nof  crime is not only the sole task of the police.  It  is  even\r\n\r\nmore  important for all residents to be aware of  the  need  for\r\n\r\nsecurity.   All  too  often, one finds that  residents  complain\r\n\r\nabout  petty  thefts  of their belongings  left  out  in  public\r\n\r\ncorridors,  claiming that the police have not done  enough.  The\r\n\r\npublic needs to be aware that the control of crime is not just a\r\n\r\nmatter  for  the  police  but it is the responsibility  that  is\r\n\r\nshared by all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the speaker, by way of\r\n\r\nclarification, when he talks about interrogation methods of  the\r\n\r\npolice and the admissibility of statements, is he aware that  in\r\n\r\n1989 three men were alleged to have confessed to murder after\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n28  hours  of interrogation when they were totally innocent  and\r\n\r\nfinally were acquitted by the court?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

There is also\r\n\r\na rise in the number of female delinquents.  Contrary to popular\r\n\r\nbelief  that delinquency is a problem of broken homes,  some  of\r\n\r\nthese  delinquents seem to come from affluent families as  well.\r\n\r\nThey are at an age not to realise that if caught and charged for\r\n\r\nmisdeamours  it  may result in an uncertain future.   Hence,  we\r\n\r\nmust  implement measures to prevent such young Singaporeans from\r\n\r\nhaving their careless behaviour criminalised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore welcome the implementation of the ban on under-16s from tea dances and discos. This is but one measure.\r\n\r\nAnother    measure   which   should   be   considered   is   the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  a  curfew on teenagers in  selected  popular\r\n\r\nlocations.   Young Singaporeans are drawn to the  bright  lights\r\n\r\nand  reading  media  reports.  There seems  to  be  a  trend  in\r\n\r\nbelieving that it is fashionable for young people to be  members\r\n\r\nof a gang.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When enforcement measures are implemented, unfortunately, a\r\n\r\nbreach will bring the young offender face to face with the  law.\r\n\r\nA  tough  decision will then have to be made by the  enforcement\r\n\r\nagency, which\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  to  prosecute or not to prosecute.  Prosecution of  a  young\r\n\r\noffender is often viewed negatively, especially when a custodial\r\n\r\nsentence  is  imposed after conviction.  Parents are  inevitably\r\n\r\nthe first persons to declare that their children are not bad  or\r\n\r\nguilty, even when the evidence before them is overwhelming.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delinquents often cite parents' behaviour, such as neglect,\r\n\r\nabuse, indifference to over-indulgence or over-protectiveness or\r\n\r\nbeing  too strict, as a cause for their behaviour.  Such parents\r\n\r\neven  blame  the  schools for their children's  poor  behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhat  all  this  means is that delinquency and a host  of  other\r\n\r\nrelated problems are very much a multi-faceted one.  By the time\r\n\r\nthe  police is involved, much harm has already taken place.  The\r\n\r\nlucky  ones may get away with a stern warning.  But the  not  so\r\n\r\nfortunate  ones will have their criminal records with  them  for\r\n\r\nthe  rest of their lives.  Therefore, this issue is not strictly\r\n\r\na police problem as many have mistakenly believed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that an Inter-Ministry Committee has been put in\r\n\r\nplace  to look into this problem and the imposition of a ban  on\r\n\r\nunder-16s  from  discos and tea dances is only  one  measure  to\r\n\r\nprevent the problem from escalating.  It will be useful for  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to enlighten us on the workings of this Committee  and\r\n\r\nelaborate  on  some  of  the  possible  measures  that  will  be\r\n\r\nimplemented to arrest this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, the ban on teenagers below\r\n\r\nthe  age  of 16 entering premises that sell liquor has  received\r\n\r\nvery  positive response from parents, especially in view of  the\r\n\r\nincreasing incidence of reports where youngsters got  beaten  up\r\n\r\nby  gangs  and the increase in cases of teenagers being arrested\r\n\r\nfor rioting.  However, I wonder how effective this measure would\r\n\r\nbe  to  prevent  our  youths  from joining  gangs  and  creating\r\n\r\ntrouble, as they can always find other places to engage in  such\r\n\r\nillegal   activities.   In  fact,  the  source  for   recruiting\r\n\r\ngenerally  innocent youths into gangs often  happens  in  places\r\n\r\nsuch  as  void  decks, shopping malls, schools  and  other  such\r\n\r\npublic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nplaces.  By the time they caused problems in these places,  such\r\n\r\nas pubs and discos, the damage has already been done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, very often both parents are working and are\r\n\r\nnot  able  to spend sufficient time to monitor their  children's\r\n\r\nactivities.   Once  I  was  asked  to  give  assistance  to   my\r\n\r\nconstituents.   Both  husband and wife are  professionals.  They\r\n\r\nwere shocked to discover that their son was arrested for rioting\r\n\r\nand  being a member of a teenage gang.  They have absolutely  no\r\n\r\nprior  knowledge  of  their son's activities.   The  son,  being\r\n\r\nextremely  timid,  was  intimidated into  joining  the  gang  by\r\n\r\nfriends while hanging out in one of these areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, secret societies have effectively been wiped\r\n\r\nout.  I am sure our Criminal Investigations Department (CID)  is\r\n\r\nmore  than  capable  to do the same by tracking  down  the  ring\r\n\r\nleaders  of  such  youth  gangs.  Once these  ring  leaders  are\r\n\r\nimmobilised,  all  the so-called followers,  most  of  whom  are\r\n\r\nmisguided youths and not hardcore criminals, would not  be  able\r\n\r\nto  cause  trouble  on  their  own.   Action  has  to  be  taken\r\n\r\nimmediately  before  these gangs can take  root  and  become  as\r\n\r\nnotorious as the secret societies of the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, over\r\n\r\nthe   past   five  years,  I  have  been  speaking  on  juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency and every year I heard that new measures were  taken\r\n\r\nto prevent juvenile delinquency.  This is very encouraging.  But\r\n\r\nI  still  feel that the Ministry of Home Affairs and the  Police\r\n\r\nshould   not   be  the  only  agencies  dealing  with   juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency.  I think this is a matter that involves  the  whole\r\n\r\nsociety - parents, schools and other social components.   It  is\r\n\r\nthe common responsibility of all the people.  So it is not right\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Police should be asked\r\n\r\nto take the whole responsibility.  It is not right for people to\r\n\r\nperceive this as such.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with my colleagues that prevention of juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency  should  be handled by an Inter-Ministry  Committee.\r\n\r\nIt can be better solved\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthrough such a Committee.  Every year we have new measures.   It\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mean  that  the question of juvenile  delinquency  is\r\n\r\ngetting  worse. It also means that our juvenile delinquents  are\r\n\r\nbecoming  more sophisticated.  The moment you have new  measures\r\n\r\nthey   know  how  to  circumvent  them.   When  the  number   of\r\n\r\ndelinquents  arrested  is declining, could  it  be  because  our\r\n\r\njuvenile  delinquents have learned how to avoid being  arrested?\r\n\r\nIn  any  case, I appreciate Prof. Ho Peng Kee's announcement  of\r\n\r\nthe four measures earlier to curb juvenile delinquency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to ask the Minister a few questions.\r\n\r\nThe Minister announced that from 1st October, young people below\r\n\r\nthe age of 16 will be banned from attending tea dances?  Why 16?\r\n\r\nWhy  cannot you include those below 18?  Those below  18  should\r\n\r\nalso be banned from going to discos and tea dances.  In December\r\n\r\nlast year, we imposed a ban on youngsters below 16 from going to\r\n\r\nthe billiard saloons. We can increase the age restriction to 18.\r\n\r\nWe  should  reconsider the definition for juvenile  delinquents.\r\n\r\nIs it young people below 16 or below 18?  I think we should have\r\n\r\na consensus on the definition of juvenile delinquents so that it\r\n\r\nwould  be  easier for us to enforce the ban more effectively  on\r\n\r\nyoung people going into such undesirable places.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dancing by itself is not a problem. It is the lighting,\r\n\r\nthe sound system, the whole atmosphere of the dance hall that is\r\n\r\nexciting  the young people.  Our community centres  should  also\r\n\r\nhave  similar activities to provide places for young  people  to\r\n\r\nexpend their energy, in the right environment\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point here is the appointment of discipline\r\n\r\nmasters  in  the schools.  Some teachers have asked  me  whether\r\n\r\ntheir  safety  may be endangered.  How could they  be  protected\r\n\r\nwhen they are threatened?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is to strengthen crime prevention education\r\n\r\nin schools.  The Minister said that we could have more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntalks  and  seminars to teach our young people  how  to  prevent\r\n\r\ncrimes.  They can also be shown some educational video tapes.  I\r\n\r\nthink  these  are very good things.  I would even  suggest  that\r\n\r\nthey should have pamphlets and posters printed on prevention  of\r\n\r\njuvenile  crimes,  and even handbooks or small little  pamphlets\r\n\r\nfor  the parents, social organisations and other members of  the\r\n\r\npublic  for them to read and understand the problem.  This  will\r\n\r\nhelp to prevent our young people from falling into crime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that the street wise programme, on the face of\r\n\r\nit,  is  good for the young people.  We want them to voluntarily\r\n\r\njoin such programmes.  To a certain extent it is a bit difficult\r\n\r\nto implement because these young people are not mature enough in\r\n\r\nmany  cases.   If  it is possible, I feel that we  may  make  it\r\n\r\ncompulsory for certain young people to join this programme.   We\r\n\r\nshould not leave it to them to join on their own free will.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, cases of\r\n\r\njuvenile delinquency in Singapore are on the increase and it has\r\n\r\ncome  to a stage that gives us cause for concern.  According  to\r\n\r\nPolice  statistics,  among  the juvenile  delinquents  who  were\r\n\r\narrested  last year, 84% of them were students and 70%  of  them\r\n\r\nwere  youngsters between the age of 14 and 15.  Very often, they\r\n\r\nrealise the seriousness of the offences only after they have got\r\n\r\ninto  big  trouble  and it is too late.  Among  those  who  were\r\n\r\narrested, some were charged with drug addiction, consumption  of\r\n\r\nalcohol and disorderly behaviour.  Recently, Chief Justice  Yong\r\n\r\nPung  How pointed out that in the last few months, among the  18\r\n\r\ncases  of  rioting, 16 of them involved juveniles.  Very  often,\r\n\r\nthese  young people will go around in gangs and they will loiter\r\n\r\nin  public  places  and amusement parks at night,  fighting  and\r\n\r\ncausing trouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Ministry of Home Affairs' Addendum to the\r\n\r\nPresidential Address this year, the Police announced  that  they\r\n\r\nwould   be  working  closely  with  the  Ministry  of  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nschools  and  voluntary  welfare  organisations  to  deal   with\r\n\r\njuvenile  delinquency.  At present, discipline  masters  of  the\r\n\r\nschools  have  been appointed as officers of  the  Police  Cadet\r\n\r\nCorps  to  enhance their authority in disciplining  the  problem\r\n\r\nstudents.   Following  that, the Government  has  also  formally\r\n\r\nannounced  on 16th July, four measures to ban youths  under  the\r\n\r\nage  of  16 from attending tea dances.  This is also to  prevent\r\n\r\nthe  young  people  from  getting into trouble.   Although  some\r\n\r\npeople  feel that this will not resolve the matter and may  even\r\n\r\ncause  the young people to go underground, I personally  do  not\r\n\r\nagree  with  them.   I  feel that when  parents  are  unable  to\r\n\r\ndiscipline their children, as a responsible Government, for  the\r\n\r\nfuture  of  the children and for law and order in  society,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's intervention and adoption of preventive measures is\r\n\r\nabsolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the four measures adopted and\r\n\r\nannounced by the Government.  However, there is no mention as to\r\n\r\nwhat  penalties  these  young people  will  face  if  they  have\r\n\r\nviolated  any of these regulations.  Are they given just  verbal\r\n\r\nwarning or will they be sent to the schools to be dealt with?  I\r\n\r\nhope that the Minister will give us a reply on that.  Six months\r\n\r\nafter  the implementation of these measures, if the effects  are\r\n\r\nnot  significant,  we  should have more  stringent  measures  to\r\n\r\nenhance the effects.  Maybe we should have curfew or measures of\r\n\r\nthat sort to prevent juvenile delinquency from rising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These young teenagers are still in school. Their intellect\r\n\r\nis  not  fully  developed.   Their  physiological  reaction  and\r\n\r\nconduct  are  easily  influenced by  external  factors.   It  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for us to help them to prevent them from  going  into\r\n\r\nwrong ways, and to maintain peace and order in our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nthank  the  MPs  who  have  spoken  about  the  efficiency   and\r\n\r\nprofessionalism of our Police Force and praised them  that  they\r\n\r\nhave done a good job.  I am sure this will spur them further and\r\n\r\nmotivate  them  to do better.  And I also welcome any  justified\r\n\r\ncriticism of their deficiency because I am sure they know\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat they are deficient in some areas, and if there are ways for\r\n\r\nthem  to  do  better, they will welcome suggestions  to  perform\r\n\r\nbetter.   But criticism about their performance, whether  it  is\r\n\r\nabout  brutality or the way they go about their  job,  which  is\r\n\r\nunjustified and unwarranted or there is no evidence  to  support\r\n\r\nit,  I am sure, would not help them in their work.  It may  just\r\n\r\nde-motivate  them.   But, of course, I  know  my  officers  will\r\n\r\nalways work hard, they try hard, and they will do their best  in\r\n\r\nwhatever that is given to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are concerned also, like Mr Chng and some of my\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  about  the competitiveness  of  the  Police  Force,\r\n\r\nwhether  or not we are able to recruit the right kind of people,\r\n\r\nand enough people into the Force.  As we know, Singapore faces a\r\n\r\nmanpower  shortage and we have hundreds of thousands of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.  The private and public sectors are competing  for  the\r\n\r\nsame  pool  of school leavers.  So we have to always continually\r\n\r\nlook for ways and means of making our scheme more attractive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have recently set up with the Prime Minister's Office an\r\n\r\nMHA  Joint  Committee  to  review the terms  and  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice  for  all the uniformed services under the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs,  not  just for the Police  Officers.   This  will\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  officers  are fairly  compensated  for  their\r\n\r\nsacrifices  and their responsibilities and it will  help  us  to\r\n\r\nmaintain the competitiveness of the uniformed services in MHA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preliminary findings show that the low entry, ranks and\r\n\r\nsalaries,  as well as the lower progression rates,  have  indeed\r\n\r\nworked  against  us in attracting and retaining  especially  the\r\n\r\njunior officers.  We need better progression prospects and  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive pay structures to attract people, and I  think  that\r\n\r\nwould  be  the  outcome of the review.  We are also  looking  at\r\n\r\nmanaging  our  uniformed  groups'  salaries  autonomously,  that\r\n\r\nmeans, within the Ministry, so that we can react to changes more\r\n\r\neffectively  and  promptly.  The study should  be  completed  by\r\n\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay and benefits are not the only things that the MHA would\r\n\r\nbe  improving.  In parallel, we are also introducing schemes  to\r\n\r\nprovide officers with ample opportunities to upgrade themselves.\r\n\r\nWe   would  also  restructure  their  jobs  to  make  them  more\r\n\r\ninteresting  and  challenging and thus make  their  career  more\r\n\r\nfulfilling and meaningful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Kenneth Chen that non-core Police functions\r\n\r\n- the functions are crime prevention, investigation, maintenance\r\n\r\nof  law and order - should not be done by a fully trained Police\r\n\r\nOfficer.   I  agree  with  him that the  job,  say,  of  issuing\r\n\r\nsummonses for parking offences actually does not need  a  Police\r\n\r\nOfficer to do.  We need somebody to do the job.  As you  see  in\r\n\r\nthe  HDB, the parking wardens are not Police Officers, yet  they\r\n\r\nare  able,  when  they  are empowered, to  issue  summonses  for\r\n\r\nparking offences.  So we will do more of that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng also asked us to consider recruiting foreigners\r\n\r\ninto  the Police Force.  We do not have a special programme just\r\n\r\nto  target  foreigners but if there are suitable foreigners  who\r\n\r\nunderstand  our  culture  and society,  who  are  interested  in\r\n\r\nserving  here  and have the same commitment and  willingness  to\r\n\r\nsettle down in Singapore, we will certainly consider them.   But\r\n\r\nthey   must   meet   the  same  recruitment  criteria   as   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   We do not have one set of rules  for  foreigners\r\n\r\nand another set for locals.  So far, we have recruited a few and\r\n\r\nwe will continue to recruit them if they apply to us and if they\r\n\r\nmeet the job requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerns were expressed about the redesigning or\r\n\r\nrestructuring of the Neighbourhood Police Posts.  Mr Chng put it\r\n\r\nas if we are downsizing the Police Force.  We are not downsizing\r\n\r\nthe  Police  Force.   Let me assure him that  the  Police  Force\r\n\r\nmanpower  strength  will remain the same, if  not  increase,  if\r\n\r\nthere  are  new  job  requirements that will  need  more  Police\r\n\r\nOfficers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also wants assurances that our redesigning or\r\n\r\nrestructuring of the NPP will continue to provide the same level\r\n\r\nof  service  to the public.  Again, let me, at the outset,  say,\r\n\r\nyes, that will continue to be so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked for the details of this new NPC (Neighbourhood\r\n\r\nPolice Centre) system.  Let me try to give a bit more details on\r\n\r\nthat.   Our  current  NPP system was implemented  in  1983.   No\r\n\r\nsystem  can  remain  cast in concrete or in iron,  and  last  us\r\n\r\nforever  even  when circumstances change.  Indeed, circumstances\r\n\r\nhave  changed.   That is why I have asked the  Police  to  do  a\r\n\r\nreview  of  the NPP system, bearing in mind that the profile  of\r\n\r\nnew  entrants into the labour force has changed and also bearing\r\n\r\nin mind that the public expectations of the service level of the\r\n\r\nPolice  have also changed, and that we are competing  with  many\r\n\r\nother organisations for the same scarce pool of manpower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review was driven by three key considerations.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  it was a growing difficulty that the Police  faces  in\r\n\r\nrecruiting  junior Police Officers, especially given  the  tight\r\n\r\nlabour  market and the improving educational profile.  So  there\r\n\r\nis  a need for Police to make better use of the limited manpower\r\n\r\nresources available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason that drives us to do this review is that\r\n\r\nas  we have increasingly better qualified officers, then the job\r\n\r\nscope and challenges must also expand.  In other words, you just\r\n\r\ncannot  have  a  polytechnic diploma holder  becoming  a  Police\r\n\r\nOfficer  and sitting at the counter doing the same mundane  work\r\n\r\nof changing identity card addresses.  We have to widen his job's\r\n\r\nscope to make it more challenging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we also need to involve the community more in the\r\n\r\narea  of crime prevention, so that they have a greater ownership\r\n\r\nover  the  security of their own neighbourhood.  I believe  that\r\n\r\nthe security of our neighbourhood should not just be the job  of\r\n\r\nthe  Police Officers.  I think it is also in the interest of the\r\n\r\nresidents  living in the neighbourhood to ensure that the  place\r\n\r\nis safe.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the NPP system has been redesigned. This\r\n\r\nredesign of the NPP system will see the creation of six regional\r\n\r\nheadquarters,   instead   of   the   current   seven    division\r\n\r\nheadquarters.  Together with the six regional HQs, we will  have\r\n\r\n<br><br>32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neighbourhood Police Centres (NPCs), and the  NPCs  will  be\r\n\r\nspread  island-wide  in  accordance with the  Development  Guide\r\n\r\nPlan.   Each NPC will manage between one and four NPPs and  they\r\n\r\nwill  work as an integrated unit.  With the redesign,  the  NPPs\r\n\r\nwill continue to serve as a contact point for the public and  if\r\n\r\nthey  need assistance from the Police, they can still go to  the\r\n\r\nNPPs.   If  you add up the new arrangement and compare with  the\r\n\r\ncurrent   arrangement,  you  will  find  that  indeed  the   new\r\n\r\narrangement  regional HQs, NPCs and NPPs  will have more service\r\n\r\npoints  for the public.  Under the present arrangement, we  have\r\n\r\nseven  division HQs plus 91 NPPs.  There are 98 service  points.\r\n\r\nWhereas  when we have six regional HQs, 32 NPCs and 66 NPPs,  we\r\n\r\nwill  have  104 service points.  In other words,  we  have  more\r\n\r\ncentres available for the public to access Police services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current system of the NPPs, the officers actually\r\n\r\nperform quite routine tasks.  For example, when somebody makes a\r\n\r\npolice  report,  that report will be filed and referred  to  the\r\n\r\ndivision  HQ  for investigation.  The NPP officer  does  not  do\r\n\r\ninvestigation.  As a result, it does take some time for  matters\r\n\r\nto  be  investigated.  But with the redesign, the cases will  be\r\n\r\ndealt  more quickly because the NPCs will have enough  officers,\r\n\r\nabout 110 or 120 officers, to actually do the investigation.  In\r\n\r\nother words, they need not refer the report to the HQ.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NPC patrol officers will also do the investigation and\r\n\r\nif there are serious cases, for example, serial crime, they will\r\n\r\nrefer to the CID where CID will have specialist officers to deal\r\n\r\nwith  them. So let me assure Members that the NPCs and the  NPPs\r\n\r\nwill provide adequate services for our public and they will work\r\n\r\nas an integrated and an integral whole.  It is not another layer\r\n\r\nof bureaucracy in the Police organisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The redesign will benefit the community in many ways.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the NPCs will be able to serve the crime victims better\r\n\r\nand faster.  Instead of having to be passed from one NPP officer\r\n\r\nto the investigator and the scene of crime officer, from the HQ,\r\n\r\nthe  crime  victims  will now be served by front  line  officers\r\n\r\nhandling  the entire process.  They will be able to process  the\r\n\r\ncase faster as they would have greater autonomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with the resources that the NPCs have, it will be\r\n\r\nable  to better mobilise the community to work out the solutions\r\n\r\nto  common  and  community problems.  The closer involvement  of\r\n\r\ncommunity  organisations will ensure that the  Police  resources\r\n\r\nwill be best tailored to meet the local needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the NPP system will begin with the\r\n\r\none-year pilot programme beginning in October with the first NPC\r\n\r\nbeing  set  up  in the present Queentstown Driving Test  Centre.\r\n\r\nAfter  the  pilot phase, the Police will extend this concept  to\r\n\r\nthe whole of Singapore by the year 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin is concerned about reduced police presence in\r\n\r\nthe  neighbourhood and asked whether there will  be  fewer  foot\r\n\r\npatrols.   I  think it is understandable that such concerns  are\r\n\r\nexpressed,  but  let  me  assure him that  they  are  unfounded.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the traditional roles of NPPs in providing the  counter\r\n\r\nservices,  proactive  patrolling and door-to-door  visits,  will\r\n\r\ncontinue.   Secondly, the additional task of fast  response  and\r\n\r\ninvestigation undertaken by the officers at the NPCs will not be\r\n\r\nat  the  expense of community policing.  NPC officers  would  be\r\n\r\nspecially tasked also to go on patrols or house visits during  a\r\n\r\nshift  or  part of a shift.  In fact, with the greater  autonomy\r\n\r\nthat  they  enjoy, the NPCs will be better able  to  deploy  the\r\n\r\nresources according to the crime situation and demand for police\r\n\r\nservices  in  their  area of jurisdiction.  This  will  in  fact\r\n\r\nenhance  overall  police presence and create a  safer  and  more\r\n\r\nsecure neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that Singapore is one of the safest countries\r\n\r\nin  the  world  to  live  in.  We did not  say  this  ourselves.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  feel it.  Recently, the World Economic  Forum  and\r\n\r\nthe  International  Institute  for Management  Development  rank\r\n\r\nSingapore first in the area of security.  Respondents to the two\r\n\r\nsurveys  are  confident  that persons and  properties  would  be\r\n\r\nprotected  in  Singapore.  Another survey  commissioned  by  the\r\n\r\nPolice  last year and covered 1,300 persons showed that  98%  of\r\n\r\nthe  respondents thought that security of Singapore  was  either\r\n\r\ngood,  very good or excellent, while 86% of them felt that  they\r\n\r\nare safer now than they were five years ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are measures other than the NPPs that would help to\r\n\r\nfight  crime  and  these include the formation of  Neighbourhood\r\n\r\nWatch  Zones  in  public and private housing  estates,  and  the\r\n\r\norganisation  of  crime  prevention exhibitions  and  talks  for\r\n\r\nresidents in the neighbourhood.  The local community should take\r\n\r\ngreater  responsibility  for their own safety  and  security  of\r\n\r\ntheir precincts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of the NPP system depends as much on the Police\r\n\r\nas  on  the  willingness of the grassroots leaders to  lead  the\r\n\r\nlevel  of community involvement, bonding spirit as well  as  the\r\n\r\ninvolvement  of the residents in crime prevention in  their  own\r\n\r\nneighbourhood.  Police must also find, and be open to,  new  and\r\n\r\nbetter  ways of fighting crimes.  I agree with Prof.  Chin  that\r\n\r\ntechnology is one thing we can use to help to keep a place safe.\r\n\r\nAs  reported  in yesterday's papers and also in other  articles,\r\n\r\nBritain, for example, has installed surveillance cameras to help\r\n\r\nreduce crimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand Prof. Chin's concern too that in new housing\r\n\r\nestates, the residents request for NPPs.  As part of this review\r\n\r\nand  redesign  of the NPC system, the Police will  look  at  the\r\n\r\nredeployment  of some of these NPPs.  But let me  say  that  the\r\n\r\nPolice cannot set up an NPP in every new housing estate.  It  is\r\n\r\njust  not  possible.  We only have that many people,  that  much\r\n\r\nresources and these are all we can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nspare.  We will have to maximise the use of these resources.  We\r\n\r\ncannot afford to have an NPP in every housing estate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents themselves really have to help out in this. They\r\n\r\ncan form Neighbourhood Watch Groups.  But I assure him that,  in\r\n\r\nthe  review of the redeployment, we will see how we can take out\r\n\r\nNPPs  from  some  of the older estates where the  population  is\r\n\r\ndeclining  and shift some of them to the newer housing  estates.\r\n\r\nBut again, let me caution that they should not expect one NPP in\r\n\r\nevery  new  housing estate.  I give an example.  In  Bishan,  we\r\n\r\nhave  Bishan  East  and  Bishan North and  the  current  NPP  is\r\n\r\nsituated  in  Block 196.  There is a new Bishan  North  and  the\r\n\r\nresidents also want to have an NPP.  I say that this is just not\r\n\r\npossible.   We  could  have officers from the  Bishan  East  NPP\r\n\r\npatrolling  the areas in Bishan North.  So the same will  happen\r\n\r\nto Woodlands, Sembawang, and other areas too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will leave it to my Minister of State to answer the other\r\n\r\nquestions raised by Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> First, let me take the point that Mr Jeyaretnam has\r\n\r\nraised.  Sir, I think his main point is that there is a need for\r\n\r\nan  independent  body to look into Police wrongdoing.   Like  Mr\r\n\r\nKenneth  Chen,  first,  may I question the  need  to  cite,  for\r\n\r\nexample, developments in the UK.  As we know, developments in UK\r\n\r\nare quite different, both in terms of the state of the Police as\r\n\r\nwell as the state of law and order.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we should take the situation as we find it in\r\n\r\nSingapore and look at the track record of what has happened  all\r\n\r\nthese years.  Let me assure this House that the Police Force has\r\n\r\na  strict  code  of conduct and clear guidelines and  procedures\r\n\r\nwhich  ensure  that  Police officers operate in  a  professional\r\n\r\nmanner.  These guidelines also ensure that officers do not abuse\r\n\r\nthe   trust  and  authority  placed  on  them.   Procedures  and\r\n\r\nsupervision   systems  are  also  in  place   to   ensure   that\r\n\r\ninvestigations and all contacts with suspects or members of  the\r\n\r\npublic are carried out in a reasonable and fair\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmanner.   As  the  Minister for Home Affairs  has  said,  citing\r\n\r\nsurveys,  the  Police  Force in Singapore is  well  regarded  by\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and indeed even by outsiders, ie, people  who  have\r\n\r\ncome to Singapore as tourists or even as professionals coming to\r\n\r\nstudy  our  system, and they realise that here is a system  that\r\n\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say also, Sir, that both MHA and the Police take a\r\n\r\nvery serious view of any complaint or allegation of assault or\r\n\r\nviolence made against any police officer.  If he is found to\r\n\r\nhave abused his powers in any way, this police officer faces\r\n\r\ndisciplinary action and indeed even criminal prosecution.  Sir,\r\n\r\nit has taken many years for us to have achieved the high level\r\n\r\nof public confidence in the Police Force, especially in terms of\r\n\r\nits integrity and professionalism.  MHA will never allow any\r\n\r\nblack sheep to tarnish the image and integrity of the Police.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in fact, over the past two years, before Mr Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nre-entered this Chamber, I have taken several questions on  this\r\n\r\ntopic, ie, instances of alleged police assault or brutality  and\r\n\r\neven  a  suggestion has been raised before for the need  for  an\r\n\r\nindependent   IID.   I  had  very  carefully   explained   these\r\n\r\nsituations  why Police did what it did and I also explained  why\r\n\r\nthere  was no need for an IID.  This of course includes  Mohamad\r\n\r\nAli's case that Mr Jeyaretnam talked about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like I said, there are checks and safeguards to\r\n\r\ninvestigate   any  complaint  or  allegation.   Therefore,   the\r\n\r\nbottomline  is, and I have said this before, inside  this  House\r\n\r\nand  outside,  there  will be no cover-up for  errant  officers.\r\n\r\nErrant  officers  who  are  found to  be  errant  after  careful\r\n\r\ninvestigations will be appropriately dealt with.  Investigations\r\n\r\nby  the  IID will be impartial, fair and thorough.  And  indeed,\r\n\r\nthe  IID was previously called the IIS, and Mr Jeyaretnam  still\r\n\r\nuses  the  old  term of Internal Investigation Section.   Before\r\n\r\n1995, it was a section but Police beefed it up.   Police saw the\r\n\r\nneed  to  beef it up both in terms of improving its workings  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  assuring  the  public  that  Police  takes  all  these\r\n\r\ncomplaints seriously.  Therefore, now it has become a separate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndivision  which  comes under the Inspectorate Department  rather\r\n\r\nthan the Manpower Department in the past, signaling therefore to\r\n\r\nthe police officers themselves as well as to the public at large\r\n\r\nthat Police takes this business of ensuring the integrity of its\r\n\r\nmembers very seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should IID be an independent commission? As I have said\r\n\r\nbefore  in this House, there is no need for such a step.   After\r\n\r\nall, will lay people fully understand the workings of the Police\r\n\r\nForce  in  terms of its investigation techniques or in terms  of\r\n\r\nits  alleged  wrongdoings?  Would it not  be  better,  like  the\r\n\r\npresent situation, for very seasoned investigators who have done\r\n\r\nthe  work  on the ground to understand how the system works  and\r\n\r\nhow  it  should  not work?  And these are the officers  who  are\r\n\r\nposted  to  the IID, experienced officers who will be  impartial\r\n\r\nand fair in the investigation of cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also said this before. Ultimately, what is\r\n\r\nimportant  in the uniformed force is that the commander-in-chief\r\n\r\nmust  take  command of his men and all its operations  and  that\r\n\r\nincludes discipline and allegations of wrongdoing.  Therefore, I\r\n\r\nthink  it is important to put the right man in the right  place.\r\n\r\nHere, he is the Commissioner of Police.  And if indeed he is the\r\n\r\nright  man for the job, then I say let him do the work.  And  if\r\n\r\nyou  do not trust him to do a good work, either in terms of  his\r\n\r\nintegrity  or  competence, then we should change him.   I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  an important point, Sir.  In other words,  we  have  a\r\n\r\nsystem  in place where the right men are carefully selected  for\r\n\r\nthe  right  jobs  and especially in the Police  Force  where  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  rightly points out there is much  contact  with  the\r\n\r\npublic.  The Police Commissioner, working a system where honesty\r\n\r\nand  integrity are the hallmarks, must ensure that there  is  no\r\n\r\ncover-up.  In fact, he will be the first person to want to  weed\r\n\r\nout any errant officer because he would want his organisation to\r\n\r\nbe  tip-top  so  that  any allegation by the  public  of  police\r\n\r\nwrongdoing,  he  in fact has a vested interest  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\ninvestigations are transparent and fair.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the bottomline therefore is that the system we have\r\n\r\nworks.   It  is  shown by the fact that Singaporeans  trust  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force.   It  is  shown by the fact  that  errant  police\r\n\r\nofficers  have in fact been punished in many ways, some  through\r\n\r\ndisciplinary action, others were prosecuted in court openly.   I\r\n\r\nthink  there is no cover-up.  And also by the fact that for  the\r\n\r\nmost  serious  cases,  the Attorney-General's  inputs  are  also\r\n\r\nsought  in  cases where IID says, \"no further action  required\".\r\n\r\nAG  will  come  in  and see whether that should  indeed  be  the\r\n\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, I take this opportunity to once again,\r\n\r\nwhich  I have done in the past, reassure this House that  Police\r\n\r\ntakes  this business of reports by the public of errant officers\r\n\r\nvery  seriously.  We have a system in place that works.  We have\r\n\r\nworked  this  system.  We put the right man in  the  right  job,\r\n\r\nright  down  to  the  Police  Commissioner.   And  I  think  the\r\n\r\nindicators  will  be  looked  at all  the  time  whether  public\r\n\r\nconfidence remains high, whether world polls rate us highly  and\r\n\r\nindeed  even  in the face of foreign criticisms, as happened  in\r\n\r\nthe  Michael  Fay's case when the West criticised  our  criminal\r\n\r\njustice  system,  including  the  Police  Force.   We  had,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  a visiting professor, a former Police Chief, who  came\r\n\r\nto Singapore and looked at our system for a week and at the end,\r\n\r\nconcluded  thus,  and  this is a letter he  wrote  to  President\r\n\r\nClinton, \"After a long dose of police reality here and  the  US,\r\n\r\nand after visiting numerous police agencies in Latin America and\r\n\r\nEurope,  I would rather be investigated by the Singapore  Police\r\n\r\nForce (SPF) than any other agency.\"\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me sum up. The SPF guards its reputation jealously.\r\n\r\nIt  will  not  allow  a  few bad hats to  ruin  its  name.   Any\r\n\r\ncomplaint   on  police  wrongdoing  will  be  taken   seriously.\r\n\r\nInvestigations will be carried out fairly and impartially.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I ask by way of clarification from\r\n\r\nthe Minister of State?   I am, however, indebted to him for the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlong explanation he has given.  I appreciate that.  The Minister\r\n\r\nof  State  says there are guidelines.  May I ask him, are  there\r\n\r\nguidelines  indeed  about  how  the  Police  should  interrogate\r\n\r\naccused  persons?  Because when police officers are  questioned,\r\n\r\nthey  say  there is no guideline, not even as to the  length  of\r\n\r\ntime  that  they  can  continue  with  their  interrogation   of\r\n\r\nsuspects.  So the answer we get is that there are no guidelines.\r\n\r\nIt  is left to them.  I would like to know from the Minister  of\r\n\r\nState what guidelines is he talking about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may ask my second question, would the Ministry\r\n\r\nconsider  issuing, or at least making available, to the  persons\r\n\r\nwho complain a full report of the investigations carried out  by\r\n\r\nthe  Internal Investigation Section, so that the aggrieved party\r\n\r\nmay  feel that his complaint has been properly looked into,  and\r\n\r\nthat nothing has been overlooked?  The Minister says there is no\r\n\r\ncover-up.   But in the end, the bottom line is - I  am  sure  he\r\n\r\nwill  appreciate  - the person who has made the  complaint  must\r\n\r\nfeel that there has been no cover-up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, on his first point - I think\r\n\r\nthis point was also covered by Prof. Chin -  any allegations  of\r\n\r\npolice  assault during the investigation is subject to  scrutiny\r\n\r\nby  the courts.  Police takes very seriously instances when  the\r\n\r\ncourts say that in this case there was police wrongdoing so that\r\n\r\nthe  statements  are  not admissible.  They  will  look  at  the\r\n\r\njudgments.  They will look at what the courts have said what not\r\n\r\nto  be done.  In this sense, over the years, police will take  a\r\n\r\nreading  from what is admissible in law and they are  guided  by\r\n\r\nwhat is admissible in law and admissible by the courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is an important point because we always talk\r\n\r\nabout possible police wrongdoing and investigations.   But  this\r\n\r\nis  the  ultimate  barometer and test.  Any police  officer  who\r\n\r\nconducts  an  investigation  will know  that   if  a  confession\r\n\r\nstatement is extracted, there is a possibility that it could  be\r\n\r\nchallenged  in  court.  And when he comes to court,  he  has  to\r\n\r\nexplain,  he  has to produce his diary, he has to  convince  the\r\n\r\ncourt that there was no wrongdoing.  Over the years, certainly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin terms of what ought to be done and what ought not to be done,\r\n\r\npolice knows the limits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that Mr Jeyaretnam mentions is: should we\r\n\r\nfurnish  the full report to the complainant?  Should the schools\r\n\r\nfurnish the fully marked paper to the students?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That is different.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I am drawing an analogy.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  the complainant may not fully understand,  as  I  said\r\n\r\njust  know,  what  has  transpired  in  terms  of  investigative\r\n\r\ntechniques, in terms of the professional matters that pertain to\r\n\r\nthe  workings  of  any  police  force.   And  in  his  lack   of\r\n\r\nunderstanding, he may not fully appreciate the fact that  indeed\r\n\r\nmuch  careful work has been done.  I think Mr Jeyaretnam,  as  a\r\n\r\nlawyer,  probably  also suffers from this sometimes.   When  you\r\n\r\nfeel  that you have done all your best for your client, you have\r\n\r\nput  in your best work, you have done this, you have done  that,\r\n\r\nand  when you furnish the accounts your client says, \"What  work\r\n\r\nhave you done?\"  And in spite of the fact that you furnished him\r\n\r\na  whole  list  of what you have done, he or she will  still  be\r\n\r\nunhappy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, like I said, ultimately, it must be the question\r\n\r\nwhether the system works.  And I think Mr Jeyaretnam must  agree\r\n\r\nthat the system works.  It is his prerogative not to agree,  but\r\n\r\nlike  I have said, if a large percentage of Singaporeans say  so\r\n\r\nand  if  Singaporeans feel very safe on the road,  if  outsiders\r\n\r\npraise  us  for our system, then it cannot be that it does  not.\r\n\r\nSo  the  IID,  and  not the IIS which he spoke  about,  must  be\r\n\r\nallowed to do its job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first thank all the Members for speaking on\r\n\r\nthis  very  relevant topic of juvenile delinquency. I  have  the\r\n\r\nfigures.  The good news is that the number of juveniles arrested\r\n\r\nfor  crime has, in fact, fallen from 2,574 in 1995 to 2,101 last\r\n\r\nyear.   The  overall number of arrests has, in fact, come  down.\r\n\r\nAnd  close  to 70% of the arrests last year were for  theft  and\r\n\r\nrelated crimes, not very serious crimes.  Of course,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  bad  news  all of us know is that fightings have  gone  up,\r\n\r\ninstances when teens and young people are involved in fighting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok, GPC Chairman, and Mr Choo urged the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  take a comprehensive approach  towards  juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency.  This is, in fact, a good suggestion  and  this  is\r\n\r\nthe  approach the Government has taken.  Last year, I  told  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that the Government would take an inter-Ministry approach\r\n\r\ntowards  tackling  juvenile delinquency.   This  is  because  we\r\n\r\nrealise  that juvenile delinquency is not just about crimes, but\r\n\r\na  host  of  complex  issues such as effective  parenting,  peer\r\n\r\ninfluence, media influence, use of free time and whatever  else.\r\n\r\nThis Inter-Ministry Committee on Juvenile Delinquency (IMJD) was\r\n\r\nformed in April 1996, which I chair, and members are drawn  from\r\n\r\nmany  sectors  -  MHA, MCD, MOE, AG's Chambers, Juvenile  Court,\r\n\r\nNational  Youth  Council, National Council of  Social  Services,\r\n\r\nsocial work professionals and MPs are also on board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is good if I spend a few minutes to outline what\r\n\r\nthe  Committee has done.  Otherwise people may think that we are\r\n\r\ntaking    short-term   solutions  to  the  measures   that   are\r\n\r\nintroduced.  This is not the case.  The latest host of measures,\r\n\r\nin fact, come as a package after a long series of other measures\r\n\r\nthat  have  been put in place.  The IMJD adopted a comprehensive\r\n\r\nthree-pronged    approach   -   prevention,   enforcement    and\r\n\r\nrehabilitation.   This  philosophy is, first  and  foremost,  to\r\n\r\nprevent  youths  from drifting into delinquency.   Next,  strict\r\n\r\nenforcement  action  against those  who  create  law  and  order\r\n\r\nproblems  and,  finally, to provide rehabilitation opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  those who are amenable to change.  And we have  coordinated\r\n\r\nthe  introduction  of many programmes in the past  year;  court-driven  ones such as boot camp and family conferencing;  school-based  ones  such  as  expansion of  pastoral  care  and  career\r\n\r\nguidance programmes, and peer support schemes.  And also pulling\r\n\r\nin VWOs, VP mentoring schemes and also enhancing greater network\r\n\r\namongst all parties -\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nschools, police, MOE, approved homes, through seminars,  guides,\r\n\r\nand networking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list can go on, but I think the first point I want to\r\n\r\nmake  is  that we have taken this approach of making  sure  that\r\n\r\neverybody pulls together.  And this is partly why the number  of\r\n\r\njuveniles  arrested has come down.  But in view of  this  recent\r\n\r\nphenomenon of teen fighting, I have asked the IMJD now to  focus\r\n\r\nin  this area.  And whilst they focus in this area, it will  not\r\n\r\nbe  at  the  expense  of  all the other measures  that  we  have\r\n\r\nintroduced.  All the other measures are still in place.  We will\r\n\r\ncontinue to monitor them and fine-tune them, if necessary.   But\r\n\r\nnow  the  targeted approach is how to cut down on teen fighting.\r\n\r\nAs  Members have mentioned, many initiatives have been launched,\r\n\r\nwhether  it is in prevention, the ordinary VSC scheme or  better\r\n\r\nliaison  or  indeed some of the police programmes  that  we  are\r\n\r\nintroducing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to speak a bit about teen gangs. I think this\r\n\r\nis the other area that has captured Singaporeans' attention over\r\n\r\nthe  past 2-3 weeks, particularly since the announcement of  the\r\n\r\nunder-16 ban.  Let me first say that I want to thank all Members\r\n\r\nwho  have  spoken up here in support of the ban on 16-year  olds\r\n\r\ngoing  to  tea  dances and other outlets where there  is  public\r\n\r\nentertainment and dancing.  Let me assure all Members that we do\r\n\r\nnot  take  this  measure in an unthinking fashion  or  desperate\r\n\r\nfashion.   In fact, it is an extension of what has already  been\r\n\r\ndone  with  regard to billiard saloons.  On the same basis,  the\r\n\r\npolice  identified  billiard  saloons  as  places  where   gangs\r\n\r\ndominate.   They  go  there,  they  influence  others  who   are\r\n\r\nunwitting,  who  are  innocent,  and  then  they  recruit  these\r\n\r\nmembers.   It is the same with tea dances and other such  places\r\n\r\nwhere  teens  may gather, which is a closed setting.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  they go there unwittingly because they are young.   That\r\n\r\nis  why  Mr Choo asked this point.  Why 16?  Because the  police\r\n\r\nassessment is that 13-15 is a very vulnerable age group, Sec. 1,\r\n\r\nSec. 2, Sec. 3.  Those of us with teens\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  know  that.   They  are  very  impressionable.   They  are\r\n\r\nsuddenly exposed into the secondary school setting.  So  we  are\r\n\r\ntargetting this group.  These people come along unwittingly  and\r\n\r\nthen they are influenced by gangs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chen says they can be recruited anywhere. That is true.\r\n\r\nWe  can ban them from going to void decks and other places.  But\r\n\r\nsince tea dance as a setting is identified with the purveying of\r\n\r\nnegative influences, I think we must act.  The question  is,  as\r\n\r\nMr  Choo and Mr Peh have asked, whether we want to extend it  to\r\n\r\nunder-18  or to more places.  My response will be, let  us  wait\r\n\r\nand see.  I think we want to be incremental.  Our approach is to\r\n\r\nbe  incremental, to see the efficacy of the programme before  we\r\n\r\neven consider whether we should extend it.  And the same goes to\r\n\r\nthe other suggestions like night curfew and other places.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Choo has made this point about street wise programme,\r\n\r\nwhether  the  curfew should be voluntary.  We  have  taken  this\r\n\r\napproach  because these youths who are given the opportunity  to\r\n\r\ncome  on  board for this curfew programme are already a targeted\r\n\r\ngroup.   They are youths who are already found by police  to  be\r\n\r\nassociating   with   secret  society  types.    Therefore,   the\r\n\r\nalternative  to them coming on board in this programme  will  be\r\n\r\nthat  they  are registered under the Registrar of  Societies  as\r\n\r\nbeing  members of teen gangs.  So we feel that to motivate them,\r\n\r\nit is better to say, \"We give you an option.\"  Most will come on\r\n\r\nboard  because here is a programme which helps them and  parents\r\n\r\nare  involved.   And   because it is  packaged  as  a  voluntary\r\n\r\nprogramme, they will be more motivated and the success rate will\r\n\r\nbe higher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think time is running on. We still have many topics\r\n\r\nto  go.   I just want to say that all the suggestions that  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made in this House will be considered, including Mr  David\r\n\r\nLim's.    He  actually  questioned  whether  the  ban  will   be\r\n\r\neffective,  quoting a youngster.  He said that  they  can  dance\r\n\r\nanywhere.   Indeed, they can dance anywhere.  I would  encourage\r\n\r\nit.   In  fact, I have asked Mr David Lim to organise tea dances\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndiscos in his community centres.  Because there is nothing wrong\r\n\r\nin  dancing and, in fact, in these settings, the youngsters will\r\n\r\ncome  and vent their excess energies.  But what is important  is\r\n\r\nthat  I do not think the secret society types will want to  come\r\n\r\nto  our  CCs.  So that is the approach we have taken.   We  know\r\n\r\nthat this is not the solution, but I hope that this latest spate\r\n\r\nof measures will encourage everybody in Singapore, first of all,\r\n\r\nto  say  yes,  this  is the situation that we need  to  address;\r\n\r\nsecondly,  everybody  can  play a  role  where  they  are;  and,\r\n\r\nthirdly,   specifically, how to organise activities  which  will\r\n\r\nattract our youths.  I think this is the key challenge,  how  to\r\n\r\norganise  activities that will attract the whole  range  of  our\r\n\r\nyouths,  not  just  those who believe in these  activities,  but\r\n\r\nthose  who may be averse to being organised.  I think there  are\r\n\r\nstill ways where we can creatively help them feel that they  can\r\n\r\nbelong  to  a gang, but do not belong to a gang that fights  and\r\n\r\ndoes wrong things but belong to a gang that will do good things.\r\n\r\nYoung  people  like  to belong to gangs.    They  can  be  in  a\r\n\r\nfootball  gang or whatever gang.  But let us have more gangs  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  where  there is voluntarism.  Several  speakers  have\r\n\r\nspoken  about the need for more voluntarism and let  this  be  a\r\n\r\ncall  to  all Singaporeans that if they want to find a cause  to\r\n\r\nchampion, champion the cause of our youths in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David T. E. Lim (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, may I be allowed\r\n\r\na  point  of  clarification.  First of all,  let  me  thank  the\r\n\r\nMinister of State for his very thoughtful answer and I certainly\r\n\r\nagree  with  him that we should try to promote good gangs.   The\r\n\r\nquestion  I  have for the Minister of State is  whether  we  are\r\n\r\ndealing by imposing a ban with the symptom of a problem or  with\r\n\r\nthe  root of the problem.  If I may illustrate this.  A man buys\r\n\r\na  pair  of  shoes two sizes smaller than what he needs  and  he\r\n\r\nfinds very quickly that his feet hurt a lot.  He can go and  see\r\n\r\na doctor.  He can put ointment on the feet.  He can soak them in\r\n\r\nthe hot tub every night.  But the problem will not go away.  His\r\n\r\nfeet will continue to hurt.  And his alternative, if\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnothing  else works, is to stop walking.  But that  is  not  the\r\n\r\nsolution.  The solution is that he needs a bigger pair of shoes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point that I was making in my speech the day before was\r\n\r\nthat  what we need to do is to deal with the root cause  of  why\r\n\r\nthere are more street fights and street gangs.  Teenagers are at\r\n\r\nan  age where they are impressionable.  They are at an age where\r\n\r\nthey  need  a  lot of love and guidance and understanding.   The\r\n\r\npoint is that the manifestation of these street gangs means that\r\n\r\nthere is something that has gone awry and askew in the homes and\r\n\r\nin  the  family.  That perhaps is where we ought  to  focus  the\r\n\r\nattention.   But, in the meantime, to introduce bans  and  curbs\r\n\r\ndoes not solve the problem because beyond the tea dances, and if\r\n\r\nthey were to congregate now in the neighbourhood coffeeshops  or\r\n\r\nin  hotel lobbies, will we ban them also from those places?   So\r\n\r\nthe  fundamental issue is, where will it stop?   How  much  more\r\n\r\nointment  and, worse still, we are now going to put ointment  on\r\n\r\n18-year olds as well.  Does that solve the problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I think Mr Lim's analogy\r\n\r\nis  very  interesting.  However, gangsterism and shoes  are  two\r\n\r\ndifferent  things.  While you can change your shoes if  they  do\r\n\r\nnot  fit you, when children turn bad, you cannot change  to  new\r\n\r\nchildren.  That is a different issue.  Although the new measures\r\n\r\nmay  not  go to the root of the matter, they are, to  a  certain\r\n\r\ndegree   quite   effective   in  the  prevention   of   juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquents.  So I think Mr Lim should allow our police and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Home Affairs to try out these measures and  see  how\r\n\r\neffective  they are.  As suggested by Mr Peh, let them  try  out\r\n\r\nfor  six  months and see how these fare.  I think that  is  more\r\n\r\nreasonable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that I read from the newspapers that\r\n\r\nmany  young  people  are spotting tattoos  on  their  body.   On\r\n\r\ntattoos,  what  kind of attitude should we  adopt?   How  do  we\r\n\r\ncontrol  tattoos?  Do we need to legislate?  If  those  children\r\n\r\nwith tattoos regret later and want to remove them, what can they\r\n\r\ndo?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Maybe bring  them  to\r\n\r\nthe  Skin Centre to remove the tattoo or do something else.   Or\r\n\r\nshould we go through legislation to control tattoos?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to inform hon. Members that we\r\n\r\nare running behind schedule on this amendment.  Mr Chng.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I just cannot help but make a short\r\n\r\ncomment  in reply to Mr David Lim.  That is the purpose  of  the\r\n\r\nlaw   in   a   country.   Just  because  certain   people   have\r\n\r\npsychological problems, for example, prone to stealing, it  does\r\n\r\nnot mean that we should not have laws against theft.  At the end\r\n\r\nof  the day, we have to find deterrents to certain problems.  If\r\n\r\na  person  breaches a certain law, that person must be punished.\r\n\r\nWhen I support the curfew on teenagers and the ban on under-16s,\r\n\r\nit  is  precisely for that purpose.  We try to limit  the  areas\r\n\r\nwhich  they  can go wrong.  We do not want them to step  out  of\r\n\r\nbounds and become criminals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I move to my next amendment, unless the Minister\r\n\r\nof State wants to reply?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You can carry on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> On staged accidents, this question was\r\n\r\nraised by me in an Oral Question and the Minister of State a few\r\n\r\ndays  ago had given a measured reply indicating that police  has\r\n\r\ninvestigated such complaints.  The short answer is that there is\r\n\r\nreally  very little the police can do.  The legislation  is  not\r\n\r\nadequate at the moment.  At best, the victims and their families\r\n\r\nhave their lives threatened or endangered on the road.  This  is\r\n\r\nvery  cold  comfort.  Worse, they would then be fleeced  by  the\r\n\r\nworkshop operators who actually charge them exorbitant rates for\r\n\r\nthe service.  What the answer has conveyed is that since the law\r\n\r\nis  inadequate  and the police is not able to do very  much,  it\r\n\r\nsends a very bad signal to those\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nperpetrators  and culprits.  It will simply tell them  that  the\r\n\r\npolice have been trying to do a lot but actually they cannot  do\r\n\r\nvery much.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a follow up to my Oral Question, I would like the\r\n\r\nMinister  to consider this as a serious issue.  We do  not  need\r\n\r\nsomeone  to  be killed on the road before we take tough  action.\r\n\r\nIf  the law on touting is not sufficient to arrest this problem,\r\n\r\nand as one of my Parliamentary colleagues has just suggested  to\r\n\r\nme,  maybe we should charge that person for attempted murder  if\r\n\r\nthere is evidence because he endangers life on the road and that\r\n\r\nis a very serious problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, recently there was a\r\n\r\nspate  of fatal traffic accidents occurring in Singapore and  we\r\n\r\nare  all  very  concerned about it.  Because these serious  road\r\n\r\naccidents  normally  involve buses,  heavy  vehicles  and  motor\r\n\r\ncycles, I would like to ask the Minister what the traffic police\r\n\r\nproposes  to  do to ensure that there is greater safety  on  our\r\n\r\nroads. I have four recommendations for the Minister to consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we must restrict motor cycles, heavy vehicles and\r\n\r\nbuses.   A  speed limit should be imposed and enforced strictly.\r\n\r\nThere  should be a special device on their vehicles to  indicate\r\n\r\ntheir  travelling  speed.   Secondly, require  buses  and  heavy\r\n\r\nvehicles  to  turn  on the head lights at all  times.   Thirdly,\r\n\r\nappoint  voluntary  traffic  wardens  to  help  enhance   safety\r\n\r\nawareness and road safety.  Fourthly, require motor cyclists  to\r\n\r\ngo  on  the  slow  lane and ban them from  the  fast  lane  when\r\n\r\ntravelling along the expressways.  These measures would  perhaps\r\n\r\nhelp to ensure road safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, nowadays child\r\n\r\nabduction  cases  are  happening very frequently  in  developing\r\n\r\ncountries.   There was a report carried in the  Shin  Min  Daily\r\n\r\nNews  on  2nd  April  1997 about missing children  in  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nAlthough this report mentioned about Malaysia, it also mentioned\r\n\r\nabout a neighbouring country, and Singapore is the country which\r\n\r\nis  nearest  to Malaysia.  According to this report, the  public\r\n\r\naffairs\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndepartment  of the Bukit Ampang Police Headquarters in  Malaysia\r\n\r\nmade a shocking revelation that in Malaysia there was an average\r\n\r\nof  12  children  reported  missing  every  day.   According  to\r\n\r\nstatistics, in 1993 there were 4,443 children missing.  In 1994,\r\n\r\nthere were 3,955. In 1995, there were 3,786 and in the first ten\r\n\r\nmonths of 1996 there were 3,621 children reported missing.  Most\r\n\r\nof  these  missing  children were girls and  children  from  the\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries.  The most infuriating part is that  some\r\n\r\nof  these  children were adopted by the criminal syndicates  who\r\n\r\ndisfigured  them so that they would not be recognised  by  their\r\n\r\nparents  and  they amputated part of their limbs  to  make  them\r\n\r\nbeggars to  beg for money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among these serious cases of child abduction in Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthe  most seriously affected state is Johor.  According  to  the\r\n\r\npolice statistics, among the 400 missing children found,  30  of\r\n\r\nthem are from neighbouring countries. Of these 30 children, I am\r\n\r\nnot  aware  how many are from Singapore as it was not specified.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  feel that we should look into this  problem  very\r\n\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember there were two children from Singapore who were\r\n\r\nreported missing since six to seven years and they could not  be\r\n\r\ntraced.    I have a few suggestions to make with regard to  this\r\n\r\nmatter.  First, we should have more stringent laws against child\r\n\r\nabduction.   Punishments should be the same  as  for  kidnapping\r\n\r\ncases,  ie, they could be sentenced to death or to be imprisoned\r\n\r\nfor  life.   Secondly, when there is a report of missing  child,\r\n\r\nthe  police should immediately alert the immigration checkpoints\r\n\r\nso  that  these  children would not be taken out of   Singapore.\r\n\r\nThirdly,  for children below the age of 12, I suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nphotograph  in  the passport should be changed every  two  years\r\n\r\nbecause the physical appearance of children varies all the time.\r\n\r\nFourthly,  we should have some self-protection lessons conducted\r\n\r\nin  kindergartens and primary schools so that our young children\r\n\r\nknow how to protect themselves from possible abductors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, can I ask you to make your\r\n\r\npoints briefly, as we are running short of time?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, Sir, you have said that we are running\r\n\r\nshort of time and I will try and be very brief.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Thank you.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am again in pursuit of people's power and\r\n\r\npeople's  rights.

If the HDB and  URA  can\r\n\r\nhave  car park wardens just to issue summonses, I do not  see  a\r\n\r\nneed for skilled, well-trained Police officers doing such a job.\r\n\r\nOn a broader basis, in the Ministry of Home Affairs itself there\r\n\r\nare other such services, and in some countries, even the prisons\r\n\r\nservice  has been privatised, MHA also runs the Driving  Testing\r\n\r\nCentre and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge that, in view of the labour shortage which the\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  facing, we like to see more Police  on  the  road,\r\n\r\nkeeping  it  safe for Singaporeans, that it tries  its  best  to\r\n\r\nprivatise as much of these non-essential services as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, let me first reply to Mr\r\n\r\nChng.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, I gave a full reply in the House to Mr Chng\r\n\r\nthat  day  saying that more can be done.  It is not a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere  we  throw up our hands and say nothing can  be  done  and\r\n\r\ntherefore the perpetrators can carry on what they are doing.  We\r\n\r\nsaid  that  there is difficulty in getting evidence but  how  to\r\n\r\ntackle  the problem, what is the root of the problem, work  with\r\n\r\nthe motor insurance industry,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  work  with the workshops.  And indeed this is what  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice  is  doing - talking to the motor insurance industry,  in\r\n\r\nparticular  to see, for example, whether we can set  up  centres\r\n\r\nwhere  accident vehicles can go for verification, so that  there\r\n\r\nis no question later on as to whether or not a particular damage\r\n\r\nwas  due  to  the  accident and also  setting  up  a  system  of\r\n\r\nauthorised workshops so that those who really send in fraudulent\r\n\r\nclaims, or conduct staged accidents, can be blacklisted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the point I want to make. Let us not throw up in\r\n\r\ndespair.   We are doing what we can.  But certainly if  we  find\r\n\r\nproof  of  a  staged  accident, like I said in  the  House,  the\r\n\r\npenalties can be very severe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On road safety, Mr Choo Wee Khiang has highlighted the fact\r\n\r\nthat there have been several accidents on our roads recently and\r\n\r\nthe  need for us to continue to be very diligent in our efforts,\r\n\r\nboth  in  terms  of  Traffic Police and more  so,  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  to  take care on the roads,  whether  you  are  a\r\n\r\nmotorist, a cyclist or a pedestrian.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just, because of time, highlight some of the recent\r\n\r\nimprovements   made  by  Police.   For  example,  Police,   will\r\n\r\nintensify public education efforts on road safety.  In addition,\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police  and LTA are reviewing road safety  measures  in\r\n\r\naccident-prone areas.  Possible measures include  improving  the\r\n\r\nlighting conditions of the road, adjusting the timing of traffic\r\n\r\nlights,  because some of these accidents took place near traffic\r\n\r\njunctions,  and relocating pedestrian crossings.  So  these  are\r\n\r\nthe  focused  moves that Traffic Police will do  in  conjunction\r\n\r\nwith LTA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made a few suggestions: why not install sounders for\r\n\r\nmotorcycles?   I think it is quite difficult to monitor.   There\r\n\r\nare so many motorcycles on the road, unlike the vans where there\r\n\r\nare  these  beepers with a light.  I think that  is  very  clear\r\n\r\nbecause the light is on top of the vehicle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion that he mentioned was for buses to light\r\n\r\nup.   I think that can be considered.  I will ask Traffic Police\r\n\r\nto  look  at it to see whether making buses light up  will  help\r\n\r\nroad safety.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His third suggestion was how to encourage more volunteers\r\n\r\nto help man road safety.  We have got very good VSC officers who\r\n\r\nare  Traffic  Police officers.  Also there  is  a  scheme  where\r\n\r\nTraffic Police, together with AA, have got people who are on the\r\n\r\nroads looking out for good drivers. So we want to encourage good\r\n\r\nbehaviour, besides penalising bad ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On abducted children, Mr Peh has made a string of\r\n\r\nsuggestions.   First,  whether  we  should  treat  abduction  of\r\n\r\nchildren  as  kidnapping  to  deter  potential  abductors.    In\r\n\r\npractice,  whether a case is considered kidnapping or  abduction\r\n\r\nhinges on whether ransom is demanded.  If ransom is demanded, it\r\n\r\nwill  be considered kidnapping.  So it is up to AG to frame  the\r\n\r\nappropriate charge, depending on whether ransom is demanded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, he suggests that Police immediately alert the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Department  on receiving information  on  kidnapped\r\n\r\nchildren.  I would like to inform him that this is already being\r\n\r\ndone.   Once  it  is confirmed that a child has been  kidnapped,\r\n\r\nPolice officers handling the case will immediately telephone the\r\n\r\nImmigration Duty Officer at the various checkpoints  to  prevent\r\n\r\nthe child from being spirited out of the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, he says, why not require a change of photographs\r\n\r\nfor  children in their passports every two years.   I  think  we\r\n\r\nleave  it  to  the parents.  Because after all it is  for  their\r\n\r\nconvenience  that  they  do it themselves diligently,  otherwise\r\n\r\nthey  may  have  difficulties  getting  in  and  out  either  in\r\n\r\nSingapore or at other countries.  To make it mandatory, I think,\r\n\r\nwill  inconvenience too many people.  Right now they can  easily\r\n\r\ndo  it  by  bringing  a  photograph  and  the  passport  to  the\r\n\r\nImmigration Department.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he talks about conducting programmes in\r\n\r\nkindergartens  and primary schools to teach our  young  children\r\n\r\nhow to protect themselves against potential abductors.  This  is\r\n\r\nnot  really MHA's matter but something is being done along those\r\n\r\nlines.   Police have published some books, Mr Policeman  Series,\r\n\r\nConstable Ah Chai column and Young Generation magazine.859\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also crime prevention proficiency badges and regular\r\n\r\ntalks and visits by Police.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam takes the same tack, asking for some lay\r\n\r\npeople,  outside people, to be involved to hear complaints.   As\r\n\r\nhe  himself has said, visiting Justices of the Peace  visit  our\r\n\r\ninstitutions at least once a month, and these are all  respected\r\n\r\nmembers of the community.  They come sometimes unannounced,  and\r\n\r\nthey  go anywhere they want.  There is free access.  Very often,\r\n\r\nthey  will  take complaints and they will inspect the conditions\r\n\r\nof  the  prisons  and look into the welfare  of  the  prisoners.\r\n\r\nThose  are the two areas.  And whatever complaint is registered.\r\n\r\nIt  is  sent to the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is already a system of lay involvement. I\r\n\r\ndo not think there is a need for more.  It ultimately depends on\r\n\r\nthe people who run the system and the system itself.  Similar to\r\n\r\nthe  answer I gave earlier, the system works - appoint the right\r\n\r\nperson  to  the right job.  The Director of Prisons oversees  17\r\n\r\ninstitutions.   The Superintendent runs his own institution  and\r\n\r\nhe  is  statute-bound to make sure that it is well  run.   So  I\r\n\r\nthink there is no need to institute such a separate body.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Just to supplement what my Minister of\r\n\r\nState  has said in reply to Mr Jeyaretnam.  He does not seem  to\r\n\r\nbe interested in the answers we want to give him.  After raising\r\n\r\nthe  question, he disappears.  That means either  he  raises  it\r\n\r\nperfunctorily, or he does not believe in what he is  asking,  or\r\n\r\nhe is simply not interested in the answer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is an independent group of people who visit the\r\n\r\nprisons,  whether  it  is  an independent  election  commission,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  an independent Police investigation  unit,  the\r\n\r\nquestion does not lie in an independent commission or board,  or\r\n\r\nwhatever it is.  The question lies in whether the people who run\r\n\r\nthe system are honest and have integrity.  I think Singapore has\r\n\r\na  good  reputation,  and  that  reputation  must  be  jealously\r\n\r\nguarded,  and  that  reputation is that we  have  an  efficient,\r\n\r\nhonest and transparent system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNobody can get away with murder.  If Mr Jeyaretnam has any  case\r\n\r\nthat  he thinks that we ought to investigate, I think he  should\r\n\r\nsurface it.  Raise it, and we will look into it, but do not cast\r\n\r\na  smear  on  our system.  That would do Singapore an injustice.\r\n\r\nThat  would  do  all  Singaporeans  an  injustice,  because  our\r\n\r\ninvestors  will  then  say,  \"What  sort  of  place  is  this?\".\r\n\r\nFortunately,  investors  do not have that  kind  of  impression.\r\n\r\nThey  come, they see, they know what is going on and they always\r\n\r\ngive  Singapore high marks for the system that we have.  So stop\r\n\r\ntalking  nonsense - that is my advice to him.  Be  today's  man!\r\n\r\nBe  relevant, not be like an old gramophone record, playing  the\r\n\r\nsame  old  tune with a hole in the groove, which keeps repeating\r\n\r\nitself.   Be the compact disc!  Be a digital audio tape  player!\r\n\r\nThis is a new technology.  So be relevant!  I urge him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the two questions of drug enforcement raised by Mr\r\n\r\nKenneth  Chen,  let  me assure him that we  will  do  everything\r\n\r\npossible to try to keep the drug situation under control, which,\r\n\r\nin fact, it is.  Over the last two years since the comprehensive\r\n\r\nmeasures  that  we  have  undertaken,  the  drug  situation  has\r\n\r\nimproved  somewhat.  But we know that there are  certain  people\r\n\r\nwho  cannot get away from drugs.  They will go into DRC time and\r\n\r\nagain, despite the help, rehabilitation and the counselling that\r\n\r\nwe  have given them.  So for these people, we have decided  that\r\n\r\nthey will be in for a long haul.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time we amend the law, we are going to make it\r\n\r\nmandatory,  caning plus jail sentence, and not in a DRC.   DRC's\r\n\r\nlife  is  too  good for them.  It is like home-coming,  back  to\r\n\r\nmeeting their own community.  They will be in prison if they are\r\n\r\ncaught the third time for an opiate drug offence.  Five to seven\r\n\r\nyears,  three to six strokes of the cane, or seven to 13  years,\r\n\r\nsix  to 12 strokes of the cane if they re-offend, ie, after they\r\n\r\nhad  been  charged  the  first time for  committing  a  hardcore\r\n\r\noffence and re-offend after serving the sentence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the drug situation has improved a bit, we are\r\n\r\nconcerned about\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe increase in the number of Ecstasy abuses.  You have seen the\r\n\r\nCNB  has gone all out to deal with this problem.  We have  urged\r\n\r\nmanagements of nightclub operations, lounges, etc, to be careful\r\n\r\n-  do not allow the clients to rave around after taking Ecstasy;\r\n\r\ndo  not  sell them plain water.  They know there is  a  problem,\r\n\r\nthey better fix it! Help us to fix it.  And if they do not, then\r\n\r\ntheir  licence will be taken away.  And for Ecstasy traffickers,\r\n\r\nwe  are going to make it as part of the presumption law, that if\r\n\r\nthey  carry a certain amount, we will determine what it  is,  we\r\n\r\nwill  presume that they are trafficking in Ecstasy, and we  also\r\n\r\ndo that for Ice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So be warned! Please do not trifle with the law. CNB is\r\n\r\nvery  serious in making sure that our place is safe  and  crime-free and drug-free for our children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of privatisation of services, let me again\r\n\r\nassure  Mr  Chng  that with the review of our Police  functions,\r\n\r\nsome  of the non-essential, actually non-Police functions,  will\r\n\r\nnot  be carried out by the Police.  So catching snakes, clearing\r\n\r\ndead animals, for example, that would not be done by the Police.\r\n\r\nI  think  there  are  proper agencies to  do  that.   They  will\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on  the  core Police functions:  crime  prevention,\r\n\r\ncrime  control, investigation and generally helping to  maintain\r\n\r\nlaw and order.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For functions that we are now doing which can be\r\n\r\nprivatised,  we  will continue to do so.  For  example,  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice  has already done away with towing of vehicles,  that  is\r\n\r\nbeing  left to the private sector.  Similarly, driving  centres,\r\n\r\ntest centres, that is now also being done by the private sector.\r\n\r\nThe  last  centre  that we have, Kampong Ubi,  we  have  already\r\n\r\nprivatised it.  Now somebody else is running it, not the Police.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the Minister is a very lucky man.

The trend\r\n\r\ncan be worrying and many of my constituents have expressed their\r\n\r\nconcern to me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the problem is more deep-seated, more deep-rooted than before. We must identify the root of the problem\r\n\r\nearly and nip it in the bud.  Sir, I believe that to tackle this\r\n\r\nproblem, we should not leave it to the police alone.  I think  a\r\n\r\nlarge  part of the Government has to be involved.  Besides,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Home  Affairs, other Government Ministries  should\r\n\r\nalso  play  a role in identifying and solving this  problem.   I\r\n\r\nhave identified the following Ministries.  Ministry of Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  whose  responsibility is the promotion  of  family\r\n\r\nvalues and community support system; Ministry of Education,  the\r\n\r\ninfluence   of  the  school  environment  on  youth   behaviour,\r\n\r\nslackness  in school discipline, all these have implications  on\r\n\r\nyouth  violence  today; MITA, mass media  may  have  undesirable\r\n\r\ninfluence  on  youth  if censorship is not well  under  control;\r\n\r\nMINDEF,  I  believe  that the two and the  two-and-a-half  years\r\n\r\nspent  in  National  Service  would  have  a  bearing  on  youth\r\n\r\nbehaviour, particularly depending on the company he mixes  with;\r\n\r\nand  the  Ministry  of  Labour, I believe  the  omnipresence  of\r\n\r\nforeign  labourers in Singapore, to some extent, has undesirable\r\n\r\nsocial influence on our youth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am therefore proposing that the Government seriously\r\n\r\nlook  into  forming  a  special  multi-Ministry  task  force  to\r\n\r\nidentify  the  root  causes of this problem  and  come  up  with\r\n\r\nsolutions.   Sir,  the problem is a serious  one  and  has  wide\r\n\r\nranging  implications.  I am therefore proposing that this  task\r\n\r\nforce be chaired\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby  at  least a Permanent Secretary and the best person  is  the\r\n\r\nPermanent  Secretary,  Ministry of  Home  Affairs,  with  senior\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from Ministry of Community Development, Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education, MITA, MINDEF and Ministry of Labour.  I urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister to consider this proposal seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davinder Singh (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, much of what I\r\n\r\nintended to say has already been said in this House about  youth\r\n\r\nviolence.   There is only one other point which I do  not  think\r\n\r\nhas been raised yet and this is another dimension to the problem\r\n\r\nwhich may have potentially far graver consequences arising  from\r\n\r\nyouth  violence  and teen gangs.  And it is  this.   Some  youth\r\n\r\ngangs  may  wittingly  or  otherwise organise  themselves  along\r\n\r\nracial  lines  and  we  know where the  problem  lies,  if  that\r\n\r\nhappens.   Because  if  you  have fight  between  two  gangs  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  races  that  will turn up its own  set  of  problems,\r\n\r\nparticularly in Singapore.  The difficulty with that is not only\r\n\r\nthe  fight  between the two gangs but the whole issue  of  youth\r\n\r\nviolence  will  be lost sight of in the larger  context  of  the\r\n\r\nracial  dimension.  All sorts of anxiety will arise and  parents\r\n\r\nwho  ought  to  be  focusing on their wayward children  will  be\r\n\r\ndistracted by the racial element in the fight.  And therein lies\r\n\r\na major difficulty which, I think, we ought to address.  Because\r\n\r\nthe moment there is a racial element, the neighbourhoods that we\r\n\r\nare  so accustomed to will no longer be safe because there  will\r\n\r\nbe distrust and suspicions will set in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we really need to do is to look towards the long term.\r\n\r\nToday, it is a youth violence problem.  But the moment you  have\r\n\r\ngangs of two different races taking each other on, there will be\r\n\r\ncomplexities which we will have great difficulty handling.   The\r\n\r\nway  the  Police will investigate the particular  incident  will\r\n\r\nalso  give rise to difficulties because there will be all  sorts\r\n\r\nof  rumours about preference towards one particular gang because\r\n\r\nof the affiliation to one race, etc.  This is a difficulty which\r\n\r\ntranscends  but  arises  from youth violence  and  I  think  the\r\n\r\nMinistry ought to pay some attention to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, violence among\r\n\r\nyouths  is not a new thing.  In fact, in America, in the  1950s,\r\n\r\nthey  had  this  problem.  This problem is highlighted  in  such\r\n\r\nfilms as \"Rebel Without a Cause\", starring the famous James Dean\r\n\r\nand  another film called \"Black Board Jungle\", highlighted  this\r\n\r\nproblem  in that country.  Now, we are experiencing this problem\r\n\r\nhere in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been pointed out, the disturbing thing about this is\r\n\r\nthat  these boys and girls who are involved in these fights  are\r\n\r\nnot  true  gangster  elements and  are  not  members  of  secret\r\n\r\nsocieties.   But many of them in fact come from good  homes.   I\r\n\r\nknow  of two teenagers, one a boy of 12 and the other a girl  of\r\n\r\n16,  both come from good homes.  Yet they were arrested  by  the\r\n\r\nPolice  for  rioting.  The problem is with the  parents.   These\r\n\r\nparents  are  both  working.  This is  perhaps  the  genesis  of\r\n\r\nteenage delinquency.  Both parents are out of their home most of\r\n\r\nthe  time  and  they do not have time for their  children.   The\r\n\r\nchildren are unsupervised and they get into bad company and also\r\n\r\ninto trouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government can assist to alleviate this problem by\r\n\r\ngiving  assistance.   I can think of three areas  in  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can assist.  Firstly, there must be more policing  in\r\n\r\nthe  likely  trouble  spots, such as  shopping  areas,  McDonald\r\n\r\nrestaurants,  entertainment places and  places  where  teenagers\r\n\r\nalso  tend to hang out.  I believe the police presence  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant.  They represent the authority.  This will  deter  the\r\n\r\nkids  from getting into fights.  These days, the Police  do  not\r\n\r\nseem  to  be  around when they are most needed.   I  heard  this\r\n\r\nmentioned at least more than once.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Police can deploy more of its uniformed\r\n\r\npersonnel  in places where youths congregate.  This will  surely\r\n\r\nhave  a  deterrent effect on the youngsters.   As  long  as  the\r\n\r\nyouths  are  made aware of the police presence,  they  shall  be\r\n\r\nafraid  to  get  into  fights because they  know  they  will  be\r\n\r\narrested.  Police presence is definitely an important factor  in\r\n\r\nhelping to solve this problem.  The importance of Police\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npresence  to  deter crimes among youths has been highlighted  by\r\n\r\nAssoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung earlier on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area in which the Government can help is to\r\n\r\nprovide more amenities in housing estates.  The CCs have  to  be\r\n\r\nspruced  up and made relevant to today's youngsters in order  to\r\n\r\nattract them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Police should revive their Boys' Clubs. In\r\n\r\nthe  past, the Police did organise Boys' Clubs.  I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhat  has  happened  to them now.  They all seem  to  have  been\r\n\r\nscrapped.  This idea of Boys' Club should be revived.  At  least\r\n\r\nif  the boys go to these clubs, we know that they are supervised\r\n\r\nand  not  get into bad company.  These are perhaps some  of  the\r\n\r\nmeasures  that  Government  can  do  to  help  eradicate   youth\r\n\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I thank the Members for\r\n\r\nspeaking.   First, Mr Chew Heng Ching's point about  whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  there  is  a  need for a task force.  He makes  this  as  a\r\n\r\nsuggestion.  I do not know whether he was in the House just  now\r\n\r\nwhen  I  talked about the Inter-Ministry Committee  on  Juvenile\r\n\r\nDelinquency,  which  I  chair, which draws  together  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nagencies.  But I think the point he made is whether or not there\r\n\r\nis  a need for a task force at the working level, chaired by the\r\n\r\nPS,  and  drawing  in more Ministries focusing  specifically  on\r\n\r\nyouth  violence or youth fighting.  I think it is a matter  that\r\n\r\nnot  only  the Home Affairs can consider.  In fact,  IMJD  is  a\r\n\r\nspring-off  from  the  IMC  Committee  under  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nCommunity Development.  Many Members have brought up this  point\r\n\r\nabout the need to look deeper into the problem.  I am sure  when\r\n\r\nMr  Tarmugi takes the floor for his Ministry's cut, this  matter\r\n\r\nwill arise again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is Mr Davinder Singh's point which is a good\r\n\r\npoint.   Mr Davinder Singh's questions whether or not there  are\r\n\r\nracial  overtones  to  teen  gangs and  whether  teen  gangs  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  races are fighting each other.  The total  number  of\r\n\r\nrioting  cases  involving youths from different races  increased\r\n\r\nfrom 11 in 1993 to 27 in 1996.  Despite this, it remains a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsmall  proportion of the total number of rioting cases involving\r\n\r\nyouths.   For example, the 27 cases in 1996 accounted  for  only\r\n\r\n12%  of  all  cases last year.  But, nevertheless, I  think  the\r\n\r\npoint Mr Davinder has made is a point worth taking which I  will\r\n\r\nask  the Police to continue monitoring.  Also of course,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  only a case of gangs of one race fighting gangs of  another\r\n\r\nrace.   Very  often, they are mixed and very often fights  arise\r\n\r\nnot  so  much  because  of  racial animosity  but  either  petty\r\n\r\nquarrels or territorial disputes.  Those that sparked off fights\r\n\r\nare  not racial in overtones.  That I think is heartening.   But\r\n\r\nwe must be vigilant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam talks about whether or not youth engaging in the\r\n\r\nteen violence is a passing phase.  He talks about \"Rebel Without\r\n\r\nA  Cause\" in America.  But the point is whether or not it  is  a\r\n\r\npassing  phase.  Perhaps, it is with some youths.   But  if  the\r\n\r\nnumbers are large enough, I think we should take care.  But  his\r\n\r\nother point is more interesting where he says we should saturate\r\n\r\nthe  ground, put more policemen all over the place, particularly\r\n\r\nwhere  teens gather, like McDonalds.  Sir, if we did that,  then\r\n\r\nwhat  he  claims is the situation where if you need  the  police\r\n\r\nthey are never around will indeed come true.  Because then,  you\r\n\r\nare deploying all your forces all over the place.  It is like in\r\n\r\ndefence  of  a  locality.  You do not spread them all  over  the\r\n\r\nplace.   You target them in places of vulnerability and that  is\r\n\r\nthe  current approach.  I think the approach is right.   Because\r\n\r\nlike  Boat Quay, for example, if we identify it as a place where\r\n\r\nincreased police presence can meet a particular need, we will do\r\n\r\nit.  But certainly not by putting them all over the place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the last point he made is why not have more Police\r\n\r\nBoys'  Clubs  or revive them.  The Police Boys' Clubs  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  disbanded.  What has happened is that they are  now  under\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Association.  They have taken a larger  role  and\r\n\r\nthey  are called the Boys' Clubs.  So they have not disappeared.\r\n\r\nBut  under  this structure, where the CCs are involved,  through\r\n\r\nthe  PA, they will reach out to a larger group.  And indeed,  if\r\n\r\nyour suggestion is that the Boys' Clubs should\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalso  play a role in creating more good gangs, then I think this\r\n\r\nis a suggestion worth considering.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Sir, can I seek a\r\n\r\nquick  clarification from the Minister of State about teen gangs\r\n\r\nand  racial  undertones?

And  with  the\r\n\r\nmedical  facilities now being upgraded, we are having  very  new\r\n\r\nhospitals not only in the public sector but also in the  private\r\n\r\nsector.   These  hospitals are equipped with more  sophisticated\r\n\r\ndiagnostic  equipment and other facilities.  The private  sector\r\n\r\nhas    also    followed   suit   with   new   medical   centres.\r\n\r\nGenerally,  patients  now demand a higher standard   of  medical\r\n\r\ncare.   I have heard of examples of children who suffer  from  a\r\n\r\nmild  cold, for example, have been asked to be confined  to  the\r\n\r\nhospital for two days for observation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has announced that it will increase the\r\n\r\nintake of medical students to NUS, from 150 to 200 per year.  My\r\n\r\nquestion  is:  with this demand of better medical care,  whether\r\n\r\nthis  is in fact sufficient to meet the needs of both the public\r\n\r\nand private sectors?  One of the factors that will go for better\r\n\r\nhealth  care  could  be more quality time spent  by  doctors  in\r\n\r\ntreating   the  patients.   It  is  not  just  the   number   of\r\n\r\nconsultations, but the duration of consultations.  And depending\r\n\r\non  the  complexity,  this duration can  vary  from  patient  to\r\n\r\npatient,  and the lack of attention by consultants,  specialists\r\n\r\nor   doctors  to  these  patients  will  be  interpreted  as   a\r\n\r\ndeterioration of medical service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of medical personnel in terms of better\r\n\r\nhealth care is even more important.  I refer to the nurses.  The\r\n\r\nnurses  are  the front line for both care during hospitalisation\r\n\r\nand  the  post-illness recovery.  Although the number of  nurses\r\n\r\nhas  increased in the last 10 years, there is consistent  demand\r\n\r\nfor  more nurses.  And what we have seen in Singapore now is  an\r\n\r\nincreasing  number  of   nurses from foreign  countries.   These\r\n\r\nnurses  come from different cultural backgrounds and  they  have\r\n\r\ndifferent  habits and different values.  The way they treat  our\r\n\r\npatients is very different from those of Singaporean nurses, and\r\n\r\nthere  have  been  an  increasing number of complaints  in  both\r\n\r\nGovernment  and private hospitals that these foreign nurses  are\r\n\r\nnot  well  equipped to handle some of our Singaporean  patients.\r\n\r\nThe  argument  is that because Singaporeans do not  want  to  be\r\n\r\nnurses, therefore we have to resort to importing them from other\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this cannot be completely true because we find a lot of\r\n\r\nSingaporean nurses working overseas.  In fact, quite a number of\r\n\r\nthem  work  in the Middle East and in other countries.   So  the\r\n\r\nquestion arises as to whether, in fact, we are paying our nurses\r\n\r\ncompetitive rates to entice them to stay and work in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe   cannot  equate  these  nurses'  remuneration  to  those  of\r\n\r\nequivalent   qualification in other parts of the civil  service.\r\n\r\nBecause\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnursing is actually a vocation.  If you want tender loving care,\r\n\r\nnot  everybody has that, and money cannot buy that.  The  person\r\n\r\nhas  to feel that she can provide this kind of care.  And if she\r\n\r\ncan  get  a good reward in providing the care, I think she  will\r\n\r\nstay in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what are we doing for\r\n\r\nthese  very important categories of people, doctors and  nurses,\r\n\r\nin  particular,  nurses.  I think many of our  troubles  in  the\r\n\r\nmedical service start with  nursing care.  The way that  we  can\r\n\r\nimprove  the nursing care will also go towards improving medical\r\n\r\nhealth care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on professional standards of doctors and nurses, this\r\n\r\nagain  relates to the same rising expectations of medical health\r\n\r\ncare  because the patients are now better off.  They are  paying\r\n\r\nmore  for  medical  service  and they  want  higher  quality  of\r\n\r\nservice,  especially  the quality time spent  on  each  patient.\r\n\r\nThis demand will continue to increase with better facilities and\r\n\r\nhigher medical charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a bit disturbed by recent cases of negligence in both\r\n\r\nthe  private and public sectors.  I understand, of course,  that\r\n\r\nthe  majority of doctors and nurses are providing good  service,\r\n\r\nbut  there  will  always be some who do not.  And  the  question\r\n\r\narises:  how do we police this and to make sure that  these  so-called black sheep are removed?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a profession like the doctors, we have the Singapore\r\n\r\nMedical   Council   who  would  entertain  complaints,   address\r\n\r\ncomplaints  to boards of inquiries, but invariably the  majority\r\n\r\nof  these members are also doctors themselves.  This is not  new\r\n\r\nin  the profession.  If you talk about the legal profession, the\r\n\r\nsame  thing applies.  Indeed, in any other profession, the peers\r\n\r\nappear to have to judge their own members.  I think in order for\r\n\r\njustice to be seen to be done visibly, we should allow for  more\r\n\r\nopen  inquiries, drawing more lay people in.  I understand  that\r\n\r\nin the proposed Medical Registration (Amendment) Bill coming up,\r\n\r\nthis  will  be addressed.  But this is also part of the  way  of\r\n\r\nimproving  our medical and health care services, because  if  we\r\n\r\ncan minimize the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincidents  of  malpractice and negligence, then our Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill  have  better  confidence in the  quality  of  the  medical\r\n\r\nservice provided by both our public and private sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Goh, you can take your three topics\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, with your\r\n\r\npermission,  I will speak on the first two topics, and  then  on\r\n\r\nthe third cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on fees and charges, I understand that the hospitals\r\n\r\nare  required  to  recover replacement  cost  of  equipment  and\r\n\r\nfurniture.   I  do  not know whether they are also  required  to\r\n\r\nrecover part of the building cost as well.  I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister how does this requirement impact on the  fees  and\r\n\r\ncharges that the hospitals are collecting from the patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second topic, this year the total operating\r\n\r\nsubvention  to  restructured  hospitals  and  voluntary  welfare\r\n\r\norganisations  (VWOs) is $586.87 million.  Out of  this  amount,\r\n\r\nonly   a  fraction  goes  to  aid  the  many  voluntary  welfare\r\n\r\norganisations and the amount is $31.61 million.  The  Government\r\n\r\nis  encouraging  more  VWOs to shoulder the responsibilities  of\r\n\r\nlooking  after the aged, the aged sick, the disabled,  even  the\r\n\r\ndying,  through  the  setting  up of  nursing  homes,  community\r\n\r\nhospitals, hospices and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Government helps the VWOs to set up such an\r\n\r\ninstitution  by supporting them 90% of their capital  cost,  but\r\n\r\nonly  50%  of  their  running cost.   As  such,  many  of  these\r\n\r\nvolunteers  in the VWOs, as some of my colleagues in this  House\r\n\r\nhave  already pointed out, have to run about raising  funds  all\r\n\r\nthe  time.  The running cost of a medium-sized nursing home, for\r\n\r\nexample, I was told with 150-200 beds, is more than $1 million a\r\n\r\nyear.   So with 50% Government grant, the volunteers will  still\r\n\r\nhave to raise more than half a million dollars a year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the greying of our population and with more VWOs\r\n\r\nexpected  to  get involved in such voluntary work, fund  raising\r\n\r\nwill  become more and more taxing on the part of the volunteers.\r\n\r\nSo I would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthink  that  the Government should seriously raise  the  funding\r\n\r\nlevel, especially for the operating cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now speak on the third topic in Mandarin, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Mr Chairman, in the past few years, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  taken  a  series  of  measures  to   help   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  traditional Chinese medicine  in  Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nthink this is a move in the right direction.   We must gradually\r\n\r\nhelp    Chinese   medicine   to  go  for   professionalism   and\r\n\r\nstandardisation,  thereby enhancing   the  standard  of  Chinese\r\n\r\nmedicine, and eventually eradicate the existence of bad  Chinese\r\n\r\nphysicians in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, Chinese medicine and Chinese physicians\r\n\r\nprovide  a very important service to the people.  Many  ordinary\r\n\r\npeople   are   using  such  services.   A   lot   of   voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations   are  providing  free  medical   services   using\r\n\r\ntraditional  Chinese  medicine and methods  of  treatment.    So\r\n\r\nstandardisation  and  professionalism  in  this  area  is   very\r\n\r\nimportant,  because it will eventually provide for  the  healthy\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Chinese medicine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are endeavouring to develop Singapore into a\r\n\r\nregional  medical  centre, we should not  confine  ourselves  to\r\n\r\nWestern medicine.  I believe that Chinese medicine can also play\r\n\r\na  role in this aspect.  I hope the Minister can enlighten us on\r\n\r\nthe  various  measures that have been taken over  the  past  few\r\n\r\nyears, and what is the  progress we have made so far.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I agree with Mr Goh\r\n\r\nChoon  Kang  that many people who are concerned with traditional\r\n\r\nChinese  medicine are interested to know what  action  has  been\r\n\r\ntaken by the Ministry of Health to implement the recommendations\r\n\r\nput  up by the special committee on traditional Chinese medicine\r\n\r\nled  by Dr Aline Wong.   I am very interested to know what  kind\r\n\r\nof  efforts  has  been  put in to promote  the  use  of  Chinese\r\n\r\nMedicine.  We know that the Ang Mo Kio Acupuncture Centre at the\r\n\r\nAng Mo Kio Community Hospital has received overwhelming response\r\n\r\nfrom the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSome  patients  have to be put on the waiting  list  for  months\r\n\r\nbefore they could receive treatment there.  Will the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHealth  look into the possibility of working together  with  the\r\n\r\nbodies  of  Chinese  physicians  to  set  up  a  second  Chinese\r\n\r\nTraditional Medicine and Acupuncture Centre to meet the needs of\r\n\r\nthese patients?\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, the Ministry of Health was planning to set up\r\n\r\na cancer research centre which was supposed to include the study\r\n\r\nof  the  curative effects of traditional Chinese medicine.   Has\r\n\r\nthis  plan  been materialised?  I believe the implementation  of\r\n\r\nthis  plan  will  definitely help to promote the development  of\r\n\r\ntraditional Chinese medicine in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, with the birth of \"Dolly\" which was cloned from an\r\n\r\nadult cell, this biotechnological breakthrough can be said to be\r\n\r\na  great  success  in the science of biological reproduction  of\r\n\r\nlives.   It  is a real breakthrough.  Some people are  overjoyed\r\n\r\nand  regarded   this as a new discovery in the  study  of  human\r\n\r\nbiology.   Yet  others  are worried.  The  parliaments  of  many\r\n\r\ncountries are now discussing this matter.  According to reports,\r\n\r\nthe UK Parliament has passed legislation to prohibit experiments\r\n\r\nin  human  cloning. The USA Government has stopped  the  use  of\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  Foundation  funds  to  assist  the  human  cloning\r\n\r\nscientific   research   plans.   The  parliaments   of   various\r\n\r\ncountries,  including  Germany,  Italy,  Brazil  and  Argentina,\r\n\r\nhave  also  urged their governments to prohibit  experiments  on\r\n\r\nhuman cloning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From public opinions and reactions from different quarters,\r\n\r\nit is apparent that many people have much to worry over this new\r\n\r\nscientific discovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, personally I am positive towards this particular\r\n\r\nscientific research.  I feel that our Ministry of Health  should\r\n\r\nnot  prohibit  the experiments on human cloning.  We  could  set\r\n\r\nsome rules and regulations to provide for this type of research.\r\n\r\nI am not a medical expert nor a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbiologist.  But I would like to bring out an example to look  at\r\n\r\nthis   scientific  research  from  another  angle.   I   believe\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  are at their 40s or 50s  should  be  able  to\r\n\r\nrecall  that  during the 60s and 70s,  the USA  and  the  former\r\n\r\nSoviet  Union   were  competing  to  be  the  leader  in   space\r\n\r\ntechnology. During that time the Soviet Union was the  first  to\r\n\r\nland  an  unmanned spacecraft on the surface of the moon,  while\r\n\r\nthe  American astronaut Neil Armstrong was the first man to  set\r\n\r\nfoot on the moon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can remember that, at that time, people from all over the\r\n\r\nworld  were  praising them for their achievements.  But  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, some other people were worried that this might  lead\r\n\r\nto  the  explosion of space war. At that time,  almost  all  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  carried  comments  that  the  advancement  of  space\r\n\r\ntechnology might bring disasters to mankind and the world  would\r\n\r\nbe  destroyed.  Some even thought that the world was ending very\r\n\r\nsoon.   At  that  time,  I  was still young.   I  harboured  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that  the development of space technology  was  very\r\n\r\nfrightening.  I thought that we were done for.   Yet  today,  it\r\n\r\nis quite evident  that   the development of space technology not\r\n\r\nonly  does  not  bring  the world to an end,  but  has  actually\r\n\r\nbenefited  mankind.   It  has  provided  us  with   a   lot   of\r\n\r\nconvenience.   Our  mobile  handphone, fax  machines,  Internet,\r\n\r\nsatellite  television, unmanned spacecraft,  etc.  are  benefits\r\n\r\nbrought to us from space technology.  Recently, a USA spacecraft\r\n\r\nhas  successfully  landed  on Mars.  It  will  help  mankind  to\r\n\r\nfurther  explore the mystery of life in outer space and  provide\r\n\r\nvery valuable information to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just imagine, years ago, advancement in space technology\r\n\r\nhad  brought about great fear to mankind.  This illustrates  the\r\n\r\npoint  that whenever there is a new invention we should view  it\r\n\r\nin  a  positive manner and accept it rather than  reject or  ban\r\n\r\nit.   Yes, unlike other kinds of technology, human cloning  will\r\n\r\nno  doubt create complications in human ethics, moral and  legal\r\n\r\nissues, family and social problems. This could be solved with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsensible  humane regulations, based not on court-room  decisions\r\n\r\nbut through  broad enlightened public debates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as in the prehistoric times human beings did not have\r\n\r\nany  family,  moral  or  legal  concepts.   If  anthropologists,\r\n\r\nsociologists,  philosophers and lawyers today  can  apply  their\r\n\r\nintelligence  and  creativity like the  biologists  and  medical\r\n\r\nexperts  to  set up a standard for human ethics and moral  legal\r\n\r\nissues, this will serve as a new challenge for them in finding a\r\n\r\nsolution to create a model or formula to accommodate a new  kind\r\n\r\nof  family  and society formation.  Then like space  technology,\r\n\r\nhuman  cloning  should  be  viewed positively.   I  think  human\r\n\r\ncloning may be beneficial to mankind in future.  Of course,  any\r\n\r\nkind of changes will meet with resistance.  This will require us\r\n\r\nto  change our mindset. We have to be farsighted, courageous and\r\n\r\non top of it, we must have the scientific power of persuasion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the Ministry of Health has not stated its\r\n\r\nstand on human cloning.  I hope that our Ministry of Health will\r\n\r\nnot  follow the countries in the world in forbidding the cloning\r\n\r\nof  human  cells.  I think we should go for a set of  sound  and\r\n\r\nrational rules and regulations to allow this research to go  on.\r\n\r\nResearchers  and  experts  in  the  medical  field  from   other\r\n\r\ncountries  can be invited to come to Singapore to further  their\r\n\r\nresearch in this field.  Of course, in regulating, we must  have\r\n\r\nsome  sound basis to provide for which categories of  people  to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  the  experiment,  for  example,  they  must  be\r\n\r\nmarried,  above  a  certain age, or have  good  reasons   to  be\r\n\r\ncloned,  etc.    I think these are points which we  can  further\r\n\r\ndiscuss and study.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

As a result,  there\r\n\r\nis   increasing  specialisation  within  the  medical  services.\r\n\r\nIncreasing  medical  specialisation  results  in  an   increased\r\n\r\navailability  of treatment choices.  This will not only  improve\r\n\r\nthe quality of health care services that the average Singaporean\r\n\r\ncan get access to but it will also help Singapore develop into a\r\n\r\nregional centre of medical excellence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, increasing medical specialisation, especially\r\n\r\nwithin  our  restructured hospitals, has also resulted  in  some\r\n\r\nundesirable trends.  In SGH alone, it seems as though  there  is\r\n\r\nalmost a separate department for every specialty available.  One\r\n\r\nunintended  effect  of  this is the fragmentation  of  care,  as\r\n\r\npatients   often   have  more  than  one  medical   pre-existing\r\n\r\ncondition.  For example, if a patient who has diabetes  mellitus\r\n\r\nand  has  multiple  complications of diabetes  mellitus  and  is\r\n\r\nadmitted  to  SGH for chest infection, he will  pose  a  dilemma\r\n\r\nbecause   he  not  only  has  chest  infection  but  has   other\r\n\r\ncomplications of diabetes such as disease of the heart arteries,\r\n\r\neye  problems, kidney damage, nerve complications and  poor  leg\r\n\r\ncirculation.   If the patient is admitted to the department  for\r\n\r\nrespiratory diseases, it will not be unlikely that there will be\r\n\r\nreferrals  to  other  doctors  to  manage  his  problems.   Each\r\n\r\nreferral   to  another  department  will  result  in  additional\r\n\r\nconsultation costs.  Even though there may be a doctor,  who  is\r\n\r\noverall  in  charge of the patient, more often, because  of  the\r\n\r\ndifferentiation into specialised departments, it is likely  that\r\n\r\nthe  other  areas will be left to other specialists.  When  this\r\n\r\npatient is discharged from the hospital, he will have to see the\r\n\r\neye  specialist at the National Eye Centre for his  eye  problem\r\n\r\nand see the kidney specialist and the chest\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nspecialist  at  SGH.  He will also have to go  to  the  National\r\n\r\nHeart  Centre to see the heart specialist.  If he is not already\r\n\r\non  follow-up in the SGH by the neurological department for  his\r\n\r\nnerve  problems,  he  may  also have  to  make  a  trip  to  the\r\n\r\nNeuroscience Centre at Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  As a  result  of\r\n\r\nthese multiple visits, the financial cost and time spent will be\r\n\r\nsubstantial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not deny that there will be a need to have patients\r\n\r\nto  be seen by medical specialists of different specialties, but\r\n\r\nsome  of  these problems are simple enough to be  managed  by  a\r\n\r\ngeneralist.  Also, medical officers and house officers who  work\r\n\r\nin  these  departments will also have a narrow exposure  to  the\r\n\r\ndisciplines  of  medicine  and have less  grounding  in  general\r\n\r\nmedicine.  This will also give them less working experience  and\r\n\r\nexposure to the wide spectrum of medical problems.  It will also\r\n\r\nincrease  the  tendency to cross-refer as  doctors  become  very\r\n\r\nfocused within their own disciplines even at a very early stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excessive referrals also put an increased strain on doctors\r\n\r\nwho already work extremely hard in the hospitals.  Precious time\r\n\r\nis  taken out for tending to minor medical problems which can be\r\n\r\nmanaged  by any other doctor.  Costs will also increase  because\r\n\r\nby  having  more  departments, there will be more administrative\r\n\r\nstaff  required  and there will be more office  space  required.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  will have to balance the need for  specialisation\r\n\r\nand  the need to optimise our resources.  The unintended  result\r\n\r\nof   increase   in   health  care  cost   resulting   from   the\r\n\r\ndifferentiation of the specialist departments must be studied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no simple solutions but one suggestion that I\r\n\r\nhave  for the Ministry, which they may wish to consider, is that\r\n\r\nthey  may  want  to have a hospital handbook on \"Common  Medical\r\n\r\nProblems  in  the Hospital\" for doctors in the hospitals,  which\r\n\r\nwill  lay down the investigations and the treatments for  common\r\n\r\nmedical problems seen in hospitals.  This will minimise the need\r\n\r\nfor unnecessary\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreferrals  for  simple  problems in the restructured  hospitals.\r\n\r\nSuch  a  medical  handbook on common medical conditions  in  the\r\n\r\nhospital will also allow optimal cost-effective choices  in  the\r\n\r\ninvestigations and treatments.  Addressing these  concerns  will\r\n\r\nnot  only  contain  the costs of health care but  it  will  also\r\n\r\nincrease  the  efficiency of our health service, both  from  the\r\n\r\nprovider's and the recipient's viewpoint.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Choo is not here. Dr Lim, would you like\r\n\r\nto continue with your next topic?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, health care services is an\r\n\r\nimportant  area of concern for all Singaporeans.  As demand  for\r\n\r\nhealth  care  services  increases in the  next  millennium,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  have  to  formulate  policies  to  maximise  the\r\n\r\npotential  of our limited resources.  I would like to  know  how\r\n\r\nthe Ministry will meet some of these challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the national centres. The establishment of\r\n\r\nnational  centres for various medical specialties  will  improve\r\n\r\nthe  standards of care within these specialties.  Many of  these\r\n\r\nnational  centres  will  also  have  expensive  diagnostic   and\r\n\r\ntherapeutic  equipment.   How  does  the  Ministry   prevent   a\r\n\r\nGovernment  or restructured hospital from duplicating  resources\r\n\r\nand  equipment already available in the national centres  or  in\r\n\r\nother  hospitals?  I am not only referring to MRI  machines  but\r\n\r\nalso  to  CT  scanners, ultra-sound machines, lasers  and  other\r\n\r\nexpensive  equipment.   Is  the mechanism  an  ad  hoc  informal\r\n\r\nmechanism?   Or  is  there a structured formal  mechanism?   The\r\n\r\nMinistry   must  define  the  role  of  national   centres   and\r\n\r\ncorresponding  disciplines  in the hospitals  clearly  to  avoid\r\n\r\nstraining  our  limited  medical resources,  especially  medical\r\n\r\nmanpower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my second point - medical manpower. It\r\n\r\nwas  not too long ago that the Ministry had said that the number\r\n\r\nof  medical  students  would be restricted  and  the  number  of\r\n\r\noverseas  universities, with recognisable basic medical degrees,\r\n\r\nwould  also  be  restricted.  Within the short space  of  a  few\r\n\r\nyears,  the  Ministry has now reversed its stand and  said  that\r\n\r\nmanpower needs are insufficient.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCertainly, it is not easy to make manpower projections  but  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has a long record of managing the manpower  needs  and\r\n\r\none  would expect their projections will not be too far off  the\r\n\r\nmark.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern now is whether the current response to increase\r\n\r\nthe  medical student intake and to take in more foreign  doctors\r\n\r\nwill  result  in  excessive manpower in the  near  future.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  should explain to Members of the House and give  us  a\r\n\r\nbetter  picture  of the rationale for such changes  in  manpower\r\n\r\nprojections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, service conditions in hospitals. The terms of\r\n\r\nservice  and  remuneration  in the restructured  hospitals  keep\r\n\r\nchanging.   The  remuneration system has been modified  numerous\r\n\r\ntimes  in  the last 10 years.  I am certain that the  Ministry's\r\n\r\nintentions  for  these changes are good.  But  when  the  system\r\n\r\nkeeps changing very often, it affects the morale of doctors  and\r\n\r\nthey leave the service.  The severe shortage in medical manpower\r\n\r\nis  felt  mainly  in the Government and restructured  hospitals.\r\n\r\nUnless service conditions improve, this will continue to be  so,\r\n\r\nno matter how many new doctors and foreign doctors are employed.\r\n\r\nService  conditions must be improved.  It goes beyond  financial\r\n\r\nrecognition.  Doctors want their work to be recognised,  whether\r\n\r\nit is medical treatment administered or research papers.  Junior\r\n\r\ndoctors get demoralised when credits go to others for work  they\r\n\r\nperform.   It is not pay alone but also the need to  be  treated\r\n\r\nfairly,  to be heard and for efforts to be recognised.  Then  he\r\n\r\nwill  feel  that  his  contribution to the  health  services  is\r\n\r\nappreciated.   A happy doctor is also likely to  remain  in  the\r\n\r\nrestructured hospital service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, leadership role of Ministry of Health. The\r\n\r\nMinister  has said that SGH is a private entity and  it  is  not\r\n\r\npart  of  the  civil service and in fact all the  administrative\r\n\r\ndecisions are taken by the management and board of directors  of\r\n\r\nSGH.   If  this  similarly applies to all the other restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals,  how does the Ministry maintain its supervisory  role\r\n\r\neither  directly or through HCS?  If the Government is providing\r\n\r\nsignificant development\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand   operating  expenditure  and  subventions  to  the  various\r\n\r\nrestructured  hospitals,  it would  be  inconceivable  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  cannot  have a significant say in  the  management  of\r\n\r\nthese  hospitals.  If we want to prevent unnecessary competition\r\n\r\nbetween  our  restructured hospitals, if we want to improve  the\r\n\r\nmorale  of  our  medical staff, if we want to pool  our  medical\r\n\r\nresources together, if we want to contain costs, if we  want  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  high quality health service, then the Ministry  must\r\n\r\ntake a strong leadership role.  The Ministry has to look for new\r\n\r\nsolutions  for these problems and help our health  service  meet\r\n\r\nthe needs of the next millennium.\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Two days ago,\r\n\r\nwe  heard many stories about wool and sheep and how the shepherd\r\n\r\nsheared  the wool from the fat sheep and gave them to  the  thin\r\n\r\nsheep.  Now we go to another aspect of the story, to look at old\r\n\r\nfeeble  and  sick sheep which are unable to grow wool  and  they\r\n\r\nneed  covered pens to shelter them and shepherds to  look  after\r\n\r\nthem.   Sir, with the problem of the aging population  receiving\r\n\r\nmore and more attention, people are increasingly concerned about\r\n\r\nthe health care services for the aged, especially services which\r\n\r\nare community-based.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April this year, the Ministry of Health announced the\r\n\r\nsetting  up of a department specialising in health care services\r\n\r\nfor the aged.  An inter-Ministry department will also be set  up\r\n\r\nto  assist in formulating relevant policies and measures.   This\r\n\r\nis  good  news.   It  shows that this issue has  been  receiving\r\n\r\npriority  attention.  In less than 30 years' time, out of  every\r\n\r\nfour  people, one will be above the age of 65.  We will have  to\r\n\r\nprepare  early for the situation.  I would like to suggest  that\r\n\r\nwe  should  strengthen health care services for  the  aged,  and\r\n\r\nprovide  them with other facilities on a community basis.   More\r\n\r\nand  more  old people are staying alone at home.  More and  more\r\n\r\nday-care  centres  are  set  up in  the  neighbourhoods  of  HDB\r\n\r\nestates.   We  need to expand the role of Government polyclinics\r\n\r\nso that they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to  provide services to the old  people  in  the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood.   For example, the entrances  and  waiting  rooms\r\n\r\nshould be improved to give more convenience to the old people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Ministry of Health to also consider\r\n\r\nintroducing  mobile  clinics  which  could  visit  the   various\r\n\r\nneighbourhoods  to provide medical services to the  old  people.\r\n\r\nHome nursing service should also be improved and enhanced.  This\r\n\r\nshould  be  able to deal with the needs of the aging population.\r\n\r\nIn   addition,  we  should  also  ensure  that  we  have  enough\r\n\r\nrecreational  and  rehabilitation centres for  the  old  people.\r\n\r\nRight  now, such centres are all run by voluntary organisations.\r\n\r\nIn  our  past,  we depended on social, community  and  religious\r\n\r\ngroups  to form aided schools to provide more school places  for\r\n\r\nour  students,  and ensure that everybody gets a  place  in  the\r\n\r\nschool.   This  worked  very  well for  the  interim  until  the\r\n\r\nGovernment was in a position to take over the administration  of\r\n\r\nall  the schools in Singapore.  In the same way, I hope that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health can also work along the same line and  build\r\n\r\non the foundation of the existing private rehabilitation centres\r\n\r\nto gradually develop more facilities for the old and poor people\r\n\r\namong us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, what kind of assistance is the Government giving\r\n\r\nto  the  voluntary organisations in running such centres?   Will\r\n\r\nthe  Government consider giving them more aid to  lighten  their\r\n\r\nfinancial   burden,  for  example,  give  them  more   technical\r\n\r\nassistance,  medical  supplies and other  materials  to  improve\r\n\r\ntheir efficiency and effectiveness?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, regionalisation is the\r\n\r\nlatest  buzzword.  Singapore wants to be a regional medical  hub\r\n\r\nand,  at  the  same time, we want to expand into the  region  as\r\n\r\nindustrial  parks and Singapore companies are set  up  overseas.\r\n\r\nThere  will  be  a need for Singapore health care facilities  to\r\n\r\nexpand overseas.  I want to ask the Minister what measures  have\r\n\r\nbeen  taken by the Ministry in conjunction with other Ministries\r\n\r\nto promote Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas a major regional hub and to attract supporting health related\r\n\r\nindustries into Singapore.  What is the role of the Ministry  or\r\n\r\nthe  Health  Corporation  of  Singapore  in  promoting  regional\r\n\r\nmedical  expansion?  What joint ventures have HCS  embarked  on?\r\n\r\nAnd  what  support  or  incentive  measures  are  available   to\r\n\r\nencourage  Singapore companies to set up health care  facilities\r\n\r\noverseas?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> Sir, the Addenda to the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHealth  in  the  President's  Speech  has  mentioned  about  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Singapore into a medical hub.  I am not too  sure\r\n\r\nwhether  Dr  Michael Lim's idea of expanding medical service  in\r\n\r\nthe  region  comes within this definition.  I  will  only  speak\r\n\r\nabout developing Singapore as a medical hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of this development depends again, as I\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier, on the kind of doctors we have available  and\r\n\r\nthe standard of care that we can provide.  Both are not easy  to\r\n\r\ncome  by.   But  as  distinct from other services,  the  medical\r\n\r\nservices aimed at developing our medical centre do not  seem  to\r\n\r\nbe  given much, if at all, any incentives.  For example, in  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and financial services, we have, according to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Trade and Industry, a host of incentives that  are\r\n\r\ntoo numerous to mention.  But I can think of none for the heatlh\r\n\r\nservices.   It  is understandable perhaps that in  the  case  of\r\n\r\nhealth,  it  is  difficult to separate local as against  foreign\r\n\r\ntreatment.  But the same goes for manufacturing industries,  not\r\n\r\nall  the products are consumed as exports, but some are consumed\r\n\r\nlocally.  So I would like to just ask the Ministry whether  they\r\n\r\nare  working with the Ministry of Finance on possible incentives\r\n\r\nto  help  our  doctors  to develop medical services  that  cater\r\n\r\nmainly  for foreign patients.  Because these are brain services.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  we are supposed to be good in brains, I think we should\r\n\r\nalso develop brains for our medical doctors and nurses.  And  if\r\n\r\nwe  can provide the incentives in various forms, which I am  not\r\n\r\nquite  aware  of  at the moment, perhaps, we  can  realise  this\r\n\r\nobjective soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David T. E. Lim:</b> Sir, I would just like to add on to\r\n\r\nwhat  Dr  Michael Lim and Mr Bernard Chen had said  and  perhaps\r\n\r\nalso  raise  one  of  the concerns that  the  development  of  a\r\n\r\nregional medical hub in Singapore may have.  Certainly, it  will\r\n\r\nput  a  strain on our resources in terms of doctors, nurses  and\r\n\r\nthis  then  leads  to concern about whether there  will  be  any\r\n\r\nadverse  impact  on  the  health care  for  Singapore  citizens,\r\n\r\nwhether  this  will  drive down standards or whether  this  will\r\n\r\ndrive  up  costs.  But having said that, there are a  number  of\r\n\r\nreasons  why we should pursue this.  Certainly, it will help  us\r\n\r\ntake advantage of an area that we are very strong in, which  is,\r\n\r\nas Mr Bernard Chen has said, in terms of the brain services.  We\r\n\r\nare  already a regional leader in this area and if we do not  go\r\n\r\ninto this industry, then others in the region will.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, having a regional hub in Singapore will also help\r\n\r\nto  raise the standard of medical care in Singapore and, in  the\r\n\r\nlong  term,  this will help to drive down costs rather  than  to\r\n\r\ndrive  them  up.   In so far as the costs for the  lower  income\r\n\r\npeople are concerned, this can be dealt with as we do so now, in\r\n\r\nterms  of  administrative processes and in terms of making  sure\r\n\r\nthat subsidies are given to those who need them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, we have got to ask ourselves whether\r\n\r\nor  not  we  want  to develop this industry and whether  we  are\r\n\r\ndriven  by  the vision of creating a new industry,  a  new  area\r\n\r\nwhere  we  can  create for ourselves better jobs  and  earn  for\r\n\r\nourselves a better living.  And if so, then we should start  off\r\n\r\nwith the vision as the basis and work around the problems.   And\r\n\r\nI  hope  the  Minister will then state what our policy  is  with\r\n\r\nregard to the development of the idea of a regional medical  hub\r\n\r\nin Singapore and also tell us about the latest plans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, there is still a group of poor\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  despite  our health  subsidies  still  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  their  hospital  bills.   Yet  others  worry  that   the\r\n\r\nincreasing health care costs will make basic medical care out of\r\n\r\ntheir  reach.  The concern is specially true among  the  elderly\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Medifund is said to be the help of last resort so that\r\n\r\nno  Singaporean  will  be denied access  to  basic  health  care\r\n\r\nbecause  of  inability to pay.  As Medifund is still  relatively\r\n\r\nnew to Singaporeans, I would like to ask the Minister for Health\r\n\r\nto  enlighten us on how Medifund is helping needy patients,  how\r\n\r\nmuch we have spent and how many Singaporeans have benefited from\r\n\r\nthe  scheme.  How do we ensure that genuine hardship  cases  are\r\n\r\nnot  denied help and that the fund will not be abused  by  those\r\n\r\nfamilies who could actually afford to pay the hospital bills.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, not too long\r\n\r\nago,  we  had  a  big debate in this House about  the  need  for\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  control  the number of doctors.   This  is  done\r\n\r\nthrough  both  the control and intake of medical  students  into\r\n\r\nNUS, and a drastic cut in the number of overseas medical schools\r\n\r\nwhich  are  recognised by the Singapore Medical Council.   About\r\n\r\ntwo  months ago, I read in the Sunday Times that there is now  a\r\n\r\nshortage  of doctors.  My question to the Minister is:  have  we\r\n\r\nbeen  unnecessarily  stringent  in  controlling  the  number  of\r\n\r\ndoctors previously?  Should we not let market forces decide  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  doctors to be allowed into Singapore or to  have  in\r\n\r\nSingapore instead of letting the Government control the numbers?\r\n\r\nWould  the Singapore Medical Council now recognise more overseas\r\n\r\nmedical  schools than the current 28 for purposes  of  admitting\r\n\r\ngraduates  for registration as doctors?  For example,  why  does\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Medical Council recognise more UK and  Australian\r\n\r\nmedical  schools than those from US and Canada?  I am told  that\r\n\r\nout  of  125  accredited US medical schools, only about  10  are\r\n\r\nrecognised.  Would the Minister consider reviewing the  list  of\r\n\r\nrecognised overseas medical schools?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I am a medical\r\n\r\ndoctor.   It  has  been quite some time since the  restructuring\r\n\r\nprogramme  of our Government hospitals.  Perhaps, it  is  timely\r\n\r\nthat this House be given an update of the hospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim just now highlighted some problems faced by\r\n\r\npatients with multi-disease illness.  Have services improved  in\r\n\r\nterms   of  waiting  time  for  patients  to  see  doctors   for\r\n\r\nconsultation  and treatment modalities?  Have adequate  C  Class\r\n\r\nbeds  been set aside for those Singaporeans in the lower  income\r\n\r\nbracket?    Is   affordability  to  stay  in  such  restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals  a  serious issue?  And how does the establishment  of\r\n\r\nthese hospitals affect the Medisave accounts of Singaporeans  as\r\n\r\nmedical costs have gone up?  Do they have to contribute more  to\r\n\r\nMedisave  in  future?  What control has the Ministry  of  Health\r\n\r\nover such hospitals?  Again, Dr Michael Lim has highlighted some\r\n\r\nof  these  issues in this particular field.  Is there a  careful\r\n\r\nmonitoring of the type of services being provided so that  there\r\n\r\nis  no wastage of manpower and no duplication of equipment?   Is\r\n\r\nthere  evidence  that hospitals are over-servicing  patients  to\r\n\r\njustify  the  purchase  of  expensive equipment  by  encouraging\r\n\r\npatients  to use the equipment when the indications are  not  so\r\n\r\nobvious,  like having a CT scan for any complaint  of  headache?\r\n\r\nThere  must  be  some performance indicators  to  monitor  these\r\n\r\nhospitals.  What are these and how have these hospitals measured\r\n\r\nup to these indicators?\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the teaching of medical students is not a money making\r\n\r\nproposition.  In fact, it could be a chore for these  hospitals.\r\n\r\nIn   the   past,   where  bottom  line  is  not  the   important\r\n\r\nconsideration,  all Government hospitals took to  teaching  very\r\n\r\nreadily  and  eagerly,  but  now things  have  changed,  as  the\r\n\r\nhospital culture has changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are our restructured hospitals willing therefore to train\r\n\r\nour  medical  students?   If  so,  do  they  have  a  structured\r\n\r\nprogramme with NUH for such training?  Or are they doing  it  as\r\n\r\nrequired  by  the  Ministry of Health,  as  they  are  receiving\r\n\r\nsubvention grants?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the future of the restructured hospitals? There\r\n\r\nare now centres for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntreatment  like  cardiac  centre for  treating  heart  patients,\r\n\r\npaediatric centre at the Kandang Kerbau Hospital, skin  centres,\r\n\r\nurology  centres,  etc.  When such centres are established,  the\r\n\r\nrestructured  hospitals must feel a little bit  uneasy  or  even\r\n\r\nthreatened, as these centres would draw patients away from those\r\n\r\nrestructured  hospitals with less than adequate  facilities  for\r\n\r\nthe particular modality of treatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then restructured hospitals have to meet the bottom\r\n\r\nline.  They must find ways and means to break even or even  make\r\n\r\na  profit.   This  being so, there is a likely possibility  that\r\n\r\nthese hospitals may set up subsidiary companies to start special\r\n\r\nfacilities  like  the gamma knife project, and  charge  patients\r\n\r\naccordingly,  as  a  subsidiary company may not  be  obliged  to\r\n\r\nfollow the fee structure of the hospitals concerned.  This would\r\n\r\nmean  that subsidised patients, C and B2 patients, may  need  to\r\n\r\npay  the  full fare for a service of this kind.  And  pensioners\r\n\r\nmay  not be allowed access to such facilities because it is  not\r\n\r\npart of the hospital entitlement scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as medical health care has become a lucrative\r\n\r\nindustry - a word which I really hate, we are not an industry  - is  the Ministry watching very carefully that such hospitals may\r\n\r\nwant  to  raise  funds by way of listing on our stock  exchange?\r\n\r\nPrecedent  has been set with the listing of a group  clinic  and\r\n\r\nthe control of practically all the private hospitals by a public\r\n\r\nlisted  company.  The major shareholders of these public  listed\r\n\r\ncompanies are Malaysians.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monopoly of control of our private hospitals is not\r\n\r\ngood for Singapore.  This means that they set the pricing of our\r\n\r\nmedical services for hospital care in the private sector, as the\r\n\r\nmonopoly rules out practically all competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must remember that 80% of our primary health care\r\n\r\nis  in  the  hands  of  the private sector.   If  listed  public\r\n\r\ncompanies run these set-ups, what will happen to the health care\r\n\r\ndelivery  system?   A  listed  company  has  to  answer  to  the\r\n\r\nshareholders  first, and it is rubbish to say that  patients  do\r\n\r\ncome  first in such hospitals and clinics.  A listed company  is\r\n\r\nnot a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncharitable  institution.   Medicine,  like  others,  is  not   a\r\n\r\ncommercial enterprise.  At the core of the practice of  medicine\r\n\r\nis  humanity.   It  should  never be  viewed  in  the  strictest\r\n\r\ncommercial sense.  I am therefore pre-empting any possible  move\r\n\r\nby  the Government to allow any restructured hospital to seek  a\r\n\r\nlisting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not a far-fetched idea. When you and I first\r\n\r\ncame  to this House, we  could not imagine that sacred cows like\r\n\r\nPUB,  Telecom,  MRT  and  PSA could one day  be  privatised  and\r\n\r\neventually get listed, or already listed like Telecom.   As  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health  gives  more  and  more  autonomy  to  such\r\n\r\nhospitals,  as highlighted again by Dr Michael Lim,  they  could\r\n\r\neventually  decide to let such hospitals become  privatised  and\r\n\r\nbecome  part  of  the  Government's stable of  Government-linked\r\n\r\ncompanies.   This then would pave the way for seeking listing on\r\n\r\nthe  stock exchange, if not direct, indirectly by way  of  being\r\n\r\npart of Government GLCs like Keppel, DBS Land, Sembawang and the\r\n\r\nST  group of companies.  Or the present GLC companies could  buy\r\n\r\nup the privatised restructured hospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Government, we must not abdicate our role of providing\r\n\r\nhealth care to our people  We must not abdicate our role to  the\r\n\r\nprivate   companies  or  even  to  our  own  GLCs.   It   is   a\r\n\r\nresponsibility  we should shoulder honourably.   Thus,  we  must\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  pay  more  attention to the  remaining  Government\r\n\r\nhospitals  like Alexandra Hospital and Woodbridge Hospital.   We\r\n\r\nmust  provide  more  funds  to  these  hospitals  to  help  such\r\n\r\nhospitals   upgrade,  to  meet  the  needs  of  a  sophisticated\r\n\r\npopulation.  We must prevent these hospitals from restructuring.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  would  go  further and say that any new  hospital  built\r\n\r\nshould remain purely Government controlled and, in this way,  we\r\n\r\nwould give our people more choices of hospital care.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, many people are unhappy about our\r\n\r\nA&E  service.

Many people told me that they had to wait for\r\n\r\nmany,  many  hours, as long as four hours, as  reported  in  the\r\n\r\npress.

I  wonder whether these problems arise as a  result  of\r\n\r\nshortage  of  doctors,  shortage of  nurses  and,  worse  still,\r\n\r\nshortage  of senior doctors or consultants.  Because  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink we should treat A&E departments as half-way houses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there have been newspaper reports indicating that\r\n\r\nour A&E departments are not providing appropriate, efficient and\r\n\r\ncorrect service.  I hope this is just an anomaly and not typical\r\n\r\nof  our  A&E service.  There were also reports of the misuse  of\r\n\r\nthe A&E service by people who should really go to the Government\r\n\r\npolyclinics or to the GPs for treatment for their minor or  non-emergency illnesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I was also told that the ambulances, when\r\n\r\nresponding  to calls and when they realise or they thought  that\r\n\r\nit was not an acute case, they would rather return empty handed.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to ask the Minister to respond to my queries,  my\r\n\r\nconcerns,   what  is  being  done  to  address  the   issue   of\r\n\r\novercrowding,  complaints  about the  inefficiency  of  our  A&E\r\n\r\nservice, about the ambulance service and the long waiting  time,\r\n\r\nand how can we really ensure that A&E departments will be run in\r\n\r\nthe most appropriate manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to my next topic on tobacco licensing.\r\n\r\nDespite  the  law  prohibiting the sale of  tobacco  to  minors,\r\n\r\ncigarettes  are  still readily available  to  our  people.   The\r\n\r\ncontinued  rise in smoking amongst Singaporeans, especially  the\r\n\r\nSingapore youths, has caused much concern among parents,  school\r\n\r\nprincipals, teachers and members of the public too.  Many people\r\n\r\nhave   called  for  stringent  policing  of  the  retailers   of\r\n\r\ncigarettes.  They call for shopkeepers who flout the ban on  the\r\n\r\nsale of cigarettes to minors to be identified and penalised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more effective control of smoking among youths, the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health should really license tobacco retailers.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry should also consider restricting the number of licences\r\n\r\nissued.   There  should be strict monitoring  of  compliance  by\r\n\r\nretailers to ensure that they do not sell\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncigarettes  to minors.  If tobacco retailers are caught  selling\r\n\r\ncigarettes to minors, their licence should be revoked.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to thank the 19 speakers who have spoken so far.  I think I\r\n\r\nhave about 50 minutes to reply to them.  I will try to be brief.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on medical manpower. This has been touched upon by\r\n\r\nthree  speakers, Mr Bernard Chen, Mr Lew Syn Pau and Dr  Michael\r\n\r\nLim.   They  have  asked  whether we are going  to  have  enough\r\n\r\nmedical  manpower to maintain the high standard of medical  care\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  and  asked what we are doing  to  alleviate  the\r\n\r\nshortage in manpower that appears to be existing today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of medical manpower is, of course, of great\r\n\r\ninterest  to many Singaporeans, because it impacts significantly\r\n\r\non  how  well we are going to deliver our medical services.   In\r\n\r\nparticular,  the  decision to increase  the  intake  of  medical\r\n\r\nstudents  into  NUS, starting from this year, has also  enhanced\r\n\r\ninterest in this topic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first explain what is the doctor manpower situation\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  At the national level, 10 years ago, in 1987, we\r\n\r\nhad  a  total  of  2,940 doctors in Singapore.  Today,  we  have\r\n\r\n4,660.   This is an increase of 59% over 10 years.   The  public\r\n\r\nsector has benefited, because the medical manpower in the public\r\n\r\nsector has increased from 1,420 in 1987 to 2,180 today.  This is\r\n\r\nan increase of 53%.  It is significant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor to bed ratio in the public sector has also\r\n\r\nimproved very significantly.  We had one doctor to 5.7  beds  in\r\n\r\n1987.   Today, we have 3.7 beds to one doctor.  So doctors  have\r\n\r\nmore time to look after patients as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the numbers have gone up, if the bed to doctor ratio has\r\n\r\nimproved,  why  then  is there a shortage  today?   Is  there  a\r\n\r\nshortage  and,  if  so,  where?  Let  me  explain  the  manpower\r\n\r\nsituation  in  terms of both the short term and the  long  term.\r\n\r\nThe short term, ie, today, there is a shortage in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  public  sector.  But the shortage is in two  very  specific\r\n\r\nareas.   The  first  is  in the area of medical  officers.   The\r\n\r\nsecond is in certain specialties.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of medical officers, maybe it is useful for me to\r\n\r\nexplain  what medical officers are, because other than  the  few\r\n\r\ndoctors here, most of the Members are not members of the medical\r\n\r\nfraternity.  All doctors are required to serve a five-year  bond\r\n\r\nwith the Government after completing their housemanship and they\r\n\r\nserve  these  five  years as medical officers.   The  number  of\r\n\r\nmedical officers required in the public sector is determined  by\r\n\r\nthe requests submitted by the hospitals, ie, the Ministry relies\r\n\r\non  hospitals to tell us what they require, then we will recruit\r\n\r\nand make available the number that they want.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have about 880 medical officers today. Up to 1994, the\r\n\r\npublic  sector actually had a surplus of medical officers.    In\r\n\r\nfact,  from  1992  to  1994, the hospitals had  to  offer  early\r\n\r\nrelease from the bonds to some of the medical officers who  were\r\n\r\nserving  then  because they had too many.  But since  1995,  the\r\n\r\nhospitals have started to encounter shortage and today we have a\r\n\r\nshortage  of  about  90  medical  officers.   With  880  medical\r\n\r\nofficers and a shortage of 90 medical officers it means we  have\r\n\r\na shortfall of about 10%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the shortage appear and what are we doing to\r\n\r\nalleviate the shortage?  Firstly, the number of resignations has\r\n\r\ngone  up.  Secondly, the hospitals have steadily increased their\r\n\r\ndemand  for medical officers for two reasons. Firstly,  improved\r\n\r\nworking conditions, as what Dr Michael Lim has been asking  for.\r\n\r\nSecondly,   expansion   of  some  services.    Thirdly,   higher\r\n\r\nexpectations of patients.  Dr Tan Cheng Bock mentioned that just\r\n\r\nnow.   Yes,  patients  now are more educated and  knowledgeable.\r\n\r\nThey  want  to  be  told what is their medical condition.   They\r\n\r\nrequire  doctors  to  spend more time  explaining  to  them  and\r\n\r\ncommunicating   with  them.  That, of  course,  translates  into\r\n\r\ndemand  for more doctors.  This applies to both medical officers\r\n\r\nand especially specialists.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are some of the measures that we have taken to relieve\r\n\r\nthe medical officer shortage?  The Ministry of Health relied  on\r\n\r\na  survey  taken by the Singapore Medical Association  (SMA)  in\r\n\r\n1996  among  medical officers who had joined the private  sector\r\n\r\nbetween May 1995 and May 1996.  The SMA's findings were,  first,\r\n\r\nthe  key  reason  is that the differential in  income  from  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  is significant. The medical  officers  can  get\r\n\r\nbetween  40-50% more in the private sector.  Secondly,  lack  of\r\n\r\ncareer  opportunities.  Thirdly, frequent night duties.  Medical\r\n\r\nofficers  have to work at night. What happens is that they  will\r\n\r\nwork  the  normal day.  If they are on night duty, they continue\r\n\r\nthroughout  the whole night till the next morning, and  they  go\r\n\r\nback  to  the  normal day shift.  This means that they  actually\r\n\r\nwork about 33 to 36 hours.  This practice, I understand, is very\r\n\r\ncommon.   Dr   Tan Cheng Bock, I am sure, went through  many  of\r\n\r\nthat.   The  same  with Dr Michael Lim.  We  have  adopted  this\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in the past medical officers were required to work\r\n\r\nanything  from eight to more than ten sessions a  month.   Quite\r\n\r\noften,  I  was  told  by the older doctors,  they  worked  every\r\n\r\nalternate  day,  ie,  finish the work today,  work  through  the\r\n\r\nnight,  do a full-day's work the next day, finish work  at  5.00\r\n\r\npm,  go home, come back the next day and repeat this cycle.   It\r\n\r\nis  very tiring.  I feel it is not very fair to the patients  as\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from the review in October 1996, the Ministry\r\n\r\nrevised  the scheme of service for medical officers.  First,  we\r\n\r\nprovided for better and faster career progression.  In the past,\r\n\r\nfor  the full five years, the medical officers were not eligible\r\n\r\nfor  any promotion.  They came in on one grade, stayed there for\r\n\r\nthe  full  five years, and it is no wonder that they  complained\r\n\r\nabout lack of career opportunities.  We have now introduced  two\r\n\r\npromotional  steps into the system.  All medical officers  would\r\n\r\nbe  entitled  to  one  promotion and the better  ones  would  be\r\n\r\neligible  for a second promotion during these five  years  .  We\r\n\r\nalso increased the allowance for night calls.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.20 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the doctors received $40 per night call for\r\n\r\nthe  first four duties and then $100 per night duty after  that.\r\n\r\nWe  increased the allowance very significantly to between  $110-$130 per night call.  This is quite a significant increase.   As\r\n\r\na  result, a medical officer today, with five years of  service,\r\n\r\nwill be able to earn at least $75,000 a year compared to $60,000\r\n\r\na year previously.  This is a 25% increase in salaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also reduced the number of night calls to a maximum\r\n\r\nof  six to seven a month.  So the change is for the better,  but\r\n\r\nthis  also  translates  into  a  significant  increase  in   our\r\n\r\nrequirement  for  medical officers.  Overall, the  changes  have\r\n\r\nbeen  for  the better. The scheme of service is now a  lot  more\r\n\r\nattractive and we are optimistic that it should help reduce  the\r\n\r\nresignation rate in the next couple of years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also taken an additional approach of going abroad\r\n\r\nto  recruit.   As  Members know, we have many  medical  students\r\n\r\nstudying abroad.  Our estimate is that over the next five  years\r\n\r\nwe  will have about 240 students graduating abroad and we  would\r\n\r\nlike  them  to come back.  Late last year, the Ministry  sent  a\r\n\r\ncareer counselling and recruitment team to Australia and UK  and\r\n\r\nthey  managed  to recruit 46 housemen and medical  officers  for\r\n\r\nthis  year.   So  this will help boost up our medical  officers'\r\n\r\nstrength.  What was also encouraging is that the students, after\r\n\r\nattending the talks, felt encouraged and many of them said  that\r\n\r\nthey  would definitely be coming back to  Singapore to  practise\r\n\r\nafter their graduation.  For the coming years, we should be able\r\n\r\nto rectify the situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the second area, the specialists? The\r\n\r\nperception  has been that  the resignation rate of  specialists,\r\n\r\nwhich  means  Registrars and above, is extremely high  from  the\r\n\r\nrestructured hospitals.  This perception is true for  1995.   We\r\n\r\nhad a total of 78 specialists who resigned from the restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals.   This  represents about 8%  of  the  total  pool  of\r\n\r\nspecialists\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  we have.  I asked whether there was any significant factor\r\n\r\nthat  led to this resignation.  My staff tells me that  in  1995\r\n\r\nGleneagles Hospital made available new clinic space and that led\r\n\r\nto  the departure of many of the specialists.  In 1994 and 1996,\r\n\r\nthe  resignation rates were more manageable, about 5%,  compared\r\n\r\nto the training rate of 7-8% of each cohort.  I think there is a\r\n\r\nbalance.   For  this year up to July, the resignation  rate  has\r\n\r\nbeen  2\ufffd%,  which is again lower than the comparable  period  in\r\n\r\n1996.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a good match between the resignations and the\r\n\r\nsupply in most specialties in the public sector. This is because\r\n\r\nwe   have   a  fairly  well-managed  and  well-planned  training\r\n\r\npipeline.   But  shortages do occur from time  to  time  when  a\r\n\r\nparticular  specialist area experiences more resignations.   The\r\n\r\nareas  now  that  are  facing a shortage  would  be  anesthesia,\r\n\r\nradiology and medical oncology.  Because it takes more than  six\r\n\r\nyears  to  train  a specialist, the solution to  these  periodic\r\n\r\nshortages  in specific areas is really to go abroad and  recruit\r\n\r\nqualified  specialists. This is an option that the  restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals are now actively exploring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we need to improve our internal system too. As Dr\r\n\r\nMichael  Lim  has  said, we have to look at  the  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice  and  make  them more attractive.  My  Ministry  is  now\r\n\r\nworking  with HCS and the hospitals to do this.  We are  looking\r\n\r\nat  a  few things.  Dr Michael Lim mentioned about teaching  and\r\n\r\nmedical research.  Yes, we recognise it.  Together with clinical\r\n\r\npractice,  these  are  the  three key pillars  of  institutional\r\n\r\npractice.  We  must recognise the efforts of  doctors  put  into\r\n\r\nteaching  and research, and recognise them in both monetary  and\r\n\r\nnon-monetary  ways.  So overall, we must make the public  sector\r\n\r\nmore  attractive. But while we recognise that the public  sector\r\n\r\npay  can  never  match  the income in the  private  sector,  our\r\n\r\nsalaries should nonetheless be competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the long term manpower situation? Mr Lew Syn\r\n\r\nPau has asked about that. So have Dr Michael Lim and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMr   Bernard   Chen.   Let  me  give  Members  some   background\r\n\r\ninformation.  In 1991, the Health Review Committee  on  National\r\n\r\nHealth Policies recommended that, first, Singapore should attain\r\n\r\na  doctor  population ratio of 1:650 by the  year  2000.   As  a\r\n\r\ncomparison, the doctor to population ratio of the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nin 1993 was 1:650.  So that places us fairly close to the United\r\n\r\nKingdom  with  a  few years' time lag, which is  not  bad.   The\r\n\r\nCommittee also realised that we need to control doctor  manpower\r\n\r\nbecause the experience of all the developed countries has  shown\r\n\r\nthat an excessive supply of doctors only leads to escalation  of\r\n\r\nhealth  care  expenditures.  So it is a lesson  that  we  should\r\n\r\nlearn well and adopt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Projecting from the 1980 census, based on the Health Review\r\n\r\nCommittee's recommendation, we would have about 6,400 doctors in\r\n\r\nthe year 2010, compared to about 4,700 this year.   That will be\r\n\r\nan  increase of about 1,700 over the next 13 years.  In order to\r\n\r\nmeet  this projected manpower, the NUS intake was maintained  at\r\n\r\n150  and  the  Singapore Medical Council reviewed  the  list  of\r\n\r\nrecognised  foreign  universities and reduced  the  list  to  28\r\n\r\nschools in the expectation that they would take in a total of no\r\n\r\nmore  than  40 Singapore students. So 150 Singapore students  in\r\n\r\nNUS  plus  40  from abroad would then leave us  with  more  than\r\n\r\nenough  to achieve the desired doctor strength of 6,400  by  the\r\n\r\nyear 2010.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this year my Ministry reviewed the doctor\r\n\r\nprojections again, because several factors have changed.  Unlike\r\n\r\nwhat  Dr  Michael Lim has said that it was just  a  short  three\r\n\r\nyears  ago, those projections were actually done about 7-8 years\r\n\r\nago.   First,  the 1990 census revealed that our population  was\r\n\r\nlarger than projected from the 1980 census.  That means the base\r\n\r\nwe  are  using to calculate the doctor population based on  that\r\n\r\nratio  was  out by a bit.  Secondly, the Government's effort  to\r\n\r\nattract overseas talents will speed up population growth and the\r\n\r\nrevised higher projected population in the year 2010 would  mean\r\n\r\nthat  the  projected number of elderly sick in the future  years\r\n\r\nwould  also  increase.   The third factor was  regional  demand.\r\n\r\nBecause regional economic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngrowth is expected to remain strong in the coming years, we have\r\n\r\nalso  revised upwards the projected regional demand for  medical\r\n\r\nservices.  This is in line with what Mr Bernard Chen, David  Lim\r\n\r\nand  the rest have talked about in terms of the regional medical\r\n\r\ncentre and medical hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factoring all these changes, MOH revised the desired doctor\r\n\r\npopulation in the year 2010 from 6,400 to 7,100, ie,  all  these\r\n\r\nhave  led  to an increase in the projected demand of  about  700\r\n\r\ndoctors. To achieve this figure, we therefore work with  NUS  to\r\n\r\nincrease the intake this year to 180 and to increase the  intake\r\n\r\nto 200 for next year.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about the list of recognised medical schools? Our\r\n\r\nstudy  shows  that in 1996, just from 11 medical schools,  there\r\n\r\nare two Australian and nine medical schools under the University\r\n\r\nof  London.   These  11  schools  alone  took  in  42  Singapore\r\n\r\nstudents, compared to our projected figure of 40 for the  entire\r\n\r\n28 schools.  We understand that a few Singapore students applied\r\n\r\nfor  the  remaining  17  medical  schools  in  the  US,  UK  and\r\n\r\nAustralia.   But  this  may change in the coming  years  as  the\r\n\r\nparents in Singapore realise that there are other schools  where\r\n\r\nthe  intake has been very low that they will get a better chance\r\n\r\nto be admitted to those schools.  I think more Singapore parents\r\n\r\nwould then encourage their children to enrol there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will therefore continue to monitor and review\r\n\r\nthe situation over the next few years before deciding on whether\r\n\r\nor not to increase the list.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will say that overall, our medical manpower in the\r\n\r\npublic  sector is manageable, although tight in some areas.   We\r\n\r\nhave  steadily increased the staff strength over the  years  and\r\n\r\nwill  continue to do so, especially now that the medical student\r\n\r\nintake has been increased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about nursing manpower, which Mr Bernard Chen asked\r\n\r\nabout?   Here the situation is more acute.  We have a  shortage,\r\n\r\nand  the  shortage is more significant.  There are  today  about\r\n\r\n9,000 nurses in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nboth the public and private sectors.  And the estimated shortage\r\n\r\nis  about  2,200  nurses,  ie,  a 20%  shortfall  from  what  is\r\n\r\nrequired.   The demand for nurses will definitely increase  with\r\n\r\nan  aging  population and the expansion of the medical services.\r\n\r\nWe  must  therefore find more creative and innovative approaches\r\n\r\nto solve this problem in the next few years.  The problem is how\r\n\r\nto  attract  young school leavers to go into nursing, especially\r\n\r\nwhen  there  are  so  many  other  competing  careers  that  are\r\n\r\navailable, and that is only for the intake level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, how do we retain the trained nurses in the public\r\n\r\nsector?   I know Mr Bernard Chen mentioned about nurses  working\r\n\r\nin  the  Middle East.  Yes, we know there are some.  But in  the\r\n\r\ncontext  of  the  9,000 nurses that we have, the  proportion  of\r\n\r\nnurses  working abroad is actually quite small.  It does add  to\r\n\r\nthe shortage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of recruitment, we reached a peak of about 751\r\n\r\nstudent  nurses  in  1989 and we were able to  reach  that  peak\r\n\r\nbecause of the recession in the mid-eighties.  Suddenly,  a  lot\r\n\r\nof  school  leavers felt that it was worth the while going  into\r\n\r\nnursing.   But  immediately after the recessionary effects  wore\r\n\r\noff,  the following year 1990/1991, the intake dropped  by  more\r\n\r\nthan half, an average of 330.  751 in one year, next year it was\r\n\r\n330.   Our  target  was  900  -  a tremendous  shortfall.   But,\r\n\r\nfortunately, we have already recognised that it was going to  be\r\n\r\nmore  difficult  attracting students and we had to  increasingly\r\n\r\nmake the nursing profession more attractive and competitive.  As\r\n\r\na  result, we were able to persuade the Ministry of Education to\r\n\r\nstart  a  Nursing  Diploma course in one  of  the  polytechnics.\r\n\r\nPrior  to  that, nursing was only a certificate  course  in  the\r\n\r\nSchool of Nursing.  So this represents tremendous enhancement of\r\n\r\nthe  professional  status.  The Nanyang  Polytechnic  started  a\r\n\r\ncourse  in 1992 and I am happy to report that this has  resulted\r\n\r\nin  the  increase in the number of applicants.  Last  year,  the\r\n\r\nDiploma  course managed to attract 590 applicants,  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand  non-Singaporeans, compared to about 250  when  we  had  the\r\n\r\nSchool of Nursing course.  So it has proven to be attractive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are strengthening our efforts to also recruit foreign\r\n\r\nnursing  students,  which is a better approach  than  trying  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  trained nurses.  Because if the students come here  and\r\n\r\nstudy  in the polytechnic, after three years, I think they  will\r\n\r\nhave   become  more  acclimatised  to  the  local  demands   and\r\n\r\npractices.   But, nonetheless, I think we should  not  rule  out\r\n\r\nrecruitment  of  trained  nurses  from  abroad.   With  such   a\r\n\r\nsignificant shortage, even if they are not fully acquainted with\r\n\r\nour  system,  I  think  they can still contribute.   So  let  us\r\n\r\nappreciate  them for their contributions that they  are  making.\r\n\r\nAt  the same time, my Ministry will be looking into how to  make\r\n\r\nthe  nursing  career even more attractive and  challenging.   We\r\n\r\nwill  be  carrying out a comprehensive review of the service  in\r\n\r\nthe next few months and we hope that arising from this study, we\r\n\r\nwill be able to once again further improve on the attractiveness\r\n\r\nof the profession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the next cut which is from Mr\r\n\r\nBernard  Chen  on the professional standard of doctors.   He  is\r\n\r\nworried that the recent publicity of complaints to the SMC  (the\r\n\r\nSingapore Medical Council) may indicate that things are not  all\r\n\r\nthat  well in the medical profession, even though generally  the\r\n\r\nstandard of the medical profession in Singapore is very high.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  point is correct that the standard of the profession\r\n\r\nin Singapore is high.  Every year, the Singapore Medical Council\r\n\r\nreceives  between 40 and 60 complaints.  I think  the  range  is\r\n\r\nreasonable and the numbers are not too bad, considering that  we\r\n\r\nhave  about  4,700  doctors in Singapore.  In every  profession,\r\n\r\nthere will be a few black sheep.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been focusing on ensuring that our doctors are\r\n\r\ncompetent  and  capable.  However, it is equally  important  for\r\n\r\ndoctors  to maintain and uphold professional conduct  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  patients  are  given the appropriate care  and  treatment.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the teaching of medical ethics forms an  important\r\n\r\npart  of  the medical curriculum.  In recent years, the SMC  has\r\n\r\nalso  introduced a physician's pledge to increase the  awareness\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommitment  of  doctors  to  the  vocation.   We  will  also  be\r\n\r\nintroducing   lay   representation  in  the   disciplinary   and\r\n\r\ncomplaints  committees, as mentioned by Mr Chen.  He  has  asked\r\n\r\nwhat else can we do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MOH also carries out medical audits on various\r\n\r\nprocedures  and treatments to identify areas which  need  to  be\r\n\r\nimproved  or  to  deter  poor  medical  practice.   This  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant element and we are in the process of strengthening our\r\n\r\naudit  capabilities.  With all these, I think we should be  able\r\n\r\nto  maintain the professionalism in the profession, despite  the\r\n\r\nmany competing demands on the time of the doctors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the next cut which is by Mr Goh\r\n\r\nChoon  Kang on the impact of the cost of furniture and equipment\r\n\r\non  patients.  It is prudent and sound to take into account  all\r\n\r\noperating  costs of providing a service.  This way we will  know\r\n\r\nwhat  the true costs are, which are the areas which are  out  of\r\n\r\nline,  which  are major cost elements and how do we bring  about\r\n\r\nproductivity improvements and cost savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs of furniture and equipment (F&E) are part of the\r\n\r\nhospital's  operating cost, just are the salaries of nurses  and\r\n\r\ndoctors.  In the case of furniture and equipment, they  make  up\r\n\r\n5%  of total recurrent cost.  But while we account fully for the\r\n\r\nF&E  cost,  most  patients do not bear the full  amount  of  the\r\n\r\ncost.   This  is  because patients in B1 get a subsidy  of  20%.\r\n\r\nThose  in  B2  get  65% subsidy and those in  class  C  get  80%\r\n\r\nsubsidy.   That means the Government bears 80% of the  costs  of\r\n\r\nthe  furniture and equipment for the class C patients.  So  much\r\n\r\nof  what  Mr  Goh  is  asking for, I  think,  is  already  being\r\n\r\nprovided by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim talked about medical specialisation, that\r\n\r\nincreasing  specialisation may actually lead to  increased  cost\r\n\r\nand  he  also commented about the practice conventions  in  SGH.\r\n\r\nSir,  as  medical  science and technology  continue  to  develop\r\n\r\nrapidly, I think it is inevitable for doctors to specialise  and\r\n\r\nsub-specialise  even more.  I think Dr Michael  Lim  will  fully\r\n\r\nappreciate that, being a specialist himself.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: how do we ensure that patients get the\r\n\r\nbest   care  possible  at  the  best  value?   He  is   correct.\r\n\r\nSpecialist services, if used indiscriminately, will lead  to  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in health care cost.  So how do you balance  the  two?\r\n\r\nSir,  rather than just focus on SGH, I think the problem is  not\r\n\r\njust  SGH's  alone,  the problem exists in  all  the  hospitals,\r\n\r\nwhether they are private or public.  In fact, I have heard  many\r\n\r\nhorror stories of patients going to the private sector who  were\r\n\r\ngiven   a  go-around  and  ended  up,  instead  of  seeing   one\r\n\r\nspecialist, seeing four or five specialists.  So the problem  is\r\n\r\nequally  prevalent in the private sector.  And it  is  not  just\r\n\r\nrestricted  to  the  specialist area.  It also  applies  to  the\r\n\r\nwhole medical service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is well recognised that a person with a medical\r\n\r\ncondition should first consult a generalist doctor, rather  than\r\n\r\nself-referring to a specialist.  Especially if he  has  multiple\r\n\r\nmedical conditions, the generalist doctor would then be  in  the\r\n\r\nbest  position  to decide whether that patient needs  to  see  a\r\n\r\nspecialist  and,  if so, which specialist.   In  some  developed\r\n\r\ncountries,  their  health insurance systems and  their  national\r\n\r\nhealth   plans  require  patients  to  first  consult  a  family\r\n\r\npractitioner or GP.  In Singapore we do not do this, we  do  not\r\n\r\nregulate  this,  and  many patients self-refer  to  specialists.\r\n\r\nThis,  of  course,  then  makes  it  more  expensive  for   him,\r\n\r\nespecially  when the GP could have looked after him  and  solved\r\n\r\nhis medical problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the hospital level similarly, the general physician\r\n\r\nshould   be   in  charge  of  patients  with  multiple   medical\r\n\r\nconditions.   And this would mean that even if the  patient  had\r\n\r\nself-referred  or had been referred to a specialist  or  a  sub-specialist,  and the sub-specialist found that he  had  multiple\r\n\r\nproblems, the sub-specialist should actually make it a point  to\r\n\r\nrefer  him  to a general physician in the hospital, rather  than\r\n\r\nto send him to a whole series of specialists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Because of the time element, please let\r\n\r\nme  finish the reply first.

We  are\r\n\r\nalso  looking  into  training more general  physicians  so  that\r\n\r\nthere   will  be  adequate  general  physicians  to  look  after\r\n\r\npatients with multiple medical conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the challenge is therefore a real one and we will need\r\n\r\nthe  cooperation and understanding of both patients and doctors,\r\n\r\nand doctors in both the private and public sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the regional medical hub which three\r\n\r\nMembers  have  spoken on.  I will go through very quickly,  Sir.\r\n\r\nYes,  our  medical standards in Singapore are  very  high.   And\r\n\r\nover  the years, because of this high standard, we have  evolved\r\n\r\ninto  a  regional  medical centre.  Doctors in the  region  feel\r\n\r\ncomfortable referring their patients here and even patients  are\r\n\r\nself-referring  themselves  to specialists  here  by  consulting\r\n\r\nspecialists  whom  they hear about through word  of  mouth  from\r\n\r\nfriends  and relatives.  So the question is: what are  we  doing\r\n\r\nto further strengthen our position?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst we are today a regional centre, we cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to  be  complacent,  as  Mr  David  Lim  has  mentioned.\r\n\r\nCountries  in  the  region  are also  developing  their  medical\r\n\r\nexpertise.  In the Ministry's view, to maintain our position  as\r\n\r\na  regional  medical centre, we have to ensure that our  medical\r\n\r\nsoftware  remains  a few steps ahead of others.   Why  software?\r\n\r\nThis is because with adequate finances, anyone can build a model\r\n\r\nhospital, and the technology and equipment can also be  just  as\r\n\r\neasily  purchased.  But to be a medical centre of high standards\r\n\r\nand  standing, the skills, the expertise of the doctors, nurses,\r\n\r\nscientists,  technologists, therapists, managers  must  be  top-notch.   And  not  only  that, they must be  able  to  tie  them\r\n\r\naltogether into an efficient system.  This we have.  We are also\r\n\r\ntaking  steps  to position ourselves for the next phase  of  our\r\n\r\nmedical  development.   This involves the  development  of  five\r\n\r\nnational medical centres.  The National Skin and Eye Centres are\r\n\r\nready.  We are now in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprocess  of building the National Heart and Cancer Centres,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Neuroscience Institute.  These centres will  spearhead  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  clinical service, teaching and  research.   The\r\n\r\nconcept  is  that the more complex or rarer cases requiring  the\r\n\r\nexpensive  equipment or highly specialised expertise  or  multi-disciplinary  treatment will be centralised  at  these  national\r\n\r\ncentres.   The national centres will also be open to specialists\r\n\r\nin  other  Government hospitals as well as those in the  private\r\n\r\nsector.   So  there  is  no  need for any  of  the  restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals to be worried because they will all be part and parcel\r\n\r\nof this development programme.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are also looking into the development of a medical\r\n\r\nservices  park in the grounds of the Singapore General Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe  aim  is  to  attract entities in a comprehensive  range  of\r\n\r\nhealth   care  and  other  supporting  activities  to  co-locate\r\n\r\nthemselves in this park.  This way there will be synergy derived\r\n\r\nfrom   the   resultant  wide  spectrum  of  medical  facilities,\r\n\r\nexpertise  and  activities.  This will,  as  Mr  David  Lim  has\r\n\r\nmentioned,  definitely help to raise our standards  and  improve\r\n\r\nour  competitiveness in the health sector.   The  benefits  will\r\n\r\naccrue to Singapore patients and of course regional patients can\r\n\r\nalso  take  advantage  of  the  services  there,  if  they   are\r\n\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim also asked what is the role of MOH in\r\n\r\nhelping  the  private sector expand overseas.  Sir, MOH  focuses\r\n\r\nmainly on looking after the health care needs of Singaporeans in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  Economic Development Board is  the  Government\r\n\r\nagency  that helps to facilitate the regionalisation efforts  of\r\n\r\nour private sector, including the health care sector.  This will\r\n\r\ninclude investments in regional health care projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Bernard Chen asked what incentives we are giving to help\r\n\r\nthe  private  medical sector further develop.  Sir, the  private\r\n\r\nsector has grown very very strongly throughout the years without\r\n\r\nany Govern\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nment  assistance or incentives.  I think they have been  growing\r\n\r\nfast enough and we should not over accelerate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock asked for an update on the restructured\r\n\r\nprogramme.  Sir, he raised so many questions that I lost  count.\r\n\r\nI  stopped  at  20, and to reply to him, I think I need  another\r\n\r\nhour.   I  do not have that time.  So I would just very  quickly\r\n\r\nsummarise  our experience.  Basically, when we restructured  the\r\n\r\nhospitals,  we have four key objectives, ie, to enable  them  to\r\n\r\nimprove    efficiency   and   standard   of   service,   improve\r\n\r\nproductivity, control hospital costs and allow them  to  develop\r\n\r\nand respond quickly to changes in the marketplace and to patient\r\n\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to say that in all these four areas, the\r\n\r\nrestructured hospitals have done well.  They have been  able  to\r\n\r\nincrease   the   throughput  significantly  without   having   a\r\n\r\nproportionate increase in their manpower. Let me give  you  some\r\n\r\nfigures.  For specialist outpatient attendances between 1988 and\r\n\r\n1996,  the  workload increased by 65%.  In terms of day  surgery\r\n\r\nprocedures,  during those eight years, they increased  by  145%.\r\n\r\nThe  survey  of  patients' responses  showed  that  85%  of  the\r\n\r\npatients rated the services provided by the hospitals as  either\r\n\r\ngood  or  excellent.  This is an improvement from  the  previous\r\n\r\nfigures.  Another area which is very evident is the missing case\r\n\r\nnotes.   I  think  Dr Tan and Dr Michael Lim would  be  familiar\r\n\r\nthat,  in the past, at the Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOCs),\r\n\r\nit  was  not  unusual for patients who turned up and found  that\r\n\r\ntheir case notes were missing.  In fact, in 1986, between 3% and\r\n\r\n17%  of  patients ended up with missing case notes.   It  was  a\r\n\r\nterrible  position.  Today, the numbers in each of the hospitals\r\n\r\ntotal  less than 10 cases a month. Compared to the huge patient-load,  this  works  out to about 0.01%.  So it  shows  that  the\r\n\r\nhospitals  have managed to get their act together,  improve  the\r\n\r\nsystem and make sure that patients' needs are well looked after.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about coordinating the purchase of expensive\r\n\r\nequipment  in public hospitals.  At MOH level, we do monitor  to\r\n\r\nmake sure that the equipment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npurchased are not unnecessarily duplicated, leading to  wastage.\r\n\r\nBut  basically,  the decision to purchase a piece  of  equipment\r\n\r\nlies  with  the Board of each hospital and they will  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  there  is a real need for the equipment because  it  costs\r\n\r\nmoney.  Secondly, they cannot get a replacement service from any\r\n\r\nother  hospital.   I  think the situation  is  very  much  under\r\n\r\ncontrol.   On  the development of sub-specialties,  yes,  we  do\r\n\r\ncoordinate that from the HQ level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan spoke for a long time on the listing of hospitals on\r\n\r\nthe  stock market. Government has no plans at the moment  to  do\r\n\r\nany   of   that.    The  restructured  hospitals   will   remain\r\n\r\nrestructured.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now go quickly to the question of A&E which Mr\r\n\r\nChoo  Wee Khiang also spoke quite extensively on.  Sir, I  share\r\n\r\nhis sentiments.  I too am not very happy with the problems being\r\n\r\nencountered in A&E.  And if you look at the situation,  it  will\r\n\r\nexplain  why.  Between 1992 and 1994, A&E attendances went  down\r\n\r\nslightly.  This is because, in 1992, we embarked on an intensive\r\n\r\neducation  programme on the proper use of A&E.  So  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwere  more aware.  They realised what is the true role  of  A&E.\r\n\r\nIn  1993, we also did something which I think contributed to the\r\n\r\ndecline.   We  increased the fees quite significantly  and  made\r\n\r\nsure  that A&E fees were much higher than the GP fees.  So there\r\n\r\nwas a cost of going to A&E instead of going to the GP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last two years, 1995-1996, A&E attendances went\r\n\r\nup very significantly.  They went up by over 10% a year and this\r\n\r\nhas led to a tremendous strain on the facilities.  The hospitals\r\n\r\nhave added more staff.  In fact, the hospitals have, in the last\r\n\r\ntwo  years,  added 22 more doctors, which is equivalent  to  25%\r\n\r\nincrease in the doctor staffing and they added 15% more  nurses.\r\n\r\nBut,  unfortunately, each time, they improved  the  service,  it\r\n\r\nonly led to an increase in demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review showed that a significant number of A&E patients\r\n\r\nactually  had relatively minor illness, such as fever, low-grade\r\n\r\nfever, cough and cold, diarrhoea and superficial cuts.  What  is\r\n\r\nalso telling\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis that 60% of all A&E attendances are between the hours of 9.00\r\n\r\nam and 9.00 pm when GPs are available and, during the day hours,\r\n\r\npolyclinics  are  available too, and many of these  cases  could\r\n\r\nactually be seen by GPs and polyclinics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to discourage this tendency of many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans using the A&E because we have finite A&E  resources\r\n\r\nand  A&E  clinics are meant to take care of serious  conditions.\r\n\r\nBy  clogging up A&E clinics with non-emergency cases, those non-emergency  patients are actually endangering the  lives  of  the\r\n\r\ntrue emergency cases because doctors, being over-worked, may not\r\n\r\nbe  able  to give enough time and care to those who are  genuine\r\n\r\nemergency cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked the hospitals to review how A&E services can\r\n\r\nbe  more  appropriately managed.  We need  to  discourage  those\r\n\r\npatients who can be seen by GPs and polyclinics from making  use\r\n\r\nof  our  A&E facilities.  The review will include reviewing  how\r\n\r\nthe  existing A&E fees could be revised in such a way as not  to\r\n\r\nunduly  penalise the genuine cases.  I expect the  hospitals  to\r\n\r\ncome out with a package within the next two months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On tobacco licensing, Mr Choo Wee Khiang is absolutely\r\n\r\ncorrect.   The smoking rate among our youths is bad.  They  have\r\n\r\ngone up very significantly in the last 10-odd years.  We have  a\r\n\r\nban  on smoking and the sale of cigarettes to our youths.   But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, it is difficult to detect shops that are selling.\r\n\r\nThe  Committee on Smoking Control has also recommended that  MOH\r\n\r\nlicense  tobacco retailers and we have decided to do  that.   We\r\n\r\nexpect  to  implement this in June 1998 and are now working  out\r\n\r\nthe details.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will ask my Senior Minister of State to reply to the\r\n\r\nother questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wong, you have got four minutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Senior Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline K. Wong):</b> Sir, since I do not have much time, I would just concentrate on\r\n\r\nseveral things that I would like to clarify for Members  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse who spoke on the remaining subjects.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Goh Choon Kang expressed\r\n\r\nconcern  about  the level of funding that we give  to  the  VWOs\r\n\r\nwhich are doing very important work in providing community-based\r\n\r\nhealth  services, especially to our elderly.  I like to  clarify\r\n\r\nthat  the  50:50  funding formula for the recurrent  expenditure\r\n\r\nactually  applies  to  all  VWOs, whether  they  provide  social\r\n\r\nservices under the Ministry of Community Development or  health-related services under the Ministry of Health.  Both Mr Goh  and\r\n\r\nMr Yeo are correct in saying that Government provides 90% of the\r\n\r\ncapital expenditure.  But I would like to point out that,  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  these two levels of funding, the Government helps the VWOs\r\n\r\nin  many  other ways.  For example, we facilitate the allocation\r\n\r\nof State land and premises and we fund up to 90% of the cyclical\r\n\r\nmaintenance cost for existing buildings.  We also provide up  to\r\n\r\n100%  of  rental subsidy for the use of Government buildings  or\r\n\r\nState land and we provide 100% rebate, for input GST.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of that, we second doctors and nurses to work in\r\n\r\nsome VWO facilities, and we facilitate the allocation of foreign\r\n\r\nworkers'  permits.  The foreign workers levy is actually  waived\r\n\r\nfor  the  VWOs.   Even the COEs for vehicles used  in  providing\r\n\r\nservices by these VWOs are exempted.  So these are various  ways\r\n\r\nin  which we help them.  For the financial year 1997, our budget\r\n\r\nfor  the VWOs has actually doubled, twice what we provided  last\r\n\r\nyear.   We projected for the next two years that there would  be\r\n\r\nan  increase  of  $4  million every year in terms  of  recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure subsidies alone.  I do understand that the VWOs  are\r\n\r\nfinding  it  quite  strenuous  to raise  funds  while  providing\r\n\r\nservices.  The funding formula is one of the areas that will  be\r\n\r\nvery carefully looked into by the Inter-Ministerial Committee on\r\n\r\nHealth  Care  for  the Elderly which would  be  chaired  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health himself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have time to update both Mr Peh Chin Hua and Mr\r\n\r\nGoh Choon Kang\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  the state of TCM and what we have done so far.  I hope  they\r\n\r\nwill understand.  We will find another occasion to inform them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I cannot let pass Mr Peh Chin Hua's very interesting\r\n\r\nspeech  on human cloning, so allow me two minutes to respond  to\r\n\r\nthat.   I must say that I am a little bit surprised at the range\r\n\r\nof  interest  that Mr Peh has, and the recurrent  image  of  the\r\n\r\nsheep  in  this year's debate.  Cloning means the production  of\r\n\r\ngenetically  identical  replicas which, in  the  broader  sense,\r\n\r\nincludes  the replication of DNA, cells, embryos and  the  whole\r\n\r\norganism.  I would like to inform Mr Peh from the very beginning\r\n\r\nthat  there are different levels of cloning.  I understand  that\r\n\r\nscientific  breakthroughs occur from time to time and  this  may\r\n\r\nrepresent spurts of human creativity.  Some of these discoveries\r\n\r\ncan  do  good. But some of them could be harmful and,  in  fact,\r\n\r\ninvolve  very difficult ethical dilemmas.  We agree  that  there\r\n\r\nshould  not  be a total ban on cloning research,  as  there  are\r\n\r\ncertain areas which could have beneficial results.  In fact,  we\r\n\r\nhave  supported research involving the replication  of  DNA  and\r\n\r\ncells  of  both animal and human origin, which are  now  routine\r\n\r\nresearch  techniques  in  molecular  and  cell  biology.    Such\r\n\r\nresearch,  as  I said, could have potential beneficial  results,\r\n\r\nsuch as in the treatment of certain diseases like cancer or  the\r\n\r\ngeneration of organs for transplantation.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my Ministry is of the view that the production of\r\n\r\nidentical copies of existing human beings is unacceptable.   The\r\n\r\nreasons  for  this stand are many, and these reasons  have  been\r\n\r\ndebated  by  the international community as well as by  our  own\r\n\r\nnational  Medical Ethics Committee.  The reasons include:  there\r\n\r\nwould  be  an imposition of biological characteristics on  human\r\n\r\nindividuals  by  third parties.  Human beings  may  one  day  be\r\n\r\nvalued  and  reproduced  for certain desirable  characteristics,\r\n\r\nrather  than  as persons.  You can also stretch your imagination\r\n\r\nthat  one day there could be commercialisation of human cloning,\r\n\r\nembryos    being   sold   to   potential   so-called    parents.\r\n\r\nIntrinsically,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere are concerns about the health of the child which would  be\r\n\r\ncloned,  as  well  as the loss of genetic diversity  and  hybrid\r\n\r\nvigour  in the population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh came up with a very interesting theory about how\r\n\r\nhuman  society is organised.  He said that our moral values  and\r\n\r\nsocial relationships are man made.  To a certain extent,  it  is\r\n\r\ntrue.   However,  when  you  look at human  civilisation,  human\r\n\r\nreproduction is a very basic fact and a driving force of life on\r\n\r\nthis  earth.  The relationships between man and woman and  their\r\n\r\noffspring from the act of reproduction, ie, the family, actually\r\n\r\nforms  the basis for the organisation of society.  Besides that,\r\n\r\nthere is the question of generations.  Generational hierarchy is\r\n\r\nalso  a universal principle of organising human society.  Unless\r\n\r\nyou  want to have a brave new world imagined by science  fiction\r\n\r\nwriters  such as Aldous Huxley, which makes me shudder, I  think\r\n\r\nwe  better  not  tangle with this.  There  are  certain  ethical\r\n\r\nlimits that we must abide by.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, my Ministry has adopted the position that there\r\n\r\nshould be a total prohibition on the creation of human babies by\r\n\r\ncloning technology.  This is also in line with the stand adopted\r\n\r\nby  the  World  Health Organisation in its  recent  Assembly  in\r\n\r\nGeneva  in May this year.  The Assembly has adopted a resolution\r\n\r\naffirming that the use of cloning for the replication  of  human\r\n\r\nindividuals  is  ethically unacceptable, and contrary  to  human\r\n\r\nintegrity  and morality.  This is our stand and  if  Mr  Peh  is\r\n\r\ninterested  in  reading the WHO document, I will be  pleased  to\r\n\r\nsend it to him.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is no time to clarify.

The Senior Minister of State  has\r\n\r\ngiven  an  answer to Mr Goh and Mr Yeo.  The Senior Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  has not given a definite answer as to what percentage  of\r\n\r\nfunding  as  regards the operating or recurrent expenditures  of\r\n\r\nVWOs.   Presently,  it  is  50%.   Could  the  Ministry  perhaps\r\n\r\nconsider  giving  a  higher grant,  say,  up  to  90%  of  their\r\n\r\nrecurrent  or operating expenditure?  I think many of  the  VWOs\r\n\r\nare facing problems in raising funds and most of their free time\r\n\r\nis being spent on raising funds, which I think is at the expense\r\n\r\nof caring for the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also need to ask the Senior Minister of State when will\r\n\r\nthe  Inter-Ministry Committee on Health Care for the Elderly  be\r\n\r\nformed,  how long will it take, and what is the time frame?   If\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry cannot give a 90% grant for recurrent expenditure,\r\n\r\nwould they have a graduated scale?  That means if there is a VWO-run  hospital, it could be given 90%.  If they take  care  of  a\r\n\r\nnursing  home,  maybe 80%.  And, of course,  for  ordinary  VWOs\r\n\r\nrunning  a  day-care centre, 60%.  I think this will  help  them\r\n\r\ntremendously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I also ask what other measures the Government is taking\r\n\r\nto  assist  VWOs  to provide health care for the elderly,  apart\r\n\r\nfrom financial assistance?  What about manpower, expertise, etc?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, may I take all my\r\n\r\nthree amendments together?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the most effective way to the care of our\r\n\r\nelderly follows the dictum \"prevention is better than cure\".  In\r\n\r\nview  of  the increasing numbers of our elderly to about 850,000\r\n\r\nover  the  next  30  years, preventive care should  be  promoted\r\n\r\nisland-wide  on a big scale and soon.  Let it be made  available\r\n\r\nto our elderly while they are still well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are quite a number of preventive care concepts or\r\n\r\nmodels.  I have started a model in Kim Seng which is based on  a\r\n\r\n\"total  care\" concept of looking after the physical, mental  and\r\n\r\nsocial  well-being of the elderly.  By paying a  reasonable  and\r\n\r\naffordable  fee,  the  participants sign up  at  this  precinct-located  Centre of Activity for Retired and Elderly  (CARE)  for\r\n\r\ntheir   daily  exercises,  wholesome  daily  meals  and   social\r\n\r\nactivities  such as singing, dancing and picnic  outings.   They\r\n\r\nget to interact and befriend each other and, hopefully, they can\r\n\r\nbe  concerned  for  and be helpful to each other  as  \"buddies\".\r\n\r\nThey   will  attend  health  education  talks  and  have  health\r\n\r\nscreening tests which are to be conducted yearly for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am convinced that the way to go is to have more of\r\n\r\nsuch   CARE.    They  can  be  run  by  grassroots  groups   and\r\n\r\norganisations from the community.  They do not cost much to run,\r\n\r\nbut  they do need support.  Sir, by spending time and effort and\r\n\r\nmoney  on preventive care now could save us dollars up the  road\r\n\r\nin a big way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would really like to see the involvement of MOH, MCD and\r\n\r\nCDCs in supporting such centres.  At the moment, several private\r\n\r\nvolunteer doctors are providing some of the services.  But MOH's\r\n\r\ninvolvement  would  enhance  and maintain  the  fast  increasing\r\n\r\ndemands.   Could MOH support these types of centres,  especially\r\n\r\nin  terms of back-up medical screening tests and regular  health\r\n\r\ntalks?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next topic is on the setting up of more geriatric\r\n\r\nhospitals.   The sick elderly are best catered for in  geriatric\r\n\r\ndepartments  or  geriatric  hospitals  where  a  more   holistic\r\n\r\napproach towards better care becomes possible.  The elderly  are\r\n\r\noften  afflicted with multiple illnesses, and when they go  from\r\n\r\none  specialty to another, they are often subjected to  multiple\r\n\r\ndiagnostic tests.  They may be over investigated or over treated\r\n\r\nfor  conditions that are in fact due to the normal processes  of\r\n\r\nageing, which in isolation and in an acute hospital or emergency\r\n\r\nsituations can complicate diagnosis and treatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWell-run  geriatric  departments can  prevent  such  unnecessary\r\n\r\ninconvenience and waste of resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Neo, you are using the words \"elderly\" and\r\n\r\n\"geriatrics\" interchangeably.

My question is that I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe Ministry whether, apart from those geriatric departments  in\r\n\r\nAlexandra  Hospital,  Tan  Tock Seng  Hospital  and  New  Changi\r\n\r\nHospital,  will  new  ones be established  in  the  other  acute\r\n\r\ngeneral hospitals in the near future?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my last topic is on geriatric training and services.\r\n\r\nThere is a shortage of geriatric care providers even as of  now.\r\n\r\nBy  the  year  2030, it is likely that almost one-third  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation  will  be  considered  elderly.   In  view   of   the\r\n\r\nincreasing  trend  in the population of our aged,  we  certainly\r\n\r\nhave  an  urgent  need to increase our pool of  people  who  are\r\n\r\ninterested  in  gerontology and trained in geriatric  care.   We\r\n\r\nwill  need  more  geriatric specialists, trained  geriatric-care\r\n\r\nnurses, physiotherapists, speech therapists and so on.  This has\r\n\r\nto  be  looked into now if we are to aim at providing  the  most\r\n\r\neffective and best care for the elderly in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Ministry whether there are already\r\n\r\nplans  in  place  for  the  training of  people  to  solve  this\r\n\r\nshortage.  Time is needed for training people, just as  time  is\r\n\r\nalso  needed  for comprehensive planning of the services.   This\r\n\r\nhas to be an on-going process started from now to have the basic\r\n\r\nresources in steady-state.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unless we have these core service-providers, we cannot\r\n\r\nmake  any  substantial  progress in the  care  of  our  elderly,\r\n\r\nespecially when it comes to looking after the dependent elderly,\r\n\r\nthe lack of core service providers will be our stumbling block.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geriatrics, as a specialty, is not a popular career\r\n\r\npursuit among doctors.  This trend needs to be addressed.   Will\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  be seeking ways to entice more young  doctors  to\r\n\r\ntrain in this particular specialty?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Sir, Mr Ibrahim Othman asked for some\r\n\r\nclarification on what other\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nforms  of help the Ministry of Health can give to the  VWOs.   I\r\n\r\nhave indicated that where there is a need and request within our\r\n\r\nresources, we could second some medical officers and so  on,  as\r\n\r\nwe have done to community hospitals.  We could help in training,\r\n\r\nsay,  the nursing aides.  In fact, I understand that the College\r\n\r\nof  Family  Physicians is thinking of organising such a  course.\r\n\r\nThere are many other ways that we could come in and help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for financial support, the 50:50 recurrent expenditure\r\n\r\nsubsidy,  as  I explained, is now a formula used  for  all  VWOs\r\n\r\nwhether they are under the Ministry of Community Development  or\r\n\r\nunder the Ministry of Health.  But I think the Inter-Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee  will  look into suggestions such as his,  whether  we\r\n\r\ncould  graduate the subsidy to VWOs offering different kinds  of\r\n\r\nservices. In fact, we are already in the process of costing  the\r\n\r\nservices, each particular type of service, so that we  can  help\r\n\r\nto fund the VWOs better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has just been formed. We will start meeting\r\n\r\nin  August.  Most probably, we will finish our deliberations  by\r\n\r\nthe end of this year or early next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo talked about preventive health care for the\r\n\r\nelderly, especially in the community setting.  I agree with  her\r\n\r\nthat  the  ideal place where the elderly can be cared for  after\r\n\r\ndischarge from hospital, or to help them stay in good health  so\r\n\r\nthat they do not fall sick and become hospitalised, would be the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   Therefore, I think we should welcome projects  such\r\n\r\nas  hers  in Kim Seng where she would gather a group of  elderly\r\n\r\npeople,   provide   them   with  healthy   social   recreational\r\n\r\nopportunities, exercise, give them meals and so on.   This  type\r\n\r\nof  groups  can play a very important role in preventive  health\r\n\r\ncare for the elderly.  If in future Dr Neo thinks that there  is\r\n\r\nsomething that the Ministry of Health can do together with  her,\r\n\r\nor  together with the Community Development Council under  which\r\n\r\nher  constituency falls, by all means please approach us and  we\r\n\r\nwill talk about the details.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to explain to her that the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nhas been doing quite\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  lot  of  health  promotion and disease prevention  among  the\r\n\r\nelderly.   First  of all, we have been promoting healthy  living\r\n\r\nfor everybody, including the elderly.  We have been carrying out\r\n\r\nextensive health education promotions within community  centres,\r\n\r\nin  schools  and  so  on.  We also provide a  very  good  health\r\n\r\nscreening service at our polyclinics and at our senior citizens'\r\n\r\nhealth care centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventive care for the elderly would be one other area\r\n\r\nthat the Inter-Ministerial Committee will look at and see how we\r\n\r\ncan strengthen it.  We would most certainly increase our efforts\r\n\r\nin  health  education  and  health promotion.   One  preliminary\r\n\r\nthinking we have is that we could develop a protocol for  health\r\n\r\nscreening  for  the  elderly to be given  to  the  GPs  and  the\r\n\r\npolyclinics.  Health screening for the elderly is  a  very  time\r\n\r\nconsuming  exercise. We want to simplify  it,  but  to  make  it\r\n\r\nadequate  so  that  even  general  practitioners  will  find  it\r\n\r\npossible to do health screening for the elderly.  That would  be\r\n\r\none  approach  to  improving  preventive  health  care  for  the\r\n\r\nelderly.\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for geriatric services and training, and also geriatric\r\n\r\nhospitals, we have already got three geriatric departments,  one\r\n\r\neach at the so-called regional hospitals.  They are at Alexandra\r\n\r\nHospital,  Tan  Tock Seng Hospital and also at  the  new  Changi\r\n\r\nHospital.   These geriatric departments will form  the  node  in\r\n\r\neach  region  for the networking of the community  based  health\r\n\r\ncare services so that the care of the elderly could pass through\r\n\r\na  seamless  web.  But we must not just think of increasing  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  geriatricians or increasing the number of  geriatric\r\n\r\ndepartments  in  hospitals as the specialised services  for  the\r\n\r\nelderly.   These departments are for the management of  multiple\r\n\r\ncomplicated problems of the elderly.  For other conditions,  the\r\n\r\ngeneral medicine department, orthopaedic  department, cardiology\r\n\r\ndepartment, and the general wards can take care of the  elderly.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  the  majority of the elderly can be taken  care  of  in\r\n\r\nthese   general  departments.   So  geriatric  departments   and\r\n\r\ngeriatric care are a very specialised branch\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  is not meant to cater to everybody.  It is meant to  cater\r\n\r\nonly  to  complicated multiple problems.  I would also  like  to\r\n\r\nstress  that  the care for the elderly is the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nall the doctors, including the general practitioners, as well as\r\n\r\nthe  family and the community.  In fact, our emphasis should  be\r\n\r\non  community based services rather than developing too fast  or\r\n\r\ntoo many of these geriatric centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geriatrics is a relatively new field in Singapore. So far,\r\n\r\nwe  have  trained  13  geriatricians and  another  five  are  in\r\n\r\ntraining.   It is estimated that ideally we require  24  by  the\r\n\r\nyear  2000.  We will work towards it and encourage more  doctors\r\n\r\nto  take  it up.  But it is a very challenging task to  interest\r\n\r\nyoung  doctors  to  do  geriatrics.  For one  thing  it  is  not\r\n\r\nconsidered to be glamorous enough but we will try to reverse the\r\n\r\nimage.   We  are  also  providing  a  post-graduate  diploma  in\r\n\r\ngeriatric  medicine as well as training nurses  in  gerontology.\r\n\r\nAs  I said, we should not just look at geriatrics as a field for\r\n\r\nthe elderly and this is the only way forward.  No, I think it is\r\n\r\na  broad based strategy and every general practitioner and every\r\n\r\ncommunity  would have to share the responsibility of giving  the\r\n\r\nbest health care to the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman:</b> I thank the Senior Minister for\r\n\r\nState for her explanation and beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code PE 1500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister a question in regard to the\r\n\r\nincrease   in  the  number  of  attendance  at  the   outpatient\r\n\r\npolyclinics  and whether there will be a corresponding  increase\r\n\r\nin  the number of doctors treating them.

You have just heard the Minister who said  that  over\r\n\r\nthe   last   10  years  the  number  of  doctors  has  increased\r\n\r\nsignificantly.  This has made it possible for the  patient  load\r\n\r\nat  our  polyclinics  to  have  declined.   The  doctor  in  the\r\n\r\npolyclinic is now seeing an average of 71 patients per day.  Ten\r\n\r\nyears  ago, it was 95.  The patient load of 70 patients per  day\r\n\r\nis  quite the same as the average 60-80 patients per day seen by\r\n\r\nthe  busy  general  practitioners.  So if  you  talk  about  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  care,  I  think  the polyclinics  are  offering  an\r\n\r\nequivalent kind.

Its grant to the promotion of arts\r\n\r\nnearly  doubled  in  the last three years.   This  supports  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's overall aim to develop a more gracious and  vibrant\r\n\r\nsociety.  The  Government  has  recently,  in  the  Presidential\r\n\r\nAddress debate, announced its financial support for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nLaSalle-SIA College of Arts and the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts\r\n\r\n(NAFA).   May  I suggest that with this support, we  consciously\r\n\r\ndevelop  LaSalle-SIA  College of the Arts  to  be  a  well-known\r\n\r\nacademy  for performing arts and NAFA to be a well-known  centre\r\n\r\nfor fine arts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, notwithstanding this positive move by the Government,\r\n\r\nmy  GPC  would like to see more being done to promote the  arts.\r\n\r\nWe  propose a three-pronged action plan.  Firstly, to give  more\r\n\r\nsupport  to  the  local  arts groups.  Secondly,  to  start  our\r\n\r\nchildren  early on an arts appreciation programme.  Thirdly,  to\r\n\r\nbring the arts to the HDB heartland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe there are about 50 to 100 local arts groups\r\n\r\nwhich deserve support from the Government.  We would like to see\r\n\r\nmore  funds being made available to help these arts groups  take\r\n\r\noff.   On arts education, we suggest that schools organise  more\r\n\r\nfield  trips to enhance students' understanding and appreciation\r\n\r\nof  the different forms of arts and sculptures.  Performing arts\r\n\r\nshould  also  be  included  as part  of  this  art  appreciation\r\n\r\nprogramme for the children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must also correct the image that the arts belong to\r\n\r\nthe  elite.  We must try to bring the arts to our HDB heartland.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we suggest that community centres and community clubs\r\n\r\nwhich are scheduled for renovation or rebuilding in the next few\r\n\r\nyears  designate rooms to be offered as homes for some of  these\r\n\r\nlocal  arts  groups.  We further suggest that  arts  corners  be\r\n\r\nestablished in every constituency where residents could  display\r\n\r\ntheir  talents  and art works on a pre-determined  Sunday  of  a\r\n\r\nmonth at the void deck of a certain block, for example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on the question of funding for the arts, we\r\n\r\nurge  MITA  to revive the idea of establishing an arts endowment\r\n\r\nfund  to help promote arts and arts education in support of  our\r\n\r\ngoal  of  building a gracious society.  We further propose  that\r\n\r\nthis  fund  comes  from part of the budgetary  surplus  that  we\r\n\r\ngenerate every year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, I echo the sentiments\r\n\r\nof  my GPC Chairman, Mr Chew Heng Ching.  I am glad to note that\r\n\r\nthe efforts by the Government and private groups to promote arts\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  are bearing some success.  We can  see  from  the\r\n\r\nrecently  concluded arts festival.  We drew a much larger  crowd\r\n\r\nthan before.  Most of the performances, I am made to understand,\r\n\r\nwere  oversubscribed.   There is  also  a  trend  of  a  growing\r\n\r\nappreciation of theatre, film, painting and other art forms.  So\r\n\r\nI  must  congratulate MITA for bringing the arts to the  people,\r\n\r\nespecially those also living in HDB flats.  Through schemes such\r\n\r\nas  arts  housing, art groups now can operate out  of  community\r\n\r\ncentres  and  thereby  contribute to art appreciation  across  a\r\n\r\nwider audience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for the arts to continue to develop and flourish\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, we certainly need both the practitioners and  the\r\n\r\naudience.  As again mentioned by my Chairman, the recent move by\r\n\r\nthe Government to promote art education through LaSalle-SIA Arts\r\n\r\nCollege  and  the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts would  definitely\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  the  pool  of  practitioners.   We   know   that\r\n\r\nappreciation of the arts, if introduced at an early  age,  would\r\n\r\nhave  a  lasting effect.  Art appreciation must also be fostered\r\n\r\namong adults.  Children who have an inclination towards the arts\r\n\r\nwill  pursue an active career if they have the support of  their\r\n\r\nparents  and  peers.  Thus, there is a relationship between  art\r\n\r\nappreciation  and  education.  As more  people  appreciate  art,\r\n\r\nthere  will be a tendency for more people to pursue a career  in\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern here, Sir, is the policy and the promotion of\r\n\r\nart  appreciation  and  education  in  Singapore.   We  need  to\r\n\r\nencourage art appreciation from the very young, but we must also\r\n\r\nensure that those who are interested in the arts, their interest\r\n\r\nis  sustained  while  in school.  Can we  perhaps  consider  art\r\n\r\neducation as part of our core curriculum in school?  While  this\r\n\r\nmay be the responsibility of MOE, I believe it is the domain  of\r\n\r\nMITA as the Ministry responsible for the development of the arts\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  to set the agenda and to work with  MOE.   Hence,\r\n\r\nthis policy\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmust  be  an  integrated one between MITA and  MOE.   With  this\r\n\r\nintegrated  policy,  students in the arts  could  be  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to perform publicly and interact with arts groups in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Attachment programmes could be developed  for  these\r\n\r\nstudents.  This policy would ensure that arts education  is  not\r\n\r\nonly  the  purview  of the trainers but also the  practitioners.\r\n\r\nThe  net  result is a policy which would ensure that arts  would\r\n\r\ncontinue to flourish in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, the Government, in order to\r\n\r\npromote our heritage, established the National Heritage Board in\r\n\r\nthe  year 1993.  The Board now incorporates the National History\r\n\r\nMuseum,  the  Singapore Arts Museum, Asian Civilisation  Museum,\r\n\r\nNational  Archives of Singapore and the Oral History Centre.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand that soon the Preservation of Monuments Board will be\r\n\r\ntransferred from the Ministry of National Development  to  MITA.\r\n\r\nDoes  it  mean  that  the Preservation of  Monuments  Board  has\r\n\r\nshifted  its  emphasis  from the preservation  of  buildings  to\r\n\r\nheritage  and  history?  May I therefore  ask  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nclarify to Members of the House the reason for the transfer  and\r\n\r\nwhether the Preservation of Monuments Board will be merged  into\r\n\r\nthe National Heritage Board (NHP) and what he sees as the future\r\n\r\ndirections of this Preservation of Monuments Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, still on the subject of heritage. In understanding\r\n\r\nSingapore's  root  and history, one must always  understand  our\r\n\r\nNational  Anthem \"Majullah Singapura\".  I remember that  when  I\r\n\r\nwas  a  school  boy  in  the 60s, we were  taught  to  read  and\r\n\r\nunderstand  the wordings in the Anthem and to sing  whenever  it\r\n\r\nwas  played.  The situation is quite different today.  Not  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  really  understand  the  wordings  in  the  Anthem\r\n\r\nbecause  they are in Malay, our national language, and not  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans sing whenever the Anthem is played.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I therefore propose that the Government, through MITA,\r\n\r\norganise  a  national campaign to get Singaporeans to understand\r\n\r\nour National Anthem, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhistory and objective behind the wordings of the Anthem, and  to\r\n\r\nencourage  Singaporeans to sing whenever the Anthem  is  played.\r\n\r\nSir,  if Singaporeans were to fully understand the wordings  and\r\n\r\nthe  meanings behind the Anthem, I am confident that  they  will\r\n\r\nsing  the Anthem loud and clear and with great passion and pride\r\n\r\nshowing their love for the country.\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am proposing that MITA take on this task because I\r\n\r\nconsider organising this campaign as part of our national effort\r\n\r\nto educate Singaporeans on our history and heritage.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in his Addendum to the\r\n\r\nPresidential Address, BG George Yeo stated that the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nInformation and the Arts will continue to help make Singapore  a\r\n\r\nrenaissance  city for information, culture and the arts  in  the\r\n\r\n21st  century.  I strongly support this intention.  I personally\r\n\r\nfeel that in order to succeed in this effort to make Singapore a\r\n\r\ngracious  city, we must, first of all, consider how to encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to appreciate and enjoy our culture and arts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my Chairman of the GPC, Mr Chew Heng Ching, has said,\r\n\r\nmany  of our cultural events and exhibitions have received  full\r\n\r\nsupport from the Government but the mass media of Singapore such\r\n\r\nas television, radio and newspapers give very little coverage or\r\n\r\nreport  on  cultural events and exhibitions, unlike China,  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  and  Taiwan.  Even when there are reports, they  are  very\r\n\r\nunenthusiastic  and  very brief.  They  can  hardly  arouse  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the  public.  I think this  is  very  regrettable.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  mass  media  may  be  looking  at  them  from  the\r\n\r\ncommercial and business point of view and find that they are  of\r\n\r\nno  commercial value.  In fact, if we want to promote  arts  and\r\n\r\nculture   and   to  make  Singapore  a  renaissance   city   for\r\n\r\ninformation,  culture and the arts in the next  millennium,  the\r\n\r\nmass  media  plays a very, very important role.   On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the  success of making Singapore a renaissance city  will\r\n\r\nalso contribute to the growth and development of our mass media.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have a lot of people who love the arts and\r\n\r\nculture  and  there is no difficulty in organising any  cultural\r\n\r\nevents  and exhibitions.  But it is very difficult for  them  to\r\n\r\nget the support from the mass media.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Vice-Chairman of the GPC for MITA, very often I was\r\n\r\ninvited to officiate at these events, and I saw that there  were\r\n\r\nhardly  any  news  reporters  present  at  these  events.   Some\r\n\r\nelaborately  organised  and  meaningful  cultural   events   and\r\n\r\nexhibitions did not receive good response from the public due to\r\n\r\nlack of publicity.  This is very disappointing.  To achieve  our\r\n\r\nobjective   of   making   Singapore  a  renaissance   city   for\r\n\r\ninformation, culture and the arts, we need not only the  support\r\n\r\nfrom the Government but also the support from the mass media and\r\n\r\nthe keen participation of every Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope MITA will look into ways to encourage the media to\r\n\r\ngive our cultural events more coverage.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, I understand the Singapore\r\n\r\nKindness  Movement was registered as a society at the  beginning\r\n\r\nof  this  year.   It  is a civic body with Institute  of  Public\r\n\r\nCharacter  (IPC) status which means that donation  to  the  body\r\n\r\nwill be tax exempt.  I understand its aim is to get Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  perform acts of kindness in their daily lives in  line  with\r\n\r\nour national efforts to promote gracious living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Singaporeans I spoke to about the Kindness\r\n\r\nMovement were a little confused.  They thought, since we already\r\n\r\nhave  the Courtesy Campaign, why the need for a movement  called\r\n\r\nthe  Kindness Movement.  Does it mean that the Courtesy Campaign\r\n\r\nhas  failed?  Many thought if it is really necessary to have the\r\n\r\nmovement,  why  not  combine  or merge  the  movement  with  the\r\n\r\nCourtesy  Campaign.   And  just as  many  ask  if  the  Courtesy\r\n\r\nCampaign  will  be  stopped  with the  launch  of  the  Kindness\r\n\r\nMovement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps it is opportune for the Minister to explain to this House the objective and rationale behind the Singapore Kindness Movement, its plan for the future and what will happen to the Courtesy Campaign when the Movement is launched.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I move on to the next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nto  give  the  House an update on the Cable  TV  project.   What\r\n\r\npercentage of the households in Singapore has been wired up  to-date  and  when will all the households be eventually wired  up?\r\n\r\nAnd how does the cable TV project fit into the Singapore IT 2000\r\n\r\nPlan?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand the subscriptions among households which\r\n\r\nare  already wired up remain very low.  Why is that so?   Is  it\r\n\r\nbecause the TCS programmes are too attractive offering a  better\r\n\r\nalternative?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SCV has many channels providing info-educational,\r\n\r\ncurrent  affairs, cultural, sports, children's and entertainment\r\n\r\nprogrammes meeting the needs of Singaporeans from all  walks  of\r\n\r\nlife.   It  is a pity that Singaporeans are not fully  aware  of\r\n\r\nthis.  I think the SCV must do more marketing and perhaps review\r\n\r\nits  subscription fees to make them sufficiently attractive  for\r\n\r\nhouseholds to subscribe.  May I therefore ask the Minister  what\r\n\r\nplans  are  in  place to get more Singaporeans to  subscribe  to\r\n\r\nCable  TV?   And in the event that SCV proves to be  non-viable,\r\n\r\nwill the Government come to their rescue?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I move on to the next cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, please.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, following feedback and\r\n\r\nsuggestions  from Members of this House some four years  ago  (I\r\n\r\nremember  there  was  a heated debate on TCS  programmes),  MITA\r\n\r\nsubsequently  formed two Advisory Committees, ie,  the  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee on Chinese Dramas and Variety Shows, or ACCESS as they\r\n\r\ncall  it,  and the Programme Advisory Committee (PAC) to  advise\r\n\r\nand  provide  feedback to TCS and RCS on their programmes.   The\r\n\r\nCommittees  are well represented.  They include some Members  of\r\n\r\nthis   House   and  also  Singaporeans  holding   positions   of\r\n\r\nresponsibilities in society and from all walks of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Committees are into their third or fourth year of\r\n\r\noperations and have put up useful observations and recommen\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndations  to TCS and RCS to improve their programmes.  Indeed,  I\r\n\r\nthink the Committees have done well.  The programmes of TCS  and\r\n\r\nRCS  today are a marked improvement from four to five years ago.\r\n\r\nAnd I think there is further room for improvement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both TCS and RCS remain receptive to suggestions for\r\n\r\nimprovement and that are good signs.  Sir, I propose  that  MITA\r\n\r\nregularly review the composition of ACCESS and PAC, and at  each\r\n\r\nrenewal  time, when the two-year term expires, replace half  the\r\n\r\nCommittee and at the next renewal, replace the other  half.   In\r\n\r\nthis way, we would continuously be able to inject new ideas  and\r\n\r\ntalents  into the two Committees, and yet ensure continuity  and\r\n\r\nconsistency in their opinion and feedback.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even if the PAC and ACCESS have good representations,\r\n\r\nin   terms  of  having  Singaporeans  from  all  walks  of  life\r\n\r\nrepresented   in   the   two  Committees,   relying   on   their\r\n\r\nobservations, feedback and suggestions alone is not enough.  TCS\r\n\r\nshould  reach out to a wider network of audience and viewers  to\r\n\r\nget   feedback.   And  one  useful  network  is  certainly   our\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations  and our  grassroots  leaders  in  the\r\n\r\nconstituency.  These people have direct access and  interactions\r\n\r\nwith  the  constituents.  Indeed, they  get  feedback  from  the\r\n\r\nhorse's mouth.  May I therefore ask the Minister if TCS has such\r\n\r\na  feedback  mechanism, besides the PAC and ACCESS and,  if  so,\r\n\r\nwhat are they?  How effective have all these feedback mechanisms\r\n\r\nbeen in helping TCS and RCS to improve their programmes?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to speak\r\n\r\non  the  recommendations of the Programme Advisory Committee  on\r\n\r\nTCS  Chinese Dramas and Variety Shows.  I would generally accept\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations of the PAC.  But there are two observations\r\n\r\nI like to make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its mid-year report, the PAC pointed out that the\r\n\r\nChannel 8 programmes seem to be confined only to the Chinese and\r\n\r\nexcluding all the other races.  In this way,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe   production  direction  will  be  narrow  in  future.   The\r\n\r\nCommittee also pointed out that the news programmes in Channel 8\r\n\r\nhave  less  international news as compared  to  Channel  5,  and\r\n\r\npeople  who speak only English are hardly invited to give  their\r\n\r\nviews  and  opinions in current affairs and financial programmes\r\n\r\non  Channel 8.  In view of that, the Committee recommended  that\r\n\r\nChannel  8  should widen its vision by having more international\r\n\r\nnews  and  distinctive  features of a  multi-racial  society  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above recommendation of the Committee is aimed at\r\n\r\nintegrating  the  characteristic features  of  our  multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety.    So  the  programmes  should  feature  the  different\r\n\r\ncultural  backgrounds to meet the needs of  each  ethnic  group.\r\n\r\nThe  Committee  recommended that Channel 8 be more  creative  to\r\n\r\nimprove the quality of its programmes.  I think the objective is\r\n\r\ngood  and  I  can understand that.  However, we must  understand\r\n\r\nthat  Channel 8 and Channel 5 have their own groups of  viewers.\r\n\r\nJust  like  the Lianhe Zaobao and the Straits Times,  they  have\r\n\r\ntheir  own  groups of readers.  So the difference between  these\r\n\r\nnewspapers  is  that  they  have their own  characteristics  and\r\n\r\ndifferent focuses.  They have different values, different  views\r\n\r\nand  different perceptions to meet the needs of their respective\r\n\r\nreaders.  Therefore, we cannot expect Lianhe Zaobao to go  along\r\n\r\nthe lines of the Straits Times or the Straits Times to cater  to\r\n\r\nthe tastes of the readers of Lianhe Zaobao.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same logic applies to TCS' Channels 8 and 5. The\r\n\r\nChinese   programmes   on   Channel  8   should   maintain   its\r\n\r\ncharacteristics.  At the same time, it should  seek  to  improve\r\n\r\nits  quality  of  programming.  When the Chinese  programmes  on\r\n\r\nChannel 8 are more interesting and rich in substance, the  needs\r\n\r\nof the viewers will be better satisfied.  Please do not make the\r\n\r\nnews  and programmes of Channel 8 to look exactly like those  on\r\n\r\nChannel 5 and we do not want the programmes on Channel 5 to look\r\n\r\nexactly  like those on Channel 8.  Otherwise, we will disappoint\r\n\r\nboth the Chinese-speaking and the English-speaking viewers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its report of 8th July, the Programme Advisory Committee\r\n\r\nrecommended  that  TCS institute a dress code for  its  artistes\r\n\r\nattending  prestigious events so as to ensure that their  attire\r\n\r\nbefits   the   occasion.   I  consider  myself  a   conservative\r\n\r\nSingaporean.  However, I feel that the dressing of TCS  artistes\r\n\r\nat  public  events, whether in the past or present, is perfectly\r\n\r\nfine  and  there was no occasion of over-exposure.  I  only  say\r\n\r\nthat they are more daring and fashionable.  TV artistes are  not\r\n\r\nMinisters or Members of Parliament.  They are also not  teachers\r\n\r\nor  lecturers who need to set an example for their students.  So\r\n\r\nas  artistes,  their dressing is usually trendy and avant-garde,\r\n\r\nthey  may  even be leaders in the fashion world.  Personally,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that TCS artistes' dressing is fine so long as it  is  not\r\n\r\ntoo  exposed  and  does  not reflect bad  motives.   So  modern,\r\n\r\ntrendy, special and even sexy dressing is not a problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just two years ago I mentioned in Parliament that there was\r\n\r\na  film  called  \"Nell\" which featured very  clearly  some  nude\r\n\r\nscenes  of the female body.  If we could allow this film  to  be\r\n\r\nscreened  in  Singapore, classified as \"PG\" and not \"R(A)\",  why\r\n\r\nare  we  setting a double standard for setting a dress code  for\r\n\r\nour TCS artistes?  Singapore is an open society.  It is also  an\r\n\r\ninternational  city.   Our  Government  has  plans  to   develop\r\n\r\nSingapore  into a movie and television hub of Asia in  the  next\r\n\r\nfew years.  We should not draw up clauses to dictate the ways on\r\n\r\nhow  our  TV artistes should dress themselves.  If we  do  that,\r\n\r\nthen  we would not be able to attract some famous artistes, like\r\n\r\nAndy Lau, to come to Singapore.  I think we may provide artistes\r\n\r\nwith  some advice on their image presentation and cultivate  and\r\n\r\nenhance  their cultural and artistic qualities.   This  will  be\r\n\r\nhelpful  to our effort to realise our goal of becoming  a  movie\r\n\r\nand TV hub in Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, there are some\r\n\r\nattempts  by TCS to inject more info-educational programmes  for\r\n\r\nchildren in the mornings.  But, as a whole, there are still  too\r\n\r\nmany cartoons in the schedule.  There should be a better balance\r\n\r\nin the mix of children's programmes.  Too\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmany  cartoons in the morning will distract children's attention\r\n\r\nfrom  their homework.  Besides, some of the cartoon series  such\r\n\r\nas  Street Sharks, Ninja Turtles, and so forth are too  violent.\r\n\r\nTCS  should  instead produce children's programmes that  reflect\r\n\r\nlocal  culture  and  values.  They could  consider  highlighting\r\n\r\nschool   concerts,  school  drama  festivals,  arts  and   craft\r\n\r\nachievements,  school sports competition  finals  in  the  local\r\n\r\nchildren  series.   If TCS is unable to get  suitable  cartoons,\r\n\r\nthen  they  should  shorten the cartoon broadcast  schedule  and\r\n\r\ninstead  use the time slot available for something more  useful,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  showing  some dialect series  of  movies  in  the\r\n\r\nmorning for the entertainment of senior citizens.\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still many senior citizens who can only speak\r\n\r\ndialect.   In the morning, there could be news, for example,  in\r\n\r\ndialect  which  gives  a  summary of the  important  local  news\r\n\r\nbroadcast  the  previous  day.   After  all,  news  is   already\r\n\r\nbroadcast  over radio in dialect in the evenings.  In this  way,\r\n\r\nSir,  senior  citizens  who  could  not  understand  English  or\r\n\r\nMandarin   could  also  be  kept  informed  of   the   important\r\n\r\ndevelopments   in   our  country.   This  would   prevent   many\r\n\r\nmisinterpretations  of  important  Government  policies  through\r\n\r\nwrong translation or hearing from a third party.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, local Mandarin dramas, particularly on Channel 8,\r\n\r\nstill  tend  to  be  very melodramatic.   For  example,  I  have\r\n\r\nreceived  feedback from my constituents that the  story  usually\r\n\r\nrevolves  round two men and a woman, or two women with one  man,\r\n\r\nor  rejected females will commit suicide, or turn to alcohol, or\r\n\r\npick  up  some  other  man  in the  bar.   These  are  not  true\r\n\r\nreflections of life in Singapore.  [Interruption]. Or maybe I am\r\n\r\nout of date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, TCS could also produce socially worthy programmes\r\n\r\nwhich  highlight youth involvement in community work, promote  a\r\n\r\ngracious   society,  show  retirees  how  to  stay  active   and\r\n\r\ncontribute to society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on public holidays, TCS should schedule more first-run\r\n\r\nmovies.  Repeats should be done selectively outside prime  slots\r\n\r\nwhich  should be reserved for news and good programmes.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister could consider this feedback.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakarupan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakarupan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, the second\r\n\r\nseason  of the S-League has just ended.  The soccer experts  are\r\n\r\nwriting  up  their analyses to rate the success of  the  season.\r\n\r\nEvery  sportsman in Singapore or even a primary school kid,  who\r\n\r\nhas only got some cursory interest in soccer, knows what was the\r\n\r\nbiggest shortcoming of this season.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the biggest shortcoming is undoubtedly the lack of TV\r\n\r\ncoverage  of  the League.  In last year's season,  a  number  of\r\n\r\nmatches  were  shown  live  on TV but  many  of  these  matches,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, turned out to be uninteresting encounters.  These\r\n\r\nuninteresting  over exposures did not help the S-League  either.\r\n\r\nIt  was  because,  in  addition to showing  these  uninteresting\r\n\r\nmatches, the lack of professionalism in placing and operating TV\r\n\r\nequipment and the lack of informed and positive commentary added\r\n\r\nto  the problem.  To show the game in full alongside the English\r\n\r\nPremier League certainly invites negative comments and the  lack\r\n\r\nof  TV  professionalism  compounds the error  for  a  relatively\r\n\r\nintelligent football audience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is really needed is for the local TV stations to\r\n\r\ndesign  and  develop a programme which focuses on  the  positive\r\n\r\nelements of Singaporean football and encourages fans to identify\r\n\r\nwith  the teams.  This can be achieved by a regular weekly half-hour  show in a peak hour slot.  The content of the show  should\r\n\r\nbe  made entertaining, interesting, informative and challenging.\r\n\r\nThe  positive  aspects of the S-League should be  stressed,  the\r\n\r\nskills,  the  atmosphere, the competition,  not  forgetting  the\r\n\r\nsponsors,  and the progress.  In other words, actions should  be\r\n\r\nkept to the highlights of the games, just the best moments,  but\r\n\r\nof all the week's games.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alongside the action should be segments designed to build the\r\n\r\npersonalities  and  news  of  activities  designed  to   develop\r\n\r\nfootball in Singapore.  The focus of the show should not just be\r\n\r\non looking back at the weekend's action but also looking forward\r\n\r\nin promoting the games coming up and publicising locations, kick-off times, ticket availability, etc, to encourage supporters  to\r\n\r\ngo to the games.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that our local TV stations expect the S-League to pay a hefty sum of money to produce such a show or to\r\n\r\nhave  delayed  telecast  of  the games.   This  is  a  very  odd\r\n\r\nsituation  because,  in  many  other  countries,  especially  in\r\n\r\nEurope,  and  other parts of Asia and Australia, it  is  the  TV\r\n\r\nstations who have to pay the sports associations hefty  sums  of\r\n\r\nmoney, in the order of millions of dollars, to get the rights to\r\n\r\ntelecast  the League games.  True that our S-League is  not  yet\r\n\r\nwell-established as, say, the English League or the J-League  in\r\n\r\nJapan, but our local TV stations can do more to invest in  local\r\n\r\nsoccer which will pay off in later years, especially when soccer\r\n\r\nbetting  is  introduced.  They should also invest in  satisfying\r\n\r\nthe  appetites of thousands of soccer fans.  After all, watching\r\n\r\nsoccer,  besides shopping and eating, is a favourite pastime  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Minister himself is a soccer fan and I\r\n\r\nhope that he will take up this matter personally.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, I used to be quite critical of\r\n\r\nTCS programmes and I must confess that I share the sentiments of\r\n\r\nMr  Chew  Heng Ching that over the last few years, we have  seen\r\n\r\nimprovements.   However,  I  think  there  is  still  room   for\r\n\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to quote you one example. Like many\r\n\r\nothers  in  Singapore,  I watch the TCS  live  coverage  of  the\r\n\r\nhandover of Hong Kong from the British to China on the night  of\r\n\r\n30th  June  this year.  I must say that I was quite disappointed\r\n\r\nwith the way TCS treated the event.  In my opinion, and also the\r\n\r\nopinion  of  many whom I have spoken to, TCS' coverage  did  not\r\n\r\nreally reflect the solemnity and historic importance of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nevent in a way that one would have expected.  Just to quote  one\r\n\r\nexample, Sir.  In one instance, we were brought over to  Chijmes\r\n\r\nwhere we saw TCS stars and all the actors and actresses having a\r\n\r\ngood time there.  And the commentator was describing and showing\r\n\r\nus what food they were eating that night.  Some of those came to\r\n\r\nme  and commented that they did not really care what a bunch  of\r\n\r\nTCS actors and actresses were eating on a night like that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the significance really of showing them partying\r\n\r\naway when the real event was happening in Hong Kong and Beijing?\r\n\r\nWhere  is  TCS' sense of occasion?  There were also  people  who\r\n\r\nwere unhappy with the commentary and I share their opinion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at times, if you really cannot beat them, you join\r\n\r\nthem.   In this instance, I think TCS would have done better  by\r\n\r\nsimply  hooking  on with one of the Hong Kong's stations  rather\r\n\r\nthan making our own presentation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, every\r\n\r\nyear  when  we  debate the budget for MITA, TV  programmes  have\r\n\r\nalways  been  the  focus  of our debate because  television  has\r\n\r\nbecome  part  and parcel of the lives of our people,  especially\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  flat dwellers.  In the evening, whenever  I  visit  my\r\n\r\nconstituency, I cannot help noticing this point.   Almost  every\r\n\r\nfamily  watches TV.  Some parents may be reading  the  Shin  Min\r\n\r\nDaily  News  or the  Lianhe Wanbao and their children  would  be\r\n\r\nwatching TV.  Whenever the Comedy Night is on the air,  we  hear\r\n\r\nlaughter  everywhere. Even the old folks would  put  down  their\r\n\r\nnewspapers and join in the fun.    On the other hand, when there\r\n\r\nis  a  live  telecast of an important football match,   we  hear\r\n\r\nshouts  resembling  the  Kallang  Roar  everywhere  in  the  HDB\r\n\r\nestates. Our TV programmes have gone deep into the people.   But\r\n\r\nthere  may be  a great change very soon.  Why?  Because  we  are\r\n\r\nspeedily   wiring  up  the  whole of Singapore  with  television\r\n\r\ncables. .\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, I think quite a lot of households are already\r\n\r\nhaving access to cable TV.  So all these entertainment, news,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmovie  and  sports  programmes  sent to the  households  through\r\n\r\nunderground  cables  with  super-high  definitions  can  pose  a\r\n\r\nchallenge to TCS.  For the time being,  not many have signed  up\r\n\r\nfor  subsrciptions with Cable TV. Perhaps it is because the fees\r\n\r\nare  on  the  high  side.   I understand that  when  we  have  a\r\n\r\ncritical mass of subscribers when the whole country is wired up,\r\n\r\nthen  the  fees will be lowered, just as in the case  of  mobile\r\n\r\nhandphones.   Then,  it  will be  a greater  challenge  to  TCS.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we should not be afraid of challenge.  We should  open\r\n\r\nup.   But we should be fully prepared to face the new situation.\r\n\r\nIn regional and world events, I think we should let Singaporeans\r\n\r\nview  the  events from the point of view of Singapore  and   our\r\n\r\nnational interest.  Mr Choo Wee Khiang referred to the programme\r\n\r\non  the  Reunification of Hong Kong with China.  I  watched  the\r\n\r\nprogramme  too.   I must say  TCS has made a good  presentation.\r\n\r\nIt  is a great world event.   Through this programe, we have  an\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the mindset of the Hong Kong people before  the\r\n\r\nreunification.  We  saw  the  People's  Liberation  Army   (PLA)\r\n\r\nmarching  across the border into Hong Kong.  What is the  impact\r\n\r\nof  the reunification of Hong Kong with China on this region and\r\n\r\non Singapore?  I think the programme does not cover this aspect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that TCS should attach more importance to the\r\n\r\nanalysis  and  comments  on current affairs.  When  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwatch  TV programmes, they like to switch channels from time  to\r\n\r\ntime. When they are watching news on our local channel, they may\r\n\r\nswitch  over  to  CNN or BBC News.  Then there will  be  serious\r\n\r\nproblems  because  they will be looking  at  problems  from  the\r\n\r\nforeigner's  point of view.  This is certainly not conducive  to\r\n\r\nour  efforts of attaining a consensus between the people and the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After corporatisation, TCS programmes have improved by\r\n\r\nleaps  and  bounds,  especially in  news   reports  and  current\r\n\r\naffairs.  I think TCS should give more weightage to this kind of\r\n\r\nprogramme, give them greater emphasis and go one step further to\r\n\r\nextend  its coverage to the other aspects of life.  Interviewees\r\n\r\nshould not be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconfined  to  the  authorities,  celebrities,  specialists   and\r\n\r\nexperts in the respective fields.  We could include also the man-in-the-street, students, housewives and other ordinary citizens.\r\n\r\nLet  us listen to the ordinary people's views.  I feel that,  at\r\n\r\nthe  moment, TV programming is targetted too much on the youths,\r\n\r\nthe  educated and the families and, to an extent, neglecting the\r\n\r\nmiddle-aged  and  older  people.  I think the  programme  should\r\n\r\nalso  reflect the problems of the middle-aged people, especially\r\n\r\nthe  various problems  on the changing wage structure and  other\r\n\r\nproblems  generally   faced  by all the  middle-aged  and  older\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our population is aging rapidly, and the programming\r\n\r\nof  TV  should  reflect  this fact.  If you  are  talking  about\r\n\r\npurchasing  power,  I  can say that the  middle-aged  and  older\r\n\r\npeople  are  equally strong in their purchasing power.   So  the\r\n\r\nsponsors can be rest assured that the programmes and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe commercials that go with them will appeal to them too!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

They\r\n\r\nare  drawn  along roads with high volume of scheduled  buses  to\r\n\r\ngive  priority to these buses, which are efficient  carriers  of\r\n\r\nlarge number of passengers.  This is in line with our policy  to\r\n\r\npromote greater use of mass public transport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has received similar requests to allow private\r\n\r\nand  school  buses to enter the bus lanes during the  restricted\r\n\r\nhours. If these buses were allowed to enter bus lanes to pick up\r\n\r\nand  set  down  passengers during restricted hours,  they  would\r\n\r\nimpede  the flow of scheduled buses using these lanes and affect\r\n\r\ntheir   reliability  and  level of service  to  the  public  bus\r\n\r\ncommuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After careful consideration, my Ministry has decided that\r\n\r\nbus  lanes  should  continue to be restricted to  scheduled  bus\r\n\r\nservices  during the restricted hours.
