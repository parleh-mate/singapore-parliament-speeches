I  stated  then that you were  the  fourth\r\n\r\nperson   to  hold  this  high  office  since   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of parliamentary government, and that\r\n\r\nyou had broken what could have crystallised into a\r\n\r\nconvention  that the office of the Speaker  should\r\n\r\nfall  on  the  shoulders of  those  with  a  legal\r\n\r\ntraining.  Over  these  last  two  years  and  ten\r\n\r\nmonths,  you  have  ably demonstrated  that  legal\r\n\r\nqualifications are not a sine qua non for  wearing\r\n\r\nthe mantle of this office. The aplomb, dignity and\r\n\r\nmariner in which you have so ably discharged  your\r\n\r\nresponsibilities amply confirms  you  as  the  one\r\n\r\nmost fitted to guide our proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will be presiding over deliberations of\r\n\r\nan enlarged Chamber of 65 Members, of whom no less\r\n\r\nthan  11 will be taking their seats in this  House\r\n\r\nfor  the first time. I have no doubt that you will\r\n\r\ngive   these  new  Members  the  same  considerate\r\n\r\nguidance that you have shown to all of us  in  the\r\n\r\npast.  You may be assured, Sir, that for our part,\r\n\r\nwe  will continue to give you all the co-operation\r\n\r\nnecessary for the speedy despatch of parliamentary\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I would first like to thank the\r\n\r\nLeader  of the House for his kind words on my  re-election\r\n\r\nas Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Prime Minister, honourable Ministers,\r\n\r\nhonourable  Members, you have greatly honoured  me\r\n\r\nby re-electing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nme  as  Speaker  of this House  and  I  feel  very\r\n\r\nprivileged to continue to serve the House in  this\r\n\r\nhigh and responsible office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first election to this Chair on the 27th of\r\n\r\nJanuary,  1970,  was a proud  moment  in  my  life\r\n\r\nthough  I  must  say  it  was  not  without   some\r\n\r\ntrepidation as I appreciated then, as  I  do  now,\r\n\r\nthe  responsibilities of this office.

Then, the prospects were  grim.\r\n\r\nWe  faced the stark question of survival:  how  to\r\n\r\nhold  up  the  economy, to generate jobs,  of  any\r\n\r\nkind, to mop up massive unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will to succeed was decisive. Sheer\r\n\r\ndetermination,  hard work and  realistic  planning\r\n\r\nenabled  Singapore to make the grade.  Imaginative\r\n\r\npolicies,  combined  with  tough  measures,   have\r\n\r\nminimised  the  economic and  social  dislocation.\r\n\r\nToday's  continuing and controlled boom is  giving\r\n\r\nSingapore that glow of success. There is  a  bloom\r\n\r\nwhich  will spread from the city to the new towns,\r\n\r\nand  through to the villages and kampongs  in  the\r\n\r\nrural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the challenge is to maintain and continue\r\n\r\nthis  rapid  pace  of  growth for  continued  high\r\n\r\ngrowth rates. Then the trend towards a better life\r\n\r\nfor  everyone  willing to work  will  become  more\r\n\r\npronounced, and in more gracious surroundings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot seek fame for sheer size. But we can\r\n\r\nachieve  higher standards in everything, with  the\r\n\r\nemphasis  on  quality, whether in  jobs,  schools,\r\n\r\nhospitals,  social and recreational  amenities  or\r\n\r\nhomes.  We  can become a centre for excellence  in\r\n\r\nall  fields important to our economic and cultural\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this, we must fulfil two pre-conditions.\r\n\r\nFirst,  smaller families-ideally  two\r\n\r\nchildren  per family - so that more resources  and\r\n\r\ncare can be given to each child by the family  and\r\n\r\nthe  State. Second, Singapore must eschew  one  of\r\n\r\nthe characteristics of the welfare state syndrome,\r\n\r\nwhere  everyone  expects others, not  himself,  to\r\n\r\nwork  harder  to carry the subsidies for  services\r\n\r\neveryone wants. For us, a yet to be developed  and\r\n\r\nfully   industrialised   society,   this   selfish\r\n\r\nrejection  of  the  work ethic is  fatal.  On  the\r\n\r\ncontrary, hard work and high performance  must  be\r\n\r\nencouraged  and rewarded. No one should  get  away\r\n\r\nwith enjoying services subsidised through the hard\r\n\r\nwork   of   others,   without   making   his   own\r\n\r\ncontribution,  to  the best  of  his  ability  and\r\n\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the last war, several countries in the West\r\n\r\nset  out to create a more \"cushioned\" society. The\r\n\r\nstate  promised  to  provide  for  everyone,  from\r\n\r\ncradle to grave. In the beginning, they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npromised free pre-natal and accouchement services,\r\n\r\nfree medical and dental treatment, free spectacles\r\n\r\nand  dentures, free education, free school  meals,\r\n\r\nheavily  subsidised public housing,  and  generous\r\n\r\nold-age pensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idealistic social philosophy was to cushion\r\n\r\npeople    from    the   harshness   of    personal\r\n\r\ninadequacies,    and    the    sometimes     cruel\r\n\r\ndispensations  of fortune. But, in the  course  of\r\n\r\nthe  last  27  years, this ideal  has  had  to  be\r\n\r\nmodified,  because of escalating  economic  costs,\r\n\r\nand    worse,    because   of   the   debilitating\r\n\r\npsychological   consequences   on   the    working\r\n\r\npopulation. Policy makers soon found out that free\r\n\r\nservices  led to excessive use, and  much  abuse.\r\n\r\nGradually,  but  inevitably even  under  socialist\r\n\r\ngovernments, substantial charges have  had  to  he\r\n\r\nimposed on these initially almost free services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the greater damage to the spirit and morale\r\n\r\nof  a  people  was harder to correct.  A  profound\r\n\r\nchange  in  attitudes to work, and the absence  of\r\n\r\npersonal   shouldering  of  responsibility,   have\r\n\r\npermeated   considerable   portions    of    their\r\n\r\nsocieties.  They have reared a younger  generation\r\n\r\nwho now believe that the state owes them a living,\r\n\r\na  good  living. They believe the good  things  in\r\n\r\nlife  are  easy to come by, by mass agitation,  by\r\n\r\nstrikes,    and    through   confrontation    with\r\n\r\nestablished authority. Quite a few of the  younger\r\n\r\ntrade  union  leaders do not believe that  rewards\r\n\r\nshould   be  equated  to  hard  work  or  personal\r\n\r\nperformance. They believe that all should be  paid\r\n\r\nequally,  the industrious as well as the indolent.\r\n\r\nOthers,  who they are not quite clear about,  will\r\n\r\ngenerate the wealth, the larger part of which  the\r\n\r\nstate  can  cream off to pay for the  comfort  and\r\n\r\nwelfare of themselves and their followers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some countries, professionally trained men and\r\n\r\nwomen,  instead  of  creating  wealth,  use  their\r\n\r\nknowledge   and  ingenuity  to  defeat   the   tax\r\n\r\ncollector.  Many  high  income  professionals  and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs stop trying, and even stop  working,\r\n\r\nin  order  not to make profits just before  surtax\r\n\r\nrates. Or they spend lavishly on expense accounts,\r\n\r\nand other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrills,  to  defeat the tax collector.  Some  even\r\n\r\ncommute  to  tax-free havens in the Caribbean  and\r\n\r\nelsewhere, for more than six months of a year,  to\r\n\r\nescape  income  tax on dividends from  investments\r\n\r\nthey   made   in  foreign  countries.  Singapore's\r\n\r\npolicies  must not cause this kind of  distortion,\r\n\r\nor  the  workings of the competitive, achievement-oriented\r\n\r\nsociety which have brought us to where we\r\n\r\nare, will fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must and can keep our population growth small,\r\n\r\nso  that  every child can be better fed,  clothed,\r\n\r\ntrained and nurtured. We cannot afford to get into\r\n\r\nthis  unhappy  vicious circle, the  something  for\r\n\r\nnothing  syndrome. We must pay for what  we  want.\r\n\r\nEveryone  must work to earn and pay  for  what  he\r\n\r\nwants in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two fundamental areas, there must be heavy\r\n\r\nsubsidies. Good health and good education must  be\r\n\r\navailable to all. These are costly objectives. But\r\n\r\nthe user must pay a small percentage of the actual\r\n\r\ncost. It is to remind him of the enormous cost the\r\n\r\nrest  of  society is paying for him. This  nominal\r\n\r\npayment  will also prevent abuse in  the  user  of\r\n\r\nthese services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Government intends to allow wages to go up,\r\n\r\nbut  in  a  steady  and orderly fashion.  However,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  increasing  taxes  on  his  increased\r\n\r\nearnings, we shall leave the worker with  most  of\r\n\r\nthe increased income. Thus, the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nwhat  he does with this increased income will rest\r\n\r\nwith each individual. He has to decide whether  be\r\n\r\nwants  to  spend his money on luxury  articles  or\r\n\r\nexpensive services he does not really need, or  to\r\n\r\nsave his money in buying a home, or putting it  in\r\n\r\nthe  Post Office Savings Bank or investing  it  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  bonds and stocks which yield  interest\r\n\r\nor dividends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principles of our taxation policies must\r\n\r\nencourage people to want to work hard and  to  cam\r\n\r\nmore,  so  that they can save more.  High  savings\r\n\r\nlead  to  high capital accumulation,  and,  as  in\r\n\r\nJapan, will enable more wealth to be generated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaxes will fall at least as much on spending as on\r\n\r\nearnings, to encourage savings. We should not  get\r\n\r\ncaught  in  the  consumer-society before  we  have\r\n\r\nbecome fully developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone will try to earn more if he is allowed\r\n\r\nto  retain  the  major part of  his  earnings,  to\r\n\r\ninvest  in  sound  enterprises which  can  further\r\n\r\nincrease  his  income. Many  a  newly  independent\r\n\r\nstate,  barely  developed, that have  promised  to\r\n\r\ncarry their voters from cradle to grave, have  had\r\n\r\ntheir  backs broken. And it will take  decades  to\r\n\r\nmend  the damage. Even highly developed industrial\r\n\r\nsocieties  have  been beset with  ever  increasing\r\n\r\ntaxation  to meet ever higher subsidies in  social\r\n\r\nservices.  Even the most affluent  have  not  been\r\n\r\nable to protect the pensioner and the fixed income\r\n\r\ngroups  from  being impoverished by inflation.  We\r\n\r\nmust learn from the lessons which others have paid\r\n\r\nbitterly for, that nothing in life is for free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On constitutional and security matters, the last\r\n\r\nfew  years  have  shown that some  safeguards  are\r\n\r\nnecessary. Constitutional amendments will be  made\r\n\r\nearly  in this session of Parliament, so  that  no\r\n\r\nsurrender of our sovereignty, or any part thereof,\r\n\r\nby  way of incorporation into, or federation with,\r\n\r\nany  other  country is possible, unless two-thirds\r\n\r\nof  the total electorate vote positively for it in\r\n\r\na referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be criminal negligence to allow foreign\r\n\r\ninterests   with  large  financial  resources   to\r\n\r\nmanipulate  our  internal politics,  by  financing\r\n\r\nSingapore    political   parties,    professional,\r\n\r\nacademic  and  other groups,  to  try  to  beguile\r\n\r\ndomestic opinion, especially if their efforts  are\r\n\r\ninsidiously  multiplied by purveying them  through\r\n\r\nmass  media  set  up and supplied generously  with\r\n\r\nfunds  for this purpose. No foreign interests  can\r\n\r\nbe   allowed   to  take  over  Singapore   through\r\n\r\nfinancing   and  manipulating  political   parties\r\n\r\nthrough   their  naive  or  vain,  self-proclaimed\r\n\r\nleaders.  Whether fools or knaves,  they  must  be\r\n\r\nsaved  from  their own follies or villainies  when\r\n\r\npowerful groups set out to use them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this legislation will not prevent my\r\n\r\nGovernment,  at  present or in  the  future,  from\r\n\r\njoining  other  countries inside  or  outside  the\r\n\r\nregion,  in  arrangements for mutual security,  or\r\n\r\nfor  economic purposes, such as a free trade area,\r\n\r\nand perhaps, eventually, even a common market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation will also be introduced to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  all political parties will have their  party\r\n\r\nexpenditure and income periodically inspected.

The  package  of\r\n\r\nincentives,  the  build-up of infrastructure,  the\r\n\r\nsustained   effort  at  industrial  promotion   in\r\n\r\noverseas  countries and the restructuring  of  our\r\n\r\nfinancial   institutions   to   support   economic\r\n\r\nexpansion,  they have contributed to  the  present\r\n\r\nstate of Singapore's economic well-being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sustain the momentum that has been achieved, a\r\n\r\npolicy of \"more of the same\" would not be entirely\r\n\r\nadequate.  This is because Singapore's targets  as\r\n\r\nwell as the socio-economic environment itself  are\r\n\r\nnot  those of the past. Today, it is no  longer  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of inducing more and more industries  into\r\n\r\nSingapore, whatever the cost. It is possible to be\r\n\r\nsomewhat  more discriminating; to seek  industries\r\n\r\nthat do not ruin the environment, industries which\r\n\r\nhold  good  prospects for the continuous upgrading\r\n\r\nof  manpower  skills,  be they  plant  operatives,\r\n\r\nsupervisors  and  technicians,  or  higher   level\r\n\r\nengineering  and scientific staff, and  industries\r\n\r\nthat  have  a  catalytic effect  on  the  economy,\r\n\r\nencouraging  a  growth  of allied  and  supporting\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These objectives, however, have to be reached\r\n\r\nunder  conditions totally different from those  of\r\n\r\nfive  years ago. There is no large pool  of  cheap\r\n\r\nunemployed  workers.  But,  on  the  other   hand,\r\n\r\nSingapore's   vocational  institutes,   industrial\r\n\r\ntraining centres, Polytechnic and universities are\r\n\r\nturning out each year more and more of the skilled\r\n\r\nmanpower that industry needs. And work permits are\r\n\r\nissued,   liberally,  to  those   industries   and\r\n\r\nenterprises  which  upgrade  the  skills  of   the\r\n\r\nworkers,  or where the level of sophistication  of\r\n\r\nthe products manufactured is high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more refined economic policy is required in the\r\n\r\nnew  situation to ensure that intending investors,\r\n\r\nboth from overseas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas well as our own citizens, will be able  to\r\n\r\nobtain  the  essential  factors  of  production  -\r\n\r\ncapital,  labour  and land - in such  proportions,\r\n\r\ngrades, skills and quantity as they may require.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we succeed in this, we should see a\r\n\r\ncontinuation  of the fast rate of economic  growth\r\n\r\nof previous years, subject to one proviso. This is\r\n\r\nthat  no  severe  disruption of the  international\r\n\r\nmonetary  system  will occur to  seriously  affect\r\n\r\nworld  trade. An economy like Singapore's,  highly\r\n\r\ngeared   to  export  markets  of  the  world,   is\r\n\r\nextremely  sensitive to changes in  conditions  in\r\n\r\nworld trade. There is little that Singapore can do\r\n\r\nto   promote  the  badly  needed  reforms  of  the\r\n\r\ninternational monetary system. What it can  do  is\r\n\r\nto  protect itself against the adverse effects  of\r\n\r\neconomic   troubles  created  by  such   problems.\r\n\r\nFortunately for us, sufficient reserves have  been\r\n\r\naccumulated  in  the  past  which   we   can   use\r\n\r\njudiciously  to cushion off the worst  effects  of\r\n\r\nsuch  crises. Also, the further development of  an\r\n\r\nefficient  and  highly sophisticated  banking  and\r\n\r\nfinancial  sector will help in providing solutions\r\n\r\nto monetary problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should conditions be more or less as favourable\r\n\r\nas  in  the  last  five years,  our  economy  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  its robust rate of growth. The  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance should be able to meet its other  main\r\n\r\nobligation, to provide sufficient funds  to  other\r\n\r\nministries   for   their  current   as   well   as\r\n\r\ndevelopment needs. While changes in tax rates  and\r\n\r\nadditional  taxation may from  time  to  time,  be\r\n\r\nnecessary   or  desirable  to  effect  social   or\r\n\r\neconomic policies, continued economic growth  will\r\n\r\ngenerate  the increased funds to be made available\r\n\r\nto expanding ministries as in the past. As long as\r\n\r\nthe  economy  is  buoyant,  and  labour-management\r\n\r\nrelations sensible and reasonable, there  will  be\r\n\r\nno  need  to impose major or painful increases  in\r\n\r\ntax  rates. But it will be necessary to constantly\r\n\r\nreview the tax machinery to ensure a high level of\r\n\r\nefficiency,   particularly  to  ferret   out   tax\r\n\r\nevasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While rapid economic growth has given tax payers\r\n\r\nthe same tax rates for nearly seven years now,  it\r\n\r\nhas  created  a  major problem for the  government\r\n\r\nservices.  As  the  demand for skills  and  talent\r\n\r\nincreases, the problem of attracting and retaining\r\n\r\nhigh  calibre personnel in the government services\r\n\r\nhas become increasingly severe. It is necessary to\r\n\r\nreexamine  once  again the structure  of  pay  and\r\n\r\nservice  conditions  and to make  the  rewards  in\r\n\r\ncertain   departments,  ministries,   grades   and\r\n\r\nprofessions more comparable to what they  can  get\r\n\r\nin  the private sector. This is not a new problem.\r\n\r\nBut  whereas in the past we had resorted to ad hoc\r\n\r\nsolutions, it is now necessary to look for a  more\r\n\r\nfundamental and lasting solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently with increased rewards for, and\r\n\r\nconsequently    higher   costs   of,    Government\r\n\r\npersonnel,  it  will  be  necessary,  by   greater\r\n\r\nmechanisation, and computerisation, to  streamline\r\n\r\nthe   organisation  of  the  Government  and   the\r\n\r\nStatutory   Boards  to  increase  efficiency   and\r\n\r\nproductivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to achieve quality in jobs, homes,\r\n\r\nschools,   hospitals,  social   and   recreational\r\n\r\namenities, much more money will have to  be  spent\r\n\r\non  capital equipment, on more intensive and  more\r\n\r\nprolonged   training   of  skilled   workers   and\r\n\r\ntechnicians.  We  must  increase  our  capital  by\r\n\r\nadding  to it what foreign investors can bring  in\r\n\r\nby  way  of  machinery  and  foreign  exchange  in\r\n\r\nmanufacturing    industry   and   finance.    More\r\n\r\nexpenditure    will   go   into   educating    the\r\n\r\nprofessionals,  engineers, scientists,  especially\r\n\r\nin   Applied   Sciences,  computers  and   systems\r\n\r\nanalysis,   accountants,   architects,    doctors,\r\n\r\nmanagers, bankers, lawyers, economists, and  other\r\n\r\nprofessionals whose expertise is part  and  parcel\r\n\r\nof  an  industrial society.

The\r\n\r\nJapanese  Prime  Minister's  visit  to  Peking  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  in which 23 years of dogma that  Taiwan\r\n\r\nwas  China was thrown overboard showed how swiftly\r\n\r\nthey have changed their policies to meet a changed\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as conflict between the super powers\r\n\r\nthemselves  is  reduced, so their competition  for\r\n\r\npower   and  influence  will  sharpen   in   third\r\n\r\ncountries, in the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nSingapore is neutral and non-aligned insofar as we\r\n\r\nare  asked  to take sides between competing  power\r\n\r\nblocs or competing ideologies.

Perhaps\r\n\r\neventually a neutral Southeast Asia can be  agreed\r\n\r\nupon  and guaranteed by the major powers.

Moreover, the higher rates will\r\n\r\nraise  the home-owning capacity of workers. Up  to\r\n\r\nthis  month, 26,466 Central Provident Fund members\r\n\r\nhad  withdrawn 590,080,022 to purchase Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  and  Jurong  Town  Corporation\r\n\r\nflats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of joint consultative machinery\r\n\r\nin  all  enterprises  will be encouraged  so  that\r\n\r\nworkers   and   employers   can   understand   and\r\n\r\nappreciate one another's problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, with higher incomes, the worker will be\r\n\r\nencouraged to constantly improve his knowledge and\r\n\r\nskills, in adult and workers education courses and\r\n\r\nrefresher courses so that he can further  increase\r\n\r\nhis capacity in more productive labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Public Housing</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1960 two 5-year building programmes for\r\n\r\npublic   housing  have  been  completed  and   two\r\n\r\nsatellite    towns    --Queenstown     and     Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh--created. Altogether 137,000 units of  flats\r\n\r\nhad  been  completed by the end of 1971 and  about\r\n\r\n750,000 people (37 per cent of the population) are\r\n\r\nnow living in Housing and Development Board flats.\r\n\r\nThe  third 5-year building programme (1971-75) has\r\n\r\ncommenced and two new towns will be built at Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah  and Woodlands. The third 5-year  building\r\n\r\nprogramme will provide an additional 100,000 units\r\n\r\nof flats to house 500,000 more people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of allowing the use of Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund for the purchase of flats has  made\r\n\r\nit  possible  for many citizens to buy  their  own\r\n\r\nhomes. More than 40,000 families now own the flats\r\n\r\nthey   occupy.  However,  this  policy  has   also\r\n\r\nresulted  in  greater demand for HDB flats.  There\r\n\r\nare  now  70,000  applicants on the  waiting  list\r\n\r\n(47,000 to buy and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23,000 to rent). The Housing and Development Board\r\n\r\nwill  therefore speed up its present building rate\r\n\r\nof one flat every 26 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of higher incomes and higher CPF savings,\r\n\r\nwe  must  build almost twice as many units  as  we\r\n\r\nhave  built in the last five years. However,  with\r\n\r\neach unit averaging about twice the floorspace per\r\n\r\nunit, this means quadrupling the building capacity\r\n\r\nof  the  HDB  flats.  This must  be  done  without\r\n\r\nlowering  the quality of layout and planning.  The\r\n\r\nstandard of finish of the new high-rise flats from\r\n\r\nthe  outside,  in  the design and appearance,  and\r\n\r\ninside  for the occupants, must be good.  We  must\r\n\r\navoid  another sudden surge in demand for building\r\n\r\nmaterial  and construction workers,  which  a  few\r\n\r\nyears ago pushed building costs up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Housing and Development Board first\r\n\r\nbegan  building in 1960, the object was to provide\r\n\r\nhomes as quickly as possible with little attention\r\n\r\nbeing paid to the residents' needs for recreation.\r\n\r\nNow  that the back of the housing problem has been\r\n\r\nbroken,  the  Board  can  and  will  provide  more\r\n\r\nfacilities  for rest and recreation.  In  existing\r\n\r\nHDB estates more parks and swimming pools will  be\r\n\r\nprovided  where  there is land available.  In  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  a  sports complex including  four  swimming\r\n\r\npools  is  under construction. Additional swimming\r\n\r\npools  will  be built in Queenstown. New  swimming\r\n\r\npool   complexes  will  be  built   at   Henderson\r\n\r\nRoad/Jalan  Bukit  Merah, Bukit Ho  Swee,  Tanjong\r\n\r\nRhu/  Kallang Airport Estates, MacPherson  Estates\r\n\r\nand Kallang Basin Estates. The new housing estates\r\n\r\n(for example, Telok Blangah, Woodlands, Bedok  and\r\n\r\nAng  Mo  Kio) will be better planned and have  not\r\n\r\nonly  better designed and more comfortable  homes,\r\n\r\nbut  also  larger  open  spaces  and  more  parks,\r\n\r\nswimming  pools  and  sports complexes.  In  every\r\n\r\nneighbourhood,      well-equipped       children's\r\n\r\nplaygrounds will be provided in addition to sports\r\n\r\nfacilities,  such  as  basket-ball  and  badminton\r\n\r\ncourts.  Land  will  also be  set  aside  for  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  community  centres.  The  ground\r\n\r\nfloors  of  each block of flats will be  free  for\r\n\r\nindoor sports, like table tennis, and children  to\r\n\r\nplay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin.

People living in areas under clearance  will\r\n\r\nbe  temporarily inconvenienced by resettlement and\r\n\r\na  change  of  their habits in the old environment\r\n\r\nthey   have   got   accustomed  to.  Comprehensive\r\n\r\nplanning of urban renewal will be carried  out  to\r\n\r\nreduce inconvenience and hardship to a minimum. An\r\n\r\nUrban Renewal Authority will be established by 1st\r\n\r\nApril,  1973, to implement a systematic  programme\r\n\r\nof  redevelopment  of the Central  area  including\r\n\r\nhousing,    commercial   and   shopping   centres,\r\n\r\nentertainment  and  recreational  facilities,  car\r\n\r\nparking,  road traffic and pedestrian circulation,\r\n\r\nparks  and landscaped walkways. A new and gracious\r\n\r\ncity  will be created. At the same time, buildings\r\n\r\nand  monuments  of  historical  and  architectural\r\n\r\nvalue  are  being preserved and placed in  a  more\r\n\r\nattractive setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Condominium Housing</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many private housing estates of mainly terrace\r\n\r\nand  semi-detached houses have been built  in  the\r\n\r\npast. This type of development is wasteful in land\r\n\r\nuse  and  produces heavily built up and  congested\r\n\r\nareas entirely covered with roofs and tarmac  with\r\n\r\nlittle  open  space. The condominium  concept  was\r\n\r\nrecently  introduced to encourage  more  intensive\r\n\r\nuse of land for housing development by the private\r\n\r\nsector.  This  will  bring the prices  of  housing\r\n\r\nwithin the reach of many more of our citizens  and\r\n\r\ncomplement   the  efforts  of  the   Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board in providing more homes for  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Public Works</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public works projects in the construction and\r\n\r\nimprovement of roads, bridges, schools, hospitals,\r\n\r\nparks   and  playgrounds  will  continue   to   be\r\n\r\nimplemented.

Work on the stretch between  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar  and Jalan Eunos and the extension  to  Sims\r\n\r\nAvenue  has  been  completed,  the  section   from\r\n\r\nWhitley  Road to Jalan Anak Bukit is in  progress,\r\n\r\nincluding an underpass below Adams Road now  under\r\n\r\nconstruction.  Other  road  systems  at  Bendeemer\r\n\r\nRoad,   Jalan  Bukit  Merah,  Irwell  Bank   Road,\r\n\r\nPaterson  Road,  Grange  Road  and  Stevens   Road\r\n\r\nforming  key routes for traffic converging towards\r\n\r\nthe  Central  business district are being  widened\r\n\r\nand improved. Work on the major East Coast Parkway\r\n\r\non  the  east  coast  reclamation  site  has  also\r\n\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Garden City</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considerable progress has been made in developing\r\n\r\nSingapore into a Garden City through the  planting\r\n\r\nof   trees,   shrubs   and  other   plants   along\r\n\r\nthoroughfares,   road-sides,   traffic    islands,\r\n\r\nlandscaping  of  open spaces and the  building  of\r\n\r\nparks  and  gardens. This more pleasant and  green\r\n\r\nenvironment will be extended throughout  the  City\r\n\r\nCentre, the housing estates, suburbs and the rural\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's policy is to provide more parks for\r\n\r\nrest  and  recreation.  Major  parks  planned  and\r\n\r\nestablished  are  those at  Mount  Faber,  Kampong\r\n\r\nJava,  Tanah Merah and the Central Park at Canning\r\n\r\nRise.   About  one-third  or  500  acres  of   the\r\n\r\nreclaimed  land  along  the  East  Coast  will  be\r\n\r\nreserved for recreation to form a long stretch  of\r\n\r\ngreen  from  Bedok  to  Tanjong  Rhu  between  the\r\n\r\nproposed  major East Coast Parkway  and  the  sea.\r\n\r\nThis  stretch of about 10 kilometres of the  coast\r\n\r\nline  will be developed into the largest  park  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   with  beach  shelters,   toilets   and\r\n\r\nchanging rooms, children's playgrounds and  stalls\r\n\r\nproviding food and drinks. A large lagoon near the\r\n\r\nBedok  end  will  be  developed  into  a  seawater\r\n\r\nswimming  complex  with a capacity  equivalent  to\r\n\r\nthat  of  about  50 Olympic-sized swimming  pools.\r\n\r\nAbout  $10  million  will be spent  on  this  Park\r\n\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close co-ordination is maintained by the Parks\r\n\r\nand   Trees   Division  with  the  Urban   Renewal\r\n\r\nDepartment to ensure that small gardens  and  open\r\n\r\nspaces, pedestrian malls and landscaped walks  are\r\n\r\nincluded  in  urban  redevelopment  planning.  The\r\n\r\nStamford Canal along Orchard Road will be  covered\r\n\r\nover  and  developed into a landscaped  pedestrian\r\n\r\nmall  to  add beauty and colour to this  important\r\n\r\nthoroughfare.  As more high-rise buildings  sprout\r\n\r\nup  in the City, it is essential to have greenery,\r\n\r\ntrees,  small parks and open space to  temper  the\r\n\r\nharsh  concrete structures, and to give relief  in\r\n\r\nthe greenness of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Building Control</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new Building Control Division was created in\r\n\r\nFebruary   1972   to  streamline  procedures   for\r\n\r\nbuilding  plans approval and enforcement,  and  to\r\n\r\ndeal  effectively with problems arising  from  the\r\n\r\nrapid  expansion  of construction activities,  and\r\n\r\nalso  the  new technology connected with high-rise\r\n\r\nbuildings.

As\r\n\r\ndevelopment    of    housing,    industries    and\r\n\r\nurbanisation continue to encroach upon and  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  acreage of farmland, our farmers must  become\r\n\r\nmore  efficient and agricultural land must be made\r\n\r\nmore  productive.

The basic\r\n\r\nsolution is a lower birth rate. Then we can  raise\r\n\r\nour   standard   of  life  and  quality   of   the\r\n\r\nenvironment.  Accouchement fees, maternity  leave,\r\n\r\npriority points for homes will be so adjusted that\r\n\r\nthey  will  bring  about  the  ideal  of  the  two\r\n\r\nchildren  per  family. For the  Singapore  of  the\r\n\r\n1970's the third child is a luxury. The fourth and\r\n\r\nfifth  are  anti-social acts.

The highest priorities  are\r\n\r\nfor  those who have two or less children,  whether\r\n\r\nfor  their first flat, or for transfer to a better\r\n\r\nflat.  Families with three will drop  slightly  in\r\n\r\npriority.  Families with four or  more  will  have\r\n\r\nlittle  priority. This will be implemented  so  as\r\n\r\nnot  to  be harsh to those who already have  large\r\n\r\nfamilies.  But  after 9 1/2 months  from  today,  1st\r\n\r\nAugust,  1973, any addition to two children  means\r\n\r\ndeclining  priority in balloting for  purchase  or\r\n\r\nrentals  of  flats. Any increase  in  family  size\r\n\r\nbeyond  two will mean lower priority in  transfers\r\n\r\nto bigger flats, either for purchase or rentals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second 5-year National Family Planning\r\n\r\nProgramme  (1971-1975) is  directed  at  two  main\r\n\r\ntarget groups: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The between 15 per cent to 18 per cent of\r\n\r\nmarried  women known as the \"hard core\"  belonging\r\n\r\nto  the low income and high parity groups who have\r\n\r\nnot taken to family planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The newly weds whose numbers have increased\r\n\r\nsignificantly.

We\r\n\r\nneed  never  face  the high degree  of  danger  to\r\n\r\npublic  health  that is threatening  some  of  the\r\n\r\npolluted  cities of the industrial countries.  But\r\n\r\nwe  must  deal,  now, firmly and  rationally  with\r\n\r\npollution.  National  development  and   pollution\r\n\r\ncontrol must go hand in hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep up the quality of the environment in the\r\n\r\nface  of industrialisation and urbanisation  means\r\n\r\nconsiderable  planning and  expenditure  on  anti-pollution.\r\n\r\nAs incomes go up, so does consumption.\r\n\r\nThere  will  be more high-rise flats,  more  cars,\r\n\r\nbuses and taxis, more refuse and garbage from each\r\n\r\nhousehold,  glass bottles, plastic containers  and\r\n\r\nother  waste.  More electricity will be  generated\r\n\r\nfor  more  factories and homes, i.e, more  sulphur\r\n\r\ndioxide belching from power stations and soot  and\r\n\r\nchemical  dust  from  factory chimneys.  There  is\r\n\r\nincreasing   pollution  from  the  expanding   oil\r\n\r\nrefineries,  both in the southern islands  and  on\r\n\r\nSingapore itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must take steps now to prevent a deterioration\r\n\r\ninto  a  Tokyo-type situation. The air we  breathe\r\n\r\nmust  be  clean.  The  noise of  traffic,  radios,\r\n\r\ntelevision,  and rumbling machines,  must  be  cut\r\n\r\ndown. Most important of all, the pollution of  our\r\n\r\nwater through domestic or industrial waste running\r\n\r\ninto  open drains must be stopped, as soon  as  is\r\n\r\ntechnically and economically possible. Rain  water\r\n\r\nmust   be   collected  unpolluted   for   domestic\r\n\r\nconsumption.    Several   big,   new    impounding\r\n\r\nreservoirs are in the course of construction.  The\r\n\r\ncosts  are  high. But they cannot be  avoided.  We\r\n\r\ncannot have our reservoirs filled up with polluted\r\n\r\nwater. Every factory has been, and is being, given\r\n\r\nenough  time to install measures to cut  down  the\r\n\r\ndeleterious substances that they discharge  either\r\n\r\ninto  open  drains  or into sewers.

All domestic waste water\r\n\r\nfrom  kitchens, from the washing of  clothes,  and\r\n\r\nfrom  bathrooms must go into sewers, and not  into\r\n\r\nopen drains. Over 6,000 pig sties and chicken-runs\r\n\r\nin  the  catchment areas of Pandan, Kranji,  Bedok\r\n\r\nand   Seletar   reservoirs   will   have   to   be\r\n\r\nreconstructed  so that waste from pigs  and  other\r\n\r\nanimals will go into sewers and do not pollute the\r\n\r\nrain water that falls in the catchment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must do this for all of us, not for any\r\n\r\nsectional  or privileged groups. Most  people  are\r\n\r\naware  of  these  grave  continuing  problems.  We\r\n\r\ncannot   allow  these  problems  to  become   more\r\n\r\ncomplicated,   by   dithering   or   balking    at\r\n\r\ntemporarily  unpopular measures. The  consequences\r\n\r\nof  not inconveniencing the polluter, now,  is  to\r\n\r\nface a grave or even critical position in five  to\r\n\r\nseven years' time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Water resources</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management and development of our water\r\n\r\nresources  will  be  better  coordinated  under  a\r\n\r\nsingle Ministry.

The\r\n\r\nimportance  of well-planned and executed  sewerage\r\n\r\nprojects cannot be over-emphasised. It is  one  of\r\n\r\nthe   major  long  term  solutions  to  our  water\r\n\r\npollution and conservation problem.

More\r\n\r\nmachines  will  be  acquired. In  the  process  of\r\n\r\nmechanisation, the upgrading of the skill  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers  is  necessary for these machines  to  be\r\n\r\nmaintained and used efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Hawkers</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magnitude and complexity of the hawker\r\n\r\nproblem  is  seen  in the numbers,  diversity  and\r\n\r\ndispersion of hawkers in the city centre,  in  the\r\n\r\nrural districts, in public and private housing and\r\n\r\nindustrial estates. The socio-economic grounds for\r\n\r\ntheir  existence  in Singapore is recognised.  The\r\n\r\npresent  programme of building markets and  hawker\r\n\r\ncentres  to  resite licensed street  hawkers  into\r\n\r\nhygienic and pollution-free surroundings  will  be\r\n\r\nextended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both public authorities and private developers\r\n\r\nhave  to consider the building of suitable  indoor\r\n\r\naccommodation to serve hawker-type food. It is  an\r\n\r\nessential  social  amenity to domestic  residents,\r\n\r\nfactory and office workers, and, `others.  Such  a\r\n\r\nprogramme will quickly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimprove the existing street hawker conditions  and\r\n\r\nforestall graver problems for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After spending large sums of public and private\r\n\r\nfunds   we   should  not  be  frustrated   by   an\r\n\r\nuncontrolled proliferation of illegal hawkers,  or\r\n\r\nby   a  lowering  of  personal  and  food  hygiene\r\n\r\nstandards.  The Ministry will educate hawkers  and\r\n\r\nenforce public health standards. At the same  time\r\n\r\nfirm  action  will  be  taken  against  unlicensed\r\n\r\nhawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Air Pollution</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should now be more careful in the types of\r\n\r\nindustries  that  are  allowed.  Heavy   pollution\r\n\r\nindustries   will   not   be   allowed.   Existing\r\n\r\nindustries  which are causing too  much  pollution\r\n\r\nwill  have  to install anti-pollution devices,  or\r\n\r\nthey will have to move elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city area, there will be more intensive\r\n\r\nsurveillance  to  control  emissions  from   motor\r\n\r\nvehicles.  Noisy  and old motor vehicles,  whether\r\n\r\nprivate  or commercial vehicles or buses or  taxis\r\n\r\nmust be gradually eliminated. This will reduce the\r\n\r\nnoise  level  in  the city areas. New  regulations\r\n\r\nwill  be made to control carbon monoxide and other\r\n\r\nresidual  pollutants from exhausts to improve  the\r\n\r\nair.  Most  cities  of  the  developed  world  are\r\n\r\nalready doing this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, as a further step, certain industries and\r\n\r\ntrade premises in the city areas will have to  use\r\n\r\nlow  sulphur fuel oil or gas. This will reduce the\r\n\r\nemission of smoke and sulphur dioxide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open burning of domestic and industrial refuse\r\n\r\nalso  adds  to  the  pollution of  the  air.  This\r\n\r\npractice will have to be controlled and regulated.\r\n\r\nEither  the wastes go into incinerators,  or  they\r\n\r\nare  used for the manufacture of by-products, e.g.\r\n\r\nsawdust to hard board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Cemeteries</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conserve land, particularly in the urban\r\n\r\nareas,  cemeteries in and around the city will  be\r\n\r\nclosed.  There  will  be  extensions  to  existing\r\n\r\npublic  cemeteries in the Chua Chu Kang  area  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment of new cemeteries in other areas.  But\r\n\r\ncremation  is  the  long  term  solution.

The  \"Music  for\r\n\r\nEveryone\"   and  \"Art  for  Everyone\"  series   of\r\n\r\nconcerts  and  art exhibitions will be  continued.\r\n\r\nThe  stress  will  continue  to  be  put  on  mass\r\n\r\nparticipation in the fields of aesthetjc  creation\r\n\r\nand appreciation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radio and Television Singapore will continue to\r\n\r\nprovide services to inform,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentertain and educate.

We\r\n\r\nmust  stimulate  the  younger  generation  to   be\r\n\r\nconscious  of  the world around us,  and  our  own\r\n\r\nhardwon advances they must protect. The mass media\r\n\r\nboth Government and private must help to inculcate\r\n\r\nthe  virtues  of  patriotism,  pride  in  national\r\n\r\neffort and achievement, and the importance of team-work\r\n\r\nand national endeavour so necessary for group\r\n\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Library has greatly expanded its\r\n\r\nrange  of  facilities. It has a role  to  play  in\r\n\r\nencouraging   the  habit  of  wide  reading,   and\r\n\r\ncultivating  an  enquiring mind  among  our  young\r\n\r\nthrough  making available a wide range of journals\r\n\r\nand publications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Association will concentrate on\r\n\r\nsocial  and recreational programmes. More  holiday\r\n\r\naccommodation will be provided for the people.  It\r\n\r\nwill  also  aim  at variety in its activities  for\r\n\r\nyouths. Several new community centres will have to\r\n\r\nbe  built  to  cater for an increasing  number  of\r\n\r\nthose  who  are interested in making the  most  of\r\n\r\ntheir  leisure time, especially those in  the  new\r\n\r\nsatellite  towns. Only by better and new  premises\r\n\r\nand   amenities   can  the  People's   Association\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  contribute  to  social  cohesion  by\r\n\r\nbringing  together  all  sectors  of  society   to\r\n\r\nparticipate in common activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Museum, which has now come under this\r\n\r\nMinistry,  is  being  re-organised  as  a  display\r\n\r\ncentre   devoted   to   the   art,   history   and\r\n\r\nanthropology  of the peoples of this  region.  The\r\n\r\nart collection of the University of Singapore will\r\n\r\nsoon be made more accessible to' the public by its\r\n\r\ntransfer to the National Museum at Stamford Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF SOCIAL AFFAIRS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any society, social deviants can always be\r\n\r\nfound.

With\r\n\r\nindustrialisation and urbanisation,  the  pressure\r\n\r\nof life is increasing. The traditional stabilising\r\n\r\nforces of social control in our Asian culture  are\r\n\r\nupset  in  parts.  There is  a  tendency  for  new\r\n\r\npatterns  of  crime  and  delinquency  of  a  more\r\n\r\nsophisticated nature to emerge. Their control will\r\n\r\ndepend  upon how the Government and all of  us  in\r\n\r\nthe  community can take preventive action to  keep\r\n\r\nthe  family unit from loosening. Parental care and\r\n\r\ncontrol  over  their  teenage  children  must  not\r\n\r\ndeteriorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already planned for the\r\n\r\ngeneral  strengthening of the existing  system  of\r\n\r\nsocial   welfare  for  the  proper  care  of   the\r\n\r\ndestitute,  the handicapped and others  not  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to take care of themselves or to be taken\r\n\r\ncare  of  by  relatives and friends.
