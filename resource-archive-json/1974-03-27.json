Prior   to   April,    1972,    the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications  Department  was  a  Government\r\n\r\ndepartment  providing  external  telecommunication\r\n\r\nservices while the Singapore Telephone Board was a\r\n\r\nStatutory    organisation    providing    domestic\r\n\r\ntelephone services. With very high rates of growth\r\n\r\nand fast changing technology in communications, it\r\n\r\nwas clear that radical changes in the organisation\r\n\r\nand  management  were required to  cope  with  the\r\n\r\ndevelopments and challenges in the years ahead. An\r\n\r\nexpert  from  the International Telecommunications\r\n\r\nUnion was therefore invited to advise the Ministry\r\n\r\non the reorganisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   the   telecommunication  services   and   his\r\n\r\nrecommendation  was  that  the  Telecommunications\r\n\r\nDepartment  should be converted into  a  statutory\r\n\r\norganisation. This recommendation was accepted and\r\n\r\nimplemented   on   1st  April,  1972,   with   the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Department becoming a statutory\r\n\r\nbody  known as the Telecommunication Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore (TAS).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to provide for the second stage\r\n\r\nof  reorganisation,  namely,  the  merger  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore     Telephone     Board     with     the\r\n\r\nTelecommunication Authority of  Singapore  into  a\r\n\r\nsingle   organisation   to   be   known   as   the\r\n\r\nTelecommunication  Authority  of  Singapore   (new\r\n\r\nTAS),    i.e, both   domestic   and    external\r\n\r\ntelecommunications are to work as one and  not  as\r\n\r\ntwo separate entities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now summarise the main features of this\r\n\r\nBill.   The   Bill   essentially   re-enacts   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Singapore Telephone  Board  Act\r\n\r\nand  the  Telecommunication Authority of Singapore\r\n\r\nAct, 1972, both of which will be repealed. The new\r\n\r\nTAS shall consist of a Chairman, a General Manager\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  less than five and not more than seven  other\r\n\r\nmembers  all  of  whom shall be appointed  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new TAS shall have the exclusive privilege of\r\n\r\noperating   telecommunication  services   in   the\r\n\r\nRepublic and, in addition to the functions of  the\r\n\r\nexisting  TAS, the new TAS will also  perform  the\r\n\r\nfunctions  of the STB. There are pro, visions  for\r\n\r\nthe appointment of staff and the appointment of  a\r\n\r\nGeneral  Manager.  The General Manager  is  to  be\r\n\r\nappointed  by  the TAS with the  approval  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  and  will  be  chief  executive  of  the\r\n\r\norganisation.  The persons presently  employed  by\r\n\r\nthe STB or TAS shall be transferred to the service\r\n\r\nof the new TAS on the same terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new TAS will be empowered to raise funds by\r\n\r\nthe  issue  of stocks or loans from banks  and  to\r\n\r\nlevy  charges, rates and fees. The  new  TAS  will\r\n\r\nacquire the existing assets and liabilities of the\r\n\r\nSTB and TAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new TAS has power to acquire land and to\r\n\r\nenter   upon   land  for  the   purpose   of   its\r\n\r\ninstallations, and compensation is payable for the\r\n\r\nexercise of such powers. The accounts of  the  new\r\n\r\nTAS shall he audited by the Auditor-General or  by\r\n\r\nan   auditor   appointed  by   the   Minister   in\r\n\r\nconsultation with the Auditor-General. The audited\r\n\r\naccounts  as  well as the annual report  shall  be\r\n\r\npresented to Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new TAS will be commanding substantial\r\n\r\nmanpower   of  over  5,000  staff  and   financial\r\n\r\nresources  exceeding $150 million in annual  gross\r\n\r\nrevenue.  With  such resources and  an  integrated\r\n\r\norganisation,   we   can  expect   more   vigorous\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  increase  in efficiency  and  higher\r\n\r\nquality  of telecommunication services. To  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our  Republic will continue to be a  leading\r\n\r\ncommunication centre, the new TAS will continually\r\n\r\nkeep  abreast of latest technological  innovations\r\n\r\nand  developments. Hon. Members may wish  to  note\r\n\r\nthat  a  five-year  development programme  costing\r\n\r\nmore  than $560 million has already been  prepared\r\n\r\nfor implementation by the new TAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to add\r\n\r\nthat all necessary steps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  been  taken to ensure that the  merger  will\r\n\r\nproceed  as smoothly as possible, and an extensive\r\n\r\ninternal reorganisation has already been put  into\r\n\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere are instances where occupants of offices and\r\n\r\ncommercial   buildings   which   are   ready   for\r\n\r\noccupation  have  to  wait  for  months  for   the\r\n\r\nprovision of telephone services. Clause 6  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  says that it shall be the function and  duty\r\n\r\nof  the Authority to provide, operate and maintain\r\n\r\na  good  and sufficient telecommunication service,\r\n\r\nand  also  to promote the economic development  of\r\n\r\nthe  telecommunication service in accordance  with\r\n\r\npublic  demand. I also note that clause 6 (1)  (f)\r\n\r\nprovides   for   the   further   advancement    of\r\n\r\ntelecommunication technology and  the  development\r\n\r\nof  telecommunication in Singapore in co-operation\r\n\r\nwith the broadcasting and television authority and\r\n\r\ntertiary technical institutions. I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsee closer co-ordination and also streamlining  of\r\n\r\nthe  administrative structure of the Authority  to\r\n\r\nensure  that this long wait for telephone services\r\n\r\nis  avoided.  As we know, in the past the  reasons\r\n\r\nusually given to applicants for the long wait  are\r\n\r\neither there are no spare lines available or there\r\n\r\nis  a  shortage  of  equipment. Because  of  this,\r\n\r\ncommercial  premises  without  telephone  services\r\n\r\nare, therefore, in many cases left unoccupied  for\r\n\r\nmonths  because they are unsuitable  for  business\r\n\r\noperations  although they are  certified  fit  for\r\n\r\noccupation  in  every  respect.  I  am  sure   the\r\n\r\nMinister will agree that this state of affairs  is\r\n\r\nobviously undesirable because it means a waste  of\r\n\r\nusable  facilities  and  also  a  restriction   of\r\n\r\ncommercial activities. I would, therefore, like to\r\n\r\nsee  this  part  of  the administrative  structure\r\n\r\nstreamlined in the new Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> Sir, I would like to assure the\r\n\r\nhon.

But I would like\r\n\r\nthe Member to note that the increase in the number\r\n\r\nof  telephones  installed has  been  averaging  at\r\n\r\nabout  14 per cent per annum. This is a very  high\r\n\r\nrate of growth compared with the world average  of\r\n\r\nabout 8 per cent. So it is sometimes difficult  to\r\n\r\nmeet   immediate  demands  and   some   delay   is\r\n\r\nunavoidable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - (Dr Ang Kok Peng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee: reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Environment (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That\r\n\r\nthe Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of the Environment is now\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  administering the  Environmental\r\n\r\nPublic Health Act (Cap. 155). Prior to the setting\r\n\r\nup  of this Ministry, the Act was administered  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Health, and the Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nPublic    Health   was   responsible    for    its\r\n\r\nadministration subject to the supervision  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Health Authority established under section\r\n\r\n3   of   the  Act.  The  Public  Health  Authority\r\n\r\ncomprises the Director of Medical Services and the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Director of Medical Services of the Public\r\n\r\nHealth  Division, Ministry of Health.  Both  these\r\n\r\noffices are no longer directly concerned with  the\r\n\r\nadministration  of  the  Act.

Various  amendments,  as  were   found\r\n\r\nnecessary have, since then, been made to the  Act,\r\n\r\nthe  last  one  being  in  1970.  Experience  has,\r\n\r\nhowever, shown that the provisions of the Act  are\r\n\r\nstill inadequate, particularly in relation to  the\r\n\r\nsections concerning the publication of newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a permit is still required for the\r\n\r\nprinting  or  publication of a  newspaper,  recent\r\n\r\nevents  have shown that it is possible for foreign\r\n\r\nelements  to  gain control of our newspapers,  and\r\n\r\nuse  them  for their own ends against our national\r\n\r\ninterest.  There  is, therefore, need  to  further\r\n\r\namend  and  update  this Act to  meet  present-day\r\n\r\nrequirements. Under the provisions of the existing\r\n\r\nAct,  as it stands today, foreign interests  could\r\n\r\nobtain  control  of  any  newspaper  printed   and\r\n\r\npublished  in  Singapore.  This  is  obviously  an\r\n\r\nunhealthy situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May, 1971, for example, the \"Eastern Sun\", an\r\n\r\nEnglish    language    newspaper    closed    down\r\n\r\nvoluntarily, following exposure by the  Government\r\n\r\nof  its  having received subventions amounting  to\r\n\r\nnearly  HK$8 million from a Communist intelligence\r\n\r\nagency   in  Hong-kong.  The  \"Singapore  Herald\",\r\n\r\nanother English language newspaper, which was also\r\n\r\nfinanced   with   funds  from   foreign   sources,\r\n\r\nconducted a campaign to mis-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlead the  people  of  Singapore  especially   the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated. The Government  had,  therefore,\r\n\r\nin 1971, to withdraw its publication permit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would be failing in our duty and\r\n\r\nresponsibility to the people of Singapore,  if  we\r\n\r\ndo not protect our citizens from the manipulations\r\n\r\nof   subversive  or  hostile  elements,  operating\r\n\r\nthrough  our  newspapers. Although newspapers  are\r\n\r\ncommercial  organisations,  they  have  a  special\r\n\r\nresponsibility to the society they cater for. They\r\n\r\nhave  a  duty to always bear in mind their  social\r\n\r\nand political obligations because, as a medium  of\r\n\r\ncommunication,  their influence  can  be  crucial.\r\n\r\nSingapore, therefore, cannot allow foreign control\r\n\r\nof  any  of its newspapers, that is to say,  those\r\n\r\noverseas  who may seek to manipulate or  influence\r\n\r\npublic  opinion  through  this  media.  We  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to have \"black operations\" mounted against\r\n\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of the Bill before us is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  to  make a substantial change  of  the\r\n\r\nPrinting Presses Act to ensure that newspapers are\r\n\r\nnot  used as instruments of subversion. Precaution\r\n\r\nmust  be taken to prevent the newspaper from being\r\n\r\nused  to  poison  the  minds  of  its  readers  by\r\n\r\nreporting  news  in a biased way or  to  reproduce\r\n\r\npropaganda  material  \"lifted\"  or  cut  out  from\r\n\r\nnewspapers controlled by foreign countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, while it is necessary to ensure that control\r\n\r\nof  our  newspapers remain in  the  hands  of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens,  the Government also does  not  wish  to\r\n\r\nupset   the  commercial  operations  of  newspaper\r\n\r\ncompanies,  or  intervene  in  the  market  forces\r\n\r\ndetermining   the  value  of  their   shares.   We\r\n\r\ncertainly do not want to get involved in the  day-to-day  running of newspapers. Management will  be\r\n\r\nfree  to  operate  the  newspapers  as  commercial\r\n\r\nenterprises, provided they ensure that there is no\r\n\r\nmanipulation  by  foreign  elements  and  that  no\r\n\r\nattempt is made by them, or through their proxies,\r\n\r\nto     glorify    undesirable    viewpoints    and\r\n\r\nphilosophies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is against this backdrop that\r\n\r\nI  have  introduced  the  Newspaper  and  Printing\r\n\r\nPresses Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  Bill  seeks  to re-enact, with  additions  or\r\n\r\namendments,  certain provisions  of  the  Printing\r\n\r\nPresses  Act  (Chapter 258). I do not  propose  to\r\n\r\ntake the House through the entire Bill, clause  by\r\n\r\nclause,   as  many  of  the  provisions  are   re-enactments  of  the existing Act.  I  would  like,\r\n\r\nhowever, to touch on some of the salient points of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permits will still be required for the printing\r\n\r\nand  publication of newspapers, but all  newspaper\r\n\r\ncompanies will have to go public, unless there  is\r\n\r\nsome  special  difficulty, perhaps on  account  of\r\n\r\nsize  in going public. In such cases, the Minister\r\n\r\nwill be empowered to grant special exemptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All newspapers will have to be locally managed;\r\n\r\nthe  members of the Board of Management will  have\r\n\r\nto be Singapore citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a newspaper company, there will be two\r\n\r\nclasses  of shares, namely, management shares  and\r\n\r\nordinary shares. There is, no restriction  to  the\r\n\r\nownership  of ordinary shares; however, the  issue\r\n\r\nand  transfer of management shares must  have  the\r\n\r\napproval  of the Minister, and such approval  will\r\n\r\nonly be given to citizens of Singapore, or to such\r\n\r\ncorporations which have been granted  approval  by\r\n\r\nthe Minister. This arrangement is necessary, since\r\n\r\nthe  total voting rights of the management  shares\r\n\r\nis greater than that of the ordinary shares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All foreign investments injected into the\r\n\r\nnewspaper  must have the approval of the Minister;\r\n\r\nthis  is to ensure that the Government is not kept\r\n\r\nin  the  dark  as  regards the real  ownership  of\r\n\r\ncapital  of  newspapers. In this way, we  will  be\r\n\r\nable   to  ensure  that  the  management  of   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  will  always be in the  hands  of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens, and the policies also determined by  our\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be appreciated that ample notice has been\r\n\r\ngiven   to  the  newspapers  of  the  Government's\r\n\r\nintention to make major Singapore newspapers to go\r\n\r\npublic  -  in fact, that indication was  given  as\r\n\r\nearly  as January last year. However, in order  to\r\n\r\nensure that there will be adequate opportunity for\r\n\r\nall interested\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nparties   to  air  their  views  and   make   such\r\n\r\nrepresentation  as they might deem necessary,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  decided to send this  Bill  to  a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, it is not the intention\r\n\r\nof  Government to interfere unduly in the  affairs\r\n\r\nof the Press. The sole purpose is to safeguard our\r\n\r\nnational  interest  and  the  well-being  of   our\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I support the main provisions of the\r\n\r\nBill  to  make it law that all Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\ncan  have  a  right to fashion the policy  of  the\r\n\r\nnewspaper. This is in line with the argument  that\r\n\r\nif  one's survival depends on keeping the boat  on\r\n\r\nan   even  keel  as  it  charts  its  way  through\r\n\r\nunpredictable seas, then it is in the interest  of\r\n\r\nthat   person  not  to  provoke  any  kind  of   a\r\n\r\ndisequilibrium of the boat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Singapore context, Sir, a responsible\r\n\r\nnewspaper  is a critical factor in the  well-being\r\n\r\nof  the nation. The newspaper provides information\r\n\r\nupon  which members of our society conduct intense\r\n\r\ncommunication among themselves, between themselves\r\n\r\nand  the  Government, form impressions,  construct\r\n\r\nconvictions  and make decisions. It is imperative,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  as far as is reasonably  possible  and\r\n\r\ndemocratically feasible, that news and information\r\n\r\noffered  by  the  newspaper are  responsible  news\r\n\r\nresulting  from  the responsible policies  of  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  comprising  responsible  citizens   of\r\n\r\nSingapore, whose stakes are in this country and in\r\n\r\nthis  country  only. In a world of  super  powers,\r\n\r\nsuper   nationalisms  and  monolithic   commercial\r\n\r\norganisations, Sir, which contend  for  power  and\r\n\r\nprofit,  Singapore  is  a consideration  in  their\r\n\r\nstrategy of operations, and in my view the  sooner\r\n\r\nwe  rise up to this fact, the sooner will we begin\r\n\r\nto ensure our own national security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also support, Sir, the committal of this Bill\r\n\r\nto Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the whole intention of this Bill may\r\n\r\nbe  summed up in one sentence, that is, in  future\r\n\r\nnewspapers  in  Singapore  will  only  be  run  by\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens  with the  permission  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister in charge. As the Bill stands, the  whole\r\n\r\nspirit  of the Bill lies in Part III, which  gives\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  very extensive powers, particularly\r\n\r\nin clause 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appointment of directors on the board must be\r\n\r\napproved  by the Minister. But the Bill  does  not\r\n\r\nprovide  how  any  citizen  of  Singapore  can  be\r\n\r\napproved  by  the  Minister  to  be  a  holder  of\r\n\r\nmanagement  shares.  It  does  not  say   how   an\r\n\r\napplication is to be made, whether it should be on\r\n\r\na specified form or whether it is to be by letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of funds, of course, we can\r\n\r\nprevent  a local newspaper from obtaining  foreign\r\n\r\nsources  of  finance. But we  cannot  control  the\r\n\r\ncontent  of the newspapers, and therefore  we  may\r\n\r\nnot prevent incidents similar to what had happened\r\n\r\nbefore, and certain undesirable events may  happen\r\n\r\nagain.  We have seen incidents in Sri Lanka  which\r\n\r\nwere  mainly  due  to newspaper  influences.  Now,\r\n\r\nthere  are embassies and consulates in our  midst,\r\n\r\nand   they   can   pay  substantial   amounts   on\r\n\r\nadvertisements to publicise through the newspapers\r\n\r\nany  article of a political content, such  as  how\r\n\r\ngreat a certain political machinery or thought is,\r\n\r\nwhat  it  has produced, and what a great personage\r\n\r\nthe ruler is, etc. This is very dangerous. Once we\r\n\r\nhave  diplomatic  relations with  more  countries,\r\n\r\nmore  embassies and consulates will be set  up  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and every one of them  can  by  paying\r\n\r\nadvertisement  charges  publicise  in  our   local\r\n\r\nnewspapers  as  to  how  great  are  their   great\r\n\r\npolitical  leaders, how good are  their  political\r\n\r\nsystems, and so on. Under such circumstances, with\r\n\r\na multi-racial setup as ours, would it be good for\r\n\r\nSingapore?  They can carry across  their  messages\r\n\r\nthrough such advertisements and publicity  in  our\r\n\r\nnewspapers.    Even   underground   agencies    or\r\n\r\nundesirable  elements can also  make  use  of  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  to convey their message if  they  want\r\n\r\nto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister has said in his speech that\r\n\r\nthe  intention  of  the Bill  is  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nnewspapers  in Singapore will in future  be  under\r\n\r\nthe  control  of Singapore citizens, but  it  also\r\n\r\ndoes  not  wish to upset the commercial operations\r\n\r\nof   newspaper   companies.   But   a   commercial\r\n\r\nestablishment  does  not usually  care  very  much\r\n\r\nabout  politics, social conscience  or  any  other\r\n\r\nthing except profits. So a newspaper can publicise\r\n\r\narticles to suit some people with ulterior motive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now refer to clause 11 of Part III. This\r\n\r\napplies   only  to  any  newspaper  published   at\r\n\r\nintervals not exceeding one week. In other  words,\r\n\r\nif a newspaper is published less than once a week,\r\n\r\nsay,  every  eight days, once a month  or  longer,\r\n\r\nsuch   a  newspaper  can  be  exempted  from   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Part. If that is the case, then\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of this Bill may be defeated.  So  I\r\n\r\nhope   this  aspect  of  the  Bill  will  be  well\r\n\r\nconsidered by the Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the management shares being in the hands of\r\n\r\nour  citizens,  as  I  have pointed  out,  certain\r\n\r\npublicity can still go through the newspaper,  and\r\n\r\nthey  may  not effectively exercise their  control\r\n\r\nthrough  the means as provided. Now there  is  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion  of establishing a Press  Council,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Foreign Affairs has spoken about\r\n\r\nit.  Perhaps  this Press Council can provide  some\r\n\r\nguidance  for  the newspapers. However,  with  all\r\n\r\nthese  provisions, anybody, including a journalist\r\n\r\nor  a  citizen, if he wants to, can still exercise\r\n\r\nsubversive influence through the newspaper.  So  I\r\n\r\nhope the Select Committee can look into this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to support, in principle, the introduction of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill. I think it is unquestionable that  the\r\n\r\nspirit and intention of the Bill is good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would just like to add my own comments\r\n\r\non what I feel are the important points. There are\r\n\r\nprovisions in this Bill for reference to  be  made\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister, and giving the Minister certain\r\n\r\npowers  to  decide. This is, I  am  sure,  a  good\r\n\r\npoint.  But  what I would caution  as  a  possible\r\n\r\nreaction is that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na decision of the Minister might be interpreted as\r\n\r\npartial  or  biased at times. I  do  not  wish  to\r\n\r\nquestion the Minister on this point, but I am just\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that  the  number  of  references   or\r\n\r\nprovisions allowing reference to the Minister  may\r\n\r\nby  itself create a problem and misinterpretation.\r\n\r\nI  think it is important for us to realise that in\r\n\r\nSingapore today we have a great desire and a  need\r\n\r\nfor a constructive and responsible press. This  is\r\n\r\none laudable objective. The second is that we have\r\n\r\nto  ensure  and provide for adequate  measures  to\r\n\r\nprevent  subversive activities  or  subversion  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  through the mass media.  To  meet  this\r\n\r\nend, this Bill is appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that there is a\r\n\r\npossible  side effect of this Bill. But it  is  my\r\n\r\nhope  that the measures contained in the Bill will\r\n\r\nnot lead to a curbing of genuine public expression\r\n\r\nto  the  extent  of stifling a healthy  debate  on\r\n\r\nissues  of  national  and  international  interest\r\n\r\nthrough the mass media. I think this point has  to\r\n\r\nbe  taken  very seriously and I am sure  that  the\r\n\r\nHon.  Minister  has this point  in  mind  when  he\r\n\r\ndecided to commit this Bill to a public hearing. I\r\n\r\ngive him my whole-hearted support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments and reservation, I wish to\r\n\r\nexpress  once  again my support for the  Newspaper\r\n\r\nand Printing Presses Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I fully support this  Bill.  In  my\r\n\r\nview,  this Bill is one way to deal with the entry\r\n\r\nof  \"devils\" and \"demons\" from foreign  countries,\r\n\r\nas our cultural ballast is too weak at the moment.\r\n\r\nWe  can  still see newspapers glorifying the  fads\r\n\r\nand    fetishes    of   the   West,    emphasising\r\n\r\nindividualism.  While some girls wear  mini-skirts\r\n\r\nto  show  off  their thighs without any  sense  of\r\n\r\nshame, others wear the maxis which are long enough\r\n\r\nto  drag  along  the road, without realising  that\r\n\r\ntheir  skirts will be dirtied. All these fads  and\r\n\r\nfetishes  and  fashions have been  played  up  and\r\n\r\nglorified through the medium of the newspapers.

I do  not  know  the\r\n\r\nactual  meaning behind all this. If this state  of\r\n\r\naffairs is allowed to continue, it will perpetuate\r\n\r\nthe    contradictions,    anomalies    and    even\r\n\r\nanachronisms  in Singapore. All these anachronisms\r\n\r\nand   contradictions  can  be  made  use  of   and\r\n\r\nexploited  by  ambitious  elements  from   foreign\r\n\r\nsources,  as pointed out by the Minister  when  he\r\n\r\nsaid that there was an attempt at exploitation  of\r\n\r\nnewspapers through black operations. But  for  the\r\n\r\ntimely   decision  taken  to  deal  with  such   a\r\n\r\nsituation, I am afraid the stability of Singapore,\r\n\r\nand even this House, would have changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a country like Singapore, which is\r\n\r\nsubject  to foreign influences, we must  build  up\r\n\r\nour  own  culture  through  a  selection  of  good\r\n\r\nforeign  cultural influences. Of course,  this  is\r\n\r\neasier said than done. It is, therefore, necessary\r\n\r\nto  institute measures such as those  provided  in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill, introduced by the Minister.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, this Bill seeks to transfer the control  of\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers from some private hands  into  the\r\n\r\nhands  of  Singapore citizens. By these  means  we\r\n\r\nwould  be able to resist the interference by  some\r\n\r\nambitious foreign elements. Furthermore, I  should\r\n\r\nalso  point  out  that  when a  private  newspaper\r\n\r\nenterprise  is  controlled by  a  small  group  of\r\n\r\npeople,  the  journalists  are  already  known  to\r\n\r\nsuffer  badly. Newspaper business is a  profitable\r\n\r\none.  The leading Chinese newspapers make millions\r\n\r\nof  dollars' profit per annum, but the journalists\r\n\r\nin  such newspaper establishments, i.e, those  who\r\n\r\nhave  to  crack their heads and rack their brains,\r\n\r\nhave not been properly remunerated. They have also\r\n\r\nnot been allowed to have a share in the profits of\r\n\r\nthe  business. As the Member for Delta has pointed\r\n\r\nout,  we  should be able to improve the conditions\r\n\r\nof service of the journalists in Singapore through\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of a Press Council or any  such\r\n\r\nbody.  Only then will journalists in Singapore  be\r\n\r\nable  to  do  a  better job  in  the  service  and\r\n\r\ninterest of our nation,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   also   to  enrich  our  cultural   heritage.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in view of this, I fully support  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take this opportunity to\r\n\r\npropose  to  the  Government that apart  from  the\r\n\r\nnegative  approach to control by  getting  rid  of\r\n\r\nundesirable influences, we should also  adopt  the\r\n\r\npositive  approach  for support  of  our  cultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment. For example, the Ministry of  Culture\r\n\r\nis  now publishing the Mirror and also a radio and\r\n\r\ntelevision magazine. However, I do not think  this\r\n\r\nis  adequate.  Therefore, apart  from  the  annual\r\n\r\nreports,  which  are inadequate, other  Government\r\n\r\nMinistries   and  statutory  bodies  should   also\r\n\r\npublish magazines containing materials of cultural\r\n\r\nvalue,  including biographies.  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nquote  one  example. Today I read a short  article\r\n\r\nwhich  reminds  me of a certain reputable  person,\r\n\r\nthe  late  Mr  Lee Kong Chian. He  was  a  man  of\r\n\r\npraiseworthy ambition and exemplary conduct. He is\r\n\r\nan  example of a national asset. Although I cannot\r\n\r\nhope  to do what he had done, I can at least  look\r\n\r\nup  to  the ideals of his achievements. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  must try to record his words and deeds in some\r\n\r\nkind of publication so that Singapore citizens can\r\n\r\nlearn  from  him.  This is  what  I  mean  by  the\r\n\r\nadoption  of a positive approach as distinct  from\r\n\r\nthe negative approach to control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that we must also adopt the\r\n\r\npositive  approach  by  giving  support   to   the\r\n\r\nencouragement    of   a   constructive    cultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment in our nation building. In this way we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to strengthen and consolidate  our\r\n\r\ncultural  front  in the task of  nation  building.\r\n\r\nThen  it will not be so easy for our people to  be\r\n\r\ninfluenced by foreigners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would reiterate my support for\r\n\r\nthis   Bill  and  its  committal  to  the   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee for further consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Lim Guan Hoo)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Culture has just\r\n\r\nintroduced the Second Reading of the Newspaper and\r\n\r\nPrinting  Presses  Bill, and I fully  support  him\r\n\r\nfrom the bottom of my heart. Sir, the introduction\r\n\r\nof this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill  is  the very natural reflection  of  certain\r\n\r\naspects  of  life  in Singapore. Some  people  may\r\n\r\nassociate this Bill with some kind of interference\r\n\r\nor  control  of  the  freedom  of  the  press.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in a country like Singapore  which\r\n\r\npractises democracy, the freedom of the press  is,\r\n\r\nof  course,  a  matter of tradition.  But  if  the\r\n\r\npeople are to assume that the freedom of the press\r\n\r\nis  something separate from the national interest,\r\n\r\nthen  it  is  not a healthy belief. No matter  how\r\n\r\nsincere  the  directors or managers of  newspapers\r\n\r\nmay be and although they are without any political\r\n\r\nblots, it does not mean that their newspapers will\r\n\r\nbe  free from outside influence or unblemished  as\r\n\r\nthe directors and management personnel themselves.\r\n\r\nWe  have  experienced attempts at black operations\r\n\r\nin  the  past. Black operations have  come  to  be\r\n\r\nassociated with the publication of news.  We  can,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  learn  a lesson from this  experience.\r\n\r\nAnd  that  is, in any country, newspapers  of  any\r\n\r\ntype   -whether  it  is  a  political,   cultural,\r\n\r\nfinancial  or movie newspaper - can be controlled,\r\n\r\ninfluenced or infiltrated by undesirable  elements\r\n\r\nbecause   the  newspaper  is  a  good   means   of\r\n\r\ndisseminating  propaganda.  Once  a  newspaper  is\r\n\r\npublished,  it is read by thousands and  thousands\r\n\r\nof  people in the home, in the office, or even  in\r\n\r\nthe  toilet.  It  is because of the  inherent  and\r\n\r\nformidable  influence of the newspaper that  there\r\n\r\nis  always  the  temptation for ambitious  foreign\r\n\r\nelements to come in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in our midst we have a lot of\r\n\r\njournalists, who are now Ministers. I can  mention\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture,  the  Parliamentary Secretary,  and  even\r\n\r\nsome  Backbenchers. For example,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nHenderson  is  the  editor of the  Petir  (Chinese\r\n\r\nedition) and another Member is also the editor  of\r\n\r\nthe  Jurong  Newspaper. I myself  was  the  former\r\n\r\neditor  of the Petir (Chinese edition). So in  our\r\n\r\nmidst  we  have a number of journalists, and  this\r\n\r\ninstance   is   enough  to  indicate   the   close\r\n\r\nconnection between politics and journalism. In the\r\n\r\nlight of these facts and realities, there are some\r\n\r\npeople  who  even dream dreams of freedom  of  the\r\n\r\npress. They\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  obsessed  with  the  freedom  of  the  press.\r\n\r\nHowever, these facts are enough to serve as an eye-opener to such dreamers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill in this House seeks to ensure that the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of newspapers will always remain  in  the\r\n\r\nhands  of  our  citizens and not in the  hands  of\r\n\r\nforeigners. This is, in fact, the very  spirit  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill, as indicated by the Member for  Delta.\r\n\r\nWhether  this Bill is adequate to ensure  what  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  achieve is something we  have  to  think\r\n\r\nabout.  For  example, under the  Bill,  shares  of\r\n\r\nnewspaper companies are to be classified into  two\r\n\r\ncategories, management shares and ordinary shares.\r\n\r\nManagement  shares  can  only  be  transferred  to\r\n\r\ncitizens approved by the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the People's Action Party has\r\n\r\ngone  through  many  years of political  struggle.\r\n\r\nThrough  all  our experiences in the  struggle  we\r\n\r\nhave  come to a situation where we have two  types\r\n\r\nof membership in the PAP, the cadre membership and\r\n\r\nthe ordinary membership. With these two classes of\r\n\r\nmembership, we are able to ensure that control  of\r\n\r\na  very influential political party like ours does\r\n\r\nnot   fall  into  the  wrong  hands.  And  if  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  newspapers  can  use   a   similar\r\n\r\nprovision   in  the  Bill  wisely  and   with   an\r\n\r\nenlightened view, they will be able to promote the\r\n\r\ninterest  of the country. Then only will the  Bill\r\n\r\nbe able to achieve what it seeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out some of my\r\n\r\nmisgivings.  I  am afraid that some newspaper  men\r\n\r\nmay  misunderstand and think that the introduction\r\n\r\nof this Bill is just to control the press. This is\r\n\r\nnot  the  case.  As a matter of  fact,  bona  fide\r\n\r\nnewspaper  men  can, with the provisions  of  this\r\n\r\nBill,  do  their job more efficiently and  without\r\n\r\nfear.  This  Bill seeks to exercise some  kind  of\r\n\r\ncheck  to  ensure  that the right  people  are  in\r\n\r\ncontrol   of  management  shares  and  to  prevent\r\n\r\nundesirable elements from owning management shares\r\n\r\nand  thus gain control of the newspapers. In  this\r\n\r\nway, bona fide newspaper men will be able\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto carry out their duties with peace of mind. When\r\n\r\nthe Bill is passed, I hope such newspaper men will\r\n\r\ncarry   out  their  duties  more  positively   and\r\n\r\nefficiently,  particularly those who are  thinking\r\n\r\nof publishing academic magazines or newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding what I have said, Sir, we still\r\n\r\nhave  some newspapers of good standing. Newspapers\r\n\r\nwhich  do  good  deeds will receive good  rewards.\r\n\r\nHowever,   there  are  newspapers  which   publish\r\n\r\nundesirable  news items, articles  or  reports  in\r\n\r\norder  to attract a wider readership. I hope  that\r\n\r\nafter  the  final  passage of this  Bill,  such  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper will be able to develop from a  mosquito\r\n\r\nnewspaper into a medium-sized newspaper and from a\r\n\r\nmedium-sized newspaper into a large newspaper. The\r\n\r\nsmall  or  mosquito newspapers actually depend  on\r\n\r\ncrime  reports or even sex stories to boost  their\r\n\r\nsales.  Such mosquito newspapers seem to  paint  a\r\n\r\nchaotic  state  of  the  world  because  the  more\r\n\r\nchaotic  the  world  is the  more  news  they  can\r\n\r\npublish, and the more sensationalism they can whip\r\n\r\nup  the greater the boost to their sales. It is my\r\n\r\nhope  that  after the passage of this Bill,  these\r\n\r\nnewspapers   will   develop  along   a   healthier\r\n\r\ndirection in the interest of the people. With this\r\n\r\nhope I reiterate my full support for this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the air of light-heartedness\r\n\r\nwill  not  diminish the gravity of this Bill.  Two\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  when I was still in the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture, I dwelt on this same topic in this  House\r\n\r\n-  perhaps,  the newspapers at that time  did  not\r\n\r\ngive a fair description of my views then. But this\r\n\r\nis a trivial matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have expressed their views on the\r\n\r\ninfluence  of  newspapers  on  culture,  the  very\r\n\r\nfreedom  of the press itself and foreign influence\r\n\r\nmaking  inroads into Singapore. They also  rightly\r\n\r\ncommented  on certain activities of the newspapers\r\n\r\nthat  were  irrelevant as far as our  people  were\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I feel that our main consideration for the\r\n\r\npassage of this Bill is based on national interest\r\n\r\nand security. We have to explain to the people the\r\n\r\nmeasures  we now take lest they may feel that  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of this Bill is merely  to  exercise\r\n\r\ncontrol  over  the  English,  Chinese  and   other\r\n\r\nnewspapers. It must be made clear and  the  people\r\n\r\nmust  realise  that what we are doing  is  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of our country. What is important is that\r\n\r\nif  a newspaper is in the hands of foreigners - as\r\n\r\nwe  all  know  the newspaper is a  very  effective\r\n\r\npublic  medium - and acts against the interest  of\r\n\r\nour  country,  we  must be vigilant  against  this\r\n\r\nmanoeuvre and must necessarily nip it in the bud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain foreigners had publicised their own\r\n\r\nthoughts   and   ideas  through  our   newspapers.\r\n\r\nArticles were written on what was labelled as \"one-party   monopoly\"   and   on   the   question   of\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy in  Singapore,  lamenting\r\n\r\nthe   fact   that  there  was  no  opposition   in\r\n\r\nParliament. What they advocated was the simplistic\r\n\r\nview  that  since  there  was  no  opposition   in\r\n\r\nParliament,  there  was no  democracy.  All  these\r\n\r\ntalks  were  nonsensical utterances.  They  viewed\r\n\r\nSingapore  with a foreign standpoint  and  through\r\n\r\ntinted  glasses. The result, of course,  was  that\r\n\r\nevents  were  distorted and consequently  confused\r\n\r\nthe views of the people. These foreign journalists\r\n\r\njudged   local  events  according  to  their   own\r\n\r\nphilosophies,  standards  and  their  own   mental\r\n\r\nmakeup.  What may be acceptable to them,  perhaps,\r\n\r\nwould  be a situation obtained in line with  their\r\n\r\nown liking. What they failed to understand, and we\r\n\r\nare  very  conscious, is that  our  way  of  life,\r\n\r\nphilosophy  and  attitude towards life  are  quite\r\n\r\ndifferent from their own and since they do not see\r\n\r\nany   similarity  between  Singapore   and   their\r\n\r\ncountry, they simply equate the situation  as  the\r\n\r\nnon-existence of democracy and that ours is a \"one-party  monopoly\" - or other evil things like that.\r\n\r\nOf   course,  not  all  foreign  journalists   are\r\n\r\nignorant  of the facts of life in Singapore,  some\r\n\r\nwere  even appreciative of the situation here  but\r\n\r\nthere were others, awareness of the facts not- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithstanding, deliberately behaved in a manner  as\r\n\r\ndictated by their \"behind-the curtain masters\". It\r\n\r\nis   not   my  intention  to  place  all   foreign\r\n\r\njournalists in this category but even  they  would\r\n\r\naccept  that  there were a few black  sheep  among\r\n\r\nthem.    It   is   understandable   that   foreign\r\n\r\njournalists have to make a living by selling their\r\n\r\narticles and news reports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were articles specially written to\r\n\r\ncriticize     the    method    of     governmental\r\n\r\nadministration,  implying high-handedness  on  the\r\n\r\npart  of  the  Government in exerting pressure  on\r\n\r\ncertain  newspapers and the journalistic  circles.\r\n\r\nAll these were calculated to create a confusion of\r\n\r\nmind and subvert the country's peace and order. It\r\n\r\nmust  be emphasized that when the chips are  down,\r\n\r\nit  was  Singapore  that would be  responsible  to\r\n\r\nensure  peace  and order in our society.  None  of\r\n\r\nthose  who  branded Singapore with  all  sorts  of\r\n\r\nmischievous names could state in black  and  white\r\n\r\nthat  they,  and they alone, could guarantee  that\r\n\r\npeace and order in Singapore would not break down.\r\n\r\nWhat  happened in the event of a chaotic situation\r\n\r\nthat  they helped bring about? Far from being able\r\n\r\nto  assist, they would just make quick  exit  from\r\n\r\nthe country and then retire into their bedroom  to\r\n\r\nwrite  articles on the situation and  continue  to\r\n\r\nearn  their fees. Is that the kind of contribution\r\n\r\nthey could make to Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in Australia there was a time when members\r\n\r\nof the public were stirred when they learnt that a\r\n\r\nforeign  newspaper tycoon was attempting  to  take\r\n\r\nover a certain local newspaper there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, there are those who view us in\r\n\r\na   different  light  and  through  their   tinted\r\n\r\nglasses.   Whatever  we  do,   they   react   with\r\n\r\nscepticism. They seem to have strange imaginations\r\n\r\nabout everything that we are trying to do for  the\r\n\r\ngood  of our people. What we desire is a situation\r\n\r\nwhere the wishes and thinking of the people can be\r\n\r\nexpressed truly through the newspapers, in  short,\r\n\r\nthe  press  should  reflect  the  aspirations   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and not foreigners. There  were  some\r\n\r\nnewspapers who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupported  the  views of other  countries  against\r\n\r\ntheir  own viewpoints. This, perhaps, was intended\r\n\r\nto  net in a wider readership. The question of the\r\n\r\nStraits  of Malacca was a good example  in  point.\r\n\r\nThis  showed that we do have parasites even  among\r\n\r\nour  own  journalists who are prepared  to  repeat\r\n\r\nwhat  others say and echo them without considering\r\n\r\nthe  effects or consequences as a result of  their\r\n\r\ntoeing the policies of other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A journalist is just like anybody else. Everyone\r\n\r\nhas his own character and personality. Likewise, a\r\n\r\njournalist   should  have  his  own   professional\r\n\r\nintegrity, personality and character. It is a pity\r\n\r\nthat  there are people who are only interested  in\r\n\r\nfees and circulation and therefore seek to publish\r\n\r\nnews    or   views   that   will   cause    public\r\n\r\nsensationalism. I had the opportunity  to  discuss\r\n\r\nthis  matter  with one of them who  remarked  that\r\n\r\n\"Whilst  in  business,  let's  talk  business.\"  I\r\n\r\nbluntly told him that if what he really wanted was\r\n\r\nmere   business,  then  he  should  find  it  more\r\n\r\nprofitable  to  launch into  some  other  kind  of\r\n\r\nenterprises  and  certainly  not  the   newspapers\r\n\r\nbecause  a newspaper should not be only  a  money-making proposition. I further added that there are\r\n\r\nmany   other   ways  to  make  money  other   than\r\n\r\nirresponsible writing in the newspapers. In  fact,\r\n\r\nwriting is a very hard way to make a living and if\r\n\r\nmoney  is  what  one is after, then certainly  the\r\n\r\nnewspaper is the wrong place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Henderson commented on certain\r\n\r\nreports  which  my  colleague,  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the Minister for Home Affairs,  did\r\n\r\nnot seem to agree to. I will give just one example\r\n\r\nto  illustrate  what effects the  choice  of  news\r\n\r\nreports  can  make  in  the community.  There  was\r\n\r\nquoted in a certain newspaper a robbery case in  a\r\n\r\nforeign country. A clipping of that newspaper  was\r\n\r\nsent to Singapore for publication. At the risk  of\r\n\r\nbeing accused of creating an uproar in this House,\r\n\r\nlet  me briefly describe the contents of this news\r\n\r\nreport as I think it is a very serious matter. The\r\n\r\nreport said that a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngang  of  robbers  entered into  a  house  and  on\r\n\r\nfailing  to  find anything valuable,  they  became\r\n\r\nfurious  and castrated a child whom they found  in\r\n\r\nthe  house. This news item of atrocious  brutality\r\n\r\nwas  a  sensational news item in that country  and\r\n\r\nevery full stop and comma of this news report  was\r\n\r\nreproduced  in  one of our local newspapers.  What\r\n\r\nwas  it  they  hoped to achieve  by  quoting  this\r\n\r\narticle?  Was it meant to reflect the  comparative\r\n\r\nsecurity of Singapore or was it meant to introduce\r\n\r\nor  give  ideas to our local criminals? Therefore,\r\n\r\nthere must be certain principles which the editors\r\n\r\nmust  adopt in the choice and publication of  news\r\n\r\nitems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the main objective of this Bill\r\n\r\nis  to  ensure that newspapers should reflect  the\r\n\r\nviews  and aspirations of our citizens. It  cannot\r\n\r\nbe   denied   that  the  newspaper  is   also   an\r\n\r\neducational medium for the public and it has  also\r\n\r\na  duty  to  educate and enlighten the  community.\r\n\r\nThrough its circulation, it can positively help in\r\n\r\nour   efforts  in  nation  building  and  in   the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of  law  and  order.  In  short,  the\r\n\r\nnewspaper must work in the interest of the country\r\n\r\nand the people rather than for the sheer profit to\r\n\r\nfill the pockets of a small group of individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to support this Bill in toto. Although what I\r\n\r\nwanted to say has already been said, there is just\r\n\r\none point I wish to mention. I feel that there  is\r\n\r\none  clause  in  the Bill which is  a  little  too\r\n\r\npreponderant. In Part III, clause 9 (2) says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No newspaper company shall refuse to issue\r\n\r\nmanagement  shares  to any  person  who  has  been\r\n\r\ngranted  the  written approval of the Minister  to\r\n\r\npurchase such shares.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  feel that this is a little too drastic, and  I\r\n\r\nhope  to present certain views on this point  when\r\n\r\nthis Bill is sent to Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\npromise to be very brief. Clause 10 prohibits  the\r\n\r\nreceipt of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunds  from  a  foreign source. The  intention  is\r\n\r\nquite  clear.  But on reading it, I  am  a  little\r\n\r\nconcerned that the clause, if implemented  in  its\r\n\r\npresent  form,  may also be used  as  a  means  of\r\n\r\nsubversion  against  us. For example,  if  someone\r\n\r\ndislikes  a  particular pressman,  it  can  be  so\r\n\r\neasily arranged for a certain sum of money  to  be\r\n\r\ndeposited into a bank account in that individual's\r\n\r\nname. Having done so, an anonymous report can then\r\n\r\nbe  made  to  the Minister and, if the  consequent\r\n\r\ninvestigations  are  not  objective  and  thorough\r\n\r\nenough, miscarriage of justice could arise.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  a  lawyer.  I  do  not know  what  the  legal\r\n\r\nimplications are, but I am just wondering  whether\r\n\r\nthere are adequate safeguards for our pressmen.  I\r\n\r\nhope  this point will be looked into by the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.44 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Kuo Chuan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  is  an important Bill, one that is bound  to\r\n\r\nprovoke   controversy  both  within  and   outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It brings to the fore once  again  the\r\n\r\npeculiar  problems  faced by  small  strategically\r\n\r\nlocated developing States that are endeavouring to\r\n\r\ntransform their socio-economic structures  without\r\n\r\ncompromising their independence internationally on\r\n\r\nthe  basis of democratic institutions. Sad to say,\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  also demonstrates the fragile  base  on\r\n\r\nwhich educated opinion in Singapore moves. It is a\r\n\r\npity  too that despite the phenomenal strides that\r\n\r\nwe  have made in education over the last 20 years,\r\n\r\nno  newspaper  has  emerged  in  Singapore  as   a\r\n\r\nnational    institution   serving   the   national\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was still possible only a few years ago for a\r\n\r\ncombination  of  foreign interests  to  mount  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Herald to confuse and  divide  educated\r\n\r\nopinion  on  issues that were vital to the  social\r\n\r\npeace and security of Singapore. There were no in-built   checks   and  balances  to   contain   the\r\n\r\noperation. The State had to step in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular political thinking defines democratic\r\n\r\npolitics  in terms of a few fundamental  freedoms,\r\n\r\nof which freedom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  press  is  one.  But,  unlike  the  other\r\n\r\nfundamental freedoms, the freedom of the press has\r\n\r\nbecome  over  the  last hundred years  or  so  the\r\n\r\nhandmaiden  of  vast economic  interests.  In  the\r\n\r\ncontext  of Singapore these interests have  always\r\n\r\nbeen  international  in character.  In  the  final\r\n\r\nanalysis the press in South-east Asian states  has\r\n\r\nto-date  been  controlled by foreign  rather  than\r\n\r\nnational interests. It is this situation  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  meet  in  the course  of  our  political\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, Sir, one wonders if the Bill\r\n\r\nhas  not  gone  too  far  than  was  necessary  in\r\n\r\nregulating   the   problem.  The  provision   that\r\n\r\nmanagement shares could only be held by  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens with the approval of the Minister appears\r\n\r\nto  be too drastic, on the face of it. It would be\r\n\r\npreferable to leave the management shares  in  the\r\n\r\nhands   of   Singapore  citizens   regardless   of\r\n\r\nMinisterial   approval  but  with   the   negative\r\n\r\nstipulation  that no management  shares  shall  be\r\n\r\nrefused to persons who have been approved  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  The provisions of clause  10  are  more\r\n\r\nthan  sufficient  and adequate to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nproblems  posed  by foreign financial  control  of\r\n\r\nnational  press. The experiment is an  interesting\r\n\r\none.   Time  only  will  tell  if  the  aims   and\r\n\r\nobjectives  of  the  Bill are  achieved  and  also\r\n\r\nwhether in the process we have stifled free, frank\r\n\r\nand  fearless  discussion of issues  that  vitally\r\n\r\nconcern the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Govindaswamy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

But we\r\n\r\nmust  not  be  too strict in our  control  of  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers, for if we do they cannot be published.\r\n\r\nThat is very bad. The newspaper must be given some\r\n\r\nfreedom,  otherwise people will  say  that  it  is\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by  the  Government.

Many of them have been very articulate\r\n\r\nand,  in fact, they have made longer speeches than\r\n\r\nI expected. I must take this opportunity to assure\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  House and also  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  that  it  is  not  the  intention  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to go into the newspaper business.  Our\r\n\r\nintention  is to see that newspapers are  properly\r\n\r\nmanaged  and  that they cannot be  taken  over  by\r\n\r\nundesirable  elements which may then direct  their\r\n\r\npolicies against the interests of our nation. That\r\n\r\nis the sole purpose of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng and the Member for Kuo\r\n\r\nChuan have to a certain extent mentioned the  fear\r\n\r\nthat the Bill might be delegating undue powers  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister or the Government for control of the\r\n\r\npress.  Those  fears exist in the  minds  of  many\r\n\r\npeople.  I think it should be sufficient to  allay\r\n\r\nthe  fears of these people when I say that  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  the intention of the Government to take  over\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers but to see that a  free  press  is\r\n\r\nallowed  to  be  conducted  in  Singapore.  It  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  not our intention to curb  the  genuine\r\n\r\nexpression of public opinion. In fact,  it  is  to\r\n\r\nour interest that those opinions should be allowed\r\n\r\nto  be  expressed.  Let the flowers  bloom.  In  a\r\n\r\nsituation like ours it is quite important that the\r\n\r\nman-in-the-street should be given the  opportunity\r\n\r\nto express his opinion, whether it is about buses,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Culture's TV programmes or  other\r\n\r\nmatters.  He  should be given the  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nexpress his opinion publicly and there is no other\r\n\r\nmedium better than the press. We would like to see\r\n\r\nthis   sort  of  freedom  existing  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nHowever, many very important\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviews have been expressed by Members, and  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  that these views will be taken  care  of\r\n\r\nwhen   the  Bill  is  considered  by  the   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some minor points which I should touch\r\n\r\non  briefly.  The  Member for Delta  has  queried:\r\n\r\nsince the management shares are so important  that\r\n\r\ntheir voting rights are greater than those of  the\r\n\r\nordinary  shares,  what type of citizens  will  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to own these management shares?  We  have\r\n\r\nnot  come  to  that stage yet; let  us  cross  the\r\n\r\nbridge  when we come to it. I am sure the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home Affairs will be able to advise me as  to\r\n\r\nwhich  type  of  citizens will be allowed  to  own\r\n\r\nthose shares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, in fact, considered a Press Council for\r\n\r\na  very  long time, but we found that  it  is  not\r\n\r\npracticable under our present conditions. First of\r\n\r\nall,  who  is  to be the Chairman? Who  gives  the\r\n\r\norder? Who lays down policies? These are all  very\r\n\r\ncomplicated  matters, and  I  think  it  would  be\r\n\r\nbetter   that  the  press  be  allowed  to  manage\r\n\r\nthemselves.  Therefore, we have  introduced  these\r\n\r\nmanagement  shares to ensure that only  the  right\r\n\r\npeople  are  allowed  to exercise  the  powers  of\r\n\r\nmanagement  of newspapers. The Members  for  Bukit\r\n\r\nMerah   and   Henderson  and   the   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the Minister for Labour  have  also\r\n\r\noffered   very   good  advice  to  the   newspaper\r\n\r\ndirectors as to how they should run the newspapers\r\n\r\nand  what  sort of articles should be  put  in  to\r\n\r\nattract  more  readers, and  so  on.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  concerned  will  take  note  of  their\r\n\r\nadvice  and  make improvements to the contents  of\r\n\r\ntheir newspapers. Apart from those comments,  Sir,\r\n\r\nI have nothing more to add.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the Newspaper and Printing Presses Bill be\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Select Committee consisting  of  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker  as  Chairman  and  seven  Members  to  be\r\n\r\nnominated  by the Committee of Selection.\"  -  [Mr Jek Yeun Thong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MUTUAL BENEFIT ORGANISATIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to introduce several\r\n\r\namendments to the Mutual Benefit Organisations Act\r\n\r\n(Chapter  254  of the Revised Edition)  which  are\r\n\r\nfound  necessary in the light of experience gained\r\n\r\nin administering the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments seek to strengthen the\r\n\r\nhands of the Registrar in administering the Mutual\r\n\r\nBenefit  Organisations Act which provides for  the\r\n\r\nregistration  and  control of all  mutual  benefit\r\n\r\norganisations  in the Republic. At present,  there\r\n\r\nare 427 such organisations with a total membership\r\n\r\nof   191,367.   Many   of  the  long   established\r\n\r\norganisations have accumulated large surplus funds\r\n\r\nover the years. As the majority of the members  of\r\n\r\nmutual  benefit organisations are from the  lower-income  group and often illiterate, there must  be\r\n\r\nadequate  legislation to ensure that these  mutual\r\n\r\nbenefit  organisations are  properly  managed  and\r\n\r\ntheir activities consistent with the objectives of\r\n\r\ntheir organisations for the welfare and benefit of\r\n\r\nthe  subscribers. It is, therefore, necessary that\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of the members be  safeguarded  by\r\n\r\nappropriate    law    against   exploitation    by\r\n\r\nunscrupulous persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience over the years has shown that the\r\n\r\nexisting   provisions  in   the   Mutual   Benefit\r\n\r\nOrganisations  Act  relating to  registration  and\r\n\r\ncancellation  of mutual benefit organisations  are\r\n\r\ninadequate and restrictive. There is no  provision\r\n\r\nat  present  empowering the  Registrar  to  refuse\r\n\r\nregistration of newly formed organisations  if  he\r\n\r\nhas reason to believe that such organisations have\r\n\r\nbeen   formed  for  the  personal  gain   of   the\r\n\r\norganisers.  Nor has the Registrar  the  power  to\r\n\r\nprevent mutual benefit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norganisations  from being managed  by  persons  of\r\n\r\ndubious character or used for any purpose contrary\r\n\r\nto the public interest. To remedy this, sections 5\r\n\r\nand  6  of  the Act will be repealed and  two  new\r\n\r\nsections re-enacted to provide the Registrar  with\r\n\r\nwider powers in considering an application for the\r\n\r\nregistration of a mutual benefit organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing section 7, a person aggrieved\r\n\r\nby  the  refusal of the Registrar to  register  an\r\n\r\norganisation  may  appeal  at  any  time  to   the\r\n\r\nMinister.  It  is desirable to stipulate  a  fixed\r\n\r\nperiod  in which an appeal may be made. Section  7\r\n\r\nof the Act is, therefore, being amended so that an\r\n\r\nappeal against the decision of a Registrar must be\r\n\r\nmade   within   one  month  from   the   date   of\r\n\r\nnotification of such a decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a new section 1lA is being\r\n\r\nintroduced  for  the  purpose of  prohibiting  any\r\n\r\nperson  who  has  been  convicted  of  an  offence\r\n\r\ninvolving  dishonesty or moral turpitude,  or  who\r\n\r\nhas  been sentenced to imprisonment for a term  of\r\n\r\nnot  less  than one year or to a fine of not  less\r\n\r\nthan  $2,000  and  who  has not  received  a  free\r\n\r\npardon,  from  acting as an officer  of  a  mutual\r\n\r\nbenefit Organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (1) of section 27 will be deleted and\r\n\r\na  new subsection re-enacted to give the Registrar\r\n\r\nwider  powers  to cancel the registration  of  any\r\n\r\nmutual benefit organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill also seeks to introduce a new\r\n\r\nsubsection under section 45 to enable the Minister\r\n\r\nto  exempt  any organisation, person or  class  of\r\n\r\npersons, from any or all of the provisions of  the\r\n\r\nAct.

This  is  because these  organisations\r\n\r\nlike  the  Chinese  pugilistic organisations,  the\r\n\r\nbersilat  and  judo  clubs,  etc.,  have  been  in\r\n\r\nexistence for many years and have become  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  cultural  life of our population.  Hence  any\r\n\r\nexponent of these arts is free to practise  or  to\r\n\r\nimpart  his  skill to whoever wants to  learn  the\r\n\r\nart.  The Government considers that the discipline\r\n\r\nand  the training provided in acquiring the  skill\r\n\r\nwill develop a \"healthy mind and healthy body\" and\r\n\r\nthus  help  to  build  a  rugged  society  in  our\r\n\r\nRepublic.  These  organisations  were,  therefore,\r\n\r\nallowed to function without impediment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years there has been a proliferation of\r\n\r\nmartial  arts organisations in Singapore.  At  the\r\n\r\nend   of   1973,  there  were  128  martial   arts\r\n\r\norganisations registered in Singapore compared  to\r\n\r\nonly 32 in 1963. It is difficult to estimate the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnumber of trainees learning martial arts, although\r\n\r\nthis has been placed between 13,000 to 18,000. New\r\n\r\narts  like  karate and taekwondo have  emerged  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  variations  of  these  arts  like\r\n\r\nakido,  kendo, jiu-jitsu, as well as the different\r\n\r\nChinese  pugilistic arts have been developed.  The\r\n\r\nrapid  growth  of  these  organisations  and   the\r\n\r\nincreasing  number of trainees learning  different\r\n\r\nmartial arts can be traced to their popularisation\r\n\r\nby  Chinese  films  especially from  Hongkong  and\r\n\r\nTaiwan  in the late 60's which glorify the use  of\r\n\r\nmartial arts. These films which emphasise violence\r\n\r\nand bloodshed were one of the contributory factors\r\n\r\nresulting in an increase in the crime rate  and  a\r\n\r\nrise  in violence in the commission of crimes.  It\r\n\r\nis  noted  that between 1967 and 1969  when  these\r\n\r\nfilms  were  widely  shown in  the  Republic,  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  new  pugilistic  organisations   which\r\n\r\napplied   to   the  Government  for   registration\r\n\r\nincreased  at  the  rate of 11  to  15  each  year\r\n\r\ncompared to very few in the 50's and in the  early\r\n\r\n60's.  Although the Government has imposed  strict\r\n\r\ncensorship on these films last year, the number of\r\n\r\nmartial   arts  organisations  applying   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment for registration has not abated. Up  to\r\n\r\nMarch this year, there were 133 registered martial\r\n\r\narts  organisations with 11 new applications under\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasing interest amongst our population in\r\n\r\nmartial  art  training  has  made  many  of  these\r\n\r\norganisations  become  commercial  concerns.  Some\r\n\r\npseudo martial arts organisations have also sprung\r\n\r\nup to exploit the market. Since there is little or\r\n\r\nno   control   over   these   organisations,   any\r\n\r\ninstructor  who professes sufficient knowledge  of\r\n\r\nany martial art can organise a class and apply for\r\n\r\nregistration to the Registrar of Societies or  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Business Names by payment of a  small\r\n\r\nfee. Both the Registrars have no means of checking\r\n\r\nwhether  such an instructor is qualified to  teach\r\n\r\nthis  skill  or  to  whom  he  should  impart  his\r\n\r\nknowledge.  Similarly,  instructors  will  readily\r\n\r\naccept any trainee as a student with scant concern\r\n\r\nabout his background, his purpose in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nacquiring  the  art and whether he  would  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom it, so long as he is prepared to meet the fee\r\n\r\nrequired  for receiving such training.  There  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  little control as to who is  qualified\r\n\r\nto teach or who can learn the art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the laxity in admission and the\r\n\r\ngeneral   availability  of  these   martial   arts\r\n\r\norganisations  to  the  public,  many   of   these\r\n\r\norganisations  have  been  penetrated  by   secret\r\n\r\nsociety  members  and  the criminal  elements  who\r\n\r\nlearn martial art to further their own ends. These\r\n\r\nsecret society members use the art in gang clashes\r\n\r\nto glorify the triad which they belong and also to\r\n\r\ncow  innocent victims from whom they extort money.\r\n\r\nIn   a   recent  study  on  some  115   pugilistic\r\n\r\norganisations in Singapore, it was found  that  33\r\n\r\nof  these  have been penetrated by secret  society\r\n\r\nelements and 10 of them have elements with adverse\r\n\r\nsecurity records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is not the intention of Government to\r\n\r\ndeter anyone who requires martial art training  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up a healthy body and for self-defence,  it\r\n\r\nis   recognised  that  organisations  which  teach\r\n\r\nmartial  art, be it a Chinese pugilistic  art,  or\r\n\r\nkarate  or  taekwondo  or  judo  or  bersilat,  in\r\n\r\neffect,  equip  their  members  with  a  potential\r\n\r\nweapon   which,  if  abused,  can   have   serious\r\n\r\nconsequences   for  their  victims   and   serious\r\n\r\nimplications for the maintenance of law and order.\r\n\r\nAs  such,  in the interest of society,  Government\r\n\r\nhas   found  it  necessary  to  institute   proper\r\n\r\ncontrols  to  regulate  the  activities  of   such\r\n\r\norganisations and to ensure that those  whom  they\r\n\r\nteach  are  not likely to abuse the art that  they\r\n\r\nhave  acquired. In other words, the knowledge  and\r\n\r\nskill  of martial arts in the hands of disciplined\r\n\r\nand  law-abiding persons can be of benefit to both\r\n\r\nthe  exponent  and society. But if such  knowledge\r\n\r\nand  skill  were  allowed to fall into  the  wrong\r\n\r\nhands it can be very dangerous and detrimental  to\r\n\r\nsociety. Hence, the Martial Arts Instruction  Bill\r\n\r\nbefore the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martial arts, as defined in the Bill, include\r\n\r\nkarate,  taekwondo, judo, akido, kendo,  bersilat,\r\n\r\nkung-fu, jiu-jitsu, or a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncombination thereof. However, in view of the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  new  forms of martial arts or variations  of\r\n\r\nexisting forms of martial arts are introduced into\r\n\r\nSingapore  from time to time, this  definition  of\r\n\r\n\"martial  art\"  cannot be comprehensive.  However,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  is  empowered by clause  2  (2)  to\r\n\r\ndeclare  any  other  art  of  pugilism,  fighting,\r\n\r\nboxing  or  self-defence to be a martial  art  for\r\n\r\npurposes of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration of the Act will be in the\r\n\r\nhands  of  a Controller of Martial Arts. Assistant\r\n\r\nControllers will also be able to exercise all  the\r\n\r\npowers  conferred  on the Controller,  subject  to\r\n\r\nsuch limitations as he may impose (clause 3).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill requires all martial art\r\n\r\nassociations  to  be  registered.  The  Controller\r\n\r\nshall  refuse  registration in  the  circumstances\r\n\r\nstipulated   in  clause  4  (3)  and  may   refuse\r\n\r\nregistration   in   certain  other   circumstances\r\n\r\nstipulated   in  clause  4  (4).  An  unregistered\r\n\r\nmartial  art  association, which is  organised  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and whose officers, employees or members\r\n\r\nprovide instruction in any form of martial art  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, will be deemed to be unlawful. It  will\r\n\r\nbe  an  offence  for  a person to  pursue  certain\r\n\r\nactivities in connection with unlawful martial art\r\n\r\nassociations (clauses 5, 15, 16, 17 and 18).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 empowers the Controller to order any\r\n\r\nregistered martial art association to furnish  him\r\n\r\nwith such information as he may require concerning\r\n\r\nthe  provision  of  instruction  in  any  form  of\r\n\r\nmartial art at a place of instruction provided  by\r\n\r\nthe  association or with any document, account  or\r\n\r\nbook of the association relating thereto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 seeks to disallow any person from\r\n\r\nholding   office  in  a  registered  martial   art\r\n\r\nassociation  if he has been declared, in  writing,\r\n\r\nby the Controller to be unfit to act as an officer\r\n\r\nof  a martial art association. The Controller  may\r\n\r\nmake  such  declaration upon any  of  the  grounds\r\n\r\nstipulated  in clause 19.

A similar power is conferred upon the\r\n\r\nMinister where the association has contravened any\r\n\r\nprovision  of  the  Act  or any  regulations  made\r\n\r\nthereunder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No person except an instructor who is in\r\n\r\npossession  of an instructor's certificate  issued\r\n\r\nunder the Act may instruct any person in any  form\r\n\r\nof martial art (clause 21). The Controller will be\r\n\r\nresponsible      for     granting     instructor's\r\n\r\ncertificates. Clause 25 (3) stipulates the grounds\r\n\r\non  which  the Controller may refuse to  grant  an\r\n\r\ninstructor's  certificate. Clause 26 empowers  the\r\n\r\nController   to  revoke,  cancel  or  suspend   an\r\n\r\ninstructor's  certificate for any of  the  reasons\r\n\r\nstipulated in that clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No person may receive instruction in any form of\r\n\r\nmartial  art  from  an  instructor  unless  he  is\r\n\r\nregistered as a trainee under the Act (clause 22).\r\n\r\nThe   Controller  will  be  responsible  for   the\r\n\r\nregistration of trainees. Clause 22 stipulates the\r\n\r\ngrounds  on  which the Controller  may  refuse  to\r\n\r\nregister  any  person  as  a  trainee.  Clause  24\r\n\r\nempowers  the  Controller  to  revoke,  cancel  or\r\n\r\nsuspend the registration of a trainee for  any  of\r\n\r\nthe reasons stipulated in that clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 31 provides the Controller and Police\r\n\r\nofficers  with  the  powers of entry,  search  and\r\n\r\narrest, in circumstances where there is reason  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that an offence has been committed  under\r\n\r\nthe Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 34 empowers the Minister to exempt any\r\n\r\norganisation, person or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclass of persons from any or all of the provisions\r\n\r\nof the Act.

If there\r\n\r\nare   sufficient  instructors,  members   of   the\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps  should  also  be  encouraged  to\r\n\r\nundergo this kind of training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I rise in support of this Bill.  In\r\n\r\nrecent  years  the various forms of martial  arts,\r\n\r\nsuch   as  the  Chinese  pugilistic  art,  Western\r\n\r\nboxing, wrestling, taekwondo, judo and many others\r\n\r\nhave  been  found  to  be very  popular  with  the\r\n\r\nyounger  generation.  More  and  more  people  are\r\n\r\nlearning  some  form  of  martial  art.  The  Bill\r\n\r\nintroduced  by the Minister, therefore,  seeks  to\r\n\r\nexercise certain control over the instruction  and\r\n\r\ntraining of the various forms of martial  art,  so\r\n\r\nas   to   ensure   their   proper   guidance   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese pugilistic arts have a very long\r\n\r\nhistory,  whereas the development of martial  arts\r\n\r\nin  Singapore has been very active only in  recent\r\n\r\nyears.  I remember a few years ago after a Chinese\r\n\r\nmartial   art   organisation  was   formed,   much\r\n\r\nassistance  was given to its various members.  Its\r\n\r\nmembers have contributed to many items of activity\r\n\r\nfor   our  National  Day  celebrations  and  other\r\n\r\nfestivals. I refer to the Singapore Federation  of\r\n\r\nPugilistic    Association.   Their   contributions\r\n\r\ninclude the lion dance, the dragon dance and other\r\n\r\nperformances   for   our   various   celebrations,\r\n\r\nparticularly on National Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill requires instructors and members of any\r\n\r\nmartial  art  organisation to  be  registered  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  screened  so  that there  can  be  proper\r\n\r\ncontrol  over  them.  This  is  very  good  indeed\r\n\r\nbecause  those people who learn the  martial  arts\r\n\r\ncomprise  all  kinds of people, including  dubious\r\n\r\nelements. So if by legislation we can ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe   members  of  these  organisations  are   all\r\n\r\ndisciplined and law-abiding people, then it  is  a\r\n\r\nlaw that will indeed do good for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have several suggestions to make to the\r\n\r\nMinister. The Bill provides for the appointment of\r\n\r\na  Controller  of Martial Arts who  will  have  to\r\n\r\nexercise administrative control over martial arts.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would like to know whether he  will  be\r\n\r\nsomeone well versed in the martial arts. I suppose\r\n\r\nhe  is expected to be conversant with all forms of\r\n\r\nmartial  arts.  If  not, he  should  at  least  be\r\n\r\nconversant with certain forms of martial arts,  so\r\n\r\nthat  he  will  be capable of exercising  judgment\r\n\r\nwhen reviewing applications. Secondly, with regard\r\n\r\nto   the  registration  of  private  martial   art\r\n\r\norganisations, or institutes as they call them,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand   some   of  these  organisations   are\r\n\r\nrecruiting  trainees in kung-fu or  some  kind  of\r\n\r\npugilistic art. I would like to ask whether  these\r\n\r\nmartial art institutes have to be registered under\r\n\r\nthe Bill before they can carry out their enrolment\r\n\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, following the call by the Government\r\n\r\nto  all  citizens to be strong and  healthy,  many\r\n\r\nmartial art organisations have sprung up, and more\r\n\r\nand  more  people are joining these institutes  to\r\n\r\ntake  up  martial  arts.  But  these  people  have\r\n\r\ndifferent  motives. Some learn it  as  a  form  of\r\n\r\nexercise  to  improve their health;  while  others\r\n\r\nhave ulterior motives. So the introduction of this\r\n\r\nBill is very timely and also very useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are several points which I would\r\n\r\nlike   the   Minister  to  clarify.   First,   the\r\n\r\ndefinition of martial arts. For instance, the  so-called  kung-fu, as I understand it, is a  Chinese\r\n\r\nform  of  pugilistic art. However, its connotation\r\n\r\nis  very  wide.  There should be a more  clear-cut\r\n\r\ndefinition  of kung-fu. Another instance  is  tai-chi.  It should be made clear whether or not  tai-chi,  or shadow boxing, is to be classified  under\r\n\r\nthis   definition.  There  are  many   old   folks\r\n\r\nperforming  the  tai-chi in the  parks  and  other\r\n\r\nplaces. They even include old crones, grandmothers\r\n\r\nand  grandfathers,  and they  go  to  the  Botanic\r\n\r\nGardens  as  well. Therefore, there  should  be  a\r\n\r\nproper  definition of martial  arts  so  that  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of Botanic Gardens will not mistake  the\r\n\r\nexercises   of  these  old  people  for  something\r\n\r\nunlawful.  Secondly,  with regard  to  instructors\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Member for Sembawang has also  touched\r\n\r\nupon, they have to apply to the Controller for  an\r\n\r\ninstructor's certificate. Before the Controller of\r\n\r\nMartial Arts issues such certificates, he  has  to\r\n\r\nbe  satisfied  with the applicant's character  and\r\n\r\nmorals.  But, in addition to this, the  Controller\r\n\r\nshould  also make sure that the applicant is  well\r\n\r\nqualified in the particular martial art  in  which\r\n\r\nhe wishes to instruct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is about registration of\r\n\r\ntrainees.  The  Minister  has  given  a   detailed\r\n\r\nexplanation on this point. The idea is to exercise\r\n\r\nsome  control over these people so that  they  may\r\n\r\nnot  utilise  their  skill for criminal  purposes.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the registration of trainees  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant. I remember that in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  past, when one wished to be enrolled for  the\r\n\r\nboxing  or  weight-lifting  classes  run  by   the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres, one's name would be  sent  for\r\n\r\nscreening.  But such practice has  ceased  now.  I\r\n\r\nthink it is necessary to revive such practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect is that if a community centre\r\n\r\nwants  to provide instruction in certain forms  of\r\n\r\nmartial art, the centre concerned must first  take\r\n\r\nits  environment into consideration whether or not\r\n\r\nsuch  form  of  martial art is  worthwhile  to  be\r\n\r\nintroduced  to the people around. For illustration\r\n\r\npurposes, I would like to quote one example of the\r\n\r\ncommunity centres in my constituency. Martial  art\r\n\r\nclasses, such as karate, etc, are conducted in the\r\n\r\nTiong Bahru Community Centre, and many people have\r\n\r\nbeen  taking  part in these classes. A  number  of\r\n\r\npeople  who  live  around the Kim  Tian  Community\r\n\r\nCentre have also requested for such classes to  be\r\n\r\nconducted  there.  But  I opposed  the  suggestion\r\n\r\nbecause we frequently read in the newspapers about\r\n\r\ngang  fights  among secret society members  around\r\n\r\nthat  area.  So  I feel that martial  art  classes\r\n\r\nshould not be allowed in certain areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  thank  the  hon. Members who  have  spoken  in\r\n\r\nstrong support of the Bill. There is nothing  more\r\n\r\nfor me to add except to answer a few queries which\r\n\r\nMembers  have brought up. The first  is  from  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Bukit Ho Swee. He asked whether  some\r\n\r\nform  of  martial art training is being  given  to\r\n\r\nPolice  officers.  In fact,  in  the  training  of\r\n\r\nPolice  officers, they are given training on  what\r\n\r\nis  called unarmed combat. With regard to the VCs,\r\n\r\nparticularly  those  who are now  engaged  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity security force policing, they  are  also\r\n\r\nbeing  taught or given training in unarmed  combat\r\n\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the queries brought up by the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Sembawang, who  I  understand  is  an\r\n\r\nhonorary  adviser to a pugilistic association,  he\r\n\r\nasked whether the Controller of Martial Arts  will\r\n\r\nbe a person well versed in martial arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay  I say that he would have knowledge of martial\r\n\r\narts but he need not necessarily be an exponent of\r\n\r\nmartial arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked whether all martial arts\r\n\r\nassociations  must  be registered.  If  they  come\r\n\r\nwithin  the  definition of \"martial arts\"  as  has\r\n\r\nbeen  defined in the Bill, they will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nregistered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point brought up by the Member for Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru  is with regard to the definition of martial\r\n\r\narts. I have in my speech given the definition  as\r\n\r\nprovided by the Bill. \"Martial art\" is defined  to\r\n\r\ninclude  taekwondo, judo, akido, kendo,  bersilat,\r\n\r\nkung-fu,  jiu-jitsu or a combination or  variation\r\n\r\nthereof.  However,  as  I have  also  stated,  the\r\n\r\ndefinition cannot be exhaustive because it  has  a\r\n\r\nvery wide meaning, and therefore the Minister  has\r\n\r\nbeen  given  powers to declare any  other  art  of\r\n\r\npugilism, fighting, boxing or self-defence to be a\r\n\r\nmartial  art  for  the purposes of  the  Act.  The\r\n\r\npurpose  of  the Act is to control the people  who\r\n\r\nhave acquired the skill so that they would not use\r\n\r\nit  for  their  own  ends,  in  other  words,  for\r\n\r\ncriminal purposes. That is the wide basis on which\r\n\r\nthe definition is made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member brought up the specific example of tai-chi, or shadow boxing. I do not know very much\r\n\r\nabout tai-chi. From what I can gather, tai-chi  is\r\n\r\nactually a form of exercise and not necessarily  a\r\n\r\nform of self-defence where one can cause injury to\r\n\r\nanother person. If it is brought to my notice that\r\n\r\nit  can  cause  injury, then I  will  exercise  my\r\n\r\npowers under the Bill and classify it as a martial\r\n\r\nart.  If it is just a form of exercise and  cannot\r\n\r\ncause  injury, then I will not consider  it  as  a\r\n\r\nform  of  martial  art. The word  \"martial\"  means\r\n\r\n\"pertaining  to  warfare\".  So  it  must   be   an\r\n\r\naggressive art, although used in self-defence. But\r\n\r\nI  think an exponent of martial arts will be  able\r\n\r\nto  advise me whether tai-chi should or should not\r\n\r\nbe  considered  a martial art. I do  not  want  to\r\n\r\ndecide on the matter right now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point brought up by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tiong  Bahru about what sort  of  instructors\r\n\r\nwill  be  issued  with  certificates,  of  course,\r\n\r\nfirstly, they will be screened and if they have  a\r\n\r\ncriminal record, then they will not be issued with\r\n\r\ninstructors'   certificates.

The\r\n\r\nBill has arisen from Government's concern with the\r\n\r\nspeculation on residential properties  and  vacant\r\n\r\nland   and  the  consequent  escalation  in  their\r\n\r\nprices.  The  steep rise in prices is attributable\r\n\r\nto,   among  other  factors,  purchases  by   non-residents.   Those  of  our  local  citizens   and\r\n\r\npermanent residents who do not qualify for Housing\r\n\r\nBoard   flats,  therefore,  find  their  hope   of\r\n\r\npurchasing  their own homes from  private  housing\r\n\r\nestates frustrated by prices beyond their means to\r\n\r\npay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the objective of the Government to realise\r\n\r\na scheme for widespread home ownership amongst its\r\n\r\ncitizens  and permanent residents.

Permanent residents, non-citizens\r\n\r\nand  others may be allowed to purchase residential\r\n\r\nproperties or vacant lands only with the  approval\r\n\r\nof  the  Government. The imposition of a  property\r\n\r\ntax  surcharge, equal to 10 per cent of the annual\r\n\r\nvalues  of properties and land, was also announced\r\n\r\nas  a  further measure aimed at curbing  excessive\r\n\r\nspeculation in real estate and stabilising  prices\r\n\r\nof  residential properties and vacant  land.

As it is\r\n\r\ntoday,  I  think  even with  a  knowledge  of  the\r\n\r\npresent  inflationary trend, private property  and\r\n\r\nland  are  well  beyond the reach  of  the  middle\r\n\r\nincome  wage  earner. To my mind, the  proposition\r\n\r\nthat  the Government has made and the measures  it\r\n\r\nhas  taken  to  build  more  flats  and  also  the\r\n\r\nintention  to  build condominium type  of  terrace\r\n\r\nhouses  for this middle income group is  something\r\n\r\nworth pursuing. What I feel is that the Government\r\n\r\nshould step up the construction of these flats and\r\n\r\nhouses. This will probably contribute more towards\r\n\r\nthe  welfare of the middle income wage earner than\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  as such, although in principle  and  in\r\n\r\nspirit, it has laudable objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Hon.

I wonder whether these young executives are\r\n\r\nin  a  position to purchase flats built by private\r\n\r\ndevelopers. Sir, I saw an advertisement only about\r\n\r\na  week  ago on the sale of flats in the Cairnhill\r\n\r\nPlaza. The price of each flat ranges from $200,000\r\n\r\nto  $300,500.  If  someone takes  a  housing  loan\r\n\r\namounting to 80 per cent of the price of the flat,\r\n\r\npayable  in  15  years, he would  have  to  pay  a\r\n\r\nmonthly  instalment  of  over  $1,000.  I   wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  a young executive or a young professional\r\n\r\nperson, like a doctor, who earns\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  $1,200 a month can afford to buy that  sort\r\n\r\nof a house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my suggestion is this: with the increasing\r\n\r\ncost  of  building  materials,  cement  and  other\r\n\r\nthings,   perhaps  the  Government   could   allow\r\n\r\ndevelopment of certain places at a higher  density\r\n\r\nthan  the  present. This will help  to  lower  the\r\n\r\nprices  of  land, and at the same time since  more\r\n\r\nflats  could  be built this will naturally  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  price of houses. I think this is much  better\r\n\r\nthan depending only on the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard  flats. Even the HDB project in  Ulu  Pandan\r\n\r\nhas  to  be stopped for the time being because  of\r\n\r\nprice increases in building materials.

My Ministry of  Finance  has\r\n\r\nmonitored  the prices of houses since we announced\r\n\r\nthe  Government policy on this matter. We  notice,\r\n\r\nfirst  of  all,  a tendency for prices  to  remain\r\n\r\nrelatively stable. In the few cases that  we  have\r\n\r\nmonitored  in different housing estates,  we  have\r\n\r\nnoticed  a  fall in prices of 10-20 per  cent.  In\r\n\r\nother  cases, of course, we have seen  that  there\r\n\r\nwas  a  sort  of  stabilisation in the  price.  In\r\n\r\ncertain cases, however, some flats have even  gone\r\n\r\nup  in  price,  hut  this may be  due  perhaps  to\r\n\r\nfurniture  and furnishings, air-conditioning,  and\r\n\r\nso  on, which we do not know very much about.  The\r\n\r\ndata  I have are not sufficiently detailed for  an\r\n\r\nanalysis  to  be  made, but I am quite  sure  that\r\n\r\nthere  has  been some effect upon the announcement\r\n\r\nof Government's policy since last September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng was quite right in saying\r\n\r\nthat   we   should  also  build  more   flats   in\r\n\r\ncondominium  type  units  for  the  middle  income\r\n\r\ngroup.  We  certainly  are going  to  do  this.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve my colleague here has announced that  even\r\n\r\nthe Housing and Development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard is going to build some flats for people  who\r\n\r\ndo  not  qualify now as they are above the  $1,500\r\n\r\nper month household income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree that we should build these units, I\r\n\r\nthink  we  must tackle the problem  from  as  many\r\n\r\nfronts as possible, and the Bill which I am taking\r\n\r\nthrough  all  its stages here today will  help  to\r\n\r\nreduce  or stabilise prices of the kind of housing\r\n\r\nwhich  the  middle income groups may  be  able  to\r\n\r\npurchase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Changi that when it\r\n\r\ncomes  to  flats  costing $200,000  and  over,  or\r\n\r\ndetached  houses  of the same value,  it  is  very\r\n\r\nunlikely that an executive drawing $1,500 a  month\r\n\r\nwill  be able to afford the instalments, which  he\r\n\r\nwill  be  required to pay for the flat. But  there\r\n\r\nare  other  types  of housing,  like  the  terrace\r\n\r\nhouses,  semi-detached houses and flats which  are\r\n\r\nnot in the $200,000 class. I think there are flats\r\n\r\ncosting around $100,000 or even less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Even then they have to pay an\r\n\r\ninstalment of about $900 per month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> That depends also on the interest\r\n\r\nrate  which is charged, and I think many employers\r\n\r\nand  certainly  the Government and  the  statutory\r\n\r\nboards  have given housing loans at lower interest\r\n\r\nrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> On a point of clarification,\r\n\r\nSir,I am sure the Hon.

Even if  we\r\n\r\nwork  on the basis of a $100,000 flat, payable  in\r\n\r\n10  years  at 10 per cent interest per  annum,  we\r\n\r\nhave  got to pay $200,000 in 10 years, which means\r\n\r\n$20,000  per year or about $2,000 a month.  Can  a\r\n\r\nwage  earner earning $1,500 to $2,000 afford  this\r\n\r\nkind  of housing? If my figures are correct,  then\r\n\r\nit  is  not  possible for him to purchase  such  a\r\n\r\nflat.  I  think  there is a strong  case  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to step up its building programme  for\r\n\r\nthe  middle  income  wage  earners.

I am sure  the\r\n\r\nexecutive housing in Jurong is within the means of\r\n\r\nthe  junior  executives in Jurong. If any  of  our\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament wish to buy  the  kind  of\r\n\r\nexecutive flats that are being put up in Jurong, I\r\n\r\nthink  we  can easily build quite a  lot  more  in\r\n\r\naddition to what my colleague has been building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the credit squeeze, I think that\r\n\r\nis  generally applicable to purchases  of  luxury-type  apartments  and  housing,  and  it  is   not\r\n\r\nintended  for  the kind of loans  which  companies\r\n\r\nmake  to their employees. If, in fact, the  credit\r\n\r\nsqueeze  is  being operated in  a  way  which  has\r\n\r\nprevented  this,  I am sure my  Ministry  and  the\r\n\r\nMonetary  Authority of Singapore will be  prepared\r\n\r\nto  consider a relaxation of this kind  of  credit\r\n\r\ncontrol to the benefit of the middle income group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I had no intention of joining in\r\n\r\nthis debate. I am sure my colleague can look after\r\n\r\nhimself very well. But there was a point raised by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Changi that if population densities\r\n\r\nwere  higher, plot ratios increase and on a  given\r\n\r\nplot of, say, one acre, if a building goes higher,\r\n\r\nthen  the total cost will be cheaper. I agree with\r\n\r\nthat.  In  fact,  it has been the practice  of  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  relax  and  increase  plot   ratios,\r\n\r\nespecially in the heart of the City. That  is  why\r\n\r\nwe  see the high buildings that are being erected,\r\n\r\nsome  of  which have been completed. But obviously\r\n\r\nthere  is a limit beyond which we cannot  go,  and\r\n\r\nthe density aspect, of course, is just one part of\r\n\r\nthe  cost.  Costs  have gone up  because  building\r\n\r\nmaterials have gone up, and I have spelt  out  the\r\n\r\ndetails earlier on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I should clarify to the Member on this\r\n\r\npoint which has not been answered by my colleague.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N.

But I think the density ratio  plays\r\n\r\nan important part. I have some experience in this.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there has been some relaxation within  the\r\n\r\nCity  area.  But  in the periphery,  the  Building\r\n\r\nControl  Division, or the approving authority,  is\r\n\r\nstill  very  strict on allowing  a  relaxation  of\r\n\r\ndensity in certain areas. This applies not only to\r\n\r\ndevelopments  of private developers  but  also  to\r\n\r\nstatutory boards wanting to build houses for their\r\n\r\nemployees.   In   the   Minister's   constituency,\r\n\r\nTanglin,  certainly nobody can put up houses  more\r\n\r\nthan  4-storeys high. Sir, I know of  a  statutory\r\n\r\nboard  which planned to build blocks of houses  8-storeys high. There was a tremendous response from\r\n\r\nthe  employees.  But  planning  approval  was  not\r\n\r\ngiven,  and  modifications had to be  made,  after\r\n\r\nwhich the cost of each unit went up by about 25-30\r\n\r\nper cent, making it beyond the means of the junior\r\n\r\nexecutive to purchase. Perhaps what the Member for\r\n\r\nChangi said has more value than it really appears.\r\n\r\nI  think  the  Building Control Division  and  the\r\n\r\nPlanning   Office   could   also   assist   junior\r\n\r\nexecutives  to purchase flats and bring  down  the\r\n\r\ncost by relaxing the density ratio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I think that point deserves a\r\n\r\nreply.  Firstly, I think the hon. Member does  not\r\n\r\nknow  exactly  the boundaries of  my  constituency\r\n\r\nwhen  he said that housing development is confined\r\n\r\nto 4-storey flats. To give him an example, he will\r\n\r\nfind  that flats opposite the Botanic Gardens have\r\n\r\ngone far, far beyond the 4-storey height which  he\r\n\r\nhas referred to. And that is not the only place in\r\n\r\nTanglin.  Tanglin stretches from Lido  Theatre  to\r\n\r\nthe MacRitchie Reservoir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding densities, we have been allowing\r\n\r\ndevelopers to build higher and higher.  But  if  a\r\n\r\ndeveloper had bought a piece of land knowing  that\r\n\r\nthe  plot ratio is 3:1, and then having bought  it\r\n\r\nexpect to get a plot ratio of 10:1, it means he is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  make a lot of money, and the prices  of\r\n\r\nland  will  still go much higher. But  there  have\r\n\r\nbeen   many  cases  where  the  ratios  have  been\r\n\r\nrelaxed, especially in town where the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplot  ratio  is  now 10:1. It  used  to  be  3:1\r\n\r\nbefore.  That is why there are buildings going  up\r\n\r\nto  50  storeys. There is one developer who wanted\r\n\r\nto  go  up  to  100. Every developer in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwants to go higher and higher. He builds 36, I  go\r\n\r\n37.  Someone else goes 50. They all want to go the\r\n\r\nhighest. So there must be some planning control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know the particular statutory board that\r\n\r\nthe  Member has referred to, but statutory  boards\r\n\r\nare   given  special  attention  by  my  Ministry.\r\n\r\nObviously  we cannot favour statutory  boards  and\r\n\r\ngive  them high plot ratios when perhaps next door\r\n\r\nwe  have confined a private developer to a certain\r\n\r\nplot  ratio.  But  I agree with Members  that  the\r\n\r\nprice of land bears an important part to the total\r\n\r\nprice.  Hence  Government's measures  to  try  and\r\n\r\nbring  down the price of land, and this Bill helps\r\n\r\nto  further stabilise the price of land.  We  have\r\n\r\nsucceeded  to  some extent, as  my  colleague  has\r\n\r\npointed  out, in bringing down the prices of  land\r\n\r\nby  about  20 per cent in some cases. We  hope  it\r\n\r\nwill  stay  that way, and does not rocket  to  the\r\n\r\nskies again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Hon Sui Sen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COMPANIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for introducing this Bill are the\r\n\r\nsame  as  those  I  mentioned in  introducing  the\r\n\r\namending  Acts of 1971 and 1973, namely,  to  give\r\n\r\neffect to recommendations by the U.K. Jenkins\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee   Report   on   Company   Law    Reform,\r\n\r\nparticularly   insofar  as  these  recommendations\r\n\r\naffect  the  principle  of greater  disclosure  of\r\n\r\ninformation  by  companies as a safeguard  against\r\n\r\nmalpractices   and  the  powers  and   duties   of\r\n\r\ndirectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclosure of information is an essential part of\r\n\r\nthe  working  of a free and fair economic  system,\r\n\r\nsubject  to  certain  limitations  to  allow   for\r\n\r\ncompetitive     situations.     Under     existing\r\n\r\nlegislation, substantial powers already  exist  to\r\n\r\nrequire  disclosure by directors in their accounts\r\n\r\nor  in relation to contracts in which they have an\r\n\r\ninterest,  or  in any dealings they  may  have  in\r\n\r\ntheir  company shares (including insider dealings)\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill extends the disclosure principle by\r\n\r\nrequiring  that  the interests  of  members  of  a\r\n\r\ndirector's  family in contracts with  the  company\r\n\r\nshall be treated as an interest of a director  and\r\n\r\nwill  need  to  be  disclosed to fellow  directors\r\n\r\n(clause  14),  and  by requiring  a  director  who\r\n\r\nacquires  or  disposes of shares  in  his  company\r\n\r\nwhich  are listed on a Stock Exchange to notify  a\r\n\r\nStock  Exchange which may publish the  information\r\n\r\n(clause 17), and by providing that there should be\r\n\r\nclear  and specific disclosure in general  meeting\r\n\r\nof any alteration in directors' emoluments (clause\r\n\r\n18).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a previous occasion in this House, I have made\r\n\r\nthe  point that there is nothing inherently  wrong\r\n\r\nin the practice of holding shares through nominees\r\n\r\nand  there  are many circumstances  in  which  the\r\n\r\npractice   is   both  normal  and  convenient   on\r\n\r\ncommercial  and  personal grounds. However,  there\r\n\r\nare  circumstances  in  which  concealment  of   a\r\n\r\nbeneficial  interest  in  a  shareholding  can  be\r\n\r\nundesirable. I refer particularly to the situation\r\n\r\nknown  as  \"warehousing\", in  which  a  number  of\r\n\r\nparties act in undisclosed concert in such  a  way\r\n\r\nas not to bring their interest within the existing\r\n\r\nprovisions  dealing with substantial shareholders.\r\n\r\nThese  provisions  require  that  those  with   an\r\n\r\ninterest in the equity of a company of 10 per cent\r\n\r\nor  more  have to disclose their interest. Persons\r\n\r\ncan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevade  the  provisions by acting  in  concert  and\r\n\r\nacquiring shareholdings amounting to, for example,\r\n\r\n9.5 per cent. This enables such persons to acquire\r\n\r\nby  stealth  a  dominant position  in  a  company,\r\n\r\nparticularly in a take-over situation.  Government\r\n\r\nconsiders  that the risk of abuse of  the  nominee\r\n\r\nsystem  in  this regard will be minimised  if  the\r\n\r\nnotification  percentage is reduced  from  10  per\r\n\r\ncent  to  5 per cent, and if the notification,  in\r\n\r\nwhich   changes  or  cessation  of  a  substantial\r\n\r\nshareholding  are to be given to the  company,  is\r\n\r\nreduced from 14 days to seven days (clause  9).  A\r\n\r\nfurther provision is inserted which will enable  a\r\n\r\ncompany  to  know  if  a  warehouse  situation  is\r\n\r\ndeveloping  or if it is a target for  a  take-over\r\n\r\nbid.  This  provision confers  the  right  upon  a\r\n\r\ncompany  to  ascertain the real  identity  of  the\r\n\r\nowners of its shares (clause 12).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other major amendments proposed in the Bill are\r\n\r\nconcerned with the powers and duties of directors.\r\n\r\nClause 15 lays down in a new section 132B that the\r\n\r\nmatter  in  which  directors  of  a  company   are\r\n\r\nentitled  to have regard are the interest  of  its\r\n\r\nemployees  as well as its members. This  provision\r\n\r\nserves to emphasise the duty that a company has to\r\n\r\nits  employees and may be compared with  clause  4\r\n\r\nwhich includes amongst the powers of a company  to\r\n\r\nmake  provision for the benefit of  employees  and\r\n\r\nformer   employees  upon  the  cessation  of   the\r\n\r\nbusiness of a company or any subsidiary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause introduces two new provisions which\r\n\r\nare important. In section 132D it is provided that\r\n\r\napproval  of  a  company  in  general  meeting  is\r\n\r\nrequired  before  directors  of  a  company  issue\r\n\r\nshares. The unfettered discretion of directors  to\r\n\r\nissue   shares  (once  authorised)  has  sometimes\r\n\r\nworked  to  the  detriment  of  shareholders,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  by  diluting  shareholders'  capital  in\r\n\r\ncertain  circumstances.  The  imposition  of   the\r\n\r\nproposed  form of control will apply to the  issue\r\n\r\nof shares for cash or for other consideration. Its\r\n\r\neffect   will   be   to  give  more   control   to\r\n\r\nshareholders without interfering unduly  with  the\r\n\r\ndirectors' business of managing the company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions in section l32C is a restatement\r\n\r\nof the law as at present appears in section 35 (3)\r\n\r\nof  the  Act. Power is given to the court  on  the\r\n\r\napplication of a member of the company to  prevent\r\n\r\ndirectors from carrying into effect proposals  for\r\n\r\ndisposing of the whole or substantially the  whole\r\n\r\nof  the company's undertaking or property; but  if\r\n\r\ndirectors contravene this requirement that such  a\r\n\r\ndisposal  should  be approved by  the  company  in\r\n\r\ngeneral meeting the transaction will not affect  a\r\n\r\npurchaser  for  consideration  who  acquires   the\r\n\r\nproperty    without   actual   notice    of    the\r\n\r\ncontravention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 introduces a new section 133A which\r\n\r\nprohibits in subsection (1) thereof a company from\r\n\r\nmaking a loan to another company or to provide any\r\n\r\nsecurity   for  a  loan  to  another  company   if\r\n\r\ndirectors  have an interest in the shares  of  the\r\n\r\nother  company equal to one-fifth or more  of  the\r\n\r\nnominal  value  of its equity share  capital;  and\r\n\r\nalso prohibits loans to persons who are members of\r\n\r\nthe  family  of any of its directors.  There  are,\r\n\r\nhowever, certain specific exclusions in subsection\r\n\r\n(3)  of  this section which should be  noted.  The\r\n\r\ninterest  of  a member of a director's  family  is\r\n\r\ntreated  as  an interest of the director  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes  of subsection (1). The purpose  of  this\r\n\r\namendment is to close a loophole which at  present\r\n\r\nexists   under  section  133  of  the  Act   which\r\n\r\nprohibits  a  company  from making  loans  to  its\r\n\r\ndirectors.  This  section can be  circumvented  by\r\n\r\nmaking  loans to a company in which a director  of\r\n\r\nthe lending company has effective control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining major amendment to which I would\r\n\r\nwish  to  comment upon appears in clause 19  which\r\n\r\namends  section  179 dealing with take-overs.  The\r\n\r\npurpose of this amendment is to clarify the status\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers.\r\n\r\nThe  Code  is  not  a statutory  code  but  it  is\r\n\r\nintended that it should have statutory backing and\r\n\r\nshould  have  a  locus standi in relation  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  For  this  reason  it  is   expressly\r\n\r\nrecognised   by  statute  as  is  the   Securities\r\n\r\nIndustry  Council which administers  it.  Although\r\n\r\nthe Code is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmodelled  on  the  City  Code  on  Take-overs  and\r\n\r\nMergers, that Code has not been recognised in  any\r\n\r\nlegislation in the United Kingdom - it is regarded\r\n\r\npurely as a measure for voluntary self-regulation.\r\n\r\nThe Government takes the view that for the Code to\r\n\r\nbe  really effective something more than  this  is\r\n\r\nneeded  although we still adhere to our conviction\r\n\r\nthat,  in the highly technical field of take-overs\r\n\r\nand  mergers, a non-statutory code is a better way\r\n\r\nof  dealing  with  this subject  than  by  Act  of\r\n\r\nParliament. The new subsection makes it clear that\r\n\r\nbreach of the Code is not a criminal offence.  The\r\n\r\nCode  may  be  revised from time to time  and  the\r\n\r\npublic  will  be  advised  of  such  revision   by\r\n\r\nnotification   in  the  Gazette.

These amendments appear in clause  2\r\n\r\n(dealing  with dealer's licences),  in  clause  19\r\n\r\n(repealing Part VIII of the Act which provides for\r\n\r\ninvestment of stockbroker's funds) and  in  clause\r\n\r\n23   which  makes  new  provision  for  the  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange fidelity fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal with these three topics in numerical\r\n\r\norder.  At  the  time the Act was drafted  persons\r\n\r\ncould   carry  on  the  business  of  dealing   in\r\n\r\nsecurities  as  a  sole trader, as  partner  in  a\r\n\r\nmember  firm  or as director of a member  company.\r\n\r\nThis  is  no  longer the position. Under  the  new\r\n\r\nStock   Exchange  rules  only  persons   who   are\r\n\r\ndirectors of a member company can now be  admitted\r\n\r\nas members of the Stock Exchange. The intention of\r\n\r\nclause 2 is, therefore, to reflect the position as\r\n\r\nit  exists on the Stock Exchange by providing that\r\n\r\na  dealer's  licence shall be granted  only  to  a\r\n\r\ncorporation.  The great merit in  this  conceptual\r\n\r\nchange   is   that  corporations  that   deal   in\r\n\r\nsecurities  will be subject not only  to  the  Act\r\n\r\nitself but also to the detailed provisions of  the\r\n\r\nCompanies  Act  (Cap. 185). This will  undoubtedly\r\n\r\noperate  to the advantage of the investing  public\r\n\r\nbecause of the greater measure of control that can\r\n\r\nbe  exercised through the Companies Act. Under the\r\n\r\nexisting  provisions stockbrokers are required  to\r\n\r\ntake  out an individual dealer's licence but under\r\n\r\nthe  new  proposals they will be  required  to  be\r\n\r\nlicensed as dealers' representatives, that  is  to\r\n\r\nsay,  as  representatives of the corporation  that\r\n\r\nemploys   them   or  with  which  they   have   an\r\n\r\narrangement   as   directors.  The   position   of\r\n\r\nremisiers will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nremain unchanged in this regard for they also will\r\n\r\nbe  required  to  take  out licences  as  dealers'\r\n\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 14 will have the\r\n\r\nadditional advantage of streamlining the licensing\r\n\r\nprovisions  and  make  the administration  of  the\r\n\r\nlicensing provisions and the regulations  so  much\r\n\r\nthe easier. Accordingly, all references in the Act\r\n\r\nto  dealers  who are partners in a  firm  or  sole\r\n\r\ndealers  have been deleted, and the Act  has  been\r\n\r\nfurther amended in various respects to give effect\r\n\r\nto the new concept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VIII of the Act which deals with investment\r\n\r\nof  stockbroker's  funds is repealed  though  this\r\n\r\nwill  not  affect the obligation of  a  dealer  to\r\n\r\nmaintain a trust account under other provisions of\r\n\r\nthe  Act.  Experience has shown that the  existing\r\n\r\nPart  VIII presents serious practical difficulties\r\n\r\nto  the  Stock Exchange if it is to be implemented\r\n\r\neffectively.  As required by the existing  section\r\n\r\n54,  the member company must deposit with a  stock\r\n\r\nexchange  an  amount that is  not  less  than  the\r\n\r\nprescribed  part  of  the lowest  balance  in  the\r\n\r\ncompany's trust account during the relevant period\r\n\r\n(i.e.  12  months). This formula is  difficult  to\r\n\r\nimplement  since it is not possible for the  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange  to  know  the lowest  balance  unless  a\r\n\r\nmember  company submits daily bank  statements  or\r\n\r\ncash  books  -  this  would place  an  unnecessary\r\n\r\nburden upon member companies and lead to all kinds\r\n\r\nof   practical   difficulties.  Furthermore,   the\r\n\r\nrequirement  in this Part that the Stock  Exchange\r\n\r\nhas to place its deposits from member companies in\r\n\r\ninterest  bearing  accounts  with  banks   creates\r\n\r\nfurther problems since money so deposited with the\r\n\r\nStock  Exchange are repayable upon  demand.  There\r\n\r\nis,  in  any event, no need, having regard to  the\r\n\r\nnew  provision inserted in this Part  of  the  Act\r\n\r\ndealing  with fidelity funds, for interest derived\r\n\r\nfrom  investment  of  deposits  received  by   the\r\n\r\nExchange to be credited to a fidelity fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the fidelity fund provisions\r\n\r\nthemselves, some significant changes are proposed.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the Fidelity Fund of the Stock\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExchange  of Singapore stands at over  $2  million\r\n\r\nthough  section 68 of the Act envisages an  amount\r\n\r\nof  $1 million. This large amount of fund money is\r\n\r\nderived mainly from the transfer from the fidelity\r\n\r\nfund  that  was held jointly by the Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaysian    Stock   Exchange   and    not    from\r\n\r\ncontributions   to   the   fund   by    individual\r\n\r\nstockbrokers.  Having regard to the present  state\r\n\r\nof  fidelity  fund  as well as the  proposals  for\r\n\r\nincreasing the fund by annual transfers  from  the\r\n\r\nStock  Exchange General Fund, Government considers\r\n\r\nthat   the   requirement  in   section   67   that\r\n\r\nstockbrokers should make an annual contribution of\r\n\r\n$1,000  -  which is, in any event, a comparatively\r\n\r\nsmall  amount bearing in mind the total membership\r\n\r\nof the Exchange - to the fund, is not necessary as\r\n\r\nregards the existing Stock Exchange and inadequate\r\n\r\nif  another stock exchange is created; for  annual\r\n\r\ncontributions  are not likely to be sufficient  to\r\n\r\nmeet  any liabilities that might arise due to  the\r\n\r\nfailure  of  even  one  member  company.   It   is\r\n\r\nessential  that  a  substantial  amount  of  money\r\n\r\nshould  already  be  in  a fidelity  fund  on  its\r\n\r\nestablishment. Under the new sections 67 and 68  a\r\n\r\nfidelity  fund will consist of an amount  that  is\r\n\r\nnot  less than $2 million or such other sum as the\r\n\r\nMinister  may  by order determine.  This  fidelity\r\n\r\nfund  will be increased annually by payments  into\r\n\r\nit  of a sum that is equal to 10 per cent or  more\r\n\r\nof  the  net  income  of a stock  exchange.  If  a\r\n\r\nfidelity fund falls below $2 million or such other\r\n\r\nsum  as  the Minister may determine, the Committee\r\n\r\nof  a stock exchange shall take such steps to make\r\n\r\nup  the  deficiency as are provided for in section\r\n\r\n68.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at any time a fidelity fund is not sufficient\r\n\r\nto  meet  liabilities, the Committee may impose  a\r\n\r\nlevy  of such amount as it thinks fit on a  member\r\n\r\ncompany but this levy must not exceed $100,000  in\r\n\r\nthe aggregate (clause 24).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other amendments that call for special\r\n\r\nmention  appear in clause 33 which amends  section\r\n\r\n95 of the Act and in clause 3 which amends section\r\n\r\n7.  The  amendment  to  section  95  empowers  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  to  compound the less serious  offences\r\n\r\nwhich are punishable only by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na   fine  whether  under  the  Act  or  under  the\r\n\r\nRegulations. This provision is a standard one  and\r\n\r\nis to be found in many of our Acts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment proposed in clause 3 is designed to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the  administration  of  the  Act   in\r\n\r\nrelation  to the Minister's approval of amendments\r\n\r\nproposed  to  Stock Exchange Rules.  The  existing\r\n\r\nprovision   in   section  7  has  proved   to   be\r\n\r\ninappropriate  and inconvenient for  it  does  not\r\n\r\nallow sufficient time for the Minister to consider\r\n\r\nthe   matter,  particularly  where  as   in   most\r\n\r\ninstances the Securities Industry Council is asked\r\n\r\nto make its recommendations to the Minister on the\r\n\r\nproposed amendments. The time element referred  to\r\n\r\nin  the  existing  provision has accordingly  been\r\n\r\ndeleted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Hon Sui Sen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>JETTY AT KRANJI INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion* standing in the name of the Minister for Law and National Development, as it appears on the Order Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* The motion reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270),\r\n\r\napproves the construction by Government of a jetty within the foreshore at Kranji\r\n\r\nIndustrial Estate as shown coloured red on the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE PLAN NO. 2/74\", \r\n\r\nwhich is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.'\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon.
