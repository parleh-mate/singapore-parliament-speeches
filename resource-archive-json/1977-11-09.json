This incident arose when a team of detectives from Joo Chiat Police Station picked up seven drivers of Datsun taxis at Paya Lebar Airport. These drivers were taken to Joo Chiat Police Station for questioning regarding an incident involving a taxi driver who was alleged to have driven off his taxi with baggage belonging to a passenger. Unfortunately, the other taxi drivers at the Airport that night were not informed of the reason for picking up the seven taxi drivers in question. Due to the confusion and uncertainty created, some of the taxi drivers decided to stop work. Other taxis, particularly radio taxis, continued to pick up passengers. The number of passengers affected was small, numbering less than 40. All the taxi drivers resumed normal operations at about 1.30 a.m. on Tuesday morning when the seven drivers returned to the Airport. By then, nearly all the passengers had left the Airport. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Registrar of Vehicles takes a very serious view of taxi drivers who refuse to ply for hire during their working hours.

No other details were then available, either about the aircraft, hijackers or how it all arose. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 1624 hours the hijacked aircraft established radio contact with our Joint Air Traffic Control Centre (JATCC) and identified itself as belonging to Air Vietnam. Its position was then reported as 40 miles north of Mersing. The pilot requested for permission to land at Singapore Airport. When JATCC refused their request to land, the pilot pleaded that he must land at Singapore Airport because the aircraft was short of fuel. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 1657 hours the pilot reported that he had only 35 minutes of fuel left and repeated his request to land in Singapore. At this point the pilot also informed our JATCC that there were four hijackers armed with knives and pistols, two dead bodies and 34 passengers on board. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the aircraft was observed on radar to be still heading towards Paya Lebar, it was directed towards Seletar Airport. The aircraft landed at Seletar Airport at 1730 hours after landing instructions and weather information were given to the pilot. It was directed to park on the northern- most taxiway facing west. Immediately after the aircraft was parked, Police Reserve Unit troops who had arrived earlier at 1706 hours at Seletar Airport took up position surrounding the aircraft. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the aircraft landed, several government officers, members of a committee to handle such emergencies, arrived and proceeded to the Seletar Airport Control Tower and were in communication with the pilot. At 1758 hours the pilot of the hijacked aircraft relayed a message seeking contact with government authorities. He confirmed that there were 34 passengers on board and two crew members were dead. Following exchanges between the pilot and the Control Tower, two persons from the aircraft and two government representatives met on the tarmac. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Permanent Secretary (Home Affairs) had as Chairman of this group of officers taken decisions on the courses of action to be taken, in the light of the facts then available. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiations continued until the hijackers agreed to surrender their arms. They surrendered their arms at 1945 hours. Immediately after that the injured person was brought down for treatment. After initial medical attention at the tarmac and the Base Sick Bay the injured person was taken away and admitted to Toa Payoh Hospital. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passengers who had in the meanwhile come down were then moved to the Airport Terminal Building where they were given refreshments before being transported to the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> dining hall of a SAF Unit in Seletar Airport to be fed and subsequently bedded in the barracks for the night. The four hijackers were placed under guard and subsequently taken away by officers of the CID Special Investigation Section for questioning. The aircraft was thereafter cleared by the Bomb Disposal Unit. At 0130 hours on 30th October 1977 the pilot and co-pilot were offered to the press for an interview on the hijack incident. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Civil Aviation officials with the help of the staff of several companies engaged in refuelling, servicing and ground handling of aircrafts in Seletar Airport, worked through the night to prepare the aircraft for take-off. A post-mortem on the two dead bodies was also arranged and conducted during this time and completed by daybreak. Opportunity was also taken during the night to take statements from eye witnesses, the pilot and co-pilot on what actually took place in the aircraft when it was hijacked. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 0814 hours after breakfast, the passengers were taken to the aircraft for boarding.

It requires the officer to enforce the law with commonsense, judgment and understanding. This policy applies equally to enforcement action against pedestrian offenders. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparation for the enforcement of the Pedestrian Crossing Rules, in-service training sessions were held to impart the various complexities of the law to those who were to enforce the rules. The training also emphasised the need to exercise discretion and commonsense in enforcement as well as to be courteous at all times. From then on, further in-service training sessions for enforcement officers were held periodically to review and acquaint them with the various problems that were learnt from hindsight. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like most intersections, the junction at Maxwell Road/Wallich Street/Anson Road is boxed by pedestrian crossings on all sides. However, the roads do not intersect at right angles and it is, therefore, necessary to put up additional signs. Apart from these there is no unusual marking that is likely to be a source of confusion. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, complaints from motorists that. Vehicles approaching Wallich Street from Anson Road would have to stop twice to give way to pedestrians. In situations such as the junction in question a trade-off is often unavoidable. In this case, the convenience of motorists has to be partly sacrificed to ensure the safety of pedestrians. Nonetheless, the Traffic Police will keep the matter under review, to see how this inconvenience on the part of the motorists can be kept to the minimum without sacrificing the safety of pedestrians. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr P.

Will the Hon. Minister instruct the Traffic Police to alter the situation so as to make it easier for pedestrians to cross there? Even Police constables do not know the rules, and innocent pedestrians are being booked. When pedestrians cross with green light, they suddenly have to stop at the red light. I suggest that the Minister visit this junction one day. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think confusion is caused by the way the pedestrian crossings were drawn up. I think the confusion may be partly caused by the fact that there are too many intersections at that road junction. But as far as the Traffic Police is concerned, they have drawn these signs in the best way possible to minimise the confusion. They have done so. But, as I have said, they will review the situation and if they find that there is a better way of doing it, they will make the necessary alteration. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should be glad if the Member for Anson would take me there one day to view the intersection. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr P.

In fact, the only solution to the problem of getting pedestrians to brisk up when crossing is to install red-and-green man signals at these junctions. Once these red-and-green man signals are installed, we can regulate the time for crossing. When we want the pedestrians to cross briskly, we introduce the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> blinking sign, and when it blinks the pedestrian will have to cross briskly.

With retirements, deaths and other withdrawals from the labour force are deducted, the net annual increase will be about 26,000 persons per year. To create enough new jobs for this annual increment in the labour force, our GDP will have to grow at between 6-8% annually. While for this year we are likely to achieve this, the prospects for doing so will be uncertain in future. Our economic fortunes are tied to those of the industrialised countries on whom we depend for export markets. Recovery in the world economy has been slow as major industrialised countries fear the resurgence of inflation, if economic recovery is too rapid. In addition, there are growing tendencies in the world towards protectionism which will affect our exports. Our status as a developing country is also being questioned. In the light of those problems, our workers and especially the new entrants to the labour force, must be more productive, more flexible, less choosy, and less inclined towards job-hopping if we are to be able to compete effectively in international markets and therefore achieve our growth targets. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of new jobs in the next five years will have to be created in the private sector - in manufacturing, transport, storage and communications, as well as in the other services sector. For the Civil Service over the next five years, the emphasis will be towards \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> increasing the efficiency of existing staff through better supervision, redeployment, and mechanisation of systems and procedures. Increases in the Government wage bill must be matched by increases in productivity. With an existing establishment vacancy of more than 9,000 persons at present, it is not envisaged that many more new posts will be created in the next five years. There will be stringent control on increases in manpower. New posts will only be created if they are fully justified on the basis of new functions in connection with new development projects, new legislation or reorganisation. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> A supplementary question, Sir.

The agreement with British Airways underscores the esteem of travellers for SIA from 13th place in 1970 to first place in triennial surveys in 1973 and 1976. SIA's partnership in a supersonic service will increase its aviation competence and business potential. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIA will have the opportunity to acquire experience, over a period of time, of a now and advanced technology. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entry of the Concorde into Singapore will consolidate Singapore's position as the communications crossroads of the Asia/Pacific region. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If by \"controversies\" the Member is referring to the long and eventually unsuccessful struggle by the Port of New York Authority to keep the Concorde out of Kennedy International Airport, the answer is, yes. Singapore has to examine the impact of Concorde on the environment in the light of its own circumstances. The Department of Civil Aviation is satisfied that a thrice-weekly service by the Concorde will not damage the environment, certainly no more than it does in London or Paris, Washington or New York. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>DEPARTMENTAL STATISTICS BASED ON CONSTITUENCIES</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Compilation)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. \n  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether he will consider requesting Government departments and agencies to look into the feasibility of compiling departmental statistics on the basis of constituency boundaries so that such statistics could reflect the problems prevailing in each constituency. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at present, some statistics are already compiled on a constituency basis, such as the annual statistics on births and deaths and the Census of Population which provides information on age, sex structure and socio-economic characteristics of the population.

If such marriages continue to be contracted, I would like to point out that, firstly, in the eyes of Muslim law these marriages are not valid. The status of \"husband and wife\" is illegal according to Islamic law, and therefore their children are illegitimate. Secondly, there is the question of division of property. If the husband dies and since the wife is not a Muslim, problems of distribution of property can arise.

Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr E.W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Addendum to the President's Speech at the Opening of the Fourth Parliament, Honourable Members were informed that the licence fees for markets, food centres and street hawkers would be revised. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These licence fees were last revised in 1970 but were and are still less than the economic rental. Since then, the cost of maintaining and building new markets and food centres has increased. It is felt that hawkers should pay their share of these higher costs. Government has therefore decided to revise the licence fees. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed revision is set out in three Schedules (Cols. 191 - 196) which have been circulated to Members and should be lying on their seats. The revision will rationalise some of the fees for markets and food centres eliminating the discrepancy in the fees paid by stallholders to the Ministry of the Environment and to the Housing and Development Board. \n  <br> \n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1977/19771109/19771109-HA-0370191.htm\">Schedules - EXISTING AND PROPOSED MONTHLY FEES FOR MARKETS/HAWKER CENTRES, EXISTING AND PROPOSED FEES FOR STREET HAWKERS, MISCELLANEOUS FEES (Cols. 191 - 196)</a> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases will be introduced in three phases, in January 1978. January 1979 and January 1980. The licensees will thus be able to absorb the increases without suffering undue hardship. Care has been taken to relate the proposed fees to the sale and profit margins of different goods. For example, retail vegetable licensees whose commodities are perishable and less profitable will pay less than the cooked food, fruit and piece and sundry goods hawkers. The licence fees for poultry hawkers will be higher because their business occupies more space, poses greater pollution and maintenance problems and their profit margins are higher. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooked food, fruit and piece and sundry goods hawkers in the Ministry of the Environment's markets and food centres pay licence fees for two sessions. However, these hawkers in H D B markets and food centres, at present, pay rental equivalent to the licence fee for one session only. It is proposed to do away with this discrepancy. Henceforth, all such hawkers in HDB markets and food centres will pay the same fees as those in the Ministry's markets and food centres. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for street hawkers, fees will continue to be charged on a per session basis, because for a number of these sites, the hours of hawking have to be stipulated and restricted as the sites are required for other uses such as car parks. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the first phase of the revision, about 13,000 or 50% of the total number of our hawkers will pay an additional $5 per month, about 5,300 or 23% roughly, will pay an additional $10 per month, and the remainder an additional $15 to $60 per month. Vegetable, egg, bean cake and noodle, assorted ground spices and sea food hawkers will only pay a small increase of $5 per month. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These modest increases are spread over three years and should not justify any increase in the prices of hawkers' goods. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the Minister be able to inform this House \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> whether this measure to increase hawker licence fees is being introduced just because the hawkers have not been paying income tax? Or whether the Government has plans to introduce measures to make the hawkers pay income tax. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I have set out the reasons for the increase plainly and clearly. It has got nothing to do with income tax. Some feel that those few hawkers who make a lot of money rightly should pay income tax. My own view is that the majority should not pay income tax. But this is not for me to decide. A proper question directed to the proper quarters will get a correct answer. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice from the Schedule of the proposed revision that the Ministry of the Environment hawker centres and markets have got two classes, namely, Class A and Class B, whereas the HDB hawker centres and markets have only one class, not specified. In the proposed revision, there are again two categories, Class A and Class B. May I ask the Hon. Minister how will the HDB hawker centres and markets be classified? That is my first question. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is: would the Minister consider classifying the hawker centres and markets in Whampoa under Class B? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Ministry's hawker centres have been divided into Class A and Class B because some hawkers make more money than others. They are, in fact, classified according to districts. For instance, in the central area the hawkers are classified as Class A whereas the hawkers in the rural areas make less money and therefore are classified as Class B. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the HDB ones, I do not know the details. The fees are set out in the Schedule. For instance, Retail Vegetable, HDB, the existing fee is $15; for the Ministry of the Environment, the existing fee for Class A is $15 and for Class B it is $10. With the revision, it will be $20 for Class A and $15 for Class B in the first phase.

But I am not the Minister in charge of the Housing and Development Board. I used to be. Since then I have moved to the Environment Ministry. Once again, I am not passing the buck.

The objective of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill therefore is to streamline and update the present Act for the purposes of clarity. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New sections 7A to 7O in clause 9 have been introduced to give the authorities more \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> power to tighten up the law in respect of collection of taxes. Section 7F seeks to impose a penalty of three times the amount of tax payable on a vehicle if any person is found guilty of intentionally evading tax payable on his vehicle. At present, there is no provision for the Court to recover unpaid vehicle licence fees or taxes due to the Registrar of Vehicles. Penalties in the form of fines imposed by the Court very often are less than the amounts due. Unrecovered fees and taxes amounted to $2.4 million as at 1st January 1977 despite the efforts made to collect them. Another $93,000 have been written off by Government since September 1975. The proposed amendment will, therefore, discourage persons from evading payment of vehicle licence fees or taxes. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no provision in the Road Traffic Act for a person who has been disqualified from driving to require him to surrender his driving licence to the Court or to the Registrar of Vehicles. Consequently, such persons who have been disqualified from driving continue to drive although it is an offence for them to do so. As there is no endorsement on the driving licence to indicate that they have been disqualified from driving, very often such persons manage to escape detection whenever they are spot-checked by Police Enforcement Officers. The amendment proposed by clause 16 of the Bill makes it mandatory for motorists who have been disqualified from driving to surrender their driving licences. This will ensure that only qualified drivers are allowed on our roads. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Road Traffic Act, a person being carried on a goods vehicle is not guilty of an offence if he disregards the advice of the driver or the owner of the vehicle concerning his own safety while being so carried. In cases of this nature, under the present Road Traffic Act, the driver is held guilty of an offence for carrying a passenger in a dangerous manner and in addition to punishment under section 77 of the Act, he is also penalised under the Road \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Traffic (Demerit Points) Rule. As this may not be fair to the driver of the owner, an amendment is proposed whereby the passenger or the person carried on the vehicle is also liable for the commission of the offence. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April this year. Government announced that the use of seat belts in motor vehicles will be made compulsory. New sections have been provided in the Bill to empower the Minister to make rules in readiness for this event. This is found in clause 20. The Registrar of Vehicles will also be empowered to penalise any person who sells seat belts which are not of the approved type. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 32 of the Bill seeks to repeal and re-enact section 72 of the principal Act to enable the Minister to make rules for the safety of pedestrians. The existing fine of up to $100 for such offenders is insufficient deterrent to motorists who do not give way at pedestrian crossings. Stiffer penalties will, therefore, have to be imposed on errant motorists who do not observe the rules. A fine of up to a maximum of $1,000 or a jail term up to three months will be imposed on first conviction. For a second and subsequent conviction, a fine of up to $2,000 or jail for a term not exceeding six months will be imposed. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage the driver ownership of taxis, a provision has been made in the Bill to empower the Registrar of Vehicles to revoke taxi licences which are held by persons who are not licensed taxi drivers or taxi owners who have been found not to be driving their taxis regularly. A taxi driver who holds more than one taxi licence will have all but one of his licences revoked. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Ong Teng Cheong]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee, reported without amendment, read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>4.02 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Professional Engineers Act, 1970, University of Singapore graduates must have two years' practical experience for registration as professional engineers. However, corporate members of the Institution of Engineers, Singapore, and other professional bodies approved by the Professional Engineers Board are automatically entitled to registration.

There will be no let-up in the efforts to eradicate the illegal supply of controlled drugs in Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, equally important in this war against the drug problem is the need to curb the demand for the drugs. As long as there is high demand, there will be some people who will continue to risk the heavy penalties. to meet the demand. It was to curb and cut down this demand that Operation Ferret was launched on 1st April 1977. The Operation has been highly successful, as reflected in the large number of addicts and abusers being arrested and sent to the DRCs. While in the DRCs, the addicts and abusers are given cold turkey treatment, and then physical exercise to tone up their bodies. They are then given work to inculcate in them work discipline and then counselled on the evils of drug abuse. On their release, they are put under \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> compulsory supervision and aftercare to reduce their chances of relapse. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that these measures could be carried out more effectively, the Misuse of Drugs Act was reviewed to make it more comprehensive. Hence we have this Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill before the House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill seeks to provide for the appointment of Advisory Committees for the purpose of assisting in the administration of the Act. The drug problem is multi-faceted and its solution requires the contributions and actions by various Government departments and bodies as well as voluntary organisations outside. The Advisory Committees will help in coordinating the various departmental functions and also in identifying new measures in tackling the problem, particularly those relating to treatment and rehabilitation. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4, 5 and 6 are amendments required to bring about more effective and efficient operation by enforcement agencies in detecting and arresting persons who have committed offences under the Act. Since the drug problem has spread to every sector of the population, officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau have to be assisted by the regular and special Police Officers (SCs) and members of the Vigilante Corps to saturate areas and haunts where drug addicts and abusers congregate. The power of arrest has, therefore, to be extended to members of the Special Constabulary and the Vigilante Corps. Clause 6 seeks to extend the power to require a person to provide his urine specimen to a Police Officer not below the rank of Sergeant. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the amendment Bill seeks to provide for a deterrent sentence of a minimum of three years' imprisonment on any person who has a previous conviction for consuming a controlled drug and who again commits such an offence while under supervision. A previous conviction for drug consumption includes that imposed by a Military Court constituted under the Singapore Armed Forces Act, 1972. This deterrent sentence is necessary to bring the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> message to recalcitrant drug addicts that the Government does not intend to see that time, money and efforts spent in rehabilitating them should go down the drain. Further, it would also put these recalcitrant drug addicts out of circulation for a longer period, thereby reducing the demand for drugs as well as preventing them from contaminating and influencing others into drug addiction. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to the large number of drug addicts and abusers who have to be sent to DRCs for treatment and rehabilitation, it is necessary that the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau has the power to delegate part of his responsibility to his Deputy Director. Clause 8 gives him that power. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 also provides for a person who has been ordered by the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau to be admitted to a DRC to be detained in the DRC for a period of six months for treatment and rehabilitation. This period is normally considered the minimum period required to treat and rehabilitate a drug abuser so that chances of relapse will be minimised. But for relapse cases and hardcore addicts, the period of treatment and rehabilitation may have to be extended beyond six months up to a maximum of two years for any one admission. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the appointment, by the Minister, of a Review Committee headed by a medical doctor for each DRC to review the progress of treatment and rehabilitation of each drug addict or abuser. In exceptional cases the Committee can direct releases earlier than six months. It has also powers to extend the period of detention after six months and up to two years. The functions and the manner of working of a Review Committee are spelt out in clause 9. While under detention, drug addicts and abusers can be transferred from one DRC to another to undergo the treatment and rehabilitation programme in stages. The authority to transfer is also provided for under this clause. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 seeks to provide for the making of regulations relating to the management, maintenance and inspection of the DRCs; the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> control, discipline and occupation of inmates of DRCs, and the supervision and aftercare of those who have been discharged from DRCs or who have been convicted for an offence of consuming drugs. Compulsory supervision and aftercare will be extended to those who are convicted in court for consuming drugs and have been sent to the prison or have been fined. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the tabling of the Bill for First Reading, a further study of the Bill was made with a view to providing safeguards for any possible abuse or errors by enforcement and other officers in the taking and handling of urine samples and in their analysis. As a result, further amendments have been proposed to build in these safeguards. These amendments are contained in the Notice of Amendments which I shall move at the Committee Stage of the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to give a brief explanation on the amendments now. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The further amendment to clause 6 of the Bill will enable any person whose urine specimen is found to contain a controlled drug and who is dissatisfied with the result the right to apply for a second test of the specimen which will be stored for the purpose. This is to give the person a recourse if there is a mix-up of his urine specimen in the course of its taking, transportation and testing. Detailed procedures for the taking, collection, delivery and storage of urine specimens from suspected drug addicts will be promulgated in the form of regulations after the Bill has been passed. It also provides for the immediate release of such a person if the second test of his urine specimen is found to be negative. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further amendment to clause 9 seeks to provide yet another safeguard against wrongful detention of a person in an approved institution for treatment and rehabilitation. An aggrieved person may lodge a complaint to a Magistrate that he is improperly detained by mason of misconduct or breach of duty on the part of any officer in the discharge of his functions under the Act \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> or the regulations made thereunder. The Magistrate acting on such a complaint may himself inquire or direct a Police Officer to inquire into the complaint. On the basis of the inquiry, the Magistrate may order that the aggrieved person be discharged from the approved institution if he is satisfied that the person should not be detained. The Magistrate's decision shall be final. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>4.25 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in moving the Second Reading of the Misuse of Drugs Bill on 16th February, 1973, the Hon. Minister for Health and Home Affairs said, amongst other things, and I quote: [Hansard, Vol. 32, cols. 415-6] \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Though we may not have drug-trafficking and drug addiction to the same degree as, for instance, in the United States, we have here some quite big-time traffickers and their pedlars moving around the Republic selling their evil goods and corrupting the lives of all those who succumb to them.' \n  <br> \n  <br>Hence, Sir, heavy penalties were in-corporated in the Second Schedule to the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on 20th November, 1975, the Hon. Minister, in moving the Second Reading of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill, admitted that: [Hansard Vol. 34, col. 1381] \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... existing penalties under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1973, have not been a sufficient deterrence to traffickers.' \n  <br> \n  <br>Sir, the death penalty was then introduced. It is now barely two years and the Minister has brought in another amendment Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving the Second Reading of this Bill, the Minister gave a horrifying account of the problem of drug addiction that exists in our society today. In other words, the death penalty has not been a sufficient deterrence to drug traffickers and pushers. To thus enable the House to understand better why this is the case, could the Hon. Minister enumerate the number of drug traffickers who have been given the death penalty? He has pointed out that only a few have been given the death sentence. I wonder how \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> many executions have been carried out. If not, what are the reasons? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dealing with the problem of tracking down the traffickers, the Minister mentioned: [Hansard Vol. 34, col. 1381] \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our Central Narcotics Bureau has intelligence information that much of the heroin brought into Singapore has been manufactured in illicit laboratories clandestinely established in a neighbouring country.' \n  <br> \n  <br>Sir, in this case, may I ask what steps or measures have been taken to obtain the necessary cooperation of the neighbouring country concerned, and whether any information relating to this has been passed on to the neighbouring country for action to be taken? In other words, what has been achieved so far in this respect. Surely the existence of such illegal manufacture of heroin is detrimental both to Singapore and the neighbouring country concerned. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note the Minister's statement on the two-prong attack against drug traffickers and addicts to counter this menace. Whilst I support the spirit and intention of this Bill, I would like to seek the Minister's assurance that the Central Narcotics Bureau will be relentless in its efforts to track down the traffickers. I would also like to know whether there have been bilateral or multilateral arrangements in tracking down these drug traffickers, and what are the results, bearing in mind the spirit of ASEAN. I am sure that this is also one of the major problems facing these countries. May I add that we should not just be satisfied with our catch of ikan bilis and let the big fish slip away. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the Bill deals more with the rehabilitation of drug addicts, at the same time it gives wide powers to the law enforcement officers. It is, therefore, more than clear that drug addiction has reached a critical stage in Singapore. I congratulate the Hon. Minister for introducing this amendment Bill to tackle the menace, and I believe that every citizen has an important role to play in helping to combat this menace. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I conclude, I wish to deal with the other details in the Bill. First is this question of cold turkey treatment. The House would appreciate if the Minister could \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> enlighten Members as to the number of cases of such treatment, and what measure of success has been achieved. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the question of powers of arrest. These powers have now been extended to members of the Vigilante Corps and the Special Constabulary. In introducing further amendments to the amendment Bill, the Minister pointed out that the fear of abuse of powers of arrest by law enforcement officers has been taken into account, and that this fear need not arise. I am glad that he has introduced this amendment. But surely in the act of arresting persons, there is the question of the suspect or the drug addict being handcuffed. Would the Minister consider this point sympathetically - if our intention is to rehabilitate drug addicts, then all the more should care and caution be exercised in the act of arrest. In other words, do we really need to handcuff the suspects? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, would the Hon. Minister indicate to this House the number of drug addicts we have got today, quite apart from his answer in the early pan of the afternoon, and how many of them are hardcore addicts? I appreciate the point that the Minister's department has got a very difficult job to play in combating the drug menace on two fronts, the supply and the demand. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of rehabilitating the drug addicts, I wonder whether the personnel concerned are sufficiently trained in drug rehabilitation. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill has my support. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems to me that the introduction of this Bill is a sad commentary on our efforts to educate our young people on the dangers of drug abuse. Whilst I sympathise very much with the enforcement agencies, we should realise that very substantial powers are being conferred by this Bill on the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the urine test which is required of a suspect can be taken by any officer of the Bureau, any immigration officer or any police officer not below the rank of sergeant. Sir, \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> there may be instances where a group of youngsters are apprehended and their urine requested or demanded by the officer in question. What, Sir, if there should be a mix-up in the urine specimens and the wrong person is put under detention? As this is a matter of actual implementation, I am just wondering whether the Minister has considered the safeguards and procedures to prevent any such mix-ups from occurring, otherwise the poor suspect would simply be detained for six months, and if he does not have the money to pay for a lawyer he will not have recourse to a Magistrate. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may reply to the Member for Whampoa first. He has mentioned about the wide powers of arrest, the taking of a urine test by a Police officer not below the rank of sergeant, and the possibility of a mix-up, and what would happen if there had been a genuine case of mix-up. Sir, I have dealt with this point generally in my speech. We have studied this matter very carefully and, as a result, we are putting in safeguards to ensure that, first of all, there will not be any mix-up. But should there ever be a mix-up, there is a remedy, a recourse to a Magistrate for the aggrieved person. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the fact that we have provided that the officer taking the urine for a test should not be any officer but an officer not below the rank of sergeant indicates that we are aware of the possibility of an abuse or a mix-up. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in the amendments to the Bill, which are being proposed, we are providing for the possibility of an application for a second urine test. In other words, if there has been an error or a mix-up in the first urine test, then a second urine test will be done to prove it one way or the other. As I have said in my speech, what we are proposing to do, as soon as the Bill is passed, is to promulgate detailed regulations to enable such a procedure to be implemented. In other words, instead of taking one urine specimen, we are proposing to take two urine specimens. The first urine specimen will be \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> sent for analysis by the Department of Scientific Services, while the second specimen will be stored under lock and key. If there is claim of a mix-up in the first specimen, then we can fall back on the second specimen. In that way, we can ensure that any possibility of a mix-up is reduced to the minimum. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also building in the safeguard against a mix-up or abuse of power on the part of enforcement officers. The aggrieved person can go to a Magistrate and swear in a complaint, whereupon the Magistrate shall inquire into the allegations. However, Sir, this is not a court of law where the aggrieved person may need lawyers to represent him. It is just an inquiry. So my reply to the Member for Whampoa is that he does not need a lawyer for the inquiry. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Punggol, his first point is that I had found it necessary to move amendments to the Bill in 1975 to introduce the death penalty for trafficking more than a stated amount of heroin or morphine. He asked whether this has got any deterrent effect. Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot give the exact number, but round about eight or nine persons have already been sentenced to death to-date. As you know, Mr Speaker, Sir, in accordance with our judicial system, the trial takes place in the High Court, and if the person who is found guilty of this offence is sentenced to death, there is a recourse for appeal. From the High Court the case goes to the Court of Criminal Appeal. That takes some time. From the Court of Criminal Appeal, if it is a case involving the death penalty, the appeal will go to the Privy Council, which is in London, and that also takes time. So the period between the actual death sentence and the appeal being disposed of in the Privy Council may be from 18 months to two years. As the House knows, since this death penalty was introduced in 1975, only one case for appeal went to the Privy Council and the Privy Council had turned it down. And even if the Privy Council should turn down an appeal, there is yet another avenue - the aggrieved person can appeal to the President. That is the reason why to-date there has not been any execution. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other cases still awaiting trial. They number about more than 10 to 15 persons and their cases involve the death penalty. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although it is too early to say whether it has a deterrent effect, we can safely say that without the death penalty drug trafficking would have been more rife. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to close cooperation between Singapore and its neighbouring countries in connection with the drug trafficking menace, I can say that the enforcement agency in Singapore is in close cooperation with the enforcement agencies in our neighbouring countries. In fact, some joint operations have been conducted and there has been some success in the detection and arrest of some quite big-time traffickers. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to ASEAN, sometime last year we had a conference of drug enforcement officers from ASEAN countries. I think it was held in Hyatt Hotel here in Singapore. So there is close cooperation and exchange of intelligence between the enforcement agencies in Singapore and the neighbouring countries, particularly between ASEAN countries. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about the number of cases under \"cold turkey\" treatment. May I just explain what \"cold turkey\" treatment is? Everybody who is a drug abuser or addict would have to undergo cold turkey. Cold turkey simply means that the drug abuser or addict is put in a room. He is not given any drugs, and he begins to suffer from withdrawal symptoms. That is all. There is no medicine. There is no treatment. He is just denied drugs. This is a very good way to try to wean a person from drug addiction. Of course, the withdrawal symptoms will depend on the particular individual, and how hardened he has been on drugs. If he is deep on drugs, then he will suffer acute withdrawal symptoms. If he is just an experimenter or has just started taking drugs, then the withdrawal symptoms will be quite mild. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Punggol has brought up the question of suspects being handcuffed. Well, Mr Speaker, Sir, \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> there is no alternative. When an officer makes an arrest, he has to handcuff the suspect, who will otherwise run away. There have been cases where Customs officers, who had no handcuffs had been given the slip by their suspects who scooted off. In fact, some of the suspects were not only drug addicts but pushers as well. So these pushers had escaped arrest. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the number of drug addicts in Singapore, I have stated that we estimate it to be around 13,000 of which we have arrested 6,000. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is: what is the percentage of hardcore addicts? Sir, from our statistics and from our experience of those 6,000 who have been arrested and have undergone \"cold turkey\", I am glad to say that most of them are not hardcore addicts. In other words, they had only mild withdrawal symptoms. Only a small percentage are hardcore addicts. Many of them have just started on drugs. This means, Sir, that it is incumbent upon us to go all out at this moment to prevent others from getting hooked on drugs, and to prevent known addicts becoming hardcores. If we move now and move effectively, I believe that we have a chance in controlling the problem. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the reason why, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have come to this House to seek all the powers necessary for these effective measures that we are going to implement. And I can assure this House, the Member for Punggol in particular, that we are very conscious of the fact that there could be abuse of power or a mistake made at the lower level of enforcement officers, and that is the very reason why we have taken the trouble to have these built-in safeguards. If ever there is such an abuse there is recourse, a remedy, and the persons responsible for the abuse will be brought to book. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to seek a number of clarifications from the Minister on the answers he gave just now. Whilst I am in support of the Bill and want to ensure that drug addiction does not become an almost \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> uncontrollable menace in Singapore,( believe that the powers given under this Act are so tremendous that possible abuse is very clearly seen. From the answers the Minister gave just now, he failed to satisfy me in regard to the second urine specimen. As I understand it, a specimen of urine is taken within such time and in such manner as may be prescribed and a second test of the same specimen is made if there is an application by the person aggrieved. From what the Minister said just now, two urine specimens are taken. Are they taken in two separate containers? Are they taken in the same place for that matter? Because if there was a mix-up before this amendment and if now the specimens are taken in the same place and two containers are used at the same time, the possibility of a mix-up will surely still exist. I have had a number of cases of my constituents approaching me in regard to this mix-up, and invariably their applications were turned down when I wrote to the Minister. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to that, there is this business of detaining a person, who is aggrieved, just by a urine specimen test or an observation by the Director, CNB, or his officers. Most certainly, this can lead to quite a lot of abuse. No lawyer is required at the inquiry as the Minister has stated, and that means the person cannot defend himself. He is accused of something that he has done which would mean his detention; in other words, imprisonment and then, of course, \"cold turkey\" and all the rigmarole. I know we do not want our Singaporeans, especially our young Singaporeans, to be involved in drug-taking. But do we want them to be unfairly treated? Can we not give them some opportunity of defending themselves in court after the urine specimens are taken? And when we talk about 13,000 people, the number itself will mean greater abuses. If we have just a few, the chances of abuse are limited. Here we must consider not only the drug-takers, most of them young, but also the trauma that their parents will undergo. I would like some clarification on these points, Sir. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like a clarification on the second urine test. It is not unknown that even in medical laboratories and hospitals where the staff are specially trained to conduct tests that there are cases of mix-up. Here we have cases of people who are not specialised to take such samples, and I think we would appreciate the Minister's assurance that very detailed methods of taking test samples would be laid down. Of course, it is not possible to have a foolproof system but I think a detailed system of taking test samples which would minimise the incidence of mix-up would be appreciated. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, in the proposed amendment where a complaint on oath of wrongful detention can be brought before a magistrate, the Minister's remarks seem to imply that the complaint must be made by the person detained. My reading of the amendment does not indicate so, and I would appreciate if the Minister could clarify whether the parents or relatives of the detained person could make such a complaint. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, it is also proposed that evidence taken at such hearings before the magistrate are not admissible in a civil or criminal proceeding if improper conduct has been proved. May I know what is the purpose of affording the officers such protection? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just clarify the points raised by the Member for Kallang? I shall also reply to the Member for Potong Pasir as regards the second urine test. The Member says that because we realise that there is a possibility of a mix-up, that is why we are taking two urine specimens. The two specimens will be taken at the same time. We have already worked out the full procedure but it cannot be incorporated in this Bill. It will be incorporated in regulations which will be promulgated after the Bill has been passed. I will give Members an idea of what we are proposing to do. When a urine specimen of a suspect is going to be taken, he will be given two containers. He himself will put his urine in the two containers. The two containers will be sealed by him and they will be put into \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> two boxes which will be locked. The suspect will put one urine sample in a plastic bottle in one box and the other sample in another box. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> The boxes are not marked! \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, maybe in Potong Pasir the ballot boxes are not marked! But the boxes for the urine samples will be marked. One box will be marked \"For Storage\". The other will be marked \"To be delivered to the Department of Scientific Services.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to explain to the Member for Kallang, these tests are not done by medical officers. They are done by scientists. We have scientists in the Department of Scientific Services to do these tests. The Department is the proper authority for doing these tests. Members can be assured that these tests are carried out properly and they can depend on the tests to be accurate. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think there is a \"mix-up\" on the part of the Member for Potong Pasir about the recourse to a Magistrate if a person is aggrieved vis-a-vis that there has been some abuse of power or there have been some mix-up. The person can swear a complaint either by himself or through his relatives and the Magistrate, when faced with a sworn complaint, will have to conduct an inquiry. If the aggrieved person wants to have any number of lawyers to act on his behalf, he can do so. But as I said, it is not necessary because the inquiry will be conducted by the Magistrate himself who is an independent person. He is a member of the Judiciary and he will see that the truth of the matter will be arrived at through fair means. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question that proceedings of such an inquiry should not be used as evidence in any court of law, that is the normal practice with regard to any court of law, not necessarily this inquiry presided by a Magistrate. Otherwise people will not want to give evidence freely if, as a result of what he or she says in evidence, there can be a suit against him or her. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have answered the questions. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just like to seek clarification in respect of the Minister's reply in regard to the appeals board. I would like to know what is the interval between filing an appeal and for the board to meet? If the board takes six months to convene, then the aggrieved person would have already been in detention for six months. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the complaint will be speedily dealt with. It is not a board. It is just a Magistrate who will decide what course of action to take when he receives a complaint, and it can be dealt with quite speedily. As regards time, it may take two weeks, three weeks or a month. It should not be more than that. Of course, it depends on the particular case in question. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Baptist:</b> Sir, just another point of clarification. Why can we not charge the drug addicts in court? Why do we detain them without giving them any opportunity to defend themselves? Is it because it is very difficult to make out a case against them that we take this sort of attitude? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the reason why we adopted this practice is, if we allow the drug addicts to go free, there is a possibility that they may go deeper into drug addiction and infect others. As you know, any person being charged for any offence, can be bailed out. As a result he is free. And he can ask for an adjournment. In the meantime he can infect other people. On the other hand, as far as this procedure is concerned, a person is detained for rehabilitation on the basis of a urine test. I cannot see any other possibility of a wrongful detention unless there has been an abuse on the part of the enforcement officer or there has been a mix-up in the handling of the urine specimens. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we can always write into the Act to refuse him bail. Anyway, can he not be given a chance to defend himself? Maybe something went wrong and he was put in detention through no fault of his own. He could have been lured into taking that drug. It could have been put into his drink. So give him a chance to defend himself, and we could refuse him bail, as I said earlier. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> To refuse him bail is the same thing.

However, it does not constitute a change in the basic principles of immigration control. This point needs to be emphasised in order to allay the apprehension in some quarters about the significance and effect of an Exit Control Scheme in Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present immigration law in Singapore had its origin in the Immigration Ordinance of 1952. This was amended by the Immigration (Amendment) Ordinance, 1959, with effect from 1st May 1959 to take account of the creation of the status of a citizen of Singapore under the Singapore Citizenship Ordinance, 1957. Thereafter the substance of immigration law has remained substantially unchanged although there have been some modifications of the form of the law to reflect the various constitutional changes. The only major change during this period was the introduction of immigration control at the Causeway with effect from 1st July 1967. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the years, the Immigration Department has regulated the entry into and stay in Singapore of visitors through the issue of various types of temporary passes, such as Social Visit Pass, Student's Pass or \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Employment Pass. It is an offence for a visitor to remain in Singapore after the expiry of his pass and he is liable - on conviction to imprisonment for a term of up to six months or to a fine of up to $2,000 or to both such imprisonment and fine. To ensure that foreigners will submit to examination by Immigration Officers on arrival in Singapore, they are only allowed to enter Singapore at entry points such as immigration anchorages, immigration control posts, authorised airports, or authorised landing places which are designated under the provisions of the Immigration Act. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major defect in the present system is that although the Immigration Department has the power to restrict the stay of foreigners in Singapore, the mechanism is not there for it to ensure that they leave Singapore on or before the expiry of their temporary passes. There is no scheme to require all foreign visitors to submit to immigration check when leaving Singapore. There are also no specially designated exit points through which they are required to leave Singapore. As a result, foreigners can walk out from Singapore undetected even though they may have long overstayed the validity of their passes. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special survey conducted by the Immigration Department at various checkpoints revealed that during a two-day period in October 1976, a total of 2,447 visitors had overstayed in Singapore for periods ranging from a few days to over a year. These survey figures indicate only those who after having overstayed here subsequently, for some reasons, found it necessary to leave Singapore. The figures do not, however, disclose the number of visitors who have been overstaying here for very long periods and have no intention of leaving Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the Immigration Department takes action to track down those who overstay when information is received about their presence in Singapore. For the who4e of 1976, only 2,695 persons who overstayed were arrested by Immigration \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Officers in this way. This compared unfavourably with the figures of those who overstayed as disclosed during the two-day survey conducted in October 1976. Although quite a number of foreigners have overstayed in Singapore unintentionally, there are many others who have deliberately overstayed for one reason or another. If this is left unchecked, there is a danger that the number of overstayers may increase to critical proportions with all its attendant security and social implications. There is, therefore, an urgent need to institute measures to ward off this danger. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment Bill before the House will empower the Immigration Department to require foreign visitors to leave Singapore only through designated anchorages, airports or points or places of departure. It will also be empowered to require such persons to hand in Embarkation Forms at the time they leave Singapore. By matching, through the use of computer, the information contained in these Embarkation Forms with the arrival information of visitors obtained from the Disembarkation Forms submitted by them on arrival in Singapore, the Department will be able to identify the visitors who have overstayed. Follow-up action will then be taken against them. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although overstaying is an offence, some allowance will be made for tourists and other categories of visitors who may have unwittingly overstayed in Singapore for a few days. For such cases, the authorised Immigration Officers will have the discretion to either issue a warning or compound the offence for a sum of up to $100 (under clause 21 of the amendment Bill). \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no intention at this stage to apply the Exit Control Scheme to Singapore citizens. However, when Exit Control is implemented, the Immigration Department will be empowered to check those liable for national service leaving the country. It is an offence under the Enlistment Act for persons liable for national service to leave Singapore without an exit permit from the Central Manpower Base. However, due to the absence of departure checking at the moment, such people could leave Singapore \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> undetected temporarily or permanently. When Exit Control is implemented, the Immigration Department will have the manpower to provide departure checking for foreign visitors as well as Singapore citizens liable for national service. It is proposed in clause 17 of the Bill to confer upon an immigration officer the power to prevent those liable for national service from leaving Singapore if he does not have an exit permit. This will assist in the cutting down of the number of deserters and other cases of absence without leave. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Immigration Department will incur a one-time capital expenditure of $824,000 in implementing the Exit Control Scheme. The annually recurrent expenditure on manpower and other operating expenditure may amount to $2,000,000 and $850,000 respectively. But this expenditure is necessary to prevent the accumulation of foreigners who overstay, including undesirable elements, that can be a factor to affect the security and social stability of Singapore. The new Woodlands Checkpoint is ready and the Exit Control Scheme can be implemented as soon as the legislation is passed and necessary regulations enacted. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Chua Sian Chin]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>SINGAPORE SPORTS COUNCIL</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Dr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Sports Council (Amendment) Bill, 1977, seeks to repeal and re-enact section 16 of the Act which deals with pension benefits for employees of the Council. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Singapore Sports Council was established in October 1973, pensionable Government officers who were with the National Sports Promotion Board and the National Stadium Corporation were given the option to transfer their service to the Singapore Sports Council.

This Bill has provisions to safeguard any pension, gratuity, provident fund or other superannuation benefit for which such officers were eligible before their transfer to the service of the Council. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, the Singapore Sports Council is also empowered to establish, with the approval of the Minister, schemes for the payment of pensions, gratuities, provident fund or other superannuation benefits to such employees of the Council as it may determine.
