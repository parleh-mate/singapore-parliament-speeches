Of  the   jurisdictions\r\n\r\nthroughout the world which have inherited  English\r\n\r\nLaw,  Singapore must be one of the last to  follow\r\n\r\nthis  course  of  certifying or  guaranteeing  the\r\n\r\nownership of land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Government succeeded in obtaining\r\n\r\nthe  services  of Mr John Baalman, Barrister-at-Law and Senior\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExaminer of Titles to the Registry of Titles, New\r\n\r\nSouth  Wales.  Mr Baalman is an  expert  on  the\r\n\r\nTorrens  System  of land registration.  The  Bill\r\n\r\nbefore this Assembly is his work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantages of the system of Registration of\r\n\r\nTitle over the present system of conveyancing  by\r\n\r\ndeeds are now almost universally recognised.  As\r\n\r\nlong  ago as 1891, the Judicial Committee of  the\r\n\r\nPrivy  Council  stated that  the  object  of  the\r\n\r\nTorrens  System is \"to save persons dealing  with\r\n\r\nregistered  land from the trouble and expense  of\r\n\r\ngoing behind the Register in order to investigate\r\n\r\nthe  history  of  their  author's  title  and  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy themselves of its validity. That  end  is\r\n\r\naccomplished   by  providing  that   anyone   who\r\n\r\npurchases  bona  fide  and  for  value  from  the\r\n\r\nregistered  proprietor and  enters  his  Deed  of\r\n\r\nTransfer  or  Mortgage  on  the  Register   shall\r\n\r\nthereby    acquire    an    indefeasible    right\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding  the infirmity  of  his  author's\r\n\r\ntitle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, Sir, a leaflet published by Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's  Land  Registry in the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nexplained  that the Registration of Title  \"gives\r\n\r\nfinality\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Register will afford conclusive proof of\r\n\r\nthe ownership of land, by an instrument called  a\r\n\r\nCertificate of Title. The difference between  the\r\n\r\nTitle Register and the present Deeds Register  is\r\n\r\nthe  difference  between  the  positive  and  the\r\n\r\nnegative. The Registration of Deeds Ordinance, in\r\n\r\neffect, says, \"If you do not register your  deed,\r\n\r\nit  will  be bad.\" The Land Titles Bill says,  in\r\n\r\neffect, \"If you do register your deed, it will be\r\n\r\ngood.\" Between the economic consequences of these\r\n\r\ntwo effects, there is a wide gulf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantages to Government and to statutory\r\n\r\nbodies  of having readily accessible evidence  of\r\n\r\nthe  ownership of land are obvious, but the major\r\n\r\nbenefit  will  be  enjoyed  directly  by  private\r\n\r\nowners  and purchasers. The public at large  will\r\n\r\nalso derive an indirect benefit; because when any\r\n\r\nnecessary activity in the life of a community  is\r\n\r\nperformed  at less expense and in less time  than\r\n\r\nit has hitherto taken, a change must react to the\r\n\r\nadvantage   of  the  overall  economy   of   that\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken, incidentally to\r\n\r\nthe improvement in the system of registration,  to\r\n\r\nmodernise  certain aspects of the Law of  Property\r\n\r\ngenerally,  as,  for instance,  that  relating  to\r\n\r\nmortgages. I do not propose to go into the details\r\n\r\nof  the Bill as these are dealt with at length  in\r\n\r\nthe Objects and Reasons attached to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not, of course, possible, Sir, to\r\n\r\nintroduce  a new system like this overnight.  The\r\n\r\nintention  is that the present Register  of  Deeds\r\n\r\nand  the  new Register of Title shall continue  to\r\n\r\nexist  side by side until the former is ultimately\r\n\r\nabsorbed  in  the  latter.  The  function  of  the\r\n\r\nRegister of Deeds will be to feed and gradually to\r\n\r\ntransfer its substance into the new Register until\r\n\r\nthe old one can be safely laid to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have said enough, Sir, to convince\r\n\r\nhon. Members that this long overdue measure, which\r\n\r\nwill  bring  great  benefits  to  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  should not suffer any  further  delay,\r\n\r\nbut should be proceeded with at once and it is  my\r\n\r\nintention,  Sir,  immediately  after  the   Second\r\n\r\nReading  to commit the Bill to a Select Committee.\r\n\r\nI beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nBill before us, beyond question, is a complex one.\r\n\r\nEven  if it is not controversial in principle,  it\r\n\r\nis  certainly so in regard to several details  and\r\n\r\nin the interpretation of many of its clauses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a Bill which, in particular, needs the\r\n\r\nskill  and  experience of conveyancing lawyers  to\r\n\r\nexamine  and,  if need be, amend. It is  therefore\r\n\r\nquite  clear that this Bill, in order to become  a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory and more or less watertight piece  of\r\n\r\nlegislation,  needs  to  be  sent  to   a   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee of this House.

It is a temporary  measure,\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Government intends to replace  at  the\r\n\r\nearliest  possible date by comprehensive permanent\r\n\r\nlegislation designed to freeze the values  of  all\r\n\r\nimmovable property. Government has already secured\r\n\r\nthe  services of an expert from Australia who will\r\n\r\nadvise it on the introduction of such legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, it is a matter of urgency that\r\n\r\nthe  interim  legislation now under  consideration\r\n\r\nshould  be  enacted in order to make possible  the\r\n\r\npublication of the Master Plan for which there  is\r\n\r\nprovision  in the Singapore Improvement Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThis  Plan  has now been lying idle for two  years\r\n\r\nowing to the reluctance of the previous Government\r\n\r\nto enact legislation for the stabilisation of land\r\n\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Government will not tolerate any further\r\n\r\ndelay  and intends to see to it that the  Plan  is\r\n\r\npublished  at  the earliest possible  opportunity.\r\n\r\nThere  is a growing public demand that this  Plan,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  vitally affect forward  planning  not\r\n\r\nonly by Government but also by private developers,\r\n\r\nshould be brought into the open. The effect  of  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  Master  Plan,  covering  the  whole\r\n\r\nisland, will be to sterilise some areas for  green\r\n\r\nbelts,  to  allocate  some  for  agriculture   and\r\n\r\nchannel  development into certain districts.  This\r\n\r\nwill mean that some land will depreciate in value,\r\n\r\nwhile  other  land  will have  its  value  greatly\r\n\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Government comes to acquire land in\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  it will find that the  planning  for\r\n\r\nwhich  it is responsible has put prices up against\r\n\r\nitself. It is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto avoid this that prices must be pegged to a date\r\n\r\nbefore  values  start shifting from  one  area  to\r\n\r\nanother.  Compensation for land to be acquired  by\r\n\r\nGovernment must be related to a date prior to  the\r\n\r\npublication of the Master Plan. Clause  2  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  is designed to peg prices to the 22nd  April\r\n\r\n1955,  the  date  on  which the  Government  first\r\n\r\nannounced   its   intention  to   introduce   such\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 seek to give the Governor in\r\n\r\nCouncil  power  to acquire land for  comprehensive\r\n\r\ndevelopment as new or satellite towns. Doubts have\r\n\r\nbeen   expressed   in   the  past   whether   such\r\n\r\nacquisitions could properly be carried  out  under\r\n\r\nthe Land Acquisition Ordinance (Chapter 128).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two further matters to which I should\r\n\r\nlike  to  refer. It has been suggested to me  that\r\n\r\nlegislation of this nature is likely  to  hit  the\r\n\r\nsmall   man   hardest  of  all.  Well,   Sir,   my\r\n\r\ninformation is, and this has been confirmed  by  a\r\n\r\nleading estate agent in the local Press, that  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  landowners in Singapore are  wealthy\r\n\r\nmen.  However,  if  any cases are  brought  to  my\r\n\r\nnotice in which it can be shown that a smallholder\r\n\r\nis  likely to suffer hardship as a result of  this\r\n\r\nlegislation, I assure hon. Members that  his  case\r\n\r\nwill be given special consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this: the fear has been\r\n\r\nexpressed  that this Bill, if it becomes  law,  is\r\n\r\nlikely to prove a hindrance to private development\r\n\r\nand may even bring it to a standstill. It has been\r\n\r\nsaid  that no private developer will buy  land  in\r\n\r\nfuture  for  residential or industrial development\r\n\r\nbecause he cannot be certain that Government  will\r\n\r\nnot  take  this land away from him at  the  pegged\r\n\r\nprice.  The  answer  to that,  Sir,  is  that  the\r\n\r\npublication  of  the  Master Plan  should  quickly\r\n\r\ndispel  any uncertainty that may be felt  on  this\r\n\r\naccount  since  the Plan will indicate  what  land\r\n\r\nwill be required for public development. And, as I\r\n\r\nhave  said  before, Sir, the main object  of  this\r\n\r\nBill is to make possible the early publication  of\r\n\r\nthe Master Plan. Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  rise  to speak, not merely as a Member  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  whose  duty is to  oppose,  but  as  a\r\n\r\nresponsible  Member of this House anxious  to  see\r\n\r\nthat the development of Singapore under the Master\r\n\r\nPlan will be for the benefit of all the people and\r\n\r\nnot  at  the  expense  or to the  detriment  of  a\r\n\r\nsection of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post-war development of Singapore has\r\n\r\nproceeded  at a tremendous pace, and  none  of  us\r\n\r\nquestion the fact that such development without  a\r\n\r\nMaster Plan would lead to chaotic conditions which\r\n\r\nwould  be  impossible  to solve  within  the  next\r\n\r\nhundred years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We accept Sir George Pepler's idea that Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  have satellite towns all over the  island,\r\n\r\nconsisting  of  industrial and  residential  areas\r\n\r\nsurrounded  by green belts, so that  workers  will\r\n\r\nnot have to spend many hours each day going to and\r\n\r\nfrom  their place of employment. We do not  think,\r\n\r\nhowever,   that  Sir  George  Pepler   has,   paid\r\n\r\nsufficient attention to the financial aspect,  nor\r\n\r\nhas  he  shown that it is necessary to freeze  the\r\n\r\nprice  of  land to stabilise its value.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nsimilar   legislation  in   England   has   proved\r\n\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposed Bill is an improvement on the last\r\n\r\none  in  that it fixes land values for the purpose\r\n\r\nof  the Master Plan as on the 22nd of April, 1955,\r\n\r\nand  does  not take advantage of any drop  in  the\r\n\r\nprice of land after that date. Secondly, it  is  a\r\n\r\ntemporary  measure for five years only instead  of\r\n\r\nfor   an  indefinite  period.  The  previous  Bill\r\n\r\nbrought in by the last Government was committed to\r\n\r\na   Select   Committee  which  produced   a   very\r\n\r\ninteresting  report,  with three  members  of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee for the Bill and three against; but this\r\n\r\nBill has died a natural death with the election of\r\n\r\nthe new Government. Undoubtedly it was this report\r\n\r\nthat  has  produced the two improvements mentioned\r\n\r\nby  me. If so much improvement has occurred  after\r\n\r\none  report,  is  it not possible to  put  further\r\n\r\nthought  on this matter and avoid the freezing  of\r\n\r\nthe price of land?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask that Members of this House for\r\n\r\nthe time being forget election pledges and look at\r\n\r\nthis matter with an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopen mind. Everyone is agreed that speculation  in\r\n\r\nland  and fortunes made as a result of the  Master\r\n\r\nPlan  should be prevented at all costs.  With  the\r\n\r\nknowledge that this Government is prepared even to\r\n\r\nprevent  the  operation of the law of  supply  and\r\n\r\ndemand,  he would be a very daring man  who  would\r\n\r\ntoday indulge in operation of land values at  this\r\n\r\njuncture.  In any case, it would be very  easy  to\r\n\r\nprevent this, and all that is required is  a  Bill\r\n\r\nto provide that any increase in the value of land,\r\n\r\neither  as  a result of the Master Plan  or  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of the development by and at the expense of\r\n\r\nGovernment, shall not be added to the market value\r\n\r\nof  the land if acquired for public purposes. With\r\n\r\nthis  protection,  there will  no  longer  be  any\r\n\r\nnecessity for secrecy to be attached to the Master\r\n\r\nPlan.  By  implication, the public  already  knows\r\n\r\nthat  the  Master Plan has been in  operation  for\r\n\r\nsome  time,  as  plans for development  have  been\r\n\r\nturned  down  in  the  last year  or  two  without\r\n\r\nreasons  being given. I can see no reason why  the\r\n\r\nMaster Plan cannot be published forthwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That freezing of land values is impractical is\r\n\r\nclearly  shown  by  what has happened  in  England\r\n\r\nduring  the last ten years. In 1944, the Town  and\r\n\r\nCountry  Planning Act froze land  values  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of compulsory purchase as at the 31st  of\r\n\r\nMarch,  1939. This became more and more unrealistic\r\n\r\nand  was  finally  abandoned  when  the  Town  and\r\n\r\nCountry  Planning  Act of 1947 was  passed.  Under\r\n\r\nthis   Act,   a   most  complicated   system   was\r\n\r\nestablished  by which the State in  fact  acquired\r\n\r\nthe  development  value in all  land,  and  anyone\r\n\r\nwishing  to  develop his land would  have  to  pay\r\n\r\ntowards a fund the difference between its value in\r\n\r\nits  existing state and the developed value of his\r\n\r\nland. For example, when farmland is approved as  a\r\n\r\nsatellite town, then he has to pay the sum of \u00a3300\r\n\r\nmillion set aside to meet all claims of owners  of\r\n\r\nland,  which  has  to  be  restricted  in  use  or\r\n\r\ndevelopment. Much trouble and litigation arose out\r\n\r\nof this law, as a result\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  which the Town and Country Planning  Act  of\r\n\r\n1953   abolished  the  development   charges   and\r\n\r\npostponed  payment  out of the \u00a3300  million,  and\r\n\r\npublished  a  White Paper stating that  Government\r\n\r\nproposed  to bring fresh legislation  to  use  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  land fixed under the 1947  Act  as  the\r\n\r\nupper   limit   for  compensation   for   planning\r\n\r\nrestrictions as and when development  of  land  is\r\n\r\nprevented  or severely restricted. So far,  to  my\r\n\r\nknowledge, no new legislation has been  passed  in\r\n\r\nEngland. Therefore, the position in Great  Britain\r\n\r\nis  that  there is no restriction on the value  of\r\n\r\nland  today.  But there is a suggested restriction\r\n\r\non  the limit of compensation payable based on the\r\n\r\npotential use of the land in 1947.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall we not therefore profit by the mistake\r\n\r\nmade  in England and follow the latest legislation\r\n\r\ninstead of rushing into the same position she  was\r\n\r\nin  in  1944?  Even  with all the  goodwill  of  a\r\n\r\nSocialist Government in providing compensation for\r\n\r\nthose  whose land has to be necessarily restricted\r\n\r\nin  usage  under nation-wide planning, the  scheme\r\n\r\nwas  not  a  success. How can we succeed  when  no\r\n\r\nthought   has  been  given  under  this   proposed\r\n\r\nlegislation,  not  only to large  owners,  but  to\r\n\r\nowners of small plots of land?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One particular case comes to my mind. Two years\r\n\r\nago,  a fire destroyed about 50 huts built on  two\r\n\r\nacres  of  land  at the junction of  Aljunied  and\r\n\r\nMacPherson Roads. The owner of this piece of land,\r\n\r\nwho  inherited it from his father, was a poor  man\r\n\r\nand  his house, together with all the huts on this\r\n\r\nland, was wiped out. He was getting a ground  rent\r\n\r\nof  $250. That has completely gone, and he is  now\r\n\r\nliving  in  a little shed built with the  remnants\r\n\r\nsalvaged  from  the  fire  and  roofed  over  with\r\n\r\nflattened  kerosene tins. He has  tried  to  build\r\n\r\nhuts and even to lease this land for building low-cost  houses, but his application has always  been\r\n\r\nturned  down.  Perhaps the Chief Minister  at  his\r\n\r\nnext Meet-the-People meeting can help him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the case of others who have invested\r\n\r\ntheir  savings  in  some piece of  land  and  have\r\n\r\nmortgaged  it.  So far, investment  in  immoveable\r\n\r\nproperty has been the soundest investment when the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvalue  of money depreciates. When their  land  is\r\n\r\nsterilised under the Master Plan, they  will  not\r\n\r\nonly  have  to  pay  interest,  but  also  annual\r\n\r\nassessment  based on 5 per cent of  the  purchase\r\n\r\nprice.  Are  such people not entitled to  relief?\r\n\r\nThey  are now faced with having to part with land\r\n\r\nat  its frozen value, though they might have paid\r\n\r\na   much  higher  price  for  it,  plus  loss  of\r\n\r\ninterest,  and payment of assessment. It  is  not\r\n\r\ntrue  that only rich owners are affected by  this\r\n\r\nlegislation.   There  are   many   thousands   of\r\n\r\nsmallholders who are vitally affected and whom it\r\n\r\nis your duty, sitting on the Government Bench, as\r\n\r\nwell as ours to protect. I submit that as soon as\r\n\r\nland  is  prevented or severely  restricted  from\r\n\r\ndevelopment, it should be acquired by  Government\r\n\r\nand compensation paid therefore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the Chief Minister announced in the\r\n\r\nnewspapers - and  he  has  been  supported  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Local Government, Lands and  Housing\r\n\r\n(Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat) today - that he\r\n\r\nhas engaged an expert from Australia and that  he\r\n\r\nintends  to bring a total freeze Bill which  will\r\n\r\nfreeze  the  value  of  all immoveable  property,\r\n\r\nincluding  houses built thereon. Such  statements\r\n\r\nmade   before  full  investigation  as   to   the\r\n\r\nworkability  of  total freeze  in  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nbound  to  scare  away investment,  and  I  would\r\n\r\ncommend to him the wise words of the Secretary of\r\n\r\nState  for the Colonies: \"Do not spoil the future\r\n\r\nof  this great place by scaring away capital  and\r\n\r\ninvestment.\" Now that he has got his way  by  the\r\n\r\nconcession granted to him of 'shall' reading  for\r\n\r\n'may'  in  the  constitution, we hope  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  will settle down to work and clear  the\r\n\r\ncloud  of  uncertainty that  has  gathered  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of the series of crises during the  short\r\n\r\nlife  of  this Assembly. If he does  not  produce\r\n\r\nshocks and unholy marriages, we promise we  shall\r\n\r\nnot produce any.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say total freeze is unworkable because I have\r\n\r\nbeen  reliably  informed that  freezing  of  land\r\n\r\nvalues in Australia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D.

I would also\r\n\r\npoint  out  that since the liberation some  7,000\r\n\r\nfamilies in Singapore have put their savings into\r\n\r\nhome ownership, and about 6,000 of these families\r\n\r\nhave   mortgaged  their  homes  to  the  building\r\n\r\nsocieties, insurance companies or banks, and  are\r\n\r\npaying  instalments instead of rents so  that  in\r\n\r\nten  or  twelve years they will be  the  absolute\r\n\r\nowners of their homes, free from mortgage.  These\r\n\r\npeople are the salt of the earth, as they have  a\r\n\r\nstake in the country and will support a wise  and\r\n\r\nstable  government against the forces of anarchy.\r\n\r\nAre  these  people to be penalised by having  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of their holdings fixed at a certain price\r\n\r\nshould they be unfortunate to have to sell  their\r\n\r\nhomes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facts and figures have more than once been\r\n\r\npublished  showing that Government  will  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  cope with the houses required  for  the\r\n\r\nnormal  increase of the population by birth,  let\r\n\r\nalone that back-log required for those living  in\r\n\r\nthe  slums. I suggest that we should not  in  any\r\n\r\nway  discourage people who want to  help  in  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of housing for those who  can  afford\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, this is a measure restricting the\r\n\r\nright  of free trade, a cornerstone laid  by  Sir\r\n\r\nStamford  Raffles when he founded  Singapore,  on\r\n\r\nwhich depends the prosperity of this city, as  we\r\n\r\nknow  it today. This is a measure recently  tried\r\n\r\nand  discarded  in Great Britain. It  savours  of\r\n\r\nmeasures  shielded by curtains, Iron,  Bamboo  or\r\n\r\nPaper,  in that the development of the  State  is\r\n\r\nmade  at  the expense of a section of the public,\r\n\r\nconsisting not only of owners of large pieces  of\r\n\r\nland,  but small pieces of land as well. It seeks\r\n\r\nto  prevent owners of property from obtaining the\r\n\r\nbenefit of any development under the Master  Plan\r\n\r\nbut does not make any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovision  for  owners of land whose  property  is\r\n\r\nsterilised.  What  is  required  is  not  a  hasty\r\n\r\ntemporary measure, but a full comprehensive scheme\r\n\r\nso  that the planned development of Singapore  can\r\n\r\nbe  carried out for the benefit of all and not  at\r\n\r\nthe  expense  of  one section  of  the  community,\r\n\r\nwithout creating uncertainty and fear in the minds\r\n\r\nof   potential   owners  of  homes   and   persons\r\n\r\ninterested  in  building houses  for  people  with\r\n\r\nmodest  incomes,  or  in building  new  factories.\r\n\r\nUnless  their confidence in the future is assured,\r\n\r\nthe Master Plan will remain merely as a Plan to be\r\n\r\ncarried  out  by  Government  alone,  without  the\r\n\r\nco-operation of the people who are in a position to\r\n\r\nhelp in the development of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I give notice that I intend to move, after\r\n\r\nthe Second Reading, that this Bill be committed to\r\n\r\na  Select Committee with the object of producing a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Sir,  my  late father, for whom  I  had  the\r\n\r\nhighest regard at all times, used to tell me  that\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  there were two  things  which  were\r\n\r\ncertain to go up. One was a balloon, and the other\r\n\r\nwas the price of land. I would ask you to look  no\r\n\r\nfurther  than  my own home. In 1932 this  plot  of\r\n\r\nland,  on  which  I  rent a house,  was  sold  for\r\n\r\n$12,500. In 1939, without finding any gold  there,\r\n\r\nthat plot of land with the same house was sold for\r\n\r\n$37,500 - only  three  times. In  1954,  I  had  the\r\n\r\ntemerity  to  suggest to my landlady  that  I  was\r\n\r\ninterested in purchasing the house. I was told  it\r\n\r\nwould  cost  a quarter of a million dollars!  What\r\n\r\nhad  been  done  to  that land? Neither  gold  nor\r\n\r\nsilver nor anything else was found there! But what\r\n\r\nhad  happened,  Sir, was that our  population  had\r\n\r\nincreased, and all a landowner has to do  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry is to sit on his bottom, sit on his  title\r\n\r\ndeeds,  and  the price will go up! No  man  has  a\r\n\r\nright  to hold society and posterity up to  ransom\r\n\r\nto  satisfy his extraordinary lust and  greed  for\r\n\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the price of land in this\r\n\r\nterritory  is something that is quite unbelievable\r\n\r\nuntil you examine the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevidence.  I  would  be only  too  happy  if  the\r\n\r\ninvestors  were satisfied with a law, which  gave\r\n\r\nthem  a  five, or six per cent return; but,  Sir,\r\n\r\non  the  basis  of what we know has  occurred  in\r\n\r\nthis   territory,  landowners  expect  an  annual\r\n\r\nreturn  of approximately 100 per cent.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  modest return for these pathetic  gentlemen\r\n\r\nfor  whom  we weep today! In England, Sir,  there\r\n\r\nis  enough  land  to satisfy  the  needs  of  its\r\n\r\npopulation. In Singapore there is not,  and  what\r\n\r\nthere  is must be reasonably rationed; and in  so\r\n\r\nfar as this Government has any power, it will  be\r\n\r\nreasonably  rationed,  and  there  will   be   no\r\n\r\ncrocodile  tears for those who have  indulged  in\r\n\r\nsuch  fantastic exploitation of the  basic  needs\r\n\r\nof humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation in England is of a totally\r\n\r\ndifferent character from that which we  seek.  It\r\n\r\nis  true  that  we  ultimately  seek  a  complete\r\n\r\nproperty  freeze as of the 22nd of  April,  1955.\r\n\r\nFull  notice  of that has already been  given  in\r\n\r\nHis  Excellency's  speech on  that  date,  and  I\r\n\r\nmerely  repeat  it  by way of confirmation.  This\r\n\r\npresent   measure,  however,  is  a  modest   and\r\n\r\ntemporary  one that says, 'We will  take  nothing\r\n\r\nfrom  you that you have got today. What the price\r\n\r\nis  today, that you will receive; and if you have\r\n\r\nmade  any  improvements to your property  and  we\r\n\r\nshould require it for a public purpose, you  will\r\n\r\nreceive  the  full price. But we will  no  longer\r\n\r\naccept   the  position  that,  because   of   the\r\n\r\npressure   of   population  and  the   consequent\r\n\r\npressure  of  demand which is  far  greater  than\r\n\r\nsupply,  you  should be able to  hold  us  up  to\r\n\r\nransom  and  demand  fantastic  profits  year  by\r\n\r\nyear.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We read, I think it was in March last, of a\r\n\r\nvery  prescient  gentleman who bought  some  land\r\n\r\nnear  Paya Lebar for $100,000. That was in  1954,\r\n\r\nSir,  and in 1955 he made the Government pay  him\r\n\r\n$400,000 for the same piece of land! That is  the\r\n\r\ntype  of  gentleman for whom the Member for  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar  weeps, and asks us to join in mourning  as\r\n\r\nwe  kill  this body of speculators.  Let  us  get\r\n\r\nthis  clear: The red herring of the small man  is\r\n\r\nnothing  but  a  red  herring.

Those homes have been approved  by\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Improvement Trust and form part  of\r\n\r\nour  development schemes, and it comes  ill,  Sir,\r\n\r\nperhaps it was unintended, that this House  should\r\n\r\nbe  misled into thinking that this Bill could ever\r\n\r\ncover  any question of acquisition of those  newly\r\n\r\nbuilt  houses. This Bill is intended  to  make  it\r\n\r\npossible for Government in the name of the  people\r\n\r\nto  take such lands for roads, for public building\r\n\r\nas  may be necessary, in order to fulfil the needs\r\n\r\nof  the people, without having to pay through  its\r\n\r\nnose,  without  having to pay such fantastic  sums\r\n\r\nthat  Government, like the people of this country,\r\n\r\nwill be no longer able to utilise the land for its\r\n\r\nprimary purpose - the purpose of serving the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar asks us: but what\r\n\r\nabout  the  poor man who has to pay  his  mortgage\r\n\r\ninterest?  But  that  poor man,  Sir,  if  he  has\r\n\r\nutilised  his  land  for the appropriate  purpose,\r\n\r\nwill  be  earning enough income to  pay  for  that\r\n\r\ninterest. We are not depriving him of any means of\r\n\r\nearning his income. We are merely depriving him of\r\n\r\nthe  right to hold the people up to ransom. It  is\r\n\r\nsuggested that this is a restriction of the  right\r\n\r\nof  free trade. This is a restriction of the right\r\n\r\nto  highway robbery in which the people, for  whom\r\n\r\nyou weep, Sir, have been indulging for the last 50\r\n\r\nyears. I can but regret that the hon.

To continue:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is desirable to protect these people against\r\n\r\nundue  inflation of land values. We  are  doubtful\r\n\r\nwhether their interests are sufficiently protected\r\n\r\nby  the sub-section as drafted. Although there may\r\n\r\nbe  a balance of probability that land values will\r\n\r\ntend  to rise in Singapore so that the Board would\r\n\r\nget land for less than its market value, there  is\r\n\r\nat least a possibility that land values will fall.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no doubt that Singapore has experienced\r\n\r\nsince  the Liberation a prosperity that cannot  be\r\n\r\nexpected  to last forever. When this comes  to  an\r\n\r\nend, it may have an adverse effect on land values.\r\n\r\nIf so what would the Board do? Purchase at a price\r\n\r\nabove the market? Abandon or delay development? Or\r\n\r\nwould  it  persuade the Government  to  amend  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  so as to reduce the value at  which  it\r\n\r\ncompulsorily  acquires land? Almost certainly,  it\r\n\r\nwould  adopt the last of these courses. Owners  of\r\n\r\nproperty  are  entitled to proper  protection  and\r\n\r\nthis section appears to us to introduce a new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand    iniquitous   principle   whereby    partial\r\n\r\nconfiscation  is  cloaked by fixing  an  arbitrary\r\n\r\ndate of valuation for compensation which does  not\r\n\r\ntake  into consideration normal changes in  market\r\n\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are bound to be cases where injustice will\r\n\r\nresult from the adoption of 1st December, 1949,  as\r\n\r\nthe  date  for  fixing market values.  There  have\r\n\r\nalready,   to   our   personal   knowledge,   been\r\n\r\ntransactions since that date at prices  in  excess\r\n\r\nof those ruling on 1st December, 1949.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also draw attention to widespread\r\n\r\nstagnation  in  land dealing, and consequently  in\r\n\r\nprivate land development that must result from the\r\n\r\nattempt  in  the  Development Board  Ordinance  to\r\n\r\nfreeze  land values at the level they had  reached\r\n\r\nat  1st December, 1949. If land values are left  to\r\n\r\nbe  determined by the market, they may  go  up  or\r\n\r\nthey may go down: the one thing that is certain is\r\n\r\nthat they will not remain stationary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose in a free market land values would have\r\n\r\ngone  up;  what  is the effect of  the  Ordinance?\r\n\r\nPeople owning land that is acquired by the  Board\r\n\r\nhave  part  of their property expropriated.  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom   the  manifest  injustice  of  this  another\r\n\r\nconsequence  ensues: people who might have  bought\r\n\r\nland for private development, fear that if they do\r\n\r\nso  the Board may prefer to develop it, and in the\r\n\r\nprocess of acquiring it, inflict a loss on them of\r\n\r\nthe  difference between the market  value  at  the\r\n\r\ndate of acquisition and the value at 1st December,\r\n\r\n1949. In short, people who might benefit Singapore\r\n\r\nby  private development of land are deterred  from\r\n\r\ndoing  so.  We have already reached the conclusion\r\n\r\nthat  the  housing targets of the Board cannot  be\r\n\r\nfinanced unless private builders are permitted and\r\n\r\nare   given   every   possible  encouragement   to\r\n\r\nundertake a large share of the work. It  is  clear\r\n\r\nfrom  what we have said above that the attempt  to\r\n\r\nfreeze  land  values will tend  to  deter  private\r\n\r\nbuilders  from  taking part  in  the  project.  We\r\n\r\nconsider  that  the  protection  of  the   Board's\r\n\r\noperations  would  be achieved by  providing  that\r\n\r\nland  is  to be acquired by the Board at its  fair\r\n\r\nmarket  value  at  the date of  acquisition,  such\r\n\r\nvalue  not to include any appreciation,  which  is\r\n\r\nattributable only to the operations of the  Board.\r\n\r\nIn other words, landowners should receive the fair\r\n\r\nmarket   value   of  their  land   excluding   any\r\n\r\nextortionate increase arising from anticipation of\r\n\r\ndevelopment by the Board. It may be difficult  but\r\n\r\nit  should  be impossible to determine  such  fair\r\n\r\nmarket values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions as to the value at which land is\r\n\r\nacquired   would   result  in  the   Board   doing\r\n\r\npractically  all  the future developments  of  the\r\n\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make it impracticable for the citizens of a\r\n\r\nfree  country  to use their vision and  energy  in\r\n\r\ndeveloping  that  country, and to  assume  that  a\r\n\r\nmonopoly  of  these qualities is  possessed  by  a\r\n\r\nhandful  of  officials, is  not  only  unjust  but\r\n\r\nabsurd.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, this opinion has been\r\n\r\ndelivered by a body of learned persons whose names\r\n\r\nI  have  already  quoted, Sir. It  will  be  most\r\n\r\ninteresting to hear what the Chief Minister has to\r\n\r\nsay  about  the  opinion  expressed  by  Mr D. S.\r\n\r\nMarshall. My mind is quite open, and I would  like\r\n\r\nto hear it, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nhon.  Members here present no doubt are  aware  of\r\n\r\nconsiderable public feelings against the  proposed\r\n\r\nLand  Acquisition (Temporary Provisions) Bill  now\r\n\r\nbefore  this  House. I would state at the  outset,\r\n\r\nthat   my  Party  is  not  opposed  to  \"enforced\"\r\n\r\nacquisition  of  land  or property  by  Government\r\n\r\nstrictly  for public purpose, but will be  opposed\r\n\r\nto such acquisition by Government for \"commercial\"\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of enforced acquisition by\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  land for public  purpose,  a  Land\r\n\r\nAcquisition   Ordinance  already   has   been   in\r\n\r\nexistence  for many years. The proposed Bill,  now\r\n\r\nbefore this House, neither repeals nor amends  any\r\n\r\npart  of the Ordinance, and the provisions are  in\r\n\r\npart repugnant to the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, clause 3 of the proposed Bill\r\n\r\nenables  acquisition by Government for a new  town\r\n\r\nsite. This is not for a public purpose. It enables\r\n\r\nthe Government to acquire land for the purpose  of\r\n\r\nreselling it to private ownership in part or as  a\r\n\r\nwhole. Clause 3 further enables the Government  to\r\n\r\nobtain  what  is in fact a statutory opinion  over\r\n\r\nthe  land to be acquired, but does not require the\r\n\r\nGovernment to proceed with the acquisition nor  to\r\n\r\npay  for the land until the same is eventually and\r\n\r\nactually  acquired.  Under such  circumstances,  a\r\n\r\npiece of land may be rendered useless to the owner\r\n\r\nas long as such option continues. This, I suggest,\r\n\r\nis unjust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Bill, it is claimed, is necessary\r\n\r\nin   order  to  enable  the  Master  Plan  to   be\r\n\r\nimplemented, but I am of the opinion that this  is\r\n\r\nnot  the case. In the first place, the Bill is  in\r\n\r\nno  way  restricted in its scope to  dealing  only\r\n\r\nwith  those  cases in which the Master Plan  comes\r\n\r\ninto  question. In the second place, it should  be\r\n\r\nasked what the real\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblems are which should be considered so far  as\r\n\r\nthe  Master  Plan  is  concerned.  These  may   be\r\n\r\nsummarised under three headings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To defeat speculation,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To prevent the public from having to pay\r\n\r\nthe landowner compensation for any \"windfall\"\r\n\r\nwhich might accrue to him as a result of the\r\n\r\npublishing of the zoning provisions of the Master Plan, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To ensure that in dealing with points (1) and (2), no injustice is inflicted upon the landowner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point (1) is already provided for by the\r\n\r\nexisting  legislation and it does not require  the\r\n\r\npresent  Bill to meet it. Point (2) is one,  which\r\n\r\ncould  be  easily  dealt  with  more  fairly   and\r\n\r\nequitably  by a different form of legislation.  In\r\n\r\nthis  regard,  reference is made to  the  Minority\r\n\r\nReport  published  by the Select Committee,  which\r\n\r\nwas  appointed  to  consider the Land  Acquisition\r\n\r\n(Amendment No. 3) Bill, 1953. After reviewing  the\r\n\r\nwhole  problem,  three unofficial members  of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  made  alternative  suggestions,   which\r\n\r\nappear  to  be  fairer and more satisfactory  than\r\n\r\nthose,  proposed in the present Bill.  As  regards\r\n\r\npoint  (3),  it may be pointed out that,  if  land\r\n\r\nvalues  rise during the next five years  for  some\r\n\r\nreason  unconnected  with  the  Master  Plan,  the\r\n\r\nlandowner whose property is to be acquired is  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to receive the fair value for his property.\r\n\r\nIt  is therefore extremely probable that the  Bill\r\n\r\nwill  result in serious injustice, which could  be\r\n\r\navoided by some alternative form of legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if it is the intention of Government to\r\n\r\nfreeze  values  of  land which  comes  within  the\r\n\r\nMaster Plan, it would be fairer and more just that\r\n\r\nonly values of such land should be frozen and  not\r\n\r\nevery   inch  of  the  entire  island!   In   this\r\n\r\nconnection,  it should be possible to publish  the\r\n\r\nMaster Plan simultaneously with the implementation\r\n\r\nof  the  Ordinance.  It is difficult  to  see  any\r\n\r\njustification  in freezing values of  property  or\r\n\r\nproperties which are not required by Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the proposed Bill, certain points require\r\n\r\nexplanation and clarification. Under clause 2 (f),\r\n\r\n\"capital value\" of buildings and improvements  is,\r\n\r\nI  suggest, not capable of interpretation. Does it\r\n\r\nmean  cost  or  a number of years purchase?  There\r\n\r\nshould be a definition to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, under the same sub-clause of the same\r\n\r\nclause,  the phrase \"buildings bona fide  erected\"\r\n\r\nsounds  nonsensical. Perhaps the draftsman has  in\r\n\r\nmind some provisions similar to those contained in\r\n\r\nsection 25 (2) (a) of the existing Ordinance!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the true value of land is always bound\r\n\r\nto fluctuate according to the operation of the law\r\n\r\nof  supply  and demand, to the economic  condition\r\n\r\nfrom  time to time, and to the true value  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry's  currency. These natural processes  have\r\n\r\nnothing whatever to do with the provision  of  any\r\n\r\nMaster  Plan, which may be produced by Government.\r\n\r\nAny  attempt  to disregard them can  only  result,\r\n\r\nover  such  a  lengthy period of  five  years,  in\r\n\r\nproducing highly unrealistic, artificial  \"values\"\r\n\r\nfor the lands affected. In the long run, this will\r\n\r\nnot  be  in  the  public interest and  will  cause\r\n\r\nserious injustice. Furthermore, the effect of  the\r\n\r\nproposed Bill may seriously discourage investments\r\n\r\nin  land and landed properties. This, in fact,  is\r\n\r\nalready apparent in the recent lack of interest in\r\n\r\nreal estate investments after the announcement  of\r\n\r\nthe proposed legislation. Perhaps more careful and\r\n\r\nexhaustive  consideration may  be  given  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter as a whole or at least improvements to  the\r\n\r\nBill itself should be made before legislation  may\r\n\r\nbe adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill. This Bill, Sir, has a very  long\r\n\r\nhistory.  In  October  1953  my  hon.  Friend  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General  (Mr  E. J.  Davies)  introduced\r\n\r\ninto   the   then  Legislative  Council   a   Land\r\n\r\nAcquisition (Amendment No. 3) Bill, the object  of\r\n\r\nwhich was to stabilise land values and to effect a\r\n\r\nfew  minor  amendments to the original  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nand  to  enable  the Master Plan to be  published.\r\n\r\nBefore the Second Reading of this Bill took place,\r\n\r\nit  was referred to a Select Committee. For  about\r\n\r\nnine months\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  Committee  deliberated  on  this  Bill,  and\r\n\r\nfinally,  on  the  27th of July,  1954,  made  its\r\n\r\nReport. It was not unanimous as was expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My attempt in December last year to force the\r\n\r\nBill  through all its remaining stages during  the\r\n\r\nlife  of the then Legislative Council failed,  and\r\n\r\nthe  then Government felt that the Bill should  be\r\n\r\npassed  on  to  the  newly-elected  Government  of\r\n\r\nSingapore which would have by then a clear mandate\r\n\r\nfrom  the  people on the future of land policy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Soon after the election, Sir, the newly\r\n\r\nelected  Government made it quite  clear  that  it\r\n\r\nwould  seek  additional powers for the acquisition\r\n\r\nof  land  for public purposes, and powers for  the\r\n\r\nfreezing of values of immoveable property. It also\r\n\r\ndeclared  that  it was the firm intention  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to ensure that land was  used  in  the\r\n\r\nbest interests of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am indeed glad, Sir that the first step\r\n\r\ntowards  this  process  has  now  begun  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  now translated  its  policy  into\r\n\r\naction. It is my considered view, Sir, that it  is\r\n\r\nour  duty  to take urgent steps to make  provision\r\n\r\nfor the housing not only of the homeless of today,\r\n\r\nwho  live in extremely unhappy circumstances,  but\r\n\r\nof  the  expected  increase in population  in  the\r\n\r\ncoming  years. We will be doing a great disservice\r\n\r\nto   the  people  of  this  territory  if  we  are\r\n\r\ncomplacent of our duty in this direction. The land\r\n\r\nof the Colony is limited in amount, and on it must\r\n\r\nbe  found  suitable  space  for  such  major  land\r\n\r\nprojects    as   housing,   industry,   education,\r\n\r\nagriculture, recreation and communications,  etc.,\r\n\r\nfor  our rapidly growing population. There can  be\r\n\r\nno matter of more importance to the inhabitants of\r\n\r\nSingapore than the land upon which they live, work\r\n\r\nand  have their recreation, and the policy  should\r\n\r\nbe  so framed as to secure that each piece of land\r\n\r\nis  used in a manner which will best serve various\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vested interests are apt to object to this Bill,\r\n\r\nas  they have done in the past. They are  only  a\r\n\r\nhandful. Their objection is not unnatural as their\r\n\r\npersonal interests are involved, but I am sure,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,  that all those who believe in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nhave consideration for the thousands of their less\r\n\r\nfortunate  fellow citizens, who are  landless  and\r\n\r\nare compelled by circumstances to live piled up in\r\n\r\nhovels,  will  sacrifice their personal  interests\r\n\r\nfor  the  happiness of the community as  a  whole.\r\n\r\nAfter all, all lands belong to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Acquisition (Temporary Provisions)\r\n\r\nBill, which is now the subject of discussion, aims\r\n\r\nat  stabilising  land values in  the  Colony.  The\r\n\r\nmethod  adopted is identical with that adopted  in\r\n\r\nvery  many  other  countries in  implementing  any\r\n\r\nplanning  scheme of this kind that we  have  here,\r\n\r\nthat  is, fixing the value of land at a date prior\r\n\r\nto  the publication of that Master Plan. There may\r\n\r\nbe  an interregnum between the publication of  the\r\n\r\nMaster Plan and the time acquisition is necessary,\r\n\r\nduring  which land may change hands several  times\r\n\r\nat  a  rocketing  price, and the aim  here  is  to\r\n\r\nprevent  this  tendency. An upper price  limit  is\r\n\r\nnecessary in order to prevent exploitation at  the\r\n\r\nexpense  of the community on the land planned  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  accordance  with  the  needs  and\r\n\r\nrequirements  of the community. Sir, stabilisation\r\n\r\nof  land  values is a prerequisite  to  successful\r\n\r\ntown and country planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master Plan, Sir, is flexible and is subject\r\n\r\nto  revision every five years. The fact  that  the\r\n\r\nduration of the proposed legislation is also  five\r\n\r\nyears  should satisfy those objectors who  believe\r\n\r\nthat  the fixing of land values should not be  for\r\n\r\nan  unlimited period. The directions to the Courts\r\n\r\nin  determining the amount of compensation  to  be\r\n\r\nawarded  and  the considerations  to  be  accepted\r\n\r\nmust,  I  think,  assure the  landlords  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is not being unfair to their interests.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  the  terms of compensation  are  indeed\r\n\r\nliberal.  I am sure, Sir, that the landlords  will\r\n\r\nrealise  that it is essential that every piece  of\r\n\r\nland  should  be  put  to  the  best  use  in  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the community, and that it cannot  be\r\n\r\ntreated  as an ordinary marketable commodity.  The\r\n\r\nearlier  we give consent to this Bill, the  better\r\n\r\nit  is  for our country and the people. I do hope,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  although some people might  object  to\r\n\r\nthis Bill, they will live to realise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the implementation of this Master Plan  will\r\n\r\ngive  them  the joy and inspiration  of  seeing  a\r\n\r\nhappy and prosperous Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill under\r\n\r\nconsideration,   in   my   opinion,   is   not   a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory Bill because it does not provide  for\r\n\r\nwhat everyone agrees needs to be provided. What is\r\n\r\nneeded, as my hon. Friend here has said, is a Bill\r\n\r\nto  provide  that  any  increase  in  land  values\r\n\r\narising  from the Master Plan, or from development\r\n\r\nby  and at the expense of Government, shall not be\r\n\r\nadded to the market value of land if acquired  for\r\n\r\npublic purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a simple Bill of this sort were introduced,\r\n\r\nit   would  be  legislation  of  a  practical  and\r\n\r\nrealistic  kind, but the whole principle  of  this\r\n\r\nBill  is  entirely  different.  Under  this  Bill,\r\n\r\npersons owning land, whether they be rich or poor,\r\n\r\nare going to have burdened on them the cost of the\r\n\r\nfuture  development of land and the  rest  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  is going to benefit. What is more,  can\r\n\r\nthe  Minister offer any guarantee that  this  Bill\r\n\r\nwill  not  result in more land deals  beneath  the\r\n\r\ncounter  than above it, with the effect of causing\r\n\r\nmore contempt than respect for the law? If he can,\r\n\r\nI might be more willing to support him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, in his speech in this House last\r\n\r\nApril,  said  that land-freezing  legislation  was\r\n\r\nnecessary if the Government is to keep its  pledge\r\n\r\nof \"improving the standard of living of the poorer\r\n\r\nclasses  and providing them with adequate low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing\".  These  sentiments are well  understood,\r\n\r\nbut  what about the poor smallholders of land  and\r\n\r\nthe  effect  of this Bill upon them? How  can  you\r\n\r\ndraw  the line between the poor and the more well-to-do and give special consideration in some cases\r\n\r\nwithout creating invidious distinctions in others?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to various clauses of the Bill, I wish\r\n\r\nto make a few comments. Firstly, this is a Bill to\r\n\r\nstabilise the value of land. This surely is really\r\n\r\na  misnomer. You cannot, in point of fact, fix the\r\n\r\nvalue  of land. Land must always get more valuable\r\n\r\nor  less valuable according to circumstances.  You\r\n\r\ncan  only, if you insist, fix its price,  but  can\r\n\r\ncontrol of price any more than rent control stamp\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  the  tea  money  racket? Leaving  terminology\r\n\r\naside, we should like to know under clause  2  (a)\r\n\r\nwhether  Government will pay  the  22nd  of  April\r\n\r\nvalue of land even if the price has dropped lower,\r\n\r\nand  the  events of the past four months  have  in\r\n\r\nmany  cases produced this situation. If Government\r\n\r\ndoes this, paying more for the acquisition of land\r\n\r\nthan  the  current  value, public  money  will  be\r\n\r\nwasted.  To avoid such waste, are we then to  find\r\n\r\nthe Government rushing through an amending Bill to\r\n\r\namend the 22nd of April date -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Wait till then!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> - to a date more favourable to\r\n\r\nthem?  Such a situation breeds so much uncertainty\r\n\r\nthat  there  will be no dealings in land  whatever\r\n\r\nand  there will not merely be a freeze in land but\r\n\r\na  deep  freeze.  I hope that we can  expect  some\r\n\r\nexplanation from the Minister on this question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, under clause 2 (a), let me quote an\r\n\r\nexample  of  a person owning a piece of  land  who\r\n\r\ndies, say, in August 1956. The trustees pay estate\r\n\r\nduty on his property based on values prevailing in\r\n\r\nAugust 1956, at, say, $3 a square foot. Before the\r\n\r\ntrustees  can dispose of this property, Government\r\n\r\nacquires  it,  compensation  payable  under   this\r\n\r\nOrdinance  being based on $2 a square foot,  being\r\n\r\nthe  market value on the 22nd of April, 1955.  Will\r\n\r\nGovernment   refund   the  death   duty   on   the\r\n\r\ndifference, namely a dollar a square foot?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 (f) seems to be most unsatisfactorily\r\n\r\ndrafted.  What  is  meant by \"the  actual  capital\r\n\r\nvalue\"?  Is  this the actual cost at the  time  of\r\n\r\nbuilding,  without taking into  account  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat building costs can rise? And what is meant by\r\n\r\n\"bona  fide erected\"? All buildings are bona  fide\r\n\r\nerected in the sense that they are approved  first\r\n\r\nby  the  Singapore  Improvement  Trust,  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  or  the  Rural Board. But  if  Government\r\n\r\nmeans  that owners might make improvements in  the\r\n\r\nhope of getting better compensation at the time of\r\n\r\nacquisition, this, I submit, is nonsense, because,\r\n\r\nin  view  of the provision \"less an allowance  for\r\n\r\ndepreciation\", nobody is going to erect a $20,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouse  on land likely to be acquired if he  is  to\r\n\r\nget only, say, $18,000 for it a short while later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this same clause 2 (f), what happens to\r\n\r\nthe  owner of a low-lying piece of ground who bona\r\n\r\nfide has started earth-filling operations prior to\r\n\r\nthe 22nd of April 1955? Supposing $25,000 worth of\r\n\r\nfilling  has  been done before this date  and  the\r\n\r\nbalance  of  $10,000 afterwards. If the Government\r\n\r\nacquires  this property in October 1955,  will  he\r\n\r\nreceive compensation for the $25,000 spent  before\r\n\r\nthe 22nd of April?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to clause 3, we find that Government will\r\n\r\nbe  able to acquire any area of land it pleases by\r\n\r\ndesignating  such an area \"as a  site  for  a  new\r\n\r\ntown\". This gives the Government exceedingly  wide\r\n\r\npowers  and makes all ownership of land  insecure.\r\n\r\nAnd  governments have been known to  change  their\r\n\r\nminds  before  now. Are we to see large  areas  of\r\n\r\nland  acquired for new towns at the 22nd of  April\r\n\r\nprice,  plans later abandoned, and the  land  sold\r\n\r\nagain at a much enhanced price?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to another point, concerning the making-up of private roads. There are many owners - some\r\n\r\nquite  poor  owners - who are frontagers on  private\r\n\r\nroads  shortly  to be made up and  taken  over  as\r\n\r\npublic roads. These frontagers have to pay for the\r\n\r\nmaking-up of their roads. They will also  have  to\r\n\r\npay  extra  assessment once the road is completed.\r\n\r\nThe annual value will increase as each new amenity\r\n\r\nis   brought   within   their   reach,   such   as\r\n\r\nelectricity,  water  or  sewerage.  Despite   this\r\n\r\nincreased  valuation  and  extra  expenditure   on\r\n\r\nrates,  will  the Government still  acquire  their\r\n\r\nproperties at the 22nd of April market value? Will\r\n\r\nthis  not  be  a  case of great  hardship,  indeed\r\n\r\ninjustice,  to  numbers of by no means  well-to-do\r\n\r\npeople living on private roads?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said, I hope, enough to show that\r\n\r\nthis  is  not a very desirable Bill in its present\r\n\r\nform - vague, full of loopholes, made all  the  more\r\n\r\nundesirable  if  it is to be pushed  through  this\r\n\r\nHouse  without  proper  consideration.  I  repeat,\r\n\r\nnobody wants to see speculation arising or special\r\n\r\nadvantage gained as a result\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the publication of the Master Plan; but a much\r\n\r\nsimpler  Bill than the present one is all that  is\r\n\r\nneeded  to  see  that this is  prevented,  and  to\r\n\r\nprevent  an  otherwise inevitable black-market  in\r\n\r\nland transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Telok Ayer\r\n\r\n(Mr R.

If\r\n\r\nGovernment had to pay the increased price  brought\r\n\r\nabout  by  the publication of the Master Plan  and\r\n\r\nthe   pressure  of  increasing  population,  these\r\n\r\nsatellite    towns   would    be    rendered    an\r\n\r\nimpossibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, Mr Marshall explained, sought to pay\r\n\r\nthe  maximum price of October 1953, which, in  his\r\n\r\nopinion,  was a very high price indeed. \"Where  is\r\n\r\nthe  confiscation?  Where is  the  suffering?\"  he\r\n\r\nasked.  He added, \"The Bill is timid. It does  not\r\n\r\ngo  anywhere near far enough.

In a memorandum to the Chairman of\r\n\r\nthe Select Committee on the Acquisition of Land\r\n\r\n(Amendment No. 3) Bill, 1953, Mr Marshall stated\r\n\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We have followed the controversy over the\r\n\r\nprinciple introduced by Section 9 of the Bill, and\r\n\r\nare  all  too  conscious of some of the  one-sided\r\n\r\nrepresentations made to you by interested  parties\r\n\r\nwhose occupation it is to make profits out of land\r\n\r\nand who could, and did, give considerable time and\r\n\r\nspend money on legal advice and representation  to\r\n\r\npresent their sectional view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of us is a domiciled British subject keenly\r\n\r\ninterested in the welfare of this Colony and  with\r\n\r\nno  axe whatever to grind in the matter now before\r\n\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We view the provisions of this Bill against the\r\n\r\nbackground of certain basic factors: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This Colony is a very small island.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) There is living on this small Island a\r\n\r\npopulation  of  more  than 1,100,000,  and  it  is\r\n\r\nreliably anticipated that this population will  be\r\n\r\ndoubled by internal expansion in 20 years, so that\r\n\r\nin  that  period we have to find room for  another\r\n\r\n1,100,000  people  in  the  limited  area  at  our\r\n\r\ndisposal  after  making  provisions  for   defence\r\n\r\nrequirements, catchment areas, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) This intensive internal increase of\r\n\r\npopulation  within  so  limited  a  space  is,  we\r\n\r\nbelieve, a phenomenon unparalleled elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The price of land during the past 50 years\r\n\r\nprincipally  as  a  result  of  the  pressure   of\r\n\r\nincreasing population has risen fantastically, and\r\n\r\nlandlords have reaped and are reaping profits  out\r\n\r\nof  all proportion to even commercial concepts  of\r\n\r\nreasonable returns on capital outlay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no objection to the principle as such of\r\n\r\nprofit  making  on  however  large  a  scale,  and\r\n\r\nrejoice  with whoever discovers gold  and  diamond\r\n\r\nmines,   or   wins  a  lottery,  or  perfects   an\r\n\r\ninvention,  but where uninhibited exploitation  of\r\n\r\nthe  law  of  supply  and demand  precludes  human\r\n\r\nbeings from utilising, basic necessities of  life,\r\n\r\nthen, in our view,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch   uninhibited  exploitation  for  prohibitive\r\n\r\nprofits  is  a  public evil, and such  anti-social\r\n\r\nconduct should be controlled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) It is apparent to us that the conduct of\r\n\r\nlandowners   in  exploiting  to  its  utmost   the\r\n\r\nconsiderable  demand for land due to  pressure  of\r\n\r\npopulation   is  directly  responsible   for   the\r\n\r\nhorrible  state  that exists in certain  areas  in\r\n\r\nthis  Colony of a thousand human beings  per  acre\r\n\r\npiled  up in wretched cloth cubicles. Such conduct\r\n\r\nis   also   directly  responsible  for  the   very\r\n\r\nunhealthy  position that exists of only a  handful\r\n\r\nof  domiciled  persons owning their own  homes  in\r\n\r\nthis Colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The doctrine of freedom of action of\r\n\r\nindividuals   is   accepted  by  all   responsible\r\n\r\npersons, including the objectors to this Bill,  as\r\n\r\nbeing limited within the framework of the good  of\r\n\r\nthe  whole;  and  we  have at all  times  had  the\r\n\r\nprotection of the Courts in the enforcement of the\r\n\r\nCriminal  Law to prevent the freedom of action  of\r\n\r\nthe  individual from being exercised in  abuse  of\r\n\r\nthe good of the general public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objectors to this Bill, however, seem to\r\n\r\nconsider  that  the  principle  of  limitation  of\r\n\r\nfreedom of action within the framework of the good\r\n\r\nof  the  whole is not applicable to the realms  of\r\n\r\ncommercial   economics   and   particularly    not\r\n\r\napplicable to landowners who seemingly  have  some\r\n\r\nsacred  right  to freedom of action  in  unimpeded\r\n\r\nexploitation irrespective of the detriment to  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot accept this contention, nor do we\r\n\r\nbelieve   has  it  ever  been  accepted   by   any\r\n\r\nGovernment  at  any  time in the  history  of  the\r\n\r\nworld,  and  it  is  our hope  to  prove  in  this\r\n\r\nmemorandum, that such alleged right to uninhibited\r\n\r\nexploitation should not be permitted to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) It is our considered view that it is the\r\n\r\nduty  of responsible Government in this Colony  to\r\n\r\ntake  urgent  steps to-day to make provisions  for\r\n\r\nthe  housing, not only of the homeless  of  to-day\r\n\r\nwho  live  piled up in foetid hovels, but  of  the\r\n\r\nanticipated increase of population in the next  20\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) We sincerely believe that the possession of\r\n\r\na  home and a place to work in is one of the basic\r\n\r\nneeds  of  a  human  being, and an  economy  which\r\n\r\nrequires human beings to live and work in wretched\r\n\r\ncircumstances, which the objectors  to  this  Bill\r\n\r\nwould  not  permit their dogs to be subjected  to,\r\n\r\nwill  create  antagonistic rebellious  anti-social\r\n\r\nelements.  The  potential danger of not  providing\r\n\r\nhousing  for  the  population is  very  great  and\r\n\r\nespecially for the type of persons who  object  to\r\n\r\nthis  Bill. It is unfortunate they cannot see,  in\r\n\r\ntheir  own personal interests, that, there  should\r\n\r\nbe some limitation to the uninhibited exploitation\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the dragon's teeth they sow  and  which\r\n\r\nwill  reap  for them and the rest of  the  country\r\n\r\ngrave retribution in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We prefer to appeal to you on the wider basis of\r\n\r\nelementary justice to human beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Within this view of the needs of the\r\n\r\ndomiciled  people  of this country,  the  aim  and\r\n\r\neffect of the Bill is extremely limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we understand it the Government, in common\r\n\r\nwith  all  persons with any acquaintance  of  land\r\n\r\nvalues, is satisfied that there will inevitably be\r\n\r\na  considerable increase in the price of land  due\r\n\r\nto increase of population in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we understand that there is a\r\n\r\nMaster Plan for the development of this Island, to\r\n\r\nrelieve the dreadful pressure of the homeless  for\r\n\r\nhousing,  and  that the publication of  this  Plan\r\n\r\nawaits the coming into force of the provisions  of\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We furthermore understand the Government is\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that  the  publication  of  this   Plan\r\n\r\nshowing  areas required for particular development\r\n\r\nwill  immediately  affect  land  values.

These  two  attempts\r\n\r\nfailed  because  of  similar  tactics  adopted  by\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  same Party during  the  previous\r\n\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister has, in his reply to\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim  Koon  Teck),\r\n\r\ncovered almost every objection that can be  raised\r\n\r\nagainst  this Bill. Are we to look after the  poor\r\n\r\nand needy, or are we to look after the handful  of\r\n\r\nrich  landowners who do nothing but suck from  the\r\n\r\npoor?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some 2,000\r\n\r\nyears ago or more there was in China a utilitarian\r\n\r\nphilosopher  called Ho Kuan-tze, and  I  recollect\r\n\r\none  of  his sayings which seems to me  highly  in\r\n\r\npoint  in this debate. He said, \"Seek nothing  for\r\n\r\nyourself.  Only  what is for the general  good  is\r\n\r\npermissible.\" If we apply this to land policy,  it\r\n\r\nwill  have most far-reaching effects; and  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, you can say that there has been\r\n\r\nthrough  recorded history a struggle  between  the\r\n\r\npowers  that  sought to treat land  as  the  basic\r\n\r\nnecessity  for  human life and therefore  a  thing\r\n\r\nwhich  must be shared equally and fairly, and  the\r\n\r\npeople  who say that land is a basic necessity  of\r\n\r\nlife, and we will grab it and exploit our position\r\n\r\nand  compel people to pay the maximum rent for  it\r\n\r\nthat  we  can extract. That has been  a  long  and\r\n\r\nhistorical struggle, and you will find  traces  of\r\n\r\nit  in  the  laws of England. The original  theory\r\n\r\nthere was that land was held in trust, not for the\r\n\r\npurpose of private profit exploitation, but when a\r\n\r\nman  had  proved himself to be a good  and  worthy\r\n\r\nservant  of the King, he then received a grant  of\r\n\r\nland  which was held in trust in relation  to  his\r\n\r\npast  and  future services. He was  not  there  to\r\n\r\nexploit  the  land, but to use it as  a  means  of\r\n\r\nservice.  You can find the same idea in  my  small\r\n\r\nreading  in the subject in India and in Egypt,  in\r\n\r\nChina   and  in  the  Western  European  countries\r\n\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that land is not a proper commodity\r\n\r\nfor  trade  at  all. I know that  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  will very much resent that view.  They\r\n\r\nfeel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  it  is a highly proper commodity  for  trade\r\n\r\nbecause   it  is  extremely  profitable.   It   is\r\n\r\nprofitable to the individual, but it is disastrous\r\n\r\nto  the  community. I expect nearly  everybody  in\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber knows what a traffic block  is,  and\r\n\r\nthe whole basis of our traffic blocks in Singapore\r\n\r\nis    uncoordinated   development    by    private\r\n\r\nindividuals  on  the basis of profit.  Instead  of\r\n\r\nhaving  your streets developed as traffic arteries\r\n\r\ndown  which  traffic flows, they are developed  as\r\n\r\ntrading  centres in which people  are  seeking  to\r\n\r\nexploit preferential positions; and as a result of\r\n\r\nthat  attempt  at exploitation, you  have  streets\r\n\r\nobstructed  and  blocked,  and  it  is   extremely\r\n\r\ndifficult for vehicles to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same sort of way, I expect many of you\r\n\r\nlook  at  your  consolidated bills from  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  and  say,  'Well,  that  is  an  awfully\r\n\r\nexpensive bill.' It would be a great deal  cheaper\r\n\r\nif  the  town  had  been  planned  as  an  overall\r\n\r\ndevelopment instead of being developed by  private\r\n\r\nenterprise  for private profit. The cost  of  your\r\n\r\nCity Council, both in its capital cost and in  its\r\n\r\nrecurrent  expenditure, derives very largely  from\r\n\r\nhaving  to  lay their underground pipes  and  that\r\n\r\nkind  of  thing  through  a  maze  of  ill-planned\r\n\r\nstreets and unco-ordinated development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had some pitiful words about the\r\n\r\nhardship of the man who owns a little bit of land.\r\n\r\nIn  many  cases, it may be true, and the Hon. the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Local Government, Lands and  Housing\r\n\r\nis  perfectly aware of it. He has referred to  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  there being hard  cases  of  that\r\n\r\nkind,   and   has  said  they  will  get   special\r\n\r\ntreatment. But I would like to point out  to  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  opposite that a small piece of  land  can\r\n\r\nstill  be extremely valuable. A piece of land  the\r\n\r\nsize of a badminton court down in this part of the\r\n\r\ntown  will have a much greater value in the market\r\n\r\nthan  a  very large area of land in the middle  of\r\n\r\nthe  Sahara desert. It is not the size of the land\r\n\r\nthat  necessarily produces its exploitable  value,\r\n\r\nbut it is its position. When files come across  my\r\n\r\ndesk in my office, I am continually seeing how the\r\n\r\noverall  development, one service or  another,  is\r\n\r\nheld up by the fact that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsomebody  is  sitting on a piece of  land  and  he\r\n\r\ncannot  be  moved; and when you want to move  him,\r\n\r\nyou  find that somebody else is sitting on another\r\n\r\npiece of land and you cannot move A to B because B\r\n\r\nwill  not  get  to  C.  The  public  interest   is\r\n\r\ncontinually  obstructed by people  who  have  some\r\n\r\nsort of tenancy right; they just sit there and you\r\n\r\ncannot  move them out. It is absolutely essential,\r\n\r\nif  you  are  going  to get development  that  can\r\n\r\npossibly  cope  with  a population  coming  up  to\r\n\r\n2,000,000,  that you should have very wide  powers\r\n\r\nindeed - powers  both to secure land when  necessary\r\n\r\nand  see  that  the  small  man  does  not  suffer\r\n\r\nhardship  as  a result. When you have to  transfer\r\n\r\nthe  small man from one piece of land in order  to\r\n\r\nget a new road, you may have to put him on another\r\n\r\npiece of land. You are not going to pay some  rich\r\n\r\nlandlord  a very large sum before you can transfer\r\n\r\nyour squatters there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede), I think, said\r\n\r\nthat he did not object to the principle that there\r\n\r\nshould be no profit made out of increases in value\r\n\r\narising  from  the Master Plan,  but  he  did  not\r\n\r\napparently object to people making profits out  of\r\n\r\na rise in population. A population increase is the\r\n\r\nessential  thing  that will  produce  higher  land\r\n\r\nvalues,  and the man who makes profit out of  that\r\n\r\nfactor  is  like  a fireman who  would  refuse  to\r\n\r\nrescue  a  baby from a fire until he had extracted\r\n\r\nthe  last  possible dollar from the parents  as  a\r\n\r\nsort of reward. The situation is that we are going\r\n\r\nto   have  an  increasing  slum  population,   and\r\n\r\neverything  that  blocks the provision  of  proper\r\n\r\nhomes  for these people is a horrible exploitation\r\n\r\nof the misery of hundreds of thousands of people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other points which he raised which I\r\n\r\nthink  perhaps could be dealt with more profitably\r\n\r\nin  the  Committee stage of the Bill, but  he  did\r\n\r\nnote    various    complications   which    arise,\r\n\r\nparticularly  from  the  bad  inheritance  of  the\r\n\r\npast - private roads for example. There are  private\r\n\r\nroads  in  Singapore that are a shocking blot  and\r\n\r\ndisgrace,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot to the Government or the City Council, but  to\r\n\r\nthe  landlords.

I do\r\n\r\nnot  recollect  the  date  perfectly,  but  I   do\r\n\r\nrecollect  the  words.  It was  a  United  Nations\r\n\r\nCommission  that  came to this happy  island,  and\r\n\r\nthey remarked, when they left: \"Singapore is being\r\n\r\nstrangled  in an iron ring of landlords and  land-owners\": and it is that iron ring that has  to  be\r\n\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

It\r\n\r\nis  simple  and  non-contentious,  and  thoroughly\r\n\r\namiable  in  character. It derives from  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  on the streets of  Singapore  some\r\n\r\n50,000 or 60,000 deadly weapons which people take\r\n\r\naround  with them and from time to time kill  each\r\n\r\nother with. These are the motorcars, and whilst it\r\n\r\nis  perhaps fair enough that one adult should kill\r\n\r\nanother  with  his  motorcar,  it  is  right  that\r\n\r\nchildren should be protected if they can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this Bill is to ensure that, where\r\n\r\nyou have numbers of children moving at fixed times\r\n\r\nacross  the road, there should be adequate control\r\n\r\nto  ensure that they are protected. As a  motorist\r\n\r\nmyself,  I  think that motorists also will  derive\r\n\r\nsome  protection,  and they will  no  longer  have\r\n\r\nminiature Belles of St. Trinian's trotting  across\r\n\r\nthe  road  in  front of their wheels  and  scaring\r\n\r\ntheir hearts into their mouths!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third advantage to be derived from the Bill is\r\n\r\nthat  it  will  set free some of our  hard-working\r\n\r\nPolice Force from tedious and onerous duties which\r\n\r\nare  not really part of their job, and which  will\r\n\r\nenable  them to devote themselves more effectively\r\n\r\nto policing this city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need say more about this Bill,\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy Speaker, except that I will  certainly\r\n\r\nwelcome   any   suggestions  or  improvements   or\r\n\r\namendments,  which can be brought  to  it  in  the\r\n\r\nCommittee stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

If anybody wants to know them,\r\n\r\nhe  can  get them any time he wants to.

On\r\n\r\nthat  day, by the inaugural meeting of the Federal\r\n\r\nLegislative  Council, a new era  will  dawn  which\r\n\r\nmust     inevitably    culminate    in    complete\r\n\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the Federation, by their massive\r\n\r\nvoting attendance unparalleled, in so far as I  am\r\n\r\naware,  in any other democratic country, by  their\r\n\r\nunique   unity   and   their   intransigent   non-communalism, have dramatically demonstrated  their\r\n\r\ninflexible will to independence and their capacity\r\n\r\nfor independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That day of rejoicing, Sir, for the people of\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  is  a  day  of  inspiration  and\r\n\r\nrejoicing for us. Whatever misunderstandings there\r\n\r\nmay  be  today  or  tomorrow - and misunderstandings\r\n\r\nthere can be even between loving brothers - our fate\r\n\r\nin  Singapore is inextricably woven with  that  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation, and I would not have it otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I know of the policy of Her Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment,  I  believe that  the  Federation  and\r\n\r\nSingapore   will  march  together  towards   self-government   and   together   we   will    achieve independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two territories, joined by a short\r\n\r\ncauseway, are a geographical, economic and  ethnic\r\n\r\nentity.  Political  unity  is  essential  for  our\r\n\r\nmutual welfare. In so far as lies in my power, the\r\n\r\ndoor  on  this  side will remain permanently  wide\r\n\r\nopen for the achievement of a political unity that\r\n\r\nalone can make possible real independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At every stage of our political development in\r\n\r\nSingapore, I envisage the closest and friendliest\r\n\r\nco-operation and co-ordination in all  aspects  of\r\n\r\nmajor  policy and legislation between us, because,\r\n\r\nto  the extent, Sir, that we drift apart, to  that\r\n\r\nextent shall we be weakened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Federal Legislative Councillors, on\r\n\r\nbehalf of my colleagues and myself, I say you have\r\n\r\nour warm and sincere good wishes and our boundless\r\n\r\ngoodwill.

It  is\r\n\r\nregrettable that this aspiration of the people  is\r\n\r\nnot  included  in  the message. I  think  that  we\r\n\r\nshould,  in  our message, express our  desire  for\r\n\r\nunity  and not just for co-operation only.  It  is\r\n\r\ninadequate  just  to  extend  our  hands  in   co-\r\n\r\noperation  across the Straits of Johore.  What  we\r\n\r\nreally  want is that the Straits of Johore  should\r\n\r\ncease  to be a political boundary.

I may say that I have made  very\r\n\r\nmany  friends  amongst  the  generous  and  kindly\r\n\r\npeople  of Malaya, that I have set down  my  roots\r\n\r\nand have established myself as a Malayan, and that\r\n\r\nI  look  forward with great happiness to the  most\r\n\r\nfruitful  co-operation and ultimate  unity  between\r\n\r\nthe two territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that our message, however, should\r\n\r\ncarry   the  word  'unity'  as  though   we   were\r\n\r\nattempting to give directions to the Federation. I\r\n\r\ndo  not  need  to talk in terms of  which  is  the\r\n\r\nsenior partner, I hope, on an occasion like this;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut they are, anyhow, a larger geographical entity\r\n\r\nwith a very much larger population.

It is an historic  occasion,\r\n\r\nbecause,   with  this  Council,  a  new  political\r\n\r\nsituation of intense interest opens up. It  is  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  more than in Singapore  that  the\r\n\r\nfinal    battle    between   the   British,    the\r\n\r\nnationalists, and the Communists will  be  fought,\r\n\r\nand won, or lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is comforting to us here to remember that,\r\n\r\nwhatever  mistakes we may have made and may  make,\r\n\r\nthey  will  not  be fatal. A very  far  from  weak\r\n\r\nBritish   administration  is  manipulating,   very\r\n\r\ndelicately  and  very skilfully,  the  upsurge  of\r\n\r\nnationalism that has caused the emotional  fervour\r\n\r\nwhich  nationalism means today in  Malaya,  as  it\r\n\r\nindeed  means  in  every  part  of  Asia.  It   is\r\n\r\nnegotiating with skill between the U.M.N.O.-M.C.A.-M.I.C.  Alliance,  which has taken  over  part  of\r\n\r\nconstituted authority, and the armed forces  of  a\r\n\r\nmilitant Communism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next three months are exciting because\r\n\r\nthey are potent with decisive developments. Is the\r\n\r\nshooting going to go on? Is it going to stop?  If\r\n\r\nit  stops,  what then? These are questions,  which\r\n\r\nevery  one  of  us asks ourselves. These  are  the\r\n\r\nquestions  which will decide not only  how  Malaya\r\n\r\ngoes,  but  how  Singapore goes in the  next  four\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister of the Federation is a very\r\n\r\ndifferent  man  from  our  own  illustrious  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister.

It does seem a little unfair to refer\r\n\r\nto  him  as  an expatriate, for if any  man  is  a\r\n\r\nuniversalist, Malcolm MacDonald is certainly  one.\r\n\r\nDespite  the  twinge of nostalgia  with  which  he\r\n\r\nmight  greet the call of the bagpipes,  he  is  at\r\n\r\nhome  everywhere, because he loves  human  beings,\r\n\r\nand  differences  of  colour  and  differences  of\r\n\r\ncustom merely make them more interesting to a  man\r\n\r\nbig  enough to love all humanity. Sir, it is as  a\r\n\r\nman  who  loves his fellow-men and who  recognises\r\n\r\nthe  equal  brotherhood of all human  beings  that\r\n\r\nMalcolm MacDonald has succeeded in being a one-man\r\n\r\ncivilising  factor  of  colonial  rule   in   this\r\n\r\nterritory  at  a crucial stage of our development.\r\n\r\nAs the most delightful speaker we have ever known;\r\n\r\nas an ardent supporter of our national sport; as a\r\n\r\njudicious and generous patron of our artists; as a\r\n\r\ngay   friend,  a  wise  counsellor  and   a   most\r\n\r\nunconventional   ambassador,   he   has   been   a\r\n\r\nrefreshing humanising force in an era of hidebound\r\n\r\nofficialdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political activities of this laughing\r\n\r\ndiplomat,  as  the Straits Times so happily  calls\r\n\r\nhim,  are  the well-kept secrets of Phoenix  Park,\r\n\r\nbut  I  have had glimpses of this man, so much  at\r\n\r\nhome  in a bevy of lovely women, working arduously\r\n\r\nand  tirelessly through long hours at  affairs  of\r\n\r\nstate. I believe, and I say this in all sincerity,\r\n\r\nthat  his  efforts have been consistently directed\r\n\r\nto  help us to stand on our own feet - a free and  a\r\n\r\nhappy  people. I am satisfied, Sir,  that  in  the\r\n\r\nrecent constitutional crisis, his experience,  his\r\n\r\nwisdom  and  his love for the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nwere  material  factors in  assisting  us  in  our\r\n\r\nlegitimate aspirations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this man on the eve of his departure to wider\r\n\r\npastures, I ask that this Assembly, in the name of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore, should  say:  \"Malcolm\r\n\r\nMacDonald, it has been good knowing you - Selamat Jalan and Selamat Kembali!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we the members of the Singapore Legislative Assembly, on behalf of the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\ndo  place  on record in the following  terms  our\r\n\r\nrecognition  of the unique services  rendered  to\r\n\r\nSingapore   by  Malcolm  MacDonald  as  Governor-General,  and  then  as Commissioner-General  for\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom in South-East Asia: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Holding the highest office among Her Majesty's\r\n\r\nrepresentatives in South-East  Asia,  you  have\r\n\r\ninterpreted your duty to represent Her  Majesty\r\n\r\nnot  only  to  Governments and with Governments\r\n\r\nbut  to  the  people,  and  we  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore have been impressed by your wide  and\r\n\r\nwarm sympathies and sincere friendliness as you\r\n\r\nmove freely among us.

He\r\n\r\nhas  admitted in many gatherings that his  friends\r\n\r\nare not only those with high and big coats on, but\r\n\r\nalso  those  without any shirts on  them!  Indeed,\r\n\r\nSir, to consider other people his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfriends  is  one thing, but he has been considered\r\n\r\nby  all  concerned  as their friend.  We  witness,\r\n\r\nbefore  his departure, many parties given  in  his\r\n\r\nhonour,  and you have to book in advance  or  else\r\n\r\nyou  may not get a date. Higher circles have their\r\n\r\nsay;  trade unionists call him 'the greatest trade\r\n\r\nunionist'; youth movements with their little  boys\r\n\r\nand  girls  have always looked towards  him  as  a\r\n\r\nfriend  and he has always been their very  sincere\r\n\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malcolm MacDonald, in contrast to a few\r\n\r\nexpatriates,  I  should say,  is  about  the  best\r\n\r\nBritisher we have known in recent times.  I  think\r\n\r\nhe is a shining example of what a Britisher should\r\n\r\nbe.  I therefore, Sir, take pleasure to second the\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir that must\r\n\r\nhave  been  the longest of all the messages  which\r\n\r\nyou  have  recently been asked by  this  House  to\r\n\r\ncarry to various persons and parties. In so far as\r\n\r\nwe  are  being asked to wish Mr Malcolm MacDonald\r\n\r\nwell  in  his  new post in India, we join  in  the\r\n\r\nvaledictions  which, by local  custom,  accompany\r\n\r\nthe   departure  of  popular  British   officials.\r\n\r\nSometimes   even   more  so,  these   valedictions\r\n\r\naccompany  the  departure  of  unpopular   British\r\n\r\nofficials.  But Mr MacDonald need have  no  fears\r\n\r\nunder which category he falls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had this motion confined its eulogies to a\r\n\r\nrecital of the charm and grace with which he moved\r\n\r\namongst the Asians, it would have had a completely\r\n\r\nsmooth  passage in this House. It is to his credit\r\n\r\nthat he bore the burden of empire without the  air\r\n\r\nof  a  tin  god,  moving disdainfully  amongst  we\r\n\r\nbenighted  heathens. He took the stuffing  out  of\r\n\r\nthe  stuffed  shirts,  a  felony  for  which  many\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  Tanglin  Club  have  not   quite\r\n\r\nforgiven  him.  Much to the dismay  of  the  white\r\n\r\naristocrats,   he  started  to  break   down   the\r\n\r\nbarriers,  which  kept  the heaven-born  in  their\r\n\r\nplace - the Putney-born and the London-born - and  the\r\n\r\nAsians  in  theirs.  As I said,  had  this  motion\r\n\r\nconfined   itself   to   this   aspect   of    his\r\n\r\ncontributions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  Malaya  and to South-East Asia, it would  have\r\n\r\nhad our unanimous blessings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, Sir, unfortunately, we are also\r\n\r\nbeing  asked,  if  I may read  the  words  of  the\r\n\r\nmotion:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"on behalf of the people of Singapore, do place\r\n\r\non  record  our  appreciation\"  of  the  political\r\n\r\nactivities of the right honourable Gentleman,  His\r\n\r\nExcellency the Commissioner-General for the United\r\n\r\nKingdom  in  SouthEast  Asia - the  instrument  of\r\n\r\nBritish foreign policy in this part of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party thinks it is unfair, both to the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore and to the Commissioner-General,  to\r\n\r\nlink  up a message of goodwill with an unnecessary\r\n\r\nendorsement  of British foreign policy  in  SouthEast  Asia. It may be that the Government has  its\r\n\r\nreasons for approving the political activities  of\r\n\r\nPhoenix Park. The Government is entitled  to  its\r\n\r\nopinion.  But there are other opinions.  There  is\r\n\r\nthe opinion of the People's Action Party shared by\r\n\r\na not inconsiderable portion of the population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we all want to convey to His Excellency\r\n\r\nour   best  wishes,  we  cannot  place  on  record\r\n\r\nsomething with which we profoundly disagree.  This\r\n\r\nmotion  attributes to the Commissioner-General  an\r\n\r\nappreciation, if I may read it from  the  text  of\r\n\r\nthe motion, of \"the liberating and creative forces\r\n\r\nof  democratic  nationalism in Asia.\"  This  is  a\r\n\r\nclaim,  Sir, which I feel the Commissioner-General\r\n\r\nwould be the first to repudiate as having erred on\r\n\r\nthe  side of effusiveness. Such an assertion might\r\n\r\npass  in an after-dinner speech when sentiment  is\r\n\r\nwhat  matters. But when something is to be put  on\r\n\r\nrecord  in  this  Assembly, and  after  ten  days'\r\n\r\nnotice  has been given of the terms of the motion,\r\n\r\nwe  feel a greater degree of objectivity would not\r\n\r\nbe uncalled for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British Government's appreciation, through\r\n\r\nits  political  representative, of the  liberating\r\n\r\nand  creative forces of democratic nationalism  in\r\n\r\nAsia  has  not been all it could and  should  have\r\n\r\nbeen, and indeed can yet still be. I am willing to\r\n\r\nconcede that, as a person, Mr MacDonald may  have\r\n\r\nappreciated these things differently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the case of His Majesty the Emperor Bao\r\n\r\nDai,   whom  Mr  MacDonald,  on  behalf  of   Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's Government, recently had to present as a\r\n\r\ngreat  Vietnamese patriot who was  going  to  save\r\n\r\nIndo-China from Communism for democracy. The  only\r\n\r\nthing  that  that gentleman has saved is  himself,\r\n\r\nand  I  understand  he is now languishing  in  the\r\n\r\ncasinos  on the French Riviera. I had the singular\r\n\r\nexperience  of  being  present  at  a  Press  club\r\n\r\nluncheon  when  His Excellency, on behalf  of  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's Government, described this same  monarch\r\n\r\nas  \"His  Majesty  the  Emperor  Bao  Dai - a  great\r\n\r\nstatesman,  cool, calculating and  courageous\".  A\r\n\r\nshort  while  later,  when  the  Communists   were\r\n\r\nsweeping down from North Vietnam and the patriotic\r\n\r\nEmperor  had  packed up his extensive luggage  and\r\n\r\nleft  the  country even before the French quitted,\r\n\r\nit  occurred  to me that an alliteration,  equally\r\n\r\neuphonious  but  more accurate in describing  that\r\n\r\ngentleman,  would  have been cold, calculating  and\r\n\r\ncallous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in so far as this motion\r\n\r\nappears  to seek approval - I would like to be  very\r\n\r\nfair  to  the Hon. the Chief Minister - for  British\r\n\r\nforeign policy in South-East Asia, we must  record\r\n\r\nour complete dissent. We disagree with the policy\r\n\r\nwhich  Phoenix  Park  has  been  responsible   for\r\n\r\nexecuting  in this part of the world. We  disagree\r\n\r\nwith  the support of the French for Bao Dai which\r\n\r\nhas led to the Communist victory in Indo-China. We\r\n\r\ndisagree  with  the  creation  of  Bangkok  as   a\r\n\r\nmilitary base in S.E.A.T.O.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion also propounds another thesis of\r\n\r\ndoubtful political validity. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We believe your influence has always been to\r\n\r\nbuild  our  self-confidence and the confidence  of\r\n\r\nothers  in us which has helped speed our political\r\n\r\nadvance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking for the P.A.P., at no time has the\r\n\r\nCommissioner-General given us self-confidence, nor\r\n\r\nhas  he  strengthened the support of our followers\r\n\r\nin our Party -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Sir, that the last two or three\r\n\r\nsittings  of  this House have been preoccupied  by\r\n\r\nother  more  exciting and probably more  important\r\n\r\nmatters than this motion to continue in force  the\r\n\r\nEmergency Regulations. So it is nearly four months\r\n\r\nthis  afternoon  since my hon.  Friend  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  last  moved  a similar  motion  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  When he did so last April, he  promised\r\n\r\nthat, within the next three months, the Government\r\n\r\nwould  exhaustively investigate whether there  was\r\n\r\nany   necessity  for  continuing  the   state   of\r\n\r\nEmergency and, even if that should be so,  whether\r\n\r\nthere   was  any  necessity  for  continuing   the\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations as a  whole.  He  undertook\r\n\r\nthat,  within  three months, the Government  would\r\n\r\nmake a clear declaration of policy on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, much has happened since the day when\r\n\r\nthat promise was made. Almost at the time that  it\r\n\r\nwas   being  made,  there  were  forces  at  work,\r\n\r\ninflaming the passions of decent ordinary  workers\r\n\r\nand inciting students to agitation, the result  of\r\n\r\nwhich was that in May, we had ugly riots and  four\r\n\r\ndeaths. The Government then was faced with a  very\r\n\r\nreal  and  pressing  Emergency.  Far  from  making\r\n\r\nprogress  in  our  examination  of  the  Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations and the need for them, we were obliged\r\n\r\nto  come  to this House to get approval to restore\r\n\r\nto  the Commissioner of Police the power to impose\r\n\r\na curfew, the power which we had ourselves revoked\r\n\r\nonly   three   weeks  previously.   Against   that\r\n\r\nbackground  of  a  most dangerous  threat  to  the\r\n\r\npublic  security of Singapore, our examination  of\r\n\r\nthe Emergency Regulations became unreal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in June, we hoped that law and order and\r\n\r\nthe innate decency and good sense of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore had prevailed over those evil influences\r\n\r\nwhich  seek to create disorder and violence  here;\r\n\r\nbut again, we found ourselves faced with a serious\r\n\r\nthreat  to  the  well-being of this  island  in  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  strike.  Once more, we had  to  face  the\r\n\r\ngrave   responsibility  of  ensuring  the   public\r\n\r\nsafety - the   primary   responsibility    of    any\r\n\r\ngovernment - the responsibility of seeing  that  its\r\n\r\ncitizens  can  go  about  their  lawful  occasions\r\n\r\nwithout  danger to life and property  and  without\r\n\r\nrisk of mob violence. In speaking in this Assembly\r\n\r\ntowards  the end of June, the Chief Minister  gave\r\n\r\nan  account of the measures which the Government,\r\n\r\nunder  his leadership, felt that it was  right  to\r\n\r\ntake to safeguard the situation then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having thus overcome these two threats to law\r\n\r\nand  order  and the whole fabric of our Government\r\n\r\nhere,  we  were able then to turn to the  task  of\r\n\r\nreviewing the Emergency Regulations and  the  need\r\n\r\nfor  them,  and  as I think hon. Members  will  be\r\n\r\naware  from  public statements which have  already\r\n\r\nbeen made, we have reached a firm decision on  the\r\n\r\npolicy which we consider it is our duty to follow.\r\n\r\nOur policy is to embody in new legislation such of\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  and the powers of  the  Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations as we consider to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneeded  for  the good government of Singapore.  We\r\n\r\nhave  decided our policy and we have  carried  out\r\n\r\nthe  bulk of the work necessary to put that policy\r\n\r\ninto  execution.  At  the  last  sitting  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, we introduced seven Bills, and in  those\r\n\r\nseven  Bills  will be found the  majority  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  and powers which, in the view  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,   are   required   in   the    present\r\n\r\ncircumstances   here   in   Singapore.   As   this\r\n\r\nlegislation  is enacted, we shall then  allow  the\r\n\r\npresent  Emergency  Regulations  to  pass  out  of\r\n\r\nforce.  In  this way, I very much hope  that  this\r\n\r\nwill be the last time that I shall have to move in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly this motion asking for an extension\r\n\r\nof  the period of the Emergency Regulations. Much,\r\n\r\nof course, will depend on the progress that we can\r\n\r\nmake  in  this  Assembly in dealing with  the  new\r\n\r\nlegislation, which is already before you and with\r\n\r\nat  least one more important Bill, which we  shall\r\n\r\nbe  introducing.  That  is  the  Bill  for  Social\r\n\r\nSecurity  Registration which  we  shall  ask  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  to  enact, and we shall then  allow  the\r\n\r\npresent  provisions in the Emergency  Regulations,\r\n\r\nproviding for registration and identity cards,  to\r\n\r\nlapse.  If  we  can get this legislation  enacted,\r\n\r\nthen the Emergency Regulations will lapse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me probable that this House will\r\n\r\nwish  to  give  its attention mainly  to  our  new\r\n\r\nlegislation  and that this motion  today,  seeking\r\n\r\napproval   for  the  extension  of  the  Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations while we consider the new legislation,\r\n\r\nhas  become, shall I say, of less burning interest\r\n\r\nthan it usually is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think perhaps, Sir, the House will wish me to\r\n\r\ngive  some  brief account of the extent to  which,\r\n\r\nduring  the  period since I last  spoke,  we  have\r\n\r\nfound  it  necessary to make use of the powers  of\r\n\r\narrest    and    detention   in   the    Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations - those  being the powers  which  arouse\r\n\r\nthe   greatest   controversy,  and  very   rightly\r\n\r\nnaturally  arouse the greatest repugnance  amongst\r\n\r\nus  all.  When I last spoke, Sir, I reported  that\r\n\r\nduring  1954, we had made 69 Detention Orders  and\r\n\r\nthat  during the first three months of this  year,\r\n\r\nwe  had  made 17. During the second three  months,\r\n\r\nthat is from the middle of April to the middle  of\r\n\r\nJuly, again. 13 Detention Orders were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade  and  in the next month which has since  gone\r\n\r\nby, a further 4. So the total number of Detention\r\n\r\nOrders in the four-month period I am now reviewing\r\n\r\ncomes  to  17.  Of those 17, 4 persons  have  been\r\n\r\nconvicted  in  court,  and one  more  is  awaiting\r\n\r\ntrial.  Three have since been released subject  to\r\n\r\ncertain conditions of residence, and one has  been\r\n\r\nreleased  unconditionally, leaving 8  persons  who\r\n\r\nare  held  now  in  custody  purely  on  Detention\r\n\r\nOrders.  I hope, Sir, that when those figures  are\r\n\r\nconsidered in the light of the very serious events\r\n\r\nwhich  have  taken  place  during  the  last  four\r\n\r\nmonths,  this Assembly will agree with me  when  I\r\n\r\nsay that the Government has exercised these powers\r\n\r\nwith restraint and with judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, on this side of the House, fully share the\r\n\r\nrepugnance that all people feel to having to  keep\r\n\r\na  person in custody without bringing him to trial\r\n\r\nin  an open court under the ordinary procedure  of\r\n\r\nthe  law,  but  I  do  submit,  Sir,  that  as   a\r\n\r\nGovernment,   we  have  to  weigh   against   that\r\n\r\nrepugnance  our  bounden  duty  to  safeguard  the\r\n\r\npublic peace and the welfare of the state, and  on\r\n\r\nthat  issue, I am quite clear that the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  discharged its responsibility  with  complete\r\n\r\nintegrity. Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.
