Government\r\n\r\nplaces great importance in improving courtesy and service to the\r\n\r\npublic by its Government servants. At the end of 1960, a\r\n\r\nCommittee consisting of ministerial and departmental\r\n\r\nrepresentatives drew up a blue-print for improvements in the\r\n\r\nrelationship between the Government and the public. `This was\r\n\r\nfollowed by an intensive campaign in each Ministry to improve en\r\n\r\ncourtesy and service. Courtesy officers were appointed in each\r\n\r\nsection of the Ministry. Staff were briefed on the importance of\r\n\r\ncourtesy. Talks were given to staff dealing with the public, such\r\n\r\nas telephone operators, medical and health servants, nurses and\r\n\r\ndoctors. The co-operation of the unions was also sought in these\r\n\r\nefforts.

The Government has\r\n\r\nannounced that it will provide bursaries and financial assistance\r\n\r\nto poor students entering these institutions of higher learning\r\n\r\nto help them to continue with their studies. Sir, superficially\r\n\r\nthese promises sound very nice. But we have found that the \r\n\r\nGovernment has been making use of these bursaries under this Head to\r\n\r\nachieve the P.A.P.'s own selfish interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that before a bursary is issued, all students will\r\n\r\nhave to apply for it, and the Government will have to carry out\r\n\r\nan investigation which will take a long period of time. Of\r\n\r\ncourse, in the course of investigation, political factors will be\r\n\r\ninvolved. Perhaps certain students not liked by the Government\r\n\r\nwill not be able to get the bursaries. But even after getting the\r\n\r\nbursaries, these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay be cancelled. There is a recent case of a particular\r\n\r\nstudent's bursary being cancelled. The Government has also\r\n\r\ncancelled the bursaries of quite a good number of Nantah students\r\n\r\nwhose conduct and academic merits have been very good. These\r\n\r\nstudents have not been found to be deficient in their studies;\r\n\r\nnor has there been any blemish on their character. So the\r\n\r\nabolition of their bursaries can be attributed to the Govern\r\n\r\nment's political prejudices. Such actions by the Government\r\n\r\nundoubtedly can be construed as extorting funds from the public\r\n\r\nand misusing them. We know that in the past, the Government tried\r\n\r\nto split the student bodies in the universities. Bursaries were\r\n\r\nalso used as a means to achieve that purpose. For instance, the\r\n\r\nGovernment could resort to getting the help of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nelements in the institutions to propagate the line that if the\r\n\r\nstudents did not vote for their man, the P.A.P. man, then their\r\n\r\nbursaries would be cancelled. Such things did happen before in\r\n\r\nthe past. This has happened in Nanyang University and also in the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore. Therefore, we say that the true\r\n\r\nintention of the Government is to misuse public funds to carry\r\n\r\nout its open corruption. I will also raise another matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During August to September this year, the Public Service\r\n\r\nCommission wrote to the Ministry of Education in Japan to cancel\r\n\r\nthe bursary of a student who was the Chairman of the Malayan\r\n\r\nStudents Committee in Japan. Chua Swee Lin was the person who got\r\n\r\na Japanese scholarship amounting to $200 Malayan money per month\r\n\r\nin 1962 to learn ship-building. Because the students' union there\r\n\r\nexpressed their dissatisfaction with Malaysia, the Government\r\n\r\ntherefore took suppressive action against the student there, and\r\n\r\ntried to resort to the cancellation of the bursary through the\r\n\r\nJapanese Government to achieve its purpose. Such action by the\r\n\r\nGovernment -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

It may\r\n\r\nwell be that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe recall of the student is not within the powers of the Public\r\n\r\nService Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, this\r\n\r\naction of the Government has been carried out through the Public\r\n\r\nService Commission. It was the Public Service Commission that\r\n\r\nwrote to the Japanese Government to cancel the bursary of this\r\n\r\nparticular student. That is why I have mentioned this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to talk about certain matters relating to\r\n\r\nGovernment departments. If graduates want to join the Government\r\n\r\nservice so that they can teach, they have to go through a\r\n\r\nselection procedure by way of interview by the Public Service\r\n\r\nCommission. Many teachers in aided secondary schools applied to\r\n\r\nthe Public Service Commission for confirmation of their jobs\r\n\r\nafter a period of time, and they had their applications refused.\r\n\r\nIn other words, their applications to continue to teach in the\r\n\r\nschools were refused. I understand that many of these graduate\r\n\r\nteachers were not taken to be incapable or inefficient in their\r\n\r\nteaching. The fact is that the Public Service Commission, during\r\n\r\ntheir investigations, received certain information from the\r\n\r\nSpecial Branch. I would like to ask, where is the value of the\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission if they have to listen to and be\r\n\r\nsubjected to interference from the Special Branch? If that is the\r\n\r\ncase, then let the Special Branch take over their functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Jurong\r\n\r\nbegan with some very nasty allegations that scholar-ships are\r\n\r\nawarded on the basis of political patronage and political\r\n\r\nchicanery.

I reject both\r\n\r\nthe scurrilous allegations that the P.S.C. in fact carries out\r\n\r\nthe instructions of the Special Branch, and, therefore, it is\r\n\r\nbest that the Special Branch were to substitute itself for the\r\n\r\nP.S.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of these scholarships now appearing under the Head of\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission is to centralise and co-ordinate the\r\n\r\naward of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscholarships in such a way as to meet the requirements of the\r\n\r\nState; the Finance Ministry, the Economic Development Division,\r\n\r\nthe Education Ministry. Awards are given to persons on the basis\r\n\r\nof merit, not whether they are pro or against any political\r\n\r\nParty. But where a person is deemed a security risk to the State,\r\n\r\nwhere his political beliefs are of such a nature as to constitute\r\n\r\na risk, then it is not the business of the State to give money to\r\n\r\nsuch people in order to help them undermine the State. But these\r\n\r\npolicies are interpreted very liberally. Let me explain that the\r\n\r\nMember for Tampines was in receipt of a bursary under the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment whilst he was at the University of Nanyang. We are\r\n\r\nfairly wide and flexible. We do not want to make a man more\r\n\r\nembittered and more frustrated with society than he need be. If\r\n\r\nhe has youthful inclinations towards extreme political views,\r\n\r\nwell, by all means, let him go through that phase; let him\r\n\r\nmature. But when we know a man is already committed to the\r\n\r\ndestruction of the democratic State, it is not our business to\r\n\r\nspend money on him to equip him to carry out his purposes better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, this problem will arise on less\r\n\r\nand less occasions in the future, because, as the Member now\r\n\r\nknows, there is the Internal Security Act which makes it\r\n\r\nnecessary for a student to be security cleared first before he is\r\n\r\nadmitted to a university.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other allegation that the Public Service\r\n\r\nCommission wrote to the Japanese Government to cancel a\r\n\r\nscholarship given to a particular student, that is not within my\r\n\r\nknowledge. I do not think the Public Service Commission did any\r\n\r\nsuch thing. It is not in a position to communicate with any\r\n\r\nforeign Government. The only Ministry which now communicates with\r\n\r\nforeign Governments is the External Affairs Ministry in Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur. I do not even know whether it did or not. I should not\r\n\r\nassume, as the Member for Jurong did, that one student is so very\r\n\r\nimportant as to warrant the intervention of the External Affairs\r\n\r\nMinistry. I should not be the least bit surprised that the\r\n\r\nstudent brought it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nupon himself by his foolish activities in Japan which came to the\r\n\r\nnotice of the Japanese Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the selection of officers by the P.S.C. for\r\n\r\nappointments into the administrative or the education service.\r\n\r\nHere again, as I have said, it is not the business of the\r\n\r\nGovernment to appoint people either into the administrative or\r\n\r\nthe educational service to breed more disaffection and\r\n\r\ndisloyalty, not to a particular political Party or to a parti\r\n\r\ncular government of Singapore, but to the whole institution of\r\n\r\nthe State, to the whole concept of the democratic State. Here\r\n\r\nagain it is a policy which has to be implemented with a great\r\n\r\ndeal of sensitivity. One of the points the Public Service\r\n\r\nCommission must consider is the security risk a particular person\r\n\r\nmay carry with him into the administration; information which\r\n\r\ncomes from the Intelligence organs of the Government, now the\r\n\r\nCentral Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to weigh whether a man is really committed, or it is not\r\n\r\nbetter to give him a chance and a way out, to let him find\r\n\r\nfulfilment in fruitful, constructive work, than to throw that\r\n\r\naway out of sheer frustration and bitterness. It is a fine\r\n\r\nbalance. We do not want to make more people look more haggard,\r\n\r\nmore hard, and more bitter day by day, as the Member for Jurong\r\n\r\nand his colleagues do. Over the last one year, trouble upon\r\n\r\ntrouble has fallen upon his shoulders - very youthful shoulders,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir. First, it was the Member for Bukit Merah who\r\n\r\nwas leading the charge of the light brigade (a very light brigade\r\n\r\nthis one). The Member for Bukit Merah, being a much more cir\r\n\r\ncumspect, equable type, decided that this was a mug's game, if I\r\n\r\nmay say so, and has opted out from the leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Mr Speaker, Sir, -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I doubt if the remarks made by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister have any relevance to this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

But when we know\r\n\r\nthat the man is so embittered as to bring the State down, then I\r\n\r\nsay it is the business of the P.S.C.\r\n\r\nand let me inform the Member for Jurong that usually the P.S.C.\r\n\r\ntakes a lenient view and gives the man a chance. But when he\r\n\r\nturns out to be a security risk, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, on\r\n\r\nmy advice, intervenes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are foolish in the implementation of these\r\n\r\nscholarships, and giving of jobs, and if we are insensitive and\r\n\r\ncrude, we drive more people to bitterness and to opposition. That\r\n\r\nis not our job, that is not our intention, and that is not in our\r\n\r\ninterests.

I think the Member may be under some\r\n\r\nmisapprehension that it is either because the man is pro-P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nor pro-Alliance, or pro-Barisan.

Take, for example, a student of Nantah or the\r\n\r\nSingapore University or the Singapore Polytechnic, if he is\r\n\r\nagainst imperialism, i.e. if he is against the British masters,\r\n\r\nthen will the P.S.C. refuse to give him a bursary or a\r\n\r\nscholarship? We can give several interpretations of his\r\n\r\nbehaviour. Those who are in actual control have absolute power at\r\n\r\nany time over all the departments under their control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to raise one other point with regard to\r\n\r\nbursaries. The administration of bursaries is not aimed at\r\n\r\nfostering talent in our country. Why should I say this? I say\r\n\r\nthis because I have come across some highly talented students who\r\n\r\nhave been denied the opportunity of having bursaries or scholar\r\n\r\nships. Furthermore, because of their family circumstances, these\r\n\r\nhighly talented students cannot afford to go for further studies.\r\n\r\nI would have thought that bursaries would have been awarded\r\n\r\npurely on the basis of academic standards and financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties of the students. But the Government is not helping\r\n\r\nthese people who deserve bursaries. As far as I know, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s idea is to give bursaries to some students who are not\r\n\r\nso highly talented and who are not so poorly off. I, in the\r\n\r\nOpposition, have the responsibility to express the view that the\r\n\r\nGovernment should be urged to note the facts that I have \r\n\r\nraised - that the allocation of bursaries should not be based purely on\r\n\r\nsecurity grounds alone, because this should not be the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member\r\n\r\nfor Jalan Kayu can give me any specific instance where he thinks an award\r\n\r\nof a scholarship or a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbursary has been granted not in accordance with merit and need, I\r\n\r\nshall certainly have the matter investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to tell him that there .are two forms of\r\n\r\nscholarships and bursaries. One is on the basis of competitive\r\n\r\nmerit, regardless of the financial circumstances of the family;\r\n\r\ncompetitive merit and performance entitles the student to a\r\n\r\nscholarship. The other comes under the classification of bur\r\n\r\nsaries and other assistance. This is related to the question of\r\n\r\nneed - first, that the student is worth assisting; and second,\r\n\r\nthat the student is in need of assistance. If the Member will\r\n\r\nsupply me with any information - as he says he has knowledge of\r\n\r\nirregularity or improper award - I shall have the matter properly\r\n\r\ninvestigated. And I am quite prepared to place the result of any\r\n\r\nsuch investigation into his complaint before this House, or\r\n\r\notherwise make it public. I think it is important that in the\r\n\r\nprocess of wanting to score political points, one should not\r\n\r\nspread a big smear that scholarships, appointments to the State,\r\n\r\nthe whole works is just one bag of tricks meant to patronise\r\n\r\nfriends, supporters, carpet-baggers. If the State is to survive,\r\n\r\nit must stand strict scrutiny. If the democratic system of one\r\n\r\nman one vote and open criticism is to survive, it must withstand\r\n\r\ncriticism such as has been made in a veiled and vague manner by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Jurong and the Member for Jalan Kayu. I say: make\r\n\r\nyour specific charges, list them, and we will investigate them\r\n\r\nand place the results before this Assembly. But I say this, that\r\n\r\nfirst we accept the position that nobody is entitled as of right\r\n\r\nto ask, if the State helps him, to dismantle the democratic\r\n\r\nsystem.

The so-called Intelligence\r\n\r\ninvestigation should be revealed in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now want to talk about bursaries. At the present moment, the\r\n\r\npayment of bursaries in the State is intended to help poor\r\n\r\nstudents to pursue higher education. But this aid does not exist\r\n\r\nany more because the payment of bursaries has become a tool of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. The administration of bursaries is virtually under the\r\n\r\ncontrol of the P.A.P. so that the disciples of the P.A.P. and\r\n\r\ntheir supporters may be gathered together to help them during the\r\n\r\nelections and to contribute to the Party funds. If you want to\r\n\r\nget this bursary, then you must toe the line of the P.A.P. This\r\n\r\nis the present situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister says that these bursaries are not given casually\r\n\r\nbut are given according to certain rules, and to the financial \r\n\r\ncircumstances of the applicants. If this is so, then it\r\n\r\nis strange that when an undergraduate, who is considered poor and\r\n\r\nreceives a bursary for the first, second and third years, and in\r\n\r\nthe fourth year - when he is still poor - he is all of a sudden\r\n\r\nrecalled. Does it mean that all of a sudden his family has become\r\n\r\nso well off that he does not deserve any more help? This is\r\n\r\nstrange. This is done according to the Intelligence given by the\r\n\r\nSpecial Branch which is virtually under the control of the\r\n\r\nBritish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that at the present moment those recipients of\r\n\r\nbursaries are under certain restrictions. They run the risk of\r\n\r\nhaving their bursaries withdrawn. If they cannot afford to go on\r\n\r\nwithout bursaries, they have to work part-time in order to carry\r\n\r\non their studies. They cannot enjoy life so comfortably as the\r\n\r\nMinisters can. And if the students refuse to be suppressed by the\r\n\r\nGovernment, then they have to work extra hard to earn money to\r\n\r\nfinance their studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is now extensively suppressing the students. In\r\n\r\nthe past few\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears, we have seen that many students and graduates have been\r\n\r\nunable to get jobs from the Government. The Government is not in\r\n\r\nany position to give them jobs - particularly to Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity graduates. I who have been a Nantah student know that\r\n\r\nthere were many recipients of bursaries, hut now the number has\r\n\r\nbeen reduced in spite of the fact that many of them are deserving\r\n\r\nof bursaries. Some graduates who have passed out are unemployed.\r\n\r\nSo the granting of bursaries is a means by which the Government\r\n\r\ntries to oppress tbe Nanyang under-graduates and graduates. Those\r\n\r\nwho have passed out are unable to get jobs and tbe Government is\r\n\r\nnot giving them any help; no outlet is provided for them. I who\r\n\r\nhave been a recipient of some aid from the\r\n\r\nGovernment - [Interruption]. I who have been a recipient of some aid from \r\n\r\nthe Government, together with other recipients of bursaries, know\r\n\r\nthat we have not been accepted into the public service. I myself\r\n\r\nhave not been taken into the Government. On the other hand, we\r\n\r\nsee that the Deputy Prime Minister is a teacher and a Member of\r\n\r\nthe Assembly at the same time. The P.S.C. has made a ruling that\r\n\r\nteachers of government-aided schools cannot undertake any extra\r\n\r\nwork. The ruling is that extra-mural activities should be\r\n\r\ncontrolled. This adversely affects the under-graduates because if\r\n\r\nthey want to do anything outside their studies, they will be\r\n\r\ninterfered with by the Government: there will be a lot of\r\n\r\nrestrictions on their behaviour. When they are dissatisfied with\r\n\r\nthe Government, they run the risk of losing their bursaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulations governing the granting of bursaries are\r\n\r\nunreasonable. When the under-graduates discover this fact, they\r\n\r\nair their grievances before the Minister for Education. Certain\r\n\r\nclaims are made to revise the existing regulations, but in spite\r\n\r\nof repeated requests and discussions, the Government refuses to\r\n\r\nrevise them. So the students have no alternative but to accept\r\n\r\nthese stringent regulations. These regulations have been used by\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government to oppress the undergraduates of Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. want recipients of bursaries to\r\n\r\ngive information on others who have acted or said anything\r\n\r\nagainst them.

Mr Speaker, Sir, it\r\n\r\nis quite different. The University is an autonomous body; it is\r\n\r\nnot a Government institution. The Deputy Prime Minister asked\r\n\r\nthat he be allowed to continue the direction of scholars whose\r\n\r\nresearch he was supervising and to give his lectures to keep his\r\n\r\nknowledge up to date. The Member for Tampines is asking for a\r\n\r\nGovernment appointment and it is against the Constitution for a\r\n\r\nGovernment servant to be a Member of the Assembly or vice versa.\r\n\r\nIf we allow him to become a member of the public service, we will\r\n\r\nbe doing him a disservice, because automatically he will be\r\n\r\ndisqualified from sitting in this Chamber and then he will say\r\n\r\nwhat a lot of wicked people we are for disqualifying him.

And worse if he graduates, not only does\r\n\r\nhe not get a job in the Government, but the Government will see\r\n\r\nthat he does not get a job at all. Here, Mr Speaker, Sir, we\r\n\r\nallow a great deal of latitude. All that we are saying is that a\r\n\r\nperson who is deemed on security assessment - not on the basis of\r\n\r\njust the Government's likes and dislikes - to be a security risk\r\n\r\nis not put into a sensitive Government job. But we leave it free\r\n\r\nto him to seek other avenues of employment in private enterprise,\r\n\r\na private firm or even to launch into private enterprise, and if\r\n\r\nhe is any good he will make the grade. But it is not the business\r\n\r\nof the Government, having given a man a bursary, he having failed\r\n\r\nto make the grade, to give him a job in order that he will be disqualified\r\n\r\nfrom this Assembly.

He would not have\r\n\r\nbeen so stubborn by saying that this has nothing to do with the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government but is the concern of the Ministry of\r\n\r\nExternal Affairs. This shows that the Government has made use of\r\n\r\nthe granting of bursaries to persecute certain students who do\r\n\r\nnot hold the same views as the P.A.P. The Government has made use\r\n\r\nof bursaries to carry out political patronage. The Prime Minister\r\n\r\ngave reasons saying that the Government does not want to deal\r\n\r\nwith those who are against it but with those who are against the\r\n\r\ncountry and nation. Those who are against the P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nclassified as those against the democratic system and as \r\n\r\nanti-nationals.

Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Fully as this House is interested in Mr Poh\r\n\r\nBer Liak, from now I think we should stop discussing his case and\r\n\r\ncome back to the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the bursaries\r\n\r\nare awarded by the Government for the training of talent. This is\r\n\r\na kind of investment. We all know that in order to reap a good\r\n\r\nharvest from the investment, we should make a good selection so\r\n\r\nthat those selected will be put to proper use. The bursaries come\r\n\r\nfrom public money. Other friendly countries have also donated\r\n\r\ntowards this purpose. Therefore, we must make proper use of the\r\n\r\nbursaries to train suitable persons to serve our country in order\r\n\r\nto achieve a more just and equal society. As to how to allocate\r\n\r\nbursaries and to whom, it is the decision of the Public Service\r\n\r\nCommission, so that in the end we may have the services of the\r\n\r\ncandidates concerned. With regard to the granting of bursaries, I\r\n\r\nthink it is only right and proper that the criterion should be\r\n\r\nthe academic and other merits of the applicants concerned. Only\r\n\r\nthen will they benefit from the bursaries. If there are\r\n\r\ninefficient students who failed their examinations, such as the\r\n\r\nMember for Tampines, then it will be a waste of money to award\r\n\r\nbursaries; and naturally\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey should have their bursaries revoked. On the other hand, we\r\n\r\nshould pay attention to whether the candidates, politically\r\n\r\nspeaking, are a risk to the security of our State, because we\r\n\r\ncannot use public funds to train political subversives\r\n\r\ndetrimental to our own State. Therefore, every government will\r\n\r\nsee to it that those who apply for bursaries arc at least loyal\r\n\r\nto the State. We cannot use public funds to train students to\r\n\r\ncarry out anti-national activities. After we have trained such\r\n\r\nstudents, the knowledge they have acquired and the technique and\r\n\r\nthe know-how they have attained will not in the end be used by\r\n\r\nthem to build our nation because they are by nature anti-national\r\n\r\nand antisocial. How can they use their knowledge and the know-how\r\n\r\nthey have acquired to serve their country? Therefore, a\r\n\r\ndemocratic country has the right to protect itself. If there are\r\n\r\nstudents who make use of funds given by the Government to undergo\r\n\r\na course of study and who resort to activities detrimental to the\r\n\r\nsecurity of the State, then I feel that the Government has every\r\n\r\nright to revoke such bursaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.

Is it their\r\n\r\nintention to term the candidates for bursaries as tools or\r\n\r\nmachinery? Perhaps they want the products of bursaries to be\r\n\r\nbranded as made by the P.A.P. They claim that the purpose of\r\n\r\nawarding bursaries is to train people to serve the country. They\r\n\r\nclaim that those persons whose bursaries have been cancelled have\r\n\r\nbeen engaged in anti-national activities. But so far, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave not been able to prove this.

The security assessment made is part of an assessment\r\n\r\ncompletely unconnected with the likes and dislikes of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nWhether a man is for or against any democratic political Party is\r\n\r\nirrelevant.

In other words, is there no\r\n\r\navailable local talent among the existing serving officers who\r\n\r\ncan do better than the present holder of this post, namely, the\r\n\r\nDirector of the C.P.I.B.?

I can inform\r\n\r\nthe Member for Thomson that quite a number of his comrades have\r\n\r\ngiven me eloquent testimony of the efficiency of this officer,\r\n\r\nincluding Mr James Puthucheary, Mr Sandra Wood-hull and a few\r\n\r\nothers who are considered heroes of the united front\r\n\r\norganisation. I am not suggesting that there are no local\r\n\r\nofficers more able or less competent to discharge these\r\n\r\nresponsibilities. The problem now is to get somebody there to\r\n\r\ncarry on the work; one who brings to this job a wealth of\r\n\r\nexperience. Unfortunately, this officer's service will end in\r\n\r\n1965, and it is my intention, if there are no local officers by\r\n\r\nthen fully trained to take over this job, to extend his contract.\r\n\r\nWe have gone over this phase of just chasing the white man out.\r\n\r\nHe is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere as our servant to investigate corrupt practices.

There are several big jobs open - General Manager,\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board, Dockyard Manager, General Manager,\r\n\r\nP.U.B. These jobs are being occupied at the moment by local men\r\n\r\nwithout the adequate expertise.

If we allow this post to be held by an\r\n\r\nexpatriate officer - particularly one who has worked for the\r\n\r\nBritish to suppress and exploit our own people - to control this\r\n\r\norganisation, and if it is discovered that some of the officers\r\n\r\nare corrupted, then this man can make use of his powers as\r\n\r\nDirector to continue serving the British colonialists. Let us\r\n\r\nassume that one Minister in the Cabinet is involved in irregular\r\n\r\nactivities. Then this Director will make use of this weakness to\r\n\r\nturn him into a local agent for the British. This is inevitable,\r\n\r\nbecause the British want their bases to remain in Malaya, and\r\n\r\nthey may want to make use of some of our people to be their\r\n\r\nagents. So I suggest that it would be more proper for a local\r\n\r\nofficer to hold this post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, I would have thought that having\r\n\r\nshot the line that the PAP, misuses its governmental powers all\r\n\r\nto its own political party advantage,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhere is an expatriate official who is not likely to play\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. game and who is not going to charge a man with\r\n\r\ncorruption just because he happens to be anti-P.A.P., and we are\r\n\r\nbeing exhorted now to put in our own man. Where is the sense or\r\n\r\nlogic of all this? It is suggested that an expatriate officer in\r\n\r\nthat position would exploit his authority to get a lot of\r\n\r\ninformers going. I do not know how tortuous people's minds can\r\n\r\nbecome. I can assure the Member for Thomson that the job of the\r\n\r\nC.P.I.B. is to investigate and be vigilant against corrupt\r\n\r\npractices in Singapore in all public departments. As you can see\r\n\r\nfrom the realignment of this job from the Prime Minister's Head\r\n\r\nto the State Advocate-General's Chain-hers Head, his instructions\r\n\r\nnow come from the State Advocate-General. It is an indication of\r\n\r\nthe way in which this Bureau is being made completely \r\n\r\nnon-political and divorced from the administration. The Director\r\n\r\ncarries out his own investigations, and whatever evidence he has,\r\n\r\ngoes direct to the State Advocate-General who commences\r\n\r\nprosecution. I will be quite happy to appoint a local officer\r\n\r\nwhen this officer's service expires at the end of 1965, if we\r\n\r\nhave a local officer by then who has developed a skill for\r\n\r\npainstakingly tracking down corrupt elements. It is the same\r\n\r\ntechnique - I am sorry to say, Sir - that is required in\r\n\r\npainstakingly tracking down subversive elements without their\r\n\r\nknowing that they are being tracked down until it is too late for\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has said that the Director of the C.P.I.B. is a very\r\n\r\ncapable and talented person, and he knows what he is doing.

In other words, if a\r\n\r\nlocal officer were to hold this post, then, from this logic, I am\r\n\r\nafraid that there would be more cases of corrupt practices\r\n\r\nbecause a local officer would not be so talented and capable.\r\n\r\nThis question then arises: since this officer is so capable and\r\n\r\ntalented as he has been held out to be, how is it that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe provision for this year is only $250,000-odd and that for\r\n\r\nnext year it is $800,000-odd?

There are things which\r\n\r\nthe people do not know but which the Prime Minister promises to\r\n\r\ndo. As a result, the people of Singapore suffer. For example, on\r\n\r\nMalaysia, our Prime Minister repeatedly told the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore over the radio, television, the newspapers, and through\r\n\r\nall media of publicity machinery in order to carry out propaganda\r\n\r\nabout the good points of Malaysia, that if Malaysia should come\r\n\r\ntrue, then Singapore would become a paradise, the New York of\r\n\r\nMalaysia, happiness for all, and prosperity for everyone. These\r\n\r\nare very beautiful words used by the Prime Minister in the past\r\n\r\nduring his constituency tours. What happens now, and what is the\r\n\r\nsituation? Malaysia has come about and what happens to the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore? What about their livelihood? It is a fact that\r\n\r\nthere are difficulties, misery and unemployment all round.

As an anti-colonial Party, we oppose the\r\n\r\nBritish and the Alliance for their behaviour. But the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister did not do this. On the contrary, in open defence of the\r\n\r\nBritish colonialists in this Chamber, he said that it was the\r\n\r\nBritish who are protecting the people of Malaysia; it is we who\r\n\r\n(10 not want war. This is a House of the representatives of the people. \r\n\r\nThis is not the House of Commons of the British. We are elected by \r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore, and we have some Members speaking in defence\r\n\r\nof British interests. This is the usual practice of the Prime Minister. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore. Mr Speaker, if you will remember, last year\r\n\r\nwhen we were debating the policy statement of the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara, we gave our solutions to confrontation, and our views on\r\n\r\nthe dispute and relations between Singapore and the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment, how the position of Singapore should be safeguarded,\r\n\r\nand how the difficulties should be resolved in Singapore. At that\r\n\r\ntime, the Prime Minister said boisterously, blowing his own\r\n\r\ntrumpet, that the confrontation problem would be solved in three\r\n\r\nmonths. After three months Indonesia would not be able to with\r\n\r\nstand the results of confrontation. But what happens now, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker? All those words uttered by the Prime Minister show that\r\n\r\nhe simply made wild promises to the people, of doing things they\r\n\r\ncould not do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Member please\r\n\r\nquote the source which reported me as saying all this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

This is another instance to show that\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister is good at making empty promises. I would like\r\n\r\nto advise him that, as the Head of State in Singapore, he should\r\n\r\nbe more careful in what he says.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

I am sure in\r\n\r\nthe debate on the Budget in the Federal Parliament, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Paya Lebar, who is a Member, can take the Prime Minister of\r\n\r\nMalaysia to task and tell him how he should resolve\r\n\r\nconfrontation, it is no use picking up these things with me here.\r\n\r\nIf he is a fierce fighter for freedom, unafraid of the perils\r\n\r\nthat fall upon revolutionary fighters who go along with the Com\r\n\r\nmunists, then I ask him to table a similar motion to reduce the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister of Malaysia's salary by $10. Be a brave man. Do\r\n\r\nhis duties in Parliament, as we intend to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now from the sublime to the road in Paya Lebar. Lim Teck\r\n\r\nBoo? I need notice of this, Mr Speaker, Sir. There are a few\r\n\r\nthousand roads which have been repaired or otherwise improved\r\n\r\nthroughout Singapore. I can assure the Member for Paya Lebar\r\n\r\nthat,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndespite the misfortune of the people in Paya Lebar to have him as\r\n\r\ntheir representative, nevertheless, we shall maintain the road.\r\n\r\nBut if I guess rightly what the Member meant, it means that the\r\n\r\npeople, the frontagers, the owners of land whose roads are made\r\n\r\nup as frontages, they have been served under the Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance with notice to show cause why they should not pay a\r\n\r\ncertain sum of money to make up that road. Is that what he\r\n\r\nintended'? He said they had to pay for it. .1 have got the data\r\n\r\nhere how the administration works in the office. Now with peace\r\n\r\nand stability there is no need to go around chasing shadows\r\n\r\ncaused by the united front. Even with regard to a road in Paya\r\n\r\nLebar, can dig tip the information for him. A twelve-foot wide\r\n\r\n200 feet long road with metalling costs $17,200. According to\r\n\r\nthe law, the frontagers must pay for it. They must share this\r\n\r\ncost, because by making the road the price of the land\r\n\r\nimmediately goes up. He is not suggesting that I should help his\r\n\r\ncapitalist supporters in the area, using public money, $17,000,\r\n\r\nto improve the price of the land and not collect it from the \r\n\r\nland-owners. I thought he is on the side of the depressed masses, the\r\n\r\npoor unemployed, the hawkers, the farmers, the pasar malam\r\n\r\npeople. He must always try to compete with the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nhim. He never forgets in his speech the poor trishaw riders, the\r\n\r\npoor hawkers, the poor redhatted women in his constituency. The\r\n\r\nMember for Paya Lebar, instead of standing up for all these poor\r\n\r\npeople, is standing up for a few bloated landlords, land-owners\r\n\r\nin Lim Teck Boo Road. I am not oppressing the poor tenants. The\r\n\r\nowners of land have got to pay. The price of their land goes up\r\n\r\nwhen the road is made, 12 feet wide.

My further\r\n\r\ninformation on this is that none of the residents of Lim Teck Boo\r\n\r\nRoad are made to pay for anything. If there is any payment to be\r\n\r\nmade, it is to be made by the landowner, not by the residents.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened, I am told, is that since the road has been\r\n\r\nmade up, there have been some potholes. Perhaps the residents may\r\n\r\nhave taken upon themselves the job of repairing the road. Well,\r\n\r\ngood luck to them. I have no recollection of going around\r\n\r\npromising to repair public roads for nothing. Roads will be\r\n\r\nrepaired. It is the business of the Government. If under the law\r\n\r\nland-owners have to pay for improvement on their frontage, the\r\n\r\nlaw will be applied. But we do not make the tenants or the\r\n\r\nresidents pay. There is no law to enforce that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Tampines, let me say to him that I do\r\n\r\nnot desire to prevent discussion in this Chamber of the problems\r\n\r\narising out of confrontation.

But\r\n\r\nspecific items such as the representation of Malaysia at the \r\n\r\nAfro-Asian non-aligned nations conference in Cairo are not within my\r\n\r\ndispensation. If it were, we would have done something about it.\r\n\r\nIt is a responsibility which we would have discharged\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin our own way.

What the Member for Paya Lebar has to say, what the Mem\r\n\r\nber for Tampines has to say, can be said in the Central\r\n\r\nParliament. Why did Malaysia not have a representative in Cairo?\r\n\r\nLet them explain. I am in full agreement that we should have. But\r\n\r\nperhaps there were valid reasons why Malaysia's representation\r\n\r\nwas not possible. I cannot answer. It is not for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the broader issues of how to resolve confrontation, I\r\n\r\nsay, let us have more constructive proposals than just harking\r\n\r\nback to neo-colonialism and the dissolution of Malaysia. How do\r\n\r\nwe resolve confrontation and survive? That is the nub of the\r\n\r\nmatter. I told Members yesterday that the Indonesians have held\r\n\r\nout this bait to us. They will resume trade if we back out from\r\n\r\nMalaysia. I say calculate. Tell me now whether that is a good\r\n\r\nthing. Calculate. Let the people of Singapore hear their views on\r\n\r\nthat.

In the end, the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives on the committee also broadcast over the radio. I\r\n\r\nmyself was present. Many people went there to see, because they\r\n\r\nwere also concerned about the incident. The representative of the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister arrogantly told the gathering that the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister had ordered him to go there to organise a good will\r\n\r\ncommittee. Although this is not too important and the attitude of\r\n\r\nthis person is not something we can praise, the arrogant\r\n\r\nutterances made by him saddened me. I felt that people would not\r\n\r\nbe taken in his such words. The Prime Minister sent a\r\n\r\nrepresentative there.

I\r\n\r\nonly wanted to point out that the Prime Minister should be more\r\n\r\ncareful when sending any representative to act on his behalf. Of\r\n\r\ncourse, I quite understand that any person sent will be acting\r\n\r\nlike his tail. But the actions of such a person invariably cause\r\n\r\nanger among the people, and in the end make the goodwill\r\n\r\ncommittee useless.

He says that the people of\r\n\r\nMalaysia would bring about Malaysia. But I agree with the Member\r\n\r\nfor Paya Lebar that the Prime Minister has made various mistakes,\r\n\r\nbecause he is making use of propaganda to create a smokescreen to\r\n\r\nbamboozle the people, whether locally or not. There had been\r\n\r\ninformation and talk about the consequences of Malaysia. He\r\n\r\nclaimed that after Malaysia there would he happiness and\r\n\r\nprosperity and everybody would benefit. That was what he said\r\n\r\nbefore Malaysia. But now he has changed his tune. He is trying to\r\n\r\ndeceive the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Malaysia, he said that the people of Singapore would be\r\n\r\nprosperous and would benefit. But now he has again given the\r\n\r\npromise that after a few more years Malaysia would bring more\r\n\r\nbenefits, perhaps 20 or 30 years thereafter. Only after such a\r\n\r\nperiod can we see such results. Even before merger the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister had said that Malaysia would bring prosperity to us. Now\r\n\r\nhe is not sure of himself. Now he is assuring the people that\r\n\r\nsuch promises could only be realised many years hereafter, 10 to\r\n\r\n20 years. If he was not sure of himself, if he himself was\r\n\r\ndoubtful, then he should not have made such utterances. This also\r\n\r\nshows that Malaysia in the end will bring disaster to the people.\r\n\r\nTheir sufferings will be more than what they are enduring at the\r\n\r\nmoment. Therefore, the Prime Minister, as head of the Government,\r\n\r\nshould think in terms of the future of the people and not in\r\n\r\nterms of his personal selfish interests and ignore the future of\r\n\r\nthe people. The mere use of deceitful words will not be absorbed\r\n\r\nby the people forever. The sum of $42,000 under this vote should\r\n\r\nbe worth its while, and he should not make use of empty promises\r\n\r\nto fool the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if my responsibilities\r\n\r\ncould be measured only by the salary I am paid, I think I could\r\n\r\nfind much more congenial pursuits besides having to discharge the\r\n\r\nduties of my office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest to Members opposite that a lot of useful thinking and\r\n\r\nformulation of public opinion can be done if they begin to think\r\n\r\nforward. Where do we go from here'? Not \"Malaysia is a neo\r\n\r\ncolonialist plot\", \"Look at it, it has brought us misery and\r\n\r\nconfrontation\". When Malaysia was formed, nobody had the right to\r\n\r\nprevent its formation if we decided to get together. We did it in\r\n\r\nour best interests. We argued it for two solid years before it\r\n\r\nwas formed. The day after its formation, the Indonesians mounted\r\n\r\nan economic boycott, and severed diplomatic relations. Now one\r\n\r\nyear after its advent, they have sent, not just into Sabah and\r\n\r\nSarawak, which they can say is disputable territory, but into\r\n\r\nMalaya and into Singapore, saboteurs \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand guerrillas. Where do we go from here? The people are\r\n\r\nnot interested in harking back to this refrain, for the good old\r\n\r\ndays when we were making money out of the Indonesians - 20 per\r\n\r\ncent of our entrepot trade. Where do we go from here? I said to\r\n\r\nthe Member for Jalan Kayu yesterday - he was not in the Chamber\r\n\r\nperhaps - that the Indonesians have held Out to us this\r\n\r\nexpectation, this hope, this inducement - \"Break out from\r\n\r\nMalaysia and we will resume trade.\" I say, calculate publicly now\r\n\r\nand tell this House and the country why they think this is a good\r\n\r\nidea. Let me hear the arguments that it is, in fact, a good idea,\r\n\r\nand that to opt out and resume trade with the Indonesians is in\r\n\r\nthe interests of the people of Singapore. Then I say it may well\r\n\r\nbe that Members opposite can persuade the people of Singapore to\r\n\r\nfollow them. But let us hear the arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest to Members opposite that the mood of the country\r\n\r\nhas undergone a cataclysmic change. Before, just shouting slogans\r\n\r\nand holding mass rallies for or against Malaysia was a form of\r\n\r\npolitical exercise. Now the people understand that this is a\r\n\r\nmatter of life and death. So far as the Indonesians are\r\n\r\nconcerned, what they want is Malaysia`s death and our absorption\r\n\r\nunder their aegis, under their hegemony. I am quite sure Members\r\n\r\nopposite know that the people do not want that. I do not know\r\n\r\nwhat they themselves want. But how do we avoid that and still\r\n\r\nsurvive as a viable entity? I say our best chances are in\r\n\r\nMalaysia. I said yesterday that the ideal paradise was full trade\r\n\r\nwith Indonesia, full trade with Malaya, plus a common market,\r\n\r\nplus industrialisation, which would have happened had the\r\n\r\nIndonesians not mounted their confrontation. Two years more of\r\n\r\ncommon market without confrontation and we would have been up. We\r\n\r\nhad reasons on which we could base our expectations of Malaysia\r\n\r\nbringing us stability and progress. But on the 1st May, 1963,\r\n\r\nIndonesia got back West Irian, and she was ready to make her next\r\n\r\nmove in South-East Asia. The people know that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do we go from here? Out of Malaysia?

The l0\ufffd million people, nearly 11 million people, have\r\n\r\na chance, if they are fair to one another, to build a viable\r\n\r\nsociety that can withstand the pressure of 103 million people. I\r\n\r\nread in the newspapers that the President of Indonesia represents\r\n\r\n105 million people now, and the number will grow bigger and\r\n\r\nbigger year by year. And can they watch Singapore flourish all by\r\n\r\nitself? They are not even happy to see Malaysia flourish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do the Barisan stand? They are against Malaysia, just\r\n\r\nlike the Indonesians. They are also against Malaysia flourishing,\r\n\r\nbecause they are against Malaysia to begin with.

In the past, the P.A.P. Ministers and\r\n\r\neven the junior officials, stressed the importance of our\r\n\r\nrelationship with Indonesia. Subsequently, because of the desire\r\n\r\nof the Alliance Government for merger and the formation of\r\n\r\nMalaysia, the P.A.P. collaborated with the British Government and\r\n\r\nthey are now hostile towards Indonesia. Now we hear these people\r\n\r\nbelittling Indonesia by saying that its people are living on rats\r\n\r\nand corn. Because of the severance of trade, they say that\r\n\r\nIndonesian rubber has been piling up along its ports. The\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has taunted the Indonesians by asking how\r\n\r\nlong they could continue with their confrontation. He seems to\r\n\r\nthink that if the piled-up rubber can be sold, only then can the\r\n\r\nIndonesian people prosper and not be hungry any more. Such has\r\n\r\nbeen their tune since Malaysia. They say that we are \r\n\r\nanti-national. Why? I do not understand their charge. But, strange to\r\n\r\nsay, in this Budget the Government is still providing token votes\r\n\r\nfor such expenditure.

Does this not show a\r\n\r\ncontradiction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the P.A.P.? People would think they are hoping that one day\r\n\r\nthey may resume trade and cultural relationships with Indonesia.\r\n\r\nSince such resumption is impossible, because they themselves have\r\n\r\nbrought about the present situation, we wonder why they are still\r\n\r\nanticipating such a resumption of trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has stressed the severance of trade between\r\n\r\nIndonesia and Singapore and has given the people the impression \r\n\r\nthat Indonesia had intended to sever such trade even\r\n\r\nbefore Malaysia was formed - even in 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something the people have never heard of since the\r\n\r\nformation of Malaysia for about one year. Because of their losses\r\n\r\nin trade, the conditions of living of the people have been\r\n\r\ndeteriorating. The people feel that hoping for things which\r\n\r\ncannot materialise is not a practical way of doing things. They\r\n\r\nhave therefore tightened their belts. I feel that what the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has said about Indonesia's intention to sever trade with\r\n\r\nSingapore has been entirely his own concoction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The token vote provided here shows that the P.A.P. are\r\n\r\npreparing for an exit for themselves in anticipation of the day\r\n\r\nwhen they cannot persist further with the Malaysia plant then\r\n\r\nthey can find a way out. Because the Prime Minister has no\r\n\r\nconfidence in Malaysia, trade between Indonesia and Singapore has\r\n\r\nnow been severed, and Singapore is faced with confrontation. The\r\n\r\nPrime Minister in the past has claimed that within three months\r\n\r\nhe could resolve the problem of confrontation. But now after one\r\n\r\nyear, when they are meeting with difficulties, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nclaims that he can resolve it in two years. Now it is no longer\r\n\r\nthree months. It is now eight times three months. Perhaps after\r\n\r\ntwo more years, when the situation gets worse, he says perhaps in\r\n\r\nfive years he can resolve the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also claimed that Indonesia has sent feelers to him\r\n\r\nto resume trade and other relations. Perhaps he is banking on the\r\n\r\nhope that something may turn up in the future, and that is why\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe is providing the token vote as a feeler from Singapore to\r\n\r\nIndonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, I find it a very tedious\r\n\r\nbusiness going back over the whole argument. The position is\r\n\r\nquite simple. There is no contradiction between putting the token\r\n\r\nvote for our Trade Representative in Jakarta and our position \r\n\r\nvis-a-vis Indonesia. The Russians know that the Americans do not love\r\n\r\nthem, and yet they keep an Embassy in America and they trade with\r\n\r\nthe Americans. They even bought American grains when their own\r\n\r\ncrops failed. One day - it is not impossible - the Indonesians may\r\n\r\nunderstand that we are not so easily digested and absorbed, and\r\n\r\nthey may learn how to live with us. And if they live with us, it\r\n\r\nis not unlikely that we should, in the nature of the geography of\r\n\r\nSouth-East Asia, once more have trade and other relations with\r\n\r\neach other. This is a token vote. It does not mean that we do not\r\n\r\nknow what their present leaders want to do to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years Mr Speaker, Sir, we have watched their\r\n\r\nactivities here with considerable interest. Whilst we were making\r\n\r\nalternative arrangements how we should live in the eventuality\r\n\r\nthat has transpired a little earlier than we had expected - a\r\n\r\ncomplete cut-off of all trade lines with Singapore; if we do not\r\n\r\nshow that capacity to survive, then this will go on until we are\r\n\r\nabsorbed. If we do show that capacity, it is not unlikely that\r\n\r\nthey will just have to learn how to live with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I find it tedious to have to deny things\r\n\r\nput into my mouth.

Produce the documents.\r\n\r\n[Interruption] When did I say that? My assessment of the position\r\n\r\nhas been made on many an occasion, that I think it will go on for\r\n\r\nas long as they believe we can be absorbed, we can be broken.\r\n\r\nThey will stop: there will probably be a change of tactics, a\r\n\r\nchange of technique, the moment they find it no longer profitable\r\n\r\nto go on doing this. When that will be, I do not know. It might\r\n\r\nhappen in the course of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1965. Hence the token vote. But whatever it is, I do hope Members\r\n\r\nopposite will become more sophisticated. We do not have to love\r\n\r\neach other in this world to do business with each other. The\r\n\r\nChinese People's Government do not love the British, but there is\r\n\r\na British trade exhibition going on in Peking, and business is\r\n\r\nbeing transacted. Similarly we do not have to be falling over our\r\n\r\nselves over the Indonesians, nor do we expect them to hold us in\r\n\r\nhigh esteem. All we need do is to respect each other's integrity\r\n\r\nand trade with each other. And if it comes about again, we should\r\n\r\nbe ready to re-open those avenues of contact between them and us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister was replying to this question, he was putting himself\r\n\r\ninto a vortex of conflicts. He was quite inconsistent. He said in\r\n\r\nthe last two days that it was difficult for Singapore to maintain\r\n\r\ntrade relationship for a long time because Indonesia had\r\n\r\nintentions to sever such trade and to establish its own free port\r\n\r\nto export directly and buy directly. So we cannot depend too much\r\n\r\non Indonesia. That being so, we must have Malaysia. This was his\r\n\r\nargument. From this we can see that when Malaysia is met with di\r\n\r\nfficulties, he is trying to find excuses to cover up the\r\n\r\nintentions behind Malaysia. But today he says something\r\n\r\ndifferent. He says if we should go on like this, then there will\r\n\r\ncome a day when Indonesia will realise the necessity to live with\r\n\r\nus and to resume trade with us. This is very puzzling. On the one\r\n\r\nhand, he says that it is important for Indonesia to cut off trade\r\n\r\nwith us. Today he says there will come a day when Indonesia will\r\n\r\nrealise its dependency on Singapore on trade. So his arguments\r\n\r\nthat Singapore is entirely independent on others for a livelihood\r\n\r\ncannot hold water. He says we must cling to Malaysia for our\r\n\r\nsurvival. Then he says that Indonesia will realise the importance\r\n\r\nof trade with Singapore. From all these arguments one can see\r\n\r\nthat his past utterances were made to put Singapore into a\r\n\r\npathetic position in order to justify the formation of Malaysia.\r\n\r\nHis arguments were intended to create some imaginary embar\r\n\r\nrassment so as to make way for Malaysia. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActually Singapore has a very important place in trade. We\r\n\r\ncan survive on trade as we have done in the past, it does not\r\n\r\nmean that we have to depend on others for a livelihood. If that\r\n\r\nis so, it is equally important and clear that others will have to\r\n\r\ndepend on us for a livelihood. The dependency is mutual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said a moment ago that without Malaysia there\r\n\r\nwill be no way out for Singapore.

There is a Chinese proverb, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, which I think is rather appropriate. What they have\r\n\r\nbeen saying in the last two days might have been all right before\r\n\r\nMalaysia. As the Chinese proverb says, \"The sword has fallen\r\n\r\noverboard. They mark the place on the ship where the sword has\r\n\r\nfallen overboard. Then time passes and the ship moves on.

I will put the problems\r\n\r\nsimply to them and if they can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngive me their views, I think we will carry the argument one step\r\n\r\nforward. Now, the Indonesians have held out the expectation of\r\n\r\nresumed trade if we break Malaysia, if we come out. Never mind\r\n\r\nabout the interest of the people of Malaysia; let us be selfish\r\n\r\nand say let us consider the interest of the 1.8 million people of\r\n\r\nSingapore. Do they tell us now that that is a good thing? I would\r\n\r\nlike to hear that. Then we carry the argument forward. We have\r\n\r\nput this as a token vote, Mr Speaker, Sir; maybe in 1965\r\n\r\nsomething happens in Indonesia; they see the light; they want to\r\n\r\nresume trade; we resume trade. We do not have to love people to\r\n\r\ntrade with them. Or just because they want to eat us up but they\r\n\r\ncannot, it does not mean that we do not have to trade with them.\r\n\r\nIf they want, we trade. There is no contradiction between what we\r\n\r\nhave done here in putting in a token vote and the fact as I said\r\n\r\nyesterday, not two days ago (tsuo wan not chien hang tien), that\r\n\r\nearly in 1960, 1961, 1962, our man in Jakarta, on one occasion,\r\n\r\neven had an Indonesian document fall into his hands. What they\r\n\r\nplanned to do was to cut off the Singapore trade. Let us be quite\r\n\r\nhonest: they felt that they were being fleeced, being bled by the\r\n\r\nSingapore merchants. They did not get the hard currency: goods\r\n\r\nwere smuggled out according to their regulations because they had\r\n\r\nno export permits. They wanted to put their customs and police on\r\n\r\nour boats to check as they came in. We kept them in negotiations\r\n\r\nfor four years, while the trade went on. One of the reasons why\r\n\r\nwe had a balance of $400 million in the coffers was that the\r\n\r\ntrade went on. There were cultural exchanges and there were occa\r\n\r\nsions when one licence and Bills of Lading were used six or seven\r\n\r\ntimes to get six or seven consignments out of Indonesia. Cases\r\n\r\nwere mounted in our Courts, proceedings were held. And so it went\r\n\r\non. But life went on. But we knew what was at the back of their\r\n\r\nminds - to stop this trade with us. They must, on the one hand,\r\n\r\nhope for its continuance and, on the other hand, make\r\n\r\npreparations if it should be discontinued. Now it has been\r\n\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, we must be prepared to do without it and\r\n\r\nproceed on the basis of just industrialisation and what trade we\r\n\r\nhave with the rest of the world. On the other hand, it is not\r\n\r\nimpossible that there will be a change of circumstances in\r\n\r\nJakarta in which they may find it necessarily urgent to exchange\r\n\r\ngoods with us. They may need rice. People may get tired of eating\r\n\r\ncorn, I do not know. The situation may alter. If it does, here is\r\n\r\nthe vote; we do not have to come to the Assembly; we can act and\r\n\r\nthen ask for supplementary. That is all it means:\r\n\r\na little bit of political sophistication. And I say, let us save\r\n\r\nourselves a lot of argument. Where do we go from here? Not the\r\n\r\nold argument, whether there should have been a Malaysia or there\r\n\r\nshould not been a Malaysia. Members opposite will have another\r\n\r\nchance, Mr Speaker, Sir, unless they do something stupid between\r\n\r\nnow and 1968, when the whole Party may be scrubbed out. I do not\r\n\r\nknow. We do not want them scrubbed out. We will meet them again\r\n\r\nin 1968 and they can put their proposals on the future of\r\n\r\nSingapore to the people. As I have said, we are realists. The\r\n\r\narrangements we have made for Singapore in Malaysia, if worked\r\n\r\nout fairly and equitably, should see us through. If perchance\r\n\r\nthings do not go right, and they go wrong, and Singapore does go\r\n\r\nSouth, then I concede to them the possibility in that situation\r\n\r\nof Malaysia breaking off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain to them and do their calculations for them.\r\n\r\nThis is obvious. If anyone of the three new member States of\r\n\r\nMalaysia says. \"Out with Malaysia,\" then the Indonesian guerillas\r\n\r\nbecome like the Algerian liberation fighters. That means Malaysia\r\n\r\nhas had it. They can put this to the people in 1968 when the time\r\n\r\ncomes. If really Malaysia has brought misery, degradation,\r\n\r\nexploitation, subjection and oppression, they will get their\r\n\r\nvotes. Then every time there is a bomb exploding, it is no longer\r\n\r\nan Indonesian saboteur. That Indonesian saboteur becomes a\r\n\r\nvolunteer fighting for the freedom of the people who have been\r\n\r\nsubjected. These are on the cards. Our job is to make it succeed.\r\n\r\nTheir job is to bring the house down. We will see what happens in\r\n\r\n1968.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has spoken too much in order to cover up his present\r\n\r\nembarrassment. He says that the Members opposite condemn the\r\n\r\nresumption of trade with Indonesia. No, we have never made such a\r\n\r\ncondemnation. We only want to speak on this token vote in order\r\n\r\nto expose their irresponsibility. They try to split up the same\r\n\r\nmatter into different parts. On the one hand, they say how bad\r\n\r\nIndonesia is, and when we pin them down on the consequences of\r\n\r\nconfrontation, they turn round and say that it is useless to talk\r\n\r\non these lines, because it was the intention of Indonesia to cut\r\n\r\noff trade with us. But, on the other hand, they are prepared to\r\n\r\nresume trade. We do not want to condemn this action, but we are\r\n\r\ntrying to expose their inconsistency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has time and again shown that he is one step ahead\r\n\r\nof all the others when he explains the justification for this token vote.\r\n\r\nHe says that we must be prepared to show Indonesia that we have the \r\n\r\ncapacity to survive and then Indonesia will realise the importance of\r\n\r\ntrade with us. The people of Singapore are capable of surviving. There \r\n\r\nis no doubt about it. We have never said that the people of Singapore \r\n\r\nare not able to survive. If we do not have people like the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nperhaps we can survive better. The Prime Minister is always carry\r\n\r\ning out political intimidation. He says, \"You oppose Malaysia? If\r\n\r\nyou do, then you will discover that in the South you will have\r\n\r\nIndonesian confrontation and in the North you will have Malayan\r\n\r\nconfrontation.\" I do not know how he has based this calculation.\r\n\r\nHe speaks as though the people of Singapore have enemies\r\n\r\neverywhere. He has made a lot of very poor calculations. It is\r\n\r\nbecause of people like him who pushed through Malaysia that the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore are what they are. They are isolated. The\r\n\r\npeople over there make enemies for the people of Singapore. He\r\n\r\nhas raised one question, \"All right, let the Barisan tell us what\r\n\r\nwe should do about the future of Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us go back to the old controversy. There is no\r\n\r\ndifficulty about it. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquestion is: if you want to solve a problem, you have to find the\r\n\r\ncause of it. Now, where is the cause? The cause of the problem\r\n\r\nlies with Malaysia. This is known to everybody. We have said long\r\n\r\nago that Malaysia will deprive Singapore of its political rights,\r\n\r\nthat the people of Singapore will not have equal rights\r\n\r\npolitically. They have said in the past that we have autonomy in\r\n\r\nLabour and Education and so we are equal. We have equal rights in\r\n\r\ncitizenship, and political rights are not important. Autonomy in\r\n\r\nLabour and Education is more important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I am transgressing, Mr Speaker, but I have to give\r\n\r\nyou one example about the autonomy in Education. The students of\r\n\r\nSingapore have to apply to the Federation Government for permits\r\n\r\nbefore they can go for higher studies. This is the decision of\r\n\r\nthe Central Government and the people of Singapore have to\r\n\r\nfollow. There is no democracy but they say that we must not go\r\n\r\nbeyond the limit, in the morning they say something and in the\r\n\r\nafternoon they withdraw what they have said. This is what they\r\n\r\ncall autonomy in Education. Political rights are very important\r\n\r\nabove all things. Are the P.A.P. prepared to fight for equal poli\r\n\r\ntical rights? If it is, then we will support them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is, before Malaysia was formed, it was the\r\n\r\nBritish who had to pay for the soldiers. Now we have to pay for\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

That is, the Member for Paya Lebar since March 1964, and\r\n\r\nthree others, the Member for Jalan Kayu, the Member for Tampines\r\n\r\nand the Member for Choa Chu Kang. Three of them, together with\r\n\r\nthe Member for Bukit Panjang, wanted to employ their own friend,\r\n\r\none same gentleman, as their teacher. Unfortunately, the\r\n\r\ngentleman had not got the qualifications. He did not have a\r\n\r\ncertificate. So we offered to get them a properly qualified\r\n\r\nteacher.

What I would like is to pose two questions to the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister. The first one is this. When an Assemblyman wishes\r\n\r\nto employ a language teacher, what are the qualifications\r\n\r\nrequired of him? I would also like to know whether all language\r\n\r\nteachers employed have got the required qualifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am unable to give a list of all\r\n\r\nthe former tutors who have been paid out of this vote. But I can\r\n\r\nassure the Member for Bukit Panjang that all the tutors who are\r\n\r\nbeing paid out of this vote are considered qualified to teach the\r\n\r\nlanguage, either by the Ministry of Education or by the Public\r\n\r\nService Commission. Most of these language teachers in the old\r\n\r\ndays were qualified to teach the M.C.S., S.S.C.S. civil servants\r\n\r\nin Malay, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien and so on. There were\r\n\r\ncertain recognised teachers for this particular task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of this vote and multilingualism in this\r\n\r\nAssembly, a number of Assemblymen wanted to make use of this vote\r\n\r\nto learn English, which did not happen in the old days. In so far\r\n\r\nas the people who were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbrought in were already teaching that language in the\r\n\r\nschools, they are deemed qualified. In so far as they are not\r\n\r\nteaching that language in schools, they are deemed to be\r\n\r\nqualified if they can produce a certificate recognised by the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education as a person qualified in that particular\r\n\r\nlanguage or to teach that particular language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem arose in the case of the four Members I have\r\n\r\nmentioned the Member for Bukit Panjang, the Member for Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu, the Member for Tampines and the Member for Choa Chu Kang.\r\n\r\nThey wanted to overwork one poor friend. We allowed these things.\r\n\r\nBut when an obvious anomaly turned up, that is, when the teacher\r\n\r\nwas going to teach four friends, three hours a week, it would\r\n\r\nhave killed that poor friend of theirs. It occurred to us that\r\n\r\nthere must be a special reason why this person was so popular\r\n\r\nwith the four hon. Members of the Opposition. We thought it was\r\n\r\nnecessary to find out whether the person was properly qualified\r\n\r\nto teach in the language, and it turned out that he had no\r\n\r\nqualification other than the fact that he was their friend. We,\r\n\r\ntherefore, offered them a list of properly qualified teachers who\r\n\r\ncould discharge their duties, and there the matter rested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has said that only those who are teaching the language\r\n\r\nin schools are qualified to teach that language. He has also said\r\n\r\nthat in another category, only very rich friends are qualified to\r\n\r\nteach. Has he said that? If a teacher is teaching a particular\r\n\r\nlanguage in school, and if we ask him to teach us, then he is\r\n\r\nqualified. Is there a Member in the House who has employed a\r\n\r\nteacher who cannot speak and teach in that language? If what the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister has said is correct, then he is implying that the\r\n\r\nfour Assemblymen on this side, including myself, have done\r\n\r\nsomething improperly. I would like to ask him whether a person,\r\n\r\nbe be poor or rich, be he an enemy of the State, can be\r\n\r\nconsidered in such circumstances to have that qualification? Can\r\n\r\nthat be counted as a qualification?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am sorry that this mutual friend\r\n\r\nof the four hon. Members opposite who was considered unsuitable\r\n\r\nas a teacher under this scheme should have generated all this\r\n\r\nheat. If their desire is to learn the English language, then I do\r\n\r\nnot see what the problem is. There are a number of properly\r\n\r\nqualified teachers for this language. If they do not like any\r\n\r\nparticular person on that list, they can choose some other\r\n\r\nperson. But surely they cannot have the whole of the English\r\n\r\nteaching profession as their enemies. I am not suggesting that\r\n\r\nthey should choose an enemy to teach them. Of course, they want a\r\n\r\ncongenial companion. But I would suggest to Members opposite that\r\n\r\nwhen an official in my Ministry gets an application from four\r\n\r\nMembers choosing one person to teach all four of them English, it\r\n\r\ndoes seem a bit odd. First, they are overworking the poor man.\r\n\r\nHence our curiosity was aroused as to why they chose this\r\n\r\nparticular teacher, it turned out that he had no special\r\n\r\nqualification to teach the language other than the fact that he\r\n\r\nwas probably a good friend of theirs.

I feel that\r\n\r\nthe Government is the biggest landowner in Singapore. In many\r\n\r\nrespects, this big landowner is worse than the other landowners.\r\n\r\nThe first point is that the Government has taken\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nback some Crown land. But did it give the land to the farmers?\r\n\r\nNo. It gave the land to some merchants to wash sand, and such\r\n\r\nwork has affected the livelihood of farmers. Now what steps have\r\n\r\nthe Land Office taken to rectify this? This big landowner has\r\n\r\ndone nothing in this respect; it has not even paid a single cent\r\n\r\nof compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to raise is about building. If\r\n\r\none wishes to erect a building on Government land, great\r\n\r\ndifficulty is experienced. If one wants to build a pigsty, etc.,\r\n\r\nthe Government will normally refuse the application. In the case\r\n\r\nof pigs or chickens, this is all right, but people without land\r\n\r\ncannot live. If after a few years a family has increased by three\r\n\r\nor five members, then the Government should allow them to build\r\n\r\nan extension, otherwise they would not have any place to sleep.\r\n\r\nTake a private landowner, for instance. If only a sum of coffee\r\n\r\nmoney were to be paid, that would be sufficient in the case of\r\n\r\nprivate landowners: but the Government would not allow that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am astounded by the series of\r\n\r\ncompletely unfounded statements: first, that we have moved people\r\n\r\nout in order to give licences to private individuals to wash\r\n\r\nsand. I would like to have the data. Who have been moved out?\r\n\r\nFrom what land? And to whom have we given these licences? So far\r\n\r\nas I know the problem, in 1962 we decided that all the \r\n\r\nsand-washing operations that were being done were to be done by the\r\n\r\nWork Brigade. We gave employment to the Work Brigade. We saved\r\n\r\nmoney as a result of producing sand required for the construction\r\n\r\nwork of the Ministry of National Development and the Housing\r\n\r\nBoard. So I suggest that the Member for Bukit Panjang had better\r\n\r\nlist out all these allegations, and then we might go into them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he made this scurrilous allegation that you can get a\r\n\r\nlicence to extend your pigsty or chicken run or to extend your\r\n\r\nlittle attap hut if you give a bit of coffee money. Well, that is\r\n\r\nwhat the C.P.I.B. is supposed to look into, Mr Speaker, Sir. Now\r\n\r\nthat he has this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninformation, I suggest that he immediately go to the C.P.I.B. and\r\n\r\nthey will put the matter right. This is what we are here for: to\r\n\r\nsee that things are properly and well run. I should have thought\r\n\r\nthat in the licensing of these huts we have gone to great\r\n\r\nlengths. Everyone knows that land is in scarce supply in\r\n\r\nSingapore. And what starts off as a pigsty or a chicken run ends\r\n\r\nup as a house. Everybody knows that, in the rural areas, you\r\n\r\nstart off first by pretending that this is a pigsty. Then all\r\n\r\nbeing well, after a period of one year has elapsed, you move into\r\n\r\noccupation. And from then onwards, gradually a mansion is built\r\n\r\naround it. Therefore, in order to prevent the complete\r\n\r\n\"squatterisation\" of all our State land, we worked out certain\r\n\r\nfixed plans. A chicken run shall not be higher than a certain\r\n\r\nheight. It is good for chickens, more than ample space for\r\n\r\nchickens, but slightly uncomfortable for human beings to dwell\r\n\r\nin. So too with pigsties. I think it is a reasonable precaution,\r\n\r\nbecause every time the State allows buildings to be built on\r\n\r\nState land, it is at the same time undertaking the moral\r\n\r\nobligation of paying compensation when the time comes to ask the\r\n\r\nsquatter to move to make way for building projects for the State.\r\n\r\nWe do not do this for fun. These lands belong to the people, the\r\n\r\nGovernment. They are for clinics, hospitals, community centres,\r\n\r\nschools - all the things that a modern civilised society\r\n\r\nwants. Unfortunately, people have moved in for years. Where they\r\n\r\nare already in occupation, we do not want a proliferation of\r\n\r\nthese squatter huts, which has been taking place by way of the\r\n\r\npigsty and the chicken run. We have simplified the procedure and\r\n\r\nthere are four District Offices where the farmer can go and get a\r\n\r\nstandard plan free of charge showing what he need to do for a\r\n\r\npigsty or for a chicken run. He does that, and there is no\r\n\r\ntrouble. It is not that we want to make it difficult for them. We\r\n\r\ngo out of our way to make it difficult for the Government. We\r\n\r\nproduce a prototype plan - \"This is a first-class pigsty, cheap,\r\n\r\neconomical and practical, for pigs, not human beings.\" In that\r\n\r\nway when the time comes for that piece of land to be built upon - schools, clinics, community centres - we pay the compensation as\r\n\r\nfor a pigsty, and the pigs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill move with the farmer. If we do not do that, when the time\r\n\r\ncomes, we find that the farmer has acquired a very large family,\r\n\r\nwho in turn have themselves acquired large families, and all need\r\n\r\nto be rehoused. We gain nothing out of this, Mr Speaker, Sir,It\r\n\r\nis just an efficient, thrifty way of handling public money. The\r\n\r\nmore we allow squatters to go into State land, the more we will\r\n\r\nhave to pay to rehouse them. That is the problem. I would have\r\n\r\nthought that being socialist-minded chaps, they would all have\r\n\r\nbeen in favour of protecting the property of the State, of the\r\n\r\npeople. They suggest that we should allow their friends to go and\r\n\r\n\"squatter up\" the open spaces in Bukit Panjang with more huts in\r\n\r\norder that they could get more money out of the State when they\r\n\r\nare asked to move to make way for public buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister said that he was surprised to hear about the giving of\r\n\r\npermits to sand-washing operators.

He sought the Prime Minister's help in this\r\n\r\nmatter. After two years, nothing happened. In the end, a notice\r\n\r\nwas issued to reclaim the piece of land occupied by this\r\n\r\nparticular farmer. He was shocked.

It may be that there is sonic-thing going on\r\n\r\nbetween the farmers and him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual position is this. To allow a sand operator to dig sand on private land, a farmer Juts to hold a Temporary\r\n\r\nOccupation Licence. Subsequently, this particular farmer leases a\r\n\r\npart of his land to this sand operator at a high rental, and one\r\n\r\nof the sons of the farmer works under, or with the sand operator.\r\n\r\nThe Land Office comes to know about it. When part of the State\r\n\r\nland is being let out, the T.O.L. licence fee is increased,\r\n\r\nbecause of the change of use from farm land to sand operation.\r\n\r\nAnd the sand operator has met the licensee concerned asking the\r\n\r\nlicensee so that part of his land can be leased to the sand\r\n\r\noperator. He in turn writes to the Commissioner of I ands for\r\n\r\nthat particular piece of land. This is the true position, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the farmer is trying to do is to evade the actual\r\n\r\nlicence fee.

The Member\r\n\r\nraises this point without further investigation into the matter.\r\n\r\nWe are fully conscious that there is no farmer involved in \r\n\r\nsand-washing operations in Singapore.

The procedures by which\r\n\r\nacquisition of Singapore citizenship can be obtained are all\r\n\r\nrelated in Part III of the Constitution of the State of Singapore\r\n\r\nCitizenship and I think, Mr Speaker, it would be very tedious\r\n\r\nindeed for me to recite at length all the clauses under which\r\n\r\nsuch applications can be made. However, if the Member for Paya\r\n\r\nLebar so wishes, I can give him roughly the procedures by which\r\n\r\ncitizenship can be acquired. First, Singapore citizenship can be\r\n\r\nacquired by birth, by descent, by registration or enrolment, or\r\n\r\nunder the provisions of the Federal Constitution by\r\n\r\nnaturalisation. There are, of course, conditions relating to\r\n\r\nthese four different methods by which citizenship can be\r\n\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas replied to the effect that Singapore citizens are naturally\r\n\r\nMalaysian citizens. However, after the formation of Malaysia, we\r\n\r\ndiscovered that Singapore citizens enjoy a different status from\r\n\r\nthat of Malayan citizens. This is a fact. But the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister says that Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizens are naturally Malaysian citizens. If this is so, then\r\n\r\ndoes he not know the difference between the two kinds of\r\n\r\ncitizens, that Singapore citizens enjoy an inferior status\r\n\r\ncompared to Malayan citizens, because they have learned from\r\n\r\ntheir difficulties and experience that Singapore citizenship is\r\n\r\nnot as good as citizenship of the other States of Malaysia? This\r\n\r\nis a fact and cannot be denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister has also said that the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nif they want to apply for Singapore citizenship, have to follow the\r\n\r\nconditions laid down. Mr Speaker, as far as I know, there are many \r\n\r\npeople who apply for citizenship and they have to go through very \r\n\r\ndifficult and troublesome procedures. They have to wait for a long \r\n\r\ntime, one or two years, before their applications can be approved.\r\n\r\nThis is a fact. As a result, people shake their heads if they have\r\n\r\nto apply for citizenship in Singapore. Even if they qualify to become \r\n\r\nSingapore citizens, they feel that it is rather troublesome to apply \r\n\r\nthrough the official channel. It takes a long time, some two years. This is\r\n\r\nthe usual game that the Government is playing. I hope that the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister will pay attention to what I have to say.\r\n\r\nif there are cumbersome procedures, they should be simplified. If\r\n\r\nthey think that people in Singapore have the residential\r\n\r\nqualifications and their applications for citizenship deserve\r\n\r\napproval, then they should approve them in the shortest possible\r\n\r\ntime and do away with all the unnecessary troubles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other trouble; that is, if you have to apply\r\n\r\nfor citizenship, there will be an interview for you. This\r\n\r\ninterview is something like an interrogation to be carried out by\r\n\r\nSpecial Branch officers. I have a friend, a young man who. I\r\n\r\nthink, is a good man hut who may be considered to be a not so\r\n\r\ngood man, or an anti-national person, by the P.A.P. Now, this\r\n\r\nfriend of mine is against the P.A.P. to the very last. He applied\r\n\r\nfor citizenship but up to now - five years - he has not received\r\n\r\nany approval. When he was called up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor interview, the officer concerned behaved like a Special\r\n\r\nBranch man. He would ask him. \"Where do you work? Where do you\r\n\r\nact? What Party do you belong to?\" And then the questions about\r\n\r\nhis friends were asked. \"Where are your friends working? Do you\r\n\r\nknow about the activities of your friends? What are the family\r\n\r\ncircumstances of your friends? Where do they live? Can you tell\r\n\r\nme about the activities of this man and your friends?\" Now, such\r\n\r\nquestions are fired at applicants for citizenship. This is not\r\n\r\nnecessary. These questions should not be asked of the applicant\r\n\r\nfor citizenship. What should be asked should be questions\r\n\r\nconcerning his own affairs, his own residential qualifications,\r\n\r\nhis own family, and not his political activities, and the\r\n\r\npolitical activities of his friends. All these questions, it\r\n\r\nappears, are asked at the whims and fancies of the P.A.P. before\r\n\r\nthis person can be approved to be a Singapore citizen. If the\r\n\r\nperson is against the P.A.P., then he has no chance of obtaining\r\n\r\nSingapore citizenship. This is political oppression. There should\r\n\r\nnot be any political bias introduced into the applications for\r\n\r\nSingapore citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who apply for Singapore citizenship will be\r\n\r\nunfairly treated. This is not proper. In the meantime, we also\r\n\r\nknow that the P.A.P. is resorting to these means to oppress those\r\n\r\nwho deserve to become Singapore citizens and deny them such\r\n\r\nrights. Perhaps, if the P.A.P. thinks that it should not allow\r\n\r\nthe Registry of Citizenship to treat applicants in this manner,\r\n\r\nthen I would like to ask this question. If the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister feels that the Registry of Citizenship does not behave\r\n\r\nin the way that I have described, then instructions should be\r\n\r\ngiven to the interviewer and the officers responsible to behave\r\n\r\nproperly. I would like to ask him whether the interviewers are\r\n\r\nagents of the Special Branch or are they supposed to be working\r\n\r\nfor the people of Singapore? If they are from the Special Branch,\r\n\r\nthen they should go back to the Special Branch. If they are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupposed to work in the Citizenship Registry, then they should\r\n\r\nwork according to the rules and regulations governing citizenship\r\n\r\napplications. They should examine such applications without any\r\n\r\npolitical bias so as to deprive the anti-P.A.P. applicants of\r\n\r\ntheir right to take part in politics in Singapore. They think, by\r\n\r\ndoing this, the P.A.P. may have more opponents in the political\r\n\r\narena. If they think that by so doing the young people of the\r\n\r\ntype that\r\n\r\nhave described may become Singapore citizens, endangering their\r\n\r\npolitical position, then this is wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, let me ask the Member for Paya\r\n\r\nLebar, just give me an instance where lie says that Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship does not automatically confer upon the holder of\r\n\r\nSingapore citizenship Malaysian citizenship? I think it is very\r\n\r\nfar-fetched of the Member for Paya Lebar to rush into any\r\n\r\ndiscussion on this point.

If there is any delay, it is a delay on their own\r\n\r\npart, either because they find difficulty in obtaining\r\n\r\nrecommenders, or they are unable to come for interview any\r\n\r\nearlier. Decision on an application usually takes about two\r\n\r\nweeks, so far as approval is concerned, as the applicant has to\r\n\r\nundergo screening. Those who apply for citizenship under Article\r\n\r\n57 (1) of the Constitution of the State of Singapore, require a\r\n\r\nlonger period of time, usually not longer than one month, as such\r\n\r\napplications have to be forwarded to the Federal Government for\r\n\r\nconcurrence. If the Member for Paya [char wishes further\r\n\r\nclarification, let me refer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhim to the relevant section of the Constitution where it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'any person of or over the age of twenty-one years, not\r\n\r\nbeing a citizen of Malaysia, who was resident in the State on the\r\n\r\ncoming into operation of this Constitution may, on application\r\n\r\nbeing made therefor in the prescribed form be registered with the\r\n\r\nconcurrence of the Government of the Federation...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, in simple words, means that applications must be\r\n\r\napproved not only by the Singapore Government, but also by the\r\n\r\nCentral Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar complains that citizenship is not\r\n\r\nautomatically conferred upon all applicants. I would let him know\r\n\r\nthat citizenship is a prerogative for those who apply for it. It\r\n\r\nshould not be automatically given to all and sundry who apply for\r\n\r\ncitizenship. Could you imagine, Mr Speaker, if the friends of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis from Indonesia come across and submit their\r\n\r\napplications for citizenship, does the Member intend that we\r\n\r\nshould automatically confer Malaysian citizenship or Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship on his friends? I do not see any logic or any good\r\n\r\nreason why citizenship should be given to all those who have come\r\n\r\ninto this country with one intention, and that is to subvert the\r\n\r\ncountry and to bring about the downfall of the system which we\r\n\r\nare practising. Those who apply for citizenship are in the manner\r\n\r\nof supplicants. They have no right, no privilege and, in fact, it\r\n\r\nis ridiculous indeed for the Member for Paya Lebar to say that\r\n\r\ncitizenship should be something which should be given on demand.\r\n\r\nI dispute that and all those who are citizens here in Malaysia\r\n\r\nand who wish to make Malaysia their country of adoption, their\r\n\r\nfatherland, will dispute that citizenship should be given to all\r\n\r\nand sundry simply because they have filled up a piece of paper\r\n\r\nand, therefore, just as of right, it is granted them. It is quite\r\n\r\ncorrect that some of these applications are screened by the\r\n\r\nC.I.D. and the Special Branch, But if citizenship has been\r\n\r\nrefused because of such screening, it is not because these\r\n\r\npersons \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave opposed the P.A.P., as the Member for Paya Lebar is\r\n\r\nalleging.

Is\r\n\r\nrecruitment for this post done by open advertisement, or is it\r\n\r\nfilled by some P.A.P. candidate who had been unsuccessful in the\r\n\r\nlast election'? I would like to tell him, if it is the purpose to\r\n\r\nuse public funds to absorb their Party rogues for the benefit of\r\n\r\nthe Party, then it is using public funds for the benefit of the\r\n\r\nParty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the unsuccessful candidate can get a\r\n\r\nbig sum of money. If he is unqualified to hold such a post, it is\r\n\r\nnot a proper thing to do. I would like to ask whether the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretaries are such persons who were defeated in the\r\n\r\nelection and whether the P.A.P. are providing these posts for\r\n\r\nthem as a means of livelihood. The P.A.P. should be held\r\n\r\nresponsible for this. You cannot argue that because certain\r\n\r\npeople in the past have been great Party officials or high State\r\n\r\nofficials, and have now been defeated, they should be given such\r\n\r\nposts as Political Secretary.

Such an argument cannot hold water. If the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives have been voted out by the people, they are\r\n\r\npersona non grata as far as the people are concerned.

The price of a\r\n\r\ncockerel is about $1 a kati, but if the farmers try to sell at\r\n\r\nsuch a price, they will find it difficult to get buyers. If they\r\n\r\nlower the price, they will be in a worse position as they will\r\n\r\nnot be able to earn a living. The price of duck is also about $1\r\n\r\na kati. The prices of vegetables vary - to a certain extent, it\r\n\r\ndepends on the locality. I will just give some examples of the\r\n\r\nprices of vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formerly, some farmers living in Geylang - Lorong Buang Kok\r\n\r\narea - cultivated vegetables which were transported to the market\r\n\r\nfor sale. The selling prices of vegetables in Jurong, Choa Chu\r\n\r\nKang and Mandai areas varied to a certain extent. The wholesale\r\n\r\nprice of lady-fingers was about 25 cents per kati. The cost was 8\r\n\r\ncents per kati in some other areas. There is a great difference.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, in the Jurong area, some farmers transport\r\n\r\ntheir produce to other areas because of the attractive prices.\r\n\r\nThis is the position of prices for vegetables, pigs and chickens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is fertiliser. Although the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment has some chemical fertiliser for sale to the farmers,\r\n\r\nthis is not a comprehensive and extensive measure to benefit a\r\n\r\nlot of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfarmers. The chemical fertiliser is quite expensive and is not\r\n\r\npopular with the farmers. The farmers in my area have told me\r\n\r\nthat they prefer to buy chicken-waste at the price of $80 to $100\r\n\r\nper ton. If that fertiliser is used, it will affect their\r\n\r\nlivelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third problem facing the farmers is a central market. At\r\n\r\nthe present moment, there is no proper market for the farmers to\r\n\r\nsell their produce. By this, I do not refer to vegetables,\r\n\r\nchickens and pigs alone. If we have a common comprehensive market\r\n\r\nto collect all the produce of farmers and re-sell them, that will\r\n\r\nhe beneficial to the farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the co-operative societies to help the farmers. At the\r\n\r\npresent moment, vegetable farmers are faced with increased\r\n\r\ndifficulties. I want to bring out one point. In the Chinatown\r\n\r\narea, there is a place called the Sam Kang Association which\r\n\r\ncaters for vegetable-dealers coming from Jurong and Choa Chu\r\n\r\nKang. This Association re-distributes the vegetables. But this\r\n\r\nplace is far too small for proper use. I want the Government to\r\n\r\nmake improvements or find alternative accommodation for a larger\r\n\r\ncollecting centre for vegetables from various places in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth problem is more important than the others. There is\r\n\r\nthe question of land. My colleague has just now spoken on the\r\n\r\nLand Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present rate of development in Singapore, I think it\r\n\r\nis the intention of the Government to help the farmers in\r\n\r\nSingapore. But it is undeniable that the Government is oppressing\r\n\r\nsome of the farmers in other ways and this oppression has not\r\n\r\nbeen mentioned by the Government. They only talk about de\r\n\r\nvelopment and industries and give a lot of publicity to these two\r\n\r\nitems. One cannot deny that, at the present moment, arable land\r\n\r\nis diminishing all the time. This is accepted and admitted by the\r\n\r\nMinister concerned. In many places, farmers have to face the\r\n\r\nproblem of eviction and re-settlement and have to give up their\r\n\r\nfarm land, If the farmers are forced to stay in Housing Board\r\n\r\nflats,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey will lose their farm land and it will be impossible -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> On a point of information.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

But in this\r\n\r\nsection -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrimary Production, and among the farmers, Malaysia has brought\r\n\r\nthem prosperity. At present Singapore farmers are producing\r\n\r\nannually an estimated 200 million poultry, 200 million eggs,\r\n\r\nthree-quarters of a million pigs and 40,000 tons of vegetables,\r\n\r\naltogether worth a total of $200 million. This is because with\r\n\r\nMalaysia our farmers are able to export their chickens and eggs\r\n\r\nand pigs throughout Malaysia. This is one area where Malaysia has\r\n\r\nbrought us prosperity, where Malaysia has brought benefits to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member was talking about whether we are aware of\r\n\r\nthe difficulties facing farmers with regard to diseases of pigs\r\n\r\nand chickens. He is supposed to be in touch with the farmers. If\r\n\r\nhe had been in touch, he would have known we have got 8 primary\r\n\r\nextension centres. We have to give him the figures. We have\r\n\r\nundertaken immunisation, inoculation of pigs and of chickens.\r\n\r\nDuring 1963, the veterinary staff has rendered free vaccinations\r\n\r\nto farmers' poultry against Newcastle disease and fowl-pox. Pigs\r\n\r\nwere immunised against haemorrhagic septicaemia. The number of\r\n\r\npoultry vaccinated against Newcastle disease was 7,527,203, and\r\n\r\nagainst fowl-pox, 1,411,265. 6,942 pigs were vaccinated against\r\n\r\nhaemorrhagic septicaemia. We are fully aware of the difficulties\r\n\r\nfaced by the farmers and we are doing everything to help them\r\n\r\novercome these diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Panjang was talking about the varying prices\r\n\r\nof primary products from time to time. That is a natural economic\r\n\r\nlaw operating on primary products where supply and demand act on\r\n\r\neach other and the prices would naturally vary from time to time.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for the Government to guarantee any price for\r\n\r\nthe products of the farmers, unless, of course, we subsidise\r\n\r\nthem. He suggested that the Government should set up a large\r\n\r\ncentre for the collection of vegetables so that they can be well\r\n\r\ndistributed and we can have one price. I have every confidence in\r\n\r\nthe business acumen of our farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, on a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

No, I did not mean that. What I meant was that the\r\n\r\nGovernment must pay attention to the collecting centre in the\r\n\r\nChinatown area and expand it so as to give more facilities to the\r\n\r\npeople in the locality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I am sorry I misunderstood him. But the\r\n\r\ncollecting centre that he was talking about is not a Government\r\n\r\ncollecting centre. As I have said, I have every confidence in the\r\n\r\nbusiness acumen of our farmers to sell at places where they can\r\n\r\nget the best price. Anyway, I am grateful to him for the\r\n\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, Mr Speaker, Sir, land is not under my portfolio, I\r\n\r\nwould like to take a little bit of time to answer the Member for\r\n\r\nBukit Panjang. He said that we are pushing out the farmers from\r\n\r\ntheir land, and that they have no place to go to. Now this is the\r\n\r\nnatural economic law - the best use of land. Even if the\r\n\r\nGovernment does not resettle these farmers who are holding their\r\n\r\nland on T.O.L.s, the natural force of economic pressure will make\r\n\r\nthem do so. There are many farmers who are not occupying\r\n\r\nGovernment land, but renting land from private individuals. Now\r\n\r\nland prices have gone up. Even if a farmer should own a piece of\r\n\r\nland himself, say somewhere outside the town, he would find - and\r\n\r\nit has happened - that it would be more economical for him to\r\n\r\nsell his land and do some other trade, or move elsewhere to farm,\r\n\r\nrather than use his land for farming. There are instances where\r\n\r\nan acre of land which used to cost about $2,000 has been sold for\r\n\r\n$30,000, $40,000 or even $50,000. Therefore, as a man who can\r\n\r\ncalculate, the farmer would opt out of farming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of fertiliser, he said that the\r\n\r\nfarmers prefer to use chicken-waste which costs about $100 a ton\r\n\r\nand that therefore the use\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof fertiliser is not economical. There is a Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment and an experimental station whereby new methods of\r\n\r\nvegetable-growing are being experimented, and from my in\r\n\r\nformation, the farmers are taking to these new methods. Results\r\n\r\nhave shown that by using modern chemical fertiliser they get\r\n\r\nbetter produce than they did formerly. And as a result, we find\r\n\r\nthat on the same plot of land they are able to produce more\r\n\r\nvegetables than hitherto. All in all, Mr Speaker, I think the\r\n\r\nPrimary Production Department has not failed in its duty to\r\n\r\nincrease the efficiency of production of our farmers. In fact,\r\n\r\nwhere it used to take as long as seven months to produce a pig\r\n\r\nweighing a kati, it now takes four and a half months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young:</b> (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, my colleague\r\n\r\ntalked about the prices of primary produce but the Minister\r\n\r\ntalked about Malaysia being able to bring about prosperity. But\r\n\r\nincreased production does not mean that it is a good thing. If\r\n\r\nincreased production is done at a higher cost, then the farmers\r\n\r\nhave to sell their produce at a loss, I want the Minister to pay\r\n\r\nattention to the production cost of poultry and vegetables so\r\n\r\nthat farmers will not experience difficulties. This has nothing\r\n\r\nto do with the rate of production. If the cost of production can\r\n\r\nbe lowered, then the losses incurred as a result of diseases and\r\n\r\nother natural catastrophies may be recovered. There are some\r\n\r\ndiseases and calamities which cannot be cured by medicine or\r\n\r\nmodern science. There are instances of some 90 per cent of\r\n\r\npoultry dying of natural diseases in spite of injections and im\r\n\r\nmunisation. It does not mean that immunisation is very good at\r\n\r\nall times. So the Minister should pay attention to this. It is an\r\n\r\nimportant point, that the farmers must not be asked to leave\r\n\r\ntheir land and go far, far away, it is useless talking about the\r\n\r\nincrease in the price of land rising from $2,000 to $30,000 and $40,000, thus making it more profitable for the farmers to sell\r\n\r\ntheir land. This is all very unrealistic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand we have never heard of any such case ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.
