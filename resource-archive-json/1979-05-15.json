For instance, the Registrar of Vehicles can take action against \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> the owner of a vehicle which emits excessive noise. The Ministry of Culture limits the noise coming from outdoor performances and from loudspeakers in record shops, and the Ministry of the Environment can require the occupier of a trade and industrial premises which creates excessive noise to abate the noise. Administratively, the Government pursues a policy against noise pollution. Members are probably aware that Radio and Television Singapore, for instance, regularly makes announcements together with slides encouraging the people to tune down the volume of their TV and hi-fi sets. The police also often acts against persons making excessive noise at unreasonable hours. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no quick and easy answer to the problem of noise pollution in Singapore. Community noise is a particularly difficult problem due to our high population density and the cultural background of our people. However, it can be minimised by inculcating in our citizens a greater sense of civic consciousness and consideration for others. At the present moment, there are no plans to introduce further legislation to provide for anti-noise measures. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>PSA ENTRY PASSES FOR STEVEDORES</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Extension of age limit)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Tan Cheng San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Mr Tan Cheng San</b> asked the Prime Minister whether he will consider extending the age limit of stevedores to 65 years for the issue of Port of Singapore Authority passes. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Lim Kim San (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all stevedores, employed either by the PSA or private firms, require a pass from the PSA to work at the wharves. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of a stevedore requires heavy physical exertion and quick reflexes.

Minister consider building one or two more incinerators so that the question of having to dispose of refuse at an uneconomic cost at the Tampines dumping ground can be resolved? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the most economic way of disposing refuse is to dump it at the dumping ground. But that is not our only consideration when we talk about the disposal of refuse. The question is \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> whether dumping will inconvenience members of the public. We think that further large scale dumping of refuse at Tampines is undesirable. The Government has therefore spent about $90 million to build the incinerator. It is likely that its capacity will be expanded to save the residents of Tampines from further pollution. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>JALAN EUNOS</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Flood control measures)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. \n  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi</b> asked the Minister for the Environment (a) whether his Ministry had anticipated the recent floodings at Jalan Eunos in the vicinity of the Pan-Island Expressway flyover, and, if so, why the flood control measures were not effective; (b) what steps are being taken to remedy the flooding problem; how effective those measures will be; and, if they are not effective, whether he will recommend that the families affected by the floodings be resettled immediately; and (c) whether draining flood water into the Siglap Canal will cause overloading of the Canal thereby aggravating the floodings in Pachitan, Changi Road and Frankel Estate; and, if so, whether his Ministry will revise its plans by diverting flood waters elsewhere or into new drainage networks instead of into the Siglap Canal. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the piece of land between Jalan Eunos and the Pan-Island Expressway flyover now under construction is a part of the low-lying area of Geylang Serai, and it is always prone to floods. There are 20 squatter huts there. The residents there do know that this area is very prone to floods and so out of the 20 huts, 10 are on stilts. The Ministry does not run a weather bureau, but it does know that this area is prone to floods. Part of this low-lying area has been filled up to build the Pan-Island Expressway and, as a result, the rest of the area has become more prone to floods. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately we have been experiencing unusually wet weather and this has led to frequent floods in this area. The Ministry is aware of the plight of the residents there and \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> has taken remedial measures. Unfortunately, they have not been very effective. Since this is a very low-lying area, flooding cannot be alleviated unless the whole area is filled up. It is not possible to offer resettlement terms to the residents there because the land is privately owned. It does not belong to the Government. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the other part of the question, that is, draining the storm water along Jalan Eunos into the Siglap Canal, there is no plan to drain the water from other catchment areas into the Siglap Canal. Therefore, it will not be overloaded and it is unlikely to flood the surrounding area. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> Supplementary questions, Sir.

If so, did the Drainage Department indicate specifically what drainage measures should be taken to ensure that flooding would be minimised? \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is: why is it that the area now suffers from flooding? For example, the area was flooded on the 27th April and 3rd May, 1979, when the rainfall recorded was only 40 mm and 43.6 mm respectively. Yet in January 1978 when the maximum rainfall for that month was 86 mm the area was not flooded. In making this comparison we have to bear in mind that the construction of the Pan-Island Expressway flyover commenced in March 1978 and the major earthworks were somewhat completed in September/October 1978. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been trying hard to follow closely what the Member said. I am no surveyor. However, I think that the collapse of the flyover has made it more difficult for the water to drain away from this low lying area. As a result, even a slight rainfall would have flooded the area. It is only after the completion of the fly-over and the road that permanent measures to relieve the area of flooding can be considered and undertaken. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Sir, I do not wish to appear persistent on this issue.

The question is: was there prior consultation between the Drainage Department and the PWD, so that the Drainage Department could instruct the PWD of the drainage control measures that should be provided before the earth-works started? I raise this question because I understand that this is part and parcel of the code of practice in the Drainage Department before they approve major projects and give clearance before a project can commence. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, normally there is consultation between the departments concerned to try and alleviate any inconvenience that may occur.

It is too early, however, to tell whether there has been a significant drop in the consumption of electricity by the industries, as the \"Save Electricity Campaign\" was launched only in April and it will be some \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> time before we can compile the necessary statistics to make a comparative study. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board is not considering any deterrent measures yet. The emphasis now is to advise the consumers on how to conserve energy and to seek their co-operation. There has been some good response. Some factories are responding. They are studying energy conservation measures. However, these measures again will require modifications to the factory infrastructure. Time, therefore, is required for such modifications, and savings in power can only be seen after the modifications have been effected. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Mr Speaker, Sir, electricity consumption can be classified according to usage. Air-conditioning uses 26% of the electricity generated; lighting 11% and others 63%. It is possible to economise electricity consumption for air-conditioning without affecting production and efficiency.

The new Consumer Price Index shows that from the base of 100 for the period June 1977 to May 1978, there has been only a 3% rise in prices. The majority of taxpayers have surely had a greater increase than this in their earnings in the comparable period. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the cost of living is not a major consideration in deciding our tax relief policy.

My Ministry has examined the statistics more closely and estimated the magnitude of this problem in Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Labour Force Survey of 1977, there were 903,900 persons in our labour force. Of these, 132,602 persons or 14% of the labour force were self-employed. 77,200 of them appear to have incomes in the taxable brackets. Allowing for 25% under-disclosure, probably 97,000 or more were earning incomes that would put them in the tax-paying bracket. However, Income Tax records show only 42,900 of our taxpayers as self-employed. This means that at least 54,100 or 56% of the self-employed persons who have taxable incomes are not paying tax. By comparison with persons in the labour force who are employees and taxable, out of 247,800 such persons, only 1,000 or 0.4%, escaped the tax net. Therefore, the self-employed persons have not, as a class, been shouldering their fair share of the tax burden. My Ministry plans to bring these people into the tax net. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several measures have been taken to check tax evasion by the self-employed. Firstly, the Anti-Evasion Unit in the Inland \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Revenue Department has been paying increasing attention to the problem and stepped up its efforts particularly against evasion by self-employed persons. Secondly, income tax assessment forms were sent to identifiable self-employed persons, such as hawkers and taxi drivers. Thirdly, an exercise matching car-owners with taxpayers was carried out. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the three measures taken, 18,425 new taxpayers have been netted up to 30th April, 1979. The next step will be to ensure a proper assessment of their incomes so that they will be paying their fair share of the tax. This is a bigger problem. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three measures have been directed mainly at tax evasion by the more easily identifiable self-employed persons. However, a large number of self-employed persons need not be registered or licensed to carry out their trade or business.

I also said that further design and engineering studies would be carried out to obtain a set of technically accurate data on MRT track and station requirements. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a Consultant firm was engaged to carry out the Phase III study.

Therefore, a decision can only be taken after all factors have been carefully considered. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we hope to be able to make a decision after the Phase III study. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, if the Ministry cannot take any definite decision after three phases of study have been completed, has the Minister not taken into consideration the question of rising costs?

The solution would be to give them appropriate accommodation so that these cultural associations can continue with their music practice without disturbing the residents. In certain practices, the noise level has to be loud. If you ask them to tune it down, they will find that it is very difficult to practise their music. So the solution is to provide alternative accommodation rather than trying to ask the residents to allow these associations to carry on with their music practice with lower level of noise. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this kind of a complaint will continue to be received, but it would be very difficult to station an inspector there to keep on asking the association to tune down the volume of their music practice. I do not think that is a practical thing to do. A better solution would be to provide suitable alternative accommodation for these cultural organisations. This is what the HDB and URA are doing. Perhaps I would ask the Planning Department to look further into this. For example, in certain areas, like Geylang, where these associations prefer to go, certain blocks of flats could be set aside for them. We may allow these clans and associations to occupy the whole block of flats so that they will not disturb the residential neighbourhoods. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT IN SINGAPORE</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Measures to stimulate)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. \n  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry, in view of Singapore's industrialisation drive ,for the 1980s, whether a blueprint for action to stimulate technological development in Singapore has been drawn up, and if he will \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> provide an outline of the blueprint and state when it will be implemented. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is doing some preliminary research into the institutional framework and the measures needed to stimulate technological development in Singapore. We hope to develop the ideas further into a plan for implementation next year. Nevertheless, I would like to share with the House some tentative thoughts on how we can stimulate technological development. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the fastest way is to encourage technological transfer from abroad. We must therefore continue to promote foreign investment, especially in higher technology products. These products include machine tools, industrial machinery, optical instruments and other precision engineering products, aircraft and automobile components, industrial electronics and computer-related products, petrochemicals and fine chemicals. Secondly, existing industries must be encouraged to automate and upgrade their operations to increase their technological content. Thirdly, we must continue to expand and upgrade our industrial training facilities as manpower development is an integral part of technological development. Fourthly, local industries must also upgrade their technology. The Economic Development Board can help by assisting them to form joint ventures with foreign partners. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the thrust for our industrialisation in the 1980's will still be largely dependent on technology transfer from abroad, we must consider how to promote engineering research and development (R &amp; D) work by industries and institutions in Singapore. A modest start has been made with the Product Development Assistance Scheme. Companies are also allowed to deduct R &amp; D expenses for income tax purposes. In addition, we are now examining a proposal for Government to set up a proper institutional framework, such as a high level national body, to spearhead and coordinate our drive on R &amp; D. This body will examine our R &amp; D \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> manpower development, identify R &amp; D needs and capabilities and coordinate our R &amp; D efforts both in the public and private sectors. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some broad steps that we can take to stimulate technological development in Singapore.

Good government requires political and administrative leadership of indisputable integrity, ability and dedication. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector needs a fair share of the best brains to tackle the complex economic and social problems Singapore will face in the next two decades. The thrust of our economy will continue to depend on the entrepreneurial vigour and business acumen of our private sector but its management will require sophisticated skills and administra- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> tive excellence in the public sector. Singapore's rapid development in the last two decades has opened up career opportunities hitherto unavailable for persons with talent outside the public service. The Singapore Administrative Service, as the premier service in the public sector, must therefore be attractive enough for it to recruit and retain a fair proportion of the cream of our graduates. The terms and conditions of the Administrative Service must match the best in the private sector. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has compared the incomes of graduates in the public and private sectors. This was done by constructing a comprehensive income profile of the graduate population in Singapore from a number of authoritative sources. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The findings of the income comparison between graduates in the public and private sectors suggest that while the average officer in the Administrative Service earns as much as the average officer in the private sector, the remuneration of the outstanding Administrative Officer is much less than that of the top 5% of the salaried graduates in the private sector. The starting remuneration in the Administrative Service is generally more attractive than in the private sector but the outstanding executive in the private sector soon outstrips his peer in the Administrative Service. Although those who reach the top echelon of the private sector earn far more than the top Administrative Officers, the skills, drive and dedication required of both in the respective sector are comparable. This disparity in rewards puts the highflyers in the Administrative Service at a disadvantage. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this study of incomes of graduates in the private sector and the public sector, the Government has concluded that the immediate problem is not one of inadequate financial rewards for the average Administrative Officer. It is the problem of gross disparity between what the outstanding graduates are earning in the private sector \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> compared to what the highflyers are earning in the Administrative Service. This revision to the salary structure of the Administrative Service is to put right this gap in earnings of top graduates. For the present, a general salary revision is not necessary. Whether a revision will become necessary in 2 - 3 years' time depends on the growth of private sector incomes for the average graduates compared to those in the public sector. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outstanding officers in the Administrative Service can best be rewarded through (a) the creation of additional Time-scale, Superscale and Staff Grades, and (b) frequent promotions within the revised salary structure to enable the outstanding officers to maintain parity with their peers in the private sector. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>New Salary Grades</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has, therefore, decided to create the following grades in its Administrative Service: - \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Three Staff Grades I, II and III above Superscale A; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Two Superscale Grades D1 and C1; and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A Senior Administrative Assistant grade between Administrative Assistant and Assistant Secretary grades. \n  <br> \n  <br>I would now like to table the revised salary structure for the Singapore Administrative Service. [Annex A (Cols. 375 - 376) handed in to the Clerk and distributed to hon. Members] Mr Speaker, Sir, from the table you will notice that, henceforth, only Superscale Grade C and above will be known as Permanent Secretary grades. The salaries for the various Staff Grades, Superscale Grades D1 and C1, are all indicated in the table which has just been circulated to Members. \n  <br> \n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1979/19790515/19790515-HA-0390375.htm\">Annex A (Cols. 375 - 376)</a> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three new Superscale Staff Grades will demonstrate beyond doubt that the most outstanding civil servants can aspire to levels of remuneration approximating those of the chief executives of large private enterprises. These Staff Grades will act as an incentive to \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> serving officers and as an attraction to the bright young graduates commencing or contemplating a career in the civil service. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three Staff Grades I, II and III will be brought into operation in stages in three promotion exercises, once every 15 to 24 months. They will be filled only if there are deserving officers. Thus, at the earliest, Staff Grade III will be filled only in 3 3/4 to 6 years' time. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Accelerated Promotion</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Senior Administrative Assistant grade will enable the Public Service Commission (PSC) to accord promotion to promising officers in the Timescale grades more quickly. Outstanding Administrative Assistants, particularly those who have completed full time National Service, can expect to be promoted to this grade within their first few years of service. These are the officers who are more likely to leave the service if they feel they are not making sufficiently quick progress in their career. Promotion at shorter time-intervals confers recognition and a sense of forward movement. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the two Superscale Grades D1 and C1, together with the existing Super-scale Grade B1, will give the PSC flexibility in promoting meritorious and dedicated officers. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance the attractiveness of the Administrative Service, in future officers in the Timescale and Superscale Grades E and below can be recommended for annual promotion. The ablest may be allowed to jump grades. Promotion will not depend on vacancies but on merit alone. Officers will not be forgotten even if posted to what are generally regarded as mundane jobs. Talent will be spread over all Ministries. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ability recognised through frequent promotions, it should be possible for an outstanding officer to advance rapidly from cadetship to the grade of Permanent Secretary, Superscale C, in 12 to 15 years. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Future Salary Review</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salaries in the Administrative Service will be reviewed periodically in the light of per- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> formance of the economy and comparable opportunities and remuneration levels in the private sector. Adjustments, apart from those through annual National Wages Council (NWC) increases, will be made if the rewards for the best in the public sector get out of line with those enjoyed by outstanding executives in the private sector. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next review will be made in 2 1/2 - 3 years' time. It will be preceded by a thorough study of rewards in the public and private sectors. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Professional Services</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Ministerial Committee headed by the Minister for Trade and Industry has been set up to look into the terms and conditions of the Professional and Other Services, It will submit its recommendations to the Cabinet within three months. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must add that whatever changes there are to the Professional or Other Services, the pre-eminence of the Administrative Service will be the cornerstone of all services. This is our premier service. Top administrators help Ministers to formulate and to decide on national policies. These policies affect all sectors of society. Therefore, we must have our best and balanced minds as top administrators. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one smaller group of officers is more important. They are the SAF scholar officers. They will have career prospects as good as, and rates of promotion faster than, top administrators. The reason is compelling. In an emergency, they are responsible for the lives of more than 70% of our young men in the active and reserve service. In ordinary times, they help decide how we spend 5% of our GDP or about 16% of our Budget. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had we recognised this and insisted on high calibre administrators and SAF scholar officers 20, or even 10, years ago, Singapore would have been better off today. It is better that we put this right forthwith than leave our spread of talent to chance. We would then end up with talent in the wrong places, ill-adjusted and ill-suited to the needs of our future. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>3.45 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, since such a move will benefit only a small group, namely, the ablest or, as the Hon. Minister has just mentioned, the highflyers at the top echelon in the Singapore Administrative Service, would the implementation of this new policy not discourage or bring about dissatisfaction or even frustration to the average Administrative Officers and lesser peers in the Administrative Service? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification. If Government's recognition of the service of its officers is based on merit or performance, why is the annual increment of an Honours degree graduate twice as much as that of the general degree graduate? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think that the average Administrative Officer needs feel frustrated by the revision to the salary structure. As a comparison of the incomes of graduates between the public sector and the private sector shows, the incomes of the average Administrative Officers in the public sector are comparable to what their peers are earning outside. The existing salary range of the Singapore Administrative Service allows sufficient flexibility for the average officer to move at a rate which is commensurate with the rate of progress of his counterpart in the private sector. I do not think that in our effort to attract the best into the Administrative Service, the average Administrative Officer needs to feel frustrated. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the disparity in annual increments between the Honours graduate and the general degree graduate is because generally one would expect an Honours graduate, given the better formal qualification which is a reflection of his talent and ability, to contribute more than the general degree graduate. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Does the Minister mean to say that the merit or performance does not matter? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Merit or performance matters a lot, Mr Speaker, Sir. But \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> the officers would move upwards within their own salary scales or the Service in which they are in. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, whilst I agree that we have to introduce such a policy to retain the ablest and the best within the Administrative Service, we must also not forget that the Executive Officers as well as those in the Clerical Service also play an important role in the civil service. In that respect, Sir, would the Hon. Minister consider looking into the statement I have posed? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, the head and the legs must function together, and I take the point that the Executive Service and the Clerical Service are important to the proper functioning of the Government. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is whether the salary scales of the Executive Service and the Clerical Service are such that we are not able to attract suitable officers to serve in these two particular services. I understand that up to now there is no great difficulty in recruiting the necessary personnel for these two services. Therefore, it would seem to suggest that at this particular moment there is no need for us to look into these two services with a view to a general revision of their salary scales. There is no compelling reason why we need to do so at this stage anyway. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we can agree in general with the observations made by the Senior Minister of State - \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> Minister for Trade and Industry. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> I am sorry. It is a slip of the tongue, Sir, but it is easily explained. Sir, we seem to be in the habit of demoting people by creating new grades. So even if I had demoted the Hon. Minister for a moment, it may come in the future if there is a super Ministerial post being created. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody in the civil service has been demoted because of the additional grades created at the top. Those who thought they were already at the top of the ladder now are three rungs below the top. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mention this, Sir, because at the University people are reacting this way. The Professors who are already at the top now find another rank above them, super Professor or Senior Professor. There is no guarantee that in the years to come there might even be higher ranks of civil servants or Professors. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not detect a question in the comment made by the hon. Member. Nevertheless, I would give a reply. For the University, I do not know whether the Member would prefer that there is no creation of new posts. I thought the creation of new posts above the existing highest grade is to allow them a further opportunity to move upwards. I am surprised if the University Professors do not appreciate that this is to allow the ablest of the Professors to move upwards. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, what you get as a result is a demotion in terms of status.
