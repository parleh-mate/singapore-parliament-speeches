On  the  whole,  the\r\n\r\nmeasures  we  have recommended in the White  Paper\r\n\r\nhave  been  adopted.  The  Metrication  Board  has\r\n\r\nconcentrated  its initial efforts  in  introducing\r\n\r\nmetrication   to   Government   departments    and\r\n\r\nstatutory  bodies.  It  has  more  or  less   been\r\n\r\ncompleted,  and  the  Metrication  Board  is   now\r\n\r\ndirecting  its  attention to the  private  sector,\r\n\r\nincluding the industries and the retail trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the measures which have been adopted for\r\n\r\nmetrication   is  documentation   by   the   Trade\r\n\r\nDivision,  the Department of Customs  and  Excise,\r\n\r\nand  the  Statistics  Department,  which  requires\r\n\r\ntraders to declare the goods and have their excise\r\n\r\nduties  assessed in metric units. The Post  Office\r\n\r\ntoo is currently operating in metric units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another programme implemented and which has great\r\n\r\nimpact upon the general public is the introduction\r\n\r\nof  metric  units to the various aspects  of  road\r\n\r\ntransport.   The  Public  Works  Department,   the\r\n\r\nRegistry  of  Vehicles, the Police Department  and\r\n\r\nprivate  organisations,  such  as  the  Automobile\r\n\r\nAssociation  of Singapore and the National  Safety\r\n\r\nFirst  Council, were all involved in the  planning\r\n\r\nof  a  programme  for the smooth  introduction  of\r\n\r\nspeed limits and distance markers in metric units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, motorists came into contact with\r\n\r\nmetrication  when  they began  to  buy  petrol  in\r\n\r\nlitres.  A campaign is currently being planned  in\r\n\r\nAugust  to  make motorists accustomed  to  reading\r\n\r\nspeed  limits  in kilometres per  hour.  For  this\r\n\r\ncampaign we are seeking the co-operation of petrol\r\n\r\npump stations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many government departments, fees and charges\r\n\r\nfor the various services rendered are now based on\r\n\r\nmetric  units.  The  Public Utilities  Board,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  now  charges for water in cubic  metres.\r\n\r\nCare  has been taken to ensure that these  changes\r\n\r\ndo  not  result in any increase at the expense  of\r\n\r\nthe general public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In departments where technical matters are\r\n\r\ninvolved, the change to metric is a little slower.\r\n\r\nBut  the Public Works Department, the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board, and the Public Utilities  Board\r\n\r\nhave  all finalised their programmes with a target\r\n\r\ndate  of  1975,  by which time  they  hope  to  he\r\n\r\ncompletely metricated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of the metrication programme is still in\r\n\r\nthe  planning  stage. Nevertheless,  packaging  of\r\n\r\npaints  in  metric units was introduced  in  July,\r\n\r\n1972,   and  the  Metrication  Board  is  likewise\r\n\r\nlooking   into  similar  conversions   for   other\r\n\r\npackaged goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the construction industry, which is affected\r\n\r\nto  a  great extent by the building activities  in\r\n\r\nthe  private sector, metric conversion  programmes\r\n\r\nfor  bricks,  various  types  of  tiles,  pre-cast\r\n\r\nhollow  blocks,  reinforced steel  bars  and  sawn\r\n\r\ntimber,  were completed. In all cases  it  is  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of the Government to give whatever support\r\n\r\nit could provide, such as restricting the purchase\r\n\r\nof materials for use by the public sector to those\r\n\r\ndesigned in metric.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the metric units to the\r\n\r\nretail  trade, however, will be gradual so as  not\r\n\r\nto  cause  the  lay  public  any  undue  hardship.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  it  will need time to educate  the  lay\r\n\r\npublic  on  the  metric system. Nevertheless,  the\r\n\r\nsale  of  textiles by the metre was introduced  in\r\n\r\nMarch  1972, on the initiative of the Chambers  of\r\n\r\nCommerce  themselves.  This  has  now  become  the\r\n\r\nwidespread  practice among the larger departmental\r\n\r\nstores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to express  my\r\n\r\ncongratulations to the Minister for the success he\r\n\r\nhas   achieved  through  his  department  in   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the metric system. The  Minister\r\n\r\njust now mentioned the adoption and completion  of\r\n\r\nmetrication  programmes by various departments.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether  he  is  prepared in the coming  weeks  to\r\n\r\nintroduce metrication to the taxi services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is, whether the Minister is\r\n\r\naware  that certain retailers have not yet adopted\r\n\r\nthe metric system. Can the Minister see to it that\r\n\r\nretailers  do  not try to cheat  the  public  when\r\n\r\nmeasuring  out  the goods to the public?  If  such\r\n\r\ncases  are  found  out,  what  measures  will  the\r\n\r\nMinister adopt to deal with such retailers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I think I made it\r\n\r\nvery clear that the general public in Singapore is\r\n\r\nnot  accustomed  yet to comprehending  the  metric\r\n\r\nunits  used  either for distances, or weights,  or\r\n\r\nfor  other  measures. Therefore, it  will  require\r\n\r\ntime to reinterpret how long is a mile in terms of\r\n\r\nkilometres; how heavy is a kilogram in terms of  a\r\n\r\nkati,  and  so  on. For this reason,  we  have  no\r\n\r\nspecific  programme to involve the  conversion  of\r\n\r\ntaximeters   into  the  metric  system.   However,\r\n\r\nsometime in the future, by 1975 or a little  later\r\n\r\nwe  hope that the passenger as well as taxi driver\r\n\r\nwill  have  been  used to the metric  system,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  it will then be possible to change  the\r\n\r\ntaxi-meter to the metric system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the retail trade, I do not think it is\r\n\r\npossible  to abandon customary measures  so  soon.\r\n\r\nAmahs  and  housewives who go to market  are  more\r\n\r\naccustomed to buying goods in terms of  katis  and\r\n\r\ntahils.  It will be very foolish of us if we  were\r\n\r\nto   insist  on  an  immediate  change  of   their\r\n\r\npurchases  to the kilogram when they do  not  know\r\n\r\nhow  many kilograms are equal to a kati. It is  in\r\n\r\nthis  transitional period that we have to exercise\r\n\r\nextreme  caution;  otherwise  we  will  find  that\r\n\r\nretailers  will  make use of this  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nexploit  housewives and consumers. Hence, we  have\r\n\r\ndeliberately said in the White Paper that  as  far\r\n\r\nas  the  private sector is concerned, particularly\r\n\r\nin  the  retail  trade area, we will  go  slow  on\r\n\r\nmetrication until the people of Singapore are more\r\n\r\neducated in the metric system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COMPENSATIONS FOR RESETTLEMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Request for increase)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for Law and\r\n\r\nNational  Development, in view of the rising  cost\r\n\r\nof   living,  if  the  Government  will   consider\r\n\r\nincreasing  the  rate  of ex-gratia  compensations\r\n\r\npayable   to   eligible   families   affected   by\r\n\r\nresettlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Generally, employers have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproved  worthy of the trust placed upon  them  and\r\n\r\nhave  exercised the powers restored to them  in  a\r\n\r\nfair  and  responsible manner. There are, however,\r\n\r\nsome irresponsible employers who are abusing these\r\n\r\npowers by dismissing employees without just  cause\r\n\r\nor  excuse.  Where  the  dismissed  employees  are\r\n\r\nrepresented by trade unions, adequate  redress  is\r\n\r\nprovided under the Industrial Relations Act  which\r\n\r\nempowers  the  Minister to order reinstatement  or\r\n\r\npayment of compensation if, after due inquiry,  he\r\n\r\nis  of  the opinion that the dismissal was without\r\n\r\njust  cause  or excuse. Such redress, however,  is\r\n\r\nnot  available  to  non-unionised  employees.   At\r\n\r\npresent, all that the Commissioner for Labour  can\r\n\r\ndo  is  to  order the employer to pay a salary  in\r\n\r\nlieu  of  notice  of termination  which  can  only\r\n\r\namount  to  a maximum of four weeks' pay depending\r\n\r\non   the   length  of  service  of  the   employee\r\n\r\nconcerned. This is clearly no deterrent  to  those\r\n\r\nemployers  bent on maximising profits without  any\r\n\r\nregard for the well being of their employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members will no doubt agree with me that  a\r\n\r\nnon-unionised  employee is  as  much  entitled  to\r\n\r\nprotection   against  unjust  dismissal   as   his\r\n\r\nunionised  counterpart.  Clause  2  of  the  Bill,\r\n\r\ntherefore, seeks to provide that where an employee\r\n\r\nhas  been  dismissed by his employer on ground  of\r\n\r\nmisconduct,  he has a right to refer his  case  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  if his dismissal was wrongful.  The\r\n\r\nMinister   will   be  empowered   to   order   the\r\n\r\nreinstatement  of the employee  or  to  order  the\r\n\r\nemployer   to  pay  compensation  if,  after   due\r\n\r\ninquiry,  he  is satisfied that the dismissal  was\r\n\r\nwrongful.  Responsible  and fair-minded  employers\r\n\r\nwill  have  nothing to fear, as the  amendment  is\r\n\r\ndirected against the irresponsible amongst them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is also a need to prevent\r\n\r\nexploitation   of  children  and  young   persons,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  the  context  of  a  tight  labour\r\n\r\nmarket. Presently, a person who employs a child or\r\n\r\nyoung person without a Certificate of Registration\r\n\r\nissued  by  the  Commissioner or contrary  to  the\r\n\r\nconditions  set  out  in the certificate  may,  on\r\n\r\nconviction, be fined a sum not exceeding  $500  or\r\n\r\nsentenced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  imprisonment  for  a term  not  exceeding  six\r\n\r\nmonths  or  both. As imprisonment has  never  been\r\n\r\nimposed by the Court, the maximum penalty of  $500\r\n\r\nis, therefore, not sufficiently deterrent and,  of\r\n\r\nlate,  there is a growing tendency among employers\r\n\r\nto  engage children and young persons to  work  in\r\n\r\nfactories and other industrial establishments with\r\n\r\nscant  regard for their safety and health  at  the\r\n\r\nwork  place.  Members  will agree  with  me  that,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding  the requirements  of  industries,\r\n\r\nour   obligation  must  be  to  ensure  that  high\r\n\r\nstandards   of  health  and  safety   prevail   in\r\n\r\nestablishments   employing  children   and   young\r\n\r\npersons.  Since  employers must be  deterred  from\r\n\r\nemploying  young workers without regard for  their\r\n\r\nhealth  and  safety,  the  maximum  fine  will  be\r\n\r\nincreased from $500 to $2,000 by clause 7  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.  Also, where a child or young person suffers\r\n\r\nserious   injury   or   death   arising   from   a\r\n\r\ncontravention of the provisions of the  Employment\r\n\r\nAct,  the Court shall, upon the coming into  force\r\n\r\nof this Bill, impose a mandatory fine of $2,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last October, my colleague, the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth,  outlined in his Ministerial Statement  in\r\n\r\nParliament  the measures to be taken to  encourage\r\n\r\nfamily  planning. One of these measures calls  for\r\n\r\nthe   curtailment  of  paid  maternity  leave  for\r\n\r\nemployees  in both the public and private  sectors\r\n\r\nfrom  three  to two confinements with effect  from\r\n\r\n1st  August this year. For employees in the public\r\n\r\nsector,  appropriate amendments to the Instruction\r\n\r\nManuals have been made by the Ministry of Finance.\r\n\r\nAs  for the private sector, clause 19 of this Bill\r\n\r\nseeks  to provide that a female employee will  not\r\n\r\nbe  entitled  to any pay when she absents  herself\r\n\r\nfrom  work during a confinement if at the time  of\r\n\r\nconfinement   she  has  two  or   more   surviving\r\n\r\nchildren.  This  clause also  supersedes  whatever\r\n\r\nagreement that may be provided under any  existing\r\n\r\ncollective agreements insofar as they provide  for\r\n\r\nbetter or more favourable maternity benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, three compensatory aspects of\r\n\r\nclause 19 which deserve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspecial  mention. Firstly, maternity  benefits  as\r\n\r\nprovided  under  Part X of the Act  are  presently\r\n\r\nonly applicable to female workmen. These statutory\r\n\r\nentitlements will now he extended by clause 19  to\r\n\r\nall  female employees. This amendment ensures that\r\n\r\nall female employees will be well taken care of up\r\n\r\nto  two  confinements,  thereby  safeguarding  the\r\n\r\nhealth of both mother and child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the present Act provides that a female\r\n\r\nworkman  is entitled to paid maternity leave  four\r\n\r\nweeks before and four weeks after her confinement.\r\n\r\nIf  she  gives birth prematurely, i.e, before  the\r\n\r\nestimated date of delivery, she will not  be  able\r\n\r\nto  enjoy  the four weeks of paid maternity  leave\r\n\r\nbefore  her confinement. This will now be  amended\r\n\r\nby  clause 19 which provides that where  a  female\r\n\r\nemployee has worked in her employment for any  day\r\n\r\nduring the period of four weeks immediately before\r\n\r\nher confinement, she shall be entitled to receive,\r\n\r\nin  addition to her ordinary rate of pay for  that\r\n\r\nday,  an  amount equivalent to a day's pay  or  to\r\n\r\nabsent herself from work on another day at the end\r\n\r\nof  her  benefit  period. In  other  words,  every\r\n\r\nfemale  employee is entitled to the full maternity\r\n\r\nleave of eight weeks or pay in lieu of any portion\r\n\r\nof such leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the present Act provides that a female\r\n\r\nworkman   will  forfeit  in  toto  her   maternity\r\n\r\nbenefits  if  she fails to give proper  notice  of\r\n\r\nconfinement to her employer. This is unduly  harsh\r\n\r\nespecially where failure to give notice is due  to\r\n\r\ngenuine ignorance of the legal requirement on  the\r\n\r\npart  of the female workman concerned. Clause  19,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  seeks to provide that where  a  female\r\n\r\nemployee   fails   to  give   proper   notice   of\r\n\r\nconfinement  to her employer, she  will  still  he\r\n\r\nentitled to one half of the maternity benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N.

I am particularly\r\n\r\ninterested in clause 2 of the Bill. To begin with,\r\n\r\nthis clause seeks to introduce a form of procedure\r\n\r\nwhereby  a  worker  or  an  employee  within   the\r\n\r\ndefinition   of   the  original   Act   may   seek\r\n\r\nreinstatement in his former employment if  he  can\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the  Minister that he has been  dismissed\r\n\r\nfrom  service without just cause or excuse by  his\r\n\r\nemployer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Minister has pointed out, a similar\r\n\r\nprocedure  is  found  in section  35  (2)  of  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Act. The only difference,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  under  section 35 (2) of  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  Act, is that a worker who is  aggrieved\r\n\r\nby  his  dismissal  must  make  representation  in\r\n\r\nwriting to the Minister through his union, whereas\r\n\r\nunder the provisions of the proposed amendment  to\r\n\r\nthe  Employment Act he need not he a member  of  a\r\n\r\nunion.  We,  in the NTUC, have in the past  always\r\n\r\nregarded  a  worker,  who  is  eligible  to   seek\r\n\r\nmembership  in  the  union but who  refrains  from\r\n\r\njoining a union, as a parasite in our society.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, from our point of view, the proposed\r\n\r\nprocedure   in   clause   2   of   the   Bill   is\r\n\r\nobjectionable. You will agree with me,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nin  legislating  matters which  are  interrelated,\r\n\r\nthere   should  be  some  uniformity.   Both   the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act and the Industrial  Relations  Act\r\n\r\nare    pieces   of   legislation   governing   the\r\n\r\nrelationship   between  the   employer   and   the\r\n\r\nemployee.  I  do hope that clause 2 of  the  Bill,\r\n\r\nwhich   introduces  a  new  section  14   in   the\r\n\r\nEmployment Act, could he amended at page 2,  lines\r\n\r\n7   and  8  of  the  Bill,  to  ensure  that   any\r\n\r\nrepresentation  to the Minister for  reinstatement\r\n\r\narising from a wrongful dismissal can be made only\r\n\r\nthrough a union and not otherwise. However,  I  do\r\n\r\nrealise  that it may be desirable to make suitable\r\n\r\nprovisions   in   exceptional   cases,   such   as\r\n\r\ndismissals of a prospective union member  who  may\r\n\r\nbe  engaged in organising workers in his place  of\r\n\r\nemployment  or in cases where recognition  of  the\r\n\r\nunion  is  withheld by the employer  for  lack  of\r\n\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, Sir, it would be relevant for\r\n\r\nme  to draw the attention of the House to the need\r\n\r\nto  consider introducing a clear and definite form\r\n\r\nof  procedure  in dealing with the merits  of  the\r\n\r\nrepresentation  for  reinstatement.  However,   to\r\n\r\nunderstand  and  appreciate what  I  am  about  to\r\n\r\npropose,  one has to go back to the year 1965.  At\r\n\r\nthe   end   of  that  year,  Sir,  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  (Amendment) Act, 1965, was passed.  One\r\n\r\nof  the most important amendments was the granting\r\n\r\nof  specific  powers to the Industrial Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt  to  order the reinstatement of a  dismissed\r\n\r\nemployee.  This power was removed  in  1968  by  a\r\n\r\nfurther amendment to the Industrial Relations Act.\r\n\r\nAnd  now, Sir, only in cases of victimisation does\r\n\r\nthe Court have the power to reinstate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the restrictions placed on the\r\n\r\nCourt's  power to deal with dismissal  cases,  the\r\n\r\nonly  remedy  available in the  case  of  wrongful\r\n\r\ndismissal is that provided under section 35 (2) of\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Relations Act. In the early stages\r\n\r\nfollowing  the amendment in 1968, a few  inquiries\r\n\r\nwere  held  at  the  Labour Court  in  the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry,  presided over by an  officer  appointed\r\n\r\nfor  that  purpose. Witnesses were allowed  to  be\r\n\r\ncalled  by both parties and could testify  at  the\r\n\r\ninquiry. To some extent the proceedings at such an\r\n\r\ninquiry, though informal, were well regulated  and\r\n\r\nwere quite satisfactory. For the past three years,\r\n\r\nhowever,  no inquiries of such a nature have  been\r\n\r\nheld.  Instead, when representation  is  made  for\r\n\r\nreinstatement, Labour Ministry officials call  for\r\n\r\nthe    parties   separately   and    make    their\r\n\r\nrecommendations   thereafter.   In   trade   union\r\n\r\ncircles,   dismissal  as  a  form  of  punishment,\r\n\r\nespecially  to a worker who has put in many  years\r\n\r\nof service, is analogous to a death sentence as it\r\n\r\nis  the  supreme form of punishment. Nor shall  we\r\n\r\nconfine our attention only to the dismissed worker\r\n\r\nwho may well be either the sole breadwinner or the\r\n\r\nmain  provider in his family. So, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nby  one  injudicious act an employer  can  inflict\r\n\r\npunishment on a group of innocent persons. It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, necessary for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nus when dealing with dismissal cases to extend our\r\n\r\nconsideration to the family unit as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to deal with the\r\n\r\nrelevant  provisions in clause 2. In the  proposed\r\n\r\nsection  14  (1) (b), the employer  is  given  the\r\n\r\nright  to  suspend  a  worker without  payment  of\r\n\r\nsalary  for a period not exceeding one week.  This\r\n\r\nis  a re-enactment of the existing provision. From\r\n\r\nexperience,  Sir, very few employers  observe  the\r\n\r\nprovision  to suspend a worker for one week.  What\r\n\r\nthey  normally do is to hold an inquiry  of  their\r\n\r\nown.  They  make  their own investigation  without\r\n\r\ngiving  an opportunity to the suspended worker  to\r\n\r\nexplain   or   to   counter  the  allegations   of\r\n\r\nmisconduct.   In  some  cases,  Sir,   where   the\r\n\r\ninvestigation cannot be completed within  a  week,\r\n\r\nthe   employers  invariably  proceed  to  dismiss,\r\n\r\nbelieving, rightly or wrongly, that if they do not\r\n\r\ndismiss  after one week they might lose the  right\r\n\r\nto  dismiss.  Even more disturbing,  Sir,  is  the\r\n\r\npossibility  that the employer, being  engaged  in\r\n\r\nmore  urgent  business, may not be  able  to  take\r\n\r\nprompt steps to investigate into the alleged  acts\r\n\r\nof  misconduct, and when he finds that the week is\r\n\r\ncoming to an end through his neglect to take steps\r\n\r\npromptly,  he will proceed to dismiss. In  matters\r\n\r\nof this nature, Sir, it is desirable to extend the\r\n\r\ntime  where the case requires it. I would  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the suspension period for the purpose of  an\r\n\r\ninquiry  be one week initially, during  which  the\r\n\r\nemployee  is  paid  half  his  salary,  with   the\r\n\r\npossible  extension  of  a  further  week  on  one\r\n\r\nquarter of his salary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have criticised the procedure adopted by\r\n\r\nemployers  by  holding inquiries in  the  form  of\r\n\r\nprivate  investigation without  the  worker  being\r\n\r\ngiven  a  chance  to explain. We have  found  that\r\n\r\nthere are always two versions to a story. In  such\r\n\r\nan  important matter as dismissal, there can be no\r\n\r\njustice   unless   the   worker,   against    whom\r\n\r\nallegations  of misconduct are made,  is  given  a\r\n\r\nfair  opportunity to state his case. In  addition,\r\n\r\nhe  must  be allowed to be represented by a  union\r\n\r\nrepresentative of his own choice and be allowed to\r\n\r\ncontest the testimony of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npersons  who have made statements against him.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  we consider that  it  is  not  only\r\n\r\ndesirable but necessary that an employee,  against\r\n\r\nwhom allegations of misconduct are made, should be\r\n\r\ngiven  the chance to confront witnesses  from  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  side who have made statements  against\r\n\r\nhim. I suggest, Sir, that the worker must also  he\r\n\r\ngiven  the  opportunity to call any  witnesses  he\r\n\r\nconsiders  necessary  to testify  on  his  behalf.\r\n\r\nJustice, Sir, must not only be done but also  seen\r\n\r\nto be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggested procedure, as mentioned by me\r\n\r\nearlier,   is  particularly  necessary   following\r\n\r\nrepresentations to the Minister for  reinstatement\r\n\r\nfollowing a wrongful dismissal. I observe that the\r\n\r\nCommissioner for Labour will he entrusted with the\r\n\r\nduty to inquire into the dismissal and to make the\r\n\r\nnecessary  report to the Minister.  The  suggested\r\n\r\nprocedure  I mentioned earlier should he  followed\r\n\r\neach   time  the  Commissioner  carries   out   an\r\n\r\ninvestigation  into a dismissal case  referred  to\r\n\r\nhim  by the Minister. The present procedure  under\r\n\r\nthe  industrial  Relations Act - that  of  meeting\r\n\r\nunion      representatives     and      management\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  separately  has  proved   to   be\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory. If this procedure  is  allowed  to\r\n\r\ncontinue, the confidence of workers in the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  be  shaken. And if  confidence  is\r\n\r\nshaken, it is not likely for the workers to  refer\r\n\r\ntheir  grievances, especially in dismissal  cases,\r\n\r\nto  the Labour Ministry. In the ultimate, it  will\r\n\r\nlead to a situation which the House can imagine  -\r\n\r\nhow  much  industrial unrest  it  will  cause!  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  1  am sure that that  is  not  the\r\n\r\nintention of this legislation, and I urge that the\r\n\r\nmost  serious consideration be given to the points\r\n\r\nI have raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  fully support the views expressed by the Member for Telok Blangah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Act and the Industrial Relations\r\n\r\nAct  were  implemented since  1968,  which  impose\r\n\r\nseveral restrictions on the workers, one of  which\r\n\r\nis  that  employers have the right to promote,  to\r\n\r\ntransfer,  to  reorganise,  to  dismiss,   or   to\r\n\r\nretrench their employees. At that time the workers\r\n\r\naccepted  these  restrictions so  as  to  help  to\r\n\r\ncreate  a  good climate for investors to  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore, and thereby provide employment for  our\r\n\r\npeople.  Since  1968 Singapore has  been  enjoying\r\n\r\nindustrial peace and today we are experiencing  an\r\n\r\neconomic boom with full employment. I am proud  to\r\n\r\nsay  that,  with  the guidance  of  the  NTUC  and\r\n\r\nvarious  trade  union  leaders,  the  workers   in\r\n\r\nSingapore have conducted themselves very well  and\r\n\r\nhave maintained the continuity of industrial peace\r\n\r\nwhich,  of  course, helps to preserve the  present\r\n\r\npolitical and economic stability. The workers  and\r\n\r\nthe union leaders have acted in a very intelligent\r\n\r\nand  reasonable  way  towards the  employers  when\r\n\r\ndealing  with  the  various  industrial  disputes.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,   some   stupid   and    unreckoned\r\n\r\nemployers  mistook our reasonableness  to  be  our\r\n\r\nweakness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a limit to everything. If employers\r\n\r\nstill  continue to take advantage  of  the  labour\r\n\r\nlaws  by  dismissing and retrenching  workers  and\r\n\r\nunion  leaders and to subtly victimise them so  as\r\n\r\nto  weaken  the strength and unity  of  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion movement, then I suggest that the employers'\r\n\r\nright  to dismiss and to retrench employees should\r\n\r\nbe  taken  away from the Employment  Act  and  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Act. Why should the  workers\r\n\r\nbe  made to suffer and to sacrifice all the  time?\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would like to read part of the  editorial\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Labour News of July 1973, published  by\r\n\r\nSILO  and  PIEU, expressing concern over employers\r\n\r\nretrenching employees in order to cow the  workers\r\n\r\nfrom  becoming  union leaders and  to  weaken  the\r\n\r\nunion. I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Recent events showed that the hidden sharp point\r\n\r\nof  the  instrument  of retrenchment  is  used  by\r\n\r\nemployers   to   get   rid  of  branch   committee\r\n\r\nofficials;  in  a few instances, the  retrenchment\r\n\r\nexercises  have  knifed off as many  as  half  the\r\n\r\ntotal number of branch committee officials. In the\r\n\r\nfirst  place,  such  retrenchment  exercises  are,\r\n\r\nbasically, for the purpose of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbreaking up the branch committees and to make them\r\n\r\nimpotent. In the second place, they are  meant  to\r\n\r\ncow  other  workers  from offering  themselves  to\r\n\r\nstand   for  election  or  appointment  to  branch\r\n\r\ncommittees; and what is even more serious  is  the\r\n\r\nreal  intention of the employers, and that is,  to\r\n\r\nbreak  the  faith and confidence of the  rank  and\r\n\r\nfile members in the trade union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would ask the Labour Ministry and the NTUC to\r\n\r\nmake  a  close scrutiny of management's rights  of\r\n\r\nretrenchment  which, in practice,  can  camouflage\r\n\r\nother  insidious intentions, and we  hope  to  see\r\n\r\npositive results ensuing.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the fact that some employers are\r\n\r\ntaking  advantage of the labour laws  against  the\r\n\r\nworkers  and union leaders by retrenching them  so\r\n\r\nas  to  weaken the union, I would suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour to deprive the employers  of\r\n\r\nthe  right to dismiss or retrench their employees.\r\n\r\nThe   employers  must  negotiate  with  the  union\r\n\r\nleaders  before  any dismissal or retrenchment  of\r\n\r\nany  employees.  In  fairness to  the  workers,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that the Employment Act and the Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  Act should be amended so that employers\r\n\r\nhave  no right to dismiss or retrench any employee\r\n\r\nunless they negotiate with the union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to comment on three provisions in the Bill to\r\n\r\namend the Employment Act. The provisions relate to\r\n\r\nthe  amendment  of sections 14 and  38  and  Parts\r\n\r\nVIII, IX and X of the Employment Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to make it clear right from the\r\n\r\nvery  beginning that I am wholly in favour of  the\r\n\r\nproposed   amendments.  Some   of   the   proposed\r\n\r\nprovisions,  however, do not seem  to  have  fully\r\n\r\ndealt  with  every  aspect of  the  matters  under\r\n\r\namendment; and it is with regard to some of  these\r\n\r\naspects that I wish to seek clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of clause 2 of the Bill, touching\r\n\r\nupon   section  14  of  the  Employment  Act,   is\r\n\r\napparently to bring the Employment Act  into  line\r\n\r\nwith the Industrial Relations Act, as the proposed\r\n\r\nprovisions  are  substantially  the  same  as  the\r\n\r\ncorresponding provisions in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsection 35 of the Industrial Relations Act.  I  am\r\n\r\ninclined  to  agree that there is a need  for  the\r\n\r\nproposed  provisions.  Under  Part  XVI   of   the\r\n\r\nEmployment Act, a machinery has been provided  for\r\n\r\nthe   Commissioner  of  Labour  to  inquire   into\r\n\r\ndisputes  between  employers and their  employees.\r\n\r\nBut  if,  in  the  process of  so  inquiring,  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  is  convinced that an  employee  has\r\n\r\nbeen  dismissed without just cause or excuse,  the\r\n\r\nonly remedy the Commissioner is empowered to apply\r\n\r\nto  the  wrongfully dismissed employee is monetary\r\n\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any sum of money, of course, is useful when a\r\n\r\nperson  is out of work but is no compensation  for\r\n\r\nthe loss of a steady career, for which he may have\r\n\r\nalready  spent  half  his  working  life.  It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  only  fair  and  equitable   that   an\r\n\r\nemployee  who  has  been found  to  be  wrongfully\r\n\r\ndismissed  should be allowed to have his  old  job\r\n\r\nback,   wherever   possible.   Reinstatement    in\r\n\r\nemployment is, however, a statutory remedy and  up\r\n\r\nto  now the Minister has the power to reinstate  a\r\n\r\nperson   in   his   former  employment   only   if\r\n\r\nproceedings  for  such  reinstatement  have   been\r\n\r\ninitiated   through  a  trade  union   under   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In giving my support to the proposal to\r\n\r\nincorporate into the Employment Act the  power  of\r\n\r\nreinstatement  by the Minister, I am  particularly\r\n\r\nstruck by two aspects of the proposal. One is that\r\n\r\nany   employee   who  considers  himself   to   be\r\n\r\nwrongfully dismissed may apply to the Minister for\r\n\r\nreinstatement regardless of whether or not he is a\r\n\r\nmember  of  a trade union which has been  accorded\r\n\r\nrecognition by the employer. The other is that the\r\n\r\nMinister  may  have  recourse  to  the  well-tried\r\n\r\nmachinery  of the Labour Court for the purpose  of\r\n\r\nascertaining  the  facts of any  dismissal  before\r\n\r\nmaking a decision thereon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my humble opinion, however, that the\r\n\r\nproposed  provisions  may be strengthened  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of employees. I wish to suggest that  the\r\n\r\nproposed  section  14 (2) of  the  Employment  Act\r\n\r\nshould  have  the words \"whether with  or  without\r\n\r\nnotice\" to qualify any dismissal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  respect of which the Minister may be requested\r\n\r\nto  intervene. It must not be forgotten that under\r\n\r\nthe  Employment Act, a notice of not more than two\r\n\r\nweeks  is required for the termination of  service\r\n\r\nof an employee with less than five years' service.\r\n\r\nAn employer would have to be exceedingly foolhardy\r\n\r\nto  refuse  to  give such two weeks' notice  which\r\n\r\nwould free him from any anxiety in relation to the\r\n\r\nproposed provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of clauses 4 to 18 of the Bill,\r\n\r\ndealing  with Parts VIII and IX of the  Employment\r\n\r\nAct, apparently seeks to strengthen the provisions\r\n\r\nsafeguarding    young    children    from    undue\r\n\r\nexploitation by unscrupulous employers. Of late it\r\n\r\nhas become increasingly noticeable that employers,\r\n\r\nwith  bank  statements for their conscience,  have\r\n\r\nbeen  engaging children of tender years at a small\r\n\r\nwage  to  perform work which is unsuited to  their\r\n\r\ncapacity  and which taxes their physical  strength\r\n\r\nbeyond  endurance and reason. For such  employers,\r\n\r\nof  course,  the attraction of employing  children\r\n\r\nlies  in the fact that the children are too  young\r\n\r\nto know better or to be able to fight for a better\r\n\r\ndeal.  The  savings  that  can  be  had  by   such\r\n\r\nemployers through evading their liabilities  under\r\n\r\nthe  Employment Act and the Central Provident Fund\r\n\r\nAct arc tremendous, but they make a mockery of all\r\n\r\nthe  statutory provisions enacted or  approved  by\r\n\r\nthis House for the benefit of workers in general\r\n\r\nand   the   protection  of  young   children,   in\r\n\r\nparticular.  The  proposed provisions,  therefore,\r\n\r\nmeet an urgent and grave need in that they will be\r\n\r\na  greater  and  more effective deterrent  against\r\n\r\nimproper employment of young children,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 of the Bill, amending the whole of Part\r\n\r\nX  of  the Employment Act, seeks to remove a  long\r\n\r\noutstanding  anomaly  in the statutory  provisions\r\n\r\ngoverning  the terms and conditions of workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. I should think that the removal of such\r\n\r\nan  anomaly is long overdue. Up to now only female\r\n\r\nworkmen  are  statutorily entitled  to  have  paid\r\n\r\nmaternity leave during their confinement, that is,\r\n\r\none month before and one month after. On the other\r\n\r\nhand,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother female employees, who are non-workmen,  such\r\n\r\nas  clerks, shop assistants, teachers and typists,\r\n\r\nare  not statutorily entitled to one single  day's\r\n\r\npaid  maternity  leave during  their  confinement.\r\n\r\nWhat  has  made  the situation more tolerable  for\r\n\r\nfemale  employees as a whole is that trade  unions\r\n\r\nhave   secured  paid  maternity  leave  for  their\r\n\r\nmembers and have incorporated such benefit into  a\r\n\r\ncollective   agreement,   and   that   enlightened\r\n\r\nemployers such as the Government and the Statutory\r\n\r\nBoard  have granted paid maternity leave to  their\r\n\r\nfemale  employees despite the strange omission  in\r\n\r\nthe  Employment Act. Nonetheless, there is a  real\r\n\r\nneed  for  the  proposed amendment  as  individual\r\n\r\nfemale employees, who arc non-workmen engaged by a\r\n\r\nfirm in the private sector without the benefit  of\r\n\r\nrepresentation  by a trade union, would  otherwise\r\n\r\nhave  no  cause  for complaint if their  employers\r\n\r\nrefuse to grant them paid maternity leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the restriction of paid maternity leave\r\n\r\nonly  to  female employees with not more than  two\r\n\r\nliving children, I agree that such restriction  is\r\n\r\nrational   in  accordance  with  the  Government's\r\n\r\navowed  policy or restricting the size of families\r\n\r\nin Singapore. Since the ideal size of a family has\r\n\r\nbeen widely and recently mooted as that consisting\r\n\r\nof  the  two  parents  themselves  and  their  two\r\n\r\nchildren,  it makes sense not to offer  incentives\r\n\r\nfor employees to have more than two children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (in Mandarin):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the introduction of this amendment Bill  is,\r\n\r\nin  my opinion, very timely in the present context\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. These amendments will  ensure  that\r\n\r\nour  workers will have better care and  protection\r\n\r\nof  the  law.  This  is  a  progressive  piece  of\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it cannot be denied that in the past few\r\n\r\nyears  industrial  relations  in  Singapore   have\r\n\r\nimproved  considerably. The number of strikes  has\r\n\r\nbeen reduced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvisibly  and  most, if not all, of the  industrial\r\n\r\ndisputes have been referred to the Labour Ministry\r\n\r\nor the Industrial Arbitration Court for reasonable\r\n\r\nor  peaceful settlement. This is something that is\r\n\r\nvery encouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this amendment Bill there are also provisions\r\n\r\nwhich  are favourable to the workers, particularly\r\n\r\nthe   female  employees.  There  is  a   clear-cut\r\n\r\nprovision  in  the law to ensure that  all  female\r\n\r\nemployees in Singapore will enjoy equal rights. Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  I  am  referring to the  maternity  leave\r\n\r\nbenefits  which will be extended from  the  female\r\n\r\nworkmen  to  all female employees.  This  is  only\r\n\r\nright  and proper, because more and more women  in\r\n\r\nentering  the  labour market are  engaged  in  the\r\n\r\nfactories. According to my estimate, about 30  per\r\n\r\ncent of the workers in Singapore are female. So it\r\n\r\nis  only  reasonable  that  all  female  employees\r\n\r\nshould enjoy the same rights and benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, several Members of the House\r\n\r\nhave spoken on this Bill. They have touched on the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  wrongful dismissal  and  the  remedy\r\n\r\navailable to workers who are wrongfully dismissed.\r\n\r\nThey  have  suggested that there should be  proper\r\n\r\ninquiries to ascertain whether a worker  has  been\r\n\r\nwrongfully  dismissed, and, if so, to ensure  that\r\n\r\nsuch a worker is reinstated. But it is not easy to\r\n\r\nfind  out  whether  a worker has  been  wrongfully\r\n\r\ndismissed  or  not.  In my view  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour, which is now suffering from a shortage  of\r\n\r\nstaff,   will   find  it  difficult   to   conduct\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  inquiries  into  such  cases.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour must have adequate  staff  to\r\n\r\nensure that proper inquiries are conducted, before\r\n\r\nthey  can submit their report to the Minister.  If\r\n\r\nthere  is  shortage of staff in  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour, delay is inevitable or the inquiry may  be\r\n\r\ninadequate. This may result in the worker  who  is\r\n\r\nwrongfully dismissed not being able to  enjoy  the\r\n\r\nfull protection of the law, and thereby could lose\r\n\r\nhis  employment  because of such  inadequacies.  I\r\n\r\nwould   therefore  like  to  remind  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned that more officers should be engaged  to\r\n\r\nconduct these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninquiries  to  ensure effective implementation  of\r\n\r\nthe provisions in the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all the\r\n\r\narguments  put  forward by the Members  for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah  and  Bukit  Ho Swee had  been  gone  into\r\n\r\nthoroughly in 1968 when the present Employment Act\r\n\r\nwas  passed  in this House. Therefore,  I  do  not\r\n\r\npropose to repeat the arguments put forward by the\r\n\r\nGovernment then, as I think the various points  of\r\n\r\nview have been fully aired both inside and outside\r\n\r\nthis Parliament. Suffice it to say, as a result of\r\n\r\nthe  passing of the Employment Act in 1968,  there\r\n\r\nhas  been rapid economic development and  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  able to attract investments to this  country\r\n\r\nand  to solve what was at one time regarded as the\r\n\r\ninsoluble  problem of unemployment  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nToday,  we  need to have a favourable climate  for\r\n\r\neconomic development. We also need investments  as\r\n\r\nmuch as in 1968. For these reasons, the Employment\r\n\r\nAct will have to remain with us for a long time to\r\n\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there have been criticisms against the\r\n\r\nshortcomings  of the Employment Act,  nevertheless\r\n\r\nin   the   overall  interest  of  rapid   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and  in the overall interest  of  our\r\n\r\npeople, we cannot disband overnight the Employment\r\n\r\nAct  which was introduced in 1968. What we can  do\r\n\r\nis  to  ensure that the kind of situations brought\r\n\r\nup  by the Members for Telok Blangah and Bukit  Ho\r\n\r\nSwee  will be prevented or rectified whenever they\r\n\r\noccur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has objected to the\r\n\r\nprovision whereby a non-unionised worker can  make\r\n\r\nrepresentation  to  the  Minister   for   wrongful\r\n\r\ndismissal.  I am rather surprised that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Telok  Blangah should adopt  such  a  selfish\r\n\r\nattitude.

Perhaps  the  Minister  was  not\r\n\r\nlistening. Let me repeat and quote the exact  text\r\n\r\nof what I have said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We in the NTUC have in the past always regarded\r\n\r\na  worker,  who is eligible to seek membership  in\r\n\r\nthe union but who refrains from joining the union,\r\n\r\nas a parasite to our society.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>These  are the people I want to be kept  out;  not any employee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> In other words, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  he  has admitted that there are sections  of\r\n\r\nworkers  which cannot be unionised, and  therefore\r\n\r\nthey  need  the protection of this provision.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  domestic servants and the large  number\r\n\r\nof  construction workers, contract workers, and so\r\n\r\non.  Obviously  they need the protection  of  this\r\n\r\nprovision in the Amendment Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Telok Blangah has dealt at\r\n\r\nlength  with  the procedure under  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations   Act   regarding   representations   of\r\n\r\nwrongful dismissal. Under the provision of section\r\n\r\n35  (2)  of  the Industrial Relations Act,  if  an\r\n\r\nemployee  considers  that he  has  been  dismissed\r\n\r\nwithout  just cause or excuse by his employer,  he\r\n\r\nmay  make representation through his union to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for reinstatement. The representation  is\r\n\r\nfirst  referred  to  the  Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nSection to be dealt with on a conciliation  basis,\r\n\r\nand the employer concerned is asked to furnish  in\r\n\r\nwriting  the circumstances leading to, and grounds\r\n\r\nfor,   the   dismissal.  If,  in   this   informal\r\n\r\npreliminary  inquiry, a prima  facie  case  is  not\r\n\r\nestablished  by the union, then, of  course,  such\r\n\r\nrepresentation  will  be  rejected.  But  if   the\r\n\r\ninformal  inquiry reveals that the  management  is\r\n\r\npartly in the wrong, then efforts will be made  to\r\n\r\nget  the parties through ex parte consultation  to\r\n\r\nsettle the case either by reinstatement or by cash\r\n\r\ncompensation.  If  no  settlement  is  reached  by\r\n\r\nconciliation,  the representation  will  be  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  either  under section 35  (3),  whereby  the\r\n\r\nMinister  directs the Commissioner for  Labour  to\r\n\r\nhold a formal inquiry and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  make recommendations to the Minister; or under\r\n\r\nsection 35 (4) where the employer is asked to make\r\n\r\nwritten submissions to the Minister to justify his\r\n\r\naction to dismiss the employee concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as many of the representations are\r\n\r\nstraightforward,  the procedures  adopted  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour have proved to be effective and\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.  This is borne out by the  following\r\n\r\nfacts.    Since    15th    August,    1968,    109\r\n\r\nrepresentations  have  been  received.   Of   this\r\n\r\nnumber, 24 representations were rejected, 52  were\r\n\r\nsettled by conciliation, 23 were withdrawn by  the\r\n\r\nunion,  three  are currently under  consideration,\r\n\r\nand  a  total of seven cases were disposed  of  by\r\n\r\nMinisterial   orders,  directing  four   dismissed\r\n\r\nemployees to be reinstated and three employers  to\r\n\r\npay  compensation to three dismissed employees.  A\r\n\r\ntotal  of  three formal inquiries were  also  held\r\n\r\nunder  order  of the Minister. It is to  he  noted\r\n\r\nthat each formal inquiry took no less than two and\r\n\r\na  half  months for hearings to be completed.  The\r\n\r\ncurrent  procedure  of first  dealing  with  union\r\n\r\nrepresentation  by  means  of  conciliation   has,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  proved  to  be  both  expeditious  and\r\n\r\nsatisfactory. This same procedure will be  adopted\r\n\r\nin  respect of representations made under the  new\r\n\r\namended section 14 of the Employment Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government does not\r\n\r\ncontemplate amending the relevant sections of  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Act at the moment,  nor  does\r\n\r\nit  intend to accept the suggestions made  by  the\r\n\r\nhon. Members in respect of representations by non-unionised  employees  for  wrongful  dismissal.  A\r\n\r\nformal  hearing, which is not only  time-consuming\r\n\r\nbut also involves the full-time services of a good\r\n\r\nnumber  of  Government officers,  should  only  be\r\n\r\nresorted  to  when  a prima facie  case  has  been\r\n\r\nestablished   and  when  all  other   conciliatory\r\n\r\nefforts have failed to settle the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Ong Pang Boon].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Central Provident Fund Act\r\n\r\nwas  enacted  in  1955  to  provide  employees  in\r\n\r\nSingapore with a compulsory savings scheme so that\r\n\r\nthey  will have some savings when they retire from\r\n\r\nactive work. Since then, the Fund has grown from a\r\n\r\nmembership of 180,000 with accumulated savings  of\r\n\r\n$9  million  to  more than 911,000  members  whose\r\n\r\ntotal balance amounts to $1,500 million at the end\r\n\r\nof  June  1973.  The Fund is also  fulfilling  two\r\n\r\nimportant  social  functions. Firstly,  under  its\r\n\r\napproved   housing  scheme  introduced  in   1968,\r\n\r\nmembers are permitted to use their CPF credits  to\r\n\r\npurchase  Housing and Development Board fiats.  At\r\n\r\nthe   end  of  June  1973,  32,727  members   have\r\n\r\nwithdrawn $119 million for this purpose. Secondly,\r\n\r\nit  is an institution for national savings and  is\r\n\r\none  of  the most important sources of  funds  for\r\n\r\nGovernment development projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one unhealthy and unfortunate\r\n\r\ndevelopment  that accompanies the  growth  of  the\r\n\r\nFund,  namely,  a  corresponding increase  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  infringements and offences  under  the\r\n\r\nAct. This is especially true whenever the rate  of\r\n\r\ncontribution   is  raised.  In  1968,   when   the\r\n\r\nemployer/employee  combined rate  of  contribution\r\n\r\nwas   13   per   cent,  only  42  employers   were\r\n\r\nsuccessfully   prosecuted   for   non-payment   of\r\n\r\ncontributions and more than $114,000 collected  as\r\n\r\ninterest  on  late  payments. In  1972,  when  the\r\n\r\ncombined rate of contribution was raised to 24 per\r\n\r\ncent, the number of employers prosecuted increased\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n653  and interest on late payments also jumped  to $642,000.  For the first six months of this  year, 314  employers  have been successfully  prosecuted\r\n\r\nand   $790,000  collected  as  interest  on   late\r\n\r\npayments.  As the rates of contribution have  been\r\n\r\nfurther increased from 1st July this year,  it  is\r\n\r\nenvisaged  that  the number of  infringements  and\r\n\r\noffences  will  also increase,  unless  steps  are\r\n\r\ntaken  to check this tendency. This is one of  the\r\n\r\nmain objectives which the Bill hopes to achieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the aims of this Bill are given\r\n\r\nin  the  Explanatory Statement. I will, therefore,\r\n\r\nonly concentrate on the more important provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Provident Fund Board is facing some\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in enforcing the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident Fund Act because of its limited\r\n\r\npowers.  At  present, officers of  the  Board  are\r\n\r\nunable  to  deal effectively with the  problem  of\r\n\r\nevasion of CPF contributions, as the Act does  not\r\n\r\nprovide   specific  statutory  powers  to  require\r\n\r\nemployers to produce contracts of service,  salary\r\n\r\naccount  books, registers and such other documents\r\n\r\nrelating  to  the  employment of their  employees.\r\n\r\nClause  4 of the Bill, therefore, seeks to provide\r\n\r\nofficers of the Board with the necessary statutory\r\n\r\npowers to deal with this problem and to strengthen\r\n\r\nthe Board's enforcement machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is also concerned over the problem of\r\n\r\nlate  payments which is mainly due to the existing\r\n\r\nlow penalties. Currently, an employer who pays CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  late can be charged interest  of  1\r\n\r\nper  cent  per month on the amount of contribution\r\n\r\ndue  or  $1  whichever is greater.  This  rate  of\r\n\r\ninterest   of  1  per  cent  per  month   is   not\r\n\r\nsufficiently   deterrent   to   encourage   prompt\r\n\r\npayment,  while  the  minimum  penalty  of  $1  is\r\n\r\nadministratively  unenforceable  since  a   simple\r\n\r\nregistered  letter  of demand costs  75  cents  in\r\n\r\npostage alone, and many employers simply refuse to\r\n\r\npay, knowing that the Central Provident Fund Board\r\n\r\nis  unlikely to take criminal proceedings for such\r\n\r\na small sum. Clause 7 of the Bill will, therefore,\r\n\r\nincrease the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrate  of interest on late payment to 1 1/2 per cent\r\n\r\nper  month  with  a minimum penalty  of  $5.  This\r\n\r\ninterest will be charged on a daily basis  instead\r\n\r\nof  on  a  monthly  basis in  order  to  encourage\r\n\r\nemployers  to  pay  up  promptly  as,  under   the\r\n\r\nexisting  provision, an employer is penalised  the\r\n\r\nsame amount irrespective of whether he is late  by\r\n\r\none day or one month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more serious problem is where an employer has\r\n\r\ndeducted CPF contributions from the wages  of  his\r\n\r\nemployees  but  fails to pay  them  to  the  Fund.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  the  maximum  penalties  for  such  an\r\n\r\noffence  are $500 for a first offence  and  $2,000\r\n\r\nfor   a  second  and  subsequent  offence.  Though\r\n\r\nconsidered to be sufficiently deterrent  when  the\r\n\r\nAct   was  first  introduced  in  1955,  when  the\r\n\r\ncombined rate of CPF contribution was only 10  per\r\n\r\ncent  subject to a maximum of $50 per month, these\r\n\r\npenalties are now manifestly inadequate especially\r\n\r\nwhen  the combined rate of contributions has  just\r\n\r\nbeen raised to 26 per cent from 1st July, 1973, in\r\n\r\nrespect  of employees earning more than  $200  per\r\n\r\nmonth. The maximum monthly contribution payable by\r\n\r\nboth   employers  and  employees  has  also   been\r\n\r\nincreased to $225 and $165 respectively, and there\r\n\r\nis no limit on CPF contributions on bonuses. Large\r\n\r\nemployers of labour will be very tempted to  delay\r\n\r\npayment  of  CPF  contributions  which  have  been\r\n\r\ndeducted  from  employees' salaries,  and  utilise\r\n\r\nthis  money  for  other purposes. This,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nhappened in the case of four Chinese bus companies\r\n\r\nprior  to and immediately after the reorganisation\r\n\r\nof the public transport system in April 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6, therefore, provides that where an\r\n\r\nemployer  has deducted CPF contributions from  the\r\n\r\nwages  of  his  employees but fails  to  pay  such\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  the Fund within  the  stipulated\r\n\r\ntime,  the employer is liable on conviction  to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum fine of $10,000 or to imprisonment  up  to\r\n\r\nseven   years,   or   to  both   such   fine   and\r\n\r\nimprisonment.  The interest of the employees  will\r\n\r\nbe further protected by clause 16 which enables\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Board to lay claims on the proceeds from  the\r\n\r\nsale of any property of an employer seized under a\r\n\r\nwrit of seizure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendments proposed in\r\n\r\nclauses  5  and 10 are significant  as  they  will\r\n\r\nempower  the  Board to make rules prescribing  the\r\n\r\nmanner  in  which interest should  be  calculated.\r\n\r\nThis  will  enable the Board to take into  account\r\n\r\nlate payments of contributions as though they were\r\n\r\nnot late so that the employees concerned would not\r\n\r\nsuffer  a  loss  of interest. The amendments  also\r\n\r\nenable  the Board, if circumstances permit in  the\r\n\r\nfuture, to credit interest to members of the  Fund\r\n\r\nat  half-yearly or quarterly intervals instead  of\r\n\r\nthe present yearly intervals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment that deserves mention is\r\n\r\ncontained  in clause 11. At present, a member  who\r\n\r\nhas  withdrawn from the Fund at the age of 55  and\r\n\r\ncarries  on  working cannot withdraw  again  until\r\n\r\nfive  years  later. This may cause  some  hardship\r\n\r\nespecially  if the member is subsequently  out  of\r\n\r\njob.  Clause  11 will now permit him  to  withdraw\r\n\r\nagain  if  he has been unemployed for a period  of\r\n\r\nsix months immediately preceding the date he makes\r\n\r\nan application for a further withdrawal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to ensure that all employees enjoy the\r\n\r\nbenefits of CPF and employers are prompt in making\r\n\r\nCPF  payments, it is necessary to arm officers  of\r\n\r\nthe  Central Provident Fund Board with  sufficient\r\n\r\nstatutory   powers  to  carry  out  their   duties\r\n\r\neffectively  and to provide for stiffer  penalties\r\n\r\nagainst recalcitrant employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.14 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I see it,\r\n\r\nthis   Bill  which  seeks  to  amend  the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund Act is intended to give more  teeth\r\n\r\nto  the principal Act. As such, the amendments can\r\n\r\nbenefit  workers in general. I have no  hesitation\r\n\r\nin  giving  my support to it. However,  there  are\r\n\r\nsome provisions upon which I wish to comment on in\r\n\r\nsome detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill, introducing a new section\r\n\r\n4A  into  the principal Act, is, in my opinion,  a\r\n\r\ntimely  and  necessary provision, as  the  persons\r\n\r\ncharged  with  enforcing the  principal  Act  have\r\n\r\napparently encountered unnecessary difficulties in\r\n\r\nthe  absence  of  the proposed  provisions.  Human\r\n\r\nnature  being  what  it is, it  is  probable  that\r\n\r\nofficers  of  the  CPF Board, or the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour  for that matter, may have received  either\r\n\r\ndownright  evasive  replies  or  outright  hostile\r\n\r\nsilence from persons to whom their enquiries  have\r\n\r\nbeen directed. Under the prevailing law, there  is\r\n\r\nno  legal  obligation for such persons to  produce\r\n\r\ndocumentary  records  or  to  be  frank  with  the\r\n\r\ninvestigating  officers.  In  that  respect,   the\r\n\r\nproposed provisions should, by helping to make  it\r\n\r\nmore   difficult  for  employers  to  evade  their\r\n\r\nobligations under the principal Act, be  of  great\r\n\r\nservice to workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the proposed provisions, however, may\r\n\r\npose  a  threat  to  the peace of  mind  of  small\r\n\r\nemployers, particularly the employers of  domestic\r\n\r\nhelp,  whether on a full-time or part-time  basis.\r\n\r\nBut  before some snide remarks are made about  the\r\n\r\naffluence  of Singapore workers who  are  able  to\r\n\r\nafford domestic help, let me hasten to add that  a\r\n\r\nworking  couple  with one or two children,  living\r\n\r\ncompletely  on their own in a Housing Board  fiat,\r\n\r\nwithout  the benefit of the service of in-laws  or\r\n\r\nthe  cheap  service of a creche,  have  to  employ\r\n\r\ndomestic  help out of sheer necessity -  that  is,\r\n\r\nwork   permits   from  the  Ministry   of   Labour\r\n\r\npermitting.  In  such  a  case,  even  though  the\r\n\r\nhusband may be the official employer in the  sense\r\n\r\nthat he may be so described for the purpose of the\r\n\r\nprincipal  Act  or any other statutory  enactment,\r\n\r\nthe actual or real employer may be the wife in the\r\n\r\nsense  that she may be the one who deals with  the\r\n\r\nremuneration and decides the terms and  conditions\r\n\r\nof service for the domestic help. I trust that the\r\n\r\nintention of the proposed provisions is  to  catch\r\n\r\nout employers of large labour force rather than to\r\n\r\ncapitalise on any misunderstanding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween husband and wife in relation  to  the\r\n\r\nemployment of their domestic help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 6 of the Bill, a new subsection (3) has\r\n\r\nbeen  added  to  section 6 of the  principal  Act,\r\n\r\nwhich  provides that a heavy penalty is liable  to\r\n\r\nbe  imposed  on an employer who, after making  the\r\n\r\nrequisite  deductions from the pay packet  of  his\r\n\r\nemployees, forgets or refuses to remit the same to\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  Board. A vital distinction is made  from\r\n\r\nthe employer who fails to pay his own contribution\r\n\r\nunder  the  principal  Act within  the  prescribed\r\n\r\nperiod,  as  dealt with in clause 7 of  the  Bill,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  will comment upon later. The distinction\r\n\r\nis necessary, as the Minister has pointed out just\r\n\r\nnow,  as the sums of money deducted from the wages\r\n\r\nof the workers for payment to the CPF Board do not\r\n\r\nbelong to the employers but are only held in trust\r\n\r\nby  them. As such, the sums so deducted should not\r\n\r\nbe  retained  by employers for any  period  longer\r\n\r\nthan  is necessary, and any provision discouraging\r\n\r\nthem  from doing so is undeniably in the  interest\r\n\r\nof workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same clause 6 of the Bill, the proposed\r\n\r\nsubsections  (1)  and  (2) of  section  6  of  the\r\n\r\nprincipal  Act are substantially a rehash  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting provisions and are apparently intended to\r\n\r\naccommodate new circumstances which may arise from\r\n\r\nany  implementation of such recommendations of the\r\n\r\nNational Wages Council as the Government may  have\r\n\r\naccepted. One difficulty, however, is posed by the\r\n\r\ntime-lapse  between  the  effective  date  of  the\r\n\r\nincrease of CPF rates that is, in the case of this\r\n\r\nyear I per cent on 1st July, 1973 - and the actual\r\n\r\ndate  of  payment  of NWC's recommendations,  even\r\n\r\nthough  with retrospective effect. The  result  is\r\n\r\nthat  a  worker may suffer a cut in his  take-home\r\n\r\npay  because  of  the  increased  CPF's  rate   of\r\n\r\ncontribution  based  on  his  salary  without  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of any NWC's increment. An obvious  retort\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister would be that, even without  any\r\n\r\nNWC's   increment,  he  would  have  received   an\r\n\r\nincrease in pay by way of a higher sum credited to\r\n\r\nhis CPF account and that,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  he  is  a member of a trade union,  he  should\r\n\r\npress  his union not to procrastinate in the  hope\r\n\r\nof  a  greater  increment than what  the  NWC  has\r\n\r\nrecommended.  Sometimes,  however,  the  delay  in\r\n\r\nimplementing  the  NWC's  recommendations  is  not\r\n\r\noccasioned  by  either  the  trade  union  or  the\r\n\r\nemployer  but by complexities or peculiarities  of\r\n\r\nterms and conditions of service not considered  by\r\n\r\nthe NWC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point I want to make is to relate clause\r\n\r\n6  of  the  Bill to clause 10 of the Bill amending\r\n\r\nsection 10 of the principal Act which governs  the\r\n\r\npayment of interest on contributions credited with\r\n\r\nthe  CPF.  I  believe  that the  purpose  of  this\r\n\r\namendment  is to enable the CPF Board  to  compute\r\n\r\ninterest  on  a more conscionable basis  than  the\r\n\r\npresent  yearly basis, which is manifestly unjust.\r\n\r\nCharge  them interest every month. We welcome  it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the Post Office Savings Bank\r\n\r\nis  able  to compute interest on voluntary savings\r\n\r\non  a  monthly basis. I should think the CPF Board\r\n\r\nshould  be  able to do so similarly on  compulsory\r\n\r\nsavings    of   workers.   With   the   additional\r\n\r\nconsideration  of clause 7 of the  Bill,  amending\r\n\r\nsection 7 of the principal Act, which provides for\r\n\r\nthe  payment of an enhanced penalty in respect  of\r\n\r\ncontributions which are belated by even  one  day,\r\n\r\nany  decision by the CPF Board to compute interest\r\n\r\nat  an  interval  longer than  one  month  clearly\r\n\r\nsmacks   of  profiteering  under  the   guise   of\r\n\r\nbureaucratic  inefficiency.  The  CPF   wants   to\r\n\r\ncollect  1 1/2  per  cent  every  month  from   the\r\n\r\nemployer. Pay some to the employees as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, clause 11 of the Bill has introduced a\r\n\r\nnew paragraph (c) to subsection (2) of section  11\r\n\r\nof  the  principal Act by providing for the  large\r\n\r\ncategory of Malaysian workers who are employed  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and who have CPF contributions  credited\r\n\r\nto  their respective accounts while so employed in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  proposed  provision  enables  the\r\n\r\nBoard  to  permit such workers to  withdraw  their\r\n\r\ncontributions  in certain circumstances  on  their\r\n\r\ndeparture from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore for good. Co-ordination perhaps with the\r\n\r\nWork  Permit Office and other relevant departments\r\n\r\nwould serve to ascertain whether the departure  of\r\n\r\nsuch  workers  from  Singapore  is  permanent   or\r\n\r\notherwise. Difficulty may he met by the CPF  Board\r\n\r\nin trying to trace the whereabouts of such workers\r\n\r\ntwenty  or  thirty  years  after  they  have  left\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the above comments, I repeat that I am\r\n\r\nwholly in favour of the proposed amendments to the\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident Fund Act but would request  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to  compute  interest   on   a   more\r\n\r\nconscionable  basis, and that  is,  on  a  monthly\r\n\r\nbasis like the Post Office Savings Bank is doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  purpose of the Central  Provident  Fund\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill is to make the implementation  of\r\n\r\nthe  principal  Act  more effective  in  order  to\r\n\r\nbenefit  all  the workers. This  is  a  very  good\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister in his speech mentioned that\r\n\r\nthe  total  deposit  in the CPF  has  now  reached\r\n\r\n$1,500 million with a membership of 911,000.  This\r\n\r\nis  very  significant. I would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister a few questions. Firstly, since  the  CPF\r\n\r\nBoard has this large sum of money totalling $1,500\r\n\r\nmillion,  in  what way will the  CPF  invest  this\r\n\r\nmoney and what benefit or interest will be derived\r\n\r\nfrom the investment every year?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, is the CPF Board prepared to raise the\r\n\r\ninterest rate so that all the 911,000 members  can\r\n\r\nenjoy better benefits?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as we all know, the CPF Board is now\r\n\r\nconstructing a new building. I would like  to  ask\r\n\r\nwhere  does  the  money for this building  project\r\n\r\ncome  from.  Does it come from the  Government  or\r\n\r\nfrom the Fund itself?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a suggestion to make to the Minister. For\r\n\r\na  long time, the rules of the CPF stipulate  that\r\n\r\nonly members of the Fund who read 55\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears  of  age  and  retiring  are  qualified   to\r\n\r\nwithdraw their contributions from the CPF. But  in\r\n\r\nmy  constituency there are certain people who  are\r\n\r\nfaced  with  financial difficulties  because  they\r\n\r\nhave  been  retrenched  and  have  retired  before\r\n\r\nreaching  55  years of age. So they have  a  great\r\n\r\nneed for funds. Therefore, they applied to the CPF\r\n\r\nfor  a  withdrawal of funds or at  least  part  of\r\n\r\ntheir  contributions to repair their houses  which\r\n\r\nare dilapidated, and for other purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Teong, can you confine your debate\r\n\r\nto  the  principle of this Bill and not go outside\r\n\r\nits scope, please?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to suggest to the Minister that those members\r\n\r\nwho retire before reaching the age of 55 should be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  withdraw their CPF contributions  for\r\n\r\nvalid reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  assure the Member for Telok Blangah that it is\r\n\r\nnot  the intention of this amendment Bill to catch\r\n\r\nthe  small  employers, the employer of a  domestic\r\n\r\nservant, for instance. The intention is really  to\r\n\r\ncatch the big employers of a large labour force. I\r\n\r\nam  quite sure the CPF inspectors will be able  to\r\n\r\nexercise  a  certain  amount  of  discretion  when\r\n\r\ndealing  with  employers of domestic servants  who\r\n\r\nfail  to  pay  CPF  contributions  for  a  genuine\r\n\r\nreason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the CPF Board has, in fact,\r\n\r\nconsidered  the possibility of computing  interest\r\n\r\nmonthly,   but   there   are   certain   technical\r\n\r\ndifficulties which it cannot overcome  as  yet  at\r\n\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

The CPF is not permitted  to\r\n\r\ninvest   in   other  more  profitable   commercial\r\n\r\nsecurities.  As the Government bond only  pays  an\r\n\r\ninterest  of  about 6 per cent, the CPF  therefore\r\n\r\ncannot pay an interest of more than 53/4 per cent.\r\n\r\nMuch  as the CPF would like to pay more, I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  it is possible. The quarter per cent earned\r\n\r\nby  CPF is used to pay for administrative expenses\r\n\r\nand  staff salaries.

Members may recall that on 11th April, 1971,\r\n\r\nthe  10 Chinese bus companies regrouped into three\r\n\r\ncompanies, namely, Amalgamated Bus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompany  (ABC), Associated Bus Service  (ABS)  and\r\n\r\nthe   United  Bus  Company  (UBC).  The  Singapore\r\n\r\nTraction Company (STC) was the fourth bus  company\r\n\r\nand  when  it ceased operation in December,  1971,\r\n\r\nits   routes  were  taken  over  by  these   three\r\n\r\ncompanies which in due course built up a fleet  of\r\n\r\nover 2,000 buses deployed in 143 bus routes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recent amalgamation of the three\r\n\r\ncompanies  into  a  single company  known  as  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Bus  Service  Ltd  (SBS),   which   we\r\n\r\nunderstand was registered on 11th July,  1973,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  necessary for the Bus Services Licensing\r\n\r\nAuthority to monitor closely the progress  of  the\r\n\r\nnew   company,  its  affairs  and  its   financial\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Bus Services Licensing Authority Act\r\n\r\nhas  provisions requiring bus companies to  submit\r\n\r\naudited accounts.

It  also provides three  exceptions  to\r\n\r\nliability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now summarise briefly the main provisions\r\n\r\nof  the Bill. Clause 3 provides that where oil  is\r\n\r\ndischarged  or escapes from any ship or  off-shore\r\n\r\nor  on-shore facility, the owner or operator shall\r\n\r\nbe  liable for any damage caused, for the cost  of\r\n\r\nany  measures taken to prevent the damage, and for\r\n\r\nany  damage  caused  by  the  measures  so  taken.\r\n\r\nHowever, a shipowner's liability for oil pollution\r\n\r\ndamage  is  limited to S$375 for each ton  of  the\r\n\r\nship's  tonnage or S$50 million (when the  tonnage\r\n\r\nresults in a greater amount).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for three exceptions to\r\n\r\nliability.  The  owner  or operator  will  not  be\r\n\r\nliable  if  he  proves that the oil escaped  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) an act of war or an act of God;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) wilful act of a third party;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) negligence of the Government or the Port of\r\n\r\nSingapore   Authority  (PSA)   in   maintaining\r\n\r\nnavigational aids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  is  only  equitable that  exception  (iii)  is\r\n\r\nincluded, for the PSA must be held responsible for\r\n\r\nproper  maintenance of navigational  aids  in  the\r\n\r\nPort.  In  cases where liability is not  based  on\r\n\r\nclause  3  but on common law, the Bill  gives  the\r\n\r\nright  to  recover  costs  of  measures  taken  to\r\n\r\nprevent oil pollution damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of Marine and the Port Master are\r\n\r\nempowered  to detain a ship suspected of polluting\r\n\r\nthe  sea and to require the owner to make  a  cash\r\n\r\ndeposit  or  other  security before  the  ship  is\r\n\r\nreleased.  The Bill, however, does  not  apply  to\r\n\r\nwarships  and  government  vessels  not  used  for\r\n\r\ncommercial purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule of the Bill will amend the\r\n\r\nPrevention of Pollution of the Sea Act, 1971,  and\r\n\r\nwill  raise the maximum penalty for oil  pollution\r\n\r\noffences  from S$20,000 to S$500,000. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, if this provision of the Bill would appear to\r\n\r\nbe  severe, it is because we regard the problem of\r\n\r\npollution  of the sea as a major problem requiring\r\n\r\nstrong measures for effective control. As our Port\r\n\r\nis  a  fairly busy one, it is vital that  adequate\r\n\r\nmeasures  are adopted to discourage the  pollution\r\n\r\nof our harbour, territorial waters and shore-lines\r\n\r\nby ships and shore establishments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a matter of\r\n\r\ninterest, I wonder whether the Minister  of  State\r\n\r\ncan  enlighten the House as to whether most of the\r\n\r\nmajor  maritime  nations  have  now  adopted   the\r\n\r\nagreement  reached at the International Convention\r\n\r\nat   Brussels  on  the  question  of   limits   of\r\n\r\nliability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> Sir, I have not got the\r\n\r\ninformation  with me.

Consequent to the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  and  problems  encountered  in   the\r\n\r\napplication and administration of the  Act  during\r\n\r\nthe last two years, the need has arisen to amplify\r\n\r\nthe  Act  to  ensure  better control  of  disease-bearing insects through more effective enforcement action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One major problem encountered relates to\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in  obtaining the names,  addresses,\r\n\r\nproof  of  identity and other relevant particulars\r\n\r\nof  occupiers and owners of premises. This  defect\r\n\r\nhas  hindered  the issue of orders  and  summonses\r\n\r\nconsiderably. Specific powers are now included  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  to  facilitate officers to obtain  such\r\n\r\ninformation  of  any offender or  suspect  and  to\r\n\r\narrest  such person without warrant if he declines\r\n\r\nto supply the required particulars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A device of \"ticketing\" is to be introduced in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  offences committed under the  Act  to\r\n\r\nempower officers to serve on offenders notices  to\r\n\r\nattend at the Court described, at a specified date\r\n\r\nand time, so that the Court may take cognizance of\r\n\r\nthe offences. The purpose of this provision is  to\r\n\r\nenable  more expeditious and effective enforcement\r\n\r\nof the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A presumption clause has now been introduced\r\n\r\nwhich  will have the effect of fixing on the owner\r\n\r\nor  occupier  the responsibility for any  premises\r\n\r\nconducive  to  the propagation of  disease-bearing\r\n\r\ninsects, unless the contrary is proved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term \"disease-bearing insect\" is now re-defined to include every specie of mosquitoes and\r\n\r\nhouse  flies.  This enables many potential  insect\r\n\r\nvectors to come under control and prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present provision, a medical officer is\r\n\r\nrequired  to  appear in Court for the  purpose  of\r\n\r\ngiving   evidence  to  prove  that  a   particular\r\n\r\nmosquito  or insect is, in fact, a disease-bearing\r\n\r\ninsect.  In order to eliminate this time-consuming\r\n\r\nprocedure, a provision is made in the Bill whereby\r\n\r\nreports  signed by any Medical Officer of  Health,\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEntomologist or Public Health Engineer  concerning\r\n\r\nany  matter  or  thing submitted for  examination,\r\n\r\nanalysis  or  report are admissible  in  Court  as\r\n\r\nconstituting prima facie evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other minor amendments to the Bill serve to\r\n\r\nspecify  and  define more explicitly the  existing\r\n\r\npowers of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Wee Toon Boon].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE SPORTS COUNCIL BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.26 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main purpose of the Bill, as found in\r\n\r\nthe  Explanatory  Statement, is to  establish  the\r\n\r\n\"Singapore  Sports Council\" which will  take  over\r\n\r\nthe  functions  of  the National Sports  Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard and the National Stadium Corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Sports Promotion Board came into\r\n\r\nbeing  with the coming into force of the  National\r\n\r\nSports  Promotion Board Act in February 1971,  and\r\n\r\nthe  National Stadium Corporation with the  coming\r\n\r\ninto force of the National Stadium Corporation Act\r\n\r\nin  November 1971. At that time, it was considered\r\n\r\nnecessary   that  there  should  be   a   separate\r\n\r\norganisation for the National Stadium which was at\r\n\r\nthe   initial  stages  of  its  construction.  The\r\n\r\nStadium  has now been completed and was officially\r\n\r\nopened  by our Prime Minister on 21st July,  1973.\r\n\r\nAt  this stage, it would not be economical to have\r\n\r\ntwo organisations concerned with the promotion  of\r\n\r\nsports  and  the  provision  of  recreational  and\r\n\r\nsports  facilities. The National Sports  Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  the promotion of sports  and  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  facilities.  The  National  Stadium\r\n\r\nComplex  will  be  the  main  sports  complex   in\r\n\r\nSingapore and would also be concerned with sports.\r\n\r\nThe time has now come for the two organisations to\r\n\r\nbe  amalgamated,  so  as to  achieve  the  maximum\r\n\r\nutilisation of staff, finance and facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With amalgamation, there would be a streamlined\r\n\r\nadministrative machinery, which would  result  not\r\n\r\nonly  in  a  considerable  amount  of  savings  in\r\n\r\nfinances on personal emoluments and office  space,\r\n\r\nbut  also in more efficient performance in  sports\r\n\r\npromotion.  In this connection, I wish to  mention\r\n\r\nthat  this new administrative machinery  will  pay\r\n\r\nparticular   attention   to   intra   and   inter-Constituency  games which form an  important  mass\r\n\r\nbase for the new \"sports for all\" national policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enactment of the Singapore Sports Council Act\r\n\r\nis in keeping with the new \"sports for all\" policy\r\n\r\nwhich the Government has embarked upon. Under this\r\n\r\npolicy,  the  aim would be towards achieving  good\r\n\r\nhealth, physical well-being, beneficial recreation\r\n\r\nand   better  spending  of  leisure  time  by  our\r\n\r\npopulation.  It also aims at raising the  standard\r\n\r\nof  sports so that it becomes an essential part of\r\n\r\nour  national life. In furtherance of this policy,\r\n\r\nthe objectives of this Council would be:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to improve the physical fitness standards of\r\n\r\nthe people of the Republic;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to encourage mass participation of the\r\n\r\npopulation in sports in the Republic;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to provide the people of the Republic with\r\n\r\nmaximum  facilities so as  to  enable  them  to\r\n\r\ncarry   out   their  sports  and   recreational\r\n\r\nactivities; and lastly,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to raise the standard of sports at all levels\r\n\r\nin the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various provisions of the Bill are geared\r\n\r\ntowards  achieving  these  objectives.  The   main\r\n\r\nfunctions, as contained in clause 8 of  the  Bill,\r\n\r\nare to plan and to promote, to co-ordinate and  to\r\n\r\ncooperate, to encourage and arrange sports,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngames  and  recreation and physical  education  in\r\n\r\nconjunction with the Ministry of Education and the\r\n\r\nSingapore  National Olympic Council  and  national\r\n\r\nsports  organisations. Some of the other functions\r\n\r\nare  to foster research and physical education and\r\n\r\nestablish   sports   stadia   and   other   sports\r\n\r\nfacilities as are deemed necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 9 of the Bill, the powers given to\r\n\r\nthe   Council  are  mainly  to  recommend  minimum\r\n\r\nstandards   for   participation  in  international\r\n\r\nsports, competitions and games; to advise  on  the\r\n\r\nplanning,  promotion  and  standards  of  physical\r\n\r\neducation;  to  raise funds;  to  make  grants  or\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  sports  organisations,  and  to\r\n\r\nconduct commercial and business ventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 refers to transfer to the Council of\r\n\r\nthe   undertakings   of   the   National   Stadium\r\n\r\nCorporation  and  the  National  Sports  Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard,  while clause 12 provides for the continued\r\n\r\nsecondment of Government employees of either Board\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  amalgamation and later  absorption\r\n\r\ninto  the service of the Council. It also provides\r\n\r\nin  clause 13 for non-Government employees  to  be\r\n\r\ntransferred.  Part  VI of the  Bill  provides  for\r\n\r\nfinancial matters. There is provision in the  Bill\r\n\r\nfor  the  Council to receive loans or grants  from\r\n\r\nboth   the  Government  and  the  private  sector,\r\n\r\nincluding  the Singapore Pools (Private)  Limited.\r\n\r\nOne  new  innovation in this Bill is that most  of\r\n\r\nthe  financial provisions are set out in  schedule\r\n\r\nform attached to it, and this has the advantage of\r\n\r\nshortening the Bill considerably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill does not confer authoritative powers nor\r\n\r\npowers  to  impose  sanctions  or  penalties  over\r\n\r\nnational sports associations or private clubs, nor\r\n\r\ndoes  it interfere with or usurp the functions  of\r\n\r\nrelevant   Ministries,  like   the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation.  The Singapore Sports Council  will  be\r\n\r\nthere to advise, encourage, coordinate and lead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that with the setting up of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Sports Council by the  amalgamation  of\r\n\r\nthe   National  Sports  Promotion  Board  and  the\r\n\r\nNational Stadium\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCorporation,  we  will  have  a  streamlined\r\n\r\norganisation made up of persons actively concerned\r\n\r\nwith  the promotion of sports, who would over  the\r\n\r\nyears he able to work together and build up a base\r\n\r\namong  the  masses,  a base that  would  give  the\r\n\r\nsupport necessary to bring about the popularity of\r\n\r\nsports. Whereas the Singapore Sports Council  will\r\n\r\nbe  involved in the running of sports and physical\r\n\r\neducation programmes, as well as the provision  of\r\n\r\nfacilities, the Ministry of Social Affairs will be\r\n\r\nactively concerned with policy direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I wish to emphasise that with the\r\n\r\nformation of the Singapore Sports Council, we  can\r\n\r\nlook forward to seeing that the main objective  of\r\n\r\npromoting  mass  participation  of  the  people-in\r\n\r\nsports  in  Singapore, as well as  bringing  about\r\n\r\nphysical  fitness of the population, so  essential\r\n\r\nto  security and productivity in Singapore,  would\r\n\r\nbe achieved in the years ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.34 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  in  support of the Singapore Sports  Council\r\n\r\nBill.   As  in  1971,  when  the  National  Sports\r\n\r\nPromotion Board Bill was introduced, there  is  an\r\n\r\nair  of  hope for sports in Singapore.  It  is  my\r\n\r\npersonal hope and wish that the air now is not the\r\n\r\nsame  as  the  air then. However, looking  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  set-up, I am confident that  the  present\r\n\r\nSingapore  Sports  Council  will  augur  well  for\r\n\r\nsports in Singapore in future. However, I would be\r\n\r\nfailing at this stage if I do not bring up  a  few\r\n\r\npoints which I think are worth noting. Some of the\r\n\r\nofficials  in the last few surviving  days-of  the\r\n\r\nNational   Sports   Promotion  Board,   who   were\r\n\r\nresponsible for some of the acts of mischief,  are\r\n\r\nstill very much with this new body and unless  the\r\n\r\nnew  officials who are in charge will  bear  their\r\n\r\nauthority upon these junior officials, I am afraid\r\n\r\nsome of the acts of mischief committed in the past\r\n\r\nmight be repeated in the new Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I notice that there is a definite\r\n\r\nshortage of staff in this big sports body. If that\r\n\r\nis  the problem, then I think if we do not enlarge\r\n\r\nthe  staff  we might be faced with more  problems.\r\n\r\nThirdly, I would like to comment on the efficiency\r\n\r\nand  leadership which was so markedly  lacking  in\r\n\r\nthe  last National Sports Promotion Board.  It  is\r\n\r\nour   hope  that  with  the  introduction  of  new\r\n\r\nofficials,  this noticeable lack of  qualities  in\r\n\r\nthe past will no longer be with us now and we look\r\n\r\nforward to able leadership in the Singapore Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure the Minister for\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs  that  my  colleagues  and  fellow\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament here who have in  the  past\r\n\r\nbrought  to light some of the unpleasant  problems\r\n\r\nwould join me in wishing this new Singapore Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil  all  the very best, and we  give  it  our\r\n\r\nfullest support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just a few\r\n\r\nwords  to thank the Member and his colleagues  for\r\n\r\nthe support which they are giving to the Bill.

Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill that is before the House seeks to\r\n\r\namend  the  Fisheries  Act  (Chapter  294  of  the\r\n\r\nRevised Edition) with a view to providing  a  more\r\n\r\nexemplary penalty for trawl-net fishing within the\r\n\r\nterritorial    waters   of   Singapore.    Trawler\r\n\r\noperations  of  late  have increased  to  such  an\r\n\r\nextent  that  they  are not merely  a  destructive\r\n\r\nnuisance   but  have  deprived  many   a   coastal\r\n\r\nfisherman  of  his  livelihood.  Furthermore  this\r\n\r\nmethod  of  fishing, whereby a vessel tows  a  net\r\n\r\nshaped  like  an  open bag, is to be  particularly\r\n\r\ncondemned because of the manner in which  immature\r\n\r\nand  unmarketable fish, prawns and other forms  of\r\n\r\nmarine  life  are  destroyed,  when  used  in  our\r\n\r\nshallow coastal waters. In addition to taking away\r\n\r\nalmost everything in its path, the trawl-net drags\r\n\r\naway  and destroys the fishing gear of our coastal\r\n\r\nfishermen  and breaks their lines and nets.  These\r\n\r\noperations  have  resulted in numerous  complaints\r\n\r\nbeing  made  to  the authorities,  and  despite  a\r\n\r\nseries  of raids carried out to apprehend trawlers\r\n\r\nfishing within our territorial waters, this method\r\n\r\nof fishing has not abated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members who are aware of this problem  have\r\n\r\nno doubt looked up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Fisheries   Act  only  to  find   that   the\r\n\r\nlegislation   has   provided   relatively    light\r\n\r\nsentences  for  such  offences.  This  is  because\r\n\r\ncoastal water trawling commenced only a few  years\r\n\r\nago  with only a few trawlers operating. But their\r\n\r\nnumbers  have  since  increased  sufficiently   to\r\n\r\nconstitute a problem. One of the main reasons  for\r\n\r\nthe increase of such activity is the fact that the\r\n\r\npenalties   imposed  by  the   courts   were   not\r\n\r\nsufficient  to  constitute a  deterrent,  so  that\r\n\r\nconvicted  trawler  men continued  to  repeat  the\r\n\r\noffence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to effectively prohibit this practice of\r\n\r\ntrawl-net  fishing within our coastal waters,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has decided to introduce the amendments\r\n\r\nnow  before  the House. Their main purpose  is  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  the  imposition of a  more  salutary\r\n\r\npunishment  upon  those found  guilty.  Under  the\r\n\r\nexisting  Act any person convicted of  an  offence\r\n\r\nunder  the  Act,  including  trawling  in  coastal\r\n\r\nwaters,  is liable to a fine not exceeding  $1,000\r\n\r\nor  to  a  term of imprisonment not exceeding  one\r\n\r\nyear  or  to both such fine and imprisonment.  The\r\n\r\ncourt  may  also  order the  confiscation  of  any\r\n\r\nvessel or appliance used in the commission of  the\r\n\r\noffence.  However,  in  practice,  none  of  those\r\n\r\nconvicted has so far been jailed and no vessel  or\r\n\r\nappliance has been confiscated. The Bill seeks  to\r\n\r\namend  the Act so that it shall he compulsory  for\r\n\r\nthe  courts  to  impose  on anybody  convicted  of\r\n\r\ninshore  trawling a mandatory term of imprisonment\r\n\r\nof  not  less than three months and not more  than\r\n\r\nthree years, without the option of a fine. It also\r\n\r\nprovides that the courts may make an order for the\r\n\r\nconfiscation  of  any vessel, net,  instrument  or\r\n\r\nappliance used in the commission of the offence on\r\n\r\nthe written application of the Public Prosecutor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill confers on police officers the\r\n\r\nsame  powers as fishery officers to stop,  search,\r\n\r\ndetain  and arrest any person found committing  or\r\n\r\nattempting  to  commit an offence under  the  Act.\r\n\r\nThis  will enable the Marine Police to assist  the\r\n\r\nPrimary Production\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment  more  effectively in  its  efforts  to\r\n\r\nstamp out coastal trawling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our hope that with these amendments to the\r\n\r\nFisheries  Act, a wasteful and destructive  method\r\n\r\nof  fishing  within  our territorial  waters  will\r\n\r\ncompletely  cease  or  at  least  be  reduced   to\r\n\r\nnegligible proportions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  wish to thank the Minister for introducing this\r\n\r\nBill.

I hope  the  Marine\r\n\r\nPolice  will  detail  more  boats  to  patrol  our\r\n\r\ncoastal  waters  so  as to prevent  these  illegal\r\n\r\ntrawlers from fishing in our coastal waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I am not in charge of the Marine\r\n\r\nPolice.
