No matter how much stress he has laid\r\n\r\nupon economy, the fact is that his Budget Statement is\r\n\r\ninvariably made in accordance with the desire of the Party in\r\n\r\npower to deal with the present situation. This is a point known\r\n\r\nto anybody who has some common sense in politics. This statement\r\n\r\nis used as a means of publicity whereby those things in which\r\n\r\nthe Government can take pride are highlighted in the speech.\r\n\r\nThose things that are annoying or are not so glorious will be\r\n\r\nmentioned less and less, or even not mentioned at all.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the past, such talk about the increase in the\r\n\r\nnational income, the rate of progress, prosperity and so on, has\r\n\r\ntaken up a lot of space in the speech of the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance. But the statement this year shows that his tone is\r\n\r\nbeginning to change. Although he has made a great effort to say\r\n\r\nthat there is still economic stability in the State, he has to\r\n\r\nadmit, whether he likes it or not, that the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nhas to meet for the first time a deficit. The so-called $15\r\n\r\nmillion surplus is no longer in existence. It is time for the\r\n\r\nGovernment, as it says, to think carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, those who have talked so well of Malaysia have\r\n\r\ntried their best to describe it as a small New York; that\r\n\r\nMalaysia is successful and so on. Just as a mirror reflects the\r\n\r\ntrue image of things, let us look at the facts. There is a great\r\n\r\ndeal of misery among the people. It is impossible for the Party\r\n\r\nin power to cover up the ugly facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I now wish to talk about the effects of\r\n\r\nconfrontation on our economy. Singapore has all along depended\r\n\r\non the entrepot trade economically. As a result of the\r\n\r\nIndonesian confrontation, there are great repercussions,\r\n\r\naccording to the Minister himself. The Indonesian confrontation\r\n\r\nis, however, not 100 per cent successful. There are still a lot\r\n\r\nof raw materials coming from a third country into Singapore.\r\n\r\nThat accounts for the not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso great decline in our trade. The so-called not 100 per cent\r\n\r\nsuccessful confrontation, in spite of what the Minister says,\r\n\r\nhas brought great losses in our trade. According to his figures.\r\n\r\nfor the first half-year, there was a decline of 31 per cent in\r\n\r\nour export trade. In respect of imports, the decline was 23 per\r\n\r\ncent. In the meantime, about 4,000 people are out of job. The\r\n\r\nMinister has also said that the increase in banking and building\r\n\r\nconstruction activities has, to some extent, reduced the effect\r\n\r\nof Indonesian confrontation. We do not wish to over-estimate the\r\n\r\neffects of the Indonesian confrontation. But we have to face it\r\n\r\nall the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance, in spite of what he says, has not\r\n\r\nbeen able to sketch to us the full extent of the Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation affecting our economy. I will tell him that\r\n\r\ndirectly or indirectly the effect of it is very great on the\r\n\r\ntrade and livelihood of the people. Under normal circumstances,\r\n\r\ntrade should increase instead of decrease. But now the fact is\r\n\r\nthat our trade is on the decline. The Minister tries to say that\r\n\r\nthe decline is only to the extent of 23 per cent in respect of\r\n\r\nimports and 31 per cent in respect of exports. He says that only\r\n\r\nabout 4,000 persons are out of job as a result of confrontation,\r\n\r\nbut this figure only includes those directly affected by the\r\n\r\nconfrontation. This figure does not include those who have been\r\n\r\nindirectly affected. The Minister should know that, at the\r\n\r\npresent moment, shops at large have not been doing so well in\r\n\r\ntheir business. Hawkers and retailers are suffering from a trade\r\n\r\nrecession. Their income has decreased considerably. Why is it\r\n\r\nthat the Minister has made no mention of these facts? He himself\r\n\r\nsays that there are some trades which have been affected by\r\n\r\nconfrontation, such as the entertainment business and so on. If\r\n\r\nthe people have to worry about their meals, do you think they\r\n\r\ncan afford to worry about entertainment? At night the shops in\r\n\r\nthe amusement parks are not doing any business at all. So \r\n\r\nunder-employment and under-nutrition have put a lot of poor people and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsmall traders in difficulties. So faced with the difficulties\r\n\r\nand disasters brought about by the Indonesian confrontation, it\r\n\r\nis useless to try to put the blame of our failure on Indonesia\r\n\r\nand try to find a scapegoat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pro-Malaysian Parties are duty bound to solve these\r\n\r\nproblems. Before the problem of Malaysia is solved politically,\r\n\r\nthe Government should find ways and means to assist the\r\n\r\nlightermen and others who are directly or indirectly affected by\r\n\r\nthis stoppage of barter trade and other trades. Those\r\n\r\nbusinessmen engaged in the barter trade should be given\r\n\r\nassistance. But the Government has not tried to shoulder part of\r\n\r\nthe responsibility. At the present moment, it is trying to\r\n\r\ndepend too much on the building construction trade to try to\r\n\r\ncancel off some of the effects of confrontation. But there will\r\n\r\ncome a time when the building construction trade will reach\r\n\r\nsaturation point: then there will be thousands of workers\r\n\r\nengaged in this trade who will be thrown out of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important point is that our present economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties should be solved basically. The economic solution\r\n\r\nis closely connected with the political solution of the\r\n\r\nMalaysian dispute. Without the support and sympathy of the \r\n\r\nAfro-Asian countries, and without the sustained support of the\r\n\r\npeople, Malaysia will not be able to stay in existence for a\r\n\r\nlong time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to go on to the question of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation and the common market. The P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nat present is attaching great importance to the success of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation in order to try to solve the mounting\r\n\r\nunemployment problem, and to make use of industrialisation as a\r\n\r\nmeans to console the people who are directly or indirectly\r\n\r\naffected and afflicted by Indonesian confrontation. At the\r\n\r\npresent moment, the 47 factories which are said to have gone\r\n\r\ninto production are able to employ some 2,000 workers. Even when\r\n\r\nthey go into full production, the maximum number of workers\r\n\r\nemployed will be only about 6,600. During the five years of its\r\n\r\nrule, the P.A.P. Government \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas been talking about industrialisation. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance has given great publicity to the opening of\r\n\r\nfactories from time to time. But, in spite of all the great show\r\n\r\nput up, the employment opportunities created by this grand\r\n\r\nopening amount to only 4,000. This is only a small percentage of\r\n\r\nthe unemployed people. According to the Minister himself, there\r\n\r\nare about 30,000 youths coming into the labour market every\r\n\r\nyear. Up to the present moment, there are at least thousands and\r\n\r\nthousands of youths unemployed. If you add to this figure those\r\n\r\nwho have become unemployed after confrontation, then the figure\r\n\r\nis far too great to be solved. The Minister has not told us of\r\n\r\nthe contribution made by the new industries to our national\r\n\r\nincome, whether they are able to cancel off the loss of 8.7 per\r\n\r\ncent of the national income brought about by confrontation, and\r\n\r\nwhether they are able to maintain only\r\n\r\n- and not to increase, I stress - the present national income.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the financial powers have largely been\r\n\r\ntransferred to the Central Government. Even the approval for\r\n\r\ncertificates of pioneer status is controlled by the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment. The Federation itself is also faced with the problem\r\n\r\nof unemployment. It has also got to find a way to solve it. So\r\n\r\ndo you think the Federation Government will grant pioneer status\r\n\r\nto Singapore industrialists? I would like to ask: after\r\n\r\nMalaysia, how many factories in Singapore have been awarded\r\n\r\npioneer status by the Federation Government? Under these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, Mr Speaker, how can you expect a lot of\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities to be created?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present investment in industries has been taken up\r\n\r\nmainly by foreign capital - British, American and Japanese.\r\n\r\nThese countries have invested considerabl7 in our industries.\r\n\r\nThey have made large profits too. I do not know whether the\r\n\r\nGovernment has taken any steps to make sure that the profits de\r\n\r\nrived from local industrialisation will be ploughed back into\r\n\r\nfurther investment in our own country and not sent out. If you\r\n\r\nallow foreign capitalists to invest by means of their worn-out\r\n\r\nmachinery\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin conjunction with local capital, derived from the hard-earned\r\n\r\nefforts of our own people, thereby resulting in a great flow of\r\n\r\ncapital outwards, then can you say that foreign capital\r\n\r\ninvestment is of advantage to us'? The P.A.P. Government is\r\n\r\nalways good at propaganda and showing oft. If in these problems\r\n\r\nthe Government is only good at showing off, and nothing more\r\n\r\nthan that, then I will say that our economic future is rather\r\n\r\nbleak. We try to attract foreign capital to our local\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. We go to foreign capitalists for loans at\r\n\r\ninterest. But, on the other hand, we invest our own money, to\r\n\r\nthe extent of some $300 million or more, in foreign countries,\r\n\r\nmuch to their benefit. I suggest that the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nwould do better to invest such funds in our own industries. It\r\n\r\nhopes that by the establishment of the common market, local\r\n\r\nindustry can be developed. There is a list declared of 101 items\r\n\r\nof goods to be included in the common market. But has the Gov\r\n\r\nernment noticed that various measures, particularly in the field\r\n\r\nof tariff, have been formulated under pressure of foreign\r\n\r\nmonopolists and capitalists? These measures will invariably lead\r\n\r\nto a rise in the price of consumer goods. So in the public\r\n\r\ninterest, I would say that the common market is a means by which\r\n\r\nforeign capitalists and monopolists try to strengthen their own\r\n\r\nposition in Singapore. The success of such industrialisation\r\n\r\nwill only lead to a higher cost of living within the next three\r\n\r\nto five years. People will suffer all the more. I must also\r\n\r\npoint out here that the interests of the workers should not be\r\n\r\nsacrificed to those of the foreign capitalists. The so-called\r\n\r\ncollective bargaining is carried out in favour of the\r\n\r\ncapitalists. So foreign capitalists will be able to exploit with\r\n\r\nease the workers of our own country and make more profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now go on to the question of the budget deficit.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Estimates, there appears for the first time a\r\n\r\ndeficit in Singapore to the extent of $20 million. According to\r\n\r\nthe Minister himself, this is because of increasing expenditure\r\n\r\nin the first place; and, in the second place, the necessity to\r\n\r\npay to the Central Government to meet the cost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof public services and national defence. No matter under what\r\n\r\ncircumstances the deficit has come about, and whatever economic\r\n\r\nactivities are carried out to sustain public services, it is a\r\n\r\nwaste of public funds to build things such as the National\r\n\r\nTheatre, swimming pools and playgrounds. People are not able to\r\n\r\nclothe and feed themselves. So how can we expect them to stroll\r\n\r\nin the parks'? It is a waste of money to build houses if people\r\n\r\nare not able to live in them. Many houses built by the Housing\r\n\r\nand Development Board have been left vacant. It is not that the\r\n\r\npeople do not want to live in such houses, but because of the\r\n\r\nincreased expenditure. To the lower income group, this increased\r\n\r\nexpenditure is beyond their means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year, because of Malaysia's arrangements, Singapore\r\n\r\nhas to contribute 40 per cent of its revenue to the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment, amounting to $120 million. On the other hand, we\r\n\r\nhave to lend about $30 million to North Borneo, thus resulting\r\n\r\nin a deficit. This sum of money is not going to be used on\r\n\r\nsocial welfare for the people of Malaya but on defence. Even on\r\n\r\nthe loan to North Borneo, the Minister has said that the\r\n\r\nGovernment will not just hand out this sum of money. But up to\r\n\r\nnow, how many workers have been recruited from Singapore by the\r\n\r\nBorneo Government? Therefore, the Minister will be quite foolish\r\n\r\nto give the loan. The main sources of revenue, such as income\r\n\r\ntax, customs, duty on tobacco and petrol and road tax, are all\r\n\r\nState revenue. If there is any change in the rates of duty,\r\n\r\nSingapore will be affected directly because of the Alliance\r\n\r\nGovernment's military expansion. The Federation Government's\r\n\r\nreserve funds have gone down. Therefore, they may increase the\r\n\r\nrate of taxation, and the burden on the Singapore people will be\r\n\r\nincreased accordingly. Not only has Malaysia brought about\r\n\r\nunemployment, but because of the continuation of the war in\r\n\r\nNorth Borneo, the people in Singapore have to meet the rising\r\n\r\ncost of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of facts and events after the formation of\r\n\r\nMalaysia have exploded the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlies of the Party in power. The people of Singapore are no more\r\n\r\nsubject to any illusion about the great success or the\r\n\r\nprosperity of Malaysia. Their immediate problem is to consider\r\n\r\nways and means of how to secede from Malaysia and to overcome\r\n\r\nthe distress that they are experiencing at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Because the P.A.P. is intoxicated with power and\r\n\r\nrelies on foreign capital and aid in order to sustain Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister has said that without Malaysia, Singapore\r\n\r\ncannot suvive. The Minister for Finance has also threatened the\r\n\r\nbusiness community in Singapore by saying that as soon as\r\n\r\nSingapore secedes from Malaysia, it will fall into the hands of\r\n\r\nthe Communists. All these statements will not be of any avail.\r\n\r\nWhat the P.A.P. are concerned with is how to solve their\r\n\r\nimmediate problems. No matter how they carry out their\r\n\r\npropaganda warfare, how the Prime Minister has played with power\r\n\r\nand tried to deceive the people, and how the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance has threatened by exerting pressure on small businessmen\r\n\r\nin order to make them loyal to Malaysia, all this will not be\r\n\r\nable to solve their problems. Singapore businessmen, who are\r\n\r\nworldly wise, and the masses of the people have realised that\r\n\r\nthe only correct policy is neutrality and that they should have\r\n\r\nequality and democracy internally. It is better to be like that\r\n\r\nthan to have a Malaysia which is rotten and spurned by the other\r\n\r\nAfro-Asian countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly is being asked by the P.A.P.

Since Malaysia Day on 16th September, 1963,\r\n\r\nthe Singapore State Government has no more control\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover Singapore's financial policy. Page 6 of the White Paper\r\n\r\nclearly states that the financial policy is now under the\r\n\r\ncontrol of the Federal Government. Page 5 of the White Paper\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In framing the State Budget, due consideration will be\r\n\r\ngiven to the prevailing financial policy of the Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Again, \"for budgetary purposes, all housekeeping matters will be\r\n\r\nleft to the State Government\".

The Singapore Government\r\n\r\nhas no control whatsoever over Singapore's financial policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Federal Government now has complete control over\r\n\r\nSingapore's financial policy. There is no more Currency Board on\r\n\r\nwhich Singapore is a member. The Federal Government will soon\r\n\r\nhave complete control over Singapore's banks when it amends, at\r\n\r\nthe end of the year, its Banking Ordinance to apply to Singa\r\n\r\npore. At present, control over Singapore's banks is exercised\r\n\r\nthrough a branch of the Bank Negara in Empress Place. It is only\r\n\r\nthe Federal Government that can amend the income tax laws and\r\n\r\nvary the rates of income tax or customs duties in Singapore. The\r\n\r\nFederal Government has control over most of the important powers\r\n\r\nof taxation and the collection of fees in Singapore. The \r\n\r\nPan-Malaysian financial policy, the monetary policy, the industrial\r\n\r\npolicy, determined by the Federal Government, will be applicable\r\n\r\nto all the States of Malaysia, including Singapore. The State of\r\n\r\nSingapore cannot affect this overall Malaysian financial policy;\r\n\r\nsimilarly neither Kelantan nor Sarawak can do so. The supreme\r\n\r\npower over finance in Singapore is held by the Federal Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the White Paper has stated, the\r\n\r\nSingapore State Government is merely a housekeeper. At the end\r\n\r\nof each year the housekeeper will make out his estimates of\r\n\r\nincome and expenses for the coming year. Only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Federal Minister for Finance, Mr Tan Siew Sin, can decide\r\n\r\nthe financial policy of the 15 States of Malaysia. He will tell\r\n\r\nus what his financial policy is that is applicable to the whole\r\n\r\nof Malaysia, which includes Singapore, in the Federal Parliament\r\n\r\nsome time next month. Now, the Singapore Government is being\r\n\r\nallotted $339 million for 1965 for Singapore's housekeeping. The\r\n\r\nSingapore Government is required to pay out from this amount for\r\n\r\nthe maintenance of schools, hospitals, social services, and so\r\n\r\non. The Singapore Government has found out that it is not enough\r\n\r\nto meet the necessary expenses. There will be a deficit, I\r\n\r\nbelieve for the first time, in Singapore's history. But\r\n\r\nfortunately for the moment, Singapore has some money invested\r\n\r\nsafely since Sir Stamford Raffles' time - just to meet\r\n\r\ncontingencies like this. But how long can these grandfather's\r\n\r\nproperty and savings last?\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, actually what the Assembly is\r\n\r\nasked to approve is the 1965 Budget of the Singapore State Government.\r\n\r\nThe difference between budget and financial policy is this: bud\r\n\r\nget is like furniture, financial policy is like a house. A\r\n\r\nbudget can be a part of a government's financial policy, like\r\n\r\nfurniture in a house. But a house cannot be inside the\r\n\r\nfurniture! Mr Speaker, Singapore's income is now almost fixed.\r\n\r\nThe Singapore Government has no way of increasing its income\r\n\r\neither by in-creasing taxes or by borrowing. The Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment can only make use of its grandfather's savings. The\r\n\r\nAssembly can study and debate the expenditure for 1965 - only\r\n\r\nthe expenditure - recommended by the housekeeper who is\r\n\r\nSingapore's Minister for Finance. The position is this: if we\r\n\r\nhad more meat, we would have less fish. If we wanted more fish,\r\n\r\nwe would have to take less meat. As a matter of fact, it is not\r\n\r\neven as good as that. We are now forced to cut down on both meat\r\n\r\nand fish, for although Singapore's population has increased by\r\n\r\nabout 60,000 a year, the money allotted for Singapore has\r\n\r\ndecreased. Not only has Singapore no say or control over its own\r\n\r\nfinancial policy, but the Federal Government will make an\r\n\r\nestimated $65 million profit from Singapore residents. And this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namount will increase year by year - $65 million profit a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important for us to bring home to the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore the limitations of the powers of the Singapore State\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly and consequently of the powers of the Singapore \r\n\r\nState Government. The Singapore State Government has about\r\n\r\nthe same powers of a Town Council in the United Kingdom or in\r\n\r\nthe United States. The present Singapore State Government has\r\n\r\nonly 25 per cent of the powers of the Lim Yew Hock Government in\r\n\r\n1955, or 10 per cent of the P.A.P. Government in 1959. This\r\n\r\npower will be reduced to 8 per cent if the Federal Government\r\n\r\nsets up Peace Committees to replace the Goodwill Committees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Hong Lim is going a little\r\n\r\ntoo fast, not for those who understand English but for those who\r\n\r\nare trying to interpret his speech. So if he will reduce his\r\n\r\nspeed, perhaps we could get on faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you very much, but\r\n\r\nthis is because of the new Standing Orders which give a Member\r\n\r\nonly one hour!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this power will be further reduced to 5 per cent if the\r\n\r\nFederal Government later decides to abolish the Work Brigade and\r\n\r\ncommunity centres, by ruling them out as para-military outfits.\r\n\r\nBy then the Singapore State Government will not even be as\r\n\r\nstrong as the P.M.I.P. Kelantan State Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1965 Budget reflects the extent of the powers of the\r\n\r\nSingapore State Government. The Minister for Finance himself had\r\n\r\nto admit that we are entering a difficult era. The New York of\r\n\r\nMalaysia is not Singapore. The New York of Malaysia is Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur. The golden goose of Malaysia will not lay golden eggs in\r\n\r\nSingapore, but in Petaling Jaya or even in Prai. We must not\r\n\r\ndeceive the people that there will be golden opportunities\r\n\r\nahead, opportunities which will never come. By the end of the\r\n\r\nyear more shops will be closed down. The Singapore River is now\r\n\r\nchoked with idlewearing, wasting tongkangs. Business is now\r\n\r\nalmost at a standstill. Singapore is almost a dead city, with\r\n\r\nonly three years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand eight months of Japanese occupation to outdo it. It is vital\r\n\r\nthat the people fully realise the situation and be appraised of\r\n\r\ntheir own personal future in the new setting before they sink\r\n\r\nlower and lower. Many shops have incurred more debts, hoping the\r\n\r\nsituation would improve. This is because of the talk of 8 per\r\n\r\ncent loss. Last year, at this time, the only activities left\r\n\r\nwere buildings and the share market. Now, even these two\r\n\r\nactivities have stopped. Many houses have been built because the\r\n\r\nplans for them had been approved, in the belief that we would be\r\n\r\nthe New York of Malaysia. But these houses have now no buyers.\r\n\r\nThe average customer's deposit in the banks is running down, and\r\n\r\nthe people's savings are now depleted. The future is bleak and\r\n\r\nstormy. Everybody is saying that the New York of Malaysia will\r\n\r\nbe in the heart-land of Malaysia, which is Kuala Lumpur, where\r\n\r\nreal political and economic power and also future prosperity\r\n\r\nshall lie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S.

We do notice this trend again. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, even before Malaysia Day on the 16th of September,\r\n\r\n1963, we had often said that if Singapore was to decide on\r\n\r\nmerger, it must be on a full, complete and equal basis. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government tried to twist our arguments by saying that\r\n\r\nwith complete and equal merger, half of our citizens would lose\r\n\r\ntheir citizenship. This is not true. The entry of Singapore into\r\n\r\nMalaysia as a peculiar State has created difficulties of immense\r\n\r\nproportions. Never have we experienced a position where the\r\n\r\nrelationship between the State Government and the Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment has been so tense and acute. The State Government of\r\n\r\nKelantan is run by the P.M.I.P. The Penang and Malacca City\r\n\r\nCouncils are run by the Socialist Front. The Ipoh City Council\r\n\r\nis run by the P.P.P. But there are no apparent difficulties\r\n\r\nbetween them and the Central Government. Singapore is now at the\r\n\r\nreceiving end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should now stop deceiving the people. We should tell them the\r\n\r\ntruth, even at the price of electoral defeat, because in the end\r\n\r\nthey will understand that we are telling the truth. They will\r\n\r\nunderstand us and they will be our strength. Are the curses of\r\n\r\nthe people which have been heaped on us, and the long sleepless\r\n\r\nnights which have ended with doses of sleeping pills, worth the\r\n\r\nelectoral victories achieved by lies? Why should the Government\r\n\r\nask the Assembly to approve its financial policy when it has no\r\n\r\nfinancial policy? I ask the Government to move an amendment\r\n\r\nitself to delete the words \"financial policy\" and substitute the\r\n\r\nword \"budget\". I do not want to shame the Government. I want to\r\n\r\nrespect the Government. The Singapore State Government has\r\n\r\nabsolutely no control over Singapore's financial policy.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, it has no control over Singapore's Police, Prisons,\r\n\r\nand so on. Of course, this does not mean that the Singapore\r\n\r\nState Government cannot make recommendations to the Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment to amend the income tax laws or to state who should\r\n\r\nor should not be detained. Whether the Federal Government\r\n\r\naccepts such recommendations is left entirely to its discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the main instruments of financial policy\r\n\r\nare taxation, control of banking, control of rate of interest\r\n\r\nand bank overdrafts, public borrowing, stock exchange, currency,\r\n\r\nforeign exchange, and so on. All these powers are now vested in\r\n\r\nthe Federal Government. The Singapore Government is appointed by\r\n\r\nthe Federal Government to be a collection agent for certain\r\n\r\ntypes of taxes, like income tax and customs duties. The branch\r\n\r\nof the Central Bank of the Federal Government established in\r\n\r\nEmpress Place since Malaysia Day controls the policies of all\r\n\r\nthe banks in Singapore, and therefore Singapore's monetary\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, neither has the Singapore Government any genuine\r\n\r\ncontrol over Singapore's industrial policy. The control of\r\n\r\nindustrial policy is also the prerogative of the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment. The key to direct industries to particular States of\r\n\r\nMalaysia is the power to issue pioneer certificates. Now, only\r\n\r\nthe Central Government has the power to issue pioneer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertificates. The Singapore Government cannot issue any more\r\n\r\npioneer certificates. It can only make recommendations to the\r\n\r\nFederal Government, and, as far as I know, none of its recom\r\n\r\nmendations have been accepted. For that matter, every State Gov\r\n\r\nernment in Malaysia can make recommendations, but whether the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of each particular State Government are to be\r\n\r\naccepted or not depends on Kuala Lumpur. If the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment in Kuala Lumpur decides that a certain factory should\r\n\r\ngo up in Petaling Jaya, or Prai, or Johore Bahru, and not in\r\n\r\nJurong, it can conveniently do so by refusing to accept the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Singapore Government to grant pioneer\r\n\r\nstatus to that factory and offering it pioneer status and\r\n\r\nprotection if it is set up in the State allotted to it. No\r\n\r\nfactory entrepreneur wants to throw money away under such\r\n\r\ncircumstances by setting up a factory in Jurong without a\r\n\r\npioneer status and without assurance of a common market for his\r\n\r\nproducts. The Central Government can conveniently refuse to\r\n\r\ngrant pioneer certificates to entrepreneurs who want to set up\r\n\r\nfactories in Jurong on the grounds that they want all the States\r\n\r\nof Malaysia to enjoy equal industrial development opportunities.\r\n\r\nThat is why we have advocated: why not go into Malaysia on equal\r\n\r\nterms instead of on peculiar terms? As a matter of fact, Sir, as\r\n\r\nfar as I know, since Malaysia was formed on 16th September,\r\n\r\n1963, no new pioneer certificates have been issued to any\r\n\r\nindustries to be established in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the common market arrangements are also\r\n\r\nanother method by which the Central Government can direct\r\n\r\nindustrial growth in Malaysia. The Singapore Government has very\r\n\r\nlittle say in the deliberations and decisions of the Common\r\n\r\nMarket Tariff Board which is controlled by the Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment. In short, it will be the Federal Minister of\r\n\r\nCommerce and Industry, through the instruments of granting\r\n\r\npioneer status and common market protection, who will decide\r\n\r\nwhether a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfactory is to be set up in Jurong, Petaling Jaya, Ipoh, or Prai.\r\n\r\nSir, we all know that the Jurong Industrial Scheme is a flop.\r\n\r\nNowhere in the world has a government spent so much of the tax\r\n\r\npayers' money on such an industrial scheme with so little\r\n\r\nresources! Several hundred million dollars of the taxpayers'\r\n\r\nmoney have been spent by the Economic Development Board alone,\r\n\r\nnot to include expenditure by the Public Utilities Board and the\r\n\r\nPublic Works Department on the Jurong Scheme. What we get is\r\n\r\nonly employment for several thousands of people after six years\r\n\r\nof P.A.P.'s effort and an expenditure of several hundred\r\n\r\nmillions of dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I say, the Jurong Industrial Scheme is\r\n\r\na complete flop. Hongkong did not require such a scheme, and yet\r\n\r\nit has hundreds of times more factories than Singapore. After\r\n\r\nsix years of half-baked efforts, backed by intensive propaganda\r\n\r\nof opening ceremonies, there are now less than 20 factories in\r\n\r\nactual operation in the Jurong industrial site, employing only\r\n\r\nseveral thousand people. They are not even able to absorb a\r\n\r\nsmall percentage of the increasing population of 60,000 each\r\n\r\nyear. What about those affected by confrontation? People who\r\n\r\nonly read the newspapers and watch on T.V. the daily performance\r\n\r\nof laying of foundation stone ceremonies and who have never\r\n\r\nvisited the Jurong site must think that there are at least 500\r\n\r\nfactories there. They will be shocked if they take a trip around\r\n\r\nthe Jurong area and see the pitiful, miserable results after\r\n\r\nover $200 million of the taxpayers' money has been spent!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The scrap plant which they call a\r\n\r\nsteel mill in Jurong has been a failure. A steel mill uses iron\r\n\r\nore as raw material; a scrap plant uses scrap. The production of\r\n\r\nthe scrap plant threatens to stop. The Government has prohibited\r\n\r\nthe export of scrap iron - the plant's raw material. This\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis understood to have led to the unemployment of many hundreds\r\n\r\nof people connected with scrap collection. The price of scrap\r\n\r\nwas forced down because scrap-dealers can only sell to this\r\n\r\nscrap plant. The import of steel was restricted to force up the\r\n\r\nprice of steel. This will eventually affect all house-buyers.\r\n\r\nS.I.T. flat-dwellers and contractors. The Government and private\r\n\r\nenterprise misled by Government's half-baked efforts have spent\r\n\r\nnearly $15 million on this scrap plant, although there is\r\n\r\nalready another scrap plant in Bukit Timah Road built during the\r\n\r\nLim Yew Hock Government. Only a few million dollars of extra\r\n\r\ncapital was required to expand the machinery of this other scrap\r\n\r\nplant to provide the same employment as the present scrap plant.\r\n\r\nBut the P.A.P. Government was not prepared to have a scrap plant\r\n\r\nbuilt during the Lim Yew Hock Government. It was prepared to let\r\n\r\nit close down, and it indeed closed down because there was no\r\n\r\npropaganda value. Moreover, there were no opening ceremonies to\r\n\r\nbe performed. Just imagine how much of the taxpayers' money has\r\n\r\nto be spent and how much burden the public must bear so that the\r\n\r\nscrap plant in Jurong is not forced to close down, merely for\r\n\r\nthe sake of propaganda!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the break-through in industrialisation\r\n\r\ncannot be achieved by the obsession to perform opening\r\n\r\nceremonies and laying of foundation stone ceremonies for every\r\n\r\nfirm, shop, factory - big or small, old or new. Even if it is an\r\n\r\nold firm, but so long as there is a change of site or of manage\r\n\r\nment, an opening ceremony is performed; even if a factory has\r\n\r\nbeen in production for several years, it is still never too late\r\n\r\nfor an opening ceremony. As time goes on, and as outstanding\r\n\r\nmonuments like subways and tailor shops to enshrine one's name\r\n\r\nfor posterity become fewer and fewer, we might see the day when\r\n\r\nevery bus-shelter constructed, every road built, every standpipe\r\n\r\nerected, goes through a ribbon-clipping ritual with a pair of\r\n\r\ngolden scissors, the usual flower pots, followed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby a set speech which can, be reproduced for such a grand\r\n\r\noccasion on a gramophone record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is perhaps pertinent to note that in all the fields of\r\n\r\nactivity of the P.A.P. Government's six years of office, all\r\n\r\nhave failed - and some have failed miserably - except in\r\n\r\nhousing. Housing is the only sector that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.    Government can boast of. Why has it succeeded in\r\n\r\nhousing when in all other sectors it has failed? It was just\r\n\r\nbecause by September, 1959 I had completed the reorganisation of\r\n\r\nthe S.I.T., completed a gigantic housing blue-print, and\r\n\r\ndeveloped new organisational techniques in the building of\r\n\r\nhouses. In October 1959, I announced the plan to build 80,000\r\n\r\nhousing units in five years, and it was supported by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister who saw the plan.\r\n\r\nBut later the P.A.P. leadership refused to release the money\r\n\r\nearmarked for housing. Instead they immediately appointed a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry to look into the building industry with\r\n\r\nthe sole object of discrediting me and to show that Singapore\r\n\r\ndid not have the skilled men and available building materials\r\n\r\nfor such a venture. The Commission of Inquiry's findings were\r\n\r\notherwise, because the evidence was too overwhelmingly\r\n\r\nconvincing that such a gigantic project was possible. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government hesitated to publish the findings until\r\n\r\nmany years later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. leadership was able to put forward a\r\n\r\nhousing programme which I outlined in 1959 because they retained\r\n\r\nthe services of the Chief Architect, Mr Teh Chiang Wan. He was\r\n\r\nmy friend from Australia. I knew at that time that he was an\r\n\r\norganising genius, not one from Batu Pahat. His ability was\r\n\r\nbeyond question. As soon as the P.A.P. came to power in 195g. I\r\n\r\nimmediately offered him a post in the S.I.T. He quitted his job\r\n\r\nin the Penang City Council, and we immediately plunged into a\r\n\r\nseries of meetings to reorganise the S.I.T. to formulate revolu\r\n\r\ntionary techniques in S.I.T. housing never dreamt of before, and\r\n\r\nto draw up a housing programme. Sir, Mr Teh Chiang Wan was to\r\n\r\nhousing in Singapore what Kosygin was to textile\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproduction in Russia. But Stalin unashamedly got the name and\r\n\r\nclaimed the credit for himself. If the Government appoints a\r\n\r\ngroup of nincompoops in the Housing Board Committee, houses\r\n\r\nwould still be built at the rate the Government desires - even\r\n\r\nif it wants 30,000 units a year - so long as Teh Chiang Wan is\r\n\r\nthere. We must give credit where credit lies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> L-i-e-s!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Because the nincompoops did not matter.\r\n\r\nIt is Teh Chiang Wan who matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

So\r\n\r\nwhen I first appointed Mr Teh and malayanised the expatriate\r\n\r\narchitects, what I received were curses from the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's industrial policies have\r\n\r\nfailed because, in the first place, there has never been a\r\n\r\nclearly formulated plan on the road to industrialisation with a\r\n\r\nclear target set on the methods to achieve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit. None of the Ministers in the Government have any real experi\r\n\r\nence in industry or business. Throughout his working life, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance had been a civil servant completely\r\n\r\nsheltered from the hurly-burly of the hard business world and\r\n\r\nthe fierce competition outside. He is by training a statistician\r\n\r\nof the first order\r\n\r\n- world class. He will make a great success in the United\r\n\r\nNations computing and analysing national income statistics of\r\n\r\ndeveloping nations. Because of his background and training, he\r\n\r\ncannot help apply civil service methods to industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when industries are to be run by civil\r\n\r\nservants on civil service principles, I am sure the public knows\r\n\r\nthe results. The Prime Minister himself possesses little\r\n\r\nknowledge of finance and economics and industry. He is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, in no position to make any contribution. The members\r\n\r\nof the Economic Development Board are hardworking. But they are\r\n\r\nalso civil servants long in the service. Much of their time,\r\n\r\nSir, is further wasted in seeking out and organising opening\r\n\r\nceremonies. Again the Government has not been able to recruit\r\n\r\nsomeone like Mr Teh Chiang Wan for its industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme. Now that the pioneer certificates and common market\r\n\r\nincentives are under the control of the Federal Government, the\r\n\r\nfuture of industrialisation is even more bleak. The vast Jurong\r\n\r\nsite, barren, with very few factories, looks like a wall without\r\n\r\nfeatures. Some time back, the Government blamed the Communists\r\n\r\nfor their failure in their industrialisation programme. Now they\r\n\r\nblame the Indonesians. Very soon they will blame the Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment. But when housing succeeded, it was all the P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\ncredit! They complimented nobody. The world did not know that it\r\n\r\nwas Teh Chiang Wan who built all the houses. Because the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment's industrialisation programme has failed, Singapore\r\n\r\nnow has the biggest percentage of population unemployed compared\r\n\r\nwith most of the modern cities of the world. Of course, the\r\n\r\nGovernment can tell us that there is even more acute\r\n\r\nunemployment in Jakarta where the people are supposed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto eat corn and rats. The hungry, unemployed people and those\r\n\r\ndepending on public assistance in Singapore get no consolation\r\n\r\nfrom such stories. We have the highest percentage of hawker and\r\n\r\npirate taxi population. If an unemployed person can borrow some\r\n\r\nmoney, he will turn to hawking or to running a pirate taxi to\r\n\r\nearn a few dollars a day. Nobody wishes to be a hawker or a\r\n\r\npirate taxi driver and face the threat of prosecution and fines\r\n\r\neveryday if he can get a job in a factory. The Government cannot\r\n\r\nfind jobs for them. It only knows how to arrest them. Or would\r\n\r\nthe Government prefer that they steal and rob because their\r\n\r\nchildren are hungry? Of course, it is wrong for pirate taxis to\r\n\r\ntake away passengers from the taxi drivers. But it is the\r\n\r\nGovernment's responsibility to find jobs for the unemployed.\r\n\r\nWhen they go to the Labour Exchange, they are asked to come back\r\n\r\nthe next day, It is now known that registration of unemployment\r\n\r\nin the Labour Exchange is a mere waste of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of the failure of Government's\r\n\r\nindustrialisation scheme and because of unfair financial terms,\r\n\r\nSingapore has been sold out on entry into Malaysia. Singapore\r\n\r\nwill, for the first time in history, be facing a deficit.\r\n\r\nSingapore has been a rich city since pre-war days. This is\r\n\r\nbecause of its geographical position, being the centre of \r\n\r\nSouth-East Asia trade. Whether it is a colonial government or a\r\n\r\ncorrupted government, the State coffers had never been empty.\r\n\r\nNow the State coffers have started to drain out. In the 1965\r\n\r\nBudget, not only Singapore cannot afford to expand its social\r\n\r\nservices, but in some cases it will have to shrink them. We are\r\n\r\nnow facing a deficit. But the Assembly is being asked at the\r\n\r\nsame time to be generous enough to give a S30 million\r\n\r\ninterest-free loan to Sabah and Sarawak in 1965, and another $90 million\r\n\r\nin subsequent years. Mr Speaker, Sir, how can we expect a\r\n\r\nsurplus budget if we have to pay so much ransom to the Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment each year? The Federal Government did not ask for it.\r\n\r\nThe P.A.P. Government was trying to be generous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe financial losses to be borne by Singapore each year are\r\n\r\nassessed as follows: (1) Payment to the Federal Government of 40\r\n\r\nper cent of national revenue, $127 million; (2) Interest on $30\r\n\r\nmillion to Sabah and Sarawak, $2 million. Loss of earnings from\r\n\r\nthe issue of currency notes, which now goes to the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment, $11 million; making a total of $140 million. The\r\n\r\nFederation Government's expenditure on Government Departments in\r\n\r\nSingapore - which it has now taken over from the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment - is estimated to be only $75 million a year. This is\r\n\r\nthe bargain the P.A.P. Government has entered into. Singapore\r\n\r\nhad surrendered to the Federal Government control of the Police,\r\n\r\nArmed Services, Prisons, Immigration, Posts, Telephones, Telecom\r\n\r\nmunications, Vehicle Registration, the Courts, Judges,\r\n\r\nMagistrates, the Paya Lebar Airport, Identity Card Registration,\r\n\r\nMeteorological Services, control of companies and stock\r\n\r\nexchange, control of income taxes and customs, issue of pioneer\r\n\r\ncertificates, final decision on Singapore citizenship\r\n\r\nregistration, control of film censorship, and a host of other\r\n\r\nsubjects. The P.A.P. Government gives all these departments and\r\n\r\npower to the Federal Government and pays $140 million a year to\r\n\r\nthe Federal Government to maintain them. The Federal Government\r\n\r\nhas only to spend $75 million and makes a clear profit of $65\r\n\r\nmillion. What a bargain the Singapore Government has entered\r\n\r\ninto. I did not get the figures from nowhere. I got the figures\r\n\r\nfrom the Budget itself. To check the accuracy of my figures, I\r\n\r\ngot further proof from no less an authority than Singapore's\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance. Page 11 of the 1965 Budget, the \"Abstract\r\n\r\nof Estimated Revenue for the Year 1965\" shows that the Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment will receive $137 million a year from taxes paid by\r\n\r\nresidents in Singapore.

At that time\r\n\r\nthey told us that it was a very good bargain. I remember we were\r\n\r\ntold that to run these departments would cost much more.

But now we have solid proof that the elder cousin\r\n\r\nhad outsmarted the younger cousin. The younger cousin had sold\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore down the drain to the tune of $65\r\n\r\nmillion a year. In 1965, the elder cousin will collect $127\r\n\r\nmillion from the younger cousin. Actually the money will be in\r\n\r\nthe Bank Negara in Empress Place, the bank belonging to the\r\n\r\nelder cousin. In 1966, the amount will be more than $127\r\n\r\nmillion, and it will keep on increasing.

The younger cousin has suddenly woke up. See what\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Minister for Finance now tells us. In column 131\r\n\r\nof the Hansard, Vol. 23, No. 2, in his Budget speech on 2nd\r\n\r\nNovember, 1964, he says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Revenue and expenditure for the current year shows that\r\n\r\nthe days are over when we can take for granted that each\r\n\r\nfinancial year will end with a surplus of $50 million or more.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a rich city. Whether it is David\r\n\r\nMarshall, Lim Yew Hock or the colonial Government, there will\r\n\r\nalways be a budget surplus. Now this surplus will be gone\r\n\r\nforever, given to the Federation Government by the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now coming back to the story. The Federal Government\r\n\r\nreceives $127 million a year and pays out $75 million a year,\r\n\r\nmaking a profit of $52 million. In addition, it will receive an\r\n\r\nadditional profit of $11 million each year by taking full\r\n\r\ncontrol of the issue of currency notes. You know, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, printing of currency notes is a very profitable business.\r\n\r\nNow if we give Sabah and Sarawak an interest-free loan of $30\r\n\r\nmillion a year, which the Singapore Government has to raise from\r\n\r\nthe Singapore public, it has to pay $2 million interest each\r\n\r\nyear. $52 million plus $11 million, plus $2 million equals $65\r\n\r\nmillion. In 1965, therefore, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment has sold out the people of Singapore for $65 million.\r\n\r\nIn 1966 it is likely to be $75 million. In 1967 it is likely to\r\n\r\nbe $85 million, because the 40 per cent contribution will\r\n\r\nincrease year after year. As far as I know, for the first time\r\n\r\nin Singapore's history, at least since the war, we are going to\r\n\r\nhave a deficit. The Alliance-controlled Federal Government is\r\n\r\nnot going to have a two-year truce to allow the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.- controlled Singapore Government a breathing space to make use of\r\n\r\nSingapore as an economic base - a Cuba - to launch a political\r\n\r\noffensive in the Federal elections in 1969. The Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment will make doubly sure that not only will the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.- controlled Singapore Government's social services in\r\n\r\nSingapore be unable to expand to cope with the increasing popu\r\n\r\nlation and growing unemployment, but it will make it further\r\n\r\ndeteriorate. This is what is actually happening now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government has little power\r\n\r\nleft except to run schools and hospitals. Anybody who wants to\r\n\r\ngo to the University of Singapore, Nanyang University, the Singa\r\n\r\npore Polytechnic, Ngee Ann College, is required to get a permit\r\n\r\nfrom the Federal Government. Because of the loss of power, the\r\n\r\nsuppressors of Nan-yang University and Chinese education have\r\n\r\nturned to become the defenders of Nanyang University and Chinese\r\n\r\neducation. The non-communal socialist heroes of years ago have\r\n\r\nbecome the skilled practitioners of communal politics so that\r\n\r\nthey can gather support from the Chinese. The Communist bogey\r\n\r\nhas now receded temporarily from the picture, and in its place a\r\n\r\ndifferent battle is being fought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the entire financial arrangements entered\r\n\r\ninto with the Federal Government were a sell-out. As a matter of\r\n\r\nfact, the White Paper was a gigantic fraud perpetrated on the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. We are told that Singapore will be a\r\n\r\nspecial autonomous State within Malaysia. During the dis\r\n\r\nturbances in July the whole humbug was exposed. The people saw\r\n\r\nwith their own eyes that the members of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState Government of Singapore, who called themselves the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and Ministers, have completely no power. They are no\r\n\r\nbetter off than the average citizens. They also required curfew\r\n\r\npasses issued by the Federal Government to pass through the\r\n\r\nstreets even in official cars. The story went around that one of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Ministers\r\n\r\n- I am afraid, if the story is true, he had not studied the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper and the Constitution properly - was ordered by the\r\n\r\nordinary soldiers to come down from his official car and show\r\n\r\nhis curfew pass. I am sure that if Singapore had entered\r\n\r\nMalaysia on an equal footing, there would not have been such\r\n\r\nproblems. There is now no trouble between the \r\n\r\nAlliance-controlled Government ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Central Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - the Central Government and the P.M.I.P.-\r\n\r\ncontrolled Kelantan State Government. Let us not further deceive\r\n\r\nthe people that half of them would lose their citizenship rights\r\n\r\nif Singapore entered Malaysia on an equal footing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, since the Singapore Minister for Finance has\r\n\r\nno power at all in deciding the financial policy of \r\n\r\nSingapore - as it will be decided by Mr Tan Siew Sin; and Dr Lim Swee Aun,\r\n\r\nthe Federal Minister for Commerce and Industry, will decide on\r\n\r\nSingapore's industrialisation policy - the words \"Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance\" applicable to Dr Goh Keng Swee may slowly have to be\r\n\r\nchanged. There is no Minister for Finance anywhere in the world\r\n\r\nwho does not decide on financial policy. In the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nor the United States, Dr Goh's post will be called the City\r\n\r\nTreasurer or the State Financial Officer or the State Accountant-General. In the epoch of the l960s only in Singapore can you\r\n\r\nfind people in positions with high-sounding names but no power,\r\n\r\nlike Emperor Puyi of Manchukuo nearly three decades back.\r\n\r\nActually if the policeman does not want to salute the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of Singapore when he enters the City Hall or the\r\n\r\nAssembly House, the latter cannot do anything. I will not be\r\n\r\nsurprised at all if one day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Central Government, in order to avoid confusion (I believe\r\n\r\nthere was some confusion during the first African tour as to\r\n\r\nwhether the Prime Minister of Singapore controls Malaysia, or\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister of Malaysia controls Singapore) amend the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Constitution and call the Front-benchers in the\r\n\r\nSingapore Assembly, as Mentri Besar, Timbalan Mentri Besar,\r\n\r\nState Financial Secretary, Education Secretary, Health\r\n\r\nSecretary, Labour Secretary and so on. These names are more ap\r\n\r\npropriate with their present powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, actually from now onwards we can\r\n\r\nexpect bigger and bigger deficits each year. All the capital\r\n\r\nreserves accumulated by the colonial government and the Tun Lim\r\n\r\nYew Hock Government will be drained away. Sir, they have always\r\n\r\ncondemned the Tun Lim Yew Hock Government as a decadent,\r\n\r\ninefficient and corrupt Government. The P.A.P. has always sung\r\n\r\npraises of its own, that is, the Government is a clean\r\n\r\nGovernment, an honest Government and an efficient Government.\r\n\r\nExcept for housing, where the credit should be given to Teh\r\n\r\nChiang Wan, the master-mind and the genius behind the whole\r\n\r\nhousing project, six years of P.A.P. rule have done less for the\r\n\r\npeople than three years of the Lim Yew Hock Government. In the\r\n\r\nfield of education, the Lim Yew Hock Government built the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic and the Teachers' Training College. The P.A.P. have\r\n\r\nbuilt none. In the field of health, the Lim Yew Hock Government\r\n\r\nbuilt one district hospital in Thomson Road. The P.A.P. have\r\n\r\nbuilt none. In the field of industrialisation, six years of\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government and investments of more than $200 million have\r\n\r\nnot produced more factories for more workers than three years of\r\n\r\nthe Lim Yew Hock Government with no investments. The difference\r\n\r\nis that Lim Yew Hock did not know how to organise opening ceremonies, whether they are for new factories or old factories. He\r\n\r\nshould have given instructions through his Industrial Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard to get all factories, established since Sir Stamford\r\n\r\nRaffles' time, to be white-washed, and to perform the opening\r\n\r\nceremonies. Of course, in those days, we had no T.V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, leaving housing aside, there is no field of\r\n\r\nactivity where six years of P.A.P. Government have surpassed in\r\n\r\nits results the three years of the Lim Yew Hock Government. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government is not better than the Lim Yew Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment. Sir, the 1965 Budget makes no provision for a\r\n\r\nGeneral Hospital. The present General Hospital was built prewar\r\n\r\nto cope with only one-third of the present population. We need\r\n\r\nto expand the General Hospital to three times its present size\r\n\r\nto cope with the present demand. The public is complaining of\r\n\r\nthe inadequacies of the hospital services. The 1965 Budget\r\n\r\nshould make provision to expand the present Polytechnic to at\r\n\r\nleast five times the present size to cope with the demand. It is\r\n\r\nvery difficult for students to get admission to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1965 Budget did not increase the amount of public\r\n\r\nassistance which has stood at about $10 million constantly for\r\n\r\nseveral years. With confrontation and its effects now severely\r\n\r\nfelt, this amount should be increased to at least $20 million.\r\n\r\nThousands of families are urgently requiring public assistance,\r\n\r\nbut because of the strict rules, they cannot get aid. Those who\r\n\r\nget public assistance cannot afford to pay even the rent of\r\n\r\ntheir cubicles from the $10 or $20 they receive a month. The\r\n\r\npeople receiving public assistance should be respected like\r\n\r\nhuman beings and not be made to beg for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, due to the fact that most of the Housing\r\n\r\nBoard dwellers are from the lower income groups, mostly affected\r\n\r\nby confrontation, the P.A.P. Government should immediately\r\n\r\nreduce S.I.T. rentals by 20 per cent at least to last as long as\r\n\r\nIndonesian confrontation -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Why not free?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> This will cost the Government only $4\r\n\r\nmillion a year. The 1965 Budget makes no provision for the\r\n\r\nrelief of fire victims since outbreaks of fire are now almost a\r\n\r\nrecurring affair. As in the past few years, we have a big fire\r\n\r\nalmost each year. There should be an annual provision in the\r\n\r\nBudget for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelief of fire victims. The Government makes a big profit by\r\n\r\npaying prices far below the market price to those owners of land\r\n\r\naffected by fires. Such profits should be earmarked as relief\r\n\r\nfor the fire victims. Because of inadequate provisions, the\r\n\r\nrecent fire victims of Kampong Pulau Minyak in Lorong 1, Geylang, were not well looked after. I believe they have so far\r\n\r\nreceived only $10 cash each, with no free clothes, no free\r\n\r\nblankets and no free food. In the Lorong 3 fire, the fire\r\n\r\nvictims each received several hundreds of dollars in cash,\r\n\r\nunlimited amounts of gifts in goods and a house for each family.\r\n\r\nWhat a contrast if the Government does not care for the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no provision in the 1965 Budget\r\n\r\nfor the erection of the pre-election time much-publicised\r\n\r\nmemorial for victims during the Japanese Occupation. After\r\n\r\nMalaysia Day and the Singapore general elections, not one word\r\n\r\nhas been spoken. You will remember the P.A.P. Government made\r\n\r\nsolemn pledges to the people at a mass rally of 100,000 people\r\n\r\nto fight to the very last for Japanese reparations. Now after\r\n\r\nnearly 1\u00bd years we have not heard one single word. Not one\r\n\r\nsingle murmur! The organisers have also kept quiet. Very funny!\r\n\r\nBefore the mass rally, the Singapore Prime Minister broke the\r\n\r\nsoil for a memorial on a four-acre piece of land near the\r\n\r\nBritannia Club. I still cannot see the memorial when I pass by.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, what a vote-catching fraud! I also remember\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government telling the people before the elections\r\n\r\nthat they were going to introduce free secondary education.\r\n\r\nWhere is the free secondary education provision in the 1965\r\n\r\nBudget?

Of\r\n\r\ncourse, the Government's excuse is that we have no more power\r\n\r\nover finance. We are facing a deficit. Sir, let us now assume\r\n\r\nthat the P.A.P. Government had not surrendered the annual sum of\r\n\r\n$65 million worth of profit to the Federation Government each\r\n\r\nyear. What can we do with $65 million each year? Build one\r\n\r\ndistrict hospital each year, $5 million; build one polytechnic\r\n\r\neach year, $10 million; double the present rate of social\r\n\r\nwelfare public assistance relief, $10 million; reduce the S.I.T.\r\n\r\nrentals by 20 per cent, $4 million; free secondary education for\r\n\r\nall, $2 million; reduce taxes, fines and abolish all hawkers'\r\n\r\nlicence fees, $2 million; abolish all radio and T.V, licences,\r\n\r\n$3 million; abolish all night soil and trade refuse collection\r\n\r\ncharges, $2 million; reduce property tax on all houses, whether\r\n\r\nbrick or attap by half, since Singapore has one of the highest\r\n\r\nproperty taxes in the world. $27 million; making a total of $65\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Government admit that they have no\r\n\r\nmore power over their financial policy, I ask them here, of\r\n\r\ntheir own accord, to move an amendment themselves, to substitute\r\n\r\nthe word \"budget\" for \"financial policy\". The Minister's speech\r\n\r\non the Budget dare not touch on Singapore's financial policy. He\r\n\r\nhas only explained in his speech some of the figures in the\r\n\r\nBudget. What he has asked the House to approve is the 1965\r\n\r\nBudget on which we have little quarrel with him, because he has\r\n\r\nno other way out. In the circumstances, Mr Speaker, Sir, I must\r\n\r\nput on record in the House that the Minister for Finance has\r\n\r\ndone his best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, we are very fortunate people in many respects, because one has \r\n\r\nonly to look around in South-East Asia and see the difference\r\n\r\n- dictatorships, guided democracy, and other political gimmicks\r\n\r\nwith their attendant economic decay and human suffering are the\r\n\r\norder of the times. In our context, let us look back to the \r\n\r\npre-1959 era and the post-1959 era. We will note\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat we were in the doldrums in the pre1959 colonial era.\r\n\r\nSingapore was lying fallow and everything done was in the\r\n\r\neconomic interest of the colonial master, but not in the social\r\n\r\ninterest of the people. The post-1959 era saw the destiny of the\r\n\r\nState vested in the hands of its own people. Out of the doldrums\r\n\r\nthere appeared a new dynamism, a will to improve things for\r\n\r\nourselves. The indifference of the colonialists to social\r\n\r\nproblems left in our hands the legacy of an expanding population\r\n\r\nseeking outlets for employment, housing, education, medical\r\n\r\ncare. It was found that the only way to create new and expanding\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities for a fast growing population was to\r\n\r\nindustrialise. And so started our economic development planning\r\n\r\nwhich has given birth to the vast Jurong Industrial complex and\r\n\r\nthe smaller estates at Tanglin Halt, Redhill and Kallang. 113\r\n\r\nfirms have been awarded Pioneer Certificates and 47 are in\r\n\r\nproduction, employing about 4,190 persons currently. This number\r\n\r\nis likely to be increased to 6,687 eventually. In addition,\r\n\r\nabout 120 new non-pioneer firms have gone up this year alone.\r\n\r\nThe next few years will see an even greater rate of industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion. Both public and private housing projects are\r\n\r\nprogressing with undiminished vigour, so much so that the\r\n\r\nspectre of housing shortage that faced Singapore before has\r\n\r\ndisappeared. The spate of building activity is slowly changing\r\n\r\nthe Singapore skyline, and a further change will occur in the\r\n\r\nnot too distant future with the rebuilding of the City itself.\r\n\r\nWe are now in the transitional phase of transforming the State\r\n\r\ninto an industrial one, which also entails social development on\r\n\r\na large scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spirit of pioneers, we must proceed with\r\n\r\nundiminished vigour so that a firm foundation for a more just\r\n\r\nand more equal society can be laid. In this society, it is our\r\n\r\nfervent hope that our children will find a place of dignity and\r\n\r\nstanding, happiness and prosperity. However, certain enemies of\r\n\r\nour society, with the aid of their foreign allies, are\r\n\r\nattempting to nullify our efforts at building a better future\r\n\r\nfor our people. To them, progress brought about by democratic\r\n\r\nsocialism\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeans their destruction, because the people will see the\r\n\r\nhollowness of their political and social philosophy. It is the\r\n\r\nduty of all those who believe in the democratic system to work\r\n\r\nwith dedication and energy towards our economic and social\r\n\r\ndevelopment, be they employers, workers or professional men.\r\n\r\nTrade unions, of course, have a vital role to play in this field\r\n\r\nand there is no doubt that they, under the leadership of the\r\n\r\nNational Trades Union Congress, will bring to the fore their\r\n\r\ningenuity in helping to solve the social problems that face us.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, means that pure militant trade unionism has no\r\n\r\nplace in this context -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Although the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister has made use of all sorts of strategy in order\r\n\r\nto cover up many facts which they do not want the people to\r\n\r\nknow, and to create a false impression in the minds of the\r\n\r\npeople, we on closer examination are able to find dirty things\r\n\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me clarify some of the points in the statement.\r\n\r\nFirstly, there is a deficit in our budget for next year.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there has been a trade decline for the first half of\r\n\r\nthis year. The volume of imports for the first half of 1964 has\r\n\r\ndecreased by 23 per cent, and the volume of exports has\r\n\r\ndecreased by 31 per cent compared with the corresponding period\r\n\r\nof last year. Thirdly, when we are faced with economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties, the Government has agreed to hand over $27 million\r\n\r\nto the Federal Government. Fourthly, because of the loopholes in\r\n\r\nIndonesian confrontation, Singapore has been able to recover\r\n\r\nsome of the business in barter trade lost in September last\r\n\r\nyear. Fifthly, our economic situation has changed for the worse,\r\n\r\nalthough there is a high level of activity in our construction\r\n\r\nand manufacturing fields, Sixthly, this Budget Statement can be\r\n\r\ntermed a useless piece of paper because the financial policy of\r\n\r\nthe Federation can upset our budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, the Minister for Finance has admitted that\r\n\r\nafter the formation of Malaysia, which is contrary to the wishes\r\n\r\nof the people, the days of a surplus at the end of each year are\r\n\r\ngone. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Revenue and expenditure for the current year shows that\r\n\r\nthe days are over when we can take for granted that each\r\n\r\nfinancial year will end with a surplus of $50 million or more.\r\n\r\nThis fact will have to be faced.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This is the first deficit the P.A.P. Government has to face. In\r\n\r\norder to boast that it is a sound Government, it deducted and\r\n\r\ntried to save money on expenditure, with the result that there\r\n\r\nwas a surplus every year. The Government made use of this\r\n\r\nsurplus to deceive the people. Today it has to admit that there\r\n\r\nwould not be any surplus any more. What are the reasons for\r\n\r\nthis? The main reason is that the revenue for the State\r\n\r\nGovernment has decreased. Why should we have this deficit?\r\n\r\nObviously this is closely related to our trade suspension with\r\n\r\nIndonesia. As everybody is aware, the entrepot trade has all\r\n\r\nalong been our economic sinews and that trade between Singapore\r\n\r\nand Indonesia has some prominence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has also admitted that as a result of\r\n\r\nconfrontation our economy has been affected, and the worst effect\r\n\r\nis centred on Singapore after the suspension of trade\r\n\r\nbetween Indonesia and Singapore. No matter what views people may\r\n\r\nhold, nobody can deny that this calamity has been brought about\r\n\r\nby the formation of Malaysia. If we had no Malaysia, we would\r\n\r\nnot have such a calamity. If the upper clique of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncould give up their self-seeking motives and listen to the views\r\n\r\nof the people, the masses of the people here in Singapore will\r\n\r\nnot have to face such great difficulty and our economy will not\r\n\r\nface such a crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past one year there has been a serious recession in\r\n\r\nour trade. According to the Minister for Finance, for the first\r\n\r\nhalf of this year there has been a decrease of 23 per cent in\r\n\r\nour imports and in exports there has been a decrease of 31 per\r\n\r\ncent, and the rapid recession of trade last year was the direct\r\n\r\noutcome of confrontation. As a result of trade recession, we\r\n\r\nhave this economic deterioration, and those directly affected\r\n\r\nare the transport workers, lightermen, import and export firms,\r\n\r\nrubber workers, rattan workers, small businessmen, hawkers and\r\n\r\nfarmers. All these people are now faced with difficulties. They\r\n\r\nhave left their jobs and the cost of living has gone up.\r\n\r\nTaxation has gone up, and some workers are even faced with\r\n\r\nstarvation. Yet the Prime Minister's clique has been talking of\r\n\r\nprosperity and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

He has also said that the economy of Singapore \r\n\r\nis stable and that we have not been affected by confrontation. The \r\n\r\nMinister is trying to gloss over our difficulties by such remarks, \r\n\r\nif the Government continues to be irresponsible, it will one day find\r\n\r\nthat our situation will be so grave that it cannot be redeemed any more.\r\n\r\nThe first victims would be the masses of the people in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how honeyed the words the Minister may use, we\r\n\r\nare able to find many contradictions in his speech. On the one\r\n\r\nhand, he has said that our economy has not been affected by con\r\n\r\nfrontation. On the other hand, he has said that as a result of\r\n\r\nconfrontation our trade and business have suffered a great blow.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, he has said we are not affected by con\r\n\r\nfrontation. But, on the other hand, the statistics show that\r\n\r\nthere has been a great recession in our trade. On the one hand,\r\n\r\nhe has said that the country which is suffering from\r\n\r\nconfrontation is Indonesia. On the other hand, he has said that\r\n\r\nSingapore can restore some of the barter trade it lost before\r\n\r\nSeptember last year. All these contradictions appear in the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance's speech. Which side of the picture shall\r\n\r\nwe ask the people to believe'? We are not going to listen to the\r\n\r\nsmear and the abuse of language delivered by the Minister. The\r\n\r\n1.7 million people in Singapore have got every right to know the\r\n\r\ntrue state of affairs and how they are going to go on living.\r\n\r\nThey will not be deceived by the Prime Minister when he says\r\n\r\nthat in 1967 we will be able to see the results and that 20\r\n\r\nyears from now we will be able to lead a happy life. What we are\r\n\r\nconcerned with is not the hollow talk of 20 years from now. What\r\n\r\nwe are concerned with is our economic problem which needs\r\n\r\nimmediate solution. I feel that whether the P.A.P. can continue\r\n\r\nto rule us, whether Mr Lee Kuan Yew can still be our Prime\r\n\r\nMinister ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

I ask him to be\r\n\r\nhonest and let the people know the true state of affairs.

We have to contribute $127 million to the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment. The Minister says that out of $339 million in\r\n\r\nrevenue, 40 per cent of it will be handed over to the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment; that is to say, $127 million. This is 40 per cent of\r\n\r\nthe State revenue. Mr Speaker, Sir, this is one of the greatest\r\n\r\nlosses which have come about as a result of Malaysia.

We had hoped that the money earned\r\n\r\nby the people could be used by them on social welfare for the\r\n\r\nbenefit of the people and in order to build a better society.\r\n\r\nBut what is the situation now? The result of Malaysia with\r\n\r\nregard to the financial arrangements is that the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas given away large sums of our money to the Tunku's\r\n\r\nGovernment. Thus, in addition to divesting our people of most of\r\n\r\ntheir rights, a large part of our money has been used for\r\n\r\npurposes contrary to the interest of the people. It has been\r\n\r\nused to suppress the people. It has enabled the Anglo-American\r\n\r\nimperialists to buy armaments and force our people here to\r\n\r\nbecome cannon fodder in North Borneo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is now faced with a financial\r\n\r\ndeficit. The position of the people is made difficult after the\r\n\r\nseverance of trade with Indonesia. The people are experiencing\r\n\r\nunemployment and economic difficulties. Most of the trade and\r\n\r\ncommerce has stopped. Moreover, the people of Singapore will\r\n\r\nhave to tighten their belts in order to hand over more money to\r\n\r\nthe Federation. This is to maintain the oligarchy of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nSuch arrangements were made during the Singapore and Federation\r\n\r\nmerger talks. Without this neocolonialist Malaysia, trade would\r\n\r\nnot have been severed. There would have been no need to hand\r\n\r\nover this sum of money as a present to the Tunku's Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> On a point of\r\n\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You have ruled that the phrase \"phoney\r\n\r\nmerger\" is out of order.

In the past,\r\n\r\nthe Minister has claimed Budget surpluses. If there had been no\r\n\r\nMalaysia, then the State Government would not have to levy more\r\n\r\ntax on the people. The rate of postage will now have to be\r\n\r\nincreased. Since the P.A.P, came to power, there have been in\r\n\r\ncreases of taxes, causing difficulties to the people. There have\r\n\r\neven been taxes on minor items such as parking in car \r\n\r\nparks-[Laughter] Is it not true? There will be more taxes to come.\r\n\r\nAll these have been the ill-consequences brought about by\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has stressed that Singapore is closely linked\r\n\r\nwith Malaysia. Without Malaysia, Singapore cannot exist. Singapore \r\n\r\nis now faced with a situation in which she will have\r\n\r\nto contribute money for the defence and security of the whole of\r\n\r\nMalaysia. I ask the Government whether they now regret having\r\n\r\nagreed to hand over such a large sum of money to the Federation.\r\n\r\nThe Minister for Finance has claimed that because of increased\r\n\r\nactivity in the industrial and construction fields, the effects\r\n\r\nof confrontation have been countered to a great extent. I say\r\n\r\nthat they have some effect on this. But it is not quite\r\n\r\nsignificant. The Minister for Finance has also claimed that\r\n\r\nthere have been no effects as a result of severance of trade. Is\r\n\r\nit not contradictory to what he has just said?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us talk about another subject, namely, housing\r\n\r\ndevelopment. Superficially, the whole picture looks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnice and appears as though it is beneficial to the people. There\r\n\r\nare periodic economic crises happening in all capitalist\r\n\r\ncountries, in such a situation, the Government will usually\r\n\r\nresort to public construction in order to divert the economy\r\n\r\ninto this field to resolve the situation, to promote our\r\n\r\ncommercial activities. But it is an abnormal phenomenon. Once it\r\n\r\nreaches saturation point, the serious consequences will then\r\n\r\nappear. If our economy is not solved by resorting to measures\r\n\r\nwhich are beneficial to the welfare and interest of the people\r\n\r\nand the State, then there will be even more serious crises in\r\n\r\nfuture. The measure to resolve the present crisis in order to\r\n\r\nsolve the problem of livelihood of the people is not a proper\r\n\r\none. I now ask the Government to adopt a method which will meet\r\n\r\nwith the national interest. Thus nobody will be able to exploit\r\n\r\nthe situation and make money out of building houses. For\r\n\r\ninstance, there are areas where there have been fires and the\r\n\r\nvictims of the fires have suffered, and yet house developers\r\n\r\nhave been able to exploit the situation. This is not the way to\r\n\r\nresolve the problem facing us in respect of the livelihood of\r\n\r\nthe people. So, housing development is not the only way to\r\n\r\nresolve the present situation. It will not solve entirely the\r\n\r\nunemployment problem. I would like to ask, since new factories\r\n\r\nare opened almost every day, how many unemployed workers have\r\n\r\nbeen employed, and whether there is any solution to the economic\r\n\r\ncrisis? I would like to tell the Government that, in fact, in\r\n\r\ncountries such as Britain and America, there are many advanced\r\n\r\nindustries and yet the unemployment situation there is more\r\n\r\nserious than in other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, today the industrial development in\r\n\r\nSingapore is entirely in keeping with the imperialist economic\r\n\r\npolicy and meets the interest of foreign monopolist capital.\r\n\r\nThis is a fact that cannot be covered up. This will only benefit\r\n\r\nthe foreign capitalists. To speak the truth, such an industrial\r\n\r\npolicy will only throw our door open to foreign capitalists,\r\n\r\nthus making our workers continue to be exploited by foreign\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonopolist capital and is not in keeping with the true interests\r\n\r\nof our nation and our people. In order to make the Ministers\r\n\r\nunderstand more, I would like to point out that because the\r\n\r\nlicences extended to pioneer industries are in respect of\r\n\r\nmanufactured products which are under the control of foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists, the prices of these products will increase.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is entirely in keeping with the neo-imperialist\r\n\r\neconomic policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has claimed increased industrial activity.\r\n\r\nBut this cannot gloss over the fact that many people are unemployed \r\n\r\nand the conditions of service of the workers are not suitable. The\r\n\r\nGovernment should not allow such exploitation by foreign capitalists \r\n\r\nto continue, and try to legalise such exploitation. Everyone can \r\n\r\nsee the present industrial situation.\r\n\r\nThe Minister for Finance also knows that the actual effect of\r\n\r\nthis is not beneficial to the people. The Minister in one of his\r\n\r\nspeeches has also said that many workers have been given 50\r\n\r\ncents or $1 by the employers. It appears as though the measure\r\n\r\nwas justified, but the workers affected, especially those\r\n\r\nengaged in the garment trade, suffered the most. I will now give\r\n\r\nan example. In the countryside, there is a textile mill. New\r\n\r\nworkers' wages are 50 cents to $1 each. But they have to pay a\r\n\r\ndeposit of $10 first and their wages can be changed by the\r\n\r\nemployers. If there are more orders, then the employers can give\r\n\r\nwages according to the daily rate. If not, then it will be on a\r\n\r\npiece rate. The working conditions are also not ideal. In the\r\n\r\nJurong Industrial site, the mobile nature of the workers will\r\n\r\nbring the picture up to date as to what is the situation i1i\r\n\r\nrelation to pioneer industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, under the present economic policy, industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment will lead to further poverty of the people and our\r\n\r\nnational capitalists will no longer be able to raise their heads\r\n\r\nand Unemployment will increase. We have to sort these problems\r\n\r\nout and stop this forced industrial policy which can only\r\n\r\nbenefit the foreign capitalists. We should disband Malaysia.

In the Development Estimates, we have a total figure of\r\n\r\n$293 million, of which $24 million will be spent on education,\r\n\r\n$3.5 million on health, and $125 million on national development\r\n\r\nin respect of the construction of roads, bridges and drains. So\r\n\r\nwhether it is in the Annual Estimates or the Development\r\n\r\nEstimates, one can see the reflection of a special feature, and\r\n\r\nthat is, the Government regards the improvement of the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of the people as more important than anything else.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely the principle of socialism, of obtaining money\r\n\r\nfrom society and using it on society. In other countries, the\r\n\r\ngreater part of the national revenue is used for the purchase of\r\n\r\naeroplanes, guns and military expansion, or on the construction\r\n\r\nof such white elephants as a national stadium and luxurious\r\n\r\nhotels, while the people there have to live in great\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Statement of the Minister for Finance has\r\n\r\ngiven a comprehensive analysis of the economic situation in\r\n\r\nSingapore. In his conclusion, he says, in the next few years our\r\n\r\neconomic future is rather bleak. But, he continues, if we carry\r\n\r\nout with determination our industrialisation programme, then we\r\n\r\nshall be able to overcome the temporary difficulties and go on\r\n\r\nour way to nationhood and national construction. The way of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation is the correct way. It is the way any new\r\n\r\nemergent nation should take towards economic independence. Just\r\n\r\nnow, the Member for Jalan Kayu has said: What is the use of this\r\n\r\npresent industrialisation programme? Although in America and\r\n\r\nBritain, industry is well developed, a lot of people are still\r\n\r\nunemployed. My reply is that this argument is tainted with\r\n\r\nMarxism and Communism which denies the achievement of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. According to his logic, we should not resort\r\n\r\nto any industrialisation; we should not open up any factories or\r\n\r\ndo any business! That is a very negative way of thinking. The\r\n\r\nstand of the Communists is that this should be so in their\r\n\r\nstruggle, because if they can bring all industries to a\r\n\r\nstandstill, then the people will be unemployed and there will be\r\n\r\ndiscontent among them. The Communists can then take advantage of\r\n\r\nthis position in accordance with their so-called \"revolutionary\r\n\r\nactivities\". But if you take the history of the world in\r\n\r\ngeneral, you will see that in every country where there is a\r\n\r\ngenuine desire to build up its economy, an industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme is a must; it is inevitable that such a programme\r\n\r\nshould be carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not to be denied that, as a result of the last one\r\n\r\nyear of Indonesian confrontation and the two occasions of\r\n\r\ndisturbances in Singapore, there has been some decline in\r\n\r\ncommerce and trade. Merchants and businessmen will tell you that\r\n\r\ntimes now are not so good as they were before. Now what are we\r\n\r\ngoing to do about it? Mr Speaker, we must first find out the\r\n\r\ncauses that have brought about this situation, and then we can\r\n\r\nprescribe the medicine or find a remedy for them. Members of the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis have said that all these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficulties have been brought about as a result of the\r\n\r\nformation of Malaysia. On the face of it, this may be sp; but I\r\n\r\nsay that the matter is not so simple as they make it out to be.\r\n\r\nMalaysia, basically speaking, is a healthy scheme which is\r\n\r\naccepted and supported by the people of the four countries and\r\n\r\nby many countries in the world. How can the Barisan Sosialis say\r\n\r\nthat the scheme to form Malaysia has brought about difficulties\r\n\r\nis that the Indonesians are giving is trouble and, sad to say\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis are helping them to give us more trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, Malaysia and Indonesian should not interfere with\r\n\r\neach other. Indonesia's economic bankruptcy shows up the\r\n\r\ninability of their leaders. The economic prosperity of Malaysia,\r\n\r\non the other hand, is a blessing that we should be proud of. But\r\n\r\nbecause the belligerent elements in Indonesia desire to swallow\r\n\r\nus up and make use of Malaysia as an excuse, like West Irian, to\r\n\r\ndivert the attention of the Indonesian people from their\r\n\r\neconomic embarrassment and difficulties, they have therefore\r\n\r\nresorted to giving us a great deal of trouble. Because of all\r\n\r\nthese factors that I have just mentioned, the Indonesian\r\n\r\nbelligerent elements, who are burning with ambition and who are\r\n\r\ntrying to put the blame for their economics bankruptcy on\r\n\r\nothers, have found a scape-goat in Malaysia, such difficulties\r\n\r\nwould still have befallen us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor is that the economy of Singapore is\r\n\r\ndependent o the entrepot trade - it is an entrepot economy\r\n\r\nbasically speaking. As the Barisan Sosialis Members have said,\r\n\r\nwe have to live on an entrepot economy has its weaknesses.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, entrepot trade is doomed to decline in \r\n\r\nSouth-East Asia, with or without the establishment of Malaysia. It is\r\n\r\nonly a matter of time when such a decline will come about. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir the first weakness of an entrepot economy is that\r\n\r\nit is unable to maintain the livelihood of many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople. In a thinly-populated country, it may bring about an\r\n\r\nephemeral prosperity; but in a country where the population is\r\n\r\nfast increasing, this kind of economy will not be able to\r\n\r\nmaintain its population, and there will be general unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hong Kong is one of the famous entrepot ports in Asia, but\r\n\r\nit is not only the entrepot trade that maintains the livelihood\r\n\r\nof the majority of its workers but also the industries that have\r\n\r\nbeen established there after the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the second weakness of an entrepot economy is that\r\n\r\nit must necessarily depend on neighbouring countries. We cannot\r\n\r\nhave a big say or any say at all, as ours is an economy which is\r\n\r\ndependent on others, If the economy of our neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries is getting prosperous, then they will try to do away\r\n\r\nwith having to pay commissions to middlemen in entrepot ports;\r\n\r\nentrepot ports will not be welcome by them. On the other hand,\r\n\r\nif the economy of our neighbouring countries is on the decline\r\n\r\nor even on the brink of bankruptcy, then their purchasing power\r\n\r\nwill be very much weakened and this again will bring about a\r\n\r\ndecline in our entrepot trade. So it cuts both ways. Furthermore\r\n\r\nif our neighbouring countries are hostile, then it goes without\r\n\r\nsaying that we will lose all our entrepot trade with such\r\n\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one condition under which entrepot trade can\r\n\r\nflourish and that is if all our neighbouring countries arc\r\n\r\ncolonies, so that we will be able to make a profit. This goes to\r\n\r\nshow that in this respect we can have no say. We have to depend\r\n\r\non our neighbouring countries to earn our livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last War, the entrepot trade in Singapore has\r\n\r\nbeen declining. This is not because we have made enemies of our\r\n\r\nneighbours who do not come to do any more business with us. It\r\n\r\nis because after the War, many colonies, one after another,\r\n\r\nbecame independent countries, and they want to maintain their\r\n\r\neconomic rights and do away with their dependency on foreign\r\n\r\nentrepot ports. Even in the case of Malaya, before the formation\r\n\r\nof Malaysia, it spent a large sum of money on the development of\r\n\r\nits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nown port - Port Swettenham - so that its dependency on the port\r\n\r\nof Singapore may be reduced in spite of the better facilities\r\n\r\nthat we are able to offer it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, one can see clearly that every country thinks in terms\r\n\r\nof its own interests. Every country tries to export its own\r\n\r\nproduce directly to foreign markets and also to buy directly\r\n\r\nfrom such markets the consumer goods that they want, so that it\r\n\r\ndoes not have to pay any commission at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, no country in the world will allow the\r\n\r\nlife-stream of its economy to be in the hands of foreign traders and\r\n\r\nbusinessmen. So, even without the formation of Malaysia, it\r\n\r\nwould have been a matter of time when we would have to give up\r\n\r\nour dependency on entrepot trade with Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the greater part of our trade with\r\n\r\nIndonesia lies in barter trade. Actually, barter trade is a\r\n\r\neuphemism for \"smuggling\". Even many years before confrontation\r\n\r\nstarted, the Indonesian Government had asked us to stop this\r\n\r\nkind of smuggling trade or business, because they had discovered\r\n\r\nthat it had contributed to their economic bankruptcy. The\r\n\r\nIndonesian Government blamed the smugglers for their failure and\r\n\r\nlosses in the economic field. They felt that smuggling had\r\n\r\nbrought about big losses to the Indonesian economy. Indonesian\r\n\r\nrubber in great bulk came into Singapore in this way and\r\n\r\nIndonesia was therefore unable to earn any foreign exchange. Now\r\n\r\nwhat has happened to the money that was earned'? The building of\r\n\r\nthe Indonesian Consulate in Singapore - the building which the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister has referred to as \"the building with a golden\r\n\r\nroof\" - cost about $2 or $3 million. Now, where did they get the\r\n\r\nmoney to erect this building? Did the money come from the\r\n\r\nIndonesian Government? No, because they have been in a state of\r\n\r\npoverty as a result of inflation. How then could they have\r\n\r\nafforded to pay hard cash to build such a glamorous and\r\n\r\nwonderful Indonesian Consulate in Singapore? The money came from\r\n\r\nIndonesian businessmen. Now, where did they get the money? Of\r\n\r\ncourse,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwool comes from sheep; so, needless to say, the money came from\r\n\r\nthe sale of Indonesian local produce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all this, one can see a number of anomalies. Indonesia\r\n\r\nproduces and sells rubber and yet it is in a state of poverty\r\n\r\nand even on the brink of economic bankruptcy, so much so that\r\n\r\nits people have to live on rats and corn. On the other hand, we\r\n\r\nare only an entrepot centre and yet we enjoy economic prosperity\r\n\r\nand even had a surplus from year to year. Of course, this annoys\r\n\r\nIndonesia. So with or without Malaysia, in the event of\r\n\r\nIndonesia trying to reshuffle its economic affairs, it must\r\n\r\nnecessarily try to stop this kind of business and trade. After\r\n\r\nthe formation of Malaysia, they found an excuse to stop all\r\n\r\ntrade with us over-night. In my view, even without Malaysia,\r\n\r\nIndonesia would have severed trade relations with us step by\r\n\r\nstep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Mr Speaker, is the general and inevitable economic\r\n\r\ntrend in South-East Asia. It is in the interest of every nation\r\n\r\nto establish economic independence. So, how can one say that all\r\n\r\nthe present difficulties we are facing have been brought about\r\n\r\nby Malaysia alone? The question now is whether we should have an\r\n\r\neconomy dependent on others or find another way to support\r\n\r\nourselves by our own means. If that is the question, then I say\r\n\r\nthat Malaysia's industrialisation programme, coupled with the\r\n\r\ncommon market, is the one and only solution. As a result of the\r\n\r\nfailure of their businesses, some people think that Singapore\r\n\r\nshould withdraw from Malaysia and do business with Indonesia as\r\n\r\na neutral State. I say that this is impossible. If we withdraw\r\n\r\nfrom Malaysia, irrespective of whether how long we can do\r\n\r\nbusiness with Indonesia, where do we actually stand? Assuming\r\n\r\nthat we did not join Malaysia, where would we be standing now?\r\n\r\nOur country is too small to be independent. Even if we should\r\n\r\nbecome independent, we would still have to depend on the\r\n\r\nprotection of foreign bases to survive and from being swallowed\r\n\r\nup by our bigger neighbours. Foreign bases would still remain in\r\n\r\nSingapore and they would continue to be an eye-sore, as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfar as Indonesia is concerned. So confrontation again would be\r\n\r\ninevitable and there would not be any business done between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Indonesia. If, on the other hand, we did away with\r\n\r\nall the foreign bases, then at once we would be swallowed up by\r\n\r\nIndonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, whether military bases are here or not, we will be at a\r\n\r\ndisadvantage. Now if we do not emerge as an independent nation,\r\n\r\nthen in what form can Singapore emerge'! Bearing in mind that\r\n\r\nSingapore is only a sniall island, are we going back to the\r\n\r\ncolonial days and living under the umbrella of British\r\n\r\ncolonialists? No, this will be putting back the clock. Are we\r\n\r\ngoing to maintain neutrality? in that event, we shall be\r\n\r\nsandwiched between two big neighbours, namely, Indonesia and\r\n\r\nMalaysia. Now, have we got the power and the strength to stand\r\n\r\nbetween two such neighbours?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is, strategically speaking, a very important\r\n\r\nplace, in the event of Malaysia and Indonesia struggling with\r\n\r\neach other. So, either of these two will try to swallow us up.\r\n\r\nIn such an event, we would rather be with Malaysia than with\r\n\r\nIndonesia, because we know the kind of life the Indonesians are\r\n\r\nliving. This is a difficult way towards nation building. These\r\n\r\nare the difficulties we have to experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has coined a slogan in his statement\r\n\r\nwhich is very clear and short, i.e., through industrialisation \r\n\r\nand a common market, we must lead our people Out of their present\r\n\r\neconomic difficulties. Our present task is two-fold. On the one hand,\r\n\r\nwe have to spend on social reforms within our revenue and lay the \r\n\r\nfoundation of a welfare State, so that the seeds of socialism may be \r\n\r\nsown widely in the whole of Malaysia. On the other hand, we have\r\n\r\nto try to tide over the present economic difficulties and withstand \r\n\r\nIndonesian confrontation. This task is not easy, Mr Speaker, but we will\r\n\r\ntry our best to accomplish it. We are prepared to sink or swim\r\n\r\nwith the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the greatness of a nation or a people does not\r\n\r\nlie in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmilitary strength. I would say it lies in this - how the people\r\n\r\ncan accept the challenge of the day; how the people can\r\n\r\nwithstand the test of time. We shall not bow to our enemies and\r\n\r\nwe shall not succumb to our difficulties. Only in this way can\r\n\r\nwe stand in this world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Dr Fong Kim Heng) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I predict that the next\r\n\r\nfinancial year will be more bleak and worse than this year's.\r\n\r\nThis year we have already had a $23 million deficit. I believe\r\n\r\nthat next year's deficit will exceed it. This is my\r\n\r\nunderstanding on reading the Financial Statement and after\r\n\r\nmaking an analysis of the Malaysia situation. No matter how the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance tries to negate the repercussions of'\r\n\r\nIndonesian confrontation, the facts which cannot be covered up\r\n\r\nare that we have had a trade recession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me make a comparison of the trade before and after\r\n\r\nIndonesian confrontation. According to my data, for the first\r\n\r\nquarter of this year, the export trade of Singapore was in the\r\n\r\nregion of $3,376.9 million in terms of value. But the figure for\r\n\r\nthe corresponding period of last year was $4,703.8 million.\r\n\r\nThus, there was a difference of $1,389 million. In exports, the\r\n\r\nfigure for the first quarter of this year was $881 million, and\r\n\r\nthe figure for the corresponding period of last year was $396\r\n\r\nmillion. Thus, the increase was 31 per cent. According to\r\n\r\nofficial statistics, before the Indonesian confrontation, the\r\n\r\ntotal value of trade between Singapore and Indonesia was $90\r\n\r\nmillion, 70 per cent of which was from Indonesia. The exports\r\n\r\nfrom Singapore to Indonesia were 30 per cent. Taking an average\r\n\r\nof $90 million a month, in one year the annual trade between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Indonesia was in the region of $1,080 million.\r\n\r\nAssuming that our businessmen could make a 15 per cent profit\r\n\r\nout of it, there would be $162 million for our national income.\r\n\r\nThe loss of $16 million in our national income could only be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\nfelt by the taxi-drivers and small businessmen and hawkers,\r\n\r\nbecause they were directly hit by the trade severance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of our trade with Indonesia has stopped, apart from\r\n\r\nsome trade between Singapore and Hong Kong. According to my\r\n\r\nestimate, the taxi-drivers have suffered a 40 per cent loss of\r\n\r\ntheir income, and some hawkers have pulled down their pitches.\r\n\r\nSome workers have not yet been able to find alternative jobs.\r\n\r\nBusinessmen have not been able to find alternative openings for\r\n\r\ntheir capital. Throughout the whole island people are talking\r\n\r\nabout thrift. They want to be frugal in their food, clothing and\r\n\r\nother daily necessities. They even want to be thrifty on enter\r\n\r\ntainment. They have cut down their smoking, which has resulted\r\n\r\nin a decrease in our revenue from entertainment and tobacco. All\r\n\r\nthis has been brought about by Indonesian confrontation. It has\r\n\r\nalso been brought about by the so-called happiness and\r\n\r\nprosperity resulting from Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To restore trade between Singapore and Indonesia would be\r\n\r\nbeneficial to our people. All trade throughout the world is\r\n\r\nbased on mutual interest and mutual benefit. Without any\r\n\r\npolitical strings, I believe that trade between Indonesia and\r\n\r\nSingapore can be reestablished. The only obstacle in the way of\r\n\r\nrestoration of trade between Indonesia and Singapore is the neo\r\n\r\ncolonialist Malaysia and the sabotage carried out by the\r\n\r\nAlliance Government and the P.A.P. Government. Unless the\r\n\r\nAlliance Government and the P.A.P. Government correct their\r\n\r\nmistakes, trade between Indonesia and Singapore will not be\r\n\r\nrestored. Our Government always abuse the Indonesian people by\r\n\r\nsaying that they eat rats and corn. This abusive language will\r\n\r\nnot help to solve our economic problem. The people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwill not derive any happiness from the fact that the Indonesian\r\n\r\npeople are eating rats. I feel that this is political\r\n\r\npropaganda, to create a feeling of hostility towards the\r\n\r\nIndonesian people. It is similar to the propaganda put out by\r\n\r\nthe Lim Yew Hock regime and the P.A.P. Government when they say\r\n\r\nthat the Chinese people on the Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmainland are eating the bark of trees and straws. Such cynical\r\n\r\npropaganda will not help us anymore. What we are concerned about\r\n\r\nis that trade between Singapore and Indonesia should be res\r\n\r\ntored. According to the Minister for Finance, trade relations\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and Indonesia will not be solved next year.\r\n\r\nMalaysia is now trying to arm itself by embarking on armament.\r\n\r\nThere are only two ways open to us. First, to seek a solution in\r\n\r\norder to restore our trade; and secondly to make use of\r\n\r\narmaments for mutual suicide. If we are asked to make a choice,\r\n\r\nwe will unhesitatingly choose the first one. I believe the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government and the Alliance Government are not prepared\r\n\r\nto do such things, because that would not be beneficial to them\r\n\r\nas they are afraid to embark on this course. It will also not be\r\n\r\nbeneficial to the Anglo-American imperialists. The Party in\r\n\r\npower is not going to solve our trade problems by a political\r\n\r\nsolution and abandoning the lines of Anglo-American imperialism\r\n\r\nto change our foreign policy to implement inner democracy. I\r\n\r\nbelieve that these are the things that we should do. We should\r\n\r\nre-establish friendly relations between these two countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> What is the Member's point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> This has nothing to do with the Budget\r\n\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Will the Member proceed with his speech\r\n\r\nand stick to the financial policy of the Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis is the only way to be free from the control of the big\r\n\r\nPowers.

Lt is a brutal fact and a reality\r\n\r\nand the Minister has tried to cover it up, because if it is made\r\n\r\nknown to the people, then they will rise up against him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt also shows that the Party in power is not willing to solve\r\n\r\nour problem. In his financial speech the Minister has talked\r\n\r\nabout the failure of Indonesian confrontation. But may I ask,\r\n\r\nwho is the victor'! It is a fraud on the people to say that we\r\n\r\nhave not been affected by Indonesian confrontation. To say that\r\n\r\nwe are the victor, what have we won'! On the contrary, we have\r\n\r\nlost trade amounting to millions of dollars. Workers, hawkers\r\n\r\nand taxi-drivers have suffered hardships. Can you term this as a\r\n\r\nvictory'! Now, when the P.A.P. talks about victory, it means\r\n\r\nthat the people are suffering. Therefore, we cannot deny that\r\n\r\nthe severance of trade between Singapore and Indonesia has done\r\n\r\ngreater harm to the people of Singapore. The Government should\r\n\r\nfind ways and means to solve this problem. It should pay\r\n\r\nattention to this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the Budget. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\naccording to this year's Budget, there is a deficit of $23\r\n\r\nmillion. The P.A.P. is forced to admit that this has been brought\r\n\r\nabout by Malaysia. The Minister for Finance may be anxious to\r\n\r\nget two sums of money from the Central Government. The first sum\r\n\r\nof money is the contribution by the Central Government to the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore, namely, $12 million; and the other sum\r\n\r\nof money is the profits of the Currency Board prior to the 31st\r\n\r\nAugust, 1963. These two sums total $23 million. Even if these\r\n\r\nsums of money were handed to Singapore, we would still incur a\r\n\r\ndeficit of $7 million, and it is doubtful whether the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment will hand over these two sums of money to Singapore.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we have to contribute 40 per cent of our State revenue\r\n\r\nto the Central Government, amounting to $127 million. In the\r\n\r\npast, the Minister boasted of a $50 million surplus, but from\r\n\r\nthis year onwards we will incur a $23 million deficit. Plus\r\n\r\nthese two sums, it means there is a deficit of $73 million. The\r\n\r\nMinister has cautioned that we should be more careful in our\r\n\r\nexpenditure. This only shows that expenditure has increased so\r\n\r\nmuch that revenue cannot catch up with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our contributions to the Central Government in\r\n\r\nthe fields of defence and other services have been too much. Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, the so-called too much expenditure and too\r\n\r\nlittle revenue is not a very good pretext. Does the Minister\r\n\r\nmean that certain revenues are being spent on unnecessary and\r\n\r\nunworthy things? I feel that the reason is not merely that, but\r\n\r\nthat it is because we have been paying too much to the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment. The Minister says that there has been a rapid\r\n\r\nincrease of expenditure. In fact, this should not occur. In\r\n\r\ncomparing the 1965 Budget with the 1964 Budget, there is an\r\n\r\nincrease of $13.7 million in expenditure. The expenditure for\r\n\r\n1962 was $392.4 million. This figure, when compared with this\r\n\r\nyear's $326 million, shows an increase of $66 million, and is\r\n\r\n$53 million more than that of next year. This shows that our\r\n\r\neconomy is retrograding and is not getting better. I will give\r\n\r\nHong Kong as an example. From 1951 to 1961 the Budget has\r\n\r\nincreased from $170 million to $1,010 million, an average of $90\r\n\r\nmillion increase every year. According to our figures, we should\r\n\r\nhave increased by $40 million per year, but our estimate for\r\n\r\nnext year is $53 million less than that for 1962. How can the\r\n\r\nParty in power explain this fact? One thing which we should\r\n\r\nbear in mind is that our contribution to the Central Government\r\n\r\nin respect of defence and other Federal Departments will cause a\r\n\r\nbigger deficiency in our Budget. The results of the Alliance\r\n\r\nGovernment's expansion in armament will naturally bring more bur\r\n\r\nden to the people. The people of Singapore have no obligation to\r\n\r\nshare this burden, because they do not have equal citizenship\r\n\r\nrights and cannot participate in decisions such as defence and\r\n\r\ncannot attack the Central Government on any policy in this\r\n\r\nfield. In the event of war, I feel that it is not right for the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore to shoulder such a responsibility to\r\n\r\ncontribute to the Federal Government. If the Federal Government\r\n\r\nwere to ask the people of Singapore to shoulder such an extra\r\n\r\nburden, then the people of Singapore would have to tighten their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbelts and there would be more suffering. Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, although the Minister for Finance has said that we should\r\n\r\ncontribute towards the defence of the Central Government, I do\r\n\r\nnot know whether it has been stipulated in the 40 per cent White\r\n\r\nPaper arrangement. Perhaps it is over and above that. I want to\r\n\r\nreiterate what the Minister has said to prove one fact. He has\r\n\r\nmentioned in his Budget Speech that the main revenues are from\r\n\r\nincome tax, taxes on liquor, petroleum and tobacco, road tax and\r\n\r\nestate tax - all this revenue belongs to the Central Government.\r\n\r\nTherefore, any change in the rates of taxes by the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment will have an influence and effect on our revenue.\r\n\r\nNow it is very interesting to talk about the discretion to\r\n\r\nchange the rates of taxes. It also means that there will be a\r\n\r\nchange of 60 versus 40 per cent distribution of taxes. According\r\n\r\nto the Central Government's economic plan, it is really to cut\r\n\r\nthe fat from the people of Singapore. As a result of changes in\r\n\r\nthe rates of taxes exercised by the Central Government,\r\n\r\nSingapore's contribution will be increased from 40 per cent to\r\n\r\n50 per cent. Thus the P.A.P. will have to explain to the people\r\n\r\nsuch a sell-out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the P.A.P. whether next year the Central Government\r\n\r\nwill try to change the rates of taxes pertaining to Federal\r\n\r\nrevenue and whether, because of expenditure on armament, the\r\n\r\nreserve fund of the Central Government has decreased. They are\r\n\r\ntalking about increasing taxes. Even trunk-call taxes will be\r\n\r\nraised. And the Minister for Finance pretends that he does not\r\n\r\nknow anything about it! He says that at this stage we do not\r\n\r\nknow anything about the Federal Government's plan to change the\r\n\r\nrate of taxation. Our revenue estimates have been based on our\r\n\r\nassumption of the Federal decision on taxes. Does the Minister\r\n\r\nmean that he does not know anything about the changes by the\r\n\r\nFederal Government in respect of taxes? Does he mean that it is\r\n\r\na unilateral action exercisable by the Federation Government\r\n\r\nalone, and that the P.A.P. Government does not know anything\r\n\r\nabout it? This only shows that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. is shirking its responsibility to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next year, our revenue will decrease by $1.7\r\n\r\nmillion. According to what the Minister has said, it is because\r\n\r\ncurrency profits and port dues have gone over to the Central\r\n\r\nBank. Now, this is concrete proof of the P.A.P.'s sell-out.\r\n\r\nPerhaps next year there will be more factories asking the Min\r\n\r\nister to officiate at their opening ceremonies! But the main\r\n\r\neconomy of Singapore depends on entrepot trade, and such a\r\n\r\nsituation cannot be changed overnight to an industrial one.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the reduction of entrepot trade would naturally\r\n\r\nseriously affect the economy of Singapore. Yet the Party in\r\n\r\npower, to cover up its weaknesses, is still claiming that\r\n\r\nseveral factories will be opened every week. I should say that\r\n\r\nthe industrialisation policy should be coupled with the\r\n\r\nreduction of those unemployed. The reduction in exports and the\r\n\r\nincrease in imports have caused an unfavourable economic balance\r\n\r\nand have caused suffering to the workers. If the people allow a\r\n\r\nlarge amount of foreign capital to come into Singapore, then\r\n\r\nSingapore will only become a great factory for the foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists and the workers will have to sell their labour to\r\n\r\nsuch capitalists for very poor wages. The situation is already\r\n\r\nclear at the Jurong industrial site. Their wages compared with\r\n\r\nthose for workers in other fields are very poor indeed. My\r\n\r\ncolleague has just mentioned that their wages range from fifty\r\n\r\ncents to one dollar per day. Their situation is very difficult.\r\n\r\nTo use a phrase, they are in a state of semi-starvation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has said\r\n\r\nthat the next financial year will be quite bleak. We can also\r\n\r\nsee that, because it is full of pessimism and we do not have any\r\n\r\noptimistic evaluation of the situation. Perhaps the situation\r\n\r\nmay even get worse, much worse than what the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance has envisaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want also to mention the hopes of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore. They hope that they can resume trade relations with\r\n\r\nIndonesia as soon as possible. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParty in power should help local capitalists to industrialize.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the livelihood and living standards of the hawkers,\r\n\r\ntaxi-drivers, Government officers and teachers and farmers\r\n\r\nshould be raised. The Government should help them. It should\r\n\r\nadopt a non-aligned policy, have close and friendly relation\r\n\r\nships with Afro-Asian countries, expand our trade, and establish\r\n\r\ngood neighbourliness with our neighbours. Thus there will be\r\n\r\nhope for industrialisation in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nshould like to congratulate the Minister for Finance on\r\n\r\npresenting a Budget which appears to reflect the optimistic\r\n\r\noutlook of the State and her readiness to overcome the economic\r\n\r\neffects of Indonesia's confrontation. At the outset, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has understandably stressed the magnitude\r\n\r\nof confrontation and the impact it has on the economy of Singa\r\n\r\npore. Nevertheless, he has also maintained that the economy\r\n\r\nduring the initial stages was able to recover from the after\r\n\r\neffects of Indonesian confrontation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the Opposition Party, we do not deny that\r\n\r\nconfrontation has resulted in additional men and women being\r\n\r\nthrown out of employment. We are fully aware of the fact that we\r\n\r\nhave to live with confrontation and, as such, the economy, to a\r\n\r\ncertain extent, has to be re-orientated in such a manner that we\r\n\r\ncan stand on our own feet and not depend on Indonesian trade\r\n\r\nalone. Unlike the Barisan who want us to be slaves to trade with\r\n\r\nIndonesia, we cannot afford to be a vassal of another foreign\r\n\r\ncountry for the sake of trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have our own national dignity, prestige and pride\r\n\r\nto be a part of an independent nation, that is, Malaysia. That\r\n\r\nbeing the case, even though the curtailment of the trade between\r\n\r\nour country and Indonesia has resulted in severe setbacks to the\r\n\r\neconomy, such offsets to the economy are only temporary in\r\n\r\nnature and, as such, ways and means have to be found to overcome\r\n\r\nthem. I do not, for a moment, minimise the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsignificance of the adverse effects on the economy arising out\r\n\r\nof the Indonesian economic blockade. We have to live with\r\n\r\nconfrontation and at the same time we must find ways and means\r\n\r\nto reorientate our economy on a sound footing. In this\r\n\r\nconnection, Sir, the Malaysian common market which appears to be\r\n\r\nstill in the offing and which has not been fully implemented up\r\n\r\nto now, should necessarily take effect immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Government, which has agreed to a Malaysian\r\n\r\ncommon market, must honour its pledge specially at this juncture\r\n\r\nwhen Singapore is badly in need of a catalyst to accelerate the\r\n\r\npace of economic activity, not only to recover from the economic\r\n\r\noffsets but also to carry on the positive programme of in\r\n\r\ndustrialisation. The Government at Kuala Lumpur should extend\r\n\r\nits full co-operation to the State and permit the State's\r\n\r\neconomy to recover from its recent offsets. The Malaysian common\r\n\r\nmarket, as far as Singapore is concerned, is a necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jurong Industrial complex will have no meaning at all\r\n\r\nunless a market is assured for most of them in the Malaysian\r\n\r\nregion. In this connection, it is heartening to observe that the\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme at the Jurong industrial estate and\r\n\r\nthe other measures taken by the Government to absorb the\r\n\r\nunemployed have borne fruit. Nevertheless, I feel it is\r\n\r\nessential that, before we plan our future and put our economy on\r\n\r\na sound footing or take measures on industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogrammes, we should necessarily be aware of the prevailing\r\n\r\nsituation and the not too bright employment situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a representative of the people, Sir, practically every\r\n\r\nweek during the meet-the-people sessions, I am facing unemployed\r\n\r\nyouths who approach me with a hungry look and a pathetic\r\n\r\nexpression on their faces. I feel so unhappy, Sir. Since I am\r\n\r\nnot the Minister for Finance, I cannot quote a few figures to\r\n\r\nconvince them that the situation after all is not so bad. Unless\r\n\r\nthe State implements policies with an eye to employment op\r\n\r\nportunities, these unemployed youngsters are bound to fall prey\r\n\r\nto Communist propaganda, and we in turn are indirectly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrendering a helping hand to recruit more youths to the Marxist\r\n\r\ndoctrine. Sir, this is indeed a grave situation and only a crash\r\n\r\nprogramme will solve the unemployment situation. The State's\r\n\r\nentire economy should be placed on a war footing, and no efforts\r\n\r\nshould be spared to see that the Government's programme for\r\n\r\nindustrialisation, with emphasis on a labour intensive approach,\r\n\r\nshould be implemented with the minimum of delay. I can observe\r\n\r\nthe shadow of Communism appearing on the Opposition benches of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis, ready to grab our youths and make use of\r\n\r\nthem as guinea pigs to propagate ideals which are contrary to\r\n\r\nour democratic principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Ministry of Culture's tirades against Communism will\r\n\r\nnot be effective unless they are supplemented by challenging\r\n\r\neconomic policies so that, in the eventual analysis, it will be\r\n\r\nrealised by the public at large that the Government's economic\r\n\r\nmeasures have really resulted in a solution to the unemployment\r\n\r\nsituation prevailing in the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, when analysing the Budget in detail, I\r\n\r\nfind that, unlike previous years, this year's Budget appears on\r\n\r\nthe deficit side, but the days are gone when those who believed\r\n\r\nin Gladstonian economy would applaud the Minister when he\r\n\r\nsubmitted a surplus Budget. When public projects have to be\r\n\r\nfinanced and when welfare economics gets more prominence, a\r\n\r\ndeficit Budget only reflects the amount of economic activity\r\n\r\nthat is going on in the State. As such, I would rather applaud\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance for presenting a bold Budget which\r\n\r\nessentially caters for the interests of the common man in\r\n\r\nSingapore. It also reflects the Government's determination to\r\n\r\nutilise the resources of the country in such a manner that the\r\n\r\nhave-nots will eventually benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall not want to go further in detail since all of\r\n\r\nus are in possession of a copy of the Budget speech, but a\r\n\r\nthorough analysis makes one think for a moment that the\r\n\r\nGovernment is going\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nahead with its gigantic programme for industrialisation and\r\n\r\nreduction of unemployment. It is its intention to provide more\r\n\r\nsocial services and also to ensure that children of school-going\r\n\r\nage get the facilities to continue their studies. We must\r\n\r\nunderstand that in this particular year, the State Government\r\n\r\nhas been subjected to additional strain. Still it is determined\r\n\r\nto make an effort to establish a socialist pattern of society\r\n\r\nwithin the framework of democracy. All-right thinking men inside\r\n\r\nthis Assembly as well as outside it should give their\r\n\r\nunqualified support to the measures taken by the Government to\r\n\r\nput the economy on a sound footing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\nspeak only shortly on the direct factors causing the present\r\n\r\ndifficulties in our economic field. The 1965 Budget generally\r\n\r\nsays that the financial year shows that the recurrent $50\r\n\r\nmillion surplus has gone. It says, with a note of despondency,\r\n\r\nthat the P.A.P. Government is not only unable to balance our\r\n\r\neconomy but also that there has been a deficit of some $20\r\n\r\nmillion. The Minister for Finance, in sketching the picture,\r\n\r\nsays that the situation is rather severe, because in the short\r\n\r\nspace of one year after the formation of Malaysia, the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment has to come from a state of surplus to that of a\r\n\r\ndeficit. Mr Speaker. Sir, the economic changes are drastic and\r\n\r\nsevere. Why should that be so? The Minister for Finance has not\r\n\r\ndealt with the real causes, but it is not difficult for us to\r\n\r\nfind out what they are. First, there has been a decline in the\r\n\r\nexport and import trade. For the first half-year the import\r\n\r\ntotal came to only $1,362 million. There was a difference of\r\n\r\n$427 million. The export figures for the first half year show\r\n\r\nthat it was $881 million. Compared with the figure for last\r\n\r\nyear, there was a difference of some $396 million. This figure,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, was only 31 per cent of last year's. It was\r\n\r\nbelow some $823 million compared to the figures in the period\r\n\r\nbefore Malaysia. This drop actually has been brought about by\r\n\r\nMalaysia. That is the first point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n             \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is this. We have been\r\n\r\nmaking -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon:</b> I will not give way because time is\r\n\r\nrunning short. I have very little time left.[Interruption] \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): We have been making too much contribution to\r\n\r\nthe Central Government. The contributions that we have to make\r\n\r\nto the Central Government include the sum of $120 million which\r\n\r\nwe would not have to give away without Malaysia, and which we\r\n\r\ncould have used for our own people if Malaysia had not been\r\n\r\nformed. Therefore, on the side of expenditure we would not have\r\n\r\nto be so cautious as the Minister for Finance has suggested that\r\n\r\nwe should be. Thirdly, Mr Speaker, Sir, another factor of the\r\n\r\npresent economic difficulties is this. We have been rather weak\r\n\r\nin the face of the Central Government. I can give you one clear\r\n\r\nexample to illustrate this point. The Minister for Finance in\r\n\r\nhis statement mentions that the severance of trade between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Indonesia is a great blow to Singapore as far as\r\n\r\nwe are concerned, but he has not got the courage to suggest to\r\n\r\nthe Central Government to re-establish trade, and the barter\r\n\r\ntrade in particular, with Indonesia. When the Central Government\r\n\r\nimposed this ban on barter trade, the people affected were very\r\n\r\nunhappy and wanted the Central Government and the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment to find a solution. According to estimates, there are\r\n\r\nsome 200,000 persons directly or indirectly affected by this ban\r\n\r\non barter trade. For the sake of our economic future, I urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment to review the Malaysia scheme and break away from\r\n\r\nforeign control before we can really solve our own problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, in his Budget\r\n\r\nStatement the Minister for Finance says that tile present\r\n\r\neconomic situation is very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstable in spite of Indonesian confrontation, that it has not\r\n\r\naffected us very gravely. I wish to show with facts that his\r\n\r\nstatement is only good-looking superficially. The people of\r\n\r\nSingapore know that in the famous amusement parks like the Great\r\n\r\nWorld and Happy World, business was very good at night. But in\r\n\r\nthe space of one year of Malaysia's formation, our so-called\r\n\r\nprosperity has made the amusement parks rather quiet and\r\n\r\ndeserted. In one of the amusement parks, admission is now free,\r\n\r\nbut in spite of that, visitors are very few in number. Shops in\r\n\r\nthis amusement park have no business to do; some of them have\r\n\r\nclosed down. In the case of the Gay World, formerly known as the\r\n\r\nHappy World, we can see that shops which were very busy in the\r\n\r\npast have to close down and have to auction their furniture.\r\n\r\nThis is a good illustration to show the falsehood that our\r\n\r\neconomy is stable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now we come to examine the extent of the\r\n\r\nso-called stability of our economy. If you go to South Bridge\r\n\r\nRoad, you will see that there is one shop known as One Million\r\n\r\nwhich was very flourishing and prosperous in the past, before\r\n\r\nMalaysia. But after one year of Malaysia, in spite of the \r\n\r\nso-called economic stability, this shop has to close down and some\r\n\r\nof the goods have to be auctioned on the five-foot way. There\r\n\r\nare other businessmen and merchants who have had to do less\r\n\r\nbusiness. They tried to recover their bad debts and do a minimum\r\n\r\nof business. The business done this year has not been enough to\r\n\r\nkeep the shops going. They have to continue the wholesale\r\n\r\nbusiness in order to try to recover their old debts. We know\r\n\r\nthat in the business world of the Chinese community, it is a\r\n\r\nmatter of trust, and business is done on credit. The wholesalers\r\n\r\nwill give goods on credit to the retailers, so they have to\r\n\r\nmaintain a minimum wholesale business in order to try to recover\r\n\r\ntheir debts from the retailers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us take a look at the rubber factories. What is the\r\n\r\nsituation! The Minister for Finance should let us know\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat there is widespread retrenchment in the\r\n\r\nfactories. He should tell the world how many workers have been\r\n\r\nretrenched. In the past, business generally was quite brisk. But\r\n\r\nthere is now an anomaly. Instead of the shops doing good\r\n\r\nbusiness, we have more and more pasar malam. A lot of hawkers do\r\n\r\nbusiness in pasar malam. This should not be taken as a\r\n\r\nreflection on the prosperity of the business world. On the\r\n\r\ncontrary, it shows that the shops and industries in Singapore\r\n\r\nare on a trade decline. There are more and more hawkers in pasar\r\n\r\nmalam. Why should that be so? It is because many workers have to\r\n\r\nleave their factories, and in order to earn a minimum\r\n\r\nlivelihood, they have no alternative but to buy some goods and\r\n\r\nsell them at the pasar malam. Or some of the shopkeepers,\r\n\r\nbecause of business failure, have to sell their goods on tri\r\n\r\ncycles in the night markets. As a result of this, there are more\r\n\r\nand more hawkers in the pasar malam and less and less\r\n\r\nshopkeepers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, night in Singapore was full of life - busy,\r\n\r\nwith a lot of people going out to enjoy themselves. In fact, in\r\n\r\nthose prosperous days one could hardly distinguish between day\r\n\r\nand night as far as activity and enjoyment were concerned. But\r\n\r\nwhat is the present situation now'! Buses are not full, a lot of\r\n\r\ntaxi-drivers are without passengers, and less and less people go\r\n\r\nout at night. So the so-called prosperity, in spite of In\r\n\r\ndonesian confrontation, is not as good as what the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance wants others to think.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about industrialisation, it is not in a position to\r\n\r\nsolve our economic ills. Can industrialisation enable\r\n\r\nbusinessmen and investors to recover their capital? To what\r\n\r\nextent is it beneficial to the workers? Can our local products\r\n\r\nbe competitive in price with foreign goods, whatever the source\r\n\r\nof raw materials'! Where is the market for our local produce? At\r\n\r\na time when we have foreign bases in our country and when we are\r\n\r\nmaking enemies with the world at large, how are we able to\r\n\r\nexpand our market for local produce? The Minister for Finance is\r\n\r\nnot able to give any answers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot deny that there are more and more houses in\r\n\r\nSingapore. But, on the other hand, there are more and more\r\n\r\npeople losing their homes in fires. The lower income group is\r\n\r\nnot able to occupy beautiful flats. The building industry is not\r\n\r\nin a position to create more employment opportunities for the\r\n\r\npoor people. So the poor people cannot afford the rent to stay\r\n\r\nin flats. They would rather stay in attap huts, because they can\r\n\r\nonly afford a low rent. So the construction programme is of no\r\n\r\nbenefit to the poor people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about overhead bridges and parking lots, these\r\n\r\nmeasures are to some extent helpful to traffic. But this is of\r\n\r\nminor importance, because we must first fill our stomach with\r\n\r\nfood. The multistorey car park is of no use to a starving\r\n\r\npopulation. The people cannot fill their stomach with the\r\n\r\nbeautiful overhead bridges, like the Bailey bridge at Clifford\r\n\r\nPier. So we feel that the failure of the Government to give a\r\n\r\nreasonable means of livelihood to the people is attributed in a\r\n\r\nlarge measure to the loss of our entrepot trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a new People's Government is not established, and so\r\n\r\nlong as the present Government is still under the control of the\r\n\r\nBritish, it is no use talking about industrialisation when we\r\n\r\nare not politically independent. The port of Singapore is coming\r\n\r\nto the end of its prosperity. If we do not scrap all the pacts\r\n\r\nthat we have signed with foreign countries, and if we do not toe\r\n\r\nthe line of the non-aligned Afro-Asian countries, then whatever\r\n\r\nplans you may have for industrialisation you cannot carry them\r\n\r\nout because you do not have sufficient raw materials and a big\r\n\r\nmarket for your products. Malaya and our neighbours will not\r\n\r\nhelp us to expand our market for local manufactures, and even if\r\n\r\nMalaya is prepared to give us some market, do you think that it\r\n\r\ncan accommodate all the produce that we can manufacture here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, the question of a common market has been\r\n\r\nhighlighted by the Singapore and the Federation Governments.\r\n\r\nThey think that the common market will provide a good outlet for\r\n\r\nour manufactured\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproducts. I say that so long as neocolonialism is not done away\r\n\r\nwith, a common market is of no help to the poor people.\r\n\r\nMerchants in Singapore will, with the advent of the common\r\n\r\nmarket, lose a lot of business in entrepot trade. More and more\r\n\r\npeople will have to pay higher prices for consumer goods, and\r\n\r\nforeign goods at competitive prices will be blocked by the\r\n\r\ncommon market. So if you want to enjoy cheap and good products,\r\n\r\nyou have to pay more, otherwise you will be forced to buy local\r\n\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If industrialisation can really solve the problems of the\r\n\r\npeople, then we will give it our support. But the future of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation is very bleak. How many merchants and workers\r\n\r\ncan the industrialisation programme accommodate - all these\r\n\r\npeople who have been affected adversely by Indonesian con\r\n\r\nfrontation'! To solve the problem of the people of Singapore, I\r\n\r\nfeel that it is important that we should come to a certain\r\n\r\nunderstanding with the nations in South-East Asia. We must shake\r\n\r\naway from the influence of the British and the Americans, and we\r\n\r\nmust establish friendship with nations of South-East Asia. We\r\n\r\nmust re-establish the trade ties that existed before Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThis is the only concrete way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one expects the Opposition\r\n\r\nat Budget time to make the most of its opportunity to paint the\r\n\r\nworst possible picture of the health of the country. And at the\r\n\r\nend of it all - if it is a democratic and constructive Opposition\r\n\r\n- one should hear how things could be made better, why some of\r\n\r\nthe things that we have been doing have not been enough, and how\r\n\r\nthey can be improved upon. From our Barisan opponents, we get\r\n\r\none consistent refrain - Malaysia is a neo-colonialist scheme;\r\n\r\nMalaysia has brought disaster to the people; nothing will\r\n\r\nresolve our problems: not the common market, not this capitalist\r\n\r\nway in which more money will be made by big business. They play\r\n\r\nonly the neutral line: that the dissolution of Malaysia, somehow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor the other, will become a chung li kuo chia (neutral), that\r\n\r\nall will be well, and that the Indonesians will leave us alone\r\n\r\nif we start trade with them. Ultimately, according to the Member\r\n\r\nfor Tampines, who hinted the way to do it is to have a real\r\n\r\nCommunist economy where there will be no unemployment and where\r\n\r\neverybody will be put to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the other Member of the Opposition, the Member for\r\n\r\nHong Lim, there is the usual opportunist tailism. He harks back\r\n\r\nwith nostalgia to colonial days when all was well. When we were\r\n\r\nin charge of the Police, the policeman saluted the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, and even the Mayor. But now all the powers are gone.\r\n\r\nWe have been emasculated. We have been robbed. The country is\r\n\r\ngoing to the dogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me try to put, not just to the\r\n\r\nOpposition but to Singapore at large, what were the two extremes - the best we could have had for Singapore and the worst which\r\n\r\nmay yet come about if we do not watch out. Paradise for\r\n\r\nSingapore would have meant a common market, no charges for water\r\n\r\nsupply, full trade with Indonesia, with Malaya and the rest of\r\n\r\nthe world, the continuance of our bases, and independence\r\n\r\nguaranteed by some mutual or multi-lateral defence pact. That\r\n\r\nwould have provided us with the ideal - paradise. No need for\r\n\r\ndefence commitments; we just keep one Infantry Battalion for\r\n\r\nceremonial purposes. In the colonial days we did not even have\r\n\r\nto do that. We got the British to pay for all that. They\r\n\r\ndefended us because it was their territory. But, unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthe world does not owe Singapore a living. The Indonesians do\r\n\r\nnot have to trade with us. And we knew as early as 1959 that it\r\n\r\nwas their intention, at the first convenient opportunity, to cut\r\n\r\noff their trade with us. And every year our man in Jakarta gave\r\n\r\nus regular reports of their plans to cut off this trade sooner\r\n\r\nor later. Hence the importance in all those years of finding a\r\n\r\nmore permanent and stable basis of survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell the Members opposite what would have happened if we\r\n\r\ndid not take the precautionary measures that we did if we did\r\n\r\nnot get a common\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarket. If we had zig-zagged in the reckless and dangerous\r\n\r\nfashion of politics in Singapore of the 1950s, not only would we\r\n\r\nhave confrontation with no trade with the Indonesians, but worse - we might have \"double confrontation\" with no trade with Malaya\r\n\r\nor Sabah or Sarawak, no common market, and with water problems.\r\n\r\nAnd to cap it all, if we were to follow the wishes of the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis and abolish British bases, it would mean that\r\n\r\none-quarter of the whole economy would be gone. There would be\r\n\r\n50,000 unemployed tomorrow. Then we would really hit rock\r\n\r\nbottom. I am not suggesting that one year after Malaysia we are\r\n\r\nbouncing with prosperity. We are realists. When confrontation\r\n\r\ncame, we worked out the figures. The total amount of trade we\r\n\r\ndid with Indonesia was 20 per cent of our total entrepot trade.\r\n\r\nI was curious to ask the Member for Bukit Merah where he got his\r\n\r\nfigures from, because immediately after confrontation, we\r\n\r\ndecided to publish no further figures in order that we should\r\n\r\nnot help the Indonesians to know how much of their rubber or\r\n\r\ncopra still comes back, either by barter traders in small craft\r\n\r\nor via Hongkong and Japan. Definitely for the last year, as can\r\n\r\nbe seen from the revenue, they did not knock us out for the full\r\n\r\n20 per cent of the entrepot trade. How much they did knock us by\r\n\r\nis their guess-work, because we have not published our figures.\r\n\r\nBut definitely not by 20 per cent. If today we were still a \r\n\r\nself-governing Singapore, without a common market, we would be facing\r\n\r\na much more acute situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be quite frank about this, Mr Speaker, Sir,I have\r\n\r\nsaid this once publicly - it has not been picked up in some of\r\n\r\nthe Press - that feelers have been sent out to me that the In\r\n\r\ndonesians would resume trade if we backed out of Malaysia. They\r\n\r\nhave sent all kinds of feelers, and this is one of them. I ask\r\n\r\nthe Members opposite, and I ask the people at large, to\r\n\r\ncalculate. Where does our long-term interest lie? Not just the\r\n\r\nday after tomorrow. Five years hence, ten years hence, 20 years!\r\n\r\nSuppose we are out of Malaysia the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nday after tomorrow; so the trading craft come back; so we are\r\n\r\nall friends again. Is that the end of the story! For the last\r\n\r\nseven years, the Indonesian Consul-General and his Consulate\r\n\r\nstaff here have spent a great deal of effort in setting up\r\n\r\nlittle nests of support, not for a flourishing independent\r\n\r\nSingapore, but for the kind of movement which they prematurely\r\n\r\ntriggered off last year, before their plans were fully matured.\r\n\r\nI sent back an answer to that feeler. I said, \"Do you object to\r\n\r\nBritish bases in Singapore?\" There was no answer. Tile line is\r\n\r\nthe official line. \"Why are we against Malaysia! Because it is a\r\n\r\nneocolonialist plot which threatens Indonesia.\" \"How is\r\n\r\nIndonesia threatened?\" \"Because the British bases are in Singapore.\" Now, these bases in Singapore will be objectionable\r\n\r\nwhether we are in Malaysia or whether we are out of Malaysia.\r\n\r\nSimple, is it not? So we move out of Malaysia. So the bases are\r\n\r\nstill as objectionable. Then what happens?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I congratulate the Barisan Sosialis on being\r\n\r\nconsistent, which the Member for Hong Lim never has been. They\r\n\r\nwant Malaysia scrapped. They are against it, lock, stock and\r\n\r\nbarrel. There will be paradise only when this whole\r\n\r\nneo-colonialist society is scrapped and they build afresh their\r\n\r\nCommunist millennium. Yes. Let us be frank about it. The Member\r\n\r\nfor Hong Lim knows that he is in trouble in that situation. He\r\n\r\nhas got no chance of running around with wild men. He can only\r\n\r\ntalk wild. But these people can act wildly. That is the big\r\n\r\ndifference. And he knows it makes more sense with merger. But he\r\n\r\nsays, \"Merger on equal terms.\" That is a new one, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir. \"No power,\" says he. \"All gone.\" I thought we went through\r\n\r\nall that very carefully. What he intended last time was what the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis asked for - complete merger, in toto. Today we\r\n\r\nwould not even be spending one whole day debating a budget of\r\n\r\n$350 million. Education in the Central Government, Health in the\r\n\r\nCentral Government, Fire Brigade, the whole works. We need only\r\n\r\nspend half an hour, Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Town Council of\r\n\r\nSingapore. It is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas simple as that. And we get a capitation grant for one year of\r\n\r\n$10 million from the Central Government to run this. So we may\r\n\r\neven have to reduce the allowance of Members of this Assembly.\r\n\r\nIt will be very sad indeed. The Member for Hong Lim knows the\r\n\r\nstark realities, that in this wider framework of Malaysia, there\r\n\r\nis no longer the possibility of what I would call the lunatic\r\n\r\nfringe in politics coming up on top. There is more balance.\r\n\r\nThere is more body generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me pick up some of the points made by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Hong Lim, because he has a flair for torturing any truth\r\n\r\ninto an untruth. He said, \"Everything fails under the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nexcept housing.\" This is because of his great genius in\r\n\r\ndiscovering the man for this job, who can even build 30,000\r\n\r\nflats a year. No trouble at all. He said that our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme at Jurong was all a matter of\r\n\r\nopening ceremonies. Mr Speaker, Sir, - this is also in answer\r\n\r\nto the Barisan Sosialis - nearly 150 pioneer certificates have\r\n\r\nbeen issued in the short time after the merger referendum and\r\n\r\nMalaysia Day. Just over one year! The hulk of it was in that\r\n\r\narea, where people would calculate on the basis of a market of\r\n\r\nover 10 million people. That is why the Member for Hong Lim is\r\n\r\nright. There have been no new pioneer certificates because\r\n\r\neverybody took them out straightaway. But there are still 45 now\r\n\r\nbeing processed. They are putting up their details to see\r\n\r\nwhether they qualify for pioneer treatment. In production today\r\n\r\nare 43 factories holding pioneer certificates with a total\r\n\r\nemployment capacity of 6,687. Under construction with pioneer\r\n\r\ncertificates already granted are 54 factories. Staff complement\r\n\r\nin full production will be 9,331. Non-pioneers now in the \r\n\r\npipe-line process, 11. Total employment capacity at total production.\r\n\r\n4,000. The 45 pioneers now being processed - I have mentioned\r\n\r\nthat - have another capacity of 7,000. So there is a total\r\n\r\nemployability capacity of 27,000. All this would not have\r\n\r\nhappened, Mr Speaker, Sir, without Malaysia. Let us be quite\r\n\r\nfrank about it. We did not go in because we owed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanybody anything. We went in because we wanted something for\r\n\r\nourselves. The world did not owe us a living. We did not owe\r\n\r\nMalaya a living. Neither did they owe us a living. But they\r\n\r\neither kill themselves trying to crush Singapore, or we kill\r\n\r\nourselves trying to undermine them, or we try and make a go of\r\n\r\nit together with Sabah and Sarawak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me sum up the long-term position in this way. We may\r\n\r\nhave to go through a fairly difficult period before we emerge\r\n\r\nfrom the doldrums. It is something like the early 1959, 1960,\r\n\r\n1961 periods. The effects of the common market cannot be felt\r\n\r\nfor at least four to five years. If we do not succeed; if, in\r\n\r\nfact, the arrangements within Malaysia are not worked out in a\r\n\r\nfair and equitable way, as was suggested by the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim, then we shall have to face a new situation. Let us be the\r\n\r\nfirst to acknowledge to the Barisan Sosialis that the day\r\n\r\nSingapore turns sour within Malaysia, that day they have won;\r\n\r\nbecause from that day onwards, if Singapore really goes out, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker. Sir, and it really says, \"Out with Malaysia,\" and there\r\n\r\nis a popular demonstration for that, then for the first time the\r\n\r\nIndonesians have a hook on Malaysia. Then for the first time, if\r\n\r\nthey are really helping to liberate the people, they can sell\r\n\r\nit. And that is the beginning of the end for Malaysia and for\r\n\r\nthe lot of us. We are hoping that logic, reason and common sense\r\n\r\nwill prevail. That nobody can afford to allow this to fail for\r\n\r\ntheir own self-interest. That this thing must be worked out in\r\n\r\nan equitable and just way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one good point made in the whole of this afternoon's\r\n\r\ndebate was the one that, in fact, by giving 40 per cent of our\r\n\r\nnational taxes, we are giving more than just paying for the Federal Departments in Singapore. That is correct. We calculated\r\n\r\nthat the right amount - the quantum was 27 per cent\r\n\r\nplus our share of External Affairs (Parliament,\r\n\r\nnegligible), might make it up to 30 per cent. We went in on the\r\n\r\nbasis of good faith. And there is a proviso - it is part of the\r\n\r\nConstitution - that every two years it will be reviewed,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand if no agreement is reached between the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nand the Central Government, the World Bank will send an\r\n\r\narbitrator. We have deliberately not brought this into the\r\n\r\nforeground of our Budget debate because we have no desire to\r\n\r\nhave more bones of contention between the Central Government and\r\n\r\nSingapore. Let us try to make this thing work. I am quite sure\r\n\r\nthat if there comes a time when we cannot agree, we will have to\r\n\r\ngo to arbitration with the World Bank. But that one valid point\r\n\r\nwas completely obliterated by a heap of malice and untruths. I\r\n\r\nneed only take one simple example. It is fatuous and yet it is\r\n\r\nsurprising how - if one allows these lies to be repeated\r\n\r\nconstantly - people may actually believe it. \"The iron and steel\r\n\r\nmill in Jurong was a flop,\" said the Member for Hong Lim. It is\r\n\r\nonly a scrap mill and we had to stop scrap iron from being\r\n\r\nexported. So people lost jobs. Then we banned the import of\r\n\r\nsteel bars in order that they can sell. But first, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, any businessman who has been following the stock market\r\n\r\nwill know that the production of this steel mill, which was one\r\n\r\nof the first projects in Jurong to get started, was unable to\r\n\r\nsatisfy demand, and it makes hefty profits. In order to satisfy\r\n\r\nits customers, it enlisted the support of the Government to give\r\n\r\nit the right to buy scrap iron at market prices, whatever our\r\n\r\ndealers could get on export, plus 10 per cent, in order that it\r\n\r\nshall have this raw material. They have now started construction\r\n\r\non the second furnace. But if one were to listen to the Member\r\n\r\nfor Hong Lim, the whole world is crashing. It is all wrong. His\r\n\r\npolitics consist of the big give and the big lie. Said he, we\r\n\r\nhave given away $70 million to the Federation. It is nothing\r\n\r\nlike that, Mr Speaker, Sir. We can work out the figures very\r\n\r\ncarefully. I am not saying the sum is negligible. In fact, it\r\n\r\nwill be quite an important factor in our discussions with the\r\n\r\nCentre, beginning from the first half of next year as the review\r\n\r\ncomes in. But he would just shower largesse all round. Do away\r\n\r\nwith licence fees, up the personal assistance for unemployment\r\n\r\nfrom $10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion to $20 million, build more hospitals, build more\r\n\r\npolytechnics, do all the wonderful things in life, do away with\r\n\r\nradio licences, taxi licences and the whole world. That is how\r\n\r\nhe runs politics. That is how we had to do a rescue operation\r\n\r\nvery quickly before there was a run on the bank. But I suggest\r\n\r\nto the House and the country that we are somewhere between\r\n\r\nUtopia and Hell. The Utopia I have already outlined, where the\r\n\r\nworld owes us a living, Mr Speaker, Sir. The British keep their\r\n\r\nbases here and tail it off gently over 30, 40, 50 years, to keep\r\n\r\nour economy boosted up, common market, trade with Indonesia,\r\n\r\ntrade with Malaya, trade with the whole world, all bouncing.\r\n\r\nReal perdition - failure of the common market, break-up of\r\n\r\nMalaysia, confrontation, double confrontation also with Malaya,\r\n\r\nto mutual harm, and the final abolition of British bases as part\r\n\r\nof this general collapse of the region. These are things which,\r\n\r\nas of this given moment, are fanciful. But if we allow such men\r\n\r\na free run and they are really allowed to do what they want to\r\n\r\ndo, that is where we will all end up - down at the bottom of the\r\n\r\ncesspit. All that has happened at this moment is that we have\r\n\r\nlost part of tile 20 per cent entrepot trade, part of 8.7 per\r\n\r\ncent of our national income, and of the given rate of growth\r\n\r\nthat we were having before Malaysia, over 4 per cent per annum.\r\n\r\nIn two years we make it up; and we may yet make it up. It may\r\n\r\nyet be the privilege of the Minister for Finance to announce to\r\n\r\nthe House in next year's Budget that we have got back to the\r\n\r\n1963 position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest to the country at large that our first job now is\r\n\r\nto make the best of this given situation. We keep what we get\r\n\r\nand consolidate on it and build up. If there is more reckless\r\n\r\ntalk, if investors really believe that the Barisan can succeed\r\n\r\nin making Singapore go sour on Malaysia, then that is the end.\r\n\r\nWhat is the point of the common market?

Let me tell the Member for Tampines to\r\n\r\ncalculate, to revaluate his chances of survival. Without the\r\n\r\nBritish bases here, without any other major power able to send\r\n\r\ntheir navy into the region to help him, and with the Indonesians\r\n\r\nwith a pipeline on large pockets of our own population, having a\r\n\r\nriot every other week, which would be construed to the whole\r\n\r\nworld as the desire of the oppressed people, the indigenous\r\n\r\npeoples of the region seeking freedom, bringing upon us a\r\n\r\nliberation army from our neighbours - that is where he will end\r\n\r\nup.

He says that the things that we have\r\n\r\ntalked about are irrelevant to the issue, for saying that\r\n\r\nMalaysia has been useless. He points out that even if Malaysia\r\n\r\nwere not established, Indonesia would continue with\r\n\r\nconfrontation. They have thought of another explanation.

But how do they go about it!\r\n\r\nThey say, get rid of such an economy. But, in fact, they have\r\n\r\nentered into the economic trap of the capitalist countries.

If Hong Kong is a\r\n\r\nrelevant example, then Singapore is also a colonial economy. How\r\n\r\ncan you compare Singapore with Hong Kong?

I would like\r\n\r\nto ask him whether the Members on the P.A.P. side have studied\r\n\r\nthe actual industrialisation process of Hong Kong? It has\r\n\r\nsuffered from the exploitation of foreign capitalists. The\r\n\r\nBritish Labour Government, once they have assumed power, have\r\n\r\nimmediately put up a 15 per cent surcharge and the Hong Kong\r\n\r\nindustrialists have suffered most. If Singapore were to follow\r\n\r\nHong Kong's example, then our industrialisation policy would not\r\n\r\nachieve its purpose and would fail.

Last year, I gave details of\r\n\r\nthe expected decline of trade resulting from confrontation and\r\n\r\nof our total trade and national income from Indonesia. There has\r\n\r\nbeen no attempt by us to bluff tile public, because in an open\r\n\r\nsociety such as ours, truth will emerge. And it is because we\r\n\r\nhave taken the precaution, well before confrontation took place,\r\n\r\nof trying to forecast its effects that we were able to mount the\r\n\r\ncountermeasures which had reduced the severity of confrontation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, three Members of the Barisan Sosialis made the point\r\n\r\nthat our industrialisation programme is not in the interests of\r\n\r\nthe country, because it enables foreign monopolistic capital to\r\n\r\nintensify the exploitation of local workers. This is a very\r\n\r\nfamiliar phrase. Mr Speaker, Sir, if you read Marx and Lenin on\r\n\r\n\"Imperialism, the Last Phase of Capitalism\", you will find all\r\n\r\nthese phrases. So the policy of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government is to intensify the exploitation of our\r\n\r\nworkers by the introduction and encouragement of foreign\r\n\r\nmonopolists and capitalists!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the workers are concerned, the fact that there\r\n\r\nare now 4,600 workers in Jurong - both in factories and in\r\n\r\nconstruction work  - means nothing to the Barisan Sosialis. The\r\n\r\nfact that these 4,600 workers might otherwise be unemployed is\r\n\r\nmeaningless to them. The fact that these factories are run by\r\n\r\nprivate enterprises means, by definition, that workers have been\r\n\r\nexploited! Now, it is in fact a Marxist dogma that, by\r\n\r\ndefinition, the mere fact that an employer uses workmen means\r\n\r\nthat the workers are being exploited, regardless of whether they\r\n\r\nare being paid a fair wage, the market wage, or not. I do not\r\n\r\nthink you will find this sort of dogma popular, except in\r\n\r\nRussia. But what is more to the point is that the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis - not Mr Ong Eng Guan, who knows the facts - say that it is -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

As an accountant, he has been studying the\r\n\r\nprospectuses of new companies and so on, and he knows that the\r\n\r\nmajority of capital ownership in the pioneer industries is in\r\n\r\nlocal hands and that, in fact, overseas capital forms a minority\r\n\r\nsection of capital ownership in our new industries. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe allegation by the Barisan Sosialis that we are allowing\r\n\r\nforeign capitalists to exploit our workers or to make large\r\n\r\nprofits which they remit out of the country is completely base\r\n\r\nless. It is no use making and repeating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch slogans, that foreign monopolistic capital is being allowed\r\n\r\nto mount a stranglehold on our economy.

In terms of total capital\r\n\r\ninvestment, both loans and working capital, the proportion may\r\n\r\nbe something like 60 to 40. But the Member for Hong Lim has\r\n\r\nasked for a detailed list - which will take some time to prepare\r\n\r\n- of each pioneer industry, where they are located, who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nowns them, how much is foreign capital, how much is local\r\n\r\ncapital, what they are producing, how many people are employed.\r\n\r\nwhere they are sited - a whole lot of information; and he is\r\n\r\ngoing to get quite a thick volume. I will not on that occasion\r\n\r\nread out the whole list, but these are facts open to\r\n\r\nexamination. We are not in the habit, like the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim, of telling fibs. We are a responsible Government, and it is\r\n\r\nnot our policy to fib.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis Member for Bukit Panjang says there is\r\n\r\nan easy way out of the economic problem, if only we will find a\r\n\r\npeaceful solution with Indonesia. Come to terms with them, and\r\n\r\nwe will do trade and we will all be prosperous and happy again;\r\n\r\nand he thinks that is a better way, a better alternative to the\r\n\r\nwarlike approach. First of all, Mr Speaker, let us get this\r\n\r\nclear. Who is waging war on whom? Are Malaysia and Singapore\r\n\r\nwaging war on Indonesia? Are we sending our soldiers, our\r\n\r\ntroops, across the Straits of Malacca to massacre the\r\n\r\nIndonesians, or is it the other way round? Who is waging war?\r\n\r\nWe are being attacked. Bombs have been exploded in Singapore.\r\n\r\nTroops have been sent across to Johore, Malacca. Indonesian\r\n\r\ntroops are crossing the borders of Sabah and Sarawak. Why does\r\n\r\nnot the Member for Bukit Panjang condemn the Indonesians for\r\n\r\ntheir aggression?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

[Laughter]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was having discussions with Indonesian Foreign\r\n\r\nOffice officials twice in Bangkok, and once in Tokyo, even they\r\n\r\ndid not have the effrontery to suggest that Malaysia is taking a\r\n\r\nwarlike attitude towards Indonesia, that we are waging war\r\n\r\nagainst them. In the United Nations in New York they say: \"Yes,\r\n\r\nof course, we are sending our paratroopers into Malaysia, and it\r\n\r\nis right to do so.\" Even the Indonesians do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndare to go as far as the Member for -Bukit Panjang in\r\n\r\nsuggesting that it is we who want to wage war against the\r\n\r\nIndonesians, and not the Indonesians who are actually waging war\r\n\r\nagainst us. So he says: \"Let us have a peaceful solution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already mentioned a few days ago - last week, in\r\n\r\nfact - that it is easy to come to terms with Indonesia, and that\r\n\r\nis to surrender. Quite easy. It goes on this basis - to disarm,\r\n\r\nno troops, they will do trade with you, the Consul-General will\r\n\r\ncome here. Then when you are absolutely defenceless, the\r\n\r\nIndonesian Army crosses the Straits of Malacca, occupy the\r\n\r\nplace, then what happens? Is that the sort of thing he wants?\r\n\r\nDoes he welcome the occupation of Singapore by the Indonesian\r\n\r\nArmy? Or does he think that if we are completely defenceless,\r\n\r\nthe Indonesian Army will not come across?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, two and a half years ago, we invited no\r\n\r\nless than General Nasution to dinner at Sri Temasek and he was\r\n\r\nquite taken in by the appointments, the rather elegant decor of\r\n\r\nSri Temasek, the large spacious grounds he viewed around the\r\n\r\nIstana. And he asked us: \"How many troops have you got?\"\r\n\r\n[Laughter] Of course, at that time we had only one \r\n\r\nbattalion - 750 men. I thought there was quite a look in his eye -\r\n\r\nof a man making a very quick calculation. The result, of\r\n\r\ncourse, was that\r\n\r\nwe decided to have another battalion.[Laughter]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim has got the capacity for making\r\n\r\nreckless statements, which he knows are completely untrue. The\r\n\r\nPrime Minister has nailed a few untruths. I propose to deal with\r\n\r\na few more in order that his reputation as a reckless purveyor\r\n\r\nof falsehoods will never be forgotten. A few minor points.\r\n\r\nFirst, he says in the last year or so bank deposits have gone\r\n\r\ndown. The reverse has happened. Bank deposits have gone up. He\r\n\r\nsays that private housing construction has gone down. The\r\n\r\nreverse is true. Private housing construction has gone up. He\r\n\r\nsays we spent hundreds of millions of dollars on Jurong - it was\r\n\r\na flop. We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave not spent hundreds of millions of dollars on Jurong. We\r\n\r\nspent $54 million on Jurong. Then he says that after six years\r\n\r\nof effort only 20 factories are in production in Jurong. The\r\n\r\nfact is that the first factory in Jurong went into production on\r\n\r\n1st January this year. And the others have gone into production\r\n\r\nin the 9 or 10 months intervening. Then he says that, as a\r\n\r\nresult of our revision of export of scrap, hundreds of people\r\n\r\nhave been unemployed. Nobody has been unemployed. The scrap busi\r\n\r\nness has increased in prosperity for two reasons. One, the steel\r\n\r\nmill, which he says is a bankrupt outfit, is buying more scrap\r\n\r\nthan the dealers can supply. Two, they are paying a higher price\r\n\r\nthan they could have got by exporting it to Japan. Then he says\r\n\r\nthere is a rolling-mill in Bukit Timah which, if expanded at\r\n\r\nvery small cost, would have achieved the capacity of the\r\n\r\nNational Iron and Steel Mill in Jurong. The Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nhas neither been to the Bukit Timah Steel Mill nor the Jurong\r\n\r\nsite. If he had, he would not have made this completely idiotic\r\n\r\nassertion. These are two different categories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And loans to Sabah and Sarawak!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, loans to Sabah and Sarawak. One is a\r\n\r\nhand-operated re-rolling mill where you cut strips from \r\n\r\nship-breaking plates, and do it the cumbersome way. The other one is\r\n\r\na fully automatic rolling mill with a 20-ton capacity electric\r\n\r\nfurnace; and another fully automatic re-rolling mill. Total \r\n\r\nre-rolling and rolling capacity in the Jurong Steel Mill is\r\n\r\nsomething in the region of 90,000 to 100,000 tons. The Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah mill cannot handle more than 10 per cent - rather less\r\n\r\nthan 10 per cent of that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, loans to Sabah. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Jurong\r\n\r\nsaid, paying all these monies, how many workers have been sent\r\n\r\nthere? $30 million loan. The answer is quite simple. That pay\r\n\r\nment has not been made because the terms of workers going to\r\n\r\nSabah have not been settled. So there will be a quid pro quo.\r\n\r\nSurely, Mr Speaker, Sir, when a wealthy nation like the United\r\n\r\nStates\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof America, or, if the Barisan do not like America, then a\r\n\r\npowerful industrial power like the Soviet Union, lends money,\r\n\r\nthey get something for it; either politically, in the case of\r\n\r\nthe Soviet Union, or in business, in the case of the Americans.\r\n\r\nIf you get my loans, then you do not buy other people's goods.\r\n\r\nAnd these are not interest-free loans. These are loans where you\r\n\r\npay interest. So when we extend interest-free loans to Sabah and\r\n\r\nSarawak, it is only a fair condition that they must help us to\r\n\r\nresolve our unemployment problem. And now I am happy to say\r\n\r\nthat discussions are being held between officials of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government, the Central Government, and the Govern\r\n\r\nments of Sabah and Sarawak to work out the details of this\r\n\r\narrangement. I hope that before long, satisfactory solutions\r\n\r\nacceptable to all parties will be reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim says, in making his calculation of\r\n\r\nhow much by way of 40 per cent contribution from national taxes,\r\n\r\nthat the interest-free loan costs us $2 million. He has made a\r\n\r\nmistake - a simple error of calculation. You will remember that\r\n\r\nhe said that the imputed interest on a $30 million interest-free\r\n\r\nloan is $2 million, which means that he will have to charge a\r\n\r\nrate of interest of something like 6\u00bd per cent on $30 million,\r\n\r\nwhich will give you $2 million; whereas the market rate of\r\n\r\ninterest for long-term Government loans is of the order of 5\u00bd\r\n\r\nper cent. I just make this point in passing. Anyway, from his\r\n\r\ncalculations, he stated that the Federation of Malaya is making\r\n\r\na profit of $65 million. Well, this contribution is to meet two\r\n\r\nelenients in the expenditure of the Central Government. One, non-\r\n\r\ndefence expenditure, such as the Foreign Office, the Parliament;\r\n\r\nthat sort of thing. It does not cost much. And the other one is\r\n\r\ndefence expenditure. As the Prime Minister has said, when we\r\n\r\nagreed to 40 per cent of national taxes, it was our view that\r\n\r\nthat figure was too high. From our computations then, we thought\r\n\r\nthat a lower percentage would be a fair discharge of Singapore's\r\n\r\nresponsibilities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntowards certain expenditures which every State of Malaysia must\r\n\r\nbear. The Federal Government's representatives thought that it\r\n\r\nshould be 60 per cent, and then the figure of 40 per cent was\r\n\r\narrived at as a compromise between the two starting positions.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, the figure may be too high, as we think it is,\r\n\r\nor it may be too low, as Kuala Lumpur think it is. But we can\r\n\r\nonly decide after the actual expenditure on Malaysian defence is\r\n\r\nknown, and it will be known after the end of this year. Then it\r\n\r\nwould be far more easy for us to have some idea of what would be\r\n\r\na fair contribution, or it would certainly be easier for an\r\n\r\narbitrator to arrive at a percentage after hearing both sides of\r\n\r\nthe case. The trouble about the premerger financial negotiations\r\n\r\nwas this. The Federal Government were working on a long-term\r\n\r\nprojection of an increase in defence expenditure. Expenditure\r\n\r\nhad not been incurred and there was some doubt as to the actual\r\n\r\namount that would be incurred; but after the end of this year,\r\n\r\nthere will be no doubt as regards the quantum. And a fair\r\n\r\ndivision of the proportion of our contribution can then be\r\n\r\narrived at. Because of this, it is certainly untrue and com\r\n\r\npletely malicious for the Member for Hong Lim to suggest that\r\n\r\nthe amount contributed must go up from $65 million in 1965 to\r\n\r\n$75 million in 1966, to $85 million in 1967. On this matter, I\r\n\r\nsuggest, with respect, that the Member for Hong Lim has been\r\n\r\ntalking through his hat in the same way as he has suggested that\r\n\r\nthe present business and economic conditions are hardly better\r\n\r\nthan those during the Japanese occupation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have replied to most of the\r\n\r\nimportant points raised by Members of the Opposition, except, I\r\n\r\nthink, for various curious points made by the Member for Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang. He deplores what he calls our abuse of tile\r\n\r\nIndonesians, their great friend, Soekarno, the great leader of\r\n\r\nIndonesian confrontation. He says it is wrong for us to say that\r\n\r\nIndonesians are eating rats and corn. It is not we, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nor Malaysians, who say that they are eating rats and corn. It is\r\n\r\nPresident Soekarno who urges every Indonesians to eat corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd it is Aidit, the Secretary-General of the Indonesian\r\n\r\nCommunist Party, who said that every patriotic Indonesian should\r\n\r\neat rats. And President Soekarno went so far as to say - and\r\n\r\nthis is on record, Mr Speaker, Sir - \"If I were to tell the\r\n\r\nIndonesian people to eat stones, they would eat stones.\" Sir,\r\n\r\nthis is not our propaganda. The Member for Bukit Panjang likens\r\n\r\nthese statements of ours to what Mr Lim Yew Hock said about the\r\n\r\nChinese people. It is completely different. We are just quoting\r\n\r\nwhat the Indonesian leaders asked their own people to do.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if confrontation lasts long enough, the Indonesian\r\n\r\npeople may yet have to follow President Soekarno's injunction to\r\n\r\nthem to eat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstones.
