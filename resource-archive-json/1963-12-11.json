The ground  for\r\n\r\ncancellation was that these unions were being  used\r\n\r\nfor  purposes inconsistent with their  objects  and\r\n\r\nrules  and had taken part in Communist united front\r\n\r\nactivity prejudicial to the good order and security\r\n\r\nof the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState. Before cancellation, these seven unions were\r\n\r\ngiven  two months' notice on 28th August, 1963,  to\r\n\r\nshow  cause  why their registration should  not  be\r\n\r\ncancelled.  Shortly after serving notice,  official\r\n\r\ninformation was received by the Registrar of  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions  that leaders of three of the seven  unions,\r\n\r\nnamely, the Singapore General Employees' Union, the\r\n\r\nSingapore Business Houses Employees' Union and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Bus  Workers' Union, in  furtherance  of\r\n\r\ntheir  plan  to  stir up political  unrest  and  to\r\n\r\nfurther the Communist united front campaign against\r\n\r\nmerger and Malaysia, had met on the 1st and 3rd  of\r\n\r\nSeptember  and  decided to withdraw large  sums  of\r\n\r\nmoney  from  the bank accounts of the  unions  they\r\n\r\ncontrolled to implement their illegal plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members will recall that on the 3rd of\r\n\r\nSeptember,   His  Excellency  the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  proclaimed the dissolution of the  previous\r\n\r\nAssembly  and  everybody  was  aware  that  general\r\n\r\nelections  would  take  place  soon.  In  order  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  funds  of the unions,  which  rightly\r\n\r\nbelong  to  the  workers, from being  misused,  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar immediately advised the banks to withhold\r\n\r\nwithdrawal of any funds from the accounts of  these\r\n\r\nunions.  Despite this action by the Registrar,  two\r\n\r\nunions,  namely,  the Singapore General  Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion  and the Singapore Business Houses Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion,  however, managed to withdraw from the  Bank\r\n\r\nof  China  $30,000 from their accounts between  the\r\n\r\nperiod  of  5th and 12th of October, 1963.  In  one\r\n\r\ninstance,  the  Singapore General Employees'  Union\r\n\r\nwithdrew  a  sum of $13,500 on 12th October,  1963.\r\n\r\nWhen this information came to the knowledge of  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar,  he sent an urgent memorandum requesting\r\n\r\nthe acting President, the Secretary-General and the\r\n\r\nTreasurer  of the union to see him on 14th  October\r\n\r\nto explain why the withdrawals were made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 14th of October, the three union officials\r\n\r\naccompanied  by  their legal  adviser,  Mr  T.  T.\r\n\r\nRajah,  called  at  the  Registrar's  Office.  They\r\n\r\nadmitted they had withdrawn three sums of $4,500\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nfrom  the  union's bank account with  the  Bank  of\r\n\r\nChina  on  12th October, 1963. They explained  that\r\n\r\nthe money was handed over to Mr T. T. Rajah to pay\r\n\r\nMessrs.  S.  T.  Bani, Fong Swee  Suan  and  Sandra\r\n\r\nWoodhull,  the so-called champions of the  workers,\r\n\r\nas a form of ex-gratia reward for services rendered\r\n\r\nto  the unions in the past few years. According  to\r\n\r\nthem,  the payments were authorised by the  union's\r\n\r\nExecutive  Committee  at a  meeting  held  on  10th\r\n\r\nOctober.  An  official note was then sent  on  16th\r\n\r\nOctober  by  the  Registrar  to  the  three   union\r\n\r\nofficials and to Mr T. T. Rajah warning  them  not\r\n\r\nto  make  the  payments  as they  would  be  acting\r\n\r\ncontrary to the objects and rules of the union  and\r\n\r\nthat  such payments are illegal under the  law.  In\r\n\r\nhis reply to the Registrar, on 17th October, Mr T.\r\n\r\nT.  Rajah stated that as Messrs. Fong Swee Suan, S.\r\n\r\nT.  Bani and S. Woodhull had never asked for a cent\r\n\r\nfrom  the  union and as they were not consulted  on\r\n\r\nthe  payment  of  an  ex-gratia allowance,  he  had\r\n\r\nadvised the union to set aside the sum held by  him\r\n\r\nfor  disbursement for other purposes. In  the  same\r\n\r\nreply,  however, Mr T. T. Rajah did  mention  that\r\n\r\nMessrs.  Fong Swee Suan, S. T. Bani and S. Woodhull\r\n\r\nwere  given  an  allowance of $200  per  month  for\r\n\r\npocket  expenses.  They said they  fought  for  the\r\n\r\nworkers  and  in  the end we found that  they  were\r\n\r\ngiven $200 a month plus $4,500 bonus for making the\r\n\r\nlife  of the workers miserable and unhappy and  for\r\n\r\nmaking more than 1,000 workers unemployed. Say what\r\n\r\nyou  like  about  Devan  Nair  - workers'  thief  or\r\n\r\naristocrat  of the workers but - he has not  taken  a\r\n\r\nsingle cent from any union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 4th of November, the Registrar again wrote\r\n\r\nto  Mr  Rajah  directing him to  pay  the  sum  of\r\n\r\n$13,500 into the union's bank account. In his reply\r\n\r\non  the  5th of November, Mr T. T. Rajah  informed\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar that he had handed the full  sum  of\r\n\r\n$13,500 to the union between the period of 18th and\r\n\r\n22nd  of October. The Registrar then wrote  on  the\r\n\r\n8th of November directing the three union officials\r\n\r\nto  put  back  the sum of $13,500 into the  union's\r\n\r\nbank account. The three officials informed the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegistrar on the 13th of November, through  Mr  T.\r\n\r\nT. Rajah, that they had acted on his advice and had\r\n\r\ndistributed  the $13,500 to those  members  of  the\r\n\r\nunion who were unemployed. To satisfy himself  that\r\n\r\nthe  money  was properly and legally utilised,  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar wrote to the three union officials  again\r\n\r\non  the 27th of November asking them to call at his\r\n\r\noffice  on  29th  of  November  so  that  he  could\r\n\r\nascertain exactly how the money was used. The three\r\n\r\nunion  officials failed to turn up on the appointed\r\n\r\nday.  The Registrar again wrote to them on 30th  of\r\n\r\nNovember  fixing a further meeting on 3rd  December\r\n\r\nto  give them another opportunity to explain  their\r\n\r\naction.  The three union officials again failed  to\r\n\r\nturn  up  and  the  Registrar  had,  therefore,  no\r\n\r\nalternative but to report the matter to the  Police\r\n\r\non   the   4th   of  December,  1963.  The   police\r\n\r\nimmediately  commenced  their  investigations   and\r\n\r\ndiscovered  that  the  General  Secretary  of   the\r\n\r\nS.G.E.U. had absconded. Why? Is it because  he  has\r\n\r\ngot something to hide?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members will see from what I have\r\n\r\nrecounted  that  here  is a clear  example  of  how\r\n\r\nunions   under   the  control   of   a   group   of\r\n\r\nunscrupulous, anti-national, pro-Communist elements\r\n\r\ncan sabotage genuine attempts by the Government  to\r\n\r\nprotect trade union funds in the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers. From the various complaints received  from\r\n\r\nmembers   of  this  union,  Government  has   ample\r\n\r\nevidence which indicates that unions controlled  by\r\n\r\npro-Communist elements had utilised their funds  to\r\n\r\nsupport the Communist united front campaign against\r\n\r\nmerger and Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the concern over the misuse of union\r\n\r\nfunds  and the disappearance of the union  official\r\n\r\nconnected therewith, the workers and the public  in\r\n\r\ngeneral  would  naturally like to know  the  actual\r\n\r\nstate of the financial affairs in these unions. The\r\n\r\nGovernment therefore consider it essential  to  set\r\n\r\nup  a  Commission  of Inquiry to inquire  into  the\r\n\r\nmismanagement  of union funds by the  pro-Communist\r\n\r\nleaders  of  these three unions. It is proposed  to\r\n\r\nappoint  Mr Tann Wee Kian of the Legal Service  to\r\n\r\nbe  the  Commissioner with the following  terms  of\r\n\r\nreference:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To inquire into and examine the financial\r\n\r\ntransactions of the deregistered Singapore  General\r\n\r\nEmployees'  Union,  the Singapore  Business  Houses\r\n\r\nEmployees'  Union  and the Singapore  Bus  Workers'\r\n\r\nUnion  from  1st  of April, 1962, to  date  and  to\r\n\r\nreport thereon with particular reference to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Every payment which appears to be\r\n\r\nunauthorised  by  the  rules  of  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  or contrary to the provision  of  the\r\n\r\nTrade Unions Ordinance, Chapter 154;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The amount of any deficiency or loss which\r\n\r\nappears  to  have  been  incurred   by   the\r\n\r\nnegligence or misconduct of any person; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The amount of any sum which ought to have\r\n\r\nbeen,  but is not brought to account by  any\r\n\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further safeguard the interests of the workers\r\n\r\nfrom  being  exploited  by the  anti-national  pro-Communist elements in the trade unions, and in view\r\n\r\nof  the  urgency  of  the  matter,  the  Government\r\n\r\nproposes  to introduce a Bill to amend the existing\r\n\r\ntrade union legislation. This amending Bill will be\r\n\r\nintroduced  and  taken  through  all  stages  on  a\r\n\r\nCertificate  of  Urgency on the 18th  of  December,\r\n\r\n1963.  The  reason for bringing in the  Bill  on  a\r\n\r\nCertificate  of  Urgency is obvious.  The  Assembly\r\n\r\nwill  be adjourning shortly and unless the Bill  is\r\n\r\nbrought in and passed on this basis, there will  be\r\n\r\nno  effective  legislation to prevent  trade  union\r\n\r\nfunds   from   being   dissipated   illegally   and\r\n\r\ndishonestly.   However,   to   give   Members    an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to study and comment on  the  Bill,  I\r\n\r\npropose, with your permission, Mr Speaker, Sir, to\r\n\r\ncirculate it to Members today.

We\r\n\r\nnote  that this year's Budget statement, like those\r\n\r\nof  previous years, is yet another piece of  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npropaganda.  Because of Malaysia  and  Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation, there appears to be a more realistic\r\n\r\nnote  this  time. At least the P.A.P. admits  that\r\n\r\nconfrontation sets back Singapore's progress by two\r\n\r\nyears  and that trade severance will have important\r\n\r\nand  far-reaching  effects on Singapore's  economy.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the P.A.P. makes claims on  Singapore\r\n\r\nbeing  in  a strong financial position and predicts\r\n\r\nthat  the  future,  notwithstanding  confrontation,\r\n\r\nholds  great promise and opportunity for the people\r\n\r\nand that achievements in the next four years should\r\n\r\nexceed  those of the last four years. I  think  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  must be  saying  this  with  his\r\n\r\ntongue  in  his cheek. He knows the serious  crisis\r\n\r\nfacing Singapore. Yet he tries to minimise the far-\r\n\r\nreaching  effects  of confrontation  - I  quote  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister's  own  words  - by  injecting  an\r\n\r\nunjustifiable note of over-confidence in the Budget\r\n\r\nstatement. What are the P.A.P.'s reasons  for  this\r\n\r\napparent  confidence? Because, says  the  Minister,\r\n\r\nthe  gross domestic product for national income has\r\n\r\nincreased  by  26  per  cent  and  the  per  capita\r\n\r\nnational  income has increased by 15 per cent  from\r\n\r\n1959  to 1962. He further claims that \"most of  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  occurred in the years 1961 and  1962  since\r\n\r\nthe implementation of the State's Development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlan\".  Let  us  ask:  how  has  this  increase  in\r\n\r\nnational  income  helped to raise the  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving  of  the  poor? And how has this  helped  to\r\n\r\nsolve  the  pressing unemployment  problem  in  the\r\n\r\nState  of  Singapore?  The  P.A.P. boasts  of  its\r\n\r\nachievements  in  housing and in industrialisation,\r\n\r\nand  many people are given the impression  by  one-sided  P.A.P. propaganda that there is a phenomenal\r\n\r\neconomic  growth  and development in  the  country.\r\n\r\nWhat  are the facts? Going by the figures given  by\r\n\r\nthe Minister, we can immediately see that there  is\r\n\r\ngross   under-expenditure  in  land,   agricultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  transport  and  communications,   and\r\n\r\nsocial  development.  Indeed much  of  the  surplus\r\n\r\nfunds accumulated over the last few years have been\r\n\r\ndue  to gross under-expenditure, inefficiency,  and\r\n\r\nincompetence of the P.A.P. Government. And  however\r\n\r\nmuch the P.A.P. may like to crow over its so-called\r\n\r\nachievements, it will not be able to hide the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  certain essential services in Singapore  have\r\n\r\nbeen grossly neglected. I will come to them by  and\r\n\r\nby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first Budget under neo-colonialist\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  and today all in Singapore can  see  the\r\n\r\ngreat  inequalities and injustices that  have  been\r\n\r\ndone  to Singapore under the P.A.P.'s merger terms.\r\n\r\nOriginally  a  lump sum of $78 million  was  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the Federation for Federal  services  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Mr  Lee Kuan Yew, the Prime  Minister,\r\n\r\ntold  the  people that Singapore must have  control\r\n\r\nover finance. Now control is firmly in the hands of\r\n\r\nthe Central Government and, in addition, we pay  40\r\n\r\nper cent of our national revenue to the Federation.\r\n\r\nThis   40  per  cent  works  out  to  $117  million\r\n\r\naccording  to the 1964 Budget. We have to  pay  for\r\n\r\nFederal development projects in Singapore, and  the\r\n\r\nsum  amounts to $9.5 million. We also have  to  pay\r\n\r\nfor   the  running  of  the  departments  that  are\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by  the Central Government,  viz.,  the\r\n\r\ndepartments   of   Customs  and   Inland   Revenue,\r\n\r\nBroadcasting,  etc.  The  amount  involved  is  not\r\n\r\neasily worked out, but it is probably in the region\r\n\r\nof  $15  million.  If we add $117 million  to  $9.5\r\n\r\nmillion and $15 million, the total comes to  $141.5\r\n\r\nmillion. If we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfurther add to this total, the $30 million that  we\r\n\r\ngive, the so-called loan to the Federation for  the\r\n\r\nso-called  development of the  Borneo  territories,\r\n\r\nthen  we  find that we are giving to the Federation\r\n\r\n$171.5  million  next  year.  This  is  the   price\r\n\r\nSingapore  has to pay as a result of  the  P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nmerger  and Malaysia. Money which is today  vitally\r\n\r\nneeded  for  the  relief  of  the  sufferings   and\r\n\r\nhardships  that have been brought to the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore by Malaysia, is all given away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What causes the Indonesian confrontation? However\r\n\r\nthe  Minister may care to interpret why  Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation has come about, he will not  be  able\r\n\r\nto  deny the fact that without Malaysia there would\r\n\r\nnot  have  been  Indonesian  confrontation.  It  is\r\n\r\nclear,  therefore,  that it is  Malaysia  that  has\r\n\r\ncaused this confrontation. The Finance Minister has\r\n\r\ngiven  an  account of the far-reaching  effects  of\r\n\r\nconfrontation on Singapore. According  to  him,  we\r\n\r\nhave  already lost the earnings of our  import  and\r\n\r\nexport   trade  with  Indonesia  which,  in   1962,\r\n\r\namounted to a total of $209 million and which works\r\n\r\nout  to  about 8.7 per cent of our national  income\r\n\r\nfor that year. Some 8,200 workers are also directly\r\n\r\naffected.  But the Minister is under-assessing  the\r\n\r\ngravity  of  the situation. The situation  is  much\r\n\r\nmore   serious  than  that.  Malaya's  trade   with\r\n\r\nIndonesia  amounted to $1,325 million in  1962.  Of\r\n\r\nthis  Singapore's share was $1,100  million,  viz.,\r\n\r\nmore  than  80  per cent. This $1,100 million  also\r\n\r\nworks  out to about 16 to 20 per cent of the  total\r\n\r\ntrade   of   Singapore.  Mr  Speaker,   the   mere\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  from  circulation  of  a  few   million\r\n\r\ndollars following the pay-cuts imposed on the civil\r\n\r\nservants  by  the  P.A.P  in  1959  had   a   great\r\n\r\ndepressing effect on the economy of Singapore.  Now\r\n\r\nthe  loss of $209 million earnings - and this is  an\r\n\r\nunder-assessment of the loss - will  most  certainly\r\n\r\naffect  very severely the economy of Singapore.  We\r\n\r\ncan  say that practically every person in Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  be  affected  directly  or  indirectly.   For\r\n\r\ninstance, the textile business is 60 to 70 per cent\r\n\r\ndown, the general provisions business\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  30  to  50 per cent down, and even banks  that\r\n\r\nhave  nothing to do with Indonesian trade  complain\r\n\r\nof a 30 to 40 per cent drop in business. The import\r\n\r\nand export business is at a standstill and trade in\r\n\r\ngeneral  is fast slowing down. Those most  directly\r\n\r\naffected  as a result of Malaysia and confrontation\r\n\r\nare, of course, industries connected with shipping,\r\n\r\nrubber,  coconut oil, sago, coffee, rattan,  pepper\r\n\r\nand  timber. Not only is it a loss of business  and\r\n\r\ntrade for Singapore, but what is more important  is\r\n\r\nthat there is a greater loss of jobs and livelihood\r\n\r\nfor   thousands   and  thousands  of   workers   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The Minister mentioned  the  figure  of\r\n\r\n10,800. Any man in the street will be able to  tell\r\n\r\nthe  Minister that the number is easily many  times\r\n\r\nthat.  Moreover, there is no estimate of the actual\r\n\r\nnumber  of  those affected who are  in  partial  or\r\n\r\nirregular  employment  and  who  are  on   contract\r\n\r\nlabour. Waterfront workers, boat transport,  taxis,\r\n\r\nhawkers  and  small businessmen, all are  similarly\r\n\r\naffected.  Ships lie idle in the harbour  and  even\r\n\r\nnow our fishermen cannot go out to sea with safety.\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,   in  addition,  certain   essential\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs like sugar, coffee, fish have gone up in\r\n\r\nprice. This already means a small rise in the  cost\r\n\r\nof  living,  which in turn means extra  burden  and\r\n\r\nextra hardships for workers who are already finding\r\n\r\nit difficult to make both ends meet. Confrontation,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   is   having  a  terrible   effect   on\r\n\r\nSingapore. Even Singapore's trade with other  areas\r\n\r\nlike Hong Kong and Bangkok is indirectly affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are glad indeed that the Government has made\r\n\r\nprovision for economic defence to help the tens  of\r\n\r\nthousands  who have been hard hit by  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nconfrontation. The Government has suggested that  a\r\n\r\nworker  who is laid off as a result of the  closure\r\n\r\nof  his factory is to receive six months' income at\r\n\r\ntwo-thirds   his  normal  earnings.   This   is   a\r\n\r\ncommendable  move. But we must warn the  Government\r\n\r\nthat  the  amount provided for economic defence  is\r\n\r\ncompletely inadequate. Only $1 million per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonth  will  not  be  able  to  help  many  people.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  there are many loopholes in  the  scheme\r\n\r\nwhich  work  to  the disadvantage of  the  workers.\r\n\r\nCertain  employers  have already  shown  that  they\r\n\r\nmerely  intend to give lip service support  to  the\r\n\r\nscheme.   For   instance,  certain  categories   of\r\n\r\nworkers, like water transport workers and  the  so-called  \r\n\r\ntemporary workers, are not included in  the\r\n\r\nscheme.  And  certain employers and contractors  do\r\n\r\nnot  give  true  reports to  the  Government.  They\r\n\r\nreduce  the workers' normal earnings to the  lowest\r\n\r\npossible  average  for computation  of  relief.  We\r\n\r\nwould say that a period of six months for the grant\r\n\r\nof  relief  is  too short. What happens  after  six\r\n\r\nmonths? Or what happens when the employers say that\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  in  a  position  to  help  further?\r\n\r\nMoreover, the proposal that all reliefs paid during\r\n\r\nthe  six months by the employers will be taken into\r\n\r\naccount  in  respect of obligations under  the  law\r\n\r\nwhen  the  final  payment is made  to  workers  for\r\n\r\nclosure  of  business after six months  is  grossly\r\n\r\nunfair  to  the workers, it amounts  to  no  relief\r\n\r\nbeing given at all during the six-month period from\r\n\r\nthe Government and the employers. We would urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  study  the memoranda  submitted  by\r\n\r\nworkers and their unions carefully. Their hardships\r\n\r\nare  real.  Whether Government gives a  subsidy  or\r\n\r\nreduction  in  rent, light and  water  charges  for\r\n\r\nworkers  affected  as  a  result  of  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nconfrontation  must be given serious consideration.\r\n\r\nWe   further   urge  the  Government   in   matters\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  workers' welfare  to  consult  all\r\n\r\nworkers' unions irrespective of whether or not they\r\n\r\nsupport the P.A.P. and not only the National  Trade\r\n\r\nUnion  Congress. It is the duty and  responsibility\r\n\r\nof   the  Government  to  help  all  workers.   The\r\n\r\ndirection of employment can be of help if there  is\r\n\r\nmuch  alternative  employment to  go  to.  But  the\r\n\r\nmultiplier economic effect is such that  all  other\r\n\r\nspheres of employment will be bound to be affected.\r\n\r\nConfrontation affects mainly the local business. It\r\n\r\nis  correct,  therefore, that local businessmen  be\r\n\r\ngiven all assistance by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government. The giving of active encouragement\r\n\r\nand assistance to the local businessmen is what, in\r\n\r\nfact, the Government should have done long ago. The\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  programme  of  the  P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nbenefited   only   the  foreign   capitalists.   We\r\n\r\nunderstand that about 70 per cent of the capital so\r\n\r\nfar  invested  in the pioneer industries  has  come\r\n\r\nfrom  foreign  capital. Instead of wooing  British,\r\n\r\nJapanese,  Australian  and  American  capital,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. should  instead make strenuous  efforts  to\r\n\r\nhelp   local   capital.   But   the   prospect   of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  is not bright.  With  Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation, a huge market of 100 million is lost\r\n\r\nto  Singapore. Without the large Indonesian market,\r\n\r\nno  big  industry can succeed in Singapore. Already\r\n\r\nthe  new flour mill, so I hear, is only working  at\r\n\r\none-quarter capacity because of confrontation.  How\r\n\r\nis   industrialisation  to   succeed   under   such\r\n\r\ncircumstances? Moreover, Indonesia is opening  free\r\n\r\nports  and free zones in Sumatra to take  away  the\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade  of  Singapore.  She  is  now  also\r\n\r\ntrading direct with Western countries. The P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nthreat  to close our market to countries that  deal\r\n\r\ndirect  with Indonesia instead of through Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  only mean the deprivation of more workers  of\r\n\r\ntheir livelihood. It is like cutting one's nose  to\r\n\r\nspite one's face. [Laughter] Mr Speaker, Sir,  now\r\n\r\nwe   are  talking  about  the  hardships  and   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties   experienced   by   the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Yet the Ministers there  are  laughing.[Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): So all the\r\n\r\nproposals  put forward by the Government  are  only\r\n\r\npalliatives. Some can do more harm than  good.  The\r\n\r\nonly way to solve the present economic crisis is to\r\n\r\nget  to  the  root  of  the  problem,  namely,   to\r\n\r\nnegotiate    immediately   with   the    Indonesian\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  resolve  all existing  differences.\r\n\r\nCalling  Indonesia \"hungerland\", \"blunderland\"  and\r\n\r\n\"plunderland\"; shouting jingoism and the  expansion\r\n\r\nof the armed forces and rousing the people with so-\r\n\r\ncalled patriotic rallies and further increasing the\r\n\r\ntension   in   the   area   by   registration   and\r\n\r\nmobilisation -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  this will not resolve the basic problem facing\r\n\r\nthe  people of Malaya and Singapore and  Penang  in\r\n\r\nparticular   today.  The  only  way   is   friendly\r\n\r\nnegotiation  with  the Indonesian  Government,  and\r\n\r\nthat is why we moved the amendment to the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech two days ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1963 being the year in which feverish\r\n\r\npreparations  were made by the P.A.P. for  a  snap\r\n\r\ngeneral  election, it is not surprising that  there\r\n\r\nis  a steep rise in Government expenditure for  the\r\n\r\nyear. But in spite of the steep rise in expenditure\r\n\r\nof  $60 million in 1963 as against 1962 largely  on\r\n\r\nPolice   and  television,  all  for  the   use   of\r\n\r\nrepression and P.A.P. propaganda, there is still  a\r\n\r\nsurplus  of  $47  million plus $9  million  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation, amounting to $56 million.  If  we  take\r\n\r\naway the $44 million of revenue collected in excess\r\n\r\nof  estimates,  there is still an under-expenditure\r\n\r\nof  $12 million for the year 1963. If there had not\r\n\r\nbeen  special expenditure on the building of stand-pipes,  electric lights and roads  to  deceive  the\r\n\r\npeople  that  the P.A.P. was doing some  good  work\r\n\r\nduring  the Prime Minister's so-called constituency\r\n\r\nvisits,  which were in fact electioneering  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and  using State funds for party  purposes,\r\n\r\nthere would have been greater under-expenditure  in\r\n\r\n1963.  Year  after  year under-expenditure  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has  contributed  to  an  accumulation   of\r\n\r\nsizable  surpluses. We should now put this  surplus\r\n\r\nto good use in Singapore. The Minister has budgeted\r\n\r\nfor  a surplus for 1964. Of course, the Budget  was\r\n\r\nbased on the normal year of 1963. However, 1963  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  normal year. The loss of trade in the  last\r\n\r\nthree and a half months of the year may well offset\r\n\r\nthe  major part of the profits and earning  already\r\n\r\nmade  in the first eight and a half months  of  the\r\n\r\nyear. Therefore, will the estimated revenue of 1964\r\n\r\ncome  up  to  expectations? I am sure  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister knows that the estimated revenue  in  1963\r\n\r\nwill  fall  short of expectations. In view  of  the\r\n\r\nneed  for extra expenditure as a result of Malaysia\r\n\r\nand  confrontation, it is very unlikely that  there\r\n\r\nwill   be   any  surplus  again  in  1964,   unless\r\n\r\nGovernment underspends on development again. I have\r\n\r\nalready\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspoken of the large chunk of our revenue which will\r\n\r\nbe given away to the Federation in 1964 as a result\r\n\r\nof  the  Malaysia  agreement. The  sum  given  away\r\n\r\namounts to nearly $171.5 million. The extent of the\r\n\r\nfinancial sell-out of the P.A.P. can now be seen by\r\n\r\nall.  We  can  see also how much the  40  per  cent\r\n\r\nnational  revenue means to Singapore. According  to\r\n\r\nthe  1964  Federal  estimates  for  Singapore,  the\r\n\r\namount to be spent on Federal services in Singapore\r\n\r\nis estimated to be $78 million, but the 40 per cent\r\n\r\nnational  revenue which we give to  the  Federation\r\n\r\namounts  to  $117  million. The difference  between\r\n\r\npercentage  payment and lump sum payment  amounting\r\n\r\nto  $117  million minus $78 million equals  to  $39\r\n\r\nmillion  - the  extra which the Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\ngiven  away  to the Federation! And for  what  - the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of the armed forces for the  suppression\r\n\r\nof  the  people! This is what the perfidious P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas  done  with the money earned by the  sweat  and\r\n\r\ntoil  of our people. This means cutting a big slice\r\n\r\nof  funds  for expenditure in Singapore, especially\r\n\r\nfunds  for  the  use  of development  projects  and\r\n\r\nsocial services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. repeatedly boasts of its Four-Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan. We might as well find  out  what\r\n\r\nrates of performance the P.A.P. has really put  up.\r\n\r\nIn  the  matter  of housing, the Government  claims\r\n\r\nthat   it  has  broken  the  back  of  the  housing\r\n\r\nshortage. I do not wish to repeat what has  already\r\n\r\nbeen  said  on  the subject in the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's   speech.  The  so-called  119  per   cent\r\n\r\nperformance of the P.A.P. on housing is not 119 per\r\n\r\ncent  on  low-cost housing that is badly needed  by\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore. If the rentals on housing\r\n\r\nunits  that are built are rentals which the  people\r\n\r\ncannot  afford,  then they are of  no  use  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Take, for instance, the rehousing of  fire\r\n\r\nvictims.  It  is  true  that the  unfortunate  fire\r\n\r\nvictims  have  been  very  promptly  provided  with\r\n\r\nhousing  flats.  There are many  such  flats  lying\r\n\r\nvacant because they are unsuitable and unwanted  by\r\n\r\nmany  people though such people really need  flats.\r\n\r\nNow  these re-housed fire victims are wondering how\r\n\r\nthey  are to get the money to pay the high  rentals\r\n\r\ncharged. This is one of the many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nheadaches of the re-housed fire victims.  How  does\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  intend  to  remedy  this  state   of\r\n\r\naffairs?  The  only solution is in building  really\r\n\r\nlow-cost houses and not expensive flats. We ask the\r\n\r\nGovernment to help the poor immediately by reducing\r\n\r\nthe  high rentals now charged by the Housing  Board\r\n\r\nand to build only low-cost housing in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Four-Year Plan on health states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The need for maintaining a high standard of\r\n\r\nhealth services is not purely based on a humane and\r\n\r\ncivilized  recognition of the values of human  life\r\n\r\nnor  is  it  purely  a  desire to  alleviate  human\r\n\r\nsufferings.   It   is   also  based   on   economic\r\n\r\nconsiderations.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  is what the P.A.P. said. Where are the public\r\n\r\ndispensaries,   the   new   hospitals,   the    new\r\n\r\nspecialised  departments  and  extensions  to   the\r\n\r\nhospitals?    Why   is   the   Medical   Department\r\n\r\npermanently under-staffed? And why has  there  been\r\n\r\nthis neglect in the public health of Singapore? The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will not be able to deny that development in\r\n\r\nthis  field has fallen far behind schedule, to  say\r\n\r\nnothing of keeping pace with the population growth.\r\n\r\nThere  is  nothing for the P.A.P. to crow  over  in\r\n\r\nthis  sphere.  The cholera epidemic is  the  direct\r\n\r\nresult  of  P.A.P. incompetence and  inefficiency.\r\n\r\nPage  77, section 7.81, 7.82 and 7.83 of the  Four-Year Development Plan envisaged the construction of\r\n\r\nthe Seletar dam and two service reservoirs together\r\n\r\nwith the tapping of water from the Johore River and\r\n\r\nthe  Scudai  River. Very regrettably much  of  this\r\n\r\nfield is still in the planning stage. Meanwhile the\r\n\r\npeople   of   Singapore   have   to   suffer    the\r\n\r\ninconvenience of ten hours of water rationing every\r\n\r\nday,  which started from April this year. We  doubt\r\n\r\nif   the   Government  performance  rate  in   this\r\n\r\ndepartment  even  comes up  to  54.4  per  cent  as\r\n\r\nclaimed  by the Minister. We ask the Government  to\r\n\r\nstart crash programmes to get water from the Scudai\r\n\r\nand  Johore  Rivers  as quickly  as  possible.  The\r\n\r\npeople   of  Singapore  have  put  up  with   water\r\n\r\nrationing  long enough and their health is  already\r\n\r\ndangerously  affected. It is  high  time  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. put in more work and play less politics.  It\r\n\r\nis ridiculous that the people of Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould still be short of water supply when  we\r\n\r\nare  in  the midst of torrential rains and  floods.\r\n\r\nYet  this  is  another instance of poverty  in  the\r\n\r\nmidst of plenty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the Development Plan on flood\r\n\r\nalleviation. This is the time of monsoon  rains  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  floods have already caused  serious\r\n\r\ndisruption to road communications especially  along\r\n\r\nthe main arterial roads in Singapore. After all the\r\n\r\nyears  of P.A.P. rule, what has been done in  flood\r\n\r\nalleviation?   According  to  the   Minister,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has so far put up only  18.8  per  cent\r\n\r\nperformance.  Therefore,  the  various  schemes  to\r\n\r\nalleviate   floods  in  Bukit  Timah,   Queenstown,\r\n\r\nAlexandra, Orchard Road, Geylang and Toa Payoh seem\r\n\r\nto have been forgotten to all intents and purposes.\r\n\r\nIs  this not another instance of P.A.P. neglect and\r\n\r\nincompetence? The swamp reclamation scheme  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  far  behind schedule. Only nine  per  cent\r\n\r\nperformance  can be recorded. But what about  rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment?  According to Table III given  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  there  is  a record  of  97.5  per  cent\r\n\r\nperformance. However, that refers only to a sum  of\r\n\r\n$1.64  million. The actual amount that should  have\r\n\r\nbeen spent on rural development for the three years\r\n\r\n1961  to 1963 according to Table 7.3 in page 66  of\r\n\r\nthe   Four-Year  Development  Plan  should  be  $20\r\n\r\nmillion.  The P.A.P. has therefore put  up  only  a\r\n\r\nrate   of  seven  per  cent  performance  in  rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment. We urge the P.A.P. not to neglect the\r\n\r\npoor  people in the rural areas. Promises were made\r\n\r\nto  help raise the standard of living of the  rural\r\n\r\npeople,  but they have not been kept. We hope  more\r\n\r\neffort  will  be  made  in this  direction  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture, not just a few rural tracks and standpipes,\r\n\r\nbut complete electrification and extensions of pipe\r\n\r\nwater  supply to all the rural areas. In  addition,\r\n\r\ngenuine  efforts must be made to help rural workers\r\n\r\nand farmers to fight poverty and exploitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the matter of education, the Government is\r\n\r\nagain   far  behind  its  schedule  especially   in\r\n\r\nvocational and technical education. I do not intend\r\n\r\nto  say much on Nanyang University now, but  it  is\r\n\r\nclear to all that the Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis playing too much politics on the question of aid\r\n\r\nto  Nanyang  University. Singapore has  the  money.\r\n\r\nTherefore, let aid be immediately given to  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  so  that  it  may  freely  develop   in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  the wishes  of  the  people,  The\r\n\r\nGovernment has, in fact, made promises to implement\r\n\r\nfree secondary education in 1964. The Minister says\r\n\r\nthat  this  has now to be postponed. Is  it  really\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  confrontation?  There  have  been\r\n\r\nannual  surpluses over the last few  years  and  we\r\n\r\nhave now $400 million in the kitty. What is holding\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. back? Was it merely an  electioneering\r\n\r\nstunt to be forgotten after the elections have been\r\n\r\nwon? Or could it be that the so-called postponement\r\n\r\nis  again linked up with politics? Let the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  inform  the House when  the  P.A.P. will\r\n\r\nimplement   its  promise  to  give  free  secondary\r\n\r\neducation to the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have touched on but a few of the dismal\r\n\r\nfailures  and poor performances of the P.A.P.;  but\r\n\r\nas  usual the P.A.P. blames the Communists for  all\r\n\r\nits  failures.  Thus the failure to  implement  the\r\n\r\nscheme   for   flood  alleviation   and   for   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment   of  Toa  Payoh  is  blamed   on   the\r\n\r\nobstruction  put  up  by squatters  who  have  been\r\n\r\nspecially   engineered  and  encouraged   by   pro-Communist  elements. How ridiculous can the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nget? This is, of course, part of the P.A.P. tactics\r\n\r\nto pass the buck to other people whenever possible.\r\n\r\nIt  hopes  thus to create the impression  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is all efficiency, all correctness and  all\r\n\r\ncompetence.  But such name-calling and passing  the\r\n\r\nbuck  will  not  be  able to  deceive  the  people.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  P.A.P. attempts to absolve itself  from\r\n\r\nblame  and  to  pass  the buck  to  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment for all the sufferings and hardships  in\r\n\r\nSingapore as a result of Malaysia and confrontation\r\n\r\nwill  not succeed. The people know that the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas promoted Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. has made provision for a so-called\r\n\r\nYouth  Training Centre in the Budget for  1964.  We\r\n\r\ntell  the  P.A.P. this: stop using State  funds  to\r\n\r\ntrain  Party  cadres for the building of  a  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nempire. The funds of the people must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe put to use for the interests of the people as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.  State  funds must not  be  used  for  party\r\n\r\npurposes. Enough money is already spent on the  so-called  People's Association and the  Work  Brigade\r\n\r\nboth of which are but State arms of the P.A.P.  Let\r\n\r\nthe   money  budgeted  for  this  Youth  Leadership\r\n\r\nTraining  Centre be used instead on the  relief  of\r\n\r\nworkers who have been deprived of jobs as a  result\r\n\r\nof P.A.P.'s promotion of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. has always boasted of its\r\n\r\nindustrialisation   programme.  But   unfortunately\r\n\r\nuntil  today, there is still nothing much to  show.\r\n\r\nOnly  10  enterprises are in production  or  in  an\r\n\r\nadvanced stage of production, says the Minister. Is\r\n\r\nnot  this more or less the same as what the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister has been saying all these years?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what of the employment opportunities for our\r\n\r\nrapidly growing population? How many jobs have been\r\n\r\nprovided  so  far  by  all  the  P.A.P. industrial\r\n\r\nenterprises? The number of unemployed has not  been\r\n\r\ngiven  by the P.A.P. for quite some time.  What  is\r\n\r\nthe  actual unemployment figure in Singapore today?\r\n\r\nCan  the  P.A.P. deny that the unemployment problem\r\n\r\nis  becoming more acute with each passing  day?  In\r\n\r\n1959,  the total of unemployed was 46,000.  If  the\r\n\r\nunder-employed  be also included, the  total  would\r\n\r\nhave  been  much higher. Let us put  the  total  of\r\n\r\nunemployed   and  under-employed  at  approximately\r\n\r\n70,000  in  1959. 30,000 to 40,000  young  men  and\r\n\r\nwomen join the throng of job-seekers every year. In\r\n\r\nfour  years the total number of young men and women\r\n\r\njob-seekers  must number at least  120,000.  If  we\r\n\r\nshould  take only the figure given in the Four-Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan  it is still 52,000.  Using  only\r\n\r\nofficial figures the number of job-seekers will  be\r\n\r\n70,000 plus 52,000 equal to 122,000. And this  does\r\n\r\nnot   include  the  migratory  increase  of  a  few\r\n\r\nthousand  due to people moving into Singapore  from\r\n\r\nthe  Federation every year. How many jobs have been\r\n\r\nprovided  by  the 10 odd enterprises  the  Minister\r\n\r\ncrows  over? Has P.A.P. industrialisation scratched\r\n\r\nthe surface of the unemployment problem so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfar?  This  fact alone should show how  incompetent\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is. The industrialisation of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis only to allow foreign capitalists to exploit the\r\n\r\npioneer  industry  and  tax  holiday  laws  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  to extract bigger profits from the people.\r\n\r\nLocal capital has not been given its proper role in\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.'s  scheme  of  things.  Then  what   of\r\n\r\ninvestments  of  surplus  funds  overseas?  In  the\r\n\r\nprevious  years,  the  P.A.P. has  been  increasing\r\n\r\ninvestments  overseas. The amount of surplus  funds\r\n\r\ninvested  abroad amounted to $316 million in  1961.\r\n\r\nThe  1962  figures are not yet available.  Let  the\r\n\r\nMinister  tell us. But we are pretty sure that  the\r\n\r\namount invested abroad must have again been further\r\n\r\nincreased.  We  ask the Government,  get  back  the\r\n\r\nfunds from abroad. We can put our own money to good\r\n\r\nuse in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot pass by without mention of the increase\r\n\r\nin  petrol  duty  of 10 cents per gallon  that  has\r\n\r\nalready  been imposed on the people.  This  is  the\r\n\r\nbeginning of harmonisation of duties with  Malaysia\r\n\r\nwhich  will  ultimately cover duties on  all  items\r\n\r\nthat  are  lightly taxed or free of  tax  today  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This extra duty of 10 cents  on  petrol\r\n\r\nwill mean an increase of burden and hardship on the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore, especially now that that  they\r\n\r\nare  feeling more and more the effects of  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand confrontation. It may be argued that the petrol\r\n\r\nduty is easily borne by those most able to bear it.\r\n\r\nBut  Government must not forget that those who  run\r\n\r\nnon-diesel  taxis, lorries, fishing  boats,  motor-boats,  etc.,  are  also  affected.  Moreover,  the\r\n\r\namount  of  revenue obtainable by the tax  is  only\r\n\r\n$3.2  million out of which $1.3 million has  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  away  to  the Federation.  The  small  extra\r\n\r\nrevenue  will  not  make  much  difference  to  the\r\n\r\nestimates.  Is this extra tax absolutely  necessary\r\n\r\nat  the present time? Is there not a budget surplus\r\n\r\nalready?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, today Singapore faces  a  grave economic  crisis.  All  the rosy  pictures  of  the P.A.P. will not hide the fact that more  and  more people are facing a bleak future as a result  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia and the Indonesian confrontation.  The\r\n\r\npropaganda  lie of the P.A.P. that Malaysia  brings\r\n\r\nstability  and  peace, happiness and prosperity  is\r\n\r\ncompletely exposed. All can see now that instead of\r\n\r\nstability  and peace, there is strife, tension  and\r\n\r\nthreat of war. Instead of happiness and prosperity,\r\n\r\nthere is misery and sorrow. Extra burdens and extra\r\n\r\ntaxes, loss of business and loss of employment. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. may  have  high hopes of industrialisation,\r\n\r\nbut  until today P.A.P. industrialisation  has  not\r\n\r\nsucceeded   in  providing  jobs  for  the   people.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  it  is  imperative  that  we  pursue\r\n\r\nindustrialisation   energetically.   But   a    new\r\n\r\ndifficulty  has arisen - the loss of trade  and  the\r\n\r\nloss  of  a market of 100 million is bound to  have\r\n\r\nadverse effects on industrialisation in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cushion the terrible effects of Malaysia and\r\n\r\nconfrontation, we urge the Government  to  increase\r\n\r\nexpenditure on public work projects and  on  public\r\n\r\nassistance to the thousands and thousands who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  deprived of their livelihood through no fault\r\n\r\nof  their  own.  An expenditure of $1  million  per\r\n\r\nmonth on assistance is definitely insufficient. The\r\n\r\namount must be substantially increased. Aid must be\r\n\r\ngiven  to every person generally affected,  whether\r\n\r\ndirectly  or indirectly, and not merely to  certain\r\n\r\ncategories of workers. The solution to our  present\r\n\r\neconomic crisis lies not in the wooing of  U.S. or\r\n\r\nAustralian  or Italian capital or in the palliative\r\n\r\nmeasures  suggested by the Government. It  lies  in\r\n\r\npersuading the Federation Government to get rid  of\r\n\r\nall  foreign influence and interference,  stop  all\r\n\r\naction  that  tends to increase  tension  and  even\r\n\r\nprovocation,  stop  all  warlike  preparations   of\r\n\r\nregistration and mobilisation, go to the conference\r\n\r\ntable  and negotiate with the Indonesian Government\r\n\r\nand  resolve  all existing differences between  the\r\n\r\ntwo  countries amicably and to our mutual  benefit.\r\n\r\nOnly  thus  will  tension be dissolved  and  peace,\r\n\r\nhappiness  and prosperity guaranteed in  South-East\r\n\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Dr Fong Kim Heng) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.41 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, the estimates\r\n\r\nput  forward by the P.A.P. Government for the  year\r\n\r\n1964  clearly  show that we will continue  to  give\r\n\r\npriority  to  social services for the  welfare  and\r\n\r\ninterests  of the people of Singapore as  a  whole.\r\n\r\nThe   estimate  of  $204,301,070  which  has   been\r\n\r\nallocated  in the Budget is the biggest sum,  which\r\n\r\nis    two-thirds   of   the   whole   estimate   of\r\n\r\n$326,779,000.  This proves that the  Government  is\r\n\r\nconstantly giving prior attention to the  interests\r\n\r\nof the people and giving them many facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the estimates put up in this House have been put up after giving consideration to the effects of confrontation launched by Indonesia. I am confident that without confrontation the P.A.P. Government will definitely be able to allocate more sums of money for its\r\n\r\nsocial  services in order to meet the needs of  the\r\n\r\npeople. Confrontation has been launched because  of\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  on  the  part  of  our  neighbour\r\n\r\n- Indonesia  - as  a result of the stupidity  of  the\r\n\r\nanti-national  and the Communist  group,  like  the\r\n\r\nBarisan,  which have spread false propaganda.  They\r\n\r\nare  adament in claiming that the people  here  are\r\n\r\nagainst Malaysia, whereas in point of fact  we  are\r\n\r\nall aware that in the referendum, which was held in\r\n\r\na democratic manner, the people freely chose merger\r\n\r\nand  Malaysia. Therefore, all the accusations  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government was solely responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe  hardships  of the people and  the  workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   as   a  result  of  confrontation   are\r\n\r\nunfounded  and based on the stupidity and ignorance\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan Sosialis Members. The blame should\r\n\r\nbe  put squarely on the Barisan Sosialis. They  are\r\n\r\nguilty  because  the people are  suffering  as  the\r\n\r\nresult  of confrontation. They claim that they  are\r\n\r\nrepresenting  the  people. In fact,  they  are  the\r\n\r\nhirelings of the Communists and they have been used\r\n\r\nfor  subversive purposes to divide  and  split  the\r\n\r\npeople  so  that  we  will accept  a  new  kind  of\r\n\r\ncolonialism. Mr Deputy Speaker, although\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe   are   faced  with  the   effects   of\r\n\r\nconfrontation,    we   are   not    shirking    our\r\n\r\nresponsibility and duty. On the contrary,  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  strive to achieve our  objectives  to\r\n\r\nimplement  our  programmes for the benefit  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  It  is  our  desire to  make  Singapore  a\r\n\r\npeaceful  and prosperous country where  the  multi-racial population can live in peace and harmony. It\r\n\r\nis  also  our objective to establish a  more  equal\r\n\r\nsociety where everyone can live in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, during the four years of P.A.P. Government, the social services have been intensified to cover all aspects. There are 17 creches where children between five and six years of age are given free education. These children come from poor families who cannot afford to send\r\n\r\nthem to kindergarten classes for which they have to\r\n\r\npay  fees.  In  addition, there are  creches  where\r\n\r\nchildren  up to five years of age are looked  after\r\n\r\nwhen  their  parents go to work. Along  with  these\r\n\r\nservices we have plans for the adoption of children\r\n\r\nwho  are  orphans  or who are faced  with  domestic\r\n\r\ndifficulties. The decision is made to have  adopted\r\n\r\nmothers   and  expenses  will  be  borne   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  To  accommodate juvenile  delinquents,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  built  two  schools  and  two\r\n\r\nwelfare  homes. In addition, there is a  department\r\n\r\nto   look  after  their  welfare  when  they   have\r\n\r\ncompleted  their studies. The boys  from  5  to  19\r\n\r\nyears  of  age are given vocational education  like\r\n\r\nauto-mechanics,  carpentry, and others,  to  enable\r\n\r\nthem  to  obtain  jobs. With  the  passing  of  the\r\n\r\nWomen's  Charter, efforts to look after  the  women\r\n\r\nhave  been carried out. Now there are four  welfare\r\n\r\nhomes  for  girls including one home specially  for\r\n\r\nMuslim  women situated at Jalan Eunos. Just as  for\r\n\r\nthe boys, these girls are given similar training so\r\n\r\nthat  when they leave they can lead a new  life  in\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, our services are not only confined to youths and children but they also cover the aged. There are two homes for them. One is at Bushey Park for men and the other is at Woodstock for women. Every social welfare home is administered by the staff of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial Welfare. The inmates are given training, and\r\n\r\nalthough  they  are  old they can  do  useful  work\r\n\r\nduring  their spare time. In addition, their health\r\n\r\nis  well looked after. For their entertainment film\r\n\r\nshows  are given every week. They are permitted  to\r\n\r\nleave the home to visit their relatives. Television\r\n\r\nand  radio  sets are also provided, in addition  to\r\n\r\nthe  services  I have mentioned, the Department  of\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare  also  provides  general  services.\r\n\r\nThese   services  have  made  Singapore  the   most\r\n\r\nadvanced social State in South-East Asia. I believe\r\n\r\nthere  is no other country so realistic as to  give\r\n\r\naid  to the poor and the unemployed as what we  are\r\n\r\ndoing  in Singapore. Families of the poor  who  are\r\n\r\neligible for aid receive $90 per month. The sum  to\r\n\r\nbe  spent on relieving such families amounts to  an\r\n\r\naverage of $800,000 per month, or about $10 million\r\n\r\nper  year.  For those who are suffering from  T.B.,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a special allowance totalling  $180  for\r\n\r\neach  family.  Both these services over  the  years\r\n\r\nhave  confirmed the Government's policy to  achieve\r\n\r\nits  aim of a more equal society where the poor can\r\n\r\nlive in peace and harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past four years our efforts to\r\n\r\nconsolidate  and  expand the social  services  have\r\n\r\nbeen  implemented and in the next  five  years  the\r\n\r\ntask of the P.A.P. Government is to further improve\r\n\r\nthese social services. Now work on the construction\r\n\r\nof a further home for the aged is in progress. This\r\n\r\nhome  when  completed next year will have  complete\r\n\r\nequipment  to  accommodate 500 aged  males,  it  is\r\n\r\nestimated   that  in  the  next  five   years   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must have homes to accommodate  between\r\n\r\n5,000  and  8,000 aged, and plans to build  several\r\n\r\nmore   homes  for  these  people  are  still  under\r\n\r\nconsideration. For the children two further creches\r\n\r\nare being built in the Tanjong Pagar area and Anson\r\n\r\nRoad.  Plans are also being prepared to have a  new\r\n\r\nwelfare  school for boys who, for the  time  being,\r\n\r\nare  accommodated at Keppel Road Welfare Home. This\r\n\r\nschool  when  completed will have an administration\r\n\r\nroom,  dormitory,  classes, one  workshop  complete\r\n\r\nwith  equipment and quarters for the staff. Another\r\n\r\ntwo   hostels   for  boys,  each  of   which   will\r\n\r\naccommodate 50, will be built. In these hostels the\r\n\r\nboys will be trained\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin vocational education to prepare them for jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the social services for the poor,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government also provides services  for\r\n\r\nall.  When we were in office in 1959 Singapore  had\r\n\r\nonly 24 community centres. Over the past four years\r\n\r\nthe  People's Association has built altogether  160\r\n\r\ncommunity centres, including those which were built\r\n\r\nin   rural  areas.  These  community  centres,   in\r\n\r\naddition to being places where the people can  meet\r\n\r\nand  exchange  views and hold adult  classes,  also\r\n\r\nserve as places for inoculation of poultry and  for\r\n\r\npaying  licences. All these community  centres  are\r\n\r\nprovided  with  radio and television  sets,  sports\r\n\r\nequipment,   adult   classes,   film   shows,   and\r\n\r\nactivities  for  the children. The latest  facility\r\n\r\nprovided in these centres are television sets where\r\n\r\nelectricity is available. Mr Deputy Speaker, these\r\n\r\ncommunity   centres,  in  fact,   provide   various\r\n\r\nservices  for  the entertainment of the  people  in\r\n\r\naddition  to  their  acting  as  liaison  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.    The    People's   Association,    in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with  the Social  Welfare  Department,\r\n\r\nproposes  to  hold  kindergarten classes  in  these\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres for children  according  to  the\r\n\r\nproper methods, and not like those conducted by the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  for the purpose  of  inculcating\r\n\r\nCommunism   into  them.  These  community   centres\r\n\r\nprovide useful services to the people and will  not\r\n\r\nbe used for false propaganda as has been claimed by\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am happy to say that under the P.A.P. Government development and rapid progress has been achieved in the field of social services. I would like to make a few brief remarks in connection with the fire services in Singapore. We have a Fire Brigade Department headed by a Chief\r\n\r\nFire Officer. Our fire services are at par with the\r\n\r\nother fire services in South-East Asia. Our Central\r\n\r\nFire  Station is at Hill Street, with  branches  at\r\n\r\nAlexandra,  Bukit  Timah  and  Geylang.  With   the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of these services, it is necessary  that\r\n\r\nthe   fire  services  be  expanded  to  look  after\r\n\r\nproperty.  The  building of two more fire  stations\r\n\r\nwill  be planned at Toa Payoh and at the industrial\r\n\r\nsite  at Jurong. A difficult problem faces the fire\r\n\r\nservices in putting out fires\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  kampongs  where attap houses  are  built  close\r\n\r\ntogether. A clear example was the fire which  broke\r\n\r\nout  from Lorong 5 to Lorong 9 in Geylang recently.\r\n\r\nThe  fire  engines could not approach  these  areas\r\n\r\nwhere  there  are crowded attap houses.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nall efforts to extinguish the fire were blocked. As\r\n\r\na  temporary  measure to overcome this  difficulty,\r\n\r\nthe  Auxiliary  Fire Brigade has been  established,\r\n\r\nThere are now 70 voluntary fire units and they have\r\n\r\ndone excellent services in fighting fires. The Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade   also   looks  after  the  ambulance   for\r\n\r\naccidents.  There are 11 ambulances in  the  State.\r\n\r\nFor  this year, this service, which is looked after\r\n\r\nby  more than 30 personnel, has answered more  than\r\n\r\n18,000 calls. The services of the Fire Brigade will\r\n\r\nbe maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, just now a Member of the Barisan Sosialis claimed that the fire victims were not given proper treatment. He also claimed that the victims were neglected. I wish to say in this House that all fire victims have been offered Housing Board flats if they so desire. In order to\r\n\r\nenable them to pay rentals, each family is given up\r\n\r\nto  a  maximum of $35 per month or $7 per head  per\r\n\r\nmonth.  This  is  one  of the  aids  given  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  those  fire victims.  In  addition,\r\n\r\nthese  fire  victims are given aid in the  form  of\r\n\r\nclothing  and food whilst they are temporarily  put\r\n\r\nup  in relief centres before they accept the flats.\r\n\r\nMany of the fire victims are given low-cost flats,\r\n\r\nthe  rental of which is $20 per month. There is  no\r\n\r\ncountry in South-East Asia which has given  such  a\r\n\r\nfacility.  I  am happy to say that  when  the  fire\r\n\r\nbroke out in Lorongs 5 to 9, Geylang, we were  able\r\n\r\nto  give  the fire victims housing flats  within  a\r\n\r\nshort space of 24 hours. The spirit of co-operation\r\n\r\ncan  be  clearly  seen whenever there  is  a  fire.\r\n\r\nPeople  of  all races work together  and  give  all\r\n\r\nkinds  of help and make contributions. This  spirit\r\n\r\nof  gotong  royong will be maintained  so  that  in\r\n\r\nfuture  the  people will not just be spectators  on\r\n\r\nthe projects which are meant for their benefit.  On\r\n\r\nthe  contrary, they will work hand in hand with the\r\n\r\nGovernment. The Government looks after  the  people\r\n\r\nfrom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbirth  until death. I wish to say that  under  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  the progress  which  has  been\r\n\r\nachieved  in  the  field of  social  services  has\r\n\r\nincreased greatly. Our object, I reiterate, is for\r\n\r\nthe welfare and benefit of the people so that they\r\n\r\nwill  have more faith in our Government.  We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  pursue our efforts  to  achieve  our\r\n\r\nsocial revolution. With these aims, it is easy for\r\n\r\nus  to  eliminate and isolate the  Communists  who\r\n\r\nclaim  that they alone can look after the interest\r\n\r\nof the people. As a socialist, democratic and non-Communist  Government,  it  is  our  aim  to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore peaceful and prosperous and in which the\r\n\r\nmulti-racial   society  can   live   together   in\r\n\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance  has\r\n\r\nspent  a  great  deal  of  time  to  deliver   his\r\n\r\nfinancial  statement. I think everyone is  anxious\r\n\r\nto   know   what   repercussions  this   financial\r\n\r\nstatement has on the people of Singapore. I am now\r\n\r\nairing  some of the views of the people so  as  to\r\n\r\nenable  the  public  to know  the  real  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs. In the eyes of the great majority of  the\r\n\r\npeople, the state of affairs is somewhat different\r\n\r\nfrom that as described by the P.A.P. Anyone who  has\r\n\r\nmade  a careful study of this financial statement,\r\n\r\nif  he  is  not over-awed by the statistics,  will\r\n\r\nrealise  that  our  analysis of  the  question  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  the  economics  of  the  P.A.P.  is\r\n\r\ncorrect. Therefore, it will be seen that those who\r\n\r\naccuse us of lying are twisting the facts. On  the\r\n\r\nwhole, the Budget statement has enabled the people\r\n\r\nto  see  that  Malaysia has brought about  greater\r\n\r\ndifficulties and hardships on them. Inevitably the\r\n\r\nBudget  statement has received a certain  reaction\r\n\r\nfrom  the  people. The P.A.P. Government has  also\r\n\r\nrealised the evil consequences. All will  be  able\r\n\r\nto  know  that  the people are meeting  with  more\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  more  taxes  and  more   hardships.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  this  Budget  statement  provides  good\r\n\r\nmaterial  for educating the people to enable  them\r\n\r\nto  see through the P.A.P.'s Budget statement. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has made use of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudget  statement to fish money out of the pockets\r\n\r\nof  the  people  in  order  to  help  the  foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to go into this Budget statement and its significance in detail. According to the Minister for Finance, in the first few months of this year there has been an economic expansion in Singapore. This is only a superficial phenomenon. We will look behind it and\r\n\r\nsee  the  true  picture.  According  to  us,  this\r\n\r\nsuperficial phenomenon does not really prove  that\r\n\r\nthe  standard  of  living of the people  has  been\r\n\r\nraised.  This is because it only shows the  amount\r\n\r\nof  money  spent and the figures of trade - nothing\r\n\r\nelse.  It  is also because all the money spent  is\r\n\r\nderived  from the people themselves.  So  whatever\r\n\r\nmoney  the  Government  wants  will  have  to   be\r\n\r\nobtained  from  the people. This will  reduce  the\r\n\r\namount  of  money in the possession of the  people\r\n\r\nand  cause  them further hardship.  This  kind  of\r\n\r\neconomic control by the P.A.P. is adverse  to  all\r\n\r\nconcerned.  From  the  long-term  view,  this   is\r\n\r\ndetrimental to Singapore. But because  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis  anti the people and anti-worker in nature,  it\r\n\r\nis  engaged  in this kind of policy. The  national\r\n\r\nincome  has  only increased a little in  the  last\r\n\r\nthree  years,  in fact, by only 6  per  cent.  The\r\n\r\npopulation growth, however, is up by 9  per  cent.\r\n\r\nIn  our society there are those who are very  rich\r\n\r\nand  those  who  are very poor.  The  poor  people\r\n\r\ncannot  have  anything to eat. Most  of  them  are\r\n\r\nliving  from  hand  to mouth.  There  is  a  great\r\n\r\ndistinction between the two classes. There  is  no\r\n\r\nactual  improvement in the living standard in  our\r\n\r\nsociety.  Everybody who is clear  minded  can  see\r\n\r\nthis.  There are many poor people who live in  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance's own constituency of  Kreta\r\n\r\nAyer  who are living in pigeon-hole huts.  We  can\r\n\r\nalso see this everywhere in Singapore. This is the\r\n\r\nresult  of  the Government's so-called  equal  and\r\n\r\nfair  economic policy. This is because the  wealth\r\n\r\nis  being shared by only a small minority  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. Only those who cannot see the realities of\r\n\r\nthe  situation  will  be fooled  by  the  P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\neconomic statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the national income, we can judge\r\n\r\nit from another angle. I am pleased to see that the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister has not forgotten  to  remind  us\r\n\r\nthat  from  1960 to 1961 the price  of  rubber  has\r\n\r\nrisen.  But  he has not told us that  our  national\r\n\r\nincome has increased proportionally. As a result of\r\n\r\nthe  economic situation, I would like to tell  the\r\n\r\nHouse  about the structure of the national  income.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is engaged in entrepot trade. Therefore,\r\n\r\nit  is dependent on trade with other countries. Our\r\n\r\neconomy - our well-being and prosperity - is lined up\r\n\r\nwith   this.   If  other  countries  experience   a\r\n\r\nprosperity   in  their  economy,   we   will   also\r\n\r\nexperience  the same thing. But when  they  have  a\r\n\r\ndepression,  we  will suffer as a  consequence.  We\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  bear the sufferings of  others  as\r\n\r\nwell.  From  this  we  can see  that  our  entrepot\r\n\r\neconomy  will  subject  our national  income  to  a\r\n\r\npassive role and status. We should have a long-term\r\n\r\npolicy  on  the  national income  and  not  just  a\r\n\r\ntemporary one which will fluctuate according to the\r\n\r\neconomic  circumstances in other  countries.  Today\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  which has been imposed on the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, has brought great suffering on them.  It\r\n\r\nis   because  of  Malaysia  that  the  economy   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  has also suffered. We can see  all  this\r\n\r\nfrom the Budget statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now talk about this in detail. According\r\n\r\nto   the  Malaysia  Agreement,  there  are  certain\r\n\r\nprovisions  regarding  harmonisation  in   tariffs.\r\n\r\nSingapore will have to raise its taxes to the level\r\n\r\nprevailing in Malaya. This means that there will he\r\n\r\nhigher  taxes in Singapore. This will in turn  mean\r\n\r\nthat  the  cost  of  living in  Singapore  will  be\r\n\r\naccordingly raised. For instance, when today $2 may\r\n\r\nbe able to feed a family for one day, in future the\r\n\r\n$2  will not be enough to feed it for a whole  day,\r\n\r\nbecause the prices of all essential goods will have\r\n\r\nrisen.  Whatever  statistics you may  produce,  you\r\n\r\ncannot  explain this away to the people.  They  can\r\n\r\nmake  their  own calculations. They  can  also  see\r\n\r\nclearly that this suffering has been brought  about\r\n\r\nby  the  P.A.P. Government. In the Budget statement\r\n\r\nthere is mention of an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincrease  of  petrol  tax. But  in  future  we  can\r\n\r\nforesee more taxes on other things. The P.A.P.,  on\r\n\r\nthe  one hand, increases the petrol tax and, on the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  reduces the tax on  entertainment  in\r\n\r\norder to give the facade that the people have  more\r\n\r\nbenefits  than  taxes.  The concessions  in  owner-occupied  attap houses only affect  a  few  people.\r\n\r\nMany people living in houses with zinc roofs in the\r\n\r\nrural areas will not be benefited. In the end, when\r\n\r\nthere  is a general increase in taxes and the  cost\r\n\r\nof  living goes up, the poor people will suffer. We\r\n\r\nagree  with  any  policy that will  bring  about  a\r\n\r\nbetter  economic situation to benefit the majority.\r\n\r\nBut  the  P.A.P.,  on  the one hand,  exercises  an\r\n\r\neconomic  squeeze, and on the other hand, they  ask\r\n\r\npeople not to spend so much on certain things. They\r\n\r\ngive  the  people something with one hand but  they\r\n\r\ntake away more from them with the other hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia has brought about difficulties to\r\n\r\nSingapore's entrepot trade. Singapore has all along\r\n\r\nbeen depending on entrepot trade with Indonesia. As\r\n\r\na  result,  this trade now suffers. The losses  are\r\n\r\ngreat.  The  effects of economic  fluctuations  are\r\n\r\nseen  in  a  chain  reaction, and other  multiplyer\r\n\r\neffects  will  arise. The severance of  trade  will\r\n\r\nbring  about  long-term  effects  which  are   more\r\n\r\nserious  than the P.A.P. have made out to  be.  But\r\n\r\nworse  days brought about by Malaysia are to  come.\r\n\r\nAt  present the losses are not too extensive but we\r\n\r\ncan  see that they are mounting. We can see  a  few\r\n\r\nthings.   Because  of  the  severance   of   trade,\r\n\r\nSingapore has suffered a loss of $9 million,  about\r\n\r\n8.7  per cent according to the calculations by  the\r\n\r\nMinister. About 8,200 workers will lose their  jobs\r\n\r\nbecause of the loss of imports of agricultural  and\r\n\r\nother products. The loss of about $209 million will\r\n\r\nmean  that  our  loss of annual Budget  expenditure\r\n\r\nwill  be  about two-thirds per year. It will  bring\r\n\r\nabout  a worse economic situation in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nmore people will be jobless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister's calculations, there\r\n\r\nare  8,200  who are out of job as a consequence  of\r\n\r\nconfrontation. But this is under-assessment.  There\r\n\r\nare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  workers  who  find it difficult  to  maintain\r\n\r\ntheir   livelihood.   These  workers   are   mainly\r\n\r\nconnected  with processing in factories  and  other\r\n\r\nrelated  trades. There are about tens of  thousands\r\n\r\nincluding their families - very many more  than  the\r\n\r\nMinister's calculations. There are hawkers, workers\r\n\r\nand others indirectly affected. So the significance\r\n\r\nis  more than what the Minister has made it out  to\r\n\r\nbe.  There  are  tens of thousands of  people  thus\r\n\r\naffected by this chain reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody is concerned about the way the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis resolving the present difficulties. Whenever the\r\n\r\nGovernment faces any economic difficulty,  it  will\r\n\r\npossibly adopt one of two methods, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To sacrifice the interests of the majority in\r\n\r\norder to tide over the difficulties temporarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To look after the interests of the majority\r\n\r\nin order to tide over the temporary difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, these two lines will clearly show which\r\n\r\nGovernment  will be pro-people and which Government\r\n\r\nwill be anti-people. Fundamentally the P.A.P. adopt\r\n\r\nthe first method. The measures that they adopt will\r\n\r\nhe only a palliative to alleviate the difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe  measures adopted by the P.A.P. Government have\r\n\r\none  characteristic.  That  is,  they  neglect  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  people.  Firstly,  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  an  active  promoter  of  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nInevitably  it  will  adopt  a  policy  which  will\r\n\r\nsacrifice the interests of the people; secondly, it\r\n\r\nis  neglecting the interests of the taxpayers.  The\r\n\r\nworking class pay most of the taxes but they derive\r\n\r\nless benefits.

At the same time, we demand  that  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the working class should be protected\r\n\r\nand  looked  after because they are the people  who\r\n\r\nare  the source of our national wealth. It is their\r\n\r\nlabour and effort which fills our coffers. Any good\r\n\r\ngovernment  will have to make use  of  the  revenue\r\n\r\nfrom  the people on the people themselves.

Today\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. are  in a very difficult  predicament.\r\n\r\nThey  are  trying to make use of all the  beautiful\r\n\r\nphrases  to  fool the people so as to disguise  the\r\n\r\nfact that it is the P.A.P. that have brought misery\r\n\r\nand  difficulty to the people and so that they will\r\n\r\nhave some hope in the P.A.P.'s economic policy.

Let me\r\n\r\nnow  continue with my speech. It is an  example  of\r\n\r\ntheir   controlling  the  Press   and   suppressing\r\n\r\npublications. As long as colonial forces are in our\r\n\r\nland,   we  will  not  be  able  to  build  up   an\r\n\r\nindependent  national economy. We  must  strive  to\r\n\r\nbuild up an independent, free national economy.  If\r\n\r\na  Party  is not anti-colonialist, it will  not  be\r\n\r\nable to get rid of foreign economic influence.  But\r\n\r\nnow  that the Malaysia Plan has been imposed on the\r\n\r\npeople,  it  is  another phase of  neo-colonialism.\r\n\r\nBritish  capitalists are in control of our economy,\r\n\r\nwhich  under  the  P.A.P. is  one  that  will  only\r\n\r\nbenefit  foreign  capitalists.  We  should  have  a\r\n\r\nnational economy. The economic plans of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nare  in league with foreign capitalists. The  local\r\n\r\nmerchants  are not being encouraged to be  national\r\n\r\ncapitalists  but  encouraged to be compradores  and\r\n\r\ncollaborators   of  foreign  capitalists.   Foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists and monopolists have intruded into  our\r\n\r\nmarket,  and  our  market has been dwindling,  thus\r\n\r\naffecting  our  national  income  and  the   living\r\n\r\nstandards of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople.

They    shout    about\r\n\r\nindustrialisation,  never  realising  that  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestment  has  swallowed up local investment  and\r\n\r\nlocal  income.  We  should sigh  at  this  type  of\r\n\r\neconomic  plans  of  the  Government.  The  present\r\n\r\neconomic situation in Singapore and its effects  on\r\n\r\nthe  people are just as one great poet in the  Tang\r\n\r\nDynasty had described - that there are foodstuffs in\r\n\r\nthe  granary of the rich but they rot due to  over-storage;  while,  on  the  other  hand,  there  are\r\n\r\nthousands  dead  on  the  road.  Now,  we  are  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people. We should do  things\r\n\r\nin  the  interests of the people and  our  economic\r\n\r\nplans  should be those that will meet the  majority\r\n\r\nof  the  people and our views should also  be  from\r\n\r\nthis  angle.  I  would like to  remind  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment that every cent the P.A.P. get  is  from\r\n\r\nthe  pockets of the people. Take, for instance, our\r\n\r\ndevelopment  plan.  British  investment  forms  the\r\n\r\ncapital.  British loans amount to $8.6 million  and\r\n\r\nimmovable assets amount to $15.3 million,  and  the\r\n\r\nsurplus   comes  from  the  pockets  of  taxpayers.\r\n\r\nEverywhere in the world the situation is like this.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P.  Government gets  the  money  from  the\r\n\r\npeople and it is spent in the form of public loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance in his statement told us that the Four-Year Development Plan is almost completed, and it amounts to 79 per cent success. If we include all those plans abandoned and increased, then we can see that the success only amounts to 30 per cent. Let us see the actual\r\n\r\nsituation.  In the Four-Year Development  Plan  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  are  for economic development,  $506.08\r\n\r\nmillion,  whereas  actual  expenditure  is  $306.43\r\n\r\nmillion.  It is only 60.5 per cent. Next is  social\r\n\r\ndevelopment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namounting  to $351.75 million, whereas  the  actual\r\n\r\nexpenditure  is $200.4 million, which is  56.9  per\r\n\r\ncent. The third is public administration. The  Plan\r\n\r\nprovides   $13.19   million,   while   the   actual\r\n\r\nexpenditure is $8.72 million, amounting to 66.1 per\r\n\r\ncent. The Finance Minister's success of 79 per cent\r\n\r\nis  only  a  hope. The actual success is  60.5  per\r\n\r\ncent.  If we want to examine the work of the  Four-Year  Development Plan, then we should compare  the\r\n\r\nactual  work  accomplished and the money  spent  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  the  provisions  made  therein.   The\r\n\r\nMinister   is  trying  to  give  the   people   the\r\n\r\nimpression  that almost the whole of the  Four-Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan has been realised. In actual fact,\r\n\r\nthe  time  limit  has already  passed  and  yet  in\r\n\r\ncertain   projects  only  2  per  cent   has   been\r\n\r\naccomplished in relation to the Plan. Now  what  is\r\n\r\nthere   to  brag  about?  The  P.A.P.  Government's\r\n\r\nintention  is  that after the end of the  Four-Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan, it will be able to provide 40,000\r\n\r\njobs.  But  up  till now how many  jobs  have  been\r\n\r\noffered? Not a word was mentioned in the speech  of\r\n\r\nthe Minister about how many jobs are available. And\r\n\r\nyet  he  brags  about the success of the  Four-Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan! Why does he  not  want  to  talk\r\n\r\nabout  the  percentage of the jobs available  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  this  Four-Year Development  Plan?  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government blames the Communist bogey on the\r\n\r\ninability  of  the  Four-Year Development  Plan  to\r\n\r\nmaterialise.  Their intention is to  sacrifice  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the majority of the people in order  to\r\n\r\nbenefit  the  foreign  monopolists.  That  is   why\r\n\r\nwhatever  they  do is against the interest  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the people. And it is only natural that\r\n\r\nthey meet with opposition and criticism everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> I\r\n\r\ncan  see  that  the  Member for Tampines  is  still\r\n\r\nreading  his  text.

Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen who  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger here have been repeating themselves for  the\r\n\r\nlast two and a half years. Is it necessary for them\r\n\r\nto  do  so?

In  view of  that,  I  would  have\r\n\r\nthought that - three months have passed since the pro-Communist  Barisan Sosialis suffered  a  disastrous\r\n\r\ndefeat - they would have used these three months  to\r\n\r\nadopt  an intelligent policy.

Nevertheless, it will not be\r\n\r\nout  of order for me to bring the attention of this\r\n\r\nHouse to what the Barisan Sosialis Members - Barisan\r\n\r\nCommunists  - were saying in regard  to  the  Budget\r\n\r\nyesterday and today and what has already been  said\r\n\r\nover  Radio  Jakarta a week ago.

October 21st:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The entrepot trade in Singapore and Penang has\r\n\r\nsuffered serious setbacks.

They  cannot  deny\r\n\r\nthe validity of this evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the report goes on to say,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Singapore Minister for Finance, Dr Goh Keng\r\n\r\nSwee, said that because of the trade severance with\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  many  factories  using  Indonesian  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials will have to close down. Half the workers\r\n\r\nand so on...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then  again, even earlier on, that is, in November,\r\n\r\nRadio Keman Kesatuan Malaya Merdeka again came back\r\n\r\nwith  a  story entitled \"Singapore Suffering  Under\r\n\r\nConfrontation\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thesis that has been developed in regard to\r\n\r\nthe  Budget, the essence of their argument is  that\r\n\r\n- I  have been taking down extensive notes - the only\r\n\r\nway Singapore can solve its economic problems is by\r\n\r\ncoming to terms with Indonesia. They do not say  on\r\n\r\nwhat  terms, whether we go down on our bended knees\r\n\r\nin  coming  to terms with Indonesia, and  therefore\r\n\r\ntaking  advantage of the 100 million customers  who\r\n\r\nare  waiting  for  us.  In  fact,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTampines     suggested    that    prospects     for\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  are  not  bright,  because  with\r\n\r\nconfrontation,  the 100 million  Indonesian  market\r\n\r\nwould  be  lost.  And the whole  essence  of  their\r\n\r\nspeeches  on  the Budget is to ask that  we  should\r\n\r\nabandon  Malaysia and come to terms with  Indonesia\r\n\r\n- on any terms - and assure ourselves of a market  of\r\n\r\n100 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With due respect to you, Sir, I stress this point\r\n\r\nto  show  that we should treat the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nfor what they are. Their comments on the Budget  or\r\n\r\non any matter are suspect. They are not doing so in\r\n\r\nthe  interest of the people of Singapore but in the\r\n\r\ninterest  of their foreign masters, whom they  dare\r\n\r\nnot  criticise. They criticise the Government which\r\n\r\npays them $500 a month, but they have not said  one\r\n\r\nword   against  their  foreign  masters.  Did  they\r\n\r\ncriticise them, Sir? They say that confrontation is\r\n\r\nresponsible for all our economic difficulties. Will\r\n\r\nthey  be responsible for the failure of the  Budget\r\n\r\nthat our Minister for Finance has drawn up? But did\r\n\r\nthey   even   once  indicate  whether   they   want\r\n\r\nconfrontation  to succeed or fail?  They  have  not\r\n\r\nanswered  that and I hope they will answer  it.

Government. Before I \r\n\r\nmake further comments on the observations that  the \r\n\r\nso-called   representatives  of   the   people   of \r\n\r\nSingapore    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopposite  have been making on the Budget,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to say something about the basic beliefs  and\r\n\r\noutlook of the Government which has presented  this\r\n\r\nBudget.  After  all,  a  Budget  and  the  economic\r\n\r\npolicies must reflect the character and aspirations\r\n\r\nof  the Government and the Party which shapes  that\r\n\r\nBudget. A government of crooks will shape a  Budget\r\n\r\nto  promote the interest of crooks. A government of\r\n\r\ncapitalists  will  naturally  devise  a  Budget  to\r\n\r\nprotect and advance the interests of capitalists. A\r\n\r\ngovernment  consisting of men  out  for  loot  will\r\n\r\nshape a Budget to make such things possible. And  a\r\n\r\ngovernment  composed of eminent  Members  like  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis will definitely shape a Budget  to\r\n\r\nsell out the country to their masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government consists of men who believe\r\n\r\nin  a  socialist  ideology. Sir, when  we  talk  of\r\n\r\nsocialism,  we  do not put inverted commas  as  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  opposite do.  When  we  talk  of\r\n\r\nsocialism, we mean non-Communist socialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the last few days they have been talking about the Communist bogey. I will not venture into a new line of argument - I will reserve that for Monday - about the so-called Communist bogey. But we are a socialist Government and both as individuals and as members of a\r\n\r\npolitical Party we are therefore neither creatures,\r\n\r\nspokesmen  or  servile nominees of  big  capitalist\r\n\r\nconcerns nor, at the other extreme like the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  puppets  of  Communist  manipulators  or\r\n\r\npolitical pimps for Indonesian confrontationists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

We took  a  solemn\r\n\r\noath and we pay great regard to any oath we take. I\r\n\r\ncannot  say the same thing for the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nAssemblymen. Therefore, the strength and welfare of\r\n\r\nour  Party  lies in our being able  to  ensure  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  happiness for the maximum  number  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  We  are not, as I have said, tied  to  any\r\n\r\ncapitalist or reactionary group. We do not have  to\r\n\r\nserve their interest at the expense of the majority\r\n\r\nof  the people. Moreover, we are not bound, as  the\r\n\r\nCommunists are - as the Barisan are - to deliberately\r\n\r\nspread  poverty, discontent and economic  chaos  in\r\n\r\norder to pave the way for a Communist revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the P.A.P. is a patriotic Malaysian Party\r\n\r\ntied   to  no  privileged  minority  interest,   or\r\n\r\npredatory alien forces, or enemies of our  country,\r\n\r\nwe  can  therefore afford to devise a Budget  which\r\n\r\nwill  not only make the country prosperous but will\r\n\r\nensure  at  the  same time that this prosperity  is\r\n\r\nfairly and justly distributed among all classes  of\r\n\r\npeople.  We can afford to ensure that our  economic\r\n\r\nand  financial policies are such that  inequalities\r\n\r\nof  wealth  are  evened  out without  throwing  our\r\n\r\neconomy into chaos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1959 when the P.A.P. Government assumed\r\n\r\npower,  its  economic policy, as  revealed  in  its\r\n\r\nBudgets,  has been directed towards two objectives.\r\n\r\nAnd in this connection, Sir, may I say to the eight\r\n\r\nrepresentatives --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Seven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Seven.

But anyway before\r\n\r\nthey come out with further badly-written scripts, I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest that they refer to the  speeches  of\r\n\r\ntheir  Chairman, the present Chairman, in the first\r\n\r\nBudget Session of this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd   some   of  their  present  Barisan   Sosialis\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  whether above ground  or  underground,\r\n\r\nwhether   in  this  country  or  in  their  adopted\r\n\r\nhomeland,  had  different  ideas  then  about   our\r\n\r\nBudget.  At  that  time in 1959, they  praised  our\r\n\r\neconomic  policy,  the policy of the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance,  whom  they now regard as reactionary.  At\r\n\r\nthat  time, they said that it was a good  socialist\r\n\r\nBudget,  good  for the people and the  best  Budget\r\n\r\nthat  we ever had. That was in 1959, the Budget  of\r\n\r\nthe  same Finance Minister. Only those who said  it\r\n\r\nthen  do not now belong to the same Party,  do  not\r\n\r\nhold  office and they are not in this Chamber. They\r\n\r\nsaid  that  because at that time the speeches  were\r\n\r\nwritten from this side of the House. At that  time,\r\n\r\nSir, some of the Barisan Assemblymen knew that this\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  fashioning  the  Budget   was   not\r\n\r\nidentified with any capitalist or foreign interest,\r\n\r\nbut  with  the interest of the people,  because  we\r\n\r\nhave  no  other affiliations. So in fashioning  our\r\n\r\nBudget  we have two objectives, and that  is  quite\r\n\r\nclear even in the present Budget speech made by the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of this is to plan for our future needs\r\n\r\nto   meet   not  only  the  demands  of  a  rapidly\r\n\r\nincreasing population for jobs but also  to  change\r\n\r\nthe  character  of  an  economy  from  a  primarily\r\n\r\ntrading  one to an industrial one. I do  not  think\r\n\r\neven  the Barisan Communists can complain that that\r\n\r\nis  a  bad  objective. However, to do  this,  means\r\n\r\nspending  some of our resources not by  doling  out\r\n\r\nfree  gifts  and thus enjoying temporary popularity\r\n\r\nbut in investing them in development projects which\r\n\r\nwould  ensure  that in the future our children  and\r\n\r\nour population will be able to enjoy a decent life.\r\n\r\nWere  the  P.A.P. a Government of opportunists,  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  men  concerned  with  only  keeping\r\n\r\nthemselves in power for the next few years, then it\r\n\r\ncould  have  bought popularity by doling  out  such\r\n\r\nmoney  and reserves as we have in free gifts.  Just\r\n\r\nas the Member for Tampines said, \"Oh, why not give\r\n\r\nfree  houses? Increase this and increase that.\"  We\r\n\r\ncould  do that. It is not our money. We could  have\r\n\r\nan election immediately\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter  that to ensure that not one Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nis returned. We could even double everybody's wages\r\n\r\nand possibly even increase the ration allowance  in\r\n\r\nChangi. We could do that to be popular. It  is  not\r\n\r\nour  money. We have plenty of money in reserve.  We\r\n\r\ncould  even  give  every married couple  a  scooter\r\n\r\nfree.  That  is what many of their speeches  amount\r\n\r\nto.  \"Oh, why do you not give more of this? Why not\r\n\r\nmore  of  that?\"  We  can  do  it  if  we  are   an\r\n\r\nirresponsible and a stupid government. But  we  are\r\n\r\nnot  an irresponsible or a stupid government.  Some\r\n\r\nof   the   suggestions   put   forward   - so-called\r\n\r\nconstructive criticisms of the Budget - by  some  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen amount to, \"Have a\r\n\r\nbig  carnival  for  two years.  Free  booze.  Enjoy\r\n\r\nyourselves. Lots of money in the kitty.\"  But  what\r\n\r\nhappens after that when the party is over? But as I\r\n\r\nhave  said, this is a deliberate policy. Let us  be\r\n\r\nfrank  about  it. The Barisan Sosialis for  obvious\r\n\r\nreasons   are   not  interested   in   ensuring   a\r\n\r\nprosperous, peaceful and happy Malaysia because  if\r\n\r\nthere is a prosperous, peaceful and happy Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthen  they are out. They have a vested interest  in\r\n\r\npoverty  and disease - as the instruments  of  alien\r\n\r\npowers  out  to destroy Singapore. It  is  logical,\r\n\r\nSir, as I shall show you later on. But for the time\r\n\r\nbeing,  let  us  return  to  this.  We  could  have\r\n\r\nfollowed  the  course  followed  in  certain  Asian\r\n\r\ncountries  which the Gentlemen opposite admire  and\r\n\r\non whose behalf they are fighting in this Assembly.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we have not got a Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nof that calibre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in the Monitoring Digest of 7th December.\r\n\r\nThe  country which they admire and on whose  behalf\r\n\r\nthey  are  working - here is their economic  policy:\r\n\r\nSubandrio  purposely  neglected  economy  to   gain\r\n\r\nnational identity. Is that the policy they want  to\r\n\r\nfollow?  Have you to impoverish your own population\r\n\r\nso  that  you  can claim national identity?  He  is\r\n\r\ntheir  pinup  boy, their hero. Is that  the  policy\r\n\r\nthey  want us to follow? Is that the policy of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis which they want us to follow?  Is\r\n\r\nthat  what they are working for - to ensure that  it\r\n\r\nwill come about in Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe   Foreign  Minister  said  that  in  the   past\r\n\r\nIndonesia had to neglect her economy purposely - not\r\n\r\naccidentally,  not by ignorance, not by  stupidity,\r\n\r\nbut purposely, because she wanted to regain her own\r\n\r\nidentity first for further development. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Some people might find it ridiculous that\r\n\r\nIndonesia  gave  priority to  the  revival  of  her\r\n\r\nidentity and not to economic development. But after\r\n\r\nwe  have managed to revive our own identity,  after\r\n\r\nthe  iron spirit of the Indonesian people has  been\r\n\r\nrevived,  we can then establish in full  swing  the\r\n\r\neconomic  rehabilitation and  exploitation  of  our\r\n\r\nwealth and resources.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  we are not interested in the kind of economic\r\n\r\npolicies followed in the country of their adoption.\r\n\r\nIn  Singapore,  we  do it differently.  We  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  it is necessary to revive  the  iron\r\n\r\nspirit  of  our people by depriving them  of  their\r\n\r\nnecessities  of  life. And in this  Budget  we  - at\r\n\r\nleast  the  P.A.P. Government; I do not know  about\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis  - prefer  to  stick  to  the\r\n\r\nsomewhat  old-fashioned thesis that it is the  duty\r\n\r\nof  a  democratic socialist government to  increase\r\n\r\nthe  living standard of the people first, not  only\r\n\r\nfor  the  people today but also for those who  come\r\n\r\nafter us. Therefore, investing for the future means\r\n\r\nnot  consuming  and frittering away all  our  money\r\n\r\ntoday. We have to balance between improving the lot\r\n\r\nof  the  people  today  as well  as  investing  and\r\n\r\nbuilding  for the future. With due modesty,  I  can\r\n\r\nsay  that  we have managed since 1959 to  hold  the\r\n\r\nbalance   between  what  is  necessary   to   spend\r\n\r\nimmediately and what is necessary to invest for the\r\n\r\nfuture. We have avoided falling into either extreme\r\n\r\nin  this respect. We could follow the Communist and\r\n\r\nother  totalitarian methods of developing a country\r\n\r\nquickly.  We  could  force  savings  by  compelling\r\n\r\npeople to make do with the barest minimum necessary\r\n\r\nto  keep body and soul together. That is one way of\r\n\r\ndoing  it, at least for the mass of the people.  We\r\n\r\ncould,   if   we   adopted  Communist  totalitarian\r\n\r\nmethods,  even  kill off a few  million  people  by\r\n\r\nproviding them with a starvation living standard. I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Barisan Sosialis Members opposite  know\r\n\r\nwhat I am referring to. Many of them,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  am  quite  sure,  would  consider  it  barbaric,\r\n\r\ninhuman and undemocratic if they were forced to  go\r\n\r\nto countries which they otherwise proclaim to be  a\r\n\r\nworkers'   paradise.  I  had   the   privilege   of\r\n\r\noccasionally  listening to other  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nMembers - stalwarts - \"great supporters of socialism\"\r\n\r\nextolling  and  praising  with  delight  the  great\r\n\r\nthings  that  are  being achieved in  the  workers'\r\n\r\nparadise.  But  these discussions  invariably  took\r\n\r\nplace  in  the most fashionable and expensive  bars\r\n\r\nand  restaurants in Singapore where they give  tips\r\n\r\nwhich can feed a family in a workers' paradise  for\r\n\r\nat least a week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we the P.A.P. Government - a socialist\r\n\r\nGovernment, without inverted commas - have  in  this\r\n\r\nand  other  Budgets provided for future development\r\n\r\nwithout  at  the  same  time  reducing  the  living\r\n\r\nstandards of our people. On the contrary, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister provided statistics in his  Budget\r\n\r\nspeech  to  show that, despite the efforts  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis Communists to wreck  our  economy\r\n\r\nthrough     politically    motivated     industrial\r\n\r\nintimidation and unrest and despite the hundreds of\r\n\r\nmillions  of dollars that the Government has  spent\r\n\r\non  development  projects, there  has  nevertheless\r\n\r\nbeen  at the same time since 1959 - and particularly\r\n\r\nduring   the   last  three  years  - an  appreciable\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the overall living standards  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, lest they may think that this is a partisan\r\n\r\nclaim  -  a Government Minister boasting about  his\r\n\r\nown  Government  - may  I therefore  quote  from  an\r\n\r\nimpartial observer? Sir, this is an extract from an\r\n\r\narticle  published  by  the  Far  Eastern  Economic\r\n\r\nReview of 18th July, 1963, and before they jump  to\r\n\r\nthe  conclusion that it is a neo-colonial magazine,\r\n\r\nlet  me  say  that  this is a Hong  Kong  magazine,\r\n\r\npublished  in Hong Kong and edited by  Asians.  And\r\n\r\nthis  is  what they have to say after referring  to\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. as  one  of  the  most  efficient  and\r\n\r\nenergetic governments in the world today. They  say\r\n\r\nthat  after  all the money that we  have  spent  on\r\n\r\nhousing  development and so on, the rice bowls  and\r\n\r\nrestaurants and coffee-shops\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  full,  cinemas  are packed,  taxi-drivers  and\r\n\r\nhawkers  are  kept  busy and hair-dressing  saloons\r\n\r\nreport  record business. Sir, these are not  to  be\r\n\r\nfound  in  a  workers' paradise where I  understand\r\n\r\nhair-dressers are not even in business,  let  alone\r\n\r\nreport record business. Last year's statistics show\r\n\r\nthat  the  number of people who can afford  to  buy\r\n\r\nluxuries - luxuries, not necessities - grew steadily.\r\n\r\n80  per  cent more motor-cars were sold in 1962;  6\r\n\r\nper  cent  more  refrigerators,  8  per  cent  more\r\n\r\nradios,  27  per cent more cameras and 7  per  cent\r\n\r\nmore  liquor.  Private builders after  three  timid\r\n\r\nyears   now  have  about  4,000  apartments   under\r\n\r\nconstruction.   Dealers   have   been    pleasantly\r\n\r\nsurprised  at the great demand for T.V. sets  since\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of T.V. broadcasting a few months\r\n\r\nago;  and  they are quite clear as to the cause  of\r\n\r\nthis  affluence. Government expenditure in planning\r\n\r\nis  directly and indirectly responsible for many of\r\n\r\nthese   signs  of  modest  prosperity  and  growing\r\n\r\neconomic confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a far cry from their pinup boy who\r\n\r\nsays that one good sign of a progressive society is\r\n\r\nto  ensure  deliberately that no development  takes\r\n\r\nplace. And it is on behalf of people with that idea\r\n\r\nthat they are working for. Sir, we in Singapore, as\r\n\r\nI  have said, believe otherwise. The Government has\r\n\r\nspent more than $500 million on projects during the\r\n\r\npast   three  years  without,  at  the  same  time,\r\n\r\nreducing  our living standard to poverty level  but\r\n\r\ninstead  increasing it. This was achieved, and  the\r\n\r\nwell-fed  Barisan  Sosialis Members  opposite  know\r\n\r\nthis  despite  the increase of our population  from\r\n\r\n1.58  million to 1.73 million during the past three\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not for one moment suggesting that we\r\n\r\nhave created during the last three or four years  a\r\n\r\nsociety  where there is no poverty or  unemployment\r\n\r\nor  gross inequalities. These evils exist, but what\r\n\r\nwe  claim is that during the past few years we have\r\n\r\nnot   only   prevented  poverty  and  misery   from\r\n\r\nextending,  as  it  has  in the  country  of  their\r\n\r\nadoption,  but we have succeeded to an  appreciable\r\n\r\nextent in ironing out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngross inequalities and economic injustices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Barisan Sosialis Communists may complain\r\n\r\nthat  the P.A.P. Government has failed to create  a\r\n\r\nUtopia  in the short space of three or four  years,\r\n\r\nbut  what  should  be obvious to everyone  is  that\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding       economic       confrontation,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding      the     Barisan      Sosialis,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding Communist attempts to  disrupt  our\r\n\r\neconomy during the past three years, the P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nlaid  the  foundation  for an  economy  which  will\r\n\r\nensure better prospects and rising living standards\r\n\r\nnot  only  for our present population but also  for\r\n\r\nfuture generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice, Sir, and even the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  cannot  help  but  notice,  that  in  the\r\n\r\npresent   Budget  something  like   two-thirds   of\r\n\r\nGovernment revenue will be spent on social services\r\n\r\nlike schools, clinics, and hospitals to provide for\r\n\r\nthe  immediate  needs of the people.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nother  country  in Asia - workers' paradise  or  not\r\n\r\n- and  certainly  in  South-East Asia,  where  every\r\n\r\nchild  can  find a place in school, where  ordinary\r\n\r\npeople  can get cheap and healthy homes  and  where\r\n\r\nthe  sick  get  free  treatment  in  Government-run\r\n\r\nhospitals.  And the P.A.P. can afford to  follow  a\r\n\r\nprogressive economic policy, because unlike certain\r\n\r\nRight-wing  Parties which are  no  longer  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, and unlike the Barisan Sosialis which  is\r\n\r\nrepresented by a rump in this Assembly, we are  not \r\n\r\nthe  creatures  of a privileged minority  or  alien \r\n\r\nforces  dedicated to the destruction of our country \r\n\r\nand  our  people. And this brings me to the various \r\n\r\nobservations made by the Barisan Sosialis  speakers \r\n\r\nlike, \"Oh, this Budget is not doing enough for  the \r\n\r\npoor people and for the suffering workers.\" That is \r\n\r\nthe  theme  of their speeches. They shed  crocodile \r\n\r\ntears.  Suffering  people! The  workers!  The  same \r\n\r\nParty which threw 1,700 people out of job. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The same people\r\n\r\ncome here to moan and groan about the sufferings of\r\n\r\nthe  workers and the unemployed. It is their  union\r\n\r\nleaders,  Mr  Woodhull has already confessed,  who\r\n\r\nmucked things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow  they come here and say. \"We shed tears for the\r\n\r\nsufferings of the people and the workers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask the Barisan Sosialis a very simple but\r\n\r\na   very  important  question.  We  have  a  vested\r\n\r\ninterest  for  the  reasons I  have  explained  - to\r\n\r\nensure  that we run our government in  such  a  way\r\n\r\nthat  people are prosperous and get more jobs,  and\r\n\r\nour economy succeeds. But have the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\na  vested  interest,  a real genuine  interest,  in\r\n\r\nensuring a prosperous and happy people? That  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  important question, Sir. Have they  a  vested\r\n\r\ninterest in ensuring a prosperous Malaysia?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my submission, Sir, that the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  by  the  very nature  of  its  political\r\n\r\ncharacter  and its political objective, which  they\r\n\r\nhave  openly  proclaimed,  must  fight  not  for  a\r\n\r\nprosperous  Malaysia but for a  bankrupt  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  must  destroy  Malaysia.  They   are\r\n\r\ncommitted to destroying Malaysia. They say they are\r\n\r\nagainst  Malaysia. Do they expect us  seriously  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that they are going to work very  hard  to\r\n\r\nensure  a  prosperous and happy Malaysia? Are  they\r\n\r\ngoing  to work for a prosperous and happy Malaysia?\r\n\r\nIf  they do, they cannot destroy Malaysia. It  will\r\n\r\nsurvive,  and  become stronger. So,  how  can  they\r\n\r\ngenuinely  work  for the prosperity  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbecause  to  do  that is to destroy themselves,  to\r\n\r\ndestroy their own objective, which is to finish off\r\n\r\nMalaysia on behalf of foreign powers. That is  what\r\n\r\nthey  have already proclaimed openly. That is their\r\n\r\nobjective. So how can they then really work to make\r\n\r\nthe  workers  happier? Because if the  workers  are\r\n\r\nhappier,   they  will  not  support   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, they will support the P.A.P. If  Malaysia\r\n\r\nprospers, they will not listen to the anti-Malaysia\r\n\r\nline, they will support Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sir, the fact that the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nare really out to destroy Malaysia is indicated  by\r\n\r\na  remark  that  one of the hon.  Members  opposite\r\n\r\nmade.  He said, in connection with the $118 million\r\n\r\nthat we pay for Federal services in Singapore,  $78\r\n\r\nmillion  is for local services and $40 million  for\r\n\r\ndefence  which, he said, is to oppress the  people.\r\n\r\nOppress the people! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is  quite  clear that they  do  not  want\r\n\r\nMalaysia to be defended against their masters. They\r\n\r\ntake great objection to our spending $40 million to\r\n\r\nprotect  our own country when the country of  their\r\n\r\nadoption  boasts of 400,000 men - more money  spent\r\n\r\non  their  army than on their people. And  here  we\r\n\r\nspend  a  modest sum of $40 million to protect  our\r\n\r\nfishermen who get robbed by their friends - not  our\r\n\r\nfriends!  They  steal  watches  and  we  spend  $40\r\n\r\nmillion  to  ensure  that our poor  fishermen,  our\r\n\r\npeople,  can  keep  their  fish,  can  keep   their\r\n\r\nvessels.  But  they  do not want  that.  They  say,\r\n\r\n\"Scrap this $40 million. Leave it open.\" Then there\r\n\r\ncan  be piracy in Singapore itself. A chap can come\r\n\r\nright up to this Chamber, Sir, and our watches  are\r\n\r\ngone!  That  is what they want. That  is  why  they\r\n\r\nobject  to defence. That is why they ask  that  the\r\n\r\nNaval  Base be scrapped. Are they going  to  defend\r\n\r\nSingapore for us? Are these gentlemen going to take\r\n\r\nout rifles and stop 400,000 men? Did they volunteer\r\n\r\neven for West Irian? Probably some of the gentlemen\r\n\r\ndid.  The  only country which they are prepared  to\r\n\r\ndefend is West Irian.

They\r\n\r\nare  praying and hoping - they never deny  it  - that\r\n\r\nconfrontation  succeeds. Why? I  understand  a  few\r\n\r\ndays  ago  they  even  claimed  credit  for  having\r\n\r\ninitiated  the confrontation policy, and  that  the\r\n\r\n100 million people in Indonesia just followed them.\r\n\r\nWell,  that  is a good admission. It  is  in  their\r\n\r\nParty  paper.  They are proud of it. They  have  to\r\n\r\npublish   in  their  Party  paper  that  they   are\r\n\r\nresponsible  for confrontation, which  is  throwing\r\n\r\nour people out of job. And yet earlier - I think  it\r\n\r\nwas  the Member for Tampines - he was shedding tears\r\n\r\nabout  the sufferings of the tongkang men,  of  the\r\n\r\nnational capitalists whom he has helped to ruin. He\r\n\r\nand  his Party. They claimed that they started this\r\n\r\nconfrontation. They said so. They had the  idea  of\r\n\r\nconfrontation,  and  the  100  million  people   of\r\n\r\nIndonesia  said,  \"Dr Lee  Siew  Choh  and  the  8\r\n\r\nBarisan    Sosialis    Assemblymen    have     said\r\n\r\nconfrontation  is a good thing. So we  will  follow\r\n\r\nthem.   We   will  support  them.\"   So   it   only\r\n\r\nsubstantiates our thesis that the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nis  dedicated to destroying our economy, our  plans\r\n\r\nto  improve the welfare of the people, because they\r\n\r\nwant  poverty and chaos in Singapore, so that their\r\n\r\nconfrontation  friends can move in.  They  are  not\r\n\r\nrepresentatives   of  the  various  constituencies.\r\n\r\nMaybe  they come from - I am told. Sir, there  is  a\r\n\r\nplace  called  `Suka Boomi', where the  Chinese  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia   were   slaughtered.  Maybe   they   are\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of that constituency.

Those    who\r\n\r\nmanipulate  the  Barisan  Sosialis  we   know   are\r\n\r\nCommunists. Mr Woodhull has said so, Mr Lim  Shee\r\n\r\nPing  has  admitted it. Mr James  Puthucheary  has\r\n\r\nadmitted  it.  They do not talk about bogeys.  They\r\n\r\nhave  written  down in their statements  that  they\r\n\r\n- the  Barisan  Sosialis  - are  manipulated  by  the\r\n\r\nCommunists. And the Communists cannot help the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nor  any other non-Communist Government to establish\r\n\r\na  prosperous  and  happy  Malaysia  or  Singapore.\r\n\r\nBecause   then   nobody  would  follow   Communism.\r\n\r\nTherefore, they must bring about poverty and  chaos\r\n\r\nto  prepare the way for their revolutionary scheme,\r\n\r\nfor  the  triumph of Communism. For these  reasons,\r\n\r\nSir,  all  this talk about the Budget not  being  a\r\n\r\ngood  Budget, not a Budget that will help Singapore\r\n\r\nto be prosperous. I say, is all a lot of hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nIt is not what they have in their hearts. What they\r\n\r\nwant  is  a  Budget  which  will  help  to  destroy\r\n\r\nSingapore economically so that there will  be  mass\r\n\r\nunemployment. Then they can tell the people. \"There\r\n\r\nyou are. Only the Communist way can offer you a way\r\n\r\nout.  Not  the non-Communist way, not the socialist\r\n\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I conclude, I would like to say that\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis  is not  interested  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget.

And  in  all  this\r\n\r\ncriticism  of  the  Budget  they  are  a  party  of\r\n\r\ntreason,   as  good  Communists  should  be.

The Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nshould not make use of his power to monopolise  the\r\n\r\nradio and the Press. He should not suppress what we\r\n\r\nhave  said.  He has said just now that in  all  our\r\n\r\nspeeches during the Budget debate we have taken the\r\n\r\ncue from the broadcasts from North Kalimantan Radio - \r\n\r\nsince  the  radio has announced that  confrontation\r\n\r\nhas  brought about suffering to Singapore and since\r\n\r\nNorth  Kalimantan  Radio has been broadcasting  the\r\n\r\nsame  thing as we have said here, therefore we have\r\n\r\ntaken the cue from it and have echoed its opinions.\r\n\r\nSince the Minister for Culture has just returned to\r\n\r\nSingapore  by  plane, he has perhaps  neglected  to\r\n\r\nread the speech of his colleague, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance,  in  which  the  Minister  has  said  that\r\n\r\nIndonesian  confrontation  will  bring  about  very\r\n\r\nserious  consequences and far-reaching  effects  on\r\n\r\nSingapore's economy.

We are not out to create trouble from  any\r\n\r\nevil  source.  Since we want peace and  prosperity,\r\n\r\nthat is why we have made such a proposition to  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government. We are not so belligerent as the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  saying that only by arming  can  we  bring\r\n\r\nabout  prosperity.  We  do  not  believe  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s   belligerence  will   bring   peace   and\r\n\r\nprosperity.  We  have already declared  our  policy\r\n\r\nvery clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the financial speech of the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  on  the Four-Year Development Plan  during\r\n\r\nthese  four  years, the Minister quoted  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nfigures.  He  said  that economic  development  has\r\n\r\naccomplished 79 per cent, social development 76 per\r\n\r\ncent, and administrative projects about 79 per cent\r\n\r\nand  so  on and so forth, as though it would appear\r\n\r\nthat  there are really great achievements. But what\r\n\r\nare  the facts? Whenever we do a thing, we must see\r\n\r\nthat  it  produces results. We should not just  say\r\n\r\nthat we have spent so much without any result.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment,  like  one who is responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhousehold,  should be aware of this. It should  see\r\n\r\nthat  when it spends one hundred dollars, it should\r\n\r\nget   the  value  of  what  it  has  spent.  If   a\r\n\r\nhousekeeper spends about 80 per cent, it  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that  he  is  good.  He  must  see  that  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of the members of the family  could  be\r\n\r\nmaintained  by the worth of 80 per cent spent.  If,\r\n\r\non  the contrary, the result is different, then the\r\n\r\nhouseholder should be condemned for the foolish act\r\n\r\nof  spending  money without getting its  worth.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,   the  P.A.P. have  always  been  praising\r\n\r\nthemselves.  The P.A.P. have always  been  praising\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. That is why the Minister for Culture has\r\n\r\npraised  the  Minister for Finance. Of course,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance can claim himself  to  be  an\r\n\r\neconomist, as though to make people believe that he\r\n\r\nis   a  far-sighted  economist  and  a  far-sighted\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance. But we would ask,  what  are\r\n\r\nthe  results of the Four-Year Development Plan? Has\r\n\r\nit  brought  good  results to the people?  Has  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of  the people been improved?  To  what\r\n\r\nextent   has   the   unemployment  situation   been\r\n\r\nimproved?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1961 the Government put up the Four-Year Development Plan. At that time they said that the main purpose of the Plan was to encourage private investment to create more employment opportunities. If there were a high rate of industrialisation, then you would be able to\r\n\r\nabsorb  $600  million  worth  of  investment,  they\r\n\r\nclaimed.  Thus  you would be able  to  provide  new\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities for about 30,000 to 40,000\r\n\r\npeople.  I  would  like  to ask  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance this: how much private investment up to now\r\n\r\nhave  the  Government attracted? What  is  the  sum\r\n\r\ntotal? How many jobs have the Government been  able\r\n\r\nto  afford  to  those unemployed youths?  A  little\r\n\r\nwhile  ago  the  Minister for Culture  has  himself\r\n\r\nadmitted  that  there is poverty, unemployment  and\r\n\r\neconomic  depression in, Singapore. We  would  ask,\r\n\r\nduring the P.A.P. four-year rule whether the number\r\n\r\nof  unemployed  people has increased or  decreased.\r\n\r\nThe   P.A.P. has  all  along  been  putting   out\r\n\r\npropaganda.  Now,  if  the Government  have  really\r\n\r\nachieved any results in this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfield,  how  is it that they dare not  publish  the\r\n\r\nfigures?  In this Budget statement we can only  see\r\n\r\nthe number of buildings, factories and houses built\r\n\r\n- how  many acres of land have been allotted and  so\r\n\r\non. During these four years we can only see figures\r\n\r\nrelating to these few things. Since we see  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers that certain factories have already been\r\n\r\nin  operation for such a long time, now,  how  many\r\n\r\npeople  have  been employed in these factories  and\r\n\r\nhow  good  is  our economy? Since my colleague  has\r\n\r\nspoken on many other things, I would not like to go\r\n\r\nfurther  into  them. The facts are  before  us.  No\r\n\r\nmatter  how the P.A.P. try to claim that they  want\r\n\r\nto  attract  foreign investment,  in  actual  fact,\r\n\r\nthere  is no such result as claimed by them. It  is\r\n\r\nnot their so-called 80 per cent performance; it  is\r\n\r\nnot  their  so-called 80 per cent figure  that  can\r\n\r\ncover the truth of the matter. If we compare actual\r\n\r\nresults, we know that the Government have in  three\r\n\r\nyears completed only a superficial 59 per cent, and\r\n\r\nthree-quarters of the time has been spent. Yet  the\r\n\r\nachievement is only 59 per cent. Then how can  they\r\n\r\nclaim this to be a success? The Government not only\r\n\r\nhave  not  resolved the unemployment situation  but\r\n\r\nthey, on the other hand, have been unable to fulfil\r\n\r\ntheir  responsibilities and duties  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nrural  development,  building of  roads  and  other\r\n\r\nnecessary work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government have talked about helping farmers\r\n\r\nand  fishermen in the rural areas to increase their\r\n\r\nproduction   and   teaching  them   techniques   in\r\n\r\nagriculture and fishing and reducing their costs of\r\n\r\nproduction.   I  would  like  to  ask,   how   much\r\n\r\nproductivity have the Government increased  and  to\r\n\r\nwhat extent has the cost been reduced? There are no\r\n\r\nconcrete figures to show all this. I would like  to\r\n\r\nask  the Government to give the actual figures. The\r\n\r\nlivelihood of the fishermen and the farmers is  day\r\n\r\nby  day  going  down the drain. Some of  them  have\r\n\r\nadvanced  requests which are very  reasonable,  but\r\n\r\nthe  Government are not only not willing to  accept\r\n\r\ntheir  suggestions and views but they  also  ignore\r\n\r\nthem  totally. For instance, fishermen and  farmers\r\n\r\nin Jurong have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvanced certain suggestions to the Government with\r\n\r\na  view  to helping them out of their difficulties.\r\n\r\nBut  have the Government done anything? Again  some\r\n\r\nvillagers  in  the  rural  areas  live  on  poultry\r\n\r\nfarming  and vegetable gardening. In these  places,\r\n\r\ndue  to  the long period of drought, the  villagers\r\n\r\ncannot  get  enough water to wash the  poultry  and\r\n\r\nanimals and there is not enough water to water  the\r\n\r\nvegetable  farms.  As a result, they  suffer  great\r\n\r\nlosses.  But  have  the  Government  so  far   done\r\n\r\nanything  to provide water to these farmers?  There\r\n\r\nhas  not  been  an  increase in the  standpipes  to\r\n\r\nbenefit the farmers. Can the Government boast about\r\n\r\ntheir   achievements  in  this  aspect   of   rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment? The Ministers in the P.A.P. can  only\r\n\r\nstay  in  their  air-conditioned  rooms.  They  are\r\n\r\nunable to appreciate the difficulties and hardships\r\n\r\nof  the  farmers  outside.  That  is  why  in  this\r\n\r\nstatement they can only boast about 7 per  cent  of\r\n\r\nperformance,  and  no  more  than  that,  in  rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   Insofar  as  rural  development   is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  the Government have therefore  achieved\r\n\r\npractically nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Government have been giving a great\r\n\r\ndeal  of  publicity  in the fields  of  health  and\r\n\r\neducation  to  the extent of 20  and  40  per  cent\r\n\r\nrespectively, what have they done in respect of the\r\n\r\nSingapore River? They have done up to only 2.9  per\r\n\r\ncent  according to them. In the building of bridges\r\n\r\nand  construction of roads, they have only achieved\r\n\r\na  20  per cent performance. That is all they  have\r\n\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing they can boast about is housing\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   They   say   that   their    housing\r\n\r\ndevelopment is the best and the highest  in  South-East  Asia. They have done 119 per cent. We do  not\r\n\r\ngo  against the building of houses but our point is\r\n\r\n- you may have a lot of houses built, but there  are\r\n\r\na  lot of poor people who cannot afford to pay  the\r\n\r\nrent. The houses should be for the poor people.  As\r\n\r\na  matter  of  fact, it is the Government  who  are\r\n\r\nreaping  a big harvest from the building of  houses\r\n\r\ninstead of the people enjoying the benefit of  more\r\n\r\nhousing.  So the Government instead of going  ahead\r\n\r\nwith full force with the building of houses, should\r\n\r\nspend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney  in  other respects to improve the livelihood\r\n\r\nof  the people in general. All that they can  boast\r\n\r\nabout now is housing and nothing more; but even  in\r\n\r\nthis respect they have not benefited the people  in\r\n\r\nfact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also see that their Development Budget for\r\n\r\nnext year has only been allocated $16 million,  but\r\n\r\nin   1963  the  Development  Estimates  were   $230\r\n\r\nmillion.  Now,  how is it that  there  is  a  great\r\n\r\ndifference  between  1963  and  1964?   Well,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  explanation  perhaps  is  that   some\r\n\r\ndepartments  in Singapore have been taken  over  by\r\n\r\nthe  Central Government and the rest of it. But  in\r\n\r\nspite of the transfer of certain departments to the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government,  in  any  event,  they  cannot\r\n\r\nexplain  the fact that the estimate for  next  year\r\n\r\nconstitutes one-fifteenth of the estimate for  this\r\n\r\nyear.  From  this, we can see that  in  future  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore will only be able to enjoy very\r\n\r\nmuch  less rights and privileges than they  did  in\r\n\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take the total of $310 million in our\r\n\r\nEstimates for next year, the figure of $30  million\r\n\r\nfor expenditure for Federal departments and the sum\r\n\r\nof  $16 million for Development Estimates, then all\r\n\r\nthat  the people of Singapore will enjoy next  year\r\n\r\nin  respect  of services and rights  will  only  be\r\n\r\nabout  $360  million. If the Development  Estimates\r\n\r\nfor this year are properly and fully utilised, then\r\n\r\nin the course of this year, the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  have been able to enjoy rights and  services\r\n\r\namounting to $600 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if we compare the enjoyment of rights and\r\n\r\nservices this year with that of next year, what  is\r\n\r\nthe  difference? It is more than $240 million.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  about  the burden to be borne by the  people?\r\n\r\nNext  year,  the total burden to be  borne  by  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers in Singapore will amount to $440 million.\r\n\r\nThat  is to say, if we find the sum of $150 million\r\n\r\nin  respect  of State revenue, 60 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\nnational  revenue (i.e., $170 million) and  40  per\r\n\r\ncent of the national revenue, we will get the total\r\n\r\nof $440\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion. This will be the total burden to be  borne\r\n\r\nby  the  taxpayers in Singapore next year. What  is\r\n\r\ntheir  burden this year? Well, it is $450  million.\r\n\r\nSo  there  is  not  much difference  between  those\r\n\r\nfigures.  But  what  a  great difference  there  is\r\n\r\nbetween what we have enjoyed this year and what  we\r\n\r\nshall  enjoy next year! Why? I believe the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  himself only knows it too  well!  And\r\n\r\nthis is the so-called prosperity that Malaysia  has\r\n\r\nbrought about!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from having to contribute $170 million per\r\n\r\nyear  to the Federation and Sarawak, the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore have to endure hardship brought about  by\r\n\r\nthe  economic  confrontation. The trade  depression\r\n\r\nhas  resulted in further unemployment. The  vicious\r\n\r\ncircle  goes  on. And, as admitted by the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Finance   himself,   the   repercussions   of\r\n\r\nconfrontation  are wide and far-reaching.  But  our\r\n\r\npresent  Government  dare  not  face  up  to  their\r\n\r\nresponsibility. Instead, they shift the blame on to\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis. On the other hand, they shed\r\n\r\ncrocodile  tears as if they really care  for  those\r\n\r\nworkers and merchants affected by confrontation. We\r\n\r\nhave said before that what we have done in the past\r\n\r\ncan bear examination by the people. We have a clear\r\n\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. must not hope that the failure of the\r\n\r\nM.C.A. will help them in the future. They must face\r\n\r\nrealities  and try to solve our economic  problems.\r\n\r\nThe Minister for Finance says that the only way  to\r\n\r\nget  out  of our present economic depression  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of Indonesia's confrontation is to give  the\r\n\r\nworkers  affected  some sort  of  training  and  to\r\n\r\nchannel  the  trade capital into industrialisation.\r\n\r\nThese  are  only make-shift measures.  They  cannot\r\n\r\nfundamentally solve our problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see how the Government are going to help\r\n\r\nthose   workers  who  are  affected  by  the  trade\r\n\r\nsuspension.  How  much money  have  the  Government\r\n\r\nprovided  to  the Economic Defence Board,  and  how\r\n\r\nmuch  money have they provided for the building  of\r\n\r\ncommunity centres? Which one is more important  - to\r\n\r\nprotect the interests of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. or to protect the so-called training  of\r\n\r\nworkers  who  are affected by the trade suspension?\r\n\r\nThe  present unemployment problem is serious enough\r\n\r\nand  many more people will be retrenched.  How  are\r\n\r\nthe  Government to find alternative employment  for\r\n\r\nthose  people  who are going to be retrenched?  The\r\n\r\nGovernment say that they want to help the merchants\r\n\r\nto channel their capital into other industries, but\r\n\r\nwe  must remind them that during the course of this\r\n\r\nchannelling  and transformation the merchants  will\r\n\r\nincur  losses, and even after they have  channelled\r\n\r\ntheir capital into industries, will they be able to\r\n\r\nmaintain their industries? The Government hope  for\r\n\r\nsuccess  in  industrialisation because  they  place\r\n\r\nhigh  hopes on the Common Market. Well, success  in\r\n\r\nindustrialisation is still very remote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what will become of the Common Market? It is\r\n\r\na  big  question.  Under the  Malaysia  Agreement,\r\n\r\nSingapore's fiscal and financial control  has  been\r\n\r\ntaken  over  by  the  Central Government  and  many\r\n\r\nthings  will  have to be approved  by  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment,   such   as  the   issue   of   Pioneer\r\n\r\nCertificates; and the Central Government will  have\r\n\r\nthe  right to unify and control taxes and  tariffs.\r\n\r\nOne  of  our  colleagues has just now talked  about\r\n\r\nthis and about competition in the same market; that\r\n\r\nis another problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter if they say that the market is very\r\n\r\nmuch related to the power of consumption. Just look\r\n\r\nat  the  market of Indonesia's one hundred  million\r\n\r\npeople!  What  will  be the future  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nmarket  of ten million people? The outlook is  very\r\n\r\nbleak  indeed.  Blakang  Mati  perhaps  alone  will\r\n\r\nbecome the so-called free trade zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget should have been drafted six months ago - perhaps it was drafted at that time. At that time, there was no confrontation, but now there is confrontation. How can the situation be as what is described in the Budget? If the future income is less than what is\r\n\r\nstated  in the Budget, what will the Government  do\r\n\r\nthen? If\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  future  revenue and expenditure are  different\r\n\r\nfrom  what  the Budget envisages, what will  happen\r\n\r\nthen?  The Government should try to negotiate  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia in order to resolve this problem. We hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. will not act as  agents  for  the\r\n\r\nBritish   imperialists.  They  should   truly   and\r\n\r\nfaithfully,  on behalf of the people of  Singapore,\r\n\r\ntry to resolve the existing difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, at today's sitting we are debating the\r\n\r\nBudget statement for the year 1964.

Please proceed, Inche Awang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): It is always the\r\n\r\ncase  with the Opposition - just as I want to  speak\r\n\r\non the Budget, there is an interruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said just now, the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwho   have  elected  51  representatives  to   this\r\n\r\nAssembly  require guidance and the  Members  should\r\n\r\ncarry  out  the  responsibility of  bringing  about\r\n\r\nbenefits to the people. As we have heard just  now,\r\n\r\nthe Opposition Members spoke on the 1964 Budget  in\r\n\r\na  loud  voice, but without using their brains.  In\r\n\r\nthe 1964 Budget, the figures for 1963 Estimates are\r\n\r\nclearly  shown along with the Estimates  for  1964.\r\n\r\nThey   show  the  expenditure  for  the  State   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  There  is  a  vote  in  excess  of  the\r\n\r\nprovision for 1964 which can be spent, which  means\r\n\r\nthat  the Singapore Government can spend more  than\r\n\r\nwhat   is  provided  in  the  Estimates  for  1963.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  am  surprised  at  the  Opposition's\r\n\r\ncharge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the State of Singapore is bankrupt, and is not\r\n\r\nprogressing  well  in  the  administration  of  the\r\n\r\nState.  I  would much prefer it if the  newspapers,\r\n\r\nradio  or  television could inform  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   of  the  speeches  made  by  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers  in this Assembly as well as of those  made\r\n\r\nby  Government Members. They say that  unemployment\r\n\r\nis  on  the  increase, that rentals  of  flats  are\r\n\r\nexorbitant, that workers have been suppressed,  and\r\n\r\nso  on and so forth. I believe the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nOpposition Members themselves are unemployed.  They\r\n\r\nare not working for the benefit of the workers; nor\r\n\r\nare   they   doing  anything  for  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. The fact is that we are able to  provide\r\n\r\nsufficient  housing  in Singapore  Flats  built  in\r\n\r\nQueenstown   should  be  tangible  proof   of   our\r\n\r\nachievements. The construction of such  flats  will\r\n\r\nmean  employment  for thousands  and  thousands  of\r\n\r\nworkers,  and  that  means more  opportunities  for\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The erection of community centres actually means\r\n\r\nmore  jobs  for  the people. The building  of  more\r\n\r\nschools, as has been explained by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation,  means  that  more  teachers   will   be\r\n\r\nrecruited  and more workers will be in  employment.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  the  more clinics we  build,  the  more\r\n\r\nworkers  we will be able to employ. For cars  which\r\n\r\npark along the roads, we have a car-parking system,\r\n\r\nand  this means employment for the workers who  are\r\n\r\ncalled  \"Car Parking Attendants\". All these  things\r\n\r\nshould  be  enough proof that Singapore is  on  the\r\n\r\nroad  to progress. Nevertheless, for those who  are\r\n\r\nstill  unemployed, means will be found to get  them\r\n\r\nemployment.   Whilst  they  are   unemployed,   the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of Social Welfare gives them  financial\r\n\r\nassistance. This aspect has been dealt with by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Social Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the people of Singapore, as well as the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Malaysia,  know  full  well  that   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government has a definite programme  for\r\n\r\nthe Jurong project. This must necessarily mean that\r\n\r\nmore and more workers will be employed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto ensure the success of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will build railway lines and the number of\r\n\r\nworkers employed on this job will be by the tens of\r\n\r\nhundreds.  The  project  there  is  making   steady\r\n\r\nprogress. We will improve and widen the roads  from\r\n\r\nthe city up to Jurong. This will also mean that  we\r\n\r\nwill   require   more  workers  for  the   project.\r\n\r\nFactories  which will be built at the  Jurong  site\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  employ workers.  Machines  will  be\r\n\r\ninstalled and operated by workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are building a harbour in Jurong which requires workers, and it will be used for ships, sampans and motor-boats. This is a programme which we cannot forget even in our sleep - a programme which no doubt will bring benefit to the people of Singapore. I understand that the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Members in the Opposition wish to  act  on\r\n\r\nthe  orders of others. They have no brains  and  no\r\n\r\nideas  of how to improve the State as well  as  the\r\n\r\nlot of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see what we have achieved during the five\r\n\r\nyears since the P.A.P. came to power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Code can be used for the benefit of\r\n\r\nthe  workers. It is there to prevent employers from\r\n\r\nexploiting the workers. During the last four years,\r\n\r\nwe  have  established  the  Industrial  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt. Originally we had only one Arbitration Court\r\n\r\nbut  we  now have two Industrial Arbitration Courts\r\n\r\nto  safeguard  and  protect the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers from being exploited by the employers,  and\r\n\r\nat  the  same  time  keep a  watchful  eye  on  the\r\n\r\nemployers and the Barisan Sosialis from using  the\r\n\r\nworkers in the interest of their foreign masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period of our government, we have\r\n\r\nestablished  a  Labour Research  Unit  which  is  a\r\n\r\nsection dealing with labour research. In the Labour\r\n\r\nResearch Unit, we have staff to assist workers  who\r\n\r\nneed information, data and advice on the nomination\r\n\r\nof  workers'  representatives to put forward  their\r\n\r\ndemands for consideration by the Arbitration  Court\r\n\r\nfor the benefit of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the Trade Union House is under\r\n\r\nconstruction.  It is being built by our  Government\r\n\r\nnot  for  the purpose of housing the Ministers.  It\r\n\r\nwill be completely equipped so that the workers can\r\n\r\nmake  full  use  of the facilities provided  there.\r\n\r\nLong   before   the  Barisan  Sosialis   Opposition\r\n\r\nidentified  themselves with  the  workers,  we  had\r\n\r\nalready  identified ourselves with and  worked  for\r\n\r\nthe  workers. The Barisan Sosialis help the workers\r\n\r\nonly in theory but we help them by practical means.\r\n\r\nBecause we help the workers by practical means,  we\r\n\r\nare  now  faced with confrontation with  which  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis are associated. We are helping the\r\n\r\nworkers  who are affected by the confrontation.  We\r\n\r\nhave  a  scheme  whereby we pay them  one-third  of\r\n\r\ntheir  income. In other words, workers affected  by\r\n\r\nconfrontation,  which is supported by  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  will  receive from their employers  one-third  of their income and the Government on  their\r\n\r\npart will pay one-third to the workers affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have said just now that the Opposition Members of the Barisan Sosialis only know the workers in theory or in their day-dreams only. However, we know the workers in practice. For that reason, we are able to form the organisation called the N.T.U.C. Workers employed in the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. will fight for the national interest.  For\r\n\r\nthat  reason  we call ourselves \"employees  of  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C.\"  We are fighting for the benefit  of  the\r\n\r\nState  of  Singapore and for the national interest,\r\n\r\nunlike the Barisan Sosialis who style themselves by\r\n\r\nother   names  and  who  fight  for  their  foreign\r\n\r\nmasters,  as  has been explained by  my  colleagues\r\n\r\njust now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me end my speech in this Assembly by giving an object lesson to the numbskull Barisan Sosialis Members. As a result of their misdeeds, the workers have suffered. The Barisan Sosialis are working for the interests of foreign countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, I wish to remind the Barisan Members of  this  point. Do they wish the confrontation  to end,  or  do  they  wish it to go on  indefinitely, which will  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno  doubt affect many workers?

To my mind,\r\n\r\nif  we really want to solve this problem, there  is\r\n\r\nno question of whether you want it to succeed or to\r\n\r\nfail.  The  point is whether we want to  solve  the\r\n\r\ndifferences between Malaysia and Indonesia.  If  we\r\n\r\nwant,  then  what steps are we taking towards  this\r\n\r\nend?   Do  we  want  to  have  peaceful  means   or\r\n\r\nbelligerent means? Do we want to do it by peace  or\r\n\r\nby  force?

And\r\n\r\nthe  reason is simple. In the first place, when the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis  want  to  have  an  intelligent\r\n\r\ndiscussion on financial and economic matters,  they\r\n\r\nmust have their facts right. When they make utterly\r\n\r\nstupid  and  elementary mistakes, then  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  for  me to track through  their  numerous\r\n\r\nidiotic  statements. I will give you  one  example,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, a small matter of tax concession\r\n\r\non  attap  houses. The Member for Paya Lebar  said,\r\n\r\nwell  that is no good because it means huts  roofed\r\n\r\nwith  attap  will get a concession,  but  not  huts\r\n\r\nroofed  with  zinc.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  for   the\r\n\r\npurposes of taxation, huts whether they are  roofed\r\n\r\nwith  attap  or  zinc,  provided  they  are  of   a\r\n\r\ntemporary  nature,  are considered  alike.  So  why\r\n\r\nshould  this  misrepresentation,  misunderstanding,\r\n\r\nlack  of  knowledge on numerous matters of fact  be\r\n\r\nperpetrated  by  elected  representatives  of   the\r\n\r\npeople?  I cannot understand. These are people  who\r\n\r\nare  supposed  to  study  the  law,  administrative\r\n\r\nprocesses  and  not  to make childish  errors  like\r\n\r\nthis.  Now  when  they  come  to  the  question  of\r\n\r\nfigures,  the Budget deals with figures,  how  much\r\n\r\nmoney is spent here and what it represents, but  as\r\n\r\na  socialist the Member does not understand what it\r\n\r\nis all about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example, Mr Speaker, Sir. The Member for\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar says, \"Well, look, this whole  business\r\n\r\nof  how much money we give to the Federation is all\r\n\r\nbad for the Government.\" 40 per cent of the revenue\r\n\r\n- $1l8  million  - correct.  Capital  expenditure  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,   $9.5  million,  correct.   Loan,   $30\r\n\r\nmillion, correct. Then he says, add it all  up  and\r\n\r\nyou  come  to a figure of $171.5 million.  He  says\r\n\r\nthat we give all this away to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a loan is a loan. When you lend money, you\r\n\r\nexpect it to be repaid. And I am quite certain that\r\n\r\nwhen  we  lend $30 million each year to the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories  we will get it back. How can  you  add\r\n\r\nall  these  things? Only people with a kindergarten\r\n\r\ntype of mentality perpetrate this childish error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the subject of loans, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jalan Kayu said that I told a lie when I  said\r\n\r\nthat  Sabah  will take workers from  Singapore.  He\r\n\r\nquotes  a  statement  saying that  Sabah  will  not\r\n\r\nallow, under their immigration laws, anybody coming\r\n\r\nin  unless they get a job of $1,000 a month. So,  I\r\n\r\nam called a liar because of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as a lawyer, you will know that under the Immigration Ordinance there are income limits to any person wanting to go in, but the Minister has powers to exempt entry into the country on certain special grounds, and so far as the $30 million loan is concerned, it is written\r\n\r\ninto  the Constitution that Singapore will  provide\r\n\r\nhalf  the  labour  force employed on  projects  for\r\n\r\nwhich this $30 million is paid out of Singapore. If\r\n\r\nthey want our money, they like our money, then they\r\n\r\nget  our  workmen. If they do not want  our  money,\r\n\r\nthey do not like our workmen, then they do not  get\r\n\r\nour  money.  It  is  as simple as  that,  a  simple\r\n\r\nprocess of logic. The Member for Jalan Kayu, who is\r\n\r\nthe  representative of 30,000 people, cannot follow\r\n\r\nit. So I am not going to go into the details of the\r\n\r\nvarious matters that they have raised because to do\r\n\r\nso would reveal monumental ignorance and ineptitude\r\n\r\nof  the  so-called representatives of Singapore  on\r\n\r\nthe Barisan side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, confrontation, as you know, Mr Speaker, is\r\n\r\nan  important problem here. Here as we are building\r\n\r\nup, going from strength to strength, suddenly there\r\n\r\nis  confrontation.  We  frame  our  Budget  on  our\r\n\r\npolicies  to  meet this particular problem,  and  I\r\n\r\nhave  given  a  fair estimate of how much  national\r\n\r\nincome we lose and how much unemployment there will\r\n\r\nbe.   This   is  based  on  practical  studies   of\r\n\r\nindividual industries of individual factories which\r\n\r\nwill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  affected  and how they will be affected.  These\r\n\r\npeople say that my Estimates are too low. Yet,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, when my colleague, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture, pressed them to it, the Member for  Jurong\r\n\r\nsays,  \"Kalimantan  Utara  says  this.  What  about\r\n\r\nimpeaching the Minister for Finance for saying that\r\n\r\nthe  position is serious?\" Now they cannot have  it\r\n\r\nboth  ways.  The  Member has to  fall  back  on  my\r\n\r\nestimate  to  prove that an adverse  situation  has\r\n\r\narisen  and  in  my  analysis  of  the  effects  of\r\n\r\nconfrontation, I have been completely objective.  I\r\n\r\nhave  never  tried  to  minimise  the  effects   of\r\n\r\nconfrontation nor, on the other hand, to exaggerate\r\n\r\nthem.  I  have  been working on figures,  the  best\r\n\r\navailable  statistics, with a completely  impartial\r\n\r\nmind, because the moment we deceive ourselves, then\r\n\r\nour policy fails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is with the progress of the Development\r\n\r\nPlan.  I  have listened with interest to  what  all\r\n\r\nthese people said where the Plan has fallen behind.\r\n\r\nAll  they  could do is to get figures  and  amounts\r\n\r\nfrom my own Budget statement where I have said,  in\r\n\r\nthis  sector, we have not done well.  There  is  no\r\n\r\npoint  in  hiding this fact, Mr Speaker,  Sir.  We\r\n\r\nhave  to  report to the people. Where we  have  not\r\n\r\ndone well, we say so and we do not need the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis to add to that. My view is that there  are\r\n\r\nminor  sectors and projects which they  could  have\r\n\r\npicked out if they had been well informed and taken\r\n\r\nthe  trouble to find out the facts. But, of course,\r\n\r\nfinding  what  the facts are in this  situation  is\r\n\r\ncompletely beyond their capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the effects of Indonesian confrontation, we\r\n\r\nhave  heard the most fantastic utterances from  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis. The Member for Paya  Lebar  says\r\n\r\nthe  textile  trade will go down by 60  to  70  per\r\n\r\ncent;  banks are suffering at the rate of 30 to  40\r\n\r\nper cent, and so on and so forth. What facts has he\r\n\r\ngot?  What research has he done to establish  these\r\n\r\npercentages? How many of the textile firms  has  he\r\n\r\nvisited?  Has  he inquired how much you  export  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia and how much you sell to Malaysia? Banks?\r\n\r\nHas he gone round to study the amount of bank loans\r\n\r\nthat have been extended\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  Indonesian trade? Obviously this is all bunkum,\r\n\r\nrubbish,  a typical Barisan way of getting  to  the\r\n\r\ntruth.  Any  figure  is good enough  - 60  per  cent\r\n\r\ntextiles,  in spite of the fact that of  our  total\r\n\r\ntextile  trade no more than 12 per cent is exported\r\n\r\nto  Indonesia, and he says 60 to 70 per cent; banks\r\n\r\n30  to  40 per cent. Unemployment, he says  30,000,\r\n\r\nand he says 50,000. All rubbish and idiocy. Be that\r\n\r\nas  it  may, they are entitled to their opinion  if\r\n\r\nthey  say  50,000  people are  unemployed  now  and\r\n\r\nbegging   in   the   streets   as   a   result   of\r\n\r\nconfrontation. From the Singapore point of view, it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  matter. The people are intelligent,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir. As the Chinese saying goes, \"People's\r\n\r\neyes  are as clear as snow\" and they can see  them,\r\n\r\neven  though these half-baked politicians,  running\r\n\r\ndogs  of the Communist Party, I mean, have not  got\r\n\r\ntheir facts right --- [Laughter]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Only\r\n\r\nseven  of them; the eighth man is exempted.

There  is  one  danger,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir.  When  they say  50,000  unemployed,\r\n\r\npeople  starving in Singapore, do they not  realise\r\n\r\nthe amount of damage that they can do to the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore and to the people of Malaysia? Ours is\r\n\r\nan  open society, Mr Speaker, Sir. What is said in\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly is recorded in Hansard and  published\r\n\r\nin the newspapers. Supposing, as will happen, Radio\r\n\r\nIndonesia  gets  hold of these records.  They  will\r\n\r\nbroadcast this - representatives of the people,  the\r\n\r\ngreat  patriots, the people's heroes in the Barisan\r\n\r\nsay  starvation, 50,000 unemployed.  This  will  be\r\n\r\nbroadcast by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenemy.  The Indonesian Government will believe  it.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  the result? The result is they say,  \"All\r\n\r\nright,  we  continue confrontation.  We  beat  them\r\n\r\ndown.\"  These are the people who say they  are  for\r\n\r\nthe  people. My colleague, the Minister for Labour,\r\n\r\nhas  already  quoted from their own Party  journal.\r\n\r\nThey  say, \"We don't take orders from Indonesia  in\r\n\r\nopposing  Malaysia. We did it first, and  then  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Government accepted our policy  as  the\r\n\r\ncorrect one.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Followed them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Followed them. Published in\r\n\r\ntheir own Party journal. What have they got to  say\r\n\r\nto all this? These are the people who say, \"We weep\r\n\r\nfor  the  unemployed. How wicked the P.A.P. is  in\r\n\r\nbringing  about confrontation.\" Here they tell  us.\r\n\r\nIn  their own journal, they boast of the fact  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  the  people who opposed Malaysia.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  their opposition, the Indonesians  were\r\n\r\nconvinced  that Indonesia could break  Malaysia  by\r\n\r\nopposing it with the assistance of renegades inside\r\n\r\nthe country. That is what has happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, further evidence of disloyalty, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\nFurther   evidence  of  treason.  When  they   were\r\n\r\ndiscussing  the impact of Indonesian  confrontation\r\n\r\non  Singapore, the Member for Paya Lebar took great\r\n\r\ndelight  at  the establishment of three free  trade\r\n\r\nzones  in  Indonesia; north in Sabang, Sumatra,  in\r\n\r\nBelawan - four actually; one in Sulawesi and one  in\r\n\r\nJakarta. He took great delight - \"There you are, the\r\n\r\nIndonesians have established free trade zones. What\r\n\r\nis  Singapore  going to do? We will die  unless  we\r\n\r\ncome to terms with them.\" We will die. Does he know\r\n\r\nthat this is a great myth that when you establish a\r\n\r\nfree  port there are certain things that  you  must\r\n\r\ncreate  and  what it costs? If in Sabang  in  North\r\n\r\nSumatra, the Indonesians were really to want a free\r\n\r\nport  in  fact as against a propaganda  free  port,\r\n\r\nthey would have to spend at least $500 million. And\r\n\r\nthey have not got that money. So the representative\r\n\r\nfrom Paya\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLebar  is hoping that Indonesia can break Singapore\r\n\r\nby  establishing four free ports. Then he said  and\r\n\r\nMembers    heard   him,   \"Your   industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme  depends  on the market  of  100  million\r\n\r\nIndonesians, otherwise there is no hope. What is 10\r\n\r\nmillion  Malaysians? 100 million Indonesians.  When\r\n\r\nyou  can  sell to them, then you succeed.\" This  is\r\n\r\nmad  talk.  He never took the trouble to  find  out\r\n\r\nwhat  the  facts are. In 1962 - the  best  year  - we\r\n\r\nexported   something   like   $390   million   from\r\n\r\nSingapore.  What goods did we export, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir? Manufactures? What we produced? Nothing doing.\r\n\r\nIt  was  food. The ports of Sumatra and  Kalimantan\r\n\r\ndepend  on food supplies from Singapore.  The  vast\r\n\r\nmajority  of that is just to feed them. So  far  as\r\n\r\nthe  industrial market is concerned, Indonesia with\r\n\r\n100  million people to buy goods we produce?  I  do\r\n\r\nnot give them more than $20 million a year. Our own\r\n\r\nmarket  in  Malaysia is 100 times larger than  this\r\n\r\n$20 million. Why does he bring up this point,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir?  No foundation in fact,  but  behind\r\n\r\nthis   is  the  wishful  thinking  that  Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation  is going to succeed, to  bring  down\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  to  destroy the P.A.P. My colleague  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture asked them a straightforward\r\n\r\nquestion: \"Do you want confrontation to succeed, or\r\n\r\ndo  you  want confrontation to fail?\" What  is  the\r\n\r\nanswer,  Mr Speaker, Sir? The Member for Thomson,\r\n\r\nfor  whom until now I had respect, fell right  into\r\n\r\nour trap. Stupid man --- [Laughter]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Please do not make personal\r\n\r\nallegations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I never expect this co-operation from\r\n\r\nthe Opposition. He said, \"Do we want peace or war'?\r\n\r\nPlease answer that'?\" Well, I answer. I want peace;\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. wants  peace; Singapore  wants  peace:\r\n\r\nMalaysia wants to settle it by peace. And he  still\r\n\r\nhas  not  answered.  Do you want  confrontation  to\r\n\r\nsucceed or to fail?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker. Sir, I put it to the House that\r\n\r\nthe  position  of the Barisan Sosialis  is  a  very\r\n\r\nsimple  one. They want Singapore to fail,  Malaysia\r\n\r\nto be ruined\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  confrontation.  They want  the  Indonesians  to\r\n\r\nsucceed  in their policy of confrontation to  break\r\n\r\nup  Malaysia. It is obvious. If that is  not  their\r\n\r\npolicy, why do they not say so? A simple answer  to\r\n\r\na simple question. Mr Speaker, Sir, the reason is\r\n\r\nself-evident  other  than  to  their  own   wicked,\r\n\r\nviolent, perverted minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when we say we want to settle it in peace,\r\n\r\nwe are honest about it. We know that, as a military\r\n\r\npower,  Indonesia cannot be laughed at. They  spend\r\n\r\n75  per cent of their budget on the Army, Navy  and\r\n\r\nthe  Air Force. They have more than 450,000  people\r\n\r\nunder arms. They have more than 30 jet bombers  and\r\n\r\nmore  than 90 MIG.21s. This is a formidable  force.\r\n\r\nLuckily their Navy is no good, Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nmean,  if  their  fleet breaks  down,  they  cannot\r\n\r\nrepair  it.  Apart from that, this is  no  laughing\r\n\r\nmatter.  This is a country with a tremendous  punch\r\n\r\nif  it  comes  to  war. We do  not  want  war,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir. Why should we want war? We  want  to\r\n\r\nsettle  it peacefully. But we are not going  to  be\r\n\r\nbullied  and  pushed around into  a  dishonourable\r\n\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Indonesian Government and their leaders\r\n\r\nrealise   and  accept  Malaysia  as   a   fact   of\r\n\r\ninternational life and that they cannot, either by\r\n\r\npeace or by war, destroy Malaysia, then that is the\r\n\r\ntime  they will talk reason. And they are not going\r\n\r\nto talk reason, Mr Speaker, Sir, when they believe\r\n\r\nthey have traitors in our country who can help them\r\n\r\nto  destroy the State, to terrorise the people, and\r\n\r\nto bring this country under their sovereignty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here these people talk about neo-colonialism.\r\n\r\nWhat  do  they mean by neo-colonialism? This  is  a\r\n\r\nsubject which they have discussed for a long  time,\r\n\r\nrepeatedly   saying  that  Malaysia   is   a   neo-colonialist plot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the Budget debate, when my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the Minister for Culture,  embarked  on\r\n\r\nthe  political issues behind the Budget, you called\r\n\r\nhim up repeatedly and said that he should come down\r\n\r\nto  the  financial aspects. And, if I may say  with\r\n\r\nrespect,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  when  the  gentlemen\r\n\r\nopposite   repeatedly  called   Malaysia   a   neo-colonialist plot,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  imperialist instigation, you did not call  them\r\n\r\nto  task. I can understand, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nyou  are trying to be fair. You are a member of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and  therefore  since  we  elected  you  as\r\n\r\nSpeaker  you  consider that you must be  more  than\r\n\r\nfair  to the Opposition. And I think you have  been\r\n\r\nmore than fair to the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the people who say, \"Malaysia is a neo-colonialist plot.\" Why do they say \"Malaysia is a\r\n\r\nneo-colonialist plot\"? What evidence have they got?\r\n\r\nWhat  arguments have they got? Is it  the  British\r\n\r\nbase  here? These people want the British  base  to\r\n\r\nclose  down.  But their predecessors, Mr  Woodhull\r\n\r\nand  Mr  James  Puthucheary, were  on  wining  and\r\n\r\ndining  terms with Lord Selkirk. They assured  Lord\r\n\r\nSelkirk  at  that  eventful  tea-party,  \"We   will\r\n\r\nprotect your bases so long as you allow us to bring\r\n\r\ndown  the  P.A.P.\". These are the  people.  British\r\n\r\nbases?  Who want the British bases here?  They  are\r\n\r\nhere by agreement between the elected Government of\r\n\r\nMalaya and the elected Government of Britain.  Both\r\n\r\nGovernments   see  an  identity  of  interests   in\r\n\r\npreserving British military power here. I  make  no\r\n\r\napologies  for that. As my colleague, the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour, has said, \"Close down British bases and\r\n\r\nyou  are  faced with 450,000 Indonesian troops,  30\r\n\r\njet  bombers,  90 jet fighters.\" And the  Navy,  of\r\n\r\ncourse. Their navy can still move, although  it  is\r\n\r\nnot very efficient. Now, how do you beat them? Will\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  join up and register? Will  they  say\r\n\r\nnow,  \"I  sacrifice  my life to  defend  Malaysia's\r\n\r\nintegrity  against  an imperialist  power  that  is\r\n\r\ntrying  to capture Malaysia by force of arms\"?  Or\r\n\r\ndo  they  think  the Indonesians are so  reasonable\r\n\r\nthat nothing will happen? When the power vacuum  is\r\n\r\nwithdrawn, then Dr Subandrio says, \"Yes,  you  are\r\n\r\nmy friends. I will help you.\" This is mad talk, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, utterly mad talk! And they know  it;\r\n\r\nthey deliberately want a power vacuum to be created\r\n\r\nin  this  territory. I can tell them: any time  the\r\n\r\nelected  Government of Malaysia says,  \"Close  down\r\n\r\nthe British bases\", then at that moment the British\r\n\r\nbases are closed down. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  Malaysia,  as  the  Government   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  is  elected  by  the  people.  If  they\r\n\r\ncampaign  on  the platform of closing down  British\r\n\r\nbases,  and  they form the government in Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  most  important  in  Kuala  Lumpur,  then  the\r\n\r\nBritish  bases must close down. That  has  happened\r\n\r\nbefore.  So  long as you close down British  bases,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be no jobs. They go out. There  is  no\r\n\r\nquestion  of  the British imposing their  bases  on\r\n\r\nthis  country. It is a simple fact of international\r\n\r\npolitics. We find these bases necessary and  useful\r\n\r\nto  us  at  the present moment. In the future  they\r\n\r\nmust  go.  Everyone  agrees  with  that.  And,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, when the bases go, then you have to  build\r\n\r\na big Army, a big Navy and a big Air Force, costing\r\n\r\nnot  hundreds of millions of dollars but  thousands\r\n\r\nof  millions of dollars. Here in this Budget we are\r\n\r\ndevoting   something  like  $40  million   as   our\r\n\r\ncontribution  to the Malaysian defence  forces,  to\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian  Parliament, to  Malaysian  external\r\n\r\naffairs. And the Member says that is to oppress the\r\n\r\npeople!  The trouble with the Barisan is that  they\r\n\r\nthink  they  are  the people. The soldiers  are  to\r\n\r\noppress the people; the soldiers are to oppress the\r\n\r\nBarisan. That is what they think. The police are to\r\n\r\noppress  the people; the police are to oppress  the\r\n\r\nBarisan. The prisons are there for the people;  the\r\n\r\nprisons are there for the Barisan. If that is their\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"people\", I accept that definition in\r\n\r\nthis context. But how on earth can the Barisan,  in\r\n\r\nheaven's  name, claim to speak for the  people?  We\r\n\r\nhad a referendum, and they lost out miserably. They\r\n\r\nwere  not  satisfied;  we had a  general  election.\r\n\r\nTheir   Party  Chairman  said,  \"All   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters will lose their deposits. The P.A.P. will\r\n\r\nbe out, and the Barisan will be in. We will have an\r\n\r\noverwhelming  landslide victory.  The  people  want\r\n\r\nus.\" What happened? The people rejected them and we\r\n\r\nnow  have a miserable crowd in front! How can  they\r\n\r\npresume to speak for the people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, another thing before I\r\n\r\nleave  the  question  of confrontation.  All  these\r\n\r\npeople have said that it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  very  wrong for the Tunku, Tun Razak  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  Kuala  Lumpur  to  scold  Soekarno  and\r\n\r\nSubandrio and that it was wrong to call them  names\r\n\r\nand  burn their images. They said, \"How can we have\r\n\r\na  peaceful settlement if these things happen?\"  So\r\n\r\nthey  criticised the Tunku and Tun Razak. But worse\r\n\r\nthings  are happening in Jakarta. Why do  they  not\r\n\r\nsay  something about them? Why do they not say that\r\n\r\nSoekarno   must  also  not  insult  us,  that   the\r\n\r\nIndonesians must not have anti-Malaysia  riots  and\r\n\r\nburn  the property of the Malaysian Embassy there?\r\n\r\nWhy  do  they not say that? No, Mr Speaker,  Sir.\r\n\r\nWhatever Indonesia says is right; whatever Malaysia\r\n\r\nsays  is wrong. Champions of the people! They  call\r\n\r\nthemselves genuine Malaysian patriots! Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  if this sort of thing happens, say, in a well\r\n\r\nordered  society, these characters could be charged\r\n\r\nwith  treason and put into gaol under the law.  And\r\n\r\nthen   when  we  tell  them  that  they  are  anti-nationals,  they  say, \"How can  that  be?  We  are\r\n\r\npatriots.\" Utter madness! They are out not only  to\r\n\r\nsell  out  the  country, but they  are  not  clever\r\n\r\nenough to disguise their evil design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the effects of confrontation. The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  said that our  economic  defence\r\n\r\nprogramme  to  give two-thirds pay to  the  workers\r\n\r\nlater  on  is very good. The Member for Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nsaid  it. But he said that we must consult the non-P.A.P. unions  and  that  after  all  it  is  only\r\n\r\ndemocratic that we should consult all unions.  Now,\r\n\r\nSir,  if I were a child of six I would believe that\r\n\r\nsort  of nonsense, but I have had enough experience\r\n\r\nin  dealing with the Communist unions.  And  I  say\r\n\r\nthat   if  I  were  mad  enough  to  invite   these\r\n\r\ncharacters  and  ask  them, \"How  do  we  run  this\r\n\r\ndefence scheme?\" I deserve - if I am mad enough  - to\r\n\r\nbe  locked up in Woodbridge. I know that they would\r\n\r\nbe  ganging  up, that they would ask for impossible\r\n\r\nconditions and that they would agitate against  the\r\n\r\nscheme.  I know it. I have had experience  of  this\r\n\r\nthing. In our long political struggle, we know what\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  are. They are  double-talkers.  No\r\n\r\nreliance at all can be placed on their good  faith.\r\n\r\nWe  have  had  clear examples, Mr  Speaker.  These\r\n\r\nchaps always say that workers are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuffering, unemployment is mounting, and so on  and\r\n\r\nso forth. We knew it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960 I asked Messrs. Lim Ching Siong, S. T.\r\n\r\nBani,  Sandra  Woodhull and Fong  Swee  Suan  about\r\n\r\nunemployment  insurance. I  said,  \"Gentlemen,  the\r\n\r\nunemployment  problem is very serious.  Let  us  do\r\n\r\nsomething  about it.\" A practical way  of  reducing\r\n\r\nthe effect of unemployment is to introduce a system\r\n\r\nof unemployment insurance, so that when the workers\r\n\r\nare  unemployed,  they  get  some  income,  not  by\r\n\r\ncourtesy  or by charity, but as of right. You  have\r\n\r\nunemployment   insurance  in  all   countries,   in\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries of the West and  in  countries\r\n\r\nbelonging  to the Communist bloc. You  have  it  in\r\n\r\nHungary,   Russia,  Germany,  Europe,  Scandinavia,\r\n\r\nAmerica  - anywhere.  First, when  the  workers  are\r\n\r\nunemployed, quite often, it is due to no  fault  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own. Unlike the Barisan when they instigated\r\n\r\npeople  to  go on strike, 1,800 workers lost  their\r\n\r\njobs.  The Barisan union called a strike  and  they\r\n\r\nfailed.  [Laughter]  The Member for Jurong  laughed,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker.  He  has asked a question -  how  many\r\n\r\npeople were employed in the pioneer industries?  He\r\n\r\nis  going to get the answer on Saturday. We do  not\r\n\r\nrun  away  from  facts. And when  I  say  that  the\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. - unions  Communist unions  - have  deprived\r\n\r\n1,800  workers  of their jobs, I am going  to  give\r\n\r\nthem  a  list  showing the names of factories,  the\r\n\r\nnumber of workers, when the strikes took place  and\r\n\r\nwhat  happened. I think when he is confronted  with\r\n\r\nthe  facts  he  will  be less  sceptical  and  less\r\n\r\ncheerful  than he is now. They want us  to  consult\r\n\r\nthem  on  how  to  save the country  from  economic\r\n\r\nconfrontation when it is their desire  to  see  the\r\n\r\ncountry  go  down  and  ruined  by  enemy  economic\r\n\r\naction. Yes, Sir, Lim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChing Siong - I have just started and I must end  up -  they would not agree. We said that we would  get\r\n\r\nthe  employers to make a contribution and that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  also  make  a  contribution.  We\r\n\r\nasked,  \"Would  the  trade unions  co-operate?\"  We\r\n\r\nreceived  no  co-operation. They did  not  want  an\r\n\r\nunemployment  insurance scheme in  Singapore.  Mind\r\n\r\nyou, we have had several experts who came here  and\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Do not have unemployment insurance.  It  is\r\n\r\ntoo   expensive.\"  But  we  said,  never  mind  the\r\n\r\nexpense, although I am the Finance Minister. But on\r\n\r\nthis  score,  I  said, \"We have a real  problem  to\r\n\r\nmeet.  We  will have unemployment insurance.  Never\r\n\r\nmind  the  expense.  Never mind the  priority.\"  We\r\n\r\nasked,  \"Are  you willing to co-operate?\"  Nothing,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir. They do not want to relieve  the\r\n\r\ndistress  of  the  working  class  because,  as  my\r\n\r\ncolleague said, the more the distress the  stronger\r\n\r\ntheir political influence. So for them to say  that\r\n\r\nwe  should take them into their confidence and  get\r\n\r\nthe  so-called pro-Communist unions  to  work  this\r\n\r\neconomic  defence scheme is a proposal so ludicrous\r\n\r\nthat  I  would not even waste one second to  decide\r\n\r\nwhat I should do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.
