I explained to you, Sir, how the original intention of the\r\n\r\nreferendum  immediately after Hong Lim was to test public opinion as to  whether\r\n\r\nor not it still supported the P.A.P. and, what was more important to the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.     Ministers at that time, to allow the P.A.P. to find  out  the  actual\r\n\r\nstrength  of the various electoral divisions because, if the result  of  certain\r\n\r\ndivisions  came  back showing a heavy majority margin in favour of  the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nthose were the seats that would be considered very \"safe\" seats and those with a\r\n\r\nnot so clear majority margin for the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwould be less \"safe\" seats and those with an uncertain majority margin would  be\r\n\r\nconsidered third-class \"unsafe\" seats. Consequent on that, I also mentioned  the\r\n\r\nfact  that the original intention of the P.A.P. was to pose one question to  the\r\n\r\npeople -   namely,  \"Do  you  support the P.A.P. or  do  you  support  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment?\" and the answer was supposed to come back with a simple yes or no.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some time when there was widespread opposition to the sell-out that we\r\n\r\nhad  exposed, the P.A.P. switched their original intention and decided  to  pose\r\n\r\ntwo  questions  to the people instead. I pointed out that that  switch  occurred\r\n\r\nbefore the National Referendum Bill had its First Reading in the House. At  that\r\n\r\ntime,  Sir,  as I have already said, the intention was to have a snap referendum\r\n\r\nposing two unacceptable questions to the people with complete prohibition of can\r\n\r\nvassing. But since then, the P.A.P. had realised that the posing of two unaccept\r\n\r\nable  questions to the people would result in a certain reaction and  that  reac\r\n\r\ntion  would be translated into the return of blank or uncertain votes. And since\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. did  not like the people to know the exact number  of  those  blank\r\n\r\nvotes,  it was the intention of the P.A.P. not to let them know how they  voted.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the intention was to hide the shame of the P.A.P. from the  eyes  of\r\n\r\nthe people. At that stage of my speech, I was tracing the arguments which appear\r\n\r\nin  column 388 of the Official Report of the Select Committee of 16th May, 1962,\r\n\r\nand I wish to resume from where I left off. I was tracing the arguments that the\r\n\r\nMinisters  gave in defence of not wanting the people to know the truth.  If  you\r\n\r\nwill  remember, Sir, at column 388, the Minister for Home Affairs  gave  various\r\n\r\nexcuses. First of all, he said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...because the result, according to the proposed Schedule, would be declared\r\n\r\ndivision  by  division whereas, as I think I have said earlier in  this  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  the  result o the referendum would be declared for  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>That was the first excuse, Sir. The second excuse given was that the details  of\r\n\r\nthe Form were not in order. Then the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthird excuse given was that it was\r\n\r\na general Referendum Bill. The fourth excuse given was:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The declaration of the result of the poll is an administrative matter, and it\r\n\r\nis for the Superintendent to compile the statement in the form best suited for a\r\n\r\nparticular referendum.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>The  last excuse given by the Minister for Home Affairs was again that it  is  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  Referendum Bill. I asked whether they accepted the principle  that  the\r\n\r\ntruth  and  the result should be clearly presented to the people, and in  column\r\n\r\n389,  the  Minister for Home Affairs again said that it is a general  Referendum\r\n\r\nBill  and  he gave me the assurance \"that whatever form the statement takes,  it\r\n\r\nwill be clear and understandable to the people\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these piddling objections were overcome in spite of the Minister for\r\n\r\nHome Affairs repeating in column 392:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, I personally think it is impossible. In fact, I consulted\r\n\r\nmy  officials  on this matter and they advised against it, because  no  one  can\r\n\r\nanticipate  what type of referendum or what kind of question will  be  posed  in\r\n\r\nfuture, and it is difficult to design a set Form in the Schedule to this Bill.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, all  these  excuses of it being impossible, difficult and unnecessary  and\r\n\r\nleaving  the matter to the Superintendent can be summarised in one neat sentence\r\n\r\nwhich  was used by the Member for Cairnhill, namely, \"It allows flexibility  for\r\n\r\ndishonest  manoeuvres.\"  In fact, Sir, all these excuses  came  to  nothing.  We\r\n\r\naccepted  the  legitimate  excuse of the details  of  the  statement  not  being\r\n\r\ncorrect.  If you will remember, Sir, even you, as Chairman, thought  that  there\r\n\r\nwas no political undercurrent. I refer you to column 391, Sir, where you said:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If that is the only point of difference - I take it there is no political\r\n\r\nundercurrent in this because if there is any political undercurrent, then I -'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>The Minister for Finance then said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I am quite sure that both sides of the House are -'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then you said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'At one. Can I suggest then that possibly instead of saying \"number of ballot\r\n\r\npapers  cast in the affirmative or negative,\" just say \"number of ballot  papers\r\n\r\ncast in respect of each question,\" and then the Member for Anson's amendment  to\r\n\r\nthe amendment to clause 29 will take care of how that is to be worded.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present amendment which I have moved to this clause embodies all the\r\n\r\nsuggestions made in Select Committee. If the Government were really  sincere  in\r\n\r\nthose objections appearing in the pages of the Official Report, then they cannot\r\n\r\nsay  that they do not want to accept our amendment today. But of course we  must\r\n\r\nalways remember that there is in the background this P.A.P. referendum plot - the\r\n\r\nplot  of stealing the votes of the people and calling those votes as \"supporting\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.\". Alt this can be revealed in the words of the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\nWhen we pressed for the result to be known, he said in column 393 - somewhere  in\r\n\r\nthe middle:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...we are absolutely going to give no undertaking on the manner in which the\r\n\r\nresults will be announced.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Of course, he gave his reasons, but they have all been rebutted.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the present Bill clause 29, sub-clause (2) says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The number of such ballot papers shall be included by the Superintendent in\r\n\r\nhis declaration of the result of the referendum.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>I  mentioned  that the word \"included\" was very vague. But, of course,  we  have\r\n\r\nlearnt  since that it was meant to be vague. The fact that I did not  know  that\r\n\r\nthe actual detailed results would not he announced did not show that we were the\r\n\r\nonly people to have been bluffed. I must mention the Straits Times editorial  of\r\n\r\n4th June, 1962. The editorial referred to the Referendum Bill. The last sentence\r\n\r\nof the second paragraph in the third column reads:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'These \"votes\" [that is, the blank and uncertain votes] will be declared by\r\n\r\nthe Superintendent of the referendum in a category of their own.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>That shows, Sir, that even the Straits Times editorial writer was confused;  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  editorial writer did not know the intention  of  the  Government\r\n\r\nreally  was  not to reveal the exact details of the voting of the referendum  to\r\n\r\nthe people. Of course, the true intention is as I will now outline.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer you, Sir, to the Plebeian of 8th June, 1962 (that is our official\r\n\r\nParty Paper), at page 4, col. 6, where I said:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To ensure that no one will even know the exact number of blank and uncertain\r\n\r\nballot  papers, there will be no provision for blank and uncertain votes  to  be\r\n\r\ncounted separately.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have been following Members who have read extracts from\r\n\r\ncertain documents, and I think a line must be drawn somewhere. If, in fact, this\r\n\r\nstatement which is now being read is the Member's own statement, I do not  think\r\n\r\nhe  ought to read it from any document. He should now tell the Assembly what his\r\n\r\nown  view is of the whole matter and not something which he has himself  written\r\n\r\ndown on paper.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will, therefore, not quote from the Plebeian, but instead\r\n\r\ntell  you  the plot of the P.A.P. which has been exposed by us. Sir,  when  they\r\n\r\ntalk  of declaration of the result of the referendum, there was no intention  of\r\n\r\nletting  the people know the exact number of votes that have been cast  for  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. nor the number of votes that are blank, nor the number of votes that  are\r\n\r\nuncertain  or other votes. They intend to mix all the blank and uncertain  votes\r\n\r\nfrom the various divisions, together with the votes supporting the P.A.P. merger\r\n\r\nproposals  and  then in the end make one single announcement  saying,  \"So  many\r\n\r\nhundreds  of  thousands of votes have been cast in favour of the  P.A.P. merger\r\n\r\nproposals.\" In this way, Sir, even if only 10 per cent of the people really vote\r\n\r\nfor the P.A.P. and 90 per cent cast uncertain votes, the P.A.P. will be able  to\r\n\r\nannounce  to the world that 100 per cent of voters have voted in favour  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  merger proposals. Then no one will be able to lodge any  objection  or\r\n\r\ncomplaint  of unfairness because of lack of evidence, because nobody  will  know\r\n\r\nthe true state of affairs and also because nobody will know how many blank votes\r\n\r\nthere actually are.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This explains why the perfectly legitimate amendment moved by me to introduce\r\n\r\na  Form  in  the  Schedule for a statement of the results of the referendum  was\r\n\r\nrejected by the Government.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nSir, in any election, there is a statement of the poll after the counting of the\r\n\r\nballots.  There  is  such a form - Form Election 17 - in the  Singapore  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly Elections Ordinance (Chapter 53). There are similar forms for  a  statement  of  the  results of the poll in other countries. And any  government  with\r\n\r\nnothing  to  hide need have no fear about publishing the results after  counting\r\n\r\nthe  ballots. In fact, as I have already indicated, it is the duty of all honest\r\n\r\ngovernments to disclose everything there is to disclose to the scrutiny  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  In  this  amendment, we merely ask for a statement to  show  the  exact\r\n\r\nnumber of votes supporting propositions A, B, C or D; the number of blank votes;\r\n\r\nthe  number of uncertain votes; and the number of tendered votes. The people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore have the right to know the true position - good or bad, favourable or\r\n\r\notherwise - so  that  anyone dissatisfied with the results of the  referendum  can\r\n\r\nproceed  to  petition the Referendum Judge against the result of the  poll.  Now\r\n\r\nthere is provision for referendum petitions, but the true and honest results  of\r\n\r\nthe  count will be kept secret - conveniently kept secret-so that no one  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  complain to the Referendum Judge for lack of evidence. And, with  this\r\n\r\nprovision - the  discovery that came after nights of secret meetings  with  Machiavelli - the P.A.P. Ministers are now satisfied that the loophole of blank votes is\r\n\r\nplugged.  The  arguments put forward by the Ministers in Select  Committee  only\r\n\r\nshow the Fascist thinking of their whole makeup.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance under pressure had to say that he would not be wil ling to reveal the manner in which the results would be announced. When we\r\n\r\npressed  him further, he said that he would not only not reveal the  results  of\r\n\r\nthe voting but also reserve the right to disclose or not to disclose the results\r\n\r\nof  the  voting.  I  refer  you, Sir, to col. 471  [Official  Report  of  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee of 17th May, 1962], where you said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The point made by the Minister for Finance is that the Government, I think,\r\n\r\nreserves to itself the right either to disclose or not to disclose the number of\r\n\r\nuncertain and unmarked votes. That is a fair statement of what the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance says. That is all.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nAnd  the Minister for Finance heartily agreed. He said, \"Yes\". No Government  if\r\n\r\nit  calls itself democratic will ever reserve to itself the right to disclose or\r\n\r\nnot to disclose the result of the voting. Only dictators will do that. This is a\r\n\r\nconcrete  example of the Fascist streak in our Ministers. And yet  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Health and Law had earlier on said - on the first day, I think - that he wanted\r\n\r\nto base our Referendum Bill on the general parliamentary Practice of the British\r\n\r\nsystem. Which British system ever says that the government reserves its right to\r\n\r\ndisclose or not to disclose? Which British system says that the results  of  the\r\n\r\nvoting  must  not  be  disclosed  to the people?  Can  the  Minister  quote  any\r\n\r\nprecedent?  Can he give any example of such a state of affairs? I  see  that  he\r\n\r\ncannot even answer. He cannot even look up, because -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. M.

May\r\n\r\nI  quote you again, Sir, on page 3, paragraph 3 [col. 70]? The Minister at  that\r\n\r\ntime  was talking about amendments moved by the Opposition.

What I want to say now is  that\r\n\r\ndemocracy does not mean that everybody must make a noise.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also heard the arguments from Members of the Opposition, especially\r\n\r\nthe  Members of the Barisan Sosialis. It would appear that the argument of every\r\n\r\nMember  is the same. They are just like repeating gramophones, so much  so  that\r\n\r\nmany  people would not even turn to look at the newspapers. That was why I  said\r\n\r\njust now that  I would not add too much to that.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown mentioned at the meeting of Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries  that  there was a secret discussion between the  Parliamentary  Secretaries\r\n\r\nand the Prime Minister relating to certain safe seats. That is  why  I\r\n\r\navail myself of this opportunity to tell the House something of that. Of course,\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister used to have an exchange of views with  the  Ministers  and\r\n\r\nsometimes  with the Parliamentary Secretaries. Sometimes we had  a  cup  of  tea\r\n\r\ntogether  and,  sometimes, when we were hungry, of course, we  would  take  some\r\n\r\nfood.  But  these occasions were termed by those turncoats now  in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  as  certain  secret dealings. That is a most shameful  way  of  saying\r\n\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can all remember that during the Hong Lim by-election those so-called\r\n\r\nheroes opposite us were all P.A.P. Members. They used to say that they were  100\r\n\r\nper  cent loyal to the P.A.P. They also said that the P.A.P. was a 100 per  cent\r\n\r\ngood  and honest Government. In the Hong Lim by-election, the question  we  were\r\n\r\nfaced  with  was whether we should resign because at that time many sections  of\r\n\r\nthe  people were of the opinion that the P.A.P. should resign. But certain other\r\n\r\nsections of the people were of the opinion that we should not resign. The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  then consulted the opinions of all the Parliamentary Secretaries.  You\r\n\r\nall  remember that at that time there was no such concept as Malaysia.  At  that\r\n\r\ntime, the P.A.P. leadership was of the opinion that there was only a meagre hope\r\n\r\nof  merger.  We did not see much possibility of having a merger and  we  thought\r\n\r\nthat  if  we were to continue to govern, it would be difficult for us to justify\r\n\r\nourselves to the people. Everybody understood that. Certain of those people  who\r\n\r\nare  now opposite did not want to resign. I myself also did not know why certain\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries did not want to resign at that time. We also discussed\r\n\r\nat  that time certain things, but they were not relevant to the holding  of  the\r\n\r\nnational  referendum,  because Tunku Abdul Rahman only  mentioned  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nconcept at the foreign correspondents' luncheon. The Parliament gave support  in\r\n\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Hong Lim by-election, we disclosed officially our principles relating to merger, education and labour. But the holding of a national referendum\r\n\r\nwas something that originated later on, and, therefore, it was wrong to say that\r\n\r\nwe were trying to make use of this national referendum for our own purposes. The\r\n\r\nimpression  I  got  from  the  meeting was that  it  was  a  secret  meeting  of\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretaries and the Prime Minister. It  was  held  at  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's Office. I also attended the meeting. The atmosphere was that  certain\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretaries, especially the Member for Queenstown,  were  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion that if the Prime Minister resigned, then the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretaries  should take over the  reins  of  government.

Now he is going into details which will open out a  debate\r\n\r\nwhich is completely irrelevant.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I am not prepared to go into details to disclose the  details\r\n\r\nof  that  meeting. What I want to say is that at that time there was  already  a\r\n\r\nplot  underway to take over the reins of government. Therefore, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown mentioned that we had a meeting for the purpose of finding  out  safe\r\n\r\nseats  for  the  Ministers and to say that this had something  to  do  with  the\r\n\r\nholding of the national referendum. But I will rebut it as nonsense. If what  he\r\n\r\nhad  said  was true, then why from the Anson by-election up to now did he  never\r\n\r\nmention it? Mr Speaker, Sir, the result of this national referendum is based on\r\n\r\none  or  two questions posed to the people and is, of course, different  from  a\r\n\r\ngeneral election. Because during a general election the people may want to elect\r\n\r\nindividuals and may not elect a Party. Because, perhaps, some political  Parties\r\n\r\nmay  be  strong,  then people in certain constituencies may want  to  vote  such\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties.  But others may want to vote individuals.  That  is  why  we\r\n\r\ncannot mix these two issues together. We cannot mix a national referendum with a\r\n\r\ngeneral  election  together.  That  is why the  general  result  of  a  national\r\n\r\nreferendum can reflect generally the views of the general populace.  On  this  I\r\n\r\nwould add that the Barisan Sosialis have been in the habit of accusing us of not\r\n\r\nwilling  to  let  the people have a chance of freedom, i.e.,  to  express  their\r\n\r\nopinions  and  views.  We  should know that everybody here,  including  everyone\r\n\r\noutside, and all political Parties have agreed that we should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  a  merger. Now, if we ask only one question, whether they want  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  merger, then, according to the Barisan, they will say no; then  it  will\r\n\r\nmean there will be no merger. That is why -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon.\r\n\r\nMember  has gone away from the amendment. The amendment merely seeks to  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the  Superintendent  should  make a  declaration  of  the  result  of  the\r\n\r\nreferendum in detail electoral division by electoral division. We have completed\r\n\r\nthe debate on whether there should be a yes or no.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I mentioned that I wanted only to add something more.  I  did\r\n\r\nnot  intend  to carry on with details. The Member for Queenstown a little  while\r\n\r\nago  said  I  mentioned a certain so-called Tripartite Joint Action Council.  We\r\n\r\nnever  thought the Barisan could have been of such stuff without a stand of  its\r\n\r\nown.  Because during the Hong Lim by-election, Mr Ong Eng Guan also  criticised\r\n\r\nthat  the  Liberal  Socialists were a pro-Western,  capitalist  and  colonialist\r\n\r\nParty.  But today, for the purpose of making use of a political Party,  they  do\r\n\r\nnot care whether a Party is pro-capitalist or pro-colonialist. They now want  to\r\n\r\nco-operate with such political Parties. All those who have read stories relating\r\n\r\nto Hitler and Fascists in Germany can understand what is meant by Fascism, it is\r\n\r\nstrange  that the words and phrases used and the meanings in relation  to  those\r\n\r\nphrases  could  only  be found in their dictionaries. If  we  were  Fascists,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  Member  for  Queenstown and the  representatives  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis would not be so free nowadays to hold rallies and conduct meetings  and\r\n\r\nshout here and there. Perhaps they might have vanished without a trace. If  they\r\n\r\nwant  to talk about democracy and if they want to show that they really want  to\r\n\r\npreserve and uphold parliamentary democracy, I believe they will not have  given\r\n\r\naid  secretly  to  students  to  prevent other  students  from  going  into  the\r\n\r\nexamination  centres  to sit for their examination, if that  is  their  kind  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Now, that is irrelevant.

To sum up, I am of the  opinion\r\n\r\nthat the Member for Queenstown is trying to avail himself of this opportunity in\r\n\r\nthis  House to create trouble and to accuse us of using this national referendum\r\n\r\nto  prepare  to  secure  safe seats for Ministers. All this  talk  from  him  is\r\n\r\nnonsense.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, quite frankly I do not understand this amendment. If I  may  read\r\n\r\nit. It says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'to leave out \"declare\" and insert \"announce the result of the voting in\r\n\r\ndetail electoral division by electoral division before he declares\".'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the general effect is that if the amendment is carried, you get this\r\n\r\nposition.  There are 51 electoral divisions in Singapore. One could  reach  this\r\n\r\nposition - 26  divisions  in favour of the proposition, 25 divisions  against  the\r\n\r\nproposition, and yet the votes cast in favour of the proposition in 26 divisions\r\n\r\ncould  be less than those cast in the 25 divisions. And vice versa it could  hap\r\n\r\npen  the  other  way, Mr Speaker. So that you could get the position  where  26\r\n\r\ndivisions favour, from a division point of view, the proposition; yet the number\r\n\r\nof  votes cast in those 26 divisions could be very much less; and the votes cast\r\n\r\nin  the  25 divisions could be very much more. Surely the position is an  absurd\r\n\r\none.  Now, this is a referendum, Mr Speaker, Sir,It is to ascertain  how  many\r\n\r\npeople - counting  heads -   are  for a proposition  and  how  many  are  against  a\r\n\r\nproposition. It may be that in one division 90 per cent of the electorate  might\r\n\r\nbe  against it and only 10 per cent for it. And yet on a count of the  electoral\r\n\r\npopulation throughout Singapore the majority of the population might be for  it,\r\n\r\nso  that  the  exercise  here  is not to ascertain division  by  division  which\r\n\r\ndivision  is in favour of the proposition, but to find out how many more  people\r\n\r\nfavour the proposition\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthan  are  against  it. So on that basis it seems to me, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\neffect  of this amendment could mean that we might get to a situation  where  26\r\n\r\ndivisions are against it and 25 are for it, and yet on votes counted, the result\r\n\r\ncould  be  otherwise.  I  do  not know what the  intention  of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown was - whether the whole purpose of this amendment was merely  to  force\r\n\r\nthe Government into categorising votes. I suppose what he wanted was to know the\r\n\r\nnumber  of blank papers. He wanted a count on that. He wanted to know the number\r\n\r\nof  spoilt papers. He wanted a count on that. He wanted a count on votes  \"for\".\r\n\r\nHe  wanted  a  count on votes \"against\". But the way he has moved the  amendment\r\n\r\nmerely  brings about a situation where we get the position as I have delineated,\r\n\r\nand that position would be most undesirable.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You will see, Sir, that the P.A.P.

And  those\r\n\r\nnumbers are asked for each electoral division.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the last bit that I read out to you was\r\n\r\nin  direct answer to the query from the Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Education. That is all, Sir.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we heard stories of plots behind this\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill as given by the Member for Queenstown last Friday and also  this\r\n\r\nafternoon,  And  in  view of what he has said about this plot,  this  evil  plot\r\n\r\nbehind  this  Referendum Bill, I think you will permit me a few minutes  to  run\r\n\r\nbriefly  through this so-called plot. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member  for  Queenstown  alleged last Friday and also this afternoon that the threat to  resign  by\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government was not sincere.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, how can he say that this intention to resign was not serious when he, more than anyone of the 13 present Barisan Assemblymen, came kneeling to us\r\n\r\nand  begged us not to resign? Further, all the 38 trade unions of the SATU group\r\n\r\nappealed  through the Press and their couriers to persuade us not to resign.  If\r\n\r\nthe  threat  was not real or serious, then why all this bother? All  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntraitors now in the Barisan Sosialis said, with one voice at that time, that  we\r\n\r\nas  a Government should ignore public opinion. They said that so long as we were\r\n\r\nworking  sincerely  for  the  people we should  proceed  with  the  business  of\r\n\r\ngovernment  in spite of some dissatisfaction expressed by the people because  of\r\n\r\nmalicious  rumour and unfounded criticisms spread by our opposition.  They  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  people would understand in time that what we were doing was  for  the\r\n\r\nlong-term  interests of the people. So, far from our being afraid to go  to  the\r\n\r\npeople, the 13 traitors now in the Barisan Sosialis were genuinely anxious about\r\n\r\ntheir  political future and fearful of the prospects of losing their  status  as\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries and Assemblymen.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Queenstown alleged that if the number of\r\n\r\nunmarked  and  uncertain ballot papers is not announced, then the referendum  is\r\n\r\nimproper.  The  Member  for Queenstown is only specifically  interested  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  unmarked  and  uncertain ballot papers.  Obviously  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  has failed to notice that it has been specifically provided  for  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  that  unmarked or uncertain ballot papers shall be deemed  to  be  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of the decision of the Assembly on the matter referred for the  referen\r\n\r\ndum.  This is found in clause 29. It is also provided that the number of  ballot\r\n\r\npapers  shall be included by the Superintendent in his declaration of the result\r\n\r\nof the referendum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are in black and white for the public to see. There is nothing\r\n\r\nsecret about it.

If there  are  people  who  still\r\n\r\npersist in casting their votes in this manner, then they should be well aware of\r\n\r\nthe way in which their votes will be treated. Where is the unfairness of it all?\r\n\r\nHow can the Member for Queenstown call these Fascist methods?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in calling us Fascists, the Member for Queenstown evidently\r\n\r\nunderstands very little of the behaviour of Fascists. I have no doubt that in  a\r\n\r\nvery  short while he will swallow back this term, just as he had swallowed  back\r\n\r\nthe  term \"neo-colonialist\". We have not heard the term \"neo-colonialist\"  being\r\n\r\nused  again.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, the Fascists do not do things in  public.  They\r\n\r\nbelieve  in  secret trials. The Fascists are not in the habit  of  talking  with\r\n\r\ntheir  opponents across the Floor. They have a simple way of dealing with  their\r\n\r\nopponents, and that is to line up all the opponents against the wall  and  shoot\r\n\r\nthem.  How  can the Member for Queenstown call us Fascists when we  are  talking\r\n\r\nwith  them  across the Floor? And which shows how democratic we are! We  allowed\r\n\r\nhim to speak for 7\u00bd hours in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> You\r\n\r\ncannot stop him.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Then the Member for Queenstown talked of the Council of\r\n\r\nJoint  Action. Mr Speaker, it is quite typical of the pro-Communists  to  steal\r\n\r\nthe  name  of  some respectable organisation and claim it to be their  own.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, probably you are well aware that the Council of Joint Action,  20\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  was a combination of progressive elements and progressive  parties.\r\n\r\nThey had one specific objective, and that was to fight against colonialism.  But\r\n\r\ntoday we see the kind of Council of Joint Action that they have. They have among\r\n\r\nthem  a  pro-colonial Right-wing reactionary Party, in the name of the  Liberal-Socialists. But it is quite common, Mr Speaker, Sir, for all pro-Communists  or\r\n\r\nphoney  socialists  to sacrifice whatever lofty principles  they  have  for  the\r\n\r\nultimate interests, even to the extent of joining up with a pro-colonial  Right-wing reactionary Party.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have said that there is a difference between a national\r\n\r\nreferendum and a general election. In the case of a national referendum, no\r\n\r\ncandidates are involved; only national issues are concerned. In the case of a\r\n\r\ngeneral election, I can see the necessity of announcing the results, division by\r\n\r\ndivision, because there will be several candidates competing with one another in\r\n\r\neach of the electoral divisions. But I fail to see the necessity in the case of\r\n\r\na national referendum to announce the results division by division, because the\r\n\r\nissue involved is a national issue, not an issue concerning any particular elec\r\n\r\ntoral division. It is the total results that count and not the results of each\r\n\r\nparticular division.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the Second Schedule that was designed by the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown.

But I indicated that the fact that the majority of the\r\n\r\ndivisions - shall  we say, the majority of the divisions are  against  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper; but the majority of the citizens are in favour - are  against the White Paper would have no legal effect. It is a  question  of\r\n\r\nthe majority of the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of having the results\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- and this would concern, shall we say, Sir, the major Parties in this House\r\n\r\nrather  than  those  of us at the back of this side of the  House - is  that  'lie\r\n\r\nGovernment  being in possession through its Superintendent of information  which\r\n\r\nwould  indicate the divisions which may be favourable to them, such  information\r\n\r\nshould  also be available to the other major Parties who may wish to plan  their\r\n\r\nelection campaigns which would be coming after the polling with reference to the\r\n\r\nmerger  referendum. That seems to me the entire issue, Sir. It is not  vital  in\r\n\r\nitself.  What is important, Sir, is that you have referred us, and permitted  us\r\n\r\nto refer, to the Second Schedule. Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs, whose\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\npathetic  ineptitude was so classically displayed in this Assembly last  Friday\r\n\r\nafternoon,  has  forgotten  that  before  the  Select  Committee,  he  protested\r\n\r\nvehemently  that  that Schedule was inappropriate because  this  was  a  general\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill. Today he puts up another equally pathetic effort at saying that\r\n\r\nit  is  not  applicable because he wants to delete one line and insert  another.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would  like  to  say  this. I am not associated  with  this  particular\r\n\r\nSchedule. If the Government were to indicate that they accept an amendment  to\r\n\r\nthe  amendment  to  delete \"Number of tendered ballot papers\" and  therefore  to\r\n\r\nsubstitute  \"Number of rejected ballot papers\", I would be very happy  to  offer\r\n\r\nsuch  an  amendment.  Only,  Sir, by now I will not  waste  my  breath  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. I know their dishonesty. I know their lack of sincerity. I know that\r\n\r\nthey merely want to find specious excuses. If that is all they wanted they could\r\n\r\nhave done it themselves. That is just a piece of humbug - another smokescreen.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has now been made clear that it is not acceptable to the Government to\r\n\r\nhave  the  unmarked  or  uncertain ballot papers numbered.  They  say  that  the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent  must be allowed to count them surreptitiously and  add  them  to\r\n\r\nwhichever  he  thinks  is the Assembly decision. It is a curious  position.  The\r\n\r\nSuperintendent  is  the one who is to decide where all the blank  and  uncertain\r\n\r\nballot  papers go; no doubt under the direct controlled supervision and guidance\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister.  Are we to understand that in this particular  instance  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  have his finger in the pie and tell him where  to  attach  those\r\n\r\nblank and uncertain votes?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tells you, \"How can I be a Fascist?\" In the classic words of the gentleman\r\n\r\nwho  says  that his Party is not racialist, our Prime Minister, and who publicly\r\n\r\nin  the  University  said.  \"If I were a Fascist, the final  solution  to  David\r\n\r\nMarshall  would have been achieved long ago.\"; using, Sir, the classic words  of\r\n\r\nHitler  with  reference  to the Jewish people. That is the  non-racialist  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  who complains of others being racialist. Now the answer to  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister is not that\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhe has a kind heart. The very fact that he can conceive of so obscene a parallel\r\n\r\nand  would wish to lust for Hitler's powers is an indication that he is far from\r\n\r\nhaving  any  decency  left. It is merely that he has a  lack  of  power  because\r\n\r\nSingapore  still  works  under a constitution, and under that  constitution  the\r\n\r\npowers  of the Prime Minister and of our pathetic Minister for Home Affairs  are\r\n\r\nlimited - not  too  limited,  but limited in certain respects.  They  cannot,  for\r\n\r\nexample, prevent us in the Opposition, if there are two of us who want to debate\r\n\r\na motion, from debating a motion. It is no thanks to their kind hearts that they\r\n\r\nare  listening to us here. They are compelled to, by virtue of the constitution.\r\n\r\nBut I want you to notice when he says, \"How can we be Fascists? The people know,\r\n\r\nand if they insist that they want to cast blank votes, they know in advance that\r\n\r\nthey will count for the Government P.A.P.\r\n\r\nproposals. So how can we be Fascists?\"\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, if the P.A.P. pass a law that anybody who  wears  spectacles\r\n\r\nshall  go to prison. Does that make it legitimate, a democratic law that  people\r\n\r\nshall  not  wear spectacles because they know in advance that if  they  do  wear\r\n\r\nspectacles, they will go to prison? That makes them no Fascists. If they pass  a\r\n\r\nlaw  to  say that anybody who worships in a Confucian temple shall go to prison.\r\n\r\nIs that any the less Fascist because people know in advance that they will go to\r\n\r\nprison  if  they seek to discharge their obligation to their Maker in accordance\r\n\r\nwith their conscience?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the issue here is not a particular amendment of the Member\r\n\r\nfor Queenstown which has no vital importance. Frankly, I could not care less, as\r\n\r\na  very  minor Party, whether I know the power strength of the different Parties\r\n\r\nin the different divisions or not. I do not think that even if I have the honour\r\n\r\nof being a member of a major Party, I would really care.\r\n\r\nThat is a matter for tacticians. That\r\n\r\nis  a  matter  which  surely  the Front Benches  of  the  Opposition  should  be\r\n\r\nparticularly interested. No, Sir, the importance of this part of the  debate  is\r\n\r\ncentred round the Second Schedule.

Hence  the  absence  of  a\r\n\r\ndirection  to the Superintendent so that it can hide this information  from  the\r\n\r\npublic  and  place  the Ministers in constituencies where the returns  are  most\r\n\r\nfavourable  to the Party, leaving the rest of the Party candidates to  fend  for\r\n\r\nthemselves  in the less favourable areas. I have so often heard him say  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  that  the P.A.P. is doomed and has no following at  all,  having  been\r\n\r\ncompletely eclipsed by the Barisan Sosialis, that it is strange to hear from the\r\n\r\nlips  of the Member for Queenstown himself an admission that there is still  so\r\n\r\nmuch  life in the Party as to make it worth while and possible for this plot  to\r\n\r\nbe sustained by the ruling clique in the Party.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown also asked, how could there be a recount if the\r\n\r\nresults  were not announced electoral division by electoral division before  the\r\n\r\nresult  was declared by the Superintendent? Sir, in the Select Committee on  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  National  Referendum Bill, this point was taken and  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  said  this in column 292, Official Report of the Select Committee  No.  5\r\n\r\ndated 15th of May:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... any recount can only refer to a particular division by virtue of the\r\n\r\npreceding provisions of clause 27.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>The  Member  for  Anson  later moved an amendment to  restrict  the  recount  to\r\n\r\nelectoral divisions only before the Superintendent makes the declaration in case\r\n\r\nthe  counting agent proved to be difficult and demanded a recount of the  entire\r\n\r\n51  electoral  divisions  for  no apparent reason.  The  Member  for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\ndisagreed that there should be an announcement of the result of voting electoral\r\n\r\ndivision  by  electoral division, as counting stations were set up in  the  Bill\r\n\r\neach  embracing a number of electoral divisions, and the Superintendent may want\r\n\r\nto announce the results for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neach  of  the counting stations before declaring the final result of the referendum.

I\r\n\r\nmerely wish to say a few words on the amendment to clause 30.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the Prime Minister once said that blank votes and uncertain\r\n\r\nvotes  would only constitute a negligible percentage. That is not going  to\r\n\r\nbe  necessarily true in the case of a referendum, particularly in the  case\r\n\r\nwhere  the  P.A.P. type of referendum is going to be held. In  the  general\r\n\r\nelections  and  by-elections  in the past it  is  true  that  blank  votes,\r\n\r\nuncertain  votes,  spoilt votes, votes recorded to be declared  void,  were\r\n\r\nnegligible. But in the referendum which the P.A.P. is proposing, where  two\r\n\r\nunacceptable  alternatives are going to be posed, by their  own  admission,\r\n\r\nwhere the people are not going to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nbe  given  their basic right to reject or abstain, the chances are that  the  un\r\n\r\nmarked votes are going to be predominant. Sir, this is not because a voter  does\r\n\r\nnot  want  to  exercise his right of voting for one of the propositions;  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause  he is going to be faced with two propositions that he does not want  to\r\n\r\nchoose from.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I was leading up to the point  to  show\r\n\r\nactually why the Government is objecting to the amendment moved to clause 30, in\r\n\r\neffect, why they are objecting to the Second Schedule.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Second Schedule here is merely to let the people know how many voters\r\n\r\nhave voted for proposition 1, proposition 2 or 3, or what have they, and to show\r\n\r\nhow  many  people  have  put  in unmarked ballot  papers.  The  reason  why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is objecting to this Second Schedule is that they know in their heart\r\n\r\nof hearts -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Have they got any?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - if the referendum is held along the lines they suggest they want\r\n\r\nto hold, the number of votes the Government proposition is going to get is going\r\n\r\nto  be  negligible. Sir, if we take a concrete example, that in  the  event  the\r\n\r\nGovernment are doing what they have already indicated that they will do, if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment proposition - the Government White Paper - gets 10 per cent of the votes,\r\n\r\nand  if the second proposition gets 40 per cent of the votes, and if 50 per cent\r\n\r\nof  the votes are unmarked, then the Government will probably come out and  say,\r\n\r\n\"There  you are, the people of Singapore have supported the White Paper  merger.\r\n\r\n60  per cent of the people have supported it.\" True, 60 per cent as declared  by\r\n\r\nthe  Superintendent. But that 60 per cent will contain only 10 per cent positive\r\n\r\nvotes for the Government proposition and 50 per cent blank votes, not because 50\r\n\r\nper  cent of the people are unable to decide or uncertain to decide, but because\r\n\r\nthey are unwilling to decide between one of two unacceptable propositions. That,\r\n\r\nbriefly, is the reason why the Government is objecting to this Schedule.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government have any decency left, then the natural thing for them to do\r\n\r\nis  to accept this Schedule. If they are confident that the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nin  fact, support the White Paper proposals, if they are confident that all this\r\n\r\ntalk of second-class citizenship, all this talk of unfair merger arrangement  is\r\n\r\nCommunist  talk  and Communist propaganda and there are only 300  Communists - why\r\n\r\nare  they  afraid to accept this amendment? Sir, we are not asking for something\r\n\r\nthat  is  unfair. As I have said, if these men have even a little decency  left,\r\n\r\nthey  have no other alternative than to accept this. And as I have said all that\r\n\r\nthe  Schedule seeks to do is to specify the number of ballot papers issued,  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of ballot papers cast in respect of proposition 1, proposition 2,  etc.,\r\n\r\nthe  number of unmarked ballot papers, the number of uncertain ballot papers and\r\n\r\nthe number of tendered ballot papers.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis fully realise that if the Government want to,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey can push through their merger arrangements irrespective of the views of the\r\n\r\npeople.  But we tell them, Sir, that if they want outwardly to appear to consult\r\n\r\nthe people, then let them consult the people in an honest and sincere way. If it\r\n\r\nis  going  to  be  such that they only get 10 per cent for  the  Government  pro\r\n\r\nposition  and,  in  fact, they want to push through the merger arrangement,  let\r\n\r\nthem  accept the Schedule and say only 10 per cent have voted for the Government\r\n\r\nproposition,  while  40 per cent have voted against it, and  50  per  cent  have\r\n\r\nabstained.  Let them say that, and then show their courage and push through  the\r\n\r\nmerger arrangements. And then, Sir, the people will respect them for showing  at\r\n\r\nleast a little bit of honesty; otherwise what they do is absolutely dishonest.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  have  mentioned the fact that they do not want to discuss this  because\r\n\r\nthey also have in mind the fact that it could serve them as a means to mark  out\r\n\r\nthe  safe  and  unsafe seats. That is not the real intention in this  particular\r\n\r\ncase.  The real intention here is that they just do not want the people to  know\r\n\r\nthe actual number of blank votes and the actual number of uncertain votes, votes\r\n\r\nwhich  indisputably demonstrate that they cannot support the White Paper  merger\r\n\r\nproposals  of  the P.A.P.

I think it is\r\n\r\nabout  time I stopped this reference to the Council of Joint Action.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  that has any relevance to the amendment. I think enough has been said  up\r\n\r\nto now about the Council of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nJoint  Action. There may be other opportunities. So I think, for the purpose  of\r\n\r\nthis debate, enough has been said.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, if I may refer you to column 293 from where I\r\n\r\nstarted my speech on the amendment. Somewhere just below the middle, I asked how\r\n\r\nthey would announce the results, and the Minister for Finance said \"45; 45; 10.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I further pressed him, giving another example, the Minister for Health  and\r\n\r\nLaw  said 48, 47, 5, Yes. In other words, Sir, he was trying to tell us that the\r\n\r\nactual detailed results of the votes in respect of marked votes, unmarked  votes\r\n\r\nor blank votes, or uncertain votes, or votes in support of the White Paper would\r\n\r\nbe  announced. That is a clear implication, Sir; otherwise how can he  give  the\r\n\r\nrespective  figures  of  45, 45, 10 or 48, 47, 5? The implication  is  that  the\r\n\r\ndetailed results would be announced and he was deliberately, I think, trying  to\r\n\r\ndeceive  us  by  saying  that those results would be  announced.  See  what  has\r\n\r\nhappened  today? We countered and accepted the objections - the genuine objections\r\n\r\nof  the unsuitability of the wording and now we have asked for a Schedule  which\r\n\r\nsays \"as near as may be\". In other words, if the Government think the wording is\r\n\r\nincorrect, they can easily amend it to suit the actual conditions, and I am sure\r\n\r\nall  of us would be only too happy to accept the amendment. All we want to  know\r\n\r\nis whether or not they want to accept in principle that the result of the voting\r\n\r\nshould  be divulged to the people in detail, so that everybody will be  able  to\r\n\r\nknow  how many people have voted for the P.A.P., how many have cast blank  votes\r\n\r\nand how many have cast uncertain votes. It is as simple as that.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs has said that the number of votes according\r\n\r\nto clause 29 is known beforehand. Very good, that is what he has just said, Sir.\r\n\r\nA  little  while  back he said that the number of votes, that is,  blank  votes,\r\n\r\nuncertain votes and votes in relation to clause 29, is known beforehand. If that\r\n\r\nis so, they should be known to the people, not only to the Government Ministers.\r\n\r\nThat is all we ask for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I think\r\n\r\nthat  was  a misquotation - a distortion of what I said. I have said the provision\r\n\r\nregarding unmarked and uncertain votes and the way in which these votes will  he\r\n\r\ntreated has been provided for in the Bill, and therefore is known beforehand. It\r\n\r\nis  not  that  the number of blank votes is known beforehand. If the  number  of\r\n\r\nblank  votes is known beforehand, even before the referendum has been conducted,\r\n\r\nI think the Member for Oueenstown must he a prophet.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Member for Thomson has said that a large number\r\n\r\nof  blank votes would arise if the alternatives posed were both unacceptable  to\r\n\r\nthe  people.  I  submit,  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  that  it  is  not  a  question  of\r\n\r\nunacceptable  alternatives but a question of an organised attempt  by  malicious\r\n\r\nrumour and intimidation to influence the voters into casting blank votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, why should the people cast blank votes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Could we reserve that part of the debate until we come to\r\n\r\nclause  29?

It seems to fall\r\n\r\non  deaf ears. The Minister for Home Affairs says the Schedule to clause  30  is\r\n\r\nunacceptable because it provides for the number of tendered ballot papers to  he\r\n\r\ndeclared and it does not provide for the number of rejected ballot papers to  be\r\n\r\ndeclared. I have asked him a very simple question. If I move an amendment  which\r\n\r\nwould remedy that, would the Government accept it? Can we have a simple answer,\r\n\r\nnot a\r\n\r\nP.A.P. corkscrew answer? Can we have an answer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I think either\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson is unable to understand what I have spoken just now or  he\r\n\r\nhas missed the point I have made.

Let us see the motivation behind this new clause. The Minister for Health and Law said, at the bottom of column 102 of the Official Report of the Select Committee on the Singapore Na tional Referendum Bill of 8th May, 1962, that this Bill which we have before the\r\n\r\nHouse  now  is  a general Referendum Bill. And in this particular case,  he  was\r\n\r\nreferring to clause 5, but he was also referring to this as a general Referendum\r\n\r\nBill following on the pattern of the British parliamentary system.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out to you, Sir, that in no place in the British parliamentary\r\n\r\nsystem  is there such a clause called \"a blank paper clause\" which says  that  a\r\n\r\nvoter  who  puts in an unmarked or uncertain paper is deemed to  accept  or  is\r\n\r\nwilling to accept the decision of the Legislative Assembly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish, Sir, to bring your mind back to the historical background in the light\r\n\r\nof  what the Prime Minister said in the Second Reading of the Referendum  Bill.\r\n\r\nI quote, Sir, from the \"Petir\", page -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I refer, Sir, to the revised\r\n\r\ntranscript of Official Report dated 16th March, 1962, page 32 [Vol. 17,  No.  3,\r\n\r\ncol. 285]. There the Prime Minister said in the first paragraph:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, if there was the slightest risk of merger being frustrated and the\r\n\r\ncountry plunged into disaster by the activities of the Communists manipulating a\r\n\r\nreferendum,  let  me  say that it would he criminal folly on  the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to hold a referendum and allow the future of Malaya and Malaysia  to\r\n\r\nbe imperilled.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this very vital passage means that if the P.A.P. merger proposals were\r\n\r\never  in  danger of being rejected, then the P.A.P. would not hold a referendum.\r\n\r\nWhich  again  means, in effect, that in any referendum there  would  be  no  pos\r\n\r\nsibility  of  the P.A.P. losing, and from there we can see the diabolical  plot - the  diabolical P.A.P. referendum plot - as we go into the clauses of  the  Referendum Bill. \r\n\r\nThis little passage also explains, Sir, why the editorial  of  the\r\n\r\nPetir  says  \"Heads we win, tails they lose.\" This little passage also  explains\r\n\r\nwhy  the Prime Minister has repeatedly talked of the inevitability and certainty\r\n\r\nof  merger  and Malaysia before June 1963 or even by the end of 1962, when  even\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku  dare not categorically say that Malaysia is going to be a certainty.\r\n\r\nAnd,  this  explains  also, Sir, why the P.A.P. leaders always  talk  with  such\r\n\r\nimmodest  conviction of certainty, even before a referendum has been held,  even\r\n\r\nbefore the results of the referendum are known. Sir, they can be certain only on\r\n\r\none  condition, and that is the referendum must be so rigged that they know  the\r\n\r\nresult  even before it is held. This involves the plot of this clause  on  blank\r\n\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Sir, in past general elections and by-elections, the number of\r\n\r\nblank  votes only comes to a very small percentage. On this particular  occasion\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. intend not to claim a small percentage of such votes - like  one  per\r\n\r\ncent - but to claim a large percentage of the votes. For example, if only 10  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  the  people vote for the P.A.P. and 90 per cent of them put  in  blank\r\n\r\nvotes, then the P.A.P. intend to take in\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthese 90 per cent blank votes and call them P.A.P. votes. Therefore, the plot of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is to ensure that the people put in blank votes in order  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. can claim them as pro-P.A.P. votes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain, Sir. As we already know by now, the original intention of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. was to pose only one question to the people that requires a simple answer\r\n\r\nof  yes  or  no. Then, when the plot of the merger proposals based on inequality\r\n\r\nwas  exposed, or perhaps through their sixth sense derived from information from\r\n\r\nthe  Special Branch, they realised that their own merger proposals would not  be\r\n\r\nacceptable  to  the people and, therefore, to pose their own  proposals  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  a  one  question  referendum would  amount  to  committing  suicide.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  was  decided  that  a snap referendum  posing  two  unacceptable\r\n\r\nquestions  would be held with complete prohibition of canvassing. That  was  the\r\n\r\nfirst  switch  in plan and it occurred before the First Reading of the  National\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill on 27th November, 1962.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this is to keep you in perspective so that you will follow exactly\r\n\r\nwhat is happening. After this, came this period of indecision and hesitation.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they realised that the people could protest against two unacceptable\r\n\r\nquestions  by  putting in uncertain votes and blank votes. If, in  actual  fact,\r\n\r\nonly 10 per cent of the people vote for the P.A.P. and 90 per cent of the people\r\n\r\nput  in blank and uncertain votes, it would become very difficult for the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nto  claim  that  they have won. Under those circumstances, the original  switch,\r\n\r\nnamely,  the  plot  of a snap referendum with two unacceptable alternatives  and\r\n\r\nwith  no canvassing allowed, would be frustrated. And the solution that occurred\r\n\r\nto them was that since the reaction to two unacceptable alternatives would be to\r\n\r\nput  in  blank and uncertain votes, why then not grab those blank and  uncertain\r\n\r\nvotes and make them P.A.P. votes?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will remember the period of uncertainty that was characterised by\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe  postponement of the Second Reading of the Referendum Bill.  It  was  during\r\n\r\nthis period that the Prime Minister gave his historic answer in the Chinese Chamber  of Commerce. When asked whether the P.A.P. would abide by the result  of  a\r\n\r\nreferendum, his reply was that history would decide. And the fears of the people\r\n\r\nwere  further  heightened  by the fact that on 15th January,  1962,  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading  of the Referendum Bill was postponed for two months. Now, what was  the\r\n\r\nreal  reason  that caused this hesitancy, indecision and doubt in  the  P.A.P.?\r\n\r\nOriginally, it was supposed to have been a perfect plot. It was meant to get the\r\n\r\npeople  to  cast  votes  for the P.A.P. White Paper merger  proposals  as  these\r\n\r\nproposals  were supposed to have been the lesser of the two evils. But realising\r\n\r\nthat  the  reaction to two unacceptable alternatives and two unacceptable  evils\r\n\r\ncould  be  blank votes, the P.A.P. had to make sure that these same blank  votes\r\n\r\nbelonged  to the P.A.P. And having found the answer, they had to make sure  that\r\n\r\nthey did not make another mistake. They had to make sure that they could provide\r\n\r\nall  the  answers. They had to sleep on them and go over them before  they  felt\r\n\r\nconfident  enough to put this blank vote clause into the Bill. After sitting  on\r\n\r\nit  for two months, they finally pounced it on the Legislative Assembly two days\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Second  Reading  of  the  Bill.  And  having  gone  that  far  only\r\n\r\nstrengthened  their determination to ensure that all the blank votes  belong  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government. That is why, although we quoted precedents, although we  argued\r\n\r\nthem  down,  and although they could not produce any more arguments  to  justify\r\n\r\ntheir  blank vote clause, they still refuse to accept our contention that  in  a\r\n\r\nreferendum it should be a case of one question requiring a simple answer of  yes\r\n\r\nor  no and, in fact, it should be the endorsement of what has been passed in the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  that  is, Chyuen Min Fu Chyueh. And that is why also  in  spite  of\r\n\r\ntheir past promises, they still stick on to their new switch, new plan, and  new\r\n\r\nplot. The only snag in this plot is that if they were to announce the result  to\r\n\r\nthe  people in detail, and if the people were to find out that 80 or 90 per cent\r\n\r\nof the votes cast were blank votes,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthen  it would be very difficult for the P.A.P. to claim that the people supported  their  White  Paper  merger proposals. Hence all this unwillingness  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to accept our amendment to the previous clause.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it is their intention to frame and word two alternatives which are\r\n\r\nunacceptable  to  the people - the White Paper proposals and the complete  merger\r\n\r\nproposals of the Penang type or whatever type they can think of. On the one hand\r\n\r\nthey are asking the people of Singapore to accept second-class citizenship,  and\r\n\r\non  the  other hand they are asking half the people of Singapore to  lose  their\r\n\r\ncitizenship  in their so-called Penang type or whatever type of complete  merger\r\n\r\nwhich  is  a complete fabrication of the Opposition stand. In the circumstances,\r\n\r\nit is just like offering the people alternatives of whether they want to be cows\r\n\r\nor  whether they want to be horses. We have previously quoted examples of  dying\r\n\r\nby  hanging or dying by tire, but if that seems to be a bit too severe, I  could\r\n\r\ngive  lighter  examples;  like their asking people whether  they  want  to  take\r\n\r\nsulphuric acid or caustic soda. So many examples can be given to you. Sir. Under\r\n\r\nthose circumstances, when unacceptable alternatives are posed to the people, how\r\n\r\ndo  we expect the voters to react? They may be confused, they may be disgusted,\r\n\r\nand  they  may  show their disgust by making crosses all over the ballot  paper,\r\n\r\ndrawing  birds  or  just  putting in blank votes.  And  now,  according  to  the\r\n\r\nprovision,  if  the  voter throws in such a vote, then that vote  is  deemed  to\r\n\r\nbelong to the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if unacceptable alternatives are offered to the people and the people\r\n\r\nwant to reject these alternatives, how else can they register their protest? If\r\n\r\nthey had the P.A.P. Ministers in front of them, I would not be surprised if they\r\n\r\nspat  at them. But they will be inside the booths and the P.A.P. Ministers  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  there  in front of them. The only logical way for them  to  show  their\r\n\r\nsilent  protest and to register their protest at the injustice done to  them  in\r\n\r\nthe way the questions are posed to them, is either to put in a blank vote or  an\r\n\r\nuncertain vote. Yet, Sir, such disgust by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvoters  is going to mean ironically support for the P.A.P. This only shows  that\r\n\r\nthe real plot of the P.A.P. is to pinch and, as I said, hijack votes in this dis\r\n\r\nhonest  and  unheard  of Referendum Bill, it reminds us of election  rigging  in\r\n\r\nSouth Vietnam and in South Korea, the only difference being that in the case  of\r\n\r\nSouth  Korea and South Vietnam they rigged the election openly without any legal\r\n\r\ncover.  Whereas  in Singapore it is going to be referendum rigging  under  legal\r\n\r\ncover.  That is the only difference between our Prime Minister and Syngman  Rhee\r\n\r\nand Ngo Dinh Diem.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have always boasted that their merger proposals have the support of\r\n\r\nthe  masses.  Then why are they afraid to pose the proposals to the  people  for\r\n\r\nacceptance or rejection? Why introduce this unique clause? It is neither found\r\n\r\nin  the Elections Ordinance nor is it found in any of the election Ordinances of\r\n\r\ncountries  all over the world. Have the P.A.P. no more principles? So  bankrupt\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  to take \"disgust\", \"nonsupport\" and \"protest\"  votes  to  mean\r\n\r\n\"support\"  votes'? Are they so bankrupt of support that even obscene  and  blank\r\n\r\nvotes  are deemed to support the P.A.P.? Is the referendum going to be  a  mere\r\n\r\nritual for the P.A.P. to push through their merger proposals?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course. Sir, as has been stressed vigorously by Members of the Opposition,\r\n\r\nthe  real  reason for this blank paper clause is to convert certain defeat  into\r\n\r\ncertain  victory for the P.A.P. in the referendum. The only thing  is  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. want to steal those votes and are afraid to let people know  the  actual\r\n\r\nnumber of votes they steal.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us also ask, Sir, if it is fair to the voters in this particular clause.\r\n\r\nIn the radio forum we repeatedly stressed that democracy means allowing a person\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity  to  say  'no'. If you pose unacceptable  alternatives  to  the\r\n\r\npeople,  then  you  must allow a person to say 'no' to these unacceptable  alter\r\n\r\nnatives,  otherwise you are actually infringing on the basic  right  of  the  in\r\n\r\ndividual.  Every individual has the right to refuse to answer a question  or  to\r\n\r\nsay 'no' if it is unacceptable to him. But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nnow it looks as if the P.A.P. want to deny the individual the right to say 'no'.\r\n\r\nThey are just afraid and they are assuming that the voter has no mind of his own\r\n\r\nor  that he is either an idiot, a fool or an imbecile, and that only the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncan make up his mind for him.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs have repeatedly said that the referendum is to ascertain the will of the majority of the people. Do you\r\n\r\nthink  a  blank vote will determine the will of the voter? How will blank  votes\r\n\r\ngive a true indication of the majority will of the people? If you really want to\r\n\r\nknow  the will of the people, then the proper and correct thing to do is to make\r\n\r\nsure  that  there is a means for the voter to indicate his views  and  state  of\r\n\r\nmind.  In  which case, if they really want to live up to their words,  then,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  they  would have to go back to clause 5 and accept our  amendment  that\r\n\r\nthere  should  be only one question that requires a simple answer  of  'yes'  or\r\n\r\n'no'.  Sir, I do not intend to quote many precedents. All this. I think, I  will\r\n\r\nleave  to  the  Member for Anson, but I might inform the House that  such  blank\r\n\r\ncrosses  have  never been used by any government to mean support for  Government\r\n\r\nmeasures.  Let  me refer you, Sir, to column 116 of the Official Report  of  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee on the Singapore National Referendum Bill,  No.  3,  8th  May,\r\n\r\n1962, somewhere in the middle and it refers to the New Zealand Military Training\r\n\r\nPoll Act and the operative words here are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If the voter strikes out both lines or fails to strike out one of the lines,\r\n\r\nthe voting paper will he void and his vote will not be recorded.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other words, Sir, if anybody throws in an uncertain or a blank vote it means\r\n\r\nthat he does not support the proposals put down in the ballot paper and his vote\r\n\r\nwill be considered void. Then in the next column 117, the same thing applies  in\r\n\r\nthe New Zealand Licensing Act of 1949. The procedure is as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The voter must strike out two proposals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vote will he recorded in favour of the proposal not struck out.'\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNow, these are the operative words:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If the voter strikes out all or only one or\r\n\r\nnone of the three proposals, the voting paper will he void and his vote will not\r\n\r\nhe recorded.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>All this tells us that uncertain or unmarked votes are considered void votes and\r\n\r\nare  never  meant to support any government proposal. Then, Sir, in  column  338\r\n\r\n[Select Committee on Singapore National Referendum Bill, Official Report No.  5,\r\n\r\n15th  May, 1962] there is the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Act, 1906-36.\r\n\r\nSection 21 (1), Sir, says here:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A ballot paper shall he informal if -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) it is not authenticated by the initials on the back of it;\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) it has no vote marked on it;'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>that is the blank vote, and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(c) it has more than one vote marked on it.';\r\n\r\n<br><br>that is the uncertain vote.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Those are informal ballot papers and they shall he rejected.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this shows that all uncertain and blank votes are not counted as supporting any government proposition. The Member for Anson handed this to me a little\r\n\r\nwhile back and this is The Plebiscite of Western Samoa. I will read out to  you.\r\n\r\nSir,  the direction of voting and the definition of \"informal votes\". In section\r\n\r\n3 it says here:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In all cases the three kinds of votes may be declared informal for the\r\n\r\nreasons outlined in clause 54 (2) which reads as follows:-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"For the purpose of this clause a voting paper shall be deemed to be informal:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) if it does not bear the official mark and there is reasonable cause\r\n\r\nto believe that it was not issued by the Presiding Officer, or\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) if anything not authorised by this Order is written or marked thereon by which the voter can he identified, or [and this is the operative\r\n\r\nparagraph]\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) if it does not clearly indicate whether the voter is in favour or is not\r\n\r\nin favour of at least one of the proposals.\".'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other  words,  Sir,  if  the voter says he cannot  accept  any  one  of  the\r\n\r\nproposals, then his vote will be considered informal or void or rejected.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have to repeat, Sir, that this clause shows very clearly the Fascist\r\n\r\ntrend  that  is  in the P.A.P. All the answer they have been  able  to  give  in\r\n\r\njustification of this clause is that it will prevent the mounting of a  campaign\r\n\r\nby  the  Communists against the P.A.P. White Paper merger proposals.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  I  need answer that again, because I already answered that  when  we  dis\r\n\r\ncussed clause 5 but the P.A.P. rejoinder the Minister for Finance and the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  often give is that blank votes will still allow freedom of  choice  in\r\n\r\nthat  the voter can choose the alternatives posed to them. In other words,  when\r\n\r\nthere are two unacceptable alternatives posed to the voter, the voter still  has\r\n\r\nchoice.  I  do  not  know what argument that is. If it is a case  of  acceptable\r\n\r\nalternatives, then there is a choice; but if both alternatives are unacceptable,\r\n\r\nthen  where  is the choice? If I were to say that if the voter is offered,  say,\r\n\r\nbee-hoon or mee or kwayteow, then all these are acceptable alternatives to  the\r\n\r\nvoter;  but if the voter is offered drain water or something not good  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Health and Law, then the voter is not expected to choose  any  of\r\n\r\nthem.  Those  alternatives are unacceptable alternatives, and the only  way  the\r\n\r\nvoter  can  show  his disgust will be to put in a blank paper. Sir,  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister the other evening said posing alternatives to the people would be\r\n\r\nthe  same  as  offering different types of drinks to the voter. But  as  I  have\r\n\r\nalready indicated in Select Committee, when the P.A.P. offers a drink, they  do\r\n\r\nnot  offer  you  coffee, tea, cocoa, ovaltine, but they offer  you  a  drink  by\r\n\r\nholding  your head under salt water. Under those circumstances, the  only  drink\r\n\r\nthe voter can take will be salt water. So where is the choice?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have previously mentioned the danger to parliamentary democracy. I have\r\n\r\nalso  quoted from the proceedings of the Commonwealth Parliamentary meetings  in\r\n\r\nLondon.  They talked of the failure of the human material in the maintenance  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  I do not need to go back on that, but merely to point out  that  the\r\n\r\nfailure of the parliamentary\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsystem is not due to the so-called Communist bogey which  they  al\r\n\r\nways conjure up, but to the Fascists who pose as democrats in the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all the people of Singapore today are literally up in arms against the\r\n\r\nundemocratic, unjust and unfair Referendum Bill and the butt of their  objection\r\n\r\nis this blank paper clause. All the Opposition Parties - the Workers' Party, the\r\n\r\nUnited  People's  Party  and  ourselves - are against  it.  Outside,  the  Liberal\r\n\r\nSocialists,  Party Raakyat and the United Democratic Party are also against  it.\r\n\r\nEven  the  S.P.A., the constant ally of the P.A.P. and the good  Samaritan  that\r\n\r\nkeep  the P.A.P. alive by always voting with them on important issues,  have  to\r\n\r\nconsider  public opinion and side with us against the P.A.P. on  this  important\r\n\r\nclause.  A lot has been spoken about undemocratic and unconstitutional behaviour\r\n\r\nand  action, but I want to stress that being in power and in Government does not\r\n\r\nmake the P.A.P. constitutional when they misuse and abuse their powers to commit\r\n\r\nunconstitutional acts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has been forced to admit that this clause is not based on constitutional or legal principles, and if the P.A.P. were to pass a\r\n\r\nlaw  based on unconstitutional and illegal principles, it would not render their\r\n\r\naction, taken under cover of such law, constitutional or genuinely legal.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You are saying that not legal means illegal.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let us remind the Minister for Health and Law, who is such\r\n\r\na  legal  luminary,  that Hitler also made the murder of  millions  of  Jews  in\r\n\r\nGermany  \"legal\", and in Europe, but such a legal cover for his unconstitutional\r\n\r\nact  did  not make him a democrat, and did not make him a constitutional leader.\r\n\r\nIt  only showed him up as a Fascist and he deserved his fate in the end.

The Prime Minister at that time was a great believer in democracy.\r\n\r\nHe  put  up  that pretence all right. He deceived many people,  and  all  of  us\r\n\r\nthought  he  was  really going to fight for the liberty and the  rights  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. This is what he said in the first paragraph of column 60:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If you believe in democracy, you must believe in it unconditionally. [Very\r\n\r\nbrave words, Sir.] If you believe that men should he free, then they should  have\r\n\r\nthe  right of free association, of free speech, of free publication. Then no law\r\n\r\nshould permit those\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- democratic processes to he set at naught, and no excuse, whether of security,\r\n\r\ninconvenience to the traffic, or inconvenience to police officers, should  allow\r\n\r\na  Government to he deterred from doing what it knows to be right, and  what  it\r\n\r\nmust know to be right.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Ministers of the P.A.P. to pay heed to what the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  only some years ago. Let them live tip to their words which had  given  in\r\n\r\nspiration to many of us in Singapore.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I once told the Prime Minister when there was a possibility of a split in the\r\n\r\nParty that I admired him when he was fighting for the rights of the people and I\r\n\r\nwas  surprised  at the turn he was taking and was leading, and the  way  he  was\r\n\r\ngetting  away from the people. I told him that he was leading us up  the  garden\r\n\r\npath. I wish the Prime Minister\r\n\r\n-  if he is not here, the words can be passed on to him - will remember what  he\r\n\r\nsaid,  all solemn words, and according to the Minister for Labour and Law,  with\r\n\r\nperfect  co-ordination between the brain and the tongue. Let him  think  of  the\r\n\r\nsupport  he  had  from the people at one time. Let him think of the  rights  and\r\n\r\ninterests of the people whom he pretended to serve at one time and at least  not\r\n\r\nlet  his  own name as well as the names of his other Ministers be condemned  and\r\n\r\ncursed for years and generations to come. Because if they want to railroad these\r\n\r\nmerger proposals of theirs by means of this shame and humbug of a referendum, if\r\n\r\nthey want to bamboozle people with this dishonest referendum, if they want to go\r\n\r\nagainst the wishes of the vast majority of the people of Singapore, then\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere can only be one ending for such leaders.

These organisations and the rural organisations,  the  hawkers'\r\n\r\norganisations also strongly protested against this unfair provision made in  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee.  Even  the  Liberal-Socialists and  the  P.M.I.P. in  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee also strongly protested against this unreasonable provision.  But  the\r\n\r\nviews  of  the  majority  of  the people have not  been  heeded  by  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership or ruling clique. Obviously the P.A.P. have thrown the views  of  the\r\n\r\npeople to the wind. The purpose of setting up a Select Committee on the National\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill is to hear the views of the public on the Bill. But their  views\r\n\r\nhave  not  been accepted by the P.A.P. On the contrary, they have accepted  only\r\n\r\nthe  views submitted by their colleagues. The views of these few persons  cannot\r\n\r\nreflect the views of the majority of the people of Singapore. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nI therefore say that this clause 29 will decide what basic democratic rights the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore have.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Second Reading debate on this Bill and in the proceedings in the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, the Government was not able to quote examples from any country in the\r\n\r\nworld  which  provides that these blank and uncertain votes are to he  taken  as\r\n\r\nsupport for the Government. The Government has cited examples of referenda  held\r\n\r\nin  New  Zealand, Australia, and Jamaica. Then why is the Government  afraid  to\r\n\r\naccept the provision that the people have the right to abstain or not to reflect\r\n\r\ntheir  views,  or to say \"no\"? Why cannot the Government cite examples  to  show\r\n\r\nthat uncertain votes should be taken as support for the Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A national referendum was held in Algeria yesterday.

For the record, let me read a news report regarding  the  national\r\n\r\nreferendum. The second paragraph reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The affirmative votes amounted to 1,290,360, and the negative votes 6,510.\r\n\r\nThe rest were rejected votes.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, I can cite many examples to show that no country in the world\r\n\r\nhas  provided  that blank votes should be taken as support for  the  Government.\r\n\r\nAlthough  President De Gaulle is undemocratic and criticised by his people  (the\r\n\r\nbloodshed  over  the past ten years has caused much suffering  to  the  Algerian\r\n\r\npeople),  his Government's national referendum in Algeria is not as undemocratic\r\n\r\nas the P.A.P.'s Referendum Bill.

The last paragraph of the statement as reported in the Nanyang  Siang\r\n\r\nPau on the 2nd July reads:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If the democratic institution in Singapore laces a danger and crisis, this\r\n\r\ncrisis does not come from the P.A.P. It comes from the subversive actions of the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  If  the people do not see clearly this fact, it will  be tragic\r\n\r\nmistake.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now the P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nmade  use  of  this  undemocratic national referendum as a  weapon  against  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and  their activities, but let us see what is meant  by  \"subversive\r\n\r\nactions\".  Let us see what the P.A.P. has said on the definition of  \"subversive\r\n\r\nactivities\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Part I, Volume 2,\r\n\r\nHansard  1956, column 498, the Member for Sembawang, namely the present Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour, said in support of a motion moved by the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat is to condemn the Government for making use of the P.P.S.O.:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'What constitutes subversion? Is militant trade unionism subversion? Are\r\n\r\nsystematic and constitutional efforts to bring about the downfall of colonialism\r\n\r\nand  the  local groups associated with it subversion? Is constitutional  action,\r\n\r\nhowever embarrassing to Government and the colonial powers, subversion?'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this was what they said in 1956 when they were in the\r\n\r\nOpposition. However, the P.A.P. strongly opposed the Fascist methods adopted  by\r\n\r\nthe  Labour Front Government, but today the P.A.P. utilise the same methods used\r\n\r\nby the Labour Front Coalition Government.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, there will be a delegates' conference to be held during this\r\n\r\nweek  by  the  various trade union organisations and other civic  organisations.\r\n\r\nThis  delegates'  conference will discuss the undemocratic  National  Referendum\r\n\r\nBill, especially clause 29.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, at every corner in Singapore, the people and their organisation are rising up to oppose the P.A.P. National Referendum Bill. They have expressed\r\n\r\ntheir  strong  aversion to this undemocratic Bill. They have also  voiced  their\r\n\r\nstrong  opposition to the White Paper merger proposals. The fact that  they  are\r\n\r\nunited in their opposition shows that the present P.A.P. line of action is  more\r\n\r\ndictatorial  and more undemocratic than the Lim Yew Hock regime.  They  are  now\r\n\r\nunited  to  oppose the Government on this Bill. Can you say they are subversive?\r\n\r\nCan you say they are engaged in subversive activities?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we, the Barisan Sosialis, are being described as \"Communists\". But the Council of Joint Action is composed of various political\r\n\r\nParties as well as sonic Right-wing organisations. How then can the Minister for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs  say that all these Right-wing Parties have now become  subversive\r\n\r\nand Communist?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all the arguments advanced by the Government cannot convince\r\n\r\nthe people. We can clearly see that this unprecedented National Referendum\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nBill  as proposed by the P.A.P. Government will infringe on the basic democratic\r\n\r\nrights  of  the people. Since Members or this House are shouting  all  day  long\r\n\r\nabout  upholding the principles of democracy, we must then be united and  oppose\r\n\r\nclause 29 in this Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been debating this Referendum Bill\r\n\r\nfor  several days. Now, I want to talk about the drafting of the Bill. I believe\r\n\r\neverybody  will agree that when we introduce a Bill it will have its  effect  pa\r\n\r\nthe  people.  We must take into account the circumstances of our time.  We  must\r\n\r\nconsider  what  effect  it will have on the people. If we  disregard  all  these\r\n\r\nfactors, then the implementation of the Dill will be completely useless. In this\r\n\r\nBill, the \"Singapore National Referendum Bill\" is put down as the title. This is\r\n\r\nfor  the  purpose  of deciding the subject of merger between Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say that when we were debating the White Paper on\r\n\r\nmerger,  there  was  not a Party in this House which opposed  the  principle  of\r\n\r\nmerger.  The only question to be resolved is the mode and manner of merger.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, however, has been turning round and round and wavering  about\r\n\r\nmerger. Nobody can understand what they have been trying to say.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Queenstown mentioned that in the previous elections\r\n\r\nthe  percentage of void votes was vory small. Since it is so small, why are they\r\n\r\nspending  so  much time trying to win over the small percentage of  void  votes?\r\n\r\nThis is their plot.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their recent propaganda effort, they have been trying to encourage people\r\n\r\neverywhere  to  cast blank votes. Their representatives also  have  gone  from,\r\n\r\nhouse  to house saying that the void or blank votes cannot be regarded as being\r\n\r\nin  support  of  the decision by the House on the White Paper.  Regarding  this\r\n\r\npoint it also explains the effect of the intention on this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we want to have a referendum, we know the reason for these provisions in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.  We  know  there are certain people who, hiding under  the  cloak  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy, are trying to reach another objective.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, here I want to say further. We often find in history that\r\n\r\nsome  people claimed themselves to be the defenders of certain causes. In  fact,\r\n\r\ntheir  aim  was  to  destroy the very thing for which they were  defending.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis are now trying to use this method of deceiving the  people  in\r\n\r\norder to achieve their policy.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I want to talk about the local situation. I feel that the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosilias have been quite worried in the past few days' debate.

For  example,  the  Assembly is used for debate and for  the  drafting  and\r\n\r\npassing of legislation. The building of a house offers shelter and warmth and it\r\n\r\nenables  the people living in it to have a normal life. If you make a chair,  it\r\n\r\nis  clearly for the purpose of sitting. This Referendum Bill should be  regarded\r\n\r\nin  the  light of the use to which it can be put. If this cannot be regarded  as\r\n\r\nso,  then  why  should we waste our time debating this Bill  for  several  days?\r\n\r\n[Interruption] It seems that my speech is annoying the Member for Nee  Soon.  If\r\n\r\nhe is a true political worker, he should have a magnanimous attitude and not the\r\n\r\nattitude  of  a  small  man making all sorts of actions  and  saying  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nunnecessary  words. This will not raise his prestige; it will be a blot  on  his\r\n\r\nown  character. In the course of the debate during the last few  days,  we  have\r\n\r\nseen how they have tried to show themselves as defenders of democracy.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members of the Barisan Sosialis have referred to us as Fascists and that\r\n\r\nour  actions are anti-democratic, if it is true that we are Fascists, then  they\r\n\r\nwould not be so safely seated opposite us now. They would not have been in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  and  they would not have been leading a free life in Singapore  all  this\r\n\r\ntime.  They  are now very free to do whatever they like.

I believe that the situation in  Singapore\r\n\r\nis  not  like  this.  Every  time they try to emphasise  that  there  should  be\r\n\r\ndemocracy, and so on. From my point of view, freedom and democracy is like this.\r\n\r\nA person who claims to enjoy freedom should not interfere with other people. But\r\n\r\nfrom the attitude they have adopted and expressed, if they are real fighters  of\r\n\r\nfreedom,  why  should they make all sorts of noises when a person  is  making  a\r\n\r\nspeech  in  order  to  prevent him from doing so? Is it not  stepping  on  other\r\n\r\npeople's freedom? Why do they not understand the definition of freedom?

I feel very ashamed of the Parliamentary Secretary for having said\r\n\r\nsuch  things.

The blank and\r\n\r\nuncertain votes which are to be regarded as votes in favour of the Government is\r\n\r\nreally  a  joke. Yet the Government is holding on to this provision  as  a  last\r\n\r\nstraw in order to prolong its political life. Mr Mammen, I can clearly tell the\r\n\r\ngoverning  Party that they cannot go about in this way to save their future.  No\r\n\r\nmatter how they try to be obstinate and unreasonable, the end of their political\r\n\r\nlife  is  a  certain  thing. They can never avoid this fate.  We  see  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can provide undemocratic provisions and undemocratic  laws  here  in\r\n\r\nthis  House, but when they go outside they know what they will get. We  are  not\r\n\r\nafraid  of the barbarity and unreasonable actions of the Government. We  in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  want to maintain the decorum and dignity of this House.  We  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  an undemocratic Referendum Bill as it will make a laughing stock of us  in\r\n\r\nthe  eyes  of the people of the world. It is our responsibility to see  that  no\r\n\r\nsuch thing happens in this House.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have already said that the provision to regard\r\n\r\nblank  and  uncertain  votes as votes in support of the  Government  is  a  very\r\n\r\nshameful  provision. We have already said that the Government  is  more  Fascist\r\n\r\nthan the Fascists. But the Party in power dare not face our accusations and they\r\n\r\ncannot reply to them. They can only say that if they were Fascists we would have\r\n\r\nlost our freedom long ago and that I would not be sitting here now.

Mr Mammen, Sir,\r\n\r\nI could quote a few things.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Party in power has come to an impasse and has landed in a pitiful situation. Yet they are still very haughty, and try to show that they are very demo\r\n\r\ncratic.  They pretend that they have given us freedom, and so we are  free.  Mr\r\n\r\nMammen, this is a report in the Nanyang Siang Pau of 18th June. In this report a\r\n\r\nstatement  by Mr Jek Yuen Thong is published in reply to the Barisan  Sosialis.\r\n\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As to the question of Fascists and Fascism, the Barisan Sosialis up to now\r\n\r\nhave  not explained to us. If the P.A.P. is a Fascist Government, why then  have\r\n\r\nthe important big shots of the Barisan Sosialis up to now not\r\n\r\nlost their hair? And they are so free that everyday they could hold rallies  and\r\n\r\ndo  whatever  they like? So facts are more convincing than arguments.  That  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis can carry on all kinds of political activities  clearly  shows\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. is a democratic party. In fact, those in the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nshould  he  thankful to the P.A.P. because in the past they were all  under  the\r\n\r\nprotection of the P.A.P. while carrying out their activities. And certain people\r\n\r\nhad at the request of the P.A.P. been released from prison. I would like to ask:\r\n\r\nwhere  can you find people who having been protected and benefited by  a  Party,\r\n\r\nturn around and accuse it of so many things?'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from this it can be seen that the P.A.P. are unable to amend their ways\r\n\r\nand  turn  back. The P.A.P. are bent on this line of making blank votes  and  un\r\n\r\ncertain votes to be votes in support of the Government. By doing so they deprive\r\n\r\nthe people of their basic democratic rights. Yet they feel proud and haughty  at\r\n\r\nthis  act  and pretend that they are more democratic than the Fascists.  We  can\r\n\r\nonly  see  how pitiful they are. If Hitler were alive, I believe he  would  take\r\n\r\ntuition  from  the P.A.P., because under his undemocratic rule he had  not  done\r\n\r\nsuch things as the P.A.P. is now doing, i.e. depriving the people of their basic\r\n\r\ndemocratic rights by refusing them\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe right to say \"no\".

Please avoid interjections during the speech.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr Mammen, these interruptions were from the Minister for Home Affairs.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not forget that the only democracy we have now has been achieved\r\n\r\nthrough our past struggle. Democracy is not a gift. If we do not insist  on  our\r\n\r\ndemocracy, then in future we may not have a democratic country. If we do not try\r\n\r\nto  achieve independence, eliminate colonialism and to secure safeguards for the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  rights of the people, then we should be doing something  wrong.  Any\r\n\r\ngovernment elected by the people should not do things to deprive the  people  of\r\n\r\nsuch rights and democracy. I hope the Party in power will be very clear in their\r\n\r\nminds  that the little democracy we have today is not a gift from the  Party  in\r\n\r\npower, but is the result of our struggle in the past and we should endeavour  to\r\n\r\nprotect and preserve it.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, whatever problems the P.A.P. have and which they\r\n\r\ncannot  solve, they will lay them at the door of the Communists.  That  is  very\r\n\r\npreposterous and very nonsensical. I quote from the Sin Chew Jit Poh of the 12th\r\n\r\nof  this  month.  Here  is an article by the Political Secretary  to  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, Mr Jek Yuen Thong, taken from his radio broadcast. He said,  \"I  have\r\n\r\nsaid  that the Communists have tried to wreck the national referendum. They want\r\n\r\nto  persuade  the  people to cast blank votes or to prevent  them  from  casting\r\n\r\nvotes.  According  to them, blank votes and uncertain votes should  he  negative\r\n\r\nvotes. They are rather\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnaive  in  their way of thinking. They want to think that the votes of dead  men\r\n\r\nshould be the votes against merger.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, from this quotation of his, we can see the way they argue,\r\n\r\ndistorting the meanings which they should have. They distort our arguments.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  has  never  wanted blank votes  and  uncertain  votes  to  be\r\n\r\nconstrued as against the decision of the Legislative Assembly, but they have dis\r\n\r\ntorted  our  arguments and they have shifted all problems and blame  on  to  the\r\n\r\nCommunists and the people in the Barisan Sosialis. I would say that the  situa\r\n\r\ntion is created by the Party in power and I will also refute the saying that the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis is Communist.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, outside the House there are certain people who have given an\r\n\r\nanalogy  to the Bill. They say this National Referendum Bill is like  a  robbery\r\n\r\nBill.  In  fact, it is truly so because if, say, there are several  robbers  and\r\n\r\nrogues and they are well armed and they want to carry out illegal acts, what can\r\n\r\nthe  people  do against them? The present P.A.P. Government are doing  just  the\r\n\r\nsame  thing. They have all the Government organisations under their control  and\r\n\r\nthey are now carrying out political robbery.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, I have said that if there is a debate today, it is because\r\n\r\nclause  30 has been proposed. The question whether the proposition of a  certain\r\n\r\nclause  is  democratic or not directly affects the voting rights of the  people.\r\n\r\nThe  Government know that if they pose unacceptable questions, the  people  will\r\n\r\nhave  no choice and they will cast blank votes as a show of protest. In  such  a\r\n\r\ncase  the  Government should solve the problem in a proper way and  not  try  to\r\n\r\nblame the Barisan Sosialis as extremists or reactionaries, or to shift the blame\r\n\r\non  to  the  shoulders of the Communists. We hope the Party in power will  think\r\n\r\nproperly and mend their ways and not try to muddle along their present way.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Mammen, Sir, I believe you and I and Members of this House\r\n\r\nhave  clearly listened to all sorts of facts and all sorts of threatening terms.\r\n\r\nThere are people who want to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nresign.

This is not a question of non-democracy. It  is  also\r\n\r\nclear  to  the people of Singapore that there is a minority who will feel  frust\r\n\r\nrated  when  this  National Referendum Bill is accepted by  them.  The  National\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill was drafted by the government. What is the purpose and nature of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill? It is to enable the people to decide their future. Because of  their\r\n\r\nfear  of the National Referendum Bill and because they fear that their interests\r\n\r\nwill  he  endangered  and  their future activities curbed,  the  Opposition  are\r\n\r\ndefiantly  carrying out all sorts of campaigns to stop or block the  passage  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill, if they want to stop the passage of this Bill, what are the  methods\r\n\r\nopen  to  them?  If  they  say they oppose it, that will  not  do,  because  the\r\n\r\nreunification  of  Malaya and Singapore and the concept of  Malaysia  have  been\r\n\r\naccepted by them and they cannot deny this, if they want to oppose this concept,\r\n\r\nthen they will be doing something which is contradictory to what they have said.\r\n\r\nTherefore, they have switched on to the minor points in the Bill to say this is\r\n\r\nnot  democratic and that is not democratic. They say the provision regarding the\r\n\r\nblank votes in the Bill is not democratic. If the blank votes are to he regarded\r\n\r\nin favour of them, then they say it is 100 per cent democratic. If they like it,\r\n\r\nthen  they term it as democratic, if they do not like it, then they term  it  as\r\n\r\nundemocratic. Let me say something about this. The Opposition have been shouting\r\n\r\nabout  democracy all day long. They say the Government has frightened them about\r\n\r\nthis matter and has forced them into a blind alley. They try to make use of this\r\n\r\nAssembly  to  show that the P.A.P. is bad and not worth a cent. They  have  been\r\n\r\nsaying  in  this  House  since  the beginning of this  debate  that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ngovernment is not democratic and that ii has become a Fascist Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Stamford has said that we are a Fascist Government.

They try to make all sorts  of  strange  noises  and\r\n\r\ngestures in order to interrupt me because they fear that I will expose  them  in\r\n\r\nthis House. Now, nobody can tolerate their conduct. They have been accusing  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of being undemocratic this whole afternoon. It is not that I want  to\r\n\r\naccuse them, but this is clearly seen by the people of Singapore. They have been\r\n\r\ntrying  to  propagate their views on the merger question and on this  Bill.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is a tolerant one, if they want to talk, they can carry  on  talking\r\n\r\nand  if  they want to propagate their views, they can do so. But the truth  will\r\n\r\nemerge  one day. We are not afraid of being consumed by fire. Why should  we  be\r\n\r\nafraid?  It is those people who run here and there to carry out their propaganda\r\n\r\nthat are afraid and they are trying to save their political fortunes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, they have said that the P.A.P. Government is not democratic.\r\n\r\nHow  much  democracy  do they have? When they ask the General  Employees  Union,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  controlled by them, to publish a statement, they hope that the  other\r\n\r\ntrade union organisations will also support them. Do they consult the members of\r\n\r\nthe  trade  union  organisations? Their method is to issue a  statement  without\r\n\r\nfirst  consulting  the people. This is their definition of  democracy.  This  is\r\n\r\ntheir  rubber-stamp method. Is this democracy? Is this why  they  say  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  not  democratic and that they are democratic -  more  democratic  than\r\n\r\nother  countries?  It is a matter of regret that we have this present  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they say that the provision regarding the blank votes in this Bill is un\r\n\r\nprecedented,  then the fault lies with the Opposition Parties. The blame  should\r\n\r\nhe on them. Everybody is agreed on a merger between Singapore and the Federation\r\n\r\nof Malaya and the formation\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  a  Federation of Malaysia. The question remains as to what form  and  method\r\n\r\nshould be adopted to effect a merger of the two territories.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>8.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. propose the White Paper merger, and the Opposition Parties also put\r\n\r\nforward their own merger proposals. On this question, I say that we are  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion  that in 1959 the people gave us a mandate on merger. But we still  feel\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  to  ask the people for their decision on this  matter.  And  so,\r\n\r\ntherefore, we have drafted this National Referendum Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the provision regarding blank votes, it means that if the people\r\n\r\ncould not decide on the two questions, they are prepared to leave the matter  to\r\n\r\nthe  decision  of the Legislative Assembly. This matter could be  likened  to  a\r\n\r\nmaiden  who  has  two  lovers.  These two lovers are  very  much  liked  by  her\r\n\r\n[!interruption,  but one of them is superior to the other who  may  be  on  more\r\n\r\nintimate  terms. So she finds it difficult to decide and, therefore,  says  that\r\n\r\nshe  is  willing to allow her parents to decide for her. And these  two  lovers,\r\n\r\nalthough they like her, do not want to force her [Interruption].

Have  they  tried\r\n\r\ntheir best to, win the support of the people? They have not done so because they\r\n\r\nare not sincere and because they know that the proposals propounded by them will\r\n\r\nbe  inimical to them. Therefore, the only way left for them would be  to  oppose\r\n\r\nthis  Referendum  Bill by saying that the people have the right  to  tear  their\r\n\r\nballot  papers.  What is the motive for putting forward such a  suggestion?  The\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore can think for themselves. Why should the people  have  the\r\n\r\nright to tear their ballot papers?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the motive?

They told them that they should not  support  the\r\n\r\nmerger  proposals. If they supported the merger proposals, then their  posterity\r\n\r\nand  future  generations will condemn them as being wicked. They also  told  the\r\n\r\nhousewives this, \"Auntie, will you please sign your name on this list  of  names\r\n\r\nsaying  that you are against the merger proposals?\" By doing this, they  thought\r\n\r\nthey could be successful in the initial stages. But they did not get any support\r\n\r\nfrom  anybody.  Maybe there are a few people in the Barisan Sosialis  who  might\r\n\r\nsupport  them.

At that time, the P.A.P. said that the  people\r\n\r\nwere  intelligent and I see no reason why they should regard  our  people  in  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  light today. They are afraid because they do not have the support  of\r\n\r\nthe  people.  The membership of their Party has dwindled to almost nothing.

Perhaps. Mr Speaker, you will remember - so will  other\r\n\r\nMembers of this Assembly - that when we debated the merger\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nissue,  the Barisan Sosialis put forward their views for complete merger on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  Penang  or  Malacca,  but since then they  have  realised  that  they\r\n\r\ncommitted  a blunder. The Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen then launched a house-to-house  campaign and adopted their usual deceptive tactics to mislead the  people\r\n\r\nby stirring up communalism in order to hoodwink them to their side.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have been accused by the Barisan Sosialis of being un democratic and of suppressing freedom. I cannot understand what kind of freedom\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis want. There is a poem which says if a man walks  naked  in\r\n\r\nthe  street we merely stare at him. We must safeguard freedom for the peace  and\r\n\r\nprosperity  of  the people. Freedom is not to he controlled at one's  whims  and\r\n\r\nfancies.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Barisan Sosialis - especially the Member for Queenstown - on 29th June tried to intimidate the Government side, so much so that you,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  had to issue a warning. How worse will be their attitude  to  the\r\n\r\npeople?  in  addition to their tactics of persuasion, they  will  also  adopt  a\r\n\r\nthreatening  attitude.  Mr Speaker, since we discussed the  merger  issue,  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the Barisan Sosialis have shown from their  appearance  and\r\n\r\noutlook  that they realise that they can no longer hoodwink the people and  that\r\n\r\ntheir  evil manipulations have been exposed to the people. We can see from their\r\n\r\nfaces  that  they are more like sick people. They moved an amendment which  they\r\n\r\nclaimed to be in accordance with the wishes of the people and threatened that if\r\n\r\nit  was  rejected by the Government the people would accuse the P.A.P. of  being\r\n\r\nundemocratic  and  dictatorial. But Mr Speaker, this is a manipulation  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis to salvage their political fortunes. In order to restore  their\r\n\r\nown  prestige,  they keep harping on \"the people\", \"the people\",  because  their\r\n\r\npropaganda  and  tactics have now been well understood  by  the  people  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry. In order to save themselves, they have put up many amendments  so  that\r\n\r\nmerger will not be achieved.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have tabled this Referendum Bill in the Assembly so that the Opposition can debate it thoroughly.

Can  this be considered  undemocratic?  What  kind  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy are you asking for? Is this the type of democracy you are asking for - that  you  require  a  man to walk naked in the street? I  think  the  democracy\r\n\r\nrequired  by the Barisan Sosialis is a Communist democracy, but not a  socialist\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  Yes, Mr Speaker, it is good that we have a thorough  discussion  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  in  this  Assembly so that the people will  not  be  misled  by  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the Barisan Sosialis and the other Opposition  Members  who\r\n\r\nsupport  the Barisan Sosialis or who are the frontline of the Communist  forces.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, I think this is not the end of the matter. I am confident that the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  will adopt other tactics in order to wreck or  frustrate  our\r\n\r\nmerger.

The undemocratic provisions  in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  are known to all the people of Singapore and have been disclosed  in\r\n\r\nthis  House. If we go out to the rural areas to listen to the farmers, or go  to\r\n\r\nthe  factories  to  listen to the workers; or if we go and  meet  merchants  and\r\n\r\npeople  in  other walks of life, you will find that they all accuse  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment,  which insist on the blank votes provision to save  their  political\r\n\r\nlife, of being dishonest and undemocratic in having such provisions in the Bill.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, if the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  dare  to say that they can put a straightforward question  on  their\r\n\r\nWhite Paper merger to a straightforward answer by the people, then they can  say\r\n\r\nthat our amendment is not necessary. But the Government do not want to let their\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  merger  proposals be decided by the people in  a  democratic  way.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  they  have  no alternative but to depend  on  means  which  are  not\r\n\r\ndemocratic to get the answer they want. That is why today they insist  that  all\r\n\r\nblank votes should be deemed to be votes in support of them. My colleagues  have\r\n\r\nadvanced  many  arguments to refute such a proposition. We have  also  mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  there  has been no precedent in all the countries in the world  which  can\r\n\r\nshow that any government can have such a provision as the P.A.P. Government  now\r\n\r\nwould  want  to  have in this Bill. Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P.  Ministers  and\r\n\r\ntheir  Members are unable to advance their reasons and arguments to prove  their\r\n\r\ncase. They have also advanced something which cannot he substantiated, something\r\n\r\nwhich  is  not  based on reason. For instance, when we oppose  the  undemocratic\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill, all the Members from the Government side try to  explain\r\n\r\nthat the opposition to the undemocratic provisions has been provoked by the  Com\r\n\r\nmunists.  They  say  that  today in Singapore the most  isolated  ones  are  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  According to them, there are only 300 Communists in Singapore.  Why\r\n\r\nthen have we been hearing from them all the time that all those who oppose these\r\n\r\nundemocratic provisions\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nare  Communists? Are not their arguments contradictory? Do the Government mean\r\n\r\nto  say  that when we oppose these undemocratic provisions, it will affect  many\r\n\r\npeople  in  future  and many people will cast blank votes when two  unacceptable\r\n\r\nquestions are advanced in the future national referendum?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only goes to show that the P.A.P. Government have no confidence in their\r\n\r\nown  White  Paper merger. It also proves that no matter how the  Government  can\r\n\r\nmake  use  of  all propaganda machinery to spread their point  of  view  to  the\r\n\r\npeople, it will be of no avail to them.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment by us will not be accepted by the Government.\r\n\r\nThis  goes  to  show that they are not sincere in having a national  referendum.\r\n\r\nThey  intend to force through this national referendum in order to salvage their\r\n\r\npolitical fortunes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we as representatives of the people have received repre\r\n\r\nsentations from many organisations which are representatives of the people.  All\r\n\r\nthose representations have given their arguments and attacked those undemocratic\r\n\r\nprovisions  in the Bill. We therefore want to point out clearly here  that  when\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. came into power, it did so with the support of the broad  masses  of\r\n\r\nthe  people, the labouring classes, 'farmers, and others. Today every Member  of\r\n\r\nthis  House  here  has received such representations asking  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nabolish  those undemocratic provisions. But the P.A.P. Government today seem  to\r\n\r\nwant only to stay inside air-conditioned rooms and are oblivious to the views of\r\n\r\nthe people outside. That is why today we are unable to hear the answers from the\r\n\r\nleaders of the P.A.P., especially the Ministers. They have been saying that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. came from the people and they will go among the people. I would say  that\r\n\r\nthey have already thrown the people overboard.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we must point out to the P.A.P. that today people in all\r\n\r\nwalks of life in Singapore strongly oppose the undemocratic provisions that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nall  blank  votes and uncertain votes are deemed to be in support of the  Government.  If the P.A.P. want to achieve their purpose by Fascist means, they cannot\r\n\r\ndo so by just passing this Bill, which will not save their political future. The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has said that the judgment of history is very cruel, and I would\r\n\r\nremind  them of this, that history will give a very correct record of the  whole\r\n\r\nevents and things to come.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in debating the amendment moved by the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  the Opposition Members have said a lot about the terms  \"democracy\"\r\n\r\nand \"undemocracy\". There is a popular Malay saying that the person who shoulders\r\n\r\nthe responsibility knows best the position.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>10.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, many of the Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen are single, I think. These people have not yet had the experience of being a father whose\r\n\r\nresponsibility  is  to  look  after the welfare of  his  children.  Indeed,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  implementing a proposal cannot satisfy all sections of the  community.\r\n\r\nHowever heavy the downpour of rain, there must be a spot where the land is  dry.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the natural course of events. As I have said earlier on, I have  heard\r\n\r\nmuch  being  said about democracy and undemocracy. I say if we are undemocratic,\r\n\r\nthis  Referendum Bill will not be tabled in the Assembly, because the Government\r\n\r\nhave the unfettered right to carry through their proposals without a referendum,\r\n\r\nbut  it is on the basis of democratic principles that they have brought in  this\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill,  so  that  these may be discussed  fully  by  each  and  every\r\n\r\nresponsible Member of the Assembly who is answerable to the people  and  to  the\r\n\r\nState.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me give a simple example, so that even if it is heard by young children, they may be able to understand it, as it is very easy. For\r\n\r\ninstance, a father is responsible for his children, and when the time comes  for\r\n\r\ndinner or lunch, all the children rise to have their food. The question is what\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nkind  of  food  will they take, or what kind of food shall we  take?  Then  the\r\n\r\nfather  asks  the children, \"Awang,\" for instance, \"what would  you  like?\"  And\r\n\r\nAwang replies, \"I like meat.\" Then he asks Ali, \"Ali, what about you, what will\r\n\r\nyou  have?\"  And he says, \"I prefer fish.\" Then again the father  asks  Mohamed,\r\n\r\n\"What  will  you take?\" Mohamed says he likes vegetables. And so on. Then  there\r\n\r\nare so many questions posed to the children. One child prefers fish, because  he\r\n\r\nthinks  that  it  is  better  than vegetables. Another  child  prefers  meat  to\r\n\r\nvegetables. As a responsible father, whose duty it is to look after the  welfare\r\n\r\nof the children, he is obliged to determine what he can afford, if he has twelve\r\n\r\nchildren,  and  if he is a working-class man, he has to spend according  to  his\r\n\r\nmeans,  on  food  containing  vitamins which are necessary  for  his  children's\r\n\r\nhealth. Then he arrives at a decision.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the children are asked, there may he one or two among them who are confused\r\n\r\nbecause they cannot make up their minds which is the better food, whether it  is\r\n\r\nvegetables,  meat,  or fish. They then remain silent. They  leave  it  to  their\r\n\r\nfather's discretion as to what he thinks best. In other words, they give a blank\r\n\r\nvote  to the father, so that the discretion is left to the father to decide what\r\n\r\nis best.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have just quoted the simplest example so that it can be understood by all. This is not a Government nominated by the colonialists. This\r\n\r\nis  a Government elected by the people and is responsible to the people. One day\r\n\r\nwhen  the time comes we will return to the people. It is suggested that we  have\r\n\r\nbetrayed their interests, hut we have to face them one day. If we have done so,\r\n\r\nit will not only be we but our children too who will be condemned by the people.\r\n\r\nWe  realise that as elected representatives we are responsible to the people and\r\n\r\nwe  think this is best for the people. The people may he confused by the tactics\r\n\r\nadopted  by  the Barisan Sosialis on the question of merger as set  out  in  the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nbecause  complete  merger  as  required by  the  Barisan  Sosialis  (which  they\r\n\r\nsubsequently  denied)  is merger on the basis of Penang  or  Malacca.  When  the\r\n\r\npeople  are in such a confused state, they will naturally cast a blank vote.  It\r\n\r\nis  the  duty of the Government to protect the people. The Member for Toa  Payoh\r\n\r\nsaid just now that if we were to go to the people, we would hear them condemning\r\n\r\nthe  Government. If we were to listen to the merchants, we would also  hear  the\r\n\r\nsame  views.  But, Mr Speaker, they are responsible for planting the  seeds  of\r\n\r\nhatred. We never go to the people just for the sake of misleading them.  We  are\r\n\r\nunlike the Barisan Sosialis whose main job is to confuse and mislead the people.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in a democratic way, we put it to the people and tell them that  this\r\n\r\nis one of the best ways in which we can ensure their future, it is up to them to\r\n\r\nchoose.  So, Mr Speaker, I think the blank votes are the result of their  being\r\n\r\nconfused  by disruptive elements and that they have given their mandate  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to look after their welfare. It is appropriate, therefore,  that  the\r\n\r\nblank votes should be used to look after their welfare.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe\r\n\r\nthat  even  in the 19th century, there was no provision of this kind. I  believe\r\n\r\nthe  people  in  this  House too have never heard of this provision.  Under  the\r\n\r\nsystem  of  one man one vote, there have never been such things as  blank  votes\r\n\r\nbeing  treated as in support of the Government's proposition. There is  also  no\r\n\r\nsuch  provision  in dictatorship countries. There are no such  things  as  blank\r\n\r\nvotes  being  counted in support of a dictatorship. In Singapore  we  are  in  a\r\n\r\nspecial position, because we are under a dictatorial P.A.P. Government, but they\r\n\r\nhave  very subtly shouted their slogan of 'service to the people'. They  pretend\r\n\r\nby saying that they want to let the people decide their destiny themselves. That\r\n\r\nis  to  say,  let the constitutional arrangement of the future of  Singapore  be\r\n\r\ndecided by the people of Singapore. But the P.A.P. Government already know  that\r\n\r\nthe constitutional\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\narrangements by them have been discarded by the people. Therefore, they know\r\n\r\nthat in a national referendum they will be defeated, and in order to save their\r\n\r\nfaces, they, in a thick-skinned manner, unashamedly want the blank votes to be\r\n\r\ncounted  as  in favour of the Government's proposition. Therefore,  they  can\r\n\r\ndeceive the people and say that they are very democratic because they let the\r\n\r\npeople decide and the people use their votes to decide in their favour.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the Referendum Bill this plot has come out. Where is the origin of\r\n\r\nthe  plot?  It  is like this. The P.A.P. Government know that the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  do  not want the constitutional arrangements, that is, the  White\r\n\r\nPaper on merger.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>10.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say that the people are given a choice of two alternatives - the White\r\n\r\nPaper type of merger and the Penang/ Malacca type of merger. This means  that\r\n\r\nthe  people  are forced into selecting one of two unacceptable  propositions.\r\n\r\nThis  is  just  like conditions in a feudalistic society.  The  parents  want\r\n\r\ntheir son to choose one of two brides.\r\n\r\nOne of the brides is a leper and the\r\n\r\nother  a  T.B. patient. Whichever bride the son chooses, it will  only  mean\r\n\r\ncalamity.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous speaker said that the Government is something like a father.\r\n\r\nThis  father is something like the father in the example I have just  quoted.\r\n\r\nIs  it  good for a father to force his son to take morphine? Suppose you  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  people should take morphine. Can you force the people to take  it?\r\n\r\nOr is it right for them to take it?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the P.A.P. Members had gone to the coffee shops they\r\n\r\nwould  have  heard from the talk among businessmen and trishaw  pullers  that\r\n\r\nthey  object  to  the Government's dictatorial method used  in  the  National\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill. To liken the Government to a father of the  people  in  the\r\n\r\nexample  given, who regards the blank votes as supporting the Government,  is\r\n\r\nnot right. I think the P.A.P. Members have not been to the people, otherwise\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthey would have heard of these conversations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government are just like prostitutes who regard those people who do\r\n\r\nnot  speak  to them as no good. This is a shameful act. If the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nputs  forward  two questions, one on the White Paper and the other  on  the  so-called  Penang and Malacca type of merger, with the condition that  blank  votes\r\n\r\nare counted in favour of the Government, then in an electorate of 500 people, if\r\n\r\n200  votes  are in favour of the White Paper, 200 in favour of the Penang  type,\r\n\r\nthen  the  100  blank or uncertain votes will under this clause  mean  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  winning  when,  in  fact,  it  is  losing.  That  is  a  way  of\r\n\r\nmisinterpreting the will of the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do the Government want to have the blank votes provision? The arguments\r\n\r\nare  that the purpose is to frustrate the Barisan Sosialis' intent to wreck  the\r\n\r\nnational referendum. Are you treating the people as blind people or people  with\r\n\r\nout brains? When they elected you to form the Government, were they blind?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

The P.A.P. say the Barisan Sosialis are provoking the people into\r\n\r\nwrecking the national referendum. But today, Sir, the political knowledge of the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  is far greater than that in 1959.  They  have  made  much\r\n\r\nprogress  and  they cannot now be fooled by politicians. If  a  thing  is  good,\r\n\r\ncorrect and advantageous to them, they will fully support it. But if ii  is  bad\r\n\r\nor  inimical to them and detrimental to their future or their generations,  they\r\n\r\nwill strongly oppose it. That is why up to now the PAP. Government are unable to\r\n\r\nand  cannot  quote  precedents in any country in the world that  adopts  such  a\r\n\r\nprovision  as  this  one, providing for blank votes to  be  in  support  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.

They  argued  that  democracy  has  the\r\n\r\nconnotation  which  should be interpreted in relation to the  prevailing  circumstances and objective surroundings. But if they really mean democracy, then  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should not prevent the people from having democratic rights.  And  if\r\n\r\nyou  want to have democracy you should not only exercise democracy in this House\r\n\r\nbut  also  let  the  people have the right to democracy outside.  That  is  only\r\n\r\ndemocratic.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these protestations of concern, for what the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  choose  to  call the basic democratic  right  to  organise  a\r\n\r\ncampaign  for the recording of blank votes in order to frustrate the  referendum\r\n\r\non  merger,  can  be  dismissed  with  the contempt  that  they  deserve.  These\r\n\r\nprotestations sound hollow and hypocritical coming from the lips of those  whose\r\n\r\nmanipulators  outside the Assembly have very little regard for democratic  forms\r\n\r\nand  practices. There is nothing undemocratic in giving the voter the  right  to\r\n\r\nchoose between two or more honest proposals in a referendum, and say to him that\r\n\r\nif  he  cannot  make up his mind, then he is deemed to accept or be  willing  to\r\n\r\naccept the Legislative Assembly decision on the matter referred.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is nothing eternal or immutable about the principles underlying\r\n\r\nelectoral  procedures,  nor is there any such concept as the  fundamental  human\r\n\r\nright  to ascertain. Electoral procedures are primarily designed to ensure  that\r\n\r\nelections  and  matters put to the electorate are fairly and honestly  conducted\r\n\r\nand fairly and honestly put. And if there is a threat of abuse, then these proce\r\n\r\ndures must be amended to check the possibility of such abuse.

If, in effect a no-merger proposal in the disguise of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  proposal  for complete merger with  automatic  conversion  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship and proportionate representation is put to the electorate, it  would\r\n\r\nbe a fraud on the electorate.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has been challenged to publish the Tunku's reply to his\r\n\r\nParty's proposal on merger, but he has not dared to publish it as it will expose\r\n\r\nthe  deception by which the Barisan Sosialis have sought to conceal their  bogus\r\n\r\ncomplete merger proposal.

There  is no reason why we should help them to achieve  their  evil\r\n\r\npurpose.

They do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  remember what the 38 trade unions and the Country People's Association\r\n\r\nsaid  before  the Select Committee. Their friends and supporters in those  trade\r\n\r\nunions  wanted it enacted in the Bill that the affirmative of a question put  to\r\n\r\nthe  electorate should be given effect to only if it received 60 per cent of the\r\n\r\nvotes  cast. A case like this was put to the unions. Suppose there were  100,000\r\n\r\nelectors in a referendum who voted:\r\n\r\n49,000 voted for the affirmative and\r\n\r\n40,000 against; and there were 11,000 blank votes. They were asked on which side\r\n\r\nthe  11,000  blank votes should be counted. The reply was that the 11,000  blank\r\n\r\nvotes  should be counted on the negative side. In other words, they made a claim\r\n\r\nto  these 11,000 blank votes. Why then do the Member for Thomson and the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown accuse the Government of wanting to steal these blank votes? All\r\n\r\nthat the Government propose is that voters who cannot make up their minds on the\r\n\r\nquestion  or questions put to them should be deemed to have accepted and  to  be\r\n\r\nwilling  to  accept  the  decision of the Legislative  Assembly  on  the  matter\r\n\r\nreferred.  How then can the Government be accused of wanting to grab  the  blank\r\n\r\nvotes  and  to  steal  the blank votes?

And it  is\r\n\r\nastounding to hear the Government Benches maintaining that what they  are  doing\r\n\r\nis  democratic. What is democracy? Democracy is, in essence, the  power  of  the\r\n\r\ncitizen  to  exercise his right, the right to elect and the right to  ultimately\r\n\r\nform  the  Government in the country. But that is a right which has two aspects.\r\n\r\nOne  has  a right to say 'yes' and one has the right to say 'no'. If  a  man  is\r\n\r\ngiven a right and that right is limited to only saying 'yes', that right can  be\r\n\r\nvery, very dangerous. It is much better that one is deprived of the right to say\r\n\r\n'yes' rather than be compelled to say 'yes'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so long ago, I remember seeing a picture, I think it was \"Trial at Nuremburg\". Those Germans during the time when Hitler was just coming to power were\r\n\r\ncompelled  by  Hitler's  Government to say 'yes' to certain  of  the  legal  constitutional  changes introduced by the Nazi regime. I remember  one  of  the  democrats in that picture was trying to defend his democratic stand. When  he  was\r\n\r\nasked  by the prosecution how it was that he said 'yes' to Hitler's constitutional  changes in the legal field, he said, \"But everybody had to say 'yes'. Nobody\r\n\r\nwas  allowed to say 'no'.\" Therefore, he said 'yes' because everybody had to say\r\n\r\n'yes'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have gone one step further than Hitler. They say you only say\r\n\r\n'yes';  you do not say 'no'; and even you say nothing, it means 'yes'. Where  is\r\n\r\ndemocracy  now? You only have the right to say 'yes' but not the  right  to  say\r\n\r\n'no' or 'abstain'. And yet we see sensible and intelligent Government Front  Ben\r\n\r\nches  seriously  standing up to defend this situation. How far  can  one  go  in\r\n\r\ntrying to deceive oneself and in trying to deceive the people? All the arguments\r\n\r\nof  the  Government hinge on one thing, i.e., the Opposition is likely to pinch,\r\n\r\nas  the Minister for Health and Law said, the abstaining votes. Just because  it\r\n\r\nis contended that the Opposition might pinch\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe  unmarked  and  blank votes, the Government justify themselves  by  stealing\r\n\r\nthose votes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I did not say that.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Where is the moral?

My argument was that just because it was their contention  that\r\n\r\nwe  wanted to pinch them, they justify themselves by stealing the votes. They do\r\n\r\nnot  seem  to  understand it. Let me come to the point. Why  is  the  Government\r\n\r\nmaking  such  a  big fuss about blank votes? Is it because the Government  think\r\n\r\nthat more than half the people of Singapore will be casting blank\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvotes?  In that case, Mr Mammen, Sir, it is an open admission that the  Barisan\r\n\r\nis  able  to swing the views and opinions of more than half the people in  Singa\r\n\r\npore. If that contention is not in the minds of the Government Benches, if  they\r\n\r\nfeel  that with Radio P.A.P., with all the newspapers, with all the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture  vans  going  around they should easily be able  to  out-propaganda  us;\r\n\r\nwherein  lies the fear that the people will be confused, as I heard one  of  the\r\n\r\nBack  benchers mutter? If the people are confused, it is because they have  been\r\n\r\nconfused by the Government. If it is contended that the Opposition have confused\r\n\r\nthe people, surely, Mr Mammen, Sir, the right thing is for the Government to go\r\n\r\nand  unconfuse  the people, so that when it comes to a matter of  such  national\r\n\r\nimportance as the referendum on merger, the people should be able to make  their\r\n\r\ndecision with clear and open minds. Are the Government so sure that despite  all\r\n\r\ntheir  propaganda apparatus they have no chance of winning the hearts and  minds\r\n\r\nof  the people, that they must resort to legal looting in order to have one over\r\n\r\nthe  people?  If  that is an open admission, then we will have  less  to  grouse\r\n\r\nabout.  Even then, standing here as representatives of the people,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nstand up to protect the people's rights.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government keep on harping that if they are a Fascist Government the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis would not be here. They forgot the time when  they  themselves\r\n\r\nwere  over the other side, in 1958 and the beginning of 1959, when there  was  a\r\n\r\nserous  move from the then S.P.A. Coalition Government, in conjunction with  the\r\n\r\nthen  Director  of Special Branch, to ban the P.A.P. I believe  in  one  of  his\r\n\r\nsparring episodes with the Member for Anson, the Minister for Health and Law did\r\n\r\nmention in his open letter to the Straits Times where I became involved. In  the\r\n\r\nperiod  1958/1959, the greatest danger the P.A.P. faced was proscription by  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A.  Government. That was written by the Minister for Health and Law himself.\r\n\r\nI  presume  it  is an accurate statement, and I presume, being the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLaw, he has a lot of evidence and a lot of grounds before he\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmakes such a categorical statement in the Press. Why then, Mr Mammen, Sir,  was\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. not proscribed in 1958/1959? Why was it not banned despite the strong\r\n\r\nmove  by  the  then Government to ban it? Because it is known  that  under  the\r\n\r\nConstitution, the then Government could do only certain things and could go only\r\n\r\nthat  far.  I  put  it to you, Mr Mammen, Sir, that the P.A.P.  Government  are\r\n\r\nsuffering  from the same limitations, although they try to persuade  the  people\r\n\r\nthat  the  correct way to fix the Barisan is not to lock them up, as the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill has frequently challenged them to do so. They contend that in the\r\n\r\nfight  for  the  hearts and minds of the people of the electorate,  to  ban  the\r\n\r\nBarisan,  to  lock  up the Barisan leaders is not the right move.  That  is  the\r\n\r\nstrategy they have advocated and that is the reply they have always given to the\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill whenever the hon. Member for Cairnhill, the ex-Hon.  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister,  challenges them to lock up a certain portion of the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nleadership. They have established that fact and today they come and tell us they\r\n\r\nare  not  banning  the  Barisan  Sosialis or that  they  are  not  limiting  the\r\n\r\nactivities of the Barisan Sosialis because they are democratic.

But then when he went on to justify that blank  votes  and\r\n\r\nspoilt  votes are votes in favour of the Government, he went a bit  too  far  to\r\n\r\nsuggest the simile of a father asking his children what food they liked. He  was\r\n\r\nsaying that if the father was uncertain whether to give his children fish,  meat\r\n\r\nor  vegetables,  he would ask the Sons whether they should have what  particular\r\n\r\ntype  of food on the table. Mr Mammen, Sir, I say that if he did that, he would\r\n\r\nbe  a very stupid father because children naturally like tasty food, sweetstuff,\r\n\r\nfoods that are full of calories and carbohydrates, but of very little nutritious\r\n\r\nvalue. If you let kids have a say in what they should take, they will be sucking\r\n\r\nsweets all day. A responsible father will not ask his children whether they like\r\n\r\nthis or that, but he will just give that to them. [Interruption.]\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister for Home Affairs will\r\n\r\nbear  with  me - a responsible government will not go round asking the  electorate\r\n\r\nwhether they want to smoke cigarettes, or pipe tobacco, or cigars, because those\r\n\r\nthings should be decided by sensible people. It is only when issues of grave  im\r\n\r\nportance come into the question that it is necessary to have a referendum. After\r\n\r\nall, we all know that a referendum will\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ncost some $400,000 in this part of the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for the Hon the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister to suggest\r\n\r\nsimiles that are absurd would indicate the absurdity and the bankruptcy  of  the\r\n\r\nstand  of  the Government in that, they have to divert intelligent  people  into\r\n\r\nsome silly argument.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the last speaker from the Government Benches, the Minister for Health and\r\n\r\nLaw, contended that clause 29 is both democratic -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> And necessary.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - and necessary. We know that one of the strongest\r\n\r\narguments of the Government is that this Bill is a general Referendum Bill meant\r\n\r\nfor  general referenda. Today, Sir, when I came into the Chamber I was surprised\r\n\r\nto find an amendment tabled by the Minister for Home Affairs - to be known as Part\r\n\r\nVI under the sub-title \"DURATION\":\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This Ordinance shall cease to have effect\r\n\r\non the merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>They  now come and tell us that it is a general Referendum Bill. It is a general\r\n\r\nreferendum all right. As soon as the referendum on merger is over, the  Bill - it\r\n\r\nwill be an Ordinance then - will also be finished. So is not this Bill a specific\r\n\r\nBill  produced  for a specific purpose as defined by the Hon, the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to the Minister for National Development? He remarked just  now  that\r\n\r\nany sensible person must always have a motive when he does a thing. He said that\r\n\r\nin the case of this Bill the motive is to bring about merger with the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya. They go to great lengths to demonstrate to this House that the  Bill\r\n\r\nis  a  specific  referendum Bill. And this amendment here, Mr Mammen,  Sir,  is\r\n\r\nconcrete proof that the Bill is specific. Yet they keep on repeating their false\r\n\r\nhood  that this is a general Bill. But never mind about that. The merits of  the\r\n\r\narguments have been recorded in Hansard, and it will be futile for me to  repeat\r\n\r\nthose arguments when, as I have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsaid,  there  is so much schizoid tendency on the Government Front Benches.  But\r\n\r\nlet us see why it is necessary to introduce this amendment in relation to clause\r\n\r\n29.  I  venture to suggest, Sir, that the Tunku, who has a lot of say  fn  these\r\n\r\nthings, has suggested to the P.A.P. Government that clause 29 is unacceptable by\r\n\r\nthe  Federation, and that he will only have anything to do with the Bill if that\r\n\r\nclause is deleted. He has made no pretensions about his views on this clause. He\r\n\r\nhas said so openly. He has at least implied that it is undemocratic.\r\n\r\nI mean clause 29, Mr Mammen, Sir. And\r\n\r\nthis is but a compromise between the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and the Tunku.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

And if there is any compromise at all, this Ordinance will be revoked\r\n\r\nimmediately  after merger. So that in so far as the Tunku is concerned,  he  has\r\n\r\nnothing  to do with it. That goes to show, Mr Mammen, Sir, that even the  Tunku\r\n\r\ndoes  not want clause 29. The Tunku is sensible enough to know, that the  people\r\n\r\nshould  not  be cheated, because once they are cheated they lose  faith  in  the\r\n\r\nwhole parliamentary machine.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nOn  a point of order, Sir.

We  are now going to put the question of merger to  a  referendum.\r\n\r\nThe provisions concerning the blank votes are meant to encourage the people  to\r\n\r\ngo  and  vote.

Therefore, it is the Member for Anson who is insincere  and\r\n\r\nnot loyal.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in these few days, we have had a very heated debate\r\n\r\non the question which is of interest to the whole of the people of Singapore. We\r\n\r\ncan  see that not only our benches, but even all the gallery seats are full. Not\r\n\r\nonly this -\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have indicated in the past that in so far as the gallery\r\n\r\nis concerned, Members should make no direct reference to the gallery. The Member\r\n\r\nis speaking to the House through the Speaker.

Mr Speaker, Sir, in this\r\n\r\nBill  there  are many clauses which are against the principles of democracy.  My\r\n\r\nParty Chairman and comrades and the majority of the Opposition Members have made\r\n\r\nvery  clear  remarks that there is no precedent like the provision made  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I must ask the\r\n\r\nMember  to do what I have just asked the Member for Tiong Bahru to do, that  is,\r\n\r\nto modulate his voice and speak a little softer.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nOn  this  question,  my  Party and the majority of the Opposition  Members  have\r\n\r\nalready said that the Referendum Bill proposed by the P.A.P. Government  has  no\r\n\r\nprecedent  throughout  the world. This does not mean that  there  are  many  pro\r\n\r\nvisions  in this Bill which are against the interests of the people.  There  are\r\n\r\nmany pseudo democratic expressions here.\r\n\r\nOn  the  question of the referendum under discussion, the P.A.P. want to have  a\r\n\r\nfalse merger. They want to cause the realisation of a pseudo merger. We on  this\r\n\r\nside,  the  majority of our Opposition Members, i.e. the Barisan  Sosialis,  the\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Party, the United People's Party, when the Government brought  up  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper Command Paper 33, we protested very vehemently. At that time,  they\r\n\r\ngot  the  support of the S.P.A. They got their victory in the first  round.  But\r\n\r\nwhat about the people of Singapore? Can they be deceived repeatedly\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunder  such circumstances? All the people in Singapore consider the P.A.P. type of merger as a sell-out. Now -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I take it that the Memebr is referring to the White Paper merger\r\n\r\nproposals when he refers to the P.A.P. sell-out merger. I have already indicated that to\r\n\r\nrefer to the White Paper as a sell-out merger is completely out of order, because it is a\r\n\r\nreflection on a vote of the House. Therefore, it cannot be referred to as a sell-out.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nI  want  to strengthen my point on this present Bill on referendum. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  people of the whole world today have the right to have democracy.  At\r\n\r\nthis  time  the  P.A.P. have arranged for a merger which  will  be  against  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the people. They try to put this referendum to test the  people's\r\n\r\nopinion. They use this method \"Do you want it? We will let you vote on it and we\r\n\r\ncall  it  a referendum.\" And they claim that by doing so it is already a gesture\r\n\r\nof  democracy. But in the Referendum Bill, this type of democracy is not a  true\r\n\r\none. In clause 5, we have proposed that we should only allow one question to  be\r\n\r\nposed  in  the  referendum instead of two, i.e. whether the people  support  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  proposals as published in Command Paper 33. The P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nhave  already taken Radio Singapore as their propaganda machinery and they  have\r\n\r\nalready  said  that  this type of P.A.P. White Paper merger proposals  gives  us\r\n\r\nautonomy in labour and education. They feel that this is already something to be\r\n\r\nvery proud\r\n\r\nof. They have deprived many citizens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  their citizenship right. They mention as an example the Penang/Malacca  type\r\n\r\nof merger by which Singapore citizens will lose their citizenship. Now the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government's attitude can be\r\n\r\njudged  by  us, especially in the light of what we have published. We  have  pub\r\n\r\nlished the pamphlet called \"The Tasks of our present struggle\". In page  9,  we\r\n\r\nhave  described the platform of our policy, which says that the citizens should\r\n\r\nautomatically  become citizens of the Federation. There should be proportionate\r\n\r\nrepresentation  in  the Central Parliament and Singapore.  There  should  be  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  election  to let the people decide openly whether there  should  be  a\r\n\r\nmerger with the Federation of Malaya. In other words, before deciding the  question,  that  is,  on the date of merger, all Singapore citizens  should  become\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  the  Federation and at the same time there should  be  a  general\r\n\r\nelection to decide the question -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
