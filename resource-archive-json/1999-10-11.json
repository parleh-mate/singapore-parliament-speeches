Just  two  years  ago,  when  the  Ninth\r\n\r\nParliament  opened,  Singapore was prospering.   We  are  now\r\n\r\nbarely  emerging from an economic crisis, which has left  the\r\n\r\nregion badly scarred.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been able to overcome our difficulties because\r\n\r\nof  the  strength and integrity of our political  and  social\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  More importantly, because of the rational  way\r\n\r\nwith which we deal with our problems. This, coupled with  the\r\n\r\nunwavering support from employers and workers, has helped  us\r\n\r\nscore top marks with investors.  Singapore has earned nothing\r\n\r\nbut praise for its resilience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the good times, some Singaporeans had the benefit of\r\n\r\nsharing  in the prosperity while being critical of  the  very\r\n\r\nGovernment  whose  policies made for that  prosperity.   They\r\n\r\nfelt  that growth was in the natural order of things and that\r\n\r\nthis  Government was undeservedly immodest about what it  had\r\n\r\nachieved for the country.  But the regional crisis has forced\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  to  reassess their cynicism.  It is painfully  apparent\r\n\r\nthat  different countries suffered differently in the  crisis\r\n\r\nand  there is a good reason.  The greatest pain was  suffered\r\n\r\nby those with the weakest systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now very few people harbour doubts about the wisdom of\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  policies.  Very few  people  believe  that\r\n\r\nthere  will always be good times, whether or not  we  have  a\r\n\r\ngood  Government.  Singaporeans are experiencing  first  hand\r\n\r\nthe  positive  effects  of  the  close  relationship  between\r\n\r\nGovernment, employers and workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, the most significant result of this crisis is\r\n\r\nthat  while  other  Asian  countries  are  channelling  their\r\n\r\nresources to restructuring their economies, we have moved on.\r\n\r\nWe  are  already talking about developing our  people,  about\r\n\r\nstrengthening our \"heartware\".  That is a luxury which  today\r\n\r\nother  Asian countries can only dream about.  They  have  too\r\n\r\nmany political, social and economic problems on their plate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Speech is aptly entitled \"Building Our\r\n\r\nFuture  Together\".   It is about the responsibility  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  share  to  shape the future of this  country.   The\r\n\r\ncentrepiece of the Government's programme is the people.   It\r\n\r\nsignals  a  gradual  shift  in emphasis  from  infrastructure\r\n\r\ndevelopment to people development.  The hardware which  makes\r\n\r\nSingapore work is already in place.  It is now time  to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore special.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Speech is an invitation to all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to consider how we can achieve that  goal.  This\r\n\r\nis  an  opportunity for us to construct a new model.  By  its\r\n\r\nnature,  the model must be flexible so that it can evolve  in\r\n\r\nchanging  circumstances.  It must also be  realistic.   There\r\n\r\nmust be serious debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no place in the debate of such an issue for\r\n\r\ncliches  and  platitudes.  In this respect, I  refer  to  the\r\n\r\nNCMP's proposed amendment to the motion which, in my view, is\r\n\r\na  perfect  example of a cliche.  He laments the  absence  of\r\n\r\nmeasures in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident's  Speech.   But  he  knows  that  the  President's\r\n\r\nAddress is, by convention, a mission statement.  Details  are\r\n\r\nleft  to  the  Addenda  and to this  debate.   Unless  he  is\r\n\r\nconstructive,  he will contribute very little or  nothing  to\r\n\r\nthe debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the Government's aims? The Government has said\r\n\r\nthat  it  wants  to  promote active citizenship,  independent\r\n\r\ncreative  thought  and constructive disagreement.   They  are\r\n\r\nnoble  aims.   But  first,  we  have  to  settle  some  basic\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, in my view, three threshold issues. First,\r\n\r\nwhat  are  the  basic  terms on  which empowerment  can  take\r\n\r\nplace?   Second, do Singaporeans know what they want?  Third,\r\n\r\nis   the   Government   prepared  for   the   changes   which\r\n\r\nliberalisation will bring in its train?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The terms of empowerment</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue turns on the meaning of active\r\n\r\ncitizenship.   A  close  reading of the  President's   Speech\r\n\r\nsuggests  that, true to form, the Government has no intention\r\n\r\nof  giving  handouts.  Active citizenship is  not  about  the\r\n\r\ntransfer   of  rights  and  power  to  the  people.    Active\r\n\r\ncitizenship  encapsulates a bargain.  It is premised  on  the\r\n\r\nsimple  principle that there cannot be greater rights without\r\n\r\ngreater  responsibility.   Put  simply,  Singaporeans  cannot\r\n\r\nexpect  to sit back and ask for more \"space\" or the right  to\r\n\r\nengage in \"constructive disagreement\" without contributing to\r\n\r\nthe system which can accommodate those rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has always said that contribution to the\r\n\r\ncommunity  is  an integral part of active citizenship.   This\r\n\r\nidea  is  reinforced in the President's Speech which balances\r\n\r\nthe  development of the individual with the abiding  need  to\r\n\r\nmaintain social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then are the ingredients of our cohesiveness?\r\n\r\nSingapore's  success  is  due  to  certain  basic  strengths:\r\n\r\nteamwork, religious and racial harmony and a strong sense  of\r\n\r\nfamily and community.  But these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  come  at  a price.  Singaporeans have had to  sacrifice\r\n\r\nsome  of their individual rights for the larger interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  community.   For  example, we do  not  make  disparaging\r\n\r\nremarks  about  race or religion, language or  culture.   The\r\n\r\nresult  is  stability.  We do not defame without basis.   The\r\n\r\nresult  is that reputations which are painstakingly built  up\r\n\r\nover years are protected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The model that we seek to construct cannot ignore these\r\n\r\nbasic  values.  There is no point in demanding a larger voice\r\n\r\nif we are not prepared to maintain the fundamentals that have\r\n\r\nmade  this  place  work.  The sooner we recognise  this,  the\r\n\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as in all bargains, the Government too has an\r\n\r\nobligation.  It has a duty to spell out its vision as clearly\r\n\r\nas  it can.  While I accept that by its nature, the issue  of\r\n\r\nempowerment  is  difficult  to  define.   It  is  nonetheless\r\n\r\nincumbent on the Government, as part of the quid pro quo,  to\r\n\r\nbe as clear as it can about what it has in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not only fair, it is wise. Fair because people\r\n\r\nare  entitled  to know what they can legitimately  expect  if\r\n\r\nthey  take  up  the  challenge of active  citizenship.   Wise\r\n\r\nbecause it is a dangerous business to hold out the promise of\r\n\r\ngreater   participation  in  public  life  without  a   clear\r\n\r\nexplanation  of what that involves.  If people  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhat the Government has in mind, they will have all sorts  of\r\n\r\nexpectations.  They will feel let down if their  expectations\r\n\r\nare  not  met.  That, from the Government's standpoint,  will\r\n\r\ndefeat the entire purpose of this exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very different from a programme to upgrade the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure or grow the economy.   Those tangibles can  be\r\n\r\nmeasured.   But an undertaking to give people a greater  role\r\n\r\nin  the  affairs of the nation is an intangible one.   People\r\n\r\nmust  believe  that it is not an empty promise.  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmust,  in  due  course, be told in clear  terms  what  active\r\n\r\ncitizenship entails in terms of rights and responsibilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must have a road map with clear pointers\r\n\r\nand markers.  An\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nambiguous   policy  can  be  counter  productive.   Perceived\r\n\r\nretreats from the pledges in the President's Speech  will  be\r\n\r\nmagnified  many times over, as will the disillusionment  with\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>What do Singaporeans want?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue which we need to address is what do\r\n\r\nSingaporeans want.  There are a number of dimensions to  this\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is not always easy to gauge public opinion.\r\n\r\nIt  is  particularly difficult when the concept of \"political\r\n\r\nspace\" is being discussed.  There is a significant section of\r\n\r\nloyal  Singaporeans which will welcome a  relaxation  of  the\r\n\r\nnorms.   But there is a large and equally committed group  of\r\n\r\nconservatives  in this country which is very comfortable with\r\n\r\nthe  status  quo. Their interests and aspirations  cannot  be\r\n\r\nignored.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These conservatives cross racial and religious\r\n\r\nboundaries.  They come from different backgrounds and  strata\r\n\r\nof  society.  They have grown up in and are accustomed  to  a\r\n\r\nsystem  where  in  return  for  their  contribution  to   the\r\n\r\ncommunity  they  receive the benefits of a safe  environment,\r\n\r\nsteady jobs, good health care, good education.  They may  not\r\n\r\nwant change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too often the debate between those who do not want\r\n\r\nchange and those who do is reduced to whether the East or the\r\n\r\nWest  has  the  better  model.  But that  is  unhelpful.   It\r\n\r\ndistracts  us  from the issue of what is right  for  us.   We\r\n\r\nshould  design our own formula.  In doing that, we must  take\r\n\r\naccount of the views of all Singaporeans, not only those  who\r\n\r\nare  vocal.  It is bad governance to cater only to those  who\r\n\r\nwant  more  without regard for the anxieties and the  comfort\r\n\r\nlevels of those who do not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second dimension to this question is this. There\r\n\r\nhas  been  very little debate about what we want, even  among\r\n\r\nthose   who  want  change.   Perhaps  this  is  due  to   the\r\n\r\nunfortunate   turn   which  the  argument  takes   sometimes.\r\n\r\nAttempts to push at the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlimits have been met by vigorous and robust reactions.   This\r\n\r\nhas  resulted  in different signals being sent  to  different\r\n\r\npeople.   But  at the end of the day, we are no  wiser  about\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Government and the people should aim to construct.\r\n\r\nUnless we identify what we want and what we are prepared for,\r\n\r\nwe cannot sensibly advance these discussions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we have to ask ourselves whether we are prepared\r\n\r\nand  ready  for  an  increased  transfer  of  responsibility.\r\n\r\nToday, we rely on the Government for almost everything.   For\r\n\r\nexample, the Government decides what we can and cannot  watch\r\n\r\nor  read  in  Singapore.  Many people find it  convenient  to\r\n\r\nabdicate these difficult decisions to the State.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But empowerment is not only about having more rights.\r\n\r\nIt  is  also  about greater responsibility.  Are Singaporeans\r\n\r\nprepared to take more responsibility for their lives and  the\r\n\r\nlives  of  their children?  The Internet is a  good  example.\r\n\r\nHow  many parents are prepared to tell the Government to stop\r\n\r\ncensorship  of  the Internet because they  will  decide  what\r\n\r\ntheir children can and cannot access at home, I suspect  that\r\n\r\nyou  will  find  that many Singaporeans are  happy  with  the\r\n\r\nstatus quo.  It is neither easy nor popular to be a watchdog.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, and perhaps the most important question is, can\r\n\r\nwe   take   the   heat?   Friction  will  be   generated   by\r\n\r\n\"constructive disagreement\".  Debate means give and take.  If\r\n\r\nwe  want to criticise, we must accept that the Government has\r\n\r\na corresponding right to rebut.  We know this Government.  It\r\n\r\nis not known for the subtlety of its replies.  The  moment we\r\n\r\nsay we want  more participation but not the embarrassment  of\r\n\r\nhaving  our arguments torn apart, then the debate about  this\r\n\r\ndebate ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Is the Government prepared for the change?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue we have to consider is whether the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is prepared for the changes that will  come  with\r\n\r\nits policies.  The recent debate about whether\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  are ready to have the equivalent of a Hyde Park has  sent\r\n\r\nmixed signals.  That is interesting because it tells us  that\r\n\r\nat  the very top level, we are still grappling for some  form\r\n\r\nof  consensus  about the desirable pace  of  change.   It  is\r\n\r\nencouraging  because it reflects an active discussion  and  a\r\n\r\ndeep interest in the issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But other forces are at work which will soon test the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  resolve  to  embrace change.   The  President's\r\n\r\nSpeech  reiterates the need to encourage individual  creative\r\n\r\nwork.  That  is  an admirable objective.  It  will  have  the\r\n\r\nsupport of all Singaporeans.  But it will take time.  We need\r\n\r\nto  change  the  mindset  of a whole generation  of  parents,\r\n\r\nteachers  and  children.  But in time, we will  see  a  large\r\n\r\ngroup of highly creative people in our country, and that will\r\n\r\nbe positive for our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it will also mean a new generation of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwith  expectations and aspirations very different from  ours.\r\n\r\nOne cannot encourage creativity and then compartmentalise it.\r\n\r\nCreativity   will   dramatically   affect   an   individual's\r\n\r\nworldview.  A person who is trained  to think for himself and\r\n\r\nto  think  out of the box may well have little tolerance  for\r\n\r\nrigid  structures, whether political or social.  He may  have\r\n\r\nno  sympathy for a government which tries to think  for  him.\r\n\r\nHe is likely to reject the concept of OB markers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new generation will want a say in everything that\r\n\r\nconcerns  or interests them.  The Government must be prepared\r\n\r\nfor  their quirks and aspirations.  Our institutions must  be\r\n\r\nsufficiently  tolerant  and flexible to  accommodate  a  wide\r\n\r\nrange  of  different and sometimes, extraordinary, views.   A\r\n\r\nknee-jerk rejection of these views would be disastrous.   All\r\n\r\nthe  good work will come to nought.  It will trigger the very\r\n\r\nmigration  of  talent  that  our  policies  are  designed  to\r\n\r\nprevent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not be surprised if, over the next 10 to 15\r\n\r\nyears,  young adults begin to insist on having their  own  OB\r\n\r\nmarkers; \"space\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere  the  Government  cannot intrude.

I am sure Members will do so.  I look forward to  an\r\n\r\ninteresting debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  thank you for the opportunity to speak in this  debate.\r\n\r\nI  rise  to  support the motion standing in the  name  of  Mr\r\n\r\nDavinder Singh.  Together with him and other Members of  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  let  me  also  add  my  congratulations  to  our  new\r\n\r\nPresident, and to thank him for his Address to this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Address fills me and, I believe, many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans with a sense of pride and anticipation.   Pride,\r\n\r\nin  that  as we approach the dawn of the new century,  we  in\r\n\r\nSingapore could enjoy a sound economy, which is admired by so\r\n\r\nmany.   Besides being a prosperous place, it is also a  place\r\n\r\nof  calm, of safety and security in a stormy sea of political\r\n\r\nand social turmoil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anticipation, in that the Government is going to focus\r\n\r\non   the  people,  on  providing  the  means  to  help  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  to develop according to his or her ability.   In\r\n\r\nterms of strengthening civil society, the people sector  will\r\n\r\ntake  centre stage.  The more vulnerable groups will also  be\r\n\r\nspecially targeted for more care and assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both the message and the vision are clear - this\r\n\r\nis  the  Age  of the Active Citizen.  It brings with  it  the\r\n\r\nsignal  that the Government is intent on strengthening  civil\r\n\r\nsociety.   Civil  society  occupies  the  space  between  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  and the state.  Politics is not the  only  way  to\r\n\r\nbecome   involved  in  public  life.   Active  citizens   can\r\n\r\ncontribute to public life, and still remain, if they so wish,\r\n\r\noutside politics.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the UN recently did an excellent study on the\r\n\r\nprospects for social development in Asia and the Pacific into\r\n\r\nthe 21st century.  With your permission, I wish to quote from\r\n\r\nthe part on \"Strengthening civil society\".  I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Civil society, being the range of non-government\r\n\r\nassociations  in  which  people .  come  together  to  fulfil\r\n\r\ncertain  needs, pursue certain goals and participate actively\r\n\r\nin  the  affairs  of the state is an essential  component  of\r\n\r\nsocial development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take but a few examples of its role: civil society\r\n\r\nmediates  the  people's  concerns  to  the  state,  so   that\r\n\r\ngovernment in its work can reflect the realities of  people's\r\n\r\nsituations  and their concerns; . civil society reflects  and\r\n\r\nupholds  the  cultural  values on which  the  functioning  of\r\n\r\nsociety  depends; and . civil society is the stage  on  which\r\n\r\nthe different ethnic, religious and cultural groups that make\r\n\r\nup  a  society  learn to understand and live in harmony  with\r\n\r\neach other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the role of government towards civil\r\n\r\nsociety,  the Report continues that civil society  will  only\r\n\r\nplay a crucial role \"if it is enabled by the State to play  a\r\n\r\ncentral  and constructive role in society.\"  It concludes  by\r\n\r\nsaying that  \"It is ultimately up to the state structures  to\r\n\r\nincorporate a place for civil society, and hence the  people,\r\n\r\nwithin the system of governance.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh has already touched on several of the\r\n\r\nfundamental  issues  that refer to  the  role  of  government\r\n\r\nversus the civil society, which I shall not speak on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is so heartening about the President's Address\r\n\r\nis  that the Government has committed itself precisely to the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  incorporating  a  place  for  civil  society   - indeed,  it  hopes  to  expand and  strengthen  it,  so  that\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  be  more  responsive,  so  that  people  can\r\n\r\nparticipate in the governance of their communities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of this approach cannot be overstated. I\r\n\r\nhope  that  every Singaporean will realise its  significance.\r\n\r\nEveryone should embrace it.  Everyone should want to make  it\r\n\r\nwork.   How  quickly a strong civil society can  be  achieved\r\n\r\ndepends  on the receptiveness of the people to this approach.\r\n\r\nIf  the  \"silent majority\" remain silent, or worse, take  the\r\n\r\nattitude (as reported in Saturday's Straits Times) that  they\r\n\r\nwill just rely on the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  do everything, then all the  good  intentions\r\n\r\nwill come to nought.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, I was disappointed to read in Saturday's\r\n\r\nStraits  Times several negative views from those interviewed.\r\n\r\nOne  believed that the approach would not last,  because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would soon decide, according to him, not  to  have\r\n\r\nthe  hassle  and go back to the old ways.  Yet  another  felt\r\n\r\nthat there is not sufficient empathy for others in need,  and\r\n\r\nthat  few Singaporeans will step forward.  One mentioned that\r\n\r\nthe    perception   is   that   volunteering   is   a   \"side\r\n\r\npreoccupation\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that in time to come, Singaporeans will\r\n\r\nregard  volunteer  work  not as a \"side  preoccupation\",  but\r\n\r\nrather  as  an avocation, that is, a calling.  One  can  plan\r\n\r\none's  vocation  together with an avocation, and  one  should\r\n\r\nstart early.  For example, if one were in business, one could\r\n\r\ndiversify and cultivate an interest in the arts or the media.\r\n\r\nIt  would be a fulfilling experience, and one can be seen  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  the  advancement of the  arts  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere  are  many  other ways and many other volunteer  groups\r\n\r\nthat one could join in pursuing such avocations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the coin would be the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the Government.  The Straits Times reported\r\n\r\nthat  there  is a perceived lack of trust between people  and\r\n\r\nGovernment,  as  well as Singaporeans' over-reliance  on  the\r\n\r\nstate.  I actually find these views to be inconsistent  -  if\r\n\r\nSingaporeans do not trust the Government, then it is unlikely\r\n\r\nthat  they  would want to rely on it, let alone  \"over-rely\".\r\n\r\nThe  inference must be that some may feel that the Government\r\n\r\ndoes  not trust them, and therefore they should avoid getting\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  civil  society.  This is a  misperception  that\r\n\r\nshould be immediately corrected and thrown aside by those  in\r\n\r\nauthority.    Many   volunteers  we   know   in   the   civil\r\n\r\norganisations now do not belong to any political  party,  and\r\n\r\nthey   contribute  substantially  to  the  success  of  these\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I end on a personal note. I came to Singapore in\r\n\r\nthe mid-70s, recruited by the University.  To me and my wife,\r\n\r\nSingapore was the preferred choice, and still is.   Then,  as\r\n\r\nit  is  now, an island of opportunity, a place where we could\r\n\r\nraise  a  family  and have good careers.  We  have  not  been\r\n\r\nwrong.   Some friends pointed to America - the United  States\r\n\r\nstill  remains  the  Promised Land for many,  including  some\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  I believe strongly that soon, with  programmes\r\n\r\nsuch  as  that outlined in the President's Address, and  with\r\n\r\nthe  commitment by all sectors - the public, private and  the\r\n\r\npeople sectors - Singapore too will be regarded by all as the\r\n\r\nPromised  Land.  Let us try not to be negative and  all  work\r\n\r\ntogether to make it so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Dr Ow Chin</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while we celebrate our achievements\r\n\r\nover the last four decades, we should not forget how just  34\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  a  small country with no natural  resources  was\r\n\r\nsuddenly  cut  off from its natural hinterland  and  made  to\r\n\r\nstruggle  for  survival.  Neither should  we  forget  what  a\r\n\r\ndivisive   society  we  used  to  have,  with  the  communist\r\n\r\ninsurgence  and  communalist riots of the  1950s  and  1960s.\r\n\r\nReflecting  on  the  past  34 years  of  nation  building,  I\r\n\r\nconclude  that  our  current  success  is  built  on  careful\r\n\r\nmanagement  of our strengths and vulnerabilities and  on  our\r\n\r\nability to adapt and adjust to changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our vulnerabilities have not disappeared, and it is to\r\n\r\nour  own  peril  if we choose to ignore them because  of  our\r\n\r\ncurrent  success.   While history offers useful  lessons,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to recognise that what has gone before cannot be simply\r\n\r\nextrapolated  into the future.  The 21st century  will  bring\r\n\r\nmore   changes  and  new  challenges,  both  internally   and\r\n\r\nexternally.  As we move into the new millennium, we  need  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  our  fundamental fault lines and vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nWe need to respond to constant changes and, at the same time,\r\n\r\ncome  out with creative strategies to further strengthen  the\r\n\r\nSingapore heartware, which the President\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  his Address said, was \"what really makes Singapore tick\".\r\n\r\nI ask a question: What constitutes the Singapore heartware?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is the trust between the Government and the\r\n\r\npeople.  The people need good government.  But the Government\r\n\r\ncannot succeed without a cohesive and responsive people.  The\r\n\r\npeople must feel and believe that the Government has governed\r\n\r\nthe country in their own long-term interest and for their own\r\n\r\nbenefit.   It was over time that the people saw the  concrete\r\n\r\nresults that the Government had delivered, and it was  during\r\n\r\na  serious crisis and how we had overcome a crisis, that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment established its authority and credibility, and the\r\n\r\npeople developed its trust and confidence in the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent economic crisis once again demonstrated to us\r\n\r\nand  to  the rest of the world the strength of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nheartware.   Our economy is able to turn around more  quickly\r\n\r\nthan  the  other  economies, because the people  trusted  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to provide the leadership and to make  the  right\r\n\r\ndecisions,  and the people cooperated with the Government  to\r\n\r\nmake  the  necessary sacrifices to get us out of the economic\r\n\r\ncrisis.   Together, we did it in 1987; we have done it  again\r\n\r\nin 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, over the past 40 years, a strong unspoken social\r\n\r\ncontract has developed between the Government and our people.\r\n\r\nAs  our  society  develops, as our  population  becomes  more\r\n\r\neducated  and  sophisticated, and as our environment  becomes\r\n\r\nincreasingly  complex,  this social contract  would  have  to\r\n\r\nevolve accordingly.  Greater involvement of, and consultation\r\n\r\nwith  the  people,  would help deepen the trust  between  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the people, and help strengthen the  Singapore\r\n\r\nheartware.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, another component of the Singapore heartware is\r\n\r\nthe  trust  between  the people of Singapore,  despite  their\r\n\r\ndifferences  in  race,  language, religion,  age,  income  or\r\n\r\neducation.   Singapore is a young nation.  Our  people  trace\r\n\r\ntheir roots\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  great civilisations and religions of the world.   We\r\n\r\ncarry  with  us the heritage and history from our  ancestors.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not possible nor desirable just to discard these  and\r\n\r\nsay:  \"Let  us start from scratch, let us all be Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand  abandon our cultural roots as Chinese, Malays,  Indians,\r\n\r\nor  Eurasians\".   It will be tragic if we lose  our  cultural\r\n\r\nroots  and values, as we will lose a stabiliser in the  midst\r\n\r\nof   rapid   changes.    National   identity   and   cultural\r\n\r\nconsciousness are not in conflict.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have enjoyed harmony over the past 35 years.\r\n\r\nPartly,  this is because the Government has institutionalised\r\n\r\nvarious  safeguards  such  as the  Presidential  Council  for\r\n\r\nMinority  Rights, the Maintenance of Religious  Harmony  Act,\r\n\r\nand the Group Representation Constituency (GRC).  Partly,  it\r\n\r\nis   because   many   organisations  and  the   majority   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  value this harmony and have made an  effort  to\r\n\r\npreserve  it.  I believe that today, for the heartlanders  in\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  estates, there is a greater level of tolerance  and\r\n\r\nacceptance among the different races and religions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But race and religion are deeply rooted, emotive issues.\r\n\r\nIt  was  not  so  long ago that we last had a  race  riot  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   For many of my generation and older generations,\r\n\r\nthe 1964 racial riots are still vivid in our minds.  While we\r\n\r\nwant to build 'a united nation of our people', we need to  be\r\n\r\ncautious  and  realistic.   It is one  thing  to  accept  and\r\n\r\nacknowledge one another.  But to trust one another requires a\r\n\r\nhigher level of confidence.  This is not an easy task, and it\r\n\r\ncannot be achieved overnight.  It takes time to build trust.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, as we draw in more foreign talents to\r\n\r\nsupplement  our local talents, help us grow our  economy  and\r\n\r\ncompete  globally, we will see more foreign  talents  in  our\r\n\r\ncommunity.   As we globalise, we will have some  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  will become more cosmopolitan and other Singaporeans who\r\n\r\nwill  become  more heartlander.  To prevent the formation  of\r\n\r\nnew  divides, we need to build acceptance and trust early  by\r\n\r\nproviding    more    opportunities   for   interaction    and\r\n\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our population ages, we also need to maintain social\r\n\r\ncohesion  between the young and the old.  Our  citizens  must\r\n\r\nplan for old age, and make those plans early so that they can\r\n\r\ngradually  ease into old age without a disruptive  change  in\r\n\r\nlifestyle.    The  family's  role  must  be  maintained   and\r\n\r\nreinforced so that the family continues to provide the  first\r\n\r\nline of care for its older members.  Community organisations,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  Community Development  Council,  can  help  by\r\n\r\nputting  in place programmes to encourage senior citizens  to\r\n\r\nremain  physically  healthy  and  mentally  active,  and   by\r\n\r\nproviding  them  with  opportunities for lifelong  engagement\r\n\r\nthrough  employment and volunteerism.  The  community  should\r\n\r\nwork together to form an integrated community support network\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  senior citizens remain active  and  vibrant\r\n\r\nmembers of the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our meritocratic system, opportunities are open to\r\n\r\neveryone   but  outcomes  and  rewards  depend  on   ability,\r\n\r\nenterprise and hard work.  Not all will do equally well.   We\r\n\r\nneed  to  help those who are less successful in our community\r\n\r\nso  that  they  do not feel marginalised or left  behind.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that to the less successful, helping is  not  merely\r\n\r\ngiving away welfare and relief funds to them.  As a matter of\r\n\r\nfact,  many  poor  people do not like  to  live  on  charity.\r\n\r\nHelping  them  to develop their children, building  up  their\r\n\r\nconfidence  and  their sense of dignity and self-reliance  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  have the means to support themselves  is  a\r\n\r\nbetter way to help these families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third crucial component of the Singapore heartware\r\n\r\nis  the  affinity that individual Singaporeans  feel  towards\r\n\r\nSingapore.   All  citizens  have helped  to  build  Singapore\r\n\r\nthrough their hard work and commitment.  All deserve to share\r\n\r\nin the country's success.  Over the years, the Government has\r\n\r\ngiven  all  Singaporeans  tangible shares  in  the  country's\r\n\r\nsuccess.   These  include HDB home ownership, HDB  upgrading,\r\n\r\nthe  share ownership scheme, CPF and Medisave top-ups.  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  these  tangible  asset enhancement  schemes  that  give\r\n\r\nSingaporeans a stake\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  our  success,  we  need  to look  into  intangible  asset\r\n\r\nenhancement  by developing emotional anchors that  will  bond\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to their country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These anchors can be strengthened if Singaporeans are\r\n\r\nmore  involved  as  participants in nation building,  feel  a\r\n\r\nstronger  attachment  to their families, friends,  neighbours\r\n\r\nand  community,  and  share a common destiny  and  future  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My generation and older generations of Singaporeans went\r\n\r\nthrough the struggle for independence and the difficulties of\r\n\r\nnation building in the earlier years.  Now, whenever we  hear\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  has  come up tops in some  area  or  that  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean  has  won some international award,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nstirring  of the heart.  This is because we fully  appreciate\r\n\r\nhow  extraordinary it is for Singapore, a small country  with\r\n\r\nno  natural hinterland, to survive, and not only survive, but\r\n\r\nalso  become a model of success for other countries.  We take\r\n\r\npride  in  our achievement as a nation.  We cherish  what  we\r\n\r\nhave  built over the years, our beliefs and our way of  life.\r\n\r\nWe feel bonded to Singapore because we took what was given to\r\n\r\nus, our strengths and vulnerabilities, and worked together to\r\n\r\nbuild  a  better future for ourselves, our families  and  our\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of emotional anchors is particularly\r\n\r\nimportant  for  the  younger generation who  has  only  known\r\n\r\nstability, growth and prosperity.  It will become  even  more\r\n\r\nimportant as Singapore becomes more international in the 21st\r\n\r\ncentury.   Tangible asset enhancement ties a  person  to  his\r\n\r\ncountry  with  a  purse  string.   On  its  own,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nsufficient to draw Singaporeans back to Singapore when better\r\n\r\nopportunities  offer  themselves  elsewhere  in  the   world.\r\n\r\nIntangible  asset  enhancement, on the other  hand,  bonds  a\r\n\r\nperson  to  his  country with a heartstring.  While  physical\r\n\r\nassets can be easily liquidated and capital and talents  will\r\n\r\nbecome increasingly mobile, it is less easy to erase emotions\r\n\r\nand  feelings  of  attachment that have  developed  over  the\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the role of Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment Councils (CDCs).  As Mayor of Tanjong  Pagar  CDC\r\n\r\nDistrict,  I would like to share my views with my  colleagues\r\n\r\non  how  I  think  the  CDC can help  develop  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nheartware.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen the trust between the Government and the\r\n\r\npeople,  the  CDC  can  provide  an  avenue  for  people   to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  the  nation's  affairs  in  a  concrete  and\r\n\r\npractical  way at the community level.  The CDCs  are  coming\r\n\r\nout  with  strategies to help prepare our residents  for  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  of  the  21st century posed by a  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy  and  ageing population.  We welcome anyone  who  can\r\n\r\ncontribute  ideas and, more importantly, who can  walk  their\r\n\r\ntalk.  CDCs are not merely talk-shops.  There is real work to\r\n\r\nbe  done  and we need people, who will roll up their sleeves,\r\n\r\nto  help their fellow Singaporeans meet the challenges of the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the CDC lies in its community network\r\n\r\nwith     voluntary    welfare    organisations,    grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations,  educational institutions,  self-help  groups,\r\n\r\nclan associations and businesses, etc.  Through its extensive\r\n\r\nnetwork,  the  CDC can play a part in building trust  between\r\n\r\nour  people.  Through its community activities, the  CDC  can\r\n\r\nprovide  more  opportunities  for  interaction  and  exchange\r\n\r\nbetween  people  of  different races,  languages,  religions,\r\n\r\nages,  income  and  education levels.

It is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough  working  together for a common good  that  a  common\r\n\r\ndestination  is  forged  and we feel  a  sense  of  emotional\r\n\r\nrootedness to our country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of heartware is a work for generations,\r\n\r\nbut  on the foundations that we have developed thus far,  let\r\n\r\nus build a world-class home for ourselves and our children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou  for  allowing me to join in the debate.  I  support  the\r\n\r\nmotion in the name of Mr Davinder Singh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed heartening to note that people will be the\r\n\r\nfocus  of  the  Government's policy in the  next  millennium.\r\n\r\nHaving participated in the parliamentary process for the last\r\n\r\nthree years, I see this Address by the President as the  most\r\n\r\nsignificant signal by the Government in valuing people as the\r\n\r\nmost  important  resource  of the country  and  I  feel  most\r\n\r\nexcited  about this major focus on people as the  centre  and\r\n\r\nthe heart of the Government's policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rightfully, the governments of the past, since the\r\n\r\nindependence  of  our country, have consistently  focused  on\r\n\r\neconomic  development, sharpening our competitive edge  as  a\r\n\r\ncountry  and on material and tangible things, and  while  the\r\n\r\npast  34  years  have  been extremely  challenging  to  bring\r\n\r\nSingapore  to where it is today, I feel that the  shift  from\r\n\r\neconomic  and  physical developments to  human  resource  and\r\n\r\nemotional developments will be far more challenging and  will\r\n\r\nrequire even stronger commitment and emotional involvement of\r\n\r\nall  leaders  who must be prepared to look beyond  short-term\r\n\r\nresults and have the ability to feel the pulse of the  people\r\n\r\nin a completely different way than our leaders have been used\r\n\r\nto in the past.  While it was very easy to measure the result\r\n\r\nof  our  economic  policies and physical  and  infrastructure\r\n\r\ndevelopment policies in terms of economic measures  like  the\r\n\r\nGDP,  purchasing  power,  ownership of  physical  goods  like\r\n\r\ntelephones, televisions and others and of physical\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment measures like the number of people owning houses,\r\n\r\nthe  educational attainment of Singaporeans and others, I  am\r\n\r\nsure  even our well-qualified leaders of today are scratching\r\n\r\ntheir  heads  as  to how we can measure the  success  of  our\r\n\r\nattainment  towards the Singapore Tribe which Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nGoh  Chok Tong hopes to develop for Singapore over the  long-term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have set the motion and are starting to gain\r\n\r\nmomentum  towards setting up the Singapore Tribe  and  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  this  debate is the third major  milestone  towards\r\n\r\nthis journey, the first being when Prime Minister Goh in 1997\r\n\r\nmade  a  call for a vision focusing on heartware. The  second\r\n\r\nmilestone was the S21 debate in Parliament this year and  now\r\n\r\nthis  is  the third milestone, our debate on the Presidential\r\n\r\nAddress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is one example of a success story of\r\n\r\nearly nation-building of a multi-racial, multi-religious  and\r\n\r\nmulti-ethnic society where everyone, no matter what  race  or\r\n\r\nbackground, has equal opportunity to participate and  succeed\r\n\r\nand  contribute.   However, we must be  willing  to  question\r\n\r\nwhether this will remain the same or further improve  in  the\r\n\r\nnext  one or two generations of Singaporeans. Sadly, the odds\r\n\r\nare  against us as evidenced by the problems seen in  similar\r\n\r\ncountries around the world and Yugoslavia comes first to  our\r\n\r\nmind. A strong government kept Yugoslavia together, but  only\r\n\r\nafter  45 years, the tragedy happened in that country  and  I\r\n\r\nsuggest three possible reasons why this happened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, possibly because people remained at peace because\r\n\r\nof  government  policies  which compelled  them  to  maintain\r\n\r\nracial  harmony without actually focusing on the  gelling  of\r\n\r\nhearts  or  emotions. Second, because of the undue  advantage\r\n\r\none  race may have had over another and when everyone had  to\r\n\r\nfight  for survival, tribe instincts prevailed, and  thirdly,\r\n\r\nbecause  of the deep rooted mistrust that was never addressed\r\n\r\nbecause  tough policies to ensure racial harmony  worked  and\r\n\r\ncomplacency in government had set in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  there was a lack of focus on enhancing emotional  bonds.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  the  second example closer to home  happened  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia  recently,  and  similarly  where  racial   harmony\r\n\r\nseemingly existed for slightly over 30 years, again  under  a\r\n\r\nstrong  government.  Once again, when the  strong  government\r\n\r\ncollapsed,  so  did  the weak thread that bound  the  various\r\n\r\nraces together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to question whether the same tragedy\r\n\r\nwill  face  us should Singapore one day see a weak government\r\n\r\nin  office.  While I have full confidence  that  the  PAP  is\r\n\r\ncommitted   to  promote  and  improve  racial  and  religious\r\n\r\nharmony,  I worry that approach has been more skewed  towards\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  policies and legislation as the main  means  of\r\n\r\nachieving these. While this must be the first right  step,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  we  have  not focused, as we rightly  should,  on\r\n\r\nbuilding   of  emotional  bonds  and  in  strengthening   the\r\n\r\nheartware  of  Singaporeans.  Sir, we have been  touting  the\r\n\r\nexperience of hardships and the real example of racial  riots\r\n\r\nthat  happened right in our doorsteps as reasons for  caution\r\n\r\nagainst  complacency and for the tough policies that we  have\r\n\r\nin place.  I feel that this approach is increasingly becoming\r\n\r\nless effective in driving home the intended message.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister first talked about the Singapore\r\n\r\nTribe,  many  people doubted such a tribe  will  ever  evolve\r\n\r\nusing  history  as  a  reason.   In  fact,  I  was  a  little\r\n\r\ndisappointed  at the tone of caution against the  unrealistic\r\n\r\nexpectations  of the S21 vision which took us more  than  one\r\n\r\nyear to formulate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, again I am a bit disappointed that no commitment\r\n\r\nhas  been  made  by  the Government in further  defining  the\r\n\r\nstructure  and  plans  for  a  Singapore  Tribe  that  is  so\r\n\r\nessential in strengthening the thread that binds the  various\r\n\r\nraces  together.  No matter how difficult the task seems,  we\r\n\r\nmust start today. There are no concrete plans to maximise the\r\n\r\noverlapping areas of the various races, as the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas raised the issue, and in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   eventual  blending  of  these  common  areas  so   that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  of  the future will see less  of  a  difference\r\n\r\namong  each  other  in  these areas while  maintaining  their\r\n\r\ndistinctiveness in areas like religion and cultures that  are\r\n\r\nquite impossible to blend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I see many more years of strong Government with\r\n\r\ngreat  policies  that  make racial and  religious  harmony  a\r\n\r\nreality  in  Singapore,  I do not  want  to  leave  the  true\r\n\r\nemotional  bonding to chance because I feel complacency  will\r\n\r\nset  in  among  all of us when a certain policy  or  approach\r\n\r\nseems to work in good times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, complacency in Government could happen because\r\n\r\npolicies  and  legislation are easy to define  and  implement\r\n\r\nwhile  working  on  the  more different  aspects  of  nation-building like building emotional bonds takes time and  cannot\r\n\r\nshow  results quickly.  Secondly, the population  taking  cue\r\n\r\nfrom   Government  policies  that  a  superficial  bond   and\r\n\r\ndependence  on  legislation  is  sufficient  and   hence   no\r\n\r\nadditional effort has to be put in to bond the softer  aspect\r\n\r\nof  relationship building. Sir, during the economic crisis in\r\n\r\nthe past two years, we did see some signs of the strain where\r\n\r\nracial  discrimination in employment and  the  issue  of  SAP\r\n\r\nschools were raised.  I feel that these are two signals  that\r\n\r\nwe  still  have  a  long way to go to build  emotional  bonds\r\n\r\nnecessary to establish a true Singapore Tribe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the direction set by the President does focus on\r\n\r\npeople,  nothing has been mentioned on how we can  strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  common  elements of the various races  and  how  we  can\r\n\r\nincrease these common areas over time.  I too believe that we\r\n\r\ncan create a Singapore Tribe, not by legislation alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like next to focus on how we can\r\n\r\nsuccessfully participate in a knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President mentioned about the need for every\r\n\r\nSingaporean to benefit from the knowledge-based economy  that\r\n\r\nis coming our way.  I would like to address two areas which I\r\n\r\nfeel are of utmost importance for us to succeed in this area.\r\n\r\nFirstly, our system of education and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nselection  of  leaders; and secondly, on how  our  Government\r\n\r\nagencies need to change with time for us to establish  world-class companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our system of selection based on academic\r\n\r\nexcellence  is in danger of creating an elitist and  a  class\r\n\r\nsystem.   Slowly but surely, an old boys network may  develop\r\n\r\nand  who  now hold positions in Government, in the  statutory\r\n\r\nboards  and  in Government linked companies.  As I understand\r\n\r\nit,  our  system selects people at a very early stage,  based\r\n\r\nmainly on their educational attainment which was a result  of\r\n\r\ndoing well in examinations.  While the CEP (Current Estimated\r\n\r\nPotential)  is  a  good system to classify the  potential  of\r\n\r\npeople  in  their  careers, I feel  we  have  failed  in  its\r\n\r\nimplementation.   Scholars are placed in an accelerated  path\r\n\r\nthat  is lined with gold.  They are assigned mentors and have\r\n\r\na  helping hand guiding them so that their chances of  making\r\n\r\nmistakes  are reduced.  On the other hand, those who  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  such  a  good track record in academic  excellence  are\r\n\r\nimmediately assigned a ceiling and limits are drawn too early\r\n\r\non  how  far  they are assessed to be able  to  go  in  their\r\n\r\ncareer.   This  is  especially  prevalent  in  our  uniformed\r\n\r\nservices  liked the Armed Forces and the Police  Force  where\r\n\r\nthere is a clear distinction drawn between the career path of\r\n\r\nscholars and those of non-scholars, and the non-scholars call\r\n\r\nthemselves peasants or farmers because they think they are in\r\n\r\nthe  lowest rung of society in the Armed Forces or the Police\r\n\r\nForce.   It is self destructive for people who are told  that\r\n\r\nthey  are not good enough to make it. Worse still, by  virtue\r\n\r\nof  how  they are assigned their CEP ranking, they  are  told\r\n\r\nimmediately that they are not good enough to make it  to  the\r\n\r\ntop.  Logic tells us that the best soldiers need not be those\r\n\r\nwith good academic results.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not criticising our current leaders or civil\r\n\r\nservants, most of whom came through the same path.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nI  feel  many  of  them  are sharp and  bright,  but  I  feel\r\n\r\ncollectively the team is not good enough to steer us  through\r\n\r\nthe  future where the challenges of a knowledge-based economy\r\n\r\nneed people of various talents,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabilities  and  experiences to be successful  as  a  country.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have too many people of the same mould  in  the\r\n\r\nkey decision making positions.  I feel that we need to change\r\n\r\nthe  system of selection and promotion in Government to  give\r\n\r\nmore  people opportunities and recognise that people of  many\r\n\r\nbackgrounds and talents can do better jobs than those of  the\r\n\r\nsame  background and that non-academic measures  are  equally\r\n\r\nimportant as those of academic measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another system that is quite destructive,\r\n\r\nespecially  for the self-esteem of people, is  the  education\r\n\r\nsystem  and how we stream our children at such an early  age.\r\n\r\nI  am  glad  to  note  that  in his  Address,  the  President\r\n\r\nmentioned  that changes will be made in the education  system\r\n\r\nto  prepare  the  next  generation of  Singaporeans  for  the\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy. We have to recognise  that  the  KBE\r\n\r\nwill  require people of various talents getting  together  to\r\n\r\nimprove  our  competitive edge.  In my opinion, everyone  can\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  the  KBE.   The new  Internet  economy  will\r\n\r\nrequire  not  only  academic abilities but  also  creativity,\r\n\r\npassion,  knowledge of the psyche of people and  communities.\r\n\r\nAs  such,  we  must recognise that every child  will  have  a\r\n\r\ntalent that we will need and collectively, we will be able to\r\n\r\ncompete  in  the world arena.  To enable such an environment,\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  either  do  away with the  early  streaming  of\r\n\r\nchildren by ability levels based on academic excellence or to\r\n\r\nmodify  the  system to ensure that we allow our  children  to\r\n\r\ninteract  with each other, no matter how well they  score  in\r\n\r\nexaminations.  The  streaming  at  Primary  4,  while   well-intentioned, has, in my opinion, been negative in developing,\r\n\r\nrecognising  and  rewarding children  of  differing  talents.\r\n\r\nWhile we pursue to achieve excellence as a nation, we have to\r\n\r\nrecognise that in the future, people whom we classify as  the\r\n\r\nslower  track  learners  and  achievers  may  make  a  bigger\r\n\r\ndifference  on  how Singapore will compete as a  first  world\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we aim to give every child ten years of primary\r\n\r\nand secondary school education, I hope we will make these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10  years  the same for every child and if we have to  stream\r\n\r\nthem, I call on the Government to at least mix them up in the\r\n\r\nsame class so that each child will learn that not everyone is\r\n\r\nthe  same  and  that  a good team is made  up  of  people  of\r\n\r\ndifferent talents and abilities.  We must learn to give up  a\r\n\r\nlittle efficiency in our system to allow for the blending  of\r\n\r\nhearts   and   to  let  our  children  learn   from   other's\r\n\r\naspirations.   This  is  the  only  way  we  can  teach  each\r\n\r\nSingaporean  to  be  a  little  cosmopolitan  and  a   little\r\n\r\nheartlander.  Let us not allow our system of education create\r\n\r\na bipolar society of cosmopolitans and heartlanders that will\r\n\r\nbe destructive for nation-building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is indeed heartening to see a focused effort to\r\n\r\nhelp  nurture  Singaporean companies  to  become  world-class\r\n\r\ncompanies.    However,  I  see  some  fundamental  structural\r\n\r\nproblems in our system and without changing these, I  am  not\r\n\r\nsure  we  will  be able to achieve the target of transforming\r\n\r\n100 of our local companies into world-class ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first problem I see is the way we select the\r\n\r\nPromising  Local  Enterprises (PLEs).  As  I  understand  it,\r\n\r\ncompanies  only make it to the PLE status after a  number  of\r\n\r\nyears of track record, focusing on revenue and profit growth.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  there are a number of other traditional  criteria\r\n\r\nlike  the  number  of people, the number of  years,  physical\r\n\r\nassets  and  so on used to select such PLEs.  In my  opinion,\r\n\r\nthe current criteria used are outdated and archaic especially\r\n\r\nin  the  emerging Internet economy that spans across physical\r\n\r\nboundaries.  Sir, companies with market capitalisation bigger\r\n\r\nthan   Singapore's  GDP  are  those  of  the   Internet   and\r\n\r\nInformation  Technology economies.  Such companies  are  also\r\n\r\ncapable  of  changing the way business  is  done  around  the\r\n\r\nworld.   My point is that by the current method of selection,\r\n\r\nnone of the 100 PLEs selected will include Internet or start-up companies of such nature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second problem is that while EDB has been given the\r\n\r\ntask in nurturing the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PLEs into world-class companies, it is the NSTB that  is\r\n\r\ngiven  the task of promoting technopreneurship and supporting\r\n\r\nstart-ups.  What we really need is one body focusing on local\r\n\r\nstart-ups  who  will  be able to follow the  growth  of  such\r\n\r\ncompanies until they become global players.  Having seen  how\r\n\r\nthings  work  in the Government agencies, I am not  confident\r\n\r\nthat  we  will  be  able to identify the right  companies  to\r\n\r\nnurture to become world-class.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we have a problem of heavy dependence on\r\n\r\nGovernment and in the bureaucracy in our Government agencies,\r\n\r\nmaking  them too slow to react to changes and hence  becoming\r\n\r\ntoo   slow   in  making  the  necessary  changes  needed   to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  the  knowledge-based  economy.  Sir,  global\r\n\r\nplayers  do things differently and if we look at two distinct\r\n\r\nexamples  of  governance, my point is  quite  obvious  if  we\r\n\r\ncompare  the Japanese system of a strong bureaucracy to  that\r\n\r\nof the American system of transparency and the private sector\r\n\r\ndriven  initiatives.   Looking  at  the  performance  of  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  and the American economies, I think it  is  obvious\r\n\r\nwhich  system  will work if we really want to  become  global\r\n\r\nplayers.  My contention is that we need a group of people  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government  agencies  who  are  more  than  experts   in\r\n\r\nGovernment policies.  They must also be knowledgeable in  the\r\n\r\nworkings  of  the knowledge-based economy and  they  must  be\r\n\r\nwilling to change things on the fly as opposed to our current\r\n\r\nslow  pace  of  changes.  The ability  to  adapt  and  change\r\n\r\npolicies  fast  will  be  the  necessary  ingredients  to  be\r\n\r\nsuccessful in a knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, and finally, I notice that we have a self-fulfilling system where a safe approach is taken by many of\r\n\r\nour  Government  agencies and also by  some  of  our  private\r\n\r\nentities  like the press.  For example, I have seen  problems\r\n\r\nfaced by many new start-up companies in getting support  from\r\n\r\nthe  various  agencies.  Every one of  them  is  waiting  for\r\n\r\nsomeone  else to make an endorsement for such a  company.   I\r\n\r\ncan  understand  that  such  agencies  do  not  want  to   be\r\n\r\nassociated with picking the wrong company, but I feel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  some of them are just too conservative and are not bold\r\n\r\nenough  to  take the initiative to show support for companies\r\n\r\nwithout  a track record.  More often than not, most of  these\r\n\r\nSingapore  agencies are late in recognising  such  companies,\r\n\r\ndoing  so  only  after  some foreign agency  or  company  has\r\n\r\nrecognised the value of such companies.  This self-fulfilling\r\n\r\nsystem  of  just  picking winners has to  change  if  we  are\r\n\r\nserious  about  being  a  key player in  the  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude by saying that while I am\r\n\r\nencouraged by the broad focus of the Government on the people\r\n\r\nsector, I however feel that we have not done enough to define\r\n\r\nhow  we  are  going to achieve success in these  areas.   The\r\n\r\nareas  identified  do  not  go deep  enough  to  address  the\r\n\r\nemotional  aspects  of nation building.  It  is  a  difficult\r\n\r\ntask, but we must make our first step now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br>1.46 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou for allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I listened to the 20-minute speech of the\r\n\r\nPresident, somehow the speech sounded empty to me.  Something\r\n\r\nbasic  was missing despite all the good things said   -   the\r\n\r\nGovernment wanting to be people focused, to promote life-long\r\n\r\nlearning, to encourage a knowledge-based society, so  on  and\r\n\r\nso  forth.  At the end of it all, to me, it was still  a  PAP\r\n\r\nprogramme  and  not really a nation-building programme.   The\r\n\r\nspeech  sounded  more  like a PAP vote-catching  exercise,  a\r\n\r\nprogramme  to preserve the PAP and to keep the PAP in  power,\r\n\r\nrather than a programme to prepare Singapore to compete  with\r\n\r\nthe industrial western developed nations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was not a word in the President's Speech which\r\n\r\nsays  that  his Government was going to promote democracy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and to make Singapore a truly democratic  country.\r\n\r\nTo me, Singapore has to be a vibrant, dynamic democratic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry  if  we  are  to  enter the league  of  the  advanced\r\n\r\nindustrialised  nations,  and  to  make  Singapore  a   truly\r\n\r\nprosperous  country.  If the President  had  only  said  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  wanted to be a truly democratic  nation,  then  we\r\n\r\nwould all know exactly where Singapore is heading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the moment I am still unsure where Singapore is\r\n\r\nheading.  Are we going to have a more open democratic society\r\n\r\nor  continue to have a closed paternalistic society?  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is serious on what it says about wanting  a  more\r\n\r\nvibrant  and dynamic society, wanting the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nto  be creative and innovative and to build a knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy  in  Singapore, then the Government must  opt  for  a\r\n\r\ntruly democratic society.  But the Government does not appear\r\n\r\nto  be doing so.  One example was when soon after Mr Goh Chok\r\n\r\nTong  was made the Prime Minister, he said that he wanted  to\r\n\r\nmake  Singapore  a participatory democracy.  Many  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  were  really excited about his  pronouncement  and\r\n\r\nwere  looking  forward to steps taken by  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nimplement  that policy, but nothing came out of it.   It  was\r\n\r\njust  talk  and nothing else.  Singapore remains  a  tightly-controlled society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened was that the Government expanded the\r\n\r\nFeedback  Unit.   That  was  all.   The  expansion   of   the\r\n\r\nactivities of the Feedback Unit cannot be said to be evidence\r\n\r\nof  promotion  of participatory democracy in Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nFeedback Unit is not a unit to promote democracy.   It  is  a\r\n\r\ndevice  for  the  Government to get feedback, information  or\r\n\r\nintelligence from the people.  The Government,  by  the  way,\r\n\r\nhad  to obtain information through the Feedback Unit, because\r\n\r\nits  attempt  to get direct feedback from the  ground  proved\r\n\r\nunreliable,  as  shown  in the 1991 general  elections.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  was told that the ground was sweet in that  year,\r\n\r\nbut  that  information was wrong.  The ground  was  not  that\r\n\r\nsweet.   Four  Opposition Members were elected and  many  PAP\r\n\r\ncandidates won only narrowly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example of the Government not promoting\r\n\r\ndemocracy is to maintain its tight control of the people of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The Internal Security Act (ISA) and all the other\r\n\r\nharsh  laws are still intact.  People in Singapore have  seen\r\n\r\nhow  the  ISA  was  used  to  detain  a  Singaporean  in  the\r\n\r\nopposition  for  about  23 years.  And  on  another  separate\r\n\r\noccasion, how after the last general elections, an opposition\r\n\r\nmember was sued by PAP Ministers and was asked to pay damages\r\n\r\namounting to about $8.3 million.  On appeal, the damages were\r\n\r\nreduced to $3.6 million.  Although the opposition member  was\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in  his appeal, the payment of  $3.6  million  is\r\n\r\nstill  a  very  large  sum of money by  any  standards.   The\r\n\r\nopposition  member  did not pay the damages  and  he  is  now\r\n\r\nliving abroad in Australia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such harsh political conditions in Singapore,\r\n\r\nthere   must   be  some  element  of  fear  pervading   among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   If  that is so, then there exist  restraining\r\n\r\nforces which curb Singaporeans to be creative and innovative.\r\n\r\nThe Government must first remove those restraining forces and\r\n\r\nabolish the Internal Security Act.  That harsh law is out  of\r\n\r\ndate.   We  are all progressing into the new millennium.   We\r\n\r\nall  want  new  freedoms.   We  want  a  new  spirit,  a  new\r\n\r\nenvironment  to  create,  to  innovate,  to  build  a   truly\r\n\r\nprosperous  Singapore.   I wonder why  the  Government  still\r\n\r\nneeds  to  cling on to such a draconian law.  The  Government\r\n\r\ndid not use the ISA to deal with an opposition member when he\r\n\r\nspoke  at Raffles Place without a permit.  The existing  laws\r\n\r\nwere  sufficient to deal with that problem.   I  believe  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was  quite  proud not to  use  the  ISA  on  that\r\n\r\noccasion.   The Government has enough laws to deal  with  the\r\n\r\nopposition.   The time for the abolition of the  ISA  is  now\r\n\r\noverdue.  The ISA does not resonate with the new millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another restraining force is our education system. Our\r\n\r\neducation system must be overhauled, so that our children can\r\n\r\nbe  placed  in  a democratic environment where  they  have  a\r\n\r\nbetter chance to grow up to be creative.  At the moment,  our\r\n\r\neducation system is based on an authoritarian philosophy  and\r\n\r\nnot a democratic one.  The philosophy in Singapore is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nauthoritarianism,  because  our  philosophy   is   based   on\r\n\r\nConfucianism.  Confucianism teaches obedience.  Citizens must\r\n\r\nobey the ruler of the state.  The children or members of  the\r\n\r\nhousehold  must obey the head of the family.   The wife  must\r\n\r\nobey  the husband.  The younger must obey the older.  And  in\r\n\r\nthe  family,  there is a hierarchy.  This kind of  philosophy\r\n\r\nsmacks   of   authoritarianism.    If   our   philosophy   is\r\n\r\nauthoritarianism, then this philosophy shall  be  implemented\r\n\r\nin our schools.  A system of education which is authoritarian\r\n\r\nteaches  the  children  to obey and does  not  encourage  the\r\n\r\nchildren  to question their teachers.  This type of education\r\n\r\nsystem  is  a  one-way  communication  system.   The  teacher\r\n\r\nteaches,  the  pupils  learn.  The teacher  is  the  one  who\r\n\r\nimparts the knowledge, and the pupils receive them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the authoritarian system, the pupils' brains are\r\n\r\nlike  receptacles  which are stuffed with  knowledge  by  the\r\n\r\nteacher.   There  is  very  little  interaction  between  the\r\n\r\nteacher  and  the pupils.  Whereas, on the other hand,  under\r\n\r\nthe democratic system of education, the pupils are encouraged\r\n\r\nto  question  their teacher.  The pupils are  told  that  the\r\n\r\nteacher  is not always right.  Under this system, the  pupils\r\n\r\nare   not   passive  recipients  of  knowledge   but   active\r\n\r\nparticipants  of  the  process  of  learning.    Pupils   are\r\n\r\nencouraged  to  do  research and their  learning  process  is\r\n\r\nproject based.  With this kind of system, the inquisitiveness\r\n\r\nof  the pupils is enhanced.  Pupils are encouraged to reason,\r\n\r\nto  think and to acquire knowledge for themselves.  They  are\r\n\r\nnot  spoon-fed.  This kind of system makes the pupils  to  be\r\n\r\nmore  creative  and innovative and encourages initiative  and\r\n\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The West, in particular the USA, has this kind of\r\n\r\neducation system.  It would appear that if Singapore wants to\r\n\r\ncompete  successfully  with the western developed  countries,\r\n\r\nthen  Singapore  must  revamp its education  system  from  an\r\n\r\nauthoritarian  type of education system to a democratic  one.\r\n\r\nAnything  less than that will not give Singapore a chance  to\r\n\r\nenter  the  league  of  the industrialised  western  nations.\r\n\r\nDemocracy  is not a luxury for Singapore.  It is a  necessity\r\n\r\nif it wants to be vibrant, dynamic and creative.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I regret that the President did not say that we\r\n\r\nshall have first to achieve a democratic society, for it is a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  society which is the foundation, the bedrock,  in\r\n\r\nwhich  Vision  21  will  be built  on.   So  I  call  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to have more democracy to ensure that  Vision  21\r\n\r\nsucceeds.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto  join  my  colleagues in thanking the  President  for  his\r\n\r\nAddress  which charts out the initiatives we have undertaken,\r\n\r\nand  the  challenges we have to rise to, in order  to  enable\r\n\r\nSingapore to succeed in the next millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chiam has commented that the President's 20-minute Speech lacked substance or was too general. I think\r\n\r\nwe  have to be reminded by Mr Davinder Singh again that it is\r\n\r\nmerely  a mission statement, at best, a statement of an  end,\r\n\r\nwhat  we  want  to achieve. We have to be reminded  that  the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Speech  is supported  by  the  Addenda  to  the\r\n\r\nSpeech,  and  these are the means to an end, ie, the  various\r\n\r\nMinistries' programmes.  And we are here to debate  not  just\r\n\r\nthe  end,  but  the means to an end, the various  Ministries'\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am greatly encouraged that there is a clear\r\n\r\nemphasis on the importance of recognising and developing  our\r\n\r\npeople,  as  well  as  continuing our  open  door  policy  to\r\n\r\ntalented  people  from  abroad who  can  also  contribute  to\r\n\r\nSingapore's development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two years, when Asia had been engulfed in a\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis, have been a testing time for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House would have personal experience  during\r\n\r\ntheir regular meet-the-people sessions of increased incidence\r\n\r\nof   residents   with   financial   hardship   and   domestic\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  as a direct consequence of this  crisis.   Our\r\n\r\nnewspapers  have reported retrenchments on a scale  not  seen\r\n\r\nsince 1985.  And we know personally of friends and colleagues\r\n\r\nwho, one way or another, have been negatively impacted by the\r\n\r\nturmoil around us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are lessons that we can draw from these last\r\n\r\ntwo years.  Indeed, in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresidential Address, we have recognised that the  sturdiness\r\n\r\nand  resilience of our society, our political  structure  and\r\n\r\nour  economic soundness had stood us well during this crisis.\r\n\r\nPost  crisis,  we are now truly in a stronger  position,  but\r\n\r\nwhere has the strengthening come from?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the financial crisis has embedded the trust\r\n\r\nbetween  the  3 Ps - the public, the private and  the  people\r\n\r\nsectors.   We have renewed the social contract between  these\r\n\r\nthree  sectors  and  have shown tremendous resilience  during\r\n\r\nthis  period.  We have used our community bonds and the basic\r\n\r\nbuilding  block  of  our society, ie,  the  family,  to  hold\r\n\r\ntogether  the  fragile social fabric of a society.   We  have\r\n\r\nworked   closely  together  through  the  tested   tripartite\r\n\r\nstructure of the Government, the employers and the unions  to\r\n\r\nrespond   efficiently   and  cohesively   to   the   economic\r\n\r\nchallenges.   We  have  not  taken  the  easy  and   painless\r\n\r\nsolutions,  but  instead  pushed  ahead  with  restructuring,\r\n\r\nreform,  tightening of our belts and taking painful steps  to\r\n\r\nregain  our  competitiveness.  We have also  sought  ways  to\r\n\r\nwiden the feedback channels and encourage development of  the\r\n\r\ncivil  society.  More importantly, these last two years  have\r\n\r\nbrought together the post-independence generation and  forged\r\n\r\nmany elements of bonds and trust across the board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not often that societies have had to undergo\r\n\r\nlarge  externally driven changes and come out better for  it.\r\n\r\nBy   taking  the  bitter  medicine,  and  not  shunning  from\r\n\r\ndifficult  decisions, we have built consensus  and  developed\r\n\r\nbonds  of  trust  throughout our  society.   We  have  indeed\r\n\r\nstrengthened  the foundation for the next century.   This  is\r\n\r\nthe real success story of the last two years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need to do now, Sir, in going forward is to\r\n\r\nensure  that the trust developed between the  3  Ps   -   the\r\n\r\npublic,  the  private and the people sectors -  continues  to\r\n\r\ngrow.   As the President has pointed out, in the next century\r\n\r\nwe  can  only expect fiercer competition.  We have no  choice\r\n\r\nbut to constantly renew and maintain what we have.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President has outlined a number of initiatives\r\n\r\nto  continue  the  efforts  to  build  up  the  heartware  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  The proposals in the Singapore 21  Report  are\r\n\r\nslowly  but  surely taking root among our  civic  and  public\r\n\r\ninstitutions.   I believe the trust that we have  built  will\r\n\r\nenable  us  to succeed in the knowledge based economy  as  we\r\n\r\ncontinue  to energize Singaporeans to be active citizens  and\r\n\r\nparticipate fully in nation building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the main challenges before us today is the\r\n\r\ndistinction  between the heartlanders and the  cosmospolitans\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  first  raised  during  the  Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nNational  Day Rally this year.  Some people have objected  to\r\n\r\nthis labelling of Singaporeans, raising genuine concerns that\r\n\r\nthis could appear to be a divisive issue.  I beg to differ.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we are not trying to typecast or create a\r\n\r\ndichotomy   to  segregate  Singaporeans  or  classify   them.\r\n\r\nAlthough  we are all Singaporeans, some of us inevitably  are\r\n\r\nmore cosmopolitan in our outlook because of the nature of our\r\n\r\ntraining  and  work exposure.  Technology, the Internet,  the\r\n\r\nvarious print and news media by association plug us into  the\r\n\r\nglobal  economy,  the global culture and  society.   We  have\r\n\r\ndifferent   needs,  desires  and  benchmarks.   Others   have\r\n\r\ndifferent exposures in their daily lives and they may sing  a\r\n\r\nslightly different tune.  Broadly classified as heartlanders,\r\n\r\nthey  are  as Singaporean as the cosmopolitans are, and  both\r\n\r\nare as important to our country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of Singapore is as material to both these\r\n\r\nconstituents  as  it is dependent on both.  As  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nthe relationship is symbiotic.  There has to be trust between\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans in order to refine and develop  the  social\r\n\r\ncohesion that we have currently.  There has to be recognition\r\n\r\nof  the differences between the desires, ambitions and  needs\r\n\r\nof different Singaporeans so that we can identify them, cater\r\n\r\nto  them  and move ahead as a nation.  Globalization and  the\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy have the potential to widen  the  gap\r\n\r\nbetween these two, those\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  sprint on the technology and those who struggle with it.\r\n\r\nWe cannot run the risk of allowing this gap to widen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is unique in that we have had a meritocratic\r\n\r\nsystem  without  the worst effects of inequality  developing.\r\n\r\nThere  has been concerted effort to enable those who  require\r\n\r\nassistance the opportunity to move forward through a host  of\r\n\r\ncommunity,  Government  as  well as  civic  programmes.   Our\r\n\r\nheartlanders  must also seize the opportunities presented  to\r\n\r\nthem  in  the  form  of  Government-assisted  and  community-assisted  skills upgrading programmes.   The  trust  we  have\r\n\r\ndeveloped  is  forged on the basic belief that the  best  and\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in our society lend a helping hand to  those  who\r\n\r\nrequire  assistance.   This has to continue when we  consider\r\n\r\nthe heartlander and cosmopolitan distinction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that we develop avenues for\r\n\r\nheartlanders and cosmopolitans amongst us to interact so that\r\n\r\nthey  better  understand the issues and concerns that  affect\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Mutual understanding and trust can  be  forged\r\n\r\nso  that whilst we may march to different drums, we are  both\r\n\r\non  the  same plane and moving in the same direction  as  one\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to do this is to encourage more cosmopolitans to\r\n\r\nparticipate in grassroots activities.  Through this way, they\r\n\r\ncould interact more with the heartlanders who, I believe form\r\n\r\nthe  majority of our grassroots leaders.  Perhaps the  PA  or\r\n\r\nthe  CDCs  could actively reach out and design programmes  to\r\n\r\ncater  for more interactions.  Indeed, last Friday's  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes'  interview with the PA's new chief, Mr Ong Keng  Yong,\r\n\r\nis  indicative  of the potential role that PA could  play  by\r\n\r\nenergizing  the  organisation,  broadening  its  ambit,   and\r\n\r\nencouraging greater interaction between the cosmopolitans and\r\n\r\nthe heartlanders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also urge our Government-assisted organisations to\r\n\r\nplan   more  activities  to  encourage  foreign  talents   to\r\n\r\nassimilate into our society.  We understand the policy behind\r\n\r\nthe need to remain open and to attract the best human capital\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  our  quest to succeed in the next  millennium.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is only through integration and personal  contact\r\n\r\nthat  would allow bonds of trust and understanding to develop\r\n\r\nbetween   Singaporeans  and  these  new  additions   to   our\r\n\r\ncommunity.   It would provide opportunity as well  for  these\r\n\r\nforeign  talents to establish roots and make Singapore  their\r\n\r\nchoice home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civic institutions such as the voluntary welfare\r\n\r\norganisations,  the  arts  groups  and  even  the   religious\r\n\r\norganisations,   should  also  attempt   to   broaden   their\r\n\r\nmembership  base  so that the breadth of ideas  and  thinking\r\n\r\nwould  be  crystallised with the interest of all Singaporeans\r\n\r\nat heart instead of just voicing specific interests which may\r\n\r\nbe  inimical  to  society's interest as a whole.   We  should\r\n\r\nencourage  participation but avoid  the  pitfalls  of  single\r\n\r\nissue  lobby groups which, in some developed countries,  have\r\n\r\nheld  society's larger interest to ransom for myopic reasons,\r\n\r\nsuch as the gun lobby in the United  States.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the greatest levellers of society today is\r\n\r\nthe  arts  and culture.  As the GPC Chairman of  MITA,  I  am\r\n\r\nheartened by the commitment and resources that the Government\r\n\r\nis  putting into developing Singapore as a vibrant  city  for\r\n\r\nthe  arts,  and using arts as a catalyst to develop Singapore\r\n\r\ninto  the  Renaissance City of the future and yet maintaining\r\n\r\nour Singapore identity and multi-cultural heritage.  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nare  seeing  Singaporeans who are more  cosmopolitan-inclined\r\n\r\nparticipating in our arts festival.  I urge MITA to  step  up\r\n\r\nefforts to bring our arts activities to our HDB heartland  to\r\n\r\nreach out to our heartlanders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is through these soft issues that a uniquely\r\n\r\nSingaporean   heartbeat  would  develop.   This   Singaporean\r\n\r\nheartbeat  and identity will transcend both the heartlanders,\r\n\r\nthe  cosmopolitans and the large number of  Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nwill be living and working overseas in the new millennium.  I\r\n\r\nfurther   suggest  that  organisations  like  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nInternational  Foundation study and develop a brand  that  is\r\n\r\nclearly identifiable as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, that can gel all Singaporeans from afar and  at\r\n\r\nhome together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every extra helping hand counts. Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nwhatever their background, have diverse interests.   We  will\r\n\r\nrealise our full potential by contributing actively to  civic\r\n\r\nand  community  organisations.  When  the  next  crisis  hits\r\n\r\nSingapore, we would have developed a firm platform where  the\r\n\r\nroots of trust and a shared vision for all Singaporeans  will\r\n\r\nbind us together to weather the storm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I thank the President for setting the\r\n\r\nstage  for Singaporeans to rise to the challenge,  and  I  am\r\n\r\nsure we all will, to build our common future together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker\r\n\r\nSir,  I  support  the  motion standing  in  the  name  of  my\r\n\r\ncolleague, Mr Davinder Singh, thanking the President for  his\r\n\r\nSpeech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam said that there was no democracy in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  were  preparing  the  Singapore  21  Vision,  6,000\r\n\r\nSingaporeans were involved in the deliberations.  Besides,  a\r\n\r\nnumber of committees were set up to tackle the various issues\r\n\r\nof  an aging population, ranging from employment, healthcare,\r\n\r\ntransport, housing and so on.  A lot of people took  part  in\r\n\r\nthe  discussions. This is democracy.  When Mr Chiam mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  there was no democracy in Singapore, I do not know what\r\n\r\nhe meant by \"democracy\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past, when people met, they normally asked,\r\n\r\n\"Have  you taken your meal?\".  This shows that  people  cared\r\n\r\nfor their jobs.  Without a job they would not be able to have\r\n\r\nany  meal at all.  Even at the present moment, when  we  meet\r\n\r\npeople,  we  still  ask, \"Have you taken your  meal?\".   That\r\n\r\nimplies  job  security.  This is a matter that concerns  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  especially the middle aged  workers.   Without\r\n\r\njob, what is democracy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the economic crisis may be over and the number of\r\n\r\nretrenchments is also reducing. But there are still a lot  of\r\n\r\npeople who are worried about their job security.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen  we  talk with the workers and the residents,  the  main\r\n\r\nthing they are most concerned with is  whether they can  keep\r\n\r\ntheir rice bowls, especially for the middle-aged workers.  We\r\n\r\nask,  \"Where  are  you working?  Are you all  right  in  your\r\n\r\nwork?\"  Generally, the middle-aged Singaporean, whether he is\r\n\r\na  managerial,  technical or ordinary worker, would  normally\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Now,  times are bad.  It is not easy to keep  a  job.\"\r\n\r\nWhy  is it not easy?  Everybody feels that the transformation\r\n\r\nof  our  economy into a knowledge-based economy  has  brought\r\n\r\nabout  many  new  challenges.  Their jobs  no  longer  remain\r\n\r\nstatic all the time.  Managers and technicians have to  worry\r\n\r\nabout  new  challenges  in their jobs.   Many  companies  are\r\n\r\nstreamlining and downsizing their operation.  To the ordinary\r\n\r\nworkers,  their  job  security is  threatened.   Middle  aged\r\n\r\npeople  have  a  sense of crisis.  When will  they  be  axed?\r\n\r\nWhere  are  they  going  to find new  jobs?   For  the  self-employed, the worry is lower business turnover, and they  may\r\n\r\nhave  to  give  up their business and look for some  form  of\r\n\r\nemployment instead.  A canteen operator in a factory told  me\r\n\r\nthat  the  factory had retrenched a lot of workers.  Business\r\n\r\nat  his  canteen was severely affected. To carry on operating\r\n\r\nhis  canteen  business would mean carrying on  losing  money.\r\n\r\nGiving  up  the  operation  would  mean  being  out  of  job.\r\n\r\nSwitching to another line of business?  Without capital, what\r\n\r\ncan you do?  This is indeed a big problem!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you reach middle age, you may have a lot of\r\n\r\nadjustments  to  do.  Now, with the economic  transformation,\r\n\r\nthe impact on the middle-aged people is even greater.  How do\r\n\r\nwe  re-assure them?  How do we boost their confidence?   This\r\n\r\nis a matter of immediate concern to all of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his policy Speech, the President mentioned that there\r\n\r\nwas  opportunity for everyone in Singapore to  develop.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment would  also implement the manpower policy for life-long  learning.   We must look at the aspect of  middle  aged\r\n\r\nemployment  so that the people can enjoy their jobs  and  the\r\n\r\ncountry can prosper.  In\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManpower 21, the Ministry of Manpower wants the retraining of\r\n\r\nworkers  to  be undertaken by ITE.  This is good  because  it\r\n\r\nwould  enable the workers to study and receive training  near\r\n\r\ntheir homes, after work.  But for those middle aged trainees,\r\n\r\nthe  rate  of  progress must be slower  because  middle  aged\r\n\r\nworkers  cannot learn as fast as the young people.   We  have\r\n\r\nalso   to   take  into  consideration  the  language  barrier\r\n\r\nencountered  by the older workers. No doubt, the contents  of\r\n\r\nthe  courses  are  mainly in English, but in  the  course  of\r\n\r\ninstruction, the instructors and lecturers may exercise  some\r\n\r\nflexibility  in using the language which is familiar  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers so that they will be able to follow the instructions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we analyse a problem, we normally go to the\r\n\r\ndatabase  to  get  all  kinds of  information  to  study  the\r\n\r\nproblem,    and   find the solution.  We know  that  we  have\r\n\r\nseveral  hundred thousand workers whose educational level  is\r\n\r\nbelow that of secondary school. They have to be retrained  so\r\n\r\nthat they can fit into the knowledge-based economy.  But when\r\n\r\nwe  formulate  the  curricula for them, we  must  go  to  the\r\n\r\nfactories,  talk to them and  understand their feelings.   We\r\n\r\nneed to talk to them so that we will be able to hear what  is\r\n\r\nin their heart.  They may face a lot of problems, and this is\r\n\r\nwhat  the  President referred to as the \"heartware\"  for  the\r\n\r\n21st  century.   We  have  good  plans.   We  have  hardware,\r\n\r\nsoftware;  but we lack heartware.  So that is the problem  we\r\n\r\nare  facing.   The workers, especially those who are  middle-aged  and  above, are worried about their future.   They  are\r\n\r\nalso not interested in the retraining programme.  We need  to\r\n\r\ndepend on our heartware to solve this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when retraining the middle-aged\r\n\r\nworkers,  we should not confine ourselves to the training  of\r\n\r\nonly  the lower educated workers.   The crisis over the  past\r\n\r\ntwo  years also serves to remind every Singaporean that those\r\n\r\ndays  whereby \"a skill in hand, handy throughout a lifetime\",\r\n\r\nare   over.     So   to  retrain  the  middle-aged   workers,\r\n\r\ntechnicians and managers, I think it will involve more than a\r\n\r\nmillion people, and you have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  than  a  million people who will  belong  to  the  aged\r\n\r\npopulation by the year 2020.  So, we must start right away by\r\n\r\npaying  special attention to their retraining, in order  that\r\n\r\nthey will be able to handle the computer and face the IT age.\r\n\r\nThey  should be given more time to learn more skills to  help\r\n\r\nthem  to cope with more high-tech jobs.  In this way, we will\r\n\r\nreduce  a lot of social problems when the time comes when  we\r\n\r\nhave a substantially aged population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When middle-aged people go back to the classroom, they\r\n\r\nwill  need  a  lot  of determination, courage,  encouragement\r\n\r\nfrom  the  employers, and understanding from their  families.\r\n\r\nIn  this  way,  when  these middle-aged workers  carry  their\r\n\r\ntextbooks  and  go from the worksite to the  classroom,  they\r\n\r\nwill  not feel embarrassed.  On the contrary, they should  be\r\n\r\nproud of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfor   allowing  me  to  participate  in  the  debate  on  the\r\n\r\nPresident's Address.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President has placed great emphasis on people\r\n\r\ndevelopment in his Speech.  He has pointed out the importance\r\n\r\nof  lifelong learning, the need for foreign talent, the  care\r\n\r\nfor  older people, and the assistance to the less successful.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  will also implement many  people-development\r\n\r\nprogrammes   to   enable  Singaporeans  to   take   the   new\r\n\r\nopportunities  in  the  next  stage  of  development.    This\r\n\r\nblueprint for our development certainly holds great allure of\r\n\r\na fast growing and caring nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has also pledged to give all Singaporeans\r\n\r\ntangible  shares  in Singapore's success.  Through  HDB  home\r\n\r\nownership and upgrading schemes, the majority of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave  benefited  from the Government's very generous  housing\r\n\r\nsubsidy.   They  also benefit from the public  transportation\r\n\r\nsystem,  including public buses and MRT.  Most of them  enjoy\r\n\r\ngreater subsidy in health care if they opt for class  \"B\"  or\r\n\r\n\"C' hospitalisation.  All HDB residents do not pay for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  installation of cable TV reception.  The total subsidies\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the residents of public housing sector  have  been\r\n\r\nsubstantial.   This  is justifiable as the  majority  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation,  which  is  about 86%, are  residents  of  public\r\n\r\nflats.  However, private property residents, who account  for\r\n\r\nthe  remaining  14%,  enjoy very little  Government  subsidy.\r\n\r\nAlthough  this  is  consistent with  Government's  policy  of\r\n\r\ncaring  more  for  the  majority, it  does  not  seem  to  be\r\n\r\nperfectly equitable to deny the share of success and  subsidy\r\n\r\nto  the  non-HDB residents.  Of course, the scope  of  public\r\n\r\nassistance  in private housing estate is limited.  Obviously,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  cannot share the upgrading cost  of  private\r\n\r\nproperties.  But public amenity in private estates,  such  as\r\n\r\nparks,  playgrounds,  roads  and  other  facilities,  can  be\r\n\r\nimproved more expeditiously.  This will alleviate the anxiety\r\n\r\nof  private  estate  residents and give them  some  sense  of\r\n\r\nsharing the success of our development, even though the share\r\n\r\ncould be small.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated earlier, the heavy subsidy of public\r\n\r\nhousing  by the State is consistent with our national  policy\r\n\r\nof  helping the majority and the less successful.  It is also\r\n\r\nnecessary  to satisfy the basic housing needs of our  people.\r\n\r\nWe  have been very successful in our public housing programme\r\n\r\nthat  about 86% of our population are living in HDB  estates.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there are some who are singles and are not eligible\r\n\r\nto  purchase  a  flat directly from HDB.  And their  numbers,\r\n\r\nboth  males and females, are increasing.  Although  they  are\r\n\r\nallowed to purchase a flat if they jointly purchase one  with\r\n\r\nanother  single  when  they  reach  the  age  of  35,   their\r\n\r\nindividual's  right to purchase a flat of their own  directly\r\n\r\nfrom HDB has been denied.  The rationale is well understood -that  it has been the Government's policy to encourage family\r\n\r\nformation,  and  possibly that it is  not  economical  for  a\r\n\r\nsingle to occupy a 3-room or a 4-room flat.  But a person has\r\n\r\nremained  single is actually not his choice  in  many  cases.\r\n\r\nBut  rather it is due to a number of factors which are beyond\r\n\r\nhis or her control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While most Singaporeans are sharing the fruits of our\r\n\r\nsuccess, it is unfortunate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  singles  are almost left out in  housing  benefit.\r\n\r\nAlthough  they  are allowed to purchase a flat  jointly  when\r\n\r\nthey  are  35  years  old,  they  always  encounter  enormous\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in practice.  First of all, it is difficult  to\r\n\r\nfind  a  suitable unrelated party to share a life-long asset.\r\n\r\nThis  is  almost  equivalent to finding  a  partner  to  live\r\n\r\ntogether for the rest of their life.  Secondly, even if  they\r\n\r\nhave found a joint purchaser, problems may arise later if one\r\n\r\nof  the joint buyers decides to withdraw from the partnership\r\n\r\nand sell his or her flat.  I have come across a case in which\r\n\r\ntwo  sisters shared a flat, and when the younger sister found\r\n\r\na man to get married to, the older sister reacted angrily and\r\n\r\nrefused  to  sell their common flat.  This has created  great\r\n\r\ndifficulties for the people involved.  I would therefore urge\r\n\r\nthe Government to review the policy of eligibility for single\r\n\r\ncitizens,  and allow them to purchase a small flat.   Perhaps\r\n\r\nHDB  should  consider building some 1-room  flats  or  studio\r\n\r\nflats  for these single persons.  If these smaller flats  for\r\n\r\nsingle  persons can be built and mixed with bigger  flats  in\r\n\r\nthe  same  block or in their vicinity, single flat  occupiers\r\n\r\ncan  stay  close  to their parents or relatives.   This  will\r\n\r\nretain the family bonding and promote community stability.  I\r\n\r\ntherefore  request  the  Government  to  review  the   policy\r\n\r\nconcerning single person's eligibility for purchasing a  flat\r\n\r\ndirectly from HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion expressing thanks\r\n\r\nto the President for his Address.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, before I move my amendment, may I say,  let  it\r\n\r\nnot  be thought that it is out of churlishness that I do  not\r\n\r\nwish  to  join the House in thanking the President.   In  any\r\n\r\ncase,  we  know  the  President is not  responsible  for  the\r\n\r\ncontents of that speech.  He was gracious enough to come  and\r\n\r\ndeliver  the speech, and I have no hesitation in joining  the\r\n\r\nHouse  in  thanking the President for coming to  deliver  the\r\n\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now move my amendment. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove  that the motion before this House be amended by  adding\r\n\r\nthereto, at the end, the words:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"but regret that the Speech is significantly silent on\r\n\r\nany measures to encourage citizens to take responsibility for\r\n\r\nthe future of their country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the mover of the motion says one does\r\n\r\nnot look for measures in the Address.  I do not know what one\r\n\r\nlooks  for,  if  one does not look for the programme  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  as  to  what it is going to do.   So  I  fail  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  that.  But I see that one or two  other  speakers\r\n\r\nhave  said  that the Address was silent on concrete  measures\r\n\r\nand concrete plans.  And Mr Chiam has said it was empty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that the Address is a great\r\n\r\ndisappointment.   One  would  have  thought  that  after  the\r\n\r\ntrouble  and  the  time  taken to prepare  the  Singapore  21\r\n\r\nVision,  one  would have found in the Government's  programme\r\n\r\nfor  this  session  of  Parliament  some  concrete  measures,\r\n\r\nconcrete steps, to achieve what is considered should  be  the\r\n\r\nvision for Singapore.  But as has been said, you find none of\r\n\r\nit in this Address.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that, on the other hand, the\r\n\r\nAddress  is  all full of self-satisfaction, taking  pride  in\r\n\r\nwhat  this  Government has done, and patting  themselves  for\r\n\r\nwhat a wonderful Government they have been.  It has been said\r\n\r\nthat  our  Government  is now turning to people  development.\r\n\r\nAre  we  talking  about  the  same  thing?   What  is  people\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  Mr Speaker, Sir?  I should have thought  people\r\n\r\ndevelopment is developing the people's faculties to take on a\r\n\r\ngreater  responsibility.  That is what we talk  about  people\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  so  that their faculties are developed  to  the\r\n\r\nfullest extent.  Is there anything here in this Address  that\r\n\r\nsay  something  about how the faculties of  Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to be developed?  It is abysmally silent.  It is  full\r\n\r\nof  pretence  at  what has been achieved by this  Government,\r\n\r\nwithout  the  assumption in it of the need for  participation\r\n\r\nfrom  the  people.   And  yet, there are  calls  for  greater\r\n\r\npeople's activity, people's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparticipation.  All a pretence, Mr Speaker, Sir,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen saying.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the great pretender should now\r\n\r\nbe  taken  off  the Singapore screen.  The script  should  be\r\n\r\nchanged  and  the people be seen as playing their  part.   So\r\n\r\nwhat sort of a society do we have in Singapore today?  Is  it\r\n\r\na  society  where  the  people have the  responsibility,  the\r\n\r\npeople  contribute to the decision making?  Or do we  have  a\r\n\r\nsociety  where everything is dictated by the Government,  not\r\n\r\nso much the Government, but really by one man?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure I am going to encounter great\r\n\r\ncriticism  of  being  unfaithful when I say  that  the  truer\r\n\r\npicture  of Singapore society was given by Mr Ian  Buruma  in\r\n\r\nhis  latest  criticism.   He takes a  quotation  from  D.  J.\r\n\r\nEnright, the professor at one time in our university, in  his\r\n\r\nbook \"Memoirs of a mendicant professor.\"  The quote is:  \"The\r\n\r\nPAP  have often treated the populace like naughty or backward\r\n\r\nchildren.\"  Picking that up, Mr Buruma says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Backward children cannot be expected to think for\r\n\r\nthemselves for they are not responsible citizens.  It is this\r\n\r\nofficial  attitude  towards its people that  makes  Singapore\r\n\r\nsuch  a  depressing place despite its fine hotels,  excellent\r\n\r\nrestaurants  and shining shopping malls.  The  result  of  50\r\n\r\nyears  of  PAP Government is that most Singaporeans  are  too\r\n\r\nfrightened to think.  To call that Asian values is an  insult\r\n\r\nto the rest of Asia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one disagreement with Mr Buruma in his assessment\r\n\r\nof the Singapore society.  It is not an insult to the rest of\r\n\r\nAsia.   It  is an insult to the great Asian civilisations  of\r\n\r\nwhich  we claim to be the inheritors.  As Prof D. J.  Enright\r\n\r\nsays  in  his  book, from its inception, at least  from  1965\r\n\r\nonwards, the PAP mind has been hobbled by a mindset born  out\r\n\r\nof  paranoia.  This is the siege mentality, that Singapore is\r\n\r\nunder  siege.   Not  only the country  is  under  siege  from\r\n\r\ncountries around us, but the Government itself is under siege\r\n\r\nfrom  its people.  The fear of the people one day asking  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the party that forms the Government,  to  leave,\r\n\r\nthat  they may one day rise up and say, \"We have had  enough.\r\n\r\nThank  you very much for what you had done, but we  think  we\r\n\r\nshould\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow have a change.\"  So that is the siege mentality, not only\r\n\r\nthat  the  country  is under siege, but that  the  Government\r\n\r\nitself  is  under siege.  Not long ago, President Habibie  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia  was driven to remark that the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nis afraid of its own shadow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paranoia that has afflicted the PAP has led to the\r\n\r\n\"nanny\" mentality, the over-regulation of every aspect of the\r\n\r\npeople's  lives  and  to rule by fear.  The  Senior  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself, in one of his candid admissions, has said that  he'd\r\n\r\nrather be feared than respected.  There you have it!   It  is\r\n\r\nfear   that  is  most  important  in  the  thinking  of  this\r\n\r\nGovernment.  To keep the people in fear and that, as I  shall\r\n\r\nshow,  has been alarming for the Singapore society.  It shows\r\n\r\nno trust in our people.  There was again the recent utterance\r\n\r\nby  the  Senior  Minister about the loyalty of  an  important\r\n\r\ncommunity in our midst.  It is a very unfortunate remark.   I\r\n\r\nhope  he will come to this House and explain what exactly  he\r\n\r\nmeant and why did he say it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the PAP's actions and policies, Mr Speaker, Sir, have\r\n\r\nbeen  warped by this paranoia.  The Senior Minister, not very\r\n\r\nlong  ago, at the last sitting, said that my mind was frozen.\r\n\r\nIf  anyone's  mind is frozen, it is the PAP's mind.   It  has\r\n\r\nstood  still  from the 1960s and has not been able  to  think\r\n\r\nclearly because of this paranoia.  The result is what?   What\r\n\r\nhave  we got in Singapore?  A result which is disastrous  for\r\n\r\nSingapore as it gears up to meet the challenges of  the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury.  We are always talking about the challenges that lie\r\n\r\nahead.   But how are we prepared?  If we propose to  go  into\r\n\r\n21st  century  with a society too frightened  to  think,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  unable  to  think  rationally  because  of   this\r\n\r\nparanoia, what have we?  A society where those who  have  the\r\n\r\ncharge cannot think rationally and those under the charge too\r\n\r\nafraid  to think.  Is this the kind of society that will  fit\r\n\r\nus  for  the  challenges that lie ahead?   It  is  a  totally\r\n\r\nincompetent  society, however you look at  it.   And  who  is\r\n\r\nresponsible for this?  Again, one has to, if one  is  honest,\r\n\r\nadmit that one man is responsible for this image which Mr Ian\r\n\r\nBuruma points out himself.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst other countries and societies around us march\r\n\r\ntowards  progress,  modernisation in people  development,  in\r\n\r\nallowing  the  people to take greater share in  making  their\r\n\r\ndecisions,  we  are still mired in this society  of  ours  of\r\n\r\nwhich  we are asked to be so proud, still mired in the  siege\r\n\r\nmentality  of  the  1960s - fear, fear,  fear!   Mr  Geoffrey\r\n\r\nRobertson, not very long ago, in addressing the court on  the\r\n\r\ncase  brought by the Senior Minister against the Far  Eastern\r\n\r\nEconomic  Review had to say this, \"Mr Lee was  still  wearing\r\n\r\nthe  spectacles of the 50s.\"  So let us not pretend  that  we\r\n\r\nare  a  society  which  is  marching  with  other  societies.\r\n\r\nPractically,  as I said, some time ago, we are still  in  the\r\n\r\n18th  century when other countries have moved forward and  we\r\n\r\nseem  to be content to stay still simply because the PAP  are\r\n\r\nfrightened of losing their hold on the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the 21st century and the millennium\r\n\r\nwill  soon  be upon us.  And if we are honest with ourselves,\r\n\r\nour  people  must  be ready to face the challenges  that  lie\r\n\r\nahead.   If  we  want our people to think for  themselves   -what  they  should do to meet the challenges and  take  on  a\r\n\r\ngreater responsibility, not just accept whatever is done  for\r\n\r\nthem  or whatever is said on their behalf, but for themselves\r\n\r\nto  take the responsibility, then we have to act fast.  There\r\n\r\nis no time to be lost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest a few steps. I have three. I could\r\n\r\nsuggest a lot more, but time does not permit my outlining all\r\n\r\nthose  steps,  that  the Government  can  take  to  give  our\r\n\r\ncitizens   greater   responsibility.    Mr   Speaker,    Sir,\r\n\r\nresponsibility comes with freedom.  You cannot expect  people\r\n\r\nto  be  responsible  unless you give them  the  freedom.   No\r\n\r\namount  of  calling  upon them to be  responsible  will  help\r\n\r\nunless  you give them the freedom.  It is not just a question\r\n\r\nof  them having their rights.  I was surprised again  by  the\r\n\r\nmover's  statement  that  active citizenship  does  not  mean\r\n\r\ntransfer of powers and rights.  What does it mean?  You must,\r\n\r\nfirst  of  all, Mr Speaker, Sir, give our citizens  pride  in\r\n\r\nthemselves, pride that they belong to a society where they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter,  where they take the decisions, where  they  are  not\r\n\r\njust  robots  doing everything that is told to  them  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step is to give our citizens the pride of\r\n\r\nbeing  citizens  of Singapore, a pride that in  this  society\r\n\r\nthey  live  under  the  Rule of  Law.   That  is  very,  very\r\n\r\nimportant  if you are going to give citizens the  pride.   No\r\n\r\ncitizen will feel proud if he feels that the Rule of Law does\r\n\r\nnot obtain in their country and the government can behave  as\r\n\r\nit does without being taken to task.  The first imperative is\r\n\r\nthat   the  government  should  come  under  the  law.    The\r\n\r\ngovernment must be manifestly seen to be under the law, not a\r\n\r\ngovernment that is above the law, not a government that  does\r\n\r\nwhat  it  thinks it can do and will do without any regard  to\r\n\r\nwhat  the law is.  But that the government scrupulously obeys\r\n\r\nand follows the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only recently, there was this report in the papers about\r\n\r\nthe  CNB knocking at somebody's house at 2 am in the morning.\r\n\r\nNo   one  questions  the  need  for  the  CNB  or  other  law\r\n\r\nenforcement agencies to do their work.  But they have  to  do\r\n\r\ntheir  work under the law laid down. No one expects  them  to\r\n\r\nstay away and abdicate their duties and responsibilities.  We\r\n\r\nwere told that there was no search warrant produced. Why  was\r\n\r\nno  search warrant produced?  Why were the occupants  of  the\r\n\r\nhouse  not  first explained carefully before they broke  down\r\n\r\nthat they were officers from the CNB and unless they complied\r\n\r\nwith  the  request to open the door and  they can  see  their\r\n\r\nwarrant cards, the door would be broken down? That is working\r\n\r\nunder  the  law.   The  law is that you must  have  a  search\r\n\r\nwarrant  before  you can enter anybody's  house,  unless,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the  circumstances are such that  valuable  evidence\r\n\r\nwill  be  lost  if  you go, first of all,  to  get  a  search\r\n\r\nwarrant.   An  instance might be where  you  see  a  criminal\r\n\r\nrunning into a house.  Clearly, you have to go after him into\r\n\r\nthe  house and not wait till you go and get a search  warrant\r\n\r\nfrom somebody.  But that was not the case here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is that Ministers must be seen to obey the\r\n\r\nlaws scrupulously.  We\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquestioned  the Ministers' flouting of the law so  flagrantly\r\n\r\nin  the last elections in the constituency of Cheng San.   To\r\n\r\nus, the law was clear.  But apparently, the Ministers thought\r\n\r\nthat  they were above the law and went into the polling areas\r\n\r\nwhen  the  law  is  that  only the voters  and  the  election\r\n\r\nofficers  and the Police would be allowed into the  precincts\r\n\r\nof the polling station.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area is that our citizens must be told quite\r\n\r\nclearly that law enforcement agencies can only act under  the\r\n\r\nlaw   and  that  they  have  every  right  to  question   law\r\n\r\nenforcement officers.  The position in Singapore  is  when  a\r\n\r\npolice  officer goes to arrest somebody, he is not told  what\r\n\r\nthe charge is.  He is simply told, \"Come with us\".  And if he\r\n\r\ndares  to  ask, \"Why do I have to come? What is it?\",  he  is\r\n\r\ntold,  \"Oh, you will hear all about this when you get to  the\r\n\r\nstation.\"   And  then,  in some cases, the  poor  citizen  is\r\n\r\ncharged in court with obstructing the Police in the execution\r\n\r\nof  their duties. And what is his crime? Because he dares  to\r\n\r\nquestion the Police as to the exercise of their powers.   All\r\n\r\nthese  must  go.   Our citizens must feel that  they  have  a\r\n\r\nright,  a  right which the law will protect and no agency  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government, no officer of the Government can  take  that\r\n\r\nright away from them.  Then, you give them pride.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second step that I would suggest to the Government\r\n\r\nis  to  give  our citizens some say in decisions that  affect\r\n\r\ntheir  daily  lives.  Let them feel that they are  heard  and\r\n\r\nconsulted and can make some decisions.  I suggested not  very\r\n\r\nlong  ago that there should be representation of our bus  and\r\n\r\nMRT commuters on the Public Transport Council but was laughed\r\n\r\nat.   It  is impractical.  Why is it impractical?  If you  do\r\n\r\nhave  that, then the people who rely on the public  transport\r\n\r\ncan  take  pride  in that they are being listened  to.  Their\r\n\r\nviews  are heard.  But that does not happen in Singapore.  So\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  take any pride. Then there is the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board.  The Housing and  Development  Board,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, is a law unto itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

And in addition,  a\r\n\r\nlot  of debate and discussion had already taken place through\r\n\r\nthe whole S21 process over the last two years.  Many concrete\r\n\r\nmeasures have been suggested on how Singaporeans can  partner\r\n\r\nthe  Government either as individuals or collectively as  the\r\n\r\npeople  sector as we progress into the next millennium.   And\r\n\r\nthese have been taken into account by the various Ministries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to some of the charges made by the\r\n\r\nNCMP.  Sir, the NCMP charges that the Government is unable to\r\n\r\nthink  rationally.  I find this to be a very  odd  statement.\r\n\r\nFor  the  recent financial crisis, the Singapore Government's\r\n\r\nquick response had received high marks from key observers and\r\n\r\ncommentators  and analysts as well. The NCMP's allegation  is\r\n\r\nclearly   unjustified.   The  NCMP  also  charges  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must be under the law.  The Singapore  Government\r\n\r\nhas  scrupulously  governed by the rule of  law.   Our  legal\r\n\r\nsystem and judiciary\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave been highly rated.  In the recent CNB case cited by  the\r\n\r\nNCMP,  there is no doubt that the CNB carries out its  duties\r\n\r\naccording to the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP has also charged that Ministers were openly\r\n\r\nflouting election rules during the GE in Cheng San.   As  the\r\n\r\nNCMP will remember, the matter was carefully investigated and\r\n\r\nthe  Attorney-General was of the view that the Ministers  did\r\n\r\nnot violate any law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My view is that the NCMP should not firstly discount the\r\n\r\nsubstantial  inputs by Singaporeans into the  S21  and  other\r\n\r\nconsultations nor assume that all Singaporeans are waiting to\r\n\r\nbe  spoon-fed all the time.  Many have bothered to  take  the\r\n\r\ntime  to read and discuss the S21 report and now the Addenda,\r\n\r\nand  to make constructive suggestions. This is what we should\r\n\r\nbe  encouraging  and not just expressions or cliches,  as  my\r\n\r\ncolleague, Mr Davinder Singh has highlighted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, the amendment by the NCMP simply\r\n\r\ncannot stand.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise  in  support  of the  amendment  moved  by  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the Workers' Party.   In  my  view,  the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Address is nothing more than  a  precis  of  the\r\n\r\n\"Singapore 21 Vision\". There is nothing new, especially  when\r\n\r\nit  makes no mention at all on enabling the people to  freely\r\n\r\nand effectively exercise their political rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was mentioned in the President's Address that, \"All\r\n\r\ncitizens  have helped to build Singapore through  their  hard\r\n\r\nwork  and  commitment. All deserve to share in the  country's\r\n\r\nsuccess.\"     The asset enhancement scheme was  cited  as  an\r\n\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we must not forget that the HDB recently\r\n\r\nintroduced some new  regulations to punish those who  attempt\r\n\r\nto  realise  the  profits  from their  asset  enhancement  by\r\n\r\nselling  their  bigger flats to downgrade to  smaller  flats.\r\n\r\nThese\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  will  have to pay a higher interest  rate  for  their\r\n\r\nmortgage loan. For those who sell their flats and re-apply to\r\n\r\nHDB  for  another flat, a levy is imposed on them  for  their\r\n\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when the market is good, the prices of the flats go\r\n\r\nup,  and  your assets, in the form of your flats, are  indeed\r\n\r\nenhanced.   However, if you decide to take profit  by  taking\r\n\r\nadvantage  of the enhanced value, the Government  immediately\r\n\r\nmoves  in  and demands a share of your profit.   Taking  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the  higher interest  rate  you  have  to  pay\r\n\r\nsubsequently,  all  the expenses and  the  levy,  the  actual\r\n\r\nprofit  derived  from  the asset enhancement,  the  so-called\r\n\r\nsharing of the country's success for your commitment  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry,  is simply negligible.  Much of your profit actually\r\n\r\ngoes  back  to  the  Government's  coffers.   Moreover,  some\r\n\r\npeople  are  forced  to  downgrade because  of  the  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the HDB's upgrading programme, it is actually the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  responsibility to keep the housing  estates  in\r\n\r\ngood  and  healthy condition, but it has now been used  as  a\r\n\r\nmeans to \"bribe\" voters,  under the guise of enabling them to\r\n\r\n\"share  in the country's success\".  Even then,  the residents\r\n\r\nhave to share in the cost of upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was mentioned in the President's Address that, \"those\r\n\r\nwho  do  well succeed, not simply through their own  efforts,\r\n\r\nbut  because  society has given them the opportunity  to  get\r\n\r\nahead.   They  have  an  obligation  to  serve  their  fellow\r\n\r\ncitizens.\"   Yet, we have to offer high salaries  to  attract\r\n\r\nMinisters  and senior civil servants to stay on to serve  the\r\n\r\npeople.   Is  this  not a mockery of what the  President  has\r\n\r\nsaid?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the PAP's policy is \"focused on the people to realise\r\n\r\nthe  S21  Vision\"  as described in Lianhe  Zaobao,  then  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  conduct studies on   how  to  create  the\r\n\r\nconditions   and  environment  conducive  to   the   people's\r\n\r\nparticipation  in politics in Singapore, and  not  to  depend\r\n\r\nsolely   on   Government  channels  such  as  the  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations like the RCs, CCCs, etc., and the Feedback\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnit,  to  make  the  people feel that after  voicing   their\r\n\r\nviews, they are already deemed to have taken part in national\r\n\r\naffairs.   The  Government can then take the  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nexplain  their  policies and win support for  policies  which\r\n\r\nthey have already decided upon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bona fide participation of the people should not be\r\n\r\nconfined  to verbal participation only.  Legitimate political\r\n\r\nactions  should also be included. If the Government continues\r\n\r\nto stringently obstruct political actions, then the so-called\r\n\r\n\"vibrant people sector\" is nothing but empty talk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the PAP must be realistic. If they\r\n\r\nreally want  to focus on the people, then it must attach more\r\n\r\nimportance to the people and respect their right to  exercise\r\n\r\nthe \"people's rights\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the PAP Government continues to change the election\r\n\r\nlaws  to  deprive the people of their rights  to  effectively\r\n\r\nreturn the representative of their choice to  Parliament, and\r\n\r\nto  threaten the people during election campaigns  by  saying\r\n\r\nthat  if  they  vote for the opposition, they  will  not  get\r\n\r\nbenefits  such  as  the asset enhancement and  infrastructure\r\n\r\nlike  the  MRT/LRT, and their kindergartens  will  be  closed\r\n\r\ndown,  etc., then all this talk about a people-focused policy\r\n\r\nis simply lacking in sincerity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That the words proposed to be added,\r\n\r\nbe there added.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment accordingly negatived.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Question again proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now register\r\n\r\nmy support for the Motion to thank the President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of the role that all Singaporeans play in\r\n\r\ndetermining the future of Singapore cannot be overstated.  As\r\n\r\nsuch,  the  focus in the President's Address  on  people,  on\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, strikes a common chord in many of our hearts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we know, Singaporeans today are already a much\r\n\r\nsought after human\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresource.  Head-hunters have often found Singaporeans  to  be\r\n\r\nmost  suitable for plum jobs in the regional, and  sometimes,\r\n\r\neven  global market place.  This is because Singaporeans have\r\n\r\na  reputation  for being intelligent, reliable and  diligent.\r\n\r\nThis presents the challenge that has been discussed before  - one of mobility and a potential loss of able Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\neconomies elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it can be argued that nurturing a sense of\r\n\r\nownership would be the best mitigating factor against  losing\r\n\r\nsuch  Singaporeans.   Once Singaporeans regard  Singapore  as\r\n\r\nhome, mobility would translate into several postings overseas\r\n\r\nfor  a  more  rounded experience instead of a  search  for  a\r\n\r\npermanent  home.   Singaporeans  at  all  levels  should   be\r\n\r\nbringing home their experiences elsewhere to help enhance the\r\n\r\noverall   well-being   of   the  economy   and,   eventually,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans at large.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, the need to foster a sense of identity is not\r\n\r\nlimited   to   the  more  able  Singaporeans,  but   to   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   For we are all on board the  large  Singapore\r\n\r\nShip and we each have our own part to play.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, as captain, assesses the possibilities,\r\n\r\nidentifies  the  challenges and constraints, and  charts  the\r\n\r\ncourse.   The corporate sector, as crew, identifies the  role\r\n\r\neach  company  organisation will and can  play.   Unlike  the\r\n\r\nconventional passenger ship, we Singaporeans on board are not\r\n\r\nmere   passengers;   we   examine   the   opportunities   for\r\n\r\nparticipation  and equip ourselves with the necessary  skills\r\n\r\nto  fulfill  our roles as best as we can.  We  are  crew-cum-passengers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, we were like small power-boats and were\r\n\r\nable   to  make  nimble  changes  whenever  a  rock  appeared\r\n\r\nunexpectedly or when we found a better route.   Now  that  we\r\n\r\nare on a big ship, which requires substantial effort just  to\r\n\r\nmake   a  slight  correction  of  our  route,  we  need   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  on  board to keep an ongoing  interest  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  we  are charting, ie, to help watch out for icebergs,\r\n\r\nrocks or other obstacles, or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuggest ways of ensuring a smooth and enjoyable journey.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, we Singaporeans have to rise above being\r\n\r\nmere passengers on this journey.  This means we cannot simply\r\n\r\nseek to just equip ourselves with enough skills and resources\r\n\r\nto  stay  on  board.  We should literally sink or  swim  with\r\n\r\nfellow  Singaporeans.  We cannot afford to have  a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere an unanticipated crisis emerges and all on board merely\r\n\r\nfold their arms and ask for the way out.  Instead, we have to\r\n\r\nassume active ownership of the vessel and both the challenges\r\n\r\nand benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we assume active ownership and responsibility?\r\n\r\nAllow me, Sir, to touch on an analogy here, that of parenting\r\n\r\nor assuming active ownership of our children.  As parents, we\r\n\r\ndo  not  wait  to  be asked to be involved in our  children's\r\n\r\nlives;  we  simply plan for the nurturing  and  care  of  our\r\n\r\nchildren in the context of the environment we are in.  We are\r\n\r\npro-active.   We guide them in their educational  and  career\r\n\r\nchoices  as best as we can anticipate their roles in society.\r\n\r\nWe  plan our finances and accumulate enough resources to help\r\n\r\nthem along.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In much the same way, we Singaporeans should build upon\r\n\r\nour  sense  of  ownership of Singapore by  taking  an  active\r\n\r\ninterest  in  all  matters  on  board,  such  as  identifying\r\n\r\npotential  pitfalls  and  challenges  for  our  economy   and\r\n\r\ncompanies; isolating threats to our social fabric;  continual\r\n\r\nupgrading of ourselves for a meaningful contribution; helping\r\n\r\nthe  less  successful  amongst us; and  even  adding  to  the\r\n\r\nenjoyment of the journey itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for it is only when we have taken ownership of this\r\n\r\nunique  Singapore  Ship can we enjoy our hard-earned  cruise.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have demonstrated positively through this recent\r\n\r\ncrisis our social cohesion, in  spite of our multi-racial and\r\n\r\nreligious composition.  It is my personal wish that  we  will\r\n\r\nall   continue   to  foster  the  Singaporean  identity   and\r\n\r\ncontribute\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntowards a safe, steady, fruitful and enjoyable journey.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to join in this debate.  I rise in support of\r\n\r\nthe  motion standing in the name of the Member for Bishan-Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh GRC, Mr Davinder Singh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me, first, to thank the President for his\r\n\r\nAddress  which  painted  a  cogent vision  and  comprehensive\r\n\r\naction  plan for our country and nation, as we are poised  to\r\n\r\nenter into a new millennium.  The President remarked that the\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis  of  the  past  two  years  has  tested  the\r\n\r\nsturdiness and resilience of our society.  Indeed,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\npast  two  years  have been a watershed  experience  for  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  but  particularly so for  young  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nthose  under the age of 30.  We saw it as a fundamental  test\r\n\r\nof  not  just our economic, social and political  fabric  but\r\n\r\nalso  our character as a nation.  For many, it was an intense\r\n\r\npersonal experience.  Some lost their jobs, others had family\r\n\r\nmembers  who lost their jobs.  And it brought home the  cruel\r\n\r\nvagaries of the economic cycle and how big an impact  it  can\r\n\r\nhave on individuals and their dreams.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also underscored in the minds of many young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans the value of good governance, as attested to  by\r\n\r\nsurveys  conducted by the Feedback group in the  minds  of  a\r\n\r\nwhole new generation of Singaporeans.  In short, it has  been\r\n\r\na  unifying  experience and I think it  has  helped  gel  our\r\n\r\nsociety  and  provided a firm foundation with  which  we  can\r\n\r\ncontemplate Singapore 21.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, active citizenship lies at the heart of the\r\n\r\nPresident's Address and also Singapore 21.  For me, it  is  a\r\n\r\ncall to Singaporeans to take greater responsibility for their\r\n\r\nlives,  a call to come forward and serve their neighbourhood,\r\n\r\ntheir community and their country, and it is a call not  just\r\n\r\nto ponder and pontificate but also to act.  It is a call that\r\n\r\nI  hope  many  Singaporeans will heed.   Inevitably,  a  more\r\n\r\nvibrant civil society is the corollary of active citizenship,\r\n\r\nand  the  evolution of such a people sector has  implications\r\n\r\nfor all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to just address the impact, I think, it will\r\n\r\nhave  for  the public sector and for the people  sector.   We\r\n\r\nhave  a capable and efficient civil service.  It has a  noted\r\n\r\nability  to discern long-term needs of the nation,  formulate\r\n\r\nappropriate policy responses and action plans and effectively\r\n\r\nimplement  them.   In  fact, one could argue  that  that  has\r\n\r\nindeed been one of the key plans for our economic growth  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   But  there  is a need  to  adjust  this  modus\r\n\r\noperandi   -   to  involve more Singaporeans  in  the  policy\r\n\r\nprocess.   And it arises from a recognition of the fact  that\r\n\r\nproblems  are now more complex, knowledge and information  is\r\n\r\nnot  concentrated  but  quite distributed  and  there  is  no\r\n\r\nmonopoly  on wisdom.  And Government or the public sector  on\r\n\r\nits own cannot address all these issues comprehensively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was recently in Japan and I was struck by what I\r\n\r\nsense to be a shift in the attitude of the people towards the\r\n\r\nJapanese  bureaucracy, which has been shrouded in a  veil  of\r\n\r\ninfallibility  for a long time, but because of  the  Japanese\r\n\r\neconomic experience of the last decade, public confidence  in\r\n\r\nthe  bureaucracy has been shaken.  And many are now no longer\r\n\r\nprepared  to  accept  the bureaucratic  centred  approach  to\r\n\r\ngovernance in Japan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to have avenues for Singaporeans to\r\n\r\ncontribute  ideas.    The  process,  in  many  ways,  is   as\r\n\r\nimportant  as  the  output  and  in  many  ways,  will   also\r\n\r\nqualitatively  affect the nature of the output.   We  already\r\n\r\nhave  a  culture of tapping the private sector for its views.\r\n\r\nThis  should be systematically extended to the people sector,\r\n\r\nand  this  should  be not as a mere swop  to  the  cries  for\r\n\r\nadditional involvement in policy formulation but as part of a\r\n\r\ngenuine  effort to integrate the people sector in our efforts\r\n\r\nto  serve  the best interests of our country and to  build  a\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people sector has equally important\r\n\r\nresponsibilities if this work in progress is to succeed.   It\r\n\r\nhas  often  struck  me that not many people  appreciate  that\r\n\r\ncontributions to civil society can occur at different levels,\r\n\r\nthat it can be not just at the lofty policy debate level  but\r\n\r\nalso in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  mundane  and equally important municipal  or  community\r\n\r\nissues.  For example, I think management of the neighbourhood\r\n\r\npark  is  as  important as any debate on environment  policy.\r\n\r\nManagement   of   the  neighbourhood  school   is   certainly\r\n\r\nfundamental to the neighbourhood's interests, and is  equally\r\n\r\nimportant  to  any  debate on streaming and  other  education\r\n\r\npolicies.    So   I  would  hope  that  Singaporeans   regard\r\n\r\ncontributions  at the community level or the municipal  level\r\n\r\nwith equal respect and dignity, and not think it beneath them\r\n\r\nand only confine their energies to lofty policy debates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Sir, I am struck that some\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  exclude  Community Development  Councils,  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils  and other Government-related or, in some instances,\r\n\r\nagencies  that enjoy some degree of Government support,  from\r\n\r\nthe  domain  of  civil  society.  I cannot  fathom  why  this\r\n\r\nattitude   has  come  about.   Are  the  efforts   of   these\r\n\r\norganisations  any less noble just because  they  enjoy  some\r\n\r\ndegree of Government support?  Or are they any less important\r\n\r\nbecause  they  do  not adopt an adversarial stance  vis-a-vis\r\n\r\nGovernment?   I  do  not think there is  any  room  for  such\r\n\r\ncynicism  in  our Vision of Singapore 21.  To work,  we  need\r\n\r\nevery  Singaporean  to put his or her best  foot  forward  to\r\n\r\nrealise  that  dream.  I urge all Singaporeans to  shed  such\r\n\r\ninhibitions  and doubts, discard such negativism and  instead\r\n\r\ngive  the system, the idea, a fair chance.  It does not  mean\r\n\r\nyou   have  to  confine  your  energies  to  Government   and\r\n\r\nGovernment-related efforts, but certainly it  also  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that  you  have  to exclude them from  your  domain  of\r\n\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government perhaps has the most difficult task\r\n\r\nin  guiding this evolutionary process with a deft touch,  and\r\n\r\nnot  a  heavy hand.  It has to cast an eye to the aspirations\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans who wish to be more involved and at the same\r\n\r\ntime  on  the  need for effective, efficient  and  responsive\r\n\r\ngovernance.   In this process, the Government  will  have  to\r\n\r\nconstantly  review, as Mr Davinder Singh has said,  not  just\r\n\r\nwhere such OB markers should\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlie, but even whether they are necessary in certain context.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am heartened by the Addendum to the President's\r\n\r\nAddress from the Prime Minister's Office which stresses  that\r\n\r\nthe  public  sector will do more to consult  the  people  and\r\n\r\nprivate sectors, seek their active involvement as partners in\r\n\r\nimplementing policies and be more open, transparent and adept\r\n\r\nat  explaining Government policies to Singaporeans.   I  look\r\n\r\nforward  to the specific initiatives from the public  service\r\n\r\nin this regard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, active citizenship and civil society also require a\r\n\r\npeople  who  have  the creativity and the wherewithal  to  be\r\n\r\nengaged  in  a  meaningful and productive  manner.   In  that\r\n\r\nregard, I welcome the emphasis on people development and,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  the  many initiatives outlined in  the  Addendum\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister for Education.  In particular, I am pleased\r\n\r\nthat there is going to be increasing emphasis on not just the\r\n\r\nproducts  of the output of the system but also on the  system\r\n\r\nof  education, the practices and processes that are  employed\r\n\r\nwithin our schools.  That is a welcome initiative and I  hope\r\n\r\nwe would hear more in greater detail from the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight one particular aspect of the\r\n\r\neducation  service, ie, the pre-primary education.   When  we\r\n\r\nsurvey  pre-school education in Singapore, the terrain  is  a\r\n\r\nstark  contrast  to  the organised and  structured  world  of\r\n\r\nprimary  and secondary education in Singapore.  In pre-school\r\n\r\neducation,  we have a plethora of options, full-day  care  to\r\n\r\ntwo- and four-hour kindergarten classes.  We have a range  of\r\n\r\nmethodology employed from Montessori to other more curriculum-based  efforts.  We have a range in fees from a few  tens  of\r\n\r\ndollars to several hundred per month.  Parents have to choose\r\n\r\nfrom  this  sometimes bewildering array of  choices  but  are\r\n\r\noften  unsure  or unclear about the standards,  the  teaching\r\n\r\nmethods  and whether they are in fact appropriate  for  their\r\n\r\nchildren  and  whether  their  children  in  turn   will   be\r\n\r\nadequately prepared for primary school.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore welcome the Ministry's announcement that it\r\n\r\nwill  be  more involved in pre-school education and  that  it\r\n\r\nintends  to  undertake research to see how  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  can work with pre-school centres.  I  would  offer\r\n\r\ntwo particular areas for the Ministry's active consideration.\r\n\r\nThe  first  is on curriculum design and teacher  training  in\r\n\r\norder to ensure that a certain minimum acceptable standard of\r\n\r\neducation  is  provided across the country in our  pre-school\r\n\r\nsystem  and,  secondly, to consider, and I know this  may  be\r\n\r\nanathema  for  some involved, some kind of  certification  so\r\n\r\nthat parents who go to these centres have some assurance that\r\n\r\nthey have passed a quality control test.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I  agree  wholeheartedly\r\n\r\nwith  it.   The  President mentioned all the relevant  issues\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  people:  to enhance  the  people's  quality,\r\n\r\nrevamping  our  education  system,  and  promoting   lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning;  to  strengthen our drive for  the  development  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  stepping  up  our  efforts  to  attract   foreign\r\n\r\ntalents; and to enhance the unity and social cohesiveness  of\r\n\r\nour people, the various ethnic communities should respect one\r\n\r\nanother, and we should help those who are less successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Address, there is no mention of our economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  nor  any  statistics.  This is a  big  change.   This\r\n\r\nreflects  the  fact that we are now in a  new  stage  of  our\r\n\r\nnation  building.   However, it does not mean  that  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth is no longer important.  It does not mean that  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  to compete with other people in order to  enjoy  a\r\n\r\nbetter  life.  On the contrary, the President's  Address  has\r\n\r\nfocused  on  our  long-term development, so that  we  may  be\r\n\r\nprepared for economic development in the 21st century, and to\r\n\r\ndevelop   a  masterplan  for  a  better  life  in  the   next\r\n\r\nmillennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 21st century, we will encounter many challenges.\r\n\r\nI would like to touch on three main challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first challenge is that a new international and\r\n\r\nregional strategic situation is taking shape.  The\r\n\r\nsuperpowers, like US, Japan, the European Union and China,\r\n\r\nare re-aligning themselves according to their own strategic\r\n\r\ninterests.  And the nations in this region are undertaking\r\n\r\nmajor political and economic reforms.  Indonesia will elect\r\n\r\nits President on the 20th of this month.  In Malaysia, the\r\n\r\ngeneral elections are just around the corner.  In the not too\r\n\r\ndistant future, the region's political scene and\r\n\r\ninternational relations will take on a new look.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a small country. We will have to re-orientate ourselves in the new situation, for our own sake.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, the people can be a deciding factor.  The\r\n\r\npeople must make sure that the Government leaders they elect\r\n\r\nwill have strategic foresight and that they can make a safe\r\n\r\narrangement for our future.  Otherwise, all that we have will\r\n\r\nbe wiped out overnight in a big \"international strategic\r\n\r\nearthquake\", and all our so-called \"world-class home\" and\r\n\r\n\"Singapore-style social safety net\" will come to nought.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second challenge is the impact of ever-changing new\r\n\r\ntechnologies.  We are very lucky to be living  in  this  era.\r\n\r\nThe  Internet  has  changed not only  our  pace  of  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment but our lifestyles\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  well.  New technology is coming fast and aggressive.   If\r\n\r\nwe  are not prepared, we will not be able to benefit from the\r\n\r\nadvent of new technology, and be left behind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we have to examine the way we do things, the\r\n\r\nway we do business, and to find out where we can make use  of\r\n\r\nnew technologies and new methods of production to enhance our\r\n\r\nproductivity and to better our life.  That is why we have  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  reforms in our education system and to adopt  the\r\n\r\nlifelong learning approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third challenge is to enhance our national\r\n\r\ncohesiveness.   Among the three challenges, it  is  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant.   The  Government will  create  opportunities  and\r\n\r\nconditions for the people to fully develop their talents.  In\r\n\r\nthe  next  century,  if  there is  international  peace,  our\r\n\r\npolitical  and  social conditions are stable, we  can  expect\r\n\r\nanother  lot  of Singaporeans to become wealthy.   They  will\r\n\r\nventure  out of this country to go regional and  global.   We\r\n\r\nhope  that  these  \"new millionaires\" will learn  from  their\r\n\r\nancestors.   They should adopt Singapore as  their  home  and\r\n\r\ndonate generously in support of the charities in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any society, there are failures and the less\r\n\r\nfortunate.  We should help them.  Their progress and  success\r\n\r\nwill remove the impediments on our way towards progress.   We\r\n\r\ngive those who have gone bankrupt a second chance.  We should\r\n\r\nalso   adopt  the  same  attitude  towards  other   failures.\r\n\r\nHowever, I feel that to enhance social cohesiveness, all  the\r\n\r\npeople  should share in the fruit of success.  The President,\r\n\r\nin  his  Address, pointed out that, \"So long as  the  economy\r\n\r\ncontinues to do well, the Government revenues can afford  it,\r\n\r\nwe  will  continue to implement asset-enhancement schemes  to\r\n\r\ngive  Singaporeans stakes in our success.\"  This is certainly\r\n\r\na farsighted policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion thanking the President for his\r\n\r\nAddress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item of business under\r\n\r\ndiscussion  be  exempted  at  this  day's  sitting  from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of Standing Order No. 1.  -  [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DEBATE ON PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng (Minister without Portfolio) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister without Portfolio (Mr Lim Boon Heng):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I support the motion.  A friend asked  me:  Why\r\n\r\nis  the  Government  so preoccupied with ratings  by  various\r\n\r\nagencies?   Why is it not concerned with the people,  but  so\r\n\r\nconcerned about being Number One?  It made me pause.  Not  to\r\n\r\nponder over the question, but to ponder why the question  was\r\n\r\nasked.  There is an obvious lack of understanding!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the Government concerned about ratings?\r\n\r\nGovernment wants to know how rating agencies see us,  because\r\n\r\nthat  is  how investors see us.  If rating agencies score  us\r\n\r\npoorly,  we  will  be out of favour with investors.   A  poor\r\n\r\nrating  will  mean  it  would be so much  harder  to  attract\r\n\r\ninvestments  to  create  new jobs,  better  paying  jobs  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government looks at the factors rating agencies use, to\r\n\r\nsee  where we are trailing others, so that we can take  steps\r\n\r\nto  improve   -  if those factors are important.   Only  then\r\n\r\nwill we get the quality investments we want, for quality jobs\r\n\r\nfor  our workers.  We have scored well in many ratings.   The\r\n\r\ndanger  is we can be blinded by our own success, and fail  to\r\n\r\nnote  how  others are improving.  When one who is Number  One\r\n\r\nbecomes  complacent,  others will overtake  it.   History  is\r\n\r\nreplete with examples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It happens to whole industrial sectors of countries.\r\n\r\nJust  after  the  Second World War, the leading  shipbuilding\r\n\r\ncountry was Britain.  By the late 1960s, she was overtaken by\r\n\r\nJapan.   Why?  Because British shipbuilders did not recognise\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreater efficiency of Japanese shipbuilding methods, and when\r\n\r\nthey  did, management was unable to get the support of unions\r\n\r\nfor the changes they needed to make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It happens to companies more frequently. IBM was the\r\n\r\nundisputed Number One in computers.  When the PC came on  the\r\n\r\nscene, IBM thought it was a toy.  When the PC business  grew,\r\n\r\nIBM belatedly went into the PC business.  Those familiar with\r\n\r\nthe  telecoms  industry know how MCIWorldCom  -   a  relative\r\n\r\nnewcomer  -  now challenges AT&T for top ranking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why management gurus say that a company must\r\n\r\nstart on a new growth curve before it reaches the top of  its\r\n\r\ncurrent  one.   So it is useful to know where we  are.   What\r\n\r\nstrategies  we  adopt depends on where we are on  the  growth\r\n\r\ncurve.  This explains why we have to make changes, even  when\r\n\r\nthings  seem  to  be  going well,  such  as  in  the  banking\r\n\r\nindustry.   But  it is not easy.  The attitude  is:   \"If  it\r\n\r\nain't  broke, don't fix it!\"  But if we do not start  on  new\r\n\r\ngrowth strategies, we will be left behind in the dustbins  of\r\n\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are some of our companies in danger of being overtaken?\r\n\r\nWe  are  Number  One  in  ship repair.   The  CEO  of  Jurong\r\n\r\nShipyard, Mr K K Tan, told me recently that he had visited  a\r\n\r\nshipyard in Shanghai, China.  The orderliness of the shipyard\r\n\r\nimpressed  him greatly.  Obviously the shipyard was efficient\r\n\r\nand  well run.  He asked his host where they had learnt  such\r\n\r\nmodern  management  methods.  His host replied:  \"From  you!\"\r\n\r\nMr  Tan  was taken aback!  How was that possible?   His  host\r\n\r\nsaid:  \"Do you remember 10 years ago you gave a talk here  on\r\n\r\n5S?   You  told  us  about it, and we have applied  it  since\r\n\r\nthen.\"   That left an even deeper impression on Mr  Tan.   It\r\n\r\nshows  how  bright, dynamic and hungry Chinese can learn  and\r\n\r\ncatch  up!   So  our  shipyards need to restructure  to  stay\r\n\r\nahead,  and  Mr  Tan will certainly want to do business  with\r\n\r\nChina, where land and labour costs are much lower.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIA regularly wins accolades. Recently, one of Mr\r\n\r\nCharles Chong's constituents in Pasir Ris told him his  fears\r\n\r\nby  e-mail.  He said that many countries stopped their clocks\r\n\r\nwhen they threw out their colonial masters, and have declined\r\n\r\never  since.   But  we  are in danger of having  stopped  our\r\n\r\nclocks in the 1980s.  This constituent of his works for ICAO,\r\n\r\nand had recently visited China to examine their standards and\r\n\r\nprocedures.   He  was impressed by how fast Chinese  airlines\r\n\r\nhave  progressed.  In the 1980s he thought it would take them\r\n\r\n50  years  to catch up with Singapore.  He thinks  they  have\r\n\r\ncaught  up,  a  good system is in place.  Only  the  lack  of\r\n\r\nexpertise in marketing and selling was holding them  back  to\r\n\r\ngive us a run for our money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two examples, I hope, are sufficient to prod us to\r\n\r\nchange,   whichever  industry  we  are  in,  be  it  banking,\r\n\r\ninsurance, telecoms, air transport, sea transport, retailing,\r\n\r\nhealthcare,  construction,  ship  repairing,  chemicals   and\r\n\r\npetrochemicals, or electronics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We operate in a global environment. The forces at work\r\n\r\nelsewhere are present here as well. It is impossible  for  us\r\n\r\nto be isolated and to shut out these competitive forces.  Our\r\n\r\nown market is far too small.  We have to trade with the world\r\n\r\nand  so  contend with the global forces at work.  Almost  all\r\n\r\ncountries embrace the market economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The critical question for us is: what kind of operating\r\n\r\nsystem  is  best suited for us?  Which system will allow  our\r\n\r\ncompanies  to be competitive and, at the same time,  maintain\r\n\r\nsocial  harmony?  Which variant of the market economy is  the\r\n\r\nmore  efficient and bring about the most good?  Is it the  US\r\n\r\nmodel, or the European one?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some say the US model, because it is the most dynamic\r\n\r\nand  competitive.  The US has been able to create  more  jobs\r\n\r\nthan  Europe.   So unemployment in the US is  lower  than  in\r\n\r\nEurope.   But critics point out that many jobs are low-paying\r\n\r\nones.  Wage disparity in the US is far wider than in Europe.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, wage disparity is translated into substantial\r\n\r\ndifferences in the quality of life, especially in housing and\r\n\r\neducation  of  children.   Richer Americans  have,  over  the\r\n\r\nyears,  retreated into their suburban enclaves and their  own\r\n\r\nprivate  schools.   The inner city is a mess.   The  homeless\r\n\r\nroam  the  streets at night.  Crime rate is high:  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen a doubling of the adult population in prison since 1985.\r\n\r\nNow  about 2.3% of the male adult population are behind bars.\r\n\r\nThe  US is large and diverse.  Civil society is strong.   The\r\n\r\nUS  can absorb the social discontent.  While the US model  is\r\n\r\nattractive, can a small country like Singapore withstand  the\r\n\r\nexcesses the model brings?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we have a choice? In a global economy, the labour\r\n\r\nmarket is becoming one, we have to change our sense of place.\r\n\r\nBut  in  every  country,  there is a spread  of  people  with\r\n\r\ndiffering  abilities.   Low-skilled  workers  should  not  be\r\n\r\npriced out of the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is better - a system that provides more people\r\n\r\nwith  the dignity of work, even low paying, or one where  the\r\n\r\nunemployed  or unemployable live on the backs  of  those  who\r\n\r\nwork?   In  Europe, wage disparity is far narrower,  but  the\r\n\r\nsocial  security systems are struggling.  Many people  choose\r\n\r\nto  remain  unemployed, rather than take up jobs  with  lower\r\n\r\npay.  Immigrants from Central Europe and North Africa take up\r\n\r\nthose  lower  value and lower pay jobs.  Most recently,  many\r\n\r\njobs  of  lower value and lower pay have migrated to  Central\r\n\r\nEurope.   The  unemployed are also voters, and  they  applied\r\n\r\npolitical  pressure.   In  France,  the  unemployed,  led  by\r\n\r\nunions, marched for higher unemployment benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan had taken a different path, using under-employment\r\n\r\nto  keep  unemployment low.  Large conglomerates also  create\r\n\r\nbusinesses  to \"retire\" their older executives.  After  eight\r\n\r\nyears  of  recession,  the system is  proving  unsustainable.\r\n\r\nCracks  and strains are showing.  Unemployment was 4.1%  last\r\n\r\nyear  and  estimated  to push past 5%  this  year.   Japanese\r\n\r\ncompanies are chipping away at their seniority-based  system,\r\n\r\nshifting towards\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperformance-based systems, closer to the US model.  This will\r\n\r\nstrain  social  cohesiveness and a new social  contract  will\r\n\r\nhave to be made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So which way should we go? What measure do we have to\r\n\r\ntake  to make us even more competitive so that we can  create\r\n\r\ngood-paying jobs for our workers?  Obviously, we want to move\r\n\r\ninto  the  knowledge-based economy.   One  aspect  of  it  is\r\n\r\nSilicon  Valley  type start-ups.  Another is  developing  our\r\n\r\ncompanies  into  regionally  competitive,  if  not,  globally\r\n\r\ncompetitive ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can we do to moderate the excesses of the\r\n\r\ncompetitive market economy?  How can we strengthen our social\r\n\r\nsafety  net?   Some people, both Singaporeans and foreigners,\r\n\r\nmistakenly think we are grossly lacking in not setting  up  a\r\n\r\nsocial  safety net.  But that is because they see the  social\r\n\r\nsafety  net  as the one modelled by the West.  In  the  years\r\n\r\nahead,  as  the  harsh  pace  of globalisation  becomes  more\r\n\r\nmanifest,  there will be louder calls for the setting  up  of\r\n\r\nsocial  safety nets.  We need not oppose such calls.  Rather,\r\n\r\nwe should contribute to the debate by pointing out that there\r\n\r\nare  different solutions.  There should be a free market  for\r\n\r\nideas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain with an example. Some countries have\r\n\r\nunemployment benefits, pegged to the last-drawn pay.   We  do\r\n\r\nnot - we only have provision for retrenchment benefits.  Does\r\n\r\nit  mean ours is deficient?  Not necessarily.  Typically,  in\r\n\r\nmost  countries,  home ownership is 60%  of  the  population.\r\n\r\nOurs  is 90%.  Therefore, one major household expenditure   - rents   -   is not an issue for most of our people.  What  we\r\n\r\nneed  are mortgage assistance schemes, like what we  have  in\r\n\r\nthe downturn.  For those who rent, why, we have rent vouchers\r\n\r\nand utility vouchers, an idea which some in the West are only\r\n\r\nnow discussing!  Of course, our CDCs dispense those vouchers.\r\n\r\nAnd  these  are  not  being  paid  for  by  social  insurance\r\n\r\ncontributions, direct cost to companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be calls for a minimum wage. It is an icon\r\n\r\nof the conventional social safety net.  Yes, we do not have a\r\n\r\nminimum  wage.   But we do  have subsidised  public  housing.\r\n\r\nThe  subsidised public housing scheme is actually another way\r\n\r\nof delivering what the minimum wage concept tries to deliver.\r\n\r\nThe  minimum  wage adopted in other countries  aims  to  give\r\n\r\nworkers  at  the  lower end enough to pay for  housing.   Our\r\n\r\nscheme  delivers  the  same, but does not  add  cost  to  the\r\n\r\nemployer.  So there should be no monopoly of effective  ideas\r\n\r\nfor social safety nets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also take care that we do not adopt new ideas\r\n\r\nthat appear to be great, but whose consequences are not fully\r\n\r\nknown,  like social security as developed in Western  Europe.\r\n\r\nWhen  first implemented, everyone thought it was great.   Now\r\n\r\nthe  system  is breaking down and governments are  voted  out\r\n\r\nbecause  they  try  to cut back benefits to balance  budgets.\r\n\r\nWhy  did a great idea turn out to be a millstone on the necks\r\n\r\nof  society?  Because people did not appreciate social trends\r\n\r\n-  people living longer and birth rates falling.  Instead  of\r\n\r\neach  generation providing for themselves, it has become  one\r\n\r\ngeneration living off the next!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies also get into trouble with their employee\r\n\r\nbenefits.   Take  pensions.  IBM  in  the  United  States  is\r\n\r\noverhauling its employee pension scheme.  It says it must  do\r\n\r\nso  to  stay  competitive with rivals which have  lower  cost\r\n\r\nschemes.  But it is creating an employee backlash.   For  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time  in its history, IBM may be unionised as  unhappy\r\n\r\nworkers turn to the union to redress their grievances!  So we\r\n\r\nshould  learn  from such experiences to know  that  at  first\r\n\r\nsight the idea is great, it does not necessarily turn out  to\r\n\r\nbe great.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, one idea is in fashion - employee stock option\r\n\r\nplans  (ESOPs).   Surveys show that American  companies  with\r\n\r\nstock  option  plans out-perform those that  do  not.   These\r\n\r\nplans are touted as 'cost free' for the companies except  for\r\n\r\nthe  dilutive  effect on shareholders.   Companies  here  are\r\n\r\nplunging into ESOP.  I think ESOP is a great idea for new\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstart-ups  like  those  we want under  our  technopreneurship\r\n\r\nprogramme.   It offers employees the attraction  of  becoming\r\n\r\nmillionaires  by  sharing risks with  the  company  founders.\r\n\r\nBeyond  the  start-up phase, I am not so sure.   If  employee\r\n\r\nnumbers become very large and growth moderates, will there be\r\n\r\nenough shares to go round, to be effective as a motivator?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For mature companies seeking the services of top-notch\r\n\r\nbusiness leaders, ESOP is also a good idea.  It is a form  of\r\n\r\nrisks-sharing.   The  top executives are  rewarded  if  their\r\n\r\nactions  do  bring results, take the company on a new  growth\r\n\r\ncurve.   But ESOPs widen the income gap.  The US trade  union\r\n\r\nfederation  AFL-CIO points out that thanks largely  to  share\r\n\r\noptions, the average American chief executive now takes  home\r\n\r\n419  times the wage of the average factory worker.  In  1980,\r\n\r\nhe  made  42  times as much.  Other studies show  that  ESOPs\r\n\r\ninflate reported earnings because options are not treated  as\r\n\r\nexpenses,  and  mask  employee earnings to  show  lower  wage\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others point out that shareholder value may well be due\r\n\r\nto  bull runs of the stock market rather than the actions  of\r\n\r\nmanagement and employees.  Employees with stock options get a\r\n\r\nwindfall,  unless  stock options are  indexed  to  the  stock\r\n\r\nmarket.  So let us study ESOP carefully and not end up with a\r\n\r\nscheme  that will weigh down company earnings in the  future.\r\n\r\nWe  may  have no choice but to follow what other  people  do.\r\n\r\nBut let us learn from their experiences to avoid the problems\r\n\r\nthey run into.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace of change will be faster. Already the average\r\n\r\nlength  of  service of employees with a company  has  shrunk.\r\n\r\nWith  the  faster  pace  of change, this  average  length  of\r\n\r\nservice will shrink further.  It will not be because of  poor\r\n\r\nwork attitudes and job hopping.  It will be driven by shorter\r\n\r\nlife   cycles   of   products   and   services.    Therefore,\r\n\r\ncompensation schemes and provisions for employee-welfare will\r\n\r\nhave to take this factor into account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employability, not employment, is the key issue. It is\r\n\r\nfundamental to workers'\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwelfare.   Skills  training must therefore  be  high  on  our\r\n\r\nnational  agenda.   So I return to where I started  -  rating\r\n\r\nagencies.   We lag behind others in skills and work attitude.\r\n\r\nThis  shows  up  in all indicators of rating agencies.   They\r\n\r\ntell  us our weaknesses, even if BERI rates our workforce  as\r\n\r\nnumber  one.  Unless we correct these weaknesses,  we  cannot\r\n\r\nmove  up the new growth curve.  There will not be the  bright\r\n\r\nfuture we want for our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we have Manpower 21. It is a key blueprint\r\n\r\nfor the welfare of our people. Let us act on it!  Manpower 21\r\n\r\ncan  take  off  only if all three social partners  -  unions,\r\n\r\nemployers  and Government - work in tandem and support  these\r\n\r\nschemes and enlist the support of the people.  Yes, all three\r\n\r\nsocial partners have indeed made significant contributions on\r\n\r\nwhat  needs  to  be  done to develop a  globally  competitive\r\n\r\nworkforce to support our economic vision.  It is time we  did\r\n\r\nthe  selling, the mobilising.  We have to do this in concert.\r\n\r\nIn pushing for Manpower 21, we must not forget that there are\r\n\r\nsignificant  numbers within our workforce  who  do  not  have\r\n\r\nbasic  education.  So we need to give BEST another push.   We\r\n\r\nmust  initiate  other imaginative programmes that  give  such\r\n\r\npeople  hope that they too will benefit in a better Singapore\r\n\r\nwe  want to create. Then, we will move into the 21st century,\r\n\r\nentering the knowledge-based economy and building our  world-class homes here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nForeign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):  Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank  you  for  allowing me to join in  the  debate  on  the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Address and I rise in support of the  motion  in\r\n\r\nthe name of Mr Davinder Singh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the risk of sounding bland and making the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  political  writer Chua Lee Hoong yawn,  I  must  first\r\n\r\nconfess  that  I agree with her that we can do  with  more  c\r\n\r\nolour in our speeches, such as the one mentioned by her in Mr\r\n\r\nS Rajaratnam's Harvard Club Anniversary speech in 1981.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I hope she and others would not be too\r\n\r\ndisappointed  if  I  shun  the  example  of  the  happy  pigs\r\n\r\nmentioned  in  Mr Rajaratnam's speech. I do not know  whether\r\n\r\nthat  will  make my comments more acceptable  today  or  more\r\n\r\nhalal, but I hope it would not lack the passion called for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, there are happier things to speak of too. If\r\n\r\nthe  President's Address was lacking in passion, as Lee Hoong\r\n\r\nsaid,  it  was definitely not because President  S  R  Nathan\r\n\r\nlacks  such a spirit.  I know Mr President as one  who  reads\r\n\r\nwidely  and  as  a man with a strong passion  for  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Nathan was the Chairman of the Straits Times, he  had\r\n\r\nat  times wished that our journalists write better, not  just\r\n\r\nwith colour, but with commitment and passion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passion can come in many different colours. And in\r\n\r\ndifferent  forms  too.  But what about substance?   That  was\r\n\r\ndefinitely  aplenty  in the Presidential Address.   Similarly\r\n\r\nwith the Addenda.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What matters most is that the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nbelieves  in bringing home the bacon, the more succulent  the\r\n\r\nbetter it is.  However, I am sure you would understand if the\r\n\r\nMuslim  Singaporeans also ask for their fair share  of  halal\r\n\r\nprovidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is provided for in both the Presidential Address\r\n\r\nand  the  Addenda.  In other words, lots of food for  thought\r\n\r\nand  more,  if  we  do not belong to that class  of  pleasure\r\n\r\nseekers,  who  only  believe in material  well-being,  to  be\r\n\r\narrived   at  without  toil,  sweat  and  tears  as   in   Mr\r\n\r\nRajaratnam's speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, we Singaporeans believe in our people. Those\r\n\r\nfew words almost wax lyrical.  Like the passion in the Pledge\r\n\r\nand the song, \"We the citizens of Singapore, pledge ourselves\r\n\r\nas one united people.\". I will come back to that later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first, Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to focus on two\r\n\r\nareas  which  I  think are critical as  we  prepare  for  our\r\n\r\nfuture.  First,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  education. The wealth of Singapore lies in our  people  - our  values and our instincts, our courage and tenacity,  our\r\n\r\nskills  and competencies. So says the MOE Addendum.  I  could\r\n\r\nnot agree more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success in the future depends on how well we prepare\r\n\r\nour  people  for the challenges ahead.  Singapore has  always\r\n\r\nplaced  a  premium on education, and it is worth  reiterating\r\n\r\nwhy we must continue to invest heavily in our young. That  is\r\n\r\nhow  the MOE prefaced its role.  Almost a cliche perhaps, but\r\n\r\ndo  not  let that fool us, for the substance in that Addendum\r\n\r\nspeaks  volumes of the thinking and the mission MOE sets  for\r\n\r\nthe Ministry and for all of us Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, time does not permit me to belabour the\r\n\r\npoints  here  but suffice to say that the same Minister  also\r\n\r\nchaired the Singapore 21 Committee which presented us with  a\r\n\r\nvision  for a progressive and gracious Singapore,  living  in\r\n\r\nharmony  with itself, the region and the world  in  the  next\r\n\r\ncentury.   Allow me, however, to highlight just one point  in\r\n\r\nthe  Addendum  which,  to me, will bring  about  far-reaching\r\n\r\nimpact and I quote,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We will be more involved in pre-school education,\r\n\r\ninvesting   in   curriculum  design  and  teacher   training,\r\n\r\nconducting  research  and  tightening  regulation.   A  pilot\r\n\r\nresearch  will  be conducted to ascertain the most  effective\r\n\r\nway  for  MOE  to  work with pre-school  centres  to  prepare\r\n\r\nchildren for school learning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, pre-school education is not under the direct\r\n\r\naegis  of  MOE, although the pre-school centres  need  to  be\r\n\r\nregistered with the Ministry.  There is ample evidence to say\r\n\r\nthat  in  preparing for our children's education,  we  should\r\n\r\nstart from as early as possible.  Some even say, pre-natal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know the extent to which MOE would get \"more\r\n\r\ninvolved\", but I am sure that parents would be most happy  to\r\n\r\nlearn that the MOE's hand would be more visible in pre-school\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MOE research should also look into how more of the\r\n\r\nMinistry's budget and/or Edusave funds could be disbursed for\r\n\r\npre-school  education.  The PAP's Community Foundation  (PCF)\r\n\r\nnow runs\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclasses  for about 70% of the nursery, K1 and K2 classes  for\r\n\r\neach  cohort each year. The fees chargeable vary from $15  to\r\n\r\n$100 a month, and even more in the private ones. Surely,  the\r\n\r\nquality will also vary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also an urgent need to do centralised\r\n\r\nrecruitment, training and deployment of pre-school  teachers.\r\n\r\nThe MOE might want to consider either doing it themselves  or\r\n\r\nto  establish an independent agency to undertake  that  role.\r\n\r\nThis  will certainly reduce the headaches now faced  by  pre-school  operators and help to control the quality of teaching\r\n\r\nat these centres.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.23 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have read about certain pre-school centres producing\r\n\r\nstudents whose quality is below par.  They get educationally-handicapped  even before they begin their primary  schooling.\r\n\r\nThis will have serious ramifications as the education deficit\r\n\r\nsets in early, aggravating the situation as the students move\r\n\r\nup  the  educational  ladder.  Pre-school education  deserves\r\n\r\nmore  attention and I am sure MOE will be well  supported  in\r\n\r\ntheir move to do more for the pre-schoolers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, moving on to the bigger picture,\r\n\r\nallow  me  now to touch on an equally important, if not  more\r\n\r\nimportant  point mentioned in the President's  Address,  that\r\n\r\nis, multi-racial harmony and social cohesiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is an even more challenging task. The message is\r\n\r\nthe  same,  perhaps  just  as bland  and  boring  but  it  is\r\n\r\ndefinitely  worth  reiterating.  We cannot take  multi-racial\r\n\r\nand  multi-religious harmony that now exists in Singapore for\r\n\r\ngranted.   One can try to add more colour to that message  by\r\n\r\nusing different languages and imageries.  Yet the message  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  stark  and cold realities of primordial  instincts\r\n\r\nstill  linger  and apparently will continue to haunt  us  for\r\n\r\nsome time to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History has shown us how difficult it is to tackle that\r\n\r\nproblem. There are enough\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexamples  to scare us. Just look around us, and  we  will  be\r\n\r\nable to see enough of events that will continue to remind  us\r\n\r\nthat  the  ugly  heads  of  ethnicity,  racial  bigotry   and\r\n\r\nreligious fanaticism are as real in the past as it is today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gory scenes of Rwanda, Kosovo and even Timor, Ambon and\r\n\r\nKalimantan, in the recent past still remind us that we cannot\r\n\r\never  take racial and religious harmony for granted.   Rwanda\r\n\r\nand  Kosovo may be too far for us to really understand  their\r\n\r\nvibes,  but  after more than 30 years of relative  peace  and\r\n\r\nharmony in Indonesia, look at what could happen when a plural\r\n\r\nsociety  stirs and unravels.  Domestic politics and  economic\r\n\r\nills  must surely have contributed to the problems  too.  And\r\n\r\nthese factors will continue to also feature in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These issues could have been on Senior Minister Lee's\r\n\r\nmind  when  he  answered the Polytechnic student's  questions\r\n\r\nabout  Malays  in the SAF.  This issue has been haunting  our\r\n\r\nminds,  I  am sure, not only the Malay minds, for  some  time\r\n\r\nnow.   And  it looks set to continue to do so for  some  time\r\n\r\nmore.   This is certainly not an issue that could be  settled\r\n\r\nonce and for all, at least not for now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue too drew the attention of the Straits Times\r\n\r\nlast  Thursday.   Ms  Irene Ng, born a Malaysian  but  now  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean,  and who speaks Bahasa very eloquently,  as  the\r\n\r\nMalays  say \"macam air\" chose two Malay sayings to  open  and\r\n\r\nclose the matter discussed in the papers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capturing the disappointment of many Malays over SM\r\n\r\nLee's  comment,  she said it was like \"Sudah berputik,  balik\r\n\r\nberbunga\", meaning that the fruit has taken shape,  regressed\r\n\r\nto  a  flower stage. She ended by using another Malay  saying\r\n\r\n\"Akar dah tumbuh, janganlah dibongkar\" meaning what has taken\r\n\r\nroot, let it not be destroyed. Very appropriate indeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding how sensitive the issue was and is, she\r\n\r\nrightly  reported SM's full reply, in context.  SM's remarks,\r\n\r\nset  in  that background, certainly make a more understanding\r\n\r\nreading.  These are not simple\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatements.   They  are laden with personal experiences  over\r\n\r\nthe  years  which show deep seated concerns  that  cannot  be\r\n\r\neasily wished away by rational thinking. They are a matter of\r\n\r\nlife  and  death  that  are abounded  by  deep  emotions  and\r\n\r\nprimordial instincts.  Geopolitical realities might even make\r\n\r\nit worse. The extremist and the fanatical ways of some groups\r\n\r\nin  acting  in the name of Islam in some parts of the  Muslim\r\n\r\nworld  complicate  matters  further.   Non-Muslim  bias   and\r\n\r\nstereotyping too add to the complexity of the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how does a Muslim Singaporean who seriously and\r\n\r\nsincerely  believe in being Singaporean reconcile his  belief\r\n\r\nin  being Singaporean with what he sees as being seen as non-loyal or not loyal to Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To many a Muslim, being religious is also being\r\n\r\nresponsible  and  being  a good human  being.   Also  a  good\r\n\r\ncitizen.  Does an average Singaporean, especially  a  secular\r\n\r\nChinese, prefer Malays/Muslims not to be religious?  Is there\r\n\r\ntruth in what a Chinese gentleman once told me at a forum?  I\r\n\r\nquote,  \"The problem with you Malays is that you are Muslims.\r\n\r\nIf you are just Malays, you are all right.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that a problem of stereotyping? Are Malays/Muslims\r\n\r\ncast in the image and shadows of some of the extremist Muslim\r\n\r\ngroups  elsewhere?  Muslim Singaporeans, Mr  Deputy  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, generally believe in moderation and pluralism. They  are\r\n\r\nconscious of the multi-racial context they live in.  Most,  I\r\n\r\nam  sure, believe in independent Singapore and will  die  for\r\n\r\nSingapore as their \"tanah tumpah darah\" or motherland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that much water has passed under the bridge of\r\n\r\nour  short  history.  But that is not to say that  the  water\r\n\r\nwill  remain  still  all the time.  We will  continue  to  be\r\n\r\ntested  by  events and time, and sometimes  events  and  time\r\n\r\nbeyond our control and outside our area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is definitely a need to create a better\r\n\r\nunderstanding all the time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCo-existence  and  tolerance  are  not  sufficient.

One needs to be thankful for\r\n\r\nsuch a correction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is definitely a need to create a better\r\n\r\nunderstanding all the time.  We need more understanding  and,\r\n\r\neven  more critical, trust.  In the future, it would not just\r\n\r\nbe  a  question of who handles the machine gun unit but  also\r\n\r\nwho has access to cyber warfare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In yesterday's Sunday Times, for example, we read about\r\n\r\nhow  cyber war will grow in presence.  The Pentagon has  even\r\n\r\nset  up a centre to combat cyber war, which will not be  just\r\n\r\nlimited to the battle-front, but also on the computer attacks\r\n\r\non  foreign bank accounts, eg, as in the case of the war with\r\n\r\nYugoslavia.   Cyber war could even be waged from  the  living\r\n\r\nroom  of your home.  In other words, without trust, more will\r\n\r\nbe at stake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To establish trust would take an even longer time than\r\n\r\nit  would  to work on better understanding.  But we  have  to\r\n\r\nwork hard at it.  This is something we owe to our Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collectively, we must continue to nurture and strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  network of institutions we have established in Singapore\r\n\r\nto  promote multi-racialism.  We have to find ways to monitor\r\n\r\nand  appreciate  the  changes taking  place  in  race-related\r\n\r\nmatters, including in public housing and our schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foundations established by our pioneering fathers of\r\n\r\nindependence  in promoting greater multi-racial  harmony  and\r\n\r\npolitical  stability,  as  achieved  through  our   form   of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy, must be strengthened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, as we approach\r\n\r\nthe new session and the new century, first, let us count our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nblessings on what we have achieved.  Let us build on them and\r\n\r\nin the process enhance trust among our people.  Education and\r\n\r\nknowledge continues to be the key to our future.  As we  live\r\n\r\nthe  future  together, with a sense of common destiny,  trust\r\n\r\nwill  grow.   It  will take time but we will need  to  do  it\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I rise to thank the President  who  addressed\r\n\r\nthis House on behalf of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the emphases of the Speech was developing social\r\n\r\ncohesion.   I  am  glad  to  note that  there  is  an  Inter-Ministerial Committee which is looking into the issue of  the\r\n\r\naged    population.    Recently,   I   attended   an    Asian\r\n\r\nParliamentarian   meeting   on  the   issue   of   population\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   With  the  help of the Ministry  of  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  I presented the model of Singapore  in  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  the  aged  population.  In response to  our  model,  we\r\n\r\nreceived  very favourable comments from the participants  who\r\n\r\nwere  parliamentarians in Asia.  Some even jokingly  wondered\r\n\r\nwhether they could retire in Singapore.  In fact, we are  one\r\n\r\nof  the  Asian  countries  which have  a  comprehensive  aged\r\n\r\nprogramme besides Japan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the aged population issue involves the families,\r\n\r\nthe  community, the employers, the health service  providers,\r\n\r\nthe housing authority and those who provide public amenities.\r\n\r\nThis  is not an issue that only one Ministry would adequately\r\n\r\ndeal  with.   The  Inter-Ministerial  Committee  with  inter-Ministry  involvement and participation would be  the  proper\r\n\r\nway  in dealing with the issue, and to ensure that our people\r\n\r\nwould  be  properly  looked after when  they  join  the  aged\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of inter-Ministerial cooperation, my\r\n\r\nexperience  is  not very positive from what I encountered  in\r\n\r\nthe  past.  The Ministry of Community Development might  have\r\n\r\naggressive plans in dealing with community issues.   However,\r\n\r\nthe  progress  of  the  plan  will  depend  on  the  physical\r\n\r\nimplementation  by other Ministries.  Due to the  differences\r\n\r\nin the priority\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nset by the respective Ministries, some projects will drag  on\r\n\r\nfor years before they could be implemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to cite an example for building a childcare\r\n\r\ncentre in my constituency by a charitable organisation.   MCD\r\n\r\ngave  the  approval very promptly.  However, another Ministry\r\n\r\nwhich is supposed to build the centre dragged their feet  due\r\n\r\nto  shortage  of  resources.  In my view, the two  Ministries\r\n\r\nhave different priorities on the issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aged population issue could also face a similar\r\n\r\nproblem if each Ministry sings a different tune on the  issue\r\n\r\nof  priority.   I hope the poor experience I had  encountered\r\n\r\nwill not be repeated on this very important issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the development of a cohesive society, MCD will be\r\n\r\none  of  the main bodies to spearhead the various programmes.\r\n\r\nBesides  the  emphasis  on  the  CDCs  in  promoting   social\r\n\r\ncohesion,  the community centres and other various grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations like the RCs are equally important in promoting\r\n\r\nsocial cohesion among our people.  So far, all the programmes\r\n\r\ncarried  out  by these organisations are either self-financed\r\n\r\nor   through   community  donations.   The   Government   has\r\n\r\nrelatively  negligible financial involvement  except  payment\r\n\r\nfor  the  administrative  staff and  the  premises  like  the\r\n\r\ncommunity centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to strengthen the social cohesion of our society is\r\n\r\nan   enduring   and   open-ended  task  for   the   community\r\n\r\norganisations.   Endless educational  programmes  and  social\r\n\r\nprojects  will be launched in order to qualitatively  achieve\r\n\r\nthe improved cohesion of our people.  In my view, funding for\r\n\r\nall these projects will be very essential.  For the community\r\n\r\norganisations who are well funded by their well wishers, they\r\n\r\nshould  have no difficulty in participating strongly in  this\r\n\r\nlong   enduring   project.   However,  for  those   who   are\r\n\r\nfinancially  weak  they  might have to  place  the  community\r\n\r\ncohesion  promotion programme in lower priority.   We  should\r\n\r\nenhance  the  funding  to  provide  adequate  funds  for  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations, so\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  they  could  respond  fully to  the  national  call  in\r\n\r\ndeveloping  community  cohesion.  So far,  I  know  that  MCD\r\n\r\nalways  receives  one of the smallest budgets  in  the  past.\r\n\r\nWith  this new emphasis, I hope more funds could be allocated\r\n\r\nto MCD in the coming budget session.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  the  Environment  mentioned about  the  issue  of  water.\r\n\r\nBesides  developing  the  water catchment  in  Marina  South,\r\n\r\nwidening  the  sources  of  water  supply  and  desalination,\r\n\r\nindustrial water was mentioned.  In fact, recycled water will\r\n\r\nbe  one of the important sources of water supply in our water\r\n\r\nscarce  island.  Our sewer system throws away more than  what\r\n\r\nwe   have  consumed,  in  terms  of  the  amount  of   water.\r\n\r\nConsidering the fact that our catchment could produce half of\r\n\r\nthe  water we consume, with the water entering into the sewer\r\n\r\nsystem being recycled once, we will be self-sufficient in our\r\n\r\nwater  needs at the present stage, except that the cost would\r\n\r\nbe higher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that the Jurong industrial area might\r\n\r\nbe  using recycled water for certain industrial applications.\r\n\r\nI  hope  that the experience we learn from this project  will\r\n\r\nlead to a wider application in recycled water and an increase\r\n\r\nin its volume of production.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are developing newer HDB townships and Marina\r\n\r\nSouth,  we  should consider the dual water supply  system  to\r\n\r\ncater  for  both the recycled water and potable water.    The\r\n\r\ndeep  tunnel sewer system we plan to build should  also  take\r\n\r\nthe   recycled  water  into  consideration.   If   practical,\r\n\r\nseparate industrial effluent, which is contaminated by  heavy\r\n\r\nmetals  and toxic substance, from the non-polluted sewer,  so\r\n\r\nthat the recycled water from the cleaner source could be used\r\n\r\nfor producing water for better application.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the Ministry of National Development is\r\n\r\nconsidering to increase the production of food in meeting the\r\n\r\nlocal  demand and reduce the excessive dependence on  foreign\r\n\r\nsupply.  In my\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nview,  this  is  a healthy approach to ensure food  security.\r\n\r\nThe  recent  experience  of  animal  diseases  and  excessive\r\n\r\npesticide used in farm products taught us to be more cautious\r\n\r\nabout over dependence on foreign imports.  Besides increasing\r\n\r\nour  food  production using mechanised and intensive  farming\r\n\r\ntechnologies,  we  should also take  pains  to  develop  more\r\n\r\nforeign sources of supply to cater for the shock due  to  the\r\n\r\nshortage of supply, like the recent shortage of pork supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For increasing the local farm production, I am concerned\r\n\r\nabout  the shortage of manpower which we already face in  the\r\n\r\npresent  high-tech farms.  At present, the high-tech  farmers\r\n\r\nare only allowed to hire foreign workers from the traditional\r\n\r\nsource,  meaning Malaysians.  The Malaysian workers  are  not\r\n\r\nvery  keen  to  work  in  the farms  due  to  the  relatively\r\n\r\nunpleasant working environment and the reward is not as  good\r\n\r\nas   those   involved  in  the  renovation  and  construction\r\n\r\nindustries.  The farmers are really desperate in looking  for\r\n\r\nmanpower  supply  from  non-traditional  sources,  but  their\r\n\r\napplications were not granted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Ministry is contemplating increasing food\r\n\r\nsupply  as  a  means  to  achieve a  stronger  food  security\r\n\r\nposition, I hope that this matter of foreign workers from the\r\n\r\nnon-traditional source could be properly dealt  with  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower.  Otherwise, in my view, it is difficult\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  realise our dream of reducing our dependence  on\r\n\r\nforeign food supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the motion standing in the\r\n\r\nname of Mr Davinder Singh.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  thank you for the opportunity to speak in this  debate.\r\n\r\nI  rise  to  speak  in  support of the motion  to  thank  the\r\n\r\nPresident for his Speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am most encouraged to hear the President identify\r\n\r\npeople  as  the  major focus of Government's  policy  in  the\r\n\r\ncoming years, and of Singapore 21 as a key programme of  this\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore 21 identifies the family as one of the five\r\n\r\npillars that will enable us to build on what we already  have\r\n\r\nand  create a strong and vibrant nation, and a home  that  we\r\n\r\nwill all dearly love in the next millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President also spoke on the ageing of our\r\n\r\npopulation.  Notwithstanding all our initiatives and  efforts\r\n\r\nto  keep  the  majority  of our senior citizens  healthy  and\r\n\r\nactive contributors, as our population ages, there will be  a\r\n\r\ngrowing number of older persons who will need care.  The main\r\n\r\ncare  givers  of  these dependent older persons  will  remain\r\n\r\ntheir families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent MCD-IPS Conference on Ageing in Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe  invited  speaker shared that in the UK,  families  still\r\n\r\nremain  strongly committed to caring for their older members,\r\n\r\nbut   are   increasingly  struggling  under  the  burden   of\r\n\r\ndischarging  these  responsibilities, with  the  increase  in\r\n\r\nlongevity and the co-existence in families of three  or  even\r\n\r\nfour  generations.   He  argued that leaving  the  family  to\r\n\r\nstruggle  on  its  own unaided is to take a  very  short-term\r\n\r\nview,  as  not  only might a good portion of  these  families\r\n\r\nbreak  under  the  pressure, there might be adverse  economic\r\n\r\nconsequences,  such as the cost of providing health  care  to\r\n\r\nexhausted carers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our families in Singapore are, fortunately,\r\n\r\ngenerally not yet under such pressure at the moment,  as  our\r\n\r\npopulation is currently still much younger than that  of  the\r\n\r\nEuropean countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the study on the Singapore Family, commissioned\r\n\r\nby MCD, which was recently released, presents a happy picture\r\n\r\nof  families largely in good and healthy condition.   But  as\r\n\r\nthe  President  himself has stated,  we  must  start  now  to\r\n\r\nprepare  to address future needs.  And Government has  always\r\n\r\nhad a tradition of planning very long term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study did identify five sources of stress in our\r\n\r\nfamilies.  Of the five, the two main stressors are related to\r\n\r\nlivelihood which includes, amongst other things,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinancial situation and employment, and role obligations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to focus attention today on the care givers in\r\n\r\nour  families,  addressing these two main stressors.   It  is\r\n\r\nimportant for us to keep our care givers strong and sound and\r\n\r\nwhole, as only through this can we, in the longer term,  keep\r\n\r\nour  families  strong and sound and whole.   Care  givers  in\r\n\r\nfamilies  can be both men and women, although at the  present\r\n\r\ntime, they are very largely the women in families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1998 Labour Force Survey it is reported that\r\n\r\nwomen make up 42% of our 1.9 million work force in Singapore.\r\n\r\nOf  these  806,000 women, 449,000  are married and  therefore\r\n\r\ndefinitely needing to balance work and home responsibilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the single women who are working doubtless have\r\n\r\nalso  family and home responsibilities to shoulder, but  that\r\n\r\nis another subject for another day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Survey reports there are 390,400 economically\r\n\r\ninactive persons aged from 25 to 54 years.  Of these, 360,000\r\n\r\nof  them or 92% are women, and the reasons they give for  not\r\n\r\nworking  are  housework (69%), child care  (23%),  and  elder\r\n\r\ncare,  at this point of time, only just a bit below  1%.   Of\r\n\r\nthese  economically  inactive persons  in  Singapore,  49,000\r\n\r\nindicated  that they would want to return to work within  the\r\n\r\nnext two years.  Of these, almost 37,000 are women in the  20\r\n\r\nto  49  years  age group.  Interestingly, 51% of these  women\r\n\r\nhave  at least secondary education, in other words, they  are\r\n\r\nwhat we would classify as skilled workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we help preserve the energy and the well-being of\r\n\r\nthese  care  givers in the family, at the  same  time  enable\r\n\r\ntheir continued contribution to the nation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Manpower 21 Committee has obviously studied these\r\n\r\nnumbers, and has outlined some proposed solutions in  one  of\r\n\r\nits   strategies,  Transforming  the  Work  Environment.    I\r\n\r\nstrongly   support  the  points  raised  in  this   strategy,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the encouragement of flexible work arrangements\r\n\r\nand job redesign, and I would like to expand a little on this\r\n\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Manpower 21 Report indicates that we have a long way\r\n\r\nto  go  with  regard  to  flexible  work  arrangements.   The\r\n\r\npercentage  of  our  workforce in flexible work  arrangements\r\n\r\nstands at less than 1% compared to the US at 28%, the  UK  at\r\n\r\n12% and Japan at 8.7%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me paint the spectrum of options it is possible to\r\n\r\noffer  individuals so that they may try to match  these  with\r\n\r\ntheir  particular requirements in balancing family and  work,\r\n\r\nand  to  draw  on some actual working examples to demonstrate\r\n\r\nthat these arrangements are in fact eminently do-able.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, when the care giver needs, wants, and can\r\n\r\nmanage  to work full-time hours, flexibility in starting  and\r\n\r\nending times in the work day can facilitate balancing of work\r\n\r\nand home schedules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, flexibility in how these hours are\r\n\r\norganised can compress the work week and, for example, enable\r\n\r\nmore  days  off  in the week to attend to family  chores  and\r\n\r\nstill perhaps have a day left over for a breather.  If I  may\r\n\r\ngive  a working example, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from my  own\r\n\r\nworkplace, we have nurses, all of whom work 42 hours a  week,\r\n\r\nbut  in different units, work on a six-day, five-day or four-day  rotation.  The staff on the four-day rotation  work  12-hour  shifts  but get three days off in a week to  attend  to\r\n\r\nother matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if the duties at home are more onerous and the\r\n\r\ncare  giver  cannot manage a full-time job, making  available\r\n\r\npart-time jobs or job sharing.  Certain jobs are very  easily\r\n\r\nstructured  for  part-time staffing or job sharing,  and  all\r\n\r\nthat  may be required may simply be a willingness to consider\r\n\r\ndoing  things differently from the past.  Other jobs are  not\r\n\r\nso  obviously  suitable, and this is where some job  redesign\r\n\r\nwould be most helpful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, for those, usually young mothers who wish to take\r\n\r\na  period,  perhaps a few years, off to see a  child  through\r\n\r\ninfancy and early childhood, there are examples\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhow  this  can be facilitated, and the woman helped to  phase\r\n\r\nback  into the job and workplace.  For example, Lombard North\r\n\r\nCentral,  a finance house in the UK, allows parents  extended\r\n\r\nleave of up to five years to care for babies and toddlers, on\r\n\r\nthe  condition that they spend at least two weeks a year back\r\n\r\nin  the  office, to maintain contacts and update  skills,  so\r\n\r\nthat the transition back to the job later becomes simpler and\r\n\r\nsmoother.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, our Civil Service has set a fine example of\r\n\r\nallowing  no  pay leave after childbirth for child  care  for\r\n\r\nmothers  of  up  to  four  years  per  child,  and  part-time\r\n\r\nemployment  for married women who are not able to work  full-time due to child care and family commitments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who have been out of the workplace for a long\r\n\r\nwhile,  and  become very out of touch, who are  afraid  their\r\n\r\nskills  may  have become obsolete, or just do  not  have  the\r\n\r\nconfidence  to  go  back to work, the investment  in  putting\r\n\r\ntogether  a short refresher course, with no strings attached,\r\n\r\nfor such potential returning employees yields enough in terms\r\n\r\nof the recruitment of good candidates to be well justified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again a real working example - albeit just a small\r\n\r\npilot  programme  -  of  a  two week refresher  course  which\r\n\r\nattracted six participants out of 15 nurses contacted who had\r\n\r\nstopped  work  some years prior, of whom five felt  confident\r\n\r\nand  competent  enough after the course to  return  to  work.\r\n\r\nThis  is  quite a promising outcome for such a rare commodity\r\n\r\nas experienced nurses!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, of course, there are jobs that will allow\r\n\r\nteleworking  from  home, particularly with the  possibilities\r\n\r\nnow as Singapore becomes more and more a fully wired island.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if we could marry this palette of options with the\r\n\r\navailability  of workplace on-site or near-site multi-service\r\n\r\nchild  and  elder care centres, we will have a picture   that\r\n\r\nwill surely brighten the homes of our families in the future.\r\n\r\nAnd in this instance,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhopefully  as near a future as we can possibly make it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully recognise of course that all of this is far\r\n\r\neasier  said  than done, and certainly not  all  options  are\r\n\r\npossible  for  all  jobs  in  all companies.  Companies  will\r\n\r\nunderstandably  hesitate and need convincing that  these  are\r\n\r\ninitiatives that will be well worth the effort, and  in  fact\r\n\r\nmake sense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where Government has a role to play, and should\r\n\r\ntake the lead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it can give encouragement in terms of tangible\r\n\r\nsupport,  as indeed I believe the intention is under Manpower\r\n\r\n21,  in  the  sourcing of consultancy in  job  redesign,  and\r\n\r\ngrants to defray the costs incurred.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Government can commission local cost benefit\r\n\r\nstudies  relating to the retention of skilled and experienced\r\n\r\nstaff.  Companies need to be convinced to make the effort  to\r\n\r\nengage   in   job  redesign.  Down  to  earth   bottom   line\r\n\r\nconsiderations  are far more likely to move  them  than  warm\r\n\r\nfuzzy arguments about keeping the family whole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many companies in the US and Europe have studied the\r\n\r\nsituation  and  have been convinced enough to implement  many\r\n\r\nsuch family friendly practices.  They are surely no less hard-nosed   about   their  bottom  lines  than  our   own   local\r\n\r\ncorporations. Britain's Midlands Bank, for example, estimated\r\n\r\nthat  the  cost of losing and replacing an experienced  staff\r\n\r\nmember  was  equivalent to the employee's  annual  employment\r\n\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I can see that some of our local companies may\r\n\r\nnot  be convinced that the US and European experience can  be\r\n\r\ndirectly transposed to our situation. We need therefore local\r\n\r\ndata to convince them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, commercial enterprises often cite the\r\n\r\nunavailability of space and cost as reasons  why  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  for  them  to provide workplace childcare  centres.\r\n\r\nPerhaps an equally good, if not better,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noption  will be for Government in its town planning to factor\r\n\r\nin  the requirement to provide for multi-service care centres\r\n\r\nwithin  each  big office and commercial  development.   These\r\n\r\ncentres  can  be run by a variety of agencies, to  serve  the\r\n\r\nsurrounding offices and companies.  This will be particularly\r\n\r\nhelpful for smaller companies which do not have the resources\r\n\r\nto do this themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken so far on supporting the Manpower 21\r\n\r\nproposal  to  Transform  the  Work  Environment.   There  is,\r\n\r\nhowever,  another piece of transformation that also needs  to\r\n\r\noccur  to preserve the strength of our families and to  allow\r\n\r\nits  individual members to fully develop their potential, and\r\n\r\nin  so doing contribute to both the economic and non-economic\r\n\r\nviability of our nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This transformation is in the mindset and traditional\r\n\r\nperception  of roles in the family, and the traditional  view\r\n\r\nalso  of care givers in the family.  Better sharing of  roles\r\n\r\nand  responsibilities between wives and husbands, and mothers\r\n\r\nand fathers will ultimately help families manage much better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will resist the temptation to take a familiar\r\n\r\nSingaporean  approach,  to ask for  a  National  Campaign  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate this change in mindset.  We can achieve  the  same\r\n\r\nresult  by  sending  out  a clear and  strong  message  about\r\n\r\nsharing  roles and responsibilities in families, but we  must\r\n\r\nsupport  this message consistently in policies and in  action\r\n\r\nthat are not ambivalent but fully in line with the message.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will take time, as all efforts to change attitudes\r\n\r\nand  behaviour do, and so all the more reason  that  we  must\r\n\r\nstart  now.   And  in this, I would like to  call  the  Civil\r\n\r\nService  to  start  the ball rolling, and take  the  lead  in\r\n\r\nsetting   the   example   by   giving,   in   its   benefits,\r\n\r\nacknowledgement to fatherhood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This it can do by simply extending those of its benefits\r\n\r\nrelating  to child care, currently only for working  mothers,\r\n\r\nto  either  parent.  I expect that it will be quite  a  while\r\n\r\nbefore we see a deluge of fathers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplying  for  a couple of years off for child  rearing,  but\r\n\r\neven  now  I  am sure many fathers are more than prepared  to\r\n\r\ntake a sick child to the doctor.  By extending the sick child\r\n\r\nleave  entitlement of five days per year per child under  six\r\n\r\nyears of age to be taken by either parent will truly send out\r\n\r\nthat  message loud and clear that fathers also  can  be  care\r\n\r\ngivers in the family.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Peng Kee):</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak. I\r\n\r\nthought I should  make a short response to one or two  points\r\n\r\nin  Mr Jeyaretnam's speech.  He brings up certain allegations\r\n\r\nagainst  the  police and CNB.  The bottom line  is  that,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  we  have  had long debates in the past before  on  the\r\n\r\npowers of police and law enforcement agencies.  Let me assure\r\n\r\nhim,  as  well as this House, once again that the police  and\r\n\r\nlaw  enforcement  agencies  have the  trust  and  respect  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and would not do anything that will betray  that\r\n\r\ntrust.   That  is why Singapore indeed is one of  the  safest\r\n\r\ncities in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first point is about suspects not being\r\n\r\ninformed about grounds of arrest when a person is arrested by\r\n\r\nthe  police.   My understanding of police procedure  is  that\r\n\r\nwhen  a  person is arrested he is informed generally  of  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  he is arrested.  Of course, in some  situations,\r\n\r\nfor example, when he is struggling, that may not be possible,\r\n\r\nbut he is informed as soon as reasonable thereafter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other more substantive point is the case that he\r\n\r\nbrings  up,  ie, the CNB raid on Madam Doulath Beevi's  flat.\r\n\r\nMr  Jeyaretnam says that because there is no search  warrant,\r\n\r\ntherefore, CNB officers had violated the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the general point must be that the police, CNB and\r\n\r\nother law enforcement agencies enforce the law.  They do  not\r\n\r\nact beyond the law.  They do not break the law.  For example,\r\n\r\nin  this  case,  section 24(1) of the  Misuse  of  Drugs  Act\r\n\r\nprovides  that  any officer of the Bureau  may  at  any  time\r\n\r\nwithout a warrant enter and search\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany  place  or premises in which it reasonably believes  that\r\n\r\nthere  is to be found any controlled drug.  Here, there  were\r\n\r\ncircumstances which led CNB officers to believe that  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation  had occurred.  CNB would put up a fuller  response\r\n\r\nin  the  press  on the background.  But let  me  assure  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  because this slur has been cast earlier on, that  the\r\n\r\nCNB had indeed acted within the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 24th August this year, acting on information\r\n\r\nreceived,  CNB had arrested a person suspected to be  a  drug\r\n\r\ntrafficker.   He  was tested positive for  drug  consumption.\r\n\r\nCNB  continued  with investigations into his  activities  and\r\n\r\nmonitored  the  numbers on his pager.  As  a  result  of  the\r\n\r\nmonitoring, five flats were raided: four of which,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nyielded  positive results.  For the fifth flat, Madam Beevi's\r\n\r\nflat, there were grounds for making the raid.  In fact, a few\r\n\r\ndays  after  the  arrest of the trafficker,  the  residential\r\n\r\ntelephone  number subscribed by Madam Beevi appeared  on  the\r\n\r\npager six times that day.  Hence, a team of CNB officers  was\r\n\r\ndeployed  to  check  out the address on  1st  September.   On\r\n\r\narrival  at her flat, the officers noted that the hall  light\r\n\r\nand  the TV set were on.  The iron gate was unlocked but  the\r\n\r\nwooden  door  was locked.  The officers then knocked  on  the\r\n\r\ndoor  and identified themselves as CNB officers, contrary  to\r\n\r\nwhat  Madam  Beevi had stated.  The officers also  repeatedly\r\n\r\nknocked  on the door and identified themselves, as there  was\r\n\r\nno  response  from within.  Then the officers heard  movement\r\n\r\nwithin  the flat.  They were also able to see feet  shuffling\r\n\r\nfrom  the  gap between the door and the floor.  The  officers\r\n\r\nthen  gave a warning that a forced entry would be made.  This\r\n\r\nwarning was repeated several times in English and Malay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the circumstances were such that the officers in that\r\n\r\nsituation acted within the law and procedures, and  gave  the\r\n\r\nnecessary warning.  Sir, this assurance to the House ought to\r\n\r\nbe  made,  so that no one leaves this Chamber today  thinking\r\n\r\nthat any Police or CNB officers had acted beyond the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I ask for a clarification, Sir?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Did the Police make good the door\r\n\r\nthat has been damaged during the raid and pay for the cost of\r\n\r\nit?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

I understand that Madam Beevi has made  a  request\r\n\r\nwhich  CNB  has referred to the AG's Chambers.   So  that  is\r\n\r\nbeing considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  first, I wish to thank the President for his  inspiring\r\n\r\nAddress.  It should give all Singaporeans a reaffirmed  sense\r\n\r\nof  comfort and confidence, after we have experienced one  of\r\n\r\nour worst economic crises since independence.  It is good  to\r\n\r\nbe  assured  that  Singapore has emerged  stronger  and  more\r\n\r\nunited.  But, although we have reasons to be optimistic about\r\n\r\nthe  economic  outlook, I feel we should not be too  euphoric\r\n\r\nand lulled into a false sense of security.  We have to keep a\r\n\r\nmore balanced perspective of the present economic situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that less than a year ago, the\r\n\r\neconomic  outlook  of  our region was going  through  a  dark\r\n\r\ntunnel with no light in sight.  And now, hardly a year later,\r\n\r\nwe are charged with anticipation and optimism.  The share and\r\n\r\nproperty  market  has made more than a significant  recovery.\r\n\r\nThe  positive  sentiment has returned.   The  expectation  is\r\n\r\ngetting  higher and higher - increase in CPF points, increase\r\n\r\nin  wages,  higher year-end bonus.  In short, there  is  much\r\n\r\njubilation and contentment in the air.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us pause for a moment and make a more sombre\r\n\r\nassessment,  and ask ourselves: Has the economic  fundamental\r\n\r\nchanged  that  much?   Has  the  economic  situation  of  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries truly recovered?  Is  the  future  as\r\n\r\nbright as we make up to be?  Perhaps we have been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoo  much  influenced by the speed of the  recovery  and  the\r\n\r\nmainly sentiment-driven projection.  The reality remains that\r\n\r\ntrouble  is  still brewing in the region.  The  situation  in\r\n\r\nEast Timor can be classified as unpredictable, at best.   And\r\n\r\nthe  outlook of the Indonesian presidential election is still\r\n\r\nuncertain.   The same can be said of the Malaysian  election.\r\n\r\nThe  economic  decline of the Philippines  and  the  rest  of\r\n\r\nASEAN,  including  Korea and Japan, has only  been  arrested.\r\n\r\nBut  the sign of recovery is still at an early stage and from\r\n\r\nnow  on,  everything is still fluid.  Nobody can be  sure  of\r\n\r\nwhich  direction it would turn, although there  are  positive\r\n\r\nsigns that recovery is well on its way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some unexpected turn of events can change the whole\r\n\r\nsituation.  All in all, even the most optimistic forecast can\r\n\r\nonly  be that the crisis is well over.  But the light we  see\r\n\r\nat  the  end  of  the  tunnel is still  very  dim.   Although\r\n\r\nSingapore  has always been said to be the least  affected  by\r\n\r\nthe  crisis, and because of our good governance and planning,\r\n\r\nwe  will  be  able  to  take  off  faster  than  any  of  our\r\n\r\nneighbours.   There remains some very difficult times  ahead.\r\n\r\nThe  projection  of  GDP  growth  is  not  widespread.   Many\r\n\r\nsectors,   such  as  construction  and  many  categories   in\r\n\r\nmanufacturing, are still experiencing negative  growth.   And\r\n\r\nwith an uncertain regional as well as global outlook, we need\r\n\r\nto   be   cautiously   optimistic.   The  business   outlook,\r\n\r\nespecially in the private sector, is not that rosy.   Not  at\r\n\r\nthe  moment  anyway.  But it is important for us to  be  more\r\n\r\npragmatic  and remain vigilant, and not place our expectation\r\n\r\ntoo high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's timely reminder of the importance of\r\n\r\ndeveloping our people and strengthening our social bonds must\r\n\r\nbe  taken most seriously.  Although we have experienced  some\r\n\r\neconomic  and  social hiccups in the past, especially  during\r\n\r\nour  early  turbulent years, for the past  15  or  20  years,\r\n\r\ngenerally we have lived a peaceful and secure life.  The  few\r\n\r\nproblems we have experienced are relatively minor and nowhere\r\n\r\nnear  crisis  proportion.  So are we  prepared  for  a  major\r\n\r\ncrisis,  as  that had befallen some unfortunate countries  in\r\n\r\nthe world?  As a nation, how would we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreact  to  this crisis situation?  If a similar situation  of\r\n\r\nwhat occurred in East Timor, Bosnia or Kuwait somehow happens\r\n\r\nto  us, will our people be able to pull together and fight to\r\n\r\nthe end?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has through the years consciously\r\n\r\npromoted a sense of belonging and love of our nation.  It has\r\n\r\nprovided  every Singaporean a stake in our country.   It  has\r\n\r\nhelped  everyone  own  a home and shares in  Government-owned\r\n\r\ncompanies, and give everyone equal opportunities  to  make  a\r\n\r\nsuccess   in  life.   All  this,  in  the  hope  that   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  takes  root  in our  country.   But  Singapore's\r\n\r\nhistory  is  still  very  young.   Will  the  people  be   as\r\n\r\nvulnerable  as the \"instant\" trees we planted throughout  the\r\n\r\nisland  to transform Singapore into a Garden City in  such  a\r\n\r\nshort time?  For although they have grown fast and beautiful,\r\n\r\nas those that take years to mature, the moment of truth comes\r\n\r\nwhen  a  thunder storm strikes.  Many of these instant  trees\r\n\r\nfall  because much as they look big and lush, the  roots  are\r\n\r\nnot  deep and the branches are brittle.  They have not passed\r\n\r\nthe test of time as those which took years to grow.  Have our\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  who have only experienced  a  few  decades  of\r\n\r\nnationhood,  developed  strong branches  and  deep  roots  to\r\n\r\nwithstand any onslaught crisis, be it economic, political  or\r\n\r\nreligious,  or worse of all, an invasion by an over-ambitious\r\n\r\nneighbour?  This will still remain a very big question mark.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is comforting to note that we have a strong\r\n\r\nSAF  which  possesses the most advanced weapon and equipment,\r\n\r\nas  well as a well-trained fighting force, ultimately  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  the weapon or even the well-trained soldiers alone  that\r\n\r\ncan  win  the  war.  Throughout history we  have  known  many\r\n\r\nbattles  had been won by a lesser number of men and  weapons,\r\n\r\nand through an indomitable will to fight.  We have read about\r\n\r\nextreme  bravery  in  battle.  But it  was  usually  not  the\r\n\r\nphysical  strength  that  made the soldier  fight  above  his\r\n\r\nlimit,  but  his courage and total commitment to his  country\r\n\r\nthat gave him his strength.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, while it is important for us to focus on\r\n\r\npeople development and social cohesion and religious harmony,\r\n\r\nensuring the sharing of wealth by everyone, most importantly,\r\n\r\nwe   have   to  instill  loyalty  and  patriotism  in   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean.  We must make everyone understand what is  meant\r\n\r\nby the Chinese words guo jia (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;); xian you guo, hou\r\n\r\nyou jia (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). It means that\r\n\r\nour  country must come first before our home.  If our country\r\n\r\nfalls,  our  home  no  longer exists.  To  ensure  continuous\r\n\r\nexistence  of Singapore to have material possession,  a  good\r\n\r\nlife alone cannot motivate our people to stay and defend  our\r\n\r\ncountry  when  threatened.  The fulfilment of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\ndream  cannot  ensure unquestionable loyalty to  our  nation,\r\n\r\nbecause  this dream can turn into a nightmare when things  go\r\n\r\nwrong,  and it can from time to time, no matter how  well  we\r\n\r\ngovern ourselves and how carefully we plan for the future, as\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  extremely  vulnerable  to  external   factors.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we must develop a national pride and love for  our\r\n\r\nland.   We must make everyone proud to be a Singaporean.   It\r\n\r\nis  this emotional attachment that could distinguish us as  a\r\n\r\nnation of patriots from a nation of immigrants, who may  feel\r\n\r\ntempted to move on if they find that the pasture on the other\r\n\r\nside  of  the fence is greener.  Only then when we are  faced\r\n\r\nwith  adversity, we will all stand up and fight and not  pack\r\n\r\nup and go.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate be now adjourned. - [Mr Wong Kan\r\n\r\nSeng].\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Debate to be resumed what day, Mr\r\n\r\nDavinder Singh?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davinder Singh:</b> Tomorrow, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>THE NEED TO PRIORITISE PREVENTIVE HEALTHCARE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.14 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, today I would like to entreat the Ministry of Health  to\r\n\r\nprioritise  preventive healthcare as the paramount  directive\r\n\r\nfor the next few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adage \"prevention is better than cure\" succinctly\r\n\r\ndefines a fact that everyone would accept wholeheartedly.  In\r\n\r\nterms  of  maintaining  the best  state  of  health  for  any\r\n\r\npopulation,  preventive medicine, rather than  an  excess  of\r\n\r\nhealthcare  facilities and services to cure the sick,  is  in\r\n\r\nline  with the adage and is a fact that each one of  us  here\r\n\r\nwould also accept wholeheartedly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must pursue all avenues to help the healthy\r\n\r\nmaintain  their well-being for as long as possible.   In  the\r\n\r\nlong run, it will be the continuous and concerted efforts  in\r\n\r\npromoting preventive medicine that provides the best  quality\r\n\r\nlife  and contains the escalating cost of healthcare for  the\r\n\r\npeople  and the nation.  It is proven that if we can  succeed\r\n\r\nin preventing the development of diseases in the first place,\r\n\r\nwe  would have achieved the ideal.  Classic examples of  this\r\n\r\nwould  be  in  the management of hypertension,  diabetes  and\r\n\r\nhyper-cholesterolaemia, which predispose patients to cerebro-vascular  diseases.   Well-informed patients  generally  have\r\n\r\nbetter outcome and better compliance with their treatment and\r\n\r\ndo  lead  quality life for much longer.  They are spared  the\r\n\r\nincapacitating and results of strokes, heart attacks or renal\r\n\r\nfailure.   They are spared the agony of having to suffer  and\r\n\r\nthe  nation  is spared the burden of having to  pay  for  the\r\n\r\nenormous   costs  of  treatment.   Sir,  the   rewards   from\r\n\r\npreventive medicine will be immense if it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  done swiftly and if it is targeted towards the population\r\n\r\nas  a whole.  The expenses now will yield abundant savings in\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health allocates only 13%, or\r\n\r\nthereabouts,  of  its budget towards primary  and  preventive\r\n\r\nhealthcare at the moment.  Sir, this clearly shows  that  the\r\n\r\nemphasis on preventive medicine by the Ministry of Health  is\r\n\r\ndismal.   The  1998 National Health Survey has revealed  that\r\n\r\nmore  Singaporeans have hypertension, high blood cholesterol,\r\n\r\ndiabetes  and  obesity now when compared to the situation  in\r\n\r\n1992.   The  incidence rate of cervical cancer  had  declined\r\n\r\nonly  very  slightly  despite the availability  of  pap-smear\r\n\r\nscreening tests for women in Singapore in the past 30  years.\r\n\r\nThe  four  leading causes of death in Singapore are  cancers,\r\n\r\nheart  diseases, pneumonia and cerebro-vascular diseases,  in\r\n\r\nthat   order.    Deaths  from  these  diseases  are   largely\r\n\r\npreventable  and many potential cases can be averted  through\r\n\r\npreventive healthcare.  The resultant effect will be  reduced\r\n\r\nillnesses and increased quality life for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health must have a new mindset and\r\n\r\napproach  in terms of preventive medicine if we  want  to  do\r\n\r\nmuch  more than we have so far.  Why should the Ministry take\r\n\r\non this job single-handedly when we can tap all our resources\r\n\r\nto give effective and positive results?  Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that the Ministry of Health harness our  doctors  in\r\n\r\nboth  the  private and public sectors and have an  integrated\r\n\r\neffort towards enhancement of preventive healthcare.  We have\r\n\r\nalready  in  place qualified and competent doctors  that  can\r\n\r\npromote  preventive healthcare efficiently.  We  can  have  a\r\n\r\ngood go at it and I urge the Minister for Health to implement\r\n\r\ndirectives  in  this important area of healthcare.   Perhaps,\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Health would consider what I have in mind  in\r\n\r\nnine areas as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To take off in this area of healthcare, the Ministry\r\n\r\nmust  first  want to revamp the existing model of  healthcare\r\n\r\nand put up a bold and comprehensive new method of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimplementation  of preventive healthcare.  More  funding  and\r\n\r\nallocation of personnel in preventive medicine have to be put\r\n\r\nin  place.  The very crux of the issue is to reach out to the\r\n\r\npeople and efforts in this matter must be expanded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Government, as the largest single employer in\r\n\r\nthe  country, must take the initiative and provide  free  and\r\n\r\nbasic  medical healthcare for all civil servants on a regular\r\n\r\nbasis.   Spending in this area now will be worthwhile in  the\r\n\r\nlonger  term.  We will be rewarded in time with  a  healthier\r\n\r\nworkforce.   The  quality of life for  the  workers  will  be\r\n\r\nenhanced   because  they  will  be  less  prone  to   chronic\r\n\r\ndebilitating diseases in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Expanding on the previous point, the Government\r\n\r\nshould  work  with more companies to facilitate  and  promote\r\n\r\npreventive medicine.  As an example, more doctors and  nurses\r\n\r\ncan  be  made available to help companies conduct  preventive\r\n\r\ncheck-ups  and to give talks on various topics of  preventive\r\n\r\nhealthcare.   When Prime Minister Goh launched  the  \"Healthy\r\n\r\nLifestyle Campaign\" this year, he said that the experience in\r\n\r\nmany  countries  around  the  world  has  shown  that  health\r\n\r\nprogrammes   do   help   control   medical   costs,   improve\r\n\r\nproductivity, reduce absenteeism and heighten staff morale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) There is a projected increase to about 800,000 aged\r\n\r\ncitizens  by the year 2030 and it is obvious that those  born\r\n\r\nin the 1950s and 1960s will make up a majority of the elderly\r\n\r\nof   tomorrow.   It  is  therefore  urgent  that  we   target\r\n\r\npreventive  medicine on these citizens who are now  in  their\r\n\r\n40s  and  50s.   Immediate and successful  implementation  of\r\n\r\npreventive  healthcare  now is necessary  as  many  of  these\r\n\r\npeople may lapse into chronic ill health very soon indeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there cannot be successful\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  anything unless the monetary  issues  are\r\n\r\naddressed.   I  would like to urge the Finance  Ministry  and\r\n\r\nHealth Ministry to facilitate the people\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  seek  preventive healthcare.  Perhaps, as a first  step,\r\n\r\ntax  incentives  could  be  given to  employers  who  provide\r\n\r\npreventive  healthcare  for  their  workers.   In   addition,\r\n\r\nindividuals  should  be  allowed to use  their  Medisave  and\r\n\r\nMediShield  accounts  to  fund  their  expenses   for   basic\r\n\r\npreventive healthcare.  I might venture to say that  allowing\r\n\r\nuse  of CPF funds for this purpose might even be superior  to\r\n\r\nallowing  use of CPF funds for life insurance.   Thirdly,  we\r\n\r\nshould endorse the use of Medifund for the extremely needy as\r\n\r\nthese people would probably be those who are most in need  of\r\n\r\npreventive healthcare but who are most deprived of it, either\r\n\r\ndue to ignorance or lack of funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The Ministry of Health should be proactive and\r\n\r\nremain  savvy  in keeping up with the changing  and  pressing\r\n\r\nproblems  that arise from time to time and be ever  ready  to\r\n\r\nalter course where necessary.  Being willing and prepared  to\r\n\r\nre-evaluate and scrap existing unsuccessful methods would  be\r\n\r\na good virtue to have.  Consider the pap smear screening test\r\n\r\nin  its  present  form.  It has been available  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nsince 1964 and yet the incidence rate for cervical cancer has\r\n\r\nnot  declined.  We should not have to wait 30  years  to  re-evaluate  this  failed  method, and should  have  implemented\r\n\r\nbetter methods long before now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Sir, whilst it would be ideal for us to handle all\r\n\r\ncancers  on  an  equal  basis, we have to  be  realistic  and\r\n\r\npractical.   We  should  pay  more  attention  to  the   more\r\n\r\nprevalent  and devastating of the cancers.  The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth must carry out comprehensive studies and elucidate the\r\n\r\nnecessary course of action.  Thus, preventive care  in  terms\r\n\r\nof  breast  cancer should be prioritised since breast  cancer\r\n\r\nis,  in  fact, the leading cancer amongst women in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThree  new  cases  of  breast cancer are  detected  daily  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  incidence of breast cancer is  expected  to\r\n\r\nincrease  from  32.9 per 100,000 women in 1985  to  55.1  per\r\n\r\n100,000  in year 2000.  By then, we are expecting  more  than\r\n\r\n1,000  new  cases  to  be diagnosed every  year.   Preventive\r\n\r\nhealthcare is important because early detection is the single\r\n\r\nmost important\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfactor  for  survival  of  patients.   25%  of  patients  who\r\n\r\npresented with breast cancers of 3 cm in size would have died\r\n\r\nfrom the disease five years after diagnosis and this would be\r\n\r\nin spite of their having received all forms of treatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) This next pointer involves acceptance of a new\r\n\r\nmindset  and  a  radical approach.  The  Ministry  of  Health\r\n\r\nshould  involve the primary healthcare doctors in  preventive\r\n\r\nhealthcare  because  they are already looking  after  80%  of\r\n\r\npatients at the level of primary healthcare.  I must, at this\r\n\r\njuncture,  declare  that I am a doctor in  private  practice.\r\n\r\nPreventive  care often involves giving a lot  of  advice  and\r\n\r\npersuasion to the people directly.  General practitioners, as\r\n\r\nfamily physicians, have better rapport and more time with the\r\n\r\npatients,  are  eminently suited for this  function.   It  is\r\n\r\nknown   that   we  have  efficient  and  affordable   primary\r\n\r\nhealthcare  in  Singapore very much because we  have  a  good\r\n\r\nspread of GP clinics, enough competent doctors and relatively\r\n\r\ninexpensive  fees  for primary-care services  throughout  the\r\n\r\nisland.  It would be good if the Government could put forth a\r\n\r\nscheme  that  harnesses  this primary healthcare  sector  for\r\n\r\npreventive  medicine.  Not only will this be  cost  effective\r\n\r\nand efficient, this will also give patients the advantage  of\r\n\r\nincreased accessibility and convenience to this type of care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) The Ministry of Health should also prioritise\r\n\r\npreventive healthcare in terms of more public education.   It\r\n\r\nis  necessary for the public to be reminded that they  should\r\n\r\nand can maintain good health.  We must accept that it will be\r\n\r\nthrough continuous education and considerable patience before\r\n\r\nwe  can hope for a change of mindset amongst our people.   We\r\n\r\nmust  impress upon the people that they should not be seeking\r\n\r\nhealthcare only when they have become sick.  They  should  be\r\n\r\nencouraged to have routine medical check-ups to detect  early\r\n\r\nstage   diseases.   To  provide  for  more  scope  in  public\r\n\r\neducation,   we   need  to  provide  for  the   training   of\r\n\r\n\"facilitators\"  who  promote  preventive  healthcare.   These\r\n\r\n\"facilitators\"   may  be  polyclinic  nurses,   neighbourhood\r\n\r\ndoctors, community centre grassroots\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleaders  or  various  company  personnel  officers.   A  more\r\n\r\nintegrated  and  a  more consistent approach  island-wide  to\r\n\r\npromote  different aspects of preventive healthcare could  be\r\n\r\ninitiated.  The Community Development Councils (CDCs) or even\r\n\r\nthe  community centres can be involved in this area with  the\r\n\r\nguidance of the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the need to prioritise\r\n\r\npreventive  healthcare  must not be  underscored  and  should\r\n\r\ndefinitely  be  an important directive for  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth.  In order to further improve the health of the people\r\n\r\nand  enhance  the  healthcare in this  country  in  the  next\r\n\r\nmillennium, we ought to push for a prompt and serious  effort\r\n\r\non  the implementation of preventive healthcare.  Sir, we are\r\n\r\nfortunate here in Singapore as we have the means to afford  a\r\n\r\nworld-class  home  for  our people.   Nevertheless,  we  must\r\n\r\nalways  try  to strive for the better and desire  to  improve\r\n\r\nupon   what  we  have.   This  Government  has  always   been\r\n\r\ndiscerning  and  knows  what  is best  for  Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nSingapore.   I  am sure the Government knows  that  promoting\r\n\r\npreventive  healthcare is one of those items that  should  be\r\n\r\ntop  on  the  list of what is best for us.   My  concern,  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker,  Sir, is that we do not hasten  and  act  on\r\n\r\ngetting  what we need as a matter of urgency.  We do have  an\r\n\r\nabundance  of ideas and a fair measure of means to  get  what\r\n\r\nthe  world can offer, let us go for the quality life that  we\r\n\r\nwant all Singaporeans to have in their world-class home.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  first  let me thank the Member, Dr  Lily  Neo,  for\r\n\r\nbringing  up this issue.  Let me address two broad principles\r\n\r\nfirst before I take on the nine specific suggestions that she\r\n\r\nput up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the Ministry of Health agrees\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly with Dr Lily Neo that prevention is better and\r\n\r\nindeed  cheaper than cure. That philosophy is what is driving\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Health. Second, on the question of more money\r\n\r\nand  more  resources, by and large, I would  agree  that  the\r\n\r\nspending priorities of a Ministry reflect\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  priorities of the Ministry but one should be careful  in\r\n\r\nnot taking that statistic too far.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo mentioned that preventive healthcare takes\r\n\r\nup  only  13%  of  MOH's  budget and  that  the  emphasis  is\r\n\r\ntherefore   dismal.   As  Dr  Lily  Neo  herself   mentioned,\r\n\r\npreventive  healthcare  is  not that  expensive  compared  to\r\n\r\nhospitalisation. So, 13% does not mean that  we  do  not  put\r\n\r\nenough  priority  on preventive healthcare.  The  reason  why\r\n\r\npreventive  healthcare  is such a small  percentage  is  that\r\n\r\nhospitalisation   is  very  expensive  and   the   Government\r\n\r\nsubsidises  hospitalisation costs to a very large extent,  to\r\n\r\nthe tune of 80% for our Class C wards, 65% for Class B wards,\r\n\r\nand  so  on.   If the Government had subsidised our  Class  C\r\n\r\nwards  at  50%  rather  than 80%, and  the  other  wards  are\r\n\r\nsubsidised correspondingly, then overnight, the percentage of\r\n\r\nbudget  on  preventive healthcare would more than double,  to\r\n\r\nmore than 25%.  I am sure Dr Lily Neo would not say that this\r\n\r\nis  a  good statistic.  But 13% amounts to $130 million which\r\n\r\nis  being spent every year on preventive healthcare and  that\r\n\r\nis  not  a  small  sum.   We  do lay emphasis  on  preventive\r\n\r\nhealthcare. We are consistently looking out for new  ways  to\r\n\r\nimprove and how we should approach this issue, and therefore,\r\n\r\nwe are grateful to Dr Neo for bringing up some suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with the nine areas which she has brought\r\n\r\nup.   But for Members to understand these suggestions and put\r\n\r\nthem  into  context,  let me first explain  how  we  approach\r\n\r\npreventive  healthcare in the Ministry.  We divide preventive\r\n\r\nhealthcare into four areas.  The first component is  to  make\r\n\r\nsure we have the foundation for a healthy population and that\r\n\r\nmeans  very sound pre-natal/post-natal care and a very  sound\r\n\r\nschool  health and school dental programme. This  makes  sure\r\n\r\nthat  our population is given the best level of care  in  the\r\n\r\nearly  stages  of their lives and, therefore, they  have  the\r\n\r\nfoundation to keep their health sound.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members know our immunisation programme for our young\r\n\r\nchildren  is  among  the  best  in  the  world.   Our  infant\r\n\r\nmortality  rate  ranks among the lowest among  the  developed\r\n\r\ncountries.  Our track record is excellent.  Our school health\r\n\r\nand  dental  programme has done extremely well.  We  are,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, on the lookout to see how we can improve this better.\r\n\r\nSo  I  would say that for the first component on making  sure\r\n\r\nthat  our  population starts off healthy,  I  think  we  have\r\n\r\nachieved that to a large extent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second component is how to keep the adult\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  healthy, how to encourage them  to  maintain  a\r\n\r\nhealthy  lifestyle, ie, having given them a sound foundation,\r\n\r\nhow  to  maintain a healthy lifestyle throughout their lives.\r\n\r\nWe have started this campaign on Healthy Lifestyle many, many\r\n\r\nyears  ago.   We have had some limited successes but  we  are\r\n\r\nfighting  against  strong  odds.  Singaporeans  are   getting\r\n\r\nricher,  their food gets richer and their lifestyle  is  more\r\n\r\nsedentary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach to promoting a healthy lifestyle now takes\r\n\r\non  more than just a general exhortation of Singaporeans  but\r\n\r\nalso  targetting at different groups, ie, those groups  which\r\n\r\nare  more  vulnerable to a more sedentary  lifestyle  and  to\r\n\r\npoorer  healthy lifestyle habits.  We have taken the campaign\r\n\r\nto  the  workplace. We are targetting at people in their  30s\r\n\r\nand 40s because as Dr Neo herself mentioned, it is this group\r\n\r\nthat  would bring along their health problems later  on  when\r\n\r\nthey  grow  older.   But  promoting and  maintaining  healthy\r\n\r\nlifestyle  is  one  of  the  most  difficult  tasks  in   our\r\n\r\npreventive healthcare programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third component of our preventive healthcare\r\n\r\nprogramme is screening. We take a very targetted approach  to\r\n\r\nlook  at  those groups who are most vulnerable  and  try  and\r\n\r\ndetect  these groups early so that we can prevent the disease\r\n\r\nfrom  starting or from getting worse.  There is a lot in  the\r\n\r\nmedical  literature on the efficacy of the  different  health\r\n\r\nscreening procedure. The Ministry of Health here takes a very\r\n\r\npragmatic  approach. We do not advocate widespread  universal\r\n\r\nmedical screening.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We screen the population and we encourage screening\r\n\r\nwhere it is effective.  If somebody maintains his health  and\r\n\r\nhas  a  healthy lifestyle, there is very little that he needs\r\n\r\nto  do  in terms of medical screening.  If you do not  smoke,\r\n\r\nmaintain  your  weight  within a certain  recommended  range,\r\n\r\nevery  time you see your GP, he takes your blood pressure  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure that it is within the recommended range and if  it\r\n\r\nis  high you try to take measures to bring it down.  If every\r\n\r\nyear  you  take a simple blood test to check your cholesterol\r\n\r\nlevel  and blood sugar, that would give an indication whether\r\n\r\nyou are diabetic or not.  By and large, if people maintain  a\r\n\r\nhealthy lifestyle and take simple tests like these, we should\r\n\r\nbe  able to screen out those who are more vulnerable.  And  I\r\n\r\nthink  more  can  be done to target those  groups  which  are\r\n\r\nvulnerable. Some of the suggestions have been brought  up  by\r\n\r\nDr Lily Neo and I would go to them in detail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth component is what we call preventive\r\n\r\nhealthcare.    That  means  having detected  people  who  are\r\n\r\nvulnerable, for example, people who are diabetic, how do  you\r\n\r\nget  them  to manage their situation so that their  situation\r\n\r\ndoes  not  get worse and, in so doing, present more expensive\r\n\r\nhealthcare issues for us.  So that is the fourth category.  I\r\n\r\nwould  say  that  most of the suggestions that  Dr  Lily  Neo\r\n\r\nbrought  up  deal with the third and fourth categories,  that\r\n\r\nis,  how do we target the groups for screening, those who are\r\n\r\nmore  vulnerable, and also how do we better manage the groups\r\n\r\nwhich are diabetic or the older groups and that we can manage\r\n\r\ntheir health situations well enough so that they do not lapse\r\n\r\ninto more difficult problems for us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address the nine areas now. First, more funding\r\n\r\nand more people.  I think I have done that.  If a measure  is\r\n\r\nworthy  of  implementation, I can assure the House  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health will find the funds to implement  it.  So\r\n\r\nfunding is never a big problem with us.  But it does not mean\r\n\r\nthat we will throw good money and that we feel proud that  we\r\n\r\nhave  increased  the  amount of money we  spent.   It  really\r\n\r\ndepends on the usefulness of the programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Government should take the initiative as the\r\n\r\nbiggest  employer to provide free and basic medicare  to  all\r\n\r\ncivil servants.  Members know that is not our approach.   For\r\n\r\nhealthcare financing, the minimum that we would want is cost-sharing so that people value the services provided for  them.\r\n\r\nI  do  not  think  we  should walk away with  the  idea  that\r\n\r\nanything  that is free would solve the problem.  I  was  told\r\n\r\nthat we implemented a mammography screening project from 1994\r\n\r\nto  1997, but only half of the women turned up for screening,\r\n\r\neven  though the screening was provided free of  charge.   In\r\n\r\nother  words,  it  was  not the cost of  the  screening  that\r\n\r\ndeterred the women, but rather the lack of awareness  of  the\r\n\r\nneed  of  the screening, the fear of the screening  procedure\r\n\r\nand  sometimes, the fear of knowing the result that made half\r\n\r\nof  the  women not to turn up for the screening, even  though\r\n\r\nthe screening was provided entirely free.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that money cannot solve all problems. I\r\n\r\nthink  the  more difficult part of the problem is to  educate\r\n\r\nthe  population, to get them to understand the need and  also\r\n\r\nto  target  at  the  groups  that are  most  vulnerable.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  if you have free mammography screening, the  better\r\n\r\neducated  women who can best afford the fees would take  this\r\n\r\nup.   But the less educated women, maybe the 50% who did  not\r\n\r\nturn  up  for  the  screening, are  the  ones  who  are  more\r\n\r\nvulnerable.  I would think that the greater effort should  be\r\n\r\nat targetting the groups which are most vulnerable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area is to work with companies to conduct\r\n\r\ncheck-ups, etc.  I think this is one of the areas that we are\r\n\r\nembarking on, that is, to take preventive healthcare into the\r\n\r\ncompanies, into the workplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth area is to target at people in their 40s and\r\n\r\n50s.  I agree entirely with Dr Lily Neo.  I think we must try\r\n\r\nand address these age groups early rather than deal with them\r\n\r\nwhen they turn 60s.  By then, the problem is already there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the fifth area, Dr Neo suggested tax incentives for\r\n\r\nemployers who provide\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npreventive  healthcare.  I will pass this on to the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance but preventive healthcare programme, as I say, is\r\n\r\nnot very expensive and therefore, I am not sure how effective\r\n\r\nthis would be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo also suggested the use of Medisave for preventive\r\n\r\nhealthcare  cost.   There are no clear-cut arguments  for  or\r\n\r\nagainst  the use of Medisave.  We must realise that  Medisave\r\n\r\nsavings  can  only  meet a certain portion  of  our  lifetime\r\n\r\nhealthcare  cost.  If you spend it on preventive  healthcare,\r\n\r\nand  you  are  unfortunate  enough  to  have  an  episode  in\r\n\r\nhospital, then you have to dig into your pocket, and that can\r\n\r\nbe  a very expensive episode.  Alternatively, if people spend\r\n\r\nthis  small amount needed to keep their health in good shape,\r\n\r\nlike going to the GP which costs $20 or $30, where people pay\r\n\r\nout  of  their pocket, then they keep their Medisave for  the\r\n\r\nmore  costly episodes in the hospital.  So it does not really\r\n\r\nmatter  as  long  as  everybody saves and  that  saving  goes\r\n\r\ntowards paying part of the lifelong healthcare cost that  all\r\n\r\nof us will probably end up having to incur.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On pap-smear screening, I agree that our track record\r\n\r\nhas  not been such a sterling performance and that is because\r\n\r\nwe  have  not  made  it  universal. We  have  encouraged  and\r\n\r\nexhorted the women to go for pap-smear screening but  it  has\r\n\r\nnot  been universally made available.  We would look at  this\r\n\r\nprogramme because I think there are medical merits in running\r\n\r\npap-smear screening and we would see how this can be taken up\r\n\r\ntogether with mammography.  We have encouraged\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Breast Cancer Foundation and in the three years since  it\r\n\r\nhas  started,  it has done good work to promote awareness  of\r\n\r\nbreast  cancer  and  the  effectiveness  of  early  detection\r\n\r\nthrough  mammography.  My Ministry is also working  with  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations and CDCs to help encourage women  to\r\n\r\ngo  for  pap-smear  screening for cancer of  the  cervix  and\r\n\r\nmammography screening for breast cancer.  We are  piloting  a\r\n\r\npap-smear screening programme in Toa Payoh next year with the\r\n\r\nview to extending this programme on a nation wide basis later\r\n\r\nso  that  we  can  have  an effective outreach  programme  to\r\n\r\nprevent cancer of the cervix.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next area that we want to target at is the senior\r\n\r\ncitizens and to address this issue of affordability,  we  are\r\n\r\nhaving  a  geriatric screening programme with the College  of\r\n\r\nFamily  Physicians so as to draw in the GPs, and the  funding\r\n\r\nwould  be made through the Singapore Totalisator Board  which\r\n\r\nhad  agreed  to  subsidise 75% of the cost.   So  an  elderly\r\n\r\nperson  would co-pay only 25% of the cost, ie,  only  $5.  We\r\n\r\nwould embark this geriatric screening programme together with\r\n\r\nthe   College   of  Family  Physicians  and   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nTotalisator Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question having been proposed at Fourteen minutes\r\n\r\npast Five o'clock pm and the Debate having continued for half\r\n\r\nan  hour,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker adjourned  the  House  without\r\n\r\nQuestion put, pursuant to the Standing Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Sixteen</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Minutes to Six o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
