I will therefore not repeat them here. \n  <br> \n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1978/19780131/19780131-HA-0370299.htm\">figures - APPENDIX TO ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 1(Cols. 203-205)</a> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to Question 1(c), I would like to explain that the hours of work of doctors vary according to the posting. Normally doctors who are working in Outpatient Departments, for example, work office hours and they have a normal week of 42 hours. Those in the hospitals, besides their normal week of 42 hours, are required to perform night duties. If they have a night duty once a week, it will add 15 1/2 hours to the normal 42 hours quota, and if they do have two night-duty performances in a week, it will work out to about 72 hours in a normal week. In the Accidents and Emergency Department the doctors work on shifts and, therefore, they have a 42-hour week but they are given time off for night duties. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is a very vexing one because night duties are not necessarily applicable to all doctors working in hospitals. In our system we find that housemen and medical officers are asked to perform night duties. This means that they must be within the hospital precincts. Senior doctors, however, are on call which means that they can go home, attend to their family life or attend to their social life, but they have a bleeper and, if necessary, they can be called to the hospital. Sir, I am in sympathy with those who have to perform as many as two night duties in a week, especially those who are in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. As Members of the House are aware, babies do not tell doctors what time they are supposed to come out into the world. We therefore find that most doctors posted to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, including the Registrars and Senior Registrars, have a higher mean rate of weekly hours. They range from 68 hours for Registrars and Senior Registrars, 55 hours for Consultants, 78 and 79 hours for medical officers and housemen respectively. The problem, of course, really depends upon manpower. If there are more doctors available who can be rostered for night duty, then the number of hours per week worked by each doctor can be reduced. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must point out the distinction between hours of work and productivity. During the night, patients do not require much attention as most of them have been treated and attended to during the day. So during the night it is necessary to have only a small number of doctors for emergency calls. That is why they are asked to be within the hospital precincts. In the case of housemen, it has been a tradition that to be on night duty is part of their training. While we can permutate the roster, I am afraid that as of this moment it is not possible to reduce the number of night duties which are already allocated because of the existing staff position. If doctors are unable to perform night duty on a particular day, arrangements can be made for them to have substitutes. I think that is not a problem at all. However, I \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> do hope to make an in-depth study into this problem, and I do admit that it is an unsatisfactory position. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In New Zealand medical doctors of all grades are on call and this means that they must be within the precincts of the hospital. It is only the Consultants who are allowed to stay away from the hospital. That would be an excellent pattern for us to follow. So we will have to take some time to work out a re-arrangement of the night duty roster, and if we can have more manpower pitching in, I think the burden will be less both for the medical officers and housemen. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Development since hijacking incident)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether there has been any further development in our relations with the Vietnamese Government since the hijacking incident in October 1977. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr S.

As Members will recollect, the Vietnamese Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Phan Hien, came to Singapore in July 1976. A delegation from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce visited Vietnam in April 1977, and this was followed by an economic delegation organised by INTRACO in August. So things were developing smoothly until the hijacking incident which created differences between Singapore and Vietnam. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we have our respective views on the question of jurisdiction over the hijackers. We, that is, Singapore, still hold to our views and I presume the Vietnamese to theirs. The hijackers have been tried and sentenced. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of now, I think relations between Singapore and Vietnam are normal.

The work permits issued are for two years. The present procedure of applying for work permits is simple and is not troublesome for an employer as it only involves the employer at the initial stage of the application by having to complete one part of the application form. The application is processed promptly by the Work Permit Department and the employer, together with the applicant, will normally be informed of the outcome of the application within a week from the date of receipt of the application. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work permits for permanent residents are granted easily. The system gives the Government useful data on the work characteristics of non-citizen workers, including permanent residents.

Under the policy, applications for work permits from technicians and skilled workers are invariably approved. For those who have acceptable training qualifications or have been certified as skilled by the Industrial Training Board, they will be issued with a 3-year work permit. These 3-year work permit holders will be eligible for permanent residence if they have completed at least two years of employment in Singapore.

The resulting system instability caused another 120 megawatt generator, also at the Jurong Power Station, to trip out.

Observations indicate that oil spillage over a period softens and dissolves the asphalt in road pavements resulting in loss of its \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> binding quality. With heavy rainfall, water easily penetrates the asphalt film surrounding the stone aggregate, stripping them from the road pavement thus aggravating the damage. In tight bends, the pavement surfaces are highly stressed by turning vehicles and tend to deteriorate faster than straight road sections. In all instances, heavy vehicles and high traffic volumes tend to hasten the deterioration of road pavements. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Works Department exercises rigid quality control over the materials used for road surfacing and also undertakes strict supervision of the laying of the premixed asphalt concrete. Samples of materials used at every site are taken and sent to the PWD's engineering laboratory for testing. Sub-standard materials are rejected. Financial penalties are imposed for minor departures from the qualities specified. During road resurfacing works, PWD officers maintain standing supervision to ensure that compaction is adequate and the hot mix asphalt concrete has cooled down sufficiently before the road is opened to traffic. Premature opening to traffic will result in some loosening of the surface materials and subsequent deterioration of the road surface. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the period April to October 1977, the average monthly expenditure on road patching was approximately $85,000. For November 1977, this rose to $113,000 and could be attributed to the heavy rainfall at that time. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1976, the PWD reviewed the existing asphalt concrete mix design used and experimented with various mix designs with the aim of improving on the asphalt concrete mix that will be used for future road surfacing. Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, an improved mix has been in use. A stiffer grade of bitumen has also been specified. The PWD is in correspondence with various research and highway authorities in other countries, obtaining useful information on how the problem can be solved. The Department has, in addition, initiated systematic scientific studies to determine precisely the factors affecting road surface deterioration. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>KAMPONG SILAT</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Development of slum areas)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr P.

When a shopkeeper tenders for a particular shop premises, he has to make it known in that tender the particular trade he deals in. In a particular block of shops therefore, there are tenders for various trades. The tenderer must indicate what he wants to tender a particular shop for, such as a clinic. Therefore, he tenders a certain price for it. Compared to the tender for another shop, for example, a coffee shop, perhaps the tender price could be different. Therefore, in this case, the tenderer must indicate at the time of tendering that he wants to sell intoxicating liquor, but not as an afterthought. Because if it is an afterthought, it could jeopardise the business of other shops in the same block. So the mistake here is not with the authority but with the tenderer.

Unfortunately, Sir, this has not been done by most of the farmers, probably to reduce the cost of their operations.

Barker (Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology (Mr E.W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill contains a few amendments to the Parliamentary Elections Act, which have been found to be necessary. The first amendment (clause 4) empowers the Registration Officer to remove from any register the names of electors whose addresses as shown in the register have ceased to exist or to be used as a place of residence, and to transfer such names to the appropriate registers, provided that the changes of addresses have been notified to the Commissioner of National Registration. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present such removal and/or transfer of names can only be done if there is a general revision of the registers of electors; the amendment will enable this to be done \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> without having to wait for such a general revision. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of urban renewal and redevelopment, many electors have vacated their residences and resettled elsewhere. It is considered that these electors should not be entitled to vote in the constituency in which they have clearly ceased to reside. They should vote in the constituency in which they are currently residing. Provision is made for the Registration Officer to give appropriate notice in the Gazette and to make available for public inspection a list of the names of the persons so affected, at least two weeks before making any removal or transfer of names. If at the time a person's name is removed from a register of electors he has not yet notified the Commissioner of National Registration of his change of address, he can still subsequently apply to have his name entered in the appropriate register so that he will not be prejudiced by the removal of his name. However, on practical considerations, where a writ of election has been issued for an election in an electoral division, no entry will be made in the register of electors of that division until after nomination day or, if a poll is to be taken, until after polling day. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment (clause 6) is designed to enable persons who have failed to vote at any election and whose names have been expunged from the registers of electors to have their names restored without having to wait until the next ensuing revision of the registers. The present provision is unsatisfactory in that it requires such persons to wait until the ensuing revision of the registers before their names can be restored, even though they may have furnished the Registration Officer with a good excuse or have paid the penalty of $5.00 for the restoration of their names. This amendment provides that such persons will have their names restored the day after the payment of the penalty of $5.00 or the day after the Registration Officer has satisfied himself of any good excuse which has been furnished. Again for practical considerations, it is provided that where a writ of election has been issued for an election in an electoral division, no name is to be restored to the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> register of that division until after nomination day or, if a poll is to be taken, until after polling day. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third amendment (clause 7) seeks to prohibit, inter alia, non-citizens and undischarged bankrupts from taking part in any election activity. It is not in the public interest that such persons should play an active part in election campaigns. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before concluding, I would like to inform hon. Members that it has been decided to increase the deposit required to be made by a candidate for election under section 28 of the Act from the present sum of $1,200 to $1,500. The Act (section 28(6)) provides that the Minister may vary the amount of the deposit provided that it does not exceed 10% of the total allowances paid to a Member of Parliament in each year. With the consolidation of the NWC awards into basic salaries, the monthly allowance of an MP is now $1,340. The yearly allowance is therefore $16,080 (not including the 13th month's allowance). Ton per cent of the yearly allowance is $1,608, a sum larger than the proposed deposit of $1,500. The increase will be implemented in due course by a notification in the Gazette in accordance with subsection (6). \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr E.W.

It is now proposed to allow the Returning Officer to accept deposits made other than in legal tender. The proposed amendment will enable such candidates to make their deposits by a bank draft order or a certified cheque apart from cash. \"Certified cheque\" is defined under this new clause to mean a cheque which is certified by the drawee bank as good for payment of the sum stated in the cheque. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause read a Second time and added to the Bill. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Chairman:</b> It is intended that this new clause be inserted immediately after clause 5.

Barker (Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology (Mr E.W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will recall that my colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs and Education, at the Second Reading of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill, informed the House how serious the problem of drug abuse and addiction had become. As compared with the few cases of heroin addiction in 1971, we now have as many as 12,000 heroin addicts and abusers. The Act, which was enacted to deal with this pernicious problem, provides for the necessary powers of arrest and detention of these drug addicts and abusers for treatment and rehabilitation in approved institutions, subject to certain safeguards. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A constitutional problem, however, arises in regard to the Act, vis-a-vis Article 5 of the Constitution of Malaysia in its application to Singapore. Article 5 lays down the constitutional requirement that a person, who is arrested and detained, should be informed of the grounds of his arrest, should be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner, and should be produced before a Magistrate within 24 hours of his arrest. Whilst the importance of this fundamental right is recognised, it, like any other fundamental right, cannot be absolute and may have to be qualified in the interest of public order, safety or security. A departure from the normal constitutional requirements is necessary to deal effectively with the grave drug problem. The Bill before this House ensures the constitutional validity of the Misuse of Drugs Act, in so far as that Act authorises the detention of drug addicts and abusers in approved institutions for treatment and rehabilitation. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, which authorises the arrest and detention of any person in the interest of public safety, peace and good order, was enacted in the year 1955. When Singapore \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> became a state within the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, the fundamental liberties clauses (including Article 5) of the Malaysian Constitution became applicable to us. These clauses were retained in our Constitution when we separated from Malaysia in August 1965. It may be arguable that Part V of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act infringes Article 5 of the Constitution. The Bill before this House will ensure the constitutional validity of Part V. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the circumstances, which I have related, it is necessary to make this Bill both prospective and retrospective. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>3.58 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the constitutional provision that no person shall be deprived of his personal liberty except in accordance with the due process of law as laid down in Article 5 of our Constitution is a provision that is basic to the system of government and way of life that we have adopted. But, as with other liberties, it must be conceded that it is not absolute. It is an ideal that we should not however deviate from without most careful deliberation. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would all agree that there are some problems in our society that cannot be dealt with in strict accordance with the principle that no person should be detained without an open trial. In fact, to insist on strict adherence to the principle in such cases will only serve to undermine and destroy the very fabric of our society. One such case is that relating to secret societies and their activities. The ruthlessness of those engaged in such activities and the nature of these organisations ensure that nobody will testify publicly in such cases. To insist that the process laid down in Article 5 of the Constitution be followed will only serve to protect such criminal activities and make a mockery of the process of law and justice. As long as we have secret societies, it is necessary to have the provisions of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act in operation and it is proper that the Constitution be amended as proposed in the \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> new clause 6(a) to make the validity of such laws beyond doubt. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6(b), however, deals with quite another matter and the reason as far as I can make out for this amendment is very different. The motive appears to me to be one of administrative expedience. In the case of misuse of drugs it has not been claimed, as far as I can remember, that it is difficult to obtain evidence. There are established medical tests which can provide the evidence. But the drug problem has grown at such an alarming rate that I understand the administrative machinery in terms of courts, magistrates and prosecuting officers cannot cope with the number of arrests being made. Since the problem is acute and cannot wait for the administrative resources to be strengthened before the problem is tackled, an interim solution is necessary. Thus, reluctantly we have to deviate from the fundamental liberty principle laid down in the Constitution. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assume, though I cannot be certain, that other solutions were explored before it was concluded that arrest and detention without trial is the only feasible immediate method of dealing with the problem. This method of dealing with the problem must however be conceded to be a temporary one. It will be difficult to maintain that given some time, the administrative machinery cannot be strengthened to deal with arrested drug abusers in the normal way. Would the Minister, therefore, be prepared to consider an amendment to provide that any law relating to the misuse of drugs which authorises the arrest and detention of a person without trial for the purpose of treatment and rehabilitation will have a definite life of, say, three years? Such an amendment would ensure that steps are taken within the period to enable the problem to be dealt with under the process laid down in the present Article 5 of the Constitution. It may even turn out, happily, that the number of drug addicts may be so reduced at the end of the period that they can be easily dealt with by the courts. In any case, at the end of the life of the Act, if circumstances require an extension, a Bill can be presented to Parlia- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> ment to extend the Act and, at such an occasion, Parliament will have the benefit of considering the details of action taken and progress achieved to find a permanent solution and the reasons for the extension. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, if an amendment is not possible, I shall be grateful if the Minister will give an assurance that this particular aspect of the law to deal with drug misuse will be reviewed periodically and that action will be taken as soon as possible to revert to the system of dealing with drug abusers through the courts. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fear that if there be no limitation to the period of operation of such laws or if there be no undertaking to review such laws, there will be no incentive to strengthen the administrative machinery to deal with the problem. I fear further that if it is not made clear that short cuts to legal processes are only to be used as a last resort and that too with severe limitations, there will be great temptation to use short cuts where process of law or fair play or justice is expensive in terms of time, manpower and other resources. The administration, once it has found a cheap and easy way of doing things, seldom abandons it. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I remember when taking our seats as Members of Parliament, among other undertakings, we swore to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. It is therefore disturbing to note that the House is being asked to approve an amendment to the Constitution because of an apparently ultra vires act on the part of the Hon. Minister for Home Affairs and Education when he last moved the amendment to the Misuse of Drugs Act in this House on the 9th November, 1977. What we are now asked to do may be likened to closing the stable gate after the horse has bolted. A rather more serious implication, Sir, to my mind, is that, as law makers, we would appear to have shown no respect for the law and in this particular case, the most sacred of all, our Constitution. Whatever the justification, the action on the part of the Hon. Minister is inexcusable. I do hope that \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> this is the first and last time that such a thoughtless act is allowed to be committed. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Hon. Minister for Law, I would like his assurance that all future Bills, prior to submitting to Parliament, will be thoroughly vetted to ensure that they are not inconsistent with or in contravention of any existing provisions under either the Constitution or any other statutes. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr E.W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr E.W. Barker:</b> Sir, the Member for Kallang has made many good points in his speech, but the better part of his speech should have been made last year when he spoke on the Second Reading of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill. But let me assure both hon. Members that other solutions were carefully explored before it was concluded that arrest and detention without trial was the only practical method of dealing with the drug problem. My colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs, has explained in detail the reasons for the act. Sir, the spread of drug abuse was somewhat like the spread of an infectious disease like cholera, of which I am in charge, and had to be dealt with expediently and drastically. We could not wait. To take thousands of drug abusers to court would have meant delays. If the accused claimed trial and was granted bail, as is the usual practice, he would continue to take drugs and make himself even more addictive, Sir, it is not just a question of not enough courts or magistrates or administrators. We can set up special courts purely to deal with the drug abusers, as we have with the two traffic courts dealing with traffic offenders. But that is not the solution. Hence it was felt that drug abusers should be detained for rehabilitation without trial even before the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill became law. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kallang has asked me to consider an amendment to provide that any law which authorises the arrest and detention of drug addicts without trial should have a definite life of, say, three years. I hope he is not suggesting that the present amendment to the Constitution which I am moving should be a temporary one, because it is not usual for amendments to the Constitution \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> to be made of a temporary nature. Sir, the Constitution (Amendment) Act, which is the enabling Act, the principal Act, leads to the other two Acts. The Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act lasts for five years. At the end of that five years, it has to be renewed. The Member for Kallang has a point when he said that the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill should have been made of a temporary nature, perhaps for three years or five years when we should come back here to discuss and debate it in Parliament. But again, if he has that suggestion, I am afraid he is a little out of time. The suggestion should have been made when the Bill was debated in the House last year. Unfortunately, the Member, not having the advantage of a study of the law, did not know that the Act was ultra vires the Constitution. But, as I said before, the Minister in charge had to deal with a rather drastic situation. When you have thousands of drug addicts on your hands, you cannot sometimes wait even for a parliamentary sitting. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for future assurances, like the Member for Jalan Kayu, I myself swore to defend and uphold the Constitution. But sometimes amendments to the Constitution have to be made; in fact, there have been very few in the last 12 years since we gained independence and adopted some of the provisions of the Constitution of Malaysia. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Sir, may I clarify the point made by the Member for Jalan Kayu? But before doing so, I would like to thank my colleague, the Minister for Law, for his reply to the queries raised. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point of clarification, let me put it this way. The implication of the statement made by the Member for Jalan Kayu is that this constitutional amendment was an after-thought after the Misuse of Drugs Act was introduced and passed in this Parliament. May I assure the Member that this was not the case. It was not an after-thought. We knew that this Bill which was introduced earlier would require an amendment to the Constitution of Singapore. If hon. Members will remember, before the Second Reading of \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> the Misuse of Drugs Act, this Constitution (Amendment) Bill was introduced for First Reading in this Parliament. So it was not an after-thought. It was not a case, as was vividly put by the Member for Jalan Kayu, of closing the stable gate after the horse had fled. In fact, the horse is still in the stable when we try to close it. It is not a case of the horse having bolted. It is still in the stable. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point of clarification is that this is not a straightforward case of detention without trial of secret society gangsters. This is a case where a drug addict is being detained not for purposes of imprisonment but for purposes of treatment and rehabilitation. As my colleague, the Minister for Law, has aptly illustrated his point, we are not only fighting an epidemic, an epidemic which is called the \"heroin\" epidemic where the addicts not only require treatment and rehabilitation as quickly as possible, but we also have to prevent them from infecting other people, just like small pox or cholera cases. So we owe a duty not only to the drug addict, of treating and rehabilitating him, but also to the community of preventing the drug addict from infecting other unsuspecting youths. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr E.W.

It should be pointed out that these figures are payments of workmen's compensation actually made. They do not reflect all the cases for that year.

The Honourable Member will recall that on 1 Oct 75 the new Workmen's Compensation Act came into operation which raised the maximum quantum from $21,600 to $35,000 for fatal cases and from $28,800 to $45,000 for total permanent incapacity cases.

In the last two promotion exercises, only about 1,200 officers, or about 7% of those eligible, were shortlisted for a single round of interviews by the Public Service Commission. Many of the 93% of those not shortlisted voiced their disappointment at not being called. This time, after months of discussion and consultation with the Public Service Commission and planning by the Ministry, a total of about 7,000 were originally shortlisted based on their records. The names of these 7,000 were then provided to their Principals who were asked to comment on the list and to suggest further names for inclusion if they felt any deserving officer had been left out. This resulted in another 2,000 or so names being added to the shortlist. Although the number shortlisted was large, totalling more than -9,000, the Public Service Commission and the Ministry felt it would be well worth the time and effort to interview them. Firstly, it would give as many as possible the opportunity to appear for interview and be considered for promotion. Secondly, they would be given the chance to express their views on the education system, the teaching service and their own personal problems, preferences and career expectations to the interview boards comprising Public Service Commission members and senior Ministry officials and Principals. Thirdly, and very importantly, it would allow as many as possible to be identified for future career development leading to appointments as Principals, Vice-Principals, Senior Assistants and in specialist capacities. All these objectives were, to a large extent, achieved in this last promotion exercise which was the most thorough and comprehensive of all the promotion exercises held so far in the Education Service. No doubt, the numbers promoted were far less than those not promoted. This is so in any promotion exercise. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The considerable time and effort put into this exercise were not counter-productive. Nevertheless, a thorough post mortem on this exercise is now being conducted and the lessons learned from this will be used to make further improvements, in consultation with the Public Service Commission and others, to the next promotion exercise for which initial planning has already begun. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>NEIGHBOURHOODS TWO AND THREE, BEDOK NEW TOWN</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Schools)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Haji Sha'ari bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. \n  <b>Haji Sha'ari bin Tadin</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Education whether there are plans to build schools in Neighbourhoods Two and Three and, if so, where the schools will be built and when they are expected to be completed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> The current School Building Programme is geared to meet the demands of school places in new towns.

The procedure requires that they complete a form giving information only of the name and address of the business, the Certificate of Registration number and the date of termination of business. However, normally a business is terminated because it has failed. The larger number of terminations of business operations in 1975, however, may be an effect of the Business Registration Act, 1973, brought into force on 1st September, 1974 which requires all businesses to have their registrations renewed annually. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of companies that terminate operations, by and large, those that are wound-up by the Court and those that are struck-off under Section 308 of the Companies Act (viz. because they have ceased to carry on business for a period of time) are normally insolvent. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of companies voluntarily wound-up are solvent. Companies ceasing business in Singapore apply to foreign companies which for various reasons decide to cease operation as a branch in Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>TOURISTS, 1975-77</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. \n  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Finance (a) how many tourists visited Singapore in 1977, according to country of origin; (b) what was the average number of days spent by them in Singapore; and (c) what were the comparative figures for 1976 and 1975. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Tourism is an important growth industry. During the recession in 1975, tourist arrivals did not decline but grew at 7.5%. The pace increased to 12.9% and 14.1% in 1976 and 1977, respectively. In 1977, tourist arrivals by air and sea reached 1.51 million. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All tourist generating markets in 1977 registered increases except for slight decline for USA and Australia. This was probably due to slower economic growth in the US, the devaluation of the Australian dollar and the special Apex fare introduced between Australia and UK which discourages stopovers between the two countries through the imposition of a stopover surcharge. The slight decline in tourist arrivals from Australia and USA has, however, not affected their relative ranking among tourist generating markets. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last three years, visitors from Indonesia constituted the largest proportion of total visitor arrivals followed by Australia and Japan. In 1977, Japan registered the highest annual growth rate of 35.4%. Other major tourist generating markets in order of ranking are Malaysia, USA and UK. Table I below gives a detailed breakdown of tourist arrivals and growth rates for 1975 to 1977. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1975 and 1976, the overall actual length of stay of all visitors remained at 3.4 days. Tourists from Southeast Asia (for example Indonesia, Hong Kong and Malaysia) generally stayed longer than those from Europe, USA and Australia. Data collection for the 1977 survey has just been completed and the data are being processed.
