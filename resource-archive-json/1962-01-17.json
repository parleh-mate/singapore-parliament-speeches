These two subjects were\r\n\r\nleft out of the Schedule published in Command Paper\r\n\r\n33 of 1961 as there was then still discussion as to\r\n\r\nthe  ultimate division of responsibility  in  these\r\n\r\ntwo subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If and when alteration is contemplated, there\r\n\r\nwill be prior consultation and prior agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, at the meeting of the Malaysia\r\n\r\nSolidarity  Consultative Committee in Kuala  Lumpur\r\n\r\n10  days  ago, the Minister for Health  and  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  of the Federation of Malaya, as leader  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  delegation,  agreed  in  reply  to\r\n\r\nquestions submitted by delegates from North  Borneo\r\n\r\nand  Sarawak  that constitutional  safeguards  were\r\n\r\ndesirable  and  that an individual State  which  is\r\n\r\ngiven  autonomy in respect of a particular  subject\r\n\r\nnot conceded as a State subject in the other States\r\n\r\nin  the  present Federation can have constitutional\r\n\r\nsafeguards  to  be  worked  out  by  constitutional\r\n\r\nexperts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have put in copies of the\r\n\r\nexchange of letters for the information of Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the letters handed in to the Clerk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That statement, of course, is open\r\n\r\nto  question, if any.

I was  saying.\r\n\r\nSir,   that  even  the  reactionary  Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  the  decency to  consult  all  the\r\n\r\nParties  and  had agreement with them in  principle\r\n\r\nbefore  proceeding to negotiate  with  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment in 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> So\r\n\r\nyou prefer the Lim Yew Heck Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But now, the Lee Kuan Yew\r\n\r\nGovernment must make it a one-Party affair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The Workers'\r\n\r\nParty  and the United People's Party both supported\r\n\r\nour   stand.   The  Workers'  Party  implored   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to   call  the  House   into   session\r\n\r\nforthwith.

In  this  case\r\n\r\nthere  was never consultation of the views  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition Parties at any stage of the negotiations\r\n\r\nto  date.  So  it is nonsense for the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister to presume there was no unanimity  on  the\r\n\r\nmain  points.  Whether we agree or not  is  another\r\n\r\nmatter.

But this is the  point:  of\r\n\r\nofficial news from the Government to the Opposition\r\n\r\nParties,  there  was nothing. Even the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park complained in the radio forum of  21st\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1961, when the question of an  All-Party\r\n\r\nConference was discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> One forum you will not forget\r\n\r\nfor a long, long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister for Finance was\r\n\r\ntold  in no uncertain terms that the P.A.P. should\r\n\r\nnot treat everybody as fools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) On 12th October, 1961, the Member for Tanglin\r\n\r\nafter  much serious thinking also came out  with  a\r\n\r\ncall  for  an  All-Party  Conference  of  political\r\n\r\nParties in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) Following this, on 6th October, 1961, three\r\n\r\nOpposition  leaders  the Member  for  Hong  Lim  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the United People's Party, the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson on behalf of the Workers' Party -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> A one-man Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and myself on behalf of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  jointly sent  a  letter  to  the\r\n\r\nLeader  of  the  House  urging  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nconvene  a  meeting  of the Assembly  forthwith  to\r\n\r\nconsider  and  debate the basic principles  and  to\r\n\r\nappoint an All-Party Conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> For what reason?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But what did the D.P.M. say?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> But what did the who say?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

We do not seek  the\r\n\r\nright  solely  to decide Singapore's constitutional\r\n\r\nfuture.  All  we ask is the right of participation.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding  this,  the  P.A.P. has  seen  fit\r\n\r\nsolely  to  decide on the constitutional future  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. It is now quite clear to the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  that the P.A.P. has committed the  whole\r\n\r\nfuture of Singapore over the question of its phoney\r\n\r\nmerger  because the P.A.P. is an active sponsor  of\r\n\r\nthe Malaysia scheme. Malaysia is the only political\r\n\r\nobjective of the Tunku. He has made it quite  clear\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  going  to  be  no  acceptance   of\r\n\r\nSingapore if there is no Malaysia - a very consistent\r\n\r\nstand  of  the Tunku. Singapore therefore  is  only\r\n\r\nwanted for the sole purpose of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as political events unfold themselves, the\r\n\r\npeople   of  Singapore  are  becoming  increasingly\r\n\r\nconfused and confounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Today the people find\r\n\r\nthemselves in an extremely extraordinary situation.\r\n\r\nThey  feel that their future is being decided  step\r\n\r\nby  step  by the Tunku, the Prime Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  First, when he made a  lengthy  speech\r\n\r\nduring   the   October  session  of   the   Federal\r\n\r\nParliament last year. Then again when he  addressed\r\n\r\nthe U.M.N.O. delegates at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur\r\n\r\non  4th  November. And again when he flew to London\r\n\r\nin   mid-November  1961  for  exploratory  Malaysia\r\n\r\ntalks. I mention this, Sir, because there is a very\r\n\r\nwidespread impression that the British position  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   will  be  replaced  by  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  that  that  is  going  to  be  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional future of Singapore whether we  like\r\n\r\nit or not.

This impression\r\n\r\nregarding the transfer of power has spread  as  far\r\n\r\nas   all  the  Borneo  territories.  It  would   be\r\n\r\nreasonable  to  expect that if  our  constitutional\r\n\r\nfuture  is  going to be tied up with  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nscheme  and not just a question of merger with  the\r\n\r\nFederation in isolation, there would have  been  at\r\n\r\nleast  an  All-Party  Conference  to  discuss   the\r\n\r\nvarious implications of this scheme from the  point\r\n\r\nof  view  of  Singapore  in  accordance  with  past\r\n\r\npractice in 1956 and 1958. But no. All we know  was\r\n\r\na   statement  of  support  for  Malaysia  by   the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General  of  the  P.A.P.  And  then,   of\r\n\r\ncourse, we learned of the formation of the Malaysia\r\n\r\nSolidarity  Consultative  Committee  at  its  first\r\n\r\nmeeting  in  Jesselton on 24th August, 1961,  which\r\n\r\nwas  supposed to have been a meeting held at C.P.A.\r\n\r\nlevel. You will remember, Sir, that I wrote to  ask\r\n\r\nif  you,  as  the  President of  the  C.P.A.,  knew\r\n\r\nanything  about  it  and  your  answer  that   your\r\n\r\nknowledge of the matter was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  gathered  from  the  newspapers  is  sufficient\r\n\r\ntestimony  of  the dictatorial rule of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment. One would have thought that the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwould  have had the good sense to hold an All-Party\r\n\r\nConference  to  decide on the stand that  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould adopt at this Conference and to agree upon a\r\n\r\ntruly  representative delegation so that  the  true\r\n\r\nvoice  of  Singapore could be heard. But again  no.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. did not hold an All-Party  Conference,\r\n\r\nnor   was   Singapore  represented   by   a   truly representative  delegation at this  forum.

The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. which professes to\r\n\r\nbelieve in democracy has unfortunately set a very\r\n\r\nbad example by the way it\r\n\r\nhas carried through the so-called merger\r\n\r\nnegotiations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not intend to repeat what\r\n\r\nmy Party Chairman, the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown, has said, but I wish to\r\n\r\nemphasise that for the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nto treat a national issue as a private party affair\r\n\r\nis, to say the least, extremely regrettable. Our people have seen the successful\r\n\r\nfunctions   of   All-Party\r\n\r\ndelegations in the past in advancing the\r\n\r\nconstitutional status of Singapore. What\r\n\r\nwe have been seeking so far is that the Parties\r\n\r\nshould first get together to decide\r\n\r\non certain basic principles and then to proceed as\r\n\r\na united body to negotiate\r\n\r\nfor our constitutional advancement. The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nunfortunately has done things in\r\n\r\nexactly the opposite manner. Firstly, it wants to\r\n\r\nnegotiate secretly with the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government  and,  after reaching\r\n\r\nagreement   on   so-called\r\n\r\nprinciples, then make a pretence of consulting with\r\n\r\nthe other Parties. What\r\n\r\nsort of consultation is this when we are told of\r\n\r\narrangements after they have\r\n\r\nalready been agreed upon by the Governments of the\r\n\r\ntwo territories?\r\n\r\nThe P.A.P. is now treating the merger question as a\r\n\r\nway out to salvage its own\r\n\r\npolitical future. It has a vast interest, so to\r\n\r\nspeak, to see that some kind of\r\n\r\npolitical link-up be brought about as soon as\r\n\r\npossible before the deadline of\r\n\r\n1964 when it has to face the people again. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is now hoping, as has\r\n\r\nbeen pointed out before, that such arrangements\r\n\r\nwill allow the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment to purge its political opponents before\r\n\r\nthe next general\r\n\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps it is useless to appeal to the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to refrain from going on in\r\n\r\nthis secretive manner in dealing with a national\r\n\r\nproblem. We know that with\r\n\r\nthe meagre one-man majority in this House, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. can do anything it\r\n\r\nwants. But that does not mean that it is morally\r\n\r\njustified in conducting the\r\n\r\naffairs of our people in this manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe P.A.P. leaders have repeatedly declared before\r\n\r\n'that they would not\r\n\r\ngovern without the moral support of the people. Can\r\n\r\nthey say that they now have\r\n\r\nthe moral support of the people? An All-Party\r\n\r\nconference would have given\r\n\r\nfull expression to the various opinions on the\r\n\r\nquestion of merger. If the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders believe that by pushing through this merger\r\n\r\nscheme they can save their\r\n\r\nown political future, then they are going to be\r\n\r\nsadly mistaken. The real way to\r\n\r\nstay in power is to go with the people and heed\r\n\r\ntheir views and aspirations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is utterly nonsensical for the P.A.P. to\r\n\r\nsuggest that the people will\r\n\r\nbe confused during a general election. The Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has said that there\r\n\r\nwill be dozens of political Parties with hundreds\r\n\r\nof candidates at a general\r\n\r\nelection and the people will all be confused. But,\r\n\r\nSir, during the last general\r\n\r\nelection, there were 11 political Parties and about\r\n\r\n200 candidates contesting for\r\n\r\nthe people's votes. Were our people confused? Were\r\n\r\nthey confused by the\r\n\r\nvarious parties and dubious characters springing up\r\n\r\non the eve of the general\r\n\r\nelectioo? No. Sir,Instead of being confused, they\r\n\r\nmade a clear-cut decision.\r\n\r\nThe P.A.P. was returned with an overwhelming\r\n\r\nmajority. And we who have\r\n\r\nbeen in the P.A.P. know that the people voted the\r\n\r\nParty to power because\r\n\r\nof its uncompromising stand against colonialism.\r\n\r\nThe people were then utterly fed up with the previous Government which had\r\n\r\nconspired with the colonial\r\n\r\nand reactionary elements to bring widespread\r\n\r\nrepression and suffering to the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. The people in 1959, Sir,\r\n\r\nlooked towards the P.A.P. in the\r\n\r\nhope and expectation that they would get rid of,\r\n\r\nonce and for all, the oppression and repression they had suffered at the hands\r\n\r\nof the Lim Yew Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment. But now they see that this P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment, on whom they have\r\n\r\nplaced the trust, are trying its level best to\r\n\r\njuggle with and manipulate the constitutional future of our people in such a manner\r\n\r\nthat will result in a return of\r\n\r\nthe dark days of the Lim Yew Hock Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let the P.A.P. leaders not think that they\r\n\r\ncan escape responsibility for\r\n\r\nthe oppression and suffering of the workers of\r\n\r\nSingapore that will follow\r\n\r\nthe merger scheme. Let them not think that just\r\n\r\nbecause it will be the Federation Government that will be doing the dirty work,\r\n\r\nthey will escape responsibility. Those who conspire with and make it\r\n\r\npossible for others to carry out\r\n\r\nrepression of our people will themselves be equally\r\n\r\nresponsible for these acts of\r\n\r\nrepressions. The people are not fools who cannot\r\n\r\nsee through this intricate\r\n\r\nconspiracy between the P.A.P. and the the\r\n\r\nreactionary elements in the Federation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is ridiculous for the P.A.P. to say that\r\n\r\njust because it has merger as\r\n\r\none of its many election platforms, it therefore\r\n\r\nhas the people's mandate to\r\n\r\nbring abo'ut any sort of political link-up with the\r\n\r\nFederation. For that matter\r\n\r\n,merger was on the platform of practically every\r\n\r\npolitical Party at that time. The\r\n\r\npeople want to be merged with the Federation but\r\n\r\nwith equality, mutual\r\n\r\nrespect, and mutual benefit, not this present\r\n\r\ncompletely one-sided arrangement. The people want to be married with the\r\n\r\nFederation, and not to be\r\n\r\ntaken in as a mistress.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The difference is\r\n\r\nthis, Sir. On the specific\r\n\r\nissue of constitutional change, it arose as a\r\n\r\nresult of a motion passed in this\r\n\r\nHouse which was not part of an election programme,\r\n\r\nand, therefore, it was\r\n\r\nfelt that because of that, an All-Party Committee\r\n\r\nshould be formed to change\r\n\r\nthe Constitution sooner than it was intended. But\r\n\r\nin this case, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment was elected on the merger platform. It\r\n\r\nwas known to everybody.\r\n\r\nJust to refresh the memory of the 13 ex-P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMembers who were elected on\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. ticket - they forgot they were elected on\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. ticket, on the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. platform - they signed a pledge which\r\n\r\nincluded reference to the Fourth\r\n\r\nAnniversary   Celebration   Souvenir Number, in\r\n\r\nwhich this was said, in a\r\n\r\nlong article. I will just read the extract:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The creation of an independent, democratic, non-Communist, socialist Malaya, Federation plus Singapore,'\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br>Then we went on to say:\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To achieve freedom in an island, we must\r\n\r\nachieve merger.'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>Then we went on to say later on:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We must face up to the fact that the Alliance\r\n\r\nleaders who represent the bulk of the\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malay people',\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>and so on.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We must allay these fears and create the\r\n\r\nconditions for merger.'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>This testament was subscribed to and signed by\r\n\r\nevery P.A.P. candidate who\r\n\r\nstood for election. It is quite clear, Sir, that\r\n\r\nwe are carrying out a specific mandate which the people know, and, therefore, there\r\n\r\nis no need for us to have an\r\n\r\nAll-Party Committee to carry out an election\r\n\r\nprogramme.

What has happened that has\r\n\r\nreally annoyed them, Sir,\r\n\r\nis that merger has come sooner than they expected\r\n\r\nor sooner than their\r\n\r\nfriends expected - the friends who are not here.\r\n\r\nThey are terrified of merger.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that they are temfied of merger,\r\n\r\nas we will see very soon. One\r\n\r\nreason why they cannot stop merger -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> rder. Here again, I\r\n\r\nthink the Minister is going back on the merger\r\n\r\ndebate.

The real reason why Members of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis are insisting on\r\n\r\nAll-Party Committee discussions and soon is simply\r\n\r\nthis. They want to delay\r\n\r\nmerger, and the only way they can do so is by\r\n\r\nhaving an All-Party Committee. As\r\n\r\nyou know, we discussed merger for nearly a\r\n\r\nfortnight, and it was quite clear that\r\n\r\na Committee of that kind would never reach\r\n\r\nagreement on merger. That was\r\n\r\nthe basis of the demand for an All-Party\r\n\r\nCommittee. It is to delay merger. \"Let\r\n\r\nus have discussions.\" Then there will be talk\r\n\r\nabout six months, two years or\r\n\r\nthree years, because there will be no agreement on\r\n\r\nthe kind of merger we\r\n\r\ncould have or we should have. Therefore, merger\r\n\r\ncould be postponed indefi-nitely. In any case, what is the point of still\r\n\r\nasking for an All-Party Committee?\r\n\r\nWe had an All-Party Committee discussing this in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly. As far as I\r\n\r\nknow, Sir, the merger proposals were passed in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly without dissent.\r\n\r\nThe reason, is that the 13 Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nMembers, on the pretext that some of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir Members were afraid to go home late at night,\r\n\r\nor because they had no\r\n\r\ncars, left this Chamber -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Having\r\n\r\nbeen accepted by the\r\n\r\nAssembly, it is a fait accompli, as far as the\r\n\r\nAssembly is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The point I wanted to make was\r\n\r\nthat they said that an All-Party Committee should be called to discuss the\r\n\r\nmerger proposals. For two\r\n\r\nweeks this Assembly was converted into an All-Party\r\n\r\nCommittee to discuss the\r\n\r\nquestion of merger. They could have taken a stand\r\n\r\nand said, \"No, we vote\r\n\r\nagainst it.\" But as far as we know, when it came to\r\n\r\nthe test to say whether they\r\n\r\nwere for or against the merger proposals,they were\r\n\r\nnot here. That was the point\r\n\r\n1 vvanted to make. So what is the point of calling\r\n\r\nanother All-Party Committee\r\n\r\nwhen obviously the Barisan Sosialis are not\r\n\r\nprepared to make a stand? All they\r\n\r\nwant is to prolong things and reopen the question\r\n\r\nnow. As the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown has said - his solution now is this - let us\r\n\r\nreopen the whole question,\r\n\r\nconduct merger negotiations on a new basis, and if\r\n\r\nit fails - and definitely\r\n\r\nit will fail because we know what their stand is - then they say, let us have fresh\r\n\r\nelections. That is the proposal now being put\r\n\r\nforward. But as far as we are concerned, Sir, the merger proposals have been\r\n\r\napproved by the Assembly and the\r\n\r\ncourse of events will proceed whatever stand the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialls might take,\r\n\r\nor if they stand in the way, then that is their\r\n\r\nunhappy misfortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the points made by the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown was that, again as\r\n\r\nevidence of the dictatorial attitude of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment - dictatorial in this\r\n\r\nsense - it is carrying out its election pledge\r\n\r\nwithout reference to the Opposition. Another instance, he pointed out, was that\r\n\r\neven in the case of Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthere was no consultation because nobody supported\r\n\r\nit. When the Tunku\r\n\r\nannounced the merger proposals, only the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nsupported it. The leader of\r\n\r\nthe Socialist Front, Mr Boestaman,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupported it.

After the Tunku had announced the Malaysia\r\n\r\nproposals, Mr Boestaman\r\n\r\nthought it was a very good thing and he came to see\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. and said, \"What\r\n\r\nabout having a socialist conference on the matter?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the C.P.A. conference - one Member\r\n\r\nof the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\n(he was not a member of the Barisan Sosialis then; he was just an ex-P.A.P. member at that time) was in the C.P.A. conference - we all discussed Malaysia.\r\n\r\nArising out of the conference, two Members of the\r\n\r\nBorneo delegation proposed\r\n\r\nthe formation of a Malaysia Solidarity Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittee. As the Government, we issued a statement saying that we\r\n\r\nsupported the formation of a\r\n\r\nMalaysia Solidarity Consultative Committee. For the\r\n\r\nfirst meeting, in Jesselton, the Government sent representatives. As a\r\n\r\ncourtesy, we asked the Opposition whether they would like to send somebody.\r\n\r\nAt that time there was no\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis. There were 13 ex-P.A.P.\r\n\r\ngentlemen. We consulted the Op-position and they nominated the Member for Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai. Then there was\r\n\r\na complaint by the Member -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Correction, if I may, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am not aware of the Opposition\r\n\r\nhaving nominated the Member for Geylang Serai, Sir.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I was informed, in answer to my own\r\n\r\nquestion in this Assembly, that it was the\r\n\r\nGovernments choice and the Governments appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> As an act of courtesy, we\r\n\r\napproached the S.P.A.

Because at that time, the Member for Anson did not\r\n\r\nmake his stand on Malaysia. He did not even say yes or no, as far as I\r\n\r\ncould recollect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the whole purpose of the Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittee when it was announced\r\n\r\nwas that only those who supported Malaysia should\r\n\r\nbe members of that\r\n\r\nCommittee. That was made quite clear. There were\r\n\r\ncertain complaints. Then we\r\n\r\ndecided on a second conference in Kuching. We had\r\n\r\nrepresentation at the\r\n\r\nC.P.A. level where the C.P.A. would elect a number\r\n\r\nof people from the Government side and a certain number of people from\r\n\r\nthe Opposition side to the\r\n\r\nCommittee where it was stated quite plainly that\r\n\r\nonly those who believed in\r\n\r\nMalaysia should join the Committee. The Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis insisted and the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson was nominated for the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> By you.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No, Sir. It was not by me; it was\r\n\r\nby the C.P.A. In\r\n\r\nfact, the Barisan Sosialis insisted they must be\r\n\r\nrepresented, or, at least,\r\n\r\nthe Opposition must be represented, on  the\r\n\r\nunderstanding   that   they\r\n\r\nsupported Malaysia. Now, Sir -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. In fairness to the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Member who was appointed, I think that was not the understanding. I\r\n\r\nthink it must be made quite\r\n\r\nclear that the Executive Committee just appointed\r\n\r\nfive people.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the minutes of the first -\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The minutes are quite clear on the point.\r\n\r\nI understand that. But I think, in fairness, the Executive \r\n\r\nCommittee just appointed five people. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> As I say, in Kuching where the\r\n\r\nConsultative Committee had\r\n\r\nits first meeting, it was made quite clear that all\r\n\r\nthose who believed in Malaysia\r\n\r\nwere the only ones who should belong to the\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And he said he believed in\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> And it was made quite clear that\r\n\r\nhe himself said he believed in Malaysia. So, therefore, to say that in\r\n\r\nthe case of Malaysia we were\r\n\r\nacting dictatorially is completely false.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the points repeatedly made is that somehow\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis represent the people - the people this, the people\r\n\r\nthat. They are only 13 Members. There are 26 here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> They were elected on the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. ticket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> And they were elected on the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. ticket. To that extent, they have gone under false pretences and they\r\n\r\nare still sitting there under false pretences. They keep on talking about the\r\n\r\npeople, the people. In fact, the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson, when he was at the Malaysia\r\n\r\nConference in Kuching,\r\n\r\ngot up and repudiated the delegation. He said he\r\n\r\nhad nothing to do with the\r\n\r\nGovernment  delegation  because - he said - \"I speak\r\n\r\nfor the people of Singapore. The other four who are there ... \".\r\n\r\nHe more or less implied 'that he was dissociating\r\n\r\nhimself from the rest, so much\r\n\r\nso that the Member for Geylang Serai had to get up\r\n\r\nand pointed out that the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson only represented 13 Assemblymen\r\n\r\nwho were formerly\r\n\r\nelected on the P.A.P. ticket. Nobody knows whether\r\n\r\nthe people still approve\r\n\r\nof the Barisan Sosialis. They have not been tested.\r\n\r\nSo to keep on talking that\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore want this or want that,\r\n\r\njust because the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis want this or want that, is not the same\r\n\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speaker has just now said that even though we\r\n\r\nhave been elected on the\r\n\r\nmerger platform, we should still consult the people\r\n\r\nbefore the merger proposals\r\n\r\nare put through. Do they mean consult the people - 13\r\n\r\nAssemblymen - or is it\r\n\r\nthe suggestion, as they have always put fonvard,\r\n\r\nthat if we cannot do that, well,\r\n\r\nlet us have elections?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. will decide what to do and when\r\n\r\nto consult the people in its\r\n\r\nown way. But what it will do is to carry through\r\n\r\nits election programme without\r\n\r\nany reference to whatever the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nmight say. In fact, the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, unlike us, when they are in difficulties,\r\n\r\ndo not consult the people.\r\n\r\nAs you know, Sir, they went to the U.K.\r\n\r\nCommission secretly to con&ult and clarify. At\r\n\r\nleast we never did that. We\r\n\r\nbrought our proposals to this Assembly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter having negotiated terms which we think are\r\n\r\nfair and just, and we put it to\r\n\r\nthe whole Assembly to decide whether they approved\r\n\r\nof them or not. There is\r\n\r\nnothing secret; there is nothing furtive. The\r\n\r\nMember for Havelock suggested\r\n\r\nthat our negotiations were secret and furtive and\r\n\r\nthat there were secret manoeuvres. Where was the secrecy? We negotiated some\r\n\r\nterms. We published the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper and we discussed it for two weeks. We\r\n\r\nare still discussing it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, Sir, this motion before the House is\r\n\r\nlike many things that the Bari-san Sosialis is doing in catching up with history.\r\n\r\nThis motion is past history. The\r\n\r\nmerger proposals have been approved in this\r\n\r\nAssemhly and now we move for-ward. If the Barisan Sosialis are tailing behind\r\n\r\nwhat I once called the \"loco-motive of history\", then I am very sorry.\r\n\r\nBy the time -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> By P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmachines!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - the merger train crosses the\r\n\r\nCauseway, passes Batu\r\n\r\nPahat and Gemas and reaches Kuala Lumpur, the\r\n\r\ngentleman will still be\r\n\r\npanting away in this island of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it\r\n\r\nwas in June 1960 when\r\n\r\nthe Chairman of the former Hong Lim Branch, at a\r\n\r\nParty conference of 43\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Assemblymen and Party Branch delegates,\r\n\r\nraised the question of the re-vision of the Singapore Constitution because not\r\n\r\nonly the people felt but I,\r\n\r\nfrom my personal experience, during my work, could\r\n\r\nfeel the inadequacies of the\r\n\r\nConstitution; that we were hamstrung everywhere by\r\n\r\nthose inadequacies. Also,\r\n\r\n1 had formed the opinion that the forces of\r\n\r\ncolonialism were still strong. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership then, as they are now, were not\r\n\r\nprepared to fight these forces\r\n\r\nbut were prepared to join and work hand in hand\r\n\r\nwith them. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, our proposal was to discuss the principle of\r\n\r\nrevision of the Constitudon,\r\n\r\nat this Party Conference, and later to submit to a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee which\r\n\r\nwould go into minute details. But unfortunately,\r\n\r\nSir, this proposal to revise\r\n\r\nthe Constitution was rejected then by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n40 of the Assemblymen present and only\r\n\r\nthree of 'them were courageous enough to come out\r\n\r\nand support the then Hong\r\n\r\nLim Branch. Many of the delegates present were\r\n\r\ncovved because of the presence\r\n\r\nof police personnel and other measures of terror\r\n\r\npresent at the particular con-ference, and our proposal was rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, later we brought the proposal\r\n\r\nto this Assembly. And when\r\n\r\nthe Hong Lim 16 resolution.s were put to the\r\n\r\npeople during the Hong Lim by-election, they were enthusiastically supported.\r\n\r\nWe are happy to state today that\r\n\r\nrnany of those who disagreed with our  views are\r\n\r\nnow coming slovvly to our side\r\n\r\nand they agree that there should be some form of\r\n\r\nconstitutional revision to give\r\n\r\nmore adequate powers to the people of  Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after the defeat of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nin two by-elections - the\r\n\r\nHong Lim and Anson by-elections - the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership was, we could feel,\r\n\r\ntrying to save its skin by working out some sort of\r\n\r\nconstitutional somersault.\r\n\r\nThis is contained in the White Paper, which the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. with the support of the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. have adopted in this Assembly. But it is one\r\n\r\nthing to discuss a Bill or\r\n\r\nany constitutional proposals or any motion in this\r\n\r\nChamber and another\r\n\r\nthing to discuss them dispassionately and\r\n\r\nobjectively clause by clause, and in\r\n\r\ndetail, in the calm and serenity of an All-Party\r\n\r\nconference.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> No doubt, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere will be as many\r\n\r\nParties debating in this Assembly, as there will be\r\n\r\nin an All-Party conference.\r\n\r\nBut it is one thing debating issues here and\r\n\r\nanother thing disoussing issues, for\r\n\r\ninstance, in the coolness of the Select Committee\r\n\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have from the very beginning\r\n\r\nasked this Government to\r\n\r\nput forvvard its merger proposals to an All-Party\r\n\r\nconference. Even the former\r\n\r\ndiscredited S.P.A. Govemment, which was then the\r\n\r\nLabour Front, put forward\r\n\r\ntheir proposals for constitutional reforms to an\r\n\r\nAll-Party conference. In\r\n\r\naddition, it was an All-Party delegation which was\r\n\r\nsent to England to discuss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the  British  the details  as  based  on  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  principles adopted by the  conference.  In\r\n\r\nour  opinion, Sir, even though the White Paper  was\r\n\r\npassed  in  this Assembly by the P.A.P. Assemblymen\r\n\r\nand the S.P.A. Alliance Assemblymen, when 17 of the\r\n\r\nOpposition Assemblymen staged a walk-out,  I  still\r\n\r\nfeel  it  is  not  too late for the  Government  to\r\n\r\nsubmit  its  White Paper proposals to an  All-Party\r\n\r\nconference for further discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the Government is\r\n\r\nhesitant  to  subject itself to the detailed  close\r\n\r\nscrutiny  of  an All-Party conference because  they\r\n\r\nhave  something  to  hide. Sir,  radio  forums  and\r\n\r\nChamber  of  Commerce  forums are  not  necessarily\r\n\r\nadequate for a close scrutiny of the minute details\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P. merger proposals. In the same way,  a\r\n\r\ndebate  in this Assembly is not adequate enough  to\r\n\r\nprobe   into  the  details  of  the  P.A.P. merger\r\n\r\nproposals.   Therefore,   every   Party   in    the\r\n\r\nOpposition - and I am sure, for this matter, even the\r\n\r\nS.P.A.,  though  it  has  already  voted  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment - will support the convening of this  All-Party conference. We sincerely and honestly ask the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to reconsider the position  and  submit\r\n\r\nits  White Paper and all its other proposals to  an\r\n\r\nAll-Party conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have asked the Government,\r\n\r\nafter discussion at an All-Party conference, to put\r\n\r\nforward  its  proposals  to  the  people   in   the\r\n\r\nreferendum.  After  having been  pressed  by  three\r\n\r\nParties in the Opposition in the last few days, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  withdrew  the  Second  Reading  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore National Referendum Bill. The Government,\r\n\r\nnow hard pressed, has given us an assurance that it\r\n\r\nwill  continue  with the referendum.  We  prefer  a\r\n\r\nreferendum  and  this  has been  supported  by  all\r\n\r\nParties in principle -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Not by the Barisan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> We support a referendum to\r\n\r\nthrash out the merger issue. Because it is only one\r\n\r\nissue, a referendum would be more suitable. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLiberal Socialist Party has the same views  as  the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party, the Barisan Sosialis and us on  the\r\n\r\nmerger  proposals   - Automatic citizenship  for  all\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens. But in a general election,  if\r\n\r\nthe  people  want  to  vote for  automatic  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship for all Singapore citizens,  they  have\r\n\r\nto  make  up  their minds whether to vote  for  the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialists  or the Singapore  Congress  who\r\n\r\nhave  the  same stand, or to vote for  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  or  the  Workers'  Party  or  the  United\r\n\r\nPeople's Party. Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, it  is\r\n\r\non  that basis that we have called for a referendum\r\n\r\nto  thrash  out this matter of merger. I will  even\r\n\r\nsay  that the convening and the supervision of  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  should not be by Government  alone  but\r\n\r\nalso by the same All-Party Conference, which should\r\n\r\ndecide on the words, and the way the referendum  is\r\n\r\nto be carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order that the referendum\r\n\r\nwould be fair and properly conducted, the All-Party\r\n\r\nConference   should  also  extend  its   work   and\r\n\r\nsupervise the referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Take over the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure\r\n\r\nthat that would not be long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Barisan, watch out!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion\r\n\r\nbefore the House contains three problems.

When we\r\n\r\nfought  this present discredited P.A.P. leadership\r\n\r\nin  Hong Lim, we fought on the basic principle that\r\n\r\nwe  will come to this House to press the Government\r\n\r\nto carry out its mandate which they had in 1959 and\r\n\r\nto  see that they will carry on as an honest, clean\r\n\r\nand  responsible  Government and  that  we  in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  will egg them on.

It is, therefore, our  duty  to\r\n\r\n          clarify  the  position of the people of  Singapore,\r\n\r\n          principally the Chinese. We must allay these  fears\r\n\r\n          and  create the conditions for merger. This is  our\r\n\r\n          immediate task.

We\r\n\r\n          must  also  resolve the two fears  which  make  the\r\n\r\n          Malay  majority  in  the Federation  not  want  the\r\n\r\n          Chinese majority in Singapore.\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\n                                *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            This is  even more true now than four years  ago.\r\n\r\n          For to achieve freedom in an island we must achieve\r\n\r\n          merger.  Singapore  by itself,  an  island  of  224\r\n\r\n          square  miles  with  a population  of  1.5  million\r\n\r\n          living mainly on its trade with the Federation  and\r\n\r\n          Indonesia, cannot hope for anything more  than  the\r\n\r\n          status of Hongkong or Taiwan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Let there be no doubts on this point. The problem\r\n\r\n          after  merdeka in the Federation is quite different\r\n\r\n          from  that  before merdeka.

For two weeks, to the point  of\r\n\r\nutter  tedium  and  boredom, we heard  nothing  but\r\n\r\ntirade after tirade which can leave nobody with any\r\n\r\ndoubts  that if anybody can bring about a concensus\r\n\r\nof minds on merger, he must be either a superman or\r\n\r\na   hypnotist  to  take  them  out  of  their   own\r\n\r\npersonalities. The Member for Anson may or may  not\r\n\r\nbelieve  this, but he at least makes a pretence  of\r\n\r\nit  for the show of it -  discussion, and so on.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown does not bother about it.  He\r\n\r\nis  a  bit new and straightforward. He tried rugger\r\n\r\nas a rugger forward, and a very good rugger forward\r\n\r\nhe  was  too, I was told. I will tell him  now  why\r\n\r\nthese things have happened in the way they did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960 we analysed for him and he read this with\r\n\r\napproval -  \"Long-term objectives\", page 3:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In following and countering the twists and turns\r\n\r\nof  the  political propaganda of opposing  parties,\r\n\r\nlet  us  never  forget that the people  will  never\r\n\r\ntrust a party which breaks faith with them.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have clearly stated that we stand for an\r\n\r\nindependent,  democratic, non-Communist.

As we said  in  our\r\n\r\nParty  statement:  \"To achieve  freedom  it  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger  just  a  simple question  of  fighting  the\r\n\r\nBritish\".  That is not to say that we  should  stop\r\n\r\nfighting the British colonialists. But if  that  is\r\n\r\nall  we  do  then we deserve to fail  for  our  own\r\n\r\nstupidity.  These Left-Wing Adventurers are  driven\r\n\r\nby  the  logical consequences of their argument  to\r\n\r\nonly fight the colonialists and to do nothing which\r\n\r\nis constructive until complete independence, to say\r\n\r\nthat   they   want  to  fight  for  an  independent\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realised after 31-8-57 that only to fight the\r\n\r\nBritish  and do nothing constructive until complete\r\n\r\nindependence cannot produce an independent  Malaya,\r\n\r\nbecause the Federation was already independent.  It\r\n\r\ncan only produce an independent Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... But we say that an independent Singapore once\r\n\r\nestablished  cannot lead to merger by  consent.  If\r\n\r\nmerger  comes it would then be by the  conquest  of\r\n\r\none  over  the other. For an independent  Singapore\r\n\r\nonce  established, even for an interim period, will\r\n\r\ncreate a situation whereby vested interests,  based\r\n\r\non Chinese appeals, will become permanent. For once\r\n\r\nindependence  is achieved in this island  city,  75\r\n\r\nper  cent  of  whose  population  is  Chinese,  the\r\n\r\nlogical  consequence  would  be  that  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nchauvinist  sentiments which are at  present  being\r\n\r\nmuted and slowly dissolved because of the objective\r\n\r\nof  independence  through merger, will  openly  and\r\n\r\naggressively come to the fore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Page 6:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Let us face the facts. An independent Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  not  result  in  merger, for  Singapore  will\r\n\r\nbecome  an  increasingly Chinese City with  Chinese\r\n\r\nfrom   the   Federation,  and  perhaps  some   from\r\n\r\nIndonesia as well seeking refuge in Singapore...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Merger inevitable</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merger between the Federation and Singapore is\r\n\r\nhistorically inevitable...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is simply that the Federation cannot\r\n\r\nafford to have a hostile Singapore.

A  hostile\r\n\r\nindependent  Singapore must  lead  to  retaliation,\r\n\r\nconflict   and   in  the  end,  to  conquest.

There  can  be no  agreement  with  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis for the simple reason  that  they\r\n\r\ncannot  afford to agree to merger. It is as  simple\r\n\r\nas  that.

If  it  is  the  intention  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister or the P.A.P. Government to try and equate\r\n\r\nthe  sort of merger plans that have been negotiated\r\n\r\nby  them  with  the desire of the  people  to  have\r\n\r\ngenuine unification of the two territories, then  I\r\n\r\nsay  it is titter nonsense because, Sir, as  I  was\r\n\r\nsaying,  in the course of two weeks in this  House,\r\n\r\nthose  of  us in the Barisan Sosialis explained  in\r\n\r\ngreat  detail  why we thought the  terms  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   Government   had  negotiated   would   not\r\n\r\nconstitute  genuine reunification. Sir,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to be like the Prime Minister and quote pages\r\n\r\nfrom  P.A.P. propaganda documents. I do  not  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  the  place  or the  time  to  indulge  in\r\n\r\ntheoretical  arguments  over  certain  theses   the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leaders have made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  all  that I want to state here in  very  clear\r\n\r\nterms is this. Nobody doubts the fact that in 1959,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  P.A.P. ran for the  elections,  it  had\r\n\r\nmerger  as  an  issue. If we  go  through  all  the\r\n\r\nelection documents, speeches made by all the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters during the elections, one will note  that\r\n\r\nthere  was no definition of this word \"merger\".  At\r\n\r\nthat  time,  the Prime Minister did  not  tell  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  that when  the  P.A.P. said\r\n\r\nmerger, they were thinking of a sort of merger that\r\n\r\nthey  have  now negotiated. They did not  tell  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore that in their merger plan  they\r\n\r\nwanted to make the people of Singapore second-class\r\n\r\ncitizens -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nis now going back on a debate which we have had. As\r\n\r\nhe  has indicated, we did have a 14-day debate.  He\r\n\r\ncan  just touch on that in passing, but not go into\r\n\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Actually, Sir, it is not my intention\r\n\r\nto  go  back  to the debate. I just  want  to  make\r\n\r\nreplies  to  some of the points the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nraised  just now. As I was saying, the  main  point\r\n\r\nhere  is  that  during the elections the  form  and\r\n\r\nsubstance  of  merger was never  explained  to  the\r\n\r\npeople, for one simple reason, and that is that  at\r\n\r\nthat  time nobody thought merger would be what  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. says merger is now. Ever since  1946,  ever\r\n\r\nsince  the  separation of the two territories  when\r\n\r\nthe call for unification of the two territories was\r\n\r\nmade, everybody accepted the fact that merger means\r\n\r\nSingapore going in as one constituent State in  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, enjoying the same privileges,\r\n\r\nenjoying the equal status as any other State in the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya. Today, the arrangement  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has made is quite definitely not merger  in\r\n\r\nthe  sense of the word. Therefore, I think it is  a\r\n\r\nwaste  of  time for the Prime Minister or  for  any\r\n\r\nother   Minister  or  any  other  Member   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  at  this stage of the  debate  on  this\r\n\r\nmotion  to  try  and say that this was  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npledge and that the Barisan Sosialis have gone away\r\n\r\nfrom the P.A.P. and therefore they have broken  the\r\n\r\nelection  pledge.  We are all associated  with  the\r\n\r\nelection  pledge, and we state quite  categorically\r\n\r\nthat we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstand  for  merger.  But for complete  and  genuine\r\n\r\nmerger which will bring about genuine unity of  our\r\n\r\npeople and not for any other arrangement which will\r\n\r\nbring about greater disunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion before us indeed is one that is\r\n\r\nlong  overdue for debate. Sir, you will  appreciate\r\n\r\nit  is not the fault of the Barisan Sosialis.  This\r\n\r\nmotion  was  filed  a long time ago;  a  long  time\r\n\r\nbefore the White Paper was debated here. If  it  is\r\n\r\nonly  possible  to debate this motion  today  here,\r\n\r\nthen  I  am  sure the Government Members themselves\r\n\r\nknow  the  reasons. Sir, although we know that  the\r\n\r\nterms and conditions for the so-called merger  have\r\n\r\nbeen  negotiated by the P.A.P. Government, although\r\n\r\nperhaps  it  is too late for the Prime Minister  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  go  back  and  reopen  negotiations,\r\n\r\nnevertheless,  we feel, for record  purposes,  this\r\n\r\nmotion must be gone through and our views recorded.\r\n\r\nSir,  merger, or for that matter any constitutional\r\n\r\nadvancement,  is  not something  that  affects  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the Prime Minister  alone.  Sir,  if\r\n\r\nmerger  were to mean the Prime Minister  getting  a\r\n\r\nDato or a Tun, then we say it is immaterial. We are\r\n\r\nnot  concerned  with  what  happens  to  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Singapore  on  merger.  We  are   not\r\n\r\nconcerned  with what happens to the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nin   a  situation  where  there  is  constitutional\r\n\r\nadvancement.  Sir, we are concerned with  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  if  you  talk of constitutional  advancement,\r\n\r\nthen the people's views must be fairly assessed. It\r\n\r\nis  important  that you talk of the desire  of  the\r\n\r\npeople   when   you  negotiate  for  constitutional\r\n\r\nadvancement.  It is useless for the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nto  say that he had negotiated these terms, come to\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly, and put them forward  saying,  \"You\r\n\r\nagree or you do not agree - these are the terms.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the principle of having an All-Party meeting\r\n\r\nand having a common decision before negotiating for\r\n\r\nconstitutional  advancement  does  not  imply  that\r\n\r\nGovernment  negotiates,  arrives  at  a  settlement\r\n\r\nfirst and then tries to push it down the throats of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore. I am  sure  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  admit that in spite  of  all  the\r\n\r\nfailings  of  the previous Government - a  Government\r\n\r\nwhich I consider to have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  reactionary  than  the  P.A.P.  Government - at\r\n\r\nleast  it  had  the courtesy to call  an  All-Party\r\n\r\nmeeting;  at least it had the courtesy to  take  an\r\n\r\nAll-Party  team  to  London  to  negotiate  for   a\r\n\r\nconstitutional arrangement. The simple point is  if\r\n\r\nwe  are  talking  of merger or any  other  form  of\r\n\r\nconstitutional change, we must bear in mind that it\r\n\r\nis bound to affect the lives of all the people. And\r\n\r\nin  a  democratic  society with  various  political\r\n\r\ngroups  operating, it is not the  monopoly  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to go and negotiate on its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we regard merger as a national issue and we\r\n\r\nwould like to see the Government treating it  as  a\r\n\r\nnational  issue. I say that we want  to  be  merged\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation of Malaya and  not  submerged\r\n\r\ninto the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have said in the motion here that if\r\n\r\nthere  should  be  no agreement  in  the  All-Party\r\n\r\nmeeting   on   all  points  of  the  constitutional\r\n\r\narrangement, then the Government should seek a  new\r\n\r\nmandate.  Sir,  I  wish  to explain  here  that  we\r\n\r\npressed  for  elections before. We still  tell  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   that   if  they  cannot   fulfil   the\r\n\r\naspirations  of the people, then they  should  quit\r\n\r\nand resign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You resign first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> But we do not want people like the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister to say all sorts of things and  get\r\n\r\naway  with  them.

We  are  satisfied   that   this\r\n\r\nGovernment does not any longer represent the  views\r\n\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the excuse that the P.A.P. gave for not\r\n\r\nwanting to hold elections to determine this  merger\r\n\r\nissue  was that, according to them, there would  be\r\n\r\ntoo  many candidates and too many symbols  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  would  be  confused.  This  is  an  utterly\r\n\r\nridiculous excuse, because if you follow that, then\r\n\r\nit  must  logically  mean that in  1959,  when  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. stood  for election, the people  were  also\r\n\r\nconfused because there were also too\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany  candidates and too many symbols. It is a lame\r\n\r\nexcuse  that the P.A.P. is putting forward  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we were disturbed to note that even the\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill has now been deferred.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  but there is a rumour in town that the  P.AP.\r\n\r\nis  quite fearful of holding a referendum now.  But\r\n\r\nwe  tell them this quite clearly, that it is better\r\n\r\nfor them to consult the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has said very clearly\r\n\r\ntoday -  this was the only part of his speech that  I\r\n\r\nthought  was  relevant to the debate; in  the  past\r\n\r\nwhenever  we said that the Government was preparing\r\n\r\nfor repressive action, whenever we said they wanted\r\n\r\nto  take  anti-democratic repressive action against\r\n\r\ntheir  political  opponents, he said  that  it  was\r\n\r\nCommunist  propaganda   - coming  from  the   horse's\r\n\r\nmouth,  that so many things are going to happen  in\r\n\r\n1962. He said, not merger but \"so many other things\r\n\r\nare going to happen in 1962.\" I think it is correct\r\n\r\nto   say   that   everybody  has   a   very   clear\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of exactly what the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  said. Sir, I do not know the purpose of  that.\r\n\r\nAll  that  he  means is that in  1962  perhaps  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis may not exist. All that he  means\r\n\r\nis  that  maybe  some of us will  disappear,  maybe\r\n\r\ntaken   away  as  the  guests  of  honour  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment -   maybe Changi Gaol, Batu Gajah;  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  know where. But as I was saying, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nknow  the  purpose of the Prime Minister by  saying\r\n\r\nit.  But  if  he  thinks  that  he  is  trying   to\r\n\r\nintimidate  us, then I say that he is  wasting  his\r\n\r\nbreath and his time, because people like us are not\r\n\r\neasily  intimidated by repressive talk.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister ought to know it, Sir. He was at one  time\r\n\r\nfighting  a very repressive Government.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  what  private arrangement  he  had  with  the\r\n\r\nformer  Chief  Minister but, nevertheless,  on  the\r\n\r\nopen   front   he  was  fighting  tl1e   repressive\r\n\r\nGovernment.  He knows that all this talk  does  not\r\n\r\nfrighten people. All that I want to tell the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  - he is not here but the Deputy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister is here - is that as people who  have\r\n\r\nfor  some  time  worked in muss organisations  they\r\n\r\nought  to  realise  that the more  repressive  they\r\n\r\nbecome  the more they \"anchor\" the people.  You  do\r\n\r\nnot  frighten  and muzzle the people  into  bending\r\n\r\ndown  because  you talk of guns  and  gaols  in  an\r\n\r\nintimidatory tone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have no doubts whatsoever in our minds.\r\n\r\nThe  Tunku  has  said - I do not have the  newspapers\r\n\r\nwith  me-in the Federal Parliament, \"Singapore  has\r\n\r\nmore  strikes  in one month than the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  has  in  three  years.  We  want  to   help\r\n\r\nSingapore to reduce the number of strikes. I do not\r\n\r\nknow how to do it. But my Minister for the Interior\r\n\r\nsays  that he knows how to do it.\" It is  all  very\r\n\r\nclear. But what is important here is this. All that\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister has said has merely  confirmed\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have  been  saying.  Because  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership today finds itself isolated, it does not\r\n\r\nhave  `the  guts, like the previous  Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment had, to take direct action by itself. It\r\n\r\nwants  to  work  out  a constitutional  arrangement\r\n\r\nwhereby someone else will do its dirty job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is no use for the P.A.P. to talk of being\r\n\r\na socialist Party, anti-colonial, nationalist, etc.\r\n\r\nIt  is  very  simple. In this talk  of  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia, the P.A.P. has proved by its own  actions\r\n\r\nvery clearly that it is isolated from all socialist\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. has not worked and seen eye to\r\n\r\neye  with the Socialist Front in the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya. It has not worked and seen eye to eye  with\r\n\r\nthe  Party  Ra'ayat in Brunei. It is the same  with\r\n\r\nthe  Sarawak United People's Party. Sir,  the  line\r\n\r\ncan  be easily seen today. The P.A.P. stands on one\r\n\r\nside  today  with the S.P.A., the British  and  the\r\n\r\nAlliance Government of the Federation of Malaya. On\r\n\r\nthe other side, you see the socialist Parties. I am\r\n\r\nsure, Sir, you will not allow me to expound on  the\r\n\r\ntheory  the  Prime Minister was trying to  develop,\r\n\r\nthat  the P.A.P. are nationalist and that all those\r\n\r\nwho  disagree with them are necessarily Communists.\r\n\r\nBut  I tell them this, Sir, if they want to measure\r\n\r\nthe  extent  of  nationalist feelings  amongst  the\r\n\r\npeople,  let them not use their type of  merger  as\r\n\r\nthe yardstick because that is not the yardstick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to say very much in conclusion\r\n\r\nexcept  that  I had the impression that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister - Sir, right now, I do not know whether  you\r\n\r\nbelieve in magic but I -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

But all that I  want  to\r\n\r\nsay  is  that  insofar as Singapore  is  concerned,\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  merger mean one and the  same  thing\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- i.e. P.A.P. type of phoney merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

In  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, the issue of merger takes on  a  far\r\n\r\nwider  meaning and graver importance than even  our\r\n\r\nown political needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singapore rejects a referendum on the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nproposals,  then not only will there be  no  merger\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore  and the Federation,  but  there\r\n\r\nwill  be no Malaysia at all, for Singapore  is  the\r\n\r\npivot  and  the  cornerstone of  Malaysia.  Let  us\r\n\r\nrecognise  its  importance in this context  and  in\r\n\r\nthis  concept. There is reason to believe  that  an\r\n\r\nhonest   referendum  put  to   the   people   would\r\n\r\nuncompromisingly result in a rejection of the White\r\n\r\nPaper proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has bungled the negotiations with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government and the presentation  of\r\n\r\nthe  proposals to the people and to this  Assembly.\r\n\r\nIt  is remarkable, Mr Speaker, that in a matter of\r\n\r\nsuch  grave national moment affecting not only  the\r\n\r\npeople   of  Singapore  of  today  but  all  future\r\n\r\ngenerations, this Government should act  as  though\r\n\r\nSingapore  was  its  property and  its  people  the\r\n\r\nslaves of the Prime Minister, to be disposed of  at\r\n\r\nhis  pleasure and according to his own  concept  of\r\n\r\nwhat  is  good for us. Singapore is not a  personal\r\n\r\nfief  of the Prime Minister and, Mr Speaker,  even\r\n\r\nif he were a popular Prime Minister and even if the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. had  the  respect  and  confidence  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  it  would  be wrong not to  associate  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  in an issue of such ultimate importance\r\n\r\nto  the whole people. Democracy does not mean  that\r\n\r\nthe  majority  should steamroller the minority  and\r\n\r\nimpose  its will on it. Though this may not be  the\r\n\r\nlanguage    of    `the   Minister   for    Culture,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, Mr Speaker, the essence of democracy\r\n\r\nis that it must respect and take into consideration\r\n\r\nminority  views and interests. It is not  democracy\r\n\r\nbut  Fascism  when it seeks to steamroller  through\r\n\r\nmajor  issues without reference to or  respect  for\r\n\r\nthese  minority views and interests. But  far  from\r\n\r\nbeing a popular leader, and the Government far from\r\n\r\nhaving  the confidence of the people, they must  be\r\n\r\nconscious that today they are viewed with more than\r\n\r\nsuspicion and anger, even reaching to contempt,  by\r\n\r\nthe vast\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmajority of our people. I had hard words to say  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Cairnhill when lie  hung  on  to\r\n\r\npower. I cannot understand the present Front  Bench\r\n\r\nbeing  able  to support the burden of this  massive\r\n\r\ncontempt and yet clinging on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the people are conscious that the Prime Minister and his Party are politically bankrupt. The people know that the Prime Minister and his Party know that they would never survive another election. In this context, Mr Speaker, for the Prime Minister to seek to negotiate off his own bat the future of this island is legitimately\r\n\r\nviewed  with grave suspicion. I ask him to look  at\r\n\r\nthe  way  he has presented these proposals  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  I  say that it is impossible  to  contrive\r\n\r\nanything  more  tortuous - even  the  genius  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture for the tortuous  could  not\r\n\r\nconceive  anything more messy than the  strip-tease\r\n\r\nmethod  of  revelation, bit by bit,  of  issues  so\r\n\r\nvital  to  our future. The letters from the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister purported to seek the  co-operation\r\n\r\nof  the  Opposition,  but were blatantly  used  for\r\n\r\npropaganda purposes, particularly the second letter\r\n\r\nwherein  it informed the people that we would  have\r\n\r\nequal  status, privileges and powers as  all  other\r\n\r\nStates  in  the  Federation with  more  portfolios,\r\n\r\nconcealing  consciously the vital aspect  that  not\r\n\r\none  of  us  would be a citizen of the  Federation.\r\n\r\nThat  is  not  clever, Mr Speaker, I have  another\r\n\r\nword  for it and I have used it in public, inviting\r\n\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister to sue me. He has not.  I\r\n\r\nsay  it is not clever and it is not even necessary.\r\n\r\nManeuvers and tactics of so cheap a character based\r\n\r\non  the  theory that the people are blind  chickens\r\n\r\nare not decent and are not necessary in the context\r\n\r\nof  these proposals. Finally, Sir, the tactics that\r\n\r\nwere  indulged in which so messed up  these  merger\r\n\r\nproposals  when finally they conceded  our  request\r\n\r\nfor  a  sitting of this Assembly. You will remember\r\n\r\nwhat transpired. You will remember the use of their\r\n\r\npowers under the Standing Orders to manipulate  the\r\n\r\ntime  during  which the items could be debated  and\r\n\r\nthe interventions in the debate. According to their\r\n\r\nlikes, Mr Speaker, that was clever propaganda. But\r\n\r\nto  my  mind,  if there had been an  honest  and  a\r\n\r\nsimpler\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napproach to a difficult but honest problem, instead\r\n\r\nof this messy approach, we might well have obtained\r\n\r\nthe  sympathy of the waverers instead  of,  through\r\n\r\nthis  approach, having made waverers of  those  who\r\n\r\nwere believers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems pathologically impossible for the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister to understand simplicity or to  act\r\n\r\nwith  simplicity. I am almost convinced that  every\r\n\r\nruler  on  his  desk  must  have  the  shape  of  a\r\n\r\ncorkscrew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat, Mr Speaker, we have reached a point\r\n\r\nwhere  there  is  a  real danger  that  the  entire\r\n\r\nconcept  of  Malaysia will be nullified because  of\r\n\r\nthe  tortuous  approach of  this  Government  to  a\r\n\r\nsimple  issue. But it is so important and so  vital\r\n\r\nto  our  welfare that I think it would be wrong  to\r\n\r\ngive up hope. I think it would be wrong not to  try\r\n\r\nand keep on trying. And I say it is not too late to\r\n\r\nsalvage this concept and the spirit of this  motion\r\n\r\nwhich  seeks  an  All-Party team and  provides  the\r\n\r\nmeans of salvaging the concept of Malaysia from the\r\n\r\nrubbish  heap of lost ideals. We of the  Opposition\r\n\r\nare  aware that the Government are of the view that\r\n\r\nonly their Prime Minister is capable of intelligent\r\n\r\npolitical thinking, clever thinking, and that we of\r\n\r\nthe   Opposition   have  nothing   to   contribute.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I ask them to recognise  that  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  that  the Opposition,  even  though  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  think us stupid, should  be  associated\r\n\r\nwith  these  negotiations in order that the  people\r\n\r\nshould  be  satisfied that these  negotiations  are\r\n\r\nhonest  and not negotiations intended to  rescue  a\r\n\r\nbankrupt crew. If Opposition Members are associated\r\n\r\nwith  the  negotiations, they  can  both  test  the\r\n\r\nstrength of the feelings in the Federation,  and  I\r\n\r\nam convinced that many in this House are not really\r\n\r\nconscious  of the strong feelings in the Federation\r\n\r\nin  respect of some of the matters that are raised.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  if  they  knew of the  strength  of  those\r\n\r\nfeelings,  they  themselves would  temper  to  some\r\n\r\nextent  their  own  demands. I am  in  the  curious\r\n\r\nposition  of  not belonging to either  of  the  two\r\n\r\nmajor races. I can see and I do sympathise with the\r\n\r\napproach  of  each of them. I can understand  their\r\n\r\npoint  of  view.  I can recognise the  validity  of\r\n\r\ntheir fears on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neach  side,  even though I may disagree,  as  I  do\r\n\r\ndisagree,  with the approach, at times intransigent\r\n\r\nof  both  sides.  But I say that if the  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers   are  associated  in  a  team  honest   in\r\n\r\nnegotiating the merger proposals, we may `be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to be of assistance, because, let  it  be\r\n\r\nrecognised  that  the  White Paper  is  not  beyond\r\n\r\namendment. Nobody has suggested that - not  even  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister. It may be that we may be able to be\r\n\r\nof  assistance, when coming back, to  explain  both\r\n\r\nthe  difficulties that are to be met on  the  other\r\n\r\nside  and the intensity of the earnest efforts that\r\n\r\nare  being  made  by  our side to  explain  to  the\r\n\r\nelectorate and to satisfy them that this is  not  a\r\n\r\nshameless   effort   at  personal   rescue   of   a\r\n\r\ndiscredited political party and an egomaniac leader\r\n\r\nbut  an  honest effort at reunification  with  many\r\n\r\ndisadvantages. I think it is not unfair to ask  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Benches at least to pay lip service  to\r\n\r\nthe    possibility   that   the   Opposition   have\r\n\r\nconstructive ideas. I ask them to cast their  minds\r\n\r\nback to other constitutional conferences from which\r\n\r\nthey  were  not shut out, and let them  admit  that\r\n\r\npersons   now  in  the  Opposition  did  contribute\r\n\r\nconstructively  and  perhaps at  times  in  greater\r\n\r\nmeasure  than their super-duper leader,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister. Whatever our disagreements, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nwe  of  the  Opposition say to the Government  that\r\n\r\nhowever  strongly we resent individually the  cheap\r\n\r\ninsults that stem from the fountain-head of  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nculture,  let us recognise that there is  sincerity\r\n\r\non our part in seeking the welfare of Singapore and\r\n\r\nits  people,  and  that we can meet  in  the  quiet\r\n\r\ncommittee rooms in the interchange of ideas so that\r\n\r\nwe  may  perhaps  better  appreciate  each  other's\r\n\r\nsincerity.  I would like to believe that  there  is\r\n\r\nsincerity  and  not merely empty  sounds  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Benches. I say that it  could  be  very\r\n\r\nvaluable and it could do no harm to have this  All-Party team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you know as well as I do that constitutionally even a majority of one is adequate for the P.A.P. to go it alone.

As  a\r\n\r\nMember of the Opposition and as a representative of\r\n\r\nthe  people   - one  of  the  51 - I  demand  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should recognise the rights of those who\r\n\r\nhave  no  faith in the P.A.P., but who nevertheless\r\n\r\nare  honest  and decent citizens of this territory,\r\n\r\nand  who are entitled to have their representatives\r\n\r\nmade   fully  aware  of  and  assist  in   national\r\n\r\nnegotiations  with  the Federation  so  that  they\r\n\r\nshould  know the truth, so that they would be  able\r\n\r\nto come back and fully advise the electorate, apart\r\n\r\nfrom  assisting  in  every way they  could  in  the\r\n\r\nachievement  of  a  common  objective.  The   basic\r\n\r\nfallacy of the thesis of the Prime Minister and his\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture is, as pointed  out  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson, to equate merger with the White\r\n\r\nPaper proposals. Merger has always been understood.\r\n\r\nOf  course, we all have a mandate for merger, which\r\n\r\nis a complete reunification of our two territories.\r\n\r\nBut  there is no question but that they never  have\r\n\r\nor ever had any mandate for this type of absurdity.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, an All-Party team is constitutionally\r\n\r\nnecessary.  It  is  the  main  avenue  to  dissolve\r\n\r\nsuspicion and antagonism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Law has asked whether I do\r\n\r\nnot   any   longer  believe  in  independence   for\r\n\r\nSingapore.

It is because  I  really\r\n\r\nbelieved  that  all  Members in this  Assembly  can\r\n\r\ncontribute  their own ideas to the problem  that  I\r\n\r\nentered   into  correspondence  with   leaders   of\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties  represented in  this  Assembly.\r\n\r\nAssuming  that  I  treat  the  whole  lot  on   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  side  as nincompoops, as  people  whose\r\n\r\nopinions are not worthy of consideration,  I  would\r\n\r\nnot have written to them at all.

On\r\n\r\n1st  September, I received a reply from the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown.  I  will quote only  the  relevant\r\n\r\nparts:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I attach for your benefit a copy of the statement\r\n\r\nissued to the Press clearly outlining the stand  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis on our constitutional future.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  in the enclosed statement which he had already\r\n\r\nissued to the Press, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The way ahead for real reunification for our\r\n\r\ncountry  and  our people is one of two  directions:\r\n\r\n(a)  an  immediate, full and complete  merger  with\r\n\r\nSingapore  joining the Federation as a  constituent\r\n\r\nstate  like Penang or Malacca; (b) as an autonomous\r\n\r\nunit   within  a  confederation  with  the   Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories coming in when possible.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Continuing from his letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`You now ask for our views on your proposals. But\r\n\r\nhow  is  the  Government going to  accommodate  our\r\n\r\nviews  when they are fundamentally opposed  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's proposals, or are you just  trying  to\r\n\r\ngive  the impression to the public that we are  all\r\n\r\nbeing consulted on the matter.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, consultation with the Barisan Sosialis means\r\n\r\naccepting their demands. Two parties can come to  a\r\n\r\nmeeting  and either they come with fixed  views  or\r\n\r\nthey  come with an open mind that if they come they\r\n\r\nhave  to  agree or they come to disagree. Here  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis have stated in writing that  their\r\n\r\nviews are fundamentally opposed to the Government's\r\n\r\nproposals.   Therefore,  how  can   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment accommodate their views? In other words,\r\n\r\nthere  was  no  sincerity at all when  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  said they wanted an All-Party conference.\r\n\r\nSir,   we   are  not  prepared  to  be   like   the\r\n\r\nDisarmament  Conference in Geneva  which  has  been\r\n\r\nsitting for the last couple of years and has  never\r\n\r\ncome  to any conclusion. Tons of paper have  passed\r\n\r\nthrough  that Disarmament Conference and no  result\r\n\r\nhas  been achieved. And the reason is simple.  When\r\n\r\nyou have two diametrically opposed views present at\r\n\r\nthe  conference table, then it is difficult, if not\r\n\r\nimpossible, to arrive at any firm conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear too, Mr Speaker, that the\r\n\r\ndifferences of opinion between the P.A.P. and  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis did not originate on the  1st  of\r\n\r\nSeptember, when the Member for Queenstown  sent  me\r\n\r\nhis letter together with a statement outlining\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  aims of his Party.

On\r\n\r\n3rd  June  a  statement was  issued  by  six  trade\r\n\r\nunionists, one of whom is now the Secretary-General\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan Sosialis, who stated quite clearly\r\n\r\nthat   they   wanted  an  internal   self-governing\r\n\r\nSingapore  without the Security Council,  but  that\r\n\r\nthey   were  prepared  to  leave  foreign  affairs,\r\n\r\ndefence  and  the base in the hands of  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom. Did those six trade unionists ever consult\r\n\r\nus?   Did  they  consult  any  of  the  13  Barisan\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  who are sitting on the opposite  side?\r\n\r\nDid  they  consult  the people?

Security is to remain a subject\r\n\r\nfor local autonomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Alliance of S.P.A.-U.M.N.O.-M.C.A.-M.I.C. gives no answer but raises a query\r\n\r\nas  to  whether the arrangements amount to a merger\r\n\r\nor a confederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The United People's Party stands for complete\r\n\r\nmerger as a State in the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The Worker's Party wholeheartedly believes in\r\n\r\nmerger    with   the   Federation   and   considers\r\n\r\nconfederation a very valuable concept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that correct?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is what we replied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes.

The\r\n\r\nAssembly  was  reconvened. A debate  on  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  was  held  in  November  and  it  lasted   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable amount of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  took  us  12 days to arrive at some conclusion.\r\n\r\nWhere  then  is  the complaint that the  Opposition\r\n\r\npolitical Parties have not been consulted  or  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  not been given a chance  to  air  their\r\n\r\nviews?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> From July to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Beginning from 26th August,\r\n\r\nwhen I first wrote to them, up to November, when we\r\n\r\nhad   the   debate  on  merger,  there  was   ample\r\n\r\nopportunity given to them to express their views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister has said just now, it is\r\n\r\nimportant that if an All-Party Conference is to  be\r\n\r\nconvened,  then  it  is  important  too  that  some\r\n\r\nconcensus of opinion should be arrived at.  But  as\r\n\r\nwe have seen from the correspondence and the debate\r\n\r\nitself,  no possibility exists that five  political\r\n\r\nParties  in  this Assembly can come to  one  common\r\n\r\nagreement. In fact, the debate in the Assembly last\r\n\r\nNovember  highlighted considerable  differences  of\r\n\r\nopinion  among  us. The Members of  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nreferred  to the ex-Chief Minister -  the Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill - who  did  call for an  All-Party  meeting\r\n\r\nbefore  he  proceeded to the second  constitutional\r\n\r\ntalks.  That is quite correct. But when we were  in\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  at that time, we  never  came  out\r\n\r\npublicly   with  our  own  stand   of   what   that\r\n\r\nconstitutional conference should arrive at. We  had\r\n\r\nthe  decency  to answer his call and  to  meet  him\r\n\r\nprivately in his office. I was a Member of that All-Party  team and I issued no statements on what  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. would   ask  for  at  that  constitutional\r\n\r\nconference because that would have jeopardised  the\r\n\r\nAll-Party Conference. We adopted the same stand  at\r\n\r\nthe  first All-Party Conference led by the ex-Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, the Member for Anson. Perhaps he acted in\r\n\r\ngood  heart, but what were the results of that All-Party  Conference which was led by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson? The team went to London in 1956. They fought\r\n\r\nand  squabbled  with each other in  London  and  it\r\n\r\nended   up  with  the  isolation  of  the  ex-Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, the Member for Anson. Finally, the  talks\r\n\r\ncollapsed because he wanted his way\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the other political Party leaders wanted their\r\n\r\nown   way.   The   result  was   that   the   first\r\n\r\nconstitutional  conference led by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  was a miserable failure. It is vivid  in  my\r\n\r\nmemory from the reading of the papers and from  the\r\n\r\naccounts that that first constitutional conference,\r\n\r\nled  by the Member for Anson, ended up with the ex-Chief Minister going to an opera together with -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

One  of  the  first\r\n\r\nconditions  is  that  no  Party  should  adopt   an\r\n\r\ninflexible  attitude  before  the  conference.  The\r\n\r\nsecond  condition is that when you  arrive  at  the\r\n\r\nconference, you arrive with sincerity that you will\r\n\r\ncome  to an agreement, and not to come to disagree.\r\n\r\nAs  the  Member for Queenstown has asked, \"How  can\r\n\r\nthe  Government accommodate our views when you well\r\n\r\nknow  what  the stand of the Barisan Sosialis  is?\"\r\n\r\nWill such an All-Party Conference be useful?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I want to reply to the Member for Anson.\r\n\r\nHe  made  a  reference to the postponement  of  the\r\n\r\nSecond Reading of the Referendum Bill to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch.

Sir, I have heard of many prophets in  the\r\n\r\nBible, but I know that David is no prophet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to say that the motion moved by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Queenstown asking for an  All-Party\r\n\r\nConference only expresses their insincerity  simply\r\n\r\nbecause  they  never  wanted any  agreement  to  be\r\n\r\narrived  at  even  if an All-Party Conference  were\r\n\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Lee, in reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, you will notice from what\r\n\r\nI  said  that  I  moved this motion  on  a  factual\r\n\r\napproach. I never went into frivolities and I never\r\n\r\nsmeared  or  ridiculed. The whole speech  was  made\r\n\r\nfrom the point of view of an All-Party matter. If I\r\n\r\nhad  wanted to bring in the letters that the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister sent to me and the letters that  we\r\n\r\nsent  back to him, I would have taken a much longer\r\n\r\ntime.  But  since he has mentioned  some  of  those\r\n\r\nletters, Sir, I think it is only fair that  I  also\r\n\r\nmust  mention  them. In fact, of all  the  speeches\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Government Benches, the only person  who\r\n\r\nargued  against the points which I raised  was  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister. He was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrying  to  say that he was sincere and that  there\r\n\r\nwas   no   cause   for  asking  for  an   All-Party\r\n\r\nConference. He mentioned quite a number of letters,\r\n\r\nSir,I will answer him first. If you will remember\r\n\r\neven  in the speech I made, I had already mentioned\r\n\r\nthat the Deputy Prime Minister had sent letters  to\r\n\r\nleaders  of the Opposition Parties only  after  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  had already been agreed to  between  the\r\n\r\ntwo  Prime  Ministers. Now if  there  is  any  real\r\n\r\nintention  to  consult anybody,  you  do  not  send\r\n\r\nletters  to ask for details. First of all, you  ask\r\n\r\nfor principles to be agreed to before you ever come\r\n\r\nto  the  details. In this particular case  the  two\r\n\r\nPrime Ministers had already agreed to the two major\r\n\r\nprinciples  when  they  issued  their  first  joint\r\n\r\nstatement.  The first joint statement came  out  on\r\n\r\n23rd August. The Deputy Prime Minister, then Acting\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, sent us a letter on the 26th, three\r\n\r\ndays later. As I have said, it was an afterthought,\r\n\r\njust  to guard themselves against anything that  we\r\n\r\nmight  say against them, and to give the idea  that\r\n\r\nthey  did really consult the people. Where  is  the\r\n\r\nsincerity of consultation'? They never asked us for\r\n\r\nour views. So how could we give them our views?  If\r\n\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister says that he is going  to\r\n\r\ntake  note  of  all  the  views  published  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  then  I  say he  should  not  even  be\r\n\r\nsitting in this Assembly here today. Because if  he\r\n\r\nhad taken cognisance of the views expressed outside\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  and unofficially published  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers, he would not have the face to come  and\r\n\r\ntell us that he is still sincere or that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntoday has the support of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in all the P.A.P. attacks so far, the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister when he talked about what we  wrote\r\n\r\nto  him as regards the constitutional future, again\r\n\r\ntried to link it up with what we said about Malacca\r\n\r\nand  Penang. Sir, let me clarify this here in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  We  could well have said, \"like  Johore  or\r\n\r\nTrengganu, or any other State\". The only  reference\r\n\r\nwhich we made to Penang and Malacca was that Penang\r\n\r\nand  Malacca were colonies before. That  was  about\r\n\r\nall, on general principles. But we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade  sure  there  was no misunderstanding  of  our\r\n\r\nstand   when   we  also  said  in  the   succeeding\r\n\r\nparagraphs   that   we  wanted  automatic   Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  That  was in the same  statement  and\r\n\r\nappeared just one or two paragraphs below the  main\r\n\r\nheading.  But  the  P.A.P. has  been  mischievously\r\n\r\nsingling out just one portion of our statement  and\r\n\r\nnow tries to attack us on that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>\r\n\r\nWhat  about the radio forum?

When the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  wrote  to me on 6th September,  we  wrote\r\n\r\nback  to him on the 11th and asked him a number  of\r\n\r\nquestions.  To this day, Sir, that letter  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  replied to. We do not want to press  him  any\r\n\r\nfurther  because we know he does not want to  reply\r\n\r\nto  those  questions, as they are all  embarrassing\r\n\r\nquestions. He would rather the people did not  know\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. attitude in regard to those questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Sir, in all the speeches of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Benches  there was no  actual  argument\r\n\r\nagainst   what   I   have  said  as   regards   the\r\n\r\ndesirability of an All-Party conference.  Even  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture adopted the attitude that they\r\n\r\nwould consult the people only in their own way.  He\r\n\r\nalso talked of terms which \"we think are bad\".  All\r\n\r\nthese  words smack too much of the ego,  smack  too\r\n\r\nmuch  of arrogant people who think they can  decide\r\n\r\nthe  future for all the people of Singapore. I have\r\n\r\nalready made reference to this in my speech, namely\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P.'s great fault is that they  think\r\n\r\nthey are the only people who know what is best  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the other arguments have already been\r\n\r\nanswered  by my colleague, the Member for  Thomson.\r\n\r\nBut  great play has been made of the pledge we gave\r\n\r\nto the P.A.P.

That\r\n\r\npledge  is  in their Five-Year Plan. And  yet  they\r\n\r\ntalk  so  much  about election promises!  They  say\r\n\r\nmerger is one of their election pledges. But as has\r\n\r\nalready  been said, what type of merger'?  When  we\r\n\r\njoined the P.A.P. and when we supported merger,  we\r\n\r\nnever  for one moment thought that we would  get  a\r\n\r\ntype  of  merger that would give Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nno  Federal citizenship.

This is not the type of  merger  that\r\n\r\ngives  justice to all the people.

If\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  type of debate that the  Ministerial\r\n\r\nBenches  require, I suggest they use their majority\r\n\r\nto amend the Standing Orders so that there can be a\r\n\r\nrunning commentary from both sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Since he has found that\r\n\r\nsmearing us could not get us down, he tried the pro-Communist  and the Communist front line, and  since\r\n\r\nhe  could  not get us down that way, he  tried  the\r\n\r\nfamiliar tactic of praising one Member and  running\r\n\r\ndown  another in our Party, hoping thereby to cause\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  amongst us.  These  are  familiar\r\n\r\ntactics.  We  know all of them. We can see  through\r\n\r\nthem  right away. They are transparent.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  to have X-ray eyes to see how many bones they\r\n\r\nhave  in  their body. Everytime the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nspeaks  about the Communist menace and things  like\r\n\r\nthat, he refers to his Fourth Anniversary Souvenir.\r\n\r\nHe goes to great lengths to read passages of it for\r\n\r\neverybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has spoken very much about reunification of\r\n\r\nthe   two  territories.  Although  I  have  lightly\r\n\r\ntouched  on it before, I would like now to  enlarge\r\n\r\non  it  a bit here. As to why we really broke  away\r\n\r\nfrom   them,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  we  had  already\r\n\r\nexplained  that in our rallies and in our  speeches\r\n\r\non  the 20th of July. They wanted us to follow them\r\n\r\nblindly,  but  that  is not the  way  to  go  about\r\n\r\nthings.  They  should expect a  certain  amount  of\r\n\r\nintelligence  at least from us. We  all  understand\r\n\r\nthings  in  a certain way. The Prime Minister  says\r\n\r\nthat  we  had  read those passages  and  understood\r\n\r\nthose  passages.  We understand those  passages  to\r\n\r\nmean  that if there should be reunification of  the\r\n\r\ntwo  territories, it must be on a basis of  genuine\r\n\r\nequality, justice and democracy. There must  be  no\r\n\r\ndomination  of  one  section  of  the  people  over\r\n\r\nanother section. There are a lot of unfounded fears\r\n\r\nin   the   Federation,  and  the   P.A.P. leaders\r\n\r\nthemselves  realise that those fears are unfounded.\r\n\r\nBut,  unfortunately,  today they  have  gone  about\r\n\r\nenlarging  on those fears and trading on  them.  We\r\n\r\nhope  they will not play the communal line  because\r\n\r\nevery time they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalk  of  people who are anti-merger,  they  always\r\n\r\nlink  it up with the word \"anti-nationalists\". That\r\n\r\nis  a very dangerous line, Sir, and it can cause  a\r\n\r\nlot  of friction between the various races in  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  It is a funny thing that when  the  Tunku\r\n\r\nsaid  that he was anti-merger, the P.A.P. and  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister of Singapore never dared to say that\r\n\r\nthe Tunku was anti-national.

At this stage, I might be permitted to refer\r\n\r\nto  the  few words I had with him before  we  broke\r\n\r\naway from the P.A.P. He asked me, if he had merger,\r\n\r\nwould that mean a fulfilling of the promise made to\r\n\r\nthe  people? I said to him, \"Merger, yes.

When I reminded him - at that time there  was\r\n\r\nthe  Anson by-election - that the Tunku was  already\r\n\r\njoining hands with the S.P.A. against him, he could\r\n\r\nnot  reply.

I  wish to confine myself  now  to  the\r\n\r\nactual All-Party conference itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said already, Sir, merger is a national\r\n\r\nissue.  It is not a one-Party issue. If the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwant   the   people  to  believe  that   they   are\r\n\r\ndemocratic,  then they must practise  democracy  so\r\n\r\nthat  everyone  can  see it in practice.  Preaching\r\n\r\ndemocracy and not practising it will give democracy\r\n\r\na  bad  name and is in reality a dictatorship.

Democracy is  only\r\n\r\ndemocracy when it is practised by people  who  hold\r\n\r\npower.  If,  in holding power, they go  by  Fascist\r\n\r\nmethods,  then all this talk of democracy  is  very\r\n\r\nhollow,  and  nobody can take them very  seriously.\r\n\r\nThey   have   often   talked  about   parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  being on trial here. They hope  that  it\r\n\r\nwill  not  fail.  But it will fail  if  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npersists in its attitude of going about things that\r\n\r\nare national affairs on a one-Party basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has repeatedly said that the final decision of the future of Singapore must rest with the people. Well, let them consult the people. One of the ways of consulting the people is to have an All-Party conference where all the views can be put forward. We do not ask for a general election just because we want to come to power. It has\r\n\r\nalready  been explained that we want to  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  if  it is going to be a government that  will\r\n\r\nlook after the national question, then it must be a\r\n\r\ngovernment  that  will not only practise  democracy\r\n\r\nbut  can  also  really say that it  represents  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Everybody  knows that  the  P.A.P. is  an\r\n\r\nunpopular  Government  and  completely  discredited\r\n\r\nand, of course,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  reason why it dare  not  go  for  an\r\n\r\nelection.  In  the past the Prime  Minister  always\r\n\r\nused  to  challenge Members of the  Opposition  and\r\n\r\neven  Members  of the Government. I remember  there\r\n\r\nwas a challenge issued by the Prime Minister to the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson on a simple question. Yet now on a\r\n\r\nmajor issue, they dare not even mention it. We  are\r\n\r\nnot against a referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We are ready for the\r\n\r\nreferendum.

The\r\n\r\nMinister was good enough to make a statement a  few\r\n\r\ndays  later  assuring us that he  would  appoint  a\r\n\r\nCommission  in  the  spirit  of  those   terms   of\r\n\r\nreference. However, on Monday, Mr Deputy  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, somewhat to my consternation, I heard from the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister  that  the  appointment   of   the\r\n\r\nCommission  undertaken  would  not,  in  fact,   be\r\n\r\ncarried  out forthwith but would be on  the  never-never  plan in the nebulous future, because of  the\r\n\r\nneed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  a  High Court Judge and an inadequate  number\r\n\r\nwas not available to chair the four Commissions  he\r\n\r\nhad  in mind. I pointed out then that the main part\r\n\r\nof the motion did not require a High Court Judge - in\r\n\r\nfact, it would be rather inappropriate - and that the\r\n\r\nsecond  part of the motion could well be tagged  on\r\n\r\nto  the terms of reference of the Commission he had\r\n\r\nin mind, which was, in his own words, \"to look into\r\n\r\nthe  agitation in the Chinese middle  schools  over\r\n\r\nthe  conversion from the 3: 3 to 4:2  system  which\r\n\r\nled to the organisation of the attempted boycott of\r\n\r\nthe  first  secondary  certificate  examination  in\r\n\r\nDecember  last  year with particular  reference  to\r\n\r\nCommunist  cadres  behind  the  scenes  responsible\r\n\r\ntherefor\".   It  seemed  to  me  that   they   were\r\n\r\nassociated  and the proper thing was co make  those\r\n\r\ntwo terms of reference -  if in fact the two terms of\r\n\r\nreference were necessary - into one and leave that to\r\n\r\nthe High Court Judge and not delay the question  of\r\n\r\nthe appointment of the Commission on Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasise that when the Minister\r\n\r\nfor    Education   promised   this   Assembly   the\r\n\r\nappointment  of the Commission, he  made  it  plain\r\n\r\nthat  the  provisions he had contemplated  for  the\r\n\r\nrelaxation of the six-day week would no  longer  be \r\n\r\nput  into  effect, and therefore the  six-day  week\r\n\r\nwould  continue to plague parents and educationists\r\n\r\nwho are taking very strong exception. And everybody\r\n\r\nin   Singapore   was  entitled  to  believe   that,\r\n\r\nparticularly   in  view  of  the  action   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in not implementing proposals  for  the\r\n\r\nrelaxation  of  the six-day week, it would  proceed\r\n\r\nwith   expedition  to  the  appointment   of   this\r\n\r\nCommission  and not make it an excuse for  refusing\r\n\r\nto carry out measures which it itself recognised to\r\n\r\nbe  necessary and to be  called for. I  repeat,  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, it is not my desire that there\r\n\r\nshould  be - and I hope there would not be   - any\r\n\r\nattempt to criticise or praise or otherwise indulge\r\n\r\nin  statements  with reference to  the  educational\r\n\r\npolicy, because I am deeply anxious that the matter\r\n\r\nshould  be left to non-political educationists  and\r\n\r\npublic  men who could give us an impartial  picture\r\n\r\nwhich may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwell  be  complimentary to this Government   - and  I\r\n\r\nhope  also  to preceding governments - in respect  of\r\n\r\ntheir   efforts   in  the  field  of   multilingual\r\n\r\neducation  which was and is a brave  experiment  in\r\n\r\nthis  area. But this Commission should be  appointed\r\n\r\nforthwith and the purpose of my moving this  motion\r\n\r\nis   to  obtain  an  assurance  which  I  have  not\r\n\r\nobtained,  that  in  fact the  Commission  will  be\r\n\r\nappointed speedily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in\r\n\r\nreply to the Prime Minister, who said that in  view\r\n\r\nof  my suggestion I should write in to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education, I did, on the morning of the  16th,\r\n\r\nwhich was only yesterday, write an urgent letter to\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Education repeating my suggestion.\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would appreciate an indication from you by way\r\n\r\nof Ministerial or Press statement on the subject if\r\n\r\npossible  before the time for consideration  of  my\r\n\r\nmotion is reached.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  purpose of my request, Mr Deputy Speaker, was\r\n\r\nto  avoid  a debate on this motion if the terms  of\r\n\r\nthe  Press statement or Ministerial statement  were\r\n\r\nadequate.

I therefore intend\r\n\r\nto speak very briefly in a constructive manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that it is a very difficult task to\r\n\r\ntry  to  solve  the  problem  of  education  in   a\r\n\r\nmultiracial and multilingual\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsociety,  and if the Government have not  been  one\r\n\r\nhundred per cent successful in their attempts. I do\r\n\r\nnot  think  we  should blame  them.  But  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing so good that it cannot be improved.  If  we\r\n\r\ncould have an independent Commission of Inquiry  to\r\n\r\ngo    further   into   the   problem    and    make\r\n\r\nrecommendations,  I think it will  all  be  to  the\r\n\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in many respects, we agree with the aims of\r\n\r\nthe   Government - for  example,  education   towards\r\n\r\ncommon identity and loyalty. The Government want to\r\n\r\npromote  a common national language which  children\r\n\r\nwill learn and understand with respect and love for\r\n\r\none another and with a common identity and loyalty.\r\n\r\nThat   is  in  the  Sixth  Anniversary  Celebration\r\n\r\nSouvenir 1960 magazine of the P.A.P. However,  Sir,\r\n\r\nI  have  once stated before and I reaffirm that  my\r\n\r\nconviction is that, although a national language as\r\n\r\na  common  language  is highly desirable  and  very\r\n\r\nimportant  to facilitate communication of thoughts,\r\n\r\nit  will  not necessarily promote unity and harmony\r\n\r\nas  we  have seen in this very Chamber where people\r\n\r\nspeaking  the  same language can get  rattled.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, in the international sphere, we have  Red\r\n\r\nChina  and Formosa practically at war although  the\r\n\r\npeople  in both places speak the same language.  In\r\n\r\nthe  history  of America, the British and  American\r\n\r\ncolonialists  were at war although they  spoke  the\r\n\r\nsame  language. Perhaps the Commission  of  inquiry\r\n\r\ncould  go  further and find out how the  Government\r\n\r\ncould  supplement the policy of one common national\r\n\r\nlanguage  with other means to deve1op a  spirit  of\r\n\r\ntolerance,  goodwill  and  harmony  so  that  while\r\n\r\nspeaking the same language they can also be on good\r\n\r\nterms with one another. I am sure that although  we\r\n\r\ncan  disagree, yet we need have no ill-will towards\r\n\r\none another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second objective of the Government is stated\r\n\r\nas  education  with  common content,  and  that  is\r\n\r\ninterpreted as the preparation of common syllabuses\r\n\r\nfor  all  the schools in the different media.  Sir,\r\n\r\none   question  that  could  be  referred  to   the\r\n\r\nCommission is whether this policy should be rigidly\r\n\r\nadhered  to.  There  is  a danger  that  if  common\r\n\r\nsyllabuses are rigidly drawn up for schools\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  different  media,  then  we  will  produce\r\n\r\ncitizens with a one-track mind. Perhaps there could\r\n\r\nbe room for diversity so that, with the approval of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry,  if schools like to diversify  their\r\n\r\nsyllabuses and depart from those laid down  and  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  nothing subversive they may do  so.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  could perhaps agree to  the  Commission\r\n\r\ngoing into this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is again the abolition of inter-school\r\n\r\nsports.  While  we are in favour of  inter-district\r\n\r\nsports,  the  feeling among the school children  is\r\n\r\nthat  the abolition of inter-school sports deprives\r\n\r\nthem   of  the  development  of  loyalty  to  their\r\n\r\nschools. The result has been that very poor  crowds\r\n\r\ngo  to these inter-district sports, whereas when it\r\n\r\ncomes to inter-school sports, arrangements are made\r\n\r\nso  that  Chinese, English, Malay and Tamil  medium\r\n\r\nschools  can  all participate because children  are\r\n\r\nsuch  that  their  loyalty  to  their  schools   is\r\n\r\nstronger  than  their loyalty to  their  districts.\r\n\r\nAfter  all, what is a district to them?  A  country\r\n\r\nyes, but when children come from different parts of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  a  secondary  school,  it  is   very\r\n\r\ndifficult to develop loyalty to a district.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Government-aided schools and\r\n\r\ntheir future, there is a danger that the Government\r\n\r\nis  inclined to promote State schools as a sort  of\r\n\r\n\"their\"  schools. The Government might forget  that\r\n\r\nthere must be free competition even in the field of\r\n\r\neducation, otherwise qualities and standards  might\r\n\r\nsuffer.  In  the  interest of the  welfare  of  the\r\n\r\nchildren  and  in  order that  the  wishes  of  the\r\n\r\nparents might be complied with, I should think that\r\n\r\nevery  encouragement should be given  so  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment-aided  schools would  be  allowed  every\r\n\r\nchance  to  grow  and make good  progress.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,   there  are  more  and  more  difficulties\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Government imposes  almost  the  same\r\n\r\nconditions on aided schools and yet when  it  comes\r\n\r\nto  buildings, they are asked to provide  half  the\r\n\r\ncost.  It  is very difficult to approach people  to\r\n\r\nprovide  half  the cost of the buildings  when  the\r\n\r\nrules  are  so rigid that it is the same whether  a\r\n\r\nboy goes to a Government school or to an aided\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschool.  I  think in the case of the aided  schools\r\n\r\nthere should be more leeway in regard to curriculum\r\n\r\nand  other activities, so long as the standards are\r\n\r\nmaintained  and  there  is no  subversive  activity\r\n\r\ngoing on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, then comes the question of private schools.\r\n\r\nIs  there not room for good private schools in this\r\n\r\ncountry?  The demand for education in this  country\r\n\r\nis  so  great that I think it is even greater  than\r\n\r\nthat in Western countries. We Asians almost worship\r\n\r\neducation.  Parents who have grown-up children  who\r\n\r\nshould be employed still want their children to  go\r\n\r\nto  school  if they are not employed.  So  we  have\r\n\r\nthese young people, who are 18 or 19 years old, who\r\n\r\nstill  want  to  go  for  education,  in  secondary\r\n\r\nschools  or  high schools although they  should  be\r\n\r\nworking.  And  the  parents' complaint  is,  \"Well,\r\n\r\nsince they cannot get employment and the Government\r\n\r\nprovides only evening schools, what are they  going\r\n\r\nto  do in the day time?\" They prefer these children\r\n\r\nto  go  to day schools until such time as there  is\r\n\r\nfull  employment. If these parents want their  sons\r\n\r\nand  daughters  to  continue  in  high  schools  or\r\n\r\nsecondary schools and the Government finds  it  too\r\n\r\ndifficult  or  expensive to have more secondary  or\r\n\r\nhigh schools, perhaps good private schools could be\r\n\r\nencouraged. We find that in the Philippines they do\r\n\r\nthat,  and standards can be maintained by a  common\r\n\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of the full six-day week will\r\n\r\nbe.  I  think, considered by this Commission and  I\r\n\r\nhope  that  opportunity will be  given  to  parents,\r\n\r\nteachers,  unions, and others interested to  submit\r\n\r\ntheir views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing missing in our educational\r\n\r\npolicy, and that is that we assume that in a multi-racial  and multi-lingual society, people  speaking\r\n\r\none language can come together easily. Sir, we find\r\n\r\neven  in  this  Chamber it is not so  easy  to  get\r\n\r\npeople  to  reach agreement. I think democracy  can\r\n\r\nonly  work  if we have the development of qualities\r\n\r\nof character such as tolerance, goodwill,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintegrity, charity, and the spirit of service,  all\r\n\r\nof  which are very important. Because many  schools\r\n\r\nare  keen to compete in school examinations and get\r\n\r\ngood  results, the education system tends  to  fill\r\n\r\nthe  minds  with  just intellectual  facts  without\r\n\r\neffecting  any  change in a person's character,  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  produce  not good citizens  but  educated\r\n\r\nrascals.  In the interest of this country  and  for\r\n\r\nthe  future  of  this country, I do hope  that  the\r\n\r\nCommission appointed will go into this, matter  as\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am in full\r\n\r\nsupport  of having such a Commission of Inquiry  to\r\n\r\nlook  into  the education policy of the Government.\r\n\r\nBut  this Commission of Inquiry should not  indulge\r\n\r\nin politics. It should be concerned purely with the\r\n\r\neducation  policy of the Government.  Because  this\r\n\r\n.policy  has many shortcomings, it has led to  many\r\n\r\ndifficulties  and  confusion at  the  moment.  This\r\n\r\nconfusion   has  been  created  by  the  Government\r\n\r\nitself.  For  example,  the  4:2  system.  If   the\r\n\r\nGovernment could have postponed the holding of  the\r\n\r\npublic Secondary IV Examination for one year,  then\r\n\r\nthere  would not have been such trouble  and  there\r\n\r\nwould  not have been any boycott of the examination\r\n\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are several\r\n\r\nmatters  worth investigating in this Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry. First, we should look into the past as  to\r\n\r\nwhether the Government have assisted the Government-aided  schools in respect of their development  and\r\n\r\nprogress, because we know that many of the  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools  are aided by the Government. Many  of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish schools are Government schools. The private\r\n\r\naided  schools  are meant to help  the  Government.\r\n\r\nThis  is, correct, and the Government should  make\r\n\r\nuse of public funds to assist the aided schools. In\r\n\r\nthe  same way, private' individuals are helping the\r\n\r\nGovernment to develop and bring advancement to  our\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point concerns teachers. In many aided\r\n\r\nschools teachers who have reached retiring age  are\r\n\r\nnot  well  taken care of, especially in  regard  to\r\n\r\ntheir after-care, so that in their retirement these\r\n\r\nteachers are more or less unemployed. So they  have\r\n\r\nfinancial problems in their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point concerns the future of students.\r\n\r\nWe  know  that of the students who have passed  the\r\n\r\nSecondary  IV  public examination  and  the  Senior\r\n\r\nMiddle  III examination, some are still unemployed.\r\n\r\nAlso   some  who  have  passed  the  Secondary   IV\r\n\r\nexamination  are  not given  a  chance  to  go  for\r\n\r\nfurther studies. So how are we going to think about\r\n\r\ntheir future? We know that this year the Government\r\n\r\ndoes  not  seem to want these graduates  to  become\r\n\r\ntemporary teachers. It seems that it wants to  wait\r\n\r\nfor  the  result of the examination  `before  those\r\n\r\nstudents  who  have  sat for  the  examination  can\r\n\r\nbecome teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point concerns Nanyang University. We\r\n\r\nall know that the Minister in the forum convened by\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce answered\r\n\r\nquestions  in  regard to Nanyang  University.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  said  that after merger he could  request\r\n\r\nthe  Government of the Federation to recognise  the\r\n\r\ndegrees  of  the Nanyang graduates. I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Singapore Government, which  has  not\r\n\r\nofficially   recognised  the  degrees  of   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  graduates, can ask  the  Federation  to\r\n\r\nrecognise such degrees `before it does so. How  can\r\n\r\nthe  Government  do  such a  thing?  In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  itself  should take the  initiative  to\r\n\r\nrecognise Nanyang University degrees before it  can\r\n\r\nexpect others to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I want to raise is that we are in\r\n\r\ndoubt  whether the Government wishes to change  all\r\n\r\nthe schools on the lines of English schools. I hope\r\n\r\nthis  point  can  be looked into  as  well  in  the\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, at\r\n\r\nthe  last sitting in December, to be exact, on 21st\r\n\r\nDecember,   1961.  I  had  occasion   to   make   a\r\n\r\nMinisterial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatement  to  indicate  that  the  Government  was\r\n\r\nprepared  to  appoint a Commission  of  Inquiry  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  the spirit of the  motion  before\r\n\r\nthis  House. Mainly to spare Members of the  House,\r\n\r\nboth  on  the Government side and on the Opposition\r\n\r\nside  after a marathon session, I agreed to make  a\r\n\r\nstatement at the request of the Member for Anson so\r\n\r\nas  to cut short the debate on the motion. In fact,\r\n\r\nhe had proposed an extension to his original motion\r\n\r\nto  include  the six-day week, and added  political\r\n\r\nactivities   and   machinations  in   primary   and\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools to the extent thereof,  and  the\r\n\r\npersons  and  organisations  responsible  therefor.\r\n\r\nThis  extension of the terms of reference  for  the\r\n\r\nCommission   of  Inquiry  was  also   accepted   by\r\n\r\nGovernment. So since there is to be a Commission of\r\n\r\nInquiry into not only the educational policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment but also the six-day week, it  would  be\r\n\r\nhighly improper for my Ministry to proceed with any\r\n\r\namendments to the six-day week if the Commission of\r\n\r\nInquiry is to inquire into the six-day week. So  in\r\n\r\nmy  statement  I  did  specifically  mention  that,\r\n\r\narising  out  of the decision of the Government  to\r\n\r\nhave  this Commission of Inquiry, the intention  to\r\n\r\nbring  about a revised version of the six-day  week\r\n\r\nfor  1962 for primary schools would have to be cold\r\n\r\nstoraged.  After I made that statement, Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Member for Anson was gleeful  and\r\n\r\nhappy  and volunteered to withdraw the motion.  The\r\n\r\nSpeaker then told him that he could do so under the\r\n\r\nordinary  rules  of the House. Then  comes  another\r\n\r\nletter from the Member for Anson to tell me  a  few\r\n\r\nother  things.  Well,  I  have  already  given   an\r\n\r\nassurance  that  a Commission of  Inquiry  will  be\r\n\r\nappointed.  But if the Member for Anson  thinks  he\r\n\r\ncan  write letters to me telling me to do this  and\r\n\r\nthat  before he withdraws the motion, if he  is  to\r\n\r\nappear  like a weather cock which twists and  turns\r\n\r\nat  every puff of the wind, I must tell him that he\r\n\r\nis taking things too much for granted. I can assure\r\n\r\nhim  that  the proposed Commission of Inquiry  into\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexamination   boycott   could   include   political\r\n\r\nactivities   and   machinations  in   primary   and\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools.  This  proposed  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  would  be   headed by a High  Court  Judge.\r\n\r\nThere  would be a second Commission of  inquiry  to\r\n\r\nlook  into  the  educational policy other  than  on\r\n\r\nvocational  and technical education,  because  that\r\n\r\nhas  already received the attention of a Commission\r\n\r\nof  Inquiry.  I  do not think I need  make  further\r\n\r\nassurances whether that Commission of Inquiry is to\r\n\r\nhe  formed.  It will be formed at a time  when  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  been able to find the  members  to\r\n\r\nform this Commission of Inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recall, Sir, that on 21st December.\r\n\r\n1961, the Member for Anson asked for one Commission\r\n\r\nof Inquiry to bring everything in, and I said, \"No,\r\n\r\nthere  should  be  two Commissions to  go  into  the\r\n\r\nissues  apart.\" I think the Member  for  Anson  now\r\n\r\naccepts that. That is what the Government will do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various points mentioned by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin. I disagree with him when he says that\r\n\r\nit  is  not enough just to have a national language\r\n\r\nto  bring about unity, but that it is necessary  to\r\n\r\nhave  other  languages  as  well.  I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nessential, if there is to be nation building  in  a\r\n\r\nmuti-racial  society,  that the  national  language\r\n\r\nmust be the language to bind all the people of this\r\n\r\ncountry. It is along this line that the question of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaysia is proceeding  - that the\r\n\r\nnational  language would be Malay for the  proposed\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin next touched upon the fact\r\n\r\nthat  a common content in syllabuses might tend  to\r\n\r\nsome  form of regimentation. The tragedy has always\r\n\r\nbeen  that there has been no common content in  our\r\n\r\nschools,  thereby resulting in different  standards\r\n\r\nand  different ways of thinking. So  not  only  are\r\n\r\nsyllabuses  to  be  of a similar  content,  but  we\r\n\r\nshould also have a common loyalty, and that  is  to\r\n\r\nhave  syllabuses Malayanised. That  work  has  been\r\n\r\nachieved within the first two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears  of office of the present Government  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education. I disagree with him when  he\r\n\r\nsays  that the abolition of the inter-school sports\r\n\r\nin  favour of inter-district sports has not brought\r\n\r\nabout  a large response from students because  they\r\n\r\ntend  to have greater loyalty for schools than they\r\n\r\nhave for districts. The reason for abolishing inter-school  sports and substituting in its stead inter-district  sports  was  purely  to  break  down  the\r\n\r\ncommunal  barriers  so  long  as  we  have  English\r\n\r\nschools,  Chinese schools, Malay schools and  Tamil\r\n\r\nschools.  But with the creation of more  integrated\r\n\r\nschools - by  that  we mean more than  one  language\r\n\r\nmedium     of    instruction    in    one    school\r\n\r\nbuilding - perhaps the time would come when we  could\r\n\r\ncome back to inter-school sports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin then raised the perennial\r\n\r\nquestion of aided schools to allow for competition.\r\n\r\nIt has never been denied that there is value in the\r\n\r\neducational  system of Singapore for the  existence\r\n\r\nof  aided  schools.  In fact, in  the  past,  aided\r\n\r\nschools  have  played  a great  part  in  providing\r\n\r\neducation for the children of Singapore.  But  that\r\n\r\nwas  the  distant past when the colonial Government\r\n\r\nfailed  to  shoulder their full responsibility  for\r\n\r\nthe  education of all its children. It is. I think,\r\n\r\nelementary  knowledge  that an  elected  government\r\n\r\nmust be prepared to shoulder the responsibility  of\r\n\r\neducating  all its children. Therefore, whether  we\r\n\r\nlike  it  or  not, it is the responsibility  of  an\r\n\r\nelected  government to build more and more  schools\r\n\r\nand to provide facilities for education so that the\r\n\r\ntime  will come when the majority of children  will\r\n\r\nreceive their education in Government schools,  but\r\n\r\nthose  wishing  to  send their  children  to  aided\r\n\r\nschools may do so. It is a question of free  choice\r\n\r\nin  as  much  as parents are allowed to choose  the\r\n\r\nlanguage  medium of instruction for their  children\r\n\r\nevery  year  when children of six  or  seven  enter\r\n\r\nschool for the first time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Tanglin\r\n\r\nnext   raised  the  role  of  private  schools   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Here again, the Ministry has not  placed\r\n\r\nanything in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nway   of  private  schools  opening  and  providing\r\n\r\neducation if people do join such schools. But it is\r\n\r\nstill  the responsibility of the Ministry to ensure\r\n\r\nthat private schools do charge reasonable fees  and\r\n\r\nnot  exorbitant fees; that the teachers they employ\r\n\r\nare  qualified  for their task, and  that  they  do\r\n\r\nnot - as many do - give the students a certain type  of\r\n\r\neducation  which does not really prepare  them  for\r\n\r\nrecognised   examinations.  To  take  an   example,\r\n\r\nprivate   schools   might  train   their   students\r\n\r\nespecially  those who have failed in their  primary\r\n\r\nschool  leaving  examinations, and  allow  them  to\r\n\r\nproceed  to secondary classes, but they stop  short\r\n\r\nat  Secondary III level and not Secondary IV level,\r\n\r\nwhen  if they were in English private schools, they\r\n\r\nshould   be  prepared  for  the  Cambridge   School\r\n\r\nCertificate  examination. It  just  shows  this.  I\r\n\r\nthink  they  know quite well that the students  who\r\n\r\nattend  their classes might fail miserably if  they\r\n\r\ndo  take the Senior Cambridge examination. That  is\r\n\r\nthe  thing we want to stop. If private schools  are\r\n\r\ngenuine  in  their  desire to coach  people  for  a\r\n\r\nrecognised  examination and get  them  through  the\r\n\r\nclasses  satisfactorily from Secondary I, II,  III,\r\n\r\nand  IV, we have no objections at all. But  I  must\r\n\r\nsay  that the Adult Education Board, that  is,  the\r\n\r\nLembaga   Gerakan  Pelajaran  Dewasa,   is   making\r\n\r\nstrenuous  efforts  to provide secondary  education\r\n\r\nfor adults, so much so that more than 5,000 are now\r\n\r\nattending  ten  centres for secondary  classes.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  there are more applications than  the  Adult\r\n\r\nEducation Board is able to handle. However, we feel\r\n\r\nthat  this  is  meeting a great  need  because  the\r\n\r\nMinistry's  and the Government's view  is  that  we\r\n\r\nshould not try to deprive people of the opportunity\r\n\r\nfor education, be it secondary or higher education,\r\n\r\nif  they wish to do so in the evenings to catch  up\r\n\r\non what they have missed during their younger days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be remembered, Sir, that when the\r\n\r\nUniversity  .of  Singapore  Bill  was  before  this\r\n\r\nHouse, Members of the Opposition were quite pleased\r\n\r\nwith  the  new  provisions  in  the  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore Constitution which permit the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity  to  grant external  degrees,  something\r\n\r\nwhich colonial universities were most unprepared to\r\n\r\ngive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do think that the policy which the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  has  been following is along  the  right\r\n\r\nlines   although   it  is  common  knowledge   that\r\n\r\neducation is education for the next generation.  So\r\n\r\nwhatever  we  do today we may not see  the  results\r\n\r\nnext year or a few years after. But when all of  us\r\n\r\nare perhaps no longer in this House, we are able to\r\n\r\nreflect on past history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin touched upon the six-day\r\n\r\nweek, which is part of the education policy of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  will come  under  review  by  the\r\n\r\nproposed  Commission of inquiry. There is no  doubt\r\n\r\nat  all  that interested parties, be they teachers,\r\n\r\nparents  or even politicians who are interested  in\r\n\r\nthis subject, would be invited by the Commission to\r\n\r\nsubmit  their views and that would be  followed  up\r\n\r\nwith  the giving of evidence in person if it is  so\r\n\r\ndesired  by the Commission. I am wholly in  support\r\n\r\nof  the  view put forward by the Member for Tanglin\r\n\r\nwhen  he  said that it is not enough that education\r\n\r\nis  schools should be confined to school  subjects,\r\n\r\nand  that  it is very dangerous if all that  we  do\r\n\r\nproduce  in schools would be  children who  are  too\r\n\r\nexamination conscious.

In  1959, \r\n\r\n90,000  vehicles and in October 1961,  115,000  (in round numbers),\r\n\r\nan increase \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof about 23 per cent in the number of \r\n\r\nvehicles, and\r\n\r\na  fall  in consumption of petrol of about  15  per\r\n\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the reason for this fall in the\r\n\r\nconsumption of petrol? We are told, and  accurately\r\n\r\ntold,  that  there  is a switch  from  the  use  of\r\n\r\npetroleum engines to the use of diesel engines. But\r\n\r\nwhy  has this happened since 1959? You will  notice\r\n\r\nthat  petrol  tax was increased by 20 per  cent  in\r\n\r\n1959.  The petrol today costs per gallon 67  cents.\r\n\r\nThe  duty  is $1.20, which is 179 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\nsale price, bringing the price of petrol to $1.87.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in presenting these facts in statistical\r\n\r\nform,  I  do so because I have learnt the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance,  is, in fact, a statistician  and  he\r\n\r\nunderstands   statistics,   and   as   the   person\r\n\r\nresponsible  for the petrol tax, it  is  my  desire\r\n\r\nparticularly that he should understand  what  I  am\r\n\r\nseeking to explain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, the figures statistically prove that the\r\n\r\nmoment his Government increased the petrol tax from\r\n\r\n$1  to $1.20, consumption immediately began to fall\r\n\r\nby  a  switch to diesel, and therefore, it  can  be\r\n\r\nreasonably inferred that a $1 tax on petrol is  the\r\n\r\npoint of diminishing returns in economic terms. Now\r\n\r\nthat  this is made clear, Sir, I would like to draw\r\n\r\nattention to the fact that at the time of  imposing\r\n\r\nthis additional 20 cents tax, the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nreceived   from   the  Singapore   Taxi   Transport\r\n\r\nAssociation and the Singapore Hired Car Association\r\n\r\na  petition  pleading that \"the  increased  tax  of\r\n\r\npetrol has adversely affected our livelihood\",  and\r\n\r\nthe  two  Associations  asked  that  their  members\r\n\r\nshould  be  exempted inter alia from the  increased\r\n\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am in a position to table and I shall forward to your Clerk a copy of this letter*,\r\n\r\nsigned  by  the Presidents of the two Associations. As  can be expected, Mr Speaker, the letter had no effect.  The  taxi drivers did not understand  that the Minister is not interested in other than facts;\r\n\r\nhumanity has no place in his calculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* Letter  tabled by Mr Marshall on  17-1-62  and\r\n\r\ncopies circulated to Members for their information.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he has the figures, Mr Speaker, and the\r\n\r\nfigures  prove  irresistibly  that  the  20   cents\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  petrol  tax  introduced  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has,  in  fact,  been  responsible  for\r\n\r\ndiminishing  our  revenue  from  that  source.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  the  Minister  in supplying  the  figures\r\n\r\nindicates that there is an offset in respect of the\r\n\r\nincrease  in revenue from diesel engines.  That  is\r\n\r\nperfectly  correct. The position with reference  to\r\n\r\ndiesel engines, as I understand it. Mr Speaker, is\r\n\r\nnot  a  tax on the diesel oil that they use, but  a\r\n\r\nsomewhat  heavy tax on the existence of the  engine\r\n\r\nitself.  Sir,  if  a diesel engine  has  to  pay  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial tax, nevertheless\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat tax may well be worth while because diesel oil\r\n\r\nis cheap if a considerable distance is travelled in\r\n\r\nthe period of a year. But what would be the revenue\r\n\r\nto this State if, instead of using diesel oil, that\r\n\r\nconsiderable  distance  were,  in   fact,   to   be\r\n\r\ntravelled   on  petrol?  There,  Mr  Speaker,   in\r\n\r\nfairness, I must say that I am not in possession of\r\n\r\nactual  figures nor am I adequately  an  expert  to\r\n\r\nindicate  with  certainty that  there  would  be  a\r\n\r\ngreater increase in revenue than that shown by  the\r\n\r\noffset  in  diesel engines. But I  do  ask  you  to\r\n\r\nnotice  certain  very interesting particulars,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker. In 1956, the total number of vehicles  was\r\n\r\n67,000  and  the petrol consumption was28\ufffd  million\r\n\r\ngallons.  Sir, today we have 115,000 vehicles,  but\r\n\r\nthe petrol consumption is only 30\ufffd million gallons.\r\n\r\nWhen  I  say  \"today\" I am talking of \"the  end  of\r\n\r\n1961\".  Mr  Speaker, the comparative  figures  are\r\n\r\nstartling - really startling, and I would  urge  that\r\n\r\nif   the  consumption  were  to  be  maintained  in\r\n\r\nproportion  to  the rate it was  at  in  1956,  our\r\n\r\nrevenue  would be considerably greater from  petrol\r\n\r\nthan   the   small  offset,  specious  and   really\r\n\r\nmisleading,  which we find from diesel  engines.  I\r\n\r\nsay  this with some diffidence, Mr Speaker, but  I\r\n\r\ndo  generally have the impression that the increase\r\n\r\nof  20 cents in petrol tax by this Government  has,\r\n\r\nin  effect,  resulted in decreased revenue  to  the\r\n\r\nState by encouragement of the increased utilisation\r\n\r\nof  diesel engines instead of petrol engines. It is\r\n\r\nin   these  circumstances  that  I  would  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  he is considering  the  position\r\n\r\nwith  a view to easing the tax both for the benefit\r\n\r\nof  our revenue and for the benefit - if I might urge\r\n\r\nthis  on him though it may have no meaning  - of  our\r\n\r\ntaxi-drivers  and  lorry-drivers and  the  motoring\r\n\r\npublic  at  large who, it is true, are not  in  the\r\n\r\ncategory of poverty of the first two classes. But I\r\n\r\ndo  want  to emphasise this - and I speak as one  who\r\n\r\nintroduced  the  luxury tax  of  ten  per  cent  on\r\n\r\ncars - that  today  motor transport is  an  essential\r\n\r\naspect of our life. To travel by bus and taxi is no\r\n\r\nlonger  a  question of luxury. It is a question  of\r\n\r\nnecessity. We would seek to avoid imposing what may\r\n\r\namount to a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprohibitive tax on the consumption of petrol, which\r\n\r\nis  taking  advantage, perhaps unintentionally,  of\r\n\r\nthe  need of the people. If you will notice, at the\r\n\r\ntime  I increased it, I think it was from 68 to  73\r\n\r\ncents,  and  even  in  November  1956  when  I  was\r\n\r\nassociated  with the Labour Front, we increased  it\r\n\r\nto   no  more  than  80  cents,  although  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation at that time I think it was a dollar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might interest you to know the figures in\r\n\r\nother  territories. I would like to take  first  of\r\n\r\nall - as I have said, I have circulated them for the\r\n\r\nconvenience  of  Members;  figures  are   difficult\r\n\r\nthings  to  retain in one's mind unless  one  is  a\r\n\r\nstatistician - Brunei, for example, Sir, which is a\r\n\r\nhappy  country. I am taking first those territories\r\n\r\nwhich  are not only close to us but which  we  hope\r\n\r\nwill be our partners and brothers. In Brunei, there\r\n\r\nis  no  tax  at  all on petrol. In the neighbouring\r\n\r\nterritory of British North Borneo, it is 25  cents.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  that  they do not need money.  British\r\n\r\nNorth  Borneo  is  not rich.  Brunei  is,  but  not\r\n\r\nBritish  North  Borneo. In Sarawak where  money  is\r\n\r\nvery  tight - the  Government has to make  strenuous\r\n\r\neffort to get it - the petrol tax is no more than 50\r\n\r\ncents.  But let us go further afield, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,In Australia, it is 32 cents. In South Africa,\r\n\r\nI  think  it is 50 cents. In Tanganyika, it  is  32\r\n\r\ncents. In Uganda, it is 43 cents. In Kenya,  it  is\r\n\r\n53  cents. Now, Sir, I do not know whether  I  have\r\n\r\ngiven one other figure which, in fairness, I should\r\n\r\ngive  hut which I seem to have omitted from my  own\r\n\r\nlists: in India, it is $1.17 cents and in Hongkong,\r\n\r\nit  is  79 cents. Now, Sir, India comes closest  to\r\n\r\nus. I do not know why it was omitted from the list,\r\n\r\nhut  I do remember it accurately, and I ask you  to\r\n\r\nnotice,  Mr  Speaker,  that  according  to   these\r\n\r\nfigures,  Singapore  and the  Federation  have  the\r\n\r\nhighest  duty  compared to all of these  countries.\r\n\r\nNow the Federation has different financial problems\r\n\r\nto  ours -   and  very difficult problems  they  are,\r\n\r\nwhich  fortunately  do  not  apply  here,  and  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances are different here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do urge, Mr Speaker, Sir, that in the light of\r\n\r\nthese  statistics, which have highlighted the issue\r\n\r\nthat our tax in going beyond the dollar has reached\r\n\r\nthe  point  of  diminishing returns,  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwould  give consideration both for the sake of  our\r\n\r\nrevenue and for the sake of our people. It is  very\r\n\r\nrarely that one can both please the revenue and the\r\n\r\npeople  hut  in this instance I think that  miracle\r\n\r\ncan be achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must\r\n\r\ncongratulate the Member for Anson for the pains  he\r\n\r\nhas  taken in this piece of research and the  lucid\r\n\r\nmanner in which he has presented his case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I think I have no quarrel with most of his\r\n\r\narguments. I think by and large they are  valid.  I\r\n\r\nthink  he  has  not attempted to conceal  from  the\r\n\r\nHouse any facts which would prejudice his case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we are agreed on the main fact that there\r\n\r\nmay  be  differences between the figures he put  up\r\n\r\nand  the  figures I gave, but that may  be   due  to\r\n\r\ndifferences in definition. I suspect it may be  that\r\n\r\nhis   figures  of  revenue  included  the  one   on\r\n\r\nkerosene,  whereas mine did not. Where the  figures\r\n\r\nof  registered vehicles differ, the reason  may  be\r\n\r\nthat I took the figures as on 31st December of that\r\n\r\nyear,  except for 1961 when it was towards sometime\r\n\r\nin  October. There could be differences  in  dates.\r\n\r\nBut  generally I think we are agreed on the  facts.\r\n\r\nNow what conclusion do we draw from the facts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for An son drew particular attention\r\n\r\nto  the revenue position between 1959 - that was  the\r\n\r\ntime when the additional tax was imposed -  and 1960.\r\n\r\nThat  may  be a valid period for the comparison  of\r\n\r\ntax changes in response to changes in the rates  of\r\n\r\ntax.  But I would rather take a longer period.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  conclusion I would say is that if  you  take\r\n\r\nthe  year 1956 and aggregate both the tax on petrol\r\n\r\nand  the  special tax on diesel engines, you  would\r\n\r\nget a total of $22.7 million. By 1961, the total of\r\n\r\nboth the petrol and the diesel engine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntax  went  up to $41 million. The increase  in  the\r\n\r\nrevenue  earned  with regard to these  taxes  is  a\r\n\r\nshade more than the total increase in the number of\r\n\r\nvehicles  between 1956 and 1961. Between  1956  and\r\n\r\n1961, there was a 70 per cent increase in the total\r\n\r\nnumber of registered vehicles. The increase in  the\r\n\r\npetrol tax itself was of the order of 72 per  cent.\r\n\r\nAnd  if you include the tax on diesel engines, that\r\n\r\nmight bring it up well over 75 per cent. So by  and\r\n\r\nlarge,  the  yield of duty has kept pace  with  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  registered vehicles. But as the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson rightly pointed out, the consumption  of\r\n\r\npetrol  has  not.  The actual  quantity  of  petrol\r\n\r\nconsumed,  in spite of the tremendous  increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  number  of registered vehicles, has  increased\r\n\r\nonly from $28.5 million in 1956 to $30.5 million in\r\n\r\n1961.  He  said  that  if only the  consumption  of\r\n\r\npetrol  could have kept pace with the  increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  number of registered vehicles, then of  course\r\n\r\nthe  Treasury  would  have  been  overflowing  with\r\n\r\nmoney.  And  that  is  quite  true.  But  what  has\r\n\r\nhappened is this. If you will look at the third set\r\n\r\nof figures I gave - the number of registered vehicles\r\n\r\nclassified by types -  you will find that the largest\r\n\r\npercentage  increase has been in respect  of  motor\r\n\r\ncycles.  The  number  of  motor  cycles  registered\r\n\r\nbetween  1956  and  1961  has  nearly  trebled.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the term \"motor cycles\" includes  scooters\r\n\r\nand  light two-wheeled machines which consume  very\r\n\r\nlittle petrol. Therefore, whether we increase the tax on petrol or not, it is hardly possible for the\r\n\r\nquantity  of petrol consumed to increase pari  passu\r\n\r\nwith  the  number of registered vehicles for  three\r\n\r\nreasons.  First,  the number of  motor  cycles  has\r\n\r\nincreased much faster than the others. Second, even\r\n\r\nin  the case of motor cars, there has been a switch\r\n\r\nfrom  cars that consume a lot of petrol to  lighter\r\n\r\nmodels  like - I should not mention names - small  cars\r\n\r\nthat are very economical in price. Then, of course,\r\n\r\nthere  is a general technological progress  whereby\r\n\r\neven for the same make of cars, engines of improved\r\n\r\ncompression ratios\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  made,  and  generally  petrol  consumption  is\r\n\r\nlowered. Therefore, although one cannot be  certain\r\n\r\nabout this  - just as the Member for Anson said  that\r\n\r\nhe  was  not  sure that if the duty  on  petrol  is\r\n\r\nretained  at its present level the duty might  well\r\n\r\nincrease - it  could have increased or it  could  not\r\n\r\nhave increased. One does not know. My guess is that\r\n\r\nit  is  very  likely that if we had maintained  the\r\n\r\nsame rate of petrol duty all these years, one might\r\n\r\nhave  induced  an  increase in the  consumption  of\r\n\r\npetrol.  Motorists  would have driven  more  often.\r\n\r\nPossibly,  more people might have bought more  cars\r\n\r\nand  motor  cycles. But as against that, there  has\r\n\r\nbeen a switch from the larger types of cars to  the\r\n\r\nsmaller  types  of  cars and there  has  been  a  tremendous  increase in the popularity of  scooters\r\n\r\nand motor cycles. So it could well be - and in fact I\r\n\r\nam  almost  certain - that if  we  had  for  instance\r\n\r\nretained  the  duty  on  petrol  tax  at  the  rate\r\n\r\nexisting,  say in 1956, the effect would have  been\r\n\r\nthat the consumption of petrol would certainly have\r\n\r\nincreased - by what proportion one does not know. But\r\n\r\nit is doubtful whether it would have increased fast\r\n\r\nenough  to  yield  the  revenue  that  we  are  now\r\n\r\nreceiving   from  petrol  tax.  For  the  petroleum\r\n\r\nrevenue   to   remain  at  the  1961  figure,   the\r\n\r\nconsumption of petrol would practically have had to\r\n\r\ndouble  from 1956. I think that would have  been  a\r\n\r\nmost unlikely event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petroleum duty in Singapore and in the\r\n\r\nFederation is high - one of the highest in Asia.  The\r\n\r\nrate of petroleum duty in India is practically  the\r\n\r\nsame  as  ours.  My  calculations  show  that   the\r\n\r\npercentage of petroleum duty is 179.2. but we  will\r\n\r\nsay that it is the same. In Ceylon it is about 167.\r\n\r\nBut  other  than  these  two countries,  the  other\r\n\r\ncountries in Asia have much lower petroleum  duties\r\n\r\nthan ours. Japan has just over 107. Hongkong has  a\r\n\r\nduty  rate of 97 on the retail price. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  there  are other countries  which  pay  much\r\n\r\nhigher duties than we do. Of course, Australia pays\r\n\r\nmuch  less than that. It is a developed country.  I\r\n\r\ncan  of  course quote the case of France where  the\r\n\r\nrate  of duty is 287 per cent of the retail  price.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npays  less  duty  than we do. On  the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nItaly,  for instance, pays more than we do. So,  by\r\n\r\nand  large, some countries pay more and others  pay\r\n\r\nless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a moot point whether we have reached the\r\n\r\npoint  of  diminishing returns. It is  certainly  a\r\n\r\npoint  that is worth investigating. Of course,  the\r\n\r\nway to get a full and complete investigation of the\r\n\r\neffects  of tax on yield of revenue requires  quite\r\n\r\nadvanced techniques of practical analyses.  Bearing\r\n\r\nin mind that the physical consumption of petrol has\r\n\r\nnot increased in the last seven or eight years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  spite of the increase in the number of cars,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Member for Anson has a point that  both\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore and the Federation Governments might\r\n\r\nwell look into this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question having been proposed at Eight\r\n\r\no'clock  p.m.,  and  the  time  appointed  for  the\r\n\r\ntermination of the sitting (half-past Eight o'clock\r\n\r\np.m.)  having  arrived, Mr Speaker  adjourned  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  without  question put,  pursuant  to  the\r\n\r\nStanding Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">half-past Eight o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1962/19620117/19620117-HA-0160325.pdf\"\">DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES OF THE STATE OF SINGAPORE FOR 1963(Cols 0325-0326)</a><br>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
