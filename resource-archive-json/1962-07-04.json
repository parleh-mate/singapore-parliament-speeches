The attitude\r\n\r\nof his Party is vital.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nYesterday  the  P.A.P. was  a majority Government, and  abstentions  would  not\r\n\r\nmaterially affect the result. Today, the P.A.P. is a minority Government and the\r\n\r\nunited  Opposition  can repel attempts on the part of the P.A.P.  Government  to\r\n\r\ndeal  dishonestly  with the people. Today, every abstention on  the  part  of  a\r\n\r\nMember on this side of the House is, in effect, a vote for the Government.  This\r\n\r\nmust  be recognised, Sir: that abstentions prevent the Opposition from utilising\r\n\r\nthe majority of Members which it now has.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.P.A., when it first entered this Chamber in 1959, was a subject of\r\n\r\nP.A.P.     Government's bullying and crudities. We have now  come  full  circle.\r\n\r\nToday  they are the arbiters of the fate of the P.A.P. Government. Knowing  that\r\n\r\nthis minority Government can only act with the support of the S.P.A., where  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. acts  dishonestly or in fraud of the people, the S.P.A. must  take  the\r\n\r\nblame.  The  S.P.A. must carry the odium though it does not enjoy  the  fruits,\r\n\r\nbecause it is now a fact that the assistance of the S.P.A., tacit or active, is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the P.A.P. to perpetrate the threatened perfidy of  a  dishonest\r\n\r\nreferendum upon our people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not urging the S.P.A. to overthrow the P.A.P. Government. All I am\r\n\r\nsuggesting at this juncture is that they should be conscious, as the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are conscious, that as from today they have the power to  resist  and\r\n\r\nprevent  dishonest conduct on the part of the P.A.P. Government. If it  abstains\r\n\r\nfrom  the  exercise of this right, it must carry the same odium  as  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment with whose existence it is now fully associated.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I want to remind you of the brave words of the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill in the Select Committee less than three weeks ago. If you will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ngood  enough to look at col. 332 of the 15th of May, there is a paragraph.  This\r\n\r\nis what the Member for Cairnhill said:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'if the answer required in the referendum is just a yes or a no and the voter\r\n\r\nrefuses to give a straightforward answer where he is given a choice of accepting\r\n\r\nor  rejecting,  then  there  may be some ground for saying  that  silence  means\r\n\r\nconsent. But where a voter is asked [and you will notice, Sir, it is where there\r\n\r\nis  a  yes or a no] to choose two or three things which he may not like and  for\r\n\r\nwhich  he  may have great revulsion, surely he should have the right to  express\r\n\r\nhis disgust by not voting at all.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Chairman, then if you will look at column 376 the following day - only  one\r\n\r\nmore  paragraph, Sir, It is not my purpose to seek to embarrass but  rather,  if\r\n\r\npossible, to clarify. It is the final paragraph. Again the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now to unmarked votes, votes are unmarked to indicate the strong\r\n\r\nfeeling  of the voters. In the referendum that is to come, a voter might  be  so\r\n\r\nfed  up  with the manner in which the questions are posed that the onlv  way  he\r\n\r\nfeels  he can show his intense disgust is to cast a blank vote; otherwise if  he\r\n\r\nhas  views of his own, he will know what to do with it. But in order to show his\r\n\r\ndisgust,  he  puts  in a blank vote. So a voter who shows his disgust  with  the\r\n\r\nmanipulations\r\n\r\nof  the Government is to be treated like a man who is very friendly towards the\r\n\r\nGovernment.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>You will notice particularly, Sir, the\r\n\r\nwords there used:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...a voter might be so fed up with the manner in which the questions are posed....\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>The Member for Cairnhill had in mind\r\n\r\nthat  there  might  be  several  questions,  and  yet  he  says  there  is  this\r\n\r\npossibility. He says quite truthfully, Sir, that this provision of clause 29  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  provision to assist confused people, but is a provision to  transform  a\r\n\r\n\"no\"  into  a  \"yes\". He tells you that people, who cast blank votes  after  the\r\n\r\nmatter has been fully\r\n\r\ndebated, cast those blank votes out of disgust. That means they do not want any\r\n\r\nof  the  alternatives. Yet by a legal fraud their disgust  is  transformed  into\r\n\r\npartisanship for the Government proposal. They say no in fact, and the law says,\r\n\r\n\"You shall be deemed to say yes.\" A man is physically a man, but the P.A.P. law\r\n\r\nsays  you are a woman or an animal. In this case, the P.A.P. makes us  animals\r\n\r\naccording to their own image - gadarene swine.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally at column 385 on the same day, the Opposition had the pleasure,\r\n\r\non  calling  for a division, to have the Member for Cairnhill stand shoulder  to\r\n\r\nshoulder  with  us  in a vote of five on the Government side  and  four  on  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  side, the Barisan Sosialis, the S.P.A., the U.P.P. and the  Workers'\r\n\r\nParty.  As  I  pointed out, the Member for Cairnhill had fully in mind  the  possibility  that  there might be more than one question. He knows,  as  every  reasonable  man knows, however many the questions, there are some who may not  find\r\n\r\nany  of  them acceptable. Sir, speaking purely on principle, it is a  matter  of\r\n\r\nelementary  decency that in a referendum which is intended to seek to  ascertain\r\n\r\nthe wishes of the people, they should be entitled to say \"yes\", to say \"no\",  or\r\n\r\nto  say,  \"We  do not care.\" Sir, if the Government really want  those  who  are\r\n\r\nconfused  to be assisted, let them put in a clause: \"Do you want the  Government\r\n\r\nto  decide for you?\" By all means. We will go to great lengths on the Opposition\r\n\r\nside  in  this tragic farce which the PAP, is seeking to perpetrate  on  a  very\r\n\r\ndecent people.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill voted for us in Select Committee, and even in this\r\n\r\nAssembly he has uttered war-like noises towards the Government Front Bench.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill  knows that the attitude of the S.P.A.,  through  him  in\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee towards the Referendum Bill, has attracted considerable credit\r\n\r\nfor  his  Party  and,  in  fact, their image both as to his  activities  on  the\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill in Select Committee and in other matters over the past 12 months\r\n\r\nhas  improved  to  a  remarkable extent as a result of their strong  anti-P.A.P.\r\n\r\nstand.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learned Member for Farrer Park, Sir, would have been both surprised and\r\n\r\ndelighted had he been present at a mass rally but ten days ago, when I think  it\r\n\r\nwas  the Secretary-General of the S.P.A. who stood on the same platform  as  the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party, the Barisan, the Party Rakyat and the Liberal Socialists -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I  remember vividly when he said, \"The S.P.A. is not as  dirty  as\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.\"  He had the loudest ovation that I have heard in  a  long  time,\r\n\r\nSir.  That  seemed to attract the sense of humour and enjoyment of the  crowd\r\n\r\nthere, that phrase - \"The S.P.A. is not as dirty as the P.A.P.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if I may able to go on, Sir. Today the Singapore People's Alliance\r\n\r\nseeks  to maintain the public image it has earned over the last 12 months  by\r\n\r\nits  warlike  noises  in  the Assembly, with more warlike  noises  which  are\r\n\r\ndivorced from deeds. They brandish their verbal asides at the Government  and\r\n\r\nthen  vote for the very proposals they condemn. Because, Sir, I repeat,  that\r\n\r\nin  the  context of today, to abstain from voting on the Opposition side  is,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  to vote for the Government because it allows them then  to  escape\r\n\r\nthe  majority  verdict which we can bring to bear. Sir, with the  resignation\r\n\r\nfrom  the  P.A.P. of the Member for Bras Basah, each abstention is  of  vital\r\n\r\nimportance to enable the Government to maintain its voting\r\n\r\nsuperiority.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just as the Member for Cairnhill was unequivocal in Select Committee\r\n\r\nin his contempt for clauses 28 and 29 - and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nseemingly, Sir, in this very Assembly - so his colleague, the learned Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park, seemed friendly to this clause although neither of them is going to\r\n\r\nvote against or for it. The learned Member for Farrer Park inter alia asks,  \"If\r\n\r\nall  the possible alternatives are put, what objection is there to this clause?\"\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, I would refer to a statement made by the Prime Minister in a radio\r\n\r\nforum  on  the 12th of June, 1962, which was broadcast on the 14th of June.  You\r\n\r\nwill  find it in page 3 of the official manuscript, it is a very short  sentence\r\n\r\nand this is what the Prime Minister said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If you ask 624,000 voters, each man to write down what he wants you might well\r\n\r\nget 624,000 different answers.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the answer to the Member for Farrer Park is to have two or three\r\n\r\nalternatives  to  the merger proposals. According to the Prime Minister,  it  is\r\n\r\ncertainly not to exhaust all the possible alternatives. Sir, he knows  in  truth\r\n\r\nand in fact that the one acceptable alternative to the Opposition will never  be\r\n\r\nput. We will come to that at a later stage.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the learned Member for Farrer Park is impressed by precedents, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to draw his attention to Annexure II sent us by the  Clerk  of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly  with reference to the voting in South  Australia  on  the\r\n\r\nsubject of closing hours for bars. We have gone down to this in order to find  a\r\n\r\nparallel for what the Government seeks. But this is one instance which  I  could\r\n\r\ntrace where the ballot paper did try to exhaust all reasonable proposals and the\r\n\r\nquestion submitted to the people if you will remember, Sir, was that the closing\r\n\r\nhours  for bar rooms supplying intoxicating liquor, should he (a) 6 p.m., (b)  7\r\n\r\np.m., (c) 8 p.m., (d) 9 p.m., (e) 10 p.m., and (f) 11 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even here in answer to the Member for Farrer Park where all the possible\r\n\r\nreasonable alternatives seem to have been exhausted, unmarked ballot papers were\r\n\r\ntreated in accordance with the requirements of the Electorate Act. 1908 to 1913;\r\n\r\nthey were declared void. I would urge the learned Member for Farrer Park and his\r\n\r\nParty to consider\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nthe  validity  of the statement made in Select Committee by his  colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill, whether a blank paper cast on questions which  have  been\r\n\r\nfully  debated  and  fully made known is in fact an indication  that  the  voter\r\n\r\nrejects  and is disgusted with the alternatives offered. I would urge that  they\r\n\r\nrecognise  that clause 29 seeks to transform what is in effect a  negative  vote\r\n\r\ninto  a  positive vote for the Government. Sir, it is axiomatic that one  cannot\r\n\r\nplay  with  filth without getting dirty. Our people are not stupid.  To  imitate\r\n\r\nFalstaff and to shout to the bushes that they are looking for wars does not make\r\n\r\nthem  a  responsible Party if simultaneously they go into the  shadow  of  those\r\n\r\nbushes  and  make questionable agreements to keep the P.A.P. in  office  and  to\r\n\r\nsupport  the P.A.P. in the very measures which they publicly condemn. To  permit\r\n\r\nthe  deed to belie the word is not only contrary to good sense; it is,  I  would\r\n\r\nrespectfully  suggest,  bad  politics - though I do  not  speak  as  a  successful\r\n\r\npolitician.  I  do  plead in all earnestness to the Singapore People's  Alliance\r\n\r\nthat  at least in the patently foul clauses which are before us - clauses  28  and\r\n\r\n29 - which  go  against  the grain of every decent instinct  at  least,  in  those\r\n\r\nclauses, they should vote against the Government.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today is indeed a refreshing change. For the past five days,\r\n\r\nwe  have  seen  the P.A.P. and ex-P.A.P. hammer it out without any  letup.  This\r\n\r\nafternoon  the debate begins with the ex-Labour Front fighting in this Assembly.\r\n\r\nBut  there is one tribute I would like to pay, which the Barisan at least should\r\n\r\ncopy.  The  words  of the Member for Anson levelled at me are words  given  with\r\n\r\nproper dignity and proper observation of parliamentary practice and, for  that,\r\n\r\nI thank him. It shall be my duty to reply to him in similar vein.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Anson will remember that at the start of this debate, I\r\n\r\ndid tell him - we are friends though we may be in different political Parties \r\n\r\n- that the S.P.A. will abstain on the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore the defection of one P.A.P. Member last night had nothing to  do  with\r\n\r\nthe  stand of the S.P.A. and the S.P.A. is responsible enough not to change  its\r\n\r\nstand  now  although  knowing that the P.A.P. is dead. We have  said  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is dead. We are just waiting for the day of the funeral. But it shall  be\r\n\r\nthe  S.P.A. which shall declare the day of the funeral and not other Parties  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition. We are conscious of the grave responsibility that has now  been\r\n\r\nthrust upon us by this defection. But in consideration of that consciousness, we\r\n\r\nare  and  we  will always be guided first and foremost by the interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. For all that the S.P.A. cares, the P.A.P. can  be  dead.\r\n\r\nburied and forgotten, and for all the S.P.A. cares too, if it means the death of\r\n\r\nthe  S.P.A., let it be; the people must survive. The interests of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore must receive primary consideration.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson yesterday did say - and he said it again today - that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a volte face. The hon. Member read out with punch and vigour extracts\r\n\r\nof  my speech against the Government Members in Select Committee. But may I  ask\r\n\r\nhim  to try and recollect that the attack was based on the then intention of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to pose two questions? The alternative to the White Paper  proposals\r\n\r\nis something which no man in his senses would vote for and therefore I described\r\n\r\nthe  attempt to pose the two questions as a dishonest attempt. I even  went  to\r\n\r\nthe  extent  of saying that it was a fraudulent attempt. Therefore, I  was  most\r\n\r\nbitter in my criticism against the Government.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, other Opposition Members did also criticise in no uncertain terms clause\r\n\r\n29,  but  I  would  not  like  to say that it was  due  to  the  consistent  and\r\n\r\nresponsible   opposition  of  a  responsible  Party - the   S.P.A. - that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  now awakened to a realisation that any attempt  to  impose  the\r\n\r\nfraudulent questions on the electorate would make short shrift of the Government\r\n\r\nand  the  Party. And so they said in this Assembly that the questions  would  be\r\n\r\ndebated and settled by the Assembly after a\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nfull, frank and lengthy debate, and they also went to the extent of assuring the\r\n\r\nHouse that the Referendum Bill, when it becomes law, would only be used once and\r\n\r\nthat  as  soon  as  the referendum on merger was over, the  Ordinance  would  be\r\n\r\nrepealed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government have tried to find ways and means to remove the strong\r\n\r\nopposition  that  has  been levelled against them on clause  29.  Sir,  we  were\r\n\r\npleased  to  find  that  the Government have now changed  their  stand  on  this\r\n\r\nparticular  subject  which  is a matter of grave importance  to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We  felt that the very strong objections made by me  in  Select  Committee  were  met  up  to a point, and we maintained that  any  attempt  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to use blank votes and uncertain votes as votes meant for Cmd.  Paper\r\n\r\n33 was undemocratic; we feel it is still undemocratic. It is wrong to want to do\r\n\r\nsomething  which is not properly and openly democratic. But, Sir, the Government\r\n\r\ngave  us  a reason, and as a responsible Opposition we must give full weight  to\r\n\r\nthe  reason.  The  Government  say that unless  we  have  this  clause  in, the\r\n\r\nCommunists  will  be  up to tricks. The Communists do not want  merger  and  any\r\n\r\nopportunity given to them to prevent merger should be denied, and clause 29  is\r\n\r\nan  attempt on the part of the Government to deny the Communists the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  wreck  merger and thereby bring misery to the people of Singapore.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhat they think is the right way to fight the communists. We, the S.P.A., have a\r\n\r\ndifferent view. We say that if the Communist threat is genuine and is  as  grave\r\n\r\nas the Government imagine, there is only one answer.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What is that?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Put them where they cannot give trouble. Of course, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government think that will not help. Well, in a democracy one is entitled\r\n\r\nto one's view. I still maintain that the right way is this: if you have\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\na  toothache, pull out the offending tooth. But the P.A.P. say: if  you  have  a\r\n\r\ntoothache,  leave  the offending tooth in; let us try and find some  legislation\r\n\r\nwhereby  we  can  make a toothache no longer a toothache. That is  the  P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nview.  They are entitled to have their fun if they want fun. They are,  as  they\r\n\r\nclaim  to  be,  fighting in the interests of the country against  the  Communist\r\n\r\nthreat.  Sir, as a responsible political Party, and myself as one  who  has  had\r\n\r\nmany occasions in the past to meet and counter this Communist threat, I find  it\r\n\r\nwould  not be in keeping with our responsibility if we were to make the  job  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government more difficult. It would be more difficult if we  were  just  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  taking the same line as we took in Select Committee in  spite  of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the Government have changed their ways and are trying to mend  their\r\n\r\nways.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel that it is wrong of the Government to try to meet the Communist threat\r\n\r\nby  clause 29. But because the interests of the country demand that it should be\r\n\r\nlooked  after  by  the  government of the day, we  are  prepared  to  allow  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to have the chance to play the game, the game that they want to play\r\n\r\nwith  the Communists. And therefore we abstain. We do not feel strongly  against\r\n\r\nor for, especially as the reasons for objection have been removed. But we cannot\r\n\r\nvote with the Government on clause 29 because we say that that is the wrong  way\r\n\r\nto  meet the Communists. Because we do not agree with them that the way to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  Communist  threat  is  to  have  a cat-and-mouse  game, therefore  we  are\r\n\r\nabstaining.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson hopes that the S.P.A. will seek to maintain the\r\n\r\npublic  image  of  a warlike attitude towards the P.A.P. Sir,  the  S.P.A. will\r\n\r\nalways  be  conscious of its duty and responsibility in maintaining  the  public\r\n\r\nimage  of  a responsible political Party which is not prepared to work with  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  to  wreck  merger, not prepared to work with a dead-  government  to\r\n\r\nperpetrate any acts that are inimical to the interests of the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nBut so long as the Government wake up and realise that they have many sins which\r\n\r\nthey have to purge if they want to remain in office, and so long as they make an\r\n\r\nhonest  effort to atone for their sins, the S.P.A. will not be a Party  fighting\r\n\r\nshoulder to shoulder with the Communists to wreck the interests of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We  feel  no pride, no pleasure whatsoever in fighting  shoulder  to\r\n\r\nshoulder  with Communist and Communist front organisations just for the pleasure\r\n\r\nof killing a Party that is already dead. The P.A.P. need not be killed any more.\r\n\r\nIt is dead.

And we admired him for that.\r\n\r\nIn the next paragraph, the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill again said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But the citizen after getting his ballot paper can still cast a blank vote to\r\n\r\nshow his intense dislike of what is going on.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Here is a hero standing up for the rights - \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Of the Barisan.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - of the voter.

Then\r\n\r\nin col. 376, somewhere between the upper third and the lower two-thirds, he said\r\n\r\nthis: \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Therefore, that \"Down with the PAP.!\" means \"Up with the P.A.P.!\"'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>by  the  way the P.A.P. wanted to turn blank votes into \"support P.A.P.\"  votes.\r\n\r\nAnd  to prove that he had been Chief Minister at one time and that he also knew\r\n\r\nsomething about the law, he said (further down in the second paragraph)  he  was\r\n\r\nquoting section 48 of the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...it is clearly stated that the legal interpretation for uncertainty is\r\n\r\nthat it is void, that which is uncertain must be void legally and morally.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such beautiful and brave words, Sir.

And:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the only way he feels he can show his intense disgust is to cast a blank\r\n\r\nvote;\r\n\r\notherwise...'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>now, these are very important words:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...otherwise if he has views of his own, he will know what to do with it. . .\r\n\r\n.

I would not say that it is possibly because  of\r\n\r\ncertain orders that the Member for Cairnhill has received. I do not know, Sir, I\r\n\r\ndo  not  have  the Special Branch at my beck and call to tap telephones, but  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  there  must  be some message gven to him. Otherwise  how  could  he  so\r\n\r\nsuddenly somersault? I never believed that he could do a thing like that, but it\r\n\r\nhas happened.

His contention is that since  the\r\n\r\nquestions are known, therefore, everything in clause 29 is acceptable.  I  might\r\n\r\nalso  mention  that  the Member for Farrer Park himself  contends  that  if  the\r\n\r\nquestions  were acceptable, then the blank paper clause would be democratic.  If\r\n\r\nyou  want to know how the blank paper clause came about, you must come  back  to\r\n\r\nthe  devilish plot of the P.A.P. to pose two unacceptable questions, knowing the\r\n\r\ngeneral  reaction to those questions would mean throwing in uncertain  or  blank\r\n\r\nvotes.  Then  and then only can you understand how this blank vote  clause  came\r\n\r\nabout.  Knowing  the  questions does not make the  blank-paper  clause  more  acceptable. Is it the contention of the Member for Cairnhill that just because  unacceptable questions are made known, therefore they can be changed to acceptable\r\n\r\nquestions?  Is  he also trying to do a turn of dialectics like the  P.A.P.,  to\r\n\r\nturn no into yes? It is the same reasoning. Sir.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park also made great play of parliamentary democracy,\r\n\r\nsaying  that it is the duty of the voter to vote. Surely a person can only  vote\r\n\r\nif  the questions are acceptable to him and the alternatives posed  to  the\r\n\r\nvoter are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nalso  acceptable. I have already quoted what the Member for Cairnhill said. Surely  they  are  not  going  back on those words. When you talk  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy, you must remember one thing. It is not the institution that fails. It\r\n\r\nis the human material that fails. I quoted the other day from the proceedings of\r\n\r\nthe London Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. There they tell us exactly why\r\n\r\nso  many  democracies in Asia have failed. They have failed because the  people\r\n\r\nwho  came to power misused and abused that power to destroy the very foundations\r\n\r\nof democracy itself. In Singapore we are faced with the same danger. Let us hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government Ministers may yet wake up in time to preserve for  us  the\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy that we all want to preserve.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhether we are democratic or undemocratic in having the provisions contained  in\r\n\r\nclauses 28 and 29 can he tested from first principles.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the principle that the people should at periodic elections elect their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives who have then the mandate to govern for a fixed number of  years\r\n\r\nin  accordance  with  their programme and policy, is generally  accepted  to  be\r\n\r\ndemocratic,  although  of  course Communist deride this  form  of  democracy  as\r\n\r\nbourgeois. Therefore, it is completely democratic for the Government within  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional process to carry out its mandate to bring about merger  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya. In doing so, we are not obliged to and need not refer  the\r\n\r\nmatter to the people. Indeed, there are no constitutional provisions for such  a\r\n\r\nreference back to the people; hence this Bill has become necessary.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government having considered the whole situation, decided that it\r\n\r\nwas  in  the  long-term interests of the people to give them an  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nexpress  their  choice of the possible practical alternatives in  the  mode  and\r\n\r\nmanner of merger, either in accordance with what has been agreed to in the White\r\n\r\nPaper, or  in  the  words of the Member for Anson \"complete  and  unconditional\r\n\r\nmerger\" on the basis of a State equal to any of the eleven States of\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe Federation. In this way, any lingering doubt there may be in the mind of any\r\n\r\nvoter as to whether he would have got something better by having complete merger\r\n\r\nwill be dispelled.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the voter when faced with his choice is unable to make up his mind, then\r\n\r\nsurely it is the duty of the Assembly to make up the mind of the voter for  him.\r\n\r\nThe  voter  has been given the right to exercise a choice between two  forms  of\r\n\r\nmerger, one propounded by the Government and supported by 33 votes  to  nil  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly,  the other propounded by the Barisan Sosialis who  talk  of  the\r\n\r\nPenang  and  Malacca type of merger, the United People's Party who talk  of  the\r\n\r\nJohore  type,  and  the Workers' Party who talk of \"complete  and  unconditional\r\n\r\nmerger\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can there be anything undemocratic about asking a citizen to indicate his\r\n\r\nchoice  to  help the Government resolve the question of the mode and  manner  of\r\n\r\nmerger? If he does not indicate his choice, surely it is not suggested that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should remain undecided! Surely the Government must then proceed  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the wishes of this Assembly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a man fully understands the alternatives and indicates his choice showing\r\n\r\nwhich he prefers, but further wishes to indicate to the Government that his vote\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  counted, then he can write his name and address on  the  ballot\r\n\r\npaper and thereby invalidate his vote for the purposes of the count.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown has moved an amendment to clause 28 (b). He\r\n\r\nwishes it to read:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'on which anything is written or marked by which the voter can be identified\r\n\r\nexcept the printed number on the back;'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>as against what is in the Bill:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'on which the voter has indicated his vote and has written or marked anything\r\n\r\nby which he can be identified, except the printed number on the back;'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, he could not have missed the distinction between his amendment and what  is\r\n\r\nin  the Bill, namely that in the Bill a person must first indicate his vote  and\r\n\r\nthen  by  writing his name and address on the ballot paper by which  he  can  be\r\n\r\nidentified he can get his vote rejected.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process requires that the man knows what the issues are about and also by\r\n\r\nhis  making the choice indicates what the Member for Anson so fears that he does\r\n\r\nnot know the process of the vote. Having indicated that he knows the process  of\r\n\r\nthe vote, he can then proceed to identify himself and nullify it.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Advocate-General has advised the Government that clause 28 (b) has\r\n\r\ngiven expression to this intention, that those who understand the issue and have\r\n\r\nmade  their  choice, and write or mark something by which they can be identified\r\n\r\nwill have their votes rejected. The S.A.G. has further advised that in Singapore\r\n\r\na  man  can identify himself only by writing his name and address. That  is  the\r\n\r\nintention of this section and the interpretation that will be given to it. It is\r\n\r\none  thing  by  rumour - false and malicious - to get people  to  throw  in  blank\r\n\r\nballots.  First,  if  rumours were spread around that those who  exercise  their\r\n\r\nchoice  run the risk of losing their citizenship it is not impossible to  get  a\r\n\r\nsituation where large numbers of confused people, misled by rumours, would throw\r\n\r\nin  blank votes. But it is a different matter to mount a campaign to explain  to\r\n\r\nthe  voter  rationally and logically that it is his duty to express what  he  decides  is  the  better of the alternatives. Having done so and  proved  that  he\r\n\r\nunderstood what it is all about, he can then put his name and address on it  and\r\n\r\nhave  his  vote rejected. If Members of the Barisan Sosialis are confident  that\r\n\r\ntheir  supporters are so enraged at the prospect of merger, either complete  and\r\n\r\nunconditional  or  with local autonomy in education and labour,  then  they  can\r\n\r\nprove  it  by using the process open to them under clause 28 (b). The fact  that\r\n\r\nthey have remained silent on this indicates that they know full well they cannot\r\n\r\nget  the people to understand rationally the issues, fulfil their duty under the\r\n\r\nlaw, and then state that they do not wish to be counted.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, I think nobody doubts whether blank votes are counted in or\r\n\r\ncounted  out,  the result will be the same.

I think it is as well that the position in  the\r\n\r\nHouse is as it is today. It is not at our complete will and power to bring  this\r\n\r\nabout.  We intend to do what is right and what is our duty by the people in  the\r\n\r\ncountry. I say we shall see this referendum through because there is too much at\r\n\r\nstake otherwise.

The P.A.P. had\r\n\r\nan  easier  and  softer alternative, to lead the united front at the  behest  of\r\n\r\nthose   who  are  now  manipulating  the  Member  for  Queenstown,  or   another\r\n\r\nalternative,  to play the other way, like the Member for Cairnhill  has  played,\r\n\r\nwhere  there is no more time for humour, because the chaps who would have  booed\r\n\r\nand  laughed would have been absent from the mass rallies. We have taken it upon\r\n\r\nourselves to pose the real issues to the country. Whatever else we may have done\r\n\r\nor not done, we have posed the real basic problems of the country to the people.\r\n\r\nThey will be resolved either by the consent of the people, living peacefully and\r\n\r\nharmoniously,  a  society  of many races, in what we  now  know  as  Malaya  and\r\n\r\nSingapore,  or willy-filly by a reunification which will take place  under  much\r\n\r\ngreater  stresses and strains. That is the price we pay for carrying this  load.\r\n\r\nIt is not for the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. I suggest to Members opposite that if they can bring themselves round  to\r\n\r\ndefeat  us,  we have nothing else to do but constitutionally to go back  to  the\r\n\r\npeople. But I am confident, and so is the Member for Anson, and that is the  reason  why  he can take this line because somebody else he thinks will  carry  the\r\n\r\nload and carry the can for him. But this time let me explain to people like him,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthis   is  the  final  settlement  with  nationalists,  not  with  the  colonial\r\n\r\nGovernment, and nationalists settle not only with the Communists but with  their\r\n\r\nfellow-travellers.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I came over to the Opposition side because I am\r\n\r\nnot  satisfied  with  clause 29 of the Bill. I read  from  the  newspapers  this\r\n\r\nmorning  that  the  Prime Minister of Singapore had issued a statement.  In  the\r\n\r\nstatement  he said that I was under pressure, and as a result, I have  lost  the\r\n\r\ncourage to struggle. There is another paragraph in the statement which says that\r\n\r\nit  is a matter for regret that Madam Hoe Puay Choo should have lost her courage\r\n\r\nto  struggle at this late hour. Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to tell this House that\r\n\r\nI  am not under any pressure from any quarter. I am not satisfied with clause 29\r\n\r\nand other reasons connected with the P.A.P. If you say that is pressure, that is\r\n\r\nthe  pressure  in  the  interest  of  the  people,  and  the  pressure  of  this\r\n\r\nundemocratic  clause 29. As a matter of fact, I yesterday conveyed my  intention\r\n\r\nto leave the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to the Chairman of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nI  also  issued a statement to the Press. I do not know whether there is  enough\r\n\r\nspace in the Press or not, but my statement was given only a small space in  the\r\n\r\nPress.  I  shall  give my statement to the reporters later on. I  am  not  under\r\n\r\npressure  from any quarter. If it is for the interest of the people, I will  not\r\n\r\nmind  all  the  sacrifices. I will strongly struggle for  the  interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. But when I discovered the undemocratic provisions of this clause  29,  I\r\n\r\nsuspect  the scheme of the whole merger proposals and this Bill. What  are  they\r\n\r\ntrying  to  scheme?  It is because of these reasons that I  cannot  sit  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  side and support the Government by giving it lip service  while,  on\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand, I am thinking otherwise. I can say that I oppose  the  present\r\n\r\npolicy of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to make a short speech.

The Prime Minister has made a statement which he  knows\r\n\r\nis untrue, having known me for a very long time. He has suggested that I am associated with this attack on the Referendum Bill because I know others will  carry\r\n\r\nthe  can of supporting the Government. Sir, it is not unknown to Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse  who  have  been  for some time in politics, that in  fact  in  the  past,\r\n\r\nparticularly on one outstanding occasion when I returned from a trip overseas, I\r\n\r\nfound that the Labour Front was committed to the repeal of the Emergency\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulations.  To  our  surprise - astonishment, more than surprise - we  found  ourselves  in  the  Government  and  we met very strong  representations  from  the\r\n\r\nFederation  and our own Police and the Colonial Secretary as to the  dangers  of\r\n\r\nrepealing  the Emergency Regulations, it was put to us - the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nis  here to confirm it - that we could let others carry the can; we could move  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  to repeal the Emergency Regulations, and the Governor,  by  his\r\n\r\npowers  under  the Constitution, would reimpose them. I was rather horrified  at\r\n\r\nthe  suggestion that anybody could be so dishonest, so hypocritical and  refused\r\n\r\nto  do it. I carried the burden myself, as you may well remember. Sir, that  was\r\n\r\nan  unfair  suggestion. I would like to say this, and I want to say it  briefly\r\n\r\nbecause I understand there will be a no-confidence motion urged upon this  House\r\n\r\nin  the very near future. I honestly believe that the way the Government are proceeding now is inimical to the welfare of the people of Singapore and to the welfare  of those with whom we hope ultimately to be associated - the Federation.  I\r\n\r\nam  aware, Sir, that at the present juncture there is a certain state of flux in\r\n\r\npolitics  and  if  there were a general election certainly the P.A.P. would  be\r\n\r\ndead. That is true. I do not agree with the Barisan's confidence that they would\r\n\r\nsucceed.  Far from it, Sir. Unfortunately, I cannot say that the Workers'  Party\r\n\r\nhas  any  hope of leading the Government, Sir,I seek to be pragmatic  in  these\r\n\r\nmatters,  and  it may well be that there will be a large number of Independents;\r\n\r\ncertainly a growth in the S.P.A. and possibly some other Parties, if the  S.P.A.\r\n\r\ncontinues  as  it  did in the past. But I agree that there might  be  a  certain\r\n\r\namount of confusion. But, Sir, whatever the political picture may be, and taking\r\n\r\nit  at  its  very  worst,  the possible confusion that  may  eventuate  from  an\r\n\r\nimmediate  general election, I say to you in all earnestness, I do not  consider\r\n\r\nthat  it  could possibly do more damage to the people of Singapore than what  is\r\n\r\nbeing  perpetrated  today by the P.A.P. So let us face it. I  am  attacking  the\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill because I sincerely believe it is wrong to cheat the people even\r\n\r\nif  you think it is for their welfare. That Jesuitic casuistry, Sir, can  do  immense and irreparable harm to our efforts\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nto  bring about respect for the democratic process. I sincerely believe that  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  for the welfare of the people of Singapore in the long  term  if  the\r\n\r\nproposals,  which many want, could be put honestly and fairly. If  accepted,  my\r\n\r\nParty and I - and  I  know  the minority who would then have voted against it - would  accept\r\n\r\nloyally  the decision and the breach would be healed by virtue of the  principle\r\n\r\nthat  in  a  democracy  the minority accepts the will of the  majority.  If  the\r\n\r\nproposals  are rejected, I say I do not agree with the assessment of the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill that that would arouse antagonism, anger, and military conquest of\r\n\r\nSingapore as suggested by the Prime Minister. I am convinced that the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment,  with the experience and the wisdom it has shown in  the  last  five\r\n\r\nyears  of  government, will necessarily immediately reopen negotiations with  the\r\n\r\nnew  Government of Singapore which wou1d provide a basis for an acceptable  integration  of  this area in the Federation. It is a matter of irresistible  logic.\r\n\r\nThat  they have now awakened to the tremendous value, not merely value, but need\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  as  an  essential part of their concept of a  great,  viable  and\r\n\r\nbalanced nation. I am convinced that that must be so, Sir.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let us go on now to perhaps the briefest speech which the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas ever delivered in this Chamber. Mr Speaker, I enjoy ability wherever I find\r\n\r\nit, and strongly though I feel about our Prime Minister in many ways, not merely\r\n\r\nin  his  political  views,  I must say that I have genuine  admiration  for  his\r\n\r\nintellectual  acumen and manoeuvrability, for his intellectual  flexibility  and\r\n\r\nfor  the suavity of his presentation. But comparing last night's performance  of\r\n\r\nthe  learned  Member  for Fanner Park with this afternoon's performance  of  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister, I must say that the learned Member for Farrer  Park  comes  out\r\n\r\nbetter.  It is certainly not the most creditable performance the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  given, and it is understandable. For whatever the ambitions, the  lust  for\r\n\r\npower,  there cannot be absent from that much ability a modicum of human feeling\r\n\r\nand human decency which must rebel at the thought\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nof  prostituting his ability to the justification of something so  foul  as  the\r\n\r\nprovisions that are now under discussion. You can understand that he  wanted  to\r\n\r\nmake  the agony short and quick. He suggested to us, Sir, that the proof of  the\r\n\r\ncake  is  in the eating and that his Government has the constitutional right  to\r\n\r\ncarry  through  its  mandate for merger and that  it  has  no  duty  to  seek  a\r\n\r\nreferendum. Sir, it is unfortunate - and I trust you will forgive me here if I  do\r\n\r\nmake a passing reference to the fact - that the Prime Minister is not present with\r\n\r\nus  during  the  course  of  the debate and does  not  inform  himself  of  what\r\n\r\ntranspired. He might have found it interesting to reflect on the analogy I  gave\r\n\r\nof the merger proposals and the P.A.P. proposals in Command Paper 33 \r\n\r\n- the story of Chin Shi Wang and the deer and the horse. It is not a merger,  and\r\n\r\nthe S.P.A. and U.M.N.O. who are supporting him state quite frankly and honestly,\r\n\r\n\"This  is a step to closer relations which we sincerely believe in. But we agree\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  not a merger. It is a step towards merger.\" That is  a  clean  and\r\n\r\nstraightforward approach. But the P.A.P. have not a mandate for this step,  Sir,\r\n\r\nnor  have  they, in fact, any real mandate at all. But assuming they have,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthey know and we know what we understood by merger, and here, Sir, I will merely\r\n\r\nbriefly touch on it because it will be debated in full. If you remember the Paid\r\n\r\nCommission's Report on the Federation Constitution, I think, Sir, it  was  1956,\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  passage where they said, \"We must urge that  there  is  a  common\r\n\r\ncitizenship in respect of all those who have citizenship rights today in all the\r\n\r\nStates.\"  I shall be quoting, Sir, chapter and verse when we come to the  issue\r\n\r\nitself.  I  have not got the document with me at the moment. You can understand,\r\n\r\nSir,  we all understood, and I am sorry to be repetitive, what we all understood\r\n\r\nby  complete merger, which he charges the Workers' Party with and in respect  of\r\n\r\nwhich  we  are  not  a  bit ashamed - complete and unconditional  merger.  We  all\r\n\r\nunderstood that was understood by the Reid Commission and what transpired during\r\n\r\nthe  formation  of the Federation was that all those who had citizenship  rights\r\n\r\nbecame  citizens  of the new central entity. To say that he is giving  an  alternative and yet not putting an alternative\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwhich  the  Barisan  and the Workers' Party want, and yet  not  permitting  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  or  the Workers' Party to word that alternative because  he  says  the\r\n\r\nalternative  is  a  dishonest one since it seeks a super  merger  and  that  is\r\n\r\nsomething  we cannot get. That may or may not be true, Sir. But the  point  is,\r\n\r\nif  he does not want to put our alternative, whether it is dishonest or honest,\r\n\r\ndo  not  say  that you are putting an alternative. He is, in fact, not  putting\r\n\r\nthe Opposition alternative at all.\r\n\r\nBut even if he were, Sir, who are the Opposition or the Government to say that\r\n\r\nwe,  who  have been elected, and elected by majorities, in our divisions,  know\r\n\r\nwhat everybody wants in a matter that affects their future and posterity? It  is\r\n\r\nsurely  a  matter of elementary justice to permit a man to decide  for  himself,\r\n\r\nwhere it is so simple to permit him to do so; since you are putting a referendum\r\n\r\ngive him the right to say yes or no. Do not seek to speak for him yourself.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, he has drawn attention to clause 28 (1) (b) of the Referendum Bill.\r\n\r\nYesterday, you will remember, Mr Speaker, Sir, I drew attention to it  at  some\r\n\r\nlength.  I ask why there was a change from section 48 (1) (c) of the Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  Elections Ordinance to this curious additional element  that  he  must\r\n\r\nfirst  mark  his  vote. The Prime Minister tells us because the man  must  first\r\n\r\nindicate  which he prefers, then he can sign his name and address, and  then  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  prepared  to  treat  it as void. Mr  Speaker,  as  it  stood  in  the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly Elections Ordinance, and as it stood  originally  in  this\r\n\r\nvery  Bill, it has been stated that if a man indicates by writing his  identity,\r\n\r\nsurely that would have been enough and that might enable the man to say that  he\r\n\r\ncan  say 'no' that way. But here you are asking him to vote in favour of one  of\r\n\r\nthe  two  alternatives.  Mr Speaker, if he is in  favour  of  one  of  the  two\r\n\r\nalternatives, what does he want to go and sign his name and address in order  to\r\n\r\nvoid  his  vote  for? It is only when he is not in favour of either  alternative\r\n\r\nthat  we  seek for him the right to say 'no', or at the very worst, to void  his\r\n\r\nvote. You will notice, Sir, and I can tell you this-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nI have been in some elections - it used\r\n\r\nto  be interpreted that if a man marks anything on the ballot paper whereby  he\r\n\r\ncan  be  identified, for example if there is a handwriting, he says, \"I  do  not\r\n\r\nlike  the  Barisan  Sosialis,\" well now, you do not know who wrote  it.  But  it\r\n\r\nalways  used  to  be  interpreted that any handwriting can  give  away  a  man's\r\n\r\nidentity, and that is deemed to be void. Sir, not only must you write your name,\r\n\r\naccording to the Prime Minister who says, \"Now this is the way it is going to be\r\n\r\ninterpreted\", but you must also write your address and, in addition to  it  all,\r\n\r\nyou  write  your name, you write your address, and then you write which  of  the\r\n\r\nalternatives  you want. Quite apart from anything else, Sir, do you  think  that\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore who have struggled for and respected the secrecy of the\r\n\r\nballot  because of the protection from intimidation by those in power  would  be\r\n\r\nprepared, even if all other conditions were acceptable, to write their names and\r\n\r\naddresses and subject themselves to reprisals by the Government? Because if  you\r\n\r\nwant  to  say  'no'  then  there can be no secrecy.  The  essential  part  of  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic vote is the secrecy. The Prime Minister asks now that we should\r\n\r\neducate the people first into casting a vote, which they want, then into signing\r\n\r\ntheir names, then putting their addresses; before it can be treated as void.  To\r\n\r\nthese  depths has a great intellect descended and degenerated. He says  that  in\r\n\r\nthis country, by rumours, large numbers of confused people may cast blank votes.\r\n\r\nWell, the P.A.P. has done its share of seeking to confuse the people. It must be\r\n\r\nrecognised that it certainly has at its command far greater forces of propaganda\r\n\r\nthan  any  other  organisation,  and that it  has  utilised  those  forces - Radio\r\n\r\nP.A.P. - its power of coercion of the Press, to very considerable effect  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of confusing the people. But the issue, Sir, is this: Is a person  whom\r\n\r\nhis political opponent alleges to be confused, is such a person not entitled  to\r\n\r\nvote? That is all it is, Sir.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, in fact, what the Prime Minister is propounding is that only those who are\r\n\r\nprepared to vote for the Government are entitled to vote, and everybody else\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nbeing  by definition confused is not entitled to vote, we have reached  a  stage\r\n\r\nnot  of guided democracy, but of unique dictatorship unknown even in Fascism  or\r\n\r\nin Communism.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry, Sir, he is not here to explain to us wherein is the flaw of the\r\n\r\nlogic  I  seek to propound.

I must confess  to  you,\r\n\r\nSir,  I cannot see it, and I am a little distressed that such specious arguments\r\n\r\nshould  be enunciated, for the man, whatever his other failings, is not  lacking\r\n\r\nin  acumen  and understanding of logic. It has been a pathetic display  of  pure\r\n\r\nnaked power politics, the power that is in the barrel of the gun which they love\r\n\r\nso much. Truth does not matter, logic does not matter. We have got the power, we\r\n\r\ncan  use the legalistic smokescreen, the Press and the radio to fool the people,\r\n\r\nas  many  as can be fooled; and the majority who do not like it, well, they  are\r\n\r\ndisorganised and they cannot do anything, and they can jolly well lump it.

I\r\n\r\nfeel  that there are people who would like politics to be argued along lines  of\r\n\r\nbeing for one Party or another Party. Many would like us to be pro-Barisan.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will recall that when the pay cut issue came up in this House, the\r\n\r\nBarisan  people were in the P.A.P. and they were for the pay cuts  and  we  were\r\n\r\nagainst  the pay cuts, against the whole P.A.P. and the Barisan. Then  when  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong Lim got into trouble, Sir, if you will remember, and  we  felt\r\n\r\nthat he was being persecuted beyond what he should, we opposed the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmove. So today, because we are standing for what we believe to be right for this\r\n\r\ncountry  and what is best for the welfare of the people, and because we  do  not\r\n\r\nagree  with the pro-Barisan line, they now say we are pro-P.A.P. Sir, our  stand\r\n\r\nhas  been  consistent. Wherever there is wrong, we oppose it. Wherever there  is\r\n\r\nright, we support it. Wherever there is doubt regarding what is right and wrong.\r\n\r\nSir, it is only right that we abstain.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so many thousands of words have been poured out from this Assembly on the\r\n\r\nblank  votes issue, the referendum and merger, that they have become like autumn\r\n\r\nleaves covering the ground, so much so that the public are unable to distinguish\r\n\r\nthe  pathways  from  the  drains.  I  have tried  to  listen  patiently  and  as\r\n\r\nobjectively as I could. As I see it, Sir, there are three sides to the  question\r\n\r\nof  blank votes. Firstly, there is the side as it appears to the general public.\r\n\r\nUnder normal circumstances, a blank vote is a blank piece of paper conveying  no\r\n\r\nthing.  Neither for nor against and in democratic practice, Sir, if out  of  100\r\n\r\npersons, 39 attend a meeting and 70 choose to be absent, the votes of the 70 are\r\n\r\nnot counted. The votes of the 30 are the votes that will be counted. I say under\r\n\r\nnormal  circumstances. The P.A.P. have now presented another  side.  They  claim\r\n\r\nthat  the  circumstances  are no longer normal, that  in  the  present  abnormal\r\n\r\nsituation,  the blank votes are loaded votes. That behind these blank  votes  is\r\n\r\nanother  side,  which  is dynamite, Sir. They have put out  this  propaganda  to\r\n\r\narouse  communal fears, suspicions and illwill. Sir, if what the P.A.P. says  is\r\n\r\ntrue and the situation is abnormal, and there is propaganda going on to make the\r\n\r\nblank votes have a twisted meaning, then it is dangerous for the future and  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  the people of Singapore. The P.A.P. claim that Barisan workers  and\r\n\r\nsupporters are organising a compaign to frighten the people so that  they  will\r\n\r\ncast blank votes, not to indicate whether they like this or that form of merger,\r\n\r\nbut as a protest or out of fear that one community would suffer at the hands  of\r\n\r\nanother.  Sir,  if the situation is as dangerous and as abnormal as  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave painted it out to be, and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe  blank votes become loaded votes, then they say they should have the  right,\r\n\r\nas  the  Party  in power, to frustrate such a move. That is to say,  if  at  the\r\n\r\ntraffic crossroads the traffic lights have suddenly jammed, they have the  right\r\n\r\nto put on a traffic policeman to enable the traffic to move even against the red\r\n\r\nlight,  because the traffic lights have jammed. Sir, that is their side  of  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  blank votes. Sir, the Barisan and pro-Barisan groups maintain  that\r\n\r\nthis  interpretation of blank votes is undemocratic. It is against common sense.\r\n\r\nI  agree that normally it is undemocratic and against common sense. The crux  of\r\n\r\nthe  matter is: is the situation normal; are the circumstances normal; or is the\r\n\r\nsituation abnormal, and are the circumstances abnormal? That is the crux of  the\r\n\r\nmatter.  Sir, in 1946 and 1947, there was a Council of Joint Action  called  the\r\n\r\nAll-Malaya  Council  of  Joint Action for agitation against  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  agreement or Constitution. There was considerable fear in the hearts  of\r\n\r\nthe Chinese that they would suffer under a government where the Malays would  be\r\n\r\nin  the  majority.  Sir, one of the leaders practically went round  the  country\r\n\r\nsaying we must organise the Chinese to protect their rights and so on.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Are all these details relevant to the amendment? Let us\r\n\r\nnot  go  into details. The fact that there was a Malayan Council of Joint Action\r\n\r\ncan be mentioned, but only in passing. We do not want these details.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, as to the earlier part of the details, the relevance\r\n\r\nis  that  if the loaded votes convey such propaganda, it is a dangerous line.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it should be said to the credit of some of the leaders that they realised\r\n\r\nin  time and, for the sake of the country, they said they would organise  to  co\r\n\r\noperate.  That was the salvation for Malaya, Sir. We believe that in this  House\r\n\r\nmost  of the leaders are responsible people and would like to find an honourable\r\n\r\nsolution.  So  if there is this deadlock where the question of  blank  votes  is\r\n\r\nlooked at from three angles and has three different interpretations, let us\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ntake  another look at it in a different way, a constructive way. How can we find\r\n\r\na constructive solution?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all Parties are agreed that there should be merger. They all disagree on\r\n\r\nthe  forms of merger. To me, Sir, as I have stated here, the different forms  of\r\n\r\nmerger  or  closer political association are good according to circumstances.  A\r\n\r\nsmall  boy requires a suit of clothes different from the one which the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Health and Law is now wearing. We cannot say the small boy's suit is wrong,\r\n\r\nor  that  the Minister's suit is wrong or ill-fitting. So let us put the various\r\n\r\nforms of merger to the people and, according to what they like, they choose  the\r\n\r\nparticular form they want, and let the majority decide on the particular form of\r\n\r\nmerger or closer association which they think is best for this country.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government have agreed that instead of presenting just one or two choices,\r\n\r\nthere  will be three. The Member for Cairnhill will later in an amendment  state\r\n\r\nthe particular alternative we would like to have put before this House and paced\r\n\r\nbefore  the people in the referendum. Sir, since that will be done and  will  he\r\n\r\ndebated  here, let the different Parties decide on what they think is  the  best\r\n\r\nform  of  merger that will be placed before the people. There would then  be  no\r\n\r\nquestion  of blank votes being loaded because the blank votes would  be  just  a\r\n\r\nsmall percentage. And that is what happens in every election. However, Sir, the\r\n\r\nblank  votes  come to a big percentage, then perhaps the view which  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nholds - that the blank votes may be loaded - may be true. But I hope it will not  be\r\n\r\ntrue.  Our  stand is that we want the views of the people on the kind of  merger\r\n\r\nthey  like  best.  We  do  not want any loaded votes.  We  may  expect  a  small\r\n\r\npercentage of blank votes. We surely cannot expect a large percentage  of  blank\r\n\r\nvotes if all the Parties which stood for election and are represented here  were\r\n\r\naccurate  in  their assessment of the wishes of the people. All people  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  want some form of closer association with the other territories  around\r\n\r\nus. Now that we are thinking in terms\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nof  Malaysia, I, for one, believe that, for the sake of Singapore, we must  have\r\n\r\nsome  form  of closer association in Malaysia. Even Britain at this  time,  Sir,\r\n\r\nfinds that it cannot provide prosperity for its people unless it is part of  the\r\n\r\nCommon  Market. We cannot think in terms of being in a small hole. I would  very\r\n\r\nmuch  like,  if possible, to be in a Singapore that can live by itself,  be  completely \r\n\r\nindependent and yet be able to provide prosperity and jobs for our  peo\r\n\r\nple  and for our children. If we cannot, then in the interests of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  must seek some form of closer association. And I am  sure,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwith goodwill from all sides, not thinking in terms of party interests and party\r\n\r\nsupremacy  in  a party struggle, we surely can find some solution that  will  be\r\n\r\ngood and suitable for the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that what we speak here henceforth will help our people outside to\r\n\r\nget  a  clearer idea of what the alternatives are. At the moment, as I said,  so\r\n\r\nmany  things  are  being spoken at such a rapid rate that even  educated  people\r\n\r\noutside, when I ask them, say they are confused.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As I have indicated, there seems to be a great deal of repetition.

In  my\r\n\r\naddress  I was trying to understand, as far as I can, the objections of the  Member  for Anson to our position. I was not present in this Chamber throughout his\r\n\r\naddress,  but fortunately we have now a copy of Hansard of his speech yesterday,\r\n\r\nfrom which I can judge his reaction to what I have said.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid I have not gone very far in convincing him of our case. I want to\r\n\r\nspend  just  a few minutes to clarify certain issues which, from his statement,\r\n\r\nhe  is  not very clear about. He said that I was trying to -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Page\r\n\r\nnumber?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I beg your\r\n\r\npardon, page 48.* He said that I was trying to justify this clause on the ground\r\n\r\nthat the Communists do not like it, and therefore it must be good. Sir, that has\r\n\r\nnever  been my justification, and I have never made any statement that can  lend\r\n\r\nitself to misinterpretation. He went on to say:\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n*Vol. 18, No. 5, col. 613.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, he said if the Barisan Sosialis would fight for a merger in accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the constituent States of the Federation [of Malaya], then he would  agree\r\n\r\nthat  everybody would have the right to say \"yes\" or \"no\", and that there should\r\n\r\nnot be this nefarious clause [i.e. this clause 29].'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Now, I advanced this proposition to show that while the Barisan Sosialis in this\r\n\r\nAssembly  stated  that  they  wanted merger as  a  constituent  State  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  in  all  their propaganda campaigns they have  done  everything  to\r\n\r\nundermine  public confidence in any possibility of merger in any form whatsoever\r\n\r\nwith the Federation. That is my point. And it is because of the Barisan and the\r\n\r\nother Communist open front organisations fighting merger at that level that I am\r\n\r\nprepared to give this assurance - that if they were to campaign honestly in favour\r\n\r\nof merger as a constituent State, in a position of complete equality with any of\r\n\r\nthe  eleven States, then I say this clause is quite unnecessary. But because  we\r\n\r\nknow  that  they  have been campaigning quite contrary to their openly  declared\r\n\r\nstand in this Assembly, I say that it is this which is at the root of dishonesty\r\n\r\nin the referendum. Therefore, special precautions have to be taken to counteract\r\n\r\nthe effect of the Barisan's dishonesty.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member far Anson is not satisfied. He says, \"Why pay so much attention to\r\n\r\nthe Barisan?\" He says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Are we running this country for the Barisan Sosialis?'\r\n\r\n<br><br>The answer is, of course, \"No.\" But if Barisan Sosialis are up to mischief, then\r\n\r\nI  say it is the duty of the Government to prevent this mischief from having any\r\n\r\ndangerous effect in the country. If it is only a matter of the Member for  Anson\r\n\r\nwho is trying to create mischief, with due respect to the Member, Sir, I say  we\r\n\r\nwill not be greatly alarmed. Because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwithout  the  organisational support of the Communist open front  organisations,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Anson would be a completely spent force. Then he  raised  this\r\n\r\nquestion of how the merger proposals\r\n\r\nshould be framed at the referendum. He said:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I cannot see how it can matter whether the Barisan Sosialis are or are not in\r\n\r\nfavour of merger on the basis of a constituent State.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can these words be spoken, Mr Speaker, Sir? It does matter a great deal,\r\n\r\nbecause  if  they are in favour of complete merger on an equal  basis  with  any\r\n\r\nother  State, and they publicly stated so, we have quoted innumerable  documents\r\n\r\nand  I  do not want to repeat these quotations. Then they are committed to  this\r\n\r\nline,  and if they choose in their ground level campaign to do just the reverse,\r\n\r\nthen  they  cannot  blame us if we take precautions in this Referendum  Bill  to\r\n\r\nneutralise the effect of their mischievous dishonesty.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson then goes on to complain that putting complete merger in\r\n\r\nthe  way  that  we  intend, that is to say, to state it as  complete  and  unconditional  merger  on  the  basis of equality with  any  of  the  States  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation, that is not a fair way of putting it because, in his own words:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The trouble about a constituent State, Sir, is that the P.A.P. themselves\r\n\r\nhave  so  sullied  and  distorted that, though it may  at  one  time  have  been\r\n\r\nacceptable by virtue of the interpretation which the P.A.P. have put, it is  one\r\n\r\nwhich they know nobody can accept.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this, I take it that the Member for Anson means that complete and unconditional merger on terms equal with those of any other State in the Federation\r\n\r\nwould  lead  automatically  to conversion of Singapore  citizens  to  Federation\r\n\r\ncitizens. I think that is his line. And he said that we have disputed this interpretation,  and that our feeling is that if we accept complete merger  on  equal\r\n\r\nterms with other States, the citizenship laws of the Federation would apply  and\r\n\r\nlarge  numbers  of  Singapore citizens who were not born  here  may  lose  their\r\n\r\ncitizenship. That is our view. The Member for Anson says that that  is  a  wrong\r\n\r\nlegal interpretation and that, in fact,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nunder  complete  merger  he  is quite confident that  Singapore  citizens  would\r\n\r\nautomatically qualify for full Federal citizenship.

We are not putting up that sort of a question, and  if\r\n\r\nwe  did  put up that sort of question, I agree that that would be dishonest  because  it  is putting forward our point of view of what complete merger  means.\r\n\r\nIn  the  question which we shall put - the alternative to complete merger - we  are\r\n\r\nmaking  no such interpretation.

I know  we  will\r\n\r\ndebate  this in detail when we come to debate the questions to be posed  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in the referendum. But at least at this point let me indicate  their\r\n\r\nabsolute  dishonesty  in  the posing of these two questions.  The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance says they are honest because they are supposed to be the merger stand of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition. The point is: Are they really posing the merger  stand  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition?  If  they  are  not,  then it is  clear  that  those  questions  are\r\n\r\ndishonest.  If  they want to pose the merger stand of the Opposition,  the  only\r\n\r\nhonest  thing  for the Government to do is to let the Opposition  explain  their\r\n\r\nstand  and  to  pose it themselves. The Government have no right  to  put  their\r\n\r\nmalicious and distorted interpretation on our merger stand. Day in and  day  out\r\n\r\nthey have repeated these malicious falsehoods.

The  purpose  of  this\r\n\r\namendment is at least to\r\n\r\nenable the people to know the extent of perfidy which is perpetrated on them. We\r\n\r\nask  no  more than what is normally granted in every election that blank  papers\r\n\r\nand  ambiguous  ballot  papers, which are now to be counted  as  votes  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  should be counted and the number of such votes  shall  be  declared\r\n\r\npublicly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I give you the position where a hundred people go to vote:\r\n\r\nto  vote  for  the P.A.P. proposals; one votes for Penang and Malacca,  and  89\r\n\r\ncast blank votes. The Government will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ntell  you  they have got 99, but they will not tell you 10 plus 89.  The  Government's declaration will be through their Superintendent, \"We have 99 per cent of\r\n\r\nthe vote.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask that that vote be broken down into its realities and that it should be\r\n\r\nclearly  indicated. Which are the votes for the P.A.P. proposals, and which  are\r\n\r\nthe  protest  blank  votes which, by a dishonest provision that  all  men  shall\r\n\r\nhenceforth he known as women, the Government now transforms into votes  for  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. proposals? That is all. This provision seeks that the people shall  know\r\n\r\nthe  truth.  It  cannot  legally affect the dishonesty  that  is  sought  to  be\r\n\r\nperpetrated. It merely asks that the dishonesty or lack of it should be  clearly\r\n\r\nproclaimed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy to notice that there is at least one Member of the Opposition\r\n\r\nFront  bench  here  to  hear this part of what I have  to  say.  In  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  the same principle, in column 395 the Member for Cairnhill  voted\r\n\r\nwith  the  Opposition  group. The principle there was on the  principle  of  the\r\n\r\nannouncement  to be made by the Superintendent wherein the main issue  was  that\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  blank  and  ambiguous votes should be  clearly  and  separately\r\n\r\nindicated. Sir, the P.A.P. are seeking, like a dog hiding his dirt, to hide  the\r\n\r\ntruth  of the results of the referendum and if that is what they seek, Sir,  why\r\n\r\ndo  they not ask for an overall clause whereby they can say that the P.A.P. may\r\n\r\nat  the  end of a referendum announce that the P.A.P. proposals have obtained  a\r\n\r\n100  per cent vote?

The  Singapore\r\n\r\nPeople's  Alliance  voted independently and because the  other  Parties  in\r\n\r\nopposition happened to vote with the Singapore People's Alliance,  that  is\r\n\r\njust  the misfortune of the Singapore People's Alliance.

My  argument,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  that the notice papers given by the Minister for Home Affairs and  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister invalidate what the Minister for Home Affairs said here. He  said\r\n\r\nthat since it was impossible to anticipate what type of questions would be posed\r\n\r\nand that since this was a general Referendum Bill -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

That is the reason  for\r\n\r\nour  amendments. Sir. A person should only be penalised once. The other part  of\r\n\r\nour  amendment is that we feel that discretion should be left to  a  High  Court\r\n\r\nJudge  to decide whether or not a less heavy penalty should be inflicted on  the\r\n\r\nperson.

You will notice, in spirit though  not\r\n\r\nin wording, the Member for Queenstown and I on this matter are rather close.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not seek to reduce the maximum penalty to three years as he does, because  I\r\n\r\nseek to highlight the discretionary power of our courts. Mr Chairman, before  I\r\n\r\ncome  to that, I would ask you to look at this rag-bag of clause 32 (1). It  has\r\n\r\nnine assorted classifications of crimes, some of them very serious, Sir,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nand some of them far from serious. For example, forges or counterfeits ballot papers  in  paragraph (a), I think you will agree, Sir, is a very serious  matter.\r\n\r\nAnd the last paragraph (i):\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'manufactures, constructs, imports . . . supplies . . ., or causes to be manufactured... any appliance, device or mechanism by which a\r\n\r\nballot paper may be extracted...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>which are very serious offences indeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then, Sir,\r\n\r\nparagraph (e):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'puts into any ballot box anything other than the ballot paper...'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>If he puts in a pencil, he gets seven years' imprisonment.

I can understand the Government on this, Sir. This, as they\r\n\r\nwill tell you, is copied from the 1954 Elections Ordinance which they tried to\r\n\r\nfather on to me, Sir, but they discovered later that their history on this was\r\n\r\nsomewhat rusty and that this was, in fact, a colonial\r\n\r\nprovision-[Interruption]\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister for Law is getting\r\n\r\ndisorderly. He will have his opportunity of answering. Mr Marshall.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, they will tell you this comes from the 1954 Legislative Assembly\r\n\r\nElections Ordinance. I repeat I am very unhappy about this provision, without\r\n\r\ndue authority, but if you leave it to a Judge, Sir, and if he sees, for example,\r\n\r\nhere is an ignorant woman. If she goes in she is supposed to put her paper into\r\n\r\nthe box. She walks out with the paper, not intending anything wrong. You can\r\n\r\nleave it to the good sense of the Judge to deal with her in accordance with the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the law, exercising his discretion whether to put a heavy sentence\r\n\r\nor a light one. Unfortunately,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nSir,  in this rag-bag they have nine classifications of offences. They go  right\r\n\r\nout of the normal tradition which has been found to be so valuable, of providing\r\n\r\na maximum punishment and leaving it to a Judge to exercise his discretion within\r\n\r\nthat maximum what sentence to impose. Sir, that is the entire basis of the amend\r\n\r\nments  as  I understand them, amendments (i) and (ii), and certainly  the  first\r\n\r\npart  of  my  amendment  in  (iv). All I seek is to  leave  the  matter  to  the\r\n\r\ndiscretion\r\n\r\nof a Judge. I recognize that these offences, some of which are very grave should\r\n\r\nbe  severely  punished,  just as you severely punish  attempted  murder  or  you\r\n\r\nseverely punish voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon, where\r\n\r\nyou  put  the sentence up to ten years: but within that maximum, Sir, the  Judge\r\n\r\nhas  a discretion in particular cases even to impose a fine or to impose a  life\r\n\r\nsentence,  depending upon the circumstances which brought about the offence  and\r\n\r\nthe motive behind it. The trust we have in our Judges has been not merely richly\r\n\r\ndeserved  but has worked magnificently. We must all confess that no  Legislature\r\n\r\ncould have succeeded so well in imposing tables of sentences as have been worked\r\n\r\nout  in experience by providing a maximum and letting the Judges exercise  their\r\n\r\ndiscretion. If the man is a second offender, if the man is a third offender,  if\r\n\r\nthe  man is a confirmed criminal, they can then exercise their discretion within\r\n\r\nthat  maximum. I want to repeat, Sir, because here again I quite naturally  fear\r\n\r\ndistortion. I am not seeking to support the third amendment. All I am seeking is\r\n\r\nthat there should be a discretion vested in the Judge to provide for a fine,  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for imprisonment up to seven years if he thinks proper, as well  as  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  declaring him to be incapable of voting or standing for  election.\r\n\r\nMay  I seek your guidance, Mr Chairman, as regards the second aspect, which  is\r\n\r\ntechnical, to leave that when we come to amendment (iv)?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it the Member for Anson is raising a legal argument in\r\n\r\nregard to the last part of clause 32, that is, he seeks to leave out the words:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'or of being elected a Member of the Legislative Assembly, and if at that date\r\n\r\nhe  is a Member of the Legislative Assembly, his seat shall be vacated from  the\r\n\r\ndate of such conviction'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  argument on that will be a legal argument. Is it convenient to the Minister\r\n\r\nto leave that until later for argument?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, the offences mentioned in this clause\r\n\r\nare  very  serious and if we wish to keep the referendum clean, it is  essential\r\n\r\nthat  the  punishment should provide a deterrent. These are  offences  connected\r\n\r\nwith  electoral  procedures. It is right and proper, in view of the  gravity  of\r\n\r\nthese  offences,  that the court should not be given a discretion  to  impose  a\r\n\r\nfine. In the framing of legislation, Sir, it is the practice for the Legislature\r\n\r\nto  distinguish  between offences which are grave, offences  which  are  not  so\r\n\r\ngrave,  and  offences which are minor. In the case of offences which  are  minor\r\n\r\noffences, it is the practice to provide that the court can only punish by way of\r\n\r\na  fine.  In the case of offences which are not so grave, the court is  given  a\r\n\r\ndiscretion to impose punishment by way of imprisonment or a fine. In cases which\r\n\r\nare considered to be grave, it is usual to provide that the court can punish  by\r\n\r\nway  of  imprisonment only or imprisonment and a fine. In the case to which  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson referred just now, paragraph (e) of clause 32 (1) he cited  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  somebody putting a pencil into the ballot box. He failed to  read  on.\r\n\r\nThere is sub-clause (6) which provides that prosecutions for offences under this\r\n\r\nsection  shall  not  be instituted without the sanction of the  State  Advocate-General. In matters like that, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, we could leave it to the good sense of the State Advocate-General\r\n\r\nnot  to  institute any proceedings. It will be the same with regard to  offences\r\n\r\nunder paragraph (f) of this sub-clause.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the court having a discretion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I see from the text of\r\n\r\nthis  clause that the court is already vested with the discretion as far as  the\r\n\r\nperiod  of imprisonment is concerned. Because these offences are grave  offences\r\n\r\nand  they  cannot be considered minor, it is essential that the only  punishment\r\n\r\nthat  should  be provided for a breach of any of these provisions  should  be  a\r\n\r\nsentence of imprisonment, Sir.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I am\r\n\r\nindebted.

There is no\r\n\r\ndiscretion there. There is a discretion about the imprisonment, Sir, but no  discretion  with reference to a man being deprived for seven years of his right  of\r\n\r\nvoting or standing for election, which seems to me, Sir, in the context of  some\r\n\r\nof  those  offences, if you permit me to say en passant, quite disproportionate.\r\n\r\nBut  I will go on from there, Sir, to the second part where I seek to leave  out\r\n\r\nthe words,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"or of being elected a Member of the Legislative Assembly, and if at that date\r\n\r\nhe  is a Member of the Legislative Assembly, his seat shall be vacated from the\r\n\r\ndate of such conviction.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  those are the words I ask to be deleted.

Section 42 deals with the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ntenure of office of Members of the Assembly. Sir, section 42 (3) states:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, if any Member of the\r\n\r\nAssembly is sentenced by a court in any pant of Her Majesty's dominions to death\r\n\r\nor  to  imprisonment (by whatever name called) for a term of or exceeding twelve\r\n\r\nmonths, he shall forthwith cease to exercise any of his functions as a Member...'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that is definite, Sir. \". . . and his seat in the Assembly shall become\r\n\r\nvacant  at  the expiration of a period of thirty days thereafter: \". So  let  us\r\n\r\ntake it in stages, Sir. The moment he is convicted to twelve months or more,  he\r\n\r\nceases  functioning as a Member but his seat does not become vacant until thirty\r\n\r\ndays after. And then there is a proviso, Sir, which is a paragraph:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Provided that the Speaker may, at the request of the Member, from time to\r\n\r\ntime  extend that period for further periods of thirty days to enable the Member\r\n\r\nto  pursue any appeal in respect of his conviction or sentence, so however  that\r\n\r\nextensions  of  time exceeding in the aggregate three hundred  and  thirty  days\r\n\r\nshall  not  be  given  without  the  approval  of  the  Assembly  signified   by\r\n\r\nresolution.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  the position is, Sir, first, the moment he is convicted to twelve months  or\r\n\r\nmore  he ceases to function. After thirty lays, his seat is vacated, unless  you\r\n\r\nhear  from him that he is appealing, and in the exercise of your discretion  you\r\n\r\ngrant  him an extension of thirty days. Then his appeal not having come on,  you\r\n\r\ncan  give  him another extension of thirty days for eleven months in  all,  Sir.\r\n\r\nThat  is  to say, eleven months in addition to the first month. A total  of  one\r\n\r\nyear. Mr Speaker, then you have proviso (b):\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If at any time before the Member vacates his seat he is granted a free pardon\r\n\r\nor  his  conviction  is  set aside or his sentence  is  reduced  to  a  term  of\r\n\r\nimprisonment  of less than twelve months or a punishment other than imprisonment\r\n\r\nis  substituted, his seat in the Assembly shall not become vacant . . . and  he\r\n\r\nmay resume . . . his functions...\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see the scheme, Mr Speaker. I would like to draw your attention also to\r\n\r\nthe provision of section 42 (2) (h). Subsection (2), the operative words are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The seat of a Member shall become vacant\",\r\n\r\n<br><br>and under paragraph (h):\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"if he becomes subject to any of the disqualifications specified in paragraphs\r\n\r\n(f), (h) and (i) of section 41 of this Order.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this is legislation by reference. Let us go to section 41, Sir. And we\r\n\r\ncome  to paragraph (f), under any law for the time being when he is adjudged  of\r\n\r\nunsound mind. That is not valid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (h) is the one. He is disqualified for membership of the Assembly\r\n\r\nunder  any  law  for the time being in force in Singapore relating  to  offences\r\n\r\nconnected with elections. Now, Sir, if he is disqualified for membership under a\r\n\r\nlaw  in  connection with elections, then he must vacate his seat. I want you  to\r\n\r\nnotice  the  vital  words there, Sir, - \"any law for the time being  in  force  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  relating  to offences connected with elections\". \"elections\"  is  the\r\n\r\noperative word, not with a referendum but with \"elections\". I am not seeking  to\r\n\r\nscore over the Government here, Sir, I feel it my duty to draw the attention  of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  to the fact that in my view we would he acting  ultra  vires  in\r\n\r\nmaking  a  provision for the vacation of an Assemblyman's seat contrary  to  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Constitution under which we are working. I am quite sure  that\r\n\r\nnobody  wants  to  indicate - whatever their personal views - official  contempt  by\r\n\r\nseeking  to  pass  laws which we know are unlawful. You know,  Sir,  that  under\r\n\r\nsection  105, we can change that provision ourselves. But under section 105,  we\r\n\r\nrequire  a  two-thirds majority of all the Members in the Assembly.  So  I  urge\r\n\r\nmerely this, Sir, that we be conscious of the legal obstacle to the procedure we\r\n\r\nare  seeking to adopt, that we cannot, contrary to the provisions of section  42\r\n\r\nof  the  Constitution, compel a Member to vacate his seat in connection  with  a\r\n\r\nreferendum  offence, otherwise in accordance with the provisions of  section  42\r\n\r\n(3) of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all the\r\n\r\nprecedents  which  the Select Committee considered on the  holding  of  national\r\n\r\nreferenda  have  either  imported  the identical  provisions  of  the  electoral\r\n\r\nprocedures  and  the  laws governing the holding of general elections  into  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  legislation  itself,  or have specifically  required  that  recourse\r\n\r\nshould be had to the procedures set out in the laws governing the holding of\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ngeneral  elections  for the purpose of holding the national referendum.  In  the\r\n\r\nholding  of national referenda, existing electoral procedures are used  and  the\r\n\r\nelectors  are invited to make a choice of issues. In a general election  or  by-election, the electors are invited to make a choice of candidates.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been advised by the State Advocate-General that although in sec\r\n\r\ntion  39 of the Order in Council, Members of the Assembly are held to be persons\r\n\r\nqualified  for  election,  in accordance with the provisions  of  the  Order  in\r\n\r\nCouncil  and  elected in the manner provided by or under any law  for  the  time\r\n\r\nbeing  enforced  in Singapore, the disqualifications arising under  sections  41\r\n\r\n(h) and 42 (h) of the Order in Council - \r\n\r\nto  which  the  Member  for  Anson  has just referred - from  the  commission  of\r\n\r\noffences connected with the elections are not technically restricted to offences\r\n\r\nconnected  with  elections to the Assembly. Had that been  the  intention,  this\r\n\r\nwould  have been spelt out by the use of such words as \"offences connected  with\r\n\r\nelections to the Assembly\" in these sections of the Order in Council.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Advocate-General has further indicated that if this had been the\r\n\r\nintention  a  definition would have been provided for the  word  \"elections\"  in\r\n\r\nsection 1 (1) of the Order in Council.\r\n\r\nAnd  he  draws  attention  to the fact that although \"Assembly\",  \"Session\"  and\r\n\r\n\"Sitting\" are provided with definitions in section 1(1) of the Order in Council,\r\n\r\nno  definition has been provided for the word \"elections\", Sir, It  would  therefore  appear that the disqualifications involving the vacation of seats  by  Members  of the Assembly who are guilty of offences under clauses 32, 38 and 42  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill are not ultra vires the provisions of sections 41 (h) and 42 (h)  of\r\n\r\nthe  Order in Council. As to section 42 (3) of the Order in Council to which the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  referred just now, it deals with  cases  where  persons  are\r\n\r\nconvicted  of  offences under the Elections Ordinance or  under  the  Referendum\r\n\r\nBill. In these cases, there must be time given to the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nperson who is convicted to appeal.

And I still feel - \r\n\r\nand  I am still convinced - that somewhere there is a misunderstanding between the\r\n\r\nMinister  and myself, because I am convinced that in law this is ultra vires.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to draw his attention to the word \"elections\". He says quite rightly\r\n\r\nthat  it  was not defined. But if he will remember, Sir, at the date  when  this\r\n\r\nConstitution  was  promulgated in 1958, we had at that time a City  Council  and\r\n\r\nelections to the City Council. We had provisions. I think, in mind for elections\r\n\r\nto other organisations.\r\n\r\nSo, a provision there - and it was possibly an oversight - was specifically intended for\r\n\r\nelections. The issue of referendum had not occurred to the draftsman. It was not\r\n\r\navailable.  It  does specifically limit the disqualification to disqualification\r\n\r\nin  respect of offences in connection with elections. We cannot avoid  that  and\r\n\r\nsay  \"elections\"  includes \"referendum\". To suggest that, Sir,  is  I  say  with\r\n\r\nrespect  an  absurdity. The difficulty about the limb in  clause  32  are  these\r\n\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"... if at that date he is a Member of the Legislative Assembly, his seat shall\r\n\r\nbe vacated from the date of such conviction.\" It is not merely he shall cease to\r\n\r\nfunction,  which the Article provides, but his seat shall be vacated,  and  this\r\n\r\nis,  if  you will notice, Sir, in direct contravention of the wording of section\r\n\r\n42  (3)  which  'puts  the  vacation of the seat at a  period  of  30  days  and\r\n\r\nsubsequent  periods not exceeding 11 of additional 30 days, it means in  effect,\r\n\r\nSir - if  I am right - that they cannot achieve any vacation of his seat at  all  by\r\n\r\nthis  ultra vires provision. If they would like to amend it to permit him to  be\r\n\r\ndealt  with, and I say, Sir, its deletion would permit him to be dealt  with  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  the Article.  Because  the  Minister  has\r\n\r\nindicated  earlier that there is a discretion in the Judge to  convict  him  and\r\n\r\nsentence  him  to  a  term of imprisonment not exceeding  two  years.  He  might\r\n\r\nsentence him to six months. He might sentence him to one day, Sir. And\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nI  have known such cases to occur where there is no power of fine.

And the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  this new sub-clause (2) of clause 31 has been introduced, is proof  enough\r\n\r\nthat the Government have accepted the logic of our arguments because if you will\r\n\r\nremember,  Sir,  this  sub-clause (2) was never in the  original  Bill.

Therefore, it can be open to a lot of interpretation.\r\n\r\nBut I want to bring your attention back to the plot of the P.A.P. If you will remember, Sir, in the Elections Ordinance, section 51, sub-section (1) says, Sir:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Every person who forges or fraudulently defaces or fraudulently destroys\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the words are: \"Every person who fraudulently defaces\". It does not say\r\n\r\n\"intentionally defaces\" and these words \"intentionally defaces\" have been put in\r\n\r\nto  fit in with their plot of forcing the voters to go to vote and to force  the\r\n\r\nvoter to choose between unacceptable alternatives. The heavy penalty, of course,\r\n\r\nis  to deter the voter from even showing his protest and disgust at the question\r\n\r\nposed  to  him  by  defacing the ballot paper. I am sure  you  can  imagine  the\r\n\r\nsituation, Sir, where such revolting and unacceptable alternatives are presented\r\n\r\nto you and in showing your disgust you possibly may scribble all over the ballot\r\n\r\npaper,  draw  any picture you like, or even make the words on the  ballot  paper\r\n\r\nillegible,  and  under  those  circumstances, it is  considered  that  you  have\r\n\r\nintentionally defaced the ballot paper and you are supposed to be  punished  for\r\n\r\nthis  offence. We consider that if such a voter is faced with such  unacceptable\r\n\r\nalternatives, there is no other way for him to show his disgust. He  is  already\r\n\r\nforced to go along to the voting booth and forced to write something on the  ballot  paper. In the circumstances, there is nothing more fitting than to scribble\r\n\r\nall over the ballot paper. Yet the Government want to consider this natural reaction criminal, if anything, it is definitely\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nnot  criminal.  I do not think I have to go further into this.  But  I  have  to\r\n\r\nexpose  this  falsehood and lie of the P.A.P. that it was the intention  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and  the  pro-Communists  to  deface  the  ballot  paper,  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment have to counter this so-called Communist move by putting in the blank\r\n\r\nballot paper clause. This original amendment, as I have already pointed out, was\r\n\r\nmoved by the Member for Anson. If they want to pinpoint that as a Communist or a\r\n\r\npro-Communist  move, then I suggest that they ask the Member for  Anson  for  an\r\n\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Mammen.

It refers to a person\r\n\r\nwho intentionally defaces or destroys a ballot paper. It makes him guilty of  an\r\n\r\noffence  and it gives the court a discretion to imprison him up to a year.  Sir,\r\n\r\nfair  enough, there is a discretion. But then it makes it a compulsion that  for\r\n\r\nthree  years thereafter he is incapable of being registered as an elector or  of\r\n\r\nvoting  at  a  referendum  or  of  voting at any election  under  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly Elections Ordinance, or of being elected a Member  of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly. If he is a Member of the Legislative  Assembly, he  must\r\n\r\nforthwith  vacate his seat. What is the purpose of this sadistic provision,  for\r\n\r\nsadistic it is, Sir? Here is a man who is destroying his own ballot paper. I say\r\n\r\nit to you, Mr Mammen, that nowhere in the world can you find the equal of this.\r\n\r\nIf  they  tell you they have got it from section 51 of the Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nElections Ordinance, let me read it to you-section 51(1) (a) - look at the  scheme\r\n\r\nof  that  clause, the words are -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'forges or fraudulently defaces or fraudulently\r\n\r\ndestroys  any nomination paper, or delivers to the Returning Officer any  nomination paper knowing the same to be forged,'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nSir, the word 'fraudulent' is defined in the\r\n\r\nPenal Code as a fraud. A fraud is to seek\r\n\r\nto bring about loss or gain, dishonestly.\r\n\r\nI  think to bring about loss or gain to any particular person. The whole  scheme\r\n\r\nis  there to show you that the purpose is to defraud in some way the public  and\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore by an act whereby the document is  forged  or  is  so\r\n\r\ndefaced  that  it can be deemed to be somebody else's or in favour  of  somebody\r\n\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nThere is no question where you destroy\r\n\r\nyour own for purposes of negativing any vote at all. You are defrauding nobody.\r\n\r\nBut look, Sir, I know that this has been argued and I have not sought to prolong\r\n\r\nthe debate. If it is thought necessary to make it an offence, by all means leave\r\n\r\nit  to  a Judge. I say at least give him the discretion to fine. You know,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  in  Western  Samoa  where the United Nations  was  in  control,  being  in\r\n\r\npossession  of  a ballot paper was one of the very few offences,  and  that  was\r\n\r\nmerely  punishable  by  50  pounds maximum.

After a lot of argument in the Select Committee, the Government agreed to\r\n\r\nmake a distinction between the intentional defacement or intentional destruction\r\n\r\nof one's own ballot paper and the ballot paper belonging to another. It was as a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  representation from Opposition Members of the Select  Committee\r\n\r\nthat clause 32 (2) was put into this Bill, which\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nprovides  for a lesser penalty of imprisonment up to one year and a  deprivation\r\n\r\nof civic rights up to three years.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, on the question of the deprivation of civic rights, it is\r\n\r\nnecessary  that  the deprivation should be indicated by the Legislature  itself,\r\n\r\notherwise  it would result in inequalities if the deprivation were to vary  from\r\n\r\nperson  to person, should the power to deprive be left to the discretion of  the\r\n\r\nCourt.  As  I have pointed out before, these are grave offences, and it  is  the\r\n\r\npractice in the framing of legislation to provide penalties of imprisonment  for\r\n\r\ngrave  offences. If they are light and trivial offences, the appropriate penalty\r\n\r\nwould  be a fine. As these are grave offences, they are appropriately punishable\r\n\r\nwith imprisonment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, I notice that this provision has generated\r\n\r\na  lot of heat from the Member for Anson.

But I would like you  to  understand,  Mr\r\n\r\nMammen,  that  the  Opposition did not agree that the defacement  of  one's  own\r\n\r\nballot paper was a matter of gravity, and I am more than surprised that the  Minister  should so consider it, because whom does it harm, Sir? Wherein  lies  the\r\n\r\ngravity  of  destroying your own ballot paper? The Opposition never agreed  that\r\n\r\nthat should be punishable with one year. We leave it alone now, Sir, and make it\r\n\r\nmaximum, because after all you are leaving it to the good sense of a Judge.  And\r\n\r\nI  say,  give  him  the  option of a fine.

That is correct. But it can be specified as an exercise of discretion\r\n\r\non  the part of a Judge. He can be given the discretion to exercise his right to\r\n\r\ndeclare  that  the  person  is  prohibited from participating  in  elections  or\r\n\r\nstanding  for elections himself or sitting in the Assembly. But he is  not  even\r\n\r\ngiving the Judge that discretion, Sir. The man who defaces his ballot paper will\r\n\r\nhave  to suffer as a matter of legal requirement. The Judge has no power.  There\r\n\r\nis in fact in these clauses considerable contempt shown for judicial discretion.\r\n\r\nThey  will  allow him to exercise the right to decide how much imprisonment  the\r\n\r\nman should get, but they will not allow him to decide whether the man should  be\r\n\r\ndeprived  of his civic rights or for how many years he should be deprived.  That\r\n\r\nis mandatory.

If  you\r\n\r\nleave  it  to  a  judicial  discretion, it would mean that  varying  periods  of\r\n\r\ndeprivation  will  be imposed.That is quite wrong.

We seem to have thrashed this out and  I  am\r\n\r\nvery sorry indeed that the Government has not seen its way to concede what is  a\r\n\r\nvery  important principle. Let us assume, and I am not satisfied  that  this  is\r\n\r\ncorrect, that a uniform period of deprivation of civic rights is necessary.  Let\r\n\r\nus  assume that for the moment, although no precedent has been indicated. I say,\r\n\r\nwhat  is wrong with giving the Judge the discretion in deciding whether to apply\r\n\r\nthat deprivation or not? Have we not any trust, any confidence in our Judges? Is\r\n\r\nthis  seriously  the  P.A.P. approach to the judiciary which  has  for  so  long\r\n\r\nstriven  and  so well earned its reputation, for being balanced,  for  being  of\r\n\r\nintegrity  beyond  any shadow of doubt? What is the P.A.P. afraid  of?  I  will\r\n\r\nwithdraw  the word \"afraid\". Why does the P.A.P. not wish to leave the  matter  to\r\n\r\nthe  discretion  of  our courts? If not the period, at least the  issue  whether\r\n\r\nthere  should or should not be disqualification, this deprivation of citizenship\r\n\r\nrights. I am not saying it is too harsh in certain circumstances, but I do  urge\r\n\r\nthat  the  principle  be  respected that where  this  Assembly  sets  a  maximum\r\n\r\nsentence, the Judge be given discretion whether to apply it or not.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Mammen, similar provisions are scattered throughout the law.\r\n\r\nThere  are  many, many provisions laying down similar deprivations, deprivations\r\n\r\nnot affecting civic rights, but \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwhich  are  nevertheless deprivations.

Similarly,  in\r\n\r\nsmuggling  offences, if one uses motor-cars or other movable  property  for  the\r\n\r\ncommission  of  these  offences,  one can be deprived  of  that  property.

The P.A.P. has been very meticulous  in  the\r\n\r\ncopying of sections from the Elections Ordinance when it happens to suit them.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>10.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I refer you to our Elections Ordinance, section 72, subsection (1)? It\r\n\r\nsays here, Sir:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No badge, symbol, rosette, favour, set of colours, flag, advertisement,\r\n\r\nhandbill,  placard  or poster or any replica of a voting paper  shall  be  worn,\r\n\r\nused,  carried  or displayed by any person or on any motor-car, truck  or  other\r\n\r\nvehicle as political propaganda on polling day:'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the P.A.P. have always been quoting sections from the Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance  and  since  we  are  supposed to model our  Referendum  Bill  on  the\r\n\r\nElections  Ordinance,  may I suggest that they accept our amendment,  because  I\r\n\r\nhave  lifted our amendment, word for word, from section 72, sub-section  (1)  of\r\n\r\nthis Elections Ordinance? I do not think they can have any complaints, because I\r\n\r\nonly  seek  that  they allow us canvassing as is allowed now  in  the  Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  I  have  already touched on the fact that the referendum  period  is\r\n\r\nextended  from  seven to, as we understand, fourteen days. That means  that  the\r\n\r\nperiod in which they want to stop us from doing things will be extended. This is\r\n\r\na period most vital for canvassing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Government have full control of the radio, Rediffusion, and even the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  The  Opposition Parties have no opportunities of  putting  up  even\r\n\r\nposters.  They  have all these facilities - printing and putting  up  posters  and\r\n\r\nsending out pamphlets all the time. We are only asking that we be allowed to  do\r\n\r\nthe  same. We are not asking anything extraordinary. As it is, they are  already\r\n\r\ntrying  to limit publicity of the debate. Instances have been quoted to  you  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  trying to limit newspaper space for the Opposition  Parties.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to quote to you again, Sir, the words of the Prime Minister himself,\r\n\r\nwords which I quoted two days ago. The Prime Minister in 1955 said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'. . . we either believe in democracy or we do not.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you believe in democracy, you must believe in it unconditionally. If you believe that men should be free, then they should have the right of free\r\n\r\nassociation,  of  free speech, of free publication. Then no  law  should  permit\r\n\r\nthose democratic processes to\r\n\r\nbe set at nought. . . '.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nSir,  these  are  the words of the Prime Minister himself. Yet we  see  the  Government  trying  to  limit these same activities on the part of  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nParties.  The Minister said that during the referendum period only  the  Superintendent  should  be allowed to put up posters because, according  to  him,  only\r\n\r\nGovernment  posters  will  put up a factual report  of  whatever  they  want  to\r\n\r\npropagandise. The implication being, Sir, that if the Opposition Parties  should\r\n\r\nput  up posters, then these posters will all be on falsehoods or distortions.  I\r\n\r\nventure  to  suggest, Sir, that the Government in fact are doing  exactly  that.\r\n\r\nThey  have  put up a lot of posters, giving a distorted version of Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nmerger to the people. They are, in fact, using public funds for their own  party\r\n\r\npropaganda.  These  are points which we in the Opposition have  tried  to  bring\r\n\r\nforward  and  which  the  P.A.P. have prevented us from getting  across  to  the\r\n\r\npublic. I do not intend to speak very much more now-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Thank goodness!\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But just to tell the Government that if they really intend\r\n\r\nto  allow canvassing, let there be full canvassing.

It is only after all the facts have been  put\r\n\r\nbefore him that the voter will be able to make his own decision.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might mention, Sir, the difficulties that have been put in our way of\r\n\r\nrallies  and meetings. In many places we have to apply for a permit  first  from\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council for the use of the land, and after that a police  permit.  On\r\n\r\nmany  occasions  permits  were  issued only at the  very  last  minute  so  that\r\n\r\npreparations for such meetings and rallies were restricted and hamstrung. Again,\r\n\r\non many occasions our requests for rallies were rejected on the poor excuse that\r\n\r\ncertain playgrounds and parks could only be used during general elections. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know,  Sir,  whether or not such areas and parks and  playgrounds  will  be\r\n\r\nallowed  during  the referendum period when full canvassing is  supposed  to  be\r\n\r\nallowed and referendum meetings are permitted to be held. But this amendment  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Home Affairs makes nonsense of the original promise  to  allow\r\n\r\nfull canvassing as in a general election. We cannot possibly canvass without the\r\n\r\nuse of posters. The Minister himself should know that posters have to be put  up\r\n\r\nin  places  to inform the people of the facts when we cannot personally  deliver\r\n\r\nthat message. People may be working; very few people may be in their houses; and\r\n\r\nwe  may  not  meet all the people we would like to meet when we  go  around  canvassing.  But  if  we are allowed posters, at least there is  a  possibility  of\r\n\r\npeople looking at the posters and seeing the other side of the picture from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's. As it is, only the Government have such facilities. We  feel   the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nare  taking  an unfair advantage of the Opposition Parties. Let the  P.A.P. not\r\n\r\nmake a farce of their promise to allow full canvassing.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before closing, I might add that it was the original intention of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nto prohibit canvassing completely. If\r\n\r\nyou remember, Sir, the original intention of the P.A.P. was to put one question,\r\n\r\nbut  later  on when they realised that their own merger proposals would  not  be\r\n\r\nacceptable to the people, they conceived the two-question snap referendum  plot.\r\n\r\nThere  is provision for the P.A.P. to take advantage of the confusion that  will\r\n\r\nbe caused in the minds of the people by their posing of\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ntwo  questions. Now that they have this blank paper saviour sure-win clause they\r\n\r\nhave  relaxed  on  canvassing.  But  in spite  of  their  wanting  to  relax  on\r\n\r\ncanvassing, they insist on restricting canvassing to the minimum. Their  present\r\n\r\namendment seeks to do just that. They want to say that there is canvassing,  and\r\n\r\nto  give the appearance that they are democrats; but, in actual fact, they  want\r\n\r\nto  make  sure that canvassing on the part of the Opposition will be limited  as\r\n\r\nmuch  as  possible. Possibly, Sir, it is because the P.A.P. themselves  have  no\r\n\r\nmore  organisation  to  go out canvassing nowadays and have  to  depend  on  the\r\n\r\npropaganda machinery of the Government to do P.A.P. work.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>10.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Nonsense!\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister says nonsense.

I  cannot agree to what he has said in relation to  his  amendment  to\r\n\r\nclause  41. He has just now mentioned his so-called reasons when he says that  a\r\n\r\nnational referendum has nothing to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ndo  with a general election; and it has nothing to do with political Parties  be\r\n\r\ncause  there are no candidates waiting to be elected, and it is rather different\r\n\r\nfrom a general election. No political Parties or candidates are involved. But  I\r\n\r\nam  of the opinion that his reasoning is groundless, because up till now we know\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government in the national referendum will pose two  questions  which\r\n\r\nwill  be framed according to the Government's interpretation of what the  stands\r\n\r\nof the other political Parties are in relation to merger. Therefore, it is clear\r\n\r\nthat  during  the process of holding a national referendum, there will  be  much\r\n\r\nsignificance  of  party  politics. That also is to be seen  from  the  form  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is going to pose the two questions and how the Government will  frame\r\n\r\nthe  two questions. According to the Government's explanation, one question will\r\n\r\nrepresent the standpoint of the Party in power; the other question will  be  the\r\n\r\nso-called  stand  of  the Opposition Parties as interpreted by  the  Government.\r\n\r\nTherefore, what the Minister for Home Affairs has said just now, that  there  is\r\n\r\nno  party politics in a national referendum, cannot hold water. Therefore, it is\r\n\r\nnecessary to have sufficient time for the political Parties concerned to explain\r\n\r\ntheir stands and views. Although the controversy over the question of merger has\r\n\r\nbeen  going  on for quite a long time, the form of the questions in relation  to\r\n\r\nmerger has only recently become slightly clearer. One thing that should be noted\r\n\r\nespecially  is  that  we  intend to move a motion to  condemn  the  Government's\r\n\r\ndistortion of our stand. Therefore, it is all the more necessary to let us  have\r\n\r\nsufficient time to explain to the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us assume that the Government does not distort our stand,\r\n\r\nassuming that the other question to be posed by the Government is also our stand\r\n\r\non  merger. But this House has never had sufficient time to debate our stand and\r\n\r\nour  explanation in relation to our merger proposals, such as the form, the time\r\n\r\nand  consequences of merger. Therefore, under these circumstances, granted  that\r\n\r\nthe Government does not distort our stand, it is only fair\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthat it should allow us to have more time during a national referendum to do our\r\n\r\ncanvassing work.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs has just now said that there are\r\n\r\nmany  forms  of  canvassing, and that it is not necessary  to  use  placards  or\r\n\r\nposters.  We  cannot agree with him because nobody can deny  that  the  cartoons\r\n\r\ndrawn  on  the  placards  and  posters will be more  effective  than  words  in\r\n\r\nexplaining  the  various stands and views. An example can be  drawn  from  advertising  companies which advertise mainly by means of cartoons drawn on  placards\r\n\r\nand posters rather than by using words.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the amendment of the Minister for Home Affairs that - I draw your\r\n\r\nattention to the proviso- \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Provided that the provisions of this subsection shall\r\n\r\nnot apply to the use or display of any symbol, set of colours, flag, banner or\r\n\r\nplacard on the day and at the site of a referendum meeting.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>We  know  the period of the national referendum is rather short. During  such  a\r\n\r\nshort  period  political Parties find it impossible to have sufficient  time  to\r\n\r\ncarry on canvasting in various parts of the island and to hold meetings.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has passed the most important provision\r\n\r\nrelating  to  blank votes and the provision prohibiting the people  to  say  no.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  on the question of a national referendum, fundamentally  the  Government  has  already assured itself that it will never be defeated; it will  never\r\n\r\nlose.  Therefore, why should the Government be afraid of letting the  Opposition\r\n\r\nParties  carry out canvassing, put up posters, placards and cartoons in  various\r\n\r\nparts  of  the  island  to  criticise  the Government?  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of this kind of provision by the Government enables us to see  more\r\n\r\nclearly  that it will not allow the people to say no to its Merger  White  Paper\r\n\r\nand to show their protest. The Government will also not allow the people to cast\r\n\r\nblank  votes as a form of protest against it. Therefore, there remains only  one\r\n\r\nform,  that  is,  the  general  use  of  posters  and  placards  to  show  their\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction and protest.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>10.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must know that this form of showing protest by displaying placards and\r\n\r\nposters  is a peaceful way of showing our feelings. But the Government wants  to\r\n\r\nprohibit even this peaceful way of showing the anger of the people. What is  the\r\n\r\nmotive  of the Government? By so doing the Government would only make  us  query\r\n\r\nwhy it wants to have the establishment of another infantry regiment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am of the opinion that this kind of measure by the Government would not encourage the Opposition Parties to abide peacefully by\r\n\r\nconstitutional means of expressing their wishes. This intention on the  part  of\r\n\r\nthe Government is very vicious.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nThe  Government has now drafted this provision as such. If it wants  to  explain\r\n\r\naway,  it is only because the P.A.P. today cannot get enough supporters to paste\r\n\r\nup its own posters and placards at the various places throughout the island.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, as a result of the debate on this Bill, especially On clause\r\n\r\n41,  in  the Committee of the whole Assembly, the people of Singapore know  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  being gagged by the P.A.P.

The Government can use the radio and the Press to air the Government's views. They can\r\n\r\nthus  influence the electors in the coming referendum as to what they should  do\r\n\r\nin  the  national referendum. However, the Opposition Parties do  not  have  the\r\n\r\nright to make use of the radio or Rediffusion to make known their views to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Under these circumstances, we, the Opposition Parties should  have  the\r\n\r\nfull  right to demand that in this National Referendum Bill we should he allowed\r\n\r\nto  put  up  banners, posters and placards so as to enable us, in a  simple  and\r\n\r\nconcise  manner,  to  tell the people how they should  decide  in  the  national\r\n\r\nreferendum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a little while ago I said that in the past one year the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has made full use of all its propaganda machinery to  propogate  its\r\n\r\npolicies.  But we the Opposition Parties cannot do so. You will receive  that  my\r\n\r\nParty  and  some  other trade unions have put up banners to  oppose  the  phoney\r\n\r\nmerger plan of the Government, however, every branch of my Party and other trade\r\n\r\nunions have received notices from the Chief Building Surveyor that we must apply\r\n\r\nfor a permit before we could put up banners. It is impossible to ask us to apply\r\n\r\nfor  a permit, if my memory is correct, one square foot of the placard costs  us\r\n\r\nabout  75  cents.  Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not even have the  right  to  put  up\r\n\r\nbanners  and  posters. We have been deprived of this right  by  the  Government.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. headquarters and the commuunity centres and P.A.P.

Only then can we apply to the police for a permit to hold\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>10.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will realise that places belonging to the City Council and\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Works  Department  are under the control  of  the  Government.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  can, before the National Referendum period, allot lands  and  places\r\n\r\nlike parks and parking lots for the Government to hold mass rallies. Under these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, when we apply to the City Council or the Public Works  Department\r\n\r\nfor permission to use these places, our applications are sure to be rejected  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  Therefore, we can say that in the coming national  referendum,\r\n\r\nwe,  the  Opposition  Parties,  will  not have  any  opportunity  to  apply  for\r\n\r\npermission to use lands in the urban area, because these places will  have  been\r\n\r\nallocated to the Government and we will be deprived of our right to use them.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>10.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>   [Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, speaking about the rural areas, how does the Government control\r\n\r\nthe holding of mass rallies? It is very simple. The national referendum will  be\r\n\r\nconducted by the Minister for Home Affairs and permits to hold mass rallies will\r\n\r\nalso have to be approved by the police who are under the control of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home Affairs. Before we send in our applications, the Government can notify\r\n\r\nthe  police stations in advance that the Government wishes to hold mass  rallies\r\n\r\nat  certain  places, in the rural areas especially, there is limited  space  for\r\n\r\nholding such rallies in a central position. If we Opposition Parties send in our\r\n\r\napplications, I am sure, Mr Mammen, that our applications will be  rejected  by\r\n\r\nthe authorities concerned.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, you can see very clearly that the P.A.P. Government can make\r\n\r\nuse of all the advantageous conditions, but, on the other hand, they deprive  us\r\n\r\nof the right to hold mass rallies. Under these circumstances, we are not able to\r\n\r\nhold mass rallies, in the same way, we cannot display our placards, banners  and\r\n\r\nposters.  Mr  Mammen, you can see very clearly from this that the  Government's\r\n\r\ncunning  policy is intended to deceive us. They think that we are  inexperienced\r\n\r\nand  that  we  do not know the plot of the Government. Mr Mammen,  if  the  Govermnent  are trying to restrict the Opposition Parties from putting  up  banners\r\n\r\nand  posters  during the national referendum period, it is clear that  they  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  restrict  and prevent the Opposition Parties  from  conveying  their\r\n\r\nopinions to the people under the name of democracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, just now my colleague, the Member for Upper Serangoon, has\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the question of merger has been debated for nearly a year,  but  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has completely distorted our stand on the question of merger and  our\r\n\r\nviews  on  the question of merger. Next week we shall debate a motion tabled  by\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister. From this you will see very clearly that the Government have\r\n\r\ncompletely distorted our stand. Therefore, we the Opposition Parties have  every\r\n\r\nreason  to demand that during the national referendum period we should have  all\r\n\r\nfacilities, the minimum requirement for carrying out our propaganda  work,  such\r\n\r\nas  putting  up  banners,  posters and placards. If  the  Government  are  fully\r\n\r\nconfident,  why  should they be afraid that we in the Opposition  would  put  up\r\n\r\nposters and banners? Why do they fear us?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government say that Communist subversive elements are trying to wreck the\r\n\r\nnational  referendum,  but  the  Government  Ministers,  especially  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, have said that in Singapore there are only 300 Communists. So how  can\r\n\r\nthese 300 Communists influence the people in the 51 constituencies? Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  we must not be blind to the undemocratic national referendum Bill. We must\r\n\r\nnot overlook this and we must not overlook the right of the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\npeople to air their views on the question of merger.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, the amendment moved by the Member for Queenstown is based on a\r\n\r\nprovision  from  the Singapore Legislative Elections Ordinance. I  remember  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs, when introducing the Second Reading of the Bill, said\r\n\r\nthe  drafting  of  this  Bill  was based on the Singapore  Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nElections  Ordinance. If this Bill is based on the Elections Ordinance,  why  do\r\n\r\nthe  Government  not give the Opposition Parties the right to  put  up  posters,\r\n\r\nbanners  and  placards and sufficient time to do so? Mr  Mammen,  Sir,  we  can\r\n\r\nclearly see that the P.A.P. Government are now trying to use all sorts of unfair\r\n\r\nmethods  and  unfair provisions to prevent the people of Singapore  from  airing\r\n\r\ntheir  views. Today the people of Singapore can very clearly understand that  in\r\n\r\nthe  coming national referendum they are forced to accept poison from the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThey  will  not  be able to express their dissatisfaction and their  views.  Mr\r\n\r\nMammen, Sir, I feel that since the Government, from the provisions of this Bill,\r\n\r\nwill  be  enjoying all sorts of facilities, our minimum demand is  that  in  the\r\n\r\ncoming  national  referendum they should give us ample time to put  up  banners,\r\n\r\nplacards  and  posters;  otherwise it will only  go  to  show  that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment are not sincere and honest but are dictatorial on the question of the\r\n\r\nnational referendum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Actually, Mr\r\n\r\nMammen, what difference does it make whether or not we can freely have political\r\n\r\npropaganda  during the period of the referendum?

Mr Mammen, we are applying for a permit  to  hold  a  mass\r\n\r\nrally  on  the 15th of July, two weeks from now, and we have been  told  by  the\r\n\r\npolice  that  we  must submit, for instance, our list of speakers,  the  subject\r\n\r\nmatter, how many loudspeakers we are going to use - 4, 12, 100 or 200 \r\n\r\n- how many lorries, what we are going to put as our platform; and we have to send\r\n\r\nour  banners to the police station to be chopped, signed and sealed.  There  are\r\n\r\nalso many other restrictions.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>11.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, these are unfair restrictions. We are not given the right to go to Hong Lim Park under the excuse of the City Council Park Rules, which do not say\r\n\r\nthat  nobody cannot use the Park except during by-election time. We  are  afraid\r\n\r\nthat  these  restrictions will also be exercised by the Government  and  thereby\r\n\r\nrestrict Opposition Parties from exposing the sham referendum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, we know the result. It is a foregone conclusion. But we want to use\r\n\r\nevery opportunity we can to expose this sham referendum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Mammen, the main intention of the amendment introduced by the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home Affairs is to restrict canvassing during the period  of  the\r\n\r\nreferendum. Now everybody is aware and it is an open secret that the  Government\r\n\r\nis  trying to suppress Press reports. Its means of suppressing these reports are\r\n\r\nrather  subtle,  and I believe the Member for Anson explained it yesterday.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment has given an order to the Press that they could only publish  30  per\r\n\r\ncent  of the views of the Opposition Parties, and that this is true can be  seen\r\n\r\nfrom reading this morning's newspapers. In this morning's Sin Chew Jit Poh.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): Order. The Press reports which the Member is going\r\n\r\nto  quote no doubt have been drawn from the debate here in this Assembly, and by\r\n\r\nquoting  them he is merely repeating them. However, I cannot understand how  all\r\n\r\nthat has any relevance to the amendment moved by the Member for Queenstown.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Mammen,  I have to point it out because it is connected with the  political\r\n\r\npropaganda  which  the  Government is suppressing, a  suppression  to  stop  the\r\n\r\nOpposition Parties from opening their mouths.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this: at one time when the Opposition Parties wanted to hold\r\n\r\nmass  rallies  to raise the standard of political education of the people, they\r\n\r\nsuffered suppression. This suppression is, however, more severe than that during\r\n\r\nthe Lim Yew Hock Government.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that the P.A.P. Government today can be regarded by the\r\n\r\npeople  and,  in  fact,  the people of Malaysia, as a Party  that  distorts  the\r\n\r\npolitical  stand  of the Opposition Parties. The Government  has  distorted  our\r\n\r\nstand on merger by saying that we want the Penang/Malacca type of merger.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

For instance, the P.A.P. always say that the term \"national\"\r\n\r\nis  the same and equivalent to \"citizen\". You cannot find such an explanation in\r\n\r\nany dictionary. They also talk about autonomy in education and, labour which  we\r\n\r\nknow is useless\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwithout internal security, it is only a psychological way to cheat the people by\r\n\r\nthe use of such terms.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. are resorting to all kinds of means to attack the Opposition\r\n\r\nParties.  They  are  exerting their utmost to carry out their  schemes,  through\r\n\r\ntheir  use  of the radio, the Press, etc. The Ministry of Culture has also  been\r\n\r\nmade  use  of  to spread their party propaganda at the expense of public  funds.\r\n\r\nThat is the fifth point.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these points that I have mentioned, you can see that during the period of\r\n\r\nthe national referendum, political Parties of the Opposition are prohibited from\r\n\r\ncampaigning  and giving publicity to their stand. This restriction is  therefore\r\n\r\nadvantageous  to  the  Government. But something more regrettable  is  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  since  their inception, have always been boasting about  educating  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  raising their political consciousness. But today we  see  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. want to stop people from carrying out political education and  political\r\n\r\ncampaigns to educate and to raise the political consciousness of our people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this we can clearly see that the P.A.P., as a political Party, has lost\r\n\r\nwhat  it stood for.

He now very strongly\r\n\r\ncriticises the Government that there has been Press intimidation. When the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember and his colleagues were sitting on that side of the House two and a  half\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  we stood up in this House and criticised and accused the Government\r\n\r\nof suggested intimidation of the Press. But all the Barisan Sosialis Members who\r\n\r\nwere then sitting there were laughing, giggling and enjoying themselves with the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. They are now having a dose of the medicine that they gave to us.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Barisan Sosialis Members took about 90 minutes of the time of this\r\n\r\nHouse  to say nothing except repeat, repeat and repeat. They have lost sight  of\r\n\r\nwhat  they are fighting for. They have charged that they would not be given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to go out and distort as much as they would like to distort.  There\r\n\r\nis  nothing  in this proposed amendment moved by the Minister to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Members  cannot go out and talk to their hearts' content.  If,  in  all\r\n\r\ntheir attacks against the P.A.P., they could say that at least the Lim Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment  was  not so bad, I might feel a bit delighted.  What  they  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to  carry is this. They will not be allowed to carry flags, banners  or\r\n\r\nplacards  when  they  go out canvassing. They can go out  and  distribute  their\r\n\r\nliterature to the households, and they can talk as much as they want.  They  can\r\n\r\ncarry their symbol, that is, their star \r\n\r\n- their  new star that was born during a bad time. They can use their  own  Party\r\n\r\nsymbol. They can carry their Party flag. But what they are not allowed to do  is\r\n\r\nto  carry a big banner and placards and what not. I do not know what restriction\r\n\r\nthere  is.  As far as I know, there hive been elections ever since 1948,  and  I\r\n\r\nhave  not  seen  P.A.P. canvassers going round the  houses  carrying  placards,\r\n\r\nbanners and flags. That has never been\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ndone.  Perhaps the Barisan is thinking of carrying banners and flags. What  for?\r\n\r\nThey  could  go  to the houses and talk to the voters as much as they  like.  In\r\n\r\nfact, they have already done it. They can canvass as much as they want. They can\r\n\r\ngo  and distribute their literature. There is nothing to prevent them from doing\r\n\r\nthat. They can distribute pamphlets and anything they want. The only thing  they\r\n\r\nare  asked  not to do is to carry banners, placards and flags. If they  want  to\r\n\r\ncarry a little flag showing their star, no one is going to prevent them. So  why\r\n\r\nmust  they  waste  the  time of this Assembly by talking  on  irrelevancies  and\r\n\r\nfighting for something which no one wants? No canvasser has ever gone to  houses\r\n\r\ncarrying  flags, banners and placards. That has never been done.  Why  do  they\r\n\r\nwant  to  do it now? I think I can understand why. The more they talk, the  more\r\n\r\nthey try to present their case, the more they try to object to things which  are\r\n\r\nnot  objectionable, the more they are making the people of Singapore come to the\r\n\r\nrealisation that the Barisan Sosialis is out to wreck merger; and the sooner the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore come to that realisation, the better it will be for all  of\r\n\r\nus, for our peace, happiness and our prosperity.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I will be very brief, Mr Mammen. I myself cannot understand, I\r\n\r\nmust  confess,  the heat which has been caused by this particular  part  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill. I would ask the Minister for Home Affairs this. He seems\r\n\r\nto  be generally of the view that party banners and party symbols can be carried\r\n\r\nduring  the  period  of the referendum. I would urge him to look  again  at  the\r\n\r\nclause  which speaks of all symbols, sets of colour, flags, banners or  placards\r\n\r\nwhich  are  political propaganda, Sir, not referendum propaganda.  No  political\r\n\r\npropaganda  may be utilised. None of this, how shall I say it, visual propaganda\r\n\r\nmay  be utilised during the referendum period.

I cannot see, and I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  understand - it  may  well be that I have  missed  that  aspect  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister's explanation - what really is the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nobjection  to the use of colours, symbols, banners, placards as referenda  propaganda?

But I cannot see what this provision is aimed  at.\r\n\r\nThat the Barisan is rather touthy is understandable, Sir, in the context of  the\r\n\r\nconduct of the Government today, and in recent times in preventing, for example,\r\n\r\nrallies  at  which  it  has been sought to explain the Referendum  Bill  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  You are no doubt fully aware, as are most citizens of Singapore,  of  a\r\n\r\nlegitimate  group of political Parties, through a Liaison Committee,  which  has\r\n\r\nsomewhat  the  grand  title  of  the Council of Joint  Action,  but  it  is  not\r\n\r\nparticularly a title of which I am proud. It is a Liaison Committee nevertheless\r\n\r\nof  perfectly  legitimate and honest political Parties  which  has  sought,  and\r\n\r\nrightly sought to obtain from the Government permission for the holding of  mass\r\n\r\nrallies to explain the dangers to which the people are about to be subjected  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of this referendum with its reference to the merger. And you know,  Mr\r\n\r\nMammen,  that the political Parties concerned have been refused permits for  the\r\n\r\nholding of these rallies.

From this\r\n\r\nwe can see that there is something important regarding the placards, banners and\r\n\r\nflags. We can also see that the P.A.P. Government is not democratic. It has come\r\n\r\nto  the  stage of dictatorship. Now I will describe how undemocratic  it  is.  I\r\n\r\nremember  that  in  the  past,  the  Lim  Yew  Hock  Government  was  also  very\r\n\r\nundemocratic.  They  adopted the same methods during  the  general  election  to\r\n\r\nrestrict the use of banners and flags.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>11.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put forward my views to the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership  and  they  remarked, \"Oh, the  Government  is  undemocratic,\r\n\r\notherwise we can put up our placards, banners and flags. So to make the best use\r\n\r\nof  the restriction, we must put up placards and banners in noisy places,  along\r\n\r\nthe main roads, in the streets, so that this thing can be made known to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmost  of the people or in a place where there are many residents.\" This explains\r\n\r\nthe importance of banners and flags. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  is  now  using  the same experience  of  the  Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment to impose more restrictive provisions.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you can see that the P.A.P. Government is using many Government departments, not only the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture,  the radio, but also the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry  of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs to intimidate. They make use of the post to convey messages and views to\r\n\r\nthe  people,  but they want to restrict the Opposition from using  placards  and\r\n\r\nbanners.  The  Government enjoy such facilities as the radio and Rediffusion  to\r\n\r\npropagate  and  paint beautiful pictures about Malaysia and  merger.  They  have\r\n\r\nalready  launched  a widespread propaganda campaign. Our position  is  different\r\n\r\nfrom  that  of the Government. We on the Opposition only want to put across  our\r\n\r\nviews  to  the  people and let them consider and make up their  own  minds.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  postcard says how beautiful and how good merger is, but  we  on  our\r\n\r\nside have to show to the people how ugly and distasteful it is. For instance,  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  placard  or  slogan  may  enthusiastically  support  the  merger  of\r\n\r\nSingapore with the Federation. Now this placard of the Government appears to  be\r\n\r\nvery pleasant, but to us, it is only a means of cheating the people. We have  to\r\n\r\nput  up  another slogan to counter such a Government action. We have to make  it\r\n\r\nknown that this is a phoney merger and\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  counter it. The people can make their own decision  on  these  two\r\n\r\nconflicting views. In the past, we talked about merger and the reunification  of\r\n\r\nthe two countries. We have already done this and left a very deep impression  in\r\n\r\nthe  minds of the people. Now the people may ask why is it that in the past, the\r\n\r\nOpposition Parties used to give them reasons as to why they were against merger,\r\n\r\nbut  have not done the same thing now? The Government on their part can make use\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministry  of Culture and other machinery to paste posters  and  banners\r\n\r\neverywhere. When\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe people look at them, they may feel disgusted and want the Opposition Parties\r\n\r\nalso  to  put up posters and other things to explain to them their views.  I  am\r\n\r\nonly  trying  to  explain  this  to show that  the  Government  should  let  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Parties carry out their publicity work because there is great  merit\r\n\r\nin  political  publicity,  e.g.,  educating the people  and  infusing  political\r\n\r\nconsciousness in them.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about banners and the like. I am of the opinion that during\r\n\r\nthe  national referendum period, people should be allowed to put up banners  and\r\n\r\nsuch things. Let me give an example. The P.A.P. Government asks their members to\r\n\r\ngo out and do publicity work to sell their merger plan to the people. But if the\r\n\r\npeople are not agreeable to these proposals, they may turn away when the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. members come with banners and\r\n\r\nsuch  things.  They may be very confusing to the people who may doubt  their  intentions.  When  faced with such a situation, the people may sometimes  feel  it\r\n\r\nunpleasant  to  rebut, or show their disgust to such people. So  an  opportunity\r\n\r\nshould  be given to the political Parties to put up their banners, placards  and\r\n\r\nother  things to express their views on merger and Malaysia, that is to say,  to\r\n\r\ngive a fair chance to all.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, the Member for Queenstown alleged a few minutes ago that the Government has\r\n\r\nnot  kept  its promise to the Opposition regarding its intention of what  to  do\r\n\r\nwith  this  clause  which was postponed in the Select Committee.  I  think,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  this allegation is very far from the truth. I  remember  that - unfortunately I have not got a copy of the letter with me - letters stating the  Government's  intention to the various points raised in the Select Committee,  were\r\n\r\nsent  to  all  the  Opposition Members as promised, a week before  the  Assembly\r\n\r\nmeeting. I remember that in the Select Committee I only promised to indicate the\r\n\r\nGovernment's intention to the Opposition Members. I do not remember that I  ever\r\n\r\nsaid that we would send the exact amendment of the clause to Opposition\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nMembers.  But  far  from  the Government breaking its promise,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  raised  the amendment long before he received the  letter  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Why not?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we heard a few moments ago a ridiculous\r\n\r\nsuggestion  from the Member for Queenstown that he wanted an opportunity  to  be\r\n\r\nable to carry banners and placards into the houses of electors to do canvassing.\r\n\r\nThis  is the most ridiculous suggestion I have ever heard of. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nif  you  know  how canvassing takes place during the election, you will  realise\r\n\r\nthat  in  canvassing, only literature - election pamphlets, election manifestoes,\r\n\r\nthe candidate's history - and pictures of the candidate are used, never banners.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>11.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said on the Second Reading of the Bill that canvassing would be allowed\r\n\r\nduring  the referendum as in the case of an election when canvassing is  allowed\r\n\r\nexcept  on polling day. And in the course of canvassing, the canvasser  can  distribute  whatever literature he wants to distribute. There is no prohibition  on\r\n\r\nthat.  It  is true that posters will be totally prohibited during the referendum\r\n\r\nperiod.  But, as I have pointed out earlier, if we allow posters to be displayed\r\n\r\nby  political Parties during the referendum period, then whatever posters put up\r\n\r\nby  the  Superintendent  which  are factual and  instructional  will  be  either\r\n\r\ncompletely blotted out or confused. As I said, this will be the first referendum\r\n\r\nthat  the  State  is  conducting, and it is necessary  that  such  instructional\r\n\r\nposters  put  up by the Superintendent should receive the prominence  that  they\r\n\r\ndeserve.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the allegation made by the Member for Choa Chu Kang that banners put up\r\n\r\nby  the Barisan Sosialis and the S.A.T.U. group of trade unions are not allowed,\r\n\r\nthe  simple reason is that under normal circumstances, before one can display  a\r\n\r\nbanner or poster, a permit\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nis  necessary from the Ministry of National Development. This the Barisan  Sosialis  and  the S.A.T.U. group of unions obviously did not intend to do. And  even\r\n\r\nwhen  notices  of warning were served on the Barisan Sosialis and  the  S.A.T.U.\r\n\r\nunions,  the notices were ignored and flouted. They had no intention of  obeying\r\n\r\nany rules.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was the allegation that\r\n\r\nP.A.P. banners were left without interference from the Government. I just  want\r\n\r\nto  inform the Member for Choa Chu Kang - in case he is still ignorant of the fact\r\n\r\n-  that all the banners put up by the P.A.P. at the P.A.P. branch premises  were\r\n\r\ntaken  from the Ministry of Culture.
