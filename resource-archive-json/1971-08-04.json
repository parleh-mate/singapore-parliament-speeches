It is anticipated that  by\r\n\r\n1975  there  will altogether be about 1.2  million\r\n\r\npeople  staying  in Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nfiats;  that  is  to say, another half  a  million\r\n\r\npeople will\r\n\r\nhave  been moved into the Board's houses. In  this\r\n\r\nrespect, we can be both pleased and proud  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard's plans and achievements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am now reminded of certain problems\r\n\r\nrelating to the allocation of flats. In my  \"meet-the-people\"  sessions, I hear complaints  from  my\r\n\r\nconstituents that they had applied to the  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development  Board to rent  the  two-room  or\r\n\r\nthree-room  flats without getting any  allocation,\r\n\r\nalthough  they had waited for two or three  years.\r\n\r\nAfter repeated inquiries, the reply given was that\r\n\r\nall  the newly-built two-room or three-room  flats\r\n\r\nwere mainly meant to be sold direct to members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public under the home ownership scheme.  Even\r\n\r\nif  there are occasional vacancies in such  flats,\r\n\r\nthey  will first be allotted to families  affected\r\n\r\nby  resettlement. People who are staying  in  one-room  flats  have to seek larger accommodation  if\r\n\r\nthe   membership  in  the  family  has  increased.\r\n\r\nHowever,  on  applying  to the  Board  for  larger\r\n\r\nflats,  their requests will usually be met with  a\r\n\r\nsimilar answer. There will also be a long delay of\r\n\r\ntwo  or  three  years before  a  reply  is  given.\r\n\r\nSometimes no reply is given. Even if they wish  to\r\n\r\nbuy such flats they will have to register\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafresh  and  queue  up. There is  no  priority  or\r\n\r\nconcession for them at all. At the earliest,  they\r\n\r\ncan  get  a new flat only after one or two  years'\r\n\r\nwaiting.  Usually, if everything goes  well,  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to  get  new  accommodation  after\r\n\r\nwaiting  for three or four years. No wonder  there\r\n\r\nare  complaints all round! I feel that the Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board should first clear up these\r\n\r\n\"old accounts\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards those who are affected by urban\r\n\r\nrenewal,   rural  redevelopment  and  resettlement\r\n\r\nschemes,   the  Government  has  announced   that,\r\n\r\nbecause of our improved economic situation  and  a\r\n\r\nbetter  capacity  to  pay the people  affected  by\r\n\r\nthem,  the rate of compensation will now be raised\r\n\r\nto  a  more rational level. Although this is  good\r\n\r\nnews,  these  people have to live in  a  different\r\n\r\nenvironment, and whether they have to change their\r\n\r\ncareers  or resume their old trade, the Government\r\n\r\nshould  make it a point to give them some sort  of\r\n\r\ntechnical assistance in addition to financial  aid\r\n\r\nor compensation. We know that usually in the past,\r\n\r\nin   order  to  clear  up  a  piece  of  land  for\r\n\r\nredevelopment  purposes within a stipulated  time,\r\n\r\nthe people staying on the land were cleared out by\r\n\r\nthe Resettlement Department in a haphazard manner.\r\n\r\nOnce  the people had been cleared out of the site,\r\n\r\nthe   move  was  regarded  as  a  success  by  the\r\n\r\ndepartment   concerned.  Whether  or   not   these\r\n\r\nresettled  people  can live on  the  new  site  is\r\n\r\nnobody's   business.  As  a  result,  we  received\r\n\r\ncomplaints from these people that long after  they\r\n\r\nhad  moved  into the new site there was  still  no\r\n\r\nwater  supply  and electricity,  let  alone  other\r\n\r\nsanitary  facilities. Even in their  newly-settled\r\n\r\nareas, they were usually interfered with by  other\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments  which  accused  them   of\r\n\r\nputting  up  illegal structures  without  sanitary\r\n\r\nfacilities  or of not having obtained any  permits\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Fire  Brigade. Some of them  have  been\r\n\r\nasked    to   remove   again   very   soon   after\r\n\r\nresettlement.  All  this  shows  the   result   of\r\n\r\ninsufficient  care  taken by  the  authorities  in\r\n\r\ndealing  with people affected by resettlement.  In\r\n\r\nrespect of industrialisation, we have the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board to help the industrialists set\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  factories.  Similarly, I hope  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill give the people affected by resettlement some\r\n\r\ntechnical  assistance to help them  rebuild  their\r\n\r\nhomesteads and avoid unnecessary loss or wastage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the start the President has said in his\r\n\r\nspeech  that  after six years of  independence  we\r\n\r\nhave  shown  that  Singapore  is  viable.  She  is\r\n\r\ngradually    developing   into   a   centre    for\r\n\r\nmanufacturing,   servicing,   communications   and\r\n\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the total withdrawal of British\r\n\r\ntroops, which will be completed by the end of  the\r\n\r\nyear,  facts show that we not only will  not  have\r\n\r\nlarge-scale  unemployment, but, on  the  contrary,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  economic progress, will be  short  of\r\n\r\nlabour,  particularly skilled  technical  workers.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  Government  has  adopted  a  more\r\n\r\nliberal  policy  in  regard  to  the  question  of\r\n\r\nissuing  work  permits to non-citizens.  This  new\r\n\r\npolicy  is  necessary  in  view  of  our  national\r\n\r\nservice  policy  which has absorbed  many  of  our\r\n\r\nyouths.  Many  non-citizens have been  engaged  in\r\n\r\nthese  jobs  instead, so that economic  production\r\n\r\nand  growth may be maintained. However, we  should\r\n\r\nconsider  whether or not the issuance of too  many\r\n\r\nwork  permits  to  non-citizens  will  affect  the\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities of our own citizens after\r\n\r\nthey   have  completed  their  term  of   national\r\n\r\nservice.  In  spite of Government legislation  for\r\n\r\ntheir protection, at present there are still  some\r\n\r\nemployers    who   employ   discharged    national\r\n\r\nservicemen in an opportunistic manner because they\r\n\r\nhave  no  confidence in them.  So  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  try to adopt proper measures to deal  with\r\n\r\nthis  situation so that employers will  have  more\r\n\r\nconfidence in discharged national servicemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvement will be made in the fields of\r\n\r\ntransportation  and  communications   to   achieve\r\n\r\nefficiency  and  speed. In view of the  increasing\r\n\r\nnumber of vehicles on the road, the Government has\r\n\r\nplans  to  improve  the  traffic  system,  and  an\r\n\r\nevaluation  of  a  mass rapid transit  system  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  also be made. However,  with  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  number  of  vehicles  and   the\r\n\r\nincrease in the number\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   accidents  on  the  road,  the  question   of\r\n\r\ninsurance cover for vehicles and accidents is also\r\n\r\nimportant.  There was a case of a  youth  who  was\r\n\r\nknocked  down  by  a  car and half  his  body  was\r\n\r\nparalysed.  The  court  awarded  the  youth  about\r\n\r\n$100,000 as compensation. But the youth could  not\r\n\r\nget  a  single  cent because the  driver  who  had\r\n\r\nknocked him down had given false particulars  when\r\n\r\napplying  for a policy from the insurance company.\r\n\r\nOn  this  ground, the insurance company disclaimed\r\n\r\nliability  and  refused to pay the youth.  Similar\r\n\r\ncases  have  happened before. Therefore,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to urge the Government to work out a  scheme\r\n\r\nwhereby victims of accidents or their families can\r\n\r\nget the compensation due to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Presidential speech, mention has also been\r\n\r\nmade of the reorganisation and improvement of  our\r\n\r\nsocial welfare services. This is, of course,  good\r\n\r\nnews.  But  I  would like to see a review  of  the\r\n\r\nscheme  of public assistance paid to the poor  and\r\n\r\nthe   sick   by  the  Social  Welfare  Department.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  the  present scheme,  the  guardian\r\n\r\nparent  of the sick or poor can get $21 per month,\r\n\r\nthe  spouse can get $10, and those children  under\r\n\r\n16  years  of  age can get $5 each, subject  to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum of $60 per month per family. We know  that\r\n\r\nthese  rates  were formulated in 1961.  Ten  years\r\n\r\nhave  passed. Following urban renewal  and  social\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  many people have  moved  to  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard flats. The cost of living has also risen  as\r\n\r\na  result. This meagre sum of money is not  enough\r\n\r\nto  pay  for food and rental. It can pay for  only\r\n\r\none  item. So I hope the Government can review the\r\n\r\npresent scheme of public assistance in order  that\r\n\r\nour economic growth may benefit all our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion of thanks by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Ulu Pandan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I consider it a great privilege to be able to\r\n\r\ntake this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  express our sincere  appreciation\r\n\r\nand  thanks  to the President for his most  timely\r\n\r\nstatement touching on the work of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs. We heartily welcome  and  endorse\r\n\r\nHis Excellency's statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now elaborate on the points raised by the\r\n\r\nMember for Toa Payoh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has maintained an ongoing review of\r\n\r\nexisting  social welfare facilities and programmes\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that their development is  in  keeping\r\n\r\nwith  national needs and aspirations. Towards this\r\n\r\nend,  the Minister for Social Affairs and  I  have\r\n\r\npersonally  visited the various  governmental  and\r\n\r\nvoluntary  welfare organisations and have  held  a\r\n\r\nseries  of  meetings  and  discussions  with   the\r\n\r\nofficials   concerned.  While  we  are   generally\r\n\r\nsatisfied   that  existing  welfare  services   do\r\n\r\nreflect the preventive, remedial and developmental\r\n\r\nfunctions  in social welfare, there appear  to  be\r\n\r\nstill  a  few areas of need which may justify  the\r\n\r\nintensification of efforts or the introduction  of\r\n\r\nnew  services, as, for example, the welfare of the\r\n\r\nvery young and the very old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should stress, however, that the material and\r\n\r\nmanpower  resources at present  available  do  not\r\n\r\npermit   a  rapid  expansion  of  existing  social\r\n\r\nwelfare  programmes; rather the aim should  be  an\r\n\r\nordered   transformation   of   existing   welfare\r\n\r\nservices  into well-organised operations involving\r\n\r\na maximum of community participation. This clearly\r\n\r\ncalls  for  a social development plan  with  well-defined  objectives. It is proposed to  set  up  a\r\n\r\nTraining  and Research Section within  the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Department which will concentrate  on  the\r\n\r\nproduction of a long-term plan for social  welfare\r\n\r\ndevelopment. Apart from working out the strategies\r\n\r\nfor  timely  social intervention and provision  of\r\n\r\nservices consonant with demonstrated needs, it  is\r\n\r\nalso  intended  to  examine the  desirability  and\r\n\r\nfeasibility of decentralising some of the existing\r\n\r\nwelfare  services  for  the convenience  of  those\r\n\r\nliving in major residential areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, where the situation warrants it,\r\n\r\nexisting services will be expanded or new services\r\n\r\nintroduced. Already the number of creches operated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby   the   Social  Welfare  Department  has   been\r\n\r\nincreased to 11 - the latest being the Jurong Town\r\n\r\nCreche  which was officially opened on 19th  June,\r\n\r\n1971.  Another new creche in the shopping  complex\r\n\r\nof  Toa Payoh New Town is expected to be ready  by\r\n\r\nearly 1972. The Government is also considering the\r\n\r\nneed  for new creches in other townships  such  as\r\n\r\nQueenstown, Woodlands and Telok Blangah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction of the new Junior Approved School\r\n\r\nand    Remand   Home   for   the   training    and\r\n\r\nrehabilitation of young offenders is  expected  to\r\n\r\nbe completed in September 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two new dormitories in Woodlands Home with\r\n\r\naccommodation for 136 elderly female persons  were\r\n\r\nofficially  opened On  2nd August, 1971,  and  two\r\n\r\nother similar dormitories will be built shortly to\r\n\r\ncomplete the extension project in this Home.  With\r\n\r\nthese extensions, the Woodlands Home for the  Aged\r\n\r\nwill have accommodation for 840 elderly persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More realistic training facilities are also being\r\n\r\nintroduced in all the Welfare Homes with a view to\r\n\r\nenabling  the  residents of  these  Homes  to  fit\r\n\r\nthemselves appropriately into the world of work on\r\n\r\ntheir   discharge  from  the  Homes.  As  far   as\r\n\r\npossible,   residents  will   be   provided   with\r\n\r\nvocational   training  commensurate   with   their\r\n\r\ninterests  and aptitudes so as to equip them  with\r\n\r\nthe   necessary  skills  to  meet  the  needs   of\r\n\r\nindustries.   Aftercare   work   is   also   being\r\n\r\nstrengthened by the introduction of an  employment\r\n\r\nplacement service for the discharged residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rehabilitation service, including employment\r\n\r\nplacement,   has  recently  been  introduced   for\r\n\r\nhandicapped persons. Consideration is  also  being\r\n\r\ngiven  to extending the existing Fostering  Scheme\r\n\r\nto  provide  for more foster homes  for  neglected\r\n\r\nchildren.  Improvements are  also  being  made  in\r\n\r\nrespect of adoption and family counselling work in\r\n\r\nthe Social Welfare Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of providing institutional\r\n\r\nfacilities  for non-destitute senior  citizens  on\r\n\r\npayment has been carefully studied by officials of\r\n\r\nmy Ministry and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial Welfare Department. As priority has  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  for the care of the needy aged, our present\r\n\r\nthinking  is that the provision of homes to  cater\r\n\r\nfor the elderly citizens who belong to the average\r\n\r\nmiddle   class   and   who  can   pay   for   such\r\n\r\naccommodation and services should best be left  to\r\n\r\nthe private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.56 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  we came to be independent in a strange  way.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  independence came  by  merger  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaysia and later, on 9th  August,\r\n\r\n1965, with our separation from the Federation,  we\r\n\r\nexperienced our second independence.  I  read  the\r\n\r\nPresident's  opening  words  in  his   speech   to\r\n\r\nParliament  to  mean just this. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhilst  it  is common for nations to extend  their\r\n\r\ndomains  outwards, it is not quite understood  why\r\n\r\nit  should  happen the other way round as  far  as\r\n\r\nSingapore was concerned on that fateful  day,  9th\r\n\r\nAugust,  1965.  The  other  new  states   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  were  warned of dire  consequences  if\r\n\r\nthey  thought fit to go the Singapore way. In  the\r\n\r\ncase of Singapore, it faced awesome troubles if it\r\n\r\ndid not separate. Was the action against Singapore\r\n\r\nmeant  to  squeeze the life out of it, or  was  it\r\n\r\nsimple    statesmanship?   Whatever    were    the\r\n\r\nconsiderations, Singapore was jettisoned to  fight\r\n\r\nfor   its   own   survival.  Was   economic   ruin\r\n\r\ninevitable,  and social discontent  and  political\r\n\r\nupheavals   to  be  a  commonplace   affair?   Was\r\n\r\npolitical  independence  expected  to   last   six\r\n\r\nmonths, 0 six years for that matter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should give us great pleasure to know that the\r\n\r\nPresident has forthrightly and confidently  stated\r\n\r\nthat  our viability, our ability to progress,  and\r\n\r\nour determination to remain independent is in good\r\n\r\nstate. The President's words reflect the heartfelt\r\n\r\naspirations of the people of our Republic and  the\r\n\r\nmotivations for our patriotic actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst it is important to engage\r\n\r\nourselves   in   economic   development,   it   is\r\n\r\nnevertheless  imperative and vital  that  we  also\r\n\r\nconcentrate our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresources and energies on building up our  defence\r\n\r\ncapability. Independence is futile if a nation has\r\n\r\nno  resolve  and capacity to fight to protect  its\r\n\r\nnational  sovereignty and integrity. Our  Republic\r\n\r\nwith its population of two million should have its\r\n\r\nentire  people ready to serve the country  in  its\r\n\r\nhour  of  need.  I  therefore  wholeheartedly  and\r\n\r\nfervently  support  the  Government's  policy   of\r\n\r\nmaking  use  of  all the precious  time  available\r\n\r\nuntil  the  withdrawal of the  British  forces  to\r\n\r\nintensify  the  building up of a reliable  defence\r\n\r\ncapability  which  can be reckoned  with  both  by\r\n\r\nfriend  and foe. In particular, our ground  forces\r\n\r\nshould possess the greatest striking capability to\r\n\r\noccupy strategic ground to ensure the flow of  the\r\n\r\nlife-blood  of  our  island, should  circumstances\r\n\r\ndemand  this  action. To achieve  this  objective,\r\n\r\nsufficient  support  of  our  ground  forces  with\r\n\r\narmoured  vehicles  and  air  elements  should  be\r\n\r\nreadily  available.  However,  it  must   not   be\r\n\r\nforgotten   that   our  70-mile  coastline   needs\r\n\r\nconstant  vigilance  against infiltration  in  the\r\n\r\nform  of  illegal immigration and piracy.  I  must\r\n\r\nexpress  my  concern over the gap in our  security\r\n\r\nand would urge the Government to take all measures\r\n\r\nnecessary to overcome occurrences of this nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I note the Government is paying\r\n\r\ndue  attention to increasing our water  resources.\r\n\r\nThis  is  an  area  of strategic  importance  that\r\n\r\nshould be taken care of. Should we be made anxious\r\n\r\nby  the  vagaries  of nature  and  the  whims  and\r\n\r\nfancies  of man? Arising from this point, I  think\r\n\r\nit  is important for every citizen to realize that\r\n\r\nwater is precious and that things should never  be\r\n\r\ntaken  for  granted. I would consider it  just  as\r\n\r\nimportant  to prevent the pollution of  our  water\r\n\r\nresources. Mr Speaker, Sir, you may recollect that\r\n\r\nI   have   somewhat  strenuously  called  on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to take all possible measures  to  keep\r\n\r\nour water resources pollution free. I am happy  my\r\n\r\nappeals  have not fallen on deaf ears.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  Government's intention to sewer the whole  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, so that all the dirty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolluted household water will go into sewers, is a\r\n\r\ngood  proposition. The pre-treatment of industrial\r\n\r\nwater  to  reduce  pollution  is  similarly   good\r\n\r\npractice   for  industrial  countries  to   adopt.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  is  an  opportune  time  for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to launch a campaign to bring  about  a\r\n\r\nrealisation  amongst the people of  the  strategic\r\n\r\nimportance of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I wish to deal with the interests of our\r\n\r\nsecond  line of defence - our citizen workers.  It\r\n\r\nmust not be forgotten that it was on the backs  of\r\n\r\nthe workers that the Government came to power time\r\n\r\nand  time  again, and for that matter the People's\r\n\r\nAction Party had been the most appropriate vehicle\r\n\r\nfor the workers to achieve a fair and square deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that it will be the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  future policy to take  all  possible\r\n\r\nmeasures necessary to prevent the loss of valuable\r\n\r\nskilled  hands through work accidents by  ensuring\r\n\r\nthat   basic  safety  and  health  standards   are\r\n\r\nprovided  and  maintained in factories  and  other\r\n\r\nplaces of work. In view of the fact that education\r\n\r\nand training are time-consuming and costly, it  is\r\n\r\nimperative and necessary to prevent further losses\r\n\r\nof valuable skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Government's interest in this\r\n\r\ndirection, although overdue by a couple of  years,\r\n\r\nis not too late. To achieve this, we should have a\r\n\r\n`supremo' of some seniority governing this  field.\r\n\r\nThe   Government's  intention  to  strengthen  the\r\n\r\nFactories  Inspectorate  with  suitably  qualified\r\n\r\nofficers   to  supervise  and  enforce  industrial\r\n\r\nsafety  is  welcomed. I recall in March this  year\r\n\r\nthe then Minister for Labour announced that 30-odd\r\n\r\nofficers   would   be  added  to   the   Factories\r\n\r\nInspectorate. In this regard, it might be recalled\r\n\r\nthat  I  had  earlier in December 1969  urged  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to reinforce the Factories Inspectorate\r\n\r\nto fully enforce the law. To my regret, my request\r\n\r\nwas  turned down. I think I have been proven right\r\n\r\nthat   the   Factories  Inspectorate   should   be\r\n\r\nstrengthened and that it should be reorganised  to\r\n\r\nbe a more effective enforcement arm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other proposal that I made was that the\r\n\r\nFactories Act, which was introduced in 1958 before\r\n\r\nindustrialization was thought of,  should  undergo\r\n\r\nmajor   overhauling.  The  reply  was   that   the\r\n\r\nFactories  Act was sufficiently comprehensive  for\r\n\r\nsafeguarding the health and lives of workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is now realised how far short are the\r\n\r\npowers  of  the  Chief Inspector of Factories,  so\r\n\r\nmuch   so   that  measures  have  been  taken   to\r\n\r\nstrengthen his hands soon. It is my humble opinion\r\n\r\nthat  he  should be a very senior man, comparable,\r\n\r\nsay, to the Director of Public Works, in the civil\r\n\r\nservice hierarchy. He should be properly guided by\r\n\r\na  policy to eliminate those establishments  which\r\n\r\nare health and safety hazards to those working  in\r\n\r\nthem. He should have wide discretionary powers  to\r\n\r\ncall for the punishment of employers who callously\r\n\r\nand   criminally  endanger  the  lives  of   their\r\n\r\nworkers.  Is this not an economic offence  of  the\r\n\r\nworst kind?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is that of the Soon Seng Battery\r\n\r\nPlates  Manufacturing  Company  (Private)  Limited\r\n\r\nwhich  refused to comply with the requests of  the\r\n\r\nChief  Inspector  of  Factories  to  prevent  lead\r\n\r\npollution and thus directly led to a young factory\r\n\r\ngirl  of fifteen years of age to suffer from  lead\r\n\r\npoisoning.  It  was found that the factory  had  a\r\n\r\nlead  atmospheric content 745 times above the safe\r\n\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this girl's case came to the knowledge of\r\n\r\nthe competent authority, another worker, a male of\r\n\r\n36  years  of  age, was admitted  to  hospital  in\r\n\r\nDecember 1969 from lead poisoning. The Head of the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Health Unit visited  the  factory.  He\r\n\r\nthen  carried  out  blood and urine  tests  on  29\r\n\r\nworkers,  the results of which showed  that  seven\r\n\r\nhad  severe signs of lead absorption bordering  on\r\n\r\nlead poisoning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager was then advised to carry out certain\r\n\r\npreventive measures to overcome the possibility of\r\n\r\ncases   of  lead  poisoning.  The  Head   of   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Health Unit reported the case  to  the\r\n\r\nChief  Inspector  of Factories  and  an  inspector\r\n\r\nvisited  the  factory.  The latter  confirmed  the\r\n\r\nconditions as reported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout  one  year after the discovery of the  first\r\n\r\ncase, another visit was made and it was found that\r\n\r\npreventive   measures   had   still    not    been\r\n\r\nimplemented. Seventeen days after that visit,  the\r\n\r\n15  year-old girl was hospitalised. She had worked\r\n\r\nthere  for  only one month and had been  poisoned.\r\n\r\nBlood  and  urine  tests were carried  out  on  22\r\n\r\nworkers and four more showed signs of severe  lead\r\n\r\nabsorption bordering on lead poisoning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken the opportunity to cite this recent\r\n\r\ncase  because  I  wish to question the  Government\r\n\r\nwhether  it  would feel inhibited  in  taking  the\r\n\r\nlogical   action   of  punishing   employers   who\r\n\r\nflagrantly  flout the law. In the case  cited  the\r\n\r\nprosecution asked for no punishment. The  manager,\r\n\r\nwho appeared on his company's behalf, admitted all\r\n\r\nthe facts read out in Court. The Court ordered him\r\n\r\nto   comply  with  all  measures  listed  in   the\r\n\r\nFactories  Act within a month or face  prosecution\r\n\r\nagain.  At  the very least, I thought the  factory\r\n\r\nshould  have been closed down temporarily for  the\r\n\r\nowner   to   comply   with   the   licensing   and\r\n\r\nregistration of the factory, and the compliance of\r\n\r\nsome health and safety provisions laid down by the\r\n\r\nCourt.   The   factory  was  not  registered   and\r\n\r\nlicensed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, 9th July, 1971, the manager's\r\n\r\nphotograph  appeared in the Straits Times  with  a\r\n\r\nterribly happy grin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that this factory is\r\n\r\nnot  the only unlicensed and unregistered factory.\r\n\r\nI  have  just received information that  there  is\r\n\r\nanother factory in the same neighbourhood which is\r\n\r\nunlicensed  and unregistered. Why is  it  that  so\r\n\r\nlenient  a  view  and  posture  is  taken  by  the\r\n\r\ncompetent  authority? Is the  Ministry  of  Labour\r\n\r\nworking  under a constrained policy of  protecting\r\n\r\ninvestment at all costs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Japan, which we are sometimes asked to\r\n\r\nemulate,  a girl suffering from cadmium  poisoning\r\n\r\nplunged  herself under a moving train  to  relieve\r\n\r\nherself  of bodily pains which she could stand  no\r\n\r\nmore.  The  Japanese Prime Minister  tendered  his\r\n\r\nsympathies  and apologised tearfully in Parliament\r\n\r\nand announced the payment of compensation to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbereaved  family.  I  hope we  will  not  have  a\r\n\r\nsimilar   occurrence  and  performance   in   our\r\n\r\nParliament.  Compensation removes some  financial\r\n\r\nhardship  for the bereaved family, but it  is  no\r\n\r\ncompensation for the loss of a dear one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is gratifying that our Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has taken a personal interest to  combat\r\n\r\npollution  of  our air and waterways.  Under  his\r\n\r\ndirection  we hope the Anti-Pollution  Unit  will\r\n\r\neliminate,  if not all, then most of  the  health\r\n\r\nhazards  of  pollutants.  I  am  happy  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  wasting no  precious  time  after\r\n\r\nearly warning was given in Parliament in 1969. As\r\n\r\nthe   problem  of  pollution  is  of   so   vital\r\n\r\nimportance  to the general public,  I  think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should report to Parliament from  time\r\n\r\nto  time on the matter. The importance which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  attaches to this problem  is  evident\r\n\r\nfrom  the recent appointment of the Head  of  the\r\n\r\nAnti-Pollution Unit as Head of the Public  Health\r\n\r\nDivision at the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the addendum to the President's\r\n\r\nspeech  indicated  that  air  pollution  in   our\r\n\r\nindustrial estates is increasing. If we  fail  to\r\n\r\ntake urgent preventive and corrective measures fn\r\n\r\nJurong  Town  and others, I feel we could  suffer\r\n\r\nthe  same fate as Los Angeles or Tokyo. The first\r\n\r\nsufferers  and victims would be our poor  workers\r\n\r\nwho stay in these estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrialization and urbanization also take\r\n\r\ntheir  toll  of human lives. In the  construction\r\n\r\nfield  the  number  of industrial  accidents  has\r\n\r\nrisen  to such serious proportions as to make  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the Government to  introduce  the\r\n\r\nBuilding  Operations  and  Works  of  Engineering\r\n\r\nConstruction    Regulations   which    Parliament\r\n\r\napproved  on  30th July, 1971. These regulations,\r\n\r\nif  implemented firmly, could go a  long  way  to\r\n\r\nremove   all  possible  known  hazards   in   the\r\n\r\nindustry.  In regard to these safety regulations,\r\n\r\nthe  competent  authority is the  Chief  Building\r\n\r\nSurveyor. In regard to safety regulations at sand\r\n\r\nand granite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquarries  the  safety regulations applicable  are\r\n\r\nembodied  in the Sand and Quarries Act  which  is\r\n\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Director of Public Works.\r\n\r\nIn  regard  to  safety regulations in  factories,\r\n\r\nshipyards and other places of work, the competent\r\n\r\nauthority  is  the Chief Inspector of  Factories.\r\n\r\nThe  control  of  silicosis among granite  quarry\r\n\r\nworkers  is  a matter for the Chief Inspector  of\r\n\r\nFactories. Mr Speaker, Sir, it can be  seen  that\r\n\r\nif  the  competent  authorities  in  the  various\r\n\r\ndepartments are guided by different policies,  it\r\n\r\nis   possible  that  safety  regulations  may  be\r\n\r\nenforced  with  different  emphasis.  It  is   my\r\n\r\nsincere  view that a consolidation of the various\r\n\r\nlaws  mentioned and unmentioned could be  a  more\r\n\r\nconvenient   means   of   administering    safety\r\n\r\nregulations. A case in point is that  any  member\r\n\r\nof  the  public could walk into a building  under\r\n\r\nconstruction,  or  a construction  site,  without\r\n\r\npermission  if  he is willing to take  the  risk.\r\n\r\nThis  should  never  be  allowed  to  happen.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  I  understand  that   when   the\r\n\r\nGovernment published the Building Operations  and\r\n\r\nWorks of Engineering Construction Regulations  in\r\n\r\nMarch this year, the competent authority, in this\r\n\r\ncase the Chief Building Surveyor himself, was not\r\n\r\naware  that  he  was the authority to  administer\r\n\r\nthese regulations. He could deny it anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as Chairman of the N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nOccupational Health and Safety Committee, I  must\r\n\r\nsay  the  Government has shown great interest  in\r\n\r\nthe   health  and  safety  of  the  workers.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment's   concern   in   this   respect   is\r\n\r\ndemonstrated by the introduction of  work  safety\r\n\r\nlaws  and  an  increase  in  the  staff  of   the\r\n\r\nFactories Inspectorate. The Government's  concern\r\n\r\nis  clearly  expressed by the  President  in  his\r\n\r\nopening  speech. It is one of the most dominating\r\n\r\nfeatures of the policy of the Ministry of Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workmen's Compensation Act will be amended\r\n\r\nto provide for three times the present\r\n\r\ncompensation rate to meet the contingencies in\r\n\r\nthe case of death and total physical incapacity.\r\n\r\nThere will be provision for the payment of\r\n\r\ncompensation to those who are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafflicted   by  occupational  diseases.   However,\r\n\r\ncompensation  should not be 4 desired  thing.  The\r\n\r\npurpose   of  compensation  rates  should   be   a\r\n\r\ndeterrent to employers not to be negligent. As  it\r\n\r\nis.  $7,200  awarded  in the case  of  death,  and\r\n\r\n$9,600 for permanent incapacity, is chicken  feed.\r\n\r\nThis  will  make  the  worst  employers  disregard\r\n\r\nsafety rules and regulations as they feel that  it\r\n\r\ndoes not matter when labour is cheap and workmen's\r\n\r\ncompensation is cheaper still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on 30th July. 1971. I had\r\n\r\noccasion  to  cite the cases of accidents  at  the\r\n\r\nMandarin  Hotel Construction site and at Chartered\r\n\r\nIndustries, where workers downed tools after their\r\n\r\nco-workers  died  in industrial  accidents.  These\r\n\r\nwere  unorganised  workers. The  conditions  under\r\n\r\nwhich  they  labour  are  seldom  favourable   and\r\n\r\nconducive  for  them  to take  retaliatory  action\r\n\r\nagainst unscrupulous employers. Nevertheless, they\r\n\r\nvented  their anger on the employer by  militantly\r\n\r\nstopping  work unless their safety was ensured.  I\r\n\r\nsalute  them again and would urge all  workers  to\r\n\r\nwork  safely  and to care for the  enforcement  of\r\n\r\nsafety regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there should be provisions to make it\r\n\r\nmandatory   to   the   establishment   of   safety\r\n\r\ncommittees in factories and other places of  work.\r\n\r\nThe    Government   should   also   consider   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  a council of industrial  safety\r\n\r\nand  health  to advise the Government  on  matters\r\n\r\npertaining to industrial safety, and also act as a\r\n\r\nwatchdog to see that the relevant safety laws  are\r\n\r\nimplemented by the various Government departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to hear the statement from the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that it is conscious of the sacrifices\r\n\r\nand  contributions  made by labour  towards  rapid\r\n\r\neconomic growth, and has urged employers who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  making  exceptional profits  to  pay  better\r\n\r\nbonuses    in   recognition   of   the    workers'\r\n\r\ncontribution  to the present economic  prosperity.\r\n\r\nThere  is an economic boom and the employers  have\r\n\r\nmade  profits.  All too often, few  employers  pay\r\n\r\nanything more than what the law requires  them  to\r\n\r\ndo so. It is still my opinion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow, just as it was at the time Parliament debated\r\n\r\nthe  Employment Act in 1968, that the question  of\r\n\r\nbonus  must  not be a restricted negotiable  item.\r\n\r\nThe denial of the negotiation rights of workers to\r\n\r\nshare the fruits of their labour is a back-kick in\r\n\r\nthe  teeth  on the democratic rights of labour  to\r\n\r\nfree collective bargaining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank the President for his\r\n\r\nspeech  and  look  forward to  the  day  when  our\r\n\r\ndefence  build-up  will reach its  optimum  and  a\r\n\r\ngreater  share  of our revenue will  be  used  for\r\n\r\neducation, health and social services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion of the Member for Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I wish to associate myself with  the\r\n\r\nmotion standing in the name of the Member for  Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan. It is gratifying to note that almost every\r\n\r\nMember  has in his speech, in this debate, touched\r\n\r\non  the  need to adapt to changes occurring around\r\n\r\nus. This shows that we are still politically alert\r\n\r\nand   that  our  senses  are  not  numbed  by  the\r\n\r\ncomparative  comfort and affluence  that  we  have\r\n\r\nachieved in the past years. History is nothing but\r\n\r\na   record  of  changing  circumstances.   It   is\r\n\r\nimportant  that we should not only  try  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout  changes  in  our society for  the  greatest\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  our  people,  but  we  must  also  be\r\n\r\nconstantly aware of the changes around us  and  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to take action to adapt to them.  To  do\r\n\r\nthe former, that is, to bring about changes in our\r\n\r\nsociety,  it  is necessary for us to convince  the\r\n\r\npeople  that whatever changes we seek to introduce\r\n\r\nare for the ultimate good of our people. It is  in\r\n\r\ntheir  interest  that we have so  acted.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect, there is nothing more convincing than the\r\n\r\npast  record of the P.A.P. We have been  in  power\r\n\r\nfor  exactly twelve years now and throughout  that\r\n\r\ntwelve-year  period, in the ups and downs  of  our\r\n\r\nfortunes,  one thing is very clear.

This is the objective\r\n\r\nwhich  keeps  us going in our fight for  survival\r\n\r\nand  for a better material life. Once it is gone,\r\n\r\nour  will to survive will be rapidly eroded,  and\r\n\r\nSingapore will revert back to a fishing  `village\r\n\r\nand  this time the fishing village will be poorer\r\n\r\nthan  the  one Stamford Raffles found  150  years\r\n\r\nago, because the sea water around us is much more\r\n\r\npolluted  than before and there is less  fish  ip\r\n\r\nthe  water.  It  is therefore necessary  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  pool  all our resources and  stiffen  our\r\n\r\nwill to fight the under-current forces which  are\r\n\r\ntrying to pull our people apart. So far, we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to achieve certain successes  on  the\r\n\r\neconomic  front, because we have been  acting  as\r\n\r\none  people.  But the moment the divisive  forces\r\n\r\ntake  over,  all  our  efforts  will  come  to  a\r\n\r\nstandstill.  Our  people  will  be  embroiled  in\r\n\r\nendless  tights  and quarrels, with  very  little\r\n\r\ntime  for work. This is not what we want. And  we\r\n\r\nshould  use all the powers that we have  to  stop\r\n\r\ncertain  persons from trying to push  us  towards\r\n\r\nthat direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it may be good to be an ally of a\r\n\r\ngreat  power, to have a big brother  behind  you.\r\n\r\nBut  there  is always the phenomenon  called  the\r\n\r\ngravitational pull in the world of  physics.  The\r\n\r\ncloser  a  smaller object moves towards a  bigger\r\n\r\nmass, the greater the gravitational pull\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexerted on the smaller object by the bigger mass,\r\n\r\nuntil eventually the smaller object crashes  into\r\n\r\nthe bigger mass and the two become one, and there\r\n\r\nis   no  more  of  the  smaller  one.  We  should\r\n\r\ntherefore  resist the temptation  of  moving  too\r\n\r\nclose  to  any  great power, whether  it  is  for\r\n\r\nprestigious,   protect   ional   or   sentimental\r\n\r\nreasons.  A  balance must be  maintained  in  our\r\n\r\nefforts   to   remain  a  free   agent   in   the\r\n\r\ninternational arena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between now and May next year, we will be able\r\n\r\nto  witness  a  period of great changes  in  this\r\n\r\nregion.  The  President of the United  States  is\r\n\r\ngoing to Peking to meet Chou En-lai. They will be\r\n\r\nplaying  a  game of chess on the huge  chessboard\r\n\r\nwhich   is   Asia.  The  nations  in  the   Asian\r\n\r\ncontinent, big and small, are the pieces on  this\r\n\r\nchess-board. Whatever we do, we must try to avoid\r\n\r\nbecoming a pawn in other people's game of  chess.\r\n\r\nIt is true that we have no means to influence the\r\n\r\ngreat  powers  when  they  make  decisions,   and\r\n\r\nwhatever  they decide concerning other  countries\r\n\r\nmay have far-reaching effects on us. But the fact\r\n\r\nstill  remains that if we are to get the greatest\r\n\r\nbenefit out of this unprecedented change  in  the\r\n\r\ninternational  climate,  we  should  not   commit\r\n\r\nourselves  too early to any side,  and,  best  of\r\n\r\nall, should not commit ourselves at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the international scene\r\n\r\nis  changing  as a result of China's new  policy,\r\n\r\nand  if  we  must  respond to these  changes,  we\r\n\r\nshould  do  so in a dignified manner and  in  the\r\n\r\nbest interest of our country, not just because it\r\n\r\nis  the  fashion of the day and that other people\r\n\r\nare  doing  the same thing. We should  not  allow\r\n\r\nourselves to be rushed onto the band-wagon. It is\r\n\r\nimportant  that we should have friendly relations\r\n\r\nwith  all the countries in the world, and  having\r\n\r\nfriendly relations with China has always been one\r\n\r\nof  our  aims.  But it is unrealistic,  and  even\r\n\r\nfoolish,  to  expect that having  good  relations\r\n\r\nwith  China will solve all our problems.  When  a\r\n\r\ngreat power acts, it does so in its own interest.\r\n\r\nAll  considerations  for the  interest  of  other\r\n\r\ncountries  or  parties are just coincidental  and\r\n\r\nare part of its moves to improve its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninternational standing. Our immediate  problem  is\r\n\r\nand  has always been the Communist threat  in  our\r\n\r\nmidst. From the long-term point of view, the armed\r\n\r\nstruggle  of the M.C.P, in the jungles of northern\r\n\r\nMalaysia will have a very serious bearing  on  the\r\n\r\nsecurity of our country. It is foolish to  believe\r\n\r\nthat  having  friendly relations with  China  will\r\n\r\ncause  the  M.C.P, to abandon their fight  in  the\r\n\r\njungles, or our local Communists to give up  their\r\n\r\nso-called \"outside Parliament\" struggle.  We  must\r\n\r\ntherefore  watch  very carefully the  developments\r\n\r\nboth  inside  and  immediately outside  Singapore.\r\n\r\nRight  now,  the  mouth-piece of the  M.C.P.,  the\r\n\r\nVoice  of  Malayan Revolution Radio, has increased\r\n\r\nits power, output and frequencies. It can only  do\r\n\r\nthis with the help of a great power sympathetic to\r\n\r\nits  cause. So I leave it to you to draw your  own\r\n\r\nconclusions  as  to whether or  not  having  close\r\n\r\nrelations  with  China, or any great  power,  will\r\n\r\nhelp  us to solve our immediate problems. What  is\r\n\r\nimportant  here is that we should  not  allow  our\r\n\r\nwish  to have closer and friendlier relations with\r\n\r\nChina  to jeopardise our efforts to curb the local\r\n\r\nCommunists in their mischievous deeds to turn  our\r\n\r\nsociety into a lawless one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace must be set by the elected government of\r\n\r\nthe  day.  If  there is going to be  a  change  of\r\n\r\npolicy,  that policy, whether foreign or domestic,\r\n\r\nmust be decided by us here, the representatives of\r\n\r\nthe  people.  However, there are some  people  who\r\n\r\nbelieve  very foolishly that they also  have  that\r\n\r\nright  to  decide for the people. They think  that\r\n\r\nbecause  they are controlling the mass media,  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers,   they  should  have  the   right   to\r\n\r\ninfluence  the people, who will in turn  influence\r\n\r\nthe  policy of the Government. We must state  here\r\n\r\nvery  emphatically  that they  do  not  have  that\r\n\r\nright.  They  represent only themselves  and  they\r\n\r\nspeak only with their own voices, whereas we speak\r\n\r\nhere  with the voices of the people and  with  the\r\n\r\nauthority  of the electorate behind us. These  men\r\n\r\nare  fond of saying, \"We, the people.\" But we must\r\n\r\nask, who are the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople? Are they the people who elected us, or  do\r\n\r\nthey   just   consist  of  newspaper  owners   and\r\n\r\neditorial writers? it is one thing to reflect  the\r\n\r\nviews  of  the  people in a paper  and  to  report\r\n\r\ntruthfully  what is going on in Singapore  and  in\r\n\r\nthe  world.  But  it is definitely  another  thing\r\n\r\ntrying  to  mount  a campaign by omitting  certain\r\n\r\nthings  and exaggerating others in order to  force\r\n\r\nthe  Government to change its course to  suit  the\r\n\r\ntaste  or  the purpose of the owner of the  paper.\r\n\r\nThe  Government is the one to decide which way the\r\n\r\ncountry  should be heading and it is then for  the\r\n\r\npress to assist in explaining why that course  has\r\n\r\nto be taken. The dissenting voice should be heard,\r\n\r\nbut it must he in proportion to the views of other\r\n\r\npeople  and it should not be exaggerated. This  is\r\n\r\nthe  kind  of  relationship we would like  to  see\r\n\r\nbetween the Government and the press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a lot of talk about the freedom of\r\n\r\nthe  press.  But  we must be frank and  realistic.\r\n\r\nSingapore has never had freedom of the press as it\r\n\r\nis   understood  in  the  Western  world.   Making\r\n\r\ncomparisons  with  the so-called  freedom  of  the\r\n\r\npress  in other countries, particularly the  West,\r\n\r\nis  misleading. The circumstances of the press  in\r\n\r\nthese countries are very much different from those\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. For instance, no one is allowed  to\r\n\r\nrun  a Communist newspaper here. The last one  was\r\n\r\nclosed  down 20 years ago during the emergency.  A\r\n\r\nfew  persons who now write for newspapers here are\r\n\r\nvery   fond  of  reminding  the  readers  of   the\r\n\r\nturbulent  years in the fifties. But in  spite  of\r\n\r\nall   this,   the  restriction  against  Communist\r\n\r\nnewspapers still stands. The organ of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  the  Chen  Sien  Pau,  is  a  different\r\n\r\nmatter.  It  is deliberately allowed to  carry  on\r\n\r\nbecause  we  want the people to see for themselves\r\n\r\nhow  foolish the lines of the Barisan Sosialis can\r\n\r\nbe.  It also serves as a constant reminder of  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  threat in our midst. In this  case,  we\r\n\r\nalso  have  to  be  frank. We  are  tolerating  it\r\n\r\nbecause its circulation is small, reaching only  a\r\n\r\nsmall section of the people, particularly the die-hards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan  Sosialis who  are  dwindling  in\r\n\r\nnumber.   But  the  moment  it  becomes   a   mass\r\n\r\ncirculation daily, it would be a different  thing.\r\n\r\nWe  will  then have to deal with it as a  security\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, futile to try to draw a\r\n\r\ncomparison between the case of the New York  Times\r\n\r\nand the case of the newspapers in Singapore. There\r\n\r\nis no similarity between the two. It is a waste of\r\n\r\ntime  writing endless editorials here  harping  on\r\n\r\nthe freedom of the press with the model of the New\r\n\r\nYork Times in mind. In the first place, we do  not\r\n\r\nhave such traditions. In the second place, in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  riots  can happen  every  day  and\r\n\r\neverywhere, and yet the country remains stable and\r\n\r\nprosperous. But in Singapore, one bloody riot will\r\n\r\nwreck  the whole country. We have been responsible\r\n\r\nfor  bringing  about  the present  good  order  in\r\n\r\nsociety  and the modest prosperity for the people.\r\n\r\nWe  are definitely not going to sit idle and watch\r\n\r\nour  achievements being cancelled out by poisonous\r\n\r\nwritings in the papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, how many countries in the world can\r\n\r\nafford  the  luxury of unlimited  freedom  of  the\r\n\r\npress? Or is it a myth that there is such a  thing\r\n\r\ncalled  freedom of the press? In Russia, in China,\r\n\r\nand  in  other Communist countries, the  press  is\r\n\r\npart of the propaganda machinery of the state. The\r\n\r\npress serves the interest of the Communist regime.\r\n\r\nIt  may  be  argued here that since the  Communist\r\n\r\nparty is the owner of the press and the party  has\r\n\r\nthe  greatest  freedom to do  whatever  it  wants,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  use of the press  to  achieve  its\r\n\r\npolitical  purposes,  therefore,  freedom  of  the\r\n\r\npress  in  its  truest sense exists  in  Communist\r\n\r\ncountries. But, I do not think this is the kind of\r\n\r\nfreedom that the press wants in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the older countries with\r\n\r\nestablished  social orders, or, as the  Communists\r\n\r\nwould  like to call them, the capitalist countries\r\n\r\nsuch as Britain, France, the United States and  so\r\n\r\non,  the case is slightly different, but the  fact\r\n\r\nstill  remains that even in these countries  there\r\n\r\nis no unlimited freedom of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  press  in  terms  of  a  blank  cheque  where\r\n\r\njournalists  can  say  what they  like.  In  these\r\n\r\ncountries, the newspapers and other mass media are\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by  big  financial groups.  In  almost\r\n\r\nevery  one of these countries there exists a  hard\r\n\r\ncore of people who form the establishment, or,  to\r\n\r\nuse a Communist terminology, the ruling class. The\r\n\r\npeople working in the press share the views of the\r\n\r\nestablishment.  They have the same social  values,\r\n\r\ntastes  and  outlook on life. The members  of  the\r\n\r\nestablishment do not belong to just one  political\r\n\r\nparty. They have no party lines. They can be found\r\n\r\nin  all  the  major political parties and  in  all\r\n\r\nwalks  of  life  and  invariably  hold  very  high\r\n\r\npositions. So political parties may come and go in\r\n\r\nthese  countries,  but  the establishment  ensures\r\n\r\nthat  its  views and social values prevail.  These\r\n\r\nare  reflected in their press. All newspapers must\r\n\r\ntoe  the line of the establishment and those which\r\n\r\ndo   not  are  subtly  dealt  with,  not  by   the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  of the printing licence,  as  we  have\r\n\r\ndone  so in the case of the Singapore Herald,  but\r\n\r\nby   the   quiet   and  effective  withdrawal   of\r\n\r\nadvertisement  and  financial support.  There  may\r\n\r\nexist  one  or two small newspapers, Communist  or\r\n\r\notherwise,  which  contain  drastically   opposing\r\n\r\nviews.  But they are merely tolerated there,  just\r\n\r\nas  we  are tolerating the Barisan newspaper here.\r\n\r\nThey  also  serve as trappings to the  make-belief\r\n\r\nthat  there is such a thing called freedom of  the\r\n\r\npress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have had too short a time for\r\n\r\nany  establishment to evolve. We  have  only  just\r\n\r\ncome to the sixth anniversary of our independence.\r\n\r\nIn  these  circumstances, the P.A.P, assumes  the\r\n\r\nleadership  of  the country and it represents  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of the people. There may be extreme  and\r\n\r\nconflicting  views existing among the people,  but\r\n\r\nwe always take the middle course and represent the\r\n\r\nmajority of them. We therefore must have the right\r\n\r\nto  lay down the lines for the people, because  we\r\n\r\nare   for   the  time  being  charged   with   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of looking after their welfare.  We\r\n\r\nmust  have  the right to say that it is our  views\r\n\r\nthat should prevail and not those of the Communist\r\n\r\nparty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor those belonging to the establishment group of a\r\n\r\nforeign  country. There may be a group  of  people\r\n\r\nwho  think that they can ignore this rule. I think\r\n\r\nit  is  time that they should open their  eyes  to\r\n\r\nrealities   and   not  allow  themselves   to   be\r\n\r\noverwhelmed by the myths and fictions belonging to\r\n\r\na different society. If they do not do so, then it\r\n\r\nis  going  to  be very difficult for us  and  very\r\n\r\ntroublesome for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps all this talk about taking over the\r\n\r\nGovernment and pulling the P.A.P, down arises  out\r\n\r\nof an innocent belief perpetuated by some quarters\r\n\r\nthat  we are getting old and that we are about  to\r\n\r\ngive  up. It may be beneficial for all parties  if\r\n\r\nwe  are to state here that we are not getting old.\r\n\r\nOlder  maybe  in age, but not in mind and  spirit.\r\n\r\nThe  good  knife is not blunted yet, as a  Chinese\r\n\r\nsaying  goes, \"Pau tau wei lau.\" We have our  ears\r\n\r\nand  eyes  always on the ground listening  to  the\r\n\r\nvoice  of the people and always catering for their\r\n\r\nneeds.  It is also necessary for us to state  here\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  not likely to give up our  task  so\r\n\r\neasily.  There might have been a time in the  very\r\n\r\nremote   past  when  we  considered   giving   up.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the defeat in the Hong  Lim  by-election,   which  I  can  still   remember,   for\r\n\r\ninstance, there was a passing thought, and it  was\r\n\r\neven  discussed among some of us, that perhaps  it\r\n\r\nmight be a good idea if we were to give up for the\r\n\r\ntime  being.  But  then we  were  aware  that  the\r\n\r\nBritish were in active control. There was a safety\r\n\r\nnet  at the bottom of everything and we knew  that\r\n\r\nthings could not go too far wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But things are different today. We cannot afford\r\n\r\nto give up and we do not intend to do so. There is\r\n\r\nnothing  at the bottom to save us now.  If  we  go\r\n\r\ndown, we will go right down and this time it  will\r\n\r\nbe  worse  than the confrontation days,  the  days\r\n\r\nwhen  we  were  in  Malaysia,  the  days  of   the\r\n\r\nEmergency and the days of the Japanese occupation.\r\n\r\nThe   lives  of  two  million  people   would   be\r\n\r\nendangered if we were to fail in our task. History\r\n\r\nwill   judge  us  as  the  greatest  cowards   and\r\n\r\ncriminals if we were to abdicate our duties now at\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncrucial  moment of Singapore's development  as  an\r\n\r\nindependent country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to those who have the ambition to succeed us,\r\n\r\nI  have  this  advice  to offer.  They  must  stop\r\n\r\ntalking  about  taking over the  Government.  This\r\n\r\nonly  serves to demonstrate their greed and  their\r\n\r\nambition.  That  is no good for  them.  They  must\r\n\r\nfirst show to the people of Singapore how they can\r\n\r\nbe  worthy of their support. They must first  tell\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore how they can  do  things\r\n\r\nbetter  than  the P.A.P. The people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwant as their leaders persons who are serious  and\r\n\r\nwith   a  sense  of  responsibility  towards   the\r\n\r\nultimate  well-being  of the  country.  They  want\r\n\r\npersons who can withstand the toughest trials  and\r\n\r\ntribulations in time. They do not want clowns  and\r\n\r\nentertainers in the political arena. They  do  not\r\n\r\nwant   people  who  start  scrambling  for  spoils\r\n\r\nimmediately after they have formed a party and who\r\n\r\nresign  as  soon as a so-called crisis  occurs  in\r\n\r\ntheir midst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  let  me  also add my voice to those  of  the\r\n\r\nhonourable  Members in thanking the President  for\r\n\r\nhis  speech  to Parliament made on the 21st  July,\r\n\r\n1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are once again approaching a critical point in\r\n\r\nthe  history  of  this nation and  state  when  it\r\n\r\nbecomes incumbent upon every thoughtful citizen to\r\n\r\nreflect  and  decide  upon the  character  of  the\r\n\r\nsocial order that we are consciously building  for\r\n\r\nourselves.  In  the  1940s and  1950s,  the  great\r\n\r\nquestion   was   the   problem   of   colonialism.\r\n\r\nThereafter until 1963, the principal enemy of  the\r\n\r\npeople  were the local Communists and the question\r\n\r\nat  issue was whether we established for ourselves\r\n\r\na political system that ensured a periodically and\r\n\r\nfreely  elected  government or  succumbed  to  the\r\n\r\nCommunist system of government by terror;  whether\r\n\r\nwe  had a government that was centred in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  ruled  in the best interest of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, or one that took its orders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom foreign centres of political power. From 1963\r\n\r\nto  1965,  the critical question was  whether  the\r\n\r\ncharacter of our politics was to be a function  of\r\n\r\nrace and language. The birth of the nation in 1965\r\n\r\nsymbolised  the  rejection  of  racism   and   its\r\n\r\nattendant  linguistic barbarities as the  criteria\r\n\r\nof  political  policy and behaviour. The  decisive\r\n\r\nquestion  in  the I 970s would be whether  we  are\r\n\r\nable  to  forge a secular political  community  in\r\n\r\nwhich economic and social questions determine  our\r\n\r\npolitics  out  of  the  disparate  linguistic  and\r\n\r\ncultural   groups  of  human  beings   that   form\r\n\r\nSingapore society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rational policies formulated by Government and\r\n\r\ndisciplined effort on the part of the people  have\r\n\r\nresulted  in  the  ostensible  wealth  that  today\r\n\r\nglitters  around us. The indications are  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  achieved the enviable target  of  near  full\r\n\r\nemployment  which, paradoxically, has created  new\r\n\r\nproblems  relating  to manpower  which,  unsolved,\r\n\r\nwould stunt the further growth of our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is fast approaching for us also to\r\n\r\ninitiate,  side by side with policies designed  to\r\n\r\ndevelop to the full the nature and quality of  our\r\n\r\neconomic  forces of production, measures aimed  at\r\n\r\nhumanising    society    and    state.     Despite\r\n\r\nopportunities for employment, there are dark areas\r\n\r\nof  human  hardship  and suffering  that  must  he\r\n\r\novercome if we are to retain our self-respect. The\r\n\r\ncriteria  used  by the Ministry of Social  Affairs\r\n\r\nshould  be  carefully re-examined to  see  if  the\r\n\r\nlevels  of public assistance allowances meted  out\r\n\r\nare  sufficient to enable a destitute to  maintain\r\n\r\nbody  and soul together. This, however, is not  to\r\n\r\ndecry  the  hitherto good work done by the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department. The enormity of  the  problem\r\n\r\nwas  acute enough to entice an honourable Member,\r\n\r\nhimself  a  noted  economist, to suggest  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  a wealth tax to soak the rich, despite  the\r\n\r\nstern  imperatives  of quick economic  development\r\n\r\nand the industrial transformation of our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the only aim of soaking the rich is to display\r\n\r\nour socialist credentials, it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould be an exercise in futility and bring in  its\r\n\r\nwake  growing  frustration and disenchantment.  If\r\n\r\nthe  objective  is  one  of fairly  and  equitably\r\n\r\ndistributing the new wealth produced, it cannot be\r\n\r\nbeyond   our   wits  to  evolve  a  self-adjusting\r\n\r\nmechanism with proper legal sanctions through  our\r\n\r\ncollective   bargaining   machinery   that   would\r\n\r\neffectuate   such  distribution  of  wealth.   The\r\n\r\nfundamental problem, however, would be to evolve a\r\n\r\nsystem  of ethical and cultural values that  would\r\n\r\nprovide   the   solvent  to  dissolve   the   many\r\n\r\ncontradictions that currently operate in  society.\r\n\r\nWhile  bilingualism  and multi-cultural  tolerance\r\n\r\nprovide   the   lowest  common  denominators   for\r\n\r\ncultural  integration, there  is  much  more  that\r\n\r\ncould  be  done  in  the  way  of  providing   the\r\n\r\norganisational  and  physical  framework  for  the\r\n\r\ninteraction of the highest classical traditions in\r\n\r\nart,  literature, music and culture  of  the  many\r\n\r\ntraditions of civilisation that have moulded  this\r\n\r\nnation.  Human  minds belonging to  the  different\r\n\r\ntraditions  must  meet to discover  one  another's\r\n\r\nwealth and diversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a tendency of late on the part of\r\n\r\nsome  to define human beings and human society  in\r\n\r\nmechanistic  terms in an effort to categorise  the\r\n\r\nhuman  digit in purely physical, measurable terms.\r\n\r\nThis type of quantitative analysis may or may  not\r\n\r\nprovide the ultimate answers, but it would be well\r\n\r\nto  remember that the human being possesses within\r\n\r\nhimself the factor of indeterminacy which provides\r\n\r\nthe  creative  impulse for  great  works  of  art,\r\n\r\nliterature and music. It is precisely this  factor\r\n\r\nthat  is killed in totalitarian states and  it  is\r\n\r\nthis factor that our social order should carefully\r\n\r\nnurture. As our society evolves into higher  forms\r\n\r\nof  endeavour, cohesion and excellence, we  should\r\n\r\nconsciously seek to transform force into law, fear\r\n\r\ninto  respect,  coercion into  consent,  necessity\r\n\r\ninto   liberty  and  superstition  into   rational\r\n\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are able to achieve the many things we have\r\n\r\nset  ourselves,  it is imperative  that  there  be\r\n\r\npeace  and  order both internal and  regional.  We\r\n\r\nalready\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  indications  that the  exigencies  of  power\r\n\r\npolitics  would  militate  against  this  regional\r\n\r\npeace and order that every power pays homage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from time immemorial, big powers\r\n\r\nhave  interfered in the internal affairs of  small\r\n\r\nstates; and being a small state ourselves, we must\r\n\r\ngird ourselves to meet this situation. In the name\r\n\r\nof  building an anti-imperialist front, one  great\r\n\r\npower  would  seek to penetrate our  trade  unions\r\n\r\nand,   in   the  name  of  fundamental  democratic\r\n\r\nfreedoms,  another  great  power  would  seek   to\r\n\r\ninfluence   our   intelligentsia   and   religious\r\n\r\norganisations. The net result of these  activities\r\n\r\nwould   be  the  erosion  of  the  power  of   the\r\n\r\ngovernment and state to stand up to the  pressures\r\n\r\nand  behests of these great powers. We can end  up\r\n\r\nas puppets. In combating the effects of this game,\r\n\r\nwe  must, from time to time, take the people  into\r\n\r\nour confidence in order that maximum vigilance and\r\n\r\ncohesion  are  maintained  at  all  times.   Human\r\n\r\ncorruptibility would always be a weakening  factor\r\n\r\nin  any polity. The Herald and Nanyang affairs are\r\n\r\nreminders of unsolved problems within ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, a word must be said about the new\r\n\r\nWoodlands  satellite town now  being  constructed,\r\n\r\nand   about  our  water  problem.  In  scope   and\r\n\r\ndimension it is to be the biggest town yet, and we\r\n\r\nmust expect that past errors in planning would not\r\n\r\nbe  repeated here. We understand that the new town\r\n\r\nwould  have  the  most  up-to-date  amenities  for\r\n\r\nsocial and cultural life. We welcome this, as also\r\n\r\nthe new compensation terms recently announced. The\r\n\r\nproblem  of compensating absentee owners, however,\r\n\r\nremains  unsolved; but this is not something  that\r\n\r\ncannot be solved by quiet diplomacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board's call to the people\r\n\r\nto  conserve  water  and the magnificent  response\r\n\r\nfrom  the  people  has once again highlighted  the\r\n\r\nwater  problem.  A  cursory look  at  the  figures\r\n\r\nreveal a curious but interesting picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average rainfall for the whole island is\r\n\r\nabout  750 million gallons per day. As our maximum\r\n\r\nconsumption is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naround 130 million gallons per day, we should have\r\n\r\nat  our disposal about 620 million gallons per day\r\n\r\nprovided  that  we are able to collect  our  total\r\n\r\ndaily rainfall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of ways in which this could be\r\n\r\ndone. The obvious thing to do would be to increase\r\n\r\nthe  capacity  of  the  impounding  reservoirs  by\r\n\r\nbuilding   new   reservoirs   or   expanding   the\r\n\r\ncapacities  of  the  old  ones.  The  capacity  of\r\n\r\nSeletar Reservoir has been increased considerably.\r\n\r\nExtension works are being done at Pierce. The same\r\n\r\nthing  should  be  done  to  MacRitchie.  Two  new\r\n\r\nreservoirs  are being built at Bedok  and  at  Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan/Kranji. Side by side with this development,\r\n\r\nthe  water  filtration capacity of the  filtration\r\n\r\nplants should also be increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two reservoirs in Sentosa. Pulau Tekong\r\n\r\nand  Pulau  Ubin have primitive water conservation\r\n\r\nschemes,  and  Pulau  Brani  receives  water  from\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The total water resources of  all  our\r\n\r\nsmaller islands should also be developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other exciting possibilities. We could\r\n\r\nbuild  breakwaters at the mouths of our many small\r\n\r\nrivers,  drain  out  the  sea-water,  prevent  its\r\n\r\nseepage  and  let in fresh river  water  into  the\r\n\r\nreservoirs so constructed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, some of our islands could be joined to\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  such a way as to  provide  us  with\r\n\r\nreservoirs  fitted in between these small  islands\r\n\r\nand  Singapore. Once again the sea-water could  be\r\n\r\ndrained  out  and  fresh water  collected  in  its\r\n\r\nplace. This method could be pursued with advantage\r\n\r\nwith regard to the islands off Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industries should be encouraged to use industrial\r\n\r\nwater  in place of P.U.B, potable water for  their\r\n\r\nprocesses. At present, we have two sewage  plants,\r\n\r\none  at  Jurong  and another next  to  Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nAirport. Every gallon o industrial water used is a\r\n\r\ngallon  of  potable water saved  and,  on  present\r\n\r\ncalculations,  it  would appear  that  40  million\r\n\r\ngallons  of industrial water per day go to  waste.\r\n\r\nThe recent decision of the Minister for Finance to\r\n\r\nwithdraw the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n50  cents  sewer  tax  on industrial  water  is  a\r\n\r\nwelcome move. This tax has been a needless  burden\r\n\r\non  the  woodworking  and  textile  industries  in\r\n\r\nJurong.  With  the establishment of petro-chemical\r\n\r\nindustries in Jurong, the water needs of the petro-chemical industries, together with the woodworking\r\n\r\nand  textile  industries alone, would  be  in  the\r\n\r\nregion  of three to four million gallons per  day.\r\n\r\nThis  demand  should be met entirely  out  of  our\r\n\r\nindustrial water capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a concomitant to the plan to use industrial\r\n\r\nwater,  a  double  distribution  system  for   the\r\n\r\ndistribution  of  industrial and  even  sea  water\r\n\r\nshould  be  experimented with, preferably  in  new\r\n\r\nhousing  and  industrial estates  that  are  being\r\n\r\nbuilt near the sea. The Woodlands New Town and the\r\n\r\nEast Coast Reclamation Scheme come to mind in this\r\n\r\nregard.  We  could  try  the  double  reticulation\r\n\r\nsystem and use coloured taps (red, green, etc.) to\r\n\r\ndistinguish the potable water from the  industrial\r\n\r\nor sea water. Sea water could he used to flush our\r\n\r\ntoilets.  There may be technical problems involved\r\n\r\nin  conducting  sea  water. But modern  technology\r\n\r\nshould provide us with new materials so fabricated\r\n\r\nas  to  be able to withstand the corrosive effects\r\n\r\nof sea water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more expensive though exciting project that\r\n\r\ncould be put in hand immediately is the nuclear de-salination of sea water. This process is  becoming\r\n\r\na  commercial reality in other parts of the  world\r\n\r\nwith water scarcity problems. It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  has the added advantage of providing us with\r\n\r\na  new  source of electrical power for  industrial\r\n\r\nand other purposes. The scheme would enable us  to\r\n\r\ntrain   our  people  in  the  uses  of  this   new\r\n\r\ntechnology. De-salination has a great  future.  It\r\n\r\ncould  solve  our  water  problem  radically.  De-salinated water would probably cost $3 to  $4  per\r\n\r\n1,000  gallons as against the $1 per 1,000 gallons\r\n\r\nnow  charged  by the P.U.B. I would  suggest  that\r\n\r\nthis  differential is not prohibitive and a  small\r\n\r\nplant  to  produce, say, five million gallons  per\r\n\r\nday should be started. Posterity would commend the\r\n\r\nwisdom of the move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, we must once again thank the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  having responded magnificently  to\r\n\r\nthe  P.U.B.'s  call  to discipline  their  use  of\r\n\r\nwater. We now know that in any future emergency of\r\n\r\nwhatever form or nature, the proper response would\r\n\r\nbe forthcoming from our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
