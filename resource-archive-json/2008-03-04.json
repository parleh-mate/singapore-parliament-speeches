FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Educational Policy</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</B> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the total sum to be allocated for Head&nbsp;K of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fundamentals of our school scheme are sound.&nbsp; However, there are four areas in education which I would like to highlight in developing our young.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, preparing our young for the future.&nbsp; People are our&nbsp;only resource.&nbsp; All individuals in our society should therefore be given the opportunities to develop to their fullest.&nbsp; Our students have diverse ability and interest.&nbsp; There are now special schools for sports, arts, mathematics and science to cater to students' unique strength.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does MOE intend to keep up the momentum to cater to diversity of students further?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continued success of Singapore lies in our people's ability to compete in <p align=left>Column: 1815<p>this globalised world and to meet the challenges of the future.&nbsp; The present economy requires methods of doing things, that are increasingly mobile and dynamic. We are all aware that creativity, flexibility and innovation are the key tools we need to survive and compete in this knowledge-based economy.&nbsp; How does MOE develop our young to be innovative individuals of the future?&nbsp; What are the programmes in place to develop creative and critical thinking of students?&nbsp; Are such programmes being reviewed periodically?&nbsp; Should there be more entrepreneurial skills development programmes being introduced?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been said that Singapore's education system is grade oriented.&nbsp; The examination focused attitude has the&nbsp;effect of taking out the fun of studying.&nbsp; It brings me to my second point of lifelong learners of the future and encouraging a learning society.&nbsp; It has become necessary to modify the role of education in just equipping the basic faculties.&nbsp; Education can no longer stop after one leaves school.&nbsp; Individuals must take it upon themselves to constantly improve and upgrade themselves.&nbsp; MOE can prepare our students to be lifelong learners.&nbsp; In our human resource dependent country, the success of which will depend on how well the next generation can take advantage of globalisation.&nbsp; In an increasingly faster changing world, it is essential to have a society that is nimble to transformation in order to underpin our national competitiveness.&nbsp; Could MOE therefore modify our education system and steer our students to be lifelong learners of the future and encourage a learning society?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, is about opportunity for disadvantaged students.&nbsp; Education is the best way to level up in society.&nbsp; There is a greater challenge for children from lower-income families to participate in the education process.&nbsp; Many dropouts are <p align=left>Column: 1816<p>from low-income families.&nbsp; Our poorest populations, numbering&nbsp;some 90,000 to 100,000 households, especially those with young children, need special attention.&nbsp; We need an integrated approach of assistance.&nbsp; Many parents of these children may lack&nbsp;parental motivation&nbsp;and, therefore, parental guidance and counselling, financial assistance and other referrals may be necessary in order to get better educational support and attitudes towards schools for these children.&nbsp; Therefore, we should have&nbsp;comprehensive assistance - social workers assigned to families and counsellors to target at factors not just schools but also families and communities,&nbsp;extra tuitions and career guidance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued monitoring and follow-up over time are necessary to ensure the well-being of these children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Latest available figures show that some 5% of each&nbsp;Primary 1 cohort of about 42,000 has not attended&nbsp;pre-school at all.&nbsp; Latest research on brain development demonstrates that a child's environment and experience in the earliest years of life are critical for cognitive, physical, social and emotional development, and have profound lifelong benefits.&nbsp; It is urgent for us to try our best to give children from&nbsp;disadvantaged backgrounds&nbsp;the better chance in life in education.&nbsp; Could MOE target and actively assist the children from this group?&nbsp; We need a scheme that is able to systematically identify these families to ensure that no child is deprived for whatever reason.&nbsp; Could MOE cooperate with MCYS on this issue?&nbsp; These children need early intervention assistance for better outcome.&nbsp; A holistic approach may have to be taken for each family as they may need the varied assistance.&nbsp; Could MOE have an automatic assistance package once such needy children are being identified and these children are being followed-up till secondary schools to prevent future dropouts?&nbsp; I agree with <I>Straits Times</I> ' Senior Writer, Chua Mui Hoong, when she <p align=left>Column: 1817<p>wrote last week, and I quote, \"Singapore being such an organised, close-knit society,&nbsp;it is well within its capability to weave a tight social safety net for low-income children to ensure that they have the means to go to school and stay there for character refinement.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How we bring up our young at home and teach them in school will shape Singapore in the next generation.&nbsp; We must strengthen our emphasis of character building&nbsp;in students.&nbsp; We should produce not just \"A\" students, but individuals&nbsp;who are gracious, civic conscious and benevolent.&nbsp; There is lament in many developed societies that&nbsp;their citizens are becoming more self-centred and uncaring towards their fellow men and even towards their own elders.&nbsp; We must ensure we do not follow this slippery path.&nbsp; Could MOE assure that we do not end up with a&nbsp;future generation with ugly social fall-outs; where we have ungracious citizens, where children do not practise filial piety and the most disadvantaged of our society are ignored? Could MOE have educational curriculum with more emphasis on character development and social etiquette?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

One is reasonably bright and who might arguably make it to the upper echelon of the educational cohort, while another is mildly dyslexic and has to work harder to keep up with his classmates.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, I am delighted that our education system is now multi-faceted and, in recent years, has been redesigned to provide multiple pathways up the education ladder.&nbsp; As a parent, this greatly reduces my anxiety that my children's opportunity to further their education will <p align=left>Column: 1818<p>be limited by how well they fare at various milestones, such as PSLE, \"O\" level and \"A\" level examinations.&nbsp; The options are now many: Through Train programme, the Sports School, Arts School and the NUS High School of Mathematics and Science as well as the many other schools that offer various advanced elective modules and the new \"O\" level subjects in applied discipline such as digital media at the secondary level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a friend who would have been greatly stressed about her son's PSLE performance, if not for the fact that she knew he had a good chance of entering the Arts School, as he was musically talented though not so academically inclined.&nbsp; The son is now among the first batch of students in the Arts School and in fact did reasonably well for his PSLE, probably due to the fact that he has less pressure from the mother.&nbsp; There are also many parents who are keen to send their children to the NUS High School of Mathematics and Science.&nbsp; The increasing emphasis on learning by doing&nbsp;projects and through the Learning Journey programme is also encouraging.&nbsp; My youngest daughter who is in secondary school describes the group projects and the Learning Journey programmes as \"cool\".&nbsp; The creativity of a teacher plays a large part in this reception.&nbsp; But the educational framework set by the Ministry provides a matrix for creativity to flourish and enrich the learning experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the attempt to inject greater choices and diversity in learning is, in my view, a step in the right direction.&nbsp; As it maximises the opportunity of every individual to find his niche and develop his talent to the fullest, it is difficult to predict the type of jobs and skills that will be in demand in future, suffice to say a growing population, a maturing economy yields more varied career and lifestyle options that require a wider base of educational opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1819<p> Further with the premium on creativity and innovation in our workplace, we need to equip our young with a range of skill sets and the ability to apply knowledge to solve real world problems.&nbsp; The outcome requires teamwork and people with different skill sets and perspectives.&nbsp; The highly successful iPod is not just a fancy technological gimmick but also the result of smart design, aesthetic and marketing powers.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the number of such niche schools as well as those offering electives&nbsp;is still limited.&nbsp; I would thus like to urge the Ministry to further enrich this current dynamic educational landscape even further by injecting more learning options so as to allow even more students to benefit from them.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It has created a stressful environment that is not conducive for learning, maturing and teaching.&nbsp; Teachers are appraised and graded not just for what they do inside the classrooms, but outside as well.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a <I>Straits Times'</I> report on 29th December 2007, it was reported that a teacher resigned after six years at a primary school because she felt that the school was more interested in getting her to organise events, something she felt interfere with her ability to teach.&nbsp; There is a fear that the pursuit of excellence and higher ranking by over zealous principals and teachers will come at the expense of the weakest students.&nbsp; Going by what has happened at the beginning of 2008, this fear is not unfounded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a <I>Straits Times'</I> article on 12th January 2008, \"Sec&nbsp;5 class advised:&nbsp;Go to ITE instead\",&nbsp;a group of 27 girls in a Secondary 5 class in a mission school <p align=left>Column: 1820<p>were advised by their principal to transfer to the Institute of Technical Education on the first day of the school.&nbsp; It was reported that the principal even displayed the student's detailed&nbsp;N-level grades and stressed that she only wanted 100% passes in her school.&nbsp; In some other schools, students were told that they are liable to be barred from taking certain subjects at \"N\" or \"O\" levels, if their school projects are found to be unsatisfactory.&nbsp; Parents of these students were made to sign an acknowledgement of the consequence for poor school work and an undertaking to monitor their children's progress.&nbsp; This again happened at the beginning of a school term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly, some educators and teachers no longer look at the student's F9 grade as a room for improvement case, but a reason to drop the subject case as such result will lower the mean subject grade, or MSG, for the&nbsp;class.&nbsp; MSG is computed as an average grade of all the students in the class.&nbsp; Understandably, a lower MSG is no good for the school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching a class of 30-40 teenagers is already a stressful job.&nbsp; In addition, our educators have to worry about the weakest students pulling down the ranking of their school,&nbsp;job performance appraisal and of course their financial rewards since their pay is now linked more closely to work performance.&nbsp; How can one teach effectively under such an environment?&nbsp; The recent appraisal and school ranking system had diluted the good intention of many principals and teachers, many are unwittingly being transformed into technocrats crunching and manipulating numbers to achieve a desired target either to make a personal goal or a national objective.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MSG in school is just like monosodium glutamate. It&nbsp;enhances flavour but is unhealthy in the long run.&nbsp;MSG has a high sodium content which contributes to hypertension.&nbsp; Is this&nbsp;why&nbsp;some principals <p align=left>Column: 1821<p>and teachers are looking so flushed at the beginning of the school year?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman:</B>&nbsp; Mr Chiam See Tong is not here.&nbsp; Dr Ong Seh Hong.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong (Marine Parade)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Character Building</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Marine Parade)</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20080304/20080304VS_092159.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a></I>*.] Last year, during the Budget debate, I urged the Government to look into the character building of our next generation so that they can have a \"<I>yin yang hu ji, wu xing xiang fu</I> &#38452;&#38451;&#20114;&#27982;&#65292;&#20116;&#34892;&#30456;&#36741;\" which means to cultivate a harmonious and balanced character. Those words are still ringing in my ears.&nbsp; But I have read a news article recently and it makes me very worried.&nbsp; According to the newspaper report on 28th February, some schools have organised Total Defence Day to raise the level of Total Defence awareness among the students so that they could experience their parents' hardship during the Japanese occupation.&nbsp; So these students&nbsp;ate sweet potatoes and&nbsp;drank tap water.&nbsp; There&nbsp;was no electricity, no fan, no lights, and no air conditioning.&nbsp; And this&nbsp;was just for one day.&nbsp; But the students kept complaining.&nbsp; They said that&nbsp;it was too hot, too dark, the water&nbsp;was not cold, and they did not want to eat sweet potatoes.&nbsp; It was also reported that a 10-year old student refused to go home after the school bus fetched him back.&nbsp; He refused to go home because the maid&nbsp;was not around&nbsp;and there&nbsp;was no one to carry his school bag.&nbsp; So, I am worried about the next generation.&nbsp; Are they too weak?&nbsp; Are they overly protected?&nbsp; They are like flowers in a green house.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the factors affecting their moral character are, first, the self.&nbsp; Students are immature at the developmental age, emotionally and psychologically.&nbsp; Their moral character is not well formed and&nbsp;their value system is also not <p align=left>Column: 1822<p>properly formed.&nbsp; Therefore, they are easily influenced by external factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the family factor.&nbsp; Some parents have distorted values.&nbsp; They emphasise on their children's results and they are overly concerned about money and materialistic pursuits.&nbsp; Therefore, they do not let their children do any housework.&nbsp; They only want them to concentrate on their studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the school.&nbsp; Some schools only focus on academic performance rather than on the personal aspects, such as character building and moral development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, the social factor.&nbsp; The society talks about materialism and utilitarianism.&nbsp; All these will cause people to emphasise on money and materialistic pursuits.&nbsp; Internet access can also erode the moral values of our young.&nbsp; Recently, the sex photo scandal of Hong Kong actor Edison Cheng is an example to illustrate the distorted values and lifestyle of the modern generation.&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to urge&nbsp;the Government and parents to look into this problem so that we can strengthen the character building of our young.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we can strengthen the family unit.&nbsp; Parents need to have proper values, and be a good example to their children.&nbsp; Their world views,&nbsp;outlook and&nbsp;moral sense will all affect their children.&nbsp; Therefore, at home, parents should not emphasise too much on their children&rsquo;s results.&nbsp; Rather, they should let their children participate in house chores so that it will promote greater interaction among parents and children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the school should emphasise on three aspects, ie, moral, intellectual and physical, and not be overly concerned about academic performance but to stress more on the character and moral development of their students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1823<p> Third, to create a good social environment for the young, so that we can create a good learning environment for&nbsp;them.&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to ask MOE for its comments regarding the psychological and character building of our students.&nbsp; How does MOE appraise the schools in this area?&nbsp; How do the schools engage parents and the community to nurture our next generation with better character development?</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

(1)&nbsp; Ensure a clearer line of sight between MOE's desired outcomes of education and its performance measures.&nbsp; The desired outcomes of education as stated on the MOE website are:&nbsp; young Singaporeans who are able to seek and apply knowledge, gracious, global yet rooted, morally upright and&nbsp;who embrace lifelong learning.&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at&nbsp;the some 20 performance indicators in the Budget Book, it is unclear which indicators are linked to the desired education outcomes.&nbsp; The most celebrated and well-known performance indicators in our country still remain academic results and CIP hours.&nbsp; Sir, it is timely for the Ministry to update its list of performance indicators to reflect its priorities and value-add.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Clarify the list of available education options to the public.&nbsp; In recent years, many exciting new school models have surfaced, eg, the Sports School, the Arts School, the NUS School of Science and Maths, the Northlight School, Pathlight School and the revamped ITE.&nbsp; This trend supports the Prime Minister's vision to provide multiple pathways for <p align=left>Column: 1824<p>students with different talents and abilities.&nbsp; I ask the Ministry to develop a matrix that describes the target groups for which the different school models are developed and how they all fit in the landscape.&nbsp; This will clarify the options available to students and also highlight if any segments of the student population are over or under-served.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Urgently enforce a tiered quality assurance framework for all MOE-registered schools and education centres not falling within the mainstream sphere.&nbsp; Sir, the wave of negative publicity on the appalling standards of private schools does not augur well for Singapore.&nbsp; Even special needs therapy centres are advertising themselves as MOE-registered centres to clients.&nbsp; One such centre is even mentioned in the MOE website.&nbsp; There is little due diligence on these MOE-registered organisations, and our Singapore brand equity in education is at high risk of being tarnished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE must urgently put in place a tiered quality assurance system for all private schools, special schools, special needs intervention centres and even tutoring agencies.&nbsp; At entry level, minimum standards must be compulsory, not voluntary.&nbsp; The bar must not be too low.&nbsp; After compliance with minimum standards, these non-mainstream centres can then be encouraged to achieve higher levels of excellence, very much like the six-star system in the hotel industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Encourage the shared services model amongst like-minded special schools run by voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs).&nbsp; Special schools run by VWOs are sometimes criticised to be developmentally delayed themselves in the past.&nbsp; Quality is inconsistent and dependent on leadership capability, the&nbsp;type of staff that they are able to attract, and available resources.&nbsp; Out of the three sectors in the landscape - private, public and the people sectors - it is the people <p align=left>Column: 1825<p>sector which can least afford to attract strong leadership and technical talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <I>status quo</I> need not remain.&nbsp; Like-minded VWOs who want the best for their students should be encouraged to adopt what is called the shared services model in the corporate sector.&nbsp; VWOs can put aside their territorial instincts and join forces in functions, such as HR, hiring and training, management systems, curriculum, pedagogy, therapy and psychology support.&nbsp; This model is already manifested recently with the collaboration of the Autism Association of Singapore and the Autism Resource Centre to adopt the shared services model to run the special&nbsp;needs&nbsp;schools under them.&nbsp; Sir, more can be done in the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Deploy MOE staff to Special Schools for at least one to two years to install education fundamentals.&nbsp; In trying to help to level up the special education sector, what is required is not simply more governance.&nbsp; Many fundamentals, such as management systems and curriculum, are not yet in place.&nbsp; More thinking hands need to be deployed for execution work on the ground.&nbsp; Visionaries and critics are aplenty, but co-labourers in the field are scarce and overworked.&nbsp; Send the MOE staff out to work in the field.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp; Urgently clarify the roles of MOE and&nbsp;NCSS in the running of Special Schools.&nbsp; School leaders now have to answer to at least two parties, ie, the MOE and the NCSS.&nbsp; The overlapping administrative reporting performance evaluation systems, meetings and numerous surveys required by the two agencies can be reduced, so that schools can stick to the core business of education.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, I used to volunteer at a residential home for the disabled.&nbsp; There, I discovered that many of the adult residents were leading lives very much below their potential.&nbsp; Their lives could <p align=left>Column: 1826<p>have been of a much higher quality had they received earlier and more effective education.&nbsp; Sadly, however, they were born in the dark ages of special education when expectations of them were very low and expertise to help them was very scarce.&nbsp; Sir, we must not let another generation of special needs Singaporeans pass us by without getting to their potential that they are given.&nbsp; Many need not end up disabled.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, Sir, I wish to thank and congratulate the Minister prior to his departure from the Ministry for having boldly led MOE in transforming our education landscape very positively.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Behind me were two boys I did not know from a prominent <p align=left>Column: 1827<p>Chinese school.&nbsp; During the briefing, they exchanged remarks in Mandarin making fun of me, particularly my race.&nbsp; They did not know that I understood Mandarin, or at least enough of it to know what they were saying.&nbsp; Then the teacher came up to me and said that she saw from my records that I took Mandarin as a Second&nbsp;Language.&nbsp; The look on the boys' faces was priceless.&nbsp; We later got to talking and I asked them what I had done to offend them.&nbsp; They said that, throughout their lives, ie, about 16 and a half years, they had never known a person of a different race.&nbsp; Having me in the same ECA group therefore put them a bit off balance.&nbsp; I am glad we had that conversation.&nbsp; We became friends after that.&nbsp; I still keep in touch with one of them and, recently, visited him and his family during Chinese New Year.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I do not think my experience is exceptional in any way.&nbsp; It confirms what we all know about human nature -&nbsp;that we tend to fear and distrust things we do not understand.&nbsp; Despite the great strides we have made in racial and religious integration, our mission will never be accomplished.&nbsp; We have to remain vigilant, particularly nowadays, when there are forces at work to divide us.&nbsp; We all know about the uproar caused in respect of the incident at Boon Lay Gardens Primary School.&nbsp; MOE acted decisively in overturning the principal's policy.&nbsp; But one thing that remains uncertain is how this incident has shaped the views of the students in the school on racial and religious matters.&nbsp; Has anything been done to assess the impact of the incident on the students?&nbsp; We will no doubt encounter more incidents, some innocent, some less so, which will test the strength and depth of our inter-racial and religious relationships.&nbsp; We cannot anticipate what form these will come in.&nbsp; The only real defence is for us to ensure that our relationships stand on strong foundations.&nbsp; And the best <p align=left>Column: 1828<p>place to start is in our schools.&nbsp; If our children are unable to integrate in schools, then there is little hope that they will do so when they grow up.&nbsp; And part of that process must be to demystify issues of race and religion to our children and encourage an understanding and appreciation of their fellow schoolmate who appears different from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, I am told by several teachers, particularly from neighbourhood schools, that there is still a tendency for students of different races to stick together when in school.&nbsp; I would therefore like to ask the Minister what steps will be taken to promote racial and religious integration in our schools.&nbsp; I know that schools organise events, such as cultural or racial harmony days or occasional trips to the mosques or temples.&nbsp; Are these really effective?&nbsp; Should we not have a more structured and sustained programme to help our children understand the issues, not just theory but real interaction?&nbsp; Further, what are schools which are under-represented or have no representation of minorities doing to ensure that their students have the opportunity to interact meaningfully with them?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I will first address Dr Lily Neo and Dr Amy Khor's questions on what MOE is doing to prepare our young for the future and provide them with options which&nbsp;bring out their unique strengths.&nbsp; I will then address the range of issues raised by the other Members -&nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Hong,&nbsp;Ms Denise Phua, Ms Lee Bee Wah, Mr Low Thia Khiang and&nbsp;Mr Hri Kumar&nbsp;-&nbsp;which touch in different ways on how we can continue to provide a quality education, and keep <p align=left>Column: 1829<p>improving&nbsp;how we&nbsp;achieve the outcomes that we desire in schools.&nbsp; Different angles that the questions took, but they all come down to the question&nbsp;of how we can keep improving, how we can achieve the outcomes we truly desire in schools.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were also some&nbsp;other specific and valuable issues raised -&nbsp;whether it was on special education, what more we can do to help our disadvantaged children, and on the regulation of the private education sector.&nbsp; These are issues which my colleagues will also talk about later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we prepare our young for the future, and especially for a future of innovation, as Dr Lily Neo put it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, keep doing the basics right, and hold all our schools to high standards.&nbsp; That is how we come up with the highest average scores internationally in Mathematics and Science, and now even in English, where our primary school students have emerged amongst the top in reading literacy, despite the fact that more than half of our students come from non-English speaking homes.&nbsp; It came as a surprise to the British and Americans, because they found that the average Singapore student does better&nbsp;in English reading literacy than their average students.&nbsp;&nbsp;And if there was&nbsp;an international test on bilingual competence, I have no doubt&nbsp;that Singapore students will come out&nbsp;amongst the top&nbsp;internationally, if not the top.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only possible because we have good schools across the board, not just a few good schools at the top. &nbsp;That is the real strength of the Singapore system compared to&nbsp;others - committed principals and caring teachers, spread across our schools, so we can uplift every child.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing well in the basics, however, is not going to be&nbsp;enough. &nbsp;It distinguishes us from most countries when we look at <p align=left>Column: 1830<p>what they achieve on average, but it is not enough to distinguish us in the league of leading cities.&nbsp; These are cities which attract the best from a broader population canvas, and also have a way of throwing up individuals with a special edge and passion in&nbsp;what they do.&nbsp; We must do the same.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know our future has to be in innovation, in every field we engage in,&nbsp;whether it is&nbsp;media and design,&nbsp;financial services, or&nbsp;precision engineering.&nbsp; It requires a whole team of people, focused on continually improving and seeking a competitive edge through innovation.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But it also requires a special cut of individuals, those&nbsp;with a special passion for what they do and the urge to keep going beyond the ordinary.&nbsp;These are the ones who think in original ways, do things differently, and keep the leading cities spinning differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not mean that we shake up our education system.&nbsp;It is working very well by any international standard, giving all our students&nbsp;the chance to stretch their abilities, move on to a good post-secondary education and keep upgrading once they enter the workforce. What we are doing is to open up new pathways and different approaches to learning, around a well-functioning mainstream system. We need these new and different pathways, because if we do everything the same way in education, we will not produce the individuals who are capable of breakthroughs. We will not be capable of peak performance as a city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to highlight two features of these new pathways that we have been creating, which Dr Lily Neo and Dr Amy&nbsp;Khor spoke about. First, the numbers of students entering these new pathways will not be large, but they will very likely have an impact on Singapore that goes beyond their numbers. The three new <p align=left>Column: 1831<p>Specialised Independent Schools -&nbsp; in Mathematics and Science, in Sports and the Arts, currently take in just 230 students in each cohort, or barely 0.5% of cohort. They will eventually grow to&nbsp;over 800 or about 2% of cohort, which is still small.&nbsp; Around 6% of cohort are also enrolled in our Integrated Programme (IP) schools. Some of them too are being groomed in quite&nbsp;different ways&nbsp;compared to&nbsp;before &ndash; many more opportunities to explore their&nbsp;interests and do their own projects. And we are also nurturing a different breed through several of our mainstream schools, which are developing niches of talent in a range of fields.&nbsp;Not a large number in each school, or even when you add them together. But these new pathways to learning will help us bring out the individuals with a passion for what they do and who want to go much further than the norm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second feature of these new paths is that they are recognising a broader range of Singapore talents. We are recognising and nurturing diverse talents, besides the academic. The Direct School Admissions (DSA) process now reinforces this -&nbsp;schools are looking out for different strengths among our young besides the academic, and teachers and parents are encouraging their children to take these&nbsp;seriously.&nbsp; The students who are offered places in the new secondary pathways also come from&nbsp;a whole range of primary schools.&nbsp;The School of the Arts (SOTA) made offers to students from 126 primary schools when it opened. At NUS High School of Maths and Science (NUSHS) &ndash; although the competition to gain entry is highly competitive, as Dr Amy Khor&nbsp;mentioned - students currently come from 150 primary schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So these are small pools of students, but varied in their talents and drawn from across the island. It all amounts to a broader meritocracy, and a livelier one. <p align=left>Column: 1832<p>More free-play for&nbsp;students with special talents, around a common foundation that helps every Singaporean stretch his potential. And more Singaporean talents being discovered and nurtured, besides good talents in regular academic fields.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This increased free-play around a central core in Singapore education will give us the best chance for the future. It gives us the best chance of seeding the innovative teams that we need, as well as the individuals who want to do exceptional things. They will help keep us in the league of top cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the new approaches that we have been developing in several of our schools is in applied learning, which Dr Amy Khor spoke about.&nbsp;&nbsp; A whole range of schools, from neighbourhood schools like Bishan Park Secondary and Tanglin Secondary, to our Integrated Programme schools like Raffles Institution and Hwa Chong Institution, have partnered the polytechnics to offer electives&nbsp;to their students in a variety of disciplines, like Media &amp; Design, Engineering, Business and Information Technology, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The feedback has been very positive.&nbsp; Students find that the 'real-world' learning that they encounter is&nbsp;interesting and&nbsp;engaging. It motivates them to go further. It also allows them to discover strengths and interests they never knew they had until they tried it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will take this a step further. MOE will establish a fourth specialised independent school, a School&nbsp;of Science and Technology (SST), which will open in 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will offer a new option for students who are likely to be university-bound, and who want both a solid academic foundation and immersion in real-world applications.&nbsp; They will be able to learn by experimenting, tinkering, and by taking a project through all its stages &ndash; from concept to design to&nbsp;building the models.&nbsp; But the exposure to real-world <p align=left>Column: 1833<p>applications will not be aimed at getting students to specialise early in any particular skill.&nbsp; The real aim will be to nurture students with inventive minds, people who keep looking for a different way of doing things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SST will be different from other schools in several respects. I will explain this very briefly, as MOE will be releasing more information on the new school.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the four-year curriculum of the school&nbsp;will offer both academic subjects and new Applied Subjects like Biotechnology, Design, Media Studies, Environmental Science and Technology.&nbsp;All these&nbsp;subjects will all be part of the Singapore-Cambridge 'O' level examination framework.&nbsp; The SST will also be different&nbsp; from&nbsp; the NUS High School in this regard,&nbsp;which offers a six-year programme including JC.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;School&nbsp;of Science and&nbsp;Technology&nbsp;will&nbsp;offer a four-year route for capable students who want to keep open the option of going to either junior college or polytechnic, before they eventually go on to university.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the teaching methods in the SST will give students greater exposure to practical and real-world application of concepts.&nbsp; This will also require that class sizes be kept small so as to facilitate learning through experimentation - generally about 20 to 25 students per class, so that the students benefit from closer supervision and interaction with their teachers.&nbsp; The school will also house special facilities and laboratories to&nbsp;help its students in their&nbsp;learning, and also make use of specialised facilities in Ngee Ann Polytechnic and NTU. The SST will also be one of our FutureSchools,&nbsp;which means that it will leverage fully on ICT in its activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the SST will have strong partners in our tertiary institutions. It will collaborate with Ngee Ann Polytechnic and Nanyang Technological University <p align=left>Column: 1834<p>(NTU), and tap their expertise.&nbsp; It will also work with leading companies, such as IBM and Creative Technology, to provide additional learning opportunities and internships for&nbsp;its students.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth,&nbsp;just like NUS High School, the SST will have full flexibility&nbsp;on its student&nbsp;admissions &ndash; it will be able to select students based on interviews, their&nbsp; track records, recommendations from their teachers, and&nbsp;the like. Like the other specialised schools, we expect it to attract talents from all across the island.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE will be appointing Mr Chua Chor Huat, the current principal of Ngee Ann Secondary School, to head the SST as principal from June this year. Chor Huat is one of a new generation of strong school leaders, who has distinguished himself in all his appointments to date.&nbsp; Sending him to&nbsp;SST is the first signal we want to send&nbsp;on the importance of this new school. The school leader is critical.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also have Dr Su Guaning, the President of NTU, as the Chairman of the Board of Directors&nbsp;of the SST.&nbsp; He needs no introduction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Su will help the SST grow its capabilities and networks, and lead a board comprising others from&nbsp;industry, academia and&nbsp;the Government.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new School of Science and Technology will, I am sure, become another peak in our landscape.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has the promise of nurturing a new breed of inventive young Singaporeans who will help us sustain a high-value economy.&nbsp; We do not know where the next Sim Wong Hoo will come from, but these different ways of learning from young will enhance our chances of throwing up the Sim Wong Hoos of the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the comments raised by Ms Denise Phua, Mr Low Thia Khiang and&nbsp;the others which, as I&nbsp;mentioned, are related because&nbsp; they all touch on how we keep improving quality <p align=left>Column: 1835<p>across the board, and how we keep track of how well we are achieving the outcomes we want to see in education. How do we keep track of all this and what are our assessment systems and&nbsp;measurement systems to ensure that we have got the right balance in education?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a system that works well because we identify and develop people who can be strong&nbsp; school leaders, and we give them sufficient autonomy to run their schools in the best interests of their students.&nbsp; That is our basic approach. This way, schools and teachers&nbsp;develop ownership over what they are doing, and it is ownership&nbsp;that drives the improvements that we are seeing. It is ownership that is driving the quality that we are seeing in our system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But with increasing autonomy on the ground, the question posed by Ms Denise Phua becomes&nbsp;important.&nbsp; How do we define&nbsp;our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that help us track whether we are achieving&nbsp; the outcomes we desire in education?&nbsp;If we look at the indicators in the Budget book, they are, in fact, fairly comprehensive.&nbsp; Not many indicators, but there is a lot that underpins each of these indicators. Some of them&nbsp;are systemic indicators, the obvious ones,&nbsp;like education attainment rates for the latest cohorts, and the average number of years of schooling. There are also indicators that reflect how well our schools are doing&nbsp;- how many of them have achieved key performance benchmarks. The benchmarks go beyond just academic achievement. They are holistic, and try to capture whether our schools are doing a good job in developing their students all round.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE's School Excellence Model (SEM) is essentially our quality assurance framework for schools.&nbsp; It helps schools identify areas of improvement, both <p align=left>Column: 1836<p>through self-appraisal and external validation. We have spent many years refining and improving it, and it is, in fact, now seen by many other countries as a model worth studying and emulating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SEM focuses on the key processes by which schools deliver holistic education to their students -&nbsp;&nbsp; how effective their teaching is, and how well they develop strength of character, teamwork and leadership skills among their students.&nbsp; Character building and moral education are important tasks in education, as Dr Lily Neo, Dr&nbsp;Ong Seh Hong and Ms Lee Bee Wah have&nbsp;emphasised. Senior Parliamentary Secretary Masagos will be talking&nbsp;more&nbsp;about this later.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the key performance indicators in the Budget book therefore&nbsp;reflect the number of schools that have achieved key benchmarks under the School Excellence Model.&nbsp; While they are recognised&nbsp;by way of&nbsp;awards when they do so, the aim is not for us to measure the number of schools achieving awards, but the number of schools who have got that whole set of processes in place that underpin the achievement of these performance benchmarks.&nbsp; There is no quota on the number of schools who&nbsp;reach these benchmarks or obtain the awards. These are what are called criterion-referenced awards rather than norm-referenced awards, to use the technical language. So they are meaningful indicators of the level of quality that we are seeing in the system, and how it is rising over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree, nevertheless, with Ms Denise Phua, that we should take a fresh look at our KPIs from time to time,&nbsp;make sure they match our desired outcomes. And we can also look at how we can refine our Budget book indicators which reflect some of our KPIs but not all of them. For instance, we could include indicators that capture how well our schools have <p align=left>Column: 1837<p>engaged the students and enthused them in areas such as national education. But we must bear in mind that the real outcomes of education are observed over a much longer period of time, well after a student has left school. For example, an important outcome has to be the spirit of lifelong learning that shows up later in life, as Dr Lily Neo has pointed out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, even the outcomes in school are not directly measurable.&nbsp; For instance, Mr Hri Kumar raised the issue of racial integration. It is an&nbsp;important priority for our schools and tertiary institutions, but we cannot measure our success directly. We survey students for their views and attitudes, but we can never be sure if we are capturing real thoughts and feelings, or how they will really react in a crisis.&nbsp; What we nevertheless know is that this is&nbsp;important work, and continuous work for our schools and tertiary institutions. Minister of State Lui will speak more on the issue&nbsp;reply later on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must therefore keep a sense of balance in defining our KPIs in education. Some of the most important things we want to achieve cannot be measured. We want schools to focus on aims and values that cannot be&nbsp;measured, as much as they track&nbsp;the indicators&nbsp;which can be measured. This is why MOE looks at&nbsp;the school holistically and qualitatively&nbsp;-&nbsp;we do&nbsp;school visits,&nbsp;we&nbsp;do surveys and&nbsp;we get feedback from parents,&nbsp;industry leaders,&nbsp;and even&nbsp;other educators,&nbsp;to get a holistic picture of a&nbsp;school.&nbsp;I think the work we have put in over the years -&nbsp;by our educators as well as our MOE&nbsp; HQ administrators -&nbsp;has been well worth it.&nbsp;This is a system&nbsp;where quality is being driven&nbsp;from the ground because we&nbsp;have given schools autonomy,&nbsp;we free them up, but we assess them over time and reward and recognise&nbsp;those who are achieving higher quality, so that the rest can see&nbsp;what they can emulate, and the good practices spread across the system.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1838<p>That is how we keep raising quality across our system.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings me to Mr Low Thia Khiang's question on how we assess our schools -&nbsp;both our school leaders as well as our teachers.&nbsp; We do not&nbsp;appraise principals on the basis of the ranking of their schools or the number of awards their schools win.&nbsp; And neither do we assess our teachers simply on the basis&nbsp;of&nbsp;either the results of their class or the things they do outside the classroom.&nbsp; It is a more holistic assessment.&nbsp; It has been&nbsp;carefully worked out over the years with&nbsp;lots of two-way feedback.&nbsp; The&nbsp;current system is called the Enhanced Performance Management System, introduced a few years ago.&nbsp; It is working quite well, working better now than when we first introduced it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, it is something which other countries look at with great interest, because they are also trying to do the same thing - assessing schools, not with a very close and direct hand, but assessing them in a way which&nbsp;gives them leeway to do their own thing but, nevertheless, recognises those that are doing better than others,&nbsp;recognises the more competent, capable and caring teacher from the others.&nbsp; That is how the system stays dynamic, that is how&nbsp;quality keeps rising.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our teachers are assessed on several competencies.&nbsp; It is not simply how well their students do in their tests, neither is it simply a matter of what&nbsp;teachers do outside the classroom.&nbsp; It boils down to&nbsp;their passion and commitment in nurturing the whole child.&nbsp; That is what we call the core competency, and we state&nbsp;it as such, that there is a core competency that every teacher knows is the first thing and the most important thing we look at - their passion and commitment in nurturing the whole child.&nbsp; And the rest follows from that.&nbsp; We look at whether our teachers are able to teach creatively and effectively, <p align=left>Column: 1839<p>whether they go out of their way to look after the needs of their students, whether they contribute to the capabilities of their colleagues, contribute to better team work within their department of the school, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are not new criteria.&nbsp; They are not new factors that we look at in a teacher's performance.&nbsp; They have always been there.&nbsp; What is new about the Enhanced Performance Management System is that it is now transparent; it provides explicit feedback to the teacher each year on how he or she is doing, and what he or she could pay more attention to and what he or she could get more help in developing new competencies.&nbsp; And it also enforces&nbsp;discipline on the part of each supervisor, to be honest about his or her subordinates, recognise the things that they do very well, and identify those who need help in order to realise their full potential as teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low mentioned an example that was reported on recently about a principal who had given a stern talk to Secondary 5 Normal (Academic) students.&nbsp; When that came up, the first thing I did within the Ministry was to take a closer look at what the school was doing, what they have been achieving, and look at the data as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;We looked at the Normal (Academic) data - successive cohorts of Normal (Academic) students in this school.&nbsp; The first thing that struck us was that almost all their Secondary 4 Normal (Academic) students moved on to Secondary 5, a very high transition rate.&nbsp; The second thing that struck us about this school was that their Secondary 5 Normal (Academic) students did better than most other schools, not just in absolute terms but value-added.&nbsp; Consistently, under the same principal, the school has done better than comparable schools in raising the level of performance of its Normal (Academic) students - better value-add.&nbsp; And that <p align=left>Column: 1840<p>must count for confidence.&nbsp; It is now understood from research all over the world -&nbsp;true confidence comes from true achievement and the joy of achieving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different schools have different methods, different principals have different methods.&nbsp; I as the Minister for Education, and the Ministry, try not to scrutinise everything they say, everything they do, as long as they have not committed a serious offence.&nbsp; Let them do their own thing and let parents judge the character of the school.&nbsp; In fact, the same school, not many years ago, had a requirement that every girl wears a petticoat, not a MOE stricture but that was the practice of the school.&nbsp; Parents knew what the school was like.&nbsp; They sent their girls to the school because they liked the ethos.&nbsp; So, let parents choose and, over time, we will know which school's methods, which principal's methods, work better than others.&nbsp; And individual principals too will learn over time - tweak here, improve here and there, because no one is perfect.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to find a balance between affirming children and challenging children.&nbsp; That is the craft of the school principal and the teacher.&nbsp; That is the key craft - affirming and challenging.&nbsp;&nbsp;In some countries like the US,&nbsp;there was a whole wave starting from the 60s about making children feel good about what they are doing.&nbsp; The idea&nbsp;sounded good and the literature looked&nbsp;good.&nbsp; But if we simply do that, I am not sure we are going to keep achieving what we&nbsp;have been doing, and I am not sure Singapore is going to stand out the way it&nbsp;has.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp;studies in the United States over the last decade have come to the view that it is not just&nbsp;a child's confidence that matters.&nbsp; What really matters is&nbsp;how well trained the teacher is, how effective his or her teaching is, and the willingness of the child to put in some hard work.&nbsp; That is what really matters.&nbsp; And&nbsp;when&nbsp;children finally achieve, that is when true <p align=left>Column: 1841<p>confidence comes, and that is the more enduring confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, there was a study done by the Brookings Institution quite recently of the international results in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole lot of countries take part, from Africa all the way to the States.&nbsp;&nbsp;They found that students from Africa, the Middle East and the United States were the most confident about their ability in Mathematics.&nbsp; And students from East Asia, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore were the least confident about their abilities in Mathematics.&nbsp; But the results were exactly the reverse.&nbsp; The students from countries who felt that they were the least confident did better than the students who felt they were the most confident.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, they found the least confident Singaporean child did better than the most confident American child.&nbsp; They highlighted that in their report,&nbsp;\"the least confident Singaporean child does better in Mathematics than the most confident American child.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a complex matter.&nbsp; Confidence is important, motivation is important in learning.&nbsp; We do not want to defeat a child.&nbsp; So some affirmation is necessary, starting from primary 1 all the way up,&nbsp; some affirmation of every child's strengths.&nbsp; If the child is weak overall, try and find a strength that&nbsp;we can affirm.&nbsp; That is important.&nbsp; But&nbsp;we also need to challenge them.&nbsp;We also need students who keep coming late to school to buckle down and get working, because the \"N\" levels examination is not many months from now, the \"O\" levels is not many months from now, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, finding that right balance between affirming and challenging is something the schools have to find their own way of doing;&nbsp; principals have to find their own way of doing.&nbsp; The Ministry should not intrude in specific decisions unless something goes completely wrong.&nbsp; And, <p align=left>Column: 1842<p>over time, I think we will tell which schools are doing better and which schools are not doing so well, and lessons will be shared.&nbsp; That is our approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day, let us keep this system, where we keep identifying good people to join education, identify people with leadership capabilities early, train them up, develop them, put them at the helm of the school, and then keep sharing lessons across the system, and resist the temptation to question everything they say.&nbsp; That is how we ensure ownership on the ground, and that is how we will see quality continuously rippling across our system.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The universities justified the increases on rising manpower <p align=left>Column: 1843<p>and operating costs.&nbsp; Specifically mentioned was the need to hire staff to keep up standards.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2005, the MOE Steering Committee on University Autonomy, Governance and Funding had recommended that tuition fee increases for NUS and NTU be kept at a maximum of 10% per year.&nbsp; The recent hikes by each university were on a cohort basis, with the next fee fixed for the cohort for the duration of their course.&nbsp; I agree that the principle is good.&nbsp; However, I would like to clarify whether the 10% cap is still relevant with a cohort lock-in system.&nbsp; For example, in the case of the NUS law course, if one is to conclude, that one-time fee rise of 20% for four years works out to less than 10% a year, and hence it is within the cap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the world continues to pay a higher premium for such talent, we can expect our universities to face even higher wage bills for academics.&nbsp; Since students have to co-pay 25% of the cost of university education, does the Ministry foresee that the cap on tuition fee increases will be higher than 10% in the future, especially in courses where academic expertise is very expensive?&nbsp; While the policy to enable universities to charge realistic fees to keep up standards makes sense, this could work counter to affordability and potentially affect social mobility of poorer students.&nbsp; Universities are required to submit proposed fee increases to MOE for approval.&nbsp; What considerations does MOE take into account to decide whether fee increases are to be approved?&nbsp; Based on the Finance Minister's Budget Speech, I wish to conclude that so long as bursaries and loans are available, course fees can escalate.&nbsp; Does the Ministry monitor the level of student debt, and how many years the graduate would be in debt upon his graduation?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I understand that manpower and operating costs have increased.&nbsp; I also appreciate the efforts of the three universities to provide more financial help and scholarships.&nbsp; But the reality is that not everyone is eligible for the financial help, and not everyone wishes to apply for financial help.&nbsp;&nbsp;As some of these students are from middle income families, they do not feel that they should rely on Government bursaries to pay for their education.&nbsp; Some students may also have to depend on their parents to stretch their income to pay for the increased fees.&nbsp; I spoke to some students who will be entering university next year, and they said that they would have to give more tuition, and some have said that they will take on part-time jobs to finance their students.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I was once such a student many years ago.&nbsp; When the university fees were increased, I had to give tuition to help cover the increased costs.&nbsp; I felt terrible having to stretch out my hand to my parents and ask them for that little bit more money.&nbsp; I know how hard my parents had to work just to earn that extra few dollars.&nbsp; But, honestly, Sir, it also never crossed my mind to check whether I was eligible to apply for a bursary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; University education is not like any other commodity where if the price is too high, we can seek alternatives.&nbsp; For many Singaporeans, a university education is a way to a brighter future. So I would urge the Government to consider increasing the education grants to universities, so as to reduce the impact of the increase in their costs.&nbsp; The universities would then have less pressure to increase fees at such regular intervals.&nbsp; Better still, Sir, if we can freeze all fee increases, as with other Government fees that we have just frozen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1845<p>Sir, I also read in the newspaper last week that Stanford University will not charge tuition fee to students from families earning less than US$100,000.&nbsp; Princeton is also reported to have given grants to families with annual incomes as high as US$200,000.&nbsp; The budget for Education is the second highest after Defence. Surely we can improve on our financial support for our students as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also call on the universities to do more to promote the availability of bursaries as well as to consider ways to reduce costs.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Sir, students who have benefited from a low cost university education are able to pay back to the State the subsidies which they have taken, through their payment of income taxes.&nbsp; In addition, many of these students would then feel a stronger affiliation to their alma mater because of the goodwill generated when we provide a low cost university education.&nbsp; I believe our students will remember the benefits they had derived from studying in Singapore.&nbsp; They will return to provide support for the universities where they came from, once they have achieved success in their lives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me turn now to Private Education Organisations (PEOs).&nbsp; Last week, there was a spate of reports on the extremely low standards amongst the PEOs.&nbsp; The <I>Straits Times</I> wrote a scathing report on these PEOs as well as on CASE which administers the CASE TRUST for PEOs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1846<p> As the Vice-President for CASE, I would like to state that CASE took on the role to accredit the PEOs under CASE TRUST, which&nbsp;is under the Education Excellence Framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was at the request of EDB in 2004.&nbsp; There is one primary focus - which is to protect students' fees.&nbsp; Under the CASE Trust Student Protection Scheme, the fees paid by students to the PEOs are protected by an insurance scheme or by depositing with an approved bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not possible for CASE to check on the academic credentials of the teachers of these PEOs or&nbsp;whether they are degree mills.&nbsp; CASE is not a Government agency and simply does not have the ability or resources to carry out such checks.&nbsp; The guiding principle must be <I>caveat emptor</I> and students who desire to pursue higher education must surely do their own homework to check that these PEOs are of the desired quality, especially if they want to pursue a university education.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But many of these complaints, Sir, are valid and it is only right that students studying in these PEOs are given more stringent protection against dishonest or inept management who do not run a proper school, who have dubious lecturers or degree programmes or who do not wish to provide sufficient protection for the fees paid for by their students.&nbsp; I would thus urge MOE to take up the task of monitoring and regulating the PEOs to give better protection to the students.&nbsp; Sir, this call has been made by CASE previously and I would urge MOE to respond quickly before further damage is caused to Singapore's reputation as an education hub.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mr Teo Ser Luck)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Many, including myself, are surprised that just after about four years, a short span of time in the planning horizons of economists and policy-makers, there is now yet another U-turn on this issue, although I must say that I do welcome this resurrection.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had always supported the idea of a fourth university, given the growing number of polytechnic graduates who flock to overseas universities each year&nbsp;because of the limited places in our three publicly-funded universities.&nbsp; Many of them do exceedingly well in the top quality universities abroad and some eventually do not return to our shores.&nbsp; One of the key concerns for being hesitant to open another publicly-funded university has <p align=left>Column: 1848<p>always been that we do not want it to be seen as a second class university for those who cannot qualify for places in the existing publicly-funded universities.&nbsp; I believe that with each cohort, the batting average is increasing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More and more widespread tertiary education can only be better for the workforce and the nation as a whole.&nbsp; Furthermore, experience from SMU has shown that standards can be maintained with careful differentiation strategies.&nbsp; Additionally, a survey of universities around the world reveals, as the most recent study team led by Minister of State Lui Tuck Yew has found, the diverse shape and scope of these universities.&nbsp; They range from technical and applied universities in Europe and US, like the Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands, to the Liberal Arts Colleges of the US, such as Amherst.&nbsp; Each has enormous standing that is undiminished by its size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is thus clearly scope for this fourth university to be distinguished from the three existing universities.&nbsp; A technical or applied university with emphasis on practical skills and knowledge for industry would be more suited for the many polytechnic students who form the largest cohort of potential students for the university, although this does not preclude other students from the more traditional routes to apply.&nbsp; I believe, Sir, that polytechnic education is no longer deemed as second rate.&nbsp; Indeed, many bright \"O\" level students opt for a polytechnic education, instead of the traditional \"A\" levels route.&nbsp; Why should a university that caters to these students be treated differently?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also believe that there is a place for a Liberal Arts College since such colleges are typically small and the cost for this has been significant.&nbsp; But because the cost of setting up such a Liberal Arts College is significantly higher, it might be <p align=left>Column: 1849<p>more sensible to set it up as a niche campus of an existing university such as the NUS, so that the college can tap on the resources and expertise as well as the reputation of the former.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Michael Palmer (Pasir Ris-Punggol)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This has been a long time coming.&nbsp; I look forward to the report that is currently being prepared by a committee chaired by the Minister of State, Lui Tuck Yew.&nbsp; With the establishment of a fourth university, the cohort participation rate, which is the number of students in Primary 1 that will receive a subsidised university education, will be increased from 25% to 30% by 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that almost&nbsp;one in&nbsp;three Primary 1 students will go to one&nbsp;of the&nbsp;four universities.&nbsp; This clearly fits with our efforts to ensure that we have a highly skilled workforce at all levels.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mentioned that the fourth university was a long time coming because in December 2000, a similar committee was formed and chaired by then Senior Minister of State, Mr Peter Chen, to consider various matters including possibly establishing a fourth university.&nbsp; In its interim report submitted in July 2001, Mr Chen's committee said that Singapore needs a fourth university with a strong practical and technical focus.&nbsp; This was reaffirmed in its final report submitted in February 2002.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following that, a new inter-Ministry panel headed by then Minister of State, Dr Ng Eng Hen, was formed to review the proposal for a fourth university.&nbsp; In January 2003, Dr Ng's panel dropped the idea of a fourth university.&nbsp; It instead proposed that NUS and NTU be expanded.&nbsp; Could I ask the Minister why there was this&nbsp;change in direction?&nbsp; What has changed between then and now so that a fourth university is back on the table?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1850<p> Could I also ask the Minister to update us on the progress that has been made by the committee chaired by Minister of State Lui?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been much speculation with regard to the positioning of the fourth university.&nbsp; Minister of State Lui has been quoted as saying that it could include a Liberal Arts College, whilst Minister Teo Chee Hean has said that the fourth university should lean towards being science and technology based.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;Whether a Liberal Arts College is still on the cards?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;If so, will it be part of or separate from the&nbsp;fourth university?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;Whether the Minister feels that Singapore is ready for a Liberal Arts College given that it may espouse radical views and ideas, some of which may be highly critical of our society, politics and philosophy?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Jessie Phua (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Tertiary Education for Athletes</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Jessie Phua (Nominated Member):</B> Sir, it is important to give opportunities to all students and cater to their different needs.&nbsp; If you make the effort, we will help you&nbsp;to do&nbsp;even better and give you every opportunity to get ahead.&nbsp; Our Prime Minister, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, said this at the launch of the Lee Hsien Loong Award for special achievements two weeks ago.&nbsp; As a Singaporean and as a parent, I can tell you how heartwarming that message was -&nbsp;that we are sincerely working towards being an inclusive society.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is wonderful that efforts are being made to work towards helping to level up the academically less-inclined Singaporean students, hopefully, this being the first of many to follow.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst on the subject of students, I would like to take this opportunity to <p align=left>Column: 1851<p>bring to the attention of this House the cry for help by another Singaporean student group:&nbsp;the student athletes for the tertiary education.&nbsp; Whilst there is in place some semblance of assistance in our education system to help athletes manage books, sports and studies at the tertiary level, these efforts are often sporadic, limiting and not embracing enough.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us&nbsp;take a look at what is&nbsp;available in Singapore.&nbsp; For the Singapore Sports School students where a through train system is in place to assist student athletes, only a diploma option is available with either the Republic Polytechnic or the Auckland University of Technology (AUT).&nbsp;&nbsp;While students can offer any courses at the&nbsp;Republic Polytechnic, what is not readily available is a dedicated athletic counsellor to assist with the scheduling of classes for&nbsp;semester if training or competition is in the school term and only sports science courses are available with the AUT tie-up.&nbsp; Like the rest of the school system in Singapore, the final stop station for the through train is&nbsp;at the&nbsp;Junior College&nbsp;or diploma level.&nbsp; If this specially tailored assistance plan for the Sports School students is the best scheme we can put in place&nbsp;to help students whom, from the word \"go\", have been put on a different education track from the age of 13, I cannot help but feel things cannot be better for&nbsp;other athletes from the mainstream schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let us look at how adequate is our current support system at the local universities.&nbsp; What recognition mechanism is in place at NUS, NTU or SMU?&nbsp; To give our nationally carded athletes a little bit more consideration for admission, how flexible are we to help these athletes gain entry into the faculty of choice?&nbsp; Topping athletes' list of concerns is the school timetable and scheduling.&nbsp; Yes, some level of leeway is available now but we can <p align=left>Column: 1852<p>definitely do better.&nbsp; Talk to any undergraduate athletes and they are only too willing to share with you the nightmares of applying for time-off for training and competitions, and&nbsp;how the process often leaves them so disheartened, disillusioned and tired out.&nbsp; For faculties like medicine or law, athletes suffer even more as their courses are not modular, which means that they cannot just simply take an extra semester to make up for what they have missed because of competition.&nbsp; They pay the higher price of having to skip a year if they miss a semester.&nbsp; Admittedly difficult, but lucky medical student and national bowler, Valerie Teo, is a fine example where the support and help of understanding professors&nbsp;can make the difference.&nbsp; Her example proves that it is very do-able if we have our hearts in the right place.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we replicate what the US colleges have to offer?&nbsp; A support system built up to ensure that&nbsp;athletes get to be students too, where athletic advisors are available to directly address the special needs of student athletes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area of concern for this student group is&nbsp;funding for&nbsp;scholarship.&nbsp; Other undergraduates can reduce their parents' financial burdens by taking on part-time jobs or giving tuitions but athletes have no such opportunity.&nbsp; Cost of sporting equipment and travel&nbsp;can be quite substantial too.&nbsp; Taking a five-year modular course against a three-year course also means more school fees involved.&nbsp; Offering financial aid not only gives these athletes some peace of mind, more importantly, it is a morale booster to know that your country is behind you.&nbsp; Assistance with university admission, choice of faculty, athletic counsellor and financial aids -&nbsp;all these are so crucial towards building that nurturing environment for our student athletes to shine in both arenas.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is whether Singapore is prepared to go the extra mile to put in place a fully integrated system <p align=left>Column: 1853<p>for this group of Singaporeans.&nbsp; If we do nothing to address this, we may lose these students to overseas colleges and&nbsp;run the risk of losing them to the international job market or not returning home at all.&nbsp; The ball is in our court.&nbsp; How inclusive do we strive to be?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Education (RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

SMU is a young institution but already it&nbsp;has established&nbsp;a distinctive niche and has delivered on its brand promise to produce graduates who are confident, resourceful and strong team players.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1854<p>\r\n<p>1.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our universities will continue to build up their quality in undergraduate education, and seek to develop new peaks of excellence.&nbsp; In the medium term, NUS and NTU have indicated they wish to maintain the size of their current undergraduate intakes, improve the quality of their undergraduate&nbsp;programmes, especially by improving student-faculty ratios, and further develop their postgraduate and research programmes.&nbsp; SMU would like to expand its annual undergraduate intake gradually to about 2,000 students from about&nbsp;1,600 yesterday through additional programmes, while enhancing its postgraduate education offerings and further strengthening its research capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first address Mrs Jessie Phua's question on student athletes in our tertiary institutions, and I will confine what I want to say to what is happening in our universities.&nbsp; Let me first say that sporting achievements&nbsp;are taken into consideration in the discretionary admission frameworks of both NUS and NTU.&nbsp;&nbsp;SMU considers sporting achievements as part of its broad-based admission process.&nbsp; Since 2000, SMU alone has admitted about 40 applicants whose exceptional performance in sports was&nbsp;the key factor in their admission, and after admission, of course, they compete for courses based on merit.&nbsp; In the universities, the Deans of the various faculties will work closely with student athletes to try and help find a right balance between excellence in their sporting and academic pursuits.&nbsp; Student athletes do have&nbsp;some flexibility, though admittedly not as much as they would like, but they have some flexibility to adjust their academic timetables to accommodate training and competition schedules.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say a little bit more on this when I come to the Fourth University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Biow Chuan mentioned briefly the importance of values, how they are&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1855<p>taught in the universities.&nbsp; Our universities recognise the need to and believe strongly in nurturing well-rounded graduates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They take a holistic approach towards the inculcation of values in their students.&nbsp; Because they are largely dealing with adults,&nbsp;the universities strongly encourage the students to take the lead to find meaningful ways to contribute to community and voluntary organisations.&nbsp; So this will&nbsp;cultivate in students a greater consciousness of service to community and country.&nbsp; A number of them also have the opportunity to participate in humanitarian projects outside Singapore with some support from the university.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen their sense of belonging to Singapore, the universities engage the students through multiple avenues on broad trends and challenges facing the country, and encourage them to reflect on the roles that they can play to help build a better Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I proceed to elaborate further on the preliminary findings of&nbsp;the Committee, let me first touch on two issues that are of immediate interest to university-going students and their parents.&nbsp; These are, firstly, the number of university places that we will be offering in the next few years, and, secondly, the recent fee increases implemented by our universities and this was also brought up by Members like Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Ms Sylvia Lim, Dr Lily Neo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, we have increased the number of places in the three autonomous universities to provide more students with a subsidised university education.&nbsp; We will continue to do so judiciously.&nbsp; I am pleased to announce that MOE has worked closely with our three publicly-funded universities to achieve the target for 25% of each Singaporean Primary&nbsp;1 cohort to receive a subsidised university education by 2008, <p align=left>Column: 1856<p>ahead of the original target that was set for&nbsp;2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2007, we increased the number of university places significantly due to the large cohort size.&nbsp; For 2008, our universities will provide the same number of places as for 2007&nbsp;- about 14,700.&nbsp; As the size of the cohort in 2008 is significantly smaller than 2007, this will enable slightly above 25% of a cohort to obtain places this year, compared to 23.5% last year.&nbsp; For 2009, we will provide an additional 900 places to cater to the larger cohort in that year, in order to maintain the participation rate for the cohort&nbsp;at 25%. Beyond this, we will scale up the number of places accordingly as we move towards the new participation rate of 30% by 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch briefly now on university fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked the Government to increase education grants to the universities so that they would not have to increase fees.&nbsp; He also compared our universities with Stanford and Princeton in the US which waive tuition fees and provide large grants for some students.&nbsp; Let me clarify why this is not an accurate comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Princeton and Stanford are private institutions with significant endowments, and it is estimated that they have&nbsp;more than US$15 billion each and they are institutions that charge high fees.&nbsp; Their student population is small, about 5,000&nbsp;to 6,000 students each.&nbsp; They draw some of the best students from across the United States and the world.&nbsp; Students in need of financial support are funded to a significant extent through proceeds from the endowment, and not from the federal, state or local government.&nbsp; It is a noteworthy effort, but overall it benefits only a very small percentage of students from the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, our three universities provide a high quality education to about <p align=left>Column: 1857<p>25% of each student cohort.&nbsp; The student population in NUS and NTU number more than 20,000 each. &nbsp;Their endowments are small but growing slowly.&nbsp; Their primary source of funding is from the Government, from taxpayers. Government invests heavily in our universities and provides substantial subsidies at 75% of the cost of educating each undergraduate.&nbsp; We have increased the amount of financial aid available to students over the years.&nbsp; Approximately $120&nbsp;million of financial aid comprising bursaries and loans was given to students in the 2006 financial year, compared to&nbsp;about $81&nbsp;million in 2003. The Government has recently announced that bursaries will cover up to the 66th percentile of households by income. For those who are outside this income group or prefer not to take up bursaries, there are other financial assistance schemes available.&nbsp; In terms of scholarships, students have a wide range to choose from, offered by the Government, universities and many by the private sector.&nbsp; I think this is evident from the countless scholarship advertisements we find in our local newspapers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Ms Lim&rsquo;s question, let me say that as the major source for universities, the Government monitors carefully to ensure that fees are set reasonably.&nbsp; We work closely with the universities on any proposed increase in fees to assess its impact on affordability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our universities are cost conscious and fiscally prudent.&nbsp; They are required to put in place appropriate internal controls and procedures to ensure proper accountability of their financial resources, proper budgeting and financial reporting systems.&nbsp; These are all&nbsp;subject to regular audits, including audits that are commissioned by the Ministry of Education. They take active cost control measures which include reducing administrative staff headcount, bulk tendering of goods and services, outsourcing non-core activities and leveraging on IT to <p align=left>Column: 1858<p>improve productivity.&nbsp; The universities are incentivised to do so and benefit directly from such measures as they can keep the surplus and use it at an appropriate time to fund new activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest component of&nbsp;universities' expenditure, approximately 70%, goes towards manpower costs. Our universities must pay competitive wages if they are to compete effectively against global competition to attract and retain top quality faculty.&nbsp; This is necessary in order for the universities to uphold the quality of education they provide.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, tuition fees will have to be raised in accordance with the higher costs of providing a quality education.&nbsp; In doing so, the universities will provide students and parents&nbsp;with more certainty with regard to the financial outlay required for a university education.&nbsp; Starting from this&nbsp;Academic Year, all three universities will adopt a cohort-based fee-setting approach which means that universities will maintain a student's fees at the level set during his&nbsp;or her&nbsp;first year of study, for the entire duration of the programme.&nbsp; Students, who were admitted prior to 2008 will continue to pay fees set at the 2007 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most students entering NUS and NTU in 2008 will face a one-off fee increase of 4%, and this is&nbsp;equivalent to about $250 per year compared to the existing students.&nbsp; Because&nbsp;their fees for subsequent years are fixed at this level, this translates into an annualised increase of about 1.6% over a four-year course of study.&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim mentioned law students.&nbsp; I think they are a very small number of them and they will face fee increases of about 20% which over the four-year period works out, I believe, to about 7 1/2% per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate that the Government and the universities remain committed to ensuring that admission to <p align=left>Column: 1859<p>university remains needs-blind, and that no able student will be denied a university education because of cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to provide Members with more details on my Committee's deliberations thus far.&nbsp; Apart from developments in our existing universities, we have looked into how the university sector should be expanded and positioned in the long term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The university sector has served our economy and people well.&nbsp; The graduates they produce are held in high regard, find gainful employment both at home and abroad and make meaningful contributions to the country both economically and socially.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economy is growing well and the demand for university graduates is expected to grow across all sectors in the years ahead.&nbsp; Our companies have taken up the clarion call to expand their footprint overseas and this will bring new opportunities and challenges.&nbsp; We need graduates who have strong academic fundamentals, yet are bold, prepared to take calculated risks and possess an entrepreneurial spirit.&nbsp; They must be adept at operating in new and unfamiliar environments, able to seek out and exploit new opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of demand for university education, more students aspire to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;As they continue to benefit from improvements made to the primary, secondary and post-secondary education system, more will be equipped to benefit from a university education.&nbsp; Hence, there is a need to grow the university sector, carefully and judiciously, to provide more students the opportunity for a high quality, high value university education in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1860<p>With an expanded university sector, we can also afford to take in more outstanding foreign students to pursue their undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in Singapore.&nbsp; Some of them will remain after their studies, sink roots, contribute to our society and eventually add to our population as citizens and Permanent Residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide for an increase in target participation rate for each cohort&nbsp;from 25% to 30% by 2015, we will need approximately 2,400 additional university places each year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Amy Khor and Mr Michael Palmer have pointed out, the Government had previously considered establishing a Fourth University.&nbsp; The decision was eventually taken to leverage on the reputation of NUS and NTU, and expand these to meet the additional university places required to increase the participation rate then&nbsp;from 21% to 25%.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation then was different.&nbsp; First, NUS and NTU still had the capacity to expand. NTU, for example, did so by broadening its disciplinary coverage to become a more comprehensive university. Today, NUS and NTU are large, even by international standards.&nbsp; Going forward, it would be detrimental to expand the undergraduate intakes for NUS and NTU much more as we risk eroding the quality of their programmes and the experience in university for our students.&nbsp; SMU plans to gradually increase its undergraduate intake by about 500 but this will not be sufficient to meet the additional places required.&nbsp;That was the first reason.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, SMU was then a fledgling institution.&nbsp; It was set up as an independent university, it&nbsp;had its own mission and governance, charted its own course and we now know that it has <p align=left>Column: 1861<p>successfully become&nbsp;a differentiated and well-regarded institution within a few years of its establishment.&nbsp; As Dr Khor has rightly observed, the experience with SMU shows that it is possible for a new university to build up its reputation, and to be accepted by the public and employers within a reasonable period of time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these factors, taken together, tell us and give us confidence that a new university will be needed, it will be a viable and well-received addition to our university sector.&nbsp; Setting up a new university that is independent of our existing universities offers the best chance of creating an institution that will develop its own unique identity, character and model of education to add real diversity in educational approaches.&nbsp; Doing so will also limit any dilution of management focus at NUS and NTU at a time when they are determined to move up in quality and standing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase in the number of university places, we can provide proportionately more polytechnic students with subsidised university places than is the case today.&nbsp; The number of students with good O-level results choosing a polytechnic education has increased over the years.&nbsp; At present, fewer than one in six polytechnic graduates proceed to one of our autonomous universities.&nbsp; Over time, this can improve to better than one in five.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In providing more subsidised university places, we will also make our university landscape more diverse, provide our students with more pathways that encourage and allow more peaks of excellence to emerge.&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this, my Committee envisages two new institutions, a new publicly-funded university and a small Liberal Arts College that will add new options and diversity to our overall&nbsp;landscape.&nbsp; On this note, I would like to thank Dr Amy Khor and&nbsp;Mr Michael <p align=left>Column: 1862<p>Palmer for providing their views on the new university as well as&nbsp;the Liberal Arts College, much of which is aligned to what we are currently&nbsp;thinking about.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me provide the Committee&rsquo;s preliminary recommendations on the new university, and may I emphasise that these are still preliminary recommendations.&nbsp; The Committee considered the shape and needs of the economy in the years to come, consulted widely with industry leaders, parents and students and looked at possible models and approaches to university education in the US and Europe.&nbsp; We have distilled the research and feedback to suggest some features for the new university that we believe will give it a distinctive character and position it to produce graduates who are well prepared for the challenges of the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than catering primarily to polytechnic students, the Committee envisions that the new university&rsquo;s innovative approach to education would appeal to students of various educational backgrounds, including both A-level and polytechnic graduates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new university, in terms of its approach,&nbsp;can consider adopting an integrated, inter-disciplinary approach to learning. &nbsp;Many universities currently have inter-disciplinary programmes that aim to bridge the divide between faculties.&nbsp; But, for many of them,&nbsp;pre-existing conditions, such as organisational structure and culture, budgeting and manpower allocation sometimes limit the extent of such programmes and how much they can achieve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new university will start with the advantage of not having to fight against such legacies.&nbsp; Instead of the traditional rigid boundaries around disciplines, its programmes can be formulated so that there is significant integration from the onset, between areas, such as engineering and design or engineering and business.&nbsp; Graduates will have a sound <p align=left>Column: 1863<p>fundamental knowledge of engineering, design or business -&nbsp;here, I am giving them as examples - but will also recognise and appreciate that it is at the boundaries of the traditional disciplines that the most exciting learning will take place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring greater focus to such learning and collaboration across disciplinary boundaries, the new university could set up inter-disciplinary centres focused around specific themes.&nbsp; For example, centres could be established focusing on future urban environments and sustainable development, bringing together students from disciplines, such as design and architecture, engineering and business, to work together in multi-disciplinary project teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, apart from emphasising inter-disciplinary learning, the new university could also emphasise real-world experience that would require students to apply their classroom learning in a practical context.&nbsp; They could compete for long-term internships, each lasting about six months, in a wide range of companies where they can be fully immersed in the working world. &nbsp;Through these experiences, all students will develop important skills like communication and teamwork, while also having the opportunity to gain a significant amount of working experience even before they graduate.&nbsp; CEOs we have spoken to have affirmed this approach&nbsp;as it will give companies and undergraduates an opportunity to size&nbsp;each other up, and would produce graduates who were more work-ready when they step into the workforce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entrepreneurship should also be a key feature of the new university's core curriculum.&nbsp; However, entrepreneurship is not something that is best cultivated and developed within the confines of the <p align=left>Column: 1864<p>classroom. &nbsp;The new university could encourage this entrepreneurial spirit by offering students the flexibility to disrupt their studies for a year or two - just as they will offer this to other students as well for other purposes - in order to start&nbsp;their own businesses.&nbsp; Should they choose to, they can then come back to university at a future point in time to complete their degrees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While elements of&nbsp;integrated learning, real world experience and entrepreneurship already exist in our three autonomous universities, the new university could consider how to best integrate these elements and take them further.&nbsp; These should be supported by high quality teaching and close interaction between students and faculty in smaller group settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new university could also focus less on basic research but more on solutions-directed research that aims to provide practical and effective answers to problems that industry and companies face in the near and medium term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the disciplines and academic programme to be offered,&nbsp;this will have to be studied and determined in due course by the management of the new university.&nbsp; But&nbsp;it is worthwhile to share the&nbsp;feedback that we have received from students and parents on the areas they were most interested in and areas that they felt were under-served.&nbsp; We also heard from different industry sectors on the areas they think could offer significant growth opportunities in the years to come.&nbsp; Feedback coalesced around the interplay between the fields of design, engineering and business, which is why I offered them as examples.&nbsp; This interplay of disciplines could also&nbsp;focus on areas of growth, such as clean technology, sustainable building design, and tourism and hospitality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was felt that a combination of such programmes would support the new <p align=left>Column: 1865<p>university's integrated, inter-disciplinary approach, and would provide rich opportunities for learning and collaboration.&nbsp; For example, its engineering students could practise design thinking and principles to help them come up with creative solutions and products that are attuned to users' needs.&nbsp; They would also be well-versed in the business aspects of engineering that will help them develop strong project management and entrepreneurial skills.&nbsp; Such a combination of disciplines, brought together under an inter-disciplinary approach, has been successfully demonstrated in overseas institutions, such as Stanford University&rsquo;s Institute of Design.&nbsp; The synergy between these three disciplines can also be seen at the industry level when we consider products, such as Apple&rsquo;s iPhone and iPod Touch, because combine superior design with sound engineering and savvy marketing to create merchandise that unlocks new value and markets and which a whole generation raves about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Committee envisions that this&nbsp;new university would have an eventual intake of between 2,500 and 3,000 students.&nbsp; It will take a few years to get the new university started, and the initial intake will have to be smaller, say, at about 500 students.&nbsp; We believe that the new university will complement our existing universities and, at the same time, inject a new approach and a fresh element of competition into the university sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the subject of a liberal arts college.&nbsp; What sets a top liberal arts college apart is a broad-based multi-disciplinary education that may encompass the natural and social sciences, mathematics and humanities, and even engineering for some of them,&nbsp;and a small student intake of between 200 and 300 each year whose calibre is comparable to the best in the Ivy League universities.&nbsp; Their intake size allows for intense interaction among students and with faculty to create a stimulating environ<p align=left>Column: 1866<p>ment.&nbsp; It is an attractive model of education that will offer a valuable and intellectually invigorating alternative for a small number of our brightest students, as well as draw top foreign students from the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An independent, privately-funded liberal arts college, which is the norm in the United States, would, I believe,&nbsp;not be viable in Singapore at this point.&nbsp; As Dr Amy Khor had rightly pointed out, such a liberal arts college is very costly to set up.&nbsp; As students and parents are not sufficiently familiar with the benefits of the liberal arts model of education, they are unlikely to pay the high fees that such a college would charge.&nbsp; Instead, my Committee&rsquo;s preliminary recommendation is to establish Singapore&rsquo;s first liberal arts college as an affiliate to one of our existing universities, similar, for example, to Barnard College which is affiliated to Columbia University.&nbsp; As an affiliate, it will benefit from being able to leverage on the branding and resources of the parent university.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUS has carried out an in-depth study and submitted a proposal to establish a Liberal Arts College as a self-contained autonomous entity similar to the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory or the NUS-Duke Graduate Medical School.&nbsp; SMU is also considering ways in which it could offer a liberal arts education to its students as it expands its disciplinary coverage.&nbsp; We will study these two proposals further before we make a recommendation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this topic, I would like to thank Mr Michael Palmer for his question on whether the Government is prepared for radical views that could come out of a liberal arts learning environment.&nbsp; One of the purposes of establishing such a&nbsp;college is to develop future leaders who are thoughtful, with independent ideas and robust views sharpened through the cut and thrust of daily intellectual discourse.&nbsp; Tempered by the experience <p align=left>Column: 1867<p>and mentorship of their professors, these students will be well placed to become leaders working for the betterment of society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the new university and the liberal arts college, we will increase the number of collaborations between our polytechnics and specialised institutions offering degrees in niche areas.&nbsp; This will allow more students across a wider selection of disciplines to benefit from the subsidies that the Government provides to those enrolled in these programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the longer term, beyond these&nbsp;collaborations, my Committee feels that we should also study the possibility of extending subsidies to a pre-defined number of students taking high quality degree programmes offered by other reputed institutions in Singapore, including in niche areas, such as the Arts.&nbsp; This would add more diversity to our university landscape and open up additional avenues for our students to pursue a subsidised university education.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, as the Minister for Finance has mentioned in his Budget Speech, we&nbsp;will also co-fund working adults who are citizens and PRs seeking their first university degree through the Continuing Education and Training programmes at UniSIM and our autonomous universities.&nbsp; We estimate that about 8,000 adults will benefit from this scheme each year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me conclude.&nbsp; My Committee envisions that Singapore's publicly-funded university landscape in the longer term will comprise:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Two large universities, NUS and NTU, each offering a comprehensive suite of high quality undergraduate programmes and with a strong focus on postgraduate education and research;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1868<p> (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Two mid-sized universities, SMU and the new university, each offering a focused selection of degree programmes;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; There will be a number of quality institutions offering degree programmes in niche areas, either independently or in collaboration with the polytechnics; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time degree-level CET programmes offered through local universities to provide working adults with an opportunity to obtain a subsidised&nbsp;education at the tertiary level on a part-time basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The increase in university participation and proposed additions to this&nbsp;sector will require a corresponding increase in funding for the higher education sector, and I hope you will all support this in due course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on current estimates, it is projected that the expansion of the university sector will require an increase in the annual university sector budget and MOE's budget&nbsp;of up to 0.2% of GDP.&nbsp;&nbsp;With these changes and new elements, I am confident that Singapore&rsquo;s university sector will be well-positioned to serve both the needs of our economy and the aspirations of our young people in the years to come.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Contrary to such expectations, a licence granted by our MOE means nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government needs to address this issue and introduce measures and regulations to ensure that PEOs are able to deliver on their promise.&nbsp; Objective and credible assessments with regard to the curriculum offered by the PEOs should be carried out before they are allowed to provide their services&nbsp;locally.

In addition, the private educational sector is growing rapidly in meeting rising demands. We have about 1,000 private education centres operating in Singapore offering various types of courses and conferring degrees of a multitude of importance.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Globally, it is estimated that there are about three million students going overseas for studies annually. The top three sources of foreign students in Singapore are from China, India and Vietnam. It is a growing market&nbsp;of economic importance. We have about 80,000 foreign students of whom about half&nbsp;are studying in a private education sector. A student doing a degree course is <p align=left>Column: 1871<p>estimated to spend about $20,000 a year in fee and living expense. Over four years, they are expected to&nbsp;spent a total of about $80,000. The money they bring into our economy suggests this is no small sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In choosing where to go, it is a complex and confusing picture to potential students aspiring to come to Singapore. The Singapore brand name certainly is one of the deciding factors for them because foreign students believe that all our private education institutions are of&nbsp; a&nbsp;high standard because of our excellent private education system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the reality is that the only accreditation system of private education centres is CaseTrust.&nbsp; CaseTrust does not accredit a private school's core competency in the academic standard. Rather, its main concern is on the school's refund and compensation ability and system. This has been alluded to by my fellow Members, Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, just now. So the consequences of the lack of proper accreditation and regulations of private school have been illustrated by the recent newspaper report. This unfortunately is tarnishing our Singapore brand name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we should ensure that, in addition to good education, these foreign students should return home with fond memories of Singapore.&nbsp; They will then become our ambassadors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have in this House asked for the setting up of an accreditation system to benchmark private schools in terms of providing quality education. And this year, I would like to urge the MOE to reconsider my call. We need to ensure that private operators are not degree mills and just out to&nbsp;take advantage of&nbsp;innocent overseas students. Accreditation would mean that it would also directly protect Singapore <p align=left>Column: 1872<p>image as a place where education excellence is assured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Quality Private Education</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> Sir, it is estimated that there are currently some 1,200 operators of private schools in Singapore offering courses ranging from English language and computer classes to diplomas and degrees. Private education is now a significant business sector with some 37,000 foreign students.&nbsp;The implications of this sector on the economy, efforts to promote Singapore as an education hub and the integrity of the Singapore brand, are quite obvious. It is none too soon that the Education Ministry will be putting in place tighter measures to ensure minimum standards in the private education sector.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's reputation for its high quality public education system has laid out many foreign students to our shores but the reality is that these private schools are of very uneven quality and strength.&nbsp; Presently, an aspiring school operator only needs to register the school with the MOE and those who want to enrol foreign students need only to have the CaseTrust education mark. But there are no measures to ensure minimum standards in the teaching and the quality of courses offered and there are still many schools with questionable credentials preying on the unsuspecting students. Reports are rife of private schools who put out misleading advertisements about their facilities, the quality of their teaching staff and the courses offered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some, as&nbsp;my colleagues before me have noted, are <I>de facto</I> degree mills which&nbsp;give out degrees to students who do little or no academic work. It was even reported in the press that two school owners are actually involved in the running of&nbsp;karaoke, KTV bars and night clubs. If proven true, this is indeed a shameful state of affairs.&nbsp;Many of them <p align=left>Column: 1873<p>also advertise themselves as MOE registered centres, giving the public the perception that they are endorsed by MOE.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore's brand name&nbsp;will certainly be ruined if this state of affairs&nbsp;is allowed to continue. It is not&nbsp;enough to rely&nbsp;on the industry's self-regulation or intervention by&nbsp;Case since these are&nbsp;reactive measures.&nbsp; Hence, I welcome MOE's move to set some minimum mandatory&nbsp;standards for these&nbsp;private institutions. That said, as the schools offer a diverse range of courses, it will not be easy for MOE to require some minimum standard of quality for the courses offered, the teaching staff, the management of the school and its facilities. To do this, the MOE would have to put in resources and manpower with relevant expertise. Perhaps the MOE could also enlist the help of the relevant professional institutions and our existing publicly funded polytechnics and universities to help accredit the diplomas and the degrees offered. The oversight of these private schools to ensure minimum standards must be comprehensive and should cover the adequacy of the facilities and infrastructure provided, the school's administration and management structure and practices as well as the quality of the courses offered and the teaching staff.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Private Schools</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lily Neo:</B> Sir, I have raised the quality of our private schools, numbering about 1,200 of them, before, and was told that it was under study.

This is a welcomed move.&nbsp; It will enable working Singaporeans who did not have a chance to fulfill their aspirations of getting a university degree to do so with greater financial support.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a working person has to make significant investments of time and effort to acquire formal qualifications, whether these are skill certificates or degree programmes.&nbsp; However, typically, degree level courses are going to be more costly and of longer duration than skill-based courses. For example, a three-year part-time degree programme in Business at the UniSim costs around $24,000. In contrast, a eight-week programme leading to a certificate in Real Estate Management and Maintenance costs $5,130, so there is a great difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;While we recognise that there are some who just want to get a degree, most working adults do hope that their degree qualifications will open up career development opportunities that will <p align=left>Column: 1875<p>lead to better jobs and better lives. In other words, it should not be just a paper chase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in some cases, the pursuit of a degree turns out, in fact, to have been just a paper chase with no real returns. On one of my house visits in Toa Payoh, I came across a young resident in her early 20s. When I asked her what work she did, she told me she was studying for a degree on a part-time basis. When I asked her what she has been doing before this, she said that she had been working as a sales person after dropping out from ITE without finishing her Nitec course. I asked her whether she had considered other options, such as courses offered by the Singapore Institute of&nbsp; Retail Studies. She said she did not know that it existed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure what sort of a degree the young lady would be getting and whether her career prospects would improve. It certainly makes me wonder whether she and others like her had received proper counselling before paying her deposit for a degree course.&nbsp; Did anyone help her to assess her strengths and inform her of the various options available to her?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be a poor use of resources when Singaporeans start a part-time degree programme lured by attractive marketing and now a substantial subsidy, only to realise a few years later that there were other options that might have been more suited to him or her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to ask the MOE if its role in degree level and continuing education and training extends to ensuring the improved employability of graduands.&nbsp; How does it intend to fulfill this role and what kind of career opportunities does it see opening up for such graduands?&nbsp; In addition, I would like to ask the MOE if it plans to coordinate with the MOM to provide proper career counselling to potential students on part-time degree <p align=left>Column: 1876<p>programmes. For example, if a potential student approaches any of the universities to apply for a part-time degree course, could MOE please ensure that there be career counsellors on hand to inform the students on the alternative CET options, leading to other qualifications besides a degree. Likewise, the MOM-funded training providers should also have a good working knowledge of part-time degree options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask how the MOE can help to make this happen. I also would like to ask the MOE to take steps to ensure that the relevant pages on the Ministry's websites are hyperlinked so that anyone doing an online research on CET options in Singapore will get a holistic picture. Another important step is to equip career counsellors, whether they are at the universities, polytechnics and ITEs with the necessary information. They should be familiar with the CET master plan and how degree-level CET fits in the bigger picture. So it is critical that proper advice and counselling is given to potential students, especially if these students are working adults for whom this is a very important second chance. I call on the MOE to take on this task seriously and to aim to help all aspiring graduands make well-informed choices.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim (Marine Parade)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Singaporeans are fortunate to be able to make the choices from the wide options available to them.&nbsp; However, these wide choices also present them <p align=left>Column: 1877<p>with the challenge of having to select the right and appropriate courses and institutions.&nbsp; This, coupled with the good marketing slant companies selling these courses, makes the selection process more challenging for someone who wishes to undertake a course.&nbsp; As a result, I have received feedback -&nbsp;the excitement&nbsp;Singaporeans felt -&nbsp;that upon completion of their courses, they realised that their courses and overseas institutions that they selected are not highly regarded, or not perceived to be good degrees for employers when they seek job opportunities, and local tertiary institutions when they want to pursue higher degree programmes in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me share with you two examples of Singaporeans, who having obtained a good diploma from a local polytechnic, pursued a degree course overseas.&nbsp; One Singaporean&nbsp;completed his degree course within one and a half years, due to the exemptions he obtained for the relevant modules he had undertaken during his diploma studies.&nbsp; Upon graduation, he faced problems with regard to the perception of his degree by his employer and local tertiary institutions when he wanted to pursue a higher degree in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another Singaporean took an external degree programme from a commercial school in Singapore, which advertised that it was an institution that was registered with the MOE.&nbsp; However, he later found that the external degree was from a university which is a very small institution overseas that is not even highly regarded in its home country.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These Singaporeans wished that they had more avenues to seek for independent references or advice during the selection process.&nbsp; In view of Singapore's aim of becoming an education hub, in particular private education hub, I would like to <p align=left>Column: 1878<p>suggest that we improve this process to benefit Singaporeans who are thinking of pursuing&nbsp;an external degree in Singapore or overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to suggest that&nbsp;MOE develop a framework that will provide a reference point or advice for students who wish to pursue an external degree.&nbsp; The role of professional bodies could also be enhanced in improving this process.&nbsp; I would like to know how the MOE plans to improve the current state to assist Singaporeans to make an informed choice in the selection of courses in overseas universities to pursue their external degrees.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Education (Mr Gan Kim Yong):</B> Yes, Sir.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recently launched a 10-year Continuing Education and Training&nbsp;(CET) Masterplan.&nbsp; Under the Masterplan, we will work with our post-secondary educational institutions and credible private players to establish a number of high-quality CET institutes to support our manpower needs.&nbsp; The Ministry of Manpower, with MOE's support, is planning to quadruple CET capacity within just two years, from training 22,000 workers last year, to 80,000 workers by 2009.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with our efforts to encourage life-long learning, MOE announced last year that the Government would subsidise part-time Advanced Diploma and Specialist Diploma programmes in the polytechnics, which are aimed at adult learners.&nbsp; We have now extended our funding support to part-time degree programmes as announced in the Budget Speech this year.&nbsp; These are significant moves towards our objective of creating a learning nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1879<p>I thank Mrs Josephine Teo for her support for the Government's efforts to improve accessibility and affordability of CET.&nbsp; I agree with Mrs Teo that it is important for Singaporeans who further their education or training with the aid of Government subsidy to derive meaningful value from the investment.&nbsp; This is particularly so for degree courses, as the cost in terms of time and money is considerably higher.&nbsp; While the Government cannot influence how employers pay CET degree-holders, as this is really up to the market to decide, there are two things the Government can do and has done so as&nbsp;to ensure that our part-time degree programmes will add value to the students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to ensure that the programmes we subsidise are of good quality.&nbsp; This is why MOE is making funding support available only for part-time degree programmes in the National University of Singapore (NUS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore Management University (SMU) and SIM University (UniSIM).&nbsp; We have selected institutions of high repute, which we are confident will continue to uphold their standards and requirements pertaining to admission, progression and completion.&nbsp; MOE has established a Quality Assurance Framework for NUS, NTU and SMU.&nbsp; UniSIM is the only private institution to date that MOE has assessed as being of sufficient quality to be accorded university status and to award degrees in its own name.&nbsp; With the Government now funding its programmes, MOE will put in place a process to ensure that UniSIM upholds the quality of its publicly-funded degree programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will continue to monitor industry and economic trends, and provide the information to workers who wish to upgrade themselves.&nbsp; MOM recently launched the Career Compass 2008, <p align=left>Column: 1880<p>which can be downloaded from MOM's website.&nbsp; Career Compass provides students with a better understanding of opportunities in the job market.&nbsp; It covers industry and manpower trends, as well as occupational information, such as skills needed, employment conditions and wages.&nbsp; MOE will work with NUS, NTU, SMU and UniSIM to track their CET students' progress after graduation.&nbsp; This will enable the universities to further improve their part-time degree programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the universities themselves provide counselling and advice to potential applicants.&nbsp; NUS and NTU conduct pre-application briefing sessions as part of their admission exercises for part-time degree programmes.&nbsp; These sessions can help to address students' questions about industry demand and the relevance of the degree programmes.&nbsp; UniSIM also organises regular Open House events to advise potential applicants on the appropriate choice of part-time degree programmes, depending on the applicants' employment background and career aspirations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, as I mentioned earlier, the universities have stringent admission, progression and completion criteria.&nbsp; This ensures that only students who can benefit from a part-time degree education are admitted, and are allowed to continue and eventually graduate.&nbsp; These measures on the part of the universities help guide workers with different aspirations and aptitudes to choose the appropriate CET option for their career development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim raised the concern that some who enrol in degree programmes may later on find that their degrees are not well-regarded by employers or by local universities for the purpose of postgraduate studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE-registered private schools are allowed to offer external degrees awarded by <I>bona fide</I> universities which are <p align=left>Column: 1881<p>recognised in their home countries.&nbsp; It is in the interest of these universities to ensure that the&nbsp;schools offering external degrees bearing their names are of acceptable quality to protect their own standing and reputation.&nbsp; As these foreign universities are recognised by their own governments, MOE does not grant any further recognition&nbsp;or accreditation for their degrees.&nbsp; However, even among these <I>bona fide</I> universities, there are wide variations in reputation and standing.&nbsp; If an external degree programme has undemanding admission and coursework requirements, it should come as no surprise that its value to the students is correspondingly low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand students' desire to obtain a degree.&nbsp; However, I would urge them to be selective and find out more about the programmes and the institutions before making a commitment.&nbsp; They should consider carefully the rigour of the programmes and the track record of the institutions offering the programmes to ensure that they will benefit from these programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE is also not in a position to influence employers on the recognition of qualifications, as each individual employer has its own requirements and criteria.&nbsp; Employers will determine which qualifications are most relevant to their needs, and how much value to accord to different qualifications.&nbsp; The assessment of a job applicant will also take into account his or her own ability and aptitude, not just academic qualifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for admission to postgraduate degree programmes, the local universities will consider all applicants who meet the eligibility criteria, regardless of where their qualifications were obtained.&nbsp; NUS, NTU and SMU do not rule out degrees from any <I>bona fide</I> foreign universities.&nbsp; The universities will undertake a holistic assessment of the applicants' aptitude and suitability for postgraduate studies.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1882<p>They consider applicants' transcripts, recommendation letters, personal statements of academic and career objectives, standardised test scores such as GRE and GMAT, and work experience, where relevant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the issue of strengthening Singapore as an education hub.&nbsp; I would like to thank Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Dr Ong Seh Hong, Dr Amy Khor, Dr Lily Neo and Mr Teo Ser Luck for their comments and suggestions on the regulation of private schools.&nbsp; I agree with the general thrust of their views and I will address their well motivated questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first set the context.&nbsp; The private education landscape in Singapore has evolved rapidly over the years.&nbsp; The number of private schools registered with MOE has grown exponentially.&nbsp; It doubled in the&nbsp;10 years between 1987 and 1997, from 150 to 305.&nbsp; It then quadrupled in the next&nbsp;10 years between 1997 and 2007, from 305 to 1,200 private schools.&nbsp; The number of full-time foreign students enrolled in private schools also grew four-fold, from 9,000 in 1997 to 37,000 last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such rapid growth in numbers, it is inevitable that the private schools' standards differ considerably.&nbsp; The problem of students affected by lower standard schools has also grown more acute.&nbsp; In the last two years, a number of private schools have closed down, leaving many students, mainly foreign students, stranded.&nbsp; This has tarnished the Singapore Education brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the significant evolution of the landscape, we need to adapt our approach to meet the changing circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, Singapore has forged a reputation for excellence in its public education system.&nbsp; Students from all over the world are attracted to Singapore on <p align=left>Column: 1883<p>the strength of our mainstream schools and world-class tertiary institutions.&nbsp; To strengthen Singapore's position as a global education hub, the private education industry should further develop to compete on quality, rather than faster time or ease of obtaining a degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE announced during the last COS that we would study the issue and explore ways to enhance regulation of the sector.&nbsp; After considering various options, we have decided on a three-pronged approach to enhance regulation and improve standards over time.&nbsp; Firstly, MOE will set up an agency that brings together the right expertise so as to provide greater focus on the industry and effectively implement the regulatory framework.&nbsp; Secondly, to ensure basic threshold quality standards in private schools, we will strengthen the existing registration framework and enhance its enforcement.&nbsp; Thirdly, we will introduce a quality certification scheme to allow better private schools to differentiate themselves, as well as to enable students to make informed choices.&nbsp; I will address each of these measures in turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, MOE has considered if it is best placed to perform the regulatory function for the private education sector.&nbsp; After all, MOE's core focus and expertise still lies in the mainstream school system and the publicly-funded education sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private education industry is a highly diverse one.&nbsp; Private schools offer a wide range of programmes at all levels, in myriad subjects and for various purposes, including enrichment, full-time study and continuing education.&nbsp; The regulatory body should have the right expertise so that it can effectively address the regulatory needs of a wide spectrum of operators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After careful consideration, MOE has decided to establish an independent <p align=left>Column: 1884<p>Council for Private Education to oversee the regulatory framework for the private education sector.&nbsp; The Council will also promote best practices in the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council will be chaired by Mr Lin Cheng Ton, who was the former Principal and CEO of Nanyang Polytechnic.&nbsp; Mr Lin needs no introduction among Singapore educationists and business leaders.&nbsp; Under his visionary leadership, Nanyang Polytechnic was the first educational institution to attain quality awards, such as ISO 14001, Singapore Quality Class, and Singapore Innovation Class.&nbsp; Mr Lin was the architect of a distinctive pedagogical model that has been emulated widely in regional tertiary institutions, including China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council members will be drawn from highly-regarded individuals with expertise in education, quality assurance and business.&nbsp; Government agencies involved in developing Singapore as an education hub, including the Economic Development Board and Singapore Tourism Board, will be also represented.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consumer Association of Singapore or CASE will also be represented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE will remain responsible for setting policies for the private education sector, but it will empower the Council, with its specialised expertise, to decide on all applications for registration and quality certification.&nbsp; The Council will also direct investigative and enforcement actions to be taken against errant private schools, where appropriate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we will enhance the registration framework.&nbsp; Under the existing Education Act, private schools are required to obtain one-off registration with MOE before they are allowed to operate. Going forward, MOE intends to impose a validity period for registration by the Council and make it renewable, subject to certain requirements.&nbsp; This regular renewal process rather than a one-off registration <p align=left>Column: 1885<p>will encourage private schools to consistently maintain their standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">2.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also strengthen our capability in enforcement of the registration requirements. Currently, a private school can only be de-registered and only under extreme circumstances. To better deal with schools that violate the conditions of registration, MOE will introduce graduated penalties, including fines, for errant private education providers. This will allow the Council to impose penalties that are in proportion to the severity of the offences. It will serve as useful deterrence against poor standards or behaviours, while giving errant schools opportunities to rectify their violations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third component of the enhanced regulatory framework is a quality certification scheme called EduTrust to incentivise private schools to raise their standards and to enable students to distinguish the better quality players.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EduTrust will build on the improvements in standards that have been achieved through CASE&rsquo;s CaseTrust for Education scheme. CaseTrust for Education focuses mainly on protection of fees paid by students. EduTrust will introduce new requirements over and above those required under CaseTrust, including minimum standards of academic processes. After EduTrust is implemented, CASE will cease to offer CaseTrust for Education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under EduTrust, private schools will be required to satisfy certain academic, financial and student welfare requirements. Examples of academic requirements include having qualified academic supervisors and teachers, as well as well-defined structures for programme development, assessment, progression and performance review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1886<p> EduTrust-certified private schools will also have to demonstrate their financial capacity. Private schools that are unable to demonstrate adequate financial capacity will be required to make precautionary arrangements for their students to transfer to equivalent courses in other schools, at no extra cost to the students. These arrangements will only be effected in the event of the school&rsquo;s closure to ensure that students can continue their studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of student welfare, EduTrust-certified private schools must protect students&rsquo; fees by depositing fees into an escrow account or purchasing student insurance. They will also be required to have&nbsp;clear fee and refund policies, effective complaint resolution procedures and adequate student counselling and support services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Industry players can choose whether or when to be certified, according to their own assessment of readiness and their choice of business model. However, as with the existing CaseTrust, EduTrust will be mandatory for private schools that wish to enrol foreign students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That said, it is important to understand that risk cannot be completely eliminated. It can only be mitigated. Neither enhanced registration nor EduTrust can guarantee total student satisfaction, completely avert school closures or prevent regulatory infringements. What we can do is to reduce the likelihood of closures and violations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The introduction of EduTrust will allow private school operators to differentiate themselves and enable students to choose better-quality schools, which in turn will provide some protection against adverse developments. By stepping up enforcement, private school operators will be more mindful of their statutory obligations and take positive steps to constantly improve themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1887<p> However, I must stress that ultimately, students themselves must exercise care in making a decision to study in a private school. They must find out more about the institutions and the courses they intend to pursue, understand the risks involved, especially when choosing the less established schools, and take the necessary precautions to protect their interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To establish the Council for Private Education and to enhance the registration system as I have outlined, new legislation will have to be introduced. MOE will be drafting a new Private Education Bill for this purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill will establish the independent Council for Private Education and empower it with effective regulatory and enforcement powers. The Council will be the approving authority for registration of private education operators and will administer the EduTrust certification scheme to incentivise private schools to improve their quality. To support the Council in carrying out its role, MOE will increase our capacity to inspect, monitor and investigate private schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Bill will enhance and clearly spell out private schools&rsquo; statutory&nbsp;requirements to meet baseline standards required for registration. It will make registration renewable, clearly stipulate what constitutes offences, and provide for graduated penalties for different offences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE aims to introduce the Private Education Bill in Parliament by the end of this year. The EduTrust scheme will be launched by the Council for Private Education in early 2009. We will consult the public and industry stakeholders before finalising the Bill and the implementation details of EduTrust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1888<p> To assist private schools to transit smoothly to the enhanced regulatory framework, MOE will allow for a transition period and work closely with industry associations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to sum up, the enhancements to the regulatory framework will better protect the interest of students. In consultation sessions with private school operators, we also found that students are not the only ones who welcome tighter regulation. Genuine and serious private school operators, too, collectively incur reputational damage whenever there are negative incidents that tarnish the Singapore Education brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The approach of tightening the mandatory registration system, stepping up enforcement and introducing quality certification is a balanced approach that will seek to ensure a baseline of quality in the industry while preserving a marketplace that allows for student choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the next few years, MOE and the Council will focus on the effective implementation of the enhanced regulatory framework, ensuring baseline standards across the board and incentivising private schools to improve their standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To succeed in developing Singapore into a Global Education Hub, a strong regulatory framework alone is not sufficient. We need the support and collective ownership of all stakeholders, including the private education operators as well as the students. Private schools must realise the need to constantly upgrade themselves to meet the increasingly competitive international landscape and the rising expectations of students. Students themselves must be more discerning and selective in deciding on their educational pathways. They should carefully assess the choices available and be especially cautious about organisations promising degrees in short <p align=left>Column: 1889<p>duration, with minimal admission requirements and less rigorous coursework. Only when we work together, can we keep the learning experience in Singapore an attractive and&nbsp;enriching one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

My concern is that the pursuit of excellence may be driving some schools to implement the CCA in a manner that&nbsp;may have detrimental effects on the mental health of their students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while I was attracted to the word \"holistic development\", associated with CCA, two other words seem to take the CCA centre stage - \"auditions\" and \"trials\".&nbsp; In some schools, students have to go to audition to determine if they have a particular talent to be in that CCA, eg, the choir, the dance, or the drama groups.&nbsp; Similarly, they have to go to trials&nbsp;for sports CCA.&nbsp; In a school that I know, Secondary 1 students were told that unless they have represented their primary schools in a national competition, they would not even be considered for that sport as a CCA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what does this suggest?&nbsp; Elitism?&nbsp; Pursuit of excellence?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In yesterday's <I>Straits Times</I>, a Ms Lee Shu Sian wrote about how her former secondary school decided to scrap gymnastic which is her CCA, because the sport is not winning enough awards and glory for the school.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, not every child has a talent to sing, dance, act or play tennis or swim for the school, but the child may be interested in one of these activities,&nbsp;and through it&nbsp;learn more about himself and be motivated enough to try his best.&nbsp; Yet, he may not even get a chance to pursue his interest.&nbsp; What happens to such a child?&nbsp; Going from one room to another to audition only to be told that he is not good enough.&nbsp; What happens to his&nbsp;total and holistic development if he is made to feel that he is not good for anything?&nbsp; At least, we hope that he is good in his studies.&nbsp; What if he is not good in that either?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1891<p> To what extent does the Ministry monitor such practices in schools and whether the guidelines given to the schools can be further reviewed to ensure that the schools' pursuit of excellence does not lead to elitism, leaving behind students who do not fit?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is always impressive to see buntings and banners outside schools displaying their accolades - their SYF gold award, and better still, the SYF gold with honours awards.&nbsp; But what about the ugly ducklings?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has MOE assessed the psychological and emotional effect of such practices on these children?&nbsp; Has MOE communicated&nbsp;closely the implementation of CCA system and its outcomes?&nbsp; Is there a relationship between CCA involvement or non-involvement and attrition rates?&nbsp; How is CCA&nbsp;component of total development of the child measured&nbsp;in school with its&nbsp;over-emphasis on&nbsp;CCA excellence and awards?&nbsp;&nbsp;Has MOE assessed the effects on the child's esteem and self-worth, even for those who managed to be in the CCA but not selected for the A-team?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope MOE will not compromise holistic development in the schools' pursuit for excellence in CCA.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

PM Lee had announced in 2006 that MOE would be studying how to further reduce the attrition rate in schools.&nbsp; Since then, we have put in place several initiatives and schools have developed ways to reduce the number of dropouts, the attrition rate is now&nbsp;1.6%. While our dropout rate remains very small compared to many other countries, we want to do everything we can to get as many students as possible to attain at least 10 years of education, so that they can subsequently get a post-secondary education.&nbsp; This would help equip them with useful skills and knowledge, and prepare them well for the workforce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work and oversight of the Committee to Reduce Attrition (CRA) and the effort and programmes put in by our schools will continue to be important not only to reduce dropout rates and maintain the low dropout rates in our schools, but also to address those with some form of <p align=left>Column: 1894<p>risk of dropping out which students can develop at any point of their time in school.&nbsp; The small attrition rate in fact belies the tremendous effort and comprehensive systems put in place by the schools and community to keep it in check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, around 0.15% of the cohort drops out during primary school.&nbsp; For this group of students, we have implemented the Learning Support Programme, which we enhanced recently and had improved outcomes, to help Primary 1 and 2 students who are not school-ready by providing them with dedicated assistance. The introduction of compulsory education for primary school since 2003 has further reduced the number of children not attending school or dropping out over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another 0.45% drops out during the transition from primary to secondary school.&nbsp; To address this group, we have established NorthLight School in 2007 to provide them with a customised vocational curriculum that focuses on their socio-emotional needs and character development.&nbsp; Last year, for students who have been posted to a secondary school after their PSLE but did not report to the secondary school subsequently, we have also put the onus on&nbsp; their former primary schools to contact them and counsel them to enrol in a secondary school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest improvement in attrition rate comes from those who drop out during secondary school.&nbsp; This is 1% of the cohort currently, compared to 1.6%&nbsp;a year ago.&nbsp; This drop is largely due to the many initiatives undertaken by the schools themselves following PM Lee's announcement on the formation of the CRA.&nbsp; About 70% of the dropouts leave school at the upper secondary level, namely, Secondary 3.&nbsp; In addition, about 90% of the secondary dropouts are from the Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) streams.&nbsp; We will continue to <p align=left>Column: 1895<p>focus more efforts and resources on this group of students to help them stay in school.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do students drop out from the school?&nbsp; They drop out due&nbsp;to many different factors, not just financial difficulties.&nbsp; Some have family problems, while others may find difficulties coping with their studies, are more keen to work than study, or lack the motivation to learn, especially after mixing with bad company.&nbsp; There are also students who experience a combination of these factors.&nbsp; Consequently, they become disengaged from what is happening in school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address these factors, MOE has implemented various initiatives over the years to strengthen students' engagement through programmes such as Education and Career Guidance and CCAs.&nbsp; Education and Career Guidance allows students to determine their educational and occupational pathways based on their interests, abilities and aspirations.&nbsp; When students have clear goals to work towards, they become more motivated in their studies.&nbsp; Likewise, CCAs provide opportunities for students to develop interests and bonds with peers outside of academic pursuits, and help to keep them engaged in school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have implemented a revised Normal (Technical) curriculum with a more practical orientation, to better engage our students in their learning.&nbsp; Three schools, namely, Bedok Town Secondary, Si Ling Secondary and Shuqun Secondary have begun piloting new approaches to the N(T) programme by introducing new subjects and pedagogies developed in partnership with ITE.&nbsp; The introduction of Elective Modules and Advanced Elective Modules has also created greater engagement and enjoyment in learning for students due to the more practical hands-<p align=left>Column: 1896<p>on approaches. We have also enhanced the Student Re-admission Policy in 2006 by putting in place a responsive process to facilitate the re-admission of school dropouts.&nbsp; As a result, the percentage of students who have successfully applied for re-admission has increased from 65% in 2005 to 85% last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now talk about the time-out programmes schools have initiated to provide enhanced guidance and support for students with disciplinary, behavioural and academic problems.&nbsp; These programmes provide them with a time-out from their normal school environment and routine so that they can sort out their thoughts, redirect themselves and prepare to get back on track with their learning again.&nbsp;Twelve such time-out programmes involving 44 schools were initiated last year, and with much success.&nbsp; For example, of the 17 Secondary 3 Normal (Technical) students who participated in Chong Boon Secondary's time-out programme last year, 16 of them are still attending school regularly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such programme was the Centre for Supervised Learning (CSL). This programme helps students with behavioural problems from Bukit Merah Secondary School, Outram Secondary School, Gan Eng Seng School and St. Theresa's Convent embrace positive learning attitudes, so as to ensure sustained learning when they reintegrate into the classroom.&nbsp; During the four-week programme, students were taught social and emotional competencies and character development besides study skills for core subjects.&nbsp; Chee Wei Rong from Outram Secondary School was one of the students who participated in the programme in July 2007.&nbsp; Before that, he had been absent from school for more than a year, due to a lack of motivation for learning.&nbsp; Through the customised programmes and close interaction with teachers, Wei Rong became aware of the need for a proper formal education to <p align=left>Column: 1897<p>achieve his career goals.&nbsp; At the end of the programme, Wei Rong returned to school, topped his Secondary 2 class and was promoted to Secondary 3.&nbsp; He is now a good role model for other students in his class.&nbsp; We will continue to support schools in these programmes by providing specialists to offer advice on programme and evaluation design, and toolkits to study their impact on students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let me describe to you the further steps we are taking to reduce attrition.&nbsp; Although our dropout rate is very low, maintaining it at this level and improving it further will require more work over time, given that our students continue to be exposed to different influences and distractions outside school.&nbsp; Building on our existing efforts, MOE will adopt the following three measures to further reduce attrition, especially among students in the high-risk groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will provide additional resources for schools. The small rate of attrition also implies that the students who actually drop out are at high risk of dropping out and are not addressable with more of the same thing.&nbsp; In fact, most need to be individually case managed.&nbsp; As of January this year, we have assigned Full-Time School Counsellors to all schools to identify potentially at-risk students, design programmes and provide counselling support for them.&nbsp; These FTSCs have been very effective in engaging students who are at risk of dropping out of school.&nbsp; Over the next few years, MOE will be providing a second FTSC and an additional Operations Manager to 70 schools with higher proportions of at-risk students.&nbsp; The Operations Manager will follow up with the students at-risk to ensure that they are participating in all aspects of school life and are meaningfully engaged in school programmes like CCAs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will support earlier intervention through identifying and <p align=left>Column: 1898<p>monitoring at-risk students. Currently, often work done for a child at risk, even when documented, does not get passed on properly for continuous monitoring and subsequent intervention as the child moves up from class to class.&nbsp; This is important because not all problems can be resolved quickly or within an academic year.&nbsp; This systemic problem is exacerbated when the child moves from school to school.&nbsp; We will be developing tools to identify students with literacy, behavioural or social communication difficulties early, so that we can provide timely support to them and plan the best pathway for intervention.&nbsp; We will also be developing data management tools to provide useful information on individual students for teachers to facilitate the monitoring of their development even as they move from school to school and from class to class. These tools can help teachers design appropriate learning structures and processes to improve their quality of learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we will strengthen further our partnerships with other Ministries, non-Government&nbsp;institutions and self-help groups to provide comprehensive and holistic support for these students.&nbsp; For a start, we are consolidating programmes currently offered by self-help groups, and will be disseminating them to all schools so that they can tap on these programmes where appropriate. We recognise the self-help groups have been providing intervention and prevention programmes for a long time. With their experience and access, MOE will work together with them in areas where our synergy will make their effort more effective and contribute to reducing attrition in schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On character building, Dr Lily Neo, Dr Ong Seh Hong and Ms Lee Bee Wah have asked for an update on what MOE has done to improve the character building and moral values of our students. It is not only important for our society but for the students themselves.&nbsp; I agree with them <p align=left>Column: 1899<p>that the school is not only about academic learning but is also not solely responsible to develop character in our students.&nbsp; However, having said that,&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has always regarded character development as one of our key areas of focus in the education system.&nbsp; We have developed many platforms in the formal and non-formal curriculum.&nbsp; One of these platforms is Civics and Moral Education, or CME, where students are taught to live by certain core values in order to guide them to make appropriate choices, and determine their behaviour and attitudes towards themselves and to&nbsp;others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from CME, there are other programmes and activities in the non-formal curriculum, such as National Education, Community Involvement Programme and Co-Curricular Activities that provide students with&nbsp; opportunities to practise making value-based choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also introduced the Character Development Award in 2006.&nbsp; This award recognises and motivates schools' efforts in character development, and provides a structured framework to guide schools in their character development efforts. Over the last two years, 139 schools have attained the CDA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On CCAs,&nbsp;Dr Maliki has concerns regarding the effect of CCA trials and auditions on students. Schools plan their CCA programmes taking into consideration their students' interests, available resources and niches. While students prefer the CCAs they would like to participate in, there may be inadequate resources to meet the students' choices.&nbsp; This problem exists in all instances when demand exceeds supply or when supply cannot or should not be expanded for good reason.&nbsp; There are however complementary alternatives.&nbsp; Besides the formal CCAs which have a 30-week programme, schools have adopted other <p align=left>Column: 1900<p>innovative ways to engage their pupils in their activities of interest, such as inter-house activities and modular&nbsp;CCAs.&nbsp; MOE has&nbsp;been working with the Singapore Sports Council since last year to provide all schools with a dollar-for-dollar Sports Education Programme&nbsp;of up to $10,000 per school.&nbsp; Using this fund, schools can run sport programmes for students, such as sports clinics, instructional courses and even modules where students learn skills in organising, teaching and refereeing sports and games.&nbsp; To date, more than 140,000 students from 311 schools have benefited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While getting the preferred choice of CCA may be a problem, just like getting the preferred choice for schools, we should recognise that CCAs remain a great engagement framework to keep students in school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCAs help to expose students to different experiences, and encourage them to explore and cultivate diverse interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chua Mui Fan from Mayflower Secondary is an excellent example.&nbsp; As a quiet and introverted girl, Mui Fan entered the Normal (Technical) stream with an aggregate score of 98.&nbsp; After taking up sailing as a CCA, she gradually built up her confidence and perseverance through the sport.&nbsp; With her strong leadership skills, she became the captain of the sailing team, and led her team to clinch second place at the 2004 National Inter-Schools Sailing Championships.&nbsp; Mui Fan subsequently became the top NT student in her school and progressed on to ITE to take Multimedia Technology.&nbsp; She is now in Temasek Polytechnic doing a course in Mechatronics. She attributes much of her success in studies to the skills she had acquired in her various CCAs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite Dr Maliki's concern, our surveys show that our students are indeed satisfied with the learning experiences provided in CCAs,</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

This is relevant to address families who are at risk of pulling their children out of school because of financial issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General education is almost fully subsidised by the Government.&nbsp; For students in Government and Government-aided schools, parents are required to pay a token amount of the fees to instill in them the sense they must be responsible for the education of their children.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when this token amount is not affordable, parents can apply for the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS).&nbsp; The income criteria&nbsp;were raised in 2006 from $900 to $1,500 for families with one or two children, and from $1,050 to $1,800 for families with three or more children to target the low-wage families.&nbsp; As a result, the number of recipients increased by almost three times from 15,000 in 2005 to 44,200 in 2007.&nbsp; But we will continue to review the FAS so that the income criteria keep pace with the changing income profile of the population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current income criteria for the MOE FAS provide a higher income limit of $1,800 for families with three or more children, in recognition that larger households would need a higher level of income to pay for their expenses.&nbsp; Of course, for families that do not qualify somehow or at the margins, the schools would provide their own financial assistance&nbsp;or help them to&nbsp;obtain assistance from other community organisations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like also to&nbsp;thank Dr Lily Neo for her suggestion for MOE to coordinate <p align=left>Column: 1902<p>with MCYS to provide a comprehensive assistance scheme. &nbsp;We will continue to work closely with MCYS to develop programmes that provide the necessary support and guidance to students from disadvantaged backgrounds.&nbsp; For example, students from families on MCYS' Public Assistance Scheme will automatically qualify for MOE's Financial Assistance Scheme and receive a 100% subsidy for&nbsp;examination fees.&nbsp; However, we should not go too far in making all forms of financial assistance automatic, as this could create an entitlement mindset amongst some parents.&nbsp; We want parents to stay engaged and play an active role in their children's education, rather than passively waiting for handouts to be given to them automatically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, reducing attrition&nbsp;and, thus, ensuring our students finish at least 10 years of school with an opportunity to pursue some form of post-secondary education or skills training is one of many ways we can level up society.&nbsp; Every child we keep in school is one child less in the street and one child less for the underworld to prey on.&nbsp; Every child from a dysfunctional family with adequate schooling and subsequently a good job will be two less dysfunctional families in the future.&nbsp; These students are not the easiest to help nor inspire. &nbsp;I acknowledge and thank the schools, teachers and community leaders who have put in a lot of effort, time and thought in addressing this issue.&nbsp; These are the areas where results come slowly and sometimes packaged together with heart-breaks and setbacks.&nbsp; But&nbsp;for every starfish somehow abandoned on the shore that we put back to sea, the \"<I>Wei Rongs</I> and <I>Mui Fans</I>\", it is a starfish we saved, worthy for itself and for society.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chan Soo Sen (Joo Chiat)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It sounds very cool.&nbsp; To shop until I drop makes me a hero of a consumer society.&nbsp; But what if I drop and I cannot get up again?&nbsp; I become a martyr of the consumer society.&nbsp; While we want to have heroes, we must avoid having martyrs to spend and spend and spend until one drops.&nbsp; From being cool, it will become cold.&nbsp; And if this value becomes a national value over time, when more and more of our young people get used to the concept or&nbsp;idea of spending until they drop, then it can eat into our usual good habit of having&nbsp;prudent Budgets and building up our national reserves, and our country's future will go from being cool to&nbsp;cold.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, do not get me wrong.&nbsp; I am not against spending.&nbsp; I am not trying to pitch a value of \"miser-y\".&nbsp; I am just appealing to the Ministry of Education to do something concrete to explicitly inculcate a value of thrift.&nbsp; For me, thrift does not mean not spending.&nbsp; Thrift does not mean not giving.&nbsp; To me, thrift means spending in a sustainable way, spending for value-add, as well as building up a reserve for emergency and old age, because all of us want to live long.&nbsp; All of us&nbsp;want to&nbsp;continue to spend, and all of us also want to retire early.&nbsp; Sometimes, the three do not add up.&nbsp; It is only through prudence and the inculcation of the value of thrift that we can do all three together through to our good old age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, of the three basic principles that I have mentioned, ie, to spend in a responsible way, to spend for value-add, as well as to build up the reserve for emergency, allow me to just emphasise on the words \"spend for value-add\".&nbsp; It is spending that adds value to the society and self.&nbsp; We <p align=left>Column: 1904<p>spend on upgrading ourselves for self-improvement.&nbsp; Since the Minister of State had earlier mentioned that private and&nbsp;continuing&nbsp;education is going to be more strongly regulated, this will give us better value for money.&nbsp; Also, give to the worthy causes&nbsp;that help the less fortunate in society, that help to promote social cohesion in the process of helping the less fortunate, and give generously to the patronage of arts.&nbsp; These may be habits of spending, but these are spending for value-add.&nbsp; It is important for us to distinguish between the amount of spending as well as the value we get back, not only dollars and cents, but also values in the case of heartware.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could I ask the Minister to outline whether the Ministry has any&nbsp;plans to explicitly reinforce and inculcate the value of thrift?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Er Edwin Khew Teck Fook (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew:</B> Sir,&nbsp;let me first start with the issue of integration of students.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree fully with Mr Hri Kumar that this is really something&nbsp;very important -&nbsp;bringing together students of different races.&nbsp; We have structured programmes in Social Studies, Civics and Moral Education, platforms like Learning Journeys, and Racial Harmony Day.&nbsp; I just want to assure him that we are always on the look out for new, different and especially better ways to bring across the learning points to our students.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our view is that structured programmes must&nbsp;be supported by&nbsp;everyday opportunities for meaningful interactions.&nbsp; When&nbsp;children&nbsp;work and play together, they share common goals and aspirations.&nbsp; They&nbsp;gradually come to know and appreciate one another deeply.&nbsp; Our view is that CCAs provide the most natural platform for this to take place, as they stand shoulder to shoulder and train side by side. Students come together because of common interests and these activities allow students to spend long hours together through intensive and fulfilling interactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give a couple of examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several of our schools&nbsp;- including Hwa Chong Institution, a Special Assistance Plan (SAP) school, Greenridge Secondary, Telok Kurau Secondary, West Spring Secondary and Zhenghua Secondary&nbsp;- jointly organise a Harmony Cup Soccer Competition.&nbsp; The students compete in teams with members from different schools and ethnic groups.&nbsp; This is an excellent way to develop real friendships beyond their usual circle of friends through sporting endeavour and achieve<p align=left>Column: 1907<p>ment.&nbsp; At Xinmin Secondary School, for example, many non-Chinese students take part in the Chinese Opera.&nbsp; At&nbsp;Raffles Girls' School, many non-Malay students take part in the Angklung Orchestra and in Malay Dance.&nbsp; Such activities that bring together students of different races are increasingly common across our schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With time and opportunities for such interactions, I think these children can form deep friendships.&nbsp; Based on our latest National Education survey, we found that around 90% of students are comfortable with having friends from different racial and religious backgrounds.&nbsp; And this is encouraging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chan Soo Sen talked about the importance of thrift.&nbsp;This is an important value, not only for children but also for adults.&nbsp; Often, we are tempted to buy things we do not need, with money we do not have. Through Civics and Moral Education, students are taught the basis for thrift, to safeguard the future for themselves and loved ones through proper management of finances.&nbsp; They&nbsp;learn the importance of appreciating what they have, living within their means and exercising responsible decision-making in financial matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Social Studies, our students have the opportunity to pick up practical financial management skills.&nbsp; They are taught how&nbsp;to save money and to invest wisely.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have&nbsp;also worked with external organisations to deliver the MoneySENSE programme to schools.&nbsp; Primary schools, in particular,&nbsp;have access to a performance on financial literacy education called \"SAVING&nbsp;- the Sensible Habit\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schools will continue with efforts to help our children acquire the awareness and the skills to make the right choices in this regard.&nbsp; But as he has so succinctly <p align=left>Column: 1908<p>pointed out, these efforts to inculcate the right values of thrift and hard work must ultimately be reinforced and supported by parents and the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Edwin Khew asked about efforts to educate our students on the environment.&nbsp; We agree it&nbsp;is an important issue with wide-reaching and long-lasting consequences.&nbsp; Let me share briefly what we are doing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the formal curriculum, in Social Studies and Civics and Moral Education, we&nbsp;promote care for the environment and responsible behaviour.&nbsp; Subjects like Geography and Science teach our students about climate change, pollution, resource depletion, environmental management and sustainable development. Through the informal curriculum, many students participate in waste minimisation and nature conservation through the Community Involvement Programme.&nbsp; Schools also have&nbsp;Environmental Clubs where students undertake projects such as recycling and activities like the Clean and Green Week and Earth Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resources are provided to the schools to carry out these activities as well as special projects and, if necessary, they can tap on additional funds in MOE.&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Environment Agency also provides funding to schools to run their Environmental Clubs and to conduct environmental programmes and activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUS and NTU already provide scholarships for various engineering courses, including those that are relevant to future careers in environment-related industries.&nbsp; In addition, the National Research Foundation provides the Clean Energy Scholarships, which aim to develop technology and industry leaders in the Clean Energy industry in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Fatimah Lateef asked about the extension of the FutureSchools@Singapore programme.&nbsp; Today, we have <p align=left>Column: 1909<p>selected six schools as&nbsp;the pioneer batch of FutureSchools, including the recently announced School of Science and Technology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with IDA's 2015 Vision for Education and Learning,&nbsp;we plan to develop up to 15 FutureSchools by 2015.&nbsp; We will start the selection of the second phase in 2009, with a view to implementation in 2010.&nbsp; We have adopted a phased approach so as to apply the lessons learned in the earlier phases and to ensure that the technologies that are applied will always be up to date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On top of funding that MOE provides to all schools, each FutureSchool will receive a project grant from the National Research Foundation (NRF), IDA and industry partners over&nbsp;four years.&nbsp; The NRF will contribute about one-third of the project grant while IDA and industry will contribute two-thirds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful models that are developed&nbsp;in these FutureSchools will be cascaded to the rest of the schools, so that the benefits of the programme will eventually be extended to all schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just add and echo the words of the Minister that our schools are doing good work across a range of different areas, not only in the academics.&nbsp; The schools are going out of their way to nurture different types of talent to their full potential to provide our students with strong fundamentals to inculcate enduring values and to help them develop habits which define character, and character which determines the man and woman that they will grow to become in the years ahead.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman:</B>&nbsp; Mr Chiam See Tong is not here.&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>CL Teaching and Learning</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to<p align=left>Column: 1910<p>&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20080304/20080304VS_092456.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a></I>*.] The Chinese education reform has been carried out for a number of years. I would like to ask the Ministry how effective is the reform and whether the Minister can provide us with an update.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore Chinese Teachers&rsquo; Union informed me that MOE&rsquo;s Curriculum Planning and Development Division has played a supporting role by implementing a variety of efforts such as training which includes teaching philosophy, teaching method, action research and also teaching methods in Chinese reading and video recording techniques, etc. However, we would like to propose that MOE come up with some plans to establish a systematic way of training our teachers, for instance, to develop a method that is similar to the curriculum appraisal process, so that we can have measurable objectives to facilitate evaluation or to promote alternative evaluation methods, so as to provide support for our &ldquo;Teach Less, Learn More&rdquo; initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We are happy to note that the MOE&rsquo;s Curriculum Planning and Development Division has stepped up teaching research last year. With support from the Chinese department and master teachers, they have achieved preliminary results and organised a nation-wide sharing session on knowledge exchange. This year, they have continued to make persistent efforts to broaden the scope of teaching research, including teaching foreign students, to study differentiated teaching strategies and learn how to create a professional profile for teachers, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With strong support from MOE and schools, the TLLM Ignite! initiative has received good response from primary schools and the organiser has selected six proposals for research and funding. These schools will enjoy a plethora of MOE&rsquo;s support, including education training for the school&rsquo;s research activist, guidance and support from MOE&rsquo;s master teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1911<p>We hope that MOE will work with the school management to garner their support for education reform, as the distribution of teachers&rsquo; resources is very important. The allocation of additional teachers for the schools is a timely help from MOE and, as such, the schools should allow teachers to be fully involved in teaching Chinese and not other subjects. So we must make full use of these additional resources provided by MOE to strengthen the effectiveness of teaching the Chinese language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is a multi-lingual society and we face a complex learning environment. Our bilingual education policy has been implemented for many years and we have accumulated vast experiences in teaching, appraisal and teaching materials. Our experiences are different from China. We should develop our competitive advantage and share our experiences with other educators around the world. From what I understand, some schools in the US have already adopted our preschool Chinese curriculum. In this regard, I hope that MOE will continue to promote research in teaching, curriculum development and training of teachers, etc, so as to contribute towards the learning of the Chinese language around the world.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols.2039-2040.<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tanjong Pagar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Learning Dialects as Third Languages</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tanjong Pagar)</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>): [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20080304/20080304VS_111611.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a></I>*.] Singapore is a multi-racial society.&nbsp; I suggest that MOE&nbsp;compile a new set of teaching materials in order to enhance the interest of knowledge and understanding among all the races.&nbsp; Just to give&nbsp;an example, like the Chinese saying, &ldquo;The same rice feeds a hundred types of people&rdquo;. For example, our Malay <I>nasi lemak</I>, Indian <I>nasi bryani</I> and Chinese <I>yang chow</I> fried rice,&nbsp;all these are a dazzling array of food culture.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1912<p> Through our dialects, we can also learn about the Chinese culture.

The CL Review recommended a flexible curriculum to enthuse learners of different backgrounds and abilities as well as help them achieve their fullest potential in CL.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE developed and piloted the new Primary CL curriculum at Primary 1 and Primary 2 levels in 2006, and at Primary 3 level last year.&nbsp; The surveys conducted during pilot implementation yielded encouraging results. They indicated that the new curriculum, with its modular approach and active-learning pedagogy, <p align=left>Column: 1913<p>provided students with greater flexibility to meet their diverse CL learning needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modular curriculum is now being implemented in all schools at P1 to P4 levels. This will be followed by P5 next year and P6 in 2010. Structured training was provided to CL teachers to ensure that they can implement the new curriculum well. In addition, a 70-strong team, comprising Master Teachers, curriculum planning officers and teachers from the pilot schools provided curriculum support to the non-pilot schools. Resources such as teaching guides, assessment guidelines and digital resources were also provided. To implement the modular CL curriculum, all primary schools were given one more CL teacher last year. A second additional CL teacher will be given to primary schools by June this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE announced recently that a learning roadmap for all Mother Tongue Language (MTL) teachers would be drawn up to guide them in their professional development. We will provide more development opportunities for our MTL teachers. These include courses on action research, pedagogy and assessment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, MOE has also set up the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning to garner community support for promoting the use of CL beyond schools. The committee comprises Members of Parliament, educators, publishers and representatives from CL Community Organisations and professional bodies. Mr Yeo is a member of this committee. Over the past years, the Committee has actively facilitated reading programmes, events targeted at pre-school children and other initiatives to promote the use of CL beyond schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also suggested that Singapore can develop into a CL hub.&nbsp; I, too, believe that Singapore has the potential to become a centre of excellence for the <p align=left>Column: 1914<p>teaching and learning of CL.&nbsp; In particular, our unique bilingual environment offers conducive conditions and gives Singapore a competitive advantage in teaching and learning CL as a second language.&nbsp; We will explore ways to leverage on the strong foundation we have built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English)</I>:<I>&nbsp;</I> Mr Baey Yam Keng suggested introducing a new syllabus module on Singapore's multi-cultural aspects.&nbsp; MOE consciously exposes our students to Singapore's multi-cultural heritage through subjects such as Mother Tongue Languages as well as Civics and Moral Education.&nbsp; For example, in the Chinese Language curriculum, students are exposed not only to Chinese but also Malay and Indian traditions and customs.&nbsp; Through Civics and Moral Education, students gain insights on harmonious living in a multi-racial society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Baey will also be glad to know that some of our schools also provide activities that are related to ethnic culture.&nbsp; Poi Ching Primary School, for example, has&nbsp;Teochew opera classes for&nbsp;its students, and Chung Cheng High School offers <I>Nanying,</I> a special&nbsp;musical instrument of Chinese ethnic origin.&nbsp;&nbsp; Students also get to explore and experience various cultures at first-hand, including ethnic cuisines, through learning journeys to Chinatown, Malay Village and Little India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These curriculum and school activities help strengthen students' awareness and appreciation of Singapore's vibrant cultural diversity.&nbsp; Learning about each other's cultures helps connect students of different backgrounds and nurture their respect for each other's traditions and beliefs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Denise Phua also spoke about children with special needs earlier.&nbsp; MOE shares&nbsp;her vision of helping special needs children to realise their potential to the fullest.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1915<p> Ms Phua suggested a shared services model for SPED schools.&nbsp; I agree that this is a useful approach in optimising resources and enhancing professionalism.&nbsp; MOE will study this further.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Phua also asked if MOE could send good officers for attachment in SPED schools.&nbsp; I am glad to inform her that MOE officers may request for secondment to SPED schools, and that such requests are usually supported.&nbsp; Last year, there were 30 MOE officers on secondment to special education schools, including three principals.&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE officers may also seek to be attached to&nbsp;special education schools under the work attachment&nbsp;programme for a shorter period, and 10 officers have done so last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also developing a Quality Assurance Framework for special education schools, and we will take Ms Phua's feedback into account.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to reaffirm that MOE and NCSS are committed to continually improve support for education for children with special needs.</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It is crucial to the laying of foundation for a child's education.&nbsp; Many countries see it as investment for the future.&nbsp; I am glad that, in Singapore, we are no different.&nbsp; About 97% of children here receive pre-school education.&nbsp; The Education Ministry has, over the last few years, put in concerted efforts to improve the quality and the participation rate in pre-school education.&nbsp; This is especially true among students from low-income families attending pre-school.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we should continue to strive to improve on the quality of pre-school.&nbsp; We <p align=left>Column: 1916<p>should ensure that not only each and every child attend pre-school but also our pre-school education is of high standard.&nbsp; This requires more resources from the Government.&nbsp; Currently, the subvention given to eligible pre-school centre is dependent on the number of trained pre-school teachers each centre has.&nbsp; This system, although it has helped to raise the quality of eligible pre-school education centres, does not take into consideration the number of students each centre has.&nbsp; It is also in deference to the students' families' socio-economic status.&nbsp; I urge the Education Ministry to relook this issue and work out a more equitable system of allocating subsidies for&nbsp;pre-school education centres, and favour those with more children from lower-income families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, MOE should still set standards for centres to be eligible for MOE's subsidies.&nbsp; The criteria should include minimum educational requirement of the teachers, the teacher-student ratio and the classroom resources required, etc.&nbsp; Once eligible, the centre should then be subsidised based on the number of pupils,&nbsp;&nbsp;and with higher funding given to those pupils from lower-income families.&nbsp; As a result, the centre with more children from lower-income families could then maintain charging a lower fee while maintaining a high standard of pre-school education.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Josephine Teo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Josephine Teo:</B> Sir, like several parliamentary colleagues, I had also spoken during last year's COS to call on the Ministry of Education to improve the consistency of quality among pre-school providers in Singapore.&nbsp; I had argued that the current standards for kindergartens, which the MOE had put in place, was insufficient.&nbsp; This was because many parents do not know that the standards exist.&nbsp; Even if the standards are good enough, and even if they did, it is not realistic to expect parents to be able to assess pre-school providers according to the standards.&nbsp; Parents would welcome a quicker and simpler way to help them <p align=left>Column: 1917<p>assess the quality of pre-school education providers.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had argued also that the MOE was best placed to provide the quality assurance as it had the people with the relevant knowledge, expertise and credibility.&nbsp; If MOE is concerned that having a quality assurance programme would drive providers out of business, why not make it voluntary?&nbsp; This will also give parents a choice to decide if they are willing to pay more for a provider&nbsp;that makes the effort to meet the standards of a quality assurance programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the MOE if it could give an update on the possibility of a quality assurance programme being put in place.&nbsp; And if yes, when could parents expect its introduction?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to a quality assurance programme, I would also like to suggest that the MOE consider ways to improve further the teacher quality among pre-schools in Singapore.&nbsp; Last year, as part of an effort to gain insights into the expectations of parents, a small task force was formed by the PAP Community Foundation Executive Committee.&nbsp; The task force conducted a survey involving some 1,600 parents of kindergarten and childcare students.&nbsp; Among other things, the survey showed that parents ranked staff quality as the second most important consideration after distance for choosing a pre-school provider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the importance that parents place on staff quality, I would like to ask the MOE what plans it has to further improve the quality of teachers in our pre-schools.&nbsp; I urge the MOE to move decisively on consistency and quality of pre-school education.&nbsp; The reason is that the children soon grow up.&nbsp; There is not a day more that we can afford to lose to give them the best possible headstart in life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1918<p> My third area of concern was also brought up last year.&nbsp; In terms of affordability, pre-school education costs a lot more than primary or even secondary school education.&nbsp; At PCF kindergartens where fees are amongst the most affordable, the monthly cost of around $100 is still more than 15 times that of fess at most primary schools.&nbsp; I understand that improving quality will require further investments, and this could put further pressure on the fees to be adjusted upwards.&nbsp; May I ask the MOE what plans it has to improve affordability and, at the same time, enhance the consistency and quality of pre-school education?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Thanks to the enthusiastic parents who start&nbsp;them from as young as two-and-a-half years old in all kinds of play school and early learning programmes.&nbsp; I understand that a number of these schools even charge fees higher than the undergraduate programmes in NUS.&nbsp; But middle and upper class parents&nbsp;generally spare no expense to give their children a headstart.&nbsp; Because this is so widespread, it might even have caused the primary school curriculum to be consciously or otherwise level up to cater to the higher level of preparedness of the cohort entering Primary 1.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, we have a segment of children in each cohort, about 5% or less, who do not attend pre-school at all.&nbsp; These children have difficulty&nbsp;keeping pace with the syllabus once they enter primary school.&nbsp; What these children need is a right start to their educational journey.&nbsp; I urge the Ministry to consider deploying a team of social workers to identify such children and counsel their families, show them ways to resolve their problems and motivate them to send their children to pre-school.&nbsp; To&nbsp;nip the problem of future <p align=left>Column: 1919<p>low education, low skills and low income workers in the bud, we must tackle this problem aggressively and thoroughly and early enough.&nbsp; Half-hearted efforts relying on untrained volunteers, while their efforts are certainly deserving of praise and appreciation, will be simply insufficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other issue is that of uneven standards of our kindergartens.&nbsp; Last year, the Ministry informed this House that almost 90% of our kindergartens have adopted the kindergarten curriculum formulated by the Ministry.&nbsp; Would the Minister give us an update on how many more kindergartens have adopted this framework?&nbsp; In addition, how does the Ministry ensure that our kindergartens maintain the standards set by the framework?&nbsp; Do we have a reliable evaluation method and consistent audit?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the importance of pre-school as foundational learning for all children, the MOE should ensure that the quality of pre-school education, their teachers, curriculum and resources conform to some minimum standards.&nbsp; I am thankful that the Government has set minimum requirements for the qualifications of pre-school principals and teachers to ensure that they are trained for the job.&nbsp; The Ministry informed us last year that 82% of pre-school teachers are now certificate or diploma trained, and 70% principals diploma trained.&nbsp; Has this ratio improved?&nbsp; Are there any plans to ensure that all teachers and principals have the relevant qualification?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I applaud the changes that the Ministry has made in our education system over the years.&nbsp; The most recent ones are&nbsp;very exciting -&nbsp; the&nbsp;focus has shifted to quality and diversity, with the goal&nbsp;being to develop the potential of every child to the maximum, such that we attain many peaks of excellence.&nbsp; More choices are being introduced for students so that they can develop their strength and interest in sports, the arts, and many other intellectual endeavours.&nbsp; At the&nbsp;highest level, the Government is considering&nbsp;establishing a fourth&nbsp;university.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I believe that education does not and should not begin only&nbsp;at Primary One.&nbsp; It is during the first six years of a child's life that they develop most of their neuro pathways. It is during this period <p align=left>Column: 1921<p>that the child is most eager to learn, and&nbsp;most open to stimulation.&nbsp; It is during this period that children develop the ability to take part in their own learning.&nbsp; If a child receives good quality education in pre-school and is given the correct environment to develop his or her path in primary, secondary and tertiary education, it will be much&nbsp;more fruitful and enriching.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the profound impact that a child's pre-school education can have on the growth and development of that child, I ask whether&nbsp;it is not incumbent on us to ensure that pre-school education that we provide to our children should&nbsp;be as good, if not better than the primary, secondary and tertiary education that we offer our children today.&nbsp; If we are to maximise and harness the potential of every single child, why not&nbsp;seize&nbsp;the opportunity to nurture them during the most crucial years of development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At last year's Committee of Supply debate, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary&nbsp;(Education), Mr Masagos Zulkifli said that the Government has set minimum requirements for the qualifications of pre-school principals and teachers and has also formulated the kindergarten curriculum framework which almost 90% of kindergartens have adopted.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp;15th of February sitting&nbsp;this year,&nbsp;Mr Masagos&nbsp;added a few more areas to the list of support which&nbsp;the Ministry gives to pre-school education, including promoting&nbsp;kindergarten's self-appraisal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I echo the views on quality assurance stated by Mrs Josephine Teo and Dr Amy Khor.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask what steps does the Ministry intend to take to improve the quality of pre-school education and ensure that those levels of quality&nbsp;are either maintained or further improved.&nbsp;Why does the Ministry not impose a compulsory and&nbsp;stringent appraisal system for pre-schools rather than the present self-appraisal <p align=left>Column: 1922<p>system?&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has said, we hold our schools accountable to the highest standards, why not our pre-schools?&nbsp; Will the Government consider introducing an accreditation programme for pre-schools much like the EduTrust for private schools?&nbsp; If so, will it be a one-off accreditation or one that is reviewed on a periodic basis, and will it be compulsory?&nbsp; If not, why not?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from requiring pre-school teachers to meet minimum standards in English, what other measures are being introduced, and what has the kindergarten curriculum framework introduced -&nbsp;was it revised?&nbsp;

Kindergarten education should be made more affordable.&nbsp; Give more grants to approved pre-school institutions, hence, allowing the fees to be lowered.&nbsp; The average cost for a kindergarten teacher is about $2,500, with the teacher/student ratio in K1 and K2 of 1:25, and 1:15 for nursery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staff cost is staggering for the kindergartens.&nbsp; The cost of kindergarten fee for two children in a family income of $2,000 would be a hefty 10%,&nbsp;ie,&nbsp;$200 a month, and this fee is only among the lowest.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been found that around 5% of Singaporean children, aged five and six, do not attend kindergarten.&nbsp;

While this diversity allows for experimentation and <p align=left>Column: 1925<p>innovation by pre-school operators in the design of curriculum and delivery of programmes, we want to ensure that they continue to provide pre-school education of a good quality.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International research indicates that pre-school education is particularly helpful in allowing children from low-income families to be more school ready.&nbsp; In addition, our research shows it&nbsp;offers children from non-English speaking&nbsp;homes an opportunity to develop their proficiency in English through exposure and practice. Hence, we want to make sure that these children have greater access to&nbsp;good quality&nbsp;pre-school education, so that they can obtain a firm foundation when they enter primary school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,&nbsp;we recognise that pre-school education is not just about getting our children to be school ready, but also about providing a holistic approach to their development and learning. &nbsp;Besides developing their skills in language, literacy and numeracy, we also want to ensure that they undergo other critical areas of learning, such as aesthetic and creative expression, environmental awareness, motor skills development, and self and social awareness.&nbsp; This is so that they can become well-rounded individuals who are equipped with the necessary competencies to prepare them for lifelong learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the educational profile of parents has shifted over time.&nbsp; Parents have become more well-educated and better read, and have begun to demand as much emphasis on the rigour of the educational component of&nbsp;pre-school as they had for aspects of care, even in the heartlands.&nbsp; While less than one-fifth of P1 students had at least one parent who attended post-secondary education&nbsp;20 years ago, this ratio has now increased to one-half today. &nbsp;It is hence necessary to ensure that the quality of our pre-school teachers allows them to engage parents effectively <p align=left>Column: 1926<p>and the standard of the pre-school centres keeps pace with&nbsp;evolving demands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before detailing the list of initiatives that MOE will undertake to raise the quality of the pre-school sector, allow me to report the progress of those we had already announced and executed previously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, I announced the project pilot called the Focused Language Assistance in Reading programme or FLAiR.&nbsp; This initiative aims to provide targeted assistance in English to children from lower-income families, as many of them tend to lack reading materials, writing experiences, and opportunities for speaking and listening to the English Language at home. The children receive daily attention from para-educational professionals or Pro-FLAiRs who spend dedicated time reading or conversing with them either on a one-to-one basis or in a&nbsp;group of four to six children. The pilot in 2007 covered 57 heartland kindergartens,&nbsp;600 children&nbsp;participated, and they&nbsp;were able to develop early reading skills as a result of the programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;We now want to extend&nbsp;this to more kindergartens, and we will&nbsp;be encouraging more kindergartens&nbsp;this year to provide this programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Hong, Mrs Josephine Teo, Dr Amy Khor, Mr Michael Palmer and Mdm Cynthia Phua have asked about improving the quality of pre-school education.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been implementing various initiatives over the years to uplift the quality of pre-school education through the better training of teachers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we have articulated standards of professional qualifications for all major providers of pre-school education to meet.&nbsp; As of January&nbsp;this year, we have about&nbsp;90% of&nbsp;teachers employed in kindergartens and childcare centres, who have attended or are&nbsp;undergoing training to acquire <p align=left>Column: 1927<p>certificates or diplomas in pre-school education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, to ensure acceptable standards in pre-school teacher training, MOE and MCYS have jointly set up the Pre-School Qualification Accreditation Committee (or PQAC) in 2001 to accredit pre-school training courses up to Diploma level.&nbsp; As at December 2007, the PQAC has accredited 70 PQAC courses run by 21&nbsp;training agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, to allow our pre-school teachers to attain a basic level of English proficiency, we mounted the English Communication Skills (or ECS) Course in November last year to develop teachers&rsquo; accuracy, facility and fluency in the appropriate use of Standard English in various situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, 315 kindergarten teachers have attended or are attending the course.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has developed a pre-school curriculum framework in 2003 to guide pre-school operators in developing programmes that meet the needs of their children, and conducted in-service workshops and briefings to more than 7,000 teachers on its effective use.&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, more than 90% of kindergartens have adopted the principles of the curriculum framework in the design of their pre-school programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our continual efforts, the quality of our pre-school sector has steadily improved over the years.&nbsp; Building on what we have been doing over the past few years, we are now ready to take the next step to further uplift this quality across the board by improving the quality of our teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE had previously set the minimum academic and professional qualifications of pre-school teachers in 2001.&nbsp; As a result, all pre-school teachers were <p align=left>Column: 1928<p>required to have three &lsquo;O&rsquo; level passes, including a pass in English, and the certificate-level professional qualification.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At that time, the emphasis was on making sure that teachers received adequate professional training that would enable them to deliver their lessons effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, there has been a shift in educational philosophy.&nbsp; In the past, teachers were seen as bearers of knowledge and expected to teach skills and content to children as passive learners.&nbsp; Now, children are viewed as active learners who construct knowledge for themselves, and the role of the teacher has transformed to one of helping them to construct their own learning in a seamless, integrated and holistic way.&nbsp; With this increased complexity, it is now timely to improve the basic calibre of our teachers so that they can continue to have the capacity to engage children through more sophisticated pedagogies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we will require that from January 2009, all new teachers will need to have&nbsp;five 'O' level passes, including a pass in English, and hold a diploma-level professional qualification in order to teach in either kindergartens or childcare centres.&nbsp; This is attainable, given that there is a ready pool of candidates with&nbsp;five 'O' level passes which has grown from more than 70% of the 'O' level cohort in 1997 to 80% in 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we want our incumbent pre-school teachers to attain a basic level of English proficiency, so that they will be able to help our children, particularly those from non-English speaking families, to acquire the foundational language skills needed to be school ready.&nbsp; Hence, incumbent teachers who already have a diploma-level professional qualification do not need to meet the new requirement of&nbsp;five 'O' level passes, but they will need an 'O' level pass in English, or a pass in an <p align=left>Column: 1929<p>English proficiency test, to teach K1 and K2 classes.&nbsp; If incumbent teachers are unable to obtain either a pass in English or a diploma-level professional qualification by January 2013, they can still teach at the nursery level. &nbsp;To further uplift the standards of English proficiency, we will also require new teachers with C5 or C6 in English to pass an English proficiency test within two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;in order to help boost the overall quality of our teachers over time, we will require each pre-school centre to have at least 75% of all its teachers,&nbsp; including K1/K2 and pre-nursery/nursery teachers together, to meet&nbsp;the new requirements by January 2013.&nbsp; These teachers who&nbsp;comprise&nbsp;75% will include new teachers with at least five 'O' level credits, including English Language (EL) and a diploma-level professional qualification, and, secondly,&nbsp;incumbent teachers with an 'O' level credit in EL, or a pass in an EL proficiency test, and the diploma-level professional qualification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, already more than half&nbsp;of our incumbent teachers meet the revised requirements.&nbsp; A centre can retain incumbent teachers who do not meet these requirements as long as they teach at the nursery or pre-nursery levels, but these teachers should comprise less than 25% of all teachers in the centre in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage teachers and principals to continuously upgrade their academic qualifications and professional expertise, MOE and MCYS will be offering bursaries to pre-school professionals from this year onwards. This will enable them to enhance their competencies so that they can provide better&nbsp;pre-school education for the children under their charge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we will also further tighten standards of accredited pre-school teacher training courses to enhance the rigour of teacher training.&nbsp; The revisions are expected to be completed some time <p align=left>Column: 1930<p>around mid-2008 and the enhanced standards will take effect from 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also work with professional bodies to present awards to outstanding and innovative teachers. These awards will help to identify and build up a pool of capable pre-school teachers to serve as role models and mentors to fellow teachers.&nbsp; Funding will be provided for these teachers to attend mentoring courses and they will also be involved in sharing good teaching practices.&nbsp; In this way, we hope that they can help develop a positive sharing culture throughout the pre-school sector, and uplift the overall quality of teachers in the sector in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides raising the minimum qualifications of pre-school teachers, we are of the firm belief that the quality of the pre-school sector will improve&nbsp; across the board if operators are provided with resources to help them monitor their performance and upgrade themselves.&nbsp; As mentioned by Members, to nurture&nbsp;this climate of continual self-improvement, MOE developed and distributed a tool, called Pursuing Excellence at Kindergartens, or PEAK for short, to encourage kindergartens to conduct yearly self-appraisals and think of more effective ways of delivering educational outcomes, and this was introduced&nbsp;in 2003.&nbsp; As of December last year, 90% of kindergartens have practised self-appraisals in their kindergartens and found the tool to be helpful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Josephine Teo and&nbsp;Mr Michael Palmer also asked about quality assurance.&nbsp; To encourage pre-school operators to further uplift their standards and strive for greater excellence in pre-school education, MOE and MCYS will develop a voluntary quality assurance and accreditation framework and implement it from January 2011 to guide pre-schools in gauging their progress in achieving a <p align=left>Column: 1931<p>higher standard beyond the minimum requirements.&nbsp; Through this framework, pre-school operators will be able to benchmark their education outcomes through yearly self-appraisal and external assessment.&nbsp; Pre-school operators that meet specified standards may then apply for accreditation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although participation is not compulsory, attaining a good quality rating or accreditation status is an endorsement and recognition of the quality of the pre-school. &nbsp;We believe that this will incentivise pre-school operators to improve their standards over time, uplifting the quality of the pre-school sector in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support pre-schools in their efforts, MOE will provide them with additional curriculum resources to help teachers implement the curriculum framework.&nbsp; MOE has embarked on a project to develop a Curriculum Planning Guide which aims to guide teachers to translate MOE's curriculum framework into quality learning and teacher-pupil interactions.&nbsp; The Planning Guide will also provide suggestions for pre-schools to plan, monitor and reflect on experiences and instruction that will enable children to make progress in their learning and development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also recognise that a well-resourced classroom can provide a stimulating environment for learning. With effect from 2008, non-profit pre-schools can apply for grants to purchase teaching and learning resources such as books, computers and software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To nurture a spirit of innovation and experimentation among pre-schools, MOE and MCYS will also introduce an innovation fund this year.&nbsp; This aims to provide seed funding to encourage pre-school operators to try out new ideas and experiment on areas that will have an impact on the quality of teaching and <p align=left>Column: 1932<p>learning, pupil development and school management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also be exploring the development of an early childhood education training and research programme within NIE, so as to build up a strong local community of expertise in early childhood education,&nbsp;leadership and research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we develop ways to improve the quality of pre-school and allocate resources for it, we want as many children as possible to benefit from it. We thank Mdm Cynthia Phua for her question on improving the accessibility of pre-school education.&nbsp; To provide access to those who are currently not attending pre-school, MOE, MCYS and grassroots organisations have put in place an outreach programme since last year to identify five-year-old children who are not attending pre-school.&nbsp; Yes, they may be volunteers from the grassroots organisations, but their job is not just to conduct visits to families with children who do not attend&nbsp;pre-school,&nbsp;but to also provide them help and, if necessary, refer them to social service agencies. &nbsp;The percentage of our five-year-old children who are not attending pre-school is now about 3%.&nbsp; MOE and MCYS will continue to work closely with the community to support grassroots organisations in their outreach efforts this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has also worked with primary schools since 2006 to identify six-year-old children who are not attending pre-school somehow at the point of the Primary&nbsp;1 registration exercise, and help them place their children in pre-school for the remaining months prior to the start of Primary 1.&nbsp; We have also supported the Self-Help Groups in their Bridging Programme to equip needy children who did not attend pre-school with basic school readiness skills.&nbsp; We will continue to adopt this targeted approach to reach out to these children, as we believe that <p align=left>Column: 1933<p>this would be more effective in getting them to attend pre-school than introducing compulsory education at this point of time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On ensuring affordability of pre-school education,&nbsp;currently, MOE provides annual recurrent grants to help eligible kindergartens&nbsp;who cater largely to lower-income families with additional resources to improve their quality, while maintaining affordability of fees.&nbsp; MOE has provided $17 million in 2007 for this purpose.&nbsp; To ensure that pre-school education continues to remain affordable with the raised teacher qualifications, MOE will be enhancing the recurrent grants for these kindergartens.&nbsp; We will give details later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents can continue to make use of the Baby Bonus and the monies in their Child Development Account to pay for any increase in pre-school fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, for the needy,&nbsp;a variety of financial assistance schemes have&nbsp;already been put in place to help children from lower-income families, such as the Kindergarten Financial Assistance Scheme (KiFAS) and the Centre-Based Financial Assistance Scheme for Childcare (CFAC).&nbsp; MCYS will be announcing enhancements to both schemes to help more families to pay for their pre-school fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who need further help, community-based support is also available through the grassroots organisations, self-help groups and PCF kindergartens, to supplement the Government subsidies. For example, CDAC and MENDAKI provide additional financial assistance under the Pre-School Assistance and Support Scheme (PASS) and Education Trust Fund (ETF) initiatives respectively.&nbsp; Advisors and grassroots leaders can also tap on the Citizens' Consultative Committees' Welfare and Education Fund and ComCare Fund to assist their residents who need financial support to send their children to pre-school who may <p align=left>Column: 1934<p>not qualify for the assistance somehow.&nbsp; The Government will continue to review the affordability of pre-school education, to make sure that no child will be denied a place in pre-school because of financial difficulties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE will be spending a total of $30.5 million in 2009 for all the initiatives to uplift the quality of the pre-school sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Zainudin Nordin spoke on the need to enhance the remuneration and professional image of our pre-school teachers.&nbsp; While matters pertaining to remuneration are directed by pre-school providers and essentially market driven, more importantly, MOE and MCYS recognise that the most direct way to enhance the professional image of our pre-school teachers is to improve the calibre and training of our pre-school workforce.&nbsp; This is why we have raised the minimum academic and professional qualifications for pre-school teachers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association of Early Childhood Educators, Singapore, or AECES, promotes the professional development of early childhood educators and has disseminated a Code of Ethics to all pre-schools.&nbsp; MOE and MCYS will encourage AECES to play a more active role in improving the image of the early childhood professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help kindergartens identify training needs and prioritise areas for the professional development of their staff, MOE has developed and disseminated a Professional Development Framework. We also organise in-service training, workshops for pre-school educators to improve their pedagogical, leadership and management skills.&nbsp; Teachers and principals are invited to share their experiences and good practices in areas such as curriculum planning, teaching strategies, assessment, partnerships with parents and community, and action research at sharing sessions and briefings for kindergarten leaders.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1935<p>Overseas experts on Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) have also been invited by MOE and MCYS to conduct seminars so as to further build a professional pre-school workforce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion,&nbsp;the Ministry will continue to review our efforts to uplift the quality of pre-school education, so as to ensure that all children, without losing sight of those from low-income families, will be ready for school and prepared for life.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> Sir, the results have been positive.&nbsp; We now have a few years to look at this.&nbsp; In fact, we have studied it quite carefully across schools as well as looking at specific schools to see what real outcomes have come about as a result of smaller class sizes in Primary 1 and Primary 2.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1938<p> The small class size <I>per se</I> has not been a decisive factor.&nbsp; What has really mattered is how teachers have made use of a small class size, and we do see some variations across schools.&nbsp; The schools in which the teachers have made the most use of a smaller class size to change learning methodologies - a lot more group work, a lot more chances for the students to question, a lot more interaction back and forth between teacher&nbsp;and students - are the ones that have seen the most measurable outcomes coming out of smaller class size.&nbsp; So, smaller class sizes have facilitated something that is more important, and that is really the interaction of teacher and students.&nbsp; What types of benefits?&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot put a score to this but, on the whole, the teachers and&nbsp;parents have concluded that the students are now more interested in their learning, more outspoken and willing to stand up in class to&nbsp;question and express their views.&nbsp; And the weaker students especially, together with what we are doing on the learning support programme, are&nbsp;now a lot more engaged in their learning.&nbsp; They are able to catch up with the rest of the class and are progressing better in Primary 3 and&nbsp;4.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should we extend it beyond Primary 1 and 2?&nbsp; I do not think we should go for the same model of mandating a fixed class size across schools.&nbsp; What we are doing is improving our pupil-teacher ratios - fewer pupils for each teacher - by providing more teachers to every school and then letting the school decide, because the schools are different, classes are different.&nbsp; Students differ in their abilities and learning styles and it is really for the principal, the Heads of Departments and the teachers to decide how best to deploy these additional teachers.&nbsp; Some principals might feel that their average classes are doing fine just as they are.&nbsp; But there might be a group of students with an exceptional talent who need a little more pushing on a smaller group basis, and a group of students who <p align=left>Column: 1939<p>are weaker who need more attention and supervision even after school hours to help them come up and catch up with the rest.&nbsp; So, these are school-based decisions.&nbsp; It is best that we flow more teachers to the schools and let them decide how best to allocate them, rather than mandate this across the board.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

For the fourth university, my question for MOS Lui is: with the&nbsp;increase to 30% in the number of students targeted from the current 25%, how would&nbsp;he ensure that the standard of a university education is not eroded?&nbsp; I have read from some news reports last year that, in Taiwan, because they have so many universities, some of the students, even if they fail English,&nbsp;could still get into university.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew:</B> Sir, let me take the questions one at a time.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the number of students who are in debt when they leave university as a result of tuition fee loans and study loans, I do not have the data with me.&nbsp; What we do know is that, when we work out the figures,&nbsp;if they take the maximum amount that is required to pay for fees as well as living expenses, because it is interest-free for the duration when they are in university and if they take the maximum duration of 20 years thereafter to pay for <p align=left>Column: 1940<p>the loan that they have taken, it would be 10% of their starting salary when they first graduate.&nbsp; Obviously, over time, as the salary increases, they can&nbsp;pay back faster and it becomes a slightly smaller percentage.&nbsp; So we monitor this quite carefully to make sure that, for those students who really require a full loan - whether because they do not qualify for bursaries or&nbsp;do not want to depend on their parents - that, yes, they go and&nbsp;take a loan but it is an affordable rate of payment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the fourth university, the Member is absolutely right in the sense that we must do so carefully to make sure that we keep standards high, because the impact is not just for the students from the fourth university.&nbsp; If we erode the quality of the university sector in Singapore, I think all the graduates will suffer to one extent or another.&nbsp; We have seen examples in other countries, eg,&nbsp;in the United Kingdom,&nbsp;and Taiwan, as&nbsp;mentioned by the Member.&nbsp; But they have expanded the university sector very quickly.&nbsp; They have converted polytechnics into universities, all trying to raise significantly the participation rate in a degree education, and it really has impacted the graduates coming out from the universities because they find it difficult to get employment.&nbsp; They would have been better off going for a polytechnic education, which is very hands-on, very applied, with the right skills, coming out into industry and manufacturing.&nbsp; In that sense, they have eroded that aspect of their education without gaining the benefits that a university education ought to give to an undergraduate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we have to be mindful of that.&nbsp; We are doing so gradually, raising from 20% to 25% over the past decade up to 2010, and then doing so from 25% to 30% by 2015.&nbsp; And we are confident that we can do so for a few reasons.&nbsp; One is that the economy is strong.&nbsp; There is a demand for graduates.&nbsp; Two is that, if you&nbsp;look at the <p align=left>Column: 1941<p>improvements we have made to the primary, secondary and post-secondary education, whether it is JC or polytechnics, I think our students are well equipped to benefit from a university education.&nbsp; And so, by progressing gradually, carefully and&nbsp;judiciously, we will make sure that our universities produce graduates who will be very employable and contribute back both economically as well as socially.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We have found the students responding well to the curriculum that has been put together for them.&nbsp; We have also been very encouraged <p align=left>Column: 1942<p>by one additional aspect, ie, how the community has come in to support the school and the students.&nbsp;

I think&nbsp;the Member may be referring to the possible displacement and so forth.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to look also at the positive outcome of the policy.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, we believe that it will make the pre-school industry a very attractive industry for newcomers to come into.&nbsp; The Diploma courses in Ngee Ann Poly, for example, will be much more&nbsp;sought after because the industry will have a better name, better quality and better pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, for incumbent teachers, we have ascertained that about&nbsp;50% in the kindergarten sector and&nbsp;60% in the childcare sector have already got the minimum requirements to stay in the industry.&nbsp; However, the other&nbsp;50%&nbsp;and 40% respectively for this industry have time to upgrade themselves and also to attain the necessary qualification.&nbsp; So it is up to the individuals to ensure that they get the right qualifications to teach our children at pre-school level.&nbsp; I think I have to underscore the importance of the competency that we need for pre-school teachers to impart a more sophisticated pedagogy for our students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give an illustration.&nbsp; I was in Hong Kong once and watched this pre-school teacher supervising a child drawing a big painting on a very big piece of paper.&nbsp; From an untrained observer like <p align=left>Column: 1943<p>myself, I thought this child was doing a painting but he was actually drawing a still art of a flower.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I asked the supervisor, the teacher said: \"No. We are not teaching him to paint, we are training his gross motor skill\".&nbsp; That is quite different.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that is from an untrained teacher's perspective,&nbsp;if we do not train them well, it means&nbsp;they do not have the right qualification.&nbsp; These teachers&nbsp;who&nbsp;do it will carry out the routine without understanding how they are developing our child.&nbsp; What we want is a more sophisticated, well trained teacher who knows how to best develop our child to the right pitching of the qualification when they come in, and the training that we can give them.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It is something we have been <p align=left>Column: 1945<p>looking at.&nbsp; We notice that there is a group of students who go through the learning support programme at Primary One and&nbsp;Primary Two and do not graduate or they may just barely make it after the end of those two years.&nbsp; We have taken a very&nbsp;thorough look at this group of students several months ago.&nbsp; We&nbsp;looked at a whole cohort and&nbsp;at each student individually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is in any population, a group of students who will be of lower intellectual ability.&nbsp; This is true anywhere you go.&nbsp; There is also in any population, a group of students who might be of average or even above average intellectual ability but who have a specific learning disability,&nbsp;be it&nbsp;dyslexia or some other form of learning disability, and we find that for this group that fails to make it through Primary Six, it is&nbsp; principally the first group, those who are very weak in intellectual ability.&nbsp; They might have some&nbsp;other strengths, they might have some artistic flair, they might be good at some aspect of the languages but weak in mathematics.&nbsp; They have some strengths typically which we can try to draw on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a group that we are now looking at carefully to see how we can further support them in Primary Three and Primary Four.&nbsp; Not through a formalised learning support programme, not through a new stream as such, but see how we can help them keep pace with the class, at least on the basics.&nbsp; Keep them well occupied and help them find some strengths in themselves.&nbsp; We are also addressing the needs of that group which has a specific learning disability although they may be of&nbsp;average or above average intelligence.&nbsp; Particularly for Dyslexic kids, there is more that can be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We are now working a tight referral system between the Ministry and schools and the Dyslexic Association of Singapore to see how we can intervene earlier to <p align=left>Column: 1946<p>help these children while they are in Primary One or&nbsp;Primary Two.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we often find that&nbsp;amongst these very weak students, they have both problems.&nbsp; They have both specific learning disabilities plus weak&nbsp;intellectual ability.&nbsp; We can help them remedy some of their problems with Dyslexia but we will still have to make do&nbsp;and help them find and discover themselves and be able to go through primary school feeling that they are not being cast away.&nbsp; Go through Northlight, some of them might make it into the Normal (Technical) stream, the main stream, pick up some skills, and move on to ITE.&nbsp; We think more can be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let me say again that basically for bullying, this is something that MOE takes very seriously.&nbsp; Our teachers are trained to handle it, to meet with the child, to investigate the incidents,&nbsp;to provide counselling, to provide support and&nbsp;to provide remedial corrective measures, as necessary.&nbsp; That is the short answer, because&nbsp;we had quite a long discussion on this a few&nbsp;sittings ago.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the role of principals, we have actually moved to a situation where we have principals staying seven years in a particular school, compared to the past which may be four-five years.&nbsp; I think this allows them a sufficient amount of time to basically invest themselves in the school, bring their philosophy to bear, and to see through some of the changes as well as the results.&nbsp; But&nbsp;as a norm, it is not good for them to be in a school for too long, because we want new ideas, we want freshness coming in.&nbsp; So we really have to strike a balance, and we think that the norm of seven years now is probably about the right balance.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Those who may not qualify for the three <p align=left>Column: 1952<p>universities&nbsp;and the fourth university now have an additional option.&nbsp; Instead of only looking to private institutions or institutions overseas, they are now able to work and yet at the same time avail themselves of the opportunity to do a part-time degree at UniSim, NUS or NTU, because SMU currently does not offer this.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew:</B> Sir, firstly, about why we were not in favour of the idea of converting a polytechnic to become a university.&nbsp; There are several reasons, not the least of which really is the capacity constraint.&nbsp; We have five polytechnics all well subscribed.&nbsp; It is a mode of education that has become increasingly popular over the years, not least because our polytechnics offer a very high quality of education.&nbsp; So to convert a polytechnic to become a university, I think it means that we actually have to build yet another polytechnic.&nbsp; That is number one.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number two is that I think where there are niche areas, we encourage our polytechnics to work with a foreign institution to provide upgrading opportunities for specific areas.&nbsp; We have three programmes today for the polytechnics to tie up with the foreign special institutions (FSIs).&nbsp; One is in early childhood,&nbsp;second is in naval architecture and&nbsp;the third one, which was announced recently, is in retail marketing.&nbsp; These are the very limited areas for a very small number of students.&nbsp; That is really the approach that we have been taking&nbsp;for polytechnic and foreign special institutions tie-up.&nbsp; We plan to <p align=left>Column: 1954<p>grow this to make more programmes available, tie-ups with more quality institutions from abroad so that there will be more opportunities for the polytechnic graduates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On top of that, I think the fourth university actually provides us the opportunity to do something different, and I have talked about it.&nbsp; I just want to come back to the point that the fourth university will cater to a combination of students from the 'A' levels as well as from the polytechnics.&nbsp; But in increasing the percentage of students from each cohort going into university to 30%, what it means&nbsp;is&nbsp;that we can have&nbsp;proportionately more polytechnic students than is the case today to have the opportunity to get a degree education here in Singapore in one of our four institutions, if I include the fourth university.&nbsp; Today, it is less than one in six.&nbsp; In time to come, it will be better than one in five.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The favourable job market condition boosted by a booming economic growth in 2007 saw more Singaporeans getting jobs.&nbsp; A recent report from MOM showed that Singaporeans have&nbsp;benefited from the job boom with more taking up PMET jobs and less of them taking up lower-paid jobs.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister for data on the types of jobs foreigners hold and the breakdown of the associated statistics.&nbsp; Could the Minister also provide a comparison of salaries for Singapore workers and foreigners&nbsp;at the different levels?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While more Singaporeans are getting employment, more new jobs appear to be taken up by foreigners, ie, six out of 10 jobs in 2006.&nbsp; MOM has said that this is due to insufficient number of Singaporean workers available for the vacancies.&nbsp; Sir, I feel that it is our responsibility to maximise the chances for Singaporeans to benefit from new jobs, especially promising new sectors.&nbsp; What plans does MOM have to train and retrain Singaporeans such that high value jobs and new job opportunities in new industries favour Singaporeans than foreigners?&nbsp; One thing MOM and WDA can do is to increase efforts in identifying sectors with high job demand and subsequently advise local workers in the <p align=left>Column: 1956<p>areas they need to consider to undertake reskilling efforts.&nbsp; This is specially relevant to workers above 40 who continue to struggle in getting appropriate jobs in spite of the rosy job market, as portrayed by Radha Basu in today's <I>Straits Times.</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Sir, employers in some sectors, such as manufacturing, construction and cleaning, continue to say that we need to employ more foreign workers on grounds that there are not enough Singaporeans to work in these sectors.&nbsp; This may not be the case for all employers as those in other sectors may not face the same image issue with Singaporean workers.&nbsp; For these employers, I would like to suggest that they be made to prove to demonstrate that they have put in sufficient effort to recruit Singaporeans before they are given additional quota to recruit foreigners.&nbsp; At the same time, I believe more needs to be done to build resilience in Singaporean workers.&nbsp; Even with job redesign, there are still Singaporeans who shun such jobs</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

For the whole year of 2007, overall unemployment rate averaged 2.1%, down significantly from 2.7% in 2006 and 3.1% in 2005.&nbsp; The strong economy led to another record breaking year for employment creation in 2007.&nbsp; Total employment creation in the whole of 2007 was 236,600, fast surpassing&nbsp;176,000 in 2006.&nbsp; This is a very healthy growth.&nbsp; Both locals and foreigners benefited from the strong job creation.&nbsp; Local employment grew by 92,100 in 2007 and this is&nbsp;the third successive year of increase. &nbsp;Foreign employment also rose to a new high of 144,500 in 2007.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these are all impressive figures.&nbsp; Yet, there are Singaporeans who have not <p align=left>Column: 1960<p>benefited from the boom.&nbsp; We have seen them in our meet-the-people sessions.&nbsp; Their tales and woes are strikingly similar.&nbsp; Some say they are finding it hard to find a job because of their age.&nbsp; What is of concern is that they are only in their 40s. &nbsp;Some have ailments which restrict the kind of work they can do, and some are single parents with children or sick parents to attend to and are unable to juggle their family and work responsibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I appreciate that the Ministry cannot solve all these problems.&nbsp; But I have some difficulty understanding why some residents who are fit have difficulty of changing jobs, be it through the CDC or other Government job matching agency or have to wait some time to find work.&nbsp; Yet, at the same time, we see foreigners doing jobs which we Singaporeans can do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is another group of Singaporeans which need assistance, and these are so-called employed Singaporeans but who are very lowly paid.&nbsp;

This situation, Sir, was confirmed by a contact of mine who is in the business of sourcing for foreign workers.&nbsp; And among the positions&nbsp;he has been asked to fill&nbsp;are dishwashers, paying about $1,200 a month, retail service staff which pays between $1,200-$1,500 a month and even Class 4 drivers, paying between $1,400-$1,800 a month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister therefore whether our job matching systems are comprehensive enough to know what jobs are available in the market so that we can&nbsp;swiftly and effectively match Singaporeans who need work or who need a better paying job.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Foreign Workers</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Josephine Teo:</B> Sir, under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act which the Indian Parliament passed in 2005, anyone who wants will be given 100 days of manual labour in the countryside for a minimum day wage of 60 rupees.&nbsp; We do not have such a policy in Singapore.&nbsp; Though Singapore has very low unemployment and high employment rates,&nbsp;there are&nbsp;Singaporeans who still have difficulty getting jobs and keeping their jobs, especially the older and low wage workers?&nbsp; Therefore, one is sometimes tempted to ask&nbsp;whether Singapore should also have a minimum wage or job guaranteed programme.&nbsp; In thinking about this question, I found an interesting observation about the Indian job guaranteed programme in a book written by Edward Luce, the <I>Financial Times</I> Bureau Chief in Washington DC who was based in Delhi from 2001 and 2005.&nbsp; Here is what he said about the kind of work that is guaranteed:\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"The work is almost entirely physical consisting of the type of manual labour&nbsp;India's poor has been requisitioned to do for thousands of years, filling in potholes, digging landfills, manning river embankments and clearing irrigation channels.&nbsp; The quality of the work is not the priority.&nbsp; All of it could be done more efficiently and to a higher standard with modern machines.&nbsp; Unskilled and hungry labourers cannot build good roads with their bare hands.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luce&nbsp;said that \"the policy prompts no investment in upgrading the skills of the <p align=left>Column: 1962<p>people it is designed to help and it is thus unlikely to create lasting employment for the rural poor\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Singapore situation is not quite comparable to that of&nbsp;India, but Luce's observation reaffirmed my conviction that we must avoid populist but questionable measures like&nbsp;a job guaranteed programme on minimum wages.&nbsp; Instead, we must persevere in the&nbsp;painstaking and unglamorous task of skills upgrading and job recreation.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, we have made some progress.&nbsp; Our achievements include the Skills Redevelopment Programme which has helped more than 300,000 workers reskill and remain relevant and the Job Recreation Programme which has helped to transform the jobs of about 30,000 workers, helping them&nbsp;earn better wages.&nbsp; MOM is also to be commended for putting in place a CET Masterplan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My question is whether these efforts are enough.&nbsp; Specifically, I have argued during the Budget debate that there is an unintended consequence from the easy access to foreign workers in that they could undermine the upgrading efforts.&nbsp; Let me share an example from the cleaning industry.&nbsp; We have a strong supporter of the Job Recreation Programme.&nbsp; To implement the JR Programme, seven senior staff from cleaning supervisors to the Managing Director himself are involved.&nbsp; Their workers will go through over 2,000 man hours of training, costing some $36,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight workers will be trained for supervisory positions, another 20 will have their job scopes expanded.&nbsp; So besides routine cleaning, they will also undertake maintenance work such as unclogging choked pipes.&nbsp; With the job expansion, the workers can earn more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The company will buy equipment that are easier for older workers to operate, costing some $78,000.&nbsp; The company also <p align=left>Column: 1963<p>employs foreign workers.&nbsp; But because of its upgrading efforts, it is expected that by the end of the year, 67 of its workers will be re-employed on reaching the legal requirement age.&nbsp; But it takes tremendous commitment and companies wonder why they should continue trying.&nbsp; In sharp contrast, some of its competitors do not make any attempt at improving job worth so that they are also attractive to Singaporeans.&nbsp; Their message to Singaporeans is, take it or leave it, because they can always hire a foreign worker to replace him.&nbsp; At the same time, service buyers have an indifferent attitude as long as the contract prices are driven down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why I believe we should refine our approach in managing foreign workers' quota to provide greater incentive to upgrade jobs or at least not to allow it to become an impediment.&nbsp; If foreign workers help businesses to moderate costs, then the result should be improved productivity levels.&nbsp; While it may be difficult and inefficient to control quotas at the company level, based on the productivity data, should we try to link the quotas to productivity levels of industry sectors?&nbsp; If we have limited foreign worker quotas, do we allocate them to sectors with declining productivity or those with improving productivity?&nbsp; If foreign workers help businesses to cut short opportunities&nbsp;while the local workforce is being ramped up, then should the quota be time limited? &nbsp;For example, in the hospitality sector where there is a manpower crunch until the supply of trained service staff comes on stream.&nbsp; It makes sense to give the industry a breathing space of two to three years and to enable the players to capture the business opportunities.&nbsp; But the quotas cannot go on forever.&nbsp; If it is clear that the quotas will be phased out or reduced over time, it will provide added incentives for the employers to think seriously of how they will fill the jobs vacated by the <p align=left>Column: 1964<p>temporary supply of foreign workers.&nbsp; This will help to prevent over-dependence on foreign manpower and encourage continuous upgrading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let us not offer Singaporeans a false hope that&nbsp;a job guaranteed programme or minimum wage will solve the problems of low-wage casual and contract workers.&nbsp; But let us hold out the hope that we will refine our policies so that businesses do not take the easy way out of continuous investments in skills upgrading and job recreation. In this way, we would provide a more sustainable basis for the continued presence of foreign workers and also enable&nbsp;Singaporeans at all levels to move ahead as one.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ang Mong Seng</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I> ):&nbsp;&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20080304/20080304VS_111709.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a></I>*.] Sir, Singapore faces a tight labour market.&nbsp; In order to boost growth and development, we need to bring in more foreign workers, especially in the construction, maritime and labour industries.&nbsp; These foreign workers have contributed substantially to our economic growth. Among the mega projects in the pipeline are the Integrated Resort, Sports Hub and other major construction projects.&nbsp; Thus, more foreign workers are needed in the construction sector, and the majority of these foreign workers are from China.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, over the past few years, many major cities in China are also developing numerous large scale construction projects, and so the construction industry is experiencing a boom, thus they need construction workers and professionals to support their domestic demand.&nbsp; At the same time, India and the Middle-East are developing extensively with the rapidly growing construction sector. This has undoubtedly attracted many foreign workers and technicians. As a result, this has caused higher labour costs, particularly foreign engineers, <p align=left>Column: 1965<p>foreign construction workers and related professionals.&nbsp; There is also a shortage for these skilled workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to ask whether the Ministry will review its current policy so that we can attract more foreign talents to join the Singapore construction industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the construction sector, other industries such as food and beverage, sales, cleaning, etc, are also facing labour shortage.&nbsp; I feel that these jobs can be taken up by our local workers.&nbsp; In this regard, I would like to ask the Ministry whether we have any policy to attract foreign talents to supplement the local construction sector and, at the same time, ensure that there are enough job opportunities for Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The challenge remains at making sure that Continuing Education&nbsp;and Training for adults will equip them with real capabilities that will enhance their competitiveness.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key word here is \"competitiveness\".&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to upgrade the quality of our workforce in terms of knowledge, skills, attitude and habits that will translate into higher productivity and better quality outputs for our economy.&nbsp; This way, our workers will be able to reap the fruits of CET.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the CET, we have seen many Singaporean workers gainfully employed and our unemployment rate is in fact now one of the lowest in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it is timely for us to review how effective is our CET programme in enhancing&nbsp;the competitiveness of Singaporean workers and how can we do it better in the future.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there are three pillars of the CET infrastructure:</p>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;The Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) system.&nbsp; WDA has rolled out many WSQ frameworks over the years. What are the problems faced during implementation?&nbsp; Do the employers find it useful and, if yes, in what areas and why?&nbsp;&nbsp; Can <p align=left>Column: 1967<p>WSQ sustain its stay in the frontiers of industry developments so that it will deliver WSQ certified workers that the industries require now and in the future?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;The Employability Skills System (ESS).&nbsp; &nbsp;Do&nbsp;employers find the generic courses under ESS useful?&nbsp; Do employers prefer workers with ESS qualifications?&nbsp;&nbsp; Do the workers think that ESS qualifications help them find jobs?&nbsp; This information is important because it will allow us to assess the effectiveness of ESS and adopt a more targeted approach to improve the system, so that it can better help fellow workers to enhance their competitiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;The CET institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The capability of the training institutes to deliver good quality and well trained workers is the key concern here.&nbsp; However, at the ground, we know that it will be easier to convince both the employers and the workers to go for training courses if it can translate into real value for both the workers and the business.&nbsp; The key here is to identify and develop courses that will address the current and future needs of each industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, thus, we need to build our CET infrastructure that will help our economy to improve its productivity and the quality of its outputs, in terms of goods and services.&nbsp; To do so, it must be based on&nbsp;the depth and knowledge on the various business value chains of different industries and their future trends of developments.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The second point, Sir,&nbsp;is the Prime Minister, at&nbsp;the launch of the CET Masterplan, has said that no matter how much money is pumped into this programme, for it to work, employers and employees alike still need to change their mindsets.&nbsp;

We have been around running these academic programmes in the last 20-30 years.&nbsp; Examples of these setups are MDIS and Singapore Human Resources Institute.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Improving Service Culture</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B> Sir, in his National Day Rally speech in 2005, Prime Minister Lee highlighted the need for a mindset change to improve our service culture.&nbsp; He mentioned that all three parties - companies, service staff and customers - have a role to play to improve service.&nbsp; It was a timely reminder.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The services sector will increasingly be an even bigger value adding contributor to our economy.&nbsp; With the completion of major tourism-related developments and more international events coming to Singapore, we can expect more Singaporeans to make their livelihood in the area of providing service.&nbsp; More full and part-time service workers will be <p align=left>Column: 1969<p>needed for&nbsp;positions such as guest relations, retailing, tour guides and waiters to give consumers a positive experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are truly seeing a significant&nbsp;\"experienced\" economy emerging in Singapore.&nbsp; But do we have the headcount to meet the growth in this sector?&nbsp; Recent reports in the <I>Straits Times</I> suggested that the numbers are not enough to fill the new openings and labour crunch is only going to get worse.&nbsp; Equally important&nbsp;are also our service culture and&nbsp;service software.&nbsp; Are we geared to give consumers and tourists a memorable experience?&nbsp; While we do have good examples of excellent service standards such as SIA and Changi Airport, many of us have also encountered poor service in our various areas of day-to-day life.&nbsp; I will not cite them here today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although customer service very much comes under the purview of private business management, the Government can and should play a part at the national level to improve our service culture.&nbsp; During the SARS crisis in 2003, Hong Kong tourism took a severe hit.&nbsp; In a bid to win back visitors, the Hong Kong government came up with a number of initiatives, one of which was to get top star, Andy Lau, to spread the message of good service standard through a TV campaign, and his light-hearted tagline in Cantonese, \"Why should we tolerate poor service standard in these days and age?\"&nbsp;&nbsp; It became a catch phrase in Hong Kong.&nbsp; Most Hong Kongers bought the serious message behind it.&nbsp; Whether it has anything to do with the campaign, most visitors to Hong Kong now agree that the level of service in Hong Kong has improved and is a far cry from 10 years ago.&nbsp; Back then, shop assistants were known to grumble at shoppers who did not buy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the <I>2007 World Ranking of Service Standards</I> by the World <p align=left>Column: 1970<p>Economic Forum, Hong Kong ranked 7th and was ahead of Singapore, who has improved to 15th.&nbsp; Last year, the Manpower Minister mentioned about equipping Singaporeans with the service DNA so that we can offer a total positive experience to our consumers.&nbsp; Can the Minister share with us how the Government&nbsp;intends to go that extra mile to improve our service culture?&nbsp; Is there a national effort involving the various agencies?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One area we need to do more is also to raise the image&nbsp;and professionalism of our service staff.&nbsp; A friend of mine who used to work in one of the top hotels in Singapore related this incident to me where one of his local service staff was not willing to serve&nbsp;a guest&nbsp;at a particular table in&nbsp;the hotel restaurant because the guest at that table happened to be her friend.&nbsp; She felt embarrassed having to wait on&nbsp;someone she knew.&nbsp; We need to raise the status and the type of work of our service staff.&nbsp; The companies,&nbsp;service staff and&nbsp;customers all have&nbsp;a fair share of mindset change to make.&nbsp; Companies like&nbsp;Disney do this very well.&nbsp; They call their frontline staff cast members, rather than cashiers or waiters.&nbsp; They institute a lot of pride in their staff and of course they are also well remunerated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe the Government can play a catalytic role in the mindset change and further improve our service culture.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</B> Sir, first, let me thank Members for their comments, many of which strike&nbsp;at the heart of&nbsp;our labour market policy, which includes allowing foreign workers to work here.&nbsp; Many good suggestions and&nbsp;many comments. &nbsp;I take it that at the heart of all these questions is the central theme.&nbsp; It is everything we do, in terms of our labour market policy, helping Singaporeans, and that is the gist of what we should address and ask ourselves,&nbsp;because this is a good time to review <p align=left>Column: 1971<p>them.&nbsp; And I would quickly say that the heart of our labour market policy, which includes allowing companies to use foreign workers, is to benefit Singapore and Singaporeans.&nbsp; If&nbsp;it were not so, we will not do it.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are replying from a position of a good year.&nbsp; Last year, as Members observed, was indeed a very good one.&nbsp; Many of you will remember that at the last Committee of Supply, I told Members that MOM had projected 450,000 new jobs for the next five years.&nbsp; It was a somewhat realistic projection, but in over just one year, the economy added 237,000 jobs, more than half in one year what we anticipated for five years.&nbsp; It is a phenomenal growth rate of 9.5%, more typical of a developing economy than a developed one.&nbsp; But beyond the numbers, beyond this phenomenal growth rate for the labour market for&nbsp;our workforce, most importantly, Singaporeans have benefited from this buoyant labour market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members were aware and&nbsp;they themselves cited the figures of&nbsp;92,000 jobs created last year went to locals.&nbsp; Usually, it is only 30,000 jobs because our supply is limited.&nbsp; Indeed, more locals are now employed than ever before&nbsp;in absolute numbers and as a proportion of working age population.&nbsp; So last year, 1.6 million locals aged 25 to 64 were working and this is an all time high of 77%, which puts us almost right there in the top league of nations.&nbsp; We are now essentially at full&nbsp;employment.&nbsp; Our overall and&nbsp;resident unemployment rates&nbsp;are 1.6% and 2.3% respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wages have also gone up.&nbsp; So it is not just numbers.&nbsp; Last year, the median monthly&nbsp;income for locals in full-time employment rose by 7.7% to $2,330, or about 5.5%, after adjusting for inflation.&nbsp; Lower income workers have also benefited - the bottom 20%.&nbsp; They saw <p align=left>Column: 1972<p>their average real income rise by 2%.&nbsp; Singapore citizens in this group would have received more with Workfare Bonus, which is up to 13% of their incomes as well as other one-off Government surplus sharing schemes.&nbsp; So the income that they receive if they are working would have been more than just the wages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry recently released an occasional paper which looked at the employment of Singapore citizens and PRs.&nbsp; In 2006, PRs constituted about 14% of all locals employed.&nbsp; So it is 14% PRs, 86% citizens.&nbsp; And citizens too are indeed benefiting from the economic growth and are getting good jobs -&nbsp; more are employed compared to three years ago when almost two-thirds of this increase in employment are in&nbsp;professional, managerial, executive and&nbsp;technical jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah Yacob and Mr Teo Ser Luck asked, \"will this continue?\"&nbsp; It is a very good question.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;uncertainties&nbsp;but, at present, we continue to maintain&nbsp;a GDP forecast of 4% to 6% for this year. We should have continued employment growth for the year ahead.&nbsp; But I think it will likely&nbsp;be lower than the record gains chalked up last year, which was a phenomenal year.&nbsp; It is hard to believe that our economy can generate almost a 10% growth in the workforce, which is unheard of.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of the new jobs will be in the services sector, especially the tourism-related industries which are driven by strong tourist traffic, and we have a number of big scale events later during the year.&nbsp; I think there will be sufficient jobs for locals, including new entrants into the labour market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Members of Parliament have recognised that we have done well last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;We trotted&nbsp;out the figures.&nbsp; But as equal as it is to understand how we did,</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think we should also ask ourselves why is it we succeeded.&nbsp; If we miss those points, <p align=left>Column: 1973<p>we are likely to make a wrong turn, change the policies that are working for us and find ourselves actually arguing against what we want.&nbsp; If we look at other countries, eg, France, Germany, some of the Scandinavian countries and even the countries around us, they have employed different policies but they have not delivered on their promises or wishes.&nbsp; What explains our ability to create jobs?&nbsp; Is this something to be taken for granted?&nbsp; Do other developed economies perform similarly?&nbsp; Members of this House will agree with me these are essential questions because, if we answer them, then we have the secret of our success.&nbsp; In fact, Singapore is unique.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have distributed a chart which is across sequence but let me show you a dynamic chart.&nbsp; Before I play it, if Members could&nbsp;look at the screens, this basically is a dynamic chart from 2001 to 2006.&nbsp; Singapore would be one bubble but you have other countries there which include Malaysia, China, UK, US, Hong Kong and Japan.&nbsp; I want Members to see the effects, over time, of how Singapore did.&nbsp; We will play the chart now.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Members will note, in 2001 and 2002, there was a recession.&nbsp; GDP growth went up but, after 2003, Singapore jumped and leapt ahead.&nbsp; High GDP growth, high employment growth, far exceeding other countries, not experienced by any country with a similar GDP.&nbsp; We will play that once again because it was hard to catch, but the vertical axis is the GDP growth, the horizontal axis is the employment growth.&nbsp; So, if we could play that again, it would be useful.&nbsp; 2001/02, recession.&nbsp; But after the policies and economic growth started, look how Singapore jumped ahead and moved far to the right as an outlier unparalleled by any other country.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think we should not take this for granted.&nbsp; We are not trying to say that we are good.&nbsp; What we are trying to say is, <p align=left>Column: 1974<p>what have we done right?&nbsp; No other advanced economy has managed what we witnessed in our economy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why have our labour market policy succeeded despite being a small nation with limited manpower?&nbsp; Put simply, we have created good-paying jobs for Singaporeans through growth because we allowed businesses access to foreign workers to meet their manpower needs.&nbsp; This was the exact point raised in a recent article in <I>The Economist</I> which argued that migrants supplemented shrinking local workforces, as ours is.&nbsp; Similarly, the Chairman of the US Council of Economic Advisers, Prof Edward Lazear, concluded in a review that immigrants not only help fuel economic growth in the US but also had a positive effect on the income of local workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we had relied on our limited local manpower supply, growth would be slower and fewer jobs would be created.&nbsp; This is the experience in other countries.&nbsp; Look around us - France, Germany, even Indonesia.&nbsp; In other countries, they tend to close their labour markets.&nbsp; Indeed, Singapore was referred to in <I>The Economist</I> as &ldquo;a developed country that grows at the rate of a developing country&rdquo;.&nbsp; This is a big plus for us.&nbsp; It explains to us why we have been able to deliver jobs to Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But other countries are also wising up.&nbsp; They, too, realise that there is a secret in this formula.&nbsp; Australia and the UK recently liberalised their policies to attract foreign talent. &nbsp;Countries that have controlled tightly the admission of lower-skilled foreign workers, such as Canada, and even traditionally closed societies like Korea, have begun to relax their criteria to allow in foreign workers to support businesses&rsquo; growth.&nbsp; Is there an appropriate balance, as suggested by Dr Ahmad Magad, between keeping locals employed and admitting the right number of foreign workers or, as Mdm Halimah Yacob asked, in terms of the S-Pass relaxation?&nbsp; I think there is.&nbsp; Yes, indeed, <p align=left>Column: 1975<p>this is not an unfettered free-for-all.&nbsp; We want to calibrate it using quotas, levies and various qualifications and, as Mdm Halimah Yacob mentioned, the S-Pass.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I want to point out that&nbsp;augmenting our local workforce with foreign manpower has actually increased job opportunities for Singaporeans and locals, even for those of a higher grade which Mdm Halimah&nbsp;Yacob asked for, ie,&nbsp;professional managers, executives and technicians (PMETs).&nbsp; Our&nbsp;diploma-holders and graduates have continued to benefit from the strong labour market.&nbsp; I will give Members a few figures.&nbsp; The unemployment rate amongst&nbsp;polytechnic diploma-holders&nbsp;fell from 5.6% in&nbsp;2004, before the introduction of the S-Pass, to 3.4% in June 2007, after the introduction of the S-Pass.&nbsp; Last year, we saw an almost&nbsp;50% increase in the number of job vacancies requiring at least a diploma qualification.&nbsp; When we asked the polytechnics, they told us they are doing well.&nbsp; 90% of new polytechnic graduates&nbsp;entering the labour market had a job&nbsp;within six months of graduation.&nbsp; Their average starting salary has also gone up by 12% over that in 2004, and last year it was at&nbsp;$1,810.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, contrary to the fear that allowing foreign manpower in Singapore might push locals out, the reverse has happened.&nbsp; We have created more jobs for Singaporeans, good-paying jobs, wages have gone up.&nbsp; Why is this so?&nbsp; A very simple reason is&nbsp;that in this borderless&nbsp;world,&nbsp;businesses will move to places where there are capital, ideas and labour.&nbsp; If we restrict their access to capital, ideas and labour, they will just move out, as other countries have found out.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;we do not protect our local workers here by keeping others out.&nbsp; We actually do them a disservice.&nbsp; This has happened in France, Germany and almost every country that adopts a closed-door policy, whether it is <p align=left>Column: 1976<p>to capital, ideas or labour.&nbsp; They are, in this new world, fungible to some degree.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by no means does this mean that we can stop and rest on our laurels.&nbsp; In 2007, we were ranked as the most competitive labour market in the World Competitiveness Yearbook, and we will have to work extra hard to keep that pole position.&nbsp; As mentioned by Dr Teo and Dr Lim Wee Kiak, the productivity and value-add of our workers will be increasingly important, going forward.&nbsp; I cannot promise Dr Lim Wee Kiak when his two foreign workers will stop switching signs.&nbsp; At least, they are switching them correctly at this point of time.&nbsp; We will work with them and try to improve their productivity.&nbsp; Dr Lim is right.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2007, our&nbsp;labour productivity actually fell by 0.9%, compared to the gains that we had in 2006 and 2005, which were about&nbsp;1.5% to 3% respectively where productivity went up.&nbsp; So, our National Wages Council will&nbsp;have to&nbsp;bear this in mind during their deliberations&nbsp;this year.&nbsp; Why did they go down?&nbsp; Because employment growth went up and wages, including local wages, went up.&nbsp; So, bear that in mind.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we boost our productivity levels further?&nbsp; Mrs Josephine Teo&nbsp;suggested linking foreign worker access to industry upgrading and re-development efforts.&nbsp; Dr Ahmad Magad suggested that let us make employers sweat a bit.&nbsp; The basic theory of both of them is to make them sweat a bit so that they will increase their productivity or try harder to get local workers.&nbsp; Other countries have tried what Dr Ahmad Magad suggested.&nbsp; Do you know what they do?&nbsp; They published three times in a well-respected paper and that is&nbsp;the equivalent of looking for local workers, then they employ others.&nbsp; We make it stringent.&nbsp; We set a quota, you cannot bust this quota, and we set a levy.&nbsp; It is simple, it works and creates jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp; But the main point is this.&nbsp; We have to continue to see how we can stay relevant and <p align=left>Column: 1977<p>competitive and even, despite our relative ease of access to labour, we need to focus on skills and productivity to stay ahead.&nbsp; I do not think we can do it by restricting and making the labour market more rigid.&nbsp; It has not worked.&nbsp; It is counter-productive.&nbsp; Doing so would tie and restrict the growth of companies, because companies need to be nimble and get their manpower supply.&nbsp; Rather, from time to time, we have to maintain and refine our foreign worker policy so that companies can capitalise quickly on opportunities and grow and create jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this issue of productivity is a central one.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three things that we need to do:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, re-create jobs, as NTUC is doing and spearheading, and we have seen the successes they had in the security and landscaping sectors.&nbsp; Last year,&nbsp;15,000 jobs were re-created.&nbsp; They will press on, we will assist them,&nbsp;the WDA and the other agencies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, get companies to upgrade.&nbsp; This year's Budget provides new incentives to encourage companies to invest in technology and innovation to enhance productivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, develop a first-class Continuing Education and Training (CET) system to help our workforce stay ahead.&nbsp; I agree with Members that this is the key challenge, if we want to keep our competitive edge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members rightly pointed out,&nbsp;the PM had announced the CET Masterplan during the opening of the Employability and Employment Institute (e2i).&nbsp; This marks a significant milestone in the development of CET in Singapore and signals the training of adult workers as one of Government&rsquo;s top priorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as Dr Ahmad Magad and Mr Seng Han Thong mentioned, we need to be careful and clever in crafting our CET.&nbsp; We <p align=left>Column: 1978<p>cannot treat it like our school system.&nbsp; They&nbsp;must be different.&nbsp; They are different in two ways.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, it needs to be more industry-driven because workers will go for training if the skills are relevant, if they&nbsp;value the new skills they get, if they can get a new job and higher pay.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, CET has to be adult-friendly.&nbsp; We should improve access through affordability and reduce unnecessary academic pre-requisites. &nbsp;Adults learn differently.&nbsp; I am not sure&nbsp;whether Members have noticed it, but the way we read the newspapers has changed through the years.&nbsp; I am sure we are reading more of the headlines and less of the fine print,&nbsp;and I think that is a one-way directional trend.&nbsp; So, courses have to be&nbsp;shorter, more practice-oriented.&nbsp; Attention spans are shorter, so it has to be less academic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have to re-invent the wheel. &nbsp;There are well-established adult training systems in many parts of the developed world &ndash; UK, Canada, Australia, Germany and Scandinavia.&nbsp; We are promiscuous when it comes to good ideas.&nbsp; We will borrow where it suits us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have learnt from them and implemented some ideas.&nbsp; Over the last few years, we have made good progress.&nbsp; Mr Seng Han Thong asked about the Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) system, how it is doing.&nbsp; Not bad.&nbsp; It&nbsp;used to be that advertisements only said&nbsp;three or five GCE O-levels.&nbsp; Now, there is a new line - \"WSQ and ESS accepted too\".&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think that is currency.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is worth it, because it shows people that if I get it, in lieu of my academic qualifications, I can show them this.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that is useful.&nbsp;&nbsp;145,000 workers have attained WSQ certification over the three years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have a cadre of competent training providers, something that Dr Ahmad Magad talked about.&nbsp; If we do not <p align=left>Column: 1979<p>have good training providers, we would not have a good system.&nbsp; At the higher tier are 19 CET Centres, with a capacity to train about 22,000 workers a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these systems in place, it is now an appropriate time to ramp up and move up to the next phase in developing our adult training system with our CET Masterplan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Masterplan aims to prepare Singaporean workers to remain competitive in the future.&nbsp; We should not be stuck in today&rsquo;s mindsets based on today&rsquo;s scenarios&nbsp;and present concerns.&nbsp; That would be the least productive thing that we can do.&nbsp; Instead, we must set&nbsp;preconditions now to succeed for the future. And we should do it now, while we are ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What will&nbsp;the&nbsp;future&nbsp;be?&nbsp;&nbsp;The future will be very different.&nbsp; Let me give two examples.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Our&nbsp;workforce.&nbsp; In 2020,&nbsp;nearly 60% of our resident workforce will have at least a diploma qualification.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just think about that.&nbsp; Six out of 10 will have at least a diploma.&nbsp; Now, it is only about 36%.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;22%&nbsp;10 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;And 40-odd percent or even half of&nbsp;new entrants into the workforce are likely to have degrees.&nbsp; Is our CET structure today compatible with our workforce of tomorrow?&nbsp; I think not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape and structure of our economy will change in tandem.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is harder to project what our economy will be but, generally, industries will have to move up the value-add and innovation chain, and will certainly require workers with higher skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not alone in recognising that this future is coming upon us.&nbsp; The UK recently launched a major review of its <p align=left>Column: 1980<p>future education system.&nbsp; Last year, they did it to improve its skills profile.&nbsp; And it is setting up new National Skills Academies, which introduce new diplomas and apprenticeships, and developing new qualification frameworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a small country, we cannot afford to lag behind and play catch-up.&nbsp; We need to stay ahead, and the way to do that is&nbsp;by continually investing in our people, so that each generation of Singaporeans will be better skilled and better able to seize the opportunities that lie ahead.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">5.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To successfully implement the CET Masterplan, we are matching our resolve with more resources with a top-up of $800 million in the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund (LLEF).&nbsp;&nbsp;This fund is now $3 billion. We will eventually top it up to $5 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thank many Members who have voiced their support for CET -&nbsp;Dr Ahmad Magad, Mr Heng Chee How and Mr Zainudin Nordin during the Budget debate, Mr Seng Han Thong, Mdm Ho Geok Choo and&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang.&nbsp; They have also raised questions and challenges which I think are relevant.&nbsp; They asked: what are the key success factors?&nbsp; What will the CET Masterplan mean for employers and&nbsp;vulnerable groups -&nbsp;those who are unemployed, structurally vulnerable?&nbsp; And I think these are important points.&nbsp; Let me address them just briefly with three key strategic thrusts of our Masterplan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we will better integrate our school systems,&nbsp;Pre-Employment Training (PET) and&nbsp;CET.&nbsp; Mr Seng Han Thong said that&nbsp;the WSQ and Employability Skills System (ESS) standards are now accepted by industry, but we will create more bridges.&nbsp; To illustrate, a worker who has a polytechnic diploma or a&nbsp;<I>Nitec</I> qualification from ITE&nbsp;can take up a WSQ course and vice versa, and &nbsp;someone with <p align=left>Column: 1981<p>a WSQ Certificate should also be able to cross over to a&nbsp;diploma&nbsp;and even a degree in the future. &nbsp;MOM and MOE will be looking into establishing stronger linkages between the CET and formal education systems.&nbsp; It will give assurance to our workers that what they get is valuable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, as Dr Ahmad Magad said, we need to&nbsp;establish more CET Centres to deliver quality training for adult learners.&nbsp; By 2010, we will increase the annual training capacity four-fold&nbsp;from the current&nbsp;about 20,000 today to 80,000 by adding 10 more CET Centres in growth sectors and expanding the existing Centres.&nbsp; So 10 more new CET Centres.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some of these Centres will involve our polytechnics and ITEs. The training expertise of the private sector and NTUC will also be harnessed. Let me cite for you&nbsp;some things that are coming onstream to give you a better flavour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the pharmaceutical industry as an example in the manufacturing sector.&nbsp; Talks are underway between public sector agencies,&nbsp;NUS and key pharmaceutical companies, such as GlaxoSmithKline to set up&nbsp;a Singapore Academy of&nbsp;GxP (Pharma) Excellence (SAGE).&nbsp;&nbsp;This will facilitate the discovery of new technologies in&nbsp;manufacturing and&nbsp;developing pharmaceuticals, biologics and medical devices. So the centre will offer WSQ courses in pharmaceutical and biologics that can potentially articulate to Bachelor and Masters programmes in NUS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fast-growing aviation industry also has something to look forward to. The Air Transport Training College, Singapore Polytechnic and ITE will work together to train more technicians for maintenance, repair and overhaul.&nbsp; So, now&nbsp;a technician undergoing this Aerospace WSQ course can become operationally competent in&nbsp;four months, and progress to a Certifying Technician after accumulating one or two years of work experience.&nbsp; It is much <p align=left>Column: 1982<p>truncated and there is a progression pathway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the services sector, we will see growth in areas&nbsp;like private banking, asset management and &ldquo;high-trust&rdquo; services such as accountancy, legal and other professional businesses.&nbsp; To support this growth,&nbsp;you have&nbsp;five CET Centres specialising in areas such as risk management, wealth management and insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a collaborative effort between WDA, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Institute of Banking&nbsp;and Finance (IBF).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In tourism and hospitality, an area close to Member Liang Eng&nbsp;Hwa's heart, ITE is studying the use of existing campuses to consolidate all of its hospitality-related CET offerings. This translates to about 2,500 training places a year in hospitality-related professions, such as restaurant and&nbsp;F&amp;B managers, concierges and guest relations officers.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will&nbsp;raise the service standards of the sector, as Mr Liang has asked for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These developments will strengthen our adult training infrastructure. So the landscape will be a number of CET Centres and providers around the island, industry specific, so that a few workers can go to it and, within each industry, a few&nbsp;Centres will serve as standard bearers, with accredited&nbsp;WSQ trainers based on fixed standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we want to promote peaks of excellence by according the best CET Centres the status of National CET Institutes and will invest more in their&nbsp;resources. They will be the best-in-class institutes, with excellent programmes and&nbsp;qualities, training methods and delivery of outcomes. The first few&nbsp;National CET Institutes will be announced later this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to have quality and training effectiveness, as Dr Ahmad Magad has <p align=left>Column: 1983<p>said.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have said that we may not know how to do certain things,&nbsp;I agree with them.&nbsp; I think that we need to learn how to teach adults because we never had a long history of learning how to teach adults.&nbsp; So&nbsp;we will set up an Institute for Adult Learning to do research and development and help build up our capabilities in adult training methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our vision is to allow all workers access to adult training&nbsp;- whether it is&nbsp;to prepare for new jobs, switch careers or acquire new skills.&nbsp; And they must&nbsp;find the training relevant and exciting&nbsp;within our dynamic CET landscape, including PMETs, which is a point raised by Mdm Ho Geok Choo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can build the systems and training institutes but to be more effective, we will need the human touch.&nbsp; As noted by others, sometimes,&nbsp;the workers lack&nbsp;the confidence to go for training or&nbsp;take up a new job.&nbsp; So we will work with our tripartite partners and our community partners &ndash; employers, unions, the CDCs and self-help groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over time, MOM and WDA will work with the CDCs on elevating their job centres into career centres so that, beyond the capability to place unemployed into jobs, they can also help employed workers with advice on acquiring better skills and finding better jobs and better pay. I think this will strengthen the CDCs&rsquo; efforts in improving the lives of their residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me also say to Members that I fully understand the challenge in building the CET system.&nbsp; I do not&nbsp;underestimate the challenge.&nbsp; It will take time and effort from all of us -&nbsp;Government, unions, employers and workers themselves.&nbsp; But the fact that many Singaporeans will benefit in life-changing ways&nbsp;should motivate us for the longer term, and this <p align=left>Column: 1984<p>will take time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;illustrate quickly through real life stories because, finally, this is what is all about -&nbsp;helping Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;And these&nbsp;stories should keep our spirits and energy high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First example is&nbsp;Mr Poh Kian Hock -&nbsp;he is 43 years old, he was a warehouse supervisor in an electronics manufacturing company, he got retrenched last year.&nbsp; He sought help from NTUC, and was referred to take up training at the NTUC Learning Hub.&nbsp; He earned a WSQ Certificate in Generic Manufacturing Skills.&nbsp; This month, he will start work again, as a store supervisor in A&amp;G International Holdings, a petroleum company, drawing a salary double of that in his previous job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp; Then there is Mr Andry Lie,&nbsp;who is&nbsp;an entrepreneur but he decided he wanted&nbsp;to be involved with MICE, not real running mice, but&nbsp;the acronym for&nbsp;Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions.&nbsp; So he&nbsp;took a WSQ Diploma Programme in the University of Nevada Las Vegas.&nbsp; He graduated from the programme recently&nbsp;and is&nbsp;working as an intern with Meeting Professionals International (MPI).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Effandi bin Mohamed, 27, holds a Diploma in IT. He used to be a videographer.&nbsp; I did not know that there was such a&nbsp;post called videographer.&nbsp; I thought all of us are amateur videographers, and I suppose he took videos.&nbsp; But he&nbsp;resigned and enrolled in a WSQ Specialist Programme in 3D Animation and Visual Effects.&nbsp;&nbsp;He graduated last year and&nbsp;was selected by a UK-based firm, Double Negative -&nbsp;I think it must become positive if it were double negative -&nbsp;to further his skills in a one-year attachment in London.&nbsp;&nbsp;Double Negative&nbsp;is the firm responsible for the visual effects in the Harry Potter series of movies.&nbsp; So I hope we&nbsp;have a chance to see Effandi&rsquo;s work soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, not all courses need to be so long.&nbsp; Why am I showing you a girl <p align=left>Column: 1985<p>climbing a tree?&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because&nbsp;Ms Thereis Choo&nbsp;is an NParks scholar.&nbsp; She&nbsp;has actually got a first class in Botany.&nbsp; Part of her job&nbsp;was to&nbsp;inspect trees.&nbsp; So to do her job better, she took a three-day course in professional tree climbing.&nbsp; I never knew there was such a course, and you could charge for it.&nbsp; She took a three-day professional course&nbsp;at the Centre for Urban Greenery and Ecology.&nbsp; They use ropes,&nbsp;harness and&nbsp;pulley system.&nbsp; She even won the tree climbing competition at last year&rsquo;s Green Thumb, an annual event organised by NParks, and is now a champion tree climber!</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These stories carry a few important messages:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First , hope -&nbsp;that&nbsp;workers can upgrade, secure better jobs and get better pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, assurance -&nbsp;that we cannot promise Singaporeans that there will always be blue skies, that the economy will be like last year and that there will be no disruption.&nbsp; In fact, even for&nbsp;mid-career executives, there may be disruption but a well established CET system will give assurance that they can make career switches as&nbsp;Andry Lie did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, offers progress -&nbsp;that every worker&nbsp;can sharpen his skills,&nbsp;maintain relevant and do his work better, whether he is like Mr Effandi&nbsp;or&nbsp;Ms Thereis Choo who learned professional tree climbing to do her work more effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, we want to build a CET system that creates opportunities, offering many pathways for workers to play to their strengths and fulfil their potential and aspirations.&nbsp; It will empower workers to take charge of their own careers, and make the best out of the opportunities Singapore offers. There will be thousands of workers that will follow the examples I cited today&nbsp;- they will take&nbsp;charge of their own lives because&nbsp;our CET system is <p align=left>Column: 1986<p>accessible, affordable and adds value to their careers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is our&nbsp;vision, and with the support of tripartite and community partners, we can build a first-class CET system&nbsp;which will be a key economic and social institution that keeps us ahead and keeps our economy thriving&nbsp;and creating jobs.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>CPF LIFE</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Sir, CPF LIFE has sought to address some of the objections to the original compulsory annuity proposal.&nbsp; Its stated aim is to help Singaporeans' CPF savings last a lifetime.&nbsp; While we await further elaborations on the details, some of its features raised concerns.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first concern is its lack of universal coverage.&nbsp; The catchment group has narrowed from the original plan to include most CPF members below 50, to only those with at least $40,000 in their Minimum Sum balances.&nbsp; 25% of active CPF members will not be covered due to insufficient balances.&nbsp; As mentioned earlier by other Members, including Prof. Kalyani Mehta, the ironic outcome is that those who are more likely to end up as the aged poor are not covered, which includes the lower income, those with unstable employment and those without families to depend on.&nbsp; What is the Government's plan for their old age security?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, according to the Committee's report, one of CPF LIFE's aims is \"to provide a steady income for life\".&nbsp; The question is: how steady is it, considering interest rate fluctuations?&nbsp; Last year, the Government decided to unfix interest rates on the Special Medisave and Retirement Account (or SMRA) from 4% to fluctuate with a long-term bond yield <p align=left>Column: 1987<p>rate.&nbsp; Now, the base rate on all CPF monies is 2.5%, with an additional 1% interest on the first $60,000.&nbsp; If the interest rates on SMRA should fall to this level, the projections of monthly payments shown by the Committee&nbsp;in the Annexes to their report will not apply as they based their assumptions on interest rates being between 4.5%&nbsp;and 5.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the MOM website, it is stated that \"for the entire duration of the policy, payout amounts can change, depending on the actual CPF interest rates and underlying mortality experience.&nbsp; For instance, a 0.5 percentage point difference in interest rate assumption will lead to a change in payouts by about 10%\".&nbsp; For those with lower Minimum Sums, the monthly payments&nbsp;under CPF LIFE, at 4% interest with additional 1% on the first $60,000, are estimated to be between $300&nbsp;and $500.&nbsp; Downward fluctuations in interest rates could bring their payouts to below subsistence level.&nbsp; This outcome is highly undesirable.&nbsp; How will these members be protected?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, there is still wide concern about inflation risk and the fact that CPF LIFE payments are not inflation-indexed.&nbsp; This could seriously erode purchasing power.&nbsp; The Committee discussed this but decided against it.&nbsp; With most people probably opting for the default scheme of Refund 80, the premium would be deducted at age 55 and only payable 25 years later.&nbsp; We will be locking away significant sums for 25 years of investment.&nbsp; Is it not possible to use the investment returns to provide some protection against inflation?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In any case, it remains unclear what would be done for those who do not qualify for CPF LIFE.&nbsp; This includes the self-employed and casual workers who do not contribute to CPF and female homemakers.&nbsp; Sir, the CPF has assumed a central role in how we deliver help to less fortunate Singaporeans and there have been laudable efforts to get the self-employed and casual workers onto CPF.&nbsp; But those who are unable to contribute to CPF for whatever reason now face a double-whammy.&nbsp; Firstly,&nbsp;they do not get Workfare Income Supplement payments.&nbsp; Secondly, unless they top-up their CPF, and many, if not most, will be unable to do so, then they do not get the L-Bonus either.&nbsp; Indeed, giving the L-Bonus only to those with some CPF but not those with any almost seems perverse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what do we do&nbsp;about those who fall outside CPF LIFE?&nbsp; Many will be homemakers who look after their families instead of working.&nbsp; Incentives to encourage CPF top-ups for them are well and good but would not solve the problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this House debated the CPF changes last September, I noted that those changes did not address the fundamental issue of Singaporeans without meaningful CPF balances in the first place.&nbsp; I do not&nbsp;think that the Government has articulated an adequate response to this question.&nbsp; CPF LIFE certainly&nbsp; does not address that at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, I also noted that the compulsory nature of the Longevity Insurance Scheme represented and I quote: \"an unprecedented&nbsp;inroad into <p align=left>Column: 1989<p>members' ownership rights over their CPF funds\".&nbsp; It is fundamentally different from the Medisave and Special Accounts, because the funds in&nbsp;those accounts remain the member's, and the member is not compelled to spend them on anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a fundamental sea change in the nature of CPF members' rights over their balances that merits a thorough debate on the nature of CPF membership.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we have not had one.&nbsp; The committee's response to feedback on the scheme being compulsory was a bald statement that this was necessary, \"To avoid deficiencies created through adverse selection and opt-outs\".&nbsp; That is true.&nbsp; But&nbsp;it represents an implicit value judgment placing the interest of the community over those of the individual.&nbsp; This interference with members' property rights has not been justified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I appreciate both the pros and cons of&nbsp; making CPF LIFE mandatory.&nbsp; It is probably impossible to satisfy everyone but, perhaps, if the Government introduces measures targeting those who do not qualify for CPF LIFE to clearly show that even as Singaporeans bear the primary responsibility of taking care of themselves, the Government recognises the needs of those who fall short, then the compulsory nature of CPF LIFE might become more palatable to Singaporeans.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Kalyani K Mehta (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>CPF Employer Contribution Rate for 50-55 Years Age Group</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Kalyani K Mehta (Nominated Member):</B> Sir, today I want to focus on the categorisation of employees' age in the CPF framework and the implications of the employers' contribution rate pegged to it.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the CPF Annual Report 2006, Annex A,&nbsp;the employer's and employee's contributions&nbsp;rate were the same for working adults up to age 55 years.&nbsp; For example, in 1999, the <p align=left>Column: 1990<p>employer's contribution rate was 10% and employee's contribution rate was 20%&nbsp;&nbsp;for the categories of&nbsp;35 years all the way to 55 years.&nbsp; Similarly, in 2004, the employer's contribution rate was 13%, employee's contribution rate was 20% for all the age groups mentioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A critical change took place in January 2005 in the age categorisation scheme.&nbsp; The below 35 years age group and the above 35 to 45 age group were retained.&nbsp; However, after that, five-year intervals were introduced, namely, above 45 to 50 years, above 50 to 55 and above 55 to 60 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time in 2005, the employer's contribution rate for the age group 50 to 55 years was reduced by two percentage points.&nbsp; In 2006, the difference was four percentage points, as compared to the 45 to 50 years age category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2007, the four percentage point difference was retained.&nbsp; It was rationalised that the reduction in employer's contribution rate for the 50 to 55 years age group was needed in order to help them to remain in the workforce and be employable.&nbsp; I can understand that from 2001 to 2004, the economy was not doing well and the Government may have taken this policy decision to help older workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the CPF Annual Report 2005, the number of active workers in the age group 50 to 55 was 322,000, in 2006 it was 337,000.&nbsp; As it is evident, there was a small improvement but nothing very significant.&nbsp; It is my contention that reduction of the employer's contribution rate after age 55 years is acceptable, as it is also the CPF withdrawal age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the reduction of the employer's contribution rate for the age group 50 to 55 years is ageist discrimination, as it gives the signal that this age group is not as productive as the 45 to 50 years age <p align=left>Column: 1991<p>group.&nbsp; More importantly, it goes against Article 12 of the Singapore Constitution as it discriminates against Singapore citizens on the basis of age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, a person who is 51 years old is usually doing the same job as somebody who is 48 years old but is paid less overall.&nbsp; From the lifespan perspective, Members of the House would agree that the period 50 to 55 years is a time when the middle age economic squeeze is felt most.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, couples tend to tie the knot later, perhaps around 30 years.&nbsp; And their parents at the age of 50 would still be having economic responsibilities for his growing children who could be in junior college, National Service, polytechnic or university.&nbsp; It is also at this time period that the grandparents tend to fall ill and the sandwich generation is facing economic pressure from younger and older family members.&nbsp; Inflation, of course, is a compounding factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, my view is that this policy is also anti-family and discourages fertility as it impresses on the next generation the struggles of the parents in making ends meet.&nbsp; The total fertility rate is only 1.26 today but we need a fertility rate of 2.15 for a stable population.&nbsp; In NUS, when I teach the subject of social gerontology, I will discuss policies in class.&nbsp; This is raised by my fourth year students.&nbsp; On the one hand, national policies encourage older workers to continue working for as long as possible but, on the other hand, the CPF contribution rates from employers devalue the older workers through reduction of&nbsp; the&nbsp;employer's CPF rate.&nbsp; Younger generations can identify the negative signals sent to society and to employers by this policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp;uproot ageism in society, it is incumbent on the Government to lead by <p align=left>Column: 1992<p>example through our consistent policies.&nbsp; In view of recent policy changes&nbsp;with the appointment of Mr Lim Boon Heng as Minister-in-charge of ageing issues -&nbsp;he is present here -&nbsp;the establishment of the Council for&nbsp;Third Age or C3A,&nbsp;the Silver Industry Committee and other prospective changes such as CPF LIFE, I think the Ministry of Manpower should review the need to continue this formula.&nbsp; The inconsistency in policy rhetoric and actual policy decisions is clear to educated baby boomers of today.&nbsp; The reinstatement of employer's contribution rate would impact on&nbsp;the CPF nestegg of individuals of this age band and an immediate positive outcome would be that more Singaporeans would be able to qualify for CPF LIFE scheme in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I want to ask the Minister&nbsp;for Manpower to give me valid reasons, and give the House valid reasons, for continuing with this current policy.&nbsp; Is there any empirical evidence that the reduction of employer's contribution rate has actually led to more employability of older workers.&nbsp; On the other hand ---</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We need to bring in as many as possible the remaining 20% to 30%.&nbsp; Many of them are either self-employed or casual or low wage workers.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To achieve this, company-based self-employed and association-based self-<p align=left>Column: 1993<p>employed like taxi drivers, hawker assistants, newspaper vendors, insurance agents and&nbsp;housing agents need to come into the CPF system.&nbsp; The challenge here is how to help them to have a&nbsp;better job and better pay, and instil in them the habit of saving.&nbsp; Besides, they need to top-up from time to time, either on their own or by their family members, so as to have sufficient savings for their Medisave account and attain the Minimum Sum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an uphill task.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the labour movement, together with the CPF Board and the relevant company associations, should work closely together to make it happen.&nbsp; And on top of this, we should also create&nbsp;greater&nbsp;awareness among the employed and self-employed on the CPF LIFE, so that our workers understand the concept of income for life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the CPF LIFE scheme is a good scheme.&nbsp; May I declare my interest? &nbsp;I am a Member of the National Longevity Insurance Committee.&nbsp; Unlike what Mr Siew said, we consulted widely -&nbsp;the grassroots leaders,&nbsp;union leaders,&nbsp;experts and&nbsp;industry players.&nbsp; As a result of the consultation, we offered&nbsp;12 options to cater for different needs of Singaporeans.&nbsp; However, it looks like the more options we offer, the more confusion it has caused among Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;As many Singaporeans will end up in the default Refund 80 plan,&nbsp;may I suggest to the Minister that we name it the&nbsp;Standard Package and drop the words Refund 80.&nbsp; For Refund 80, many thought that if they do not make any decision, Refund 80 means that&nbsp;they will get the payout only from 80.&nbsp; That is wrong.&nbsp; In fact, whatever package they choose, it will start from 65.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the challenge for the CPF Board is to explain to the public in a very easy-to-understand and simple way without mentioning any of the 12 options.&nbsp; Another question is this.&nbsp;&nbsp;For Members <p align=left>Column: 1994<p>turning 55, some have asked, \"Can the CPF Board allow those who do not want the&nbsp;additional 1% interest on their first&nbsp;$20,000 in the Ordinary Account, to invest on their own in the hope to get returns?\"</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Rising inflation and&nbsp;rising educational cost will invariably mean having to prioritise between basic needs and education.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the case of a young married couple, the cost of raising a family will invariably make lifelong education a luxury they may not be able to afford.&nbsp; While thousands of students are attending night classes,&nbsp;there are many more who are missing out because of the reasons&nbsp;I have just stated.&nbsp; Even among those taking part-time courses, many are unable to pursue their studies beyond the diploma stage because a degree will cost them quite a substantial sum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Money in CPF accounts, if allowed to be used for recognised part-time degree courses will be helpful.&nbsp; If share investment, which&nbsp;has inherent risks, is allowed, then surely there is greater merit for CPF money to be used for continuing education.&nbsp; We constantly hear the Government extolling the importance of lifelong learning, yet the CPF policy is denying the account holders the opportunity to do so.&nbsp; It has been argued that CPF is for one's retirement and <p align=left>Column: 1995<p>healthcare.&nbsp; Then, my point is that it would be even more appropriate to invest in education which will further strengthen one's ability to earn more and this will translate into even more savings for retirement through higher salary and by remaining employable for many more years.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Sir, let me thank Members who have commented on CPF LIFE - Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Siew Kum Hong, Prof. Mehta and Mr Seng Han <p align=left>Column: 1996<p>Thong.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think some other Members also commented on it during the Budget debate - Mr Ang Mong Seng, Dr Amy Khor, Mdm Halimah Yacob, Dr Lim Wee Kiak, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Zainudin Nordin.&nbsp; I will try to take some of their queries here.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has accepted the recommendations of the National Longevity Insurance Committee chaired by Prof. Lim Pin.&nbsp; It was a Committee appointed by the Ministry, and&nbsp;my own reply to them is that they have done a great service for Singaporeans.&nbsp; I had called it a landmark report and it is so, because the Committee&rsquo;s proposals for annuity plans, now simply called CPF LIFE, significantly strengthens our CPF system, and&nbsp;it provides a much needed tool to address the increasing lifespans&nbsp;of Singaporeans and our ageing population.&nbsp; As everyone should know by now, CPF LIFE will provide members an income for as long as they live, instead of an abrupt cut-off with no income when they are older and most dependent, as in the current Minimum Sum scheme.&nbsp; I am gratified by the positive response to CPF LIFE from members of the public, the media and MPs.&nbsp; The <I>Straits Times</I> said that it \"recommends it thoroughly\", and&nbsp;\"that this is a plan that &hellip; sells itself.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; These positive responses from the media, grassroots organisations,&nbsp;unions and members of the public&nbsp;reassure the Government that its efforts to improve the retirement adequacy of Singaporeans - and I know that this requires substantial changes&nbsp;- are correct policies, and indeed appreciated by the public at large.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also want to thank Members of this House for&nbsp;supporting&nbsp;CPF LIFE.&nbsp; At the same time, we recognise that there will always be&nbsp;gaps.&nbsp; This is a new plan and we will take in the good&nbsp;suggestions to&nbsp;improve the scheme further.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I want to caution that we should not impose demands on CPF LIFE to deliver on goals for which it is not meant to address.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1997<p>Neither should we expect CPF LIFE to carry burdens for which it was not designed.&nbsp; If we did&nbsp;so, it would doom the scheme to fail eventually.&nbsp; We have to remember that&nbsp;this is a scheme that will have to provide for retirement needs for successive generations of Singaporeans.&nbsp; So we must ensure, first and foremost,&nbsp;that&nbsp;CPF LIFE itself is financially sustainable for the very long term.&nbsp; If we start in 2013 for those aged 50, some of them may live to 100 or more.&nbsp; So, at least, for one generation, it has to last 50 years or more.&nbsp; For successive generations, we will have to be very careful that&nbsp;CPF LIFE must be started and operated based on the correct principles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is exactly how we should start.&nbsp; The cardinal principle and critical pillar underpinning the viability of CPF LIFE must be that a member can only spend what he saves.&nbsp; This has been the guiding star of our CPF system since it was started&nbsp;50 years ago in 1955.&nbsp; We have never wavered from this guide-post, despite any challenge.&nbsp; We have kept the CPF self-funded.&nbsp; All of us contribute to our CPF with that clear expectation that we can only spend what we saved.&nbsp; We should be very careful to reiterate that CPF LIFE does not dilute this principle.&nbsp; Yes, there is some risk pooling, but the amount you put can be determined by you, and you can even get out sometimes more than what you put in.&nbsp; It does not dilute the principle that you can only spend what you saved.&nbsp; This principle ensures that the assets within the CPF LIFE match its liabilities.&nbsp; This is why Prof. Lim Pin's Committee was also careful to point out that the payouts from CPF LIFE, as Ms Sylvia Lim mentioned,&nbsp;must take into account future mortality experience and actual investment returns, to ensure that CPF LIFE remains fully funded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Siew Kum Hong and Ms Sylvia Lim talked about universal coverage and what about those who are not included.&nbsp; This does not mean that we do not assist <p align=left>Column: 1998<p>those who do not work and do not have CPF funds, but we should mix the two.&nbsp; The CPF LIFE in the CPF system is not a financial assistance scheme.&nbsp; It is an individualised pension system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither does it imply that we should be satisfied that some groups are left out of CPF LIFE.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, as Mr Seng Han Thong said, bring in as many as possible into this safety net.&nbsp; But they must be brought in on the correct terms and, indeed, we must step up efforts to increase the reach of CPF LIFE to include as many as possible,&nbsp;including those that Mr Siew Kum Hong talked about, ie, the low-wage workers, contract workers and the self-employed.&nbsp; Minister of State Gan Kim Yong&nbsp;will touch&nbsp;more on&nbsp;these aspects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also want to say that Singapore is not alone&nbsp;in applying this principle of self-provision to provident funds;&nbsp;that you receive amounts proportionate to what you have saved or put in is an established principle of most pension systems,&nbsp;even those which provide defined benefits.&nbsp; For example, if you log on to&nbsp;the US&nbsp;Social Security benefits webpage, let me quote from the website: &ldquo;Higher lifetime earnings result in higher benefits.&nbsp; If there were some years when you did not work or had low earnings, your benefit amount may be lower than if you had worked steadily.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is almost&nbsp;intuitive and sensible. Indeed, that is how pension systems apply this rule.&nbsp; That&nbsp;is why those who do not have enough in their CPF to provide an income for life, will not be automatically included.&nbsp; This is the reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when the compulsory LIFE scheme starts in 2013, as Mr Seng Han Thong says, about 75% to 80% of the first cohort of active members will have sufficient cash in their Minimum Sum of about $40,000, and they will be&nbsp;automatically included in CPF LIFE.&nbsp; But because of the extra 1% interest earned on the first $60,000, subsequent cohorts to that will have more, and we expect <p align=left>Column: 1999<p>that,&nbsp;over time, almost all active members will be&nbsp;included into CPF LIFE.&nbsp; But even for those with less than $40,000, we want to encourage them to opt in, as well as for those who are older than 50 this year, and I will talk about that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Life Bonus (L-Bonus) has indeed been structured to be generous to encourage opt-ins. &nbsp;Those who opt in must be willing to receive monthly incomes lower than those who are automatically included, but they will have the assurance that this will last for as long as they live.&nbsp; We have&nbsp;lowered significantly the threshold amount.&nbsp; From $40,000, we have lowered it to&nbsp;$20,000, ie, by half,&nbsp;for eligible members to receive the full L-Bonus, up to $4,000.&nbsp; Those&nbsp;lower than $20,000, we are allowing them to come in.&nbsp; We want them to come in, but they&nbsp;will get a&nbsp;pro-rated L-bonus.&nbsp; I think it is fair.&nbsp; But at $20,000 and beyond, they can get up to the full L-Bonus of $4,000.&nbsp; The message underlying the L-Bonus, the way it is structured,&nbsp;is very&nbsp;clear - CPF LIFE is a good scheme that provides for your old age, and the Government is providing incentives to get as many as possible to opt in, even if they are not automatically included.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The introduction of CPF LIFE will help CPF members to better provide for their own retirement.&nbsp; This is good, as members of the public have said.&nbsp; But during the Committee's deliberations - some of you can ask Mr Seng Han Thong who is on the Committee, including other unionists - the Committee and other&nbsp;members of the public said they were concerned about&nbsp;this aspect, that we should not&nbsp;oversell CPF LIFE because they were fearful that it will undermine family support for the elderly.&nbsp;&nbsp;It must not give rise to the wrong impression that the responsibility of children or family members to help each other is diminished.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2000<p>Family members must continue to play a key role in looking after the elderly and each other.&nbsp; This is a value that we must reinforce, not diminish.&nbsp; This is why, in tandem with the introduction of CPF LIFE, we further liberalise the Minimum Sum Topping-Up Scheme.&nbsp; This year&rsquo;s measures come close to the enhancements that I announced&nbsp;last year.&nbsp; Last year, we raised the prevailing limit.&nbsp; It was previously very low and I said that we can raise it up to the current Minimum Sum (MS), and it will keep going up as the MS goes up.&nbsp; The results of last year's measures have been&nbsp;encouraging.&nbsp; If we compare 2006 to&nbsp;2007, the&nbsp;number of&nbsp; top-up applications increased by two and a half times, while the total amount of top-ups&nbsp;increased by almost three times,&nbsp;to $44 million, up from $15 million.&nbsp; This year, we will make further enhancements to the schemes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All in all, the new rules make topping up simple and with added incentives,&nbsp;more will be able to receive top-ups, and those who top up for others can receive incentives.&nbsp; Let me make it simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, you can top up more each year.&nbsp; Cash top-ups to the Minimum Sum will no longer be subject to annual caps.&nbsp; Previously, it was about $26,000.&nbsp; Note that it is to the full MS, which means that you can top up up to $99,000 this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, for cash top-ups, we will remove restrictions on age and specific family relationships.&nbsp; Now, more people, including extended family members, will be able to make cash top-ups to members above or below age 55. &nbsp;Cash top-ups will also enjoy enhanced tax relief.&nbsp; Cash top-ups by a member or his employer can enjoy up to $7,000 tax relief per year.&nbsp; In addition, if the member makes cash top-ups to his family members, he can receive up to an additional $7,000 tax relief a year.&nbsp; To facilitate, I have asked the CPF Board to&nbsp;step up its communication efforts to encourage members to top up <p align=left>Column: 2001<p>their relatives' CPF. &nbsp; These changes will take effect from 1st November 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 1st November 2008, employers will also be allowed to make cash top-ups to their employees' Minimum Sum and they can&nbsp;enjoy a full tax deduction.&nbsp; The message from the L-Bonus,&nbsp;the liberalisation of the top-up rules is again simple and clear - family members who can afford to, should support one another.&nbsp; We strongly encourage husbands to top up the accounts of their spouses.&nbsp; This is a year of Budget and COS that&nbsp;all the Ministers encourage their husbands to top up the accounts of their spouses, so I am adding my&nbsp;voice to it as well.&nbsp; Mr Khaw Boon Wan said it for Medisave.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, I am encouraging husbands to top up the other accounts of their spouses.&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are&nbsp;incentives in my encouragement, and the incentives are great.&nbsp; Let me give you an example.&nbsp; If a husband at age 55 tops up his 50-year-old spouse's account by $20,000.&nbsp; Here, we see Mrs Tan who is not working now but has $8,000 in the CPF in 2008.&nbsp; Mr Tan, the husband, tops up $20,000 in her account.&nbsp; If he uses cash, the first thing is that he will have up to $1,400 in tax savings.&nbsp; But if he tops up $20,000 so that Mrs Tan has $28,000 at age 50, the effects are dramatic.&nbsp; Five years later, Mrs Tan will not have $28,000.&nbsp; His wife will have $40,000.&nbsp; It is a jump of $12,000 in&nbsp;five years - $8,000 in additional interest earned, and $4,000 from the L-Bonus.&nbsp; If Mr Tan had kept that $20,000 in his account, because the extra 1% is capped at $60,000, he loses that 1%.&nbsp; If he transfers $20,000 from his CPF to his wife, there is an additional $200 a year in additional interest.&nbsp; So, $28,000 at 50, at age 55, you can join the CPF LIFE scheme, and at age 65, Mrs Tan can look forward to $360 a month, for life.&nbsp; And she will have a total gain of CPF interest, plus L-Bonus of nearly $10,000.&nbsp; So, if the husband tops up $20,000, the Government is, in effect, matching the top up by <p align=left>Column: 2002<p>$10,000.&nbsp; We are adding a plea for spouses to top up your spouses' CPF and get more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now&nbsp;address&nbsp;the specific concerns about CPF LIFE which have been raised.&nbsp; Many people have asked, and&nbsp;I know some Members have expressed that it is a bit confusing, the 12 options, and many people have asked \"What do&nbsp;I do now? &nbsp; I do not fully understand&nbsp;the scheme&nbsp;but, from what I hear and read, it seems to be good, so what do I do?\"&nbsp; My general assurance to all Singaporeans is this - do not worry.&nbsp; You actually do not need&nbsp;to do anything,&nbsp;if you are younger than 55, except work and contribute to your CPF, of course.&nbsp; I think that is a good piece of advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the time comes for you to join CPF LIFE, the CPF Board will contact you and help you. &nbsp;But let me&nbsp;sketch out&nbsp;how the scheme will affect different broad groups, and provide some details.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we said, in 2013, the scheme starts.&nbsp; For those who are 50 and below this year will automatically be included, if they have $40,000 and above.&nbsp; Those aged 51&nbsp;to 54 now, they can opt in when they reach 55.&nbsp; The CPF Board will contact them then and facilitate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For members aged 55 and above this year, we will give them ample time to opt in, a year or more.&nbsp; For those who can benefit from CPF LIFE, again, the CPF Board will contact them and provide them the necessary information and opportunities to opt in.&nbsp; All those who meet the eligibility criteria and opt in will receive L-Bonuses.&nbsp; This will increase their CPF funds and monthly payouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have fed back that CPF LIFE is complicated.&nbsp; So to make it easy to understand, let me have another go.&nbsp; You only need to remember three things, not 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, CPF LIFE guarantees you an <p align=left>Column: 2003<p>income for life.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will&nbsp;start from 65 and after age 65, the drawdown age will be for life, for as long as you live. &nbsp;Second, the Minimum Sum will always be returned to you, and the unused sum will go to your beneficiaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, if you want a higher income from CPF LIFE, you can do so by putting more into CPF LIFE which means at least less for beneficiaries.&nbsp; I think that is simple enough.&nbsp; Three key points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of you will say,&nbsp;what does that mean?&nbsp; It means that at age 55, all members automatically included will be put into the&nbsp;Standard Plan. Let me explain to you how it works.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken Mr Seng Han Thong's example and made a slide now called \"The Standard Plan\".&nbsp; There is no more refund or&nbsp;non-refundable, which is confusing.&nbsp; The Standard Plan provides a balance between what the member receives each month for life and how much he wants to leave&nbsp;for his beneficiaries.&nbsp; It is as simple as that.&nbsp; It is a balance.&nbsp; For those who want to&nbsp;choose higher income plans, they want more from their CPF LIFE, they want a higher income than what they can get in the Standard Plan, they can do so but they&nbsp;may leave&nbsp;less for their beneficiaries.&nbsp; Or they can choose lower payouts, or less income,&nbsp;and may leave more for their beneficiaries.&nbsp; For a&nbsp;selected few, there are finally the non-refundable plans which&nbsp;provide even higher payouts but it may leave the least for your beneficiaries.&nbsp; It is quite easy to understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will happen when a member in the first cohort reaches 55 in 2013?&nbsp;&nbsp; I have given you a general example.&nbsp; Let me give you a specific example.&nbsp; Someone who has $67,000 in his Minimum Sum.&nbsp; At age 55, he is automatically put on the Standard Plan.&nbsp; He will get $610 a month for life.&nbsp; But that person may say, \"Well, $610 is not enough.&nbsp; I want more.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;You can go up to $650, more for life but at <p align=left>Column: 2004<p>least less for your beneficiaries because you are putting more into it - some of it is a non-refund plan - but you just basically put more into&nbsp;CPF LIFE.&nbsp; The others will say, \"I don't really need so much income.&nbsp; I want to leave more for my children.\"&nbsp; You just choose one of the lower income which leaves more for your beneficiaries.&nbsp; It is quite easy to understand.&nbsp; The CPF Board will provide essential and personalised information to each member when he reaches 55.&nbsp; They will be told how much he or she has in their Minimum Sum and placed&nbsp;under the Standard Plan and&nbsp;how much they will receive for life.&nbsp; Any unused amount remaining in their Minimum Sum will be returned to the beneficiaries when the members pass away.&nbsp; If the member wants, he/she can choose the other options - which include&nbsp;no refund, so they get a higher payout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to educate members on LIFE plans.&nbsp; I am sure this will not be the last time,&nbsp;and we will continue to reiterate so that people can understand.&nbsp; The CPF Board will&nbsp;step up its communications effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions have been asked about how the self-employed (SE) and low wage workers (LWW) can save enough to be included into CPF LIFE.&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Siew Kum Hong asked: what about those who do not qualify?&nbsp; What is the Government planning to do?&nbsp; Do we help cope with their needs in their old age?&nbsp; Other Members have also asked this - Mr Zainudin Nordin, Dr Amy Khor, Mr Ang Mong Seng, Prof. Mehta, Dr Lim Wee Kiak.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State Gan Kim Yong&nbsp;will elaborate&nbsp;on&nbsp;specific efforts in helping low wage workers and self-employed persons for CPF contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to make one or two points here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point out that we have in place measures to help these low wage workers,&nbsp;self-employed and contract workers to build up their CPF balances.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2005<p>Firstly, Workfare will contribute up to 20% of a worker's wages into his CPF.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a significant help.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me explain to you how big an impact it is.&nbsp; I will not choose somebody in the 50th percentile.&nbsp; I will choose somebody with the 10th percentile wage earner who earns $900&nbsp;a month.&nbsp; You agree that that is a reasonable starting point to help those who are low wage workers.&nbsp; Mr Harun, say,&nbsp;at age 40 today, he earns $900 a month.&nbsp; Let us say he has&nbsp;combined in his Ordinary and Savings Accounts of about $15,000 and he continues to work till 65 and contributes regularly.&nbsp; How much do you think he will have at age 55, 15 years later?&nbsp; $20,000 or&nbsp;$30,000?&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; He will have $71,000 in his Retirement Account.&nbsp; This is in effect&nbsp;steady contributions to CPF.&nbsp; And with the Workfare Income Supplement, he will have $82,000 in his Retirement Account.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My point is, at age 65, if we help him to&nbsp;continue to work, he will have $107,000 in his Retirement Account and $122,000 in his Retirement Account with Workfare.&nbsp; It is a substantial help that we are giving to low wage workers.&nbsp; But we are saying that he must continue to try to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that a wrong message?&nbsp; Do you prefer a message which says, \"I will take care of your needs.&nbsp; Unconditional assistance.\"&nbsp; Can you deliver?&nbsp; Can you have a system that provides that?&nbsp; So it is much safer.&nbsp; I think the better message to articulate is that, yes, you do your part, but Government will help and help substantially.&nbsp; So even if he uses a sum of money to buy a home, this takes into account that he does not use any of it to buy a home.&nbsp; But even if he uses half of it and with the additional housing grant, he can still own a home and half of that $40,000 in his Retirement Account to have an income under CPF LIFE for as long as he lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also want to add that since 2001, we have helped this group and others <p align=left>Column: 2006<p>substantially.&nbsp; Since 2001,&nbsp;including the GST Offset package, special transfers,&nbsp;the Government has contributed a total of nearly&nbsp;$12 billion to members and&nbsp;to citizen residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some have talked about housewives.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, I encourage spouses to top up for their housewives, and this is why we have structured the L-Bonus as such.&nbsp; For the disabled, I take that there are&nbsp;other employment assistance schemes, such as the Open Door Fund and the Enabling Employers under MCYS.&nbsp; But my main point is, let us not mix the two.&nbsp; CPF LIFE is for those who have put enough into their own CPF and we need the other schemes to help the others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim asked about inflation in CPF LIFE.&nbsp; She is quite right.&nbsp; It is not&nbsp;inflation indexed.&nbsp; In fact, Prof. Lim's Committee struggled at length because it makes sense if you can have a payout that rises, so that your purchasing power is not diluted.&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it hard to make the distinction between the Ministry and the Committee making this wide consultation because we appointed the Committee to make wide consultation.&nbsp; But the point is they had wide consultation.&nbsp; The feedback was this.&nbsp; If you have inflation index, it means smaller amounts from the beginning and larger amounts when you are older.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many members of the public said they were&nbsp;concerned that they would not live long enough to receive the later amounts.&nbsp; So the Committee was practical and they say, \"Let's just have it flat because the Minimum Sum scheme is flat.\"&nbsp; I think it is a sensible proposal.&nbsp; There are of course other ways to increase your income later in&nbsp;life.&nbsp; One good&nbsp;example is&nbsp;the HDB Lease Buy-Back Scheme which tops up the stream of income that you get from CPF LIFE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim also asked about&nbsp;sustainability.&nbsp; She is right.&nbsp; Prof. Lim Pin's Committee was very careful to say that <p align=left>Column: 2007<p>payouts must be based on how long&nbsp;people are actually living and the interest rates.&nbsp; Because to be financially viable, payouts and premiums&nbsp;must correspond to actual interest rates and mortality experience.&nbsp; This is a universal rule that is applied for all insurance and annuity providers.&nbsp; It is nothing new.&nbsp; If you read the report, Prof. Lim Pin's Committee specifically noted the example of Equitable Life in the UK -&nbsp;I have circulated that - for a company that made promises, that they could not deliver and did no one any good.&nbsp; It is easy to make promises, in other words.&nbsp; It is easy to say, \"I will give you this.\"&nbsp; But&nbsp;if I ask you,&nbsp;\"how are you going to pay for it?&nbsp; Will you be around to make sure that you stick to your commitment?&nbsp; And what if you cannot?&nbsp; What service have you done?\"&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you say</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CPF LIFE, everybody jumps on board.&nbsp; It is a wonderful safety net.&nbsp; You do not have to bring in your rope.&nbsp; When the net breaks, what happens?&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we want to be very careful.&nbsp; It will be subsumed under the CPF interest framework which guarantees 3.5% for less than $60,000.&nbsp; Beyond this, the payouts will be paid based on actual interest rates and mortality experience.&nbsp; This is in line with standard practice of annuity providers to ensure that CPF LIFE remains adequately funded and sustainable over the long term.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is hard to predict how the 10-year Singapore Government Securities (SGS) will perform.&nbsp; We talked about this during the CPF debate.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a substantial debate and&nbsp;most of us were here,&nbsp;it was a few days of debate, and many of the Members&nbsp;debated.&nbsp; We said at that time that 10-year SGS&nbsp;performed over 4% historically.&nbsp; We cannot predict it in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to historical expectations, I think it will be&nbsp;above 4%, which means that the guaranteed 1% will be above 5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2008<p> Prof. Mehta suggested that CPF contribution rates of workers aged 50-55 be reviewed.&nbsp; Let me just say that I have no intention of being anti-family, against social gerontology on ages.&nbsp; We introduce this to help older workers remain employable because of our seniority-based wage system.&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked for empirical evidence that it helps.&nbsp; I do not know whether it is empirical.&nbsp; But the employment rate&nbsp;for workers&nbsp;aged 50 to 54 has risen, from&nbsp;68% in 2002 to 75% in 2007.&nbsp; So it is a significant jump.&nbsp; But Prof. Mehta&nbsp;did not mention one point that we did not take away. &nbsp;The Workfare Income Supplement&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>pays up to $2,400 a year and 25% of wages, and the Workfare Income Supplement increases as you grow older.&nbsp; So am I an ageist if I do that?&nbsp; It is just being practical.&nbsp; We recognise that you are fixed with a formula that we inherited from whoever that when you grow older and&nbsp;your wages go up, the employers find it harder and less motivated to hire older workers.&nbsp; So let me just categorically say that it was not discrimination against older workers.&nbsp; It was to help them increase their employability and the figure tells me it has, whether it has been&nbsp;due to the economy or due to the reduction in the CPF rates, maybe both.&nbsp; But whatever it is, our Workfare Income Supplement tops up, and in a majority of cases more than makes up&nbsp;for their reduction in CPF.&nbsp; I also want to add that our CPF top-ups usually are more for older people as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Lee Bee Wah asked&nbsp;if we could allow CPF members to&nbsp;use CPF funds to fund their own part-time tertiary education.&nbsp; I understand the merits.&nbsp; I believe that education elevates and delivers. But as the Minister who is also looking after your old age needs for CPF, I have to ensure that there are enough CPF savings for old age.&nbsp; So there are trade-offs.&nbsp; When I look at&nbsp;how much longer Singaporeans are living, how much more rapidly ageing our population is, I think we keep to the current position.&nbsp; Do not liberalise it further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2009<p>Part-time students are likely to be working adults so that they would be able to&nbsp;pay their tuition fees. I think MOE and the Finance Minister has announced liberalisation for use in certain courses.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Mr Seng Han Thong asked about CPF investments.&nbsp; If I heard rightly, he said there are some people who will forgo the extra 1% on the $20,000.&nbsp; We have not factored that in.&nbsp; We can consider it, but our basic proposal was that if we pay 3.5%, it is to be treated as a long-term fund, because 3.5% is even more than the 20-year SGS currently.&nbsp; So, we should treat it as long-term money and not short-term funds to be used for investments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, recent changes in our CPF system, especially the CPF LIFE, have put us in a much stronger position to address the challenges of our population.&nbsp; We now have a more robust system, and the challenge is to get as many people on board as possible to enhance retirement sums.&nbsp; With the extra 1% interest on the first $60,000 and the introduction of CPF LIFE, there is even greater benefit for Singaporeans to contribute to and grow their CPF savings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members&nbsp;and employers can play a part by&nbsp;top-ups. &nbsp;Husbands can top up their spouses' CPF.&nbsp; So, I urge all working Singaporeans to regularly contribute to their CPF, and for family members who can afford it, to top up the CPF of their loved ones.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seng Han Thong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

He is so happy because he said that the environment is good, his wages are good and his supervisor is very kind.&nbsp; In the last one or two years, I find that more and more old people are working.&nbsp; They are happy, compared to two or three years ago when we were debating whether old people should work.&nbsp; I think there is a large difference.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the secret of our success?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I think it is because of our environment.&nbsp; Second, as the Minister said, we emphasise the importance of encouraging and helping the senior people,&nbsp;even though it is only a few hundred dollars.&nbsp; So in order to encourage more older workers to work, besides redesign of the jobs and retaining a certain amount in the CPF, it is important to improve the working environment.&nbsp; Using the example of the toilet at Changi Airport where my relative told me: \"I do not like to go to the coffeeshop toilet in the HDB estates because it is not clean.\"&nbsp; So besides job redesign, we must also redesign and improve the work environment.</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 2047-2048.<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Health (Mr Heng Chee How)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Health (Mr Heng Chee How):</B> Sir, the re-employment of older workers is an imperative for the economy and society because of the manpower shortage and rising longevity.&nbsp; The coming of the re-employment law in 2012 adds further urgency to companies and organisations to make the necessary arrangements.&nbsp; Within the union movement, we have already reached out to some 35% of unionised companies last year, and we are on our way to reaching out to 60% this year.&nbsp; Within those companies that have committed themselves, work also is being done to restructure the hiring and deployment plans so that the employability of these older workers would not be a one-year phenomenon at age 62 or be overly dependent on an ultra-tight labour market.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2011<p>I am not sure what progress there has been in the non-unionised sector.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the less certain economic outlook and the possible lack of urgency on the part of some employers as they focus on immediate-term firefighting, ie, they do not see doing this work to ensure re-employment practices are well managed as a 2008 priority but, perhaps, as something that they can tackle in the year 2011, if they think, then there is a risk that the momentum in this subject will flag.&nbsp; If that is so, then there will be big difficulties later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like MOM to give an update of the status of the progress so far and urge the Government to continue to devote attention and resources to highlight the importance of getting it going and to nudge all employers to work with their unions and employees to put in place sustainable arrangements for different industries and job types as soon as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>ADVANTAGE!&nbsp; Scheme</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the Government's efforts to promote employment, retention and re-employment of mature workers, MOM and WDA have initiated the ADVANTAGE! Scheme.&nbsp; Under the scheme, and subject to fulfilling conditions, a company can receive grants of up to $400,000, and I commend MOM and WDA for initiating the ADVANTAGE! Scheme to give incentive for progress.&nbsp; Clearly, the more attractive the terms and user-friendly the scheme becomes to companies of different sizes and in different industry settings, the faster the take-up.&nbsp; That means that more mature workers across more sectors will benefit earlier in terms of prospects for employment, retention and re-employment.&nbsp; On the ground, there has been some feedback on how the <p align=left>Column: 2012<p>scheme could be further refined to accelerate progress.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, is to introduce more flexibility.&nbsp; Some companies may need pilots in order to gain the confidence to do more.&nbsp; Such companies would hope that the grants can be structured in such a way as to support the conducting of pilots.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, smaller companies find it harder to fulfill the conditions on headcount employment, compared to bigger companies.&nbsp; Yet, as a group, SMEs employ the majority of workers and would have to re-employ them in time to come.&nbsp; Is there a scope to focus on terms that would suit SMEs better?&nbsp; Is it possible for the ADVANTAGE! Scheme's terms to be adapted for SMEs?&nbsp; If not, could there be a small ADVANTAGE! Scheme, for example?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, some companies are running ahead of others in terms of ideas, and so they put in their grant applications.&nbsp; But the application does not amount to $400,000 in the first instance.&nbsp; But there is a current limitation in the sense that a company is allowed to apply once.&nbsp; So, they hope that the company grant cap can be maintained while allowance be made for them to apply more than once.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that MOM can take these suggestions into account as we enhance and refine our efforts to support the employment and re-employment of older workers.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I have argued in this House before, and still stand in firm belief that the chronological age is no indication of a person's psychological, physiological and mental well-being.&nbsp; A person at 62 could <p align=left>Column: 2013<p>still be very healthy in all aspects, and he can expect to live longer if he is actually working.&nbsp; Back then, admittedly, my arguments were not supported by facts and statistics, as they are now with the Prime Minister's National Day Rally Speech.&nbsp; I have challenged the Ministry that the prescription of retirement age at 62 acts as a ceiling to a working person's continual active ageing.&nbsp; Now, I would like to revisit this topic and urge the Ministry to once again consider removing totally, the concept of a prescribed retirement age and allow a person to work as long as he is fit and capable to perform the job duties, regardless of his age.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a psychiatrist, I have often noticed the rapid physical, psychological and mental deterioration the moment a person retires from his work and remains inactive in both physical and social life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if a person continues working past the prescribed retirement age, at the very least, his savings would last longer.&nbsp; He would be happier, as he still keeps in touch with his colleagues everyday he goes to work.&nbsp; He would also be healthier because of the physical activities he does and the challenges he faces day to day.&nbsp; Minister Mentor has said that, if having reached the age of 62, we decide to stop working and enjoy life, we would be making the biggest mistake of our life.&nbsp; Why then&nbsp;should MOM force our citizens to make the biggest mistake of their life by setting an artificial retirement age?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

However, I am concerned with the 100,000 or so low-wage workers who have not signed up for the WIS scheme.&nbsp; I understand that some of these workers may be illiterate and do not understand the mechanics of the scheme.&nbsp; Others may be casual workers or self-employed ones <p align=left>Column: 2014<p>who do not make Medisave contributions because they have difficulty making ends meet and are struggling to finance their day-to-day needs.&nbsp; This includes the group of physically disabled people who work informally in workshops and earn low salaries.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to propose some minor changes to the WIS scheme.&nbsp; I feel that the WIS scheme should be tweaked for lowly-paid casual workers or the self-employed.&nbsp; Currently, these people would have to make a Medisave contribution to have the entire WIS payouts channelled to their CPF Medisave accounts.&nbsp; I would like to suggest that this group of workers have their WIS allocation divided into two portions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, a smaller portion to be disbursed in the form of cash and the remaining bigger portion to be in the form of CPF Medisave contribution.&nbsp; A salary cap could be set for these workers, eg, those earning below $500 or $800 a month.&nbsp; Other factors, like disability, should also be included for qualifying workers.&nbsp; I believe it is important to tweak the system for these workers to incentivise them to continue working and, at the same time, have contributions made to their Medisave accounts.&nbsp; As these people may be too hard pressed for cash, making them contribute to Medisave in order to receive more money in the Medisave accounts hardly seems like an attractive option.&nbsp; This small cash incentive may persuade more to join&nbsp;WIS.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another possibility is to enable grassroots agencies or self-help groups to help with&nbsp;the Medisave contributions of truly needy low-income workers so that they can benefit from the Medisave top-ups.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Sir, the WIS is a good scheme, as it is aimed at motivating and incentivising our low-wage workers to strive hard and be self-reliant.&nbsp; However, <p align=left>Column: 2015<p>for it to be a fair scheme, overtime should be excluded from the computation of the $1,500 income ceiling.&nbsp; Including overtime penalises low-wage workers who work hard, as the harder they work, the faster they will reach the income ceiling.&nbsp; This is unfair to them.&nbsp; It also runs counter to the stated objective of the scheme.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fixed overtime is commonplace in some sectors, such as the security sector, and&nbsp;other sectors starve for workers in a tight labour market.&nbsp; And overtime can constitute a significant portion of the wages, in some cases, even as high as 40% of the total wages.&nbsp; Indeed, if there are two workers working side by side in a company, and one has a good attitude and willingly agrees to do overtime every day, whereas the other is lazy and refuses to do so, then it is unfair that the one who refuses to do overtime will get the WIS, but not the hardworking worker.&nbsp; Therefore, I urge the Minister to consider excluding overtime in computing a $1,500 income ceiling.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Cham Hui Fong (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Cham Hui Fong (Nominated Member):</B> Sir, the much-discussed savings for old age CPF LIFE lies in the fundamental of having a CPF account.&nbsp; 287,000 persons received the first payment in January.&nbsp; Probably we have another 150,000 more to go to ensure that they can come on board the CPF scheme.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask the Ministry how and what more will the Ministry be doing to reach out to this group of people?&nbsp; In fact, many workers today, although they are on the WIS scheme, do not quite understand the mechanics of it, eg, how do we actually calibrate and&nbsp;compute the figures to them?&nbsp; Even the formal low-wage workers that we spoke to do not quite understand the scheme.&nbsp; In most cases, when we talk to the workers, they would not want to come forward to claim for their CPF for <p align=left>Column: 2016<p>fear of&nbsp;losing their jobs.&nbsp; So, in most cases, we engage the manpower agencies, through the help of the end-user companies who are essentially our unionised companies.&nbsp; That proved to be quite effective.&nbsp; Can the Ministry therefore identify all the manpower agencies that we have, check on their compliance on CPF and conduct investigations into these companies and not just act when there are complaints?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the end-user companies have a role to play to ensure that all the workers - whether they are formal or informal workers, as long as they are working in their work premises -&nbsp;are treated fairly, because the fact is&nbsp;that they can outsource the work but they should not outsource their responsibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, on the payment of WIS.&nbsp; We have workers who earn less than $1,200 a month, which qualifies them for&nbsp;WIS.&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that they were paid in January, two months ago.&nbsp; They contribute lesser per month to CPF, but WIS should be enough to offset the reduction.&nbsp; In fact, that has been something that we have been&nbsp;telling them.&nbsp; The good news is&nbsp;not just on overtime payment, which Mdm Halimah mentioned earlier, they got good bonus last year.&nbsp; This particular company paid them three months' bonus.&nbsp; We worked out the annual sum.&nbsp; Including the overtime - leave the overtime that these workers have clocked in - they are unlikely to qualify for the second round of payment in April because their annual salary will exceed $18,000 by a little bit.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

This amounts to about 180,000 workers.&nbsp; Part-time workers also stood at about 100,000.&nbsp; I believe these figures will continue to rise given the increasing trend we are seeing of organisations hiring on contract terms for flexibility as well as the encouragement and the drive for the re-entry of women and older workers into the workforce.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past&nbsp;10 years, women in the workforce have steadily increased from 580,000 in 1997 to 780,000 in 2007, representing a 33% increase.&nbsp; The number of older workers&nbsp;aged&nbsp;50 and above has also increased steadily from 220,000 in 1997 to 470,000 in 2007, representing a&nbsp;100% increase.&nbsp; We will continue to see an increase in the number of older workers as lifespan is projected to increase for Singaporeans and they are expected to live longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these changing demographics and potential increase and demand for contract and part-time employment, what is being done to ensure fair and conducive employment terms for both contract and part-time workers?&nbsp; Are our labour policies for contract and part-time employment updated to ensure that these workers' <p align=left>Column: 2019<p>interests are protected and they stay motivated, their skills upgraded, to ensure increased productivity?&nbsp; I believe that more can be done for both contract and part-time workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you a real example of why I said this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took an existing part-time&nbsp;employment contract from a local organisation which hires quite a large workforce in Singapore.&nbsp; And I was surprised to see that an individual had been working for this organisation for more than 10 years, had been paid the same salary for the last 10 years, no increment,&nbsp;did not benefit from the company's productivity or performance bonuses,&nbsp;although the company had performed very well over the last few years.&nbsp; She&nbsp;also had no reimbursement for medical or hospitalisation cost, although she was paid wages for MC and given hospitalisation leave.&nbsp; She does receive, I think, about $10 per month for medical charges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is representative of the significant proportion of employment&nbsp;terms for part-time&nbsp;workers, we will have challenges ensuring that workers stay motivated and continue to upgrade their skills or to maintain their productivity.&nbsp; So I would like to understand what is being done to encourage and provide the framework for fair employment for part-time employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the increasing trend of&nbsp;organisations hiring on&nbsp;contract terms both for lower wages as well as PMETs, how can we ensure that there are fair employment terms, especially for lower wage workers? &nbsp;What can be done to ensure that they have equitable and continuous Medisave and CPF contributions and what measures are put in place to get them to contribute to CPF as well as encourage their employers to contribute?&nbsp;&nbsp;As Minister Ng had said and reiterated just now, what we should do is to&nbsp;ensure that we get as <p align=left>Column: 2020<p>many as possible into the CPF system so that they can benefit from CPF LIFE and WIS, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with contract and part-time workers forming a growing proportion of local employees, will MOM be investing more resources to understand the trends of employment and challenges that these segments face?&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister share with the House if there are plans to do this, so that it is possible to understand the right level of support that is needed for this group of workers?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While contract and part-time workers provide flexibility to both organisations and employees, it can lead to anxieties and frustration for&nbsp;both workers and employers.&nbsp; In order&nbsp;to ensure that we continue to see our workers motivated, we need to ensure that we take care of them.&nbsp; So, Sir, I would like to make a suggestion.&nbsp; I would like to propose that the Ministry provide appropriate focal support for this group of employees and look at how to provide better employment terms for them.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Penal Code also has provisions such as insulting the modesty of a woman, making obscene or lewd acts at women but they do not address the sexual harassment problem at its root cause. There is also other &ldquo;not so noticeable&rdquo; behaviour such as passing lewd or suggestive remarks or using other forms of new media, such as Friendster, Facebook, MSN, SMS and email to sexually harass a woman.

Many of these workers have come to our shore, leaving their loved ones and family behind, to look for employment opportunities. Many of them are also indebted just to come here.&nbsp; They have families to support from the wages they earn here.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, we should ensure that the workplace is safe by enforcing safety procedures at the construction site. Although we have tough laws to ensure workplace safety, such as the Workplace Health and Safety Act, and stiff penalties against errant companies that do not observe good safety procedures at the <p align=left>Column: 2026<p>worksite, we still have a lot of worksite accidents resulting in death. For instance, worksite accidents caused by lifting equipment at workplace have risen to a five-year high in 2007, causing 342 injured and 12 dead. In 2002, the figure was 86 injured and&nbsp;eight killed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that our Manpower Ministry has been working very hard with the industry to train their personnel in the area of workplace safety and to provide co-funding training.&nbsp; Just like what Mr Hawazi said, \"Accidents at the worksite often can be prevented if adequate preparations are made.\"&nbsp; I have noted that worksite accidents are very high in the construction and marine industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we continue to see large numbers of deaths from worksite accidents, I would like to know whether the number of worksite death has been reduced, after the introduction of the Worksite Health and Safety Act to lower industrial accidents. I also note that, with effect from 1st March 2008, MOM has included six more industry sectors, which is good, and I hope that with the inclusion of the six new sectors, worksite safety can be further enhanced.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I also support the Ministry's policy of liberalising foreign worker quotas to address labour shortages, especially in the construction and manufacturing industries.&nbsp; More and more foreign workers are landing on our shores.&nbsp; I wish to urge the Ministry to avoid the ostrich syndrome and ignore the problems related to the influx of the many thousands of foreign workers in Singapore.&nbsp; Sir, not everyone who has grievances in this area is an ugly Singaporean, intolerant of foreign workers.&nbsp; Neither are Singaporeans unappreciative of the Ministry's good work or contributions made by foreign labour to our economy.&nbsp; Many know that foreign workers are also human beings and they need leisure time and place.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I assure Minister that this is not anecdotal and similar problems are also surfacing&nbsp; in other parts of Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I&nbsp;urge the Ministry to take proactive leadership in addressing these issues before the social costs escalate further.&nbsp; Half-hearted multi-agency efforts have failed in the past and&nbsp;more teeth and resolve are required to assure more results.&nbsp; MOM should make a serious effort in assembling and leading relevant agencies such as HDB, commercial sector, town councils, NEA, Police, URA, LTA and SLA, where relevant.&nbsp; We cannot simply rely on volunteer patrol teams or grassroots leaders to solve these problems.&nbsp; The problems are not insurmountable and the appreciation for MOM will be further elevated if we can lead in removing the valid angst caused by the liberal foreign worker policy the Ministry has embarked on.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Ah Heng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
