I would only like to remind him that the\r\n\r\nresults of the elections depend upon those who cast\r\n\r\nvotes themselves. They are human beings who must be\r\n\r\npresent  in  person. And being human  beings,  they\r\n\r\nwill  not  like, without their own consent,  to  be\r\n\r\ntransferred from one electoral district to another.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is not possible at all to fiddle with\r\n\r\nthe  electoral  registers to  anybody's  particular\r\n\r\nadvantage. It is not the electoral registers  which\r\n\r\ndecide victory or defeat for a candidate, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is  the  electorate  themselves  who  make  the\r\n\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Dr Toh Chin Chye]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4><div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS</b></div></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment Bill is being introduced partly in\r\n\r\nthe  light of experience that has been acquired  by\r\n\r\nthe  Elections Office over the past years.  As  the\r\n\r\nlist  of  claimants after the register of  electors\r\n\r\nand Lists A and B have been exhibited to the public\r\n\r\nhas  increased enormously from about 9,000 in  1959\r\n\r\nto  22,500  in 1963, more time is now required  for\r\n\r\nthe  registration  of  these  claimants.  This   is\r\n\r\nprovided for in clause 2 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 proposes an amendment to reduce the\r\n\r\nperiod  between the date of issue of  the  Writ  of\r\n\r\nElection and Nomination Day from nine days to  five\r\n\r\ndays.  I  would like to point out that this  is  in\r\n\r\naccord  with  the  practice in the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nwhere  from the time the Returning Officer receives\r\n\r\nthe  Writ  up to the Day of Nomination, the  period\r\n\r\ncan  be  calculated to be about five days.  In  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom, however, this period of five  days\r\n\r\nis  the maximum and cannot be increased by statute,\r\n\r\nwhereas  in  Singapore the provision which  we  are\r\n\r\nasking  now  of  five days should  be  the  minimum\r\n\r\nperiod  and this period could be increased to  more\r\n\r\nthan five days, if at any time it is desired to  do\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment in clause 4 is consequential to the\r\n\r\namendment in clause 3 if this is accepted. It seeks\r\n\r\nto reduce the period between the publication of the\r\n\r\nNotice  of  Election by the Returning  Officer  and\r\n\r\nNomination Day from five days to four days. This is\r\n\r\nin  line  with the reduction of the period  between\r\n\r\nthe  date  of  issue of the Writ  of  Election  and\r\n\r\nNomination Day as proposed in clause 3. The  number\r\n\r\nof  days  between  the Notice of  Election  by  the\r\n\r\nReturning  Officer  and  Nomination  Day   can   be\r\n\r\ncalculated to be the same as in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt is considered that the publication of the notice\r\n\r\nby  the Returning Officer at least four clear  days\r\n\r\nbefore  Nomination  Day  is  sufficient  notice  to\r\n\r\nprospective candidates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 suggests removing the limitation in the\r\n\r\npresent Ordinance which stipulates that Polling Day\r\n\r\nshall  be  a  Saturday.  There  is,  in  fact,   no\r\n\r\njustification for this limitation at all. There has\r\n\r\nbeen  some doubt as to whether Polling Day being  a\r\n\r\nholiday  should  or  should  not  be  counted   for\r\n\r\npurposes of determining the minimum number of  days\r\n\r\nrequired  between the publication by the  Returning\r\n\r\nOfficer  of  the notice of contested elections  and\r\n\r\nPolling  Day. This amendment is for the purpose  of\r\n\r\nclearing that doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed in clause 6 follow the\r\n\r\nprovision  in  the  National Referendum  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nwhich  are necessary to ensure that on Polling  Day\r\n\r\nthere is no canvassing or undue influence exercised\r\n\r\non  electors who should be allowed to consider  the\r\n\r\nplatform  of  the  various  political  Parties  and\r\n\r\ncandidates   and  vote  according  to  their   best\r\n\r\njudgment and free will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of clause 7 is to prohibit secret\r\n\r\nsociety  gangsters who are under Police Supervision\r\n\r\nOrder from taking part in any election activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 8 empowers the Returning Officer\r\n\r\nto  use  free  of charge as a Polling  Station  any\r\n\r\nschool  or portion thereof for the purposes of  any\r\n\r\nelection.  In  the past it has been found  that  on\r\n\r\noccasions  persons  who  were  in  charge  of   the\r\n\r\npremises of certain private\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools  were  reluctant  to  allow  the  Returning\r\n\r\nOfficer  to  use  the schools as polling  stations.\r\n\r\nAlthough   the  amendment  empowers  the  Returning\r\n\r\nOfficer  to  use such schools as polling  stations,\r\n\r\nthe  power  will not be exercised except in  places\r\n\r\nwhere  no other suitable building or place where  a\r\n\r\ntemporary  building could be erected can be  found.\r\n\r\nThis  applies mainly to the crowded city area where\r\n\r\nit   is  difficult  to  find  suitable  alternative\r\n\r\nbuildings  or vacant sites for temporary  buildings\r\n\r\nto serve as polling stations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  in regard  to  this  Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly  Elections  (Amendment)  Bill\r\n\r\nintroduced by the P.A.P. I have great doubts as  to\r\n\r\nthe  true  practice of parliamentary  democracy.  I\r\n\r\nfear that they want to resort to legal means to put\r\n\r\ninto effect their dictatorial measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of democracy is still being limited by\r\n\r\nthis  Bill. Originally the period between the issue\r\n\r\nof  Writ  of Elections and Nomination Day was  nine\r\n\r\ndays.  It  is  now the desire of the Government  to\r\n\r\nreduce  it to five days. To the Party in power,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,   there   will   be   no   difficulty    or\r\n\r\ninconvenience, but to the Opposition Parties  there\r\n\r\nwill  be great difficulty and hardship because  all\r\n\r\nthe  disadvantages of the reduction of  the  period\r\n\r\nfall on the Opposition Parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Writ of Elections is issued by the Party in\r\n\r\npower,  and not by any Opposition Party. Therefore,\r\n\r\nonly the Party in power know when they are going to\r\n\r\nissue  the Writ. So their intention is not  to  let\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  know  or to have  enough  time  to\r\n\r\nprepare  for elections. Even in the recent  general\r\n\r\nelections, the period was nine days from Nomination\r\n\r\nDay  to  Polling Day. So the total period would  be\r\n\r\ntwo  weeks  from the issue of Writ of Elections  to\r\n\r\nPolling   Day.   This  period  of  two   weeks   is\r\n\r\ninsufficient  to  Opposition Parties  because  they\r\n\r\nhave to carry out election work,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch as printing publicity material, the choice  of\r\n\r\ncandidates  and election campaigning.  But  to  the\r\n\r\nParty in power this is not so, because they know it\r\n\r\nin  advance. I heard that publicity and  propaganda\r\n\r\nmaterial had, long before the general election  was\r\n\r\nheld,  been  printed in Hong Kong. They  are  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to know the date of any pending  election\r\n\r\nand   could  take  advantage  of  it.  We  in   the\r\n\r\nOpposition do not have that advantage. We  are  put\r\n\r\nat  a  disadvantage. Of course, the Party in  power\r\n\r\ncan  argue that they have fighters and that we  too\r\n\r\nhave  fighters. Therefore, they say it is fair.  In\r\n\r\nactual fact, it is not so. The Party in power is in\r\n\r\ncontrol  of all publicity and propaganda machinery.\r\n\r\nThey can, therefore, carry on a propaganda campaign\r\n\r\non  a  long-term basis for the elections.  They  do\r\n\r\nthis,  of course, through the Press, the radio  and\r\n\r\ntelevision.  Their candidates will not be  arrested\r\n\r\nby  anybody.  The  Party in power can  abuse  their\r\n\r\npower  by arresting prospective candidates who  are\r\n\r\nin  the  Opposition.  There is clear  and  concrete\r\n\r\nevidence  to  show  this. Many of  our  prospective\r\n\r\ncandidates  were  arrested  prior  to  the  general\r\n\r\nelections.  This  caused great  difficulty  to  our\r\n\r\nParty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. can, of course, argue that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have still afforded us the  opportunity\r\n\r\nand   facilities  to  take  part  in  the   general\r\n\r\nelections,  and that we are free to carry  on  with\r\n\r\nour  propaganda  work  like  the  holding  of  mass\r\n\r\nrallies.   But   we   are   only   afforded    such\r\n\r\nopportunities  during  the  period  of  nine   days\r\n\r\nallowed   to   us.   We  are  not   afforded   such\r\n\r\nopportunities or facilities on other days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of this Bill is this. Clause 6\r\n\r\ngives  strong powers to the police. This  provision\r\n\r\nis  similar  to  the one in the Singapore  National\r\n\r\nReferendum Ordinance of 1962. This clause  provides\r\n\r\nthat  no  person  can, on Polling  Day,  enter  two\r\n\r\nhouses  or  places of work of the electors  in  the\r\n\r\nsame polling district other than his own home. If\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  is  seen  doing that, he will be committing  an\r\n\r\noffence  under the provisions of this Bill,  unless\r\n\r\nhe  can  prove to the contrary. It also  gives  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Police very great powers in dealing\r\n\r\nwith these matters. The police can enter and search\r\n\r\nany   premises   or  place  for  the   purpose   of\r\n\r\nascertaining  whether  such  an  offence  is  being\r\n\r\ncommitted.  The P.A.P. may abuse these powers  when\r\n\r\napplying   these   provisions.   People   will   be\r\n\r\nintimidated. This provision will create fear in the\r\n\r\nelectors.  When we consider all the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill, we can see that Polling Day will  be  a\r\n\r\nday  of  terror when these rules are applied.  This\r\n\r\nwill  be  so  if  we  take into  consideration  the\r\n\r\nprovisions in clause 3. For instance, a hawker will\r\n\r\nhe prohibited from carrying on his trade on Polling\r\n\r\nDay  according  to the provisions of  this  clause.\r\n\r\nThis  is  because he is not allowed to  enter  more\r\n\r\nthan two houses. Even those people who want to call\r\n\r\non  their friends will be committing an offence  if\r\n\r\nthey do so. Hawkers and shop assistants who wish to\r\n\r\ndeliver  their goods will have to enter  more  than\r\n\r\ntwo  houses, but this will be construed  as  having\r\n\r\ncommitted  an  offence.  Nobody  will  dare  to  go\r\n\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, it is the practice of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to   intimidate  and  coerce  people,   by\r\n\r\npropaganda  and other means, saying  that  if  they\r\n\r\ncarry  on  certain  activities  or  take  part   in\r\n\r\nelection campaigns, they will be arrested. There is\r\n\r\nthus  an  atmosphere of terror.  There  will  be  a\r\n\r\nreduction in the period from nine days to five days\r\n\r\nin  regard to the period between the issue  of  the\r\n\r\nWrit  of  Elections and Nomination Day. We can  see\r\n\r\nfrom   this   whether  or  not   the   P.A.P. are\r\n\r\ndictatorial.  This  shows  that  the  P.A.P. have\r\n\r\nignored the principles of democracy in the interest\r\n\r\nof  the Party. I think democracy is the monopoly of\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P.   They   can  pass  unreasonable   and\r\n\r\nundemocratic  laws in this House. After  that  they\r\n\r\nimplement the laws outside this Assembly. They then\r\n\r\nturn  round and say that they are doing  things  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the laws passed in this House. As a\r\n\r\nmatter  of fact, they are doing things contrary  to\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprinciples  of  democracy. This is not  justice  as\r\n\r\nembodied in the term \"democracy\". If they  want  to\r\n\r\nachieve their aim by this kind of legislation, then\r\n\r\nI  advise  them to introduce a Bill in  this  House\r\n\r\nwhereby they can deprive others of any right.  They\r\n\r\nhave  a majority in this House. They can also  turn\r\n\r\nround  and say that they have that right under  the\r\n\r\nlaw. If they wish to be so undemocratic, they might\r\n\r\nas  well  pass a law to say that the victims  of  a\r\n\r\nrobbery are guilty and the robbers are innocent. It\r\n\r\nis  entirely wrong in principle for the  P.A.P. to\r\n\r\nlegislate  laws  from the point of  view  of  their\r\n\r\nParty's interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, I believe you will agree with me that\r\n\r\nan  election  is a special feature in a  democratic\r\n\r\ncountry.  It  is  a peaceful method  by  which  the\r\n\r\npeople  can  express  their wish.  The  people  can\r\n\r\ndecide  the  future  of their country  through  the\r\n\r\nballot  box. I would like to tell the Back-benchers\r\n\r\nthat  whether  the Opposition Members  have  enough\r\n\r\ntime  for propaganda or not does not depend on  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of days allowed for electioneering. Whether\r\n\r\na  candidate of the Opposition is good or bad  will\r\n\r\ndepend on what he has done in the past. A candidate\r\n\r\ncannot  convince the people that he is good  during\r\n\r\nthe few days allowed for electioneering. Whether he\r\n\r\nis good or bad will depend on what he has done over\r\n\r\na long period of time. They have complained that we\r\n\r\nhave  not given them enough time to carry out their\r\n\r\nelection  campaign in the rural  areas.  Voting  is\r\n\r\nsecret  and the choice of a candidate is determined\r\n\r\nin  a  free  manner. There is no humbug  about  it.\r\n\r\nNobody  can  force another person  to  vote  for  a\r\n\r\ncertain candidate. If one says that the voters  can\r\n\r\nbe made use of during the election to bring victory\r\n\r\nto  another Party, then I say, in my view, this  is\r\n\r\nimpossible. Nobody will ever be used or will  agree\r\n\r\nto  any  interference of their freedom.  Canvassing\r\n\r\nactually is a method by which interference of  this\r\n\r\nnature  is  effected. This was done by the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis during the last election. That is why they\r\n\r\nwere able to win a few seats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir  own  candidates had to resort to  canvassing\r\n\r\nand  other  illegal means. For example, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bukit  Merah  had not intended  to  stand  for\r\n\r\nelection in his constituency. But a few days before\r\n\r\nNomination  Day,  a  few  leading  figures  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis were sent to his house in order to\r\n\r\npersuade  him to stand for election. They  promised\r\n\r\nhim  certain conditions in the event of  a  Barisan\r\n\r\nvictory. They threatened him by saying that  should\r\n\r\nhe  refuse  to stand for election, his position  in\r\n\r\nNanyang University would be made untenable. This is\r\n\r\nwhat  they did. I personally feel that if we really\r\n\r\nwant  to  safeguard the democratic system  and  the\r\n\r\nrights  of the people, then we must give sufficient\r\n\r\npowers  to  the  police to protect the  rights  and\r\n\r\nsecurity  of  the  people. But the Communists  will\r\n\r\nalways  make  use  of  the  democratic  system   to\r\n\r\nundermine  the system itself. That is to say,  they\r\n\r\nare  making use of democracy to undermine democracy\r\n\r\nitself. We hope that through the provisions of this\r\n\r\nBill,   the  true  spirit  of  democracy  will   be\r\n\r\nsafeguarded  and maintained. This will ensure  that\r\n\r\nthose who act foolishly and in the dark will not be\r\n\r\nable to do so again in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  we have different kinds of elections.  We\r\n\r\nhave  democratic  elections as well  as  dirty  and\r\n\r\nfilthy  elections.  There are elections  which  are\r\n\r\ncarried  out  fairly  and  justly  and  there   are\r\n\r\nelections  which  are  rigged.  [Interruption]  The\r\n\r\nMember for Jalan Besar does not know of a story  of\r\n\r\na  King who was elected by the people. I will  tell\r\n\r\nhim.

Does the Member know about this? If he  does\r\n\r\nnot  know  it,  he should go and read  his  history\r\n\r\nbooks.

But it does not mean that an election is\r\n\r\nand can represent the true spirit of democracy.  If\r\n\r\nan  election  is  conducted fairly and  justly,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  cannot deny that it  is  a  democratic\r\n\r\nelection.  But if an election is done in  a  filthy\r\n\r\nway  and  is  a  humbug, then it is  a  dictatorial\r\n\r\nelection. So one must not say that because  in  the\r\n\r\nlast general election the P.A.P. obtained 37 seats,\r\n\r\nthen it must be a democratic election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a peaceful election and a violent\r\n\r\nelection.  I  think they had better  listen  to  me\r\n\r\ncarefully  and  quietly.  What  is  the  difference\r\n\r\nbetween a violent election and a peaceful election?\r\n\r\nMy friends opposite must pay attention to what I am\r\n\r\ngoing  to  say. If you have basic common  knowledge\r\n\r\nand  common  sense,  you will recall  that  in  the\r\n\r\nrecent  elections in South Korea and Japan,  voters\r\n\r\nwere forced to take part in the elections, and many\r\n\r\nof  them  were slaughtered and killed in these  two\r\n\r\nplaces.   Here  in  Singapore,  similar   incidents\r\n\r\noccurred  in  which Barisan Sosialis  workers  were\r\n\r\nassaulted.   Can  you  say  this  was  a   peaceful\r\n\r\nelection?  Can  you  say  it  was  conducted  in  a\r\n\r\npeaceful  manner? There should be  an  election  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  voters can express their views  freely.\r\n\r\nBut  in certain circumstances force was used on the\r\n\r\nvoters.  Violence too was used. So  let  them  stop\r\n\r\ntalking  about the last election and claim that  it\r\n\r\nwas  a peaceful election. I must say that the  last\r\n\r\nelection and future elections will not be conducted\r\n\r\nfreely   because  of  the  number   of   days   for\r\n\r\ncampaigning which has been reduced from 9 to 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference was made about the Member for Bukit\r\n\r\nMerah.

That is the kind of country that  he\r\n\r\nadmires. I should remind him that there is only one\r\n\r\nParty  candidate  and no one  else.  But  maybe  he\r\n\r\nprefers  that  one. When they talk about  elections\r\n\r\nbeing  undemocratic and so on, well, for propaganda\r\n\r\npurposes,  it is all right. But when  it  comes  to\r\n\r\nactual  fact,  when  they were  talking  about  the\r\n\r\ndefeat of Mr Lee Khoon Choy in Bukit Panjang, they\r\n\r\nnever  said  a  word  that the  last  election  was\r\n\r\nundemocratic.

If he\r\n\r\nthinks that being a shop assistant he can get  away\r\n\r\nfrom  this  part of the Bill, where policemen  will\r\n\r\nnot  allow  a man to go to more than two  or  three\r\n\r\nplaces  on  canvassing day, well, he  can  disguise\r\n\r\nhimself as a shop assistant and get away with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last election, the complaint was that\r\n\r\nthe  number of days for campaigning was  too  short\r\n\r\nand all the rest of it, but I am sure that if there\r\n\r\nwere  more time, if we were able to refute some  of\r\n\r\nthe  statements  that Mr Tan Lark  Sye  had  said,\r\n\r\nperhaps  some of these gentlemen would  not  be  in\r\n\r\nthis Chamber today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, I feel this amendment Bill is full  of\r\n\r\nthe  spirit of democracy. As a matter of fact,  the\r\n\r\naim of the amendment will act in the same manner on\r\n\r\nthe  Party  in  power as well as on the  Opposition\r\n\r\nParties. The reduction of nine days to five days is\r\n\r\nto  enable officers of the Elections Department  to\r\n\r\nprepare  themselves for Nomination Day. It  is  not\r\n\r\nour  intention  to  make use of the  provisions  to\r\n\r\nrestrict   the  activities  of  all  the  political\r\n\r\nParties  in their contact with the electorate.  No,\r\n\r\nit  is  not our intention. If the Barisan can claim\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  the support of the  broad  masses\r\n\r\nbehind them, then why should they be afraid of when\r\n\r\nand  where election is to be conducted? Why  should\r\n\r\nthey  be afraid and worry about the number of  days\r\n\r\nallowed for campaigning? They just cannot say  that\r\n\r\nthere is no democracy because the number of days is\r\n\r\nreduced. If they claim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  they are the heroes of the people,  they  are\r\n\r\nthe  representatives of the people,  they  have  no\r\n\r\nreason  to  fear at all. But it is surprising  that\r\n\r\ntheir remarks against this Bill show that they  are\r\n\r\npaper  tigers and paper heroes. They really do  not\r\n\r\nhave  the  support of the people, and that  is  why\r\n\r\nthey  are afraid of this Bill, which will give  the\r\n\r\nGovernment the power to hold elections at any time.\r\n\r\nThen they will be afraid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as I have said just now, this amendment Bill is full of the spirit of democracy, because we have no intention and desire to restrict the opportunities of the Opposition Members to come into contact with the electorate. In the last five years of our office, we have given them\r\n\r\nopportunities to come into contact with the people.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  they did make use of these opportunities\r\n\r\nto  spread  rumours  among the electorate  and  the\r\n\r\npeople.  The  Members opposite are really  good  at\r\n\r\nspreading  rumours. They made the  allegation  that\r\n\r\nour  propaganda material was printed in Hong  Kong,\r\n\r\nbut  I can prove to them that it was published  and\r\n\r\nprinted by our local printers. But it is the  usual\r\n\r\ntactic  of the Barisan Sosialis to spread  rumours.\r\n\r\nThey  say the rumours are spread by others but,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  they came from them. So we can see that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, who claim to be  heroes  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  enjoy the support of the  people,  are\r\n\r\nreally  humbugs. If they really had the support  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  and they had five years to  carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir  propaganda work, then they should  not  have\r\n\r\nbeen  what  they are now. They would have  got  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  people and come  to  power.  What\r\n\r\ndifference does it make between nine days and  five\r\n\r\ndays? Do you mean to say that the reduction of  the\r\n\r\nnumber of days is going to affect the Opposition to\r\n\r\nsuch  an  extent  as to warrant  the  uncalled  for\r\n\r\ncriticism against the Bill?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they spoke about the election of a king. I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask them what is the meaning of  the\r\n\r\nword  \"election\"?  Election means  competition.  In\r\n\r\nthis  historical  case that they referred  to,  was\r\n\r\nthere another candidate competing for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  throne?  No. That was not so. That  being  so,\r\n\r\nwhere  was  the  election? They  are  just  talking\r\n\r\nnonsense.  Their  talk  is  very  preposterous  and\r\n\r\nabsurd. If it was a true election, of course, there\r\n\r\nmust  be  another  person competing  for  the  same\r\n\r\nthing.  If  there was a true election for  a  king,\r\n\r\nthen there must be another candidate competing with\r\n\r\nNapoleon for the throne. But from the Member's  own\r\n\r\nhistorical  knowledge - let us assume  that  he  has\r\n\r\nsome  such  knowledge - he knows that  there  was  no\r\n\r\ncandidate  competing with Napoleon for the  throne.\r\n\r\nCan you call that an election for a king?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say that the P.A.P. are not democratic and\r\n\r\nthat  their  workers  were  assaulted  during   the\r\n\r\nelection.  Now let us look at them.  They  are  all\r\n\r\nvery young and have strong muscles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon.

I say that their people  were\r\n\r\nnot  so  peaceful and innocent. We saw  how  lorry-loads of their supporters went round prepared for a\r\n\r\nfight  at  any moment. How could such  people  have\r\n\r\nbeen  assaulted? Who will believe their  allegation\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  the P.A.P. people who assaulted  the\r\n\r\nBarisan boys? If this was so, I am sure the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwould  not have been returned with 37 seats. If  we\r\n\r\nhad  done  so, we would have resorted  to  violence\r\n\r\nagainst our opponents and they would not have had a\r\n\r\nchance  to  come in here at all. It  was  fortunate\r\n\r\nthat the P.A.P. did not restrict the activities  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis during the election. In fact,\r\n\r\nwe  gave them ample opportunities to conduct  their\r\n\r\nelection  campaign in a democratic manner  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  people  could  make a  free  choice  of  their\r\n\r\ncandidates.  The  facts have  proved  that  we  are\r\n\r\nright.  The  people have chosen us again.  And  yet\r\n\r\nthey  talk of the broad masses behind them. But  it\r\n\r\nwas  the broad masses who objected to their  coming\r\n\r\nto power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere  was the support that they had? If  they  say\r\n\r\nthat  the people were behind them, then the people\r\n\r\nwould  have voted them in. But why did they  choose\r\n\r\nsuch  a  handful of them? On the other  hand,  why\r\n\r\nwere 37 of us elected? We have been here day in and\r\n\r\nday  out  continuously explaining to them, and  yet\r\n\r\nthey  fail  to understand the true position.  These\r\n\r\npeople  just  refuse to understand  the  fact  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  has joined Malaysia as a State.  Instead\r\n\r\nof referring to our country as Malaysia, they still\r\n\r\nuse the term \"Malaya\". [Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one other point I wish to draw attention to, and that is with regard to the police. They say that during the election the police were given power to arrest the Barisan people and to interfere with the activities of the workers and delivery-clerks, thereby creating an\r\n\r\natmosphere  of  fear. This is  sheer  falsehood  in\r\n\r\norder  to divert the attention and blind the vision\r\n\r\nof  the  people.  We know that the  police  do  not\r\n\r\nbelong  to  the  P.A.P. They do not belong  to  any\r\n\r\nParty. They are a neutral force and are above party\r\n\r\npolitics. They are not a partisan force. If you are\r\n\r\nguilty  of an offence, then the police will  arrest\r\n\r\nyou.  If you want to sell out the interests of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  and become traitors, then, of course,  the\r\n\r\npolice will arrest you. What else do you expect the\r\n\r\npolice to do? If you do not have the consent of the\r\n\r\nmembers  of a union and you make use of the  funds,\r\n\r\nthen,  of course, the police will investigate  into\r\n\r\nthe  matter. But the Barisan Members have the cheek\r\n\r\nto  say that the police are helping the P.A.P.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, you appreciate that the  police  are\r\n\r\nabove  politics and are neutral. If you are  guilty\r\n\r\nof any offence, you will have to face the law.

He  said  there were no rival  candidates\r\n\r\ncompeting   with  Napoleon  for  the  throne.   But\r\n\r\nNapoleon  also  said  that he was  elected  by  the\r\n\r\npeople.  For  example,  the ex-President  of  South\r\n\r\nKorea, Syngman Rhee, was also elected by the people\r\n\r\nin  a  democratic way. There was a rival candidate.\r\n\r\nBut  sometimes such rival candidates are  arrested,\r\n\r\nexecuted or they just disappear in elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary also made another point. He said that if we have mass support, we can take part in elections anywhere and at any time. But in the recent election, one of our candidates, Mr Tan Siew Swee, was arrested just before Nomination Day. Mr Speaker, Sir, this was the so-called election referred to by the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary.  We  know  that  once  a  candidate   is\r\n\r\narrested and detained, he cannot take part  in  the\r\n\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now going to refer to the election in\r\n\r\nSarawak.  That was also an election. The Opposition\r\n\r\nParties  in Sarawak also nominated their candidates\r\n\r\nto  contest the election, but they were arrested by\r\n\r\nthe  police  and detained in a police  station  far\r\n\r\naway  from  the town.

[Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot follow the English\r\n\r\ntranslation unless there are less interruptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nlet  me  give  my  reasons why  I  think  that  the\r\n\r\nreduction  from  nine to five days  is  not  right.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  it will be advantageous to the  Party  in\r\n\r\npower   but   disadvantageous  to  the   Opposition\r\n\r\nParties.  The Deputy Prime Minister said that  this\r\n\r\nreduction  in  the number of days is based  on  the\r\n\r\npractice  in  England, that the maximum  period  in\r\n\r\nEngland  is five days, whereas the five-day  period\r\n\r\nin  Singapore is the minimum and that the provision\r\n\r\nhere is better than that in England. Let us compare\r\n\r\nSingapore  with England to show why we  should  not\r\n\r\nhave  a five-day period in Singapore. We know  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  has been under direct British  rule  for\r\n\r\nmore than 100 years. This is a fact which cannot be\r\n\r\ndenied  by  the  P.A.P.  During  this  period,  the\r\n\r\nBritish suppressed and exploited the people in this\r\n\r\narea.  They  did  not educate  the  people  in  the\r\n\r\nparliamentary  procedures of a  democratic  system,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the holding of elections, and so on.  The\r\n\r\nBritish people have held elections for hundreds  of\r\n\r\nyears,  but  the  people  of  Singapore  have  held\r\n\r\nelections  since the Rendel Constitution came  into\r\n\r\nexistence. The people in England have had  hundreds\r\n\r\nof  years'  experience in the holding of  elections\r\n\r\nwhich  we lack in Singapore. Another point is  that\r\n\r\nthere   is  the  rule  of  law  and  constitutional\r\n\r\nmonarchy  in  England. In such a country,  after  a\r\n\r\nlong period of political education, the people have\r\n\r\nbecome  familiarised  with the  democratic  way  of\r\n\r\nlife.  In  addition, they have a very high standard\r\n\r\nof education; most of them are educated. Therefore,\r\n\r\nin  England, the period of five days is  sufficient\r\n\r\nwithout causing any difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Member for Ulu Pandan\r\n\r\nmentioned   that  it  is  easy  for  a   particular\r\n\r\ncandidate to be elected\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  the  people  know him. There are some  shocking\r\n\r\nincidents which he did not reveal to the House.  In\r\n\r\nEngland, political Parties can hold rallies at  any\r\n\r\ntime they like to carry out their party propaganda.\r\n\r\nBut  in  Singapore the political Parties are denied\r\n\r\nthis  right.  For example, if the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nwant  to  hold a rally at Hong Lim Green, they  are\r\n\r\nnot  allowed. They will also not be allowed to hold\r\n\r\na  rally at the Jalan Besar Stadium. There will  be\r\n\r\nthe  added  difficulty of applying for a  site  for\r\n\r\nthis  purpose.  We  will not  get  any  permission.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is difficult for us to carry out  our\r\n\r\npolitical  work, whereas in England  the  political\r\n\r\nParties  can  carry out their party work,  such  as\r\n\r\nexplaining  their  party  aims  and  educating  the\r\n\r\npeople.  There  is this difference between  England\r\n\r\nand Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of elections is new to the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore. Elections were only introduced after the\r\n\r\nRendel Constitution came into force. Therefore, the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  are not  accustomed  to  the\r\n\r\nprocedure of elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that education is not\r\n\r\nuniversal   in  Singapore.  Not  many  people   are\r\n\r\neducated,  although  there  is  free  primary   and\r\n\r\nsecondary education. But the students generally  do\r\n\r\nnot have voting rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of these reasons that the reduction\r\n\r\nof  the  period  from nine days  to  five  days  is\r\n\r\nimproper.  Many  difficulties will come  up  before\r\n\r\nOpposition   Parties  and  this  will  give   ample\r\n\r\nopportunity to the Party in power to deal with  the\r\n\r\nOpposition. The period of five days is very  short.\r\n\r\nTwo  days will be taken up for nomination, and  the\r\n\r\nbalance of three clays is left for campaigning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me give another example. Soon after the elections, on the night of 2nd February the majority of our Party leaders were detained, among whom were Lim Ching Siong and Fong Swee Suan. They are respected by the people and are very popular. That is why they were detained. Altogether\r\n\r\nmore  than a hundred of our comrades were detained.\r\n\r\nFollowing the arrest of our leaders, the Government\r\n\r\nrestricted the Press so as to deny us the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  publicise our propaganda.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, the Prime Minister went to  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  to  carry out his electioneering  work.  All\r\n\r\nthese  rural  tours  were for the  purpose  of  the\r\n\r\nelections.   We,  however,  did  not   enjoy   such\r\n\r\nopportunities. And it was exactly for those reasons\r\n\r\nthat  the Government held a snap election. We  were\r\n\r\nonly  given nine days to canvass, and this  already\r\n\r\nis a very short period. And now they want to reduce\r\n\r\nit  to  five  days.  Within  those  nine  days  our\r\n\r\npotential candidates were arrested and we had  some\r\n\r\ndifficulty in getting replacements. If we had other\r\n\r\ncandidates, they too might have been arrested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, when printing work for our campaigning\r\n\r\nhad   gone   half-way,  the  Government   cut   the\r\n\r\nelectricity  supply to our printers,  so  that  our\r\n\r\npublicity material could not be printed in time. If\r\n\r\nthey  reduce the nine-day period to five days,  one\r\n\r\nday is spent on nomination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I think the Member is basing his\r\n\r\nargument on the wrong facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order or a point of\r\n\r\nclarification?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> The Member is talking about\r\n\r\nreducing the period from nine days to five days.

If he thinks that the Member has got his facts wrong, he can rise in reply and tell him so. But he only interrupts on a point of order or clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please proceed, Mr Kow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): You do not know\r\n\r\nwhat  is  being discussed. This five-day period  is\r\n\r\ndisadvantageous  to  the  Opposition  Parties.   If\r\n\r\nelections  are  conducted fairly  and  impartially,\r\n\r\nthen, of course, it is a different\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter. But the P.A.P. have been guilty  of\r\n\r\nmalpractices in elections. And so this reduction in\r\n\r\nthe   period  is  an  added  disadvantage  to   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Parties, so that they cannot  have  any\r\n\r\nopportunity to carry out their propaganda work  and\r\n\r\nto get in touch with the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give another example. At the last\r\n\r\nelections,  about two days before Polling  Day  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  gave a radio talk  at  half-hourly\r\n\r\nintervals. He said that if the people voted for the\r\n\r\nBarisan  and they were returned on the  results  of\r\n\r\nthe voting, then Federation troops would march into\r\n\r\nSingapore, thus causing fear in the hearts  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  There  was almost terror  in  them.  Under\r\n\r\nthese circumstances, we were put at a disadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe  Barisan  Sosialis then tried to  persuade  the\r\n\r\npeople  not to be misled by P.A.P. propaganda,  but\r\n\r\nwhatever  we  wanted to say, we were not  given  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to broadcast over Radio Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nnothing was printed in the Press too because of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s restriction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus if the elections were conducted under\r\n\r\nsimilar circumstances, the people would not be able\r\n\r\nto freely exercise their discretion. The Opposition\r\n\r\nalso  would  be put in a disadvantageous  position.\r\n\r\nThere  is  also the fear that the Government  might\r\n\r\nmonopolise everything. If the Government  dared  to\r\n\r\ngive  equal  chances  to  the  Opposition  in   the\r\n\r\nelections, such as a certain period of time for the\r\n\r\nOpposition  to  speak  over  the  radio,  then  the\r\n\r\nresults  would be different. Otherwise,  this  Bill\r\n\r\nonly helps the P.A.P. to perpetuate their regime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very likely that in future the P.A.P. might\r\n\r\nintroduce another Bill to further reduce the period\r\n\r\nof  live  days  to  three days. I hope  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  do  not think that because  the  people\r\n\r\nhave voted them in, as they so claim, they can  now\r\n\r\ndo  anything they want, even bad things. The people\r\n\r\nhave   voted  them  in  under  their  own  election\r\n\r\nmachinery to form the Government, and so they  hope\r\n\r\nthat  they can do something good for them  and  not\r\n\r\nanything  bad. They cannot say that since they  now\r\n\r\nform the Government, they have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  right  to  do  bad things, if  this  is  their\r\n\r\nreasoning, then I really pity them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Mr Speaker and Members of the House\r\n\r\nhave  now and then been to the pictures. They  will\r\n\r\nhave  noted  that the finale of every  film  always\r\n\r\nshows   the   villains  defeated  and  the   heroes\r\n\r\ntriumphant. So it is the case with our society.  In\r\n\r\nthe  end,  the  undemocratic  Government  will   be\r\n\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, we all agree that\r\n\r\nelections  are a very serious business  and  not  a\r\n\r\ncircus.

They know very well  that  if\r\n\r\nwe  were Fascists today, there would not have  been\r\n\r\nany  elections and Members in the Opposition  would\r\n\r\nnot be sitting where they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make it quite clear that what is\r\n\r\nin  dispute  is  the  period between  the  Writ  of\r\n\r\nElections  and  Nomination Day. The period  between\r\n\r\nNomination  Day and Polling Day is not involved  at\r\n\r\nall  in  this Ordinance. The minimum period between\r\n\r\nNomination  Day and Polling Day remains  as  it  is\r\n\r\n- nine days. In other words, the period for election\r\n\r\ncampaigning is not altered.

In\r\n\r\nthe  end,  the Barisan Sosialis, together with  the\r\n\r\nRight-Wing  political Party, the  S.P.A.,  which  was\r\n\r\nalready discredited, and with the U.M.N.O. and  the\r\n\r\nU.P.P.,  ganged up to defeat us on  a  vital  Bill.\r\n\r\nWhen  I  announced in the Assembly on that occasion\r\n\r\nthat  we  were going to adjourn sine die  and  that\r\n\r\ndeletions  were  going to be  held  sometime  after\r\n\r\nMalaysia day, if Members of the Opposition had  any\r\n\r\nbrains  in  their heads at all, they  would  surely\r\n\r\nhave  understood the consequences of their  action.\r\n\r\nThey should have prepared for the elections. You do\r\n\r\nnot  choose candidates between the period when  the\r\n\r\nWrit  is  issued  and  Nomination  Day.  A  serious\r\n\r\npolitical  Party would already have  laid  out  its\r\n\r\nground.  It  would have surveyed who would  be  the\r\n\r\nlikely candidates arid who would stand on the Party\r\n\r\nticket.  In the past, several elections have  shown\r\n\r\nthat  independent candidates, who  popped  up  like\r\n\r\nmushrooms after a thunderstorm or rabbits out of  a\r\n\r\nmagician's hat, did not stand any chance at all  in\r\n\r\nthese  elections.  The  days  have  gone  when   an\r\n\r\nIndependent  can  claim  that  he  will   win   his\r\n\r\nconstituency  by  virtue of his personality  alone.\r\n\r\nNothing has been more evident than the instance  of\r\n\r\nthe  election  in Anson when an ex-Chief  Minister,\r\n\r\nthe ex-Member for Anson, without the support of the\r\n\r\nCommunists,  which we have all along  said  he  had\r\n\r\nbeen receiving, lost his deposit. The intention  of\r\n\r\nthis  amendment  in reducing the period  from  nine\r\n\r\ndays to five days between the issue of the Writ and\r\n\r\nNomination  Day is to facilitate and  expedite  the\r\n\r\nbusiness of nomination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Barisan have forgotten that during\r\n\r\nthe election campaign, an opportunity was given  to\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition Parties to participate in radio and\r\n\r\ntelevision forums. In fact, in one T.V. forum,  we\r\n\r\nall  remember very clearly that the Chairman of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis agreed with the Member  for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim that even if the elections had been confined to\r\n\r\nthree days, it would not have mattered at all. They\r\n\r\nwere  all  in  agreement  that  the  record  of   a\r\n\r\npolitical  Party over the past few  years  was  the\r\n\r\ndeciding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfactor.  It  is  not  that the  electorate  are  so\r\n\r\nfoolish  or  stupid  as  to vote  in  some  unknown\r\n\r\ncandidate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I come to clause 6, to which the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tampines  has taken  great  objection?\r\n\r\nClause  6,  which  seeks to prevent  canvassing  or\r\n\r\nintimidation during Polling Day, was debated during\r\n\r\nthe  debate  on the Referendum Bill. In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  clause 6 were enforced  during  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  in  September last year.  Clause  6  is\r\n\r\nimportant  to  prevent  undesirable  elements  from\r\n\r\nintimidating  those who are going to the  poll.  As\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim has said, the Barisan  are\r\n\r\nthe  meanest  political Party in town,  and  it  is\r\n\r\nquite  clear  why the Barisan object very  much  to\r\n\r\nclause  6.  It  is not true that a hawker  will  be\r\n\r\nafraid  to move out of his house to hawk at another\r\n\r\nhouse,  all  because of clause 6. Let me  read,  so\r\n\r\nthat they can understand the implications of clause\r\n\r\n6. This clause says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Notwithstanding the provisions of the Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure Code relating to the powers of search  of\r\n\r\nany  police  officer,  if any  police  officer  has\r\n\r\nreasonable  cause  to believe that  an  offence  is\r\n\r\nbeing  committed  under  the  provisions  of   this\r\n\r\nsection,  such  police officer, by  virtue  of  his\r\n\r\noffice, shall be empowered to enter and search  any\r\n\r\npremises  or  place for the purpose of ascertaining\r\n\r\nwhether such an offence is being committed.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>There  is no reason why, therefore, people who  are\r\n\r\nhonest  and  who have no intention to infringe  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Elections Ordinance should  fear\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of clause 6 into the Bill. Clause\r\n\r\n6  merely  states that a police officer  can  enter\r\n\r\npremises  to  investigate and  find  out  what  the\r\n\r\nsuspicious character is doing moving from house  to\r\n\r\nhouse. It has been our experience in the past  that\r\n\r\neven  on Polling Day certain people have been going\r\n\r\nround the streets intimidating voters and trying to\r\n\r\ncanvass votes even to the very, last minute. It  is\r\n\r\nour  intention to stop this and clause 6, we  hope,\r\n\r\nwill act as a deterrent to such evil doers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say here again that it is not the electoral\r\n\r\nregisters  nor  the  Elections Ordinance  which  is\r\n\r\ndecisive. The decisive factor, the decisive  force,\r\n\r\nin the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelections will be the electorate themselves.  Given\r\n\r\nthe opportunity of expressing their views in secret\r\n\r\n- one man one vote - we are quite sure that democracy\r\n\r\nwill  prevail.  Despite what the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave  said against the amendments to this  Bill,  I\r\n\r\ncan  assure  Members of this House  that  elections\r\n\r\nwill  always be fairly conducted according  to  the\r\n\r\nrules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Dr Toh Chin Chye].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 and 2 ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That clause 3 stand\r\n\r\npart of the Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, I have\r\n\r\nheard  the  arguments  given by  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister. He says that clause 3 is in line with the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom practice. Mr Speaker, clause  3  is\r\n\r\nthe  meat  of  the  whole  Bill.  The  Government's\r\n\r\nproposal  to  amend  section 24  of  the  principal\r\n\r\nOrdinance has been motivated, in the words  of  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister, so that electioneering  in\r\n\r\nSingapore will be done according to the practice in\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom. In the last few minutes, I have\r\n\r\ngone  to  the Library of the Assembly House  and  I\r\n\r\nhave  checked that, far from following the practice\r\n\r\nof the United Kingdom, we are departing further and\r\n\r\nfurther   away  from  the  electioneering  practice\r\n\r\nthere.  I  have checked that in 1955  the  date  of\r\n\r\nannouncement  to the date of polling  is  41  days.\r\n\r\nThis is in the 1955 general elections in the United\r\n\r\nKingdom.  In  the  1959 general  elections  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom,  the minimum period  was  41  days\r\n\r\nafter  the announcement. But previously the British\r\n\r\nPrime Minister had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintimated  to  the  Opposition Parties  that  there\r\n\r\nwould  be  general  elections  soon.  In  the  last\r\n\r\nelections   in   Singapore,  the   period   between\r\n\r\nannouncement and polling is only 18 days.  Now  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is further attempting to reduce it to 14\r\n\r\ndays.  Mr Speaker, if the Government will give  us\r\n\r\nan  undertaking that they are going to  follow  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom electioneering practice in toto,  we\r\n\r\nwill   accept   it.  We  will  even  support   this\r\n\r\namendment.   But  for  that  matter,  having   much\r\n\r\nexperience  with this Government, I  am  very  much\r\n\r\ndoubtful  whether the Government  will  follow  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom electioneering practice in toto.  I\r\n\r\nwould, therefore, suggest that in future, elections\r\n\r\nto the State Assembly of Singapore be conducted not\r\n\r\nby  the  P.A.P.  Government but by the  independent\r\n\r\nFederal   Elections   Commission,   which   is   an\r\n\r\nindependent   body   appointed   by   the   Central\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 is the meat of the whole Bill. As a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  fact, this clause is the most important\r\n\r\nmatter  which  this House has been discussing.  The\r\n\r\nspeech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara and the Budget\r\n\r\nare   only  forums  where  Parties,  both  on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  side and the Opposition  side,  express\r\n\r\ntheir  propaganda and their views.  They  can  talk\r\n\r\nuntil  the  morning and until the cock  crows.  But\r\n\r\nthere  is  no power struggle involved.  Whereas  in\r\n\r\nclause  3  of this Bill, which Bill, in my opinion,\r\n\r\nis  the  most important Bill so far brought forward\r\n\r\nin  this House, the Government hope that they  will\r\n\r\nbe  one  step further towards the one-party  State,\r\n\r\nand that by virtue of this clause they will be able\r\n\r\nto  win  again  in the next general elections.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister has told us\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  only  following  the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nelectioneering practice. I hope he will give us  an\r\n\r\nassurance  that  the  Government  will  follow  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom electioneering practice in toto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I assure the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim  that that is the intention of this Bill,  that\r\n\r\nis,  to  follow the time-table as indicated in  the\r\n\r\nUnited\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKingdom  Representation of the People Act. In  this\r\n\r\nAct,  in Schedule II, the time-tables for the issue\r\n\r\nof  writ and delivery of nomination papers, are all\r\n\r\nvery  clearly stated. May I point out to the Member\r\n\r\nfor Hong Lim that even in the United Kingdom, there\r\n\r\nis  greater flexibility given to the Government  on\r\n\r\nthe issue of writ. It says in the case of a general\r\n\r\nelection,  \"as soon as practicable after the  issue\r\n\r\nof the proclamation summoning the new Parliament, a\r\n\r\nwrit  will be issued.\" Writs will be issued to over 500   \r\n\r\nReturning  Officers  in  Britain.   In   this\r\n\r\nOrdinance  of  the United Kingdom nowhere  does  it\r\n\r\nstate  specifically when the writ will  be  issued.\r\n\r\nAll it says is that writs will be issued as soon as\r\n\r\npracticable. After the event of issuing  the  writ,\r\n\r\nnomination  papers must be received not later  than\r\n\r\nthe  eighth  day  after  the date  of  proclamation\r\n\r\nsummoning  the  new Parliament. Therefore,  between\r\n\r\nthe  date  when  the  proclamation  is  issued  for\r\n\r\nsummoning  the  new Parliament and Nomination  Day,\r\n\r\nthere  are approximately eight days. But the  writs\r\n\r\ncan  be  issued at any time within the eight  days.\r\n\r\nAll  it says in this Ordinance is that these  writs\r\n\r\nmust be issued as soon as practicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim, from his experience in\r\n\r\nthe  last  Assembly,  should have  known  that  you\r\n\r\ncannot  pick out 51 candidates within five days  or\r\n\r\nwithin  nine days. If the Member for Hong  Lim  had\r\n\r\nany  serious  intentions of forming the  Government\r\n\r\nthis  year, he would have picked out his candidates\r\n\r\nwisely  and  he  would  have  had  his  candidates'\r\n\r\nposters   plastered   all  over   Singapore.   But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  the Member for Hong  Lim  had  only\r\n\r\nposters of himself pasted throughout Singapore,  so\r\n\r\nit  appeared to the people of Singapore that  there\r\n\r\nwas  only one candidate from the U.P.P. In fact,  I\r\n\r\nhave  heard it said that they did not even know  in\r\n\r\nthe rural areas whether the U.P.P. candidate was  a\r\n\r\nman or a woman. All they knew was a name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether, even in the next general\r\n\r\nelections, if we were to allow this period of  nine\r\n\r\ndays  to  remain in the Ordinance, it would improve\r\n\r\nthe  situation  for the U.P.P.  In  fact,  I  would\r\n\r\nadvise the leader of the U.P.P., if he had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nambitions to capture what support he can  from  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, to prepare now and form a  shadow\r\n\r\nCabinet  as the Labour Party in Britain,  which  is\r\n\r\nnow  in  the  Opposition, has.  The  Labour  Party,\r\n\r\nalthough   in  Opposition,  always  has  a   shadow\r\n\r\nCabinet,  ready  for  the elections  at  any  time.\r\n\r\nTherefore, whether the period between issue of writ\r\n\r\nand  Nomination Day is nine days or  five  days  is\r\n\r\nimmaterial.   It   is  purely  for   administrative\r\n\r\nconvenience  that this period is  inserted  in  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance. In the case of Singapore which is a very\r\n\r\nsmall  island,  it  is easy for  the  writ  for  51\r\n\r\nconstituencies to be issued in one day, because  we\r\n\r\nhave  only one Returning Officer. But in the United\r\n\r\nKingdom  you  have one Returning Officer  for  each\r\n\r\nconstituency  and many of these constituencies  are\r\n\r\nlocated  in  remote spots in Scotland, Ireland  and\r\n\r\nthe  Shetland Islands. Therefore, that  period  was\r\n\r\nprovided  for  in the United Kingdom  Ordinance  to\r\n\r\npermit these writs to reach the Returning Officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add once more that, although the Member\r\n\r\nfor Hong Lim says that clause 3 is the meat of this\r\n\r\nBill, it forms only part of the amendment which  we\r\n\r\nare  proposing and that it is not decisive  in  the\r\n\r\nelections  to come. What will be decisive  will  be\r\n\r\nthe  work  of  the  political  Party  each  of   us\r\n\r\nrepresents in the next five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has not assured us that he  is  going  to\r\n\r\nfollow  the  United  Kingdom election  practice  in\r\n\r\ntoto. If he had, I will be able to point out to him\r\n\r\nwhat is the practice in the United Kingdom. In  the\r\n\r\n1955  and  1959  general elections  in  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom,  the  Government  announced  that  general\r\n\r\nelections would be held and that the period between\r\n\r\nthe  announcement of the general election  and  the\r\n\r\nwrit  of  elections was 21 days. It was 21 days  in\r\n\r\nthe  1955 general elections and 21 days in the 1959\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections. That seems to be the  practice.\r\n\r\nBut  in  Singapore we have two days.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  it is not possible to make photos and  blocks\r\n\r\nof  candidates in two days, unless like the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  with  their resources,  they  can  make\r\n\r\ntheir  blocks and print their posters in Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nand ship them overnight like a thief to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  the  United Kingdom the practice  is  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  always  give  three  weeks,  when  they\r\n\r\nannounce  that general elections will be held,  for\r\n\r\nParties to prepare up till the issue of the Writ of\r\n\r\nElections.  There is a further three or four  weeks\r\n\r\nbefore  they have polling. But in Singapore  if  we\r\n\r\nhave  a law making the same requirements that there\r\n\r\nwill  be a date of announcement, which will be  two\r\n\r\nweeks  or three weeks before the date of the  writ,\r\n\r\nwe will accept the Government's amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I do not believe the Member\r\n\r\nfor Hong Lim is quite correct. He is talking of the\r\n\r\npractice of governments in the United Kingdom.  You\r\n\r\nknow very well that governments change. In 1955 you\r\n\r\nhave  one government and four years later you  have\r\n\r\nanother government. What governs the conduct of any\r\n\r\ngovernment is the Elections Ordinance, and  I  have\r\n\r\njust cited a U.K. Act called the Representative  of\r\n\r\nthe People Act which has a Schedule giving the time-table  for the issue of writ, publication of notice\r\n\r\nof election, delivery of nomination papers, Polling\r\n\r\nDay, and  so on. Every government has to abide  by\r\n\r\nthis Ordinance which is the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Hong Lim's complaint that\r\n\r\nthere was no warning for general elections, let  me\r\n\r\nremind him again of what he said on television.  He\r\n\r\nsaid  very  clearly it was immaterial  whether  the\r\n\r\nelection  campaign was going to  be  nine  days  or\r\n\r\nthree  days. He was here in this Assembly in  July.\r\n\r\nHe  ganged  up together with the S.P.A.,  U.M.N.O.,\r\n\r\nthe  Independent Member for Anson, and the Barisan.\r\n\r\nHe  helped to defeat a vital Bill in this Assembly.\r\n\r\nThat  was the last sitting of the Assembly. At that\r\n\r\ntime  I  stated  in this Chamber very  clearly,  in\r\n\r\nreply to the Member for Anson, that elections would\r\n\r\nbe held after Malaysia Day. In July we had our last\r\n\r\nsitting;  elections  were  held  at  the   end   of\r\n\r\nSeptember;  there was an interval of three  months.\r\n\r\nHow could the Member for Hong Lim complain that  he\r\n\r\nhad no time to prepare his election campaign or  to\r\n\r\nlook  for his candidates, or to get his candidates'\r\n\r\nposters printed? I have no objections if he has his\r\n\r\nposters  printed  in Hong Kong or  Japan.  That  is\r\n\r\nimmaterial to me. But the Ordinance dictates\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat these are the rules by which elections must he\r\n\r\nheld and we have followed the rules.

Except for these clauses, the provisions in the\r\n\r\nBill  remain the same as those in the original Bill\r\n\r\nintroduced on the 7th of June, 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of this Bill is to enable amendments to\r\n\r\nbe made to the Central Provident Fund Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main amendment is in clause 4, which will\r\n\r\nenable  the  Board  to declare  a  higher  rate  of\r\n\r\ninterest on contributions to the Fund than are  now\r\n\r\nprevailing. At present the Board is precluded  from\r\n\r\ndeclaring a higher rate of interest than 2\ufffd\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nper  cent per annum unless the assets of the  Board\r\n\r\nat  current market value exceed its liability by 10\r\n\r\nper  cent.  The amendment proposed is in line  with\r\n\r\nwhat  has been introduced in the Employee Provident\r\n\r\nFund (Amendment No. 2) Act, 1960, of the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya,  which came into force on the  31st  of\r\n\r\nDecember, 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is in a financial position to declare a\r\n\r\nhigher rate of interest than 2\ufffd per cent per annum,\r\n\r\nas  the redemption value of the Board's investments\r\n\r\nis very much more than its liabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments proposed in the Bill are\r\n\r\nbeing introduced on the recommendation of the Board\r\n\r\nin  the light of experience gained in administering\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance since it came into force on the  1st\r\n\r\nof July, 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arguments and explanations for these\r\n\r\namendments  are  the same for those  given  by  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Minister for Labour on the 24th of  July,\r\n\r\n1963,  when  he  moved the Second Reading  of  this\r\n\r\nBill.

The deletion of this provision in the new\r\n\r\nOrdinance was, however, intentional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it was considered to be much more appropriate\r\n\r\nto include dog licensing and kindred matters in the\r\n\r\nPrevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance than  in\r\n\r\nthe   Local   Government   Integration   Ordinance,\r\n\r\naccordingly  when the Local Government  Integration\r\n\r\nBill  was in the draft stage a draft amendment  was\r\n\r\nalso  prepared  to transfer the provisions  to  the\r\n\r\nPrevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance.

So  the Party in power is now introducing\r\n\r\nthis amendment Bill to prevent cruelty, to animals,\r\n\r\nso  that animals will be happy to die when they are\r\n\r\nslaughtered, instead of dying with dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, the lower strata of society  in\r\n\r\nSingapore are now being treated cruelly and are not\r\n\r\nreceiving  any  attention from any quarter.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso regrettable that in introducing this amendment\r\n\r\nBill,  the  Government have, as we have  suspected,\r\n\r\ncertain  ulterior motives behind the Bill. What  we\r\n\r\nare  afraid is that the Government, in the name  of\r\n\r\nprevention  of cruelty to animals, levy more  taxes\r\n\r\non  the  people because there is provision in  this\r\n\r\nBill  saying that if hawkers sell poultry and other\r\n\r\nanimals they must possess a licence, otherwise they\r\n\r\nare liable to a fine.

So the Minister\r\n\r\ncan regulate rules and decide on the fees according\r\n\r\nto his own wish. I hope the Government will not try\r\n\r\nto extract heavy fees from the poor hawkers because\r\n\r\nthe hawkers are unemployed people in the true sense\r\n\r\nof  the  word. That is why they have to  resort  to\r\n\r\nhawking to earn a livelihood.

Everybody knows the great potential  of\r\n\r\ntourism in Singapore by virtue of its international\r\n\r\nname,  and  its strategic location on international\r\n\r\nair  and  sea  routes. This potential needs  to  be\r\n\r\nexploited and this is best carried out by the joint\r\n\r\nefforts  of  both private business and  Government.\r\n\r\nWith  this  in  view,  the  Government  propose  to\r\n\r\nestablish  a Tourist Promotion Board on which  both\r\n\r\nbusiness and Government will be represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main functions of the Board will be to\r\n\r\npublicise  Singapore  and its  attractions  in  the\r\n\r\nprincipal  tourist  markets,  to  co-ordinate   the\r\n\r\nactivities  of tourist enterprises such as  hotels,\r\n\r\nairlines,  shipping  lines, travel  agencies,  tour\r\n\r\noperators, tourist shops, to regulate standards  to\r\n\r\nbe  maintained by tourist enterprises so that  they\r\n\r\ncompare  favourably with standards  elsewhere,  and\r\n\r\ngenerally  to  improve facilities for  visitors  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We  must  seek  not  only  to   attract\r\n\r\nvisitors  to Singapore, but we must also  see  that\r\n\r\nthey  go away satisfied so that when the word  gets\r\n\r\naround more visitors will come to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the composition of the Board, Members\r\n\r\nwill   note  that  five  of  these  will  represent\r\n\r\nbusiness  interests  as against  four  representing\r\n\r\nofficial interests. I think it is proper that those\r\n\r\nin business should be given adequate representation\r\n\r\nin a Board of this nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The activities of the Board will be financed by\r\n\r\nfunds  from the Tourist Promotion Fund (clause  11)\r\n\r\nto   be  established  under  this  Ordinance.  Both\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  the Government have a stake  in  the\r\n\r\ntourist  industry and accordingly contributions  to\r\n\r\nthe  Fund  will  be  from  both  business  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Initially, the Tourist Promotion  Fund\r\n\r\nwill be financed from a small cess of 3 per cent on\r\n\r\nevery  room  or suite occupied each  day  in  every\r\n\r\ntourist hotel as well as from a subvention from the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Members will note that half a million\r\n\r\ndollars   have   been  provided  in  the   Ordinary\r\n\r\nEstimates  under  Subhead 58 of  Head  24.  Hotels,\r\n\r\ntravel  agencies, tour operators and tourist  shops\r\n\r\nbenefit  from tourism. It is only right  that  they\r\n\r\nshould  be  called upon to contribute  towards  the\r\n\r\ncosts of the activities of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill only sets out the framework, but the\r\n\r\nsuccess  of  the Board will have to depend  on  how\r\n\r\nintelligently the Board frames its strategy and how\r\n\r\neffectively specific measures are carried out.  The\r\n\r\ncurrent  boom  in the construction  of  first-class\r\n\r\nhotels  shows that fhere should be a bright  future\r\n\r\nfor tourist promotion in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Dr Goh Keng Swee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TREASURY BILLS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir, I beg to move the motion standing in my name*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n*  The motion reads as follows: -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves, in accordance with\r\n\r\nsection  2  of the Local Treasury Bills  Ordinance\r\n\r\n(Chapter  69)  that the Minister be authorised  to\r\n\r\nborrow,  by  the issue of Treasury  Bills  in  the\r\n\r\nState,  sums  not  exceeding Malayan  $150,000,000\r\n\r\n(Malayan  Dollars One Hundred and Fifty  Millions)\r\n\r\nin amount.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions of section 2 of the Local\r\n\r\nTreasury Bills Ordinance, the Government have  been\r\n\r\nborrowing  by  the issue of Treasury Bills  in  the\r\n\r\nState up to the amount of $40 million by resolution\r\n\r\nmade in the Legislative Council on 13th July, 1948.\r\n\r\nThe  limit is now being reached in this, and it  is\r\n\r\nsought to increase the limit to $150,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 25th July this year, similar approval was\r\n\r\nsought  in the last Assembly, but was not obtained,\r\n\r\nthe votes being equal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis who opposed the motion were\r\n\r\nunder  the  curious  notion  that  the  motion  was\r\n\r\nrelated  to loans for the development of Sabah  and\r\n\r\nSarawak.
