Members  would like to know the present  water\r\n\r\nsituation   and  the  outlook  - whether   and   when\r\n\r\nrationing  can  be  lifted.  The  total  stocks   in\r\n\r\nimpounding  reservoirs  today,  16th  December,  are\r\n\r\naround 2,780 million gallons or 47.1 per cent of the\r\n\r\ntotal.

A number of people have taken  the\r\n\r\ntrouble  to  write  to  the  newspapers  urging  the\r\n\r\nabolition of water rationing as one of the means  to\r\n\r\ncombat the cholera epidemic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board has given this matter\r\n\r\nurgent consideration. They have been in consultation\r\n\r\nwith  the  medical officers of the Health  Ministry.\r\n\r\nThe  Health Ministry is of the view that  move,  the\r\n\r\npresent  El Tor cholera epidemic has Order not  been\r\n\r\nbrought  about  so  much  by drought  conditions  in\r\n\r\nSingapore resulting in water rationing, but more  by\r\n\r\nthe higher incidence of human carriers of cholera. A\r\n\r\ncomplete  de-rationing  may  lead  to  a  much  more\r\n\r\ndangerous  condition if there should  be  a  drought\r\n\r\nnext made year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been a relaxation of two hours per\r\n\r\nday with water supply stopped at 10 a.m. instead  of\r\n\r\n8 a.m. in order to allow the City area to be flushed\r\n\r\nclean  more  thoroughly at least once a  week.  This\r\n\r\nchange  adds  to the daily consumption of  water  by\r\n\r\nabout 150,000 gallons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water rationing has to be continued until the\r\n\r\nsafety  level in our water stocks has been  reached.\r\n\r\nMembers may like to know what is the safety level of\r\n\r\nwater stocks. This varies at different times of  the\r\n\r\nyear.  The level should be such as to see us, at  an\r\n\r\naverage  daily consumption, now of about 75  million\r\n\r\ngallons  per day, through the annually expected  dry\r\n\r\nmonths of June to September to the next wet season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time we lifted rationing at the end of\r\n\r\nJanuary 1962 after the 1961 drought, the stocks were\r\n\r\nat 67.5 per cent or nearly 4,000 million gallons. To\r\n\r\nsee  ourselves  safely through the next  dry  season\r\n\r\nbetween  June  and September, there should  be  more\r\n\r\nthan  60  per cent of water stocks in our reservoirs\r\n\r\nby the end of the North-East Monsoon in January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the stocks are only 47.1 per cent and I\r\n\r\nregret  to say that rationing will have to  continue\r\n\r\nuntil it reaches 60 per cent, we hope, by the end of\r\n\r\nthe  rainy  season.  However, the  forecast  by  the\r\n\r\nMeteorological  Office has not been  optimistic  and\r\n\r\nless   than  average  December  rainfall  has   been\r\n\r\nforecast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position will be reviewed at the end of\r\n\r\nJanuary,  and at the review, consideration  will  be\r\n\r\ntaken  of the Scudai supplies expected in June  next\r\n\r\nyear  a  which would produce another 10-15  -million\r\n\r\ngallons  per day in conditions of drought and  25-30\r\n\r\nmillion gallons per day normally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

The matter that  has  been\r\n\r\nraised  by  the  Member  for  Kampong  Kembangan\r\n\r\nstrictly  relates to the development vote  under\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs. However, whilst I am unable  to\r\n\r\ngive  him  an undertaking now on the details  of\r\n\r\nthe  request  for community centres  which  will\r\n\r\nentail  acquisition of land  in  Kampong  Eunos,\r\n\r\nJalan Ladang, Jalan Ang Teng and Jalan Eunos,  I\r\n\r\ncan  say  that  it  is the policy  to  site  the\r\n\r\ncommunity   centre  in  the  rural  areas   most\r\n\r\nconvenient  from the population  point  of  view\r\n\r\nwith  regard to transport and rural  tracks  and\r\n\r\nfootpaths. In the specific instances that he has\r\n\r\nin  mind,  the  situation is being studied  with\r\n\r\nregard to the community centres already erected,\r\n\r\nand  should a case be made out for more  centres\r\n\r\nnear where the concentration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  population  in the kampongs  is  now  sited,\r\n\r\nacquisition  of  the  various  pieces  of   land\r\n\r\nindicated   by   the   petitioners    will    be\r\n\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, we can see that the provision amounting  to\r\n\r\n$10,700,000 in respect of the Government's policy of\r\n\r\nland acquisition for development purposes is quite a\r\n\r\nlarge   sum   of   money.  But  judging   from   the\r\n\r\nachievements during these few years and  up  to  the\r\n\r\nend   of  1963,  we  see  that  the  sum  spent   on\r\n\r\nacquisition is only $1,450,000. In other words,  the\r\n\r\nsum  for  the acquisition of land for next year  has\r\n\r\nbeen  greatly  increased. We can also see  from  the\r\n\r\nother  heads in the Development Estimates that there\r\n\r\nis  provision  for land acquisition for  development\r\n\r\npurposes. I do not know whether, when drafting these\r\n\r\nEstimates,   the  Government  have  considered   the\r\n\r\nnecessity  for  such a large sum of money  for  land\r\n\r\nacquisition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to ask is how the\r\n\r\nprice for land acquisition is fixed. Is it based  on\r\n\r\nthe price obtained in January 1961? Not long ago  we\r\n\r\nread  in  the newspapers that there was a  piece  of\r\n\r\nland in Jurong amounting to 1,020 acres belonging to\r\n\r\na  foreign company - Bajau Rubber and Produce  Estate\r\n\r\nCompany.  This is owned by big foreign  capitalists.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result  of  the  development  of  the  Jurong\r\n\r\nindustrial site, the value of that piece of land has\r\n\r\nincreased   very  greatly.  In  other   words,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment have used public money, through taxation,\r\n\r\nto  develop the Jurong industrial site. As a result,\r\n\r\nthe  value  of the land in this area has  increased.\r\n\r\nThis  will only benefit such foreign capitalists  as\r\n\r\nthe  Bajau  Rubber and Produce Estate Company.  This\r\n\r\nhas enabled this particular company to make a profit\r\n\r\nof  $8  million. According to the market price,  the\r\n\r\nprice  of  land should not be more than  $1,000  per\r\n\r\nacre  in  that  area. If the Government  are  really\r\n\r\nsincere  in  wanting to look after the interest  and\r\n\r\nwelfare of the people, then it should not use public\r\n\r\nmoney to develop land in such a way that in the  end\r\n\r\nit is the foreign\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncapitalists who benefit. I do not know what measures\r\n\r\nthe   Government  will  take  in  regard   to   this\r\n\r\nparticular land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government have also acquired land from the\r\n\r\nHokkien  Huay Kuan. The price paid to them  at  that\r\n\r\ntime was very low. It was about $1,000 per acre,  as\r\n\r\nI  have  just now mentioned. But what price  do  the\r\n\r\nGovernment intend to offer for this particular piece\r\n\r\nof  land owned by a foreign capitalist? Is it a high\r\n\r\nprice?  How? Or will the Government allow the  price\r\n\r\nof  land to increase so that it will get higher  and\r\n\r\nhigher  in  the course of time. I hope  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwill not try to do things in such a way that in  the\r\n\r\nend it is the foreign capitalists who will benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, those of us who are new in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  will  soon  have  to  get  ourselves\r\n\r\naccustomed to the regular drivel that is churned out\r\n\r\nby  the  ghost writers and the mentors on the  other\r\n\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's last point, if I may take it first.\r\n\r\nThe  implication is that here is a Government  which\r\n\r\ngoes  out  of its way, either willingly or stupidly,\r\n\r\nto assist foreign capitalists and who treats its own\r\n\r\ncapitalists harshly. He referred to what has already\r\n\r\nbeen  printed  in  some  political  journal  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis about the Bajau Land Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to take advantage of the mathematical virtues of the Member for Jurong at some stage in this session of the House when a Bill with regard to land acquisition and development charges is raised before this Assembly. We are not concerned with whether the land belongs to European\r\n\r\ncapitalists  or local capitalists. We are  concerned\r\n\r\nto  see  that  no private land owner benefits  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of capital expenditure made by the Government\r\n\r\n- the  building  of  roads, the laying  of  services,\r\n\r\nwater, gas, electricity, railroads and, in any case,\r\n\r\nthe  general increase in the price of land,  because\r\n\r\nland is limited and population increases. The amount\r\n\r\nof  currency increases with the population  increase\r\n\r\nand the increase in wealth;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  land  does not. All over the world, this  is  a\r\n\r\nproblem  which is faced in all growing  communities.\r\n\r\nOf  course, if we were a community falling backwards\r\n\r\nand  land values collapsed, and population dispersed\r\n\r\ninto  the  hinterland  of Malaysia,  then  different\r\n\r\nconsiderations would apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to put to the Member for Jurong certain\r\n\r\nbroad principles which we are trying to apply  in  a\r\n\r\nBill  which  we shall introduce in this  House.  The\r\n\r\nfirst principle is that nobody should get a windfall\r\n\r\nbecause of development at public expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second principle is that whenever land is\r\n\r\nrequired for a public purpose, the price to be  paid\r\n\r\nfor  that  land should not be higher  than  what  it\r\n\r\nwould  have  been  worth  had  the  Government   not\r\n\r\ncontemplated development generally in that area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these two principles, we are then faced with\r\n\r\na   constitutional  difficulty  in  that,   in   the\r\n\r\nConstitution of Malaysia, there is a provision which\r\n\r\nsays  that  no land or property can be  acquired  or\r\n\r\nrequisitioned   by   the  State   without   adequate\r\n\r\ncompensation  being paid, and one has  to  reconcile\r\n\r\nthe  two broad principles I have enunciated, namely,\r\n\r\nthat nobody should benefit as a result of government\r\n\r\nexpenditure  and  development;  and  secondly,   the\r\n\r\nprinciple enunciated in the Constitution. This is  a\r\n\r\nhighly  complex matter. I am quite sure  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jurong, if he is sincere, will spend some  time\r\n\r\nin  Select Committee in working out an ingenious way\r\n\r\nwhereby  concerns  like the Bajau Land  Company,  or\r\n\r\nwhatever  realty  company, does not  profit  at  the\r\n\r\nexpense of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member is interested in real estate values,\r\n\r\none  of  the ways in which it is possible to control\r\n\r\nland  values is that suggested by my Chief  Planner,\r\n\r\nthat land should no longer be freehold and that  all\r\n\r\nland  should be leasehold, say, for 66 years  or  99\r\n\r\nyears.  So that at the lapse of every 66th  or  99th\r\n\r\nyear,   as  the  case  may  be,  the  land   reverts\r\n\r\ncompletely  in toto to the State and is  then  again\r\n\r\nsold or otherwise disposed of to the public. That is\r\n\r\none of the techniques which we could employ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain difficulties as to how and what\r\n\r\ndevelopment  charges  should  be  apportioned.   One\r\n\r\ndevelops  Jurong  at  the cost  of  several  million\r\n\r\ndollars.  How  does  one apportion  the  development\r\n\r\ncosts  against  all  the contiguous  frontages?  The\r\n\r\npeople  who own land around the area will  naturally\r\n\r\nprofit  because  the whole of that  area  becomes  a\r\n\r\ndeveloped area. Certain schemes have been  tried  in\r\n\r\nBritain  unsuccessfully and have been abandoned.  We\r\n\r\nare studying other schemes which are in operation in\r\n\r\nAustralia,  where  the technique of  the  short-term\r\n\r\nlease  has been employed. But the disadvantage there\r\n\r\nis  that nobody builds any house worth while because\r\n\r\nthe  land  very  soon  reverts back  to  the  State.\r\n\r\nSomehow between these two we have to strike a  happy\r\n\r\nmean.  But I would like to assure the House that  it\r\n\r\nis  our  intention  to  see that  no  private  owner\r\n\r\nbenefits out of public expenditure on land. That  is\r\n\r\nthe first principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the legislation is passed, it will have\r\n\r\nretrospective effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as to the price that will be paid, the reason\r\n\r\nwhy we have increased the sum to $10 million is that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a contingency of several large  purchases\r\n\r\nfor  the  coming  year. We are  sanguine  enough  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  after the exposure that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis suffered at the hands of the electorate  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  this  year,  they  will  find   it   more\r\n\r\ndifficult to try to block our resettlement  schemes.\r\n\r\nThere  is  also  a  resettlement  scheme  which  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  National  Development  will  soon  be\r\n\r\nannouncing,  generous  terms  of  cash  payments  or\r\n\r\nsubstitution  in  kind.  That  is  because  we   are\r\n\r\nsanguine enough to hope that - whatever may happen in\r\n\r\ntwo  or  three years' time as the situation develops\r\n\r\nand   the  Barisan  become  more  skilful  in  their\r\n\r\ntechniques of blocking development - they  will  have\r\n\r\nconsiderable   difficulty.  One,  because   of   the\r\n\r\ngenerous  terms  which  we will  be  offering,  and,\r\n\r\nsecondly,  the fact that they are suffering  from  a\r\n\r\nnervous  feeling that they will not be so successful\r\n\r\nin  preventing our redevelopment projects. The price\r\n\r\nof the development in most of these cases - the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarket value as at the time of acquisition - will\r\n\r\nhave to be taken into consideration during the\r\n\r\npassage of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, in connection with the loans to the Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development  Board,  I believe  the  programmes\r\n\r\nimplemented by the Housing Board cannot be denied by\r\n\r\nanyone, that the Board has used these loans  to  the\r\n\r\nbest  advantage  and thousands of  flats  have  been\r\n\r\nbuilt  quickly.  The  Barisan  Sosialis  have   made\r\n\r\ncontinuous  efforts  to obstruct  the  programme  of\r\n\r\nconstruction of these flats to be implemented by the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board. For  instance,  the\r\n\r\nHousing Board attempted to acquire land at Toa Payoh\r\n\r\nfor  the  purposes  of putting  up  flats,  but  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis instigated the settlers  there  to\r\n\r\nobstruct  the  good  work  of  the  Housing   Board.\r\n\r\nUnreasonable  demands were put up  by  the  settlers\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Mr Speaker, the S.P.A. claim that the plan\r\n\r\nof  the Housing Board to sell flats to occupiers  is\r\n\r\ntheir  plan, whereas, in fact, they could  not  even\r\n\r\nproceed  with the construction of flats  during  the\r\n\r\nLim Yew Hock and Company regime since 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing Board scheme to sell flats to the\r\n\r\noccupiers  is  a novel scheme for the  lower  income\r\n\r\ngroup so that they may own these fiats, as has  been\r\n\r\nstated in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope the Minister in charge will explain to\r\n\r\nthe House when such a scheme will be implemented and\r\n\r\nthe areas in which work will be started, so that the\r\n\r\noccupiers  of  flats  will  be  able  to  make   the\r\n\r\nnecessary  preparations for  the  purchase  of  such\r\n\r\nflats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first I will answer the\r\n\r\nMember  of  the Opposition as regards loans  to  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board. I will say that the rate of interest\r\n\r\ncharged by the Government is an effective rate: that\r\n\r\nis,  if the interest on loans in the market is about\r\n\r\n5\ufffd or 5\ufffd per cent, the Housing Board will be charged\r\n\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his next question - what do the Government do\r\n\r\nwith  the  rate of interest that is charged  to  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board? I will say this, that the Government\r\n\r\nwill  have  to raise loans also from the market  for\r\n\r\ntheir   development   projects.   Therefore,   these\r\n\r\ninterest  rates are in payment for the  loans  which\r\n\r\nthe  Government raise in the market in order to lend\r\n\r\nto the Housing Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is: how many one-room flats are\r\n\r\ncompleted?  Our Five-Year programme  calls  for  the\r\n\r\ncompletion  of 51,000 units of flats. We  know  that\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore have  various  rates  of\r\n\r\nincome:  some of them earn $100, $200, $300  up  to\r\n\r\n$800  a  month,  or  some of them are  millionaires.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in our building programme, we take  into\r\n\r\naccount  tenants in different categories  of  income\r\n\r\nand  we  work  it  out so that 30 per  cent  of  our\r\n\r\nprogramme will be for a one-room unit, 30  per  cent\r\n\r\nof  the units built will be for a two-room unit, and\r\n\r\n40 per cent will be for a three-room unit. Now it is\r\n\r\nusual all over the world for housing authorities  to\r\n\r\ncalculate  on the basis that a family or wage-earner\r\n\r\nshould  set aside between 20 and 25 per cent of  his\r\n\r\nincome  as  rental. Therefore, our flats cater  for\r\n\r\npeople  with an income of as low as $100  a  month,\r\n\r\nbecause 20 per cent of $100 is $20 and that  is  the\r\n\r\nrent  of  a  one-room unit. Last year, we  completed\r\n\r\nabout  12,000 units and out of that 3,000  are  one-room units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the number of vacant Housing Board flats, at\r\n\r\nthe  moment  it  stands at 2.87 per  cent  of  about\r\n\r\n40,000 units that are under our control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to come to the question raised by one of our\r\n\r\nBack-benchers with regard to the selling of  houses.\r\n\r\nWe  are  looking into this question now  because  it\r\n\r\ninvolves  pricing,  terms  of  payment,  and,   most\r\n\r\nimportant  of all, the maintenance of and titles  to\r\n\r\nthese  units  when we sell. There is a team  looking\r\n\r\ninto  it  and  I  expect  to  be  able  to  make  an\r\n\r\nannouncement  after  it has made  its  findings  and\r\n\r\nrecommendations with regard to the selling of houses\r\n\r\nbuilt by the Housing and Development Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like to add to what our Minister has said just\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building experts give credit to the Government\r\n\r\nfor  their ability in building such cheap  flats  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. The flats are considered to be one of the\r\n\r\nbest in the world. The experts also say that no  one\r\n\r\ncan  build  cheaper  flats than those  built.  These\r\n\r\nflats  are  built to suit the various  lower  income\r\n\r\ngroups. They are offered to the people at rentals of\r\n\r\n$20,  $40  and $60 per month in respect of one-room,\r\n\r\ntwo-room and three-room flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, I understand there are no more one-room\r\n\r\nflats.

Are the Government still\r\n\r\nbuilding  flats in spite of the fact that there  are\r\n\r\nthese   vacant  flats?  Are  the  Government   still\r\n\r\ncontemplating flats with monthly rentals of $20?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I understand\r\n\r\nthe Member for Choa Chu Kang correctly, he wants  to\r\n\r\nknow  the total amount we have paid out in interest.\r\n\r\nWell,  this  loan  is a loan for  60  years.  It  is\r\n\r\npossible  to  compute what we will be paying  in  60\r\n\r\nyears.  But I see no relevant point in asking  that,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  a  60-year loan  and  we  pay  both\r\n\r\nprincipal and interest at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his question on the number of vacant\r\n\r\nflats  in  existence, I can say that, from the  last\r\n\r\ncensus,  it is 2.87 per cent. His reasoning is  that\r\n\r\nif there are empty flats, there is no reason why the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  go  on building  flats.  I  have\r\n\r\nalready explained a few days ago why there are about\r\n\r\n1,000 flats vacant. We complete about 1,000 flats  a\r\n\r\nmonth and it takes some time for the people to  take\r\n\r\nup the flats which have been allocated to them. This\r\n\r\nis  also  a measure of our success because, at  this\r\n\r\nstage, out of every 1,000 fiats allocated, about  30\r\n\r\nper  cent  of  them are rejected by  the  successful\r\n\r\napplicants because they feel sure that if they  were\r\n\r\nto  wait a little longer, the Housing Board would be\r\n\r\nable  to  allocate them flats in the locality  which\r\n\r\nthey desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asks why we should build more flats. I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know whether it is his desire, but  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat it may be his desire to see that the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are not better housed and do not  have  a\r\n\r\nbetter standard of living. On the other hand, we are\r\n\r\nmaking  long-term plans so that not only the  present\r\n\r\ngeneration but also the future generations  will  be\r\n\r\nhoused in healthy and sanitary surrounding. Now  our\r\n\r\npopulation increase is estimated at 60,000 per  year\r\n\r\nand  if we average five members to a family, we will\r\n\r\nhave  to build 12,000 units a year just to cope with\r\n\r\nthe   increase   in   population.   Therefore,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment programme is to provide for this increase\r\n\r\nin population for the years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I wish to clarify what the Member  for\r\n\r\nChoa Chu Kang has said about the 2.8 per cent vacant\r\n\r\nflats,  which  is equivalent to about 10,000  vacant\r\n\r\nflats. These flats are vacant not because there  are\r\n\r\nno  applications for them.

The provision  of  $4\r\n\r\nmillion  is  in  respect  of  land  acquisition   of\r\n\r\nsuitable farming land so that these farmers  can  be\r\n\r\ngiven  alternative sites on which to carry out their\r\n\r\nactivities;   compensation  $1  million,   cost   of\r\n\r\ndevelopment   work   in   the   resettlement    area\r\n\r\n$1,100,000,  administration $261,000,  and  personal\r\n\r\nemoluments $310,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Prime Minister has said earlier that\r\n\r\nthe  Government are revising the compensation rates,\r\n\r\nand  it  is likely that the settlers will  be  given\r\n\r\nbetter  compensation or alternative  sites.  Details\r\n\r\nare  now being worked out and, as the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas said, an announcement will be made later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have found that in the past where these\r\n\r\nsquatters  may occupy illegally about ten  acres  of\r\n\r\nland, invariably in no case have we found that  they\r\n\r\nwere  able  to  farm  more than one  or  two  acres.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in our resettlement scheme  we  do  not\r\n\r\ngive  them more than two acres because, as you know,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  land is very scarce and  valuable  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and it should not be given to someone when\r\n\r\nit is not being made full use of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards assignment, we try as far as possible to\r\n\r\nstop  assignments because in the past we have  found\r\n\r\nthat  this practice has been abused.

If we compare\r\n\r\nthe figures in the Estimates with those contained in\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government's Four-Year Plan 1961-64, they\r\n\r\nwill  show whether or not there are any improvements\r\n\r\nin  the rural areas. The Four-Year Development  Plan\r\n\r\nblue  book gives the amount as $53,700,000  and  the\r\n\r\nsum  provided for rural development was $26,100,000.\r\n\r\nBut  these  figures, it seems, are  quite  different\r\n\r\nfrom  what  the  Minister for Finance  said  in  his\r\n\r\nrecent  Budget statement. He said that $1.77  million\r\n\r\nwas  allotted  for  rural  development.  That  is  a\r\n\r\ndecrease   of  $24.3  million.  According   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, 97 per cent of the development has  been\r\n\r\nachieved. In fact, it is not even up to 4 per  cent.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  the Four-Year Development  Plan,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  intend to develop about 1,000  acres  of\r\n\r\narable  land, 1,000 acres of prawn ponds, and  2,000\r\n\r\nacres of fish ponds. I do not know where these ponds\r\n\r\ncan be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has just now mentioned about resettlement, saying that at present there are many problems relating to the question of resettlement and that these problems need solution. I hope that a solution is forthcoming in the near future. I also welcome the Minister's assurance that he has a plan\r\n\r\nto  improve  the  resettlement  areas.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nproject will also include loans to the resettlers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past those people affected by resettlement\r\n\r\nwere  not  willing to settle down on the alternative\r\n\r\nsites offered. The reason is that they could not get\r\n\r\nloans.  Most of the resettlement areas are far  away\r\n\r\nfrom  the  town  where  there are  not  many  social\r\n\r\nfacilities.  If the Government force  them  to  move\r\n\r\ninto  these resettlement areas, of course, they will\r\n\r\nmeet  with  opposition.  For  instance,  if  farmers\r\n\r\nliving  in  the Geylang area, which is arable  land,\r\n\r\nare asked to move into Kallang where the land is not\r\n\r\nsuitable for agricultural purposes, then, of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse,  they  will oppose such resettlement.  If  a\r\n\r\nfarmer has two acres of land originally, and  he  is\r\n\r\ncompensated  with only one acre, he  will  also  not\r\n\r\nagree to the plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is about transport, which should\r\n\r\nalso  receive Government's consideration. If farmers\r\n\r\nin  the  Toa Payoh and Geylang areas are  forced  to\r\n\r\nlive  in  Choa  Chu Kang or Lim Chu Kang,  which  is\r\n\r\nabout 12 to 14 miles away from town, they will  have\r\n\r\ndifficulty in transport. Perhaps the land there  may\r\n\r\nbe  quite suitable for cultivation, but the cost  of\r\n\r\nproduction to them will be more than the actual cost\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the added and higher cost of transport.\r\n\r\nSo  this  question should be considered in order  to\r\n\r\nreduce the burden on the farmers concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is medical services which have been\r\n\r\nvery   poor  recently.  Also  connected  with  these\r\n\r\nservices   are   veterinary  services,  agricultural\r\n\r\nservices,  inoculation of chickens, which have  also\r\n\r\nbeen poor. Up to now the Government can only provide\r\n\r\ntractors  to help the farmers. Since the alternative\r\n\r\nland they occupy is not very extensive, the tractors\r\n\r\nare therefore of no great value to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to talk about the water supply\r\n\r\nwhich  is  a  very serious problem to  many  people.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of land which are very low and marshy\r\n\r\nand  not suitable for agricultural purposes. Judging\r\n\r\nfrom  the Government's resettlement area in Geylang,\r\n\r\nthe land there is not suitable for agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will consider these problems\r\n\r\nand  that  he  will  do  something  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot\r\n\r\nreconcile  the fact that the farmers want - at  least\r\n\r\nhe  says  they want - to be farmers and at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime  want  to  be  in  town  and  enjoy  all   the\r\n\r\nfacilities  in town. I should be very  happy  if  he\r\n\r\nwould  indicate to us where we can get a  large  and\r\n\r\nsuitable farm tract in town so that these people can\r\n\r\nhave all the modern facilities of town life and,  at\r\n\r\nthe   same   time,   do  their  farming.

He  has\r\n\r\nperhaps forgotten that before 1959 we had to  import\r\n\r\nour  pigs from Bali, Indonesia. We had to import our\r\n\r\neggs.  But because of our rural development project,\r\n\r\nbecause of the scientific advice given by members of\r\n\r\nthe  Primary Production Department, and  because  of\r\n\r\nthe veterinary centres that have been put up, we are\r\n\r\nnow  able  to  export  pigs  and  eggs.  That  is  a\r\n\r\ncriterion whether our rural development project  has\r\n\r\nbeen a success or not, and not just empty talk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an allegation that people are not willing\r\n\r\nto  accept  the  alternative site  provided  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in the resettlement scheme.  My  figures\r\n\r\nshow  that  during the last three years, there  were\r\n\r\naltogether   2,286   farmers   who   had    accepted\r\n\r\nalternative  sites and had released  their  land  so\r\n\r\nthat   we   could  carry  on  with  our  development\r\n\r\nprojects. I would take a long time if I were to read\r\n\r\nthe schemes that we have in hand for the improvement\r\n\r\nof  the farmers. But I believe the Member for  Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang knows as well as I do that a lot of projects\r\n\r\nare being undertaken at the moment. Since this is an\r\n\r\nera  of  science, if you want to have  progress  you\r\n\r\nmust   have   scientific  aid.  We  are,  therefore,\r\n\r\nincreasing the provision in the Estimates  for  more\r\n\r\nlaboratories   and  technical  equipment   for   the\r\n\r\nguidance   of   the  farmers  in  the   nutritional,\r\n\r\ndiagnostic and other spheres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  cannot agree with what the Minister has said.  He\r\n\r\nsays  that  if  you want to have facilities  in  the\r\n\r\ncity,  you  cannot expect them in the  rural  areas.\r\n\r\nThat  is  to  say, people in the rural areas  cannot\r\n\r\nenjoy the facilities which the people living in  the\r\n\r\ncity area are now enjoying, and vice versa. I cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand this kind of talk. City people are having\r\n\r\nfree  medical  services, free  veterinary  services,\r\n\r\nwater and electricity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupply. Does it mean rural people cannot enjoy these\r\n\r\nfacilities? Does it mean that the Government have  a\r\n\r\ndouble  standard, one for people living in the  city\r\n\r\narea  and one for people living in the rural  areas?\r\n\r\nThe   P.A.P.  Government  have  said  that  whatever\r\n\r\nfacilities are available to urban dwellers will also\r\n\r\nbe available to rural dwellers. Now the Minister has\r\n\r\nturned round and said that whatever facilities urban\r\n\r\ndwellers   have  may  not  be  available  to   rural\r\n\r\ndwellers. He says they cannot have it both  ways.  I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned  just  now something  about  medical\r\n\r\nservices, transport and other things. The Government\r\n\r\ncould  provide  all these facilities. For  instance,\r\n\r\nthey    could    provide   better   transport    and\r\n\r\ncommunications,   better  medical   and   veterinary\r\n\r\nservices and so on. All these are problems which can\r\n\r\nbe   solved  in  a  practical  way.  As  far  as   I\r\n\r\nunderstand, there has been no export of  pigs.  Does\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  know that in the past two  months  we\r\n\r\nhave   imported  several  thousand  pigs  from   the\r\n\r\nFederation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to\r\n\r\nrefute the allegations made by the Member for  Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang  with regard to rural development  projects.\r\n\r\nWhatever he has said is not true. For example,  some\r\n\r\nof   the   main   arterial  roads   in   the   rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies have been metalled. These roads  have\r\n\r\nbeen  metalled  because they link up with  the  main\r\n\r\nroads.  In  a  way,  transportation  in  the   rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies is now much better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to electricity supply. I know - being\r\n\r\nmyself  a  member  of the Urban and  Rural  Services\r\n\r\nConsultative  Committee - that we have approved  many\r\n\r\nkampong  electrification schemes.  This  shows  that\r\n\r\nwhat he has said is not true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also installed many stand-pipes and water\r\n\r\nmains  for the kampong folks. More community centres\r\n\r\nhave  been  built.

The\r\n\r\nPrimary  Production Department give free  advice  to\r\n\r\nthe  farmers in respect of agricultural and  poultry\r\n\r\nfarming and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about communications? We have also installed\r\n\r\nmany public telephones.

There is only  one  clinic.\r\n\r\nHave  the  Government any plans for the building  of\r\n\r\nmore  school dental clinics for school children?  At\r\n\r\npresent  there  is at the Outram Road  Institute  of\r\n\r\nHealth,  only one school dental clinic to cope  with\r\n\r\nall  the  school children in Singapore.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nconvenient for school children living in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  to attend this Institute of Health.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthem  do not even know how to find their way  there.\r\n\r\nIt  will  be too expensive for them to go  by  taxi.\r\n\r\nWith  that money they can very well go to a  private\r\n\r\ndental  surgeon.  This is not  a  very  satisfactory\r\n\r\nstate  of  affairs. So I wonder if the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  would  consider building more school  dental\r\n\r\nclinics at more convenient sites instead of spending\r\n\r\nmoney  on  community  centres  which  are  not  very\r\n\r\nimportant.  The building of community centres  would\r\n\r\nonly  be used by the P.A.P. for propaganda purposes.\r\n\r\n[Interruption]  I  do  not know  what  Doctor  anti-Communist  is  talking about! The vote envisaged  in\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  for  works  and  buildings  under  this\r\n\r\nsubhead  is  $150,000. There  is  another  item  for\r\n\r\n$162,000  for furniture and equipment. I would  like\r\n\r\nto have more details concerning these two items.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, on the subject of the development  of\r\n\r\ndental   services,  the  Member  for   Thomson   has\r\n\r\nindicated  that  there  is only  one  dental  clinic\r\n\r\navailable  for school children. That is a matter  of\r\n\r\nthe  past.  There is a new dental  clinic  at  Pegu\r\n\r\nRoad, which is just next to Middleton Hospital,  and\r\n\r\nwhich was opened very recently with 13 dental chairs\r\n\r\nsolely  for school children.

I hope it  meets  his\r\n\r\nquestion on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilding  of more than one dental clinic for  school\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to say that that is not all. In\r\n\r\nfact,   the  Ministry  of  Health's  dental  service\r\n\r\nsection has been very fortunate in that in the  last\r\n\r\nFour-Year Plan about 90 per cent of achievement  has\r\n\r\nbeen  reached in that there are a number  of  school\r\n\r\ndental  huts.  Therefore,  for  1964,  we  will   be\r\n\r\nbuilding the remaining 10 dental huts; six  will  be\r\n\r\nin  primary  schools at Tanjong Katong, Bedok  Boys'\r\n\r\nand  Girls'  School,  Dunearn School,  River  Valley\r\n\r\nSchool and Newton School which is the one covered by\r\n\r\nthe  1964 project. In addition, there will be 12 new\r\n\r\ndental  clinics  in  12  new  integrated  Government\r\n\r\nschools. But during the past year, we have been able\r\n\r\nto build 12 school clinics in new integrated schools\r\n\r\nand  there are also four dental clinics at  maternal\r\n\r\nand  child  health  centres  at  the  Yio  Chu  Kang\r\n\r\nMaternal  and Child Health Clinic, Ama Keng Maternal\r\n\r\nand  Child  Health Clinic, Buona Vista Maternal  and\r\n\r\nChild  Health  Clinic and Bukit  Panjang  Outpatient\r\n\r\nCentre.  So  an attempt has been made to spread  out\r\n\r\ndental  clinics  throughout the  island  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible.  I think this answers the request  of  the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson for a spread of dental clinics to\r\n\r\nlook  after the dental caries of our young children.\r\n\r\nI  do  not  agree with him that it is preferable  to\r\n\r\nbuild  dental clinics in place of community centres.\r\n\r\nI  think  each has a function to perform.

First is the\r\n\r\ndeletion  of  a  number of projects entered  in  the\r\n\r\noriginal plan.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original plan is the Four-Year Development Plan\r\n\r\nof the Government for the years 1961-64.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The two Heads under which a significant number of\r\n\r\nprojects have been deleted or deferred are Head  D18\r\n\r\nHospital  Services and Head D37 Fire Brigade  [which\r\n\r\ndoes not concern us this afternoon].'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The second District Hospital has been deleted from\r\n\r\nthe  present  plan  as  also  has  been  the  second\r\n\r\nMaternity   Home  and  the  Chronic  Sick  Hospital.\r\n\r\nSimilarly  all proposed clinics for 1964  have  been\r\n\r\ndeleted.  The  second  District  Hospital  and   the\r\n\r\nChronic Sick Hospital have never got off the ground.\r\n\r\nThese  are matters which may be raised again in  the\r\n\r\nsecond Five Year Plan or some other Five Year Plan.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now comes the relevant sentence:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Orthopaedic Hospital [I think it should read\r\n\r\nas  the  Orthopaedic Unit in the hospital]  and  the\r\n\r\nRadiography  Unit  [this also  should  read  as  the\r\n\r\nRadiotherapy   Unit],  for  which  there   is   more\r\n\r\njustification  than  the  other  projects,  may   be\r\n\r\nreconsidered in the second Five Year Plan.  It  will\r\n\r\nbe  necessary to assess the availability of  doctors\r\n\r\nwhen these major projects are reassessed.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, that is the explanation that\r\n\r\nthese   items  were  originally  in  the   Four-Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan for the Ministry of Health for  the\r\n\r\nyears 1961-64.  Therefore, the token votes  for  1964\r\n\r\ndevelopment  indicate  that  the  matters  will   be\r\n\r\nreviewed. After I have been given the opportunity to\r\n\r\nstudy  the two projects in my Ministry, it  is  very\r\n\r\nlikely that the green light would again be given and\r\n\r\nwe  would  then have to seek the permission  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse for an allocation of funds. I trust that  when\r\n\r\nthat  time comes, our friends in the Opposition will\r\n\r\nsupport the request for additional funds required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Could the Member for Thomson indicate\r\n\r\nwhether he wishes to withdraw the amendments or have\r\n\r\na vote?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nstill not clear on the answers given by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Health  because  for  the  projects,  the  plan\r\n\r\nprovided  for  $1,700,000, and for the  Radiotherapy\r\n\r\nUnit, the sum provided was $1,300,000. But for  next\r\n\r\nyear the provision is only $10 - a token vote. I do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  know whether in drafting these Estimates he was\r\n\r\nhiding in his air-conditioned room and had not taken\r\n\r\nreality  into  account. If that is  so,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nsurprising  that they have accumulated  such  a  big\r\n\r\nsurplus.  Since  we  have this plan  and  since  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Ministry  has provided such  an  amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney, why should these projects not be carried out;\r\n\r\nwhy  should  they  wait  for a  further  development\r\n\r\nplan? If this is a way of saving money, then I  say\r\n\r\nthis Government is not competent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I thought the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nis a reasonable man, but evidently --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> He is like the former Member for\r\n\r\nThomson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Yes. The Member for Thomson runs\r\n\r\ntrue to course. Perhaps he has not had the advantage\r\n\r\nof  serving in the Government to realise that before\r\n\r\ndrawing  up  a Budget it was necessary for  estimate\r\n\r\nfigures  to  have  been  decided  earlier  on.   For\r\n\r\nexample, for 1964, the estimated figures should have\r\n\r\nbeen  submitted sometime in February/March of  1963\r\n\r\nbefore  you  can  produce the 1964  Budget.  It  has\r\n\r\nalready been explained that it is one thing to  draw\r\n\r\nup a plan, but then you might encounter difficulties\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Development Planning  Committee  may  not\r\n\r\napprove  certain projects, although they  have  gone\r\n\r\ninto  the  plan,  because there are other  items  of\r\n\r\nhigher  priority  which have to  be  proceeded  with\r\n\r\nfirst.  So I have tried to explain that the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance has already revealed that in the  first\r\n\r\nFour-Year Plan (1961-64) for the Ministry of  Health\r\n\r\nthe  percentage of achievement - if we turn  to  col.\r\n\r\n112  of Hansard of 28th November, 1963 - showed  that\r\n\r\ncapital development for Health reached only  28  per\r\n\r\ncent.  There have been a number of plans which  just\r\n\r\ndid  not  take off from the ground. But the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance was kind enough at least to me  as  the\r\n\r\nnew Minister for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth  - to  indicate that there  were  certain  big\r\n\r\nprojects  which,  although  scrubbed  out  from  the\r\n\r\n1961-64  Plan, could be reconsidered  for  the  next\r\n\r\nFive-Year Plan; in other words, 1965-69. But after I\r\n\r\nhave  had the opportunity of reviewing the position,\r\n\r\nthere is no reason why I will not be able to satisfy\r\n\r\nmy  Minister  for  Finance that this  is  an  urgent\r\n\r\nproject  which must get the green light in 1964,  by\r\n\r\nwhich  time I can come back to this House  again  to\r\n\r\nseek  additional funds to proceed with this project.\r\n\r\nThat is why I have said that when that time comes, I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Opposition Members opposite will  support\r\n\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health has explained matters clearly to\r\n\r\nthe Member for Thomson. I would like to give them  a\r\n\r\nbit of fatherly advice, Sir. They have been here  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly for just one week. The  Budget  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  complicated business. This process of a  token\r\n\r\nvote  is  obviously a mystery which. I think,  they\r\n\r\nshould try to understand instead of launching out on\r\n\r\ntirades  against the Government without evidence  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  failure. As far as they  are  concerned,\r\n\r\nSir, they should regard themselves as wolf cubs  and\r\n\r\ngirl guides --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W.

I have asked this\r\n\r\nAssembly right from the start of this Session not to\r\n\r\nindulge in these personal attacks. One attack  leads\r\n\r\nto  another,  and we will never get anywhere  except\r\n\r\nthat  some Members may lose their temper.

For example, in respect  of  Works  and\r\n\r\nBuildings the original Plan Cost was $1,900,000  but\r\n\r\nup  to the end of this year only about $200,000  has\r\n\r\nbeen  spent,  i.e. the work carried out  amounts  to\r\n\r\nabout  ten per cent of the provision. For next year,\r\n\r\nthe  expenditure is estimated at $105,000,  and  the\r\n\r\nwork  yet to be completed is estimated at about  $1\ufffd\r\n\r\nmillion. In respect of Furniture and Equipment,  the\r\n\r\noriginal  Plan was to spend $300,000 but up  to  the\r\n\r\nend  of  this year, $90,000 only has been  expended,\r\n\r\ni.e. roughly  about  30 per cent  of  the  original\r\n\r\nestimate.  For  next  year, this  estimate  is  only\r\n\r\n$12,000, which is an even less figure. I do not know\r\n\r\nwhether  the Government consider that these Maternal\r\n\r\nand  Child Health Centres are not important for  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  the people. The rural people  including\r\n\r\nmothers  and school children have to travel far  for\r\n\r\nmedical care. They have to spend money and find time\r\n\r\nto go to the clinics, and if the clinics are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncrowded,  they  have to queue up. This  is  a  great\r\n\r\ninconvenience  to  them. Why do the  Government  not\r\n\r\ntake care of them properly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not agree\r\n\r\nwith  the Member for Jurong when he states  that  we\r\n\r\nare  not  doing  enough in respect of  Maternal  and\r\n\r\nChild  Health Centres in Singapore. It is just  like\r\n\r\nthe  opening  of out-patient clinics throughout  the\r\n\r\nisland.  It  is true that Maternal and Child  Health\r\n\r\nCentres  need not necessarily be staffed by doctors,\r\n\r\nbut  we  still require certain doctors to  supervise\r\n\r\nthe  work  of  nurses and midwives. So here  is  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of whether there is an adequate supply  of\r\n\r\nstaff.  I  think the shortage of trained  staff,  be\r\n\r\nthey  doctors, nurses, midwives, health nurses,  and\r\n\r\nso  on,  is  a matter that has to be put  right.  An\r\n\r\nattempt was made to put it right, but I think we can\r\n\r\nstill make greater efforts in that direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, in all, something like 58 Maternal and\r\n\r\nChild   Health   Centres  throughout  Singapore   as\r\n\r\ndistinct  from  out-patient clinics  which,  I  have\r\n\r\npreviously said, number 32. There are ten, what  are\r\n\r\nknown as urban type clinics in the city area. But  I\r\n\r\nbelieve the Member for Jurong was talking about poor\r\n\r\nrural  folk having to travel long distances  as  the\r\n\r\ncentres are so far away. There are 24 clinics in the\r\n\r\nrural areas. I will now call them out to satisfy the\r\n\r\nMember for Jurong - they are all over the island  and\r\n\r\nnot close to the city area where they have to travel\r\n\r\nby bus over long distances:\r\n\r\n<pre> \r\n\r\n                  14\ufffd m.s.

For  the\r\n\r\nyear  1962, these infant welfare centres had to deal\r\n\r\nwith  427,000 infants of the age when they were born\r\n\r\ntill  one year old. For children over one year  old.\r\n\r\nthe number attending was 733,000. There were tens of\r\n\r\nthousands  of  mothers. I am sure there  are  always\r\n\r\nworried  fathers who come along to these clinics.  I\r\n\r\nhave  visited some of these Maternal and  Child  Health\r\n\r\nCentres   during  the  present  cholera  inoculation\r\n\r\nmonth, and I know how the people crowd there.  There\r\n\r\nare  a  number  of  yelling  babies  and  distraught\r\n\r\nparents - mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, aunties\r\n\r\nand  all - who turn up at our centres.

The P.A.P. had agreed in their  type  of\r\n\r\nmerger  arrangements  to give  $30  million  to  the\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories. According to them,  both  sides\r\n\r\nhad  won in the struggle.

If  the  Borneo territories  cannot  find\r\n\r\nworkers   and  have  to  import  them   from   other\r\n\r\ncountries, it will be a great blow to the workers in\r\n\r\nthe  Borneo  territories. I do not know whether  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. wish to create disharmony among the  workers\r\n\r\nin  the Borneo territories and workers in Singapore.\r\n\r\nOn  the other hand, we do not believe that Singapore\r\n\r\ncan  send  workers to the Borneo territories,  since\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance has admitted that it is not\r\n\r\neasy   to   send  our  workers  there.

Therefore, I should like to know whether the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture will increase the scope of  T.V.\r\n\r\nprogrammes  so that they will be at par  with  radio\r\n\r\nbroadcasts  in each of the language streams,  as  is\r\n\r\nthe  case  with Radio Singapore, so that  the  Malay\r\n\r\nprogrammes on T.V. can be increased. At the  moment,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, there are practically  no  Malay\r\n\r\nfilms   shown  on  television,  and  although   T.V.\r\n\r\nSingapura  telecasts quite a good number  of  Indian\r\n\r\nand Chinese films, for the Malay service only Kalong\r\n\r\nSenandong and Dondang Sayang are telecast.  I  would\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister  for Culture whether  more  Malay\r\n\r\nfilms could be telecast in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Television\r\n\r\nSingapura is quite conscious of the fact that at the\r\n\r\nmoment there is no adequate provision for programmes\r\n\r\nin  all  the  language streams, in  particular,  the\r\n\r\nMalay and Indian programmes. Of the 61 hours a  week\r\n\r\nthat  we  broadcast over T.V. Singapura, only  about\r\n\r\none-fifth   of  that  time  is  devoted   to   Malay\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  Now, the reason for this is  that  very\r\n\r\nfew  feature films in Malay are available. In  fact,\r\n\r\nsome  time  ago,  we tried very  hard  to  get  some\r\n\r\nfeature  films  but only succeeded in  getting  some\r\n\r\nvery  old films of such poor quality that there were\r\n\r\nprotests  from the listeners and we had to  withdraw\r\n\r\nthem from exhibition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, unlike English and Chinese films\r\n\r\nwhich are produced extensively both in Hong Kong and\r\n\r\nSingapore,  Malay  films are produced  only  in  two\r\n\r\nstudios  in Singapore, and they cater for a  limited\r\n\r\nand  competitive market in the country.  It  is  not\r\n\r\npossible for these two studios to provide recent and\r\n\r\nup-to-date Malay films at low rentals for use by our\r\n\r\nT.V.,  as this will spoil their cinema market.  They\r\n\r\ndo  spend a lot of capital in producing these films.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  film  companies  concerned  have  now\r\n\r\nagreed  that  Television Singapura  can  show  films\r\n\r\nwhich  are  more  than five years  old,  provided  a\r\n\r\nreasonable   price   is   paid.   At   the   moment,\r\n\r\nnegotiations  are in progress. A further  difficulty\r\n\r\nwhich may be of interest to the Barisan is that,  as\r\n\r\na  result of confrontation, we are not able  to  get\r\n\r\nthe  more  wholesome Indonesian films for exhibition\r\n\r\nin this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture is conscious of the\r\n\r\nshortage  and is trying to rectify it in  two  ways.\r\n\r\nOne  is by trying to produce more live entertainment\r\n\r\nin  Malay,  and when we have extra studio facilities\r\n\r\nand  more  equipment, I think we should be  able  to\r\n\r\nprovide  more  live entertainment in Malay  for  our\r\n\r\nMalay listeners. At the moment, out of six hours  of\r\n\r\nprogramme  entirely  in  Malay,  half  of  them  are\r\n\r\nentertainment features\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproduced  exclusively  by Television  Singapura,  and\r\n\r\nthese exclude sub-titling of other films in Malay  or\r\n\r\ncommentary in Malay over the second sound channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason why this position may be somewhat\r\n\r\nrectified is that with the introduction of television\r\n\r\nin Kuala Lumpur, and later in all the principal towns\r\n\r\nin Malaya, it will be possible to exchange programmes\r\n\r\nto  increase the output of Malay films which will  be\r\n\r\nmade  available to Television Singapura. I also  hope\r\n\r\nthat  with the introduction of commercial television,\r\n\r\nwe  may  be  able  to prevail upon certain  firms  to\r\n\r\nsponsor live shows in Malay and in other languages to\r\n\r\nmeet the inadequacy of films.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things I would like to point out is\r\n\r\nthat,  I  am  told,  to have one  minute  showing  on\r\n\r\nTelevision Singapura - a feature or a film you see for\r\n\r\none  minute - involves work up to 8 hours to 12  hours.\r\n\r\nSo  you see, Sir, the difficulty of our being able to\r\n\r\nproduce enough entertainment to fill 60 hours a week.\r\n\r\nI  hope this explanation will satisfy the questioner.\r\n\r\nI would like to assure Members that, on its part, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture  will  try  to  concentrate  on\r\n\r\nincreasing the programmes in Malay and Tamil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

He\r\n\r\ntalked  about anti-Communism. The P.A.P. are  using\r\n\r\nthe people's money to carry out activities which are\r\n\r\nnot  beneficial to the people. The sufferings of our\r\n\r\npeople  at present are due to the P.A.P.'s  betrayal\r\n\r\nand  their  activities  which  do  not  benefit  the\r\n\r\npeople. Today,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  the people want is that the Government  should\r\n\r\nreally  look after their livelihood and  to  improve\r\n\r\ntheir  livelihood and not talk about  anti-Communism\r\n\r\nin order to serve the P.A.P.'s interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The P.A.P. have been using the people's money\r\n\r\nto  train their own Party's cadres. We have no doubt\r\n\r\nthat  the P.A.P. are using this $1 million to  train\r\n\r\ntheir  own Party's cadres.

It is because they see  the  long-term  danger  to  themselves. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  the number of youths amounts to something\r\n\r\nlike 300,000 and out of this number of young men and\r\n\r\nwomen,  only 10 per cent are under some proper  form\r\n\r\nof  organised youth movement, 90 per cent  are  not;\r\n\r\nand  it  is  in  this 90 per cent that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  their  stooges and other  Communist-front\r\n\r\norganisations have been working and,  to  give  them\r\n\r\ncredit,  working  very effectively - young  boys  and\r\n\r\ngirls coming out of primary schools, youths of  ages\r\n\r\n16,  17, at a loose end, their minds seduced by evil\r\n\r\nmen.  This  is  coming to an end, Mr Speaker,  Sir.\r\n\r\nTheir supremacy in that sector is now being directly\r\n\r\nthreatened by us. We are not going to apologise that\r\n\r\nwe  use  public  money, of course,  $1  million;  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, $10 million will be put forward for this.\r\n\r\nNot  for  the  P.A.P.  This is  a  democratic  youth\r\n\r\nmovement. We are going to put the whole resources of\r\n\r\nthe  State; money will not be spared; personnel will\r\n\r\nnot  be  spared,  and it is going to  be  a  roaring\r\n\r\nsuccess  as  we move into their enclave and  destroy\r\n\r\none  outpost after another. That is the way to fight\r\n\r\nthe  Communists. True, if they step over  the  limit\r\n\r\nthey  get nabbed, put aside, put out of harm's  way.\r\n\r\nThat will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngo  on.

But that is  not\r\n\r\nthe  decisive  method in the long run.  If  one  can\r\n\r\nemploy a mathematical jargon - that is necessary  but\r\n\r\nnot a sufficient condition of success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to go further than this, not only\r\n\r\nto  use  the prophylactic method of cleaning up  the\r\n\r\nfield whenever it gets contaminated, but it is  also\r\n\r\nfundamentally necessary that we should  provide  our\r\n\r\nyoung  men  and women with healthy activities  in  a\r\n\r\nwell-run,  well-managed and well-led youth movement.\r\n\r\nWe  have  spent some time thinking of the programme.\r\n\r\nThe  first training programme is already running  in\r\n\r\nthe  form of the Buona Vista Community Centre.  That\r\n\r\nis  not to train youth leaders but to train  people\r\n\r\nwho  will train youth leaders. And so the thing will\r\n\r\ngo on. Eventually we will have something like 10,000\r\n\r\ntrained youth leaders and we will deploy them in all\r\n\r\nfields,  winkle  out the Communists  from  each  and\r\n\r\nevery  enclave,  be it in the trade  unions,  be  it\r\n\r\namong the farmers, be it in the schools. We have the\r\n\r\nresources,  we have men of ability and  intelligence\r\n\r\nto  destroy  the  last vestiges of  their  influence\r\n\r\namong  the young in Singapore. That is why they  are\r\n\r\nworried. That is why they say it is of no benefit to\r\n\r\nthe  people.  It is of no benefit to the Communists.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, we are not in power to do  things\r\n\r\nfor  the  benefit of the Communists.

I think there is grave doubt as  to\r\n\r\nwhether  the  P.A.P. Ministers  are  able  to  train\r\n\r\nproper  leaders in the youth field. In the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour's speech he has used vulgar and  abusive\r\n\r\nlanguage.  In spite of our challenge as  to  whether\r\n\r\nthey  can  say that our Party is controlled  by  the\r\n\r\nCommunists,  he  has  not  accepted  our  challenge.\r\n\r\nInstead, he is dumbfounded at our challenge. On  the\r\n\r\nother hand, however, he is trying to make use of the\r\n\r\ncase  of public assistance to refute our allegation.\r\n\r\nThe  Parliamentary  Secretary to  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nSocial Affairs said a few days ago that he wanted to\r\n\r\nproduce evidence to show how much the Government had\r\n\r\ndone.

If  they\r\n\r\nreally  can do it, produce sufficient evidence.  But\r\n\r\nthey mention Communism just to call a dog a bad name\r\n\r\nand  hang  him.

In  these\r\n\r\nfive  items, that is, from subhead 13 to subhead  17\r\n\r\nwe  discover that, in so far as the school  building\r\n\r\nprogramme  is concerned, it has not been implemented\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily and to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfullest  possible extent. Why? Perhaps it is because\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance, in making the  estimates,\r\n\r\nonly  wants  to  have  some big figures  to  impress\r\n\r\nothers. For example, our Minister for Education  has\r\n\r\nbeen  boasting about the fact that one-third of  our\r\n\r\nexpenditure  goes  to education. But  what  are  the\r\n\r\nfacts?  The facts are they are only able to  produce\r\n\r\nbig  figures  but they are not able to complete  the\r\n\r\nprogramme. We have already calculated that in  these\r\n\r\nfive sub-heads a total provision of $46 million  has\r\n\r\nbeen  made. But let us calculate some more  figures.\r\n\r\nIn  the  past  four years what has been  spent?  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has only spent $11 million  against  the\r\n\r\ntotal  figure  of $46 million. And what  about  next\r\n\r\nyear,  1964? Well they are going to have an estimate\r\n\r\nof  $13 million for the building of schools. In  the\r\n\r\npast  four  years  they were only able  to  use  $11\r\n\r\nmillion. Next year they are going to make use of $13\r\n\r\nmillion.  Now, even if we assume that the  programme\r\n\r\nfor  next year will be achieved and completed to the\r\n\r\nfullest  extent,  the provision for school  building\r\n\r\ncan  only  be used up to only half the total  amount\r\n\r\nprovided, and that is $22 million. We wish  to  know\r\n\r\nwhy  this should be the position. Is it because they\r\n\r\nwant to bring up big figures - impressive figures - to\r\n\r\nshow  that they have achieved a great deal? But,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  they  do not have an overall plan to  utilise\r\n\r\nthe  money provided to the fullest possible  extent.\r\n\r\nThey   cannot   fulfil   the  programme.   So   this\r\n\r\ndevelopment  estimate is, if I  may  use  a  Chinese\r\n\r\nproverb,  \"to smack your own face so that  you  will\r\n\r\nappear to be normal when, in fact, you are swollen.\"\r\n\r\nThen he will have some plaster put on the muscles of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Education and he will  then  start\r\n\r\nshowing  the people his artificial muscles.  In  the\r\n\r\nend  when  he moves his arms the plaster will  fall.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the analogy that I wish to draw, the  fact\r\n\r\nthat they are able to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmake  use  of one-quarter of the amount provided  in\r\n\r\nthe  school  building programme.

But I can tell the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson  to  refer  back  to  Hansard  of  29th\r\n\r\nNovember, 1963, col. 132, wherein it was stated that\r\n\r\nthe  back  of the problem of inadequate schools  and\r\n\r\nteachers,  of  the  shortage of  homes,  houses  and\r\n\r\nflats, had been broken. Sir, if he will now turn  to\r\n\r\nthe  Hansard  again, to the Minister  for  Finance's\r\n\r\nBudget  address  of 28th November, 1963,  col.  112,\r\n\r\nTable   VI,  under  Social  Development,   item   2,\r\n\r\nEducation,  Capital Outlay, the Plan  Provision  was\r\n\r\n$94.48  million. I believe the Member said only  $48\r\n\r\nmillion, so it is only one-half. So he has his facts\r\n\r\nwrong by 50 per cent. The Plan Estimates came to $73\r\n\r\nmillion,  the Actual Outlay $32 million,  which  was\r\n\r\nonly 44 per cent of achievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Member for Thomson is true to himself\r\n\r\nand  true to the people of Singapore, and knows  how\r\n\r\nto  use public money, far from making fun of me,  he\r\n\r\nshould congratulate me on the fact that with 44  per\r\n\r\ncent  achievement  I have broken  the  back  of  the\r\n\r\nschool problem in Singapore. There is no question of\r\n\r\nfalsifying  figures  and pretending  to  be  bigger.\r\n\r\nNaturally,  we  would  like  to  be  bold  to   make\r\n\r\nestimates   for   a  country  that  attained   self-government  4\ufffd years ago, in 1959, for  a  popularly\r\n\r\nelected    government   to   shoulder   the    whole\r\n\r\nresponsibility for education, which was  never  done\r\n\r\nin the past, and that it was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossible to achieve it with only 50 per cent of what\r\n\r\nwe wanted to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

One\r\n\r\nmust always consider that this is public money,  and\r\n\r\nevery cent must be carefully accounted for, and  if\r\n\r\nit  is possible to achieve it at half the cost, then\r\n\r\nI  think  it  is  time  that they  woke  up  and  be\r\n\r\nresponsible and not say time and again that they are\r\n\r\nunsatisfied,  that everything is wrong.  It  is  far\r\n\r\nfrom  me  to claim credit because it is the teamwork\r\n\r\nof  this Government which is dedicated to serve  the\r\n\r\npeople,   the  true  interests  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore, and not the disloyal manner in which  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  have claimed that they would speak for  and\r\n\r\nrepresent the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nex-Minister  for  Education,  namely,  the   present\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Health,  when  we  were   discussing\r\n\r\nquestions relating to the Health Ministry, was quite\r\n\r\ncalm.  But now he appears as though we have  wronged\r\n\r\nhim.  And he used excitable words - words of  feeling\r\n\r\nand   emotion  - and  he  spoke  with  emotion,   and\r\n\r\nvociferously attacked us in his reply. But there are\r\n\r\na  few  points I would like to clarify, namely,  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expenditure on  education.  First,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health was wrong in listening to us.  I\r\n\r\nsaid  that  $46  million was used in building  - Head\r\n\r\nD40,  subheads 13 to 17. I was talking about  school\r\n\r\nbuilding, and not on the whole development programme\r\n\r\nfor  education. So the Minister was wrong in getting\r\n\r\nat  me.  I only talked about capital expenditure  on\r\n\r\nbuilding  schools. As we have said, you cannot  show\r\n\r\nthat  you  have  any  achievements  by  giving   out\r\n\r\nfigures.  The Minister for Health told us  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government have achieved much in the field of\r\n\r\neducation  and the money has been put  to  practical\r\n\r\nuse. I would like to ask this. Recently there was  a\r\n\r\nnews  item  in  the newspaper that, from  next  year\r\n\r\nonwards those students wanting to go\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto secondary grammar schools would have no place and\r\n\r\nthey  would  be  given  accommodation  in  technical\r\n\r\nschools  instead.  On  this  I  would  ask  why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have not made full use of the  money  to\r\n\r\nbuild  secondary  grammar schools  to  enable  these\r\n\r\nstudents to study. Why should there be no places  in\r\n\r\nsuch secondary grammar schools? This is not the  way\r\n\r\nto save money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year $13 million will have to be spent on\r\n\r\nbuilding  schools. A remaining sum  of  $22  million\r\n\r\nfrom  the  past Five-Year Development Plan  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen used. What is the use of voting for this amount\r\n\r\nif  the money is not put to full use? As a result of\r\n\r\nthis, students next year will have no schools to  go\r\n\r\nto.  Now  this is a fact. I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister to answer this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Member for Thomson tries to\r\n\r\npick  on a little technical point, which is  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  just because it was necessary for the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education  to state that some of those  who  had\r\n\r\npassed  the  Primary  VI  examination  in  1963  and\r\n\r\nwishing to join secondary academic schools in  1964,\r\n\r\nbut   are  being  posted  temporarily  to  secondary\r\n\r\ntechnical  schools,  secondary  vocational  schools,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  it is badly planned. This is just  utter\r\n\r\nnonsense because a secondary school, whether  it  is\r\n\r\nvocational,  academic or technical, is  a  secondary\r\n\r\nschool  and  they  will be learning common  subjects\r\n\r\nmost  of  the  time, in addition to other  subjects,\r\n\r\nspecially  for  vocational,  academic  or  technical\r\n\r\nschools.   The   buildings,  the   facilities,   the\r\n\r\nlaboratories and the teachers will be there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we have to deal with a secondary school\r\n\r\npopulation that has increased by nearly 100 per cent\r\n\r\nwithin four years, surely it is just like asking the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson  to buy a new  pair  of  shoes.\r\n\r\nSometimes when it twitches the little toe,  it  does\r\n\r\nnot mean that you should throw the shoe away. I mean\r\n\r\nwith  a  new  pair of shoes it will be necessary  to\r\n\r\nbreak  it  in  and,  in course of time,  when  other\r\n\r\nschools are built - it takes almost a year to build a\r\n\r\nnew school - then they could be sent to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe new schools. But what is important is that every\r\n\r\nchild  leaving a primary school has at least another\r\n\r\ntwo  years of secondary education. In Singapore  for\r\n\r\nthe  first  time in its history, it is possible  for\r\n\r\nevery school-going child to be in school right up to\r\n\r\nthe  age  of 15 plus. And even in advanced countries\r\n\r\nlike  the  United Kingdom with compulsory  education\r\n\r\nfor  umpteen years, they have not been able to raise\r\n\r\nthe  school leaving age from 14 plus to 16 plus.  So\r\n\r\nit  is  such a small technical point to say  because\r\n\r\nthe  children  are being posted not to  a  secondary\r\n\r\nacademic school but to a secondary technical  school\r\n\r\nand  to a secondary vocational school, therefore the\r\n\r\nEducation Ministry has failed. This is just  wasting\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere was one question which received no answer. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  been allotted  so  much  money  for\r\n\r\neducation  but  they  use the money  for  propaganda\r\n\r\npurposes. Why are the Government trying to show that\r\n\r\nthey  have been using the money on education instead\r\n\r\nof  making a full admission that the money has  been\r\n\r\nspent on propaganda purposes? This only goes to show\r\n\r\nthat  the plan is merely a plan which is not drafted\r\n\r\naccording to practical needs, because we cannot deny\r\n\r\nthat certain students will not get a place in school\r\n\r\nnext  year.  This has been printed in the newspaper.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a news item. When the Minister is unable  to\r\n\r\ngive  a  reply, he will say nonsense. His reason  is\r\n\r\none  which  amounts to nonsense. Those are  all  the\r\n\r\nreasons  he can advance. I was quoting from  a  news\r\n\r\nitem.  I  wish  to  know whether the  Government  in\r\n\r\ndrafting this plan wanted only to make use of it  as\r\n\r\na means of propaganda when, in actual fact, they did\r\n\r\nnot know how to put the money to good use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> I\r\n\r\nthink the important thing is whether every child  in\r\n\r\nSingapore who wants to go to school can find a place\r\n\r\nin  school.  I  say for the last 4\ufffd  years  we  have\r\n\r\nmanaged to expand the building programme to such  an\r\n\r\nextent  that we are able to find a place  for  every\r\n\r\nchild who wants to learn.

For the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson  to  allege that there are  not  enough\r\n\r\nsecondary schools for the primary school leavers  is\r\n\r\njust not true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the important thing is to satisfy the needs of school children - if we can spend 50 per cent of the provision in the Estimates and yet satisfy the needs of the people - that proves that we are more efficient, we can effect economy. So the Member should give us the credit. Instead, he is\r\n\r\nrunning  down the Government. And Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nfollowing  his line of argument, it would mean  that\r\n\r\nthe Government of the People's Republic of China and\r\n\r\nthe  Soviet  Socialist Republic are most incompetent\r\n\r\nand  inefficient, because their Five-Year  Plan  has\r\n\r\nbeen subject to revision year after year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis never like figures, I mean,\r\n\r\nstatistical  figures, for these figures always  nail\r\n\r\nthe  lies  of  the Barisan Sosialis.  There  are  in\r\n\r\nSingapore today 464,000 children in our schools  and\r\n\r\nthere will be more next year. And of this figure  25\r\n\r\nper  cent  are in our secondary schools.  Now,  this\r\n\r\nmeans that one in every four of our population is in\r\n\r\nschool. This is a record not to be surpassed in  any\r\n\r\nof  the emerging nations in South-East Asia. 48  new\r\n\r\nschools with 1,035 classrooms and accommodation  for\r\n\r\n85,000  pupils have been built since 1960. Of these,\r\n\r\n30  are primary schools and 18 secondary schools. In\r\n\r\naddition,  eight primary and secondary schools  were\r\n\r\nfurther  extended. Today there is a place for  every\r\n\r\nchild   who  registers  for  admission  in   primary\r\n\r\nschools.  Similarly everyone who passes the  primary\r\n\r\nschool leaving examination will be found a place  in\r\n\r\nsecondary  school, an achievement that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis'  country of adoption can  only  dream  of.\r\n\r\nConfrontation notwithstanding, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  a\r\n\r\nfurther  26  new  schools are due to be  constructed\r\n\r\nnext   year.  In  addition,  12  new  schools,  five\r\n\r\nprimary,   three   vocational  and  four   secondary\r\n\r\ntechnical  schools, will be functioning  in  January\r\n\r\n1964.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers of the P.A.P. are wont to use figures\r\n\r\nand  statistics to argue against any reasons or talk\r\n\r\nadvanced  by  the Opposition.

Now  I  will try to expose the  Minister's\r\n\r\nstatistics by facts, no matter how he boasts of  his\r\n\r\nachievements in education. Boasting that every child\r\n\r\nwho  wishes  to  go  to school will  have  a  place.\r\n\r\nBoasting  that the money has been put to  full  use.\r\n\r\nLet  me  now  recount what I have  seen  in  my  own\r\n\r\nconstituency,   the  situation  and  conditions   in\r\n\r\ncertain schools in my own constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the 8 m.s. Tampines Road, there is a school\r\n\r\ncalled  Ling  Long  School which  has  already  been\r\n\r\nestablished for 40 years up till now. But  when  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. came  into  office, the  principal  of  this\r\n\r\nschool  was sacked. This happened in 1961.  In  1962\r\n\r\nthis  school  was  dissolved  by  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation, the reason being that the school did  not\r\n\r\nconform to sanitary and hygienic conditions and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education has been  wont  to  do  such\r\n\r\nthings  as a pretext to dissolve a school.  But  why\r\n\r\ndid the Ministry not allot some money to improve the\r\n\r\nconditions of such schools? This particular  school,\r\n\r\nafter  being dissolved for this reason, was absorbed\r\n\r\nin  1963 into an integrated English school. When the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister toured the rural areas,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  few  hundred rural people in that area petitioned\r\n\r\nhim  to  consider their request to run this  school,\r\n\r\nbut up till now there has been no news.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This school has now been confiscated by the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the site is used for the expansion of\r\n\r\nthe Airport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more important than education? How many\r\n\r\nstudents  have lost their education because  of  the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of  the Airport? Some  of  them  have  no\r\n\r\nfurther   opportunity  of  continuing   with   their\r\n\r\neducation;  some  of  them have been  absorbed  into\r\n\r\nEnglish schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give another instance which I know of and\r\n\r\nlet  me  state  the facts. At the 8\ufffd  m.s.  Tampines\r\n\r\nRoad, there is a school called It Sun School. A  few\r\n\r\ndays ago, the student enrolment was filled, and many\r\n\r\nchildren  wishing to enrol were unable to  register.\r\n\r\nSome of them were forced to enrol in English schools\r\n\r\nvery  far  away  from  their  homes.  Many  of   the\r\n\r\nvillagers  in this area wanted to extend the  school\r\n\r\nbuilding,  but the educational authorities  did  not\r\n\r\ngive  them  the necessary permission  and  aid,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, in respect of building expenses, financial\r\n\r\naid and the acquisition of the land which is part of\r\n\r\nPang Koh Estate. I would ask the Government: do  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  dare acquire this piece of  land  to  be\r\n\r\nused as a site for a school?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other instances. For example, when\r\n\r\na  child  is already in school, his or her  brothers\r\n\r\nand  sisters also want to be admitted into the  same\r\n\r\nschool. But the schools do not take this point  into\r\n\r\nconsideration. If the enrolment is full, the child's\r\n\r\nsisters  and  brothers  have  no  chance  of   being\r\n\r\nadmitted  into  the  same school.  This  is  another\r\n\r\ninstance  to  expose the talk of  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  just now. That is what I have to  say  on\r\n\r\neducation. [Interruption] If the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nwants  to have a debate with me, we can have  it  at\r\n\r\nany time and at any place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, there is a saying that those whom the gods want\r\n\r\nto  destroy, they first make mad.

Let us come down to this debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): What is important\r\n\r\nis  whether  the  Government have  shouldered  their\r\n\r\nresponsibility  in educating our future  generation.\r\n\r\nAnd  what  is  also important is whether  there  are\r\n\r\nenough places for school-going children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member talks of this school collapsing, and\r\n\r\nthat  old  schools have to make way for new schools.\r\n\r\nIf  a  school building is going to collapse, we must\r\n\r\nnot  allow it to collapse and so be a danger to  the\r\n\r\nchildren.  What is most important is  that  we  have\r\n\r\nprovided  enough  schools  to  accommodate  all  our\r\n\r\nchildren.  Let  me ask them: in the past,  how  many\r\n\r\nchildren  have had no places in schools? Today,  can\r\n\r\nyou tell me whether there are any children without a\r\n\r\nplace  in  school? If you can point out  one  single\r\n\r\ncase  of a child who has no place in a school,  then\r\n\r\nwe  are  prepared  to give you a cash  award.  As  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  fact,  in  the past four  difficult  and\r\n\r\ntumultuous years, the Government have been  able  to\r\n\r\nput  forward an education programme and to implement\r\n\r\nit with the least amount of money to produce maximum\r\n\r\nresults.  This  only shows that in the  Government's\r\n\r\neducation  policy, it is not necessary to spend  all\r\n\r\nthe  money  that  we have. It all depends  upon  our\r\n\r\nneeds. Our school building programme has to be drawn\r\n\r\nup  according to our needs. If the children are  all\r\n\r\naccommodated, in schools, it is pointless  to  build\r\n\r\nmore schools, as the schools will remain vacant  and\r\n\r\nthe  money  spent will be a waste. What is important\r\n\r\nis  that we must meet the educational needs  of  our\r\n\r\nchildren and their parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have been able to provide children\r\n\r\nplaces in primary schools or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecondary schools, the next step is to prevent those\r\n\r\nchildren  who  want  to create  trouble  -  such  as\r\n\r\nwanting  to  obstruct other children from  going  to\r\n\r\nschool  and  insulting their teachers. It  is  these\r\n\r\nchildren who are not allowed in school. In order  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  our  education system and our  children's\r\n\r\nright  to go to school and sit for examinations,  we\r\n\r\nwill give them every facility and help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that in the past four years, notwithstanding\r\n\r\nstrikes  and boycotts which were instigated  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, we were still able to  carry  out\r\n\r\nour  school building programme. Our school  building\r\n\r\nprogramme is under the charge of a special committee\r\n\r\nand  the  Government are providing enough  money  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  the  programme. This achievement,  which\r\n\r\ncannot  he matched by any other country in Asia,  is\r\n\r\nonly possible under an efficient and good government\r\n\r\nof  a good Party. If we were to follow the advice of\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members,  then we might  have  to  spend\r\n\r\nevery  cent  of  our revenue on education.

But let us analyse their school\r\n\r\nbuilding  programme. What have they done?  In  item\r\n\r\n(1)   of subhead 16, Primary Schools, the 1963 School\r\n\r\nBuilding Programme has an original plan cost of $2.6\r\n\r\nmillion. But after three years, i.e. up to  the  end\r\n\r\nof  this  year, the money spent only amounts  to  $117,600. It is the same with other items.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government have not properly dealt with our\r\n\r\neducation   problem.   They   want   to   monopolise\r\n\r\neducation, yet they have achieved nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that they have built many schools, and that every school-going child has a place in school. But what is the attitude towards some of the aided schools which lack proper sanitary conditions? Now, for these schools the Government must give them financial aid to improve their school\r\n\r\nbuilding and their sanitary conditions, because they\r\n\r\nare   helping  the  Government  to  implement  their\r\n\r\neducation  policy. But instead the  Government  have\r\n\r\nbanned  and  closed  down  all  these  schools.  And\r\n\r\ntowards certain Chinese schools in the rural  areas,\r\n\r\nfor example, many parents in the past wanted to send\r\n\r\ntheir  children to these schools, but these  schools\r\n\r\nhad  no  places for them. So the parents wanted  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to extend the school buildings,  but  the\r\n\r\nGovernment ignored them. The management committee of\r\n\r\nthe  school  applied for permission  to  extend  the\r\n\r\nschool  buildings, but instead of helping  them  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  tried  to  obstruct  their  application.\r\n\r\nThere  was  an example in which some of  the  school\r\n\r\nauthorities  submitted plans for extension  but  the\r\n\r\nauthorities  always tried to delay  approval.  After\r\n\r\nsome   years   when  approval  finally   came,   the\r\n\r\nmanagement  committee tried to raise funds  for  the\r\n\r\nextension  of  the  school but the Government  would\r\n\r\nthen forget their dollar-for-dollar aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So as a result of this delay in giving aid, the\r\n\r\nschool  management  committee  will  have  to  raise\r\n\r\nfurther  funds.  Now, why must the Government  adopt\r\n\r\nsuch  an  attitude?  Is  it because  the  management\r\n\r\ncommittee  does  not  deserve  any  help  from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the Government have put forward many  plans\r\n\r\nand programmes. The figures showing how much we have\r\n\r\nachieved in our school programme will nail  all  the\r\n\r\nfalsehoods  put forward by the Barisan Sosialis.  We\r\n\r\nhave heard the Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTampines repeating himself again and again about the\r\n\r\nBeng  Lun  School, but the fact is that he has  been\r\n\r\nunable to bring up facts to refute our achievements;\r\n\r\nhe  keeps on frying the rice and making use  of  the\r\n\r\nsame  material over and over again. Now, in view  of\r\n\r\nthis repetition, I have to stand up to reply to  his\r\n\r\npoint about the Beng Lun School. He says that in his\r\n\r\nconstituency  the  Government built  a  new  English\r\n\r\nschool  next  to Beng Lun School to  take  over  the\r\n\r\nchildren from the Chinese school. Is this  a  fact?\r\n\r\nHow  far  is  this  true? I want  to  enlighten  him\r\n\r\nfurther on this matter, because I think I know about\r\n\r\nthis case better than he does. As far as I know, the\r\n\r\nposition regarding the Beng Lun School is this.  The\r\n\r\nschool building is in very bad shape and in fact  it\r\n\r\nwas  originally an unauthorised structure. It was  a\r\n\r\nshophouse which was later turned into a school,  but\r\n\r\nafter  some years of disrepair, it could not  comply\r\n\r\nwith the health regulations; it was on the point  of\r\n\r\ncollapsing.  So in order to safeguard the  lives  of\r\n\r\nthe  school  children and to ensure that they  could\r\n\r\nstudy in better circumstances, the Government put up\r\n\r\na school in its neighbourhood. This new school which\r\n\r\nwas  put  up  is  not  an  English  school,  but  an\r\n\r\nintegrated  school,  so on the  completion  of  this\r\n\r\nschool, the Beng Lun School, which was on the  point\r\n\r\nof  collapsing,  was not allowed to  exist.  So  the\r\n\r\nchildren  of  this  school were transferred  to  the\r\n\r\nintegrated  school and they continued  to  study  in\r\n\r\nChinese. The teachers were also transferred to  this\r\n\r\nintegrated  school. In fact, the  principal  himself\r\n\r\nwas also transferred as the principal of the Chinese\r\n\r\nsection of the same integrated school. Now, this  is\r\n\r\nthe  treatment that we give to Chinese schools.  Can\r\n\r\nyou  say that this is unfair treatment? Can you say\r\n\r\nthat this treatment calls for any unfair criticism?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the facts that I have stated show clearly that\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Members  do not  understand  the  true\r\n\r\nposition of the school. I ask them: do they want  to\r\n\r\nwait  until the school building collapses  and  then\r\n\r\nsome  of the school children are killed in order  to\r\n\r\ngive them an excuse to attack the Government? If\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  is  their desire, then I do not know  what  to\r\n\r\nsay!

Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government are expending a considerable amount of money on constructing Bus Bays and Vehicle Parks and Bus Shelters for the\r\n\r\npeople  who  are in need of such social  facilities.\r\n\r\nThe   Government  are  constructing  these  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of drivers and conductors who are  doing  a\r\n\r\nuseful service to the people.

It  is  not surprising that  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong   Kembangan   should   have   alleged   such\r\n\r\nincidents, because he has also linked this  up  with\r\n\r\nso-called  Communists. That is why, as he has  said,\r\n\r\nas  a  result,  the service provided  by  these  bus\r\n\r\nconductors and drivers has been so bad. I would like\r\n\r\nto  point out to the Member concerned that there  is\r\n\r\nno  question of the workers during their  period  of\r\n\r\nservice being rude to the passengers. If he wants to\r\n\r\nhave  orderly and good behaviour in the bus service,\r\n\r\nthis  should  not only be from one side.  We  should\r\n\r\nrealise   that  the  bus  conductors'  and  drivers'\r\n\r\nworking conditions are quite different from those in\r\n\r\nother  fields of work. While we are sleeping in  our\r\n\r\nbed,  these workers are on the road in their  buses.\r\n\r\nWhile  we  are  still dreaming in  our  beds,  these\r\n\r\nworkers  are  in  their buses  serving  the  general\r\n\r\npublic. Therefore, they have to work long hours  and\r\n\r\nare sometimes tired. They work during odd hours,  so\r\n\r\nwe  should  expect co-operation from the  Government\r\n\r\nand  the  Member concerned in particular. We  should\r\n\r\nnot  put  all the blame on the workers because  they\r\n\r\nhave  their  own difficulties. Before the Government\r\n\r\nlook   into   this  matter,  there   should   be   a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive plan to see that not only the workers,\r\n\r\nbut also the passengers, should be courteous. To put\r\n\r\nthe  blame only on the workers is not good. On  this\r\n\r\nmatter, I hope the Member for Kampong Kembangan will\r\n\r\nunderstand better. People who travel in cars usually\r\n\r\ndo  not  understand  the  difficulties  of  the  bus\r\n\r\nconductors.  It  is  usually difficult  to  work  in\r\n\r\ncrowded buses. For instance, if a bus conductor does\r\n\r\nnot  receive  the  exact amount  of  money  for  the\r\n\r\ntickets  issued,  he  might face  dismissal.  If  he\r\n\r\npunches the tickets\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwrongly   or  omits  to  punch  them,  he  is   held\r\n\r\nresponsible. Bus passengers and other people  should\r\n\r\nconsider all this. Due to their long hours of  work,\r\n\r\nthese  workers  can be moody or in a bad  temper.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the people will understand this. Even in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  we  see  that  the Ministers  and  Government\r\n\r\nBackbenchers  are not so polite and courteous  after\r\n\r\nall.  They  even use abusive and vulgar language  in\r\n\r\nthis  House.  So you should not blame  the  workers.\r\n\r\nThey  are  uneducated, unlike  the  Members  sitting\r\n\r\nopposite.  I  hope that whenever such  a  matter  is\r\n\r\nraised,  you should not put Communist caps on  their\r\n\r\nheads. [Laughter]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W.

But what I tried to say just now\r\n\r\nwas  that  we  should  also try  to  understand  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties of the conductors. We should understand\r\n\r\nthe  matter thoroughly and look at both sides of the\r\n\r\npicture.  We  should not try to blame everything  on\r\n\r\nthe  Communists. The Government should not  describe\r\n\r\nour  people  as wearing Communist caps  whenever  we\r\n\r\nraise a question.

So whenever there is rain, especially during\r\n\r\nthe   rainy  season,  the  passengers  suffer   much\r\n\r\ninconvenience. I hope the Government will see to  it\r\n\r\nthat  at  certain places where such  facilities  are\r\n\r\nrequired,  bus  shelters  will  be  built  for   the\r\n\r\nconvenience  of bus passengers. It looks  as  though\r\n\r\nthe  provision  of  $65,000 for  this  item  is  not\r\n\r\nenough. For instance, the Government should put some\r\n\r\nbenches  in Maternal and Child Health Clinics.  They\r\n\r\nshould also put benches at bus shelters in the rural\r\n\r\nareas.  This  is  necessary  because  sometimes  the\r\n\r\npeople have to wait for about half an hour and  they\r\n\r\nwill  have to stand all the time. In such cases,  if\r\n\r\nthere are pregnant women, they may find it difficult\r\n\r\nand  tiresome to remain standing for a long time.  I\r\n\r\nwill  be very glad if the Government will build more\r\n\r\nbus  shelters and provide benches at health  clinics\r\n\r\nin order to meet the convenience of these people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the\r\n\r\nMember for Jalan Kayu is sleeping all the time --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Some\r\n\r\ndays  ago  I  had  occasion to say that  Opposition \r\n\r\nMembers in the Barisan Sosialis work for the workers \r\n\r\nonly  in  theory. We in the N.T.U.C. work  for  the \r\n\r\nimprovement  of the lot of the workers in  Singapore \r\n\r\nand  the  world in general. We work in  a  practical \r\n\r\nway. So we know what is good and what is bad for the \r\n\r\nworkers. We also know the difficulties and otherwise \r\n\r\nof  the workers. This is because we the leaders  not \r\n\r\nonly say things but also go out to see for ourselves \r\n\r\nthe   difficult  conditions  of  the  workers.   For \r\n\r\nexample, we not only observe the work of bus drivers \r\n\r\nand  conductors  but  also bus  passengers  who  are \r\n\r\nmostly workers. It is our responsibility to see that \r\n\r\nthese workers - the good and the bad - really work  for \r\n\r\nthe  State.  We also observe those workers  who  are \r\n\r\nbeing  used  for the benefit of foreign powers.  For \r\n\r\nthat  reason,  we  know  the difficulties  of  these \r\n\r\nworkers. The main concern of the leaders of S.A.T.U. \r\n\r\nunions,  which are pro-Communist unions, is  now  to \r\n\r\ntopple the Government by usurping its power.  The  \r\n\r\nMember  for  Paya Lebar says  he  is  for  the workers.  \r\n\r\nBut  what has been done  by  the  S.A.T.U. unions is \r\n\r\nto work  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  leaders outside this country.

I  have\r\n\r\nstated  that the Member himself is not aware of  the\r\n\r\ntrue conditions of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to what we are debating, as has been\r\n\r\nsaid  by both sides of the House, we should not take\r\n\r\nthis   debate  as  an  opportunity  to   bring   out\r\n\r\nirrelevant  points. The Member for  Paya  Lebar  has\r\n\r\nsaid that this Assembly should give consideration to\r\n\r\nthe question of constructing better bus shelters  or\r\n\r\nbus  bays.  This, he says, is a joint responsibility\r\n\r\nof  this Assembly, as it is for the benefit  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  this country. The Member for Jalan  Kayu\r\n\r\nalso  says  that benches should be placed  at  these\r\n\r\nshelters,  I  do not know what he means by  benches.\r\n\r\nThroughout    Singapore,   the    Government    have\r\n\r\nconstructed bus shelters with benches for passengers\r\n\r\nto rest while waiting for their buses. If by benches\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Jalan Kayu means benches similar  to\r\n\r\narmchairs or sofas or even benches in this Assembly,\r\n\r\nthen I cannot understand his request. The people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore know that the use of a bus shelter  is  to\r\n\r\nprotect them from the rain or sun while waiting  for\r\n\r\ntheir  buses. I believe that if there is  a  request\r\n\r\nfrom  the  people  that  a  bus  shelter  should  be\r\n\r\nconstructed at any particular place, then I am  sure\r\n\r\nthe Government will construct one there, as has been\r\n\r\nthe  practice  in  the  past. This  is  because  the\r\n\r\nrequest  is  something for the people of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwho are loyal to this country and not to any foreign\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I feel\r\n\r\nthat if the Back-benches\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the  Government side were to adopt this kind  of\r\n\r\nattitude  in  dealing with our  questions,  then  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  a waste of time. Today, we want  to  look\r\n\r\ninto  whether what the Government have done is right\r\n\r\nor  wrong. There would be no meaning if they were to\r\n\r\ntreat  our questions in this manner. We raised  this\r\n\r\nquestion to inquire whether there are benches in bus\r\n\r\nshelters.  If there are none, the Government  should\r\n\r\nbuild  them.  There should also be bus  shelters  at\r\n\r\nmaternity centres. The Government cannot solve these\r\n\r\nproblems by treating our questions in this way.  The\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  has  not answered  our  questions.  The\r\n\r\nimportant   thing   is  whether  they   accept   our\r\n\r\nsuggestions or not. It is no use talking  about  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of shelters the Government have built.  This\r\n\r\nis   the  time  for  the  Opposition  Party  to  ask\r\n\r\nquestions.  The  Government  must  allow  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers  to ask questions. The Back-benchers  should\r\n\r\nnot  praise the Government by saying that they  have\r\n\r\ndone  this  and that for the people.

What  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Kampong Kembangan was saying was that the people\r\n\r\nwho  make use of the buses in the morning are  those\r\n\r\nwho are on their way to work. There are some who are\r\n\r\ngoing to the market. These are the people who cannot\r\n\r\nafford to go in big cars. They go about by bus.
