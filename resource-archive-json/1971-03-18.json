The number of such persons\r\n\r\nwho found employment has increased each year, from\r\n\r\n96  in 1966, 101 in 1967, 112 in 1968, 146 in 1969\r\n\r\nto 156 in 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the youths and boys, the main type of work\r\n\r\nfound  for  them  is manual work,  which  includes\r\n\r\ncasual    labourers,   shop   assistants,   hawker\r\n\r\nassistants,  petrol  kiosk  attendants,  sweepers,\r\n\r\nlorry  attendants, factory operatives, etc. A  few\r\n\r\nhave  been  placed in semi-skilled  jobs  such  as\r\n\r\nwelders, greasers and motor mechanics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the women and girls, the two main types of\r\n\r\nwork  found for them are domestic help and factory\r\n\r\noperatives.

Many of them  are  also  quite\r\n\r\nindifferent or unwilling to work, and  the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Department is doing everything possible to\r\n\r\nmotivate them and to get them accustomed  to  work\r\n\r\nby organising them into work squads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second part of the question on\r\n\r\nthe  employment of those under probation, the care\r\n\r\nand  supervision  of juvenile and adult  offenders\r\n\r\nplaced    on    probation   are   the    statutory\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  of the Probation  and  Aftercare\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  my  Ministry.  The  Probation   of\r\n\r\nOffenders  Ordinance provides the Courts  with  an\r\n\r\nalternative  method of dealing with offenders  who\r\n\r\nmight  otherwise  have  to  be  committed   to   a\r\n\r\ncorrective  or  penal  institution.  This   method\r\n\r\ninvolves  the conditional suspension of punishment\r\n\r\nwhile the offender is released under the care  and\r\n\r\nsupervision of a probation officer. The  probation\r\n\r\nsystem  has  over  the  years  proved  to  be   an\r\n\r\neffective   method   of  rehabilitating   selected\r\n\r\noffenders of both sexes and of all age groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to say that at any one time at least\r\n\r\n80   per  cent  of  the  adult  probationers   are\r\n\r\ngainfully  employed. In respect of the  employment\r\n\r\nof  juvenile probationers, the employment rate  is\r\n\r\nvery  much lower, at about 40 per cent. More often\r\n\r\nthan  not,  the juvenile probationer is too  young\r\n\r\nfor  employment.  In such cases every  attempt  is\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  probation  officer  to  secure  the\r\n\r\nprobationer's  connection  with  youth  clubs  and\r\n\r\ngenerally in useful pre-occupations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PERSONS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Training and employment)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

This\r\n\r\nscheme,  which is administered by the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour, provides training for disabled persons  in\r\n\r\norder  to  enable  them to regain  their  economic\r\n\r\nindependence.  Training is normally  given  for  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of six months initially, and this  may  be\r\n\r\nextended  for  a further three months.  A  monthly\r\n\r\nsubsistence allowance of $30 to $50 is payable  to\r\n\r\neach  trainee. Tuition fees and cost of  materials\r\n\r\nare   provided,  where  necessary.  In  1970,   31\r\n\r\ndisabled persons benefited from this scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many voluntary organisations are engaged in\r\n\r\nwelfare  work  among  the  physically  handicapped\r\n\r\ngroups,  such as the blind, the deaf, the spastic,\r\n\r\nthe  paraplegics,  and so on.  The  services  they\r\n\r\nprovide  are mainly educational, although some  of\r\n\r\nthese  organisations also have vocational training\r\n\r\nfacilities   for   those  physically   handicapped\r\n\r\npersons who are in the employable age group. These\r\n\r\norganisations  run training centres and  sheltered\r\n\r\nworkshops.  However,  these training  centres  and\r\n\r\nworkshops  are still in the process of development\r\n\r\nand   consequently   the  number   of   physically\r\n\r\nhandicapped persons they can cope with is limited.\r\n\r\nIn  1970, approximately 950 physically handicapped\r\n\r\nchildren and 100 adults received special education\r\n\r\nand  training at some 15 schools, training centres\r\n\r\nand    sheltered    workshops.    The    voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations are doing a good job in this field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to say whether the existing\r\n\r\ntraining facilities are adequate or otherwise,  as\r\n\r\nstatistics are still being compiled on the  number\r\n\r\nof physically handicapped persons who require such\r\n\r\ntraining. The Social Welfare Department has set up\r\n\r\na Rehabilitation Unit to liaise with the voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto help in the compilation of such statistics, and\r\n\r\nto   consider  the  need  for  expanding  existing\r\n\r\ntraining facilities. The unit is in the process of\r\n\r\ncompiling   a   central  register  of  handicapped\r\n\r\npersons  in  order  to obtain  relevant  data  for\r\n\r\nplanning purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rehabilitation Unit of the Social Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment is presently exploring ways  and  means\r\n\r\nby  which physically handicapped persons could  be\r\n\r\nrehabilitated. Every encouragement and  assistance\r\n\r\nis  being  given  by the Department  to  voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations  to  enable  them  to  expand  their\r\n\r\ntraining  facilities. In 1970, a sum  of  $622,057\r\n\r\nwas   expended  in  assisting  voluntary   welfare\r\n\r\norganisations. This sum comprised $341,457 in  the\r\n\r\nform  of  grants  and  $280,600  in  the  form  of\r\n\r\nsalaries  for 32 teachers and nine instructors  in\r\n\r\nvoluntary  institutions catering  for  handicapped\r\n\r\ngroups.

However,  their\r\n\r\nefforts in this direction have not been altogether\r\n\r\nsuccessful.  There  are a number  of  reasons  for\r\n\r\nthis,  one  of which is the prejudice  among  many\r\n\r\nemployers  who,  for  one  reason  or  other,  are\r\n\r\nreluctant   to   employ   physically   handicapped\r\n\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the next few months I hope to\r\n\r\nmake  a series of visits to factories with a  view\r\n\r\nto  seeing what opportunities exist and what could\r\n\r\nfurther   be   done  to  secure   employment   for\r\n\r\nhandicapped persons in industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the last part of the question, Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is  not possible to say at this stage  whether\r\n\r\nthe    Government   will   consider    introducing\r\n\r\nlegislation   to   provide  for   the   compulsory\r\n\r\nemployment  of physically handicapped persons  who\r\n\r\nhave  received the appropriate training.  Once  we\r\n\r\nknow  the  extent of this problem, and  if  it  is\r\n\r\nfound  that,  on a voluntary basis, it  cannot  be\r\n\r\nresolved, legislation may be considered, as has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  introduced in many countries.

The  Memorandum  also\r\n\r\nmentions  study loans. I would like to know,  Sir,\r\n\r\nhow  much is being made available for study  loans\r\n\r\nand the terms and conditions for the award of such\r\n\r\nloans.

One comes across too many  cases,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhere  bright students have had to give  up  their\r\n\r\nstudies  even  though  they have  scholarships  or\r\n\r\nbursaries, because their families rely on them for\r\n\r\nfinancial support. I speak with some authority  on\r\n\r\nthe  subject, Sir, because I very nearly became  a\r\n\r\ncasualty my.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nself.

We should not only be increasing the number of awards available but also actively consider new schemes to enable people\r\n\r\nfrom poor families to obtain better education. The\r\n\r\nhandicaps   to  the  poor  students  are   already\r\n\r\ntremendous,  if  one  thinks of  the  over-crowded\r\n\r\nliving  conditions  and the  cultural  poverty  of\r\n\r\ntheir   homes,   in  addition  to  the   financial\r\n\r\nhardships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every bit of talent that we can salvage will be\r\n\r\nan  asset  to  Singapore.

I  would  like  to  see,  therefore,\r\n\r\ngreater  efforts  being made in  future  years  to\r\n\r\nensure  the  greatest  possible  scope  for  human\r\n\r\ndevelopment. Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Sir, there has been a change\r\n\r\nin  the  system of awarding bursaries  since  some\r\n\r\nthree years ago. Until then the award of bursaries\r\n\r\nwas partly based on merit - the performance of the\r\n\r\nstudents  --and  partly  based  on  the  financial\r\n\r\ncircumstances  of their families. The  result  was\r\n\r\nquite  unsatisfactory  because  the  two  do   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  go together. The present position  is\r\n\r\nto  award bursaries strictly on the performance of\r\n\r\nthe students, that is, on merit. The bursaries are\r\n\r\nawarded  to  the value of anything  from  $750  to\r\n\r\n$1,500  or  $2,000 a year. On the other  hand,  we\r\n\r\nhave taken into account that there may be students\r\n\r\nwho  are  not  of  outstanding  ability  but  who,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, can perform reasonably well  in  the\r\n\r\nuniversities  and  whose  families   may   be   in\r\n\r\nstraitened  circumstances. For  such  students  we\r\n\r\noffer loans. Over the last three years. There have\r\n\r\nbeen  something like a hundred loans offered under\r\n\r\nthe scheme to the value of around $500 a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether one should take into account the putative\r\n\r\nloss  of  earnings to the family by  reason  of  a\r\n\r\nstudent's  going  to  the  university  instead  of\r\n\r\nfinding a job is, I think, a new principle.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  which country compensates families  for\r\n\r\nthis kind of loss of possible earnings. I doubt if\r\n\r\nthere are any. I myself do not think that this  is\r\n\r\nwarranted under the circumstances for two reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst,  I  do not believe that in Singapore  there\r\n\r\nhas been a loss of brain power of high calibre  by\r\n\r\nreason  of  the  poverty  of  the  families.   The\r\n\r\nbursaries,  the  wide range of  Colombo  Plan  and\r\n\r\nother  scholarships to universities abroad, ensure\r\n\r\nthat  any outstanding students will have the  best\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  get the most suitable  form  of\r\n\r\nuniversity  education. I  have  made  a  point  of\r\n\r\ninquiring into the background of scholars who have\r\n\r\nreturned from overseas courses on Colombo Plan  or\r\n\r\nother  scholarships. I have also made  the  point,\r\n\r\nwhen   interviewing  young  administrative   cadet\r\n\r\nofficers  and other Government personnel on  their\r\n\r\nentry  into  the  service, to inquire  into  their\r\n\r\nfamily background. It is astonishing that the vast\r\n\r\nmajority, of these young men and women  who  have\r\n\r\nperformed extremely well in the university here in\r\n\r\nSingapore came from very humble family background.\r\n\r\nFor  the  most  part, their fathers  would  be  in\r\n\r\noccupations  such'  as  cooks,  taxi  drivers   or\r\n\r\nmechanics.  Those  with more affluent  occupations\r\n\r\nwould  be  minor contractors and Chinese  medicine\r\n\r\nmen.  This  provides strong evidence that  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety  no  school boy need be  deprived  of  the\r\n\r\nhighest educational opportunities because  of  the\r\n\r\npoverty of his family. Of course, now that we have\r\n\r\nnational  service  and  now  that  Higher   School\r\n\r\nCertificate boys have to do two and a half  years'\r\n\r\nservice  in  the  army,  if  the  family   is   in\r\n\r\nstraitened  circumstances, one very  good  way  of\r\n\r\ngetting  a  university education  and  earning  an\r\n\r\nincome at the same time would be to take a regular\r\n\r\ncommission, when the boy can do his degree  course\r\n\r\nin the University while holding a commission as  a\r\n\r\nLieutenant or Second Lieutenant earning  something\r\n\r\nlike $500 or $600 a month\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore\r\n\r\nhas been first in many things and, for the future,\r\n\r\nI  hope  that we will dare to take first steps  in\r\n\r\nnew  directions  which other  countries  have  not\r\n\r\nhitherto taken.

The  Concise  Oxford  Dictionary\r\n\r\nthat   I   referred  to  gives  the   meaning   of\r\n\r\nsupernumerary as \"in excess of the normal number\".\r\n\r\nIn the estimates for 1969-70, the number of office\r\n\r\nboys asked for under this category was one person.\r\n\r\nIn  the estimates for 1970-71, the request was for\r\n\r\nfive   supernumerary  office   boys.   The   Audit\r\n\r\nDepartment has also requested this year for  seven\r\n\r\nsupernumerary general clerical assistants. In each\r\n\r\nand  every instance, a token vote of $10 has  been\r\n\r\nasked for and granted up to now, last year and the\r\n\r\nyear before last. Sir, it seems strange to me that\r\n\r\nyear after year the number of office boys required\r\n\r\nhas  been progressively increased. If there  is  a\r\n\r\nreal  and  increasing need for office boys,  there\r\n\r\nshould  have been some systematic arrangement  for\r\n\r\nrecruiting office boys as such. I do not seriously\r\n\r\nthink  that there is a shortage of applicants  for\r\n\r\njobs  as office boys. But if there is no real need\r\n\r\nfor  office  boys,  it  is  rather  misleading  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for an increasing number of supernumerary\r\n\r\noffice boys under a token vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question is whether it is necessary to\r\n\r\nincrease  the number of supernumerary office  boys\r\n\r\nunder   a   token  vote  and  what  is  the   real\r\n\r\nsignificance, if any, in such increase in number?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

It is stated\r\n\r\nthat  one reason that accounts for the bigger vote\r\n\r\nrequired  is  that \"the Department would  like  to\r\n\r\nconduct  special investigation which would examine\r\n\r\nsuch  problems as wastage and effectiveness.\" Sir,\r\n\r\nproblems  such  as  wastage and  effectiveness,  I\r\n\r\nshould  have  thought,  are already  being  looked\r\n\r\nafter  by  the Organisation and Methods Branch  of\r\n\r\nthe  Treasury and duplication of the same  service\r\n\r\nsurely  will  only  result  in  wastage.

In  regard  to\r\n\r\nstatutory  authorities,  it  may  or  may  not  be\r\n\r\nappropriate for the Auditor-General to audit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  accounts.

The Auditor-General\r\n\r\ndoes not employ qualified accountants, and his job\r\n\r\nis not to see whether departments or the authority\r\n\r\nis  run  on  proper  commercial  lines.  His  main\r\n\r\nfunction is to ensure that public funds are  spent\r\n\r\nwith  proper  covering approval and in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith  procedures  laid down. For  instance,  if  a\r\n\r\nparticular department spends $5 million on flowers\r\n\r\nand  flower  pots, it is not the business  of  the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General to observe that this is a waste of\r\n\r\npublic   funds  if  that  particular   expenditure\r\n\r\nappears in the estimates and has been approved  by\r\n\r\nMembers. All he has to see is that the expenditure\r\n\r\nhas  the covering approval in the estimates passed\r\n\r\nby  Parliament  and the method of purchase  is  in\r\n\r\naccordance with financial procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a company auditor doing the\r\n\r\naccounts  of  Neptune Orient  Lines  or  Chartered\r\n\r\nIndustries,  he  has to make  sure  as  well  that\r\n\r\nexpenditures  are  properly  incurred  which  will\r\n\r\nincrease  the profitability or efficiency  of  the\r\n\r\nbusiness.

He   links   it   with\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. I assume he is referring to air\r\n\r\npollution.  Possibly more than  three-quarters  of\r\n\r\nair  pollution  is caused by motorcars  and  motor\r\n\r\nvehicles,  and  even by those  without  smoke.  We\r\n\r\ncannot  eliminate  this kind  of  pollution  until\r\n\r\nmotorcar  manufacturers come out  with  an  engine\r\n\r\nthat  does  not emit so much poisonous  substances\r\n\r\ninto   the   air.  As  for  industrial  pollution,\r\n\r\npossibly  the  most  serious would  be  the  power\r\n\r\nstations. We use fuel oil with a very high sulphur\r\n\r\ncontent. It is quite an easy method to reduce  air\r\n\r\npollution  in this respect, but it does mean  that\r\n\r\nit will cost much more to generate electricity and\r\n\r\nwe  will  have  to charge the consumers  more  for\r\n\r\ntheir light and power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah wants to know\r\n\r\nwhether the Anti-Pollution Unit does exist and, if\r\n\r\nso,  where it is.

They  have  to study  the  problem  and\r\n\r\nestablish  monitoring stations of  which  quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber  have been set up in Singapore.  They  will\r\n\r\nthen  make  recommendations to the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nand advise him on measures, including legislation,\r\n\r\nand  the  policy  best suited  to  our  situation.\r\n\r\nEnforcement   authorities  will  depend   on   the\r\n\r\nlegislation.   For  instance,  the   P.W.D, will\r\n\r\nprobably   be   called  in  to  enforce   measures\r\n\r\nconnected  with drains, sewers, etc. The  Ministry\r\n\r\nof Health will certainly be called upon to enforce\r\n\r\nstandards  of  hygiene and so on.

The fact is\r\n\r\nthat I have been the Minister for only 2 1/2 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reason why there is no Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary  for  my  Ministry is  simply  that  the\r\n\r\nEstablishment  Branch of the Ministry  of  Finance\r\n\r\nhas  not been able to find a suitable person.  The\r\n\r\nsecond  reason, of course, is that as the Minister\r\n\r\nI  am very much conscious of Parkinson's law,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  I do not want to create the  impression\r\n\r\nthat  the moment we start a Ministry, we must have\r\n\r\na  Permanent  Secretary. However, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nScience and Technology is being looked after by  a\r\n\r\nPrincipal    Assistant    Secretary,    and     my\r\n\r\nrecommendation to the Ministry of Finance is  that\r\n\r\nsince my Ministry has now shown that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  has been functioning for the last 24 years and\r\n\r\nthat the work is developing in volume, my Ministry\r\n\r\nwould need to have at least a Deputy Secretary.

I wish to know why\r\n\r\ntemporary  staff  have  to be  employed  for  this\r\n\r\nMinistry. If the Ministry needs additional  staff,\r\n\r\nwhy not employ permanent staff who are known to be\r\n\r\nloyal and are able to do a better job?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\ntemporary  staff as provided for in  subhead  3001\r\n\r\nare  required to start the Metrication Board which\r\n\r\nhas been set up recently. It is not envisaged that\r\n\r\nthe Metrication Board will continue as a permanent\r\n\r\nfeature in my Ministry because at some future date\r\n\r\nit  will be dissolved when the major task  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard has been performed and Singapore is well  on\r\n\r\nits  way towards metrication. Therefore, the staff\r\n\r\nwhich  are now being gathered to assist the  Board\r\n\r\nin  its  functions need only be temporary as  they\r\n\r\nwill   not  form  a  permanent  feature   of   the\r\n\r\nestablishment.

At  the  moment, the  Science  Centre\r\n\r\nstill comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Science  and  Technology.  And  if  I  may  be\r\n\r\npermitted  to  continue,  Sir,  is  the   Minister\r\n\r\nprepared to clarify?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You may continue, Mr Govindasamy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

The Minister  concurred\r\n\r\nwith  me  and in his reply he mentioned  that  the\r\n\r\nproposed  Popular Science Centre might  eventually\r\n\r\ncost more than $5 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the Memorandum on the Estimates of\r\n\r\nRevenue  and Expenditure for Singapore, it appears\r\n\r\nthat  no  provision  is made  for  the  staff  and\r\n\r\nexpenditure   of   the  Popular  Science   Centre.\r\n\r\nInstead,  a  Science Centre Board has been  formed\r\n\r\nand  a  separate  provision of $201,150  is  being\r\n\r\nasked  for  the Board under subhead 2104  of  Head\r\n\r\n1303  (Contributions  and Charitable  Allowances).\r\n\r\nFurther,  in the Development Estimates, a  sum  of\r\n\r\n$1750,000  is  asked  for  as  \"Contributions   to\r\n\r\nScience  Centre Board\". We are also  told  in  the\r\n\r\nMemorandum on the Development Estimates  that  the\r\n\r\nproposed  Science Centre is estimated to  cost  $9\r\n\r\nmillion.  Apparently  from  both  Memoranda,   the\r\n\r\nScience  Centre  is going to be the responsibility\r\n\r\nof  the Science Centre Board. If that is the case,\r\n\r\nI   wish   to  ask  the  Minister  what   is   the\r\n\r\nrelationship,  if any, between the Science  Centre\r\n\r\nBoard  and the Ministry of Science and Technology.\r\n\r\nIf  the Science Centre Board has been set up,  can\r\n\r\nthe  Minister tell us who are the members  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard?  And other than the responsibility for  the\r\n\r\nPopular  Science Centre, has the Board  any  other\r\n\r\nresponsibilities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, as I mentioned in the last budget\r\n\r\nsession, the Popular Science Centre has my fullest\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry  is partly responsible for  confusing\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Telok Blangah by listing the  vote\r\n\r\nfor  the Popular Science Centre under subhead 3004\r\n\r\nof  Head  0301  in the Estimates. Originally  when\r\n\r\nthis  vote  was inserted in the 1970-71 Estimates,\r\n\r\nit  was  intended  to  pay  for  local  costs  for\r\n\r\nvisiting  experts  who  would  advise  us  on  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up of the Science Centre. Since then  two\r\n\r\nreports  have been submitted by them, and  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned this to Parliament. And for the  1971-72\r\n\r\nestimates  there is a $10 token vote against  this\r\n\r\nsubhead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position at this moment is that the Science\r\n\r\nCentre  Board has been appointed with Mr Wee  Cho\r\n\r\nYaw  as  Chairman,  as everybody  knows,  and  Mr\r\n\r\nRonald  Sng  as  Deputy  Chairman.  Several  other\r\n\r\npersons have also been appointed as members of the\r\n\r\nBoard.   Although  the  Board   is   now   working\r\n\r\nindependently   of  my  Ministry,   there   is   a\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of my Ministry on the  Board.  The\r\n\r\nScience  Centre  Board is now  in  the  transition\r\n\r\nstage  and  until it has been properly  built,  it\r\n\r\nwill  continue to operate within the precincts  of\r\n\r\nthe National Museum and to enlist the services  of\r\n\r\nthe staff of the Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the Science Centre is open for\r\n\r\noperations, the Ministry of Science and Technology\r\n\r\nwill  dissolve the National Museum, and the  staff\r\n\r\nthereof  will be distributed between  the  Science\r\n\r\nCentre  itself and other departments of the  civil\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the Board is looking into the\r\n\r\nfollowing  aspects regarding the establishment  of\r\n\r\nthe Science Centre. First, a 16-acre site fronting\r\n\r\nJurong Lake has been earmarked for the centre, and\r\n\r\nnegotiations  are going on between the  Board  and\r\n\r\nthe Jurong Town Corporation for leasing this area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with regard to the building itself, the\r\n\r\nBoard  has  been fortunate in securing  assistance\r\n\r\nfrom the Asia Foundation which recently sent out a\r\n\r\ntwo-man  team  of  architects and  consultants  to\r\n\r\nadvise  the  Board on drawing up a brief  for  the\r\n\r\nbuilding.  It is the intention of the  Board  that\r\n\r\nthe  erection  of  the building will  be  open  to\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Board is actively looking for a\r\n\r\nsuitable person for appointment as Director of the\r\n\r\nScience  Centre. This is a difficult task,  as  we\r\n\r\nneed   to  find  a  person  who  knows  what   the\r\n\r\nphilosophy  of the Science Centre and its  purpose\r\n\r\nare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that under Head 1303, Contributions\r\n\r\nand  Charitable Allowances, a sum of $201,150  has\r\n\r\nbeen allocated for the workings of the Science\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCentre Board, but part of this money will be spent\r\n\r\non paying architects' fees and the salaries of the\r\n\r\nDirector  and other staff whom the Science  Centre\r\n\r\nBoard may feel it necessary to recruit.

These  inspectors  are   engaged   in\r\n\r\nperforming statutory testing and inspection duties\r\n\r\non  tankers and ships under the provisions of  the\r\n\r\nPetroleum  Ordinance. Before 1968, most  of  these\r\n\r\nn1spections  were  carried  out  in  shipyards  at\r\n\r\nKeppel, Kallang and Tanjong Rhu. But since October\r\n\r\n1969  the  number  of  inspections  performed   at\r\n\r\nshipyards has increased because new shipyards  are\r\n\r\nbeing built in the Jurong industrial estate.  Also\r\n\r\nfrom  1969  these  inspections have  included  the\r\n\r\nSembawang Shipyard as well. As more shipyards  are\r\n\r\nestablished  in Singapore, there is  greater  need\r\n\r\nfor these inspectors to travel to these places  to\r\n\r\nperform their task, and because of the distance of\r\n\r\nJurong  and  Sembawang  the  cost  of  travel  has\r\n\r\nconcurrently been raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coming year, the Chemistry Department is\r\n\r\nalso  playing an active role in helping industries\r\n\r\nby engaging themselves in research and development\r\n\r\nprojects   and  consultative  work  for  industry.\r\n\r\nHence,   the  chemists  have  to  pay  visits   to\r\n\r\nfactories,  and  again their travel  expenses  are\r\n\r\nchargeable to the departmental vote.

To be fair, I have not heard of too  many\r\n\r\ncomplaints  of  servicemen appearing  unkempt  and\r\n\r\nbedraggled.   But   I  have  noticed   a   certain\r\n\r\ncarelessness in the way some servicemen dress. Are\r\n\r\nthere  no  regulations which  stipulate  how  they\r\n\r\nshould  wear  their  uniform,  whether  they   are\r\n\r\nallowed to leave buttons unbuttoned, whether  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  slip their slacks into their boots,  and\r\n\r\nwhether they are allowed to keep their hair  long?\r\n\r\nSome of them have hair cuts which the Minister for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs  might consider as  belonging  to  a\r\n\r\ncategory   of  people  who  are  not  allowed   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  hope I do not sound  too  petty  in\r\n\r\nbringing  up  these domestic issues. There  is  no\r\n\r\ndoubt about the tremendous achievements which  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence must be credited\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith    in    building   an   impressive   defence\r\n\r\nestablishment. I am asking such questions  because\r\n\r\nI  feel  it is important, now that we have reached\r\n\r\nan  obviously  viable stage in the development  of\r\n\r\nour Armed Forces, that the image of the serviceman\r\n\r\nin  the  eyes of the public should be  that  of  a\r\n\r\ngentleman as well as of a dependable fighter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the point about the general\r\n\r\nbehaviour  of our servicemen and not merely  their\r\n\r\nappearance. I think that sometimes in  small  ways\r\n\r\nthe  behaviour  of  our men in  uniform  leaves  a\r\n\r\nlittle more to be desired. They cling on grimly to\r\n\r\ntheir  seats  in buses. Even when they  travel  in\r\n\r\nmilitary transport, I have seen them sometimes cat-calling  and wolf-whistling. They rush  for  buses\r\n\r\nwhen  they should be queueing up. They rush across\r\n\r\nthe road when a pedestrian crossing or an overhead\r\n\r\nbridge is only about a hundred metres away. I have\r\n\r\ncome  across  these incidents  because  I  pass  a\r\n\r\ntransport unit encampment every day when I  return\r\n\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have read frequently of reports regarding\r\n\r\ngotong  royong  projects  in  which  Armed  Forces\r\n\r\npersonnel are engaged in order to link their units\r\n\r\nmore  closely with the community. I think this  is\r\n\r\nan  excellent contribution, of course, but perhaps\r\n\r\nattempts  should be made to see that our  soldiers\r\n\r\nin the ordinary areas of contact with civilians do\r\n\r\nnot  behave in such a way as to rub them the wrong\r\n\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I refer to drivers in uniform\r\n\r\ndriving  civilian  cars.  I  wish  to  take   this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to congratulate the Minister  on  the\r\n\r\nvery   fine   improvement  in  the   standard   of\r\n\r\nresponsibility  exercised by drivers  of  military\r\n\r\nvehicles. But I am now talking about soldiers  who\r\n\r\ndrive  their  own  cars but who happen  to  be  in\r\n\r\nuniform. I think perhaps something should be  done\r\n\r\nto  see that the wearing of uniform does not  make\r\n\r\nthem  too  exuberant drivers on the road.  I  have\r\n\r\nnoticed  that there is a certain tendency in  this\r\n\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should\r\n\r\nlike  to  take  the  opportunity  of  asking   the\r\n\r\nMinister  how thorough is the medical  examination\r\n\r\nof  recruits  inducted into national service,  and\r\n\r\nwhether  they  are  examined not  only  for  their\r\n\r\nphysical but also their mental fitness.

One of these two\r\n\r\npersons was in fact called up for national service\r\n\r\non  a  part-time basis, and after a  few  training\r\n\r\nsessions he found them too difficult to follow. He\r\n\r\ndid  not understand what was going on, so he  just\r\n\r\nabsconded.  I  would  like an assurance  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  that the medical examination of recruits\r\n\r\nwill  be more stringent so that there will  be  no\r\n\r\nsimilar repetition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise two\r\n\r\nquestions.  We  know that soldiers  should  always\r\n\r\nmaintain good discipline so that they will leave a\r\n\r\ngood   impression  on  the  people.  But  1   have\r\n\r\nsometimes seen soldiers and even officers  of  our\r\n\r\narmy  appearing in public places, for example,  in\r\n\r\nrestaurants,  coffee-shops and such other  places,\r\n\r\ntaking  their  meals. I am not sure whether  there\r\n\r\nare  any rules and regulations which require  them\r\n\r\nto  have permission to appear in public places  in\r\n\r\nuniform  and  take their meals. I would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister to clarify this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also witnessed some other unfortunate\r\n\r\nevents in certain places. Some of our soldiers and\r\n\r\nofficers display a rather unbecoming attitude. For\r\n\r\nexample, they are sometimes arrogant. They  behave\r\n\r\nas  if  they are in some ways different and  quite\r\n\r\napart  from the ordinary people. In this  respect,\r\n\r\nwe  have to instruct our officers and soldiers not\r\n\r\nto  be  arrogant and not to adopt such an attitude\r\n\r\nin  public  places. I would like the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nclarify these two points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, on the question by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKatong on uniforms.

The two  instruments  in\r\n\r\nquestion have already been gazetted and have  come\r\n\r\ninto operation with effect from 2nd January. 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is amply clear that the purpose of the\r\n\r\ninstruments  is  to fulfil the  assurance  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment    to   provide   adequate   employment\r\n\r\nopportunities   to   national   servicemen   after\r\n\r\ncompletion of their tour of duty. No one,  whether\r\n\r\ninside or outside this House who considers himself\r\n\r\nto  be  a  true  and responsible  citizen  of  the\r\n\r\nrepublic, can deny that the provision of  adequate\r\n\r\nemployment  opportunities for our  young  citizens\r\n\r\nwho  have undergone national service is the  least\r\n\r\nthat  the  republic  can  do  by  way  of  showing\r\n\r\ngratitude to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relative novelty and wide scope of the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the two instruments, however,  have\r\n\r\ngiven  rise  to much misgivings and anxiety  among\r\n\r\nworkers  who  have  not been national  servicemen.\r\n\r\nCertain  of  the  provisions,  which  I  will   be\r\n\r\nreferring  to in a little while, can do with  some\r\n\r\nnecessary  amplification  and  clarification,  not\r\n\r\nonly  in  the  provisions themselves but  also  in\r\n\r\ntheir  underlying purpose. Until an  authoritative\r\n\r\nstatement  is made to such effect, undue confusion\r\n\r\nand worry is bound to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point of clarification which I am\r\n\r\nseeking is in relation to rule 7 (2) of the  Rules\r\n\r\nand  section 3 of the Order. Under rule 7 (2) , the\r\n\r\nDirector  is empowered to ref use to issue  a  new\r\n\r\nemployment card to a registered person  unless  he\r\n\r\nis    satisfied    that   there   is    sufficient\r\n\r\njustification  to warrant a change of  employment.\r\n\r\nSuch  a provision can in itself result in a  great\r\n\r\namount of dissatisfaction being generated among ex-national  servicemen, as judgment  may  vary  from\r\n\r\nDirector  to  Director. It is  patently  desirable\r\n\r\nthat  the  range  of  opinions among  the  various\r\n\r\nincumbents of the post of Director in the years to\r\n\r\ncome  is  narrowed  down to  within  ascertainable\r\n\r\nlimits by Ministerial guidance or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of knowing what will constitute\r\n\r\nsatisfaction to the Director can perhaps  be  best\r\n\r\nillustrated  by  this  hypothetical   example.   A\r\n\r\nregistered  person may wish to have  a  change  of\r\n\r\nemployment by reason of what he considers to be in\r\n\r\nhis  own best interest. He intends to effect  such\r\n\r\nchange of employment by giving up his current  job\r\n\r\nfor  a  lower-paid position but with  much  better\r\n\r\nprospects.  It  would be tragic if  he  is  to  be\r\n\r\nprevented from changing his employment because the\r\n\r\nDirector  is  not satisfied with  his  reason.  It\r\n\r\nwould be more tragic if eventually he is forced to\r\n\r\nresign  his job out of unhappiness but  after  the\r\n\r\nfive-year period when he is no longer entitled  to\r\n\r\nany preferential treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, there does not seem to be any\r\n\r\nsafeguard  against the Director making an  adverse\r\n\r\ndecision  against  a  registered  person   through\r\n\r\nbecoming\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunduly  susceptible  to the persuasive  charms  of\r\n\r\nemployers,  who may be plagued by a high  turnover\r\n\r\nof  the labour force, if such charms are exercised\r\n\r\nin   circumstances  completely   devoid   of   any\r\n\r\nsuggestion  of corruption or graft.  It  may  seem\r\n\r\nthat  a  provision  for  appeal  by  the  employee\r\n\r\nconcerned against a decision of the Director under\r\n\r\nPart   V  of  the  Rules  may  be  necessary   and\r\n\r\nreasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To return to my point, Sir, the provision of\r\n\r\nsection  3  of the Order, while seeking to  assure\r\n\r\nemployment   opportunities  for  former   national\r\n\r\nservicemen seems to be tantamount to an \"overkill\"\r\n\r\nprovision  in restricting the scope of  all  other\r\n\r\npersons   for  changing  employment   or   finding\r\n\r\nalternative employment. In our dynamic society, it\r\n\r\nis  inevitable and healthy that there should be  a\r\n\r\nreasonable degree of turnover of labour. Moreover,\r\n\r\nemployers  are  not  averse  to  exercising  their\r\n\r\npowers to hire and fire practically at will  under\r\n\r\nour  present  laws. Doubts have  therefore  arisen\r\n\r\nwhether unions can now persuade employers  to  re-engage   workers  who  have  been  retrenched   or\r\n\r\ndismissed  in circumstances where no reinstatement\r\n\r\nby   the   Minister   for  Labour   is   possible.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, employers can apply  for  exemption\r\n\r\nunder  the Rules. But from trade union experience,\r\n\r\nI  think it is more likely that the employers will\r\n\r\nuse  the  exemption provision as an added argument\r\n\r\nagainst re-engagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point of clarification which I wish to\r\n\r\nseek  is  in  relation  to Part  V  of  the  Rules\r\n\r\ngoverning  the Appeals Board. Is it the  intention\r\n\r\nof   the   Government  that  the  Appeals  Board's\r\n\r\ndecisions are not to be treated as precedents  and\r\n\r\nthat  the  decisions are relevant to  and  binding\r\n\r\nupon  the  respective employers who appear  before\r\n\r\nthe  Board, somewhat similar to the awards of  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial   Arbitration  Court?  There   may   be\r\n\r\ncompelling    arguments   on   the   grounds    of\r\n\r\nconsistency,  and certainly the decisions  of  the\r\n\r\nAppeals  Board  should be made to apply  to  other\r\n\r\ncases of a similar nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, however, more concerned with the absence of\r\n\r\nprovisions   for  trade  unions  or  the   workers\r\n\r\nconcerned  to  institute or to be  represented  at\r\n\r\nproceedings before the Board. The very  fact  that\r\n\r\nthere   is  provision  for  the  N.T.U.C, to   be\r\n\r\nrepresented   at  every  session  of   the   Board\r\n\r\nindubitably indicates that the matter of exemption\r\n\r\ndoes  not  concern  only  the  employers  and  the\r\n\r\nDirector.  Trade unions and workers are interested\r\n\r\nin   the  fair  and  equitable  operation  of  the\r\n\r\nexemption  provision in so far as it  pertains  to\r\n\r\nthe  right of a person to work. While the N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nnominees  on  the  Board can be expected  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the  interest  of  workers,  it  would   be\r\n\r\nillogical  and unreasonable to expect an  N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nnominee  on  the Board to do full justice  to  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  labour  in any deliberation  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard   if   all  the  facts  pertaining   to   an\r\n\r\napplication  for exemption are not adduced  before\r\n\r\nthe  Board and he does not know the facts himself.\r\n\r\nA  provision,  therefore, should be  made  for  an\r\n\r\nindividual  trade  union or  worker  who  is  more\r\n\r\nconversant  with  such  facts  to  be  represented\r\n\r\nbefore  the Board either in support of or  against\r\n\r\nany application for exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar provision should also be made for an\r\n\r\nindividual  union  or  group  of  workers  to   be\r\n\r\npermitted to make an application for exemption  in\r\n\r\nrespect of any category or class of workers in the\r\n\r\nabsence of non-availability of registered persons.\r\n\r\nAs  the  two instruments stand at present, coupled\r\n\r\nwith the employer's right to hire, as enshrined in\r\n\r\nthe Industrial Relations Ordinance, if an employee\r\n\r\nin  such a situation chooses to refuse to make  an\r\n\r\napplication  for exemption or appeal  against  the\r\n\r\nrefusal  of the Director in respect of prospective\r\n\r\nemployees who are ex-union members or likely to be\r\n\r\nunion  members, there is nothing the trade  unions\r\n\r\nor  the Minister for Labour can do. The end result\r\n\r\nwould  be  that the trade union position would  be\r\n\r\nfurther weakened in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some further points that I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the Minister. What is the purpose of  the\r\n\r\ntwo instruments?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApparently  an inducement for citizens  to  accept\r\n\r\nnational  service  willingly and  enthusiastically\r\n\r\nand penalise those citizens who shirk or refuse or\r\n\r\nbegrudge  national service. If that is  the  case,\r\n\r\nthen  many  citizens are being unfairly penalised.\r\n\r\nFor example, (a) those in age groups not called up\r\n\r\nfor  national service; (b) those who are genuinely\r\n\r\ndebarred  from  national  service  on  grounds  of\r\n\r\nmedical  or physical infirmity; and (c) those  who\r\n\r\nare unfortunate to be female citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No consideration and credit are given to persons\r\n\r\nwho  are  not eligible for registration under  the\r\n\r\nNational   Service  (Employment)   Act   but   who\r\n\r\nvoluntarily offer their services in military, para-military  and civic organisations in the republic.\r\n\r\nSuch   persons   should  also   be   entitled   to\r\n\r\npreferential  treatment if that is the  policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government. For their civic consciousness and\r\n\r\ndevotion to their civic obligations, such  persons\r\n\r\nare  as  deserving  as,  if  not  more  than,  the\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen  of  the  gratitude  of   the\r\n\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the categories of employees expressly\r\n\r\nexempted  under the Order from the  ambit  of  the\r\n\r\nNational  Service (Employment) Act are  managerial\r\n\r\nand  executive personnel in receipt of  a  monthly\r\n\r\nsalary  of not less than $1,920. The question  is,\r\n\r\nwhy  exemption  on  the basis of  salary  and  not\r\n\r\nskill?  It  is likely for more national servicemen\r\n\r\nto  be  competent to hold managerial and executive\r\n\r\npositions  than to become highly skilled artisans,\r\n\r\nsuch  as welders or mechanics. The suspicion  that\r\n\r\nthe  two instruments are designed to cope with the\r\n\r\nproblem of the high rate of turnover of labour  is\r\n\r\nfurther  strengthened, for highly skilled artisans\r\n\r\nare  very  much  in demand and very  difficult  to\r\n\r\nreplace.   Managerial  and  executive   personnel,\r\n\r\nunless they are technical and experienced are  not\r\n\r\nall  that indispensable. A further point  is  that\r\n\r\nfixing a limit of $1,920 will be an added argument\r\n\r\nfor   foreign   firms  to  bring   in   expatriate\r\n\r\npersonnel.  Since  they  can  only  freely  employ\r\n\r\nexecutives at such higher salary, they may as well\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobtain what they consider to be the real McCoys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In enacting these two instruments, Government is\r\n\r\nrestricting the right of the employer to hire.  At\r\n\r\nthe  time of enacting the Employment Act in  1968,\r\n\r\none  of the reasons put forward by Government  for\r\n\r\nthe need to give employers an unfettered right  to\r\n\r\nhire  and  fire  is the urgency of  maintaining  a\r\n\r\ncongenial  atmosphere  for foreign  investment.  A\r\n\r\nvalid conclusion, therefore, is that the need  for\r\n\r\nforeign  investment is not so urgent, which  seems\r\n\r\nprobable    in    the   light   of    governmental\r\n\r\npronouncements  about the spate of new  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities  over  the next few  years.  Against\r\n\r\nthis,  despite the ostensible purpose of  the  two\r\n\r\ninstruments, the general impression created by the\r\n\r\nabsolute  and blanket character of the  provisions\r\n\r\nof  the  two  instruments is  that  of  panic  and\r\n\r\nanxiety on the part of Government that it may  not\r\n\r\nbe  able  to find jobs for its national servicemen\r\n\r\non their return to civilian life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another conclusion could be restriction of the\r\n\r\nemployer's  right to hire does not  prejudice  the\r\n\r\nclimate  for  foreign investment as  long  as  the\r\n\r\nscope  for profit-making is not affected. It  then\r\n\r\nseems  more probable since there can be  no  doubt\r\n\r\nabout   the  employers'  right  being  drastically\r\n\r\ncurtailed. In that case, where does it  leave  the\r\n\r\ntrade    union   movement   which   unquestionably\r\n\r\nsupported  the Government's employment legislation\r\n\r\nin 1968 on the grounds advanced by the Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, the establishment of a\r\n\r\nnational  labour exchange will be a means,  though\r\n\r\nmore  expensive  and intricate, of  achieving  the\r\n\r\npurpose of the two instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Actually the reasons for the\r\n\r\npolicy  of why the Director should have the  right\r\n\r\nto  issue, or refuse to issue, employment cards to\r\n\r\nthose  looking for new jobs are quite simple.  You\r\n\r\nhave  to make sure that these national servicemen,\r\n\r\nwho have this special privilege of preferential\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployment,  are  people of good  character,  that\r\n\r\nthey  have not committed crimes and generally have\r\n\r\nnot  been slack in their work.

As  of\r\n\r\nnow, this is purely an academic issue because  all\r\n\r\nrequests  by  employers for  exemption  have  been\r\n\r\ngranted by the Director. In fact, in two months of\r\n\r\noperation, the Director has granted exemptions  to\r\n\r\nno  less  than 14,000 cases. I do not see on  what\r\n\r\ngrounds  individual  unions  have  the  right   to\r\n\r\nrequest  that  exemption should or should  not  be\r\n\r\ngranted in any occupation. There is no such  thing\r\n\r\nas  \"closed shop\" legislation in Singapore, and  I\r\n\r\nhope  there  never will be. The  purpose  of  this\r\n\r\nlegislation is simple. These are your citizens who\r\n\r\nhave  given two and a half to three years of their\r\n\r\nlives  serving as full-time soldiers in the  army.\r\n\r\nIt  is not a very easy job to be a soldier in  the\r\n\r\narmy.  We  train  them to very rigorous  standards\r\n\r\nand,  in  recognition of their services,  we  give\r\n\r\nthem  this opportunity of preferential employment.\r\n\r\nTo  say  that  there are others who  are  just  as\r\n\r\npatriotic  and  just as civic conscious  and  that\r\n\r\nsort  of thing, that may well be so; but you  tell\r\n\r\nme,  how  can  you identify such people?  Everyone\r\n\r\nwill  say that he is most patriotic when it  comes\r\n\r\nto  getting preferences, but how do you know  that\r\n\r\nthis  person is patriotic and not that person?  So\r\n\r\nthe proposal of the Member is quite impractical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limit of $1,920 a month is a purely arbitrary\r\n\r\nlimit.

We have appeared  in  the\r\n\r\ninternational arena as a non-aligned  nation,  and\r\n\r\nhave   made  friends  with  many  countries.  This\r\n\r\nposition  is important to the survival and  growth\r\n\r\nof  our  country. But at the same time  we  should\r\n\r\nalso   appreciate   that   developments   in   the\r\n\r\ninternational  field keep changing all  the  time.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in  the  best  interest  of  our   own\r\n\r\ncountry, I think the Minister for Foreign  Affairs\r\n\r\nwill  agree  with me that we should adopt  a  very\r\n\r\nflexible foreign policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this broad guideline, I would like to raise\r\n\r\ntwo points with the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in the new fiscal year, will the\r\n\r\nGovernment  establish  more  foreign  missions  in\r\n\r\norder  to  promote friendship and better relations\r\n\r\nwith other countries? Secondly, Britain's decision\r\n\r\nto  sell  arms to South Africa has sparked  off  a\r\n\r\ngreat  controversy  in  the  international  field,\r\n\r\nparticularly  during  the  Commonwealth  Heads  of\r\n\r\nGovernment Conference held in Singapore early this\r\n\r\nyear.  At this conference this subject was  keenly\r\n\r\ndebated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  many  African  countries. In  spite  of  this,\r\n\r\nBritain  has gone ahead with the sale of  arms  to\r\n\r\nSouth Africa. I would, therefore, like to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  what  is  Singapore's attitude  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter.  Have  we taken any appropriate  steps  in\r\n\r\nthis field?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour (Mr S.

In fact, some people think that we\r\n\r\nare too flexible, with the result that they do not\r\n\r\nknow what our stand is. This is not a bad position\r\n\r\nfor  a  country  to be in in these very  difficult\r\n\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to his question whether we intend to\r\n\r\nset  up  more foreign missions, the policy of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has always been to establish a  foreign\r\n\r\nmission  only when there is considerable financial\r\n\r\nand  political justification for it. I  think  the\r\n\r\nonly foreign mission we might establish this year,\r\n\r\nin  addition to the 13 or 14 missions that we have\r\n\r\nnow  will be in the Soviet Union, in view  of  the\r\n\r\nfact that the Soviet Union is going to be a factor\r\n\r\nin this part of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member that it is\r\n\r\npossible  to  have friendly relations  with  other\r\n\r\ncountries without having foreign missions. In some\r\n\r\ninstances  you  are  more  likely  to  have   less\r\n\r\nfriendly   relations  with  countries  by   having\r\n\r\nforeign  missions there. The Member might know  of\r\n\r\nthis  if  he had read the recent history  of  this\r\n\r\npart  of  the  world where foreign  missions  were\r\n\r\nburnt down. Therefore, it is not necessary to have\r\n\r\nforeign  missions  just for  the  sake  of  having\r\n\r\nfriendly  relations with the countries  concerned.\r\n\r\nYou   should  only  have  foreign  missions   when\r\n\r\nsubstantial interest is involved. In regard to the\r\n\r\nBritish  arms sale to South Africa, of  course  we\r\n\r\nare   opposed  in  principle  to  it  because   it\r\n\r\ninfringes  the United Nations resolution  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter.  We ourselves have condemned it especially\r\n\r\nwhen  the  arms  are used for the  furtherance  of\r\n\r\napartheid.

There has been a considerable increase in the number of industrial accidents over the past one year. According to statistics released by the Ministry of Labour, the number of accidents which occurred last year was\r\n\r\nmore  than  that in the previous year. Undoubtedly\r\n\r\nthis  is  a grave situation which warrants  proper\r\n\r\nattention. The victims and their families  deserve\r\n\r\nour  sympathy and help. Their welfare is at stake.\r\n\r\nWe should therefore consider their plight. Many of\r\n\r\nthe  victims' wives have become widows  and  their\r\n\r\nchildren  have become orphans. I urge the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour to take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npositive and effective steps to reduce the  number\r\n\r\nof industrial accidents. He should ensure that our\r\n\r\nworkers  are  able to work in safer circumstances.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in spite of my appeal, it is regrettable\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry of Labour has  not  taken  any\r\n\r\nsteps  to  improve the situation and to solve  the\r\n\r\nproblems  arising out of industrial accidents.  At\r\n\r\nthe  very best, the Ministry has only set up  some\r\n\r\nso-called  committees  to  look  into  the  matter\r\n\r\nsuperficially.  They  even go  to  the  extent  of\r\n\r\norganising industrial seminars just to  put  up  a\r\n\r\nshow. They have invited so-called experts to  talk\r\n\r\n\"hell of a lot\" at such seminars and nothing else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think \"hell of a lot\" is\r\n\r\nunparliamentary language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Please\r\n\r\ncarry on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If you think I\r\n\r\nhave   used   an  unparliamentary  expression,   I\r\n\r\nwithdraw it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is worse is that their recommendations and\r\n\r\nproposals  are  very  high  sounding  but   rather\r\n\r\nimpractical. In my view, the seminars are  just  a\r\n\r\nwaste  of time. They have not contributed anything\r\n\r\nthat will actually solve the problem of industrial\r\n\r\naccidents.  If we wish to do something about  this\r\n\r\ngrave  situation, we must invite  those  who  have\r\n\r\npractical  experience in the industrial  field  to\r\n\r\nstudy the problems and to make recommendations for\r\n\r\ntheir solution. For example, we can invite factory\r\n\r\nmanagers,  engineers  or  even  foremen  to   come\r\n\r\nforward  with  suggestions on  how  to  solve  the\r\n\r\nproblem.  It is these people who know  the  actual\r\n\r\nsituation and are capable of recommending measures\r\n\r\nto  reduce the number of accidents. I am sure they\r\n\r\nwill   be  able  to  contribute  useful  and  more\r\n\r\npractical   proposals  than  those  expounded   at\r\n\r\nseminars by the so-called experts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employers of factories should also take\r\n\r\ngreater  responsibility to see that the number  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  accidents  is  reduced.  They   should\r\n\r\nensure that over-age\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmachinery  is replaced in time  in  order  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the  lives of the workers.  I  remember\r\n\r\nthat in the last fiscal year, during the debate on\r\n\r\nthe  budget,  the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour  told this  House  that  the\r\n\r\ngreatest problem confronting the Industrial Safety\r\n\r\nUnit  was the shortage of factory inspectors.  The\r\n\r\nreason  was  that  the  allocation  of  funds  was\r\n\r\ninadequate  for  the increased number  of  factory\r\n\r\ninspectors required. If that is the case, I  think\r\n\r\nthe  problem is rather simple. When we  have  more\r\n\r\nfactory  inspectors, we will be able  to  increase\r\n\r\nindustrial  safety. We can spend a  bit  more.  We\r\n\r\nshould be prepared to allocate more funds for this\r\n\r\npurpose. We should take immediate remedial  action\r\n\r\nin  this field. I wish to ask the Minister whether\r\n\r\nthe number of factory inspectors will be increased\r\n\r\nthis  year. There are more factories in  Singapore\r\n\r\nnow  and the number of workers is ever increasing.\r\n\r\nWe should, therefore, have more factory inspectors\r\n\r\nto go round to ensure that the safety measures are\r\n\r\nproperly  observed. They should go round  and  see\r\n\r\nthat  the factory employers themselves have proper\r\n\r\nsafety measures in their factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to\r\n\r\nanother  point.  Can he inform  this  I-louse  why\r\n\r\nthere  has  been  an increase  in  the  number  of\r\n\r\nindustrial   accidents?  What   are   the   causes\r\n\r\ncontributing to such accidents? Is the Ministry of\r\n\r\nLabour  making  any  comprehensive  study  of  the\r\n\r\nmatter? If we have the reasons, and a proper study\r\n\r\nis  made, we will be able to reduce the number  of\r\n\r\naccidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will first\r\n\r\nenlighten the Member for Sembawang. I think he has\r\n\r\nasked the right question - What are the causes for\r\n\r\nthe  rise  in the number of industrial  accidents?\r\n\r\nThe first reason is the number of factories, which\r\n\r\nhas increased from 3,963 in 1969 to some 4,050  in\r\n\r\n1970.  The  number of machines, steam boilers  and\r\n\r\nother    machines    involved   has,    therefore,\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly  increased. So  has  the  work  of\r\n\r\nindustrial employees. I think the figures  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen given\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindicate that there has been an increase of 22,700\r\n\r\nindustrial  workers  during  the  past  year.  The\r\n\r\nfrequency  of the rates of accidents is about  the\r\n\r\nsame. But the fact is that because a larger number\r\n\r\nof  workers are involved, the number of  accidents\r\n\r\nin   the  factories  has  tended  to  increase  as\r\n\r\ncompared with 1969. In the year before last  there\r\n\r\nwere  1,270 industrial accidents, and in 1970  the\r\n\r\nnumber  was  1,525. The number of fatal  accidents\r\n\r\nincreased  from 29 to 36. I agree with the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang  that preventive  measures  can  be\r\n\r\ntaken  by  the Government. But one shortcoming  in\r\n\r\nprevious years was the lack of sufficient  factory\r\n\r\ninspectors.  However, this year the  Ministry  has\r\n\r\nmade  good this shortcoming and some 27 additional\r\n\r\nposts   have   been   created   in   the   Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate  Section.  These  new   posts,   when\r\n\r\nfilled, will enable the Ministry to carry out more\r\n\r\nfrequent and thorough factory inspections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason for the increased number of\r\n\r\nindustrial  accidents is that both  the  employers\r\n\r\nand the workers themselves have not taken care  to\r\n\r\nobserve  the factory safety regulations  that  now\r\n\r\nexist.  I  have  forgotten  the  figures,  but   a\r\n\r\nmajority of the accidents were due to the  workers\r\n\r\nthemselves neglecting to observe the safety  rules\r\n\r\nthat  they  were  supposed  to  observe.  As   the\r\n\r\nMinister  of State has just indicated, fundamental\r\n\r\namendments  are  going to be made to  the  Factory\r\n\r\nOrdinance. The Bill is practically ready.  As  far\r\n\r\nas I know, it has gone to the Attorney-General and\r\n\r\nonce  he  has  vetted  the legal  aspects  of  the\r\n\r\namended  Factory  Ordinance, it will  come  before\r\n\r\nthis House. I cannot give Members the details, but\r\n\r\nthe  amendments will provide for stiffer fines for\r\n\r\nany  infringement  of  the required  standards  of\r\n\r\nsafety. The amendments will also introduce  higher\r\n\r\nstandards  of  health and welfare required  to  be\r\n\r\nprovided by employers. Personally, I think one  of\r\n\r\nthe areas where high rates of accidents take place\r\n\r\nis in the construction trade, primarily because of\r\n\r\nthe rapid expansion of this sector of our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang does not believe in\r\n\r\nexperts.  But  I fortunately do, because  I  would\r\n\r\nrather  trust experts than one who claims that  he\r\n\r\nis not an expert. Anyway, a group of people - I do\r\n\r\nnot know whether the Member would consider them as\r\n\r\nexperts but they, I believe, do know about  safety\r\n\r\nregulations   -  from  the  National  Productivity\r\n\r\nCentre,  the  National Safety First  Council,  the\r\n\r\nNational  Trades  Union  Congress,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nEmployers'      Federation,     the      Singapore\r\n\r\nManufacturers' Association, the Singapore  Medical\r\n\r\nAssociation, the Society of Occupational  Medicine\r\n\r\nand  the  University  of  Singapore  (Faculty   of\r\n\r\nEngineering),  have considered  this  problem  and\r\n\r\nsubmitted  a report largely at the behest  of  the\r\n\r\nformer  Minister for Finance, now the Minister  of\r\n\r\nDefence.  They have suggested the formation  of  a\r\n\r\ncouncil  of industrial safety and health.  On  the\r\n\r\nwhole,  I think, in so far as is humanly possible,\r\n\r\ntheir  recommendations  would  probably  halt  and\r\n\r\nreduce  the  alarming rate of growth of industrial\r\n\r\naccidents  in  Singapore. These are  some  of  the\r\n\r\nmeasures  that the Government are taking.  In  the\r\n\r\npast,  the  problems of industrial accidents  were\r\n\r\nrather  neglected  in the Labour  Ministry's  work\r\n\r\nlargely  because industrial expansion  was  rather\r\n\r\nslow  and we were able to cope with these problems\r\n\r\nin  a  somewhat leisurely fashion. But  since  the\r\n\r\nlast  four  or five years, the very rapid  growth,\r\n\r\nplus the level of skills that our workers are  now\r\n\r\nacquiring,  makes it more imperative that  greater\r\n\r\nattention  and  seriousness  should  be  given  to\r\n\r\npreserving the health and safety of our workers in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would like to clarify a point.

But it is true that  there\r\n\r\nis  one category of people for whom there is delay\r\n\r\nsimply  because nobody wants them. These  are  the\r\n\r\nwhite-collar   jobs,   especially   the   clerical\r\n\r\nsection, where there are too many registrants  and\r\n\r\ntoo few jobs. According to the statistics provided\r\n\r\nto me, as of 31st December, 1970, there were 8,854\r\n\r\npersons registered for white-collar jobs, while in\r\n\r\nthe whole of that year only 182 such vacancies had\r\n\r\nbeen notified to the Exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason might be that very often people\r\n\r\nare  offered jobs but the applicants have  refused\r\n\r\nthem  for  a variety of reasons. Some of them  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  place  of work is too  far  from  their\r\n\r\nhomes, or the nature of `the work is not to  their\r\n\r\nliking,  or the salary offered by the employer  is\r\n\r\nnot  enough. These people have therefore  rejected\r\n\r\noffers of jobs or have told the Exchange, \"Look, I\r\n\r\nam   still  on  the  register  but  I  would  like\r\n\r\nsomething  that meets my conditions  of  service.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore,  they  may  take that  as  insufficient\r\n\r\nattention being paid by the Employment Exchange to\r\n\r\ntheir particular needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason might be that there Is no law to\r\n\r\ncompel  employers  to make use of  the  Employment\r\n\r\nExchange    when   vacancies   occur   in    their\r\n\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs  a  result, employers prefer to find their  own\r\n\r\ncandidates,   and  not  necessarily  through   the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Exchange. So since  the  beginning  of\r\n\r\nthis  year, we have amended the law in  regard  to\r\n\r\nnational servicemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, I would say that, as far as I can\r\n\r\ngather, if applicants have the skills and  if  the\r\n\r\njobs  are there, there is no delay and the  people\r\n\r\nare  immediately found jobs. But in  the  case  of\r\n\r\nwhite-collar  workers, I agree - it  is  a  lesson\r\n\r\nthat white-collar workers should take very much to\r\n\r\nheart  --  that there is less demand for them.  If\r\n\r\nthey go to the Employment Exchange and if they are\r\n\r\noffered  jobs as factory operatives, suggest  very\r\n\r\nstrongly  that  while they are  still  young  they\r\n\r\nshould take these jobs which are offered to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, it is quite often that\r\n\r\nthe    Employment    Exchange   officers    accept\r\n\r\napplications  for  all  categories  of  work  like\r\n\r\nhospital  servants, school servants, cleaners  and\r\n\r\nsweepers  although there are practically  no  such\r\n\r\nvacancies.   This  gives  rise  to   ~i   lot   of\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding between the registrants  and  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Exchange. In most cases, these  people\r\n\r\ngo  to  their M.P.s and complain. I wonder whether\r\n\r\nit  would not be desirable for the officers in the\r\n\r\nEmployment   Exchange  to  give  at   least   some\r\n\r\nindication to people who go there for registration\r\n\r\nas  to  how  long  they have to wait  for  certain\r\n\r\ncategories of jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I do not know whether that is a\r\n\r\nfeasible or wise suggestion.

Despite  the  rapid\r\n\r\nincrease  in the number of factories, the  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate has not had any increase in staff for\r\n\r\nso long.

The Factory Inspectorate at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  have only 20 staff. Of these,  a  few  are\r\n\r\noffice   boys,   messengers  and  process   notice\r\n\r\nservers, posts like that, so the establishment  is\r\n\r\nvery  much  under  strength.  Although  there   is\r\n\r\nprovision for 45 staff in the Inspectorate,  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  at  the moment there are, as I have  said,\r\n\r\nonly  20  staff. The Public Service Commission  is\r\n\r\nstill doing some recruitment exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the qualifications required of these\r\n\r\npeople, I cannot say offhand what they are for the\r\n\r\nvarious   grades  of  staff,  but   the   job   of\r\n\r\nrecruitment  is left with the P.S.C.  As  soon  as\r\n\r\nthey can get the candidates, the Inspectorate  can\r\n\r\nfunction. Until the Inspectorate has reached  such\r\n\r\na  stage that it feels there is the need to set up\r\n\r\na  branch in Jurong, I do not think steps will  be\r\n\r\ntaken to that effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong talks about the cases of\r\n\r\naccidents  and  the responsibility  involved.  For\r\n\r\n1970,  out  of a total of 9,682 cases,  81.14  per\r\n\r\ncent  of the accidents, that is 7,856 cases,  were\r\n\r\ndue  to  the  negligence  of  the  workers.  These\r\n\r\nfigures    are   compiled   from   the   Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation  Claims. A total of  81.14  per  cent\r\n\r\nwere due to the negligence of the workers; and 271\r\n\r\ncases,  that is 2.8 per cent, could be  attributed\r\n\r\nto the negligence of the employers. But there were\r\n\r\n1,555  cases  which  were,  I  would  call,   real\r\n\r\naccidents,  where nobody was really at  fault.  So\r\n\r\nyou  can  see from these comparative figures  that\r\n\r\nthe  workers themselves were largely to blame  for\r\n\r\nthe accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to safety measures, I have indicated earlier\r\n\r\non  that  the  new set of Building Operations  and\r\n\r\nWorks and of Engineering Construction Regulations,\r\n\r\n1971,  will  be  ready shortly,  and  it  will  be\r\n\r\nobligatory on the part of employers and  employees\r\n\r\nto  observe  the regulations set out.

Is  the\r\n\r\nFactory Inspectorate at this juncture sufficiently\r\n\r\nlarge  to  check the factories for the possibility\r\n\r\nof  introducing safety devices? Perhaps the  large\r\n\r\nnumber   of  accidents  which  the  Minister   has\r\n\r\nattributed to the negligence of the workers  could\r\n\r\nbe because of the lack of safety devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> No, Sir,If that is the case,\r\n\r\nthe  fault will lie with the employer, because  it\r\n\r\nis  the  duty  of the employer to see that  safety\r\n\r\ndevices  are there.

Although the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Katong may be quite right in saying that  the\r\n\r\nfilms were made quite some years back, the purpose\r\n\r\nof  the films is to show the danger of wearing the\r\n\r\nwrong type of apparel on the factory floor, and to\r\n\r\nget   across  the  idea  that  certain  types   of\r\n\r\nclothing,  even  the  long  hair  worn  by  female\r\n\r\nworkers in factories, could be a source of  danger\r\n\r\nto themselves. I think that is the whole idea, and\r\n\r\nnot  so  much  the kind of pants a factory  worker\r\n\r\nputs on today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, has the Minister of\r\n\r\nState  any plans to mount a campaign on industrial\r\n\r\nsafety as vigorously as the \"Keep Singapore Clean\"\r\n\r\ncampaign mounted by the Ministry of Health, or the\r\n\r\ncampaign to stop smoking, which is mounted by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, lately the N.T.U.C, has\r\n\r\nbeen  organising  many seminars  and  meetings  on\r\n\r\nsafety  measures, and I think that the Member  for\r\n\r\nKallang  was  instrumental in  calling  a  meeting\r\n\r\nimmediately after Dr Goh had made a speech at one\r\n\r\nof  the  seminars.

The\r\n\r\nreason  why  we are concerned with this particular\r\n\r\nsubject  is  that  we, as representatives  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  often  come  in close  contact  with  the\r\n\r\npeople  and therefore have talked with them  about\r\n\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizenship is concerned with the livelihood of\r\n\r\nour   people.  If  an  applicant  is   not   given\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  it  will give  rise  to  many  other\r\n\r\nproblems. First of all, he will not be able to get\r\n\r\na job. Because of this, his family will suffer and\r\n\r\nhis  wife and children will suffer too. This is  a\r\n\r\nvery  serious topic. I hope Members opposite  will\r\n\r\nnot joke about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully realise that in the last few years the Government was very strict about granting citizenship. The reason is that out country was faced with serious economic problems then and therefore we had to adopt a very strict policy and not grant citizenship readily. But I\r\n\r\nwish  to say that there were some aspects  of  the\r\n\r\npolicy which were incorrect or inappropriate.  Let\r\n\r\nme  take, for example, the case of a family in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency.   The  parents   are   citizens   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. Of their five children, four were  born\r\n\r\nin Singapore, and only one was born outside Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  other  words,  in  a  family  of  seven\r\n\r\nmembers, six are citizens of Singapore, and one is\r\n\r\na non-citizen. Sir, this non-citizen member of the\r\n\r\nfamily  has reached the age when he can apply  for\r\n\r\ncitizenship.   He  has  already  submitted   three\r\n\r\napplications  to the Registry of Citizenship,  but\r\n\r\nevery   one  has  been  rejected.  He  has   since\r\n\r\nsubmitted  his  application for the  fourth  time.\r\n\r\nThis  young boy normally is full of life and zeal,\r\n\r\nbut  because  time after time his application  has\r\n\r\nbeen   rejected,  he  has  become  very  dejected,\r\n\r\ndepressed and pessimistic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the circumstances of this case are\r\n\r\nnot  isolated.  There are many people  in  similar\r\n\r\ncircumstances. Therefore, we have to consider this\r\n\r\nquestion very seriously. If most of the members of\r\n\r\na  family  are citizens, where could a non-citizen\r\n\r\nmember turn to for a living? He must find a  means\r\n\r\nof  livelihood in Singapore so that he can  settle\r\n\r\ndown  and  have  his  own  family.  I  think  this\r\n\r\nquestion  should  be seriously considered  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister and he should instruct his department  to\r\n\r\ntreat  such cases with sympathy and not to  reject\r\n\r\nall applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is this. Our Minister has often\r\n\r\nsaid  that,  as more people are given citizenship,\r\n\r\nour burden becomes heavier. I quite agree with him\r\n\r\non  this point. I think some of the applicants for\r\n\r\ncitizenship need not impose an added burden on the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  For  example,  some  traders  have  a\r\n\r\nmonthly  income  of $500 to $600. Sometimes  their\r\n\r\nmonthly income is $300 to $400. This is sufficient\r\n\r\nfor  them to support their own families. There are\r\n\r\nsome  applicants  who  are hawkers  and  if  their\r\n\r\nbusiness   is   fair,   their   income   will   be\r\n\r\nconsiderable.  They  will,  therefore,  be  in   a\r\n\r\nposition  to support their own families.  However,\r\n\r\napplicants  who  are in this situation  have  also\r\n\r\nbeen rejected. I think perhaps the Government  has\r\n\r\nbeen  too  strict. Since these  people  are  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to support their families and  will  not\r\n\r\nimpose  an added burden on the Government, why  do\r\n\r\nwe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot approve their applications for citizenship  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can  be loyal citizens and  contribute\r\n\r\ntheir  bit  to  the country? On  behalf  of  these\r\n\r\npeople,  I  would  like to  ask  our  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider their situation sympathetically and solve\r\n\r\ntheir difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point I wish to raise. This\r\n\r\nconcerns  our  policy of foreign  investors.  What\r\n\r\nattitude  do  we  take in granting citizenship  to\r\n\r\nthem?  We  offer  them  facilities  to  stay  here\r\n\r\nbecause they are useful to the development of  our\r\n\r\neconomy. This is as it should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member has one minute left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Our Government\r\n\r\nhas  given these people preferential treatment.

They had no documentary evidence\r\n\r\nand  were  therefore  not  issued  with  the  pink\r\n\r\nlaminated identity cards during the last  exercise\r\n\r\nin  1966  to  replace  the paper  identity  cards.\r\n\r\nInstead they were issued with blue identity  cards\r\n\r\nand  were,  therefore, regarded  as  non-citizens.\r\n\r\nConsequently,  they had to make  applications  for\r\n\r\nregistration as Singapore citizens just  as  those\r\n\r\nwho    had    migrated   from   other   countries.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,   more  often   than   not,   their\r\n\r\napplications   were   not   given   any    special\r\n\r\nconsideration,  even  if  they   had   the   birth\r\n\r\ncertificates  of  their brothers  and  sisters  to\r\n\r\nsupport their cases.

At last  year's  budget\r\n\r\nsitting,  the  Minister for Labour stated  clearly\r\n\r\nthat  the granting of citizenship was a matter  of\r\n\r\nprivilege  and  not of right.  He  said  that  the\r\n\r\ncriterion  for  the  granting of  citizenship  was\r\n\r\nwhether the applicant was going to be an asset  to\r\n\r\nour country. While I fully agree with the Minister\r\n\r\non  this,  I wish to point out that this principle\r\n\r\napplies  more  appropriately to  people  who  have\r\n\r\nmoney  to  invest  in Singapore or  who  have  the\r\n\r\nspecial  skills  required in  Singapore's  growing\r\n\r\nindustries. However, there are some people who  do\r\n\r\nnot  fall  within  these two  categories,  and  to\r\n\r\nrefuse  them  citizenship would cause hardship  to\r\n\r\nthem,  especially as they are, in  fact,  eligible\r\n\r\nfor citizenship. In this respect, Sir, allow me to\r\n\r\ncite the case of a Singapore citizen who has died,\r\n\r\nleaving  behind a widow with several children  who\r\n\r\nwere  all  born in Singapore. She has applied  for\r\n\r\ncitizenship. If she is not granted citizenship, it\r\n\r\nwill  be  difficult for her to get a job.  If  she\r\n\r\ncannot get a job, how is she going to support  her\r\n\r\nchildren who were born in Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case I wish to quote is that of a girl\r\n\r\nwho  was  born in Malaysia. Soon after her  birth,\r\n\r\nher  mother died and she was brought to  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  taken  care of by her grandfather  who  is  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen. She is now 24 years  old.  All\r\n\r\nthese  years she has had her education  here,  and\r\n\r\nhas never left Singapore even for a short holiday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not suggesting that the Minister should open the door and allow all and sundry who wish to work in Singapore to be given citizenship. But I would like to know whether the Minister will give due consideration to deserving cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question\r\n\r\nof  applications for citizenship has been  brought\r\n\r\nup  in this House every year, like the playing  of\r\n\r\nan old record. The reason why it is being taken up\r\n\r\nevery  year  is that citizenship is  of  paramount\r\n\r\nimportance  to everyone who has been  residing  in\r\n\r\nthe  republic for many years. Sir, this House  has\r\n\r\nheard many grouses and suggestions even at today's\r\n\r\nsitting.  Sir, if you will recall,  in  answer  to\r\n\r\nMembers of this House last year, that the Minister\r\n\r\nof  State  for  Labour stated that the  policy  of\r\n\r\ngranting  citizenship would be reviewed from  time\r\n\r\nto  time.  My  question is this: can the  Minister\r\n\r\ntell  Members  of this House what is  the  present\r\n\r\npolicy? In his budget statement, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  has stated that our economy is improving,\r\n\r\nthe  industries are going very well,  and  we  are\r\n\r\nshort  of  workers. Sir, if that is  the  case,  I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether  citizenship will  be  granted  to\r\n\r\nthose  who  really want to stay  in  the  republic\r\n\r\nthroughout all their lives and who want to be  the\r\n\r\nsons of the soil in this place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

In\r\n\r\nview  of  and subsequent to the various criticisms\r\n\r\nlevelled at the Government during the last  budget\r\n\r\ndebate,   has  there  been  any  change   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy on citizenship?  From  my  own\r\n\r\nexperience,   I   notice   that   applicants   for\r\n\r\ncitizenship  have  to wait much longer  than  ever\r\n\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been no apparent improvement at all in\r\n\r\nthe processing of applications by the Registry  of\r\n\r\nCitizenship.  The  only improvement  that  can  be\r\n\r\ncredited to the Registry is the prompt response to\r\n\r\nan inquiry by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament about applications which may\r\n\r\nbe  pending  for  two  years  or  even  more.  The\r\n\r\nRegistry, undoubtedly, is of the view that it  has\r\n\r\nconscientiously  discharged its duty  by  promptly\r\n\r\ninforming  us that the application is still  under\r\n\r\nactive consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members who have spoken previously have\r\n\r\nmentioned particular cases. Sir, may I also  point\r\n\r\nout  a particular case where the prompt reply from\r\n\r\nthe  Registry  would make all  and  sundry  laugh,\r\n\r\nespecially  at the manner in which the  reply  was\r\n\r\ngiven.  The parents, brothers and sisters of  this\r\n\r\napplicant  for  citizenship are all citizens.  The\r\n\r\nparents  applied  for  minor citizenship  for  the\r\n\r\nperson concerned when she was almost 18 years old.\r\n\r\nNext  month  this applicant would  have  become  a\r\n\r\nmajor, that is, she would have passed 21 years  of\r\n\r\nage,  and when an appeal was made, because in  one\r\n\r\nmonth's  time  her  minor citizenship  application\r\n\r\nwould be invalidated because she would be 21 years\r\n\r\nold,   the  usual  cyclostyled  reply  was,  \"Your\r\n\r\napplication is under active consideration.\"  There\r\n\r\nneed not be any consideration, Sir, because in one\r\n\r\nand a half month's time the application would have\r\n\r\nbecome  invalidated. That was the immediate reply.\r\n\r\nNobody ever sees the appeal made on behalf of  any\r\n\r\napplicant. This particular applicant is in one  of\r\n\r\nthe  tertiary institutions receiving remission  of\r\n\r\ntuition fees because her parents are citizens  and\r\n\r\nbecause  this applicant is a minor at the  moment.\r\n\r\nWhen  the next term in the university begins,  she\r\n\r\nis  not  going to receive a remission  of  tuition\r\n\r\nfees  because,  in her own right,  she  becomes  a\r\n\r\nmajor and, as a result, loses this remission. This\r\n\r\nafternoon  we  have  heard  that  the  number   of\r\n\r\nbursaries is to be limited. Hardship cases of this\r\n\r\nnature should receive at least some consideration,\r\n\r\nor  the  grounds  for appeal should  at  least  be\r\n\r\nlooked  into. No. Sir, it was just a prompt  reply\r\n\r\nfrom the Registry of Citizenship. That is all that\r\n\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should have thought that instead of just\r\n\r\nreplying promptly, the Registry would need further\r\n\r\nreactivation.  I hope the Minister  can  enlighten\r\n\r\nMembers on the following points:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the total number of (a) applications\r\n\r\nfor    citizenship    received;    and    (b)\r\n\r\napplications  approved; and (c)  applications\r\n\r\nrejected during the year 1970?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is the prolongation of the processing period\r\n\r\nfor   citizenship  applications  due   to   a\r\n\r\nconscious  and  deliberate  policy   of   the\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministry or the inability of the Registry to\r\n\r\ncope with the volume of work?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What is the longest period for citizenship\r\n\r\napplications to be considered? Is it possible\r\n\r\nto speed up the procedure for the issue of  a\r\n\r\ncitizenship certificate to a minor  applicant\r\n\r\nwho  is  the only non-citizen in a family  of\r\n\r\ncitizens?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am also\r\n\r\nconcerned  with certain categories  of  applicants\r\n\r\nfor   citizenship  whose  applications  have  been\r\n\r\nrejected. I wish to explain the categories that  I\r\n\r\nhave  in  mind.  I  shall explain  by  quoting  an\r\n\r\nexample.  The parents, brothers and sisters  of  a\r\n\r\ncertain  applicant are all Singapore  citizens  by\r\n\r\nbirth.  This  particular  applicant  was  born  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  by  accident. By accident, I  mean  this\r\n\r\nparticular  applicant was born  when  the  parents\r\n\r\nwere  living temporarily for three months in Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur   because   the  applicant's   father   was\r\n\r\ntransferred  there  for about three  months  only.\r\n\r\nSince  then, this applicant has never been out  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and has always been here, educated  here\r\n\r\nand lived here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, in replying to queries made last year, said that citizenship would not be granted to those who were a burden to Singapore. This person whom I have mentioned cannot go anywhere and will be a burden to Singapore, whether he is granted Singapore citizenship or not. I appeal to\r\n\r\nthe Minister to consider this case and similar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncases  sympathetically.  This  person  cannot   go\r\n\r\nanywhere,  cannot  get any other citizenship,  and\r\n\r\nhis   future  is  also  affected.  He  cannot  get\r\n\r\nemployment. Where can he go?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to associate myself with the view\r\n\r\naired  by  the  Member  for  Telok  Blangah   that\r\n\r\ndecisions  on  applications be  made  as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible and the applicants be notified as quickly\r\n\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I crave\r\n\r\nyour  indulgence and the indulgence of this  House\r\n\r\nto  relate  another pathetic example  of  a  minor\r\n\r\ncitizen  who, as a result of his failure  to  take\r\n\r\nthe  oath  of  allegiance, has had his citizenship\r\n\r\nwithdrawn.  I  think this was unnecessary  if  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar   of   Citizens   had   exercised   some\r\n\r\ndiscretion in the implementation of the policy  on\r\n\r\nthe  granting  of citizenship. May  I  relate  the\r\n\r\nridiculous  situation  in  which  this  particular\r\n\r\nperson  faced?  He  was granted minor  citizenship\r\n\r\nand,  in  many other cases, on the certificate  of\r\n\r\nthe  minor citizenship there is a reminder to  the\r\n\r\neffect  that  he must take the oath of  allegiance\r\n\r\nwhen  he  reaches  the age  of  21.  But  in  this\r\n\r\nparticular  case, somehow or other,  there  was  a\r\n\r\nclerical  error  or there was an omission  on  the\r\n\r\npart  of the staff of the Registry of Citizenship,\r\n\r\nand  this  was not done. So there was really  very\r\n\r\ngood  reason  for  the  person  concerned  to   be\r\n\r\nignorant of the fact that he had to take the  oath\r\n\r\nof  allegiance when he reaches the age of  21.  We\r\n\r\nmust  not expect every citizen to have the law  at\r\n\r\nhis  finger-tips.  At the same time,  this  person\r\n\r\nreceived a scholarship from the Teachers' Training\r\n\r\nCollege to be a technical teacher. He went for the\r\n\r\nteacher-training   course    on    a    Government\r\n\r\nscholarship  which stipulates that  only  citizens\r\n\r\ncan  be  granted that scholarship. When he applied\r\n\r\nfor  the scholarship, his age was 19 plus. He  got\r\n\r\nthe   scholarship  because  he  was  a   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen.   Before  he  completed   the   training,\r\n\r\nhowever,  his  citizenship was withdrawn  because,\r\n\r\nwhen  he  passed  the age of 21, the  Registry  of\r\n\r\nCitizenship discovered\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  he had not taken the oath of allegiance  and\r\n\r\nso  withdrew his minor citizenship. This person is\r\n\r\nnow  in a predicament. I wrote to the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  and  enquired about  his  position  and\r\n\r\nwhether  he  was going to continue  receiving  the\r\n\r\nscholarship  in  the Teachers'  Training  College.\r\n\r\nSir,  when  there is a shortage of teachers  these\r\n\r\ndays,  nobody can deny the fact that  anybody  who\r\n\r\ntakes  up teacher training, in technical education\r\n\r\nis making a contribution to the country. Up to now\r\n\r\nI  have neither received a reply from the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education  nor a reply from  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour as to whether immediate consideration would\r\n\r\nbe  given  to this particular case in  giving  him\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  This  was  a  clear   case   of   an\r\n\r\nunfortunate incident in which the person concerned\r\n\r\nshould  not be entirely blamed because, as I  have\r\n\r\nsaid, in other cases there is a reminder that  the\r\n\r\nperson  must take the oath of allegiance  when  he\r\n\r\nreaches  the  age of 21. In this particular  case,\r\n\r\nthe reminder was not there. This is one example in\r\n\r\nmy  constituency. There are many more examples  to\r\n\r\nshow  that the Ministry of Labour is going  a  bit\r\n\r\ntoo   far   when   they  decide   on   citizenship\r\n\r\napplications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is one of\r\n\r\nthose  items in the budget where I have to  repeat\r\n\r\nwhat I said during the last two years. I am quite-reconciled to this ritual because I do not think I\r\n\r\nam  going to convince Members of my point of view.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no doubt that I will remain unconvinced\r\n\r\nas regards their points of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let me say that we are well aware that\r\n\r\nthe rigid application of our citizenship laws does\r\n\r\ncause hardships. But there are many laws and a law\r\n\r\nis   a   general  principle  applied  to  specific\r\n\r\nsituations  and  invariably there  are  individual\r\n\r\ncases which do not fit into the general structure.\r\n\r\nAsk  any  lawyer, and he will tell you that  there\r\n\r\nare no other ways of formulating laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of citizenship laws, we have to\r\n\r\nbalance one principle against the other. If I  may\r\n\r\nrepeat what I have repeatedly said, Singapore is a\r\n\r\nsmall island and we have serious economic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblems  affecting two million people, and  until\r\n\r\nwe  are quite convinced that we can cope with  and\r\n\r\nsatisfy  and protect the interests of our citizens\r\n\r\nfirst,  we  are  not going to open  our  doors  to\r\n\r\ncitizenship for whatever reasons (some of them are\r\n\r\nno  doubt  cogent) for -- I cannot give the  exact\r\n\r\nfigures  - but probably they are in the region  of\r\n\r\n20,000 to 30,000 cases. This problem will cease to\r\n\r\nexist  as  the  years go on,  because  this  is  a\r\n\r\nproblem  which  resulted from our separation  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia, and is one of the consequences  we  have\r\n\r\nto  accept.  The principle always is  that  if  we\r\n\r\ngrant  citizenship to a non-citizen,  the  primary\r\n\r\nconsideration must be and will be: is  it  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of Singapore? Will he constitute a burden\r\n\r\nto  Singapore? Because if you make an exception in\r\n\r\nthe  case of one, you must be prepared to make  an\r\n\r\nexception for the others. It is an unfortunate and\r\n\r\ndifficult  matter. But it is a choice we  have  to\r\n\r\nmake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that the policy has never changed. We\r\n\r\nnever  said  that  we  were going  to  change  the\r\n\r\npolicy.  But in the implementation of the  policy,\r\n\r\nas  far as is possible, we do make adjustments and\r\n\r\nexercise discretion, but it must not infringe  the\r\n\r\nbasic  principle  that  we  enunciate,  that   the\r\n\r\napplicant  for citizenship does not  constitute  a\r\n\r\nburden to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it was the Member for Mountbatten who\r\n\r\nsaid that in case of doubt, give the applicant the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  the doubt and therefore  create  more\r\n\r\ncitizens. We are not prepared to treat citizenship\r\n\r\nin  such a light-hearted fashion where we give the\r\n\r\nbenefit of the doubt to not one or two but tens of\r\n\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I said that\r\n\r\nwe  give  the benefit of the doubt to those  cases\r\n\r\nwho  can  support  their applications  with  birth\r\n\r\ncertificates of their brothers and sisters who are\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> A point that has repeatedly been\r\n\r\nmade  is that if a person is a non-citizen, he  is\r\n\r\nstarving.   I   say  that  any  non-citizen,   and\r\n\r\nespecially those who hold blue identity cards, can\r\n\r\nget\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwork  permits  to work in Singapore today.  Unless\r\n\r\nthe  man is incapable of work or cannot contribute\r\n\r\nin   any   way  to  the  economic  well-being   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  he  can get work. Therefore,  to  that\r\n\r\nextent, even if he is a non-citizen, he can earn a\r\n\r\nliving if he is prepared to take the kind of  work\r\n\r\nthat  is  offered  to him. Therefore,  that  point\r\n\r\nraised  is  not  a cogent reason for  opening  the\r\n\r\ndoors  to  citizenship. If it were only to  a  few\r\n\r\nhundred cases, we would have said, \"Open the doors\r\n\r\nand  change our policy.\" But it involves  tens  of\r\n\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the specific cases that have been\r\n\r\nmentioned  -  there were so many of them  -  I  am\r\n\r\nalways  loath  to  make judgments  purely  on  the\r\n\r\npresentation  of the case from one  side.  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen  a newspaper man. I know how to write stories\r\n\r\nwhich  are  factually correct but  which  are  not\r\n\r\ntrue.  So a case may be right, or it may be wrong.\r\n\r\nI  would  not like to make a pronouncement  unless\r\n\r\nand   until  those  Members  who  have  given  the\r\n\r\ninstances  refer them to me or to the Minister  of\r\n\r\nState for Labour, and we will look into them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that the Members are right, in which\r\n\r\nevent  we will give these cases consideration.  It\r\n\r\nmay  be  that most of the stories related in  this\r\n\r\nHouse   are  not  correct,  in  which   case   the\r\n\r\napplications will have to be rejected. A number of\r\n\r\nthe cases no doubt conform to the principle of our\r\n\r\npolicy,  that where all members of the family  are\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens but one who, for one reason  or\r\n\r\nother,  missed  the boat but who  will  not  be  a\r\n\r\nburden to Singapore, his application will be given\r\n\r\nsympathetic    consideration.   The    over-riding\r\n\r\nprinciple is whether he will be an economic burden\r\n\r\nto  Singapore. If today a man is a hawker  and  is\r\n\r\njust  able to provide for himself and his  family,\r\n\r\nthat  does not mean that a year from now  he  will\r\n\r\nnot  constitute an economic burden to  the  state.\r\n\r\nBut  if we are convinced that this man will, on  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  assumption, continue  to  provide  for\r\n\r\nhimself, and all members of his family are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore   citizens,  then  his  case   will   be\r\n\r\nsympathetically considered. I know of a number  of\r\n\r\ncases where favourable consideration was given  to\r\n\r\none  member  of the family who for one  reason  or\r\n\r\nother could not be a Singapore citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Telok Blangah who\r\n\r\nwants   to   know   how  many   applications   for\r\n\r\ncitizenship  have  been approved  or  rejected,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  say offhand, but if he will write  in,  we\r\n\r\ncan  provide the necessary statistics. May I  give\r\n\r\nMembers  the advice that I give to members  of  my\r\n\r\nconstituency? I get lots of people  who,  for  one\r\n\r\nreason or other, come to see me about citizenship.\r\n\r\nI  give them one very sound piece of advice  which\r\n\r\nhas been referred to as criticism of the Ministry.\r\n\r\nLots of people have made applications and they get\r\n\r\nthis ritualistic reply saying, \"It is under active\r\n\r\nconsideration.\" The people come to me  saying,  \"I\r\n\r\nhave  been  under consideration for the  last  two\r\n\r\nyears.\" I tell them, \"I can give you a note to the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Citizens asking him to look into your\r\n\r\ncase, but the chances are that if you press him to\r\n\r\nmake  a decision now, he must reject it under  the\r\n\r\nexisting  policy.  The  fact  that  it  is   under\r\n\r\nconsideration means that if, at some future  time,\r\n\r\nfor  a variety of reasons, we find that we can let\r\n\r\nin more non-citizens, then, if you are still under\r\n\r\nconsideration, maybe you will be among  those  who\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to g-et in. So if  you  press  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  to make a decision now, you  do  it  at\r\n\r\nyour own risk.\" Some of them never believed me and\r\n\r\nsure  enough when they pressed for a reply  -  the\r\n\r\nofficer had to make a decision - he was forced  to\r\n\r\nmake  a decision and under existing policy it must\r\n\r\nbe  \"no\". So this is the advice I give and Members\r\n\r\nshould  give to their constituents, that where  no\r\n\r\ndecision has been made, it is best to let sleeping\r\n\r\ndogs  lie and do not force the officials concerned\r\n\r\nat  the moment because the policy is a clear  one.\r\n\r\nBut  if  the applicant is going to be an  economic\r\n\r\nliability, the answer is no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I have received  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of complaints from factory employers  that\r\n\r\ntheir  applications  for work  permits  have  been\r\n\r\nunduly  delayed, in some cases,  for  as  long  as\r\n\r\nthree  to  four months without a reply. It  is  my\r\n\r\nview   that  this  delay  is  causing  unnecessary\r\n\r\ndifficulty to the factories involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember that during the budget debate last year the Minister for Labour stated that the rules relating to the applications for work permits would be relaxed to some extent. In fact today he himself has stated that non-citizens are also eligible to apply for work permits which will be given on sympathetic\r\n\r\ngrounds. This is a very welcome piece of  news  to\r\n\r\nmany  people.  We all know that our factories  are\r\n\r\nshort  of  workers, particularly skilled  workers.\r\n\r\nManual workers are also in acute shortage in  some\r\n\r\nplaces. Therefore, the Work Permits Office  should\r\n\r\nassist   the   factories  involved   by   speedier\r\n\r\nprocessing of their applications for work  permits\r\n\r\nand  granting them quickly. The work in  the  Work\r\n\r\nPermits  Office  should  be  spread  out.  I  have\r\n\r\nreceived  many  complaints from various  factories\r\n\r\nabout unnecessary delays. I do not know the actual\r\n\r\nreason  for  the  delay. It is my  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will look into the matter and  find  out\r\n\r\nwhether  there is any good reason at all  for  the\r\n\r\ndelay.  If there is, it should be explained.  Does\r\n\r\nthe delay mean that the relaxation of the rules in\r\n\r\nrespect of work permits is being reconsidered?  If\r\n\r\nnot,  it is probably the failure of the Government\r\n\r\nservants concerned to speed up their work.  It  is\r\n\r\nmy  hope  that  the Minister will  supervise  more\r\n\r\nclosely the work of the civil servants involved so\r\n\r\nas  to  improve the efficiency of the Work Permits\r\n\r\nOffice.

It is\r\n\r\na   well-known  fact  that  although  construction\r\n\r\nworkers   are  in  great  demand,  they  are   not\r\n\r\navailable.  Now  and then we hear of  workers  who\r\n\r\nhave  lost their lives in the construction  field.\r\n\r\nIf  we  enquire who the persons are, we will  know\r\n\r\nthat  they  are from Malaysia. Likewise, motor-car\r\n\r\ndrivers are not at all available in Singapore now.\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds of vacancies for drivers in the\r\n\r\nGovernment itself, but these have not been  filled\r\n\r\nfor  years.  The Minister of State for  Labour  is\r\n\r\npersonally  aware of this fact. I have also  heard\r\n\r\nthat in the army, there are thousands of vacancies\r\n\r\nfor  drivers  of  army vehicles.  A  lot  of  army\r\n\r\nvehicles  are not being used because  drivers  are\r\n\r\nnot  available.  As such, will the  Government  do\r\n\r\nsomething  to  relieve this shortage by  liberally\r\n\r\nissuing  work permits to those who can be employed\r\n\r\nas drivers and construction workers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I wish to seek clarification  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister as to what constitutes skilled labour. As\r\n\r\nan example, if a restaurant advertises for a cook,\r\n\r\nand if no suitable applicant is available, can the\r\n\r\nproprietor employ a cook from overseas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho Kah Leong?

So  a  meeting  was  held  between   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Labour and the Singapore Contractors'\r\n\r\nAssociation to simplify the procedure of  applying\r\n\r\nfor  and  issuing of work permits,  and  this  was\r\n\r\nimplemented.

The revision is  almost\r\n\r\ncompletely  processed, and  is  just  waiting  for\r\n\r\ncertain  formalities. It is the intention  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to revise the compensation  upward  by\r\n\r\nroughly  three  times  the  present  amount.   For\r\n\r\nexample, in the case of an injured worker below 40\r\n\r\nyears  of  age,  the  present  maximum  lump   sum\r\n\r\ncompensation of $7,200 will, I think, be raised to\r\n\r\nwell  over  $21,000.  So if  Government  employees\r\n\r\ncontinue   to  get  involved  in  accidents,   the\r\n\r\nprovision of $27,000 may be much more at the  next\r\n\r\nbudget session.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to follow up,\r\n\r\nmay  I  ask  the Minister whether his Ministry  is\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  all claims  for  accidents  that\r\n\r\noccur   in   the   various  departments   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment?

Therefore, I  do  not  wish  to\r\n\r\nrepeat it again. The reason for fixing the sum  at\r\n\r\n$8,000 this year is that last year we spent  about\r\n\r\n$4,800   of  the  provision.

I believe the Minister  has\r\n\r\npublicly  announced  that  he  has  accepted  this\r\n\r\nreport in principle. I do not know whether he will\r\n\r\nfollow   strictly  the  recommendations  contained\r\n\r\ntherein,  or  whether there will be  a  subsequent\r\n\r\nrevision.  As the report stands at the moment,  it\r\n\r\nlooks  as  if  the  people in my constituency  are\r\n\r\ngoing to be left with much less bus services  than\r\n\r\nthey  have at present. For instance, route numbers\r\n\r\n5  and 6, which I think are known to the Minister,\r\n\r\nwill be withdrawn and the total number of buses in\r\n\r\nservice will also be substantially reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I would ask the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider  is  that  the minimum  fare  for  school\r\n\r\nchildren should remain at five cents and  not  ten\r\n\r\ncents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\nanswer the Member for Jalan Kayu in respect of the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of the Wilson Bus  Study.  It  was\r\n\r\nclearly  stated  that  the  recommendations   were\r\n\r\naccepted in principle, with or without amendments.\r\n\r\nThe  basic  principles have been  accepted.  There\r\n\r\nwill  be re-routing and re-allocating of the  120-odd  bus routes which before were operated  by  11\r\n\r\nbus  companies  but which will be re-allocated  to\r\n\r\nfour  bus  companies. The implementation date  has\r\n\r\nbeen  fixed  for 11th April, which is  only  about\r\n\r\nthree weeks from now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases of reorganisation, one must\r\n\r\nanticipate  difficulties during  the  transitional\r\n\r\nperiod. A massive operation like this is bound  to\r\n\r\ncreate  certain  difficulties.  It  must  not   be\r\n\r\nassumed  that  the previous routes allocated  were\r\n\r\nideal  routes. They were put up before the Omnibus\r\n\r\nServices  Licensing Authority  for  approval.  But\r\n\r\nunder  the  new  Bus Services Licensing  Authority\r\n\r\nAct, which was passed in this House recently and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  is now in operation, it is the Bus Services\r\n\r\nLicensing  Authority which decides on the  routes.\r\n\r\nIt  may  happen that there will be alterations  to\r\n\r\nthe bus routes that used to run from Jalan Kayu to\r\n\r\nvarious parts of Singapore. I can only plead  that\r\n\r\nthe  bus users try to accept the changes and allow\r\n\r\na period of six months for the system to work. The\r\n\r\nnewly constituted Bus Services Licensing Authority\r\n\r\nwill  look into all the difficulties that  may  be\r\n\r\nencountered and amendments may have to be made.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it is only fair that some time should  pass\r\n\r\nbefore  a  proper  study  can  be  made  and   the\r\n\r\nimplications  felt before further changes  can  be\r\n\r\nmade. If we go round the city, we can see that new\r\n\r\nbus  poles  have been erected. The number  is  not\r\n\r\nsmall.  As  many  as 2,500 poles will  be  erected\r\n\r\nalong  the main routes of Singapore. We cannot  be\r\n\r\nchopping  and  changing  the  routes  with   every\r\n\r\nrequest made for consideration. We have officially\r\n\r\nstated that all the requests will be considered in\r\n\r\ndue  time.  But the 130 routes which have  already\r\n\r\nbeen  approved for the four bus companies will  go\r\n\r\ninto operation on Sunday, 11th April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the suggestion by the Member for Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu  to  continue with the minimum fare  of  five\r\n\r\ncents for school children, I am afraid that he has\r\n\r\nstressed  only  one aspect of  the  new  bus  fare\r\n\r\nstructure   and   has  forgotten  completely   the\r\n\r\nreductions  in bus fares where they are applicable\r\n\r\nto  long  distances. In the past, 10 bus companies\r\n\r\nwere  entitled  to  charge a maximum  fare  of  80\r\n\r\ncents.  This has been reduced to 50 cents. And  we\r\n\r\nhave  the usual silent majority! When there  is  a\r\n\r\nbenefit, nobody talks about it. But when  a  five-cent minimum rate is raised to 10 cents, everybody\r\n\r\ntalks  about  it.  The  five-cent  rate  is   only\r\n\r\napplicable for the first mile for school  children\r\n\r\nwhen travelling in S.T.C, buses today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the 10 other companies. It is five\r\n\r\ncents for the first two miles and it goes right up\r\n\r\nto  40 cents.

For adults,  the  minimum\r\n\r\nfare being charged by the S.T.C, is 10 cents. But,\r\n\r\nof  course, the Chinese bus companies are charging\r\n\r\nfive  cents  for the first mile. I am afraid  this\r\n\r\nminimum   fare  of  five  cents  is  not  strictly\r\n\r\ncorrect, but even if it is correct -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my point is\r\n\r\nthat   the   minimum  of  five  cents  should   be\r\n\r\napplicable to school children and not to adults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I am glad to say that\r\n\r\nthere has been no change in the bus fare structure\r\n\r\nfor  the last 20 years. When one thinks about  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  prices, not only of commodities  but\r\n\r\nother  things  -  I  think  there  is  practically\r\n\r\nnothing  that has not increased in price over  the\r\n\r\nlast  20  years - if we think along  those  lines,\r\n\r\nthen  an increase of five cents should be, if  not\r\n\r\nwell  received,  then at least with understanding.\r\n\r\nBesides,  if  we  are  to ask  for  a  better  and\r\n\r\nimproved  bus  service, surely  we  will  have  to\r\n\r\naccept  a  slight increase in bus fares, although,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  the  increase  may  affect  school\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also take into consideration the fact\r\n\r\nthat  nothing is for free in Singapore.  There  is\r\n\r\nalways a price to be paid for the service that  we\r\n\r\nget.  The  best  example is water. It  is  raining\r\n\r\noutside  this House at this moment. The  water  is\r\n\r\nfree.  It comes from the sky in torrents. But  the\r\n\r\nwater  from  the  sky  has  to  be  collected   in\r\n\r\nreservoirs  which  cost  millions  of  dollars  to\r\n\r\nbuild. The water has to be purified. Pipes have to\r\n\r\nbe  laid  and again they cost millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nEven free water has to be paid for. So I regret to\r\n\r\nsay  that,  despite some agitation, the  bus  fare\r\n\r\nstructure  has  been decided and  will  come  into\r\n\r\noperation in three weeks' time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for\r\n\r\nthe  explanation  and  beg leave  to  withdraw  my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $418,720 for Head 0701 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0703 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

Airport\r\n\r\nhostesses  proficient in Tamil should be  employed\r\n\r\nbecause  the  airport is a place where  foreigners\r\n\r\narrive    and   when   they   listen   to    these\r\n\r\nannouncements, they might think that  our  airport\r\n\r\nhostesses are not qualified in languages  or  that\r\n\r\nour Government is employing incompetent people  to\r\n\r\nthese posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

We went  to\r\n\r\nthe   airport  several  times  but  we  could  not\r\n\r\nunderstand   the  announcements   in   the   Tamil\r\n\r\nlanguage. They are not properly made and the Tamil-speaking  \r\n\r\npeople at the airport find it  difficult\r\n\r\nto understand them. Therefore, the Minister should\r\n\r\ninstruct  the  Civil  Aviation  Department   that,\r\n\r\nbefore  recruiting any Tamil announcer, applicants\r\n\r\nshould  be tested in fluency in Tamil.

Recently,  I found  that  the  airport\r\n\r\nhostesses made announcements in only two languages\r\n\r\n-  Malay  and English. It seems Tamil and  Chinese\r\n\r\nwere  omitted. I hope the Minister can  look  into\r\n\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is that in the plane only Malay\r\n\r\nand  English  are used.

In  the\r\n\r\npast, announcements were made not only in the four\r\n\r\nofficial languages but also in the various Chinese\r\n\r\ndialects.  But  nowadays this  is  no  longer  the\r\n\r\npractice.  I hope the Minister can also look  into\r\n\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to\r\n\r\nnotice the great interest taken by Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse   in   our  airport  hostesses   and   their\r\n\r\nactivities.  I  am afraid I am in no  position  to\r\n\r\njudge  whether  the Tamil which is spoken  by  the\r\n\r\nTamil-speaking  airport hostesses  is  correct.  I\r\n\r\naccept  the  verdict of the two  Members  on  this\r\n\r\nscore.  But  may I say that airport hostesses  are\r\n\r\nsupposed  to have the qualifications of  a  School\r\n\r\nCertificate  and they have to pass  a  voice  test\r\n\r\nconducted by our Broadcasting Department. At least\r\n\r\nthree  of them are supposed to be able to converse\r\n\r\nin  English,  Malay  and Tamil.  In  view  of  the\r\n\r\ncriticisms  that  have been levelled  by  the  two\r\n\r\nMembers, I will have to request the Tamil Division\r\n\r\nof  the Broadcasting -Department to interview them\r\n\r\nand  see  whether  they are up  to  the  mark,  or\r\n\r\nrequest that in future they should conduct a  very\r\n\r\nstringent  voice test so that what they  speak  is\r\n\r\nintelligible Tamil and not unintelligible Tamil. I\r\n\r\njust  cannot make out whether it is Tamil  or  not\r\n\r\nTamil.  These are the requirements and I can  only\r\n\r\nask   the   parties  that  are  supposed   to   be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for the test to pay due attention  to\r\n\r\nthis question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang says that, in his view,\r\n\r\nannouncements at the airport seem to be made  only\r\n\r\nin  English  and  Malay and not in Chinese.  There\r\n\r\nagain-  I beg to differ. According to our records,\r\n\r\nthere  are at least eight of the airport hostesses\r\n\r\nwho  are  supposed  to be conversant  in  Chinese,\r\n\r\nEnglish and Malay. It may be that at the time  the\r\n\r\nMember  was at the airport, the plane that arrived\r\n\r\nwas  probably  a B.O.A.C, or a Qantas  plane'  and\r\n\r\ntherefore the airport hostess used English. But if\r\n\r\nit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  a  China Airlines aircraft that came in,  it\r\n\r\nwas  likely that the airport hostess on duty might\r\n\r\nhave  used Mandarin. I think it would be difficult\r\n\r\nto   use   Hokkien,  Cantonese  or  other  Chinese\r\n\r\ndialect. One of the official languages is Mandarin\r\n\r\nand  I think we will have to stick to that.

In the past our postal service\r\n\r\nhad a good reputation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  it  was  efficient. Mails were  delivered\r\n\r\nquite  fast. Normally when a letter was  sent,  it\r\n\r\ncould  be received the following day. But recently\r\n\r\nI  have  received complaints regarding  delays  in\r\n\r\ndelivery  of letters. I personally also have  this\r\n\r\nexperience. Sometimes it would take two  or  three\r\n\r\ndays  before  I received a letter. Even  a  letter\r\n\r\nsent  by Parliament was received after three days.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this does not speak well for the postal\r\n\r\nservices.  I  understand that  as  the  population\r\n\r\nincreases,  the  volume of mails  also  increased.\r\n\r\nHowever, we have to maintain the efficiency of our\r\n\r\npostal  services. Maybe we need  to  increase  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  staff. This can be a  solution.  If  a\r\n\r\nletter is delayed too long, especially when it  is\r\n\r\nurgent,  it  may cause a great deal of trouble.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister can take steps to remedy  this\r\n\r\nabnormal situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to raise is about\r\n\r\nthe  wrong  delivery of letters. For  instance,  a\r\n\r\nletter  was addressed to \"A\", but it was delivered\r\n\r\nto  \"B\".  Even  I  myself have had  this  sort  of\r\n\r\nexperience.  Letters were wrongly delivered.  This\r\n\r\nwill  also affect people in certain ways,  because\r\n\r\nif  a person has not received his letter there may\r\n\r\nbe  some delay or inconvenience at his end. I hope\r\n\r\nin  this  respect the Postmaster-General  and  his\r\n\r\nsenior  officers  will supervise the  staff  under\r\n\r\nthem and build up a more efficient postal service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

However, at times when the heavily-loaded\r\n\r\nparcels  are  too  bulky  to  be  carried  on  the\r\n\r\nbicycle,  it  will be appreciated if the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  advise the Postal Department to arrange  for\r\n\r\nsuch heavy mails to be delivered by postal vans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to bring to the\r\n\r\nattention  of  the  Minister is  the  insufficient\r\n\r\nnumber of bicycles in our Postal Department. There\r\n\r\nseems  to  be no replacement of bicycles  whenever\r\n\r\nthere  is a break-down. In order to cope with  the\r\n\r\ncurrent   shortage  of  bicycles  in  the   Postal\r\n\r\nDepartment, I would suggest that it purchase  more\r\n\r\nlocally-assembled bicycles instead of buying  them\r\n\r\nfrom foreign countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is the motor-cycle service. This\r\n\r\nservice  in our postal department is used only  to\r\n\r\nmake distant deliveries. However, it is my opinion\r\n\r\nand  belief that if more motor-cycles are used for\r\n\r\ndelivery  of mails, there will be less  complaints\r\n\r\nfrom the general public because the mails will  be\r\n\r\ndelivered faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told that some postmen are not only working\r\n\r\nbeyond their official duties, but are also pressed\r\n\r\nby   their   immediate  superiors.  At  the   last\r\n\r\nParliamentary  sitting I put  a  question  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  regarding this problem. I  had  a  reply\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Communications saying that  no  such  problem\r\n\r\nexisted.  Therefore I would ask the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommunications to form a committee to  investigate\r\n\r\nwhat is happening in the Postal Department. May  I\r\n\r\nknow if the Minister will look into and regularise\r\n\r\nthe conditions of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice  of  the  postmen. It is known  that  many\r\n\r\npostmen  left their jobs because of this. How  did\r\n\r\nthey leave? They absented themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like the Minister to reply\r\n\r\nto is that I notice the post of Chief Inspector of\r\n\r\nPostmen  has  been left vacant for  the  past  two\r\n\r\nyears.  If  the  Minister cannot  get  a  suitable\r\n\r\ncandidate  for  this post, he can get  whoever  is\r\n\r\nsuitable from another grade. Why let the  post  be\r\n\r\nvacant? The incumbent is acting all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I notice in the Estimates that\r\n\r\nthere  are  increases in Postal Clerical Assistant\r\n\r\nappointments  and  a reduction in  the  number  of\r\n\r\nPostal    Clerks,   Timescale,   in   the   Postal\r\n\r\nDepartment. I presume all Government offices  will\r\n\r\nin   future  reduce  and  eventually  abolish  the\r\n\r\nTimescale clerks. That is the reason why they have\r\n\r\nincreased  the number of Clerical Assistant  posts\r\n\r\nnow.  I  personally feel that more  Postal  Higher\r\n\r\nClerical Officer posts should be created in  order\r\n\r\nto  enhance  the future prospects of the  Clerical\r\n\r\nAssistants in the Postal Department. Personally, I\r\n\r\nobserve  that  the  recruiting of  Postal  Clerks,\r\n\r\nTimescale,  is very scarce. I think  the  Minister\r\n\r\nshould  go through this more carefully. I  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to speak again about the postal services  at\r\n\r\nthe next budget sitting!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, recently\r\n\r\nthere  has been much criticism, as the Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang has pointed out, in the papers  as  well\r\n\r\nby  persons  whom  I personally  know,  about  the\r\n\r\nslowness of our postal services. There were  cases\r\n\r\nwhere the delivery of local letters took more than\r\n\r\ntwo days. A lapse of two or even more days between\r\n\r\nposting and delivery is not uncommon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson, my namesake, talks about\r\n\r\nbuying more bicycles to make postal deliveries.  I\r\n\r\nnotice under \"Other Charges, Special Expenditure\",\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  has  asked for more  money  to  buy\r\n\r\nbicycles. I am just wondering if the Minister will\r\n\r\nconsider  buying scooters instead of  bicycles  in\r\n\r\nkeeping with the times so that there will be  more\r\n\r\nexpeditious delivery of mails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, as the Memorandum on the Estimates of\r\n\r\nRevenue  and Expenditure of Singapore points  out,\r\n\r\nthe provision has been increased by 10.3 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe   amount  asked  for  is  to  fill  98  posts,\r\n\r\ncomprising  35  Postal  Clerical  Assistants,   49\r\n\r\npostmen and 14 supernumerary posts, to accommodate\r\n\r\nreplacements   of  staff  enlisted  for   national\r\n\r\nservice. The memorandum goes on to state  that  it\r\n\r\n\"is expected that with these additional posts, the\r\n\r\naccumulated staff shortage in the Postal  Services\r\n\r\nwill  be  remedied.\"  The increase  in  the  staff\r\n\r\nrequested for this year is only in replacement  of\r\n\r\nvacant  positions. I wonder if the small  increase\r\n\r\nin  staff  requested by the Minister will  improve\r\n\r\nour postal services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also told that the turnover of postmen and\r\n\r\nother  postal employees has been very high in  the\r\n\r\npast two years or so. Is the Department taking any\r\n\r\nsteps  to  arrest  the turnover  of  postmen,  for\r\n\r\nexample, through resignations, so that we will not\r\n\r\nbe  recruiting  new  postmen  all  the  time?  New\r\n\r\npostmen  means training, familiarisation with  the\r\n\r\nwork,  etc.  This  will  not  improve  our  postal\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been announced that the Post Office\r\n\r\nSavings Bank will become a corporation soon. As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  39 officers from the Post Office  Savings\r\n\r\nBank  will  revert to the postal services  proper.\r\n\r\nWill  the  Minister confirm that all the employees\r\n\r\nwho  are  now  engaged in the Post Office  Savings\r\n\r\nBank   work  will  be  absorbed  into  the  postal\r\n\r\nservices proper when the Post Office Savings  Bank\r\n\r\nbecomes a corporation? Although the Postal  Clerks\r\n\r\nand  the  Junior Postal Clerks are recruited  into\r\n\r\nthe   Government   service  as  General   Clerical\r\n\r\nOfficers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand Clerical Assistants, once, they are posted  to\r\n\r\nthe  Post Office they virtually remain in the Post\r\n\r\nOffice  until their retirement or death. If  there\r\n\r\nare requests from the clerks in the postal offices\r\n\r\nfor  transfer  to other departments of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice,   will  the  Government  entertain   such\r\n\r\nrequests? At one time the postal services used  to\r\n\r\nbe  considered a closed service, but  recently  we\r\n\r\nhave noticed that senior civil servants from other\r\n\r\ndepartments have been transferred to senior  posts\r\n\r\nin  the Postal Department. Can the officers in the\r\n\r\nPostal  Department also similarly  be  transferred\r\n\r\nout  of the postal services into other departments\r\n\r\nif they request such transfers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Minister can reply\r\n\r\ntomorrow.
