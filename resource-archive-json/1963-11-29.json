On that  day\r\n\r\nwe achieved our independence in Malaysia. It was a\r\n\r\nmomentous  and irreversible event in our  history.\r\n\r\nBut  partly  because  so many  other  things  were\r\n\r\nhappening  at the same time, the full significance\r\n\r\nof the changes that have taken place was not fully\r\n\r\napparent. It is just as well if we were to pause a\r\n\r\nwhile  and  recount the changes  that  have  taken\r\n\r\nplace and the new power structure within Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore was in the midst of her general\r\n\r\nelections at the time. A few weeks just before the\r\n\r\n31st of August, it seemed as though Malaysia might\r\n\r\nbe   postponed  indefinitely.  Indeed  there   was\r\n\r\nuncertainty  right up to the 29th of  August  when\r\n\r\nthe  new  date,  16th  September,  was  announced,\r\n\r\nsubject, it would appear, to a favourable  finding\r\n\r\nby the U.N. Secretary-General's Assessment Report.\r\n\r\nIt  was  only  on the 14th of September  that  the\r\n\r\nfavourable assessment was reported and  the  date,\r\n\r\n16th September, became an absolute certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reunification and independence, also came\r\n\r\n\"confrontation\".  Our  first  lesson  in  national\r\n\r\nunity had to be learnt quickly. For the new nation\r\n\r\nto  survive external pressures and threats, it was\r\n\r\nimperative  that  loyalty to the new  nation  must\r\n\r\ntranscend  all  other  interests.  The  people  of\r\n\r\nSabah, Sarawak and Singapore can be proud that the\r\n\r\npast  ten  weeks  have seen  a  growing  sense  of\r\n\r\nnational  purpose uniting us all in  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nthis  in  spite  of  the immediate  discomfort  of\r\n\r\nmilitary  and economic pressure inflicted  on  the\r\n\r\nborders of Sarawak and on Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>The Short Term</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short term the elaborate constitutional\r\n\r\nframework  of  checks  and  safeguards  of   local\r\n\r\nautonomy  for Singapore can prevent  any  drop  in\r\n\r\nstandards   of  economic  prosperity,  of   public\r\n\r\nservices,   of   social   amenities,   educational\r\n\r\nfacilities and public housing, whatever happens in\r\n\r\nthe rest of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the long run we must all realise that\r\n\r\nprosperity  or  poverty  is  indivisible   between\r\n\r\nmember  states  of  a  nation,  just  as   it   is\r\n\r\nindivisible between people in a member state.  Our\r\n\r\ndestiny\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nis  irrevocably intertwined with that of the  rest\r\n\r\nof Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powers over defence, security and foreign affairs\r\n\r\nare  all  vested  in  our  Central  Government  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  On 1st September, 1962, we in Singapore\r\n\r\ndecided  to place our future together with Malaya.\r\n\r\nThe  centre of gravity of political power  is  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government  of  Malaysia.  It  is  policy\r\n\r\nsettled  by a Government which commands a majority\r\n\r\nof  the Members of Parliament in Kuala Lumpur that\r\n\r\nwill  decide our fate and the fate of the rest  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia. For instance, whether \"confrontation\" at\r\n\r\npresent  confined to a trade boycott of  Singapore\r\n\r\nand   Penang,  and  military  pressure  along  the\r\n\r\nborders  of  Sarawak is contained  and  held,  and\r\n\r\nslowly  resolved, depends upon the policy  settled\r\n\r\nby  the Central Government, not that of any member\r\n\r\nState Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>The Long Term</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An even more important reason why in the long run\r\n\r\nit  is the Government of Malaysia that will settle\r\n\r\nthe  shape  of  things to come,  is  that  overall\r\n\r\nfinancial  and  fiscal powers are  vested  in  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government. And it is the  financial  and\r\n\r\nfiscal  policies  of  a  nation  that  decide  the\r\n\r\nstructure of its society. Whether we are  to  move\r\n\r\ntowards  a  more  just and equal  society  depends\r\n\r\nprimarily  upon how to use the powers of  taxation\r\n\r\nand expenditure to bring about a redistribution of\r\n\r\nopportunity  and ultimately of wealth amongst  our\r\n\r\npeople.  Even  before merger the capacity  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government to bring about this change by\r\n\r\nfinancial and fiscal policy was conscribed by  the\r\n\r\nactual   economic   limitations   of   Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy, one so intimately linked with that of the\r\n\r\nFederation  that  any  violent  disparity  in  the\r\n\r\npolicies of the two Governments would have brought\r\n\r\nunpleasant  consequences  for  both,  though  more\r\n\r\nunpleasant  for Singapore than for the Federation.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, had the differentials in income tax\r\n\r\nrates  between  Singapore and the Federation  been\r\n\r\nvery  much greater than the five per cent  at  the\r\n\r\ntop  bracket between 55 per cent in Singapore  and\r\n\r\n50  per  cent in Malaya, there would have been  an\r\n\r\ninevitable movement of wealth and wealthy men from\r\n\r\nSingapore to the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Central Government controls the financial\r\n\r\nand fiscal policies over the whole of Malaysia, as\r\n\r\nindeed it must be if Malaysia is to make sense  as\r\n\r\na  nation.  Indeed  it  is  open  to  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment,  if it were ill-advised enough  so  to\r\n\r\ndo,  to  reverse some of the more progressive  and\r\n\r\nforward-looking policies which have  already  been\r\n\r\nembodied into our income tax and revenue laws. For\r\n\r\ninstance, we have a higher differential for income\r\n\r\ntax  of 55 per cent on incomes above $100,000  per\r\n\r\nannum,   instead  of  50  per  cent  as   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation,  and we have separate  assessment  for\r\n\r\nearned  incomes of married women; and  income  tax\r\n\r\nconcession for owner-occupied houses is limited to\r\n\r\na  maximum annual value of $3,000 instead of being\r\n\r\nwithout  limit as in Malaya, and so on.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, it means that in the long run the order  of\r\n\r\nour  society  will be determined  by  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment. So any political movement  that  seeks\r\n\r\nto  bring  changes in our society must necessarily\r\n\r\nhave pan-Malaysian support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Against the Broader Canvas</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a nation success or failure is all-embracing.\r\n\r\nSingapore's  problems   of   economic\r\n\r\nprogress  and social revolution must therefore  be\r\n\r\nseen  against  the broader canvas of Malaysia.  No\r\n\r\npolitical  movement  can be  effective  if  it  is\r\n\r\nlocalised  and  isolated either  to  Singapore  or\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur or Ipoh or to any of the other towns\r\n\r\nin  Malaysia.  If Singapore is to  make  its  full\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  the  development   of   a   more\r\n\r\nprosperous Malaysia in which wealth and prosperity\r\n\r\nare  more evenly shared amongst the people whether\r\n\r\nin  the urban or in the rural areas, regardless of\r\n\r\nrace, religion or culture, then she must play  her\r\n\r\nfull part in the Malaysian political milieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>The Next Five Years</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the immediate present, we can take\r\n\r\nsatisfaction   in   the   fact   that   the    new\r\n\r\nconstitutional   framework  has  already   ensured\r\n\r\nstability and certainty for the next five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the industrial front with the fall in\r\n\r\ninfluence  of the Communist united front  movement\r\n\r\nin  the  trade  unions, there has  been  increased\r\n\r\ndemand  for factory sites in Jurong, and  for  the\r\n\r\nsmaller\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustrial  estates  of  Tanglin  Halt,   Redhill,\r\n\r\nBendemeer and Kampong Ampat. In fact, all the  138\r\n\r\nsites  in  the  four  smaller  industrial  estates\r\n\r\ncovering 72 acres have been taken up. In Jurong 47\r\n\r\nsites  covering  an area of 380  acres  have  been\r\n\r\nallocated whilst applications for another 35 sites\r\n\r\ncovering  a  total  of  329 acres  are  now  being\r\n\r\nnegotiated. The confidence and optimism, reflected\r\n\r\nin  the  prices  of immovable properties  and  the\r\n\r\ninvestment applications for industrial  sites  for\r\n\r\nfactory buildings and machinery, are well founded,\r\n\r\nbased  as they are on the political stability  and\r\n\r\nsecurity    of    Malaysia   and   the    economic\r\n\r\npossibilities  of a common market  of  10  million\r\n\r\npeople  in  a region with the highest standard  of\r\n\r\nliving in South Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed but for Indonesia's \"confrontation\" it\r\n\r\nwould  he  fair  to  say that  within  four  years\r\n\r\nSingapore's  first phase of the Jurong  industrial\r\n\r\nsite  would have got off to a splendid start.  But\r\n\r\neven   in  spite  of  indefinite  continuance   of\r\n\r\nconfrontation,  there  is every  prospect  of  our\r\n\r\nmaking  up the eight per cent loss on our national\r\n\r\nincome caused by confrontation within two years by\r\n\r\nalternative fields of economic expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The  Changed  Position of the Singapore Government and the Singapore Assembly</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will have noticed on page 38 of the\r\n\r\nEstimates for next year's expenditure that a whole\r\n\r\nseries  of  items relating to Federal  expenditure\r\n\r\nhas  gone  over  into the Federal budget.  Certain\r\n\r\nmajor spheres of government activity have now gone\r\n\r\nover to the Central Government. In political terms\r\n\r\nit   means   that  there  will  be  more  coherent\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of all those services  which  are  in\r\n\r\ntheir   very  nature  Pan-Malaysian,  like   civil\r\n\r\naviation,   meteorological  services,   transport,\r\n\r\ntelecommunications,  posts,   judicial   services,\r\n\r\naudit,  immigration and passports, defence, police\r\n\r\nand  prisons.  This change in the power  structure\r\n\r\nmay  temporarily  give a sense  of  void  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  Some of the stirring issues which  have\r\n\r\nagitated  Singapore over the last  eighteen  years\r\n\r\nwill  no longer excite this Chamber or the island.\r\n\r\nIndependence  is  an accomplished  fact.  However,\r\n\r\nsubversive activity by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanti-national     Communist    elements     within\r\n\r\nindependent Malaysia is a continuing problem  that\r\n\r\nwill  have  to be met and faced. But the ceaseless\r\n\r\nattack  against  the police and  other  organs  of\r\n\r\nGovernment    which   checkmate   the    Communist\r\n\r\nconspiracy  will now be carried over to Parliament\r\n\r\nHouse in Kuala Lumpur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is one danger that we must\r\n\r\nconstantly bear in mind. Although Members  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  the  constitutional  obligation  to  concern\r\n\r\nourselves  in  this Chamber with Communist  united\r\n\r\nfront  activity  and the threat it  poses  to  the\r\n\r\nnational   security  of  Malaysia,   the   process\r\n\r\nnevertheless  goes relentlessly on.  It  would  be\r\n\r\nfatal  if  we  believed that with the  powers  now\r\n\r\nvested in Kuala Lumpur we in Singapore can opt out\r\n\r\nfrom this struggle. It is tempting to believe that\r\n\r\nthe  strength  of the rural base  of  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  enable all these problems  to  be\r\n\r\nresolved   by  straightforward  security  actions,\r\n\r\neither by disruption of the Communist united front\r\n\r\norganisations  or  by  neutralisation   of   their\r\n\r\nprincipal  activists. But the  long-term  solution\r\n\r\ndoes   not   lie  merely  in  negating  the   open\r\n\r\nmanifestations   of   Communist    strength    and\r\n\r\norganisation. The only conclusive solution  is  to\r\n\r\nwin  the constant battle for hearts and minds -  a\r\n\r\nbattle   that  can  only  he  won  by  intelligent\r\n\r\npolitical, economic and social policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To close our eyes to the real problem, the\r\n\r\neconomic and social injustices of our society, and\r\n\r\nthe challenge which Communist doctrines exploiting\r\n\r\nthese  injustices can mount, is to run the  danger\r\n\r\nof losing the battle by default. The problems that\r\n\r\nhave  beset  us  for  the last  decade  and  given\r\n\r\nSingapore  its  reputation as a  highly  volatile,\r\n\r\nriotous city, they all remain. Independence,  with\r\n\r\nmerger and Malaysia, have removed a number of  the\r\n\r\nbasic  causes of discontent. But the other  latent\r\n\r\nsocial  causes  of discontent and  dissatisfaction\r\n\r\nremain.  They  must be resolved.  Poverty  in  the\r\n\r\nmidst  of  plenty, unemployment  in  the  face  of\r\n\r\naffluence,  the rising expectations  of  a  better\r\n\r\nlife which universal education has aroused amongst\r\n\r\nour  younger  people,  these  are  problems  which\r\n\r\nrequire  our  constant effort before  things  will\r\n\r\nimprove  permanently. To close our eyes  to  these\r\n\r\nbasic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblems  and  to leave the Central Government  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  the open manifestations of  discontent\r\n\r\nwhich Communist activists exploit would be to lose\r\n\r\nthe long-term battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If democratic values of a tolerant society are to\r\n\r\nsurvive  in  Malaysia, then we in  Singapore  must\r\n\r\ncontinue to play our part to counter the Communist\r\n\r\nchallenge by meeting them in the open argument and\r\n\r\neven  more  so by enlightened social and  economic\r\n\r\npolicies.  For  it  is these policies  which  will\r\n\r\nestablish   in  every  one's  mind   the   growing\r\n\r\nconviction that a more just and equal society  can\r\n\r\nbe  achieved by a democratic State, provided  that\r\n\r\nthe  people have an understanding of the practical\r\n\r\nalternatives open to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>THE NEXT STAGE OF THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION IN                      SINGAPORE</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Education</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the power of fixing the level of taxation\r\n\r\nhas  shifted  to Kuala Lumpur, the tax  collection\r\n\r\nremains  with Singapore. So also the bulk  of  the\r\n\r\npower   of  expenditure  remains  with  Singapore.\r\n\r\nMembers   will  have  noticed  that  next   year's\r\n\r\nestimates  of expenditure, despite the absence  of\r\n\r\nall  Federal items from it, still show  a  sum  of\r\n\r\nnearly $350 million or about three-quarters of the\r\n\r\ntotal revenue to be raised in Singapore. How  this\r\n\r\nrevenue is spent, is within the competence of this\r\n\r\nAssembly   and   the   Government.   Within    the\r\n\r\nlimitations of this revenue we can bring about the\r\n\r\nnext stage of the social revolution in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can decide for ourselves the details of how\r\n\r\nthis money is to be spent and how the benefits  of\r\n\r\nthis  expenditure  are to be spread  more  equally\r\n\r\namongst  our  people. Two big items overwhelm  all\r\n\r\nothers. Education amounts to about a third of  the\r\n\r\nbudget, and health amounts to nearly a fourth.  It\r\n\r\nis as it should be, in that order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No single factor is more likely to bring about a\r\n\r\nmore    fair   and   just   society   than   equal\r\n\r\nopportunities for education for all. The ideal  to\r\n\r\nwhich  all  nations  in the world  aspire  is  the\r\n\r\nutilisation  of  all its human  resources  to  its\r\n\r\nmaximum.  Free  education  from  kindergarten   to\r\n\r\nuniversity is the ideal that will help bring this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout.  We  have achieved free universal education\r\n\r\nfor   six   years   in  primary  schools.   Before\r\n\r\n\"confrontation\" began, it had looked  possible  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  free  secondary  education  within  two\r\n\r\nyears.  In  fact, it was the hope of my Government\r\n\r\nto  introduce free secondary education  for  1964.\r\n\r\nBut  with  the loss of 8 per cent of our  national\r\n\r\nincome  as a result of the stoppage of trade  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia, we will have to postpone it to a  later\r\n\r\ndate, probably 1966.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the meantime, the number of bursaries and\r\n\r\nscholarships  for  secondary  education  will   be\r\n\r\nincreased  four-fold to assist bright children  of\r\n\r\npoor   families   to  finish  secondary   schools.\r\n\r\nScholarships  and  bursaries for higher  education\r\n\r\nabroad,   and  in  the  University  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nNanyang  University, the Polytechnic and Ngee  Ann\r\n\r\nCollege will also be increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's policy to give equal\r\n\r\ntreatment  for the four language streams.  Parents\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  have  a  free  choice  of  the\r\n\r\nlanguage in which they wish their children  to  be\r\n\r\neducated. It is the intention of the Government to\r\n\r\nimprove  the standard of teaching of a second  and\r\n\r\neven third language in all schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teaching of Malay in all schools will be\r\n\r\nintensified. The quality of teaching of Chinese in\r\n\r\nEnglish medium schools, as well as the quality  of\r\n\r\nteaching  of English in Chinese and Malay  schools\r\n\r\nwill be raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The integration of schools using different\r\n\r\nlanguage  media of instruction introduced  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in the last few years will be continued\r\n\r\nand, indeed, brought one stage further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward planning for teacher training and school\r\n\r\nbuildings  is  ahead or keeping pace  with  actual\r\n\r\nneeds.  Twenty-six new schools, 10 primary and  16\r\n\r\nsecondary, are being built and 18 will  be  opened\r\n\r\nduring  1964. Extensions to the Teachers' Training\r\n\r\nCollege are also being made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absence of adequate provision to meet the\r\n\r\neducational and recreational requirements  of  the\r\n\r\nrural  population has been exploited by  the  pro-Communist  organisations  to  spread  their  anti-national propaganda under cover of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"educational  activities\".  The  Government   will\r\n\r\ntherefore  expand  the  programme  of  the   Adult\r\n\r\nEducation movement to meet these requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems which beset Chinese education\r\n\r\nis   the   use  the  Communists  make  of  Chinese\r\n\r\neducational   issues  as   a   cover   for   their\r\n\r\npenetration  of schools amongst some students  and\r\n\r\neven  teachers.  They have in the  past  caused  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  of  agitation and unrest  in  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools,  including  the  examination  boycott  in\r\n\r\nNovember 1961. From the middle schools a hard-core\r\n\r\ngroup   of   Communist   student   elements   have\r\n\r\npenetrated Nanyang University. As in the  case  of\r\n\r\nChinese   Middle   schools  in  1955   and   1956,\r\n\r\ndiscipline  is  not now under the control  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity   teaching  staff.  Student  committees\r\n\r\nworking    in    conjunction    with    graduates,\r\n\r\nadministration staff in the University  and  Board\r\n\r\nof  Students  Welfare are in de  facto  charge  of\r\n\r\ndiscipline,  a  position from which this  militant\r\n\r\nCommunist  minority eliminate all  student  groups\r\n\r\nwho do not accept their leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential that there should be confidence\r\n\r\nand  good faith between the Central Government and\r\n\r\nthe  State  Government  in  the  handling  of  the\r\n\r\nsecurity  problem in all educational institutions,\r\n\r\nincluding  the incipient problem in the University\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is when the Central Government does not doubt\r\n\r\nthat the Singapore Government has no intention  of\r\n\r\nhindering  the Central Government from discharging\r\n\r\nits  paramount duty of ensuring that no  Communist\r\n\r\nactivity  is  subverting the nation in educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions that we can exercise our autonomy  in\r\n\r\neducation to the best advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Health</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next to education, the largest expenditure is on\r\n\r\nhealth.  Nowhere in South Asia are there  clinical\r\n\r\nand  hospital care for the sick of such dimensions\r\n\r\nand   standards.  Thirty-two  Government   clinics\r\n\r\nhandling between over 3.5 million attendances  for\r\n\r\nthis year and eleven existing Government hospitals\r\n\r\nwith  6,800  beds for a population of 1.8  million\r\n\r\nhave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nput a great strain on the medical services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shortage in doctors is being slowly overcome,\r\n\r\nbut the extension of Government clinics and health\r\n\r\nfacilities  has  been at a higher  rate  than  the\r\n\r\nrecruitment   of   new   doctors.   Administrative\r\n\r\nefficiency  and  tightening  of  \"referrals\"  from\r\n\r\nthese  clinics to the hospitals are  essential  if\r\n\r\nthe strain on the medical staff is to be checked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is still necessary to have one other\r\n\r\ngeneral  hospital. The Thomson Road Hospital  will\r\n\r\nbecome the second general hospital next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School dental clinics now a part of new school\r\n\r\nbuildings provide an ever increasing and  valuable\r\n\r\nservice  to  school  children under  the  care  of\r\n\r\ndental nurses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans are being finalised to provide family\r\n\r\nplanning   information  and  facilities   at   all\r\n\r\nmaternity and child welfare clinics in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Public Health side, the Ministry is\r\n\r\nplanning  a  reorganisation of the City  Cleansing\r\n\r\nservices.   A   gradual   rundown   of   transport\r\n\r\nequipment,  expansion of urban and  housing  areas\r\n\r\nand  the corresponding huge increase in the number\r\n\r\nof  hawkers,  inadequate  methods  of  supervision\r\n\r\nresulting in lack of discipline in the work force,\r\n\r\ncomplicated  by secret society elements  in  their\r\n\r\nmidst,  have brought about an increase in rubbish,\r\n\r\nflies and mosquitoes. All this can and will be put\r\n\r\nright.  Reorganisation  can  succeed  once   these\r\n\r\nfactors have been dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Housing</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third largest item of expenditure from public\r\n\r\nfunds  will be on housing. By the end of 1964  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board will have  achieved\r\n\r\nthe  target of 52,000 units within four  years  of\r\n\r\nits  commencing operations. Public housing at  the\r\n\r\nrate  of 12,000 units per annum or 45 minutes  per\r\n\r\nunit will continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year will see the beginning of the re-building of the old city of Singapore. A team of\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations  experts have given  their  report\r\n\r\nwhich  is  now under close study and consideration\r\n\r\nfor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimplementation.  An Urban Redevelopment  Authority\r\n\r\nwill  be set up to control and co-ordinate  public\r\n\r\nand private development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the demolition of Outram Prison is\r\n\r\nproceeding to provide the first decanting area  as\r\n\r\nurban renewal commences in the eastern and western\r\n\r\nsectors of the central city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One difficulty is that World Bank loans are not\r\n\r\navailable  for  expenditure on housing  and  urban\r\n\r\nrenewal,  and so all loans will have to be  raised\r\n\r\ninternally  within  Singapore or  externally  from\r\n\r\ncommercial sources and in part financed  from  our\r\n\r\naccumulated surplus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the shortage of land, there are land\r\n\r\nreclamation schemes. At Bedok, about 40 odd  acres\r\n\r\nhave  already been reclaimed. The reclamation belt\r\n\r\nwill  eventually stretch a half mile into the  sea\r\n\r\nfrom Bedok along the coast to Nicoll Highway. This\r\n\r\ntogether  with  some  200  acres  of  land  to  be\r\n\r\nreclaimed  in  Kallang Basin will  provide  enough\r\n\r\nland  for both public and private building  within\r\n\r\nthe  next  five  years. The  Toa  Payoh  new  town\r\n\r\nproject  where 200,000 people will  be  housed  in\r\n\r\nsome 40,000 units will be well advanced by the end\r\n\r\nof  the  five  years. As the  land  value  in  the\r\n\r\ncentral part of the city is very much higher  than\r\n\r\nthat in Queenstown or Aljunied, it is not possible\r\n\r\nto  let  out  flats  at that  rate.  For  example,\r\n\r\nSelegie  House, where the land value  is  $10  per\r\n\r\nsquare foot as against 50 cents per square foot at\r\n\r\nQueenstown, flats have to be let out at  the  rate\r\n\r\nof  $30  for  a one-room unit, $60 for a  two-room\r\n\r\nunit,  and  $90 for a three-room unit.  A  similar\r\n\r\nproblem will arise with reference to houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coming year, the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard  will be working out plans for the  sale  of\r\n\r\nlow-cost  housing flats on instalment plan.  After\r\n\r\nan  initial  down payment, rents would  cover  the\r\n\r\npurchase  of  the  flats over a  period  of  10-15\r\n\r\nyears. All in all, it is expected that some  $300-400  million will go into public housing over  the\r\n\r\nnext five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Public Utilities</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the massive housing programme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   progress  in  industrialisation,  electrical\r\n\r\nconsumption  increased throughout 1963.

One of the biggest\r\n\r\ncontributing factors to instability\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the past decade has been the absence of such  a\r\n\r\nmovement. Unintelligent labour policies  aimed  at\r\n\r\nkeeping  the  working population docile  had  only\r\n\r\nopened  the  road  for  militant  action  led   or\r\n\r\ninspired  by  Communists  exploiting  the  genuine\r\n\r\ngrievances of workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last four years saw the beginning of a\r\n\r\ncoherent  policy of industrial peace with justice.\r\n\r\nBoth  employers and workers were educated  on  the\r\n\r\nneed for mutual accommodation for mutual survival.\r\n\r\nLarge  fields of industrial discontent and  unrest\r\n\r\nhad been wiped out by wage agreements, legislation\r\n\r\nand  arbitration  in  the  Industrial  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of industrial peace with justice is\r\n\r\nfundamental  if we are to succeed  in  our  plans.\r\n\r\nWithout industrial peace there will be no economic\r\n\r\nexpansion,  leaving  everybody  worse   off.   And\r\n\r\nwithout justice and fair play to the workers whose\r\n\r\nefforts  help  employers to make profit  on  their\r\n\r\ncapital,  there  can  he no  long-term  industrial\r\n\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time in the history of the labour\r\n\r\nmovement,  the  workers have  become  educated  on\r\n\r\ntheir   rights   and,  equally  important,   their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities. Irresponsible strike action, and\r\n\r\nworse,   strike  action  for  political  purposes,\r\n\r\nworkers  have found to their cost to  he  damaging\r\n\r\nnot  only  to  employers hut also  to  themselves.\r\n\r\nCommunist  influence has temporarily  receded.  On\r\n\r\nthe other hand, for the first time in Singapore, a\r\n\r\nvigorous non-Communist leadership is emerging from\r\n\r\nthe  unions  as  militant and  as  active  as  the\r\n\r\nCommunists, but not using and exploiting the trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement  for direct political  objectives.\r\n\r\nEmployers have also come to realise the wisdom of\r\n\r\na  fair wage policy to ensure stability. The stage\r\n\r\nis now set where with an intelligent policy on the\r\n\r\npart  of  employers it is possible to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe non-Communist trade union movement strengthens\r\n\r\nas  the Communists are isolated and prevented from\r\n\r\nre-establishing  influence and  control  over  the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all this, the Industrial Arbitration Court has\r\n\r\nplayed,  and  will Continue to play, an  important\r\n\r\nrole in holding the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscales  between competing demands of  capital  out\r\n\r\nfor  maximum  profit and workers out  for  maximum\r\n\r\nwages  and  fringe benefits. The next  five  years\r\n\r\nwill  be a period of consolidation. A Trade  Union\r\n\r\nBill  to improve the laws regulating trade  unions\r\n\r\nwill  be introduced. There will be no more omnibus\r\n\r\nunions  of  the Shop and Factory Workers  type  in\r\n\r\nwhich  a  few Communist activists could manipulate\r\n\r\nthousands  of  workers  ranging  from  clerks  and\r\n\r\nsalesgirls to bus drivers and motor mechanics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two important factors in preventing trade unions\r\n\r\nfrom   being  exploited  by  Communist  and  other\r\n\r\nsubversive   elements  are,  first,  a  widespread\r\n\r\nliteracy  among workers, and second, education  of\r\n\r\ntrade  union  leaders in trade union organisation,\r\n\r\nadministration,    collective    bargaining    and\r\n\r\ndemocratic  leadership.  As  to  the  first,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will be arranging through the  National\r\n\r\nTrade  Unions  Congress and  the  Adult  Education\r\n\r\nBoard  comprehensive workers' education programmes\r\n\r\nin  the  four language streams. As to the  second,\r\n\r\nthe   Government  has  sought  and  obtained   the\r\n\r\nassistance    of    the    International    Labour\r\n\r\nOrganisation  to expand the research and  training\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  trade unionists  offered  by  the\r\n\r\nLabour Research Unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is most important is for both workers, trade\r\n\r\nunion leaders and employers to realise their joint\r\n\r\nresponsibility  with  the  Government  to   ensure\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economic growth without  which  there\r\n\r\ncan  be  no  social progress. Whatever  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion practices and precedents in established  and\r\n\r\ndeveloped countries, a developing country requires\r\n\r\na  forward-looking approach both by employers  and\r\n\r\norganised workers. Restrictive practices on either\r\n\r\nside must not be allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government proposes to set up a Labour\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Council  consisting of  Labour  Ministry\r\n\r\nofficials, management representatives and  trade\r\n\r\nunion representatives to advise the Government  on\r\n\r\nall   matters  relating  to  improved   industrial\r\n\r\nrelations, employees' welfare,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  industrial  training  related  to  industrial\r\n\r\neconomic matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Marine and Port Development</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore for the fourth year in succession has\r\n\r\nmaintained its position as the fifth largest  port\r\n\r\nin   the   world,  the  second  largest   in   the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth and the busiest one in the Far East.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Harbour Board has plans to provide\r\n\r\nanother four deep-water berths at the East Lagoon,\r\n\r\nincluding  ancillary buildings and  equipment  and\r\n\r\nalso  to  develop the Telok Ayer  Basin  with  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  a finger pier for coastal  vessels.\r\n\r\nBoth  these  projects are estimated  to  cost  $50\r\n\r\nmillion. With the introduction of a Common  Market\r\n\r\nin Malaysia, it is envisaged that in future multi-storeyed warehouses at the West Wharf and the East\r\n\r\nLagoon  will  have to be constructed in  order  to\r\n\r\nprovide greater warehousing facilities. The  Board\r\n\r\nhas  already approved a $10 million housing scheme\r\n\r\nfor  its employees. Work has begun on this project\r\n\r\nand  when  it is completed within the next  twelve\r\n\r\nmonths,  the Board would have housed approximately\r\n\r\n60 per cent of its 10,000 employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harbour at Jurong is well under way. The\r\n\r\nwhole  project is expected to be completed by  the\r\n\r\nend  of 1964.

A  more  equal\r\n\r\ndistribution  of  the  benefits  of  our   society\r\n\r\nwithout increasing the sum total to be shared will\r\n\r\nnot  make  us a developed society. Only  sustained\r\n\r\neconomic growth can make this possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not often understood in newly independent\r\n\r\ncountries that none of the good things in life are\r\n\r\nfree,  that  whilst some members of the  community\r\n\r\nmay  get  some  things free, the community  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole  must  pay for every single item  given  out\r\n\r\nfree or subsidised. It is all too easy in a system\r\n\r\nof  one  man one vote to promise the sun, and  the\r\n\r\nmoon, and the stars, and election time becomes  an\r\n\r\nauction  time  in which political Parties  try  to\r\n\r\noutbid  one  another in giving away  the  national\r\n\r\ninheritance free of charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has reason to be grateful to the\r\n\r\nmajority  of its population for being sufficiently\r\n\r\nrealistic and practical to understand the economic\r\n\r\nimplications of specious promises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success in building a prosperous, affluent\r\n\r\nand  equal  society depends on economic growth  to\r\n\r\npay  for the services we want and their expansion.\r\n\r\nIt   means  we  must  succeed  in  our  plans  for\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.  Jurong must  succeed  together\r\n\r\nwith  all the minor industrial estates in Redhill,\r\n\r\nTanglin Halt, Bendemeer, Kampong Ampat, and  along\r\n\r\nBukit  Timah Road. We have the basis for  success:\r\n\r\nconfidence  locally and abroad  in  our  political\r\n\r\nstability  and  security, a common market  of  ten\r\n\r\nmillion  and  an able and industrious people.

To  be  stable  the\r\n\r\nterms  must  be fair. In case of disagreement  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must hold the balance to  ensure  that\r\n\r\ninvestors  are  not broken by irresponsible  trade\r\n\r\nunionism, nor workers exploited and not paid their\r\n\r\njust due because of weak trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main objectives of economic and social\r\n\r\npolicies were all mapped out four and a half years\r\n\r\nago when the present Government first took office.\r\n\r\nThe  problems are the same - to create  more  equal\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  all  and  ensure  rewards   to\r\n\r\neveryone   according  to  their  contribution   to\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have learnt from the experiences of the last\r\n\r\nfour years. The next few years will be a period of\r\n\r\nconsolidation   where   the   benefit   of   these\r\n\r\nexperiences   can   help   bring   about   tighter\r\n\r\norganisation and more efficient administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the setback in the trading sector\r\n\r\nbecause  of  Indonesia's  trade  boycott  we  have\r\n\r\nsufficient reserves accumulated over the last four\r\n\r\nyears to see us through to industrial success  and\r\n\r\nprosperity.   But   there   must   be   stability,\r\n\r\ndiscipline and combined effort to ensure  a  rapid\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's intention to bring forward\r\n\r\na  number  of  construction projects and  increase\r\n\r\nexpenditure  generally in  the  public  sector  on\r\n\r\nconstruction  and  road  works  and  other  labour\r\n\r\nintensive projects in order to increase employment\r\n\r\nto  make  up  for  the drop caused  by  the  trade\r\n\r\nboycott.  These  works, particularly  those  where\r\n\r\nexpenditure is proportionately more on labour than\r\n\r\nmaterials, can to some extent make up for the loss\r\n\r\nof  8.7 per cent of our national income and lessen\r\n\r\nthe  multiplyer  effects  of  this  drop  in  our\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back of the problem of inadequate schools and\r\n\r\nteachers,  of  the shortage of homes,  houses  and\r\n\r\nflats,  has  been broken.

Whereas four years ago the emphasis  was\r\n\r\non  one-room flats, now those on the waiting  list\r\n\r\nare  for  two-  and three-room flats  and  getting\r\n\r\ntheir  share.  Part  of the disbursements  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  over  the next few years  will  be  to\r\n\r\nbeautify  the  city - more parks and gardens,  more\r\n\r\ntrees,  even public fountains, to add a little  to\r\n\r\nthe  gracefulness of life in this one of the great\r\n\r\ncities of Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year in April when the car parking garage at\r\n\r\nCecil  Street/Market  Street  is  completed,   the\r\n\r\ntarmac on Raffles Square will be broken up to make\r\n\r\nway  for trees and flowers and fountains.
