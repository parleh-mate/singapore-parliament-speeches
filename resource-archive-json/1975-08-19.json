The Bill now before the House\r\n\r\nseeks  to  amend  this section  so  as  to  enable  an\r\n\r\ninspector to inform the Minister of any matters coming\r\n\r\nto  his  knowledge  as a result of  the  investigation\r\n\r\ntending  to  show that an offence has been  committed.\r\n\r\nThe Minister may then take such steps as he deems fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the law as it now stands, an inspector may only\r\n\r\ndisclose  such  information to the  Minister  when  he\r\n\r\nmakes  his report. The law in Singapore is in  exactly\r\n\r\nthe  same  state as it was in England prior  to  1967.\r\n\r\nWhen  a  revised Companies Act was introduced  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom in 1967, the corresponding section  of\r\n\r\nthe  English Act was amended so that now an  inspector\r\n\r\nmay,  without  the  necessity  of  making  an  interim\r\n\r\nreport, inform the Department of Trade (which  is  the\r\n\r\nappointing  authority for inspectors  in  the  UK)  of\r\n\r\nmatters disclosing the probability that an offence has\r\n\r\nbeen committed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with a view to achieving the same result in our\r\n\r\nlaws that the proposed amendment to section 196 of our\r\n\r\nCompanies Act is now before the House.

Any property sold by the PSA will\r\n\r\nbe  subject to restrictive conditions prohibiting  the\r\n\r\ndealings  in  such property without the permission  of\r\n\r\nthe   PSA   and   to  special  rules   governing   the\r\n\r\ntransmission  of  the property on  the  death  of  the\r\n\r\nowners. For example, no property sold by the PSA shall\r\n\r\nbe  sold,  leased, mortgaged, transferred  or  charged\r\n\r\nwithout  the  written consent of the  PSA.  This  will\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the  PSA's  interest and  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nliving accommodation is not transferred to undesirable\r\n\r\npersons  or  disposed of to make  quick  profits.

One  of  these  is  the\r\n\r\nadministration of all mosques in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress in Singapore involves change. The\r\n\r\nnumerous   development  schemes  such  as   public\r\n\r\nhousing, road\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment, etc, require the best possible use of\r\n\r\nland.  Wherever  possible, alternative  sites  for\r\n\r\nreligious   buildings  are  provided  within   the\r\n\r\nframework  of  a  rational utilisation  of  scarce\r\n\r\nland.  This applies to all religions in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  process of urban renewal has resulted in  the\r\n\r\nmoving of population from one area to another  and\r\n\r\nthe concentration of people in satellite towns. In\r\n\r\nrecognition of the religious needs of the  Muslims\r\n\r\nwho   have  been  resettled,  the  Government  has\r\n\r\nprovided  the  Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura  sites\r\n\r\nfor  mosques at the satellite towns of Jurong, Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  and  Queenstown. Mosque sites at  Woodlands\r\n\r\nand  Chai  Chee  are also made  available  to  the\r\n\r\nMajlis. At Chua Chu Kang, a new mosque has already\r\n\r\nbeen  built by the Government at the site  of  the\r\n\r\nnew cemetery. At Geylang Serai, two mosques had to\r\n\r\nbe  demolished as a result of a new road  project,\r\n\r\nbut  both  were  re-built nearby  at  Government's\r\n\r\nexpense. The re-built mosques at Jalan Rebong  and\r\n\r\nLorong Ungku Aman are bigger and are provided with\r\n\r\nbetter modern facilities. Moreover, the Government\r\n\r\nhas  already  publicly announced in November  1973\r\n\r\nthat  its  policy in the process of urban  renewal\r\n\r\nand development is to reserve adequate sites for a\r\n\r\ntemple, a mosque, and a church in each of the  new\r\n\r\ntowns  or concentrations of population into  which\r\n\r\npeople  are moving. Depending on the size  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  in  each  of  these  housing   estates,\r\n\r\nadequate  space will be reserved for each religion\r\n\r\nin every new town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslims in Singapore have experienced\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in  raising  funds  for  the  mosque\r\n\r\nbuilding programmes. To-date, not a single  mosque\r\n\r\nhas  been erected at the sites in satellite  towns\r\n\r\nprovided  by  the Government, despite the  efforts\r\n\r\nmade   by  Muslim  groups  in  various  parts   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to raise funds for the construction  of\r\n\r\nmosques. The difficulty and the slow pace in fund-raising are compounded by the escalation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  building costs.

In\r\n\r\nthe  course of the next three to eight years,  four\r\n\r\nnew  mosques,  each  varying  between  $500,000  to\r\n\r\n$800,000  in  costs, will be built  in  Toa  Payoh,\r\n\r\nQueenstown,   Jurong  and  Woodlands.

The\r\n\r\nMUIS will appoint their own agents to collect\r\n\r\ncontributions from Muslims who are employers or\r\n\r\nare self-employed, since these people do not have\r\n\r\nCPF accounts. For this purpose, Ketua Amils and\r\n\r\nAmils will also be appointed during each fasting\r\n\r\nmonth.

He  is\r\n\r\nempowered  to recover such contributions  from  the\r\n\r\nwages of his Muslim employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Realising that there may be Muslims who are\r\n\r\nfinancially  unable  to  afford  to  contribute,   the\r\n\r\nscheme  has  been  designed  as  a  voluntary  scheme.\r\n\r\nSince  contribution  to the Mosque  Building  Fund  is\r\n\r\nvoluntary,  a  Muslim employee who does not  wish  his\r\n\r\nemployer  to  contribute to the Mosque  Building  Fund\r\n\r\non his behalf can exercise an option not to contribute\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder the Act. A Muslim employee who does  not\r\n\r\nwish   to   contribute  could,  therefore,   file   an\r\n\r\napplication  for  a  Certificate of  Option  with  the\r\n\r\nMajlis  Ugama Islam which is responsible  for  issuing\r\n\r\nCertificates  of Option which are valid for  a  period\r\n\r\nnot exceeding 12 months. Whilst the Certificate is  in\r\n\r\nforce, his employer need not pay contributions on  his\r\n\r\nbehalf. However, on the expiry of the period for which\r\n\r\nthe  option is in force, the employer shall be  liable\r\n\r\nto  pay  the  contributions unless the employee  again\r\n\r\nexercises an option to absolve him from this liability\r\n\r\nfor a further period of time not exceeding 12 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as there may be Muslims who are financially\r\n\r\nunable  to contribute, there may be those who wish  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  more  than the minimum  amount.  For  this\r\n\r\npurpose,   the   Bill   also   makes   provision   for\r\n\r\ncontributions in excess of the minimum  amount  of  50\r\n\r\ncents  per  month  to  the Mosque  Building  Fund.  An\r\n\r\nemployee  who wishes to contribute more than 50  cents\r\n\r\nper  month  can  notify his employer by  submitting  a\r\n\r\nNotification  Form stating the desired  amount  for  a\r\n\r\nperiod of six months.

Prior   to   these\r\n\r\nannouncements,  complaints  and  grievances  could  be\r\n\r\nheard from many Muslims in Singapore, and their target\r\n\r\nwas the Muslim Religious Council of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Muslims in Singapore accepted, in\r\n\r\nprinciple,  the  demolition of old  mosques  on  those\r\n\r\nsites   which   are  affected  by  urban  development,\r\n\r\nnevertheless  their  feeling  of  suspicion  could  be\r\n\r\ndiscerned   because   those   mosques   affected    by\r\n\r\ndevelopment  have already been demolished  whilst  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  new ones has yet to commence.  With  the\r\n\r\nspiralling costs of building materials consequent upon\r\n\r\ninflation,  it  is even more difficult  to  build  the\r\n\r\nmosques  which  are  being  planned  because  of   the\r\n\r\nshortage  of  funds. It would seem that these  mosques\r\n\r\nwill  never be built so long as building costs do  not\r\n\r\nreturn to normal levels as in 1972 and 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this Bill, however, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Muslims\r\n\r\nnow  feel  that  the Government is really  sincere  in\r\n\r\nwanting to assist and cooperate with them towards  the\r\n\r\nprogress of Muslims in Singapore, so that they can  be\r\n\r\nput, on the same level as the other communities,  not\r\n\r\nby  providing a subsidy but by practical  means,  like\r\n\r\ngiving them facilities to collect and raise funds from\r\n\r\nthe  Muslims themselves. The Muslims in Singapore also\r\n\r\nrealise that although they are left far\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbehind in all fields of endeavour, they do not want to\r\n\r\ndepend solely on assistance from the Government.  They\r\n\r\ndo  not  want to be a social burden to the  Government\r\n\r\nand to the other communities in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been informed that, since the commencement of\r\n\r\nthe  deductions in May, 1975, the net amount  received\r\n\r\nby  the  Muslim Religious Council of Singapore through\r\n\r\nthe CPF was $51,000 and in the subsequent month it was\r\n\r\n$53,000. From the total number of Muslims in Singapore\r\n\r\nonly 40 do not wish to have their pay deducted for the\r\n\r\npurpose. This means that the number of such people  is\r\n\r\nnegligible. I believe that this Bill will produce  the\r\n\r\ndesired benefits for the Muslims in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say something on the new\r\n\r\nsection  75B  in clause 3 regarding the provision  for\r\n\r\nthe payment of any costs of administering this Fund? I\r\n\r\nbelieve   this   Fund   will  be  maintained   through\r\n\r\ncomputerised  collections by the CPF. I  also  believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  cost  of administering this  Fund  and  the\r\n\r\nsalaries  of  those who administer this Fund  will  be\r\n\r\npaid  out of the contributions. May I suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  in  charge that similarly  contributions  to\r\n\r\nthis  Fund be used to pay the Imams and the caretakers\r\n\r\nof the mosques built out of this Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the new section 7SF, which empowers\r\n\r\nthe Majlis to make rules, I would ask the Minister  to\r\n\r\ngive careful attention to this power. I would like  to\r\n\r\ndraw  the attention of the Minister to the power given\r\n\r\nto the Majlis Ugama Is/am to award scholarships met by\r\n\r\nthe  collection of tithes. From my experience  I  have\r\n\r\ndiscovered  that  some Muslims in Singapore  who  have\r\n\r\ngone abroad to further their studies and are no longer\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens still continue  to  receive  these\r\n\r\nscholarships.  Furthermore students who  are  studying\r\n\r\nabroad and who have since married foreigners in  their\r\n\r\nplaces   of   study   are   still   receiving    these\r\n\r\nscholarships. I think this is most\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninappropriate. Again, recipients of these scholarships\r\n\r\nhave  been  known  to drive in Opel  1700s  to  attend\r\n\r\nclasses  whilst  applicants for such scholarships  who\r\n\r\nare genuinely in need of financial assistance, as they\r\n\r\nare fatherless and depend solely on their brothers who\r\n\r\nthemselves   have  their  own  responsibilities,   are\r\n\r\ndeprived of these scholarships. I hope the Minister in\r\n\r\ncharge  will  give serious attention  to  this  matter\r\n\r\nconcerning  the power to make rules to pay  out  money\r\n\r\nfrom  contributions  by  Muslims  towards  the  Mosque\r\n\r\nBuilding Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just like to point out to\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Kampung Kembangan that this  Fund  is\r\n\r\nestablished for the purpose of building mosques in the\r\n\r\nnew  towns  only, and not as he has stated  just  now,\r\n\r\ni.e, whenever a mosque is pulled down  a  new  mosque\r\n\r\nwill  be built on the site. The Fund is not meant  for\r\n\r\nthat  purpose.  It is specifically  set  up  to  build\r\n\r\nmosques  in  the new towns which I have  named  in  my\r\n\r\nSecond Reading speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his point about utilising monies in the Mosque\r\n\r\nBuilding  Fund under the new section 75B, in clause  3\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill, I wish to reiterate that  the  Fund  is\r\n\r\nestablished for a specific purpose only, that  is,  it\r\n\r\nshall be used for:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(a)the purpose of building any mosque in Singapore;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)the payment of any costs, charges and expenses of\r\n\r\nmaintaining  and administering the Mosque  Building Fund.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I am afraid the monies cannot be used\r\n\r\nfor any other purpose than what is stated in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his third point about the powers given to the\r\n\r\nMUIS,  I can assure him, Sir, that I will keep an  eye\r\n\r\non whatever the MUIS is doing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Encik Othman Bin Wok].\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LAND TITLES (STRATA) (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.17 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the Bill appears to introduce a large\r\n\r\nnumber of amendments to the Act, the bulk of them  are\r\n\r\nmerely consequential amendments, and I shall deal with\r\n\r\nonly the main ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Titles (Strata) Act, enacted in 1968,\r\n\r\nenables  purchasers of flats for which  strata  titles\r\n\r\nhave  been issued to manage and maintain the  building\r\n\r\ncontaining  the flats and its related common  property\r\n\r\nsuch  as  common  corridors,  staircases,  garden  and\r\n\r\nlifts.  However,  in  recent  years  there  have  been\r\n\r\nattempts   made  by  the  developer  of  a  subdivided\r\n\r\nbuilding  to  control the management of  the  building\r\n\r\nafter the issue of the certificates of strata title by\r\n\r\nissuing  leases  of the flats to the  purchasers  with\r\n\r\nterms  entrenched  in  the leases  in  favour  of  the\r\n\r\ndeveloper. To ensure that these purchasers,  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  granted a leasehold interest of a  term  of  not\r\n\r\nless  than  21  years,  should  have  a  say  in   the\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  maintenance of  the  common  property\r\n\r\npertaining to the subdivided building, it is necessary\r\n\r\nto  amend the Act to allow such purchasers to exercise\r\n\r\nfully  the rights of management conferred upon  Strata\r\n\r\ntitle  owners  as if the leases were not created.  The\r\n\r\nBill before this House seeks, inter alia, to do this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for the issue of strata titles for\r\n\r\ncondominium  developments. Perhaps  I  should  explain\r\n\r\nbriefly  what a condominium development is. A  housing\r\n\r\nestate   which   is   classified  as   a   condominium\r\n\r\ndevelopment  will  have  the  usual  bungalows,  semi-detached  houses, terrace houses and,  perhaps  flats.\r\n\r\nThe estate looks no different from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nusual   housing  estate.  However,  in  a  condominium\r\n\r\ndevelopment, the developer will be required to provide\r\n\r\nrecreational facilities for all the residents  in  the\r\n\r\nestate. As soon as the strata title plan of the estate\r\n\r\nhas  been registered with the Registrar of Titles  the\r\n\r\nowners of the housing or flat units in the estate will\r\n\r\nconstitute  the management corporation of the  estate.\r\n\r\nThe  management  corporation will then be  responsible\r\n\r\nfor the maintenance of all the recreational facilities\r\n\r\nand the common property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interest which an owner of a housing unit in such\r\n\r\nan  estate acquires is contained in a strata title. He\r\n\r\nowns what is within the confines of his bungalow, semi-detached house, terrace house or flat as the case  may\r\n\r\nbe.  The land on which all the housing units are built\r\n\r\nis  vested  in all the owners as part of their  common\r\n\r\nproperty  in  accordance with the shares  allotted  to\r\n\r\nthem as shown in the strata title plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an estate, owners of bungalows, semi-detached\r\n\r\nhouses   and  terrace  houses  may  also  own  private\r\n\r\ngardens.  The  land comprising the garden  also  forms\r\n\r\npart  of the common property but an \"accessory\" strata\r\n\r\nlot  will be created for the garden so privately owned\r\n\r\nand  such  \"accessory\"  lot can  only  be  transferred\r\n\r\ntogether  with the strata lot comprising the  dwelling\r\n\r\nunit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the issue of strata titles\r\n\r\nfor  a condominium development as and when part of  it\r\n\r\nis  completed. In a very large housing project, it  is\r\n\r\ndesirable to allow the developers to convey the  legal\r\n\r\ntitle of completed housing units even though the whole\r\n\r\nhousing  project  has  not been completed.  This  will\r\n\r\nenable a developer to divest himself of his title in a\r\n\r\ncompleted housing unit while the construction  of  the\r\n\r\nremaining part is still in progress and a purchaser to\r\n\r\nobtain  a  good title to his individual  housing  unit\r\n\r\nmuch earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill some significant changes have been\r\n\r\nproposed for the pur-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npose  of  enlarging the powers, duties and obligations\r\n\r\nof  a management corporation established under Part IV\r\n\r\nof  the  Act  in  respect of subdivided buildings  and\r\n\r\ncondominium developments. These changes are  necessary\r\n\r\nbecause  every owner of a strata lot in  a  subdivided\r\n\r\nbuilding or a condominium development participates  in\r\n\r\ncommunity living. It has been found necessary to amend\r\n\r\nthe  law  in  this respect to ensure that every  owner\r\n\r\nplays his part in maintaining a subdivided building or\r\n\r\nthe condominium development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill will affect the rights and interests of\r\n\r\na  large  section  of  our  public.

The Bill provides that condominium land\r\n\r\nis  common  property.  In  other  words,  it  is  land\r\n\r\ncommonly  owned by the owners of the houses.  However,\r\n\r\nif the buildings in this condominium estate have to be\r\n\r\nrebuilt,  will this condominium land still  belong  to\r\n\r\nthe  owners of the housing units? In other  words,  if\r\n\r\nthere is rebuilding on this site and if the owner of a\r\n\r\nflat  on this condominium property is unable to  carry\r\n\r\nout  the  rebuilding of his flat, what will happen  to\r\n\r\nhim?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, can the Member repeat his question, because I did\r\n\r\nnot quite catch him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Minister has said that the land which is\r\n\r\ndeveloped by condominium housing belongs to the owners\r\n\r\nof the houses or flats on this property. My\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquestion is: if a block of flats has to be pulled down\r\n\r\nand  rebuilt,  what happens if certain owners  of  the\r\n\r\nflats are unable to rebuild, although they still  have\r\n\r\ntheir share of the land? What is the position of  such\r\n\r\nflat owners?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The answer is simple. All that the flat owner owns is\r\n\r\na  part  of the land. If the flat owner owns,  let  us\r\n\r\nsay,  Flat  A on the 16th floor, then if the  flat  is\r\n\r\ndemolished all he owns is a little portion of the land\r\n\r\nin the proportion in Which he owned it before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, if the land area measures 10,000 sq.ft. and there\r\n\r\nare 20 housing units on it, then if this piece of land\r\n\r\nis  subdivided  into 20 parts, it will be  wasted.  If\r\n\r\ncertain  owners do not want to rebuild their flats  on\r\n\r\nthis piece of land and if you subdivide this land into\r\n\r\n20 lots, it will be a waste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes, I agree with the Member that it will be a waste.\r\n\r\nBut  what  is  his point? The owner of a strata  title\r\n\r\nowns  his  particular flat. All these flats are  on  a\r\n\r\npiece of land. If there are 20 flats of equal area, he\r\n\r\nowns  one-twentieth of that land. Obviously you cannot\r\n\r\ndivide 10,000 sq.ft. by 20, as there will be not  much\r\n\r\nleft to build.

This  decision  was  arrived  at   after\r\n\r\nconsiderable thought. For many months before that, the\r\n\r\ncost  of  real estate had been sharply on the increase\r\n\r\nand   had  almost  doubled  over  the  previous  year.\r\n\r\nGovernment  was concerned about the rise  and  decided\r\n\r\nthat it should confine its efforts at keeping down the\r\n\r\ncost of residential property, leaving the market value\r\n\r\nof  commercial and industrial properties to find their\r\n\r\nlevels  by the interaction of factors governing supply\r\n\r\nand demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land is a precious commodity in Singapore. Of\r\n\r\nSingapore's total area of about 596 sq, km, or 230 sq.\r\n\r\nmiles, about 65% is State land or is held by statutory\r\n\r\nboards.  Only 34% or 20,540 hectares or 78 sq, miles,\r\n\r\nis still in private ownership. We, therefore, need not\r\n\r\nonly to husband land more carefully but also to ensure\r\n\r\nthat,   in  so  far  as  residential  properties   are\r\n\r\nconcerned, citizens of Singapore are able to  purchase\r\n\r\ntheir own houses. While those eligible for Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board flats are catered for, and the well-off  can  afford the more choice residential property,\r\n\r\nit is for the middle income groups who find housing of\r\n\r\nreasonable   standards  beyond  their  means   -   our\r\n\r\nteachers,    administrators,    lawyers,    engineers,\r\n\r\nexecutives, civil servants, etc., those serving in the\r\n\r\nPolice  and  Armed Forces and others - for whom  every\r\n\r\nendeavour should be made to enable them to enjoy  home\r\n\r\nownership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 11th September, 1973, administrative control in\r\n\r\nrespect  of residential properties has been  exercised\r\n\r\nby   the  Registrar  of  Titles  and  the  Residential\r\n\r\nProperty Advisory Committee under my supervision. This\r\n\r\nhas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven  us  an opportunity of observing the  effect  of\r\n\r\ncontrol  and  of working out necessary procedures  and\r\n\r\nrulings  so  that the sum total of all this experience\r\n\r\nhas  gone  into  the drafting of the Bill,  which,  in\r\n\r\nconsequence,  has  been revised  and  amended  several\r\n\r\ntimes.  Government has felt that it  should  not  rush\r\n\r\nheadlong into a legislative measure of this nature and\r\n\r\nthat  account  should be taken of the  effect  of  the\r\n\r\nrestriction  on the property market. Thus,  16  months\r\n\r\nafter  the restriction was imposed, it was found  that\r\n\r\nthe  curbs  on non-citizens could be relaxed  to  some\r\n\r\nextent.  Consequently, on 9th January, 1975, a  second\r\n\r\nGovernment press statement was issued stating that  as\r\n\r\nfrom   the  following  day  Government  would   remove\r\n\r\nrestrictions on the purchase by non-citizens of  flats\r\n\r\nor  apartments  in  buildings of  not  less  than  six\r\n\r\nstoreys,  including the ground floor,  and  that  such\r\n\r\nflats  or apartments could be bought and sold by  non-citizens  in the same way as commercial and industrial\r\n\r\nproperties.  Non-citizens wishing  to  purchase  other\r\n\r\ntypes  of  residential property would have to continue\r\n\r\nto   seek   approval   in  accordance   with   already\r\n\r\nestablished procedures. Sub-clause (3) of clause 2  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill expressly states this particular exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the second press statement in January\r\n\r\nthe   Residential  Property  Advisory  Committee   had\r\n\r\nconsidered  and  approved 220 applications  from  non-citizens  to  purchase  residential  properties.  Sub-clause  (4)  of clause 30 provides that all  approvals\r\n\r\ngranted from the 11th day of September, 1973,  to  the\r\n\r\n11th  day of September, 1975, shall be deemed to  have\r\n\r\nbeen made under the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has been drafted in general conformity with\r\n\r\nthe  guidelines laid down by the first press statement\r\n\r\nbut  departs from it in certain particulars where this\r\n\r\nhas   since  been  considered  necessary.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nintention  of the Government to refer the  Bill  to  a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee so that all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterested bodies and members of the public will  have\r\n\r\nan  opportunity to present their views which  will  be\r\n\r\ncarefully assessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement to the Bill sets out in\r\n\r\nsome  detail the nature of the provisions of the Bill,\r\n\r\nand  I  do  not therefore propose to discuss  them  in\r\n\r\ndetail. However, I would like to touch on some of  the\r\n\r\nmore salient points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill expressly prohibits the transfer to, or\r\n\r\npurchase  or  acquisition  by,  \"foreign  persons\"  of\r\n\r\n\"residential property\". These as well as a  number  of\r\n\r\nother expressions are defined in the Bill. It is  also\r\n\r\nprovided  that no estate or interest many  residential\r\n\r\nproperty belonging to a deceased person who dies on or\r\n\r\nafter   11th  September,  1973,  shall   pass   to   a\r\n\r\nbeneficiary who is a foreign person. In the case  of\r\n\r\nsuch  residential property which would otherwise  have\r\n\r\npassed   to  a  foreign  person,  the  legal  personal\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the deceased person are required to\r\n\r\nsell  such  property to a citizen of Singapore  or  an\r\n\r\n\"approved purchaser\" within five years of the death of\r\n\r\nsuch  deceased  person  and  pay  the  proceeds,  less\r\n\r\nexpenses,   to  the  foreign  person  so  beneficially\r\n\r\nentitled. It has been found necessary to include  such\r\n\r\na   provision  as  its  omission  would  constitute  a\r\n\r\nloophole  or  a method of circumventing  the  proposed\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill require \"foreign\r\n\r\ncompanies\"   to   dispose  of  all   the   residential\r\n\r\nproperties  owned by them at the date  of  the  coming\r\n\r\ninto  operation of the Act, i.e. 11th September,  1973\r\n\r\n(or  within  such  period as may  be  allowed  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister) by transferring these residential properties\r\n\r\nto  citizens  of Singapore or approved purchasers,  un\r\n\r\nless  such  foreign companies are permitted to  retain\r\n\r\nthem  by  virtue  of clause 16 or are  exempted  under\r\n\r\nclause  .22.  Where  such  foreign  companies  do  not\r\n\r\ndispose  of  such properties within that  period,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  may  direct  the Controller  of  Residential\r\n\r\nProperty to attach\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  sell  such  properties at any  time  after  three\r\n\r\nmonths  of  the  date  of  such  notice.  As  soon  as\r\n\r\npracticable thereafter, the Controller is required  to\r\n\r\nsell the same to a citizen of Singapore or an approved\r\n\r\npurchaser and pay the proceeds of the sale,  less  any\r\n\r\ncosts, to the foreign company concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to dwell for a moment on clauses 4 and 5\r\n\r\nwhich  are important aspects of the Bill. They achieve\r\n\r\nthe  object  of  the  policy as stated  in  the  press\r\n\r\nstatement  of 10th September, 1973, though  the  means\r\n\r\nemployed  are,  for  good reasons,  different.  It  is\r\n\r\nconsidered that the provisions in the Bill obliging  a\r\n\r\nforeign company to dispose of Its residential property\r\n\r\nprovide a more workable, less cumbersome and much less\r\n\r\nrestrictive  legislative framework  than  an  approach\r\n\r\nwhich  involves the disposal of shares held by foreign\r\n\r\nshareholders   as   envisaged  in  the   first   press\r\n\r\nstatement.  The  Bill provides that  where  a  foreign\r\n\r\ncompany holds residential property, it must dispose of\r\n\r\nsuch  residential property within a  period  of  time.\r\n\r\nHowever,   the   Minister,   after   considering   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of the Residential Property  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee, would have discretionary power to allow the\r\n\r\nforeign company to retain its residential property  as\r\n\r\nprovided in clause 16 (4) (a).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the very early drafts of the Bill, an attempt was\r\n\r\nmade  to implement the modus operandi outlined in  the\r\n\r\npress   statement  by  adopting  the  device   therein\r\n\r\nsuggested  which involved requiring foreign  companies\r\n\r\nto  dispose of shares held by foreign shareholders and\r\n\r\nby  making it mandatory for foreign companies to alter\r\n\r\ntheir  memorandum or articles of association so as  to\r\n\r\nprohibit non-citizens from becoming directors and also\r\n\r\nto  limit shareholdings to Singapore citizens or local\r\n\r\ncompanies.  But this approach, apart from  leading  to\r\n\r\ncertain  unintended  results  would  create  a  rather\r\n\r\nuntidy situation whereby the Controller of Residential\r\n\r\nProperty would be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobliged to dispose of many millions of shares  on  the\r\n\r\nStock  Exchange.  This approach was finally  abandoned\r\n\r\nfor  a  number of reasons. For one thing, banks  which\r\n\r\nhave  many millions of shares held by foreign persons,\r\n\r\nand  which  might  wish  to retain  their  residential\r\n\r\nproperty  would  be faced with having  to  dispose  of\r\n\r\ntheir  foreign  shareholdings. Further, the  procedure\r\n\r\nsuggested could lead to large numbers of shares  being\r\n\r\ndisposed  of  on  the stock market, which  could  well\r\n\r\nresult in the artificial depression of share prices in\r\n\r\nleading  counters and in the Stock Exchange generally.\r\n\r\nThat   procedure  would  also  cause  the  unnecessary\r\n\r\ndisposal  of  foreign shares by foreign investors  who\r\n\r\nacquired   the   shares  because  of   the   intrinsic\r\n\r\ninvestment potential of the foreign company. It  would\r\n\r\nseem   to  be  harsh  and  unfair  to  oblige  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors  to  dispose  of their shareholdings  merely\r\n\r\nbecause  the  foreign company in which  they  invested\r\n\r\nhappened  to hold residential properties in Singapore.\r\n\r\nSuch   properties  would  constitute  only   a   small\r\n\r\npercentage of the total assets of the foreign company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also a number of other reasons for\r\n\r\nabandoning the original approach which I do  not  now\r\n\r\npropose to discuss, but what finally persuaded us  to\r\n\r\nadopt the approach in clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill  as\r\n\r\nnow  drafted were the advantages of this method which\r\n\r\nare threefold, namely:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the forced sale is in respect of residential\r\n\r\nproperties  only (which is, in fact,  the  Government\r\n\r\nobjective); foreign shareholdings in these  companies\r\n\r\nwould   not,   therefore,  be   affected   once   the\r\n\r\nresidential properties are sold as required by  these\r\n\r\nclauses; further, under clause 16, the Minister would\r\n\r\nhave   a  discretion,  where  the  circumstances   so\r\n\r\nwarrant,  to  permit foreign companies  with  foreign\r\n\r\nshareholders  to  acquire,  purchase  or  retain  any\r\n\r\nspecific residential properties;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, administratively it would be much easier\r\n\r\nfor  the  Controller of Residential Property  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  property  transfers rather than share  transfers\r\n\r\nwhich  it  would  be best for a civil servant  not  to\r\n\r\nhandle; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it is generally likely to cause less\r\n\r\ndislocation  and  upheaval in  the  foreign  companies\r\n\r\nconcerned and in the stock market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that foreign companies only, but\r\n\r\nnot foreign natural persons or societies, are required\r\n\r\nto dispose of residential properties vested in them as\r\n\r\nat  11th  September,  1973. Such natural  persons  and\r\n\r\nsocieties will be required to obtain approval for  the\r\n\r\npurchase  of  properties  after  that  date.   Foreign\r\n\r\npersons  who  are permanent residents or  who  are  of\r\n\r\neconomic benefit to Singapore or who have professional\r\n\r\nqualifications or experience advantageous to Singapore\r\n\r\nmay   be  granted  approval  to  purchase  residential\r\n\r\nproperty for their own occupation as dwelling  houses.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  foreign companies which  are  of  economic\r\n\r\nbenefit to Singapore and intend to purchase or  retain\r\n\r\nresidential  property  for  occupation  by  their  key\r\n\r\npersonnel, may also be granted such approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to clause 14, we find that it follows the\r\n\r\nintent of the first press statement in providing  that\r\n\r\nresidential   properties  may  not  be  purchased   or\r\n\r\nacquired  by a citizen or an approved purchaser  as  a\r\n\r\nnominee  of  a  foreign person, but departs  from  the\r\n\r\npress statement in not providing in the Bill that  the\r\n\r\nnominee  citizen is to be charged income  tax  on  the\r\n\r\nvalue of the property. Apart from anything else,  such\r\n\r\na  \"taxing\" provision could be rendered ineffective or\r\n\r\neasily circumvented by the Singapore citizen disposing\r\n\r\nof  the residential property in question and pocketing\r\n\r\nthe  proceeds and there would be no means whereby  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could  recover  such  proceeds.  A  better\r\n\r\napproach,  it  is  thought, is  to  provide  that  any\r\n\r\ncitizen,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napproved  purchaser or foreign person who  contravenes\r\n\r\nthis provision should be liable to the general penalty\r\n\r\nset out in clause 25.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will thus be seen that Government's initial\r\n\r\nthoughts on the method of implementation have not been\r\n\r\ncarried  through where more appropriate  methods  have\r\n\r\nsubsequently emerged. Further amendments may  also  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  in  the  light  of fresh  information  laid\r\n\r\nbefore  the Select Committee. Representations  thereto\r\n\r\non every aspect of the Bill would be welcome as we are\r\n\r\nanxious  that the legislation which is finally enacted\r\n\r\nshould be workable and beneficial to the Republic as a\r\n\r\nwhole.   It   is   possible,   for   instance,    that\r\n\r\nrepresentations may be received on the effect  on  the\r\n\r\nproperty market of the implementation of clauses 4 and\r\n\r\n5.  Could  all  the  relatively expensive  residential\r\n\r\nproperties appearing on the market within this  period\r\n\r\nas  a result of this provision be beyond the reach  of\r\n\r\nmost  Singapore citizens, particularly in this present\r\n\r\nrecessional  state which is so vastly  different  from\r\n\r\nthe  economic situation obtaining in 1973?  Could  our\r\n\r\neconomists  and financial and property experts  advise\r\n\r\nwhether  there  is  or  is not  a  danger  of  foreign\r\n\r\ncompanies  being  unable  to sell  choice  residential\r\n\r\nproperties  they  are  legally  required  to  sell  to\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens within the required period?  Should\r\n\r\nwe  therefore exercise caution and keep in abeyance or\r\n\r\nsuspense clauses 4 and 5 and related, clauses and  not\r\n\r\nbring  them  into  operation until a later  date?  The\r\n\r\ncommencement clause, that is clause 1, would then need\r\n\r\nto  be  amended and some tidying up done at the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee   stage  to  render  that  clause  accurate.\r\n\r\nPerhaps   these  are  unnecessary  fears  but  changed\r\n\r\neconomic  conditions do warrant  some  caution  and  a\r\n\r\ncareful appraisal of these and other provisions in the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of diplomatic and consular missions and\r\n\r\nreligious groups in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  (as stated at clause 20) is that they  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  required to follow the formal  procedure  for\r\n\r\nobtaining  approval as required under  clause  16  but\r\n\r\nwill  nonetheless  have  to \"seek  the  permission  in\r\n\r\nwriting of the Minister\" before purchasing residential\r\n\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 sets out the position of housing developers\r\n\r\nwho,  before purchasing an estate or interest  in  any\r\n\r\nresidential property, will be required to obtain  from\r\n\r\nthe Controller of Housing a \"qualifying certificate\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister's power to exempt, which is contained in\r\n\r\nclause  22, would be exercised in circumstances  which\r\n\r\nwarrant exempting any person, body or property who  or\r\n\r\nwhich  would otherwise come within the ambit  of  this\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savings provision at clause 23 makes it clear\r\n\r\nthat  the  Act  is not applicable in certain  specific\r\n\r\ninstances.  For  example,  foreign  persons  are   not\r\n\r\nprevented  from entering into a tenancy agreement  for\r\n\r\nthe  occupation of residential property so long as the\r\n\r\nagreement does not exceed a term of seven years at any\r\n\r\none  time. Further, a permanent resident married to  a\r\n\r\ncitizen  is not precluded from purchasing  a  flat  or\r\n\r\nhouse   sold   under  Part  IV  of  the  Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Act  (Chapter  271)  if  the  Board   has\r\n\r\nconsented to such purchase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general penalty provided in the Bill for any\r\n\r\ncontravention  or failure to comply with  any  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Bill  for  which  no  penalty  is\r\n\r\nexpressly  provided  is,  on conviction,  a  fine  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  $5,000  or  imprisonment  for  a  term  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  three  years  or  to  both  such  fine  and\r\n\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude I would, once more, like to\r\n\r\nemphasize that the Bill is to be referred to a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  that adequate time will be given  for  the\r\n\r\nBill to be studied, and further that all represen-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntations  made  to the Select Committee will  be  given\r\n\r\nvery careful consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the Residential Property Bill be committed to a\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman\r\n\r\nand seven Members to be nominated by the Committee  of\r\n\r\nSelection.\"-[Mr E.

Those who are convicted of serious  crimes\r\n\r\nsuch  as  armed  robbery,  criminal  intimidation  and\r\n\r\nrioting should be sentenced to corrective training for\r\n\r\nperiods  of  three  to  seven years.  Such  corrective\r\n\r\ntraining  is  provided  for in  section  3(1)  of  the\r\n\r\nCriminal  Justice (Temporary Provisions) Act,  but  it\r\n\r\napplies only to persons who are not less than 18 years\r\n\r\nof age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disturbing trend has now emerged in that more and\r\n\r\nmore young persons between the ages of 16 and 18 years\r\n\r\nare committing serious crimes. However, this trend  is\r\n\r\nnot  peculiar  to Singapore. It is a trend  which'  is\r\n\r\nprevalent the world over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1970, the number of criminals within this age\r\n\r\ngroup who were sent to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npenal   institutions  totalled   186.

However,\r\n\r\nin  the first six months of this, year, the number has\r\n\r\nalready reached 377. Expressed as a percentage of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  number of criminals sent to penal institutions,\r\n\r\nthose who were within the age group of 16-18 years  in\r\n\r\n1970  accounted for 6.5%.

Work helps\r\n\r\nto  develop  discipline.

This  would  help the prisoner  to  readjust\r\n\r\nhimself  on  his  return to society.

But it is\r\n\r\nonly able to cater for a work force Of 1,900 prisoners\r\n\r\nout  of  an average of 4,000 prisoners.

As on 31st July, 1975,\r\n\r\nthere   are   18   vacancies  out  of  an   authorised\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  74  posts for instructors.  It  can\r\n\r\nbarely  cope with its present work programme and  much\r\n\r\nless carry out a programme of expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To run the prison industries in an efficient manner\r\n\r\nthere   must   be   sufficient  flexibility   in   the\r\n\r\nrecruitment   and  promotion  of  key  marketing   and\r\n\r\nproduction   staff,   purchase   of   raw   materials,\r\n\r\ncontracting of work and so on. There will  also  be  a\r\n\r\nneed  to  expand or install new facilities  and  these\r\n\r\nshould  be  done  promptly. Such flexibility  .is  not\r\n\r\navailable  to  the Prison Industries  Section  of  the\r\n\r\nPrisons  Department  because it  has  to  comply  with\r\n\r\nadministrative and finan-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncial    regulations   like   all   other    Government\r\n\r\ndepartments.   Without   the   flexibility,    private\r\n\r\nindustries   competing  with  the  Prison   Industries\r\n\r\nSection will have a decided advantage. On a number  of\r\n\r\noccasions the Prison Industries Section was unable  to\r\n\r\nmeet orders because it was unable to maintain adequate\r\n\r\nstocks  of raw materials. There has also been  a  high\r\n\r\nturnover  and poor recruitment of skilled  instructors\r\n\r\nowing to the more attractive salaries offered by other\r\n\r\nindustries in the private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore necessary to put the organisation of\r\n\r\nthe  productive work in prisons on a new footing.  The\r\n\r\nPrisons Reorganisation Committee examined the idea  of\r\n\r\nforming a private company to run the prison industries\r\n\r\nbut  considered  it unlikely that such an  arrangement\r\n\r\nwould achieve the desired results. Also there would be\r\n\r\nother problems, such as the heavy capital outlay, high\r\n\r\nturnover  and the special nature of prison labour  and\r\n\r\nthe need for physical security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee therefore recommended that a statutory\r\n\r\nboard  be  formed  to  run the  prison  industries.  A\r\n\r\nstatutory board has more flexibility than a Government\r\n\r\ndepartment  and  it is not precluded  from  Government\r\n\r\nhelp  in  the  form of a subsidy or a  grant.  It  was\r\n\r\ntherefore  decided that a statutory  board  should  be\r\n\r\nestablished   to   run  the  prison  industries.   The\r\n\r\nstatutory   board   will  be  called   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nCorporation  of Rehabilitative Enterprises,  in  brief\r\n\r\nSCORE.   I  shall  hereafter  refer  to  it  as   \"the\r\n\r\nCorporation\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prisons Reorganisation Committee also found that\r\n\r\nthe existing prisoner-earning scheme is inadequate and\r\n\r\ndoes  not provide sufficient incentive for hard  work.\r\n\r\nAt   present,   even  the  most  highly  skilled   and\r\n\r\nproductive  worker in prison earns not more  than  $40\r\n\r\nper  month.  Moreover, these wages do  not  allow  the\r\n\r\nprisoners  to contribute towards the upkeep  of  their\r\n\r\ndependants outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with the establishment of the Corporation,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has decided that the prisoner-earning\r\n\r\nscheme will be revised to take into consideration  the\r\n\r\nprisoners' skill. They will be placed on salary scales\r\n\r\nwhich  would  be  comparable to  those  in  the  other\r\n\r\nindustries. The revised earning scheme, which will  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  further  by  the Corporation  once  it  is\r\n\r\nestablished,  will range from $2.40  per  day  for  an\r\n\r\nunskilled  prisoner to $6.80 per  day  for  a  skilled\r\n\r\nartisan, depending on the product which he is  making.\r\n\r\nThereafter, prisoners will have to contribute  towards\r\n\r\ntheir upkeep of board and lodging in prison. Prisoners\r\n\r\nwill,  however, be permitted to use a portion of their\r\n\r\nwages  for  canteen purchases. The remaining  earnings\r\n\r\nwould  be  credited  to a compulsory  savings  account\r\n\r\nwhich  would be opened for each prisoner at  the  Post\r\n\r\nOffice  Savings Bank. The prisoner's dependants  would\r\n\r\nbe  permitted  to  draw  upon his  savings  while  the\r\n\r\nprisoner is serving his sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to mention the salient points in the\r\n\r\nBill.  The Bill is modelled on the Industrial Training\r\n\r\nBoard  Act.  It  provides for the setting  up  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Corporation of Rehabilitative  Enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe functions of the Corporation will be:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to manage and maintain the industrial or\r\n\r\nvocational  training institutions transferred  to  the\r\n\r\nCorporation  and  such  other  institutions   as   the\r\n\r\nCorporation  may  establish  for  the  employment,  or\r\n\r\nindustrial or vocational training of prisoners;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to provide or secure the provision of such\r\n\r\nemployment  or  facilities for such  training  and  to\r\n\r\norganise programmes therefore;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to provide technical training in skilled trades\r\n\r\nfor suitable prisoners;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to promote the vocational skills of prisoners;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) to require any prisoner to work pursuant to\r\n\r\nsection 50 of the Prisons Act; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) to advise the Government on all matters relating\r\n\r\nto  the provision of industrial or vocational training\r\n\r\nand technical training in trades for prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation shall be governed by a Board whose\r\n\r\nmembers  will be appointed by the Minister. The  Board\r\n\r\ncomprises:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a Chairman;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a Deputy Chairman who shall be the Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary,   Ministry   of   Home   Affairs   or   his\r\n\r\nrepresentative;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) a representative each from the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance,  the  Ministry of Labour and  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nTraining Board; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) not less than two but not more than ten other\r\n\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended that a successful entrepreneur will be\r\n\r\nappointed  as  the  Chairman and that  there  will  be\r\n\r\nsufficient representation of the private sector on the\r\n\r\nBoard. It can be seen from clause 16 of the Bill  that\r\n\r\nthe Board will have adequate powers and flexibility to\r\n\r\nperform the functions entrusted to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial or vocational training institutions, for\r\n\r\nthe   purpose  of  training  prisoners,   which   were\r\n\r\nestablished  by or vested and held by the  Government,\r\n\r\nwill be transferred to the Corporation as provided  in\r\n\r\nclause 10. Government employees in these industrial or\r\n\r\nvocational training institutions, and other Government\r\n\r\nemployees which the Minister may determine, will  also\r\n\r\nbe  transferred  to the Corporation.

The  Committee  recommended\r\n\r\ntherefore  that  judicial  officers  in  dealing  with\r\n\r\noffenders  should be compelled to consider  passing  a\r\n\r\nsentence  of either corrective training or  preventive\r\n\r\ndetention. The Committee further recommended that  the\r\n\r\ncourts  should also be empowered to impose  caning  in\r\n\r\naddition  to  sentences  of  corrective  training   or\r\n\r\npreventive detention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee noted that, under the existing section\r\n\r\n12  of  the  Criminal Procedure Code,  a  sentence  of\r\n\r\ncorrective training could range from two to four years\r\n\r\nbut   under  section  3(1)  of  the  Criminal  Justice\r\n\r\n(Temporary Provisions) Act, the permissible range of a\r\n\r\nsentence  of  corrective training is  three  to  seven\r\n\r\nyears. The Committee recommended that the range  of  a\r\n\r\nsentence  of  corrective training under  the  Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure Code should also be three to seven years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also recommended that the Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure Code be amended so as to -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) enhance the jurisdiction of the District Courts\r\n\r\nby  empowering District Judges to pass sentences of up\r\n\r\nto  five years for first offenders and up to ten years\r\n\r\nfor habitual offenders; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) empower the Magistrates' Courts to pass sentences\r\n\r\nof up to two years on first offenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 and 3 of this Bill seek to amend the\r\n\r\nCriminal  Procedure  Code  to  give  effect  to  these\r\n\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience has shown that determined criminals are\r\n\r\nnot  sufficiently  deterred by  merely  enhancing  the\r\n\r\npunishments for various offences. A greater  deterrent\r\n\r\nwould be to increase the chances of their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconviction when they are apprehended and, with this in\r\n\r\nmind, it has been decided through this Amendment  Bill\r\n\r\nto   adopt  certain  of  the  recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nCriminal Law Revision Committee of the United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nwhose  report was presented to the U.K. Parliament  in\r\n\r\nJune 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to restrict greatly the so-called\r\n\r\n\"right   of   silence\"  enjoyed   by   suspects   when\r\n\r\ninterrogated  by the police or by anyone charged  with\r\n\r\nthe  duty of investigating offences. By the \"right  of\r\n\r\nsilence\"  in this connection I mean the rule  that  if\r\n\r\nthe  suspect, when interrogated, omits to mention some\r\n\r\nfact  which  would exculpate him but keeps  this  back\r\n\r\ntill  the  trial,  the court may not  infer  that  his\r\n\r\nevidence  on this issue at the trial is untrue.  Under\r\n\r\nthe  proposals contained in clauses 5  and  6  of  the\r\n\r\nBill, it will be permissible to draw this inference if\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances justify it. The accused will  still\r\n\r\nhave the \"right of silence\" in the sense that it is no\r\n\r\noffence  to  refuse to answer questions  or  tell  his\r\n\r\nstory  when interrogated; but if he chooses to  remain\r\n\r\nsilent,  he  will  risk `having an  adverse  inference\r\n\r\ndrawn against him at his trial and the failure may, on\r\n\r\nthe basis of such inference, be treated as capable  of\r\n\r\namounting  to  corroboration  of  any  evidence  given\r\n\r\nagainst  him.  The Criminal Law Revision Committee  in\r\n\r\nits report remarked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In our opinion it is wrong that it should not be\r\n\r\npermissible for the jury or magistrates' court to draw\r\n\r\nwhatever inferences are reasonable from the failure of\r\n\r\nthe  accused, when interrogated, to mention a  defence\r\n\r\nwhich `he puts forward at his trial. To  forbid  it  seems to us to be contrary  to  common\r\n\r\nsense  and, without helping the innocent, to  give  an\r\n\r\nunnecessary   advantage  to   the   guilty.   Hardened\r\n\r\ncriminals often take advantage of the present rule  to\r\n\r\nrefuse  to answer any questions at all, and  this  may\r\n\r\ngreatly  hamper  the  police  and  even  bring   their\r\n\r\ninvestigations to a halt. Therefore the  abolition  of\r\n\r\nthe restriction would help justice.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  is  as  much in the public interest that a  guilty\r\n\r\nperson  should be convicted as it is that an  innocent\r\n\r\nperson should be acquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the proposal to allow adverse inferences to be\r\n\r\ndrawn  from  the  accused's silence  is  accepted,  it\r\n\r\nfollows that the requirements of the so-called Judges'\r\n\r\nRules   contained  in  Schedule  E  to  the   Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure  Code to caution a suspect that  he  is  not\r\n\r\nobliged  to say anything must be abolished or replaced\r\n\r\nby  different  kinds of warnings or  intimations.  The\r\n\r\nBill  therefore  proposes that after the  accused  has\r\n\r\nbeen  charged with an offence he should be served with\r\n\r\na   notice  in  writing  advising  him  that   adverse\r\n\r\ninferences may be drawn from his failure to mention  a\r\n\r\nfact on which he is going to rely at his trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Kingdom Government has not taken any steps\r\n\r\nto  introduce legislation based on the recommendations\r\n\r\nof  their  Criminal Law Revision Committee  but  their\r\n\r\nreport has been debated in the House of Lords, and the\r\n\r\nCouncil of the Law Society and the General Council  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bar of England and Wales have submitted memoranda\r\n\r\non  it.  The recommendation to restrict the  right  of\r\n\r\nsilence and to abolish the Judges' Rules attracted the\r\n\r\nmost  severe criticism. Some of the comments contained\r\n\r\nin  the  memoranda  of  the Law Society  and  the  Bar\r\n\r\nCouncil  have  been found to be not  relevant  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  context. In this context I must  point  out\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  no jury in Singapore and  we  have  to\r\n\r\nassume  that our magistrates and judges can empathise.\r\n\r\nit  is relevant to note here that whereas a very  high\r\n\r\nproportion  of  the  criminal  cases  heard   in   the\r\n\r\nmagistrates' courts in England and Wales are tried  by\r\n\r\nlay  justices,  all the magistrates in  Singapore  are\r\n\r\ntoday legally trained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another criticism is that there is little to protect\r\n\r\nthe  vast majority of alleged offenders who are to  be\r\n\r\nrequired   in  a  situation  of  stress  to  formulate\r\n\r\ndefences  to  as  yet an unspecified charge,  or  risk\r\n\r\nhaving  adverse  inferences drawn against  them  at  a\r\n\r\nlater,  and perhaps more critical stage. But clause  S\r\n\r\nof the Bill requires the accused to be served with a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnotice  in writing setting out the charge to which  he\r\n\r\nhas  to answer. He does not have to formulate defences\r\n\r\nin  relation to anything else he may have  done.  This\r\n\r\nprovision  does not appear in the draft Bill  prepared\r\n\r\nby   the  Criminal  Law  Revision  Committee.  Another\r\n\r\ncriticism is to the effect that it is quite wrong that\r\n\r\nthe  accused's  silence when interrogated  or  charged\r\n\r\nshould  be  capable of being regarded as corroborative\r\n\r\nof  other  evidence implicating the accused.  However,\r\n\r\nunder the present law the suspect who tells a lie  may\r\n\r\nbe  regarded  as  providing  cogent  evidence  against\r\n\r\nhimself  capable  of  amounting to  corroboration.  An\r\n\r\nextension of this rule to cover the accused's  silence\r\n\r\nwhen  confronted  with a specified charge  should  not\r\n\r\ntherefore cause undue alarm. Whether his silence  does\r\n\r\nor does not amount to corroboration must depend on all\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances of the particular case and this  is\r\n\r\nprecisely  what  the  Bill  states.  However,  serious\r\n\r\nconsideration has been given to these criticisms,  and\r\n\r\nthe  proposals of the Criminal Law Revision  Committee\r\n\r\nhave  been  modified  to suit the system  of  criminal\r\n\r\njustice  operating in Singapore and to provide further\r\n\r\nsafeguards. For instance, clause 5 of the  Bill  seeks\r\n\r\nto amend section 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code in\r\n\r\nsuch  a  way  that  even though an accused  person  is\r\n\r\nadvised to disclose his defence, if the making of  any\r\n\r\nstatement by an accused person appears to the court to\r\n\r\nbe   caused  by  an  inducement,  threat  or   promise\r\n\r\nproceeding from a person in authority, the  court  may\r\n\r\nin  its  discretion refuse to admit such statement  or\r\n\r\nallow  it to be used in cross-examination or  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of impeaching his credit. And clause l6 of the\r\n\r\nBill does not seek to adopt the recommendation of  the\r\n\r\nCriminal  Law  Revision Committee that  the  accused's\r\n\r\nfailure to give evidence on oath or affirmation at his\r\n\r\ntrial should be capable of providing corroboration  in\r\n\r\nlaw of any evidence given against him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another long standing practice which the Bill seeks\r\n\r\nto abolish is the accused's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nright  to make an unsworn statement from the  dock  in\r\n\r\nhis own defence instead of giving evidence on oath  or\r\n\r\naffirmation. Although the legal status of  an  unsworn\r\n\r\nstatement  is  that  of  a kind of  inferior  evidence\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  not given on oath or affirmation,  an\r\n\r\naccused who has something to hide and does not wish to\r\n\r\nbe  subject to cross-examination would invariably take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  his right to make an unsworn  statement\r\n\r\nfrom  the  dock.  However, if an  accused  who  has  a\r\n\r\ncriminal record wishes to make imputations against the\r\n\r\ncharacter of the witnesses for the prosecution, it may\r\n\r\nbe  to  his  advantage  to make an  unsworn  statement\r\n\r\ninstead of giving evidence on oath; for in the  latter\r\n\r\ncase,  but not the former, he will be liable  to  have\r\n\r\nhis criminal record brought out by the prosecution. In\r\n\r\nEngland,  the  right  to  make  an  unsworn  statement\r\n\r\nderived from the time when the accused was not allowed\r\n\r\nlegal   representation  (except   in   the   case   of\r\n\r\nmisdemeanours), but for some years before the Criminal\r\n\r\nEvidence Act, 1898, the accused was allowed to make an\r\n\r\nunsworn statement about The facts whether or , not  he\r\n\r\nwas  legally represented. It might have been  expected\r\n\r\nthat,  when the 1898 Act allowed him to give  evidence\r\n\r\non  oath, it would have abolished the right to make an\r\n\r\nunsworn  statement  as no longer  serving  any  useful\r\n\r\npurpose. Instead the Act expressly preserved the right\r\n\r\nin  keeping  with the policy of the Act that  pressure\r\n\r\nshould not be put on the accused to take advantage  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  right to give evidence on oath. The  learned\r\n\r\nmembers   of  the  Criminal  Law  Revision   Committee\r\n\r\nobserved:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We think that the time has come to reverse this\r\n\r\npolicy....  We  are strongly of the opinion  that  the\r\n\r\nright  to  make an unsworn statement about  the  facts\r\n\r\ninstead  of  giving  evidence on oath  or  affirmation\r\n\r\nshould be abolished. Whatever justification there  may\r\n\r\nhave  been for preserving the right in 1898: we  think\r\n\r\nthat  nowadays  the  accused, if  he  gives  evidence,\r\n\r\nshould do so in the same way as other witnesses and be\r\n\r\nsubject to cross-examination.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not only followed the English practice by\r\n\r\ngiving  the  accused  the right  to  make  an  unsworn\r\n\r\nstatement.  We  have gone even further  than  that  by\r\n\r\nallowing  him to tender or read out from  the  dock  a\r\n\r\nwritten statement prepared by his lawyer. It does  not\r\n\r\nappear  to  be  in  the interest of justice  that  the\r\n\r\naccused  should  have  the  advantages  I  have   just\r\n\r\nmentioned, for what they may be worth. Clauses 10,  14\r\n\r\nand  16  of  the  Bill therefore seek  to  change  the\r\n\r\nprocedure in trials before the Subordinate Courts  and\r\n\r\nthe High Court, abolishing the right of an accused  to\r\n\r\nmake  an unsworn statement about the facts instead  of\r\n\r\ngiving evidence on oath or affirmation. If the accused\r\n\r\nrefuses  to  give evidence on oath or affirmation  the\r\n\r\ncourt  may draw inferences as appear proper  from  the\r\n\r\nrefusal,  if without good cause. However, the  accused\r\n\r\nshall  not  be compelled to give evidence on  his  own\r\n\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 proposes to require the accused to give\r\n\r\nnotice  to  the  Court or to the Public Prosecutor  of\r\n\r\nparticulars  of any alibi, if such is his defence.  If\r\n\r\nhe does not give such notice, he shall not without the\r\n\r\nleave  of the court adduce evidence in support of  the\r\n\r\nalibi  at  his  trial. In 1972 the Criminal  Procedure\r\n\r\nCode  was amended so as to require an accused to  give\r\n\r\nnotice  of his alibi at a preliminary inquiry, but  no\r\n\r\nsuch  requirement was imposed in respect of a  summary\r\n\r\ntrial in the Magistrates' and District Courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 of the Bill seeks to make radical changes\r\n\r\nto  the  rule against hear say evidence. This rule  is\r\n\r\nsummarised  in the third edition of Professor  Cross's\r\n\r\n\"Evidence\" on page 387 as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Express or implied assertions of persons other than\r\n\r\nthe  witness  who  is testifying,  and  assertions  in\r\n\r\ndocuments  produced to the court when  no  witness  is\r\n\r\ntestifying, are inadmissible as evidence of the  truth\r\n\r\nof that which was `asserted.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  rule,  however, is subject to a large  number  of\r\n\r\nexceptions,  the  best  known of  which  are  informal\r\n\r\nadmissions   and   confessions,  dying   declarations,\r\n\r\nstatements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  public documents and some statements admissible as\r\n\r\nbeing part of the res gestae. But there are many other\r\n\r\nexceptions,  some by common law and some  by  statute.\r\n\r\nProfessor Cross has pointed out that the admission  of\r\n\r\ncertain  kinds of evidence \"can only be  explained  on\r\n\r\nthe footing that there are many more exceptions to the\r\n\r\nhearsay rule than is commonly supposed\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present law has caused a great deal of trouble\r\n\r\nowing   to  the  difficulty  of  deciding  whether   a\r\n\r\nstatement  is  hearsay, and,  if  so,  whether  it  is\r\n\r\nadmissible  under any of the exceptions to  the  rule.\r\n\r\nThe   difficulty   is   further  compounded   by   the\r\n\r\ndifferences  between the English law of  evidence  and\r\n\r\nour law which is based on the Indian Evidence Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme that the Bill proposes has the following\r\n\r\npurposes:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to admit all hearsay evidence likely to be\r\n\r\nvaluable to the greatest extent possible without undue\r\n\r\ncomplication or delay to the proceedings;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to ensure that evidence should continue to be\r\n\r\ngiven  for  the  most part orally by allowing  hearsay\r\n\r\nevidence only if the maker of the statement cannot  be\r\n\r\ncalled  or  it  is  desirable to supplement  his  oral\r\n\r\nevidence; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) to include necessary safeguards against the\r\n\r\ndanger of manufactured hearsay evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposals in this Bill relating to hearsay\r\n\r\nevidence  adopt many of the recommendations  contained\r\n\r\nin  the  Criminal  Law  Revision Committee's  Eleventh\r\n\r\nReport. Certain modifications have been made to  these\r\n\r\nproposals after considering the views expressed by the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Council of the Bar of England and  Wales  and\r\n\r\nthe  Council  of the Law Society of England  in  their\r\n\r\nmemoranda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken to amend other\r\n\r\nsections of the Code to correct existing mistakes  and\r\n\r\nanomalies as well as to expedite the administration of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njustice as when an accused wishes to plead guilty  in\r\n\r\nthe High Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to refer the Bill to Select Committee\r\n\r\nwhere   all  representations  will  be  given  careful\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today no less than four Bills are\r\n\r\nbeing  debated, which are intended to make substantial\r\n\r\namendments  to our judicial system. We have  just  had\r\n\r\nthe    Criminal    Justice   (Temporary    Provisions)\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill  passed. Now  we  are  debating  the\r\n\r\nCriminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill, and later we\r\n\r\nshall  be going through the Evidence (Amendment)  Bill\r\n\r\nand    the   Criminal   Law   (Temporary   Provisions)\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sudden introduction of amendments to so many\r\n\r\nof  our Criminal Law Acts, one begins to wonder if all\r\n\r\nthese   pieces  of  legislation  were  defective.   No\r\n\r\nevidence has been advanced so far to substantiate  the\r\n\r\nneed  for  radical changes which the passing of  these\r\n\r\nBills will have on our judicial practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there are so many hon. Members in this House\r\n\r\nwith  legal  training,  I  would  leave  to  them  the\r\n\r\nintricacies of the debate in respect of legal matters.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would like to touch on two clauses  of  the\r\n\r\nBill, namely, clauses 5 and 6 which, even as a layman,\r\n\r\nI feel I can comment on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 deletes the legal requirement to give a\r\n\r\ncaution  to  a  person  under  arrest  before  he   is\r\n\r\ninterrogated  by  the police. Instead,  he  is  to  be\r\n\r\nserved   with  a  notice  advising  him  that  adverse\r\n\r\ninferences may be drawn from his failure to mention  a\r\n\r\nfact  on which he is going to rely at his trial. This,\r\n\r\nto  me,  means  a person arrested, even before  he  is\r\n\r\ncharged,  has  to  spill the beans.  If  he  does  not\r\n\r\nmention a fact that is later brought out in his trial,\r\n\r\nthen adverse inferences would be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrawn. During the course of a lengthy trial, all sorts\r\n\r\nof  minor  as well as major facts are brought  out  in\r\n\r\ncourt. If any one of the facts that is brought out  in\r\n\r\ncourt has not been mentioned by the accused during the\r\n\r\narrest  and interrogation by the police, then,  it  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to adversely affect the accused. This, I  feel,\r\n\r\nis a fundamental deviation from the existing law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 6, the accused cannot even remain\r\n\r\nsilent. While being interrogated, the silence  of  the\r\n\r\naccused  is  to be taken as amounting to corroboration\r\n\r\nof   any  evidence  against  him.  When  he  is  being\r\n\r\ninterrogated  by a police officer who  could  even  be\r\n\r\njust  a  police constable, the accused must  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to make up his mind immediately what line  of\r\n\r\ndefence he is going to take during the trial and  must\r\n\r\ninform the interrogator the facts he is going to  rely\r\n\r\non  for  his  defence. He has to make a decision  even\r\n\r\nbefore he has an opportunity to consult legal counsel.\r\n\r\nThere is no question of legal advice that he may  have\r\n\r\nto seek in order to put up his defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure there are many other points in this Bill\r\n\r\nthat  need  further and more important comments  which\r\n\r\nhon.  Members from the legal profession in  the  House\r\n\r\nwould no doubt make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, these two clauses are sufficiently important\r\n\r\nas fundamental changes from the present procedures. To\r\n\r\nme, it means that if the police cannot secure evidence\r\n\r\nthrough detective work, they can get evidence by  just\r\n\r\narresting  an accused and interrogating him.  What  he\r\n\r\nsays or what he does not say is to be used as evidence\r\n\r\nagainst him. Are we trying to promulgate laws to cover\r\n\r\nup   for  police  deficiency?  Are  our  laws  to   be\r\n\r\npromulgated to rectify the ineffectiveness  of  police\r\n\r\ninvestigations? Is Parliament asked to do police work?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that this Bill is being committed to a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L.

Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding the report of the\r\n\r\nCriminal Law Revision Committee, I take the view that\r\n\r\nthis Bill will have the effect of changing or removing\r\n\r\naltogether time-tested legal concepts and practices in\r\n\r\ncriminal law. What is more, it will construct new\r\n\r\ninstruments of prosecution for the prosecuting power\r\n\r\nof the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions in the Bill are not selective\r\n\r\nprovisions, selective in the sense that they relate to\r\n\r\ncertain  offences.  They are blanket  provisions.  The\r\n\r\nmeaning  and implications of the changes described  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill are extensive and are not obvious. How  they\r\n\r\nrelate  to  criminal practice and the conduct  of  the\r\n\r\ncourt  in  its  function of administering  justice  is\r\n\r\nhighly important. The possibilities of clause 6 of the\r\n\r\nBill,  for  example, where the accused's  silence  can\r\n\r\ncorroborate the evidence against his own silent person\r\n\r\nare  not  easily  discernible. The  Member  for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah  has  also made reference to this clause  with\r\n\r\nsome expertise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 abolishes the right of an accused to make\r\n\r\nan unsworn statement and he runs the risk of having an\r\n\r\nadverse  inference made against him if he  refuses  to\r\n\r\ngive evidence, on oath without good cause. Whatever is\r\n\r\ncontemplated   by  \"good  cause\"  is  left   extremely\r\n\r\nindefinite  good cause for the court, good  cause  for\r\n\r\nthe  prosecutor  or good cause for the accused  person\r\n\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes in the Bill are indeed far-reaching and I\r\n\r\nam  therefore  glad that this Bill  and  the  Evidence\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill  are  being committed  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  where  they  will be  examined  in  greater\r\n\r\ndetail. But at this stage. Sir, I wish to express  the\r\n\r\nhope  that  all  these changes which  will  facilitate\r\n\r\nprosecution of the criminal by apparently constricting\r\n\r\nthe defence of the accused will not have the result of\r\n\r\nblunting  the  effectiveness of criminal investigation\r\n\r\nwhich  ends  with the apprehension of the criminal  in\r\n\r\nthe very first place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, may I thank both Members for their criticisms and\r\n\r\ninterest  in  this  Bill  which,  as  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon Gardens says, makes radical and far-reaching\r\n\r\nchanges.

Under  the\r\n\r\nAct, companies implementing new and desirable projects\r\n\r\ncould  be  granted pioneer status which  exempts  them\r\n\r\nfrom income tax for a period of five years. By the end\r\n\r\nof  April,  1975, there were a total  of  411  pioneer\r\n\r\nenterprises,   investing  some  $3,100   million   and\r\n\r\nmanufacturing a wide range of products in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as we strive towards higher levels of skills\r\n\r\nand  technology  in our industrialisation  effort,  we\r\n\r\nhave found that the existing tax relief period of five\r\n\r\nyears  is  too  short  to  provide  an  effective  tax\r\n\r\nincentive   for  the  more  sophisticated   types   of\r\n\r\nindustries  which  we  are now trying  to  attract  to\r\n\r\nSingapore. These new industries such as machine tools,\r\n\r\ndiesel   engines,   precision  instruments,   aircraft\r\n\r\ncomponents,   specialised  electrical  equipment   and\r\n\r\nindustrial  machinery  involve  much  heavier  capital\r\n\r\ninvestments  in plant and machinery and  require  more\r\n\r\nsophisticated  manufacturing  skills  which  are  only\r\n\r\nacquired   after   long  periods  of  training.   Such\r\n\r\nindustries have long gestation periods and  take  much\r\n\r\nlonger  time to become profitable, some breaking  even\r\n\r\nonly in the fourth or fifth year of production. A five-year  tax  relief period would therefore  not  benefit\r\n\r\nthem  to  any  extent and a longer period  of  pioneer\r\n\r\nstatus   is  now  necessary  to  encourage  such   new\r\n\r\nindustries to establish in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, section 6 of the Act is being amended to extend\r\n\r\nthe tax relief period of a pioneer enterprise from the\r\n\r\npresent fixed period of five years to a maximum of ten\r\n\r\nyears.  The  longer period of tax relief  will  enable\r\n\r\ndesirable  industries with long gestation  periods  to\r\n\r\neffectively  enjoy  pioneer tax  incentives  and  thus\r\n\r\nprovide  a  more effective promotional  tool  for  the\r\n\r\nfurther   upgrading   of  manufacturing   skills   and\r\n\r\ntechnology  in Singapore. The maximum ten  years'  tax\r\n\r\nrelief  will  only  be granted to the  most  deserving\r\n\r\ncases   involving   large  capital   investments   and\r\n\r\nsophisticated technology and manufacturing skills. The\r\n\r\nlonger  period  of pioneer status will only  apply  to\r\n\r\npioneer  certificates  awarded after  the  date  these\r\n\r\namendments come into force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, to encourage the establishment of small\r\n\r\nbut  highly specialised supporting industries, section\r\n\r\n5  of  the Act is also being amended to dispense  with\r\n\r\nthe requirement that a company\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  incur  a fixed capital expenditure of  not  less\r\n\r\nthan  $1  million  before it is eligible  for  pioneer\r\n\r\nstatus. With the establishment of a widening range  of\r\n\r\nlarge  scale manufacturing plants in Singapore,  there\r\n\r\nis  an  increasing  need  for  specialised  supporting\r\n\r\nindustries  to  supply  parts and  components  to  the\r\n\r\nlarger    manufacturing   plants.   Such    supporting\r\n\r\nindustries often involve sophisticated technology  and\r\n\r\nskills  but  owing to their smaller size  their  fixed\r\n\r\ncapital  investment may not reach $1 million.  Removal\r\n\r\nof  this  minimum investment requirement  will  enable\r\n\r\npioneer  tax  incentive  to be  used  to  promote  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of such desirable supporting  industries\r\n\r\nwhich  are now playing an increasingly important  role\r\n\r\nin  the  further  integration and development  of  our\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequential amendments are also being made to\r\n\r\nsections 10 and 25 of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support this Bill which seeks\r\n\r\nto provide greater and better tax relief incentives to\r\n\r\ncertain types of industries which help to promote  our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the world economic recession and the fact\r\n\r\nthat  its  effects are still being felt, and that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is trying its best to revive our  economic\r\n\r\nactivity,  the  Economic Development  Board  has  more\r\n\r\nimportant  tasks  to perform. Foreign  investments  in\r\n\r\nSingapore have decreased this year, amounting to  only\r\n\r\none-third  of that of last year. This shows  that  our\r\n\r\neconomic  position  has  been affected.  The  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board, therefore, has the immediate  .and\r\n\r\nurgent task of attracting more foreign investment into\r\n\r\nSingapore   so   as   to  promote  our   economy   and\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme, thus creating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  jobs  for our people.

One\r\n\r\ncomplaint  is that an applicant normally has  to  wait\r\n\r\nfor  half  a  year to one year before he receives  any\r\n\r\nreply. This delay in replying will discourage foreign'\r\n\r\ninvestors from investing in our local industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint is that the staff in the relevant\r\n\r\ndepartment  have  not  been  giving  good  advice   or\r\n\r\ndirection to foreign investors. Perhaps it is  due  to\r\n\r\nthe  lack of commercial knowledge on the part  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  servants concerned. If that is  the  case,  we\r\n\r\nshould  train  them properly so that they  can  better\r\n\r\nhandle  inquiries from foreign investors.

It is, therefore,\r\n\r\nproposed to license these travel agents as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Travel Agents Bill, 1975, will empower the\r\n\r\nSingapore Tourist Promotion Board to regulate  the\r\n\r\nactivities  of  all  travel agents  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhether handling in-bound or out-bound tours.  All\r\n\r\ntourist  enterprises will have to be licensed.

How much the licensing fee is going\r\n\r\nto  be  and how much the travel agencies have  to  pay\r\n\r\ntowards  the  Compensation Fund will be  left  to  the\r\n\r\nBoard to decide, although the Minister mentioned  just\r\n\r\nnow  about  the  primary cash levy of $5,000  and  the\r\n\r\nother  payment to be in the form of a bank  guarantee,\r\n\r\nif  I  understood him correctly. The  payment  to  the\r\n\r\nCompensation  Fund  could  consist  of,  according  to\r\n\r\nclause 32(f) an initial contribution as well as annual\r\n\r\ncontributions.  If these contributions  are  to  be  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent  to  the  setting  up  of  mosquito   travel\r\n\r\nagencies,  then  they  should be substantial.  If  the\r\n\r\npayments are not substantial, then they would not be a\r\n\r\ndeterrent  to anybody to set up a travel agency.  This\r\n\r\nwould,  as I have said earlier, increase the  cost  of\r\n\r\nrunning  a travel agency and the additional cost  will\r\n\r\nbe passed on to the travellers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the purpose of the Compensation Fund is to\r\n\r\nsafeguard   the  welfare  of  Singaporeans  travelling\r\n\r\nabroad, if they are stranded and lose financially as a\r\n\r\nresult of the shady business of the travel agency, and\r\n\r\nnot  to  increase  the funds of the Tourist  Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard,  then I would suggest that the licensed  travel\r\n\r\nagencies be required to provide a bank guarantee of  a\r\n\r\nsum  to be decided by the Tourist Promotion Board  and\r\n\r\nnot pay such sums into the Compensation Fund. The bank\r\n\r\nguarantee  should  be a sufficient  deterrent  and  it\r\n\r\nwould not be an excuse for travel agencies to increase\r\n\r\ntheir fares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I contend, Sir, that it is a good thing to encourage\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens  to travel abroad,  especially  to\r\n\r\nother  countries in Asia. When the greatest critic  of\r\n\r\nSingapore comes back after a trip\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabroad,  he  appreciates  Singapore  more  than   ever\r\n\r\nbefore.  Let me quote the example of a politician  who\r\n\r\nwas  the  greatest critic of the Singapore  Government\r\n\r\nand  its  way of life. When he came back after  having\r\n\r\nbeen away for a short while from Singapore in 1972, he\r\n\r\nsaid   that   \"there  is  no  place  like  Singapore\".\r\n\r\nTherefore,  these  restrictions  imposed   on   travel\r\n\r\nagencies will result in an increased cost of running a\r\n\r\ntravel agency which no doubt will be passed on to  the\r\n\r\ntravelling  public  and  will  reduce  the  number  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans going abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I contend that the same safeguards for Singapore\r\n\r\ntravellers   can  be  obtained  by  other   forms   of\r\n\r\nregistration of travel agencies, prosecuting them when\r\n\r\nthey  fall  foul of the law or when they  cheat  their\r\n\r\nclients    by   not   fulfilling   their   contractual\r\n\r\nobligations. Sir, there are reputable, well-run travel\r\n\r\nagencies  as  well as not-so reputable ones.  But  the\r\n\r\nenforcement of this Act will penalise the good  travel\r\n\r\nagencies as well as the bad agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to clauses 20, 21, 22 and 23 which\r\n\r\ndeal  with  the  power to search  premises,  power  to\r\n\r\narrest, power to investigate, and powers of the Board.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  provisions of these  clauses,  any  police\r\n\r\nconstable has a right to search all persons found in a\r\n\r\ntravel  agency,  seize all documents, detain  persons,\r\n\r\narrest  any  person without a warrant, take possession\r\n\r\nof all articles, etc, if the police constable suspects\r\n\r\nthat  the travel agency has committed an offence under\r\n\r\nthis  Act. This, I am afraid, with due respect to  our\r\n\r\nPolice  Force,  gives  a  police  constable  unlimited\r\n\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this Bill also cover those airlines that are not\r\n\r\nregistered as travel agencies but offer package tours,\r\n\r\nwhich  include  travel,  transportation,  sightseeing,\r\n\r\nhotel accommodation, etc.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that this Bill is being cornmitted to a\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee,  and  I am  sure  that  the  travel\r\n\r\nagencies will, make the necessary representations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I do not propose to make a lengthy reply since\r\n\r\nthe Bill is going to Select Committee, but some of the\r\n\r\ncomments  by  the  Member for  Telok  Blangah  can  be\r\n\r\nconsidered now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all agreed that there is a necessity for some\r\n\r\nkind  of  regulation.

The Bill also  seeks  to\r\n\r\nclarify  certain sections of the Act  relating  to\r\n\r\nthe accused's character and his right to claim the\r\n\r\nprivilege  against self-incrimination and  against\r\n\r\nincriminating his spouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the\r\n\r\nadmissibility of statements produced by computers.\r\n\r\nIt  seems  desirable to include this provision  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  because the increasing use of computers\r\n\r\nby  the  Post Office, statutory bodies, banks  and\r\n\r\nbusiness   firms   to  store  certain   kinds   of\r\n\r\ninformation will make it more difficult  to  prove\r\n\r\ncertain matters, such as cheque frauds, unless  it\r\n\r\nis   made  possible  for  this  to  be  done  from\r\n\r\ncomputers.  Admissibility  is  subject  to  strict\r\n\r\nconditions,   necessary   to   ensure   that   the\r\n\r\ninformation is reliable, as to the regular  supply\r\n\r\nof  information to the computer and to its  proper\r\n\r\nworking.

Subsection  (3)  of\r\n\r\nsection  34B  provides  that  in  estimating   the\r\n\r\nweight,  if  any, to be attached  to  a  statement\r\n\r\nproduced by a computer, regard shall be had to all\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances  and,  in  particular,  to  its\r\n\r\ncontemporaneity or otherwise and to  the  question\r\n\r\nwhether any person who was in a position to do  so\r\n\r\nhad  any  reason  to conceal or  misrepresent  the\r\n\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960, section 54 of our Evidence Ordinance was\r\n\r\namended  to take away the accused's immunity  from\r\n\r\ncross-examination  about his other  misconduct  if\r\n\r\nthe  accused has personally or by his advocate and\r\n\r\nsolicitor asked questions of the witnesses for the\r\n\r\nprosecution  with a view to establishing  his  own\r\n\r\ngood  character, or has given evidence of his good\r\n\r\ncharacter,  or  the  nature  and  conduct  of  the\r\n\r\ndefence is such as to involve imputations  on  the\r\n\r\ncharacter  of  the  prosecution  witness,  or  the\r\n\r\naccused  has  given  evidence  against  any  other\r\n\r\nperson  charged  with  the  same  offence.  Modern\r\n\r\ncriminals,  however, have developed a practice  of\r\n\r\ngiving  the  impression that they are  respectable\r\n\r\npersons  while  avoiding taking any  course  which\r\n\r\nclearly enables the court to hold that the accused\r\n\r\nhas  personally or by his advocate  and  solicitor\r\n\r\nasked  questions of witnesses for the  prosecution\r\n\r\nwith   a   view  to  establishing  his  own   good\r\n\r\ncharacter, or has given evidence of his good\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharacter  within  the meaning of  subsection  (2)  of\r\n\r\nsection  54 of the Evidence Act. Moreover, section  54\r\n\r\nof the Act does not make it clear that the prosecution\r\n\r\ncan  adduce evidence to prove that the accused is  not\r\n\r\nof good character and at what stage of the proceedings\r\n\r\nit  may  do  so.  Clause  4 of  the  Bill,  therefore,\r\n\r\nproposes  to  clarify the situation and to  deal  with\r\n\r\ncases  in  which  it  is hinted indirectly,  that  the\r\n\r\naccused  is a respectable person. The clause makes  it\r\n\r\nclear  that  a co-accused, as well as the prosecution,\r\n\r\nmay cross-examine the accused to rebut his claim to be\r\n\r\nof  good  disposition  or reputation  and  may  adduce\r\n\r\nevidence  for this purpose. However, clause 6 proposes\r\n\r\nto  restrict the right of the prosecution or of a  co-accused to cross-examine the, accused about misconduct\r\n\r\nother than that involved in the offence charged on the\r\n\r\nground  that  he  has  made  imputations  against  the\r\n\r\nwitnesses  against him. The court shall not  permit  a\r\n\r\nquestion  tending  to  reveal  that  the  accused  has\r\n\r\ncommitted  or  has been charged with or  convicted  or\r\n\r\nacquitted of any offence or that he is a person of bad\r\n\r\ndisposition or reputation unless it is the opinion  of\r\n\r\nthe  court  that  the  question  is  relevant  to  the\r\n\r\naccused's  credibility  as a  witness.  However,  this\r\n\r\nrestriction  does not apply to a question  tending  to\r\n\r\nprove  that  the  accused has  committed  the  offence\r\n\r\ncharged  or  to  a question which will  enable  a  co-accused to reveal a fact which would prove that he  is\r\n\r\nnot  guilty  of any offence with which he  is  jointly\r\n\r\ncharged with the accused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 restricts in two ways the right of the\r\n\r\naccused,  if he gives evidence, to claim the privilege\r\n\r\nagainst  self-incrimination or  against  incriminating\r\n\r\nhis  spouse.  The proposal is that the accused  should\r\n\r\nhave  no privilege against self-incrimination  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of a question about the offence charged or about\r\n\r\nany  other  offence  which is admissible  as  standing\r\n\r\ndirectly  or indirectly to show that he committed  the\r\n\r\noffence  charged  but  should have  the  privilege  in\r\n\r\nrespect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   other   offences  which  are  relevant   to   his\r\n\r\ncredibility as a witness. But no privilege  should  be\r\n\r\nallowed  if  the accused has claimed  to  be  of  good\r\n\r\ndisposition or reputation. On the same principle,  the\r\n\r\naccused   should  be  allowed  no  privilege   against\r\n\r\nincriminating  his  wife  except  in  relation  to  an\r\n\r\noffence going to his credibility as a witness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5, 8 and 10 of the Bill seek to abrogate the\r\n\r\ncommon  law rule, making it obligatory for a judge  to\r\n\r\ngive  a  warning  of the danger of convicting  on  the\r\n\r\nuncorroborated   evidence  of  an  accomplice.   Since\r\n\r\ncorroboration is not required as a matter of  law,  it\r\n\r\nfollows that the conviction will not be quashed merely\r\n\r\nbecause of absence of corroboration; but if the  judge\r\n\r\ndoes  not warn himself the conviction will be quashed,\r\n\r\neven if there is corroboration, unless the appeal  can\r\n\r\nbe  dismissed  on the ground that \"no  miscarriage  of\r\n\r\njustice  has  actually occurred\".  Since  evidence  in\r\n\r\ncorroboration  must  be \"independent  testimony  which\r\n\r\naffects  the  accused  by  connecting  or  tending  to\r\n\r\nconnect him with the crime\", it follows that a witness\r\n\r\ncannot  corroborate himself. A witness whose  evidence\r\n\r\nrequires corroboration, or in whose case corroboration\r\n\r\nhas  to  be  looked  for under the common  law  rules,\r\n\r\ncannot  be corroborated by a similar witness. Thus  an\r\n\r\nunsworn  child  cannot  corroborate  another  and  one\r\n\r\naccomplice cannot corroborate another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may well ask, who is an accomplice? There is\r\n\r\nno  legal  definition of the word. But  on  any  view,\r\n\r\npersons are accomplices who are participes criminis in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the  actual  crime  charged,  whether  as\r\n\r\nprincipals or accessories before or after the fact  or\r\n\r\npersons  committing, procuring or aiding and abetting.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the natural and primary meaning of the  term\r\n\r\n\"accomplice.\" But persons falling strictly outside the\r\n\r\nambit   of  this  category  have  been  held   to   be\r\n\r\naccomplices;  e.g, receivers have  been  held  to  be\r\n\r\naccomplices of the thieves from whom they received the\r\n\r\ngoods although\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  receiver  was  not necessarily  a  party  to  the\r\n\r\nsubstantive crime of theft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common law rules have the great disadvantage' of\r\n\r\nbeing  sometimes difficult to apply owing to technical\r\n\r\ndistinctions, for example as to what kinds of evidence\r\n\r\nmay he corroboration and as to whether a person is  an\r\n\r\naccomplice.   These  difficulties  have  caused   many\r\n\r\nmistaken rulings at trials and consequent quashings of\r\n\r\nconvictions. One disadvantage in particular is that  a\r\n\r\nconviction  may have to be quashed if the judge  holds\r\n\r\nthat   a  piece  of  evidence  is  capable  of   being\r\n\r\ncorroboration but the appellate court holds that it is\r\n\r\nnot capable of being so. Convictions have been quashed\r\n\r\neven  in  cases  where  there was  ample  evidence  to\r\n\r\nconvict  the  accused  because  the  appellate   court\r\n\r\nconsidered  that the judge might have found  that  the\r\n\r\nevidence was corroborated when in fact it was not, and\r\n\r\nso  have  thought that the danger referred to did  not\r\n\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for exercising caution in accepting the\r\n\r\nevidence of accomplices are obvious:- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the accomplice being a criminal, his evidence is\r\n\r\nimpugned;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, an accomplice has a strong motive to remove\r\n\r\nsuspicion from himself by fixing it on another;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, if he has a spite against the accused, then,\r\n\r\nknowing  all the circumstances of the crime,  he  will\r\n\r\nhave  little  difficulty  in making  convincing  false\r\n\r\ncharges against him, although the accused is innocent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as long ago as 1836 when it was only a rule of\r\n\r\npractice  that a special direction should be given  as\r\n\r\nto  the evidence of accomplices, Henry Joy, Lord Chief\r\n\r\nBaron  of the Court of Exchequer in Ireland, published\r\n\r\na  book, On the Evidence of Accomplices, in the course\r\n\r\nof which he wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`How the practice which at present prevails, could\r\n\r\never  have  grown into a general regulation,  must  be\r\n\r\nmatter  of surprise to every person who considers  its\r\n\r\nnature. Why the case of an accomplice should require a\r\n\r\nparticular  rule for itself: why it should  not,  like\r\n\r\nthat  of every other witness of whose credit there  is\r\n\r\nan  impeachment, he left to the unfettered  discretion\r\n\r\nof  the judge, to deal with it as the circumstances of\r\n\r\neach  particular case nay require, it seems  difficult\r\n\r\nto  explain.  Why  a fixed unvarying  rule  should  be\r\n\r\napplied  to  a  subject which admits of  such  endless\r\n\r\nvariety  as  the  credit  of witnesses,  seems  hardly\r\n\r\nreconcilable to the principles of reason. (But, that a\r\n\r\njudge  should  come prepared to reject altogether  the\r\n\r\ntestimony  of  a  competent  witness  as  unworthy  of\r\n\r\ncredit,  before he had even seen that witness;  before\r\n\r\nhe  had  observed his look, his manner, his demeanour;\r\n\r\nbefore  he  had  an  opportunity  of  considering  the\r\n\r\nconsistency  and probability of his story;  before  he\r\n\r\nhad  known the nature of the crime of which he was  to\r\n\r\naccuse himself, or the temptation which led to it,  or\r\n\r\nthe  contrition  with which it was followed;)  that  a\r\n\r\njudge,  I  say,  should  come prepared  beforehand  to\r\n\r\nadvise  the jury to reject without consideration  such\r\n\r\nevidence,  even  though  judge  and  jury  should   be\r\n\r\nperfectly  convinced  of its  truth,  seems  to  he  a\r\n\r\nviolation  of  the  principles of  common  sense,  the\r\n\r\ndictates  of morality, and the sanctity of  a  juror's\r\n\r\noath.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The view that the present requirement is wrong is\r\n\r\nalso  in  accordance  with the views  of  the  learned\r\n\r\nmembers of the Criminal Law Revision Committee of  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom  whose  Eleventh  Report  on  Evidence\r\n\r\n(General)   was   presented  to  the  United   Kingdom\r\n\r\nParliament in June 1972. It is felt `that it should be\r\n\r\na  matter for the judge's discretion whether or not to\r\n\r\nconvict   on   the  uncorroborated  evidence   of   an\r\n\r\naccomplice and as long as the judge recognises who are\r\n\r\nthe  accused's accomplices in the case before him  and\r\n\r\ntreats their evidence with caution there should be  no\r\n\r\ndanger of a miscarriage of justice. There appears also\r\n\r\nto be no real need for retaining the rule that certain\r\n\r\nwitnesses   are   incapable  of  corroborating   other\r\n\r\nwitnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 proposes that a previous statement made by a\r\n\r\nwitness  should be admissible not only to  support  or\r\n\r\nimpugn his credibility as a witness but as evidence of\r\n\r\nthe  fact  stated in it. The present  law  has  caused\r\n\r\ndifficulty when evidence is given that a witness  made\r\n\r\na previous statement inconsistent with his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevidence given in court. Evidence that the witness did\r\n\r\nso  is admissible but it is admissible not in order to\r\n\r\nprove  the  truth  of what was said  in  the  previous\r\n\r\nstatement but only in order to neutralise, the  effect\r\n\r\nof  the  evidence given in court by the maker  of  the\r\n\r\nstatement.   Many  regard  this  as   too   subtle   a\r\n\r\ndistinction.  Similarly, where a document  used  by  a\r\n\r\nwitness  to  refresh  his  memory  is  proved,  it  is\r\n\r\nproposed that the statement in that document shall  be\r\n\r\nadmissible as evidence of the facts stated in it.  The\r\n\r\nlaw  at present requires the witness who has refreshed\r\n\r\nhis  memory  to produce and show to the adverse  party\r\n\r\nthe document used by him to refresh his memory and  he\r\n\r\nmay be cross-examined on the contents of such document\r\n\r\nbut  the  document shall not be admissible as evidence\r\n\r\nof  the  facts  stated therein. The  above  proposals,\r\n\r\nhowever, are subject to certain safeguards for  it  is\r\n\r\nprovided in subsection (5) of section 145 in clause  9\r\n\r\nthat  in estimating the weight, if any, to be attached\r\n\r\nto  a  statement admissible under this clause,  regard\r\n\r\nshall  be  had  to  all  the  circumstances  and,   in\r\n\r\nparticular, to its contemporaneity or otherwise and to\r\n\r\nthe  question whether any person who was in a position\r\n\r\nto do so had any reason to conceal or misrepresent the\r\n\r\nfacts.   Subsection  (6)  proposes  that  a  statement\r\n\r\nadmissible  by  virtue of this  clause  shall  not  be\r\n\r\ncapable  of  corroborating the evidence given  by  the\r\n\r\nmaker of the statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill, it is the intention to refer this Bill to Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  where representations will be  welcome  and\r\n\r\nwill be given careful consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Kuo Chuan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these four Bills that we have before\r\n\r\nus in this House today relate to the administration of\r\n\r\ncriminal  justice \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin our courts. Whilst the provisions of   the   Criminal  Justice  (Temporary   Provisions) (Amendment)  Bill  do  not affect  the  substance  and character  of criminal trials, the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nCriminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill, the Evidence\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill  and  the  Criminal  Law  (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions) (Amendment) Bill do. They make substantial\r\n\r\nalterations,  among other changes, to the  law  as  it\r\n\r\nstands now relating to caution statements made to  the\r\n\r\npolice  by an accused person before he is interrogated\r\n\r\nby  the police, corroboration of the testimony  of  an\r\n\r\naccomplice,   confession,  and  they  also   introduce\r\n\r\nfurther refinements to the rule against hearsay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One's first instinctive reaction to the proposed\r\n\r\nchanges is one of suspicion born of the fact that this\r\n\r\nis an instance of an already powerful executive branch\r\n\r\nof  the  State seeking to increase its powers  in  its\r\n\r\ndealings  with the citizens. But a closer  reading  of\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of these Bills would show  that  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  removing  some of the fetters, presumptions  and\r\n\r\ninferences that hamper the prosecution in proving  its\r\n\r\ncase  against  an  accused person, they  also  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess    augmented    the   judicial    power    and\r\n\r\nresponsibility in ascertaining the truth or  otherwise\r\n\r\nof  evidence  sought  to  be  proved  in  court.  This\r\n\r\ntendency to grant greater judicial flexibility to  the\r\n\r\njudge is to be welcomed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law relating to caution statements made by the\r\n\r\naccused   to   the  police  and  to   the   need   for\r\n\r\ncorroboration of the evidence of an accomplice has  so\r\n\r\ngot  into  such  a  morass of  technicalities  that  a\r\n\r\ncaution  required  to  be  administered  by  a  police\r\n\r\nofficer   to   an   accused  person  before   he   was\r\n\r\ninterrogated  had become a piece of catechism  and  it\r\n\r\nfailed wholly to achieve the purpose that it was meant\r\n\r\nto   achieve.  The  voluntariness  of  the   accused's\r\n\r\nstatement  was  not  enhanced and  the  prevention  of\r\n\r\npolice brutality during interrogation of witnesses was\r\n\r\nnot thereby automatically guaranteed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know, Mr Speaker, Sir, that no crime would be\r\n\r\nsolved and no criminal brought to book on the basis of\r\n\r\npurely voluntary statements made by accused persons or\r\n\r\nwitnesses to the police over cups of tea. It is a hard\r\n\r\nfact  of  life  that due to the power  of  terror  and\r\n\r\nreprisal  wielded by the secret societies in Singapore\r\n\r\nno  witness to a violent crime would voluntarily  come\r\n\r\nforward  to give evidence against a miscreant.  It  is\r\n\r\nsmall  wonder that in approximately 70% of the  murder\r\n\r\ntrials,  convictions were obtained  on  the  basis  of\r\n\r\ncaution  statements  that were promptly  disavowed  in\r\n\r\ncourt  amidst  allegations of police  brutality.  This\r\n\r\nmust  mean  that despite such allegations  our  judges\r\n\r\nwere  satisfied that the offences against the  accused\r\n\r\nhad been proved probably true beyond reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In human affairs even when the subject of inquiry was\r\n\r\nsusceptible  of  legal  proof,  certainty  is  usually\r\n\r\nunattainable.  The substitute is probability  and  the\r\n\r\ntribunal of fact had to decide which case was probably\r\n\r\ntrue  and  in  a criminal trial probably  true  beyond\r\n\r\nreasonable doubt. I must also point out that the  laws\r\n\r\nrelating  to hearsay, corroboration and the  reception\r\n\r\nof  caution  statements were originally fashioned  and\r\n\r\nlaid down by the great judges of the common law in the\r\n\r\ncontext of jury trials when juries had at all times to\r\n\r\nbe  guided  by judges on how to decide fairly  without\r\n\r\ncaprice or prejudice. Now that we do not have juries a\r\n\r\ngreater  latitude should be left for the free exercise\r\n\r\nof  judicial reasoning and discretion and, insofar  as\r\n\r\nthis Bill achieves this; this House should welcome it,\r\n\r\nparticularly  so where over the years we have  enacted\r\n\r\nlaws that have in some measure taken away the business\r\n\r\nof  judging  questions  dealing  with  rights  of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  from the judiciary and placed  them  in  the\r\n\r\nhands of the executive. This is a derogation from  the\r\n\r\njudicial power under our Constitu-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntion  and  may  well be ultra vires  and  void.  This,\r\n\r\nhowever,  is  a different question and  I  shall  have\r\n\r\noccasion  to  expand  on  it  in  this  House  at  the\r\n\r\nappropriate time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if all of us do our work properly\r\n\r\nunder   these  Bills,  it  is  conceivable  that   the\r\n\r\nprovisions we seek to introduce today may work out  to\r\n\r\nbe  more humane to an accused person than it otherwise\r\n\r\nis today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I suppose the hon. Member for Kuo Chuan, who is\r\n\r\nwell-versed in law, is right in his pronouncement that\r\n\r\nunder  these Bills things may work out better than  it\r\n\r\nis  today. However, may I just have my own reservation\r\n\r\non at least one clause in this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the judicial practice now that at a trial\r\n\r\nit  is  obligatory for the court to warn itself  about\r\n\r\nconvicting an accused on the uncorroborated  testimony\r\n\r\nof  an  accomplice.  In  this Bill,  if  clause  8  is\r\n\r\naccepted,  then  it is obligatory  for  the  court  to\r\n\r\naccept  the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.\r\n\r\nAn  accomplice, to save his own skin,  will  give  all\r\n\r\nsorts   of  evidence  in  order  to  convict   others.\r\n\r\nAcceptance of this uncorroborated evidence is  a  move\r\n\r\nthat leaves much to be desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having lost faith in the investigative\r\n\r\ncapabilities of the police force, we now have to  rely\r\n\r\non the evidence of only collaborators and accomplices.\r\n\r\nIf I may say so, the Bill wants to take a short-cut to\r\n\r\njustice.  There  is no such thing as  a  short-cut  to\r\n\r\njustice.  The  way  to justice is always  a  long  and\r\n\r\nburdensome  one.  Does  this  mean  \"Prosecution  made\r\n\r\nEasy\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I do not propose to deal with the arguments here\r\n\r\nbut to leave them to the Select Committee.

Clause  8  says\r\n\r\nnothing of that kind. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`An accomplice shall be a competent witness against\r\n\r\nan  accused  person; and any rule of law  or  practice\r\n\r\nwhereby  at a trial it is obligatory for the court  to\r\n\r\nwarn  itself  about  convicting  the  accused  on  the\r\n\r\nuncorroborated  testimony of an accomplice  is  hereby\r\n\r\nabrogated.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What is abrogated is the requirement of a warning.
