If in a moment of heat\r\n\r\nI  said anything unseemly, I wish to apologise  to\r\n\r\nhon.  Members  and particularly to my  ministerial\r\n\r\ncolleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the adjournment yesterday, Mr Chairman, I was\r\n\r\nexplaining to hon. Members that I had been  trying\r\n\r\nas  much  as  possible  to reduce  expenditure  on\r\n\r\nmedical buildings without lowering standards,  and\r\n\r\nI  said  that  construction of  the  new  Training\r\n\r\nSchool, the Nurses Hostel and several clinics  and\r\n\r\noutdoor  dispensaries, which the former Government\r\n\r\nhad  estimated  to be built at $80,000  each,  had\r\n\r\ncost  $50,000  each, a saving of $30,000  each.  I\r\n\r\nhave nothing more to add to what I said yesterday,\r\n\r\nMr  Chairman, except this: that with the  sum  of\r\n\r\n$100,000,  the Government can build two more  such\r\n\r\nclinics  or outdoor dispensaries in such parts  of\r\n\r\nthe  island as may need them, and they would  give\r\n\r\nmuch  better service to the country than does  the\r\n\r\nFamily  Planning Association which, in my opinion,\r\n\r\nshould be a voluntary organisation and should  not\r\n\r\nbe subsidised by Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to draw hon. Members'\r\n\r\nattention  to Head 26, page 145, and see  some  of\r\n\r\nthe   other  charitable  grants  which  have  been\r\n\r\nprovided for in the Budget:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After-Care Association - only $10,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Sisters of the Poor (a most deserving\r\n\r\ncause) - only $4,800.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School for the Deaf (another very deserving\r\n\r\ncause) - only $6,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Youth Council - only $15,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to see all these grants increased\r\n\r\nrather  than to see $100,000 voted for the  Family\r\n\r\nPlanning Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I returned home last night, I received this\r\n\r\nso-called interesting pamphlet which was  sent  to\r\n\r\nme   by   the  members  of  the  Family   Planning\r\n\r\nAssociation and which was alluded to by the member\r\n\r\nfor Tanglin yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  the  Encyclical of Pope Pius XI  on  Christian\r\n\r\nMarriage His Holiness declared:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Any use whatsoever of matrimony exercised in\r\n\r\nsuch a way that the act is deliberately frustrated\r\n\r\nin  its  natural  power to  generate  life  is  an\r\n\r\noffence against the law of God and of nature,  and\r\n\r\nthose  who  indulge in such are branded  with  the\r\n\r\nguilt of a grave sin.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>If  hon.

Members, I have nothing\r\n\r\nfurther to add to what I have said except to  urge\r\n\r\nyou,  with  all  the force at my command,  not  to\r\n\r\nagree  that this colossal sum of $100,000 be given\r\n\r\nto   this  Association  when  that  money  can  be\r\n\r\nutilised for very much more useful purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.11 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in view of the\r\n\r\nnumber of Members who wish to speak on other items\r\n\r\nunder  this Head, I think it is important that  we\r\n\r\nshould  exercise  not  birth  control  but  speech\r\n\r\ncontrol, and I shall therefore make mine as  short\r\n\r\nas I can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two points to which I wish to\r\n\r\nrefer.  The first is a practical point of national\r\n\r\nimplication  in this amendment. The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth has conceded that the information given  by\r\n\r\nthe  Family  Planning Association can properly  be\r\n\r\ngiven  in Government clinics where it is required,\r\n\r\nand  it  seems clear to me that if we deprive  the\r\n\r\nAssociation  of financial support, it will  either\r\n\r\nhave  to reduce its work very considerably or will\r\n\r\nhave to wind itself up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere  will then be an increased burden thrown  on\r\n\r\nto  the public revenue by people having to  go  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government clinics for advice there,  and  we\r\n\r\nshall  merely  be transferring the load  from  the\r\n\r\nCharitable  Allowances  and  Grants  Head  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health Head. I have no doubt  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  transfer  the amount of money  involved  will\r\n\r\nvery  considerably increase, because you will have\r\n\r\nremoved  the  voluntary unpaid  element  which  at\r\n\r\npresent  is  very considerable. The  final  effect\r\n\r\nwill be a much heavier burden on the funds of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  Incidentally, that, of course,  disposes\r\n\r\nalso of the argument that Catholics should not  be\r\n\r\nforced  to  contribute  to family  planning  work,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  government funds  are  derived  from\r\n\r\nCatholics  as  well  as from others,  and  if  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health  is going  to  provide  these\r\n\r\nservices,  then  the  Catholics  must   still   be\r\n\r\ncontributing  in so far as they are good  citizens\r\n\r\nand pay their income tax and other taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other argument put up which I feel\r\n\r\ndeserves  a moment of time. It was suggested  that\r\n\r\nif  the Family Planning Association continued  its\r\n\r\nwork, we should suffer from a lack of manpower for\r\n\r\nour    Singapore    Battalion   and    pan-Malayan\r\n\r\ndevelopment  work.  This is a very  long-term  view\r\n\r\nindeed. During the immediate future, all you would\r\n\r\nget  would be an increase in baby-power, and I  do\r\n\r\nnot think baby-power is very significant either in\r\n\r\nsoldiering  or in working. If you take the  period\r\n\r\nfrom the time of conception to the time the living\r\n\r\nsoul  becomes  effective  from  a  working  or   a\r\n\r\nsoldiering point of view, say, 18 years, and  stop\r\n\r\nfamily  planning, it could not possibly  have  any\r\n\r\nsignificant  effect  until about  1975,  which  is\r\n\r\nindeed a long-term view. By 1975 some 400,000 boys\r\n\r\nand  girls now already alive, and many of them  in\r\n\r\nschool,  will  have been added  to  the  effective\r\n\r\nlabour  force.  I do not think we  need  fear  any\r\n\r\nabsence of manpower in those circumstances. It  is\r\n\r\na  most ill-conceived argument based, I am afraid,\r\n\r\non  a  complete failure to distinguish between  an\r\n\r\ninfant in arms and a worker at his lathe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Sir, I think we\r\n\r\nshould all look on this subject of family planning\r\n\r\nfrom  an objective viewpoint and we should not  be\r\n\r\ninfluenced  by our beliefs or outside forces.  The\r\n\r\nonly consideration that we should put before us is\r\n\r\nwhether  this expenditure of $100,000 will benefit\r\n\r\nSingapore or whether it will do us no good at all.\r\n\r\nTo  my  mind, we have the examples of China, India\r\n\r\nand  Japan  whose governments have adopted  family\r\n\r\nplanning and they do so not because they  want  it\r\n\r\nbut   because  of  necessity,  because  of   over-population  and  the  impossibility  to  food  and\r\n\r\nclothe  all  the  children  being  born  in  those\r\n\r\nterritories. These countries will not adopt family\r\n\r\nplanning unless it is vitally necessary and we  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are coming to that stage. We  have  now\r\n\r\nover  20,000  people unemployed and their  numbers\r\n\r\nare increasing, and this has been confirmed by the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Commerce and Industry.  On  top  of\r\n\r\nthat,  we  have those people who are  now  leaving\r\n\r\nschool  and  trying to find employment  and  their\r\n\r\nnumbers  will  be  increased.  I  can  assure  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  House  that  the  question   of\r\n\r\nunemployment is very serious. There can be no more\r\n\r\nrubber  packing  in Singapore because  it  is  not\r\n\r\neconomical to pack here due to the rise in  wages,\r\n\r\nand you have over a thousand people unemployed  on\r\n\r\nthat   account  alone.  In  my  opinion,   if   an\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of $100,000 can save  a  thousand  or\r\n\r\neven  a  few hundred people from the embarrassment\r\n\r\nand  worry of having to meet confinement  expenses\r\n\r\nand  the  support of a new mouth in the family,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the money is well spent. If we can  save  a\r\n\r\nfew  hundred women from the worry of an  unplanned\r\n\r\nconfinement  and going through the  sufferings  of\r\n\r\nill-health  and having to visit quack  doctors  in\r\n\r\norder  to obtain abortion, which may injure  their\r\n\r\nhealth  and  possibly cause their death,  then  we\r\n\r\nshall have spent this money well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask Members of this House to view\r\n\r\nthis  expenditure of $100,000 objectively, and  if\r\n\r\nwe  are  not influenced by our beliefs and outside\r\n\r\nforces, our common sense will tell us that  it  is\r\n\r\nmoney worth spending.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nChairman,   Sir,  I  also  will  exercise   speech\r\n\r\ncontrol.  I would just like to touch on one  angle\r\n\r\nof  this  debate. Last year several people outside\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly accused us of treating this  subject\r\n\r\nwith the utmost levity. Some of the remarks passed\r\n\r\nin   this  Committee  may  have  bordered  on  the\r\n\r\nsalacious, but much of what was said was said with\r\n\r\nconviction and sincerity. In any case, what is  so\r\n\r\nterrible  about  having a dig or  a  jest  at  the\r\n\r\nexpense  of family planning? The birth of a  human\r\n\r\nbeing  may  be the greatest of all mysteries,  but\r\n\r\nthere is no mystery about contraception, or should\r\n\r\nnot  be!  One  member said he was  surprised  that\r\n\r\nthere  should  be  joking  about  such  a  serious\r\n\r\nsubject. That seems to me to be bordering  on  the\r\n\r\nsanctimonious. We have had laughter in this House,\r\n\r\nSir,  on  many  occasions  and  sometimes  it  has\r\n\r\nrelieved  tension. At times it has taken place  in\r\n\r\ndiscussions far more serious than this one. My own\r\n\r\nview  is  that I refuse to regard the  subject  of\r\n\r\nfamily plan, fling as holy ground. I believe  that\r\n\r\nthe  Family  Planning Association  consists  of  a\r\n\r\ngroup  of  people  who are absolutely  sincere  in\r\n\r\ntheir    convictions   and   are   of   impeccable\r\n\r\nreputation. I think the work they are doing, which\r\n\r\nis   largely  voluntary,  is  in  the  very   best\r\n\r\ntradition  of voluntary workers in that  they  are\r\n\r\ndevoting their time to the relief of sufferers and\r\n\r\nto  the  poor. As such, I think they are deserving\r\n\r\nof government assistance. That I believe, Sir, and\r\n\r\nI  have  heard no argument so far which will  ever\r\n\r\nshake that belief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nChairman, Sir, someone has said that speech,  like\r\n\r\npregnancy,  is  easy  to  conceive  but  hard   to\r\n\r\ndeliver.   That  is  why  there  have  been   some\r\n\r\nunplanned   speeches   and   certain   ill-advised\r\n\r\ndeliveries!   Sir,  last  year  the  subject   was\r\n\r\nthoroughly debated and this year I find that  most\r\n\r\nof  the speakers who took part in the debate  last\r\n\r\nyear   find   it   unnecessary   to   repeat   the\r\n\r\nperformance. But I do see, Sir, that the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Health still maintains that planned parenthood\r\n\r\nis  unhealthy. I am very happy, too, to  see  that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Communications and Works,  while\r\n\r\nnot maintaining that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere should be more communications and less work,\r\n\r\nstill makes out a case for planned parenthood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have asked for the figures since 1950 of\r\n\r\nthe  amounts  of  contribution or grants  to  this\r\n\r\nAssociation. It began in 1950 with $5,000  and  it\r\n\r\nkept  on mounting up - 1951, $10,000; 1952, $20,000; 1953, $30,000; 1954, $45,000; 1955, $60,000; 1956, $85,000; and next year, $100,000. Every year  when\r\n\r\nthis vote was being debated in the Assembly, there\r\n\r\nhad  been  opposition. It would appear, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nopposition  to  the  Family  Planning  Association\r\n\r\nmakes it more thriving and makes it more worthy of\r\n\r\nsupport. We are proposing to increase the grant by\r\n\r\n$15,000  in 1957, and in 1958, with the record  of\r\n\r\nservice  that they have rendered to the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I  should  not  be  surprised  if  the\r\n\r\n$100,000 is exceeded. Sir, the F.P.A. is rendering\r\n\r\na  service  which  my Ministry,  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Welfare, while looking  after  labour\r\n\r\nstill  has  to  look after its welfare,  maintains\r\n\r\nthat it is a sum worth spending.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, yesterday I\r\n\r\nsaid  that this was an unfortunate and unnecessary\r\n\r\namendment.

The subject\r\n\r\nseems  to  exacerbate  feelings  deeply  held  and\r\n\r\nproduces  an  emotional  incapacity  for   logical\r\n\r\nthought   and   an  excitement  as  indicated   in\r\n\r\nyesterday's  wild attack on me personally  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as for the lack of logic in the approach, I\r\n\r\nwould  draw  your  attention to the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth's  statement  made  proudly  that   he   is\r\n\r\nbuilding  several maternity clinics and hospitals,\r\n\r\nand  in those maternity clinics and hospitals  for\r\n\r\nwhich  we obtain money from the public by  tax  in\r\n\r\norder  to support them, family planning advice  is\r\n\r\ngiven.

Is it not good\r\n\r\nthat  there are people who do come forward to give\r\n\r\nnot  merely money but of their time to  serve  the\r\n\r\npeople? Let us remember that the $100,000 is but a\r\n\r\npart   of   the  budget  of  the  Family  Planning\r\n\r\nAssociation  and  that the  persons  to  whom  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Changi has referred do, in fact,  give\r\n\r\ntheir voluntary donations to the extent that  they\r\n\r\ncan,  but  they  do appeal to the public  and  the\r\n\r\npublic   does   support   this   Family   Planning\r\n\r\nAssociation.

We are most appreciative of the work  done\r\n\r\nby  these  energetic and devoted  ladies  for  the\r\n\r\nFamily   Planning  Association.  I  am   wondering\r\n\r\nwhether they cannot take another step forward  and\r\n\r\nalso  direct  their attention to  the  Blue  Cross\r\n\r\nCharitable Institution which is run on a voluntary\r\n\r\nbasis.

So I wish the office bearers of\r\n\r\nthe  Family  Planning  Association  would  try  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  my point of view and give  it  careful\r\n\r\nconsideration if they wish to run the  Association\r\n\r\non a voluntary basis.

It  should\r\n\r\nnot be the responsibility of a private association\r\n\r\nto  provide road signs. I am told that  such  road\r\n\r\nsigns  are  put  up  for the  purpose  of  guiding\r\n\r\nmotorists to different places of interest.  It  is\r\n\r\nmore  or  less in the nature of tourist propaganda\r\n\r\nand  it should therefore be the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nthe Government and not of private association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Automobile Association of Singapore is\r\n\r\nmaintained  by  the members. I am  myself  a  life\r\n\r\nmember  of the Association and, as such, I  should\r\n\r\nhave  been  very  happy to see  that  a  grant  is\r\n\r\nprovided  for  it. But it is a principle  that  is\r\n\r\ninvolved, Sir. It is not the question of  a  grant\r\n\r\nthat  is coming to my Association. I am very  much\r\n\r\nagainst  the  principle of granting money  out  of\r\n\r\npublic  funds  to  a private association.  As  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health has indicated in his speech on\r\n\r\nfamily  planning, it is the policy  of  the  money\r\n\r\nthat  is  involved. I hope that Treasury  sanction\r\n\r\nwill  not be given and I trust that the House will\r\n\r\nsupport my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The explanation is very simple, Mr\r\n\r\nChairman,  Sir. If the hon. Member  will  look  at\r\n\r\npage  418  of the Estimates, he will see a  rather\r\n\r\nfuller explanation of what it is proposed that the\r\n\r\nAssociation  should  do. A  distinction  is  drawn\r\n\r\nbetween  the signs which give orders, say,  \"Stop\"\r\n\r\nor \"Keep left\" - which are definite orders - and those\r\n\r\nwhich  give  useful information such as  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  there  is a narrow bridge ahead or  you  are\r\n\r\ncoming to a double bend and that kind of thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grant in this case is a dollar-for-dollar\r\n\r\ngrant  and,  in  fact, if the Association  is  not\r\n\r\ngiven the grant and it does not put the signs  up,\r\n\r\nthen  the  burden  will  be  transferred  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. The advocates of less taxation,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure, will support this grant which will cost only\r\n\r\n$5,000 from the public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunds,  whereas if the Association is not  allowed\r\n\r\nto co-operate with the Government, then presumably\r\n\r\nthe  whole  amount will have to be paid  from  the\r\n\r\npublic  funds, or will not be provided, with  less\r\n\r\nimprovement consequently in the traffic situation.\r\n\r\nThere   is   undoubtedly  very  great   need   for\r\n\r\nimprovements of all sorts in the safety and  rapid\r\n\r\nflow  of  traffic in Singapore, and anything  that\r\n\r\ncan  be  done  should be done. If  the  Government\r\n\r\norganisation has to be extended to deal with these\r\n\r\nthings  that  will, of course,  involve  not  only\r\n\r\nexpenditure on signs but expenditure on additional\r\n\r\nofficials to go round and see where the signs  are\r\n\r\nto be put up. There is very often a real saving to\r\n\r\nbe  achieved by using a voluntary organisation  to\r\n\r\ndo  work  which the Government could do but  which\r\n\r\nwould  be  costly  and elaborate and  which  would\r\n\r\nperhaps  be slower because everything  has  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough the government machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should add perhaps that the Traffic Branch of\r\n\r\nthe  Police, who, after all, are experts  on  this\r\n\r\nproblem, strongly support this vote, and that  the\r\n\r\nsigns   to   be   erected  will  be   erected   in\r\n\r\nconsultation with the Traffic Branch  both  as  to\r\n\r\ntypes  and  location.  I hope  my  explanation  is\r\n\r\nsufficient, Sir, for us to pass on to other items.\r\n\r\nIt  is, in fact, a saving of money and probably an\r\n\r\nincrease in efficiency will be derived from making\r\n\r\nthis  grant to a voluntary organisation which  can\r\n\r\ndo useful work in the public service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, it is really\r\n\r\nsurprising   to   hear  from  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nCommunications  and Works that if the  road  signs\r\n\r\nwere   to   become  the  responsibility   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the  expenditure  involved  would  be\r\n\r\nmore.  There was the opinion frequently  expressed\r\n\r\nyesterday  that  broadcasting  should  come  under\r\n\r\nprivate   enterprise.   Is   it   the   Minister's\r\n\r\ncontention  that  whatever is  undertaken  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  cost far  more  than  if  it  is\r\n\r\nundertaken by private enterprise? If that is so, I\r\n\r\nam very much surprised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of road signs, Sir, I am fully\r\n\r\naware, as I have indicated in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy  speech,  that it is not a question  of  \"Stop,\r\n\r\nlook,  go\",  but it is a question of  \"Major  road\r\n\r\nahead\"  or  \"Sharp  bend\"  as  indicated  by   the\r\n\r\nMinister. All the way up to the Federation, Sir, I\r\n\r\ndo  find such signs and it is my opinion that they\r\n\r\nshould  be provided by the Government rather  than\r\n\r\nby  a  private  organisation, if  the  Automobile\r\n\r\nAssociation  of  Singapore  is  trying   to   help\r\n\r\nmotorists,  it should apply for a grant  from  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth Headquarters Association to which  it\r\n\r\nis affiliated, rather than from the Assembly. I do\r\n\r\nnot  think it is right for the Government to grant\r\n\r\na  dollar for a dollar, a dollar for a dollar,  to\r\n\r\nall  kinds of organisation. I shall be coming back\r\n\r\nto  this dollar for dollar basis on another  issue\r\n\r\nat  a later stage. I think this is entirely wrong.\r\n\r\nAs  the  Member for Changi has indicated  earlier,\r\n\r\nbecause the Blue Cross is doing charitable work in\r\n\r\nplace  of the Government, and if that organisation\r\n\r\nis  going to apply for a dollar for dollar  grant,\r\n\r\nthen  the  Government  will  be  committed  to   a\r\n\r\ncolossal sum of money. As it stands today, Sir, we\r\n\r\nare  committed  to  $1,078,520  just  for  charity\r\n\r\nalone, and if more associations come to Government\r\n\r\nfor  dollar for dollar grants, where will it land?\r\n\r\nWe  are faced with a deficit of $36 million,  Sir,\r\n\r\nand  out  of  that  the Member for  Cairnhill  has\r\n\r\nindicated  that  $14 million  or  $15  million  is\r\n\r\nprovided  for  four  minesweepers.  Out  of   that\r\n\r\ncharity,  another $16 million to $20  million  may\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  provided in time to come.  Can  this\r\n\r\nGovernment afford that, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> if it please you, Sir, I must\r\n\r\nconfess  that I fail to understand the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown.   Surely   he  does   not   discourage\r\n\r\nvoluntary  organisations of  citizens  seeking  to\r\n\r\nserve  their fellow citizens? This is a  voluntary\r\n\r\norganisation. It is recognised that  it  is  doing\r\n\r\nvery  useful  work. It is recognised that  it  has\r\n\r\ninadequate  funds to do this work competently  and\r\n\r\nfully  unless  it receives assistance.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nrather than take over the work which would deprive\r\n\r\ncitizens  of,  for one thing, the  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nserve the country and which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould   also  increase  the  cost  to  Government,\r\n\r\nGovernment has very wisely said, \"We will give you\r\n\r\nhalf  of  what  it  costs for a  service  that  is\r\n\r\nessential  to the country.\" If the hon.

It is  no\r\n\r\nuse  giving  a  little. You  cannot  get  much  in\r\n\r\nreturn;  but if you give adequately, then you  can\r\n\r\nassist   the  voluntary  organisations  to  better\r\n\r\nefforts and to far greater returns than the outlay\r\n\r\nwhich is indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government should not, as a matter of principle,\r\n\r\ntake  over all charitable organisations. Voluntary\r\n\r\ncharitable organisations are a very valuable asset\r\n\r\nto the people of the country and to those who have\r\n\r\nan  opportunity to serve. For myself, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  say  this:  I will  never  be  chary  in\r\n\r\nsupporting Government in all legitimate  measures,\r\n\r\neven   generous  measures,  to  assist  charitable\r\n\r\norganisations to discharge the functions they seek\r\n\r\nto discharge to the maximum possible efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nclaims  to  be a business man, and I am unable  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  why  he cannot see the mathematics  of\r\n\r\nthis  case.

Sir, I am fully aware\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the activities of this Association in providing\r\n\r\nall  sorts of amenities for young girls and  women\r\n\r\nand  I think it is doing a very good job. But what\r\n\r\nI  am  concerned with, as I have said earlier,  is\r\n\r\nthe  principle  of voting such a  grant.  It  will\r\n\r\ncreate  a  precedent if we are to grant  money  to\r\n\r\norganisations year after year. There are two other\r\n\r\norganisations with similar objects, and there  may\r\n\r\nbe  more.  These two organisations are, if  I  may\r\n\r\nquote, the Y.M.C.A. and the Chinese Y.M.C.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my memory is correct, Sir, in 1953 the Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Department intended to rebuild the  Prince\r\n\r\nEdward  Hostel at Prince Edward Road. Subsequently\r\n\r\nthey  came  to  know  that  the  Chinese  Y.M.C.A.\r\n\r\nintended  to put up a building there. In order  to\r\n\r\nsave  Government expenditure, the Director of  the\r\n\r\nSocial    Welfare   Department,   Mr    Cromwell,\r\n\r\nnegotiated  with  the  officials  of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nY.M.C.A. and offered a grant of $150,000  to  this\r\n\r\nAssociation in putting up that building - but on one\r\n\r\ncondition. That condition was that a part  of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding should be allotted to the hostel so  that\r\n\r\nthe  boys  from  the  existing  hostel  could   be\r\n\r\ntransferred  to  that  building.  It   is   rather\r\n\r\nsurprising,  Sir, that when the vote came  up,  it\r\n\r\nwas  turned  down. Sir, when a grant of  $150,000,\r\n\r\nwhich  was  negotiated  by  an  official  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment with an organisation with similar  aims\r\n\r\nwas turned down by the Government, why then should\r\n\r\nwe  now  approve  a grant of $125,000  to  another\r\n\r\norganisation with similar aims?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> It is not the same government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I see! It is clear now! I\r\n\r\nthink  that was the reason why it was turned down!\r\n\r\nThen  it was a colonial government, but now it  is\r\n\r\nthe Labour Front Coalition Government! But what  I\r\n\r\nfeel  is  this, Sir: there seems to be  a  bit  of\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  when giving grants  to  charitable\r\n\r\norganisations. From the list of charitable  grants\r\n\r\nI  see  that the Girl Guides Movement is  given  a\r\n\r\ngrant;  the Girls' Life Brigade is given a  grant;\r\n\r\nthe Boy Scouts' Association is given a grant. But,\r\n\r\nSir,  there is a youth movement in Singapore which\r\n\r\nis doing just\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  good service as all these movements, and  that\r\n\r\nis  the  Boys'  Brigade  Battalion.  I  am  really\r\n\r\nsurprised  that I do not find this movement  being\r\n\r\ngiven   a  grant.  I  think  the  Government   has\r\n\r\ndiscriminated when giving grants this time  and  I\r\n\r\nhope that when the question of giving grants comes\r\n\r\nup  again next time, the Government will not  show\r\n\r\nany  discrimination which casts  a  reflection  on\r\n\r\nsome other organisations.

Sir,  since\r\n\r\nSingapore has so many religions and so many races,\r\n\r\nwhy  do  we not declare it to be a secular  State?\r\n\r\nPossibly  a  Muslim State, because  Singapore  was\r\n\r\noriginally  a  Muslim village? Possibly  is  it  a\r\n\r\nCommunist State, because Singapore has no official\r\n\r\nreligion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been supporting the Young Women's\r\n\r\nChristian Association for 35 years. It  is  on  my\r\n\r\ndonation  list yearly and I will go on  supporting\r\n\r\nit.  Sir,  this world-wide organisation  is  doing\r\n\r\nwonderful  work,  but if such  an  association  is\r\n\r\ngiven  a  grant on a dollar for dollar  basis  for\r\n\r\nbuilding  work, then I do not see any  reason  why\r\n\r\nother  associations with similar aims  should  not\r\n\r\nalso be given grants. For example, the Ramakrishna\r\n\r\nMission  is also doing wonderful work irrespective\r\n\r\nof  caste  or creed but it has not been  given  a\r\n\r\ngrant. The Young Men's Muslim Association has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  given a grant. The Muslim Missionary Society\r\n\r\nhas  been  given no grant. Sir, has the Government\r\n\r\ndecided to give a grant to all these organisations\r\n\r\nwhich are doing wonderful work for the welfare  of\r\n\r\nthe public?

Sir,  the  Y.W.C.A.\r\n\r\nhas,  through  the generosity of  the  Government,\r\n\r\nreceived  land  totalling 66,000  square  feet  in\r\n\r\nOutram  Road. They have enough money to build  one\r\n\r\nwing and they need more money to complete it.  The\r\n\r\nmain  purpose  of  that  building,  Sir,  is   the\r\n\r\neducation  and  provision of training  classes  in\r\n\r\nsewing,  cooking, laundry work and crafts  of  all\r\n\r\nkinds for women of all races. It is not a question\r\n\r\nof accommodation for a particular Christian group.\r\n\r\nThe  work which they do is wholly irrespective  of\r\n\r\nthe  religions of the persons they seek to assist,\r\n\r\nand   surely  we  would  wish  to  support   whole\r\n\r\nheartedly  the  efforts of  this  organisation  in\r\n\r\ngiving   provision   for   simple   education   in\r\n\r\nworthwhile  crafts to the poorer sections  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation.  I feel sure, Sir, that if  the  House\r\n\r\nknew  fully the facts of the case, there would  be\r\n\r\nno  question  of any criticism of this  worthwhile\r\n\r\ngrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, perhaps I might elaborate on\r\n\r\nwhat  has  been said by the Member for  Cairnhill.\r\n\r\nThe  Y.W.C.A, since 1933 has been running  evening\r\n\r\nschools  for under-privileged girls,  and  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  there  are  600 of these  girls  attending\r\n\r\nclasses in three centres - one at the Havelock  Road\r\n\r\nChildren   Centre;  one  at  the  Prinsep   Street\r\n\r\nChildren  Centre; and one at the  Cantonment  Road\r\n\r\nSchool.

In other words, during  the  last\r\n\r\ntwo years the Income Tax Department has been doing\r\n\r\na particularly good job in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Sir, I will approach the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya to see whether  they  would\r\n\r\njoin  with  us  in taking some action  to  prevent\r\n\r\npeople  fleeing  the country without  paying  tax.\r\n\r\nWhether  or  not  I will be successful  in  my  approach, I cannot say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid, Sir, I cannot accept the criticisms\r\n\r\nwhich   have  been  levelled  at  the  Income   Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment.  On  the  contrary,  I  consider   the\r\n\r\nDepartment has done and is doing a splendid job in\r\n\r\nthe  face  of  many difficulties.  In  considering\r\n\r\nincome  tax  in Malaya, one has to remember  that,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  the Income Tax Department has only  been\r\n\r\nin  existence since 1948. There is a  tendency  to\r\n\r\ncompare  the Income Tax Department with the  Board\r\n\r\nof Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom (which, to\r\n\r\nthe  best  of my knowledge, has been in  existence\r\n\r\nfor  over  a  hundred years)  in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\nsuccess or otherwise that has been achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Income Tax Department has been in\r\n\r\nexistence for only eight years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Income Tax Department was\r\n\r\nestablished  in  the  face  of  the  most   bitter\r\n\r\nopposition  front all sections of  the  community,\r\n\r\nand  antagonism has coloured the approach  of  all\r\n\r\nsections of the community towards the work done by\r\n\r\nthe  Department  and the results achieved  by  the\r\n\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it had to start completely from scratch\r\n\r\nwith  only  a  very  few  officers  who  had   any\r\n\r\nknowledge  whatsoever of income  tax  law  or  the\r\n\r\ncollection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  income  tax, and staff, of course, had  to  be\r\n\r\nrecruited   and   trained  for  the   purpose   of\r\n\r\ncollection of tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, as a result of delay in bringing the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  into force, the Department started  off\r\n\r\nwith  a legacy of one year's income tax assessment\r\n\r\nin arrears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, it had to build up from scratch the\r\n\r\nsources of information without which no Income Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment can function efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, whenever it has wanted to take some new\r\n\r\naction  which  might  lead  to  a  more  efficient\r\n\r\ncollection of tax and detection of evasion, it has\r\n\r\nmet  with  a storm of protest and, on the majority\r\n\r\nof occasions, has eventually been hamstrung by the\r\n\r\nreactions of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, ever since it started, it has suffered\r\n\r\nfrom a chronic shortage of staff which has not yet\r\n\r\nbeen  overcome. We have had to go to every country\r\n\r\nin  the  world, to obtain recruits for the  Income\r\n\r\nTax Department and, as I see it in the future,  we\r\n\r\nwill  still  have to go to every  country  in  the\r\n\r\nworld to obtain recruits for the Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, Sir, far from being\r\n\r\ninefficient,  I think the Department  has  done  a\r\n\r\nremarkably  good job. In the years since  it  came\r\n\r\ninto  operation, it has, in fact,  collected  $459\r\n\r\nmillion for Singapore. That was a considerable sum\r\n\r\nand   a  very  significant  contribution  to   the\r\n\r\nrevenues of the country. This does not mean,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the  efficiency of the Department cannot  be\r\n\r\nimproved. It can be improved and is being improved\r\n\r\nas  more  staff become qualified by experience  to\r\n\r\nfill the higher jobs and as their places are taken\r\n\r\nby promising new recruits. Efficiency is largely a\r\n\r\nmatter of having an adequate supply of experienced\r\n\r\nstaff.  As  I  have said, this staff is  extremely\r\n\r\ndifficult  to obtain. There is a chronic  shortage\r\n\r\nof  good income tax officers throughout the world.\r\n\r\nIn  our  efforts  to train officers  to  the  high\r\n\r\nstandard of knowledge and experience necessary  to\r\n\r\nhold  their  own with professional men  with  whom\r\n\r\nthey  have to deal, we have been trying to  obtain\r\n\r\nthe  services  of a training officer.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nhighly specialised job and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood  officers are few and far between and are  in\r\n\r\ngreat  demand.  Our  efforts  have  so  far   been\r\n\r\nunsuccessful, but I am happy to say that  we  have\r\n\r\nmanaged  to arrange for a highly qualified  member\r\n\r\nof   the  Comptroller-General's  Office  in  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur to undertake the job until we can obtain  a\r\n\r\ntraining officer of our own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hears from time to time that the Department\r\n\r\nis  not  aware  of  many  taxpayers  who  are  not\r\n\r\nenmeshed  in  its  net. I doubt this  myself.  The\r\n\r\nDepartment's information branch taps  a  multitude\r\n\r\nof sources which are unknown to the general public\r\n\r\nin  order  to  bring  all  taxpayers  to  account.\r\n\r\nRecently,  in connection with the suggestion  that\r\n\r\nmany  people were evading tax, the Department made\r\n\r\na  street  survey  of selected business  areas  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  idea was to  test  the  truth  or\r\n\r\notherwise  of  the  suggestion  that  many   small\r\n\r\nbusiness men were escaping. The results confirmed\r\n\r\nthe belief of the Comptroller that he had most  of\r\n\r\nthe potential taxpayers on his books. Very few new\r\n\r\ntaxpayers were found in these busy areas and  only\r\n\r\na few appeared to be paying less than they should.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, some evasion of tax. That  is\r\n\r\ninevitable. Even in Britain where, as I have said,\r\n\r\nincome tax collection has been in force for over a\r\n\r\nhundred  years, there is evasion, sometimes  on  a\r\n\r\nvery   substantial  scale.  But  I  doubt  whether\r\n\r\nevasion here is as bad as many people suggest.  In\r\n\r\nany case, we now have an investigation team going.\r\n\r\nIt  will be strengthened and, as I said the  other\r\n\r\nday,  it has over the past three years managed  to\r\n\r\nbring  in  $5  million worth of  tax  which  would\r\n\r\notherwise have been lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.31 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nChairman,  Sir,  I  would like  to  speak  on  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  policy of income tax and I wish  to  draw\r\n\r\nthe  attention of the Government to a few  of  the\r\n\r\ncomplaints  generally voiced by the taxpayers.  In\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  a  single man, the  tax  relief  is\r\n\r\n$3,000,  and  this is the same in the  case  of  a\r\n\r\nsingle woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, when a man gets married, it seems that the\r\n\r\nincome   tax  law  operate  to  his  disadvantage,\r\n\r\nbecause he is made to pay not on the amount of the\r\n\r\nincome  that he has earned after his marriage  but\r\n\r\non the total income of his wife and himself on the\r\n\r\nyear  before  they were married. I would  ask  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to look into this matter and  see  that\r\n\r\nno  undue  hardship is inflicted on newly  married\r\n\r\ncouples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of relief, Sir, I know that in\r\n\r\nEngland widowed mothers and unemployed parents are\r\n\r\ngiven  relief. I know that the relief  amounts  to\r\n\r\nslightly  over $500. In Singapore we do  not  have\r\n\r\nthis in operation. We in Singapore always say that\r\n\r\nwe  copy whatever is good in England, but this  is\r\n\r\nan  instance where it is practised in England  and\r\n\r\nnot  practised in Singapore. I have  said  before\r\n\r\nthat the people here support their parents and, in\r\n\r\ndoing  so,  make their parents less of a liability\r\n\r\non  the  social welfare institutions. If they  can\r\n\r\nhelp  Government in such a manner, I think  it  is\r\n\r\nonly  fair  that they should be given relief  when\r\n\r\nthey  are  supporting their parents  who  are  not\r\n\r\ngainfully  employed. I would  like  Government  to\r\n\r\ngive  this  point  serious consideration  and,  if\r\n\r\npossible,  introduce a Bill before  this  Assembly\r\n\r\ngiving  this  sort  of benefit to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to support the proposal put forward  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Serangoon to increase the tax  relief\r\n\r\nallowance  in  order  to make  provision  for  the\r\n\r\nparents.  Sir, in oriental tradition, the  parents\r\n\r\nhold  an important status in the family. They  are\r\n\r\nmore important than the wife and the children. But\r\n\r\nthe  existing  income tax law makes provision  for\r\n\r\nthe  wife and children and leaves out the parents.\r\n\r\nWe  in  Singapore  are marching towards  political\r\n\r\nindependence, but at the same time I  should  like\r\n\r\nto  urge  the  people  to  fight  for  ideological\r\n\r\nindependence.  It  is high time  for  the  elected\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  give  a  lead  to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and prove that it is different from  the\r\n\r\nprevious colonial Government, and one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwise  step in this direction is to amend he Income\r\n\r\nTax  Ordinance by including parents in the  relief\r\n\r\nallowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.36 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir,\r\n\r\nspeaking in support of the last two speakers, I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think it is necessary for me to elaborate  on\r\n\r\nthis  issue. Much has been said that the  personal\r\n\r\nrelief  allowance should include the parents.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill, speaking on  this  subject\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Income Tax Bill was debated,  indicated\r\n\r\nthat  the Labour Front Government was fully  aware\r\n\r\nof  the Asian way of life and had taken this  fact\r\n\r\ninto  consideration; but it is a  surprise  to  me\r\n\r\nthat  after  18 months in office the Labour  Front\r\n\r\nGovernment has never thought fit to legislate  for\r\n\r\npersonal relief to be given to parents. As I  have\r\n\r\nsaid  again  and again, the parents take  priority\r\n\r\nover  the  wife and children. Without our parents,\r\n\r\nwe   would  never  exist.  Since  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  has  indicated that  the  Labour  Front\r\n\r\nGovernment is fully aware of this fact, I do  hope\r\n\r\nthat within a matter of two or three months a Bill\r\n\r\nwill   be   introduced  into  this  House   making\r\n\r\nprovision for personal relief also to be given  to\r\n\r\nparents rather than to the wife and children only,\r\n\r\nand  I  am  sure that this Bill will  receive  the\r\n\r\napproval  of every Member here except, maybe,  the\r\n\r\nexpatriates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bachelor earning $3,000 a year may have to\r\n\r\nsupport  his  parents  and possibly  five  younger\r\n\r\nbrothers  and  sisters,  and  to  grant   him   an\r\n\r\nallowance of $3,000 only - which is $250 a month - is\r\n\r\nto make it impossible for him to maintain that big\r\n\r\nfamily  which,  according  to  Western  eyes,   is\r\n\r\nactually  not  his family. That  is  his  father's\r\n\r\nfamily.  The  younger brothers and sisters  solely\r\n\r\ndepend  on the wage-earning member of the  family,\r\n\r\nirrespective of whether or not he is  married.  If\r\n\r\nthe  wage-earning  member  is  married,  then,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  his burden would be far heavier  because,\r\n\r\nin  addition  to his own family, he will  have  to\r\n\r\nsupport  his parents and his younger brothers  and\r\n\r\nsisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A personal relief allowance of $5,000 is given to\r\n\r\na  family man. That $5,000 works out at about $416\r\n\r\na month.

Now, with\r\n\r\nthis $416 to maintain a wife without children  but\r\n\r\nwith  the  parents and a few younger brothers  and\r\n\r\nsisters  depending  on him, I doubt  whether  this\r\n\r\namount is sufficient with the present high cost of\r\n\r\nliving.

In  every country in the world, it  is  the\r\n\r\nprivilege  of sons and daughters to support  their\r\n\r\naged  parents, and that is done in countries  like\r\n\r\nGreat  Britain  and  other  continental  countries\r\n\r\nwhere  the  rates of personal allowance  are  very\r\n\r\nmuch lower than they are here in Singapore. In any\r\n\r\ncase, it would seem that the families in Singapore\r\n\r\nappear to be rather larger than in other countries\r\n\r\nof the world and no doubt the burden of supporting\r\n\r\nparents is cast over a very much wider field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of allowances, having regard to\r\n\r\nthe amount of the personal allowances which are in\r\n\r\nexistence  at  the  moment,  I  can  hold  out  no\r\n\r\nprospect whatsoever of being able to add to  them.\r\n\r\nOur  need for revenue is such that if there is  to\r\n\r\nbe  any change in the allowances in the future, it\r\n\r\nmust inevitably be to reduce them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon, it is a fundamental principle of income\r\n\r\ntax  policy throughout the world that the  incomes\r\n\r\nof  husband and wife should be lumped together for\r\n\r\nthe purposes of assessment of tax\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile I have a certain amount of sympathy for him\r\n\r\non the point which he raised, I can offer no\r\n\r\nprospect whatsoever of being able to meet it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $2,018,970 for Head 30 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSITTING NO:      13\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 31-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the sum of $388,420 for Head 31 stand part\r\n\r\nof the Schedule.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir, I\r\n\r\nshould  like some points to be clarified.

This is the  Ministry\r\n\r\nthat  is  either  going to bring us  a  prosperous\r\n\r\nSingapore  or a Singapore that is poor and  unable\r\n\r\nto hold its own against other territories. For the\r\n\r\nlast few months there has always been a thought in\r\n\r\nmy  mind that the future of Singapore is going  to\r\n\r\nbe  bleak. The future of Singapore is not going to\r\n\r\nbe as rosy as we all like it to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous to this, Sir, Singapore enjoyed the\r\n\r\nstatus of a big entrepot. It supplied the needs of\r\n\r\nIndonesia,   Siam,   Indo-China,   Hongkong,   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya and Burma. This was  in  the\r\n\r\ndays  when  most  of  these territories,  such  as\r\n\r\nBurma, Indonesia and French Indo-China, were still\r\n\r\ncolonies. The position today, however, has changed\r\n\r\nand  now  we  have the independent territories  of\r\n\r\nBurma,  Vietnam,  Vietminh, Indonesia,  India  and\r\n\r\nCeylon, and  by  next year we will  have  another\r\n\r\nindependent  country coming up, and that  will  be\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya. It is a fact, Sir, that\r\n\r\nas soon as a country attains independence, it will\r\n\r\ntry its very best to do what it thinks is best for\r\n\r\nitself. We find today that Indonesia is trying  to\r\n\r\ntrade  directly with the West. Indonesia is trying\r\n\r\nto  replace Singapore with Djakarta. In  the  same\r\n\r\nway, we find our nearest neighbour, the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya, imposing tariffs on all goods imported\r\n\r\ninto it.

Sir,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  wholeheartedly in the principle of  equal\r\n\r\njustice   for   all  races.  In  this   particular\r\n\r\ninstance, I would draw attention to the fact  that\r\n\r\nthe Malay educational policy of the past was of  a\r\n\r\ncharacter  which  had  checked  them  and  acutely\r\n\r\ndepressed part of the population economically, and\r\n\r\nthey  do  need  special  assistance  in  order  to\r\n\r\nintegrate them into modern economic life.  I  know\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry of Commerce and  Industry  has\r\n\r\nbeen   keenly   interested  in  the  question   of\r\n\r\neducation in methods of fishery, and there  was  a\r\n\r\nscheme, Sir, early this year of whose fate I  have\r\n\r\nlearnt nothing more; but apart from that, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  know  if  there is in  contemplation  an\r\n\r\norganisation  to  assist in their  integration  in\r\n\r\ncommerce and industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.55 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, we are\r\n\r\nnow  discussing the Head \"Ministry of Commerce and\r\n\r\nIndustry\".   Sir,   we   have   acknowledged   the\r\n\r\nimportance of Singapore as a commercial port. This\r\n\r\nMinistry is therefore most important. Despite  the\r\n\r\nintegrity  and  sincerity  of  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nCommerce  and  Industry in trying to  promote  and\r\n\r\nencourage  more  trade and industry,  let  us  ask\r\n\r\nourselves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether  anything has been done in this direction.\r\n\r\nFor  myself,  I say \"No\". In fact, we are  sliding\r\n\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon has mentioned that South-East Asia has entirely changed; so many\r\n\r\nindependent   countries  have   been   born.   The\r\n\r\ncountries  surrounding Singapore  have  had  their\r\n\r\nformer  colonial economic system  changed  into  a\r\n\r\nnationalist  economic system. Singapore  today  is\r\n\r\nvery  much  less important than it was before.  We\r\n\r\nare facing a critical position. The Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya is going to achieve merdeka very soon. Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  is  one thing which I regret.  Despite  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  we  have many pan-Malayan departments,\r\n\r\nthe  two  Governments have never yet come together\r\n\r\nto  consider  whether or not to have  pan-Malayan\r\n\r\neconomic   development.  The  new  import   duties\r\n\r\nimposed by the Federation of Malaya are not only a\r\n\r\nserious  setback to our local industries,  but  it\r\n\r\nmight  well  be  the end of our local  industries.\r\n\r\nBased  on  these facts, therefore, I do not  think\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  is  entitled  to  call  itself  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Commerce and Industry. It is no use at\r\n\r\nall  to have the word \"Industry\" if the Federation\r\n\r\nis   not   sympathetic  to  our  industrialisation\r\n\r\npolicy. I would remind the Government that  it  is\r\n\r\nhigh  time  to consider formulation of pan-Malayan\r\n\r\ndevelopment  plans.  Unemployment  is  facing   us\r\n\r\ntoday,  and if nothing is done, it will  mean  the\r\n\r\nend  of  Singapore  as  an entrepot  centre.  Many\r\n\r\nfactories  will have to close down.  Sir,  despite\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  there has been a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\nsmuggling of Indonesian rubber, many rubber  mills\r\n\r\nhave  had to close down. If the Minister wants  to\r\n\r\nkeep  the word \"Industry\" in his Ministry, he must\r\n\r\ndo something at once to bring this about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir,\r\n\r\nfirst  I  must thank the Member for Serangoon  for\r\n\r\nhis  remark that my Ministry is the most important\r\n\r\nMinistry  in the Government. Evidently  he  thinks\r\n\r\nso,  but some members of the Press do not, because\r\n\r\nnormally you do not find them giving much space to\r\n\r\nmy  warnings of the economic future of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSir, I am glad that the Mem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbers  of  this  House are now  slowly  realising,\r\n\r\nafter  repeated  warnings given  by  me  from  the\r\n\r\nSeptember  sittings  onwards,  that  our  economic\r\n\r\nfuture  is not as bright as we had hoped it  would\r\n\r\nbe  Sir,  during the September sittings, where  we\r\n\r\ndebated the Governor's Address, I warned the House\r\n\r\nthat  we would be lucky if we could manage to keep\r\n\r\nup  our entrepot trade to the same level as we are\r\n\r\ndoing now. There are many people in Singapore who,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, cannot see the writing on the wall.\r\n\r\nThey  are still complacent about it and they still\r\n\r\nthink that we will survive somehow. They say,  \"We\r\n\r\nhave  survived for the last hundred years. So  why\r\n\r\nshould we not survive now?\" But Sir, they fail  to\r\n\r\nnote  the changing conditions in the world  today.\r\n\r\nThey  fail  to realise that as each Asian  country\r\n\r\ngains  its independence, it wishes to develop  its\r\n\r\neconomy for the benefit of its own people and  not\r\n\r\nfor  the  benefit of some other middle  man,  like\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and naturally you cannot quarrel  with\r\n\r\nthem  over  that. Sir, I am glad that  Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House  have now realised the true  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs and have shown their concern over  the  future of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what does the Government intend to do about\r\n\r\nit? Frankly, Sir, the Government can only try, but\r\n\r\nit  cannot  be  a hundred per cent sure  that  our\r\n\r\neconomic  future  will  be sound,  because  a  lot\r\n\r\ndepends on the attitude of other countries towards\r\n\r\nus.  Therefore, as I have always stressed,  it  is\r\n\r\npolitics that will be the ultimate solution to our\r\n\r\nproblems   and  not  economy.  The   position   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  viewed not from the economic  angle\r\n\r\nbut from the political angle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given warnings about our entrepot trade\r\n\r\nand  I have laid stress on the development of  our\r\n\r\nsecondary industries. At the 7th November  sitting\r\n\r\nI  outlined a programme whereby we could encourage\r\n\r\nindustries,  but there again I must  warn  Members\r\n\r\nthat a lot depends on whether we could realise the\r\n\r\nresults  that  we hope would be achieved,  on  the\r\n\r\nattitude  of  the  Federation.  Sir,  the   duties\r\n\r\nimposed by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfederation at its last Budget sittings on a lot of\r\n\r\nmanufactures are going to affect greatly  some  of\r\n\r\nour industries, and I am not only disturbed but  I\r\n\r\nam  also,  frankly, Sir, worried about it,  and  I\r\n\r\nthink  every  responsible person in  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nworried  about it. I have done my best to indicate\r\n\r\nto  the  Federation Government that Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  should  be  looked  upon  as  one\r\n\r\neconomic  unit,  though  politically  we  may   be\r\n\r\nseparated, but again, Sir, it is politics that  is\r\n\r\ntoday directing economy, and so far a solution has\r\n\r\nnot  yet  been reached. I do hope that we  may  be\r\n\r\nable  to  reach  a  solution of  viewing  our  two\r\n\r\neconomic  systems  on a single unit  basis  rather\r\n\r\nthan on a separate unit basis. I have not given up\r\n\r\nhope, Sir, in this direction but, frankly, I would\r\n\r\nbe misleading this House if I said that I am over-optimistic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Serangoon has pointed to the\r\n\r\nright  direction  when  he  said  that  we  should\r\n\r\ndevelop  our  fisheries to  a  greater  extent.  I\r\n\r\nentirely  agree  with him, Sir. I have  given  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of fisheries development a great deal  of\r\n\r\nthought in the last few months because, as  I  see\r\n\r\nit, we are an island surrounded by waters from two\r\n\r\nof  the greatest oceans of the world, and I  think\r\n\r\nwe  could look towards the sea to support us more.\r\n\r\nHowever, the development of fisheries would take a\r\n\r\nlot  of time. There is a schedule in the Estimates\r\n\r\nwhich  shows a summary of expenditure incurred  by\r\n\r\nthe  Fisheries Department. This has been  steadily\r\n\r\nexpanding since 1946. In 1946 it started  with  an\r\n\r\nexpenditure of $37,000 only, going up  to  $41,000\r\n\r\nin  1947, dropping to $14,000 in 1948 and  $37,000\r\n\r\nin 1949, then going up again to $163,000 in 1950,\r\n\r\n$143,000  in  1951, $268,000 in 1952, $311,000  in\r\n\r\n1953,  and I believe it is $500,000 this year  and\r\n\r\nmore  next year. From these figures, Sir, you will\r\n\r\nsee   that  the  Fisheries  Department  has   been\r\n\r\nexpanding steadily. In the very little time that I\r\n\r\nhave  left to hold office as Minister for Commerce\r\n\r\nand  Industry before the elections come along next\r\n\r\nyear,  I  will  do  whatever  I  can  to  set  the\r\n\r\nFisheries Department on the right course  so  that\r\n\r\nit may be able\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  expand.  Sir, I will speak in more  detail  on\r\n\r\nthis   subject  when  we  come  to  the  Fisheries\r\n\r\nEstimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir,\r\n\r\nstress by me always has been laid on commerce  and\r\n\r\nindustry  as the lifeblood of Singapore's  income.\r\n\r\nEntrepot   trade  and  industry  come  under   the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Commerce and Industry. \"Industry\" does\r\n\r\nnot  only  mean, as the Member for Cairnhill  said\r\n\r\nyesterday,  produce. Produce is an important  item\r\n\r\nof  entrepot trade and entails importing,  grading\r\n\r\nand  re-exporting. Singapore has been  handling  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  manufactured goods in importing  and  re-exporting.  Sir,  entreport trade means  middle men\r\n\r\nhandling  commodities between different countries;\r\n\r\nin  other  words,  it  is a sort  of  transhipment\r\n\r\ncentre. An entrepot centre can only thrive if  its\r\n\r\nhandling  charges  are cheap, its  port  dues  are\r\n\r\ncompetitive,  so  that other countries  will  send\r\n\r\ntheir  goods;  or  the merchants in  the  entrepot\r\n\r\ncentre   import   goods  and  re-ship   to   other\r\n\r\ncountries. That is called entrepot trade. In other\r\n\r\nwords,  you have to compete, and the only  way  to\r\n\r\nkeep  our entrepot trade is to bring down the cost\r\n\r\nof  living  and  keep  down expenditure.  How  can\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade be preserved if expenditure  keeps\r\n\r\nmounting  up? Naturally the wage-earner, in  order\r\n\r\nto  exist, must demand wage increases. In the face\r\n\r\nof  all  this, the entrepot trade will vanish.  So\r\n\r\nthe  only  way to meet the situation is  to  bring\r\n\r\ndown  expenditure bring down the cost  of  living,\r\n\r\nand make the handling charges competitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the second point - industry and\r\n\r\nmanufacturing. We have no materials of our own. So\r\n\r\nfrom what are we going to manufacture? We have  to\r\n\r\nimport everything from other countries in order to\r\n\r\nmanufacture our goods. Then again we have  to  pay\r\n\r\nhigh labour charges. Sir, everyone knows that even\r\n\r\nEngland  is unable to compete with countries  like\r\n\r\nGermany  and  Japan. Anyone can find in  the  book\r\n\r\n\"Trade   Commission's  Report  of  1932/33\"   that\r\n\r\nJapanese  shirts were sold in the  London  market.\r\n\r\nThen again, Sir, because we have no materials with\r\n\r\nwhich  to manufacture goods, when our charges  are\r\n\r\nso high, how can we compete with others?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is  impossible to compete with countries which\r\n\r\ncan   mass-produce  goods  and  where  the  people\r\n\r\ncontribute  their  bit towards the  upliftment  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own  country.  Even the shipping  companies\r\n\r\nthere  are subsidised by the Government. But  here\r\n\r\neveryone  is  out to get the maximum  out  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry for oneself and in such circumstances  you\r\n\r\ncannot have thriving industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stress has been laid on the Federation and on the\r\n\r\npolitics of the Federation. At this stage when the\r\n\r\nFederation is on the way to merdeka, I  would  not\r\n\r\nlike to touch on this subject. Our future is still\r\n\r\nundecided  and there is a lot of time to  talk  on\r\n\r\nthat  topic.  Therefore, Sir,  if  the  future  of\r\n\r\nSingapore    is    dark,   it   is    Government's\r\n\r\nresponsibility to do something about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  are  only  two points to which  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nreply.  Costs,  of course, have a bearing  on  the\r\n\r\nentrepot trade, but the present situation is  such\r\n\r\nthat  some  countries do not give  due  regard  to\r\n\r\ncosts. They can buy goods cheaper in Singapore but\r\n\r\nthey refuse to do so. They prefer to buy them from\r\n\r\nthe  country  of origin, even though they  may  be\r\n\r\ndearer,  because  of political considerations.  We\r\n\r\nhave had personal experience of that in talks with\r\n\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, Sir, that we have no raw materials of\r\n\r\nour  own,  but England, although she  has  no  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials  of  her  own, is  one  of  the  leading\r\n\r\nmanufacturing countries in the world. Sir,  if  we\r\n\r\ncan  get capital, if we have the know-how, and  if\r\n\r\nwe  have people with a will to work, I am sure  we\r\n\r\ncan  build up our industries. Even though we might\r\n\r\nhave  to face tariff barriers across the causeway,\r\n\r\nwe can still compete in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommerce   and  Industry  has  not   answered   my\r\n\r\nquestion, and that is, whether it is possible  now\r\n\r\nto   have   a  policy  for  pan-Malayan   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Despite the great success achieved by the\r\n\r\nAgricultural  Show last September.  I  wonder  how\r\n\r\nmany  hon.  Members in this House  really  believe\r\n\r\nthat   our  agricultural  plans  have  made   much\r\n\r\nimprovement.  My  personal  experience  with   the\r\n\r\nfarmers  is to the contrary. At present  they  are\r\n\r\nfacing  a  most critical situation. Their poultry,\r\n\r\npigs and vegetables fetch very low prices. Feeding\r\n\r\nstuffs  have to be purchased at a very high price.\r\n\r\nMany\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFarmers  have  been making representations  to  me\r\n\r\nsaying that they cannot carry on with the state of\r\n\r\naffairs  at  present. I would like  to  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to request the Government to find  out\r\n\r\nwhether  the  livestock of  the  country  and  the\r\n\r\nfarmers' income are increasing or decreasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, we have in this territory a certain\r\n\r\ninstitution  established to study how  to  improve\r\n\r\nour  agricultural activities or developments,  and\r\n\r\nyet  I  know very little of how the Government  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to utilise fully the research work done  by\r\n\r\nthis institution, directly or indirectly, for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of the farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I wish the Government would take\r\n\r\nsteps to impart the technical knowledge gained  to\r\n\r\nthe  farmers so that they can make full use of the\r\n\r\nlimited farmland at their disposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nChairman, Sir, I have just discovered this morning\r\n\r\nthat  the  Agricultural units  are  giving  visual\r\n\r\ndemonstrations at the Yio Chu Kang  and  Sembawang\r\n\r\nstations  in  the  use  of  cheap  fertilisers  or\r\n\r\nchemical  fertilisers and local waste products.  I\r\n\r\njust wonder why this has not been done in the case\r\n\r\nof Lim Chu Kang Experimental Station? I think, Mr\r\n\r\nChairman, Sir, this matter of demonstration is not\r\n\r\ngenerally known to the farmers and I suggest  that\r\n\r\naction  should be taken to publicise this. I  have\r\n\r\nin  mind  the Rural News which I hope can help  to\r\n\r\nassimilate this information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing, Sir, is about the tracks and\r\n\r\nroads leading to farmlands.

The Member for Changi (Mr  Lim  Cher\r\n\r\nKheng)  raised the point that the farmers were  in\r\n\r\ndifficulties  because  they  had  to  buy   dearer\r\n\r\nfeeding stuffs. Well, that matter is being  looked\r\n\r\nafter  now. If Members had read the newspapers  of\r\n\r\nlast  Monday,  they would have seen that,  at  the\r\n\r\nopening  of the co-operative conference, I  made  a\r\n\r\nstatement  that the Government will be willing  to\r\n\r\nsupport as much as possible the farmers and that I\r\n\r\nwill  consider  granting them loans provided  they\r\n\r\nband    themselves   together   into   co-operative\r\n\r\nsocieties. There has only been one approach  made,\r\n\r\nSir, to my Ministry for the granting of loans  and\r\n\r\nwe are trying to work that one out now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will be glad to hear that I am personally\r\n\r\nvisiting as many kampongs as possible to interview\r\n\r\nthe farmers personally to talk to them about their\r\n\r\ndifficulties  and I hope that I will  be  able  to\r\n\r\ngrasp the facts more thoroughly than at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Sir, the emphasis in Singapore is not\r\n\r\nso  much on agriculture as on poultry-rearing  and\r\n\r\npig-breeding.  We  are  very  short  of  land  and\r\n\r\ntherefore we cannot have agriculture to a very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreat extent.

There seem to be three\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmain  ones: that of agriculture which, of  course,\r\n\r\nis extremely limited by area; there is the tourist\r\n\r\nindustry of which I have already spoken and  there\r\n\r\nis  the fisheries industry. Fisheries seems to  me\r\n\r\nto   have  the  greatest  potentialities  but  the\r\n\r\nproduction  of  fish  is  not  nearly   equal   to\r\n\r\nSingapore's requirements - about 40 per cent  if  I\r\n\r\nam  not mistaken - and fish has to be imported  from\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  and from Indonesia  although  the\r\n\r\nwide  seas are open to us as much as they are open\r\n\r\nto  our  neighbours.  There  are  three  types  of\r\n\r\nfishing  possible: the inshore fishing  round  our\r\n\r\nown   coasts;  the  outshore  fishing  to  distant\r\n\r\nwaters, and pond-fishing both fresh water and  sea\r\n\r\nwater.  I  believe  I am correct  in  saying  that\r\n\r\ninshore  fishing has been exploited to the fullest\r\n\r\nextent and not much increase can be expected. But,\r\n\r\nSir,  much  more can be done and must be  done  to\r\n\r\nfish in more distant waters with the use of larger\r\n\r\nmotor  vessels and more modern equipment.  Whether\r\n\r\nprivate  industry can be encouraged to  invest  in\r\n\r\nsuch ships and gear to a large enough extent, I am\r\n\r\nnot  competent  to  say, but  I  am  certain  that\r\n\r\nprivate  enterprise will not come  forward  unless\r\n\r\nbetter  fish  landing  facilities  and  a  central\r\n\r\nwholesale  market are set up. I believe that  this\r\n\r\nis a project that has been under consideration for\r\n\r\nmany  years  and  I would like to  know  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  why  it is being delayed?  If  the  only\r\n\r\nreason is one of finance, then is it not the  case\r\n\r\nof fisheries being regarded as a poor relation? My\r\n\r\nown  view is that the Government may have to  show\r\n\r\nthe  by  building  their own powered  vessels  and\r\n\r\ntraining  our  people to man them  and  getting  a\r\n\r\nreturn  on  their investment through the increased\r\n\r\nsales of fish in a central wholesale market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the third type of fishing, namely,\r\n\r\npond-fishing. The Economic Mission in their Report\r\n\r\nmade specific reference to the mangrove swamp area\r\n\r\nof Singapore, stating as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...There are about 900 acres of such ponds and a\r\n\r\npotentially  available area  of  several  thousand\r\n\r\nacres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fresh Water and brackish water facilities and\r\n\r\noperations,  particularly the ponds, are  capable\r\n\r\nof very considerable expansion...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if we turn to the 1955 Report of the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Commerce and Industry, page  185,  we\r\n\r\nfind the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In the field of brackish water fisheries, two\r\n\r\nexperimental  prawn ponds were built  towards  the\r\n\r\nend  of 1954 (that is before the coming in of  the\r\n\r\npresent Government) with a view to encouraging the\r\n\r\nutilisation  of the extensive swamps of  Singapore\r\n\r\nIsland.  The  cost of building the  bunds,  sluice\r\n\r\ngates  and huts was $12,840. ...During 1955 the total\r\n\r\ncatch  of fish, prawns and crabs amounted to 8,614\r\n\r\nkatties   and  realised  $8,194.  This  experiment\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  conclusively  that  a  small  family\r\n\r\nwould be able to operate such ponds on an economic\r\n\r\nbasis  provided  capital  was  available  for  the\r\n\r\nbuilding of bunds and gates.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to the question for Written Answer put to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  on the catch so far  this  year,  I\r\n\r\nreceived the reply that for the period January  to\r\n\r\nOctober 1956, the total catch was 6,638 katis  and\r\n\r\nthe  sum realised therefrom was $7,802. The Answer\r\n\r\nwent on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In 1955, the ponds were operated at the maximum\r\n\r\nlevel  of  production in order to determine  basic\r\n\r\ndata.  It is not expected that the catch for  that\r\n\r\nyear  will be exceeded in 1956 because experiments\r\n\r\nduring the current year are being conducted on the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  fewer  operations with  the  object  of\r\n\r\nreducing  labour  costs  and  obtaining   a   more\r\n\r\neconomical yield.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Fair   enough,  but  the  figures  are  sufficient\r\n\r\nconfirmation  that  there are great  opportunities\r\n\r\nfor the development of this type of fishing and  I\r\n\r\nhave  no  doubt  that, through more  research,  it\r\n\r\nshould be possible to increase the yield of prawns\r\n\r\nper  acre;  thus  increasing  the  return  to  the\r\n\r\nfishermen  and,  at  the same time,  reducing  the\r\n\r\nmarket price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point is this: The Government has\r\n\r\nestablished that a small family can operate  these\r\n\r\nponds  on an economic basis, provided the  capital\r\n\r\nof  less than $6,500 per pond is advanced for  the\r\n\r\nbuilding of bunds and gates. Why delay one  moment\r\n\r\nfrom  putting  this into action  so  that  we  can\r\n\r\nprovide  more  employment and  increase  our  fish\r\n\r\nsupplies?  I am sure that if the work was  put  in\r\n\r\nhand on a large scale by the Government numbers of\r\n\r\nfamilies  would  come  forward  to  learn  how  to\r\n\r\noperate the ponds and, if done on a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlarge  scale, the costs might even be reduced.  As\r\n\r\nit  is,  the  number of fishermen engaged  in  the\r\n\r\nprawn  pond industry dropped from 182 in  1954  to\r\n\r\n165 in 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, from an examination of the Estimates, I\r\n\r\ncharge  the  Government with  giving  insufficient\r\n\r\nthought  and money to an important and  productive\r\n\r\nindustry  which  is urgently needing  development.\r\n\r\nThe Minister, a few days ago, talked vaguely about\r\n\r\na  phased programme covering some years.  What  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  know is, what is the programme for  1957\r\n\r\nand  is it adequate? Perhaps, Sir, the trouble  is\r\n\r\ndue to the inadequacy of the Research Station, for\r\n\r\nI  am not convinced that the money being spent  on\r\n\r\nthis Research Station is at present justified. You\r\n\r\nwill notice from the Estimates that the amount  is\r\n\r\nbeing   increased  this  year  from  $148,000   to\r\n\r\n$253,750 of which $217,500 is to be paid  by  this\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Even the Minister in  his  speech  on\r\n\r\nMonday implied that it was working on a long  term\r\n\r\nbasis and that he was going to change it. What  we\r\n\r\nwant  is not pure research but practical research;\r\n\r\nnot  more  books  and articles on fish,  but  more\r\n\r\nfish.  Is  this not the policy of the  Government?\r\n\r\nWill  the  Minister  tell us  what  this  Research\r\n\r\nStation  has contributed to this practical problem\r\n\r\nso far to justify the money we are spending on it,\r\n\r\nwhy he is dissatisfied with the present policy and\r\n\r\nwhat changes he proposes to make and as this is  a\r\n\r\npan-Malayan enterprise, would he state whether the\r\n\r\nother  Governments involved are also  dissatisfied\r\n\r\nand if they are in agreement in making a change?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Briefly, Mr Chairman, Sir, there is\r\n\r\none  aspect of this prawn-ponding and fish-ponding\r\n\r\nwhich  my  Ministry has had to take note  of.  We\r\n\r\nhave  had our Chief Drainage Engineer dealing with\r\n\r\nthe flooding problems of Singapore and one part of\r\n\r\nthe  cause  of  flooding in  some  places  is  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of dams or bunds either in a  valley  or\r\n\r\nperhaps  in an estuary or in the swamp  lands  for\r\n\r\nthe purpose of impounding water and creating fish-ponds, either\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfresh  or  salt. We therefore have been consulting\r\n\r\nwith  both the Ministry of Lands and the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Commerce  and Industry on the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nmore  economic layouts for fish-ponds through  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  planned heavy earth-moving equipment  and\r\n\r\nthat  kind of thing so as to get the whole estuary\r\n\r\nplanned first and then I presume that it would  be\r\n\r\npossible  to sublet it so that individual families\r\n\r\nor,  if you like, companies - however it works  out\r\n\r\nbest - could  operate  the  ponds  once  they   were\r\n\r\nprepared.  I  think that there would  probably  be\r\n\r\nbenefits though I have not yet got a report on the\r\n\r\ndetails of all the possibilities. It will be worth\r\n\r\nconsidering in due course as to whether  it  would\r\n\r\nnot  be  better  to do the whole construction  job\r\n\r\nfirst  on a large scale and then to sublet  rather\r\n\r\nthan  to hand out small sums of capital to  people\r\n\r\nwho can not easily control, and may contribute to,\r\n\r\nflooding by putting a dam in the wrong place;  or,\r\n\r\nof course, their dam may break and they lose their\r\n\r\nfish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am sure\r\n\r\nthat both sides of the House must be grateful  for\r\n\r\nthe  clear picture painted to us about our fishing\r\n\r\nindustry by the Member for Tanglin. He has made it\r\n\r\nvery  clear  that the fishing industry is  divided\r\n\r\ninto  three  categories:  inshore,  deep-sea   and\r\n\r\nrearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will touch on inshore fishing which is not\r\n\r\nonly  very  little developed but I would  like  to\r\n\r\nadd, from my personal experience of the fishing at\r\n\r\nPadang  Terbakar and Mata Ikan, that  the  inshore\r\n\r\nfishing industry is slowly dying. Although we  see\r\n\r\nmany kelongs along our sea coast, the catches  are\r\n\r\nso poor that the proprietors running them are near\r\n\r\nto bankruptcy. I am sure the Minister for Commerce\r\n\r\nand  Industry  knows  about  this  better  than  I\r\n\r\nmyself. The identity cards of these fishermen show\r\n\r\nthat their occupation is fishing, but actually you\r\n\r\ncan  term  them as being unemployed. The fishermen\r\n\r\nwho  stay  in  the so-called fishing villages  who\r\n\r\nrely on inshore fishing are practically unemployed\r\n\r\nbecause their income is so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlow - about $100 a month - and they have big  families\r\n\r\nto   support.  Therefore  I  wish  to  take   this\r\n\r\nopportunity to urge the Government to  take  stock\r\n\r\nof  the serious situation facing us. I would  like\r\n\r\nto  ask  a  question: since we  proclaim  that  we\r\n\r\nbelieve in Socialism, then I think it is high time\r\n\r\nfor   us   to   encourage   the   development   of\r\n\r\nco-operatives.    The    Co-operative    Development\r\n\r\nDepartment  in the past has merely  served  in  an\r\n\r\nadvisory  capacity. If the Government  believe  in\r\n\r\nSocialism,  they  should take an  active  part  to\r\n\r\nencourage  more  co-operative societies  especially\r\n\r\namong  the fishing villages which would  cut  down\r\n\r\nthe   middlemen's   chances  of   exploiting   the\r\n\r\nfishermen's  hard-earned money and,  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime, the Government can render direct aid by  way\r\n\r\nof  imparting technical knowledge to the fishermen\r\n\r\nso  that the inshore fishing industry can be saved\r\n\r\nin  time.  Deep-sea fishing should also  be  fully\r\n\r\nencouraged. We should not wait for the  report  of\r\n\r\nthe  research in the fishery industry. We must  do\r\n\r\nsomething about it at once. It is a shame that  an\r\n\r\nisland like Singapore can only, as the Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin  said,  supply 40  per  cent  of  its  own\r\n\r\nconsumption  of  fish, the balance  having  to  be\r\n\r\nimported from our neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.58 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, arising out\r\n\r\nof the complaint of the last hon. speaker that the\r\n\r\ncatch  of  the  inshore fishing is dwindling  very\r\n\r\nrapidly,  may  I  enquire from  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommerce  and Industry whether he would  consider,\r\n\r\nby legislation, to control the size of the mesh of\r\n\r\nnets  used  for catching fish round the shores  of\r\n\r\nSingapore? I have often seen pukat boats with  the\r\n\r\nmen  pulling in the nets and the mesh is  so  fine\r\n\r\nthat  not even the smallest spawn has a chance  to\r\n\r\nescape. Naturally, such a procedure which goes  on\r\n\r\nyear  after year is bound to affect the  catch  of\r\n\r\nthe  fish  in  the inshore waters. I think  nearly\r\n\r\nevery  country  in Europe has a law ensuring  that\r\n\r\nthe  size of the mesh of nets should not  be  less\r\n\r\nthan an inch or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsomething  to that effect and, possibly,  if  this\r\n\r\nmeasure  were  taken  in  time,  the  catch  might\r\n\r\nimprove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to congratulate the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Communications and Works on the plan  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Works Department to proceed as rapidly  as\r\n\r\npossible  to  build bunds so that not  only  would\r\n\r\nthey  help the flow of flood waters but also  they\r\n\r\nwould  be  used  for  making ponds  for  fish  and\r\n\r\nprawns.   That,   I  think,  is  a   very   useful\r\n\r\nsuggestion.  Not only will it save money  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  who wish to rear prawns but it  will  also\r\n\r\nhelp in the economy of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nparticularly attracted by the idea of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Communications  and Works  wanting  to  build\r\n\r\nprawn  ponds for these fishermen. This is  a  very\r\n\r\nnovel  idea. It will help them a great  deal,  but\r\n\r\none point arises: if we are going to encourage the\r\n\r\nprawn pond industry, two departments will have  to\r\n\r\ndecide on it, that is, the Fisheries Department as\r\n\r\nwell  as the Land Office. Land must be granted  by\r\n\r\nthe Land Office and then sanctioned for fishing by\r\n\r\nthe  Fisheries Department. As far  as  I  know,  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  of our marshland is still  not  being\r\n\r\nmade  use of, and most of such land is being given\r\n\r\nunder   Temporary  Occupation  Licences  or  other\r\n\r\nlicences for the purpose of agriculture. When  the\r\n\r\nmarshland is brackish in nature, very little  will\r\n\r\ngrow there except mangroves, and I think that  the\r\n\r\ndepartment  concerned should  reconsider  granting\r\n\r\nsuch land for purposes of fishing as this has been\r\n\r\nconsidered  as most important by so many  Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of flooding of land by these prawn\r\n\r\nponds, I think that there is some confusion there,\r\n\r\nbecause  once fresh water comes into  these  prawn\r\n\r\nponds,  they  will  not be very productive.  Prawn\r\n\r\npond  owners usually want to preserve their  bunds\r\n\r\nfrom being destroyed by torrents of water, and let\r\n\r\nout water even before the rains come so that there\r\n\r\nis not much danger of blocking up of drainage. The\r\n\r\nmost  important thing, Sir, is that  in  order  to\r\n\r\nencourage fishing, the fishermen must be  able  to\r\n\r\nrealise a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecent income, and in order to do  so, they should\r\n\r\nbe  able to market their fish easily. We now  come\r\n\r\nto  the  question  of a central  market  which  is\r\n\r\nreally  overdue.  I  remember that  I  asked  that\r\n\r\nquestion of the Minister for Commerce and Industry\r\n\r\nsome time ago in a debate in this House, and since\r\n\r\ntime  is getting short, I will not repeat  it.  If\r\n\r\nthe Minister would refer to what I have spoken and\r\n\r\nact  on it, I think it will be very beneficial  to\r\n\r\nthe  people here. At that stage, I mentioned  also\r\n\r\nabout  deep-sea  fishing and I  consider  that  if\r\n\r\npeople  are  willing to invest money  in  deep-sea\r\n\r\nfishing  on  their own without any charge  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  seeing that the only  thing  that\r\n\r\ndeep-sea fishing will ever do is to bring in  more\r\n\r\nfish,  I  see  no  reason  for  limiting  such  an\r\n\r\nindustry.  If there is a greater supply  of  fish,\r\n\r\nthen  it  will  give  rise  to  another  industry,\r\n\r\nprobably that of fish-canning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, on the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  why  was the wholesale  fish  market\r\n\r\ndelayed,  I  explained at the Assembly sitting  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  that we had difficulties  to  find  the\r\n\r\nproper   site  for  it.  In  fact,  we  had   five\r\n\r\nsuccessive  sites  and each  of  them  was  either\r\n\r\nwanted  by  the Army or the Navy or someone  else.\r\n\r\nThe  last  site was at the side of Merdeka  Bridge\r\n\r\nbut  it was found that the land there was too soft\r\n\r\nand  required  heavy piling with a great  deal  of\r\n\r\nunnecessary cost. We have now discovered a site at\r\n\r\nthe end of the old Kallang airport runway. We have\r\n\r\nnot  acquired the site yet but we are working  out\r\n\r\nfigures  to  find out how much it will  cost.  The\r\n\r\njetty alone might cost over a million dollars  and\r\n\r\nprobably the whole market might cost in the region\r\n\r\nof $4 million as far as I know but, of course, the\r\n\r\nfigures are still being worked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which was raised was: why do we\r\n\r\nnot build our own powered vessels and train people\r\n\r\nfor  offshore fishing? The offshore fishing,  Sir,\r\n\r\nin  the southern portion of the China Sea is  very\r\n\r\npoor and you will not get much fish there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of encouragement of co-operatives\r\n\r\namongst the fishermen, Members will have read that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  gave  a loan  of  $4,000  to  the\r\n\r\nPonggol Co-operative Society of Fishermen and  that\r\n\r\nseems to be a great success. I have said that that\r\n\r\nwas  a pilot scheme. Basing on the results of that\r\n\r\nscheme, Government will consider further grants of\r\n\r\nnecessary loans to other fishing villages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of controlling the size of mesh of\r\n\r\nthe  nets,  I will have to consult with  my  Chief\r\n\r\nFisheries  Officer  because that  is  a  technical\r\n\r\nthing  that  I  do  not know much  about.  I  must\r\n\r\nconfess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the fish ponds, the question was: why\r\n\r\ndo  we  not increase the number of fish ponds?  We\r\n\r\nare   now,  Sir,  working  on  it  and,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nexperiments  are proceeding but they are  not  yet\r\n\r\nfinished.  There has been objection from fishermen\r\n\r\nin  Johore Straits who have been affected  by  the\r\n\r\ncurfew  and they are not keen to let any ponds  be\r\n\r\nopened  up in their areas because their livelihood\r\n\r\nhas  been  limited due to the curfew. We  are  now\r\n\r\nworking  with  the  Chief  Drainage  Engineer   to\r\n\r\nutilise all the swamp land on a co-operative basis.\r\n\r\nThere  is  not  much  of swamp land.  The  present\r\n\r\nhaphazard  development  has  caused  flooding  and\r\n\r\ntherefore we have to have the co-operation  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic Works Department on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we come to the Fisheries Research\r\n\r\nStation.  At  one  time, I myself considered  that\r\n\r\nthis  was  a  white elephant and I still  consider\r\n\r\nthat,  on the basis on which it is run, it is  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  of  much use  to  us.  The  present\r\n\r\narrangement  is that the Colonial Development  and\r\n\r\nWelfare  Fund met the total capital  cost  and  is\r\n\r\nmeeting  50 per cent of the recurrent expenditure.\r\n\r\nThe  rest  of  the 50 per cent is  shared  by  the\r\n\r\nFederation, Singapore, Sarawak, North  Borneo  and\r\n\r\nBrunei. The Federation has now indicated that they\r\n\r\nare  not  interested  in  keeping  up  with  their\r\n\r\ncontribution  and therefore it is  a  question  of\r\n\r\nwhether  we are to close down the Research Station\r\n\r\nentirely  or whether we have to shoulder  more  of\r\n\r\nthe contributions ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy  own intention is that we should carry on  with\r\n\r\nthe Research Station because we are still not sure\r\n\r\nwhether  it will not, in the end, prove beneficial\r\n\r\nto us and since so much money has been spent on it\r\n\r\nand  work is half done; but we should carry it  on\r\n\r\non  a  different basis. At present,  the  Research\r\n\r\nStation  is directing its attention to fundamental\r\n\r\nresearch and that is long-term research.  It  goes\r\n\r\ninto   detailed   studies  of   hydrological   and\r\n\r\nbiological conditions influencing the breeding  of\r\n\r\nfish and the habits of fish, and so on. We have  a\r\n\r\nvessel  Manihine of 213 tons. We  are  at  present\r\n\r\ndiscussing with the various Governments  concerned\r\n\r\nand  the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund  on\r\n\r\nthe change that we desire in this Station. My idea\r\n\r\nis  that  we should direct the activities of  this\r\n\r\nStation  to obtaining more tangible and  immediate\r\n\r\nresults.  There has, of course to be a  change  in\r\n\r\nthe  ratio of contributions because the Federation\r\n\r\nis  withdrawing from it and it is possible that we\r\n\r\nmay  have to bear a greater part than what we have\r\n\r\nbeen paying now and I hope that if that comes  up,\r\n\r\nhon.  Members on the Opposition will give me their\r\n\r\nsupport.   It  is  proposed  that  the   Fisheries\r\n\r\nDivision  should  take over the administration  of\r\n\r\nthis Station. Those are my new proposals which are\r\n\r\nstill  being  worked out: some of  the  expatriate\r\n\r\nscientists should be replaced by U.N.O. or Colombo\r\n\r\nPlan or local scientists and staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the question of fisheries\r\n\r\ngenerally,  we have 5,500 fishermen  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nout of whom 4,500 are inshore fishermen and out of\r\n\r\nthe  remaining  1,000  only  600  are  working  in\r\n\r\noffshore   units.  They  are  very  reluctant   to\r\n\r\nundertake   training  in  navigating   ocean-going\r\n\r\nfishing   vessels.  Most  of  our  fishermen   are\r\n\r\nreluctant  to go into offshore fishing because  of\r\n\r\nthe  long  delays  away  from  home.  That  is   a\r\n\r\ndifficulty  that we have got to persuade  them  to\r\n\r\novercome.  But  the  position  regarding  fish  is\r\n\r\ngenerally  that the inshore fishing  grounds  have\r\n\r\nbeen  fished to the limit. The offshore  areas  in\r\n\r\nthe  south portion of the South China Sea are  not\r\n\r\nsufficiently rich for economic operation. We  have\r\n\r\ntherefore to meet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincreased  demands by imports but we have  got  to\r\n\r\nsee  that our imports are not of such size  as  to\r\n\r\nupset the livelihood of these 4,500 fishermen  who\r\n\r\nare  depending for their livelihood on the inshore\r\n\r\nfishing because otherwise we will create a  social\r\n\r\nproblem.  That is why we have got to  balance  the\r\n\r\ntwo:  the  imports against the reduction in  price\r\n\r\nwhich  may be due to imports and which may  affect\r\n\r\nthe  livelihood of these fishermen. Otherwise what\r\n\r\nwill  happen  is  that we will have  to  subsidise\r\n\r\nthese fishermen and that will be a strain again on\r\n\r\nthe Colony's finances. But I am trying now to work\r\n\r\nout  a  scheme  in which it might be  possible  to\r\n\r\nsubsidise   these  inshore  fishermen   from   the\r\n\r\nindustry  itself. As I said earlier this  morning,\r\n\r\nthe  Fisheries Department is working now on a plan\r\n\r\nto expand the fishing industry and we hope that we\r\n\r\nwill  not  only be able to concentrate on offshore\r\n\r\nfishing  but also on deep-sea or oceanic  fishing.\r\n\r\nIf we can succeed in this, then we can hope to get\r\n\r\nsecondary  fishing industries in the  Colony  too.\r\n\r\nThe  advantages,  of  course,  will  not  only  be\r\n\r\nsecondary industries but it will also mean that we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to expand our exports of salt-fish.\r\n\r\nIf  we can go for whale-fishing, we might be  able\r\n\r\nto  manufacture  whale oil and blachan  and  other\r\n\r\nsorts of salt-fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in the Report of the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Commerce  and  Industry,  1955,   it\r\n\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"On present information there are not large\r\n\r\naggregations  of  fish  in the  South  China  Sea,\r\n\r\n...hence  our fishing units must penetrate into  the\r\n\r\nIndian and Pacific Oceans in order to produce more\r\n\r\nfish.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Is this being followed up?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, yesterday I said that\r\n\r\nbroadcasting should be scrapped. What I meant  was\r\n\r\nthat  it  be turned into a corporation and  I  say\r\n\r\nagain  that the Broadcasting Department should  be\r\n\r\nentirely  scrapped  now and  immediately  in  that\r\n\r\nsense.  It  is  the  same with the  Department  of\r\n\r\nSupplies.  This  Department  is  a  drain  on  the\r\n\r\nfinances  of the Colony. It has outlived  its  own\r\n\r\nusefulness. The staff can be absorbed  into  other\r\n\r\ndepartments. I understand that this Department  is\r\n\r\nkept simply for the stockpiling of rice. Formerly,\r\n\r\nit  included sugar and flour too. This  Department\r\n\r\nwas very essential after the British re-occupation\r\n\r\nof  this  Colony,  that is,  1945  to  1947,  when\r\n\r\nsupplies were short. Various countries were buying\r\n\r\non  a  percentage basis from the  few  sources  of\r\n\r\nsupply.  Today,  the position is quite  different,\r\n\r\nSir. It has been very different since the last two\r\n\r\nto  three  years. Sugar has been decontrolled  and\r\n\r\nonly  rice is controlled. I hope to move a  motion\r\n\r\nfor  the decontrol of rice at the next sitting  of\r\n\r\nthe Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the only argument in favour has been - and I\r\n\r\nthink  possibly  so  now - that this  stockpile  is\r\n\r\nmaintained for the purpose of emergency. Well,  it\r\n\r\nhas  been  ten years since the last war ended.  We\r\n\r\nhave  a lot of competition from the rice-producing\r\n\r\ncountries to sell their rice\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  us - Siam  and Burma: we will forget  the  extra\r\n\r\nthat we import from Communist China. Now, what  is\r\n\r\nthis  question of emergency? Is it a  shortage  of\r\n\r\nsupply?  That  is  not  so. There  are  plenty  of\r\n\r\nsupplies available. There is competition to  sell.\r\n\r\nThe only other emergency that may arise is war. If\r\n\r\nwar  is expected in this area, I do not know  from\r\n\r\nwhom  and by whom. For many, many years, I do  not\r\n\r\nthink that there will be a war in this part of the\r\n\r\nworld. Certainly not! Who is going to attack?  Our\r\n\r\nneighbours are peace-loving countries and  besides\r\n\r\nwe  have  the  influence  of  the  United  Nations\r\n\r\nOrganisation. So it is useless that on mere  fear,\r\n\r\nyou  should maintain this Department. It  will  he\r\n\r\nsurprising  from figures given to  know  how  much\r\n\r\nmoney has been lost on this stockpile, wastage  of\r\n\r\nrice,  etc.  Of  course, that will be  a  question\r\n\r\nwhich I will be asking at the next sitting of this\r\n\r\nAssembly:  how much money the Colony has  lost  in\r\n\r\nthe   trading   of  rice  alone,   excluding   the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of this Department? In addition,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  is  stopping the free movement of trade.  We\r\n\r\nhave  heard  a  lot of complaints  from  the  rice\r\n\r\ndealers'  associations. Of course,  I  will  bring\r\n\r\nthis  up  in  a  motion later in the coming  month\r\n\r\nafter  getting some answers to my queries which  I\r\n\r\nwill  be  putting up very soon. I ask this further\r\n\r\nquestion: is it necessary now to maintain  another\r\n\r\n\"white elephant\" and our revenues drained away  in\r\n\r\nsalaries, emoluments, and so on?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

On the Land Office  falls\r\n\r\nthe brunt of the work connected with resettlement,\r\n\r\ndevelopment, and eviction from land which  is  the\r\n\r\ninevitable story of our expanding Singapore.  Now,\r\n\r\nthis  movement is going on the whole time  and  it\r\n\r\nentails  a great deal of hardship and anxiety  for\r\n\r\nour  rural  and farmer population. I believe  that\r\n\r\nmuch  of  this  anxiety could be reduced  if  more\r\n\r\nforesight   and  understanding  of  the   people's\r\n\r\ndifficulties  were exercised. I have  come  across\r\n\r\nnumerous  instances where the  rural  people  have\r\n\r\nbecome,  so to speak, the victims of this or  that\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  and  they have  been  put  to  great\r\n\r\nstraits because they have not been told what their\r\n\r\nfuture is, whether they can stay put, whether they\r\n\r\nare to move, whether they are to get compensation,\r\n\r\nand  so  on. I have brought cases to the attention\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister in the past. Another recent  one\r\n\r\nthe Hon. the Chief Secretary knows about which has\r\n\r\ncaused great difficulty and embarrassment and  two\r\n\r\nmore  cases,  where  a lack of  consideration  was\r\n\r\nshown, were brought to me only last week, which  I\r\n\r\nwill pass on to the Minister to look into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it should be Government policy,\r\n\r\nwhatever  Party is in power, in this very delicate\r\n\r\nmatter  of moving and resettling families, to  see\r\n\r\nthat the approach is a humane approach, if the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport  of the rural population is to be won.  It\r\n\r\nhas   also  to  be  a  swift  approach,  so   that\r\n\r\nunscrupulous people have no time to  jump  in  and\r\n\r\nexploit the situation. I discovered only the other\r\n\r\nday   that  a  certain  association,  run  by  the\r\n\r\nPeople's   Action  Party,  which  has   now   been\r\n\r\ndissolved, was measuring the assets of a group  of\r\n\r\nfarmers due to be resettled and telling them  that\r\n\r\nthe areas of their houses, sheds and outhouses  on\r\n\r\nwhich  they would receive compensation were double\r\n\r\nwhat they really were. I do not wish to impugn the\r\n\r\nLand Office unduly in this whole matter. Theirs is\r\n\r\na  difficult and heavy task and their officers are\r\n\r\nonly  carrying out instructions. But I  would  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to see what can be done, in  advance\r\n\r\nof the development plan, to ensure that the people\r\n\r\nknow  what is going on and what is going to happen\r\n\r\nto them? Government departments tend to be inhuman\r\n\r\nand soulless; sometimes perhaps they have to be if\r\n\r\nthey  are  to  be  impartial but  if  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nspeaking  rural population is to be  won  over  to\r\n\r\nfeel that they belong to Singapore, much more  has\r\n\r\ngot to be done to appreciate their difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir, the question of evictions and resettlement of\r\n\r\nsquatters in Singapore is a very huge problem  and\r\n\r\nI  am sure that hon. Members of this Assembly will\r\n\r\nrealise  that  it  is a problem  which  cannot  be\r\n\r\neasily   overcome.  When  we  first  took  office,\r\n\r\nresettlement  and  evictions  in  the  island   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  were  done haphazardly;  there  was  no\r\n\r\nproper  system, although I must say that officials\r\n\r\nof the Land Office tried to do their best in order\r\n\r\nto  see  that the resettlement and evictions  were\r\n\r\ncarried  out  according to the law. But  since  we\r\n\r\ncame  into  office, particularly since  late  last\r\n\r\nyear,  as  Members will probably  be  aware,  too,\r\n\r\nGovernment  has appointed a working  party  to  go\r\n\r\ninto  this  whole question of land  clearance  and\r\n\r\nresettlement  and,  as  a  result  of  the  report\r\n\r\nsubmitted   by  this  particular  working   party,\r\n\r\nGovernment has adopted the recommendations of this\r\n\r\nparty  in  forming the authority called  the  Land\r\n\r\nClearance and Resettlement Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in this Report too, Sir, recommendations\r\n\r\nhave  been made with regard to compensation  which\r\n\r\nshould  be paid to squatters and you will  see  in\r\n\r\nthis  Report that compensation is even being  paid\r\n\r\nfor  fish-ponds, banana trees, coconut trees, pig-sties,  and so on. It is possible that during  the\r\n\r\ncourse of their work by the officials of the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice, occasions may arise where it is almost  an\r\n\r\nimpossibility to measure a particular  pond  right\r\n\r\nup  to  a particular square inch. I do admit  that\r\n\r\nthese  anomalies will arise but then  I  must  say\r\n\r\nthat  the officials of the Land Office are  really\r\n\r\ndevoted to this kind of work. As from the  1st  of\r\n\r\nJanuary   next  year,  this  Land  Clearance   and\r\n\r\nResettlement   Authority  is   being   transferred\r\n\r\ntemporarily to the Singapore Improvement Trust  to\r\n\r\nbe  a  body  which will work in close  co-operation\r\n\r\nwith  the  Singapore  Improvement  Trust  because,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  it has been recommended by this  working\r\n\r\nparty and, secondly, on questions of evictions and\r\n\r\nresettlement    in   Singapore,   the    Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust is mostly concerned because they\r\n\r\nare  the  people who would require  more  land  in\r\n\r\nSingapore for the building of houses in Singapore.\r\n\r\nI  said  temporarily, Sir, because as you probably\r\n\r\nknow,  we are now in the process of forming a  new\r\n\r\nHousing  Authority which will eventually eliminate\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Improvement Trust as an  agent  for\r\n\r\nGovernment in the building of houses in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,580,310 for Head 44 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSITTING NO:      13\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 45-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,089,180 for Head 45 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSITTING NO:      13\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 46-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the sum of $58,425,910 for Head 46 stand part of the Schedule.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in view of what I\r\n\r\nhave  said  and other Members have  said  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  regarding the need to expand our  education\r\n\r\nsystem,  it  would,  I  think,  be  difficult   to\r\n\r\ncriticise the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngeneral  line  of the Government's  programme  for\r\n\r\n1957  and I do not propose to deal with this today.\r\n\r\nFurther, I do not think that it will be helpful to\r\n\r\nrefer  to the problems of Chinese schools at  this\r\n\r\njuncture except to express admiration for the  way\r\n\r\nin which the Minister is tackling a most difficult\r\n\r\nproblem  with  firmness and, I  hope,  ultimately,\r\n\r\nwith success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to initiate a debate on another\r\n\r\naspect of education which, at the moment, seems to\r\n\r\nbe receiving inadequate consideration, namely, the\r\n\r\nencouragement  of games and the  use  of  playing-fields  in our schools. That the Government wishes\r\n\r\nto  see  the younger generation playing  games  is\r\n\r\nevident  from the support that they have given  to\r\n\r\nthe  Youth Sports Centre but is enough being  done\r\n\r\nin our schools? It perturbs me considerably to see\r\n\r\nso  many  Government  school playing-fields  lying\r\n\r\nvacant and unused in the evenings. I believe  that\r\n\r\nif  one  were  to make a survey of the  number  of\r\n\r\ngames  being  played on Saturdays and  Sundays  on\r\n\r\nschool  playing-fields throughout the  island,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be very small. The schools are shut and  so\r\n\r\nthe  fields must be too, seems to be the argument.\r\n\r\nI  submit, Sir, that this is absolutely wrong.  If\r\n\r\nevery playing-field in Singapore is fully occupied\r\n\r\nevery  evening in the week, so far as weather  and\r\n\r\nground conditions allow, by our young people, this\r\n\r\ncountry  will be a healthier place in every  sense\r\n\r\nof  that  word.  I know it will be said  that  the\r\n\r\nstudents  live long distances from their  schools,\r\n\r\nthat  they go home in the middle of the  day,  and\r\n\r\nthe  expense of transport to and fro is  involved,\r\n\r\nbut  young  people are going to the  Youth  Sports\r\n\r\nCentre in hundreds. When you are young and you are\r\n\r\nkeen enough, you will cycle miles to get a game. I\r\n\r\nknow  I  did.  I  will go further, Sir.  A  school\r\n\r\nplaying-field should not necessarily  be  reserved\r\n\r\nfor the use of the students of that school. If the\r\n\r\nstudents  do not wish to utilise it every  day  of\r\n\r\nthe  week, let the old boys of the school  have  a\r\n\r\nchance.  If  they do not want it,  let  youngsters\r\n\r\nliving  in  the vicinity get a game or  the  local\r\n\r\nboys'  club. I know that this sort of thing  needs\r\n\r\norganisation and enthusiasm, but it  is  not  more\r\n\r\nthan  a corollary of what we have all endorsed  in\r\n\r\nthe Youth Sports Centre.

I\r\n\r\nhope that the Government will see what can be done\r\n\r\nto  get  the fullest use out of the limited number\r\n\r\nof  playing-fields  at our disposal.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nprejudice and red tape regarding their use will be\r\n\r\nswept  to  one  side. If more of our young  people\r\n\r\nplayed  more games on more days of the  week  than\r\n\r\nthey  do  now, we would be building up  a  better,\r\n\r\nfitter  and  healthier generation to supplant  the\r\n\r\npaunch, under-exercised old gentlemen who  sit  in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Now the Assistant\r\n\r\nDirector  for Hospitals covers the Tan  Tock  Seng\r\n\r\nHospital and the Assistant Director for Health can\r\n\r\ncover the prevention side of tuberculosis. Why  is\r\n\r\nit necessary then to have a new third appointment?\r\n\r\nIt  seems  to  us  that this is top-heavy  in  the\r\n\r\nadministration of \"Medical and Health\".  While  we\r\n\r\nlike  to  see more doctors and more hospitals,  we\r\n\r\nthink  that  their duties should  be  confined  to\r\n\r\nmedical work itself instead of administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also another appointment on page 247, a\r\n\r\nnew  appointment of Medical Superintendent,  Grade\r\n\r\nE. Now if the Assistant Director for Hospitals has\r\n\r\na  Medical Superintendent (General Hospital) under\r\n\r\nhim,  then he should have plenty of time  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the Tan Tock Seng Hospital and T.B. Clinic.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words,  there may  be  an  argument  to\r\n\r\nsupport  one  new appointment but not two.  Again,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry appears to be setting up a whole new\r\n\r\ndepartment called \"Tuberculosis Control  Unit\"  at\r\n\r\npage 235 of the Estimates which shows a whole  new\r\n\r\nlist  of appointments. Not only is there to  be  a\r\n\r\nnew  Registrar under this Head, item 1  (106)   but\r\n\r\ntwo  new Senior Registrars are required under \"Tan\r\n\r\nTock  Seng Hospital and T.B. Clinic\" which appears\r\n\r\nin  item 68 (140) . Why is it necessary to have all\r\n\r\nthese Registrars and other new appointments partly\r\n\r\nunder  Tuberculosis Control Unit and partly  under\r\n\r\nTan Tock Seng Hospital and T.B. Clinic?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Ministry has in mind a new policy in\r\n\r\nconnection  with tuberculosis, then  the  Minister\r\n\r\nshould give the House full details of it so as  to\r\n\r\njustify  this extra expenditure. Again finally,  I\r\n\r\nwould   like   to  ask  whether  all   these   new\r\n\r\nappointments  will  be filled  through  promotions\r\n\r\nand,  if  so,  whether  they  will  be  filled  by\r\n\r\nMalayans?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.49 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think there has\r\n\r\nbeen  some confusion of thought by the Member  for\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar  because, if I heard him  rightly,  he\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the  Medical  Superintendent  of   the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital  (when he was referring  to  the\r\n\r\npage on the General Hospital) could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlook  after the Tan Tock Seng Hospital as well  as\r\n\r\ndo  the  administrative work.

Member  has now  coupled  all  his\r\n\r\namendments  together.  I therefore  think  that  I\r\n\r\nmight explain to the House the reasons for the new\r\n\r\nappointments  and  the  new  Tuberculosis  Control\r\n\r\nUnit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now, the Chief Medical Officer has been\r\n\r\ncombining  the  duties  of Medical  Superintendent\r\n\r\n(General   Hospital)  with  those  of  the   Chief\r\n\r\nAdministrative Medical Officer for  all  hospitals\r\n\r\nand   out-patients  services  in  Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nexpansion  of  this service has been considerable,\r\n\r\nfantastically so, over the last few  years  and  I\r\n\r\nwill,  in  a moment, illustrate that by  giving  a\r\n\r\nshort table of the overall increases in our 4 main\r\n\r\nHospitals from 1938. In 1938, the in-patients were\r\n\r\n25,913  and the out-patients were 87,447.  I  will\r\n\r\nskip  over a few years because each year shows  us\r\n\r\nan increase. In 1951, the in-patients increased to\r\n\r\n40,833  and the out-patients increased to 612,095.\r\n\r\nIn  1952,  that went up to 48,550 in-patients  and\r\n\r\n726,310  out-patients. In 1954, it  jumped  up  to\r\n\r\n58,859 in-patients and 1,169,689 out-patients  and\r\n\r\nin   1955  it  rose  to  62,024  in-patients   and\r\n\r\n1,271,165 out-patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, since the beginning of 1955, 522 hospital\r\n\r\nbeds  had been added to existing institutions  and\r\n\r\nthe  buildings now under construction will produce\r\n\r\nanother 672 beds before the end of 1956: that  is,\r\n\r\nby  that time, there will be 1,194 hospital  beds.\r\n\r\nBesides   that,  there  are  three   new   outdoor\r\n\r\ndispensaries  which have also been  added  to  the\r\n\r\nhospitals and during the coming year, a start will\r\n\r\nbe  made  on a new 500-bed acute general  hospital\r\n\r\nand  on  a  chronic hospital for 200 beds.  It  is\r\n\r\nhoped   also  to  establish  two  new  out-patient\r\n\r\nclinics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If administration and supervision is to be\r\n\r\nefficient,   a  post  for  another  administrative\r\n\r\nmedical officer must be created. The Chief Medical\r\n\r\nOfficer's  post  is  now to be  renamed  Assistant\r\n\r\nDirector of Medical Services (Hospitals)  and  his\r\n\r\noffice  will  be  transferred to the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth. Now the newly created post,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   of   the  Medical  Superintendent  (General\r\n\r\nHospital)  is to administer a hospital at  present\r\n\r\nof 1,005 beds which will shortly increase to 1,250\r\n\r\nbeds.  So there is a need for a full-time  Medical\r\n\r\nSuperintendent  for  that hospital  alone  and  to\r\n\r\nillustrate the necessity, I will give the table of\r\n\r\nthe  General  Hospital. In 1947,  the  in-patients\r\n\r\nwere 15,021 and the out-patients were 160,388.  In\r\n\r\n1952,  that  increased to 23,421  in-patients  and\r\n\r\n358,769  out-patients. That went up  fantastically\r\n\r\nuntil  1955  when the in-patients were 28,222  and\r\n\r\nthe  out-patients were 691,064. As I  have  pointed\r\n\r\nout,  it  is absolutely necessary to have a  full-time officer as the Medical Superintendent of  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital  and  an Assistant  Director  of\r\n\r\nMedical  Services  in respect of co-ordinating  all\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals. He will now be transferred to  the\r\n\r\noffices of the Ministry of Health. I would like to\r\n\r\ninform  hon.  Members  that  a  local  officer  is\r\n\r\navailable for consideration for promotion  to  the\r\n\r\npost of Medical Superintendent (General Hospital),\r\n\r\nGrade  E  and I have no doubts in my mind that  he\r\n\r\nwill be so accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on tuberculosis, I will answer the query\r\n\r\nraised  by the hon. Member on the Grade E post  at\r\n\r\npage 227. That tuberculosis is a serious menace in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  well  known.  This  appointment  of\r\n\r\nAssistant    Director    of    Medical    Services\r\n\r\n(Tuberculosis)  appearing at page  227  is  a  new\r\n\r\nappointment. For some years, an effective  control\r\n\r\norganisation  has  been  under  consideration.  In\r\n\r\n1954,  a  request was made for expert advice  from\r\n\r\nAustralia and in May 1955, after I assumed office,\r\n\r\nSir  Harry Wunderly, the Director of the  Division\r\n\r\nof  Tuberculosis  of  the Australian  Commonwealth\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health came to Singapore  to  assess\r\n\r\nthe  problem.  After  a  preliminary  survey,   he\r\n\r\nrecommended  that  we  should  set  up  a  control\r\n\r\norganisation  to trace, register  and  keep  under\r\n\r\nsurveillance  all proved cases of tuberculosis  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  can ensure that all these patients  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  under  treatment until  the  disease  is\r\n\r\narrested. Secondly, he advised that once such an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norganisation  was established, it would  be  worth\r\n\r\nwhile  commencing  a  short-term  intensive  case-finding survey with the help of Australian experts\r\n\r\nand  that  after  they  had withdrawn,  we  should\r\n\r\nmaintain   the   organisation   and   case-finding\r\n\r\nprogramme  to the greatest extent possible  within\r\n\r\nour    own    resources.    I    referred    these\r\n\r\nrecommendations  to the Medical  Advisory  Council\r\n\r\nand after their approval, this was accepted by the\r\n\r\nCouncil  of Ministers. Government has now  decided\r\n\r\nthat as we have now sufficient beds, it is time to\r\n\r\nstart  the campaign with the unit set out at  page\r\n\r\n235,  that  is, the unit to which the  Member  for\r\n\r\nPaya   Lebar   referred.  It  is  now   considered\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  have  an  experienced  officer   to\r\n\r\norganise this campaign and to co-ordinate  all  the\r\n\r\nanti-tuberculosis work in Singapore so that we can\r\n\r\nensure  that  infective cases of tuberculosis  are\r\n\r\nproperly  provided for and looked after either  by\r\n\r\nGovernment services or by S.A.T.A. (who will  work\r\n\r\nin  co-operation with Government)  or  by  private\r\n\r\npractitioners. Here again I would like  to  inform\r\n\r\nhon.   Members  of  this  House  that  a   locally\r\n\r\ndomiciled  officer,  a very  experienced  man,  is\r\n\r\navailable for this important post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might also be of interest to hon. Members to\r\n\r\nknow  that Government gave S.A.T.A. a hundred  per\r\n\r\ncent  capital grant to build a hospital  home  for\r\n\r\nchronic  infectious cases. The Government believes\r\n\r\nthat,  in  co-operation  with  S.A.T.A. and  with\r\n\r\ngeneral   practitioners,  an  effective   campaign\r\n\r\nagainst  tuberculosis can be successfully launched\r\n\r\nby this proposed organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now the post of Registrar which the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  also  referred to. This  officer  will  be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for maintaining a highly confidential\r\n\r\nregister  of known cases of tuberculosis  and  for\r\n\r\nliaison with private practitioners and S.A.T.A. to\r\n\r\nensure  that such patients are maintaining regular\r\n\r\ntreatments. This is a highly confidential post and\r\n\r\nthe  person holding it must be able to  deal  with\r\n\r\nprivate   practitioners  and  voluntary   agencies\r\n\r\namicably   and  helpfully.  A  man  of  integrity,\r\n\r\npersonality and experience is essential. It is not\r\n\r\nmerely a clerical post. It is important to have  a\r\n\r\ncomplete record of all known cases of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntuberculosis and I am sure that hon. Members of\r\n\r\nthe House will appreciate that that record is\r\n\r\nhighly confidential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.
