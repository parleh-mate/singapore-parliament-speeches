E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members, I have a message from\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the Governor. It is dated the 22nd of July, 1955. This is the message:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I understand that certain motions are before\r\n\r\nthe   Legislative  Assembly  this  morning   which\r\n\r\nconcern   the  interpretation  of  the   Order-in-Council, 1955, and that these motions arise out of\r\n\r\nrecommendations made to me by the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  the  appointment of four Assistant Ministers,\r\n\r\nand  of  correspondence, thereafter, in which  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  took  up  the  question  of   the\r\n\r\nexercise  of  my  discretionary powers  under  the\r\n\r\nOrder-in-Council. The exchange of letters has been\r\n\r\npresented to the Assembly at this sitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members will recollect that on the\r\n\r\noccasion of my Installation, only three weeks ago,\r\n\r\nI  gave  an assurance that I intended to  give  my\r\n\r\nwholehearted help and guidance to the  Council  of\r\n\r\nMinisters  in the execution of their policies  and\r\n\r\nin   the   task  of  running  the  Government   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  in order to bring about conditions  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the next stage in the advance towards self-government   becomes   not  only   desirable   but\r\n\r\npossible. I am sure that, so soon after my arrival\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, it is not necessary for me to renew\r\n\r\nthese assurances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now contended that my discretionary powers\r\n\r\nunder  the  Order-in-Council, which are  expressly\r\n\r\nexcluded  by section 19 (1) (i) from consideration\r\n\r\nby   the  Council  of  Ministers  (which  is   the\r\n\r\nprincipal   instrument   of   policy   under   the\r\n\r\nConstitution) are to be interpreted in  a  manner\r\n\r\nwhich   would  amount  to  an  amendment  of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution. When the Chief Minister asked me  to\r\n\r\nappoint  four Assistant Ministers, I was  required\r\n\r\nby  Section 32 of the Order-in-Council to  consult\r\n\r\nhim  and  then  to  exercise my discretion  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether or not these appointments should be  made.\r\n\r\nWhile,  of course, I would at all times  give  the\r\n\r\ngreatest   weight  to  the  views  of  the   Chief\r\n\r\nMinister,  it will be noted that the  language  of\r\n\r\nSection  32 of the Order-in-Council puts upon  the\r\n\r\nGovernor  merely  the obligation  to  consult  the\r\n\r\nChief   Minister,  and  there  is   no   provision\r\n\r\ncorresponding  to  Section 19  (2)  requiring  the\r\n\r\nGovernor to act in accordance with recommendations\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  Chief  Minister.  If  it  had  been\r\n\r\nintended  that the Governor must act in accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the advice given, express provision to  that\r\n\r\neffect would have been included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position regarding my discretionary powers\r\n\r\nunder  the  Constitution is this, that, where  the\r\n\r\nGovernor is bound to accept\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  advice  tendered to him, it is  provided  for\r\n\r\nexpressly,  and this can be seen by  reference  to\r\n\r\nSection   19  (2).  The  Order-in-Council  clearly\r\n\r\npreserves  to  the  Governor  certain  powers  and\r\n\r\nduties,  and  these powers and  duties  cannot  be\r\n\r\ngiven  up,  or  delegated,  to, the  Council   of\r\n\r\nMinisters without a radical change in the form  of\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution. The Chief Minister now contends\r\n\r\nthat  I  should  interpret  the  exercise  of   my\r\n\r\ndiscretionary  powers  in a  manner,  which  would\r\n\r\namount to an amendment of the Constitution. As the\r\n\r\nOrder-in-Council   is  made  by   Her   Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment, any amendment of it must be subject to\r\n\r\nnegotiations with Her Majesty's Government. It is\r\n\r\nnot  a matter, which can be settled merely between\r\n\r\nthe Governor and the Chief Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should add that, yesterday morning, I received\r\n\r\na  message from the Secretary of State in which he\r\n\r\nconfirmed  my  interpretation of  the  use  of  my\r\n\r\ndiscretionary  powers under the  Order-in-Council,\r\n\r\nand  in  which  he  expressed the  hope  that  any\r\n\r\namendments   to   the   Constitution   now   under\r\n\r\nconsideration  could  be deferred  for  discussion\r\n\r\nwith   him   during  his  forthcoming   visit   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel bound to place on record my regret that\r\n\r\nthe  issue of an amendment to our new Constitution\r\n\r\nshould have been raised in this way, namely on  a\r\n\r\nrelatively minor matter concerning the appointment\r\n\r\nof  four  Assistant Ministers, and that it  should\r\n\r\nhave  been raised at a time when it may very  well\r\n\r\njeopardise the progress which has been made in the\r\n\r\nlast  three  and  a  half months  by  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I consider that it will  be  a  great\r\n\r\npity if this record of progress, and the prospects\r\n\r\nof  stable government, bringing, confidence to the\r\n\r\ncommunity, are lost as a result of the  issue  now\r\n\r\nraised.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had copies prepared. They will be distributed now to hon. Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the Governor's message distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDER 31 (7) AND (8)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I intend to give my wholehearted help and\r\n\r\nguidance  to  the  Council of  Ministers  in  the\r\n\r\nexecution  of their policies and in the  task  of\r\n\r\nrunning the Government of Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the words, Sir, the first words which\r\n\r\nSingapore heard from our Governor on the  occasion\r\n\r\nof  his  installation. \"Significant constitutional\r\n\r\nprogress\";     \"whole-hearted    help\";     brave,\r\n\r\nreverberating   words - words  full   of   wonderful\r\n\r\npromise,  and I fell for each of them, hook,  line\r\n\r\nand sinker. I believed every word, and today, Sir,\r\n\r\nI   find  that  this  \"significant  constitutional\r\n\r\nprogress\"  infused  by  this \"whole-hearted  help\"\r\n\r\ngives  us  not even power in so minor  a  domestic\r\n\r\nmatter   as   the   appointment  of  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries, that we call Assistant Ministers. And\r\n\r\nthe  basic  reason - the vital reason - given  by  His\r\n\r\nExcellency  at  an  informal  meeting   with   the\r\n\r\nappointed Ministers for refusing the power lay  in\r\n\r\nthe following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It was never the intention of Her Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment  that this constitution should  provide\r\n\r\nfor  rapid  self-government. It  was  intended  to\r\n\r\nprovide for slow progress.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow progress! This, then, Sir, is the spirit of\r\n\r\nthe  Rendel Constitution - the scraggy hand of death\r\n\r\nclutching at the brakes of progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say to the gentlemen opposite that\r\n\r\nthe tempestuous honeymoon between this side of the\r\n\r\nHouse and theirs is over - the broken crockery,  the\r\n\r\nblack  eyes, the tumultuous recriminations.  Today\r\n\r\nwe  face a common foe. The claws of the beast show\r\n\r\nthrough the velvet glove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not come here today as Chief Minister, as\r\n\r\nhead  of the Government. I have withdrawn the Whip\r\n\r\nfrom my side of the House. I have made it clear to\r\n\r\nevery Member that he will and must speak according\r\n\r\nto  his own conscience, and vote according to  his\r\n\r\nown  lights. I come here today - and I hope you come\r\n\r\nhere   today - as  Malayans,  and  I  speak,  as   a\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of the Malayans of  Cairnhill,  to\r\n\r\nyou,  the representatives of the Malayans  of  the\r\n\r\nrest  of  the  territory - Singapore.  This  is  the\r\n\r\ncommon danger - do we accept the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nposition that this constitution is not to provide\r\n\r\n- repeat not - for rapid self-government? Maybe  what\r\n\r\nhas  happened  in the past fortnight  should  have\r\n\r\nbeen  no  shock  to me. There have been  incidents\r\n\r\nfrom  the  word \"Go\" which should have warned  me,\r\n\r\nand I can tell you of the few that I may tell. The\r\n\r\nrest  that  transpired in the  Council  Chamber  I\r\n\r\ncannot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the very day I was appointed Chief Minister, I\r\n\r\nasked  for  my office and discovered  that  I  had\r\n\r\nneither  office  nor staff nor  even  a  piece  of\r\n\r\nnotepaper. I was told I was Minister for Commerce,\r\n\r\nand  Chief  Minister merely meant that I  was  the\r\n\r\nleader  of the appointed Ministers. I was  further\r\n\r\ntold  I  had  no right of co-ordination  over  the\r\n\r\nother  ministries. That would have been  the  end,\r\n\r\nright  away. Fortunately, common sense  prevailed.\r\n\r\nMy representations were accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then - it may seem to you a minor matter, but it is\r\n\r\nin  the  same  pattern -  I  discovered  at  public\r\n\r\nfunctions that a host of dignitaries, including my\r\n\r\nfriend the Chief Secretary, were supposed to  take\r\n\r\nprecedence  over  me.  The Governor  said  I  must\r\n\r\naccept this position. He (the Chief Secretary) was\r\n\r\nmy  senior. To my own very acute embarrassment,  I\r\n\r\nhad  to  act  like a bad-tempered prima  donna  in\r\n\r\norder that there should be proper respect for  the\r\n\r\npeople  of this territory in the person  of  their\r\n\r\nchief elected representative. That question is not\r\n\r\neven now completely solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the Emergency Regulations, and it was\r\n\r\ngraciously  conceded that we were  in  an  awkward\r\n\r\nposition,  having promised to repeal them,  if  we\r\n\r\nnow  thought that they might be necessary for  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of the people. And as you have read in the\r\n\r\ncorrespondence, it was officially  suggested  that\r\n\r\nwe  should  blithely come to this Chamber,  repeal\r\n\r\nthose Emergency Regulations, gain the credit  from\r\n\r\nour  electors, and then the Governor would  impose\r\n\r\nthem  under  his special powers. That was  perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  biggest shock I have ever suffered - that there\r\n\r\nshould   be   such  contempt  for   the   people's\r\n\r\nrepresentatives; that it should be assumed that we\r\n\r\nwould act in so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfilthy  and dishonest a fashion; cheating  you  on\r\n\r\nthis  side of the House, cheating the public, only\r\n\r\nto  gain  dishonest kudos and  to  evade  our  own\r\n\r\nresponsibility to our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We made it quite clear that if the Governor ever\r\n\r\nused  his  special powers against our advice,  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  would resign en bloc. And now  we  have\r\n\r\nwhat  His  Excellency calls \"the relatively  minor\r\n\r\nmatter of the appointment of Assistant Ministers\".\r\n\r\nNow, please, let us get this straight. We are  not\r\n\r\nconsidering   the  merits  or  demerits   of   the\r\n\r\nappointment of junior Ministers. That will come on\r\n\r\nTuesday on a motion to be moved by the Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was startled this morning to learn from the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times that I am a very astute politician,\r\n\r\nand   it   seems  that  I  am  indulging  in   the\r\n\r\nMachiavellian manoeuvre of enticing  you  to  vote\r\n\r\nfor   this  motion  in  order  to  prejudice  your\r\n\r\nattitude  on  the  motion that  is  coming  up  on\r\n\r\nTuesday.   I   repeat,  this  motion   is   on   a\r\n\r\nconstitutional issue, entirely independent of  the\r\n\r\nmerits  or  demerits of the appointment of  junior\r\n\r\nMinisters, and no person who votes for or  against\r\n\r\nthis motion is in any way bound, or prejudiced  in\r\n\r\nany attitude he may seek to adopt on Tuesday next.\r\n\r\nLet this be quite clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is a letter here. It merely\r\n\r\nconfirms several conversations. My letter  of  the\r\n\r\n20th of July:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Your Excellency,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank you for your letter of yesterday's date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to make it clear that it is no\r\n\r\nlonger  a question of the appointment of Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters - I am prepared to reconsider my advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue as I see it is whether you are to\r\n\r\nexercise  your  discretionary  powers  under   the\r\n\r\nconstitution  in  accordance with  the  advice  of\r\n\r\nthose  whom  you have to consult before exercising\r\n\r\nsuch  powers,  or whether you are free  to  reject\r\n\r\nsuch advice at your will and pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position, gentlemen, is this: that if we are\r\n\r\nto  have  the  responsibility, we  must  have  the\r\n\r\npower. We are not, and will never be, prepared  to\r\n\r\nbe  nothing  but gold-plated shock  absorbers  for\r\n\r\ncolonial rule. We have accepted office in complete\r\n\r\nfaith - that this constitution\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  intended to bridge the present period to  the\r\n\r\nperiod   of  full  self-government  and   ultimate\r\n\r\nindependence.  We  have,  I  think,   demonstrated\r\n\r\nsufficiently, despite the short period, our  sense\r\n\r\nof  responsibility,  believing  that  we  had  the\r\n\r\npower. It must be obvious that if we have not  the\r\n\r\npower, then we can never achieve that standard  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  that  agonising  heart-searching,\r\n\r\nthat   comes  of  having  to  act  on  one's   own\r\n\r\ndecisions.  If  we are nothing but  advisers,  you\r\n\r\ncannot  expect of us the responsibility of rulers.\r\n\r\nThat  responsibility  is expected,  and  has  been\r\n\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time when we contested the elections,\r\n\r\nnobody  was  good  enough to  tell  us  that  this\r\n\r\nconstitution  was never intended by Her  Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment for rapid self-government. In fact, you\r\n\r\nknow,   and  I  know,  we  were  led  to   believe\r\n\r\ncompletely the contrary. For myself, I believed it\r\n\r\nutterly,  completely. Without any reservations,  I\r\n\r\nbelieved. I had studied the constitution.  I  have\r\n\r\nrepeatedly said - and I said it again as a warning\r\n\r\nat  the  installation - that  this  constitution  is\r\n\r\ninadequate, but it is workable. If infused with  a\r\n\r\nspirit of goodwill, it is workable and can  be  an\r\n\r\ninstrument for bridging the present to the  period\r\n\r\nof self-government and independence. I remember at\r\n\r\nthe  very  first  sitting of this Assembly  saying\r\n\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I think it comes ill from us to question the\r\n\r\ngood  faith of a nation that seeks to give us  its\r\n\r\nhand   to   help  us  to  our  feet.  The  present\r\n\r\nconstitution is an earnest of that good  faith.  I\r\n\r\nhave faith in the English.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That was exactly three months ago. I meant it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me say this: if the spirit of generous\r\n\r\ngoodwill  is  to  be  absent,  if  the  spirit  of\r\n\r\nnegation  is  to  direct  the  working   of   this\r\n\r\nconstitution,  I shall no longer  have  faith.  If\r\n\r\nthis constitution were, to me, a sham and a cul-de-sac,  not  a bridge, then, as the P.A.P. have  so\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  maintained,  it  would  have   to   be\r\n\r\ndestroyed - not worked. I am not a destroyer.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  how to. But when the time comes - and  it\r\n\r\nseems  near - that  this  is proved  so,  then,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  you will see me no  more  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technical aspects of the issue immediately\r\n\r\nbefore  us can best be gathered by looking at  the\r\n\r\nmessage from His Excellency, and pointing out  the\r\n\r\nflaws.  May  I  refer  you,  gentlemen,  to   that\r\n\r\nparagraph which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"When the Chief Minister asked me to appoint\r\n\r\nfour  Assistant  Ministers,  I  was  required   by\r\n\r\nSection  32  of  the Order-in-Council  to  consult\r\n\r\nhim...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"and then to exercise my discretion as to\r\n\r\nwhether or not these appointments should be made.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is not correct, and I will prove it to  you.\r\n\r\nSection 32:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Governor after consultation with the Chief Minister may from among the elected\r\n\r\nMembers   in   the   Assembly  appoint   Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters to assist Ministers in the discharge  of\r\n\r\ntheir duties and functions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And it is said the word is \"may\". Gentlemen, if  I\r\n\r\nsay  to  my clerk: \"If the Little Sisters  of  the\r\n\r\nPoor come for a donation, you may give them $100.\"\r\n\r\nDo  I  give him the discretion - to give or  not  to\r\n\r\ngive, to give $50 or $10? I give him an authority.\r\n\r\nThat section 32 is an authority to the Governor to\r\n\r\nappoint - it is not a discretion to the Governor.  I\r\n\r\nhad  hoped that the Hon. the Attorney-General (Mr\r\n\r\nE.  J. Davies) would take part in this debate, but\r\n\r\nI  understand he will not, so I shall leave  those\r\n\r\nbooks, and I will refer to just three, if you will\r\n\r\npermit  me, Sir, as a curiosity, if you  like,  to\r\n\r\nprove  to  you that the word \"may\" in the  English\r\n\r\nlanguage in that context means \"shall\" and \"must\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Mr Chief Minister. I just\r\n\r\nwant  to  find  out whether you  are  making  this\r\n\r\nAssembly the forum for the interpretation  of  the\r\n\r\nOrder in Council. If you are, then you are out  of\r\n\r\norder;  but if you are asking the Assembly for  an\r\n\r\nopinion, of course you are entitled to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> May it please you, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I am indicating to the  Assembly - I\r\n\r\nhope  with  your permission - my own  view  and  the\r\n\r\nbasis on which that view was arrived at, and I  am\r\n\r\nseeking   from   them,  through  my   motion,   an\r\n\r\nexpression  of their own views. Now,  I  know  how\r\n\r\nmuch  ancient legal authority is respected. I have\r\n\r\nnot had much time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  go back for it, but I have got one here - l683 - I\r\n\r\nhope that is old enough, and it says this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord Keeper giving a judgment in the case of\r\n\r\nAlderman Backwell in Vernon's Chancery Reports  at\r\n\r\npage 152:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Lord Keeper declared that though the words\r\n\r\nin  the Act of Parliament were that the Chancellor\r\n\r\nmay grant a commission of bankrupt, yet that 'may'\r\n\r\nwas,  in  effect,  'must',  and  it  had  been  so\r\n\r\nresolved by all judges.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not been able to go back to that case of\r\n\r\nHenry I. But here is another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McDougal and Patterson, 1851. It is reported in\r\n\r\nthe Law Journal, 1852, Court of Common Pleas. This\r\n\r\nis the judgment of the Chief Justice:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The statute which saith that the Chancellor may\r\n\r\ngrant is as if it had been shall grant or ought to\r\n\r\ngrant,  but  he  cannot grant  ex-officio  but  on\r\n\r\nrequest of persons interested.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is explained,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"which we think support the rule that when a\r\n\r\nstatute confers an authority to do a judicial  act\r\n\r\nin  a  certain case, it is imperative on those  so\r\n\r\nauthorised to exercise the authority when the case\r\n\r\narises, and its exercise is duly applied for by  a\r\n\r\nparty interested and having the right to make  the\r\n\r\napplication.  For these reasons,  we  are  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion that the word 'may' is not used to give  a\r\n\r\ndiscretion but to confer a power.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more. The case of the King versus Mitchell,\r\n\r\n1913:  I  King's Bench at page 561; the head  note\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The phrases 'thereupon the Court of Summary\r\n\r\nJurisdiction  may  deal  with  the  case  in   all\r\n\r\nrespects  as if the accused were charged  with  an\r\n\r\nindictable  offence'  and  'the  offence  may   be\r\n\r\nprosecuted  on indictment', the word 'may'  is  an\r\n\r\nenabling word empowering the Court to give  effect\r\n\r\nto the right of the accused.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of cases. If the Governor is\r\n\r\nsupposed to have a discretion, which is alleged on\r\n\r\nhis  behalf,  there are 17 times in the  Order  in\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  79 sections which say: \"The  Governor\r\n\r\nmay in his discretion\". Why could they not put  in\r\n\r\nfor  the  18th time \"may in his discretion\"  after\r\n\r\n\"consultation  with the Chief  Minister\"?  Let  me\r\n\r\nshow you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 15: \"The powers conferred upon the\r\n\r\nGovernor by sections 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of this\r\n\r\nOrder shall be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexercised  by  him acting in his  discretion.\"  If\r\n\r\nthey had wanted \"in his discretion\" in section 32,\r\n\r\ncould  they not have added \"and 32\"? That  is  one\r\n\r\ninstance. You may be sure there are more. I am not\r\n\r\ngoing to read all the seventeen, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 45, Mr Speaker, Sir, says: \"The Governor\r\n\r\nacting  in  his  discretion may appoint  Nominated\r\n\r\nMembers.\" That is interesting, because although he\r\n\r\nacts  \"in his discretion\", nevertheless it is  only\r\n\r\nproper, as in fact you are aware of in this  case,\r\n\r\nthe  Governor  did consult the Chief Minister  and\r\n\r\ndid,  in part, accept his view. He did not  accept\r\n\r\nmy  view completely, but he had the right, because\r\n\r\n\"acting    in    his    discretion\",    he     was\r\n\r\nconstitutionally in the right to reject completely\r\n\r\nmy  opinion, or to accept it in part  as  he  did,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  phrase  is  there - \"acting   in   his\r\n\r\ndiscretion\",   he  shall  appoint  the   Nominated\r\n\r\nMembers.  He consulted me, as he was entitled  to,\r\n\r\nand  as  he should have. In section 32, it is  not\r\n\r\n\"acting  in his discretion\", he shall appoint.  It\r\n\r\nis  \"he  may,  after consultation with  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you just one more, and this is\r\n\r\nparticularly interesting - section 60 (4)  and  (5).\r\n\r\nSection  60  is \"Introduction of Bills\",  and  you\r\n\r\ncannot  introduce certain Bills  except  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernor's permission. I read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Except with the recommendation or consent of\r\n\r\nthe Governor signified thereto, the Assembly shall\r\n\r\nnot  proceed upon any Bill or motion which, in the\r\n\r\nopinion  of  the  Speaker or the Attorney-General,\r\n\r\nrelates  to or affects any of the matters set  out\r\n\r\nin the Third Schedule to this Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers conferred upon the Governor by\r\n\r\nsubsections (3) and (4) of this section  shall  be\r\n\r\nexercised by him acting in his discretion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  that whatever the Attorney-General may say, or\r\n\r\nwhatever the Speaker may say, the Governor has the\r\n\r\nright, after consulting them, to say, \"I act in my\r\n\r\ndiscretion.\"  That  is not what  was  intended  by\r\n\r\nsection 32 and all the other sections. It  is  not\r\n\r\nonly  section  32. The principle is  so  important\r\n\r\nthat  I  would  not  care if I did  not  have  any\r\n\r\nAssistant Ministers for the rest of my term,  such\r\n\r\nas remains of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there we nave the question of discretion.\r\n\r\nThink   of  it  again - \"The  Governor  may,   after\r\n\r\nconsultation, appoint\". Quite obviously, these are\r\n\r\nenabling  powers, because otherwise  the  Governor\r\n\r\nhas   no   power  to  appoint.  And   from   that,\r\n\r\ngentlemen - I hope I am not boring you,  but  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant to this House - we come to Jennings on the\r\n\r\nConstitution  of  Ceylon, Sir Ivor  Jennings,  the\r\n\r\ngreat constitutional lawyer, at page 99:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The other Ministers are appointed by the\r\n\r\nGovernor on the advice of the Prime Minister.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never mind about Ceylon, but just look at the\r\n\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Since the Prime Minister has to establish and\r\n\r\nmaintain a majority, he must have a large  element\r\n\r\nof  discretion, and indeed the last word,  in  the\r\n\r\nformation of his government; but the King, and  to\r\n\r\na  smaller degree the Governor-General,  from  his\r\n\r\nimpartial position, is able to advise and to warn.\r\n\r\nThe  Governor-General's approval should  therefore\r\n\r\nnot   be  regarded  as  a  formality.  The   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's responsibility is a heavy one.  He  has\r\n\r\nto  satisfy  so  many competing  claims  with  the\r\n\r\nknowledge  that  he  may make  more  enemies  than\r\n\r\nfriends.  The  Governor-General may  not  be  very\r\n\r\nfamiliar  with the politics of this  country,  and\r\n\r\nwill  not be able to advise with the authority  of\r\n\r\nthe King ...\" etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come next, gentlemen, to the immediately\r\n\r\nsucceeding paragraph in the Governor's message:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"While, of course, I would at all times give the\r\n\r\ngreatest   weight  to  the  views  of  the   Chief\r\n\r\nMinister,  it will be noted that the  language  of\r\n\r\nSection  32 of the Order-in-Council puts upon  the\r\n\r\nGovernor  merely  the obligation  to  consult  the\r\n\r\nChief Minister.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I have already shown you why not. Further:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... and there is no provision corresponding to\r\n\r\nSection 19 (2) requiring the Governor to  act  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  recommendations  made  by   the\r\n\r\nChief Minister. If it had been intended that  the\r\n\r\nGovernor  must act in accordance with the  advice\r\n\r\ngiven,  express  provision to that  effect  would\r\n\r\nhave been included.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the opposite is quite true too, that if the\r\n\r\nGovernor  had been intended to be able to  act  in\r\n\r\nhis  discretion, express provision would have been\r\n\r\nprovided, as it had been provided 17 other  times,\r\n\r\nand  as it could have been provided in section 15.\r\n\r\nBut let us see why in section 19 (2) there is that\r\n\r\nexpress\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovision.  Now  it is a matter of  constitutional\r\n\r\nlaw and constitutional practice that where you are\r\n\r\nrequired  to  consult  someone,  you  act  on  his\r\n\r\nadvice,   and  that  being  so,  it  was   thought\r\n\r\nimportant  not to leave it at that but to  make  a\r\n\r\nvery vital provision for an exception. That is why\r\n\r\nsection  19  (2)  is there, because  if  you  read\r\n\r\nsection  19  (2)  it  does not  merely  say,  \"The\r\n\r\nGovernor  shall act in accordance with the  advice\r\n\r\nof  the Council of Ministers\", but it has provided\r\n\r\nthat  \"if in any case in which he shall be obliged\r\n\r\nto   consult  with  the  Council  concerning   the\r\n\r\nexercise  of any power the Governor shall consider\r\n\r\nit  expedient  in the interests of  public  faith,\r\n\r\npublic order or good government that he should not\r\n\r\nact  in accordance with the advice of the Council,\r\n\r\nthen  he  may act against that advice, but  shall,\r\n\r\nwithout delay, report the matter to a Secretary of\r\n\r\nState  with the reasons for his action.\" The whole\r\n\r\nthing  there - subsection  (2)  of  section  19 -  is\r\n\r\naround  that exception to the duty of the Governor\r\n\r\nto  act in accordance with constitutional practice\r\n\r\nto  accept  the advice of his Council. It  is  not\r\n\r\nintroducing a principle of interpretation; it is a\r\n\r\nprinciple  of constitutional law that requires  no\r\n\r\nintroduction.  But  it  is  for  introducing  that\r\n\r\nproviso  that you have that immediately  preceding\r\n\r\nparagraph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have this in the Governor's message:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Chief Minister now contends that I should\r\n\r\ninterpret the exercise of my discretionary  powers\r\n\r\nin  a manner which would amount to an amendment of\r\n\r\nthe Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now an amendment to a written constitution, as I\r\n\r\nunderstand it, is a written amendment. What I seek\r\n\r\nhere  is  no  amendment at all. It  is  merely  an\r\n\r\nacceptance    of    the   normal    constitutional\r\n\r\ninterpretation. It is an acceptance of a spirit of\r\n\r\ngenerous  interpretation in favour of the people's\r\n\r\nelected representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Excellency ends up on the point that he\r\n\r\nregrets  that a constitutional issue  should  have\r\n\r\nbeen raised on a minor matter. Gentlemen, I accept\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nposition that, whether I have additional Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters  or no, it is not vital; but  it  is,  I\r\n\r\nsincerely believe, conducive to the welfare of the\r\n\r\npeople.  And  I  repeat: if he would  concede  the\r\n\r\nprinciple,   I  am  prepared  to  reconsider   the\r\n\r\nquestion of Assistant Ministers. It is not a minor\r\n\r\nmatter - the   constitutional   issue - but   if   the\r\n\r\nappointment  of Assistant Ministers is  so  minor,\r\n\r\nthen  there  is  all  the  more  reason  why   His\r\n\r\nExcellency  should not interfere in  the  domestic\r\n\r\nconduct  of his Ministers. Let me add this:  I  am\r\n\r\nvery  happy it is a minor matter. It is, in  fact,\r\n\r\none  on  which there are many gentlemen, not  only\r\n\r\nthose  opposite me but in the country - many  honest\r\n\r\npeople - who disagree with me - the question whether I\r\n\r\nshould have the Assistant Ministers named for  the\r\n\r\nposts  indicated. Consequently  there  can  be  no\r\n\r\nemotional  content aroused about my being  refused\r\n\r\nbecause  of the immediate issue, and I would  much\r\n\r\nprefer  that that should be so, rather  than  that\r\n\r\nthe issue should be raised on a far more important\r\n\r\nmatter  which  would arouse the  emotions  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry,  already  exacerbated by  frustration  so\r\n\r\nnear to the surface as has been recently proved. I\r\n\r\nwould rather take the position of disadvantage and\r\n\r\nfight the principle on a minor matter. But it is a\r\n\r\nmajor  principle  which may probably  have  tragic\r\n\r\nconsequences  if it is sought to  raise  it  on  a\r\n\r\nmatter that would emotionally affect the people of\r\n\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have taken the liberty of strewing this\r\n\r\ndesk with legal authorities, seeking to prove that\r\n\r\nHis Excellency was ill-advised in taking the stand\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  any necessity for  amendment;  in\r\n\r\ntaking  the  stand  that,  in  fact,  he   has   a\r\n\r\nconstitutional  discretion. But I should  like  to\r\n\r\ntake  it now on the far broader basis - on the human\r\n\r\nbasis  of  the people of this territory.  We  have\r\n\r\nwaited  for this moment. We have believed in  this\r\n\r\nconstitution.  Never  mind  about  the   gentlemen\r\n\r\nopposite.   We  have  believed  in  it,  sincerely\r\n\r\nbelieved  in  it, and we have wanted to  work  it,\r\n\r\nstraining every nerve in our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbody to make an honest job of it. I have said that\r\n\r\nto apply a restrictive, unimaginative construction\r\n\r\nto  this  constitution on the basis  that  it  was\r\n\r\nnever  intended  that we should have  rapid  self-government is to destroy all faith and to  destroy\r\n\r\nall possibility of peaceful progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for that reason, Sir that I am appealing to\r\n\r\nthis  House that I have taken the liberty to  call\r\n\r\nthis House, on a matter of urgency, to debate  not\r\n\r\nthe  legal technicalities, but the spirit in which\r\n\r\nwe  are  in  future to proceed. I am  asking  this\r\n\r\nHouse  to  appeal to the Governor to redirect  his\r\n\r\nsteps, whatever may have been the intention of the\r\n\r\nframers  of the constitution and of Her  Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment at the time the constitution was given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be recognised that today it is\r\n\r\nimperative that the dynamically evolving political\r\n\r\nlife  of  this country should be recognised,  that\r\n\r\nour  abilities for responsibility and power should\r\n\r\nbe  recognised, and that this constitution and any\r\n\r\nother constitution to follow should be interpreted\r\n\r\nin  the broadest and most generous sense possible,\r\n\r\nin favour of the people's elected representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this spirit that I have come before you,\r\n\r\nSir,  and  taken  the  liberty  of  calling  other\r\n\r\nMembers  away  from their jobs  to  come  here  to\r\n\r\nconsider the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first part of the motion says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the Speaker do convey to His Excellency\r\n\r\nthe  Governor  the  view of this  House  that  the\r\n\r\npeople   of  Singapore  are  determined   to   end\r\n\r\ncolonialism  and to rule themselves through  their\r\n\r\nelected representatives.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, I do not need to debate that any more than I\r\n\r\nneed to debate the fact that the blood in my veins\r\n\r\nis red, or to fear a single dissenting voice in\r\n\r\nthis House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the motion says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"And that as a demonstration of the good faith\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>because it is now a question of good faith, not a\r\n\r\nquestion of constitution. I took the constitution,\r\n\r\nbelieving in the good faith that infused it, and\r\n\r\nknowing how it could be worked. But it is not\r\n\r\nbeing worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"And that as a demonstration of the good faith\r\n\r\nof  Her  Majesty's Government in its  oft-repeated\r\n\r\npromise  to  the people of Malaya that they  would\r\n\r\ngrant  self-government  at the  earliest  possible\r\n\r\nmoment,  the  most  liberal  construction  legally\r\n\r\npermissible    in    favour   of    the    elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives    of   the    people    in    the\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of the Singapore Colony  Order  in\r\n\r\nCouncil. 1955, should be adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next one, Sir, follows from it; but since we\r\n\r\nare expected to dot our  i's and cross our t's,  I\r\n\r\nhave  put  it  in.  It may be  tautologous  to  a\r\n\r\nlawyer,  because the next really  flows  from  the\r\n\r\nfirst  one.  If the provisions of the constitution\r\n\r\nare to be construed in a manner most liberally  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of  the  people's elected representatives,\r\n\r\nthen  the  next one, that where the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nis  to  be consulted the power should be exercised\r\n\r\nin accordance with such advice, naturally follows.\r\n\r\nBut  let  us get this straight, Mr Speaker,  Sir.\r\n\r\nThere  are  many sections in which His  Excellency\r\n\r\nhas to consult the Chief Minister. You may say  it\r\n\r\nis dangerous, but he has always this expedient: \"I\r\n\r\ndismiss  him.\" Short and simple. If you  put  that\r\n\r\nsafeguard - and  it  is there - if  that  attitude  of\r\n\r\ninterpretation is adopted, then there  will  be  a\r\n\r\nfar  greater sense of responsibility in  rejecting\r\n\r\nadvice,  just as there must be a greater sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility in offering advice, because on  the\r\n\r\nadvice  offered, the Chief Minister must act;  and\r\n\r\non rejecting the advice offered, the Governor must\r\n\r\nseek  to form a new government. It is only at that\r\n\r\nheight and accepting the fact that power goes with\r\n\r\nresponsibility,   and   that   both   power    and\r\n\r\nresponsibility - in their real character - should  be\r\n\r\nvested  in the people of this country that we  can\r\n\r\nevolve in any fashion towards self-rule: not  just\r\n\r\ndriving Daimlers with liveried chauffeurs and flags\r\n\r\nand  palatial houses; mansions to be built for the\r\n\r\nChief Minister to entertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said at the beginning that today I am\r\n\r\nnot  here  as  head  of the Government  arguing  a\r\n\r\npolitical  case. I come as a Malayan  speaking  to\r\n\r\nfellow  Malayans. I have sought,  on  a  non-party\r\n\r\nbasis, to obtain the approval of this motion  from\r\n\r\none   who  could  be  termed  the  leader  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA de jure leader of the Opposition, there is none.\r\n\r\nBut  one  gentleman  opposite has  plagued  me  so\r\n\r\nconsistently  and so vociferously in the  past - and\r\n\r\nhe  is an able man - that he is virtually the leader\r\n\r\nof  the  Opposition in the eyes of the  public.  I\r\n\r\nrefer  to  the Member for Tanjong Pagar  (Mr  Lee\r\n\r\nKuan  Yew).  I have said to him that I would  like\r\n\r\nhim  to  rise,  in  the  name  of  the  people  he\r\n\r\nrepresents  and - with respect to the others - as  the\r\n\r\nde  facto leader of the Opposition, to second this\r\n\r\nmotion.

Like the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister,  I  find it difficult  to  imagine  that\r\n\r\nanyone  could  disagree  with  the  terms  of  the\r\n\r\nmotion.  No one can doubt that the people of  this\r\n\r\ncountry  are determined to be rid of the  Colonial\r\n\r\nCivil Service, agents of a European power, serving\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of  a European people  some  8,000\r\n\r\nmiles away. Only a Malayan - an Asian born and  bred\r\n\r\nin  this country, all his life at the wrong end of\r\n\r\nthe  colonial stick - can feel the intensity of  the\r\n\r\nantipathy to foreign control, or the intensity  of\r\n\r\nthat passionate desire to assert control over  his\r\n\r\nown destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy today to join my friends on the other\r\n\r\nside  of the House on this motion.

I am  grateful\r\n\r\nfor  the kind remarks the Chief Minister has  made\r\n\r\ntoday, but, in supporting this motion, I shall not\r\n\r\ndwell  on the legal aspects of the matter,  for  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that the solution is a political and not a\r\n\r\nlegal  one. At the same time I would like  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  I  am  glad he has split the two  issues - the\r\n\r\njunior  Ministers, and this question of principle.\r\n\r\nI   would  find  myself  in  a  very  embarrassing\r\n\r\nposition  if I had in any way to associate  myself\r\n\r\nwith  the  question  of the  appointment,  not  in\r\n\r\nprinciple,  but  the appointment in  practice,  of\r\n\r\nfour  Assistant  Ministers, of  the  four  persons\r\n\r\nnamed to the four Ministries concerned, in a House\r\n\r\nof 25 elected representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meeting is a most solemn occasion - perhaps\r\n\r\nmore solemn than has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen reflected in the fighting speech that we have\r\n\r\njust  heard, for the constitutional principles  at\r\n\r\nstake  are  very  grave.

I went to the people on April 2nd  on  a\r\n\r\ncompletely different programme. I told  them  what\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister was reluctantly compelled  to\r\n\r\ntell   them   today - that  this   constitution   is\r\n\r\ninadequate.  But  whatever  the  permutations  and\r\n\r\ncombinations  of  Progressives, Independents,  and\r\n\r\ndeserters  from  other ranks, no  coalition  could\r\n\r\ngive this constitution any chance, if it ever  had\r\n\r\nany, of working.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second alternative is to suspend the\r\n\r\nconstitution.  I  know two groups  of  people  who\r\n\r\nwould  cheer with joy at this.

In British\r\n\r\nGuiana,  perhaps, one could get away with it.  But\r\n\r\nin  Malaya, in Asia, I say to Mr Sutherland  that\r\n\r\nthe  choice lies between a Communist Malaya,  with\r\n\r\nall  that  that  implies, and an independent  non-Communist   Malaya,  passionately  determined   to\r\n\r\npreserve  and produce wealth for its own citizens;\r\n\r\nnot  prepared to accept any direction  or  control\r\n\r\nfrom  outside, but willing to trade and deal  with\r\n\r\ntheir former masters on equal and friendly terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third alternative would be fresh elections.\r\n\r\nThere  are three possible consequences if we  have\r\n\r\nfresh elections.

Or  there  could   be   an\r\n\r\nelection  with this constitutional  issue  as  the\r\n\r\nonly plank in the election platform of all Parties\r\n\r\nwho  vote for this motion. Then you would  have  a\r\n\r\nnew  constitutional crisis, with round-table talks\r\n\r\nbefore this Assembly is even convened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first possibility, a Progressive victory, is\r\n\r\nthe  one that would suit Britain best.

To  illustrate\r\n\r\nwhy in my opinion it would crash to the ground,  I\r\n\r\nam   pursuing  to  its  logical  conclusions   the\r\n\r\npossible developments out of this situation. I  am\r\n\r\npointing   out   now  that  a  Progressive   Party\r\n\r\nGovernment,  after  a fresh general  election,  to\r\n\r\nwork  the constitution, which could only have been\r\n\r\nworked by them, is not possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other alternative which might come out of a\r\n\r\nfresh  election is for us to go back and fight  on\r\n\r\nthe  same  old issues, and we shall come  back  in\r\n\r\nroughly  the same proportions. The Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nwould  then be in the unhappy position, after  all\r\n\r\nthe  heat, the sound and fury of the hustings,  of\r\n\r\nbeing  back to where he started. Sir,  in  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation,  we  go  back again  to  either  a  new\r\n\r\ncoalition  or a suspension of the constitution - two\r\n\r\nalternatives on which I have already dwelt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other possible outcome of a fresh\r\n\r\nelection,  and  one which those who  support  this\r\n\r\nmotion  will have seriously to consider, if  there\r\n\r\nis  no solution to this constitutional dispute, is\r\n\r\nfor those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParties and individuals who support this motion to\r\n\r\ngo  back  to the country and fight on this  issue,\r\n\r\nand  this  issue alone. When 25 people  have  been\r\n\r\nreturned  with  a  mandate to  negotiate  on  this\r\n\r\nissue,  we  shall  then have a new  constitutional\r\n\r\nposition,   and   we   shall  face   the   British\r\n\r\nGovernment,  not  in Singapore but  in  Whitehall,\r\n\r\nwith  a solid phalanx of representatives who  have\r\n\r\nbeen directed to do a specific task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

But   the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party would even fight with him on\r\n\r\nthis  issue,  \"He  must take the Chief  Minister's\r\n\r\nadvice - now!\"  We would fight  an  election  with\r\n\r\nhim.  But such a situation, within four months  of\r\n\r\nthe  constitution,  is unnecessary.  It  would  be\r\n\r\nunfortunate  because, much as the Chief  Secretary\r\n\r\n(Mr  Goode)  would like to believe that  I  am  a\r\n\r\nwicked and evil person, who would have no more joy\r\n\r\nthan to wreck this whole constitution, I would say\r\n\r\nthis:  if  the Chief Minister feels he could  work\r\n\r\nthis  constitution, if it is worked in the  spirit\r\n\r\nin  which  he  thinks it ought to be,  then  every\r\n\r\nopportunity should be given to allow him  to  work\r\n\r\nit.  Speaking for myself, I do not for one  moment\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the People's Action Party could  sit\r\n\r\nin  conference  with His Excellency the  Governor,\r\n\r\ngovern  within the framework of this constitution,\r\n\r\nand  do  the  things we want to do.  But  that  is\r\n\r\nanother matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us today, it is important to realise that\r\n\r\nthe issues are grave, and it is important that  we\r\n\r\nshould  make this clear to the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  to  Her  Majesty's  Government.  I  find   it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to believe that if they are  acquainted\r\n\r\nwith  the facts, that if they understand the grave\r\n\r\nimplications of a breakdown over such a relatively\r\n\r\nminor   issue,   they  will  be   unyielding   and\r\n\r\nunrelenting.  There  are times  and  places  where\r\n\r\nrattling  the  sabre would work,  but  Malaya  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  in 1955 are neither the place  nor  the\r\n\r\ntime for that. No nation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan more skilfully and gracefully withdraw from  a\r\n\r\ndifficult  and  embarrassing  situation  than  the\r\n\r\nBritish.  They have more skill and more experience\r\n\r\nthan my friend opposite, the Chief Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, it is not impossible, if there is\r\n\r\nreasonableness  and  common-sense,   to   find   a\r\n\r\nsolution  which  could be honourably  accepted  by\r\n\r\nboth   Her  Majesty's  Government  and  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister and his colleagues. We, Sir, have  always\r\n\r\nsaid that this constitution was inadequate. I said\r\n\r\nonce,  in  an election forum broadcast,  that  the\r\n\r\ntask  of the People's Action Party in the Assembly\r\n\r\nwould  be  to  expose,  expose,  and  expose,  the\r\n\r\nhollowness  and hypocrisy of it all.  But  I  must\r\n\r\nconfess that not even in my wildest dreams could I\r\n\r\nhave  envisaged  such a delightfully  embarrassing\r\n\r\nposition for my friends on the other side  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse.  Three months ago the Chief Minister  stood\r\n\r\nbefore  us  there, and, in his most solemn  court-room  manner,  glared at us so  intently  that  we\r\n\r\nnearly  trembled, and as he, in  a  most  dramatic\r\n\r\ngesture, took off his heavy spectacles, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We have come here as one Government - elected\r\n\r\nMinisters,    nominated    Ministers,     official\r\n\r\nMinisters.\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I   had  my  doubts  and  my  misgivings  on  that\r\n\r\noccasion.  I  tried to point out  the  differences\r\n\r\nbetween  them - that they were the Queen's men,  the\r\n\r\nthree  of  them, and perhaps another, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Communications and Works (Mr Thomas). I  was\r\n\r\ngenerous - partly  the Queen's man  and  partly  the\r\n\r\nChief Minister's man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

But\r\n\r\ncould we not have avoided all this if we had  gone\r\n\r\nin,  not  so much in an exuberance of good  faith,\r\n\r\nbut  with  cold, calculating logic? If the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront felt that, limited as the constitution  was,\r\n\r\nit  could be worked for their programme, for their\r\n\r\naims and\r\n\r\nobjects,  then let us find a way out to make  this\r\n\r\nexperiment succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that occasion the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nreminded   us  that  the  Government  honoured   a\r\n\r\nprinciple   known   as   \"collective   Ministerial\r\n\r\nresponsibility\". On that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noccasion  he  went out of his way, personally,  to\r\n\r\nundertake  an  odious  duty  on  behalf   of   his\r\n\r\ncolleague - his  then colleague - the Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary,  of justifying the continuance  of  the\r\n\r\nEmergency Regulations. He was a brave and,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  a sincere man. He took upon himself  the\r\n\r\nfull  burden of his office in the full  spirit  of\r\n\r\nsincerity,  to  which  only  he  could  give  such\r\n\r\nintensity  of expression. I could not express,  as\r\n\r\nhe  has  done  on  so  many  occasions,  how  much\r\n\r\nconfidence  he had - one, in the constitution;  two,\r\n\r\nin  the  good faith of the people who would  watch\r\n\r\nover the constitution, the British Government and\r\n\r\nthe  British officials with whom he has  to  work.\r\n\r\nThey  must feel it is a matter of regret  that  he\r\n\r\nshould,  at this hour, ask for a demonstration  of\r\n\r\ntheir good faith. I support that motion because  I\r\n\r\nfeel   he  is  justified,  if  not  on  the  legal\r\n\r\ninterpretation,  then on the  political  principle\r\n\r\ninvolved, in asking for good faith, and in  giving\r\n\r\nan  interpretation to this Order in Council  which\r\n\r\ncould help it work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a little disappointed earlier at this\r\n\r\nsitting when the Chief Minister said that  he  had\r\n\r\ntaken off the Whip. I would have liked to see  his\r\n\r\nOfficial  Ministers,  having dissented  from  him,\r\n\r\ncome  here and speak and vote for him, as he  said\r\n\r\nonce  upon  a  time they would do.  Sir,  I  never\r\n\r\nbelieved it. Maybe it is because I have so  little\r\n\r\nfaith  in  colonial administrations.  If  we  were\r\n\r\nwicked and evil men, we would incite and instigate\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister and the Colonial Secretary,  I\r\n\r\nbeg  his  pardon, the Chief Secretary, the Officer\r\n\r\nAdministering  the  Government  now  turned  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary, to smash this constitution and  suspend\r\n\r\nit,  and  let the issue be a straight one, between\r\n\r\nCommunism  and Colonialism. Very few  people  have\r\n\r\ndoubts  as  to what the result of such  a  contest\r\n\r\nwould be, though not many would be bold enough  to\r\n\r\nexpress   it   publicly.  I  hope  that   such   a\r\n\r\ncatastrophe will never come to pass. I hope that a\r\n\r\nreasonable  and sensible solution will  be  worked\r\n\r\nout  between the British Government and the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  and  his colleagues.

The  rest  are\r\n\r\nprobably, in his view, stooges - I think that is the\r\n\r\nword used - but I am glad to see that he has not yet\r\n\r\ngot round to calling them \"running-dogs\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 39 of the Rendel Report reads as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If the principle of Nominated Members is\r\n\r\naccepted,  we consider that the widest measure  of\r\n\r\ndiscretion  should  be left  to  the  Governor  in\r\n\r\nexercising this power of nomination, in order that\r\n\r\nhe  may  be  free to appoint Members qualified  to\r\n\r\nvoice or defend whatever interests he may consider\r\n\r\nin   danger   of  being  overlooked,   and   whose\r\n\r\nappointment  would, in his view, be  to  the  best\r\n\r\ninterests of the Colony at the time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not pretend that the cap fits me\r\n\r\nperfectly, and although I hold no mandate from any\r\n\r\nperson  or  group, I think I might  claim,  on  an\r\n\r\noccasion like this, to speak for my own people - the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpatriate  British of this Colony.  And  we  are,\r\n\r\nafter  all,  a section of the people. All  Parties\r\n\r\nclaim  to  speak  for  the people.  There  is  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party people; there are the Labour\r\n\r\nFront   followers.  My  people  may  not  all   be\r\n\r\nworkers - they work too hard for that - but  no  doubt\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister will in due course make  quite\r\n\r\nclear what he means by \"the people\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of its new and sinister connotations, it\r\n\r\nwould  be  nice if that odious word \"colonialism\",\r\n\r\nand  also  the  two words preceding it,  could  be\r\n\r\nexcised  from  the motion. It would not  make  any\r\n\r\ndifference to the motion. I am still not moving an\r\n\r\namendment,  Sir. Colonialism - that wicked,  corrupt\r\n\r\nsystem  which  is at the root of all  our  evils.\r\n\r\nYet,  I believe that there are thousands of Asians\r\n\r\nin this island who have had very little, and still\r\n\r\nhave  little, to complain of under colonial  rule,\r\n\r\nand  I  do not believe that, as the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nonce stated that Professor Silcock was supposed to\r\n\r\nhave  said, they have been unbelievably  corrupted\r\n\r\nthereby.  I  would suggest to the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nthat  it would have greatly benefited himself  and\r\n\r\nhis Party if he had concentrated on selling to the\r\n\r\npublic  the idea of self-government by proving  by\r\n\r\ndeeds that his Government is efficient, instead of\r\n\r\nperiodically  adding fuel to  the  fire  of  anti-colonialism.  The Coalition Government  cannot,  I\r\n\r\nthink,   point  with  any  great  pride   to   its\r\n\r\nachievements  in  its  three  months  of   office,\r\n\r\nalthough   admittedly  they  were  very  difficult\r\n\r\nmonths.  The dynamism of the Chief Minister  calls\r\n\r\nforth the admiration of all of us; but many of his\r\n\r\nMinisters  are  men without any great  experience,\r\n\r\nand  the  public in Singapore are quite  genuinely\r\n\r\nperturbed about the idea of appointing some of his\r\n\r\nLabour  Back-benchers to the  posts  of  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters.  Ask  whom  you  will,  Sir,  in   this\r\n\r\nbeautiful  island - the  Chief  Minister  is  always\r\n\r\nreminding  us that our island is beautiful;  well,\r\n\r\nit  is  not without charm, but it is nothing  very\r\n\r\nwonderful; in fact, much\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof its beauty is man-made, including the taming of\r\n\r\nthe jungle by colonial pioneers -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Without the coolies?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

My  own\r\n\r\nScottish ancestors fought the English for hundreds\r\n\r\nof  years  and only gave up, of course,  when,  by\r\n\r\nsuccessful  infiltration they realised that  union\r\n\r\nwas definitely to their advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have many Asian friends in this city - at least\r\n\r\nI think I have - and I personally do not wish to see\r\n\r\nthe  colonial regime retained any longer  than  is\r\n\r\nnecessary.

Sir, I have  carefully\r\n\r\nperused  the correspondence exchanged between  His\r\n\r\nExcellency  the  Governor and the Chief  Minister,\r\n\r\nand when I read it at home - it was delivered to  my\r\n\r\nhouse at 7 o'clock in the evening - it certainly did\r\n\r\nall  sound  to  me  like a  storm  in  a  tea-cup.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as this sitting of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssembly bears witness, it is very far from  that.\r\n\r\nBut,  without fear of being called a sycophant,  I\r\n\r\nagree with His Excellency's interpretation of  the\r\n\r\nOrder  in  Council;  and  incidentally  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister's  forensic erudition in  the  matter  of\r\n\r\n\"may\"  and  \"must\", I am afraid, leaves  me  quite\r\n\r\ncold.  I cannot really believe that the word \"may\"\r\n\r\nin  section 32 means \"shall\". Anyway,  Sir,  I  am\r\n\r\nsaying,  without fear of being called a sycophant,\r\n\r\nI  agree  with His Excellency's interpretation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Order in Council. If I did not believe it,  I\r\n\r\nwould say so with the plainness of plainness,  but\r\n\r\nI sincerely believe it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second part of the motion, in my\r\n\r\nopinion,   no  demonstration  of  good  faith   is\r\n\r\nnecessary.  Self-government  will  come,  but  not\r\n\r\novernight.  Can  anyone  deny  that  there  is  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  at  the  present moment  an  uneasiness\r\n\r\namongst all the business communities and a lack of\r\n\r\nconfidence  which did not exist before?  I  assure\r\n\r\nyou,  Sir, it is true. Some people may doubt  our\r\n\r\nbona fides, but we, the British, who are perhaps a\r\n\r\nlittle  sad at the passing of the colonial regime,\r\n\r\nwhich seemed to us, no doubt mistakenly, to  be  a\r\n\r\njust   and   fair   system,  soon   became   quite\r\n\r\nenthusiastic  about  the idea  of  self-government\r\n\r\nwithin   the   Commonwealth.   The   change    was\r\n\r\ninevitable, but also desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister himself has said that he is\r\n\r\nconvinced  the English are conscious of the  evils\r\n\r\nof colonial rule. Well, it seems a pity to me that\r\n\r\nhe  is  beginning to doubt the good faith  of  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's Government, just because he does not see\r\n\r\neye   to   eye   with   the   Governor   over   an\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of  the  Order  in   Council.   In\r\n\r\nWhitehall  they have a great deal of  wisdom  and\r\n\r\nexperience,  as even the Member for Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nhas  granted,  and I believe they are  anxious  to\r\n\r\ngrant   these   territories  self-government   and\r\n\r\nindependence. But, in my opinion, the flogging  of\r\n\r\nthe anti-colonial horse by the Chief Minister, and\r\n\r\n\"Malayanisation or bust\", whatever that  may  mean\r\n\r\nby  the People's Action Party - a curious expression\r\n\r\nto come from a lawyer! - these things do nothing but\r\n\r\nretard the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all their histrionics will convince a great\r\n\r\ndeal   of  the  people  in  Singapore  otherwise.\r\n\r\nBesides,  all  that has been said about  colonial\r\n\r\nrule is far from true, and some of the utterances\r\n\r\nin the Press have been positively mendacious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has said - he said it this\r\n\r\nmorning - that the Rendel Constitution is workable,\r\n\r\nbut   is   unworkable  when  you  have   arrogant\r\n\r\ncolonialism in power and in the saddle.  Now,  to\r\n\r\nme, the statement makes no sense at all. It seems\r\n\r\nto   me  that  it  is  his  Government  that   is\r\n\r\ndisplaying  the  arrogance.  Some  of  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister's  statements have been so naive  as  to\r\n\r\nmake  even  political tyros  like  myself  laugh.\r\n\r\nThere was some reference to a football team,  and\r\n\r\nhe  discovered, quite late, that he was not  the\r\n\r\ncaptain  of it. He discovered also, rather  late,\r\n\r\nthat the Rendel Constitution did not make him, in\r\n\r\nfact, the  Prime  Minister. Well,  what  did  he\r\n\r\nexpect? There has never been any suggestion  that\r\n\r\nthe  implementation  of the  Rendel  Constitution\r\n\r\nwould  give this country self-government. At  one\r\n\r\ntime  I  thought his idea was that he  would  be\r\n\r\nquite content with self-government in four years.\r\n\r\nNow,  over some minor issue, everyone is storming\r\n\r\nand  raging  for  self-government immediately.  I\r\n\r\nreally cannot understand it. After all, the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  must see before him every day,  on  the\r\n\r\nletterheads, the words \"Colony of Singapore\".  It\r\n\r\nis still a British Colony, you know, but a lot of\r\n\r\npeople seem to have forgotten it. I hope it never\r\n\r\nbecomes  a  colony  of  any other  power,  either\r\n\r\noccidental or oriental. Now the Chief Minister is\r\n\r\ntrying to mould the Rendel Constitution nearer to\r\n\r\nhis heart's desire -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

I feel that the people of Singapore  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  deceived by that. I know they have  not\r\n\r\nbeen hoodwinked by such an intention of that Party\r\n\r\nto  gain more power. Indeed, today, we should have\r\n\r\nbeen  standing  in this House discussing  actually\r\n\r\nwhat  should not be the motion that is before  us,\r\n\r\nbut  probably  a  motion on  the  censure  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  on what the Chief Minister has  termed\r\n\r\n\"a  very  minor matter\".

It  is  no  more  the  issue  that   was\r\n\r\nintended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has now shifted his ground,\r\n\r\nand  put forward an ideal to the people, an  ideal\r\n\r\nwhich  the  people stand for, in order  to  cloak\r\n\r\nwhat has been a failure behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, you would ask whether this thing,\r\n\r\nwhich  is called a very minor affair, should  have\r\n\r\ndeveloped  into  one  that  is  considered  as   a\r\n\r\nconstitutional crisis. It is very generally  known\r\n\r\nin  Singapore that right from the very word  \"go\",\r\n\r\nthere had been dissension within the ranks of  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front  group and that  dissension  was  no\r\n\r\nother  than  over the distribution of  portfolios,\r\n\r\nand  that unless something was being done  by  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister, there would have been threats  of\r\n\r\ndesertion from the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

The\r\n\r\ncrisis  is  unnecessary and unreasonable.  It  is\r\n\r\nunnecessary because the Chief Minister  sees  fit\r\n\r\nto twist the issue of whether or not a Government\r\n\r\nof  eighteen Members should be allowed as many as\r\n\r\nfourteen Ministers into a constitutional  wrangle\r\n\r\nas  to  whether  the Governor or the  Council  of\r\n\r\nMinisters  has the last word in all matters.  The\r\n\r\ntwo  questions  cannot  be  separated  from  each\r\n\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Progressive stand is the same as that of\r\n\r\nmany  Members of the Opposition, the same as that\r\n\r\nof  the majority of Press comments, and the  same\r\n\r\nas  that  of  the  overwhelming  bulk  of  public\r\n\r\nopinion,  namely, that it is not in the interests\r\n\r\nof  good government to have fourteen Ministers in\r\n\r\na House of thirty-two, of which only eighteen are\r\n\r\non  the  side of the Government, particularly  as\r\n\r\nthe   intention   is  to  add   inexperience   to\r\n\r\ninexperience, or to use this issue to work  up  a\r\n\r\nconstitutional  crisis.  The  substantive  motion\r\n\r\nbefore this House today attempted to obscure this\r\n\r\nfact,  and it is a political manoeuvre, the  type\r\n\r\nof  which this country is getting somewhat tired,\r\n\r\nmanufactured to forestall the motion put down  by\r\n\r\nthe Opposition Parties and due for debate in this\r\n\r\nHouse next week. This is the issue, and no amount\r\n\r\nof  statements and contradictions  by  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister can obscure this fact, this simple fact.\r\n\r\nI  am  convinced  that the public  has  not  been\r\n\r\nmisled,  even if the Chief Minister has  now  the\r\n\r\nassistance of the Member for Tanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the amendment now before us, because\r\n\r\nthe  substantive motion, if approved, could  lead\r\n\r\nto   a  revolution  and  not  evolution  in   our\r\n\r\nconstitutional progress, and could encourage  the\r\n\r\nconcept  that government is to be based,  not  on\r\n\r\ndemocratic    but   autocratic    methods.    The\r\n\r\nfundamental point is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether  to  vote  for  or  against  the  present\r\n\r\nconstitution, or whether to vote for  or  against\r\n\r\ncolonialism - in this Chamber, a few months ago,  I\r\n\r\nstated  that the Progressive Party had done  more\r\n\r\nthan  any other Party to send colonialism on  its\r\n\r\nway  out - but whether to vote for or against a new\r\n\r\nbrand of rule fashioned by the Chief Minister  to\r\n\r\nsuit  himself and nobody but himself. This  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  vital matter on which each Member  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse must clearly cast his vote according to his\r\n\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the Progressive Party must remind the\r\n\r\nElected  Members of this House, and through  them\r\n\r\nthe  public at large, of one important  fact.  If\r\n\r\nthe constitutional issue is to be provoked as to\r\n\r\nwhether  the Governor or the Council of Ministers\r\n\r\nis  to  rule,  the Chief Minister  has  no  right\r\n\r\nwhatever  to  speak on behalf of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  without the backing of this  Assembly\r\n\r\nin   his   position  of  leader  of  a   minority\r\n\r\nGovernment.   In   this   Assembly,   the   Chief\r\n\r\nMinister's group, the Labour Front as represented\r\n\r\nby ten seats out of thirty-two, owes its majority\r\n\r\nin the House, in the ultimate resort, to the fact\r\n\r\nthat   two  Labour  Front  men  were  chosen   as\r\n\r\nNominated  Members  by the Governor,  and  to  no\r\n\r\nother  fact  whatever. I would remind  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  of  section  47 (1)  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nColony  Order  in Council, 1955, which  reads  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Every Nominated Member of the Assembly shall\r\n\r\nhold  his  seat  therein  during  the  Governor's\r\n\r\npleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Constitutionally speaking, therefore, whether  he\r\n\r\nlikes it or not, the Chief Minister is head of  a\r\n\r\nminority  Party, and retains his  position  in  a\r\n\r\nvery  real  and  double  sense  only  during  the\r\n\r\nGovernor's pleasure. In saying as he has said  in\r\n\r\nhis   letter  dated  the  12th  of  July,   1955,\r\n\r\naddressed to His Excellency:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I, as Chief Minister, responsible to the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore cannot take orders either from Your\r\n\r\nExcellency or from the Colonial Office.\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>he  is arrogating to himself a position which  he\r\n\r\ndoes not, in fact, hold, either according to  the\r\n\r\nletter or the spirit of the constitution.

He has been vacillating  whether  it\r\n\r\nis  workable or not. He has reached two  different\r\n\r\nand   opposite  conclusions.  How  can  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister get down to the serious business  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment?  But he does not want to  resign.  No\r\n\r\nhoney-bee can truthfully say that it does not  like\r\n\r\nhoney.

Our clever  but  not  smart\r\n\r\nChief Minister has brought this motion before  the\r\n\r\nHouse today, but if the lives, honour, welfare and\r\n\r\nthe  well-being of the workers and the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  were  at stake, this motion  could  not\r\n\r\nhave been here. I consider it a joke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaotic state of affairs that the country is\r\n\r\ndrifting  into  is my concern.

He\r\n\r\nhas aptly compared himself to a prima donna. Prima\r\n\r\ndonnas  are full of tantrums and impatient of  any\r\n\r\nopposition  to  their  demands.

Instead of getting down\r\n\r\nto  work  to gain the confidence of the public  in\r\n\r\nhis  Government  and settling  the  many  problems\r\n\r\nbefore  us,  he  has  made a  mountain  out  of  a\r\n\r\nmolehill, and tried to have his way by making  the\r\n\r\nrefusal of two out of the four Assistant Ministers\r\n\r\nhe  asked for a constitutional issue, on which  he\r\n\r\nis prepared to resign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, before he makes this constitutional\r\n\r\nissue,  he  should,  at least, have  obtained  the\r\n\r\nviews  of this House as to whether we are prepared\r\n\r\nto  support  the  appointment of  four  additional\r\n\r\nAssistant  Ministers  or  not.

He  has turned the Assembly  into  a\r\n\r\ncourt-house  and the Members of this Assembly  into\r\n\r\njurors,  and with great ability, he has  tried  to\r\n\r\npersuade  us that, for his convenience,  the  word\r\n\r\n\"may\"  whenever the Governor consults  him  should\r\n\r\nread  \"shall\".

Section 11, Sir, in respect of which  His\r\n\r\nExcellency  must  exercise  his  powers   in   his\r\n\r\ncomplete  discretion,  refers  to  judgeships  and\r\n\r\noffices  of  the Crown - Attorney-Generals,  Judges,\r\n\r\netc.  It  does not refer to the Chief Minister  or\r\n\r\nAssistant  Ministers. The Member for  Paya  Lebar,\r\n\r\nhimself  a  member  of  the  Bar,  himself  having\r\n\r\npractised  at  the Bar, himself  at  one  time  an\r\n\r\nofficer  of  the  law, if he cares  to  reread  it\r\n\r\ncarefully,  will  recognise  that  it  is  not  an\r\n\r\ninstrument  for  supporting his  opposition;  will\r\n\r\nrecognise that that is true and may well  wish  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw a suggestion made to the House which,  if\r\n\r\nbelieved, could certainly mislead it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had thought it my duty, in speaking to this\r\n\r\nHouse, to make clear the legal position as  I  saw\r\n\r\nit.  I do not think I had suggested-and may I  say\r\n\r\nwith  respect, Sir, I think it comes very  ill  to\r\n\r\nsuggest that I have suggested - that I was the  sole\r\n\r\ninterpreter  of this or any other constitution.

What do you think?\r\n\r\nI  think,  if  I may say so, Sir, that  the  words\r\n\r\nwhich  it  is sought to substitute for  the  words\r\n\r\nwhich it is sought to omit are a gratuitous insult\r\n\r\nwholly out of place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, on the motion itself, I have, I\r\n\r\nthought,  in  the plainest language,  pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat  the third paragraph arises out of the second\r\n\r\nparagraph,  and you cannot divorce the third  from\r\n\r\nthe second. If you accept the second which states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"the most liberal construction legally\r\n\r\npermissible    in    favour   of    the    elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives    of   the    people    in    the\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of the Singapore Colony  Order  in\r\n\r\nCouncil,  1955, should be adopted\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>then you  must\r\n\r\naccept  the  third  paragraph,  since  that  is  a\r\n\r\nliberal construction legally permissible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret that in a motion, which I had hoped\r\n\r\nwould  have the support of all Malayans  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse, and which was not intended to be on a Party\r\n\r\nbasis,  there  should  still  proceed  the   Party\r\n\r\noutlook,   and  the  Party  attitude  of   certain\r\n\r\nsections of the opposite Benches. May I say  that\r\n\r\napart  from  the  inconsistency of  accepting  the\r\n\r\nfirst two paragraphs and rejecting the third, as I\r\n\r\nunderstand  it,  according to the  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nProgressive  Party,  inconsistencies  are  their\r\n\r\nmeat  and  drink? Nevertheless,  Sir,  it  is  the\r\n\r\nheight of absurdity to accept the suggestion  that\r\n\r\nyou, Sir, embodying this House, should proceed  to\r\n\r\nmeet  His Excellency, should in the name  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse indicate to him our view that we desire self-government  and independence, our view that  there\r\n\r\nshould be a liberal construction, and leave things\r\n\r\nhanging in the air without reporting back to us\r\n\r\non  the  message that you have delivered  and  the\r\n\r\nmessage that you may receive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know, Sir, whether the hon.

On the definition or interpretation of\r\n\r\na  word,  a  principle often lives  or  dies.  The\r\n\r\nnature of government under law is also a matter of\r\n\r\ndefinition.  Somehow,  it seems  that  definitions\r\n\r\nhave  become unclear in Singapore during the past\r\n\r\nfew   weeks.  It  should  be  very  clear  to  all\r\n\r\nconcerned  in  government  that  Singapore  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger  a  colonial  territory,  but  a  political\r\n\r\nentity in transition towards independence. That is\r\n\r\nthe basic definition which must be understood and\r\n\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, therefore, methods which might be!\r\n\r\nappropriate in a colony are no longer appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe   direction  of  government  in  a  transition\r\n\r\nsociety  is  very different from the direction  of\r\n\r\ngovernment in a colonial society. In a  colony,  a\r\n\r\nfirm hand may be necessary for the maintenance  of\r\n\r\nthe  government. In Singapore, it  should  be  the\r\n\r\nrole  of  appointed  officials to  conciliate  and\r\n\r\nguide. Appointed officials should be eager to turn\r\n\r\nover   responsibility  as  soon  as  the   elected\r\n\r\nofficials  show  they can manage it.  Instead,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore we are witnessing a reassertion  of  the\r\n\r\ninflexible attitudes associated with past colonial\r\n\r\nrule. One belief guided the voters who went to the\r\n\r\npolls  in Singapore's first election a few  months\r\n\r\nago.  One  belief animates all - or almost  all - the\r\n\r\nelected representatives of the people who  sit  in\r\n\r\nthis  House.  That belief is the  conviction  that\r\n\r\nSingapore,   with  the  blessing  of  the   former\r\n\r\ncolonial authority, is moving rapidly towards self-government  and  independence.  But  in  the  past\r\n\r\nweeks,  that cardinal belief has suffered  a  rude\r\n\r\nshock.  The people are beginning to lose faith  in\r\n\r\nthe   promises  which  were  the  basis  of   the\r\n\r\nelections.  The people are beginning  to  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  it is truly the intentions of the  former\r\n\r\ncolonial authority to assist our progress towards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindependence.  This  loss of  faith  is  the  most\r\n\r\ndangerous thing that could happen in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If evolution towards independence proves to be an\r\n\r\nillusion - or  a  deliberate  deception - the  people\r\n\r\nwill  be  forced to listen to the extremists.  The\r\n\r\nextremists advocate a road to independence  which\r\n\r\ncan  only  result in suffering for the people  and\r\n\r\ngreat  losses for all. We still believe  that  the\r\n\r\nextreme path can be avoided. We still hold to  our\r\n\r\nfaith  that  evolution towards independence  is  a\r\n\r\nreality. But that faith has been shaken. It is now\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility of the appointed officials  to\r\n\r\nrestore  that faith - to give us reason to  believe\r\n\r\nas we have already believed. If they do not do so,\r\n\r\nthe cost, I fear, will be grievous for all of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Chief Minister's motion and trust\r\n\r\nthat it will have the desired effect of causing  a\r\n\r\nreconsideration of definitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, many people outside this Assembly\r\n\r\nthink  that what the Labour Front is fighting  for\r\n\r\nis  two  or  four Assistant Ministers,  but  I  am\r\n\r\nsurprised  that in this Assembly there are  a  few\r\n\r\nMembers who still believe this.

Everywhere in the world,  including\r\n\r\nthis country, the people hunger for peace, freedom\r\n\r\nand  democracy,  but  the  policy  of  colonialism\r\n\r\nthroughout  the  world,  in  British  Guiana,  the\r\n\r\nFrench  policy  in  Indo-China and  North  Africa,\r\n\r\nproves  that  freedom and democracy  cannot  exist\r\n\r\nunder colonialism. I hope that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Governor and the colonial officials will learn\r\n\r\nthe  lessons of history quickly for their own good\r\n\r\nand for the good of the people of this country  by\r\n\r\ngranting    the    people   and   their    elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  real  power.  They   are   acting\r\n\r\nagainst history.

If they are  sincere,\r\n\r\nwhy  should  the Governor find it so difficult  to\r\n\r\nact  according to the advice of the elected  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister? The Chief Minister says that the  people\r\n\r\nof Singapore are determined to end colonialism and\r\n\r\nto  rule  themselves.

Neither will he\r\n\r\nfind  it  in European clubs or in police stations,\r\n\r\nor  even  in this Assembly itself. If you want  to\r\n\r\nlearn  the  truth, go among the people,  mix  with\r\n\r\nthem,  learn  their true feelings,  their  deepest\r\n\r\nthoughts,  and then you will find that  everywhere\r\n\r\nin  this  country the people cry  out  from  their\r\n\r\nhearts \"Merdeka!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

It  is  indeed\r\n\r\nunfortunate that these statements of simple  truth\r\n\r\nshould have to be made when the country is in  the\r\n\r\nthroes  of  a  constitutional crisis.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nfashion  these  days to talk, often  and  loosely,\r\n\r\nabout  the  constitution  under  which  the  April\r\n\r\nelections were fought. I warn this House  that  we\r\n\r\nare here as representatives of the various Parties\r\n\r\nwhich  fought  the election. We are here,  for  my\r\n\r\npart for instance, to push through the platform of\r\n\r\nthe  Labour  Front. Whether you gentlemen  on  the\r\n\r\nopposite side propose to assist or hinder us is  a\r\n\r\ndifferent matter. We are here, as I said, to  push\r\n\r\nthrough our Party's platform. This House should be\r\n\r\naware  of its status and not to arrogate to itself\r\n\r\nthe  power  that normally goes with a  Constituent\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to say that the motion before the\r\n\r\nHouse  is in the form as it is at present.  Should\r\n\r\nit   have   sought  in  any  way  to   amend   the\r\n\r\nconstitution, then it would have been my  duty  to\r\n\r\nwarn  this House that this is something  which  is\r\n\r\nnot within our power to do. We accepted the Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution.  We  fought the election  under  the\r\n\r\nRendel  Constitution, and I am one with the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister when he says that the Rendel Constitution\r\n\r\nis   workable,  provided  that  all  the   Parties\r\n\r\nconcerned adjust their minds to the task of taking\r\n\r\nthis  country on the road to self-government. This\r\n\r\nis the Labour Front policy, and we hope to achieve\r\n\r\nour  independence, as the Chief Minister  said  in\r\n\r\nhis  first  speech  in this Assembly,  within  the\r\n\r\nspace  of  four  years.  We  have  worked  to  the\r\n\r\nconstitution  for just four months, and  I  plead\r\n\r\ntoday  to  all those interested in the welfare  of\r\n\r\nSingapore not to throw on the scrap-heap something\r\n\r\nwhich  is a milestone in the path of our march  to\r\n\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are today in the relentless grip of a\r\n\r\nconstitutional crisis. We are today faced with the\r\n\r\nissue of who is to govern,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Party in power or the Governor. May I suggest\r\n\r\nthat  with a liberal interpretation of the  Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution, could we say: Is it possible for the\r\n\r\nParty  in power to rule, assisted by the Governor?\r\n\r\nI  may  be called an optimist, but I have  grounds\r\n\r\nfor my optimism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are today faced with the simple issue that\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister made a recommendation for  the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  four  Assistant  Ministers.   The\r\n\r\nGovernor  thought  that only two  were  necessary.\r\n\r\nThis,  we say, is interference, but I beg  to  say\r\n\r\nthat if this is interference, there have also been\r\n\r\ncases  where  the previous Governor  has  shown  a\r\n\r\nremarkable  degree of co-operation. I refer,  Sir,\r\n\r\nto  the inaugural speech delivered in this Chamber\r\n\r\nby  Sir  John  Nicoll, when he  said  that  multi-lingualism would be introduced in the vehicles  of\r\n\r\nlocal   and  central  government.  Was  this   not\r\n\r\nco-operation?   If   there  is  one   instance   of\r\n\r\ndifference  between the Party  in  power  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernor,  are  there not several instances  where\r\n\r\nthe  Governor had taken his stand with  this  same\r\n\r\nParty?   What  I  say  is  this.  If  the   Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution was workable four months ago when  we\r\n\r\nassumed  office, why should we not, with a  little\r\n\r\npatience  and  understanding,  make  use  of   its\r\n\r\npositive  aspects  to implement  the  platform  on\r\n\r\nwhich  the electorate sent us here? This issue  of\r\n\r\nthe Assistant Ministers has been a sore point with\r\n\r\nthe  public, and I am not so sure that we are wise\r\n\r\nto  persist  with  it.  In fact,  I  welcome  that\r\n\r\nsentence in the letters published yesterday  where\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister says that he is  prepared  to\r\n\r\nreconsider his advice on this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We came here to serve the people and, in that\r\n\r\nservice,  we  are fortunate to find in  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister   one   whose  ability,   integrity   and\r\n\r\nsincerity  have won the admiration of all  of  us.\r\n\r\nThe   Party  thought,  at  one  time,  that  these\r\n\r\nAssistant   Ministerships   were   necessary    to\r\n\r\nstrengthen the Party's chances of implementing its\r\n\r\npolicies. I can say for sure that the Labour Front\r\n\r\nCoalition have changed their minds now. I know\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit will be said that what is at stake today is not\r\n\r\nthe  appointment  of  a  number  of  men  for  the\r\n\r\nAssistant  Ministerships, but the vital principle\r\n\r\nof  who is to govern. It is a matter of regret  to\r\n\r\nme  that  we  should  have  tripped  up  on  this\r\n\r\nprinciple  over the issue of Assistant  Ministers.\r\n\r\nInterference in any manner, I say, is  wrong,  but\r\n\r\nit is indeed a pity that this issue should have so\r\n\r\nclouded our view, and we have forgotten today  how\r\n\r\nit  all  started.  Let me state  flatly  that  the\r\n\r\nelectorate is against the whole idea of  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinistership,  and  we  in  the  Party  like  good\r\n\r\ndemocrats  bow  to this decision and  request  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  not to pursue  this  subject  any\r\n\r\nfurther.  The electorate, too, is of  the  opinion\r\n\r\nthat in no instances where our Party has sought to\r\n\r\nimplement  its election promises has the  Governor\r\n\r\nproved a stumbling block. In fact, on the issue of\r\n\r\nmulti-lingualism, the Governor, Sir  John  Nicoll,\r\n\r\nmet  us  half-way.  Again, in  the  matter  of  the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  the  Commission  to   probe   the\r\n\r\nworkings  of the Public Service, we had  our  way.\r\n\r\nAgain, on the question of land freeze, we had  our\r\n\r\nway.  In  the Labour Code and, in fact,  in  every\r\n\r\nmajor  issue  which we have taken up  during  the\r\n\r\nfour  months we have been in power, we  find  that\r\n\r\nthe  Governor has met us half-way. That proves that\r\n\r\nthe Rendel Constitution is workable, and if it was\r\n\r\nworkable on all these major issues, then  it  will\r\n\r\nbe  workable again and again during the next  four\r\n\r\nyears  we  are in office, and when on the strength\r\n\r\nof  some  fine  achievements, we will  go  to  the\r\n\r\nelectorate again. In view of all this, can we  not\r\n\r\npursue  more  diligently with the suggestion  made\r\n\r\nearlier  by  the Member for Tanjong Pagar  that  a\r\n\r\nmodus  vivendi be sought to make this constitution\r\n\r\nnow  in our hands workable, and to get the Parties\r\n\r\nto  work  together to take this island  along  the\r\n\r\nroad to self-government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, we, the Naval Base Labour Union  and\r\n\r\nthe   people  of  Sembawang,  fully  support   the\r\n\r\nprincipal  motion  moved by  the  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister this morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our stand is against colonialism, and to this end\r\n\r\nwe  shall  relax  neither  our  efforts  nor  our\r\n\r\nstrength.  We are opposed to colonialism,  because\r\n\r\nwe  recognise  it as a running sore  in  our  body\r\n\r\npolitic.

The\r\n\r\nunworkability of the constitution under which  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front  Coalition  Government  has  had  to\r\n\r\nlabour  is  too obvious to require repetition.  We\r\n\r\nhave constantly pointed out the deficiency of  the\r\n\r\nconstitution, and we now see no reason  to  revise\r\n\r\nour  convictions. The constitution is not  adapted\r\n\r\nto   the   interests  of  the  people  ready   for\r\n\r\nindependence. On this issue, our stand is logical\r\n\r\nand clear. We shall strive to our utmost extent to\r\n\r\nsupport  any  political  Party  fighting  for  the\r\n\r\nindependence  of  our country.  The  discretionary\r\n\r\npowers   of  the  Governor  in  Council  are   an\r\n\r\nunnecessary obstacle to the process of  democracy.\r\n\r\nThese powers militate against the interests of the\r\n\r\npeople. If we are to attain our independence, then\r\n\r\nthese  powers can have no place in the Legislature\r\n\r\nof this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore realise only too well the\r\n\r\npolitical     implications     colouring      this\r\n\r\nconstitutional crisis. Any reassertions  of  power\r\n\r\nby  the colonial government will earn the deserved\r\n\r\nhatred and distrust of the people of Singapore. In\r\n\r\nsupporting  the Labour Front Coalition  Government\r\n\r\nin  such a crisis, we do rightly urge the colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment  to justify their promise  of  granting\r\n\r\nindependence to the people of Singapore.  On  this\r\n\r\nissue, the Governor should determine to accept the\r\n\r\nprinciple of government existing primarily for the\r\n\r\npeople;  and where this principle is not  observed\r\n\r\nin  a  colonial country, then democracy becomes  a\r\n\r\nhollow pretence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to  support the motion.
