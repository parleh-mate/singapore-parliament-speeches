Therefore, the  vote  has\r\n\r\nbeen estimated at $4,100 for the following year. It\r\n\r\nis  not the cost of production of Hansard.

One of the cardinal principles\r\n\r\nupon which we must exercise the authority which  is\r\n\r\nvested in us by popular vote, is that it should not\r\n\r\nbe  exercised just because there is a  vote  to  be\r\n\r\nspent.

The purpose was  not\r\n\r\njust to entertain them and to congratulate them  on\r\n\r\nhaving  graduated,  but more important,  to  gather\r\n\r\nthem together in a congenial atmosphere and use the\r\n\r\noccasion to underline the role for which they  were\r\n\r\ngroomed  to play. The reason why we have taken  the\r\n\r\ntrouble  to  acquire these scholarships  -sometimes\r\n\r\nfrom foreign missions and donor foundations -is  to\r\n\r\ngive  them the kind of training in order that  they\r\n\r\nwill  fulfil their duties to the community of which\r\n\r\nthey form a part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having been successful with the first function,\r\n\r\nwe held a second one -a buffet dinner -on 23rd\r\n\r\nApril, 1966,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere  we  had 370 scholars and representatives  of\r\n\r\nforeign  missions who had given these scholarships.\r\n\r\nThe  purpose  was  to express our  appreciation  to\r\n\r\nthese  foreign mission representatives  for  having\r\n\r\ngiven the scholarships to our students for training\r\n\r\npurposes. Similarly a dinner was held on the 1st of\r\n\r\nJuly  last  year. After three successful occasions,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  think it is time that the procedure should\r\n\r\nbe  formalised  in a vote in the  Budget  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

But in so far  as\r\n\r\nwe  are  concerned, we are satisfied  that  such  a\r\n\r\nfunction  does serve a purpose. It does bring  home\r\n\r\nto  these  scholars in a psychologically meaningful\r\n\r\nway  the  fact  that  they  owe  something  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity that has gone out of its way to  organise\r\n\r\nitself   to  train  them,  educate  them  and   get\r\n\r\nscholarships  for  them, and therefore  it  expects\r\n\r\nthem  to give something back to the community.  The\r\n\r\n$3,000  in  the vote is hardly more than the  first\r\n\r\nmonth's  salary of probably four or five  of  these\r\n\r\nstudents.  I think it is worth the effort  that  is\r\n\r\nput in. It is not so much the money; but it takes a\r\n\r\nlot of effort.

In   this\r\n\r\nconnection,  I  shall  be  grateful  if  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister will state the number of scholarships that\r\n\r\nwill be available as against the number this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the reason for the\r\n\r\nestimate being reduced to about 40 per cent of what\r\n\r\nit   was  the  previous  year  is  that  from   our\r\n\r\nexperience last year we discovered, partly  through\r\n\r\nthe   resourcefulness   of   the   Public   Service\r\n\r\nCommission, that quite a number of donor  countries\r\n\r\nwere  able  to  provide  us  with  facilities   for\r\n\r\nindustrial  training. For instance, last  year  the\r\n\r\nBelgian Government gave 20 industrial scholarships,\r\n\r\nand  similar awards were made available in  France,\r\n\r\nthe  United  States,  Japan,  Germany,  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom and several other countries. This being so,\r\n\r\nthe  amount  required to be paid out of the  Budget\r\n\r\nitself  is reduced by the amount which was extended\r\n\r\nin scholarship aid. So we are not unoptimistic that\r\n\r\nnext  year  these  donor countries,  with  whom  we\r\n\r\nmaintain amicable and, we hope, mutually beneficial\r\n\r\nrelationships,  will find it in their  interest  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  ours  to  continue  to  offer  industrial\r\n\r\ntraining facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister for his reply and, on that note, may\r\n\r\nI beg leave to withdraw my amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0104 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2009*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* The  same amendment also stood in the  name  of Mr Yeah Ghim Seng.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can well remember that the subject of the\r\n\r\nPresident's   scholarships   was   raised   by   my\r\n\r\ncolleague, the hon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember for Aljunied, in this Chamber on the 15th of\r\n\r\nthis  month  last year.

In this respect, Sir, I shall be  grateful\r\n\r\nif  the  Prime Minister will explain the  reduction\r\n\r\nmade  in the vote next year, that is, from $143,000\r\n\r\nthis  year  to  $110,000 next year. Also,  will  he\r\n\r\ninform  this  House of the number of recipients  of\r\n\r\nthe  President's  scholarships this  year  and  the\r\n\r\nlikely number next year?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe   pride  ourselves  in  this  country   on   our\r\n\r\nPresident's scholars, as they represent  the  cream\r\n\r\nof  our  schools  and  thus of  our  youths.  These\r\n\r\nscholars are sent abroad as junior ambassadors  and\r\n\r\nare  therefore sent with a lot of fanfare and  with\r\n\r\nthe  country's blessings. For the past  few  years,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, the number of  school  children\r\n\r\nenrolling    in   schools   must   have   increased\r\n\r\ntremendously and, therefore, I would have  expected\r\n\r\na  wider  selection of first-class pupils  for  the\r\n\r\ncoveted  and  signal  honour of  being  President's\r\n\r\nscholars.  At  least, Sir, one would have  expected\r\n\r\nthe  number of such scholarships to remain the same\r\n\r\nannually. Yet I see that the 1968 vote has been cut\r\n\r\nfrom the 1967 vote of $143,000 to $110,000. Surely,\r\n\r\nthe Public Service Commission or the Prime Minister\r\n\r\ncannot   tell  this  House  that  our  pupils   are\r\n\r\ndeteriorating in their mental capacity. If not, why\r\n\r\nhas   there  been  such  a  drastic  cut   in   the\r\n\r\nPresident's Scholarships vote?

So, Mr Speaker, Sir, I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister will reconsider the  estimated\r\n\r\namount   for  the  vote  so  that  the  number   of\r\n\r\nPresident's scholars for 1968 will remain at  least\r\n\r\nthe same as for 1967.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I\r\n\r\nassure  both  the  Members  who  have  raised  this\r\n\r\nproblem  that,  far  from the number  of  potential\r\n\r\ntalented young men and women reducing in numbers as\r\n\r\nthe  years  go  by,  they have, in  fact,  shown  a\r\n\r\ncapacity   not   only   to  win   the   President's\r\n\r\nscholarships,  but  also  to  take  a   few   other\r\n\r\nscholarships  by  the  way;  and  the   President's\r\n\r\nscholar  is often a person who holds at  least  one\r\n\r\nother  scholarship. The President's scholarship  is\r\n\r\ngiven  on  the basis of merit, not on the basis  of\r\n\r\nneed, and inevitably the boy who wins it also  gets\r\n\r\nsome other scholarship. When he does that, then, if\r\n\r\nhe  is studying abroad, whether it is in the United\r\n\r\nKingdom, Australia or Canada, he does not  get  the\r\n\r\nfull  scholarship but he gets an allowance of \u0153250,\r\n\r\nbecause  otherwise we will ruin him by  giving  him\r\n\r\ntoo much money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also told Members of the House that last\r\n\r\nyear  there were seven President's scholars;  three\r\n\r\nof  them  decided  to study in  the  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, one at the Polytechnic, one in  Britain,\r\n\r\none  in  Australia, and one in Canada. They  had  a\r\n\r\nfree choice of where to go for higher studies. Four\r\n\r\nout  of  seven chose to study here. That  has  also\r\n\r\nsaved us the cost of the passages going overseas. I\r\n\r\nam  quite  sure that next year, as in the  case  of\r\n\r\nthis year, these scholars will also be able to  win\r\n\r\nother awards whilst being the President's scholars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one last\r\n\r\nquestion.   According  to  the  Hansard   of   15th\r\n\r\nDecember,  1966, there were nine winners for  these\r\n\r\nscholarships  last year, but this  year  there  are\r\n\r\nonly seven. I wonder why.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am afraid I must assume\r\n\r\nthat the Public Service Commission puts a very high\r\n\r\nstandard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the  attainment of the status of a President's\r\n\r\nscholar, and if there are not more than seven  such\r\n\r\nscholars,  then  not  more than  seven  President's\r\n\r\nscholarships are awarded. It is a very  proper  way\r\n\r\nof  maintaining standards. It does  not  mean  that\r\n\r\njust  because you have in the Budget Estimates  ten\r\n\r\nposts  for  Political  Secretaries,  therefore,  we\r\n\r\nappoint  ten Political Secretaries. We do  not,  as\r\n\r\nMembers well know. We appoint Political Secretaries\r\n\r\nas  and  when they are found necessary and  as  and\r\n\r\nwhen there are suitable candidates. I am quite sure\r\n\r\nthe same principles must have applied in the Public\r\n\r\nService Commission in not awarding more than  seven\r\n\r\nPresident's scholarships for this year.  They  must\r\n\r\nvary from year to year. Sometimes you have a bumper\r\n\r\nharvest.

It does  not\r\n\r\nmatter  whether the President's scholars  need  the\r\n\r\nmoney  or whether they deserve it or do not deserve\r\n\r\nit  for purely financial or social reasons, as long\r\n\r\nas they have the capacity, the excellence, to merit\r\n\r\nthe award. If they can win other scholarships, then\r\n\r\nthey will not get the full award; but they will get\r\n\r\nwhen they go abroad a scholarship allowance of  \u015350\r\n\r\nSterling  per  annum in addition to the  allowances\r\n\r\nthey  have obtained under the other awards, instead\r\n\r\nof  the full cost being borne by Government.

The Member for Joo Chiat  will  know\r\n\r\nthat  if  he  turns up the preface of many  of  his\r\n\r\nscholarly journals or books, even in his particular\r\n\r\nfield of surgery, there is great pride in referring\r\n\r\nto the fact that the man was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nholding  three different scholarships at  the  time\r\n\r\nwhen  he  was an under-graduate in some college  or\r\n\r\nuniversity.

I sought explanation  in\r\n\r\nAppendix    H    which   says   that   Government's\r\n\r\ncontribution is \"shared in proportion  of  students\r\n\r\nfrom each territory including Sabah and Sarawak.\" I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether the Prime Minister can inform  this\r\n\r\nHouse  whether  the  number of our  students  using\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Hall has, in fact, doubled in the  course\r\n\r\nof the year. I was in Malaysia Hall sometime at the\r\n\r\nbeginning of this year and there was no evidence of\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> First, may I explain that we\r\n\r\npaid one-third of the capital cost of acquiring the\r\n\r\npremises  of  Malaysia Hall.  In  other  words,  in\r\n\r\nequity  we  own one of the three fairly substantial\r\n\r\nhouses  which were joined together to form Malaysia\r\n\r\nHall. This is the first point we want to establish,\r\n\r\nthat  we  own  one-third of the capital.  With  the\r\n\r\naccretion of Sabah and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarawak,  we  deem that our share  of  the  running\r\n\r\nexpenses   should   be  reduced,   but   we   still\r\n\r\nnevertheless own one-third of the capital. We  were\r\n\r\none-third   of   the  student  population   without\r\n\r\nincluding Sabah and Sarawak. With Sabah and Sarawak\r\n\r\nwe  consider ourselves one-fourth. So  we  held  up\r\n\r\npayments  for the years 1965 to 1966  and  1966  to\r\n\r\n1967  pending  clarification  in  sorting  out  the\r\n\r\nproportions. Now it has been agreed that if we take\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaysia together, not Singapore  and\r\n\r\njust  Malaya, we will pay one-quarter. So  this  is\r\n\r\nfor two years' payment. Arrears have to be paid up.\r\n\r\nBut  in  making this point I want to make it  quite\r\n\r\nclear that this does not mean we own one-quarter of\r\n\r\nMalaysia Hall. We still own one of the three houses\r\n\r\nin  Malaysia  Hall. It so happened that  we  bought\r\n\r\nthree houses and we paid one-third. We are happy to\r\n\r\nhave  all the students together even though we  are\r\n\r\nnow separate and different countries. But if people\r\n\r\nshould   ever  consider  our  students  should   be\r\n\r\nexcluded, then we will not be collecting one-fourth\r\n\r\nof three houses but we will be collecting one-third\r\n\r\nof three houses, which is exactly one house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I wish to withdraw the\r\n\r\namendment, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0104\r\n\r\nbe reduced by $l00*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* The same amendment also stood in the name of  Mr Tang See Chim.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I understand it, the function of the\r\n\r\nPublic    Service   Commission   is   to   regulate\r\n\r\nimpartially  the  public service.

Also  a  newly   qualified   person\r\n\r\nappointed  to the Bench is likely to be transferred\r\n\r\nat  one  time  or another to the Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nChambers  where  his superior is  someone  who  had\r\n\r\nappeared before him when he was on the Bench.  This\r\n\r\nis an invidious position to place a newly qualified\r\n\r\nperson  as  a magistrate and it is unfair  to  him.\r\n\r\nThis could result in a perversion of the course  of\r\n\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  if I may make a point quickly on the question\r\n\r\nof  the  appointment of magistrates  to  the  Bench\r\n\r\nstraight from the university. Quite often, many  of\r\n\r\nour magistrates today are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappointed  to  the Bench immediately after  getting\r\n\r\ntheir  degrees  in  the university  here  or  after\r\n\r\nreturning  from the United Kingdom with  their  Bar\r\n\r\nqualifications.  This is a matter  which  was  dis.\r\n\r\ncussed  at great length in this very House on  16th\r\n\r\nDecember,  1957,  when the Prime  Minister  himself\r\n\r\nmade  the point that it is always difficult to have\r\n\r\ninexperienced   magistrates  listening   to   cases\r\n\r\ndealing  with  involved facts as well  as  involved\r\n\r\nlaws.  The  position today seems to be  similar  to\r\n\r\nthat  which obtained in 1957 and we do not seem  to\r\n\r\nhave progressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was really interested in what\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   said  about  the  Public   Service\r\n\r\nCommission.  I get the impression that the  malaise\r\n\r\nreally rests in the way in which the Public Service\r\n\r\nCommission itself is constituted. Section 6 (4) (f)\r\n\r\nof  the  Republic  of Singapore  Independence  Act,\r\n\r\n1965, reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'the powers of the Judicial and Legal Service\r\n\r\nCommission shall be exercised by a Legal  Service\r\n\r\nCommission  which shall consist of the  following\r\n\r\npersons:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the Chief Justice, as President;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the Attorney-General;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the Chairman of the Public Service Commission;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) a Judge of the High Court nominated generally or specially by the Chief Justice; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) not more than two members of the Public\r\n\r\nService   Commission  nominated  generally   or\r\n\r\nspecially   by  the  Chairman  of  the   Public\r\n\r\nService Commission;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the non-legal element in the constitution of the Public\r\n\r\nService  Commission is about half.  I  submit  that\r\n\r\nthis  should not be so, because I do not think that\r\n\r\npeople  who  are  not legally trained  and  legally\r\n\r\nqualified or people who have not practised  at  the\r\n\r\nlaw  will understand the special position faced  by\r\n\r\nthe  Judicial Service or the Legal Service  of  the\r\n\r\nState of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would very much like the Minister to let us\r\n\r\nknow whether this position could be rectified.

There  is\r\n\r\nmuch  merit  in  what they say. I myself  have  had\r\n\r\nsimilar experience at the Bar when appearing before\r\n\r\nmagistrates who had no experience on the Bench.  My\r\n\r\nclients  therefore suffered and we had to take  the\r\n\r\nmatter  up to High Court. But I think both  Members\r\n\r\nknow  -and I need not repeat at length what I  have\r\n\r\nsaid just now -that these are matters for the Legal\r\n\r\nService Commission which is certainly not under  my\r\n\r\ncontrol.  The  only person I can speak  to  is  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General. I will present the Members' views\r\n\r\nto   him  and  ask  him  to  present  them  to  the\r\n\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the composition of the Legal Service\r\n\r\nCommission, I also agree with the Member for  Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang  that,  as  far as legal  appointments  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  there  should  be  more  men  on   that\r\n\r\nCommission with legal experience than the  position\r\n\r\nas  it  is today -three men from the Public Service\r\n\r\nCommission,  the  Chief Justice, a  Judge  and  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General. If there is a split in the votes,\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Justice will have a casting vote, but  I\r\n\r\nam sure he will not be very happy if he has to cast\r\n\r\nhis extra vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure the Member for Bukit Panjang that these\r\n\r\nare  matters which will be considered seriously  by\r\n\r\nthe Government when the new Constitution is finally\r\n\r\ndrafted. In fact, it has been drafted and  will  be\r\n\r\ncirculated amongst the Ministers and Ministries for\r\n\r\ntheir  comments, and this is a point that  we  will\r\n\r\nconsider  when the new Constitution is finally  put\r\n\r\nbefore this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I wish to withdraw the\r\n\r\namendment, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0107\r\n\r\nbe reduced by $100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, in the not very distant future,\r\n\r\ntwo  of our Judges are about to retire and the time\r\n\r\nhas  come when the powers that be will have to look\r\n\r\naround to fill the vacancies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes ago I did refer to the debate in\r\n\r\nthis House on the 16th of December, 1957, when  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister himself talked at length about  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  having  to appoint Judges  from  among\r\n\r\npractitioners.  I think it is inevitable  that,  as\r\n\r\ntime  goes  on, we will not be able to  escape  the\r\n\r\nneed  to  appoint most of our Judges more and  more\r\n\r\nfrom  amongst  practitioners than  from  the  Legal\r\n\r\nService. This is as it should be, because  most  of\r\n\r\nthe  talent and expertise must come from among  the\r\n\r\npractitioners themselves, and as Singapore  is  the\r\n\r\ncommercial heart -I am sure that as time  goes  on,\r\n\r\nthe  intellectual heart too -of the whole of South-east Asia, it is incumbent that we have a Bench  in\r\n\r\nSingapore that inspires the confidence of not  only\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore but also the international\r\n\r\ncommercial community. This means that we must  have\r\n\r\nat  least  a  very strong commercial Bench.  If  we\r\n\r\naccept  the  proposition that we must  appoint  our\r\n\r\nJudges   progressively  from  among  practitioners,\r\n\r\nthen,  of  course,  we come up against  the  rather\r\n\r\nsensitive   question  of  emoluments  and   pension\r\n\r\nschemes  that  we  will have to formulate  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes of paying them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The\r\n\r\namount  of  income  tax  any  leading  lawyer  pays\r\n\r\nexceeds the salary of any of the Judges. But if you\r\n\r\nup  the  Judges' salaries, how far  do  you  go?

Indeed   a\r\n\r\ncommercial  court  can be said  to  be  already  in\r\n\r\nexistence. But, unfortunately, those practising  at\r\n\r\nthe  Bar  have not seen fit to invoke  the  use  of\r\n\r\nthese  Rules  which  will  in  turn  establish  the\r\n\r\ncommercial  practice  at  the  Bar.  While  it   is\r\n\r\nconceded  that there may be a need for a commercial\r\n\r\ncourt  charged with the adjudication of  commercial\r\n\r\nmatters, it would appear, from the use made of  the\r\n\r\nCommercial  Code Rules or rather the lack  of  such\r\n\r\nuse,  that the time is not ripe for the appointment\r\n\r\nof Judges solely with the object of establishing  a\r\n\r\ncommercial court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I\r\n\r\nwould  like to suggest the following proposals  for\r\n\r\nfuture reference by the Elections Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the boundary of each constituency should\r\n\r\nbe   delineated  clearly,  because  there  is  some\r\n\r\nconfusion  over  the  present electoral  divisions,\r\n\r\ni.e., a voter in Sembawang will have to vote in Nee\r\n\r\nSoon or in Bukit Panjang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the days for inspection of the electoral\r\n\r\nregisters should be extended because the number  of\r\n\r\nvoters has increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, in some rural constituencies such as\r\n\r\nSembawang,  Nee Soon, Bukit Panjang, and  Choa  Chu\r\n\r\nKang,  the  centres for inspection of the electoral\r\n\r\nregisters  should be increased for the  convenience\r\n\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, first, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  answer  the second point  raised  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang -that the period of 12  days,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  now  mandatory in  the  legislation,  is\r\n\r\nconsidered adequate. I do not think it is necessary\r\n\r\nreally  to  extend the period of inspection.  As  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  fact, the argument put forward  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Sembawang that the  period  should  be\r\n\r\nlengthened  because  there  are  more  electors  is\r\n\r\ninaccurate, simply because the increased electorate\r\n\r\nhas  been  redistributed among more constituencies,\r\n\r\nwith  the  result that we have opened more  centres\r\n\r\nfor the inspection of registers. And the period  of\r\n\r\ntwo weeks -I am sorry I mentioned 12 days just now;\r\n\r\nI was wrong, it should be two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nweeks -is considered quite sufficient. If there are\r\n\r\npeople who are genuinely interested in finding  out\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not their names are in  the  register,\r\n\r\nthey should do so the moment the books are open for\r\n\r\ninspection, and not wait until the last two days or\r\n\r\nthe  closing day to rush to the centre to check the\r\n\r\nregisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as for the point raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang that some electors in Sembawang find\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  to  vote in  Nee  Soon  or  Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang, that, of course, is an indictment  against\r\n\r\nthe  elector  himself. A man who  has  changed  his\r\n\r\naddress   should  immediately  notify  the  nearest\r\n\r\npolice station or the National Registration Centre,\r\n\r\nso that this change of address will be noted in the\r\n\r\nregisters. Consequently the anomaly that a man  who\r\n\r\nlives  in  one constituency has to vote in  another\r\n\r\nconstituency  will  not arise. However,  I  presume\r\n\r\nthat  many  people who have changed their addresses\r\n\r\nduring  this  period have not bothered  at  all  to\r\n\r\nnotify  the  police  or  the National  Registration\r\n\r\nCentre,  and  therefore  they  have  to  face   the\r\n\r\ninconvenience.  Equally so, it  may  well  be  that\r\n\r\npersons living in new constituencies will find that\r\n\r\nthey will have to go to some faraway centre to vote\r\n\r\nfor  the same reason. However, we shall try as best\r\n\r\nwe  can  to erect more polling stations so that  as\r\n\r\nfew  people  as possible will be inconvenienced  on\r\n\r\nthis account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  inspection of electoral  registers\r\n\r\nover a period of two weeks, I find that of the many\r\n\r\nelectors who live on the same road or street in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency,  half of them will have  to  vote  in\r\n\r\nKampong  Kembangan and the other  half  in  Kampong\r\n\r\nChai  Chee. Further, of the other electors who have\r\n\r\nbeen  living at the same address for so many years,\r\n\r\nsome will have to vote in Kampong Chai Chee and the\r\n\r\nrest in Kampong Kembangan. And if these people wish\r\n\r\nto raise any objection, they have to fill up a form\r\n\r\nand  pay a prescribed fee of $1 per person. Can the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister  re-examine  the  electoral\r\n\r\nregisters with a view to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrectifying  the  errors, so that  proper  electoral\r\n\r\nregisters can be drawn up without paying any fees?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The first point, of course, is\r\n\r\nnot   uncommon  at  all.  The  Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan   refers   to  a  situation   where   his\r\n\r\nconstituency has been cut into two, with the result\r\n\r\nthat  it is inevitable that some electors who  live\r\n\r\non  one  side  of  the street will find  themselves\r\n\r\nbelonging to one constituency, and those living  on\r\n\r\nthe  other  side of the street will find themselves\r\n\r\nlocated  in another new constituency. This  is  the\r\n\r\ncase,  too,  for those people who live  in  Orchard\r\n\r\nRoad. Half of the people who live on the left  side\r\n\r\nof   Orchard  Road  belong  to  the  River   Valley\r\n\r\nConstituency, and those who live on the right  side\r\n\r\nof  Orchard  Road find themselves in the  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nConstituency. The reason is that Orchard Road, like\r\n\r\nthe road which the Member for Kampong Kembangan has\r\n\r\nmentioned  just now, has been used  as  a  boundary\r\n\r\nline   for  partitioning  the  area  into  separate\r\n\r\nconstituencies. I am afraid this is a problem which\r\n\r\ncannot be avoided at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as far as the waiving of fees is\r\n\r\nconcerned, the idea of imposing a fee is to prevent\r\n\r\npeople  from  wasting  the  time  of  the  Election\r\n\r\nOfficers over frivolous claims. A fee is imposed so\r\n\r\nthat whoever is prepared to pay $1 will really  lay\r\n\r\na  claim  or  make  an objection to  the  Elections\r\n\r\nOffice because he has got serious reasons to do so.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I will consider waiving the fee  in  some\r\n\r\ncases, but at the moment I do not think that we can\r\n\r\ncompletely   remove   this  regulation   from   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

In other words, Members of  Parliament\r\n\r\nwho have been elected in the 1963 elections will be\r\n\r\noccupying  these  seats up to the  30th  September,\r\n\r\n1968. In a review of past elections which began not\r\n\r\nvery  long  ago,  the first general elections  were\r\n\r\nconducted  under a semi-colonial regime. Later  on,\r\n\r\nthe  general  elections  were  conducted  under  an\r\n\r\ninternally self-governing Singapore, and  the  last\r\n\r\nelections  were  also conducted quite  differently.\r\n\r\nAnd the general elections which will take place  in\r\n\r\n1968  will  still  be different in  nature  because\r\n\r\nSingapore has since become an independent Republic.\r\n\r\nSo  the people of Singapore are free. They have the\r\n\r\nright to elect their own representatives into  this\r\n\r\nHouse. Therefore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  view  of  the  changed  circumstances  and  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  nature  and  importance  of  our  coming\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections, I would like  to  raise  a  few\r\n\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to ask concerns the coming general\r\n\r\nelections.  In  view of its different  meaning  and\r\n\r\nnature, can certain citizens of Singapore who  have\r\n\r\nbecome diplomats, or local citizens who have become\r\n\r\nHigh   Commissioners,  ambassadors  or   diplomatic\r\n\r\npersonnel  of  foreign countries -in  other  words,\r\n\r\nthey  are  now  serving foreign  countries  -become\r\n\r\ncandidates in the general elections in 1968?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is the allocation of work\r\n\r\npertaining  to the election officers. According  to\r\n\r\nour experience in the past, very often when it came\r\n\r\nto the time of election many unhappy incidents took\r\n\r\nplace,  especially  in  a constituency  where  many\r\n\r\ncandidates  competed. Some of the candidates  would\r\n\r\nnot  abide by the regulations. They wanted to  play\r\n\r\nfoul. Some of them would canvass illegally or tease\r\n\r\nelection  officers  so that the  election  officers\r\n\r\ncould  not look after their jobs as efficiently  as\r\n\r\nthey would like to. All these malpractices are  not\r\n\r\nvery good and when elections -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. There are two minutes left\r\n\r\nduring  which  the  hon.

These things are normally related  to  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  constituencies. I think the  rule  about\r\n\r\nthe number of posters should be relaxed, because if\r\n\r\nonly  20  posters  are  allowed  in  a  very  large\r\n\r\nconstituency, they may not be sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also ask the Deputy Prime Minister when\r\n\r\nthe next general elections will be held.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> In answer to question one\r\n\r\n-anyone  who is a Singapore citizen and whose  name\r\n\r\nis  in  the  electoral register  can  vote  in  any\r\n\r\nelection and can also stand as a candidate for  the\r\n\r\nelection. There is no law to stop him from doing so\r\n\r\nat  all.  For all those who are serving abroad,  it\r\n\r\nmay  well  be unfortunate indeed that there  is  no\r\n\r\nprovision  in  the law by which they  can  vote  by\r\n\r\nproxy  or  through the post. However,  that  is  no\r\n\r\nhandicap  at  all, because so long as such  persons\r\n\r\ninform  the  Elections Office of  the  reasons  for\r\n\r\ntheir  absence from the State during the  election,\r\n\r\ntheir names will be retained in the register.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to question two -the Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance,   which   has  been  amended   recently,\r\n\r\nprovides  the  police  with powers  to  handle  any\r\n\r\ndisturbances which may occur during the  elections,\r\n\r\nand  I  am quite sure that any foolish organisation\r\n\r\nor  any  foolish group of persons who believe  that\r\n\r\nthey can intimidate, threaten or interfere with the\r\n\r\nelections in 1968 will think twice before  they  do\r\n\r\nthis, because any such attempts to create confusion\r\n\r\nduring  the elections will be properly dealt  with,\r\n\r\nand we will have no hesitation to clobber all those\r\n\r\nwho  seek  to  create  confusion  during  such   an\r\n\r\nimportant event in the history of the Republic.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the third question about increasing\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  posters -this is a  problem  which\r\n\r\narose some years ago when we discovered that during\r\n\r\nthe  elections it was a war of posters. Candidates'\r\n\r\nposters  were plastered on top of other candidates'\r\n\r\nposters, and because of this, it was agreed by  all\r\n\r\nthe  parties  concerned  that  there  should  be  a\r\n\r\nrestriction in the number of posters that could  be\r\n\r\npasted  up  so as to avoid complaints and incidents\r\n\r\nover  the profusion of posters as a result of which\r\n\r\nin some streets there was not enough wall space for\r\n\r\nlate comers to put their posters up at all. Whether\r\n\r\nwe can increase the number of posters for the rural\r\n\r\nareas so that the electorate will at least know who\r\n\r\nis standing for election or not is a point which we\r\n\r\nmay  well have to take into consideration when  the\r\n\r\ntime comes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view\r\n\r\nof the Deputy Prime Minister's reply, may I beg\r\n\r\nleave to withdraw my amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,008,750 for Head 0301 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0302 -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0302\r\n\r\nbe reduced by $100.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is the fifth largest port in the\r\n\r\nworld.

It is true that at the present  moment\r\n\r\nthe Merchant Shipping Ordinance prescribes regulations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich follow the British Ordinance, and these\r\n\r\nregulations  are  of  higher standards  than  those\r\n\r\nrequired  by the International Convention.

However, all I would say is that  what\r\n\r\nwe  will do is typically Singaporean, and it is the\r\n\r\nintention of this legislation, of course, to assist\r\n\r\nship owners to register under our flag. At the same\r\n\r\ntime,  what we gain out of it will not be in income\r\n\r\ntax  or  other forms of taxation. What  I  hope  to\r\n\r\nachieve  by changing our Merchant Shiping Ordinance\r\n\r\nis that by having more vessels registered under our\r\n\r\nflag   we   can   create  more  opportunities   for\r\n\r\nemployment of Singapore seamen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I am satisfied, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nand I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,741,990 for Head 0302 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0304 -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

With\r\n\r\nthis   increase  in  traffic  both  in   terms   of\r\n\r\npassengers and goods, one would expect an  increase\r\n\r\nin   the  number  of  constables  in  the  Airport.\r\n\r\nInstead.

In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  Airport  Police  Force is  distinct  from  the\r\n\r\nregular  Police Force. It has been formed  under  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  Ordinance  which  permits  the   Airport\r\n\r\nPolice  Force  to  perform solely as  an  auxiliary\r\n\r\npolice force. However, their claim for revision  of\r\n\r\nsalaries   has   been  laid  before  the   Salaries\r\n\r\nCommission  and  until the Report of  the  Salaries\r\n\r\nCommission  has been published by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance, I cannot say anything more on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point raised by the Member for Anson,\r\n\r\nthe answer is that the in-crease of traffic at Paya\r\n\r\nLebar  and  requirements for  car  parks  have  got\r\n\r\nnothing  to  do with the police at all. The  police\r\n\r\nlook  after  the internal security of the  Airport,\r\n\r\nand   car  parks  are  looked  after  by  car  park\r\n\r\nattendants and not by the police force. So if  four\r\n\r\npersons  have been promoted to corporals and  lance\r\n\r\ncorporals.   I   think   it   is   a   matter   for\r\n\r\ncongratulation. I really see no reason why  because\r\n\r\nwe have promoted four persons, therefore, we should\r\n\r\nreplace them with four constables. The same  number\r\n\r\nof  bodies is required and certainly we do not want\r\n\r\nto  follow Parkinson's law that, if you create  one\r\n\r\ntop  post,  you  have got to create  several  other\r\n\r\nminor  post3  in  the  process.  However,  for  the\r\n\r\ninformation  of the Member for Anson, I  would  say\r\n\r\nthat  this  is part of an economy exercise  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Finance. They have been very stringent\r\n\r\nfor  1968.  As  Members are aware,  the  Budget  is\r\n\r\nvirtually  a standstill Budget, and the reason  why\r\n\r\nit  Is  so is that we have clamped down on all  new\r\n\r\nappointments.

What has happened is that we have taken\r\n\r\nover   Cable   and  Wireless  Limited   which   was\r\n\r\nresponsible for external telecommunications in  the\r\n\r\npast, and in the process we have taken over members\r\n\r\nof the staff as well. The three Accountants who are\r\n\r\nbudgetted  for in the Estimates are these:  one  is\r\n\r\nheld  against a post which is now shown in  subhead\r\n\r\n1009;  the second one is held against the  post  of\r\n\r\nAssistant  Controller, subhead 1010; and the  third\r\n\r\naccountant comes over from Cable and Wireless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add, for the information of the House,\r\n\r\nthat   the   essence   of  the   Telecommunications\r\n\r\nDepartment  is to earn revenue, and  I  have  given\r\n\r\ndirectives that the Department should be spruced up\r\n\r\nso  that it operates as a business concern. As  the\r\n\r\nmost important part of any business concern is  the\r\n\r\naccounting  side,  we  have authorised  that  three\r\n\r\naccountants  be appointed in the Telecommunications\r\n\r\nDepartment.  These accountants have  more  work  to\r\n\r\nperform since we have got international as well  as\r\n\r\nlocal accounting to look into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the question of telegraph\r\n\r\nmessengers,  there  has been some  misunderstanding\r\n\r\npartly  because the number of telegraph  messengers\r\n\r\nwhom  we have taken over from the former Cable  and\r\n\r\nWireless is not indicated in the Budget. But if the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Anson  looks  under  subhead   3009,\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Department (External),  he  will\r\n\r\nfind  a block vote of $4,256,280. This sum of money\r\n\r\nis  provided for payment of emoluments to all those\r\n\r\nnow  in  Cable and Wireless. At the moment, we  are\r\n\r\nnegotiating  with  Cable  and  Wireless  Union   on\r\n\r\ntransfer of the staff to Government salary  scales,\r\n\r\nand  negotiations have not been completed for posts\r\n\r\nrelating  to  Division II and officers  below  this\r\n\r\nDivision.  The telegraph messenger boys' emoluments\r\n\r\nin  Cable  and Wireless are included in this  block\r\n\r\nvote. So there has really been no reduction at  all\r\n\r\nin the total number of telegraph messengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncidentally, there are 63 telegraph messengers  in\r\n\r\nCable  and Wireless and this, together with the  55\r\n\r\nbudgetted  for  under the Telecommunications  Head,\r\n\r\nbrings  the  total to 121. So with that  number  of\r\n\r\ntelegraph messenger boys, I think we can  pool  our\r\n\r\nresources and make the service as efficient  as  in\r\n\r\nthe past without increasing the number of bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I want to  know\r\n\r\nwhat these payments are, to whom they are paid, and\r\n\r\nwhy the wayleave payments are increased threefold?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Wayleave ac-counting is a form\r\n\r\nof  accounting  which has been worked  out  amongst\r\n\r\nCommonwealth countries who subscribe  to  a  common\r\n\r\ntelecommunications system. It is a very complicated\r\n\r\nform  of  accounting which I myself, not  being  an\r\n\r\naccountant, do not fully understand. But roughly it\r\n\r\nmeans  this. If you want to send a message, let  us\r\n\r\nsay,  to Copenhagen or Moscow, you can send it  via\r\n\r\nSeacom  cable across to Australia, then across  the\r\n\r\nPacific  to Canada, across the Atlantic to  London,\r\n\r\nwho  in  turn will transmit the message  either  by\r\n\r\nradio  or  some other cable to Moscow or Copenhagen\r\n\r\nor  whichever  place  you  want  to  despatch  your\r\n\r\nmessage. Things being centralised\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore   or  less  in  London  in  this  Commonwealth\r\n\r\nnetwork, it stands to reason that whatever  revenue\r\n\r\nwe  collect in Singapore, part of it has got to  be\r\n\r\npaid  to  somebody else for helping you to transmit\r\n\r\nyour  message. This is the essence of the  wayleave\r\n\r\naccounting  system. It means that  all  expenditure\r\n\r\nincurred  by  partners  of the  Commonwealth  cable\r\n\r\nsystem  or  telecommunications  system  pool  their\r\n\r\nexpenditure  together; this expenditure  being  the\r\n\r\namount  of  money  you spend on transmitting  other\r\n\r\npeople's  messages,  or  expenditure  incurred   in\r\n\r\nmaintaining  sections of the cable or  sections  of\r\n\r\nthe  telecommunications system for  which  you  are\r\n\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then towards the end of the financial year, the\r\n\r\nrevenues  collected by Commonwealth  countries  are\r\n\r\ntotalled up and each Commonwealth member country is\r\n\r\nthen  asked to pay up what it owes to other members\r\n\r\nin  proportion  to the amount of  revenue  that  it\r\n\r\ncollects  in its own country. This roughly  is  the\r\n\r\nessence of the wayleave scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the wayleave payment has been\r\n\r\nincreased  is  again explained by our take-over  of\r\n\r\nexternal  telecommunications from the former  Cable\r\n\r\nand  Wireless Company. The wayleave payments  which\r\n\r\nwere  previously made by Cable and Wireless Company\r\n\r\nare  now  included  in  the payments  made  by  the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Department.  That  explains  why\r\n\r\nthere  has been an increase. F o r m e r I  y,  the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications  Department  paid   about   $2.2\r\n\r\nmillion. Cable and Wireless Company paid about $1.1\r\n\r\nmillion. So the total sum adds up to $3.3 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second point, the interim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallowance refers to an allowance that is being paid\r\n\r\nto  clerks  of  the  Telecommunications  Department\r\n\r\nunder  an  award made by the Industrial Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt  in 1965. The allowance amounts to about  $15\r\n\r\nper   month  to  each  clerk.  The  clerks  of  the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications  Department  had  asked  for  an\r\n\r\nupward revision of their salaries, but this had not\r\n\r\nbeen agreed to by the Treasury. It was referred  to\r\n\r\nthe Arbitration Court, and when no final settlement\r\n\r\nwas  forthcoming either from the Treasury  or  from\r\n\r\nthe Salaries Commission, the Arbitration Court made\r\n\r\na  judgment so that an interim payment of this  sum\r\n\r\nwould be made to these clerks. So this is, in fact,\r\n\r\nan  allowance  payable to a clerk if  the  date  of\r\n\r\nconfirmation  of  his  appointment  is  later  than\r\n\r\nJanuary  1965.

In the 1965 Budget sittings, I pointed\r\n\r\nout that the postal quarters at Radin Mas, Tanglin,\r\n\r\nWilkinson  Road, Geylang and Choon Guan Street  old\r\n\r\npostal-drivers garage quarters were in  pretty  bad\r\n\r\ncondition  and  I urged that they be improved.  The\r\n\r\nMinister of State promised to look into the matter,\r\n\r\nbut  I  regret to say, Sir, that nothing  has  been\r\n\r\ndone.  I  am  now  compelled to ask  him  the  same\r\n\r\nquestion and I hope that some action will be  taken\r\n\r\nto improve these postmen's quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to draw the\r\n\r\nattention  of  this House to the difficult  working\r\n\r\nconditions of postmen. In my opinion, and  speaking\r\n\r\nfrom experience, I think that the duties of postmen\r\n\r\nare  among the toughest in the whole civil service.\r\n\r\nI  am  sure that the public are also aware of this.\r\n\r\nOutwardly,  they  seem  to  be  merrily  delivering\r\n\r\nletters,  parcels and registered articles,  but  it\r\n\r\nmust  be appreciated that their duties are not that\r\n\r\nsimple. They are required to discharge them  within\r\n\r\na stipulated time. They have to cycle under the hot\r\n\r\nsun or in heavy rain and sometimes with their heavy\r\n\r\nloads up hilly slopes, which is most strenuous  and\r\n\r\nexhausting, and they are penalised for any loss  of\r\n\r\nletters  or articles. Above all, they have to  rush\r\n\r\nthrough their daily deliveries within a very  short\r\n\r\ntime.  They also have to climb many storeys in  our\r\n\r\nmodern  multi-storeyed flats.  Under  these  trying\r\n\r\nconditions of work, it is not unreasonable  to  ask\r\n\r\nthat  they be provided with decent quarters so that\r\n\r\nthey  may have a proper night's rest in order  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  be fit to undertake another day's  heavy\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice in the Estimates that\r\n\r\na  number  of  higher  grade posts  in  the  Postal\r\n\r\nDepartment  has been increased. I also notice  from\r\n\r\nthe Budget Statement of the Finance Minister of the\r\n\r\n5th  of  December that there has been a substantial\r\n\r\nincrease in the number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouses  and factories, but that there is to  be  no\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the number of postmen  for  1968.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the Minister stated that the number  of  new\r\n\r\nbuildings commenced this year showed no less than a\r\n\r\n66  per  cent increase over that of last  year  and\r\n\r\nthat private construction was, particularly active,\r\n\r\nshowing  a  94.5  per  cent  increase.  Yet  I   am\r\n\r\nsurprised to note that there is no provision for an\r\n\r\nincrease of even one postman but that there  is  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in the number of higher grade posts.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  number of senior officers  has  been\r\n\r\nraised from 8 to 13 since 1963, but there has  been\r\n\r\nno  increase  in the number of clerical  staff.  We\r\n\r\nhave now a Postmaster-General, a Deputy Postmaster-General,  two  Controllers of Posts,  13  Assistant\r\n\r\nControllers   of   Posts,   an   i   three    Chief\r\n\r\nSuperintendents.  This increase in  the  number  of\r\n\r\nhigher grade posts is hardly explainable. I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  what  work  they are doing, but  I  certainly\r\n\r\ncannot imagine how increased deliveries due to  the\r\n\r\nincrease   in   population,   houses,   flats   and\r\n\r\nfactories, can be met by increasing the  number  of\r\n\r\nsenior  officers. I have, however, no objection  to\r\n\r\nthe  creation  of  the post of  Deputy  Postmaster-General,  but  I  cannot  see  the  need  for   two\r\n\r\nControllers  of  Posts. Will the Minister  consider\r\n\r\nreducing the number to one Controller of Posts  and\r\n\r\nthree  Assistant Controllers of Posts? The  savings\r\n\r\nin  salaries of these four posts will be sufficient\r\n\r\nto  pay  for  30 postmen, which will mean  that  30\r\n\r\nfamilies will be looked after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Minister will\r\n\r\nappreciate  that  postmen are working  under  heavy\r\n\r\npressure.  When  one  postman goes  on  leave,  his\r\n\r\ndelivery  beat is shared by other postmen  who  are\r\n\r\nalready overloaded. But overtime is paid often  not\r\n\r\nin  fair proportion to the overtime work performed.\r\n\r\nIn  short,  this  is  because of  the  shortage  of\r\n\r\npostmen. To cite an example, on 14th November  this\r\n\r\nyear,  one assistant postman died shortly after  he\r\n\r\narrived  for  duty at the General Post Office.  The\r\n\r\npressure  of work was certainly one of  the  causes\r\n\r\nthat  contributed to his death. The office  is  not\r\n\r\nwell-ventilated   and   is   congested    by    the\r\n\r\naccumulation of mail bags and parcels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed,  one wonders how many of them have T.B.-God\r\n\r\nknows!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I respectfully request that the\r\n\r\nMinister  take  effective  steps  to  improve   the\r\n\r\nworking  conditions of postmen by providing  better\r\n\r\nquarters  for  them and by increasing their  number\r\n\r\nrather  than  by  increasing the number  of  senior\r\n\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department (Tuan Haji Yaacob bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,I fully sympathise with\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Anson who spoke on  the  hardships\r\n\r\nexperienced by postmen who earn small wages.

The Staff Side also requested  that\r\n\r\nthe  single-room quarters occupied  by  postmen  at\r\n\r\nChoon Guan Street should he altered to provide  two\r\n\r\nrooms  for each occupant. The matter was  taken  up\r\n\r\nwith   the  Public  Works  Department  and  limited\r\n\r\nrepairs  and  renovations were  undertaken  in  due\r\n\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Public Works Department reported\r\n\r\nthat  in  respect  of alterations to  provide  more\r\n\r\nliving   space,   the  Development  Planning   Sub-Committee   had   not   approved   any   structural\r\n\r\nalterations   as  the  quarters   were   very   old\r\n\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent to point out to the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  that  postmen are not entitled  to  quarters\r\n\r\nunder   their  scheme  of  service,  and  therefore\r\n\r\nGovernment should not spend public funds to enlarge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexisting old quarters. However, postmen,  as\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public, are eligible  for  public\r\n\r\nhousing, and it is understood that there will be no\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  obtaining Housing  Board  flats  if\r\n\r\napplicants  are  not selective.

The  reasons for the increase are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) nine postal clerks to meet the normal growth of\r\n\r\nwork;  and (2) 60 postal clerks, currently employed\r\n\r\nas  temporary clerks, to man the four new branches,\r\n\r\nnamely,  the Post Office Savings Bank, the  Finance\r\n\r\nand    Checking   Branch,   the   Statistics    and\r\n\r\ninternational  Branch, and the Money Order,  Stamps\r\n\r\nand  Services  Branch, which  branches  are  to  be\r\n\r\ntransferred to the permanent establishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  respect of the increase of nine postal clerks,\r\n\r\nit   is  regretted  that  the  Permanent  Secretary\r\n\r\n(Finance) did not support the proposal. In  respect\r\n\r\nof  the  60  postal clerks, the Permanent Secretary\r\n\r\n(Finance)  has  instead provided a  block  vote  of\r\n\r\n$320,000 under O.C.S.E., appearing in page  109  of\r\n\r\nthe Estimates under\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsubhead   3005,   Expenses   relating   to   Postal\r\n\r\nHeadquarters Branches and Post Office Savings Bank,\r\n\r\nSingapore.

Timescale, it\r\n\r\nwas  proposed to increase the establishment in  the 1968  Estimates by 15 postmen, making  a  total  of 462,  to  cope with the growth of delivery work  as\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  the Member for Anson a little  while\r\n\r\nago. Unfortunately, the proposals submitted to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance  were not  supported  by  the\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretary (Finance).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding subhead 1024, the current establishment\r\n\r\nof  assistant  postmen is 106. It was  proposed  to\r\n\r\nincrease the establishment by one, making  a  total\r\n\r\nof 107. Unfortunately, too, the Ministry of Finance\r\n\r\ndid  not  support this proposal either.

That is incorrect,  because  there\r\n\r\nare  22 quarters; four with two rooms each, and the\r\n\r\nrest -18 quarters -have one room each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State has also mentioned just now\r\n\r\nthe  increase in the number of postmen and  others, \r\n\r\nand  his reason is that the Ministry of Finance has\r\n\r\nbeen  cutting  down the expenditure.  What  is  the \r\n\r\nmeaning  of cutting and further cutting  the  vote? \r\n\r\nThe   Minister  of  State  must  tell  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinistry  that this Department needs the  increase,\r\n\r\nbecause the postmen are at present suffering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe  must explain to the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nthe  reasons  for increasing the number  of  posts.\r\n\r\nJust  ask  any  Assistant Controller  of  Posts  or\r\n\r\nanybody  to  deliver letters in the Alexandra  area\r\n\r\nfor  one day.

The length  of\r\n\r\nJalan  Betek is from Jalan Sayur to Jalan Ubi.  The\r\n\r\nlimitation,  therefore, is half. Why is  the  other\r\n\r\nhalf  of  the road from Jalan Mempelam  to  Airport\r\n\r\nRoad  not  gazetted? Likewise Jalan  Betek  between\r\n\r\nJalan  Sayur and Jalan Taugeh. Why does  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's Department restrict half the portion  of\r\n\r\nthe   road  only?

This is because  Singapore  is  a\r\n\r\nprosperous    city.   Business   flourishes,    the\r\n\r\npopulation is increasing, and the car-owning  class\r\n\r\nis expanding from year to year. For example, in the\r\n\r\ncase  of  private  cars,  in  1962,  according   to\r\n\r\nstatistics, there were only 77,379 cars;  but  five\r\n\r\nyears  later, that is, today, we have 115,283 cars.\r\n\r\nThat  means in five years' time there has  been  an\r\n\r\nincrease of 40,000 cars. The same increase is  also\r\n\r\nseen  in  motor-cycles. There has  also  been  some\r\n\r\nimprovement in the efficiency and administration of\r\n\r\nthe  R.O.V, to cope with the increase of work.  But\r\n\r\nundoubtedly   there  are  some  defects   in   this\r\n\r\ndepartment. As a result, I have received complaints\r\n\r\nfrom  members of the public and I wish to take this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  convey  these  complaints  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to enable him to take immediate steps  to\r\n\r\nimprove the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, some members of the staff in the R.O.V.\r\n\r\n-I  stress some only -are very bad in their dealing\r\n\r\nwith the public. They are rather bureaucratic in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  attitude and they do not receive the  public\r\n\r\nwell, They are not very courteous. This should  not\r\n\r\nbe so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I think the department should\r\n\r\nconstantly  review its administrative machinery  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  a  high  standard of efficiency.  I  have\r\n\r\nreceived complaints from members of the public that\r\n\r\nthey  have to wait for as long as half an  hour  or\r\n\r\neven  one  hour to pay their road tax.  That  is  a\r\n\r\nwaste  of  time  and a great inconvenience  to  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I have to appeal on behalf of the taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers.  I have received complaints from  some  of\r\n\r\nthem  that  they  are reported  to  have  committed\r\n\r\ntraffic offences and were fined heavily as a result\r\n\r\nof  the  lack of taxi stands in certain  places.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Government derives thousands of  dollars\r\n\r\nevery  year  by  way  of taxi licence  fees.  So  I\r\n\r\nsuggest the R.O.V, should build enough taxi  stands\r\n\r\nto   enable  the  taxi  drivers  to  operate  their\r\n\r\nbusiness  properly, because they  have  paid  their\r\n\r\nroad tax and they have a right to earn a living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, to\r\n\r\nreply  to  the Member for Kampong Kembangan.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult of the Prime Minister's visit to the Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai  Constituency, an appeal was sent to  him  to\r\n\r\nimpose  restriction  on heavy  vehicles  using  the\r\n\r\nroads  in  question.  A decision  had  to  be  made\r\n\r\nwhether the roads should be made up or restrictions\r\n\r\nimposed   on  vehicles.  As  a  result  of  careful\r\n\r\ninvestigations by the traffic police, the  Director\r\n\r\nof  P.W.D, and the Director of the Trade Division,\r\n\r\nit  was  decided  to impose restrictions  on  heavy\r\n\r\nvehicles,  especially  those carrying  logs,  using\r\n\r\nJalan  Ubi.  This involved 32 roads in addition  to\r\n\r\nJalan  Ubi  and the other roads mentioned.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  road signs there are insufficient. I will  ask\r\n\r\nthe  traffic  police  to  increase  the  number  of\r\n\r\nwarning  notices regarding the restriction  on  the\r\n\r\nuse of the roads by heavy vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the matter raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang, I shall be grateful  if  complaints\r\n\r\nabout  the  discourteous behaviour of some  of  the\r\n\r\nstaff can be addressed direct to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of Vehicles or to me. We will  certainly\r\n\r\ntake appropriate measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the long wait to pay road tax, we\r\n\r\ncannot put the blame on the R.O.V. We have launched\r\n\r\na   campaign  over  the  radio  and  on  television\r\n\r\nadvising licence holders to pay their road  tax  by\r\n\r\npost, and thus do away with the necessity of having\r\n\r\nto  wait  long if they pay at the R.O.V, counters.\r\n\r\nBut,  unfortunately, our campaign has gone unheeded\r\n\r\nby certain quarters. Hence they have to wait for  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable time. I hope the Member for  Sembawang\r\n\r\nwill  participate in this campaign and urge members\r\n\r\nof  the public to pay their road tax by post and in\r\n\r\nthat way reduce the congestion at the R.O.V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding taxi stands, actually this subject is\r\n\r\nunder  the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.  It  is  therefore  proper   for   the\r\n\r\nMinister in charge of that Ministry to reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd.

But  what  I  am\r\n\r\nsurprised  is  that whilst Gazette S 138  restricts\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  Jalan Ubi between Jalan Mempelam  and\r\n\r\nChangi  Road  which  are  not  passable  to   heavy\r\n\r\nvehicles, there is no restriction to the use of the\r\n\r\nother half from Jalan Mempelam to Airport Road. The\r\n\r\nGazette   only  states  Jalan  Ubi  between   Jalan\r\n\r\nMempelam  and  Changi  Road. Likewise  Jalan  Betek\r\n\r\nbetween  Jalan Taugeh and Jalan Ubi. The length  of\r\n\r\nJalan  Betek stretches from Jalan Taugeh  to  Jalan\r\n\r\nSayur, which means that the other half can be used.\r\n\r\nThe  other  road  names are  not  included  in  the\r\n\r\nGazette.  It  is not because of the  lack  of  road\r\n\r\nnames but because they are not gazetted. As I  have\r\n\r\nsaid just now, Jalan Ubi between Jalan Mempelam and\r\n\r\nAirport Road, Jalan Betek between Jalan Taugeh  and\r\n\r\nJalan  Sayur, Jalan Ladang, Jalan Siput, Jalan  Ang\r\n\r\nTeng  are  not included in the Gazette.

Member   for   Aljunied  has   misunderstood\r\n\r\ncompletely the powers of the Registrar of Societies\r\n\r\nand  also  misunderstood the passage which  he  has\r\n\r\nquoted.  There are provisions in the Societies  Act\r\n\r\nfor  the  purpose  of  allowing  the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nSocieties  to look into the accounts of  registered\r\n\r\nsocieties.  Vide  section 19 (1) of  the  Societies\r\n\r\nAct,  a  member of the society can file a complaint\r\n\r\nin a District or Magistrate's Court when an officer\r\n\r\nor  member of that society has unlawfully  withheld\r\n\r\nany  money of the society or wilfully applied  such\r\n\r\nmoney  for  purposes other than those expressed  or\r\n\r\ndirected  in  the rules of the society.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthere  is enough provision under the Societies  Act\r\n\r\nfor  the  Registrar of Societies to  see  that  the\r\n\r\nmoney of the society is legally used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the passage which he has quoted from Hansard,\r\n\r\nI  did  use  the words \"alleged misuse\".  It  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter of opinion of members of the society whether\r\n\r\nthe  money of the society is being misused or  not.\r\n\r\nThere is always a difference of opinion, and if the\r\n\r\nmajority  of the members voted for the use  of  the\r\n\r\nmoney  in  a  certain way, then  the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nSocieties would rather not interfere in an internal\r\n\r\nsquabble  if the money is used legally  and  within\r\n\r\nthe confines of the objectives of the society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Hooligans snatch gold chains and\r\n\r\nother jewellery from helpless women and get away on\r\n\r\nmotor-cycles  and  bicycles. Markets,  streets  and\r\n\r\npublic parks are usually the scenes of such crimes.\r\n\r\nWill the Minister of Defence consider strengthening\r\n\r\nthe  police  force  so as to keep such  disgraceful\r\n\r\ncrimes to a minimum?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, in the past, just as at present,\r\n\r\nwe  have  heard many hon. Members speaking  on  our\r\n\r\npolice  force. But most of the speakers have always\r\n\r\nattacked them. But my views are different. One  may\r\n\r\nsay  that a police officer is a government  servant\r\n\r\nand so he is expected to serve the public, like any\r\n\r\nother civil servant. I do not deny that, but  I  am\r\n\r\nof the opinion that a policeman runs more risk than\r\n\r\nany other civil servant for the pay he receives.  A\r\n\r\npoliceman  on patrol duty may enjoy  a  ride  in  a\r\n\r\nHolden  car or may be walking through the slums  in\r\n\r\nthe  early  hours of the morning. But whether  they\r\n\r\ntravel  in vehicles or go by foot, they are subject\r\n\r\nto   risks  of  stone  throwing  and  attacks  from\r\n\r\ngangsters  and anti-national elements. It  is  here\r\n\r\nthat  they  risk their lives. Sir, we in  Singapore\r\n\r\nhave faced many difficult periods during which  the\r\n\r\npolice  had  worked  round the  clock,  sacrificing\r\n\r\ntheir off days and vacation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleave.  They  even had no time to look after  their\r\n\r\nfamilies. In many cases, they have prevented crimes\r\n\r\nand  illegal activities instead of waiting for such\r\n\r\nthings  to  happen  and then stopping  them.  Their\r\n\r\nmotto is that prevention is better than cure.  When\r\n\r\nthere  were disturbances in some countries in  this\r\n\r\npart  of  the  world  due  to  the  devaluation  of\r\n\r\nSterling which resulted in the devaluation  of  the\r\n\r\nold  Malayan currency, there were rumours that  the\r\n\r\nanti-national  elements  would  make  use  of  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to create unrest here. But I think  due\r\n\r\nto  the precautionary measures taken by the police,\r\n\r\nnothing happened here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before criticising the police, we should\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  difficult conditions  under  which\r\n\r\nthey work. One of their many problems is to get co-operation  from  the  public. During  the  colonial\r\n\r\ndays,  the police were treated with either contempt\r\n\r\nor  fear. But after we took over the government  in\r\n\r\n1959,  both the public and the police have realised\r\n\r\nthat  they  are friends. This has resulted  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  coming forward to give information  to  the\r\n\r\npolice and thus giving them their co-operation.  So\r\n\r\nwhen  we  praise the police today, the civic-minded\r\n\r\npublic  also  have a share in it. Of  course,  Sir,\r\n\r\nsome  of  our hon. Members may have genuine grouses\r\n\r\nagainst the police. But, as I have said earlier, if\r\n\r\nwe  think  of the difficult conditions under  which\r\n\r\nthey  work,  I am sure we will learn to  appreciate\r\n\r\nthem  instead  of condemning them. We should  offer\r\n\r\nsuggestions to help improve their lot.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I have a remark to make under this\r\n\r\nHead. I see on page 122 of the Estimates and at the\r\n\r\ntop  of  page  123, two headings,  namely,  \"Gurkha\r\n\r\nContingent\"   and   \"Malay,  Indian   and   Chinese\r\n\r\nContingent\".  I think these are left-overs  of  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  rule. Here I can see some  reason  for  a\r\n\r\nseparate  Gurkha  Contingent.  But  there   is   no\r\n\r\njustification  for  a  Malay,  Indian  and  Chinese\r\n\r\nContingent.   When   we  say  \"police\"   they   are\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  At  this time when  we  are  talking\r\n\r\nabout abolishing associations under clan names, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  as  an  example,  should  abolish  such\r\n\r\nheadings.  Sir,  can the Minister  please  consider\r\n\r\nthis?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I think it is still a\r\n\r\npractice in the police for certain officers to have\r\n\r\nthe  services of some sort of a footman in the form\r\n\r\nof  a constable. I think this is a left-over of the\r\n\r\ncolonial  system. In fact, wrong use is made  of  a\r\n\r\nconstable,  on  whom we have spent  a  considerable\r\n\r\namount of money training him to be a constable,  by\r\n\r\nmaking  him  a footman. Will the Minister  consider\r\n\r\ndiscontinuing  this practice and assure  the  House\r\n\r\nthat he will do so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am really\r\n\r\nglad  that  at  least one Member of the  House  has\r\n\r\nnoticed   the   improvement  in  the  police/public\r\n\r\nrelationship,  the  result  of  a  very   prolonged\r\n\r\ncampaign  carried  out  not  only  by  Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament  but  by leaders of this  Government  to\r\n\r\npromote better police/public relationship. Also, he\r\n\r\nhas  noticed the good response from members of  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reply to the Member for Anson, I think I must\r\n\r\ndispel  the  false belief that crime is increasing.\r\n\r\nStatistics  compiled by my Department  of  seizable\r\n\r\noffences  have shown that they have riot increased,\r\n\r\nand although we are pretty near the end of the year\r\n\r\nwhen the New Year is about to be on us -it is usual\r\n\r\nat  this season to expect an increase in crime -the\r\n\r\nfigure for November shows that it has dropped.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of  what is known as seizable offences  has\r\n\r\ndropped  from  an  average of 1,250  per  month  to\r\n\r\n1,143, and this is largely due to the police taking\r\n\r\npreventive measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle against crime can be waged more\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  if  the public  are  alert  to  their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  and adopt a certain  standard  of\r\n\r\npublic behaviour. I can assure the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nthat it is always in the minds of officers and  men\r\n\r\nof  the police force to keep the crime rate down to\r\n\r\nthe minimum. It does not necessarily mean that,  by\r\n\r\nhaving more officers and men, the crime\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrate can be kept down. In this respect, I think the\r\n\r\nattitude of the public is the most important factor\r\n\r\nand  if  they respond, and continue to  respond  as\r\n\r\nthey are doing now, by giving more information  and\r\n\r\nco-operation to the police, I am sure  we  will  be\r\n\r\nable to keep down the crime rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunate that under the Budget heads we\r\n\r\nhave   names  which  connote  racial  and  communal\r\n\r\norigins.  The Member for Aljunied is quite  correct\r\n\r\nin  saying  that  this  is a legacy  from  colonial\r\n\r\ntimes. Actually what the \"Malay, Indian and Chinese\r\n\r\nContingent\"  connotes is that  it  is  a  different\r\n\r\ncontingent  from  what  was  known  as   the   Sikh\r\n\r\nContingent before the war. The Sikh Contingent  was\r\n\r\ndisbanded  and  in  its place we  have  the  Gurkha\r\n\r\nContingent.  A  better name, of  course,  would  be\r\n\r\n\"Contingent other than the Gurkha Contingent\".\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I would like to thank the Member for\r\n\r\nAljunied  for his suggestion and I will see  to  it\r\n\r\nthat next year another name will be substituted.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Choa Chu Kang, I would like\r\n\r\nto   inform  him  that  it  is  not  \"footman\"  but\r\n\r\n\"batman\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is not \"Batman\" of T.V.!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> No, not \"Bat-man\". This again is\r\n\r\na  condition  and  term of service  of  the  police\r\n\r\ndepartment and the Salaries Commission has  put  up\r\n\r\nits  Report. So I cannot promise the Member that  I\r\n\r\nwill  deprive police officers of this condition  of\r\n\r\nservice  unless  and until I have  thoroughly  gone\r\n\r\ninto  it.  There must be a very good reason  why  a\r\n\r\nbatman  is attached to a gazetted officer,  because\r\n\r\nhe  does  relieve  the latter  from  doing  certain\r\n\r\nthings  which  will  otherwise  prevent  him   from\r\n\r\ncarrying out his work more efficiently. It  is  not\r\n\r\nalways   an  easy  thing  for  us  to  change   the\r\n\r\nconditions and terms of service, especially when it\r\n\r\nmeans  a  loss of certain privileges to the officer\r\n\r\nconcerned,  and  I would prefer  not  to  make  any\r\n\r\npromise.

This is  to  be\r\n\r\nappreciated,  Sir, but we should  not  forget  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  all volunteers except for those  members\r\n\r\nwho  are  required to do national service. When  we\r\n\r\nconsider  the  powers given to them,  I  think  the\r\n\r\nfacilities given to them are not enough if  we  are\r\n\r\nto  be proud of their services. We should also  see\r\n\r\nthat  they are sufficiently compensated though they\r\n\r\nare not benefited financially. For example, let  us\r\n\r\ntake  medical facilities. The Minister, in  winding\r\n\r\nup  the  debate on the Vigilante Corps Bill, stated\r\n\r\nthat arrangements could be made to get free medical\r\n\r\nservices  for members of the Vigilante  Corps  from\r\n\r\nprivate  doctors, I do not know how  far  this  has\r\n\r\nmaterialised. If not, I do not think it will  be  a\r\n\r\nburden  on  the  Government to  give  free  medical\r\n\r\nattention  to  them  at  Government  hospitals  and\r\n\r\nclinics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is that members of the Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps  do  not have sufficient uniforms.  Again,  I\r\n\r\nwish  to stress that they are volunteers. They  are\r\n\r\ncivic-minded  and they want to serve their  country\r\n\r\nduring their spare time, So we should not tax them.\r\n\r\nConnected with uniforms is the question of  laundry\r\n\r\nexpenses.  As  a uniformed service,  the  Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps  has  to  look smart. At least some  sort  of\r\n\r\nallowance  should be given to cover such incidental\r\n\r\nexpenses.  I  wish to point out what  the  Minister\r\n\r\npromised  during the debate on the  Bill.  He  said\r\n\r\nthat  he would look into the matter. So far nothing\r\n\r\nhas   happened   and  I  hope  he  will   give   an\r\n\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in spite of many difficulties, the\r\n\r\nmanagement  committees  of  community  centres   in\r\n\r\nvarious  constituencies are trying  their  best  to\r\n\r\nprovide  free tea, cigarettes, etc, to  members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Vigilante  Corps.

In order to encourage more\r\n\r\nmen  and  women  to  join the  Vigilante  Corps,  I\r\n\r\nrequest  the Minister to look into the question  of\r\n\r\nproviding them with the facilities I have mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The  Chairman  (Mr  Tang See  Chim)</b>:  Inche  Mohd, Ariff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

In the Vigilante Corps itself,  as\r\n\r\nthe  spirit  of civic-consciousness and service  to\r\n\r\nthe  community is so strong, we felt that we should\r\n\r\nnot  dilute  it  by giving allowances  to  the  new\r\n\r\nnational   servicemen  in  the   Vigilante   corps.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  decided sometime last month  that  at\r\n\r\nleast  they should not be out of pocket  for  their\r\n\r\ntransport,  and now members of the Vigilante  Corps\r\n\r\nare provided with a transport allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of the Vigilante Corps is that it should\r\n\r\nbe an organisation to help change the attitude that\r\n\r\nhas  been handed down by past generations  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry,  that  is,  lack  of  civic-consciousness,\r\n\r\ncommunity service and standard of public behaviour.\r\n\r\nWe   hope   that  by  getting  the  young  national\r\n\r\nservicemen into the Vigilante Corps and by training\r\n\r\nthem in discipline and service to the community, it\r\n\r\nwill  be  one of the means by which we  can  change\r\n\r\ntheir  attitude to the community. As I  have  said,\r\n\r\nsince  the Vigilante Corps started with very  ideal\r\n\r\nand unselfish motives, we do not like to dilute  it\r\n\r\nby making it a mercenary concern,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for the information of the Member for\r\n\r\nMountbatten, there are 110 V.C, posts so far in the\r\n\r\nRepublic,   and  the  total  number   of   national\r\n\r\nservicemen   undergoing  training   for   part-time\r\n\r\nservice  in  the Vigilante Corps is  2,396.  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  him  that not only I but also the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  will  see to  it  that  the  vote  of\r\n\r\n$1,300,000 will be well spent and not misused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> In view of the answer given by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to  this  House,  I  beg  leave   to\r\n\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2018.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I spoke on this Head last year, I asked\r\n\r\nfor an explanation why certain Government buildings\r\n\r\nsuch as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  General  Post Office, etc, were not  decorated\r\n\r\nduring  National  Day.  The  previous  Minister  of\r\n\r\nDefence  told this House that he saw  no  merit  in\r\n\r\ndecorating  Government offices on National  Day  as\r\n\r\nthe  day  would  be  a public holiday.  He  further\r\n\r\nstated  that  the  policy of  the  Government  with\r\n\r\nregard to last year's National Day was to move away\r\n\r\nfrom  the decoration of Government offices  to  the\r\n\r\ndecoration of the town and to brighten up the  main\r\n\r\nstreets and thoroughfares where people live. Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  still  unable to understand the logic  of  that\r\n\r\nargument.  It is true that the public  may  not  be\r\n\r\nvisiting Government offices on business, but  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  the  Minister will agree with me when  I  say\r\n\r\nthat  most of our citizens will be away from  their\r\n\r\nhomes  in holiday mood, and they may be around  the\r\n\r\nPadang  and  Government offices at  Empress  Place.\r\n\r\nSir,  I say that it is necessary to decorate  these\r\n\r\nbuildings. These are sights which will impress  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  inculcate in them a sense of  national\r\n\r\npride  and  the children will find it difficult  to\r\n\r\nforget  the  decorations and the reason  for  them.\r\n\r\nThus  the  young  and  old will  have  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nnational  pride  instilled in them. The  Government\r\n\r\nnormally  request  the public and organisations  to\r\n\r\ndecorate their homes and buildings. The Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  directs  all schools to  decorate  their\r\n\r\nbuildings. It is for the same reason that I request\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to direct all Government  departments\r\n\r\nto  decorate  their buildings. Last  year,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the boats in our waters were not dressed  up\r\n\r\nas  expected.  I  hope in the  following  year  the\r\n\r\nMarine Department will take the necessary steps  to\r\n\r\nsee  that  vessels are dressed up. In  addition,  I\r\n\r\nwould suggest that the department make arrangements\r\n\r\nwith masters of boats to have their sirens blown at\r\n\r\na particular time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have come across a certain Government\r\n\r\nbuilding flying our national flag at half-mast!  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, no one would have done it deliberately, but\r\n\r\nI  would request the Minister to issue circulars to\r\n\r\nall  departments that they take care  to  see  that\r\n\r\ntheir flags are properly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhoisted.

Therefore, with the limited  funds  at  our\r\n\r\ndisposal,  it is up to those who are in  charge  to\r\n\r\nsee  which is more preferable, whether to  decorate\r\n\r\nthe  buildings with lights and bunting, or to  have\r\n\r\nthe   streets,   including  the  fields   and   the\r\n\r\nroundabouts, lined with flags.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as to the Member's other point.

Therefore,  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  decided  to  give the  P.D.F, a  3\u00ab  months'\r\n\r\nholiday, so that the full-time instructors  in  the\r\n\r\nP.D.F, can now attend a course to enable  them  to\r\n\r\nundertake the training of the P.D.F, which will now\r\n\r\ninclude national servicemen.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the idea is that the P.D.F, will now be\r\n\r\nreorganised  into  battalions  and  will  be  given\r\n\r\nrequisite training which we think will enable  them\r\n\r\nto  better  assist in the defence of  the  country.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, Mr Speaker, Sir, I will not go.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I beg to withdraw, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Boo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3091.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Work Brigade has been set up for\r\n\r\nquite  some  time.  Normally  before  any  work  is\r\n\r\nallotted  to them to carry out, it has to have  the\r\n\r\napproval of the Urban and Rural Services Committee.\r\n\r\nBut  that  usually takes several years!  And  after\r\n\r\napproval is given, it will take two or three  years\r\n\r\nbefore  the  work  is  actually  carried  out.   So\r\n\r\nefficiency is reduced.

There must\r\n\r\nalso  be control of finances, because all this work\r\n\r\nentails finances. And if work projects in the rural\r\n\r\nareas  or  constituencies are  not  directed  by  a\r\n\r\nsingle body, there would be duplication and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchaos,  and  certain  constituencies,  through  the\r\n\r\ninfluence of their Members of Parliament, and  with\r\n\r\ncajoling, persuasion and other means, would be able\r\n\r\nto  get more than their just share.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0401\r\n\r\nbe reduced by $100.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Defence in the past one year has\r\n\r\ndone  much to build up our armed forces and  expand\r\n\r\nthe   police  force.  The  sum  allotted  for  this\r\n\r\nMinistry is about $100 million. It is quite a large\r\n\r\nsum and is a great deal more than what was allotted\r\n\r\nfor  1967.  In the circumstances, I feel that  this\r\n\r\namount is necessary to match the present conditions\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. I feel that the defence  forces  and\r\n\r\nthe  police are necessary for the protection of the\r\n\r\nlives   and   property  of  the  people   and   the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of law and order in our country,  Ours\r\n\r\nis  a  very small country. Our population is  small\r\n\r\nand  we  do  not have much money to  spend  on  the\r\n\r\nbuilding up of our armed forces. Therefore, we have\r\n\r\nthe  national service scheme to enable young people\r\n\r\nto  join  these forces. On the one hand, this  will\r\n\r\nlessen our economic burden. On the other hand, this\r\n\r\nwill   enable  our  youngsters  to  take  up  their\r\n\r\nresponsibility of national defence and  service  to\r\n\r\nthe  country. This scheme was implemented in  March\r\n\r\nthis  year. It is supported by people in all  walks\r\n\r\nof life in spite of the opposition by anti-national\r\n\r\nelements  to  whom nobody pays any attention,  This\r\n\r\nmove   to  take  up  national  service  is  a  very\r\n\r\npatriotic act and should have our praise. Sir, ours\r\n\r\nis  a non-Communist, democratic, socialist country.\r\n\r\nOurs is a country which looks after the welfare  of\r\n\r\nall  the people. So the aim of the armed forces  is\r\n\r\nto  inculcate  in  the minds of their  members  the\r\n\r\nspirit  and  consciousness to defend  the  country.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  Defence Ministry  issued  sometime\r\n\r\nthis  year  a code of conduct to the armed  forces.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  very good thing and I  hope  that  all\r\n\r\npersonnel will abide by this code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have two suggestions to make to the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Defence.  I hope  he  will  pay  very\r\n\r\ncareful  attention to what I am going  to  say.  He\r\n\r\nmust not misunderstand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy suggestions and give me answers which  are\r\n\r\nnot  what  I have asked for, or to give me  answers\r\n\r\nwhich  I  do  not expect. The first  suggestion  is\r\n\r\nabout  the spirit of unity of our people. Based  on\r\n\r\nthis  principle,  we must improve the  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  the police and the public. In the colonial\r\n\r\nera  and  also under the Lim Yew Hock  regime,  the\r\n\r\npolice represented an instrument for suppression of\r\n\r\nthe  people.  But  now we are  an  independent  and\r\n\r\ndemocratic country. Therefore, the police  must  in\r\n\r\ntheir dealings with the people behave well in order\r\n\r\nto  make  the  people  know  that  they  are  their\r\n\r\nprotectors. In the past, the police had to  conduct\r\n\r\ncertain  campaigns such as, \"Be together  with  the\r\n\r\npeople\". These campaigns were meant to improve  the\r\n\r\nrelationship between the police and the  public.  I\r\n\r\nthink  they  are  very  meaningful  and  should  be\r\n\r\nencouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second suggestion is that women should also\r\n\r\ntake  up  national  service,  because  ours  is  an\r\n\r\negalitarian  society.  Therefore,  they  should  be\r\n\r\nallowed to join the armed forces. They have put  up\r\n\r\na very good show in the People's Defence Force, the\r\n\r\npolice and the Vigilante Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  have  heard  a lot from  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang  urging other people to  join  the  armed\r\n\r\nforces but he himself has not volunteered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about defence, there is something which\r\n\r\nwe  should  recognise, i.e.,  the  independence  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  After the British military  withdrawal,\r\n\r\nwe  still cannot completely change the concept that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  a  military base.  The  position  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  after  independence is  still  of  great\r\n\r\nstrategic   importance.  So   the   importance   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  other than in trade and commerce,  lies\r\n\r\nin its ability to defend itself against any foreign\r\n\r\ncontrol  or  invasion. Some  people  say  that  the\r\n\r\nprogress  of  armament nowadays, the  technique  of\r\n\r\nmilitary strategy and form of military warfare have\r\n\r\nundergone so great a revolution that the defence of\r\n\r\nour  country has become unnecessary. But ever since\r\n\r\nancient times there has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen an immutable principle, i.e., people will have\r\n\r\nto  defend their country and armaments are meant to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  country against  foreign  control  or\r\n\r\ninvasion.  Arms alone are not sufficient to  occupy\r\n\r\nothers'  territories, Our country is still suitable\r\n\r\nas  a naval base, Without defence forces, we cannot\r\n\r\nbecome  an independent country. We may not be  able\r\n\r\nto  protect our people as an independent people, to\r\n\r\nenjoy freedom and to exist as a people. The defence\r\n\r\nprogrammes   have  been  aimed  at  our  protection\r\n\r\nagainst foreign invasion and the protection of  our\r\n\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. In  view  of\r\n\r\nthis,  it  is necessary to continue to develop  our\r\n\r\ndefence  preparedness.  Based  on  this  principle,\r\n\r\nwhile we are developing our economy, we should also\r\n\r\ndevelop   our  military  capacity.  This  is   also\r\n\r\nimportant  at  the present juncture. Therefore,  to\r\n\r\ndevelop our defence capacity, we must pay attention\r\n\r\nto  the  study  of military armaments  of  advanced\r\n\r\ncountries,  coupled with science in the development\r\n\r\nof  the economy, so that scientific development and\r\n\r\nmilitary  development can both be used  to  achieve\r\n\r\nthe  greatest benefit to the country.  These  three\r\n\r\nkinds   of  development  -economic,  military   and\r\n\r\nscientific  -will make a country strong. Therefore,\r\n\r\nSingapore   should   also  develop   its   military\r\n\r\ncapacity. Although the British military forces will\r\n\r\nbe  withdrawn, we will have to consider whether our\r\n\r\nmilitary strength is able to protect us against any\r\n\r\nforeign invasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister can give an assurance in\r\n\r\nthis  House  so as to ensure that we are  going  to\r\n\r\nprotect our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I can assure the hon.\r\n\r\nMember for Delta that our teeth are growing!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nwas  in  the  Chamber when the Member for  Aljunied\r\n\r\nspoke    on    the    question   of   police/public\r\n\r\nrelationship.

Last year, during the Budget\r\n\r\ndebate  in  which  I  took part,  I  was  given  an\r\n\r\nassurance by him that the applications of Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  who  desire their parents  to  come  into\r\n\r\nSingapore would be considered only if such  parents\r\n\r\nare above 60 or 65 years old. At the same time,  he\r\n\r\nalso  said that the applicants must have sufficient\r\n\r\nmeans  to  maintain their aged parents coming  into\r\n\r\nSingapore  so  that  Singapore  will  not  have  an\r\n\r\nadditional social burden. These statements  by  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister appear in Hansard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year I have received certain complaints from\r\n\r\nmy  constituents, One person complained  about  his\r\n\r\napplication regarding his old mother in  Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nwhose  daughter  is married, According  to  Chinese\r\n\r\ntradition,  the wife follows the husband.  In  this\r\n\r\ninstance,  the  daughter is unable to  support  her\r\n\r\nmother.  But  this  old lady's  only  son,  who  is\r\n\r\nrunning  a shop in Singapore, has enough  means  to\r\n\r\nsupport her. Several applications have been made to\r\n\r\nthe  Immigration Department for the entry  of  this\r\n\r\nold  lady  into Singapore, but I do  not  know  why\r\n\r\napproval  has  not  been  granted.  In  fact,   the\r\n\r\napplication   was   rejected  by  the   Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment and no reason was given. This is  really\r\n\r\nincomprehensible.  There  is  perhaps  a   lot   of\r\n\r\nbureaucracy in the Immigration Department. This old\r\n\r\nlady  in Hong Kong i5 now 83 years old. It is  rare\r\n\r\nfor  a person to live up to the age of 70, but this\r\n\r\nold lady has already exceeded the age of 80. So  if\r\n\r\nthe Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill allow her to enter Singapore. I think she\r\n\r\nwill have only a limited number of days in which to\r\n\r\nenjoy  life in our country. It is my hope that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment     will     consider     such     cases\r\n\r\nsympathetically. The people elect us for their  own\r\n\r\ninterest,  They  do  not elect  us  to  cause  them\r\n\r\ntrouble  or  difficulties as a  result  of  passing\r\n\r\nrestrictive laws. We should not pass such  laws  on\r\n\r\nthe  people who elect us. We must be consistent  in\r\n\r\nwhatever  we do. Mr Speaker, Sir, if you  are,  or\r\n\r\nany Minister is, in the applicant's shoes, I do not\r\n\r\nknow how you or the Minister will feel about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will sympathetically\r\n\r\nconsider the case of this old lady and allow her to\r\n\r\nenter  Singapore  so  that  her  son  here  can  be\r\n\r\nreunited  with  her.

We\r\n\r\nshould consider their applications sympathetically.\r\n\r\nIf  the  parents of our citizens are over 65  years\r\n\r\nold,  we  should give them a chance  to  come  into\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  do not want to dwell any  longer  on\r\n\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to refer now to the complaints against the\r\n\r\nstaff  of  the  Immigration  Department  for  being\r\n\r\ndiscourteous  to the public. They come  into  close\r\n\r\ncontact with people from all over the world. It  is\r\n\r\nimportant that they should be courteous because the\r\n\r\ntourists who come to Singapore will then be able to\r\n\r\ntell the world at large about the courteous service\r\n\r\naccorded  to  them in Singapore. So  if  they  give\r\n\r\ncourteous  and  efficient service to  tourists,  we\r\n\r\nwill  then  have  a good reputation.  If  they  are\r\n\r\nindifferent   or   rude,  that  will   damage   our\r\n\r\ninternational reputation. This courtesy accorded to\r\n\r\ntourists  must also be extended to our own  people.\r\n\r\nIf the staff of the Immigration Department cannot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntreat  the  people well, they cannot  treat  others\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the next point is about the\r\n\r\nstrict  regulations on travellers. Many  travellers\r\n\r\nfrom  abroad come to Singapore for a stay of  about\r\n\r\nthree   months  and  sometimes  they  ask  for   an\r\n\r\nextension of stay of two or three months. They have\r\n\r\ntheir sponsors in Singapore. So we should give them\r\n\r\nevery facility and grant them an extension of  stay\r\n\r\nin  Singapore because they come here to spend money\r\n\r\nand   this   benefits  our  country.  I  hope   the\r\n\r\nImmigration Department will consider this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the two points I wish to bring to the\r\n\r\nnotice of the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, since the previous two Members have spoken  on\r\n\r\nthis  amendment,  I  am taking the  opportunity  of\r\n\r\njoining  in  the debate so that I do  not  have  to\r\n\r\nspeak on Head 0402.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in full agreement with the\r\n\r\npoints raised by the Member for Bras Basah. We know\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  past  immigration restrictions  were\r\n\r\nimposed for sound reasons. The age limit was  fixed\r\n\r\nwith regard to factors prevailing in the past.  Now\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore is independent and there is a sense\r\n\r\nof  loyalty  to the Republic among the  people,  we\r\n\r\nshould  not ignore the fact that our citizens  long\r\n\r\nnostalgically for their parents in China or  India.\r\n\r\nIn   order  to  ensure  that  they  are   able   to\r\n\r\nconcentrate  their attention on their  business  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I  feel we should change  the  outdated\r\n\r\nregulations and restrictions particularly affecting\r\n\r\npeople  who are more than 65 years old.  This  will\r\n\r\nstrengthen the sentimental links of our people with\r\n\r\ntheir old folks in foreign countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our citizens have parents abroad, they usually\r\n\r\nremit   money  to  them  on  which  there   is   no\r\n\r\nlimitation.  If  they also have  relatives  abroad,\r\n\r\nthen  they  have  to remit more  money.  This  will\r\n\r\ninvariably affect and drain our national income. If\r\n\r\nour  citizens can be reunited with their  families,\r\n\r\nthey  will  incur less expenditure as they  do  not\r\n\r\nhave to make large remittances abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point of view is for humanitarian\r\n\r\nreasons.  Filial  piety  is  something  we   should\r\n\r\nconsider and this is also a point of morality.  All\r\n\r\nof  us  would  like  members of the  family  to  be\r\n\r\nunited. So if we try to separate the members of the\r\n\r\nsame  family by our strict laws, it will be  rather\r\n\r\ninhuman. And if we stipulate that old folks must be\r\n\r\nabove  the  age of 65 before they can be considered\r\n\r\nfor  entry  into  our  country,  then  this  is  an\r\n\r\nunreasonable  condition. Normally when  they  reach\r\n\r\nthe  age  of 65, they may not be healthy enough  to\r\n\r\ncome to Singapore, and even if they should come,  I\r\n\r\nam afraid they may die soon after their arrival; in\r\n\r\nwhich  case their families here will have to  spend\r\n\r\nmoney on their coffins. The other question is  that\r\n\r\nwhile  Singapore is now reclaiming land, the  space\r\n\r\ntaken up by these coffins meant for these old folks\r\n\r\nfrom  abroad will give rise to a shortage of  land.\r\n\r\nThis ill be another drain on our limited resources,\r\n\r\nwhich is land.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from these various points of view, I feel that\r\n\r\nthe present regulations controlling immigration are\r\n\r\nnot quite proper. We should reduce the age limit of\r\n\r\n65  so as to enable more people to come in, so that\r\n\r\nthey  can have more years with their families here.\r\n\r\nI   hope   the  Government  will  give  sympathetic\r\n\r\nconsideration to my suggestion. I hope all families\r\n\r\naffected by these regulations will be comforted  by\r\n\r\nthe new Government policy on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chum:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are\r\n\r\nonly  two points I wish to bring up in this debate.\r\n\r\nThe  first point has already been touched on by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang, that is, tourism  and  visas\r\n\r\nfor  tourists.  The second point  is  about  travel\r\n\r\ndocuments  for our residents holding blue  identity\r\n\r\ncards,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of tourism, I think there is some\r\n\r\ncontradiction  between  the  Government  department\r\n\r\nresponsible   for   tourism  and  the   Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment, If it is our intention to attract\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntourists, we cannot be too choosey about  them.  We\r\n\r\ncannot ask them to wait for a long time for a  visa\r\n\r\nbefore  we allow them to land in Singapore. But  it\r\n\r\nwould  appear  that our Immigration  Department  is\r\n\r\nstill  very  strict with regard to tourists  and  I\r\n\r\nhave heard of instances where a tourist had to wait\r\n\r\nfor  weeks,  if not months, before he could  get  a\r\n\r\ntourist visa. As far as I can see, if a tourist has\r\n\r\nthe  proper travel documents with a return  air  or\r\n\r\nsea  ticket, and the necessary travellers'  cheques\r\n\r\nto  support him during his stay here, I think  that\r\n\r\nshould be good enough and he could be issued with a\r\n\r\ntourist visa on the spot. But this does not seem to\r\n\r\nbe  the  policy here. I do not think we can  impose\r\n\r\nvery strict conditions on the one hand while trying\r\n\r\nto attract tourists on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question, I think a lot of our\r\n\r\nresidents  with  blue  identity  cards  are  in   a\r\n\r\ndilemma. They will not be issued with travel papers\r\n\r\nby  the Immigration Department unless, according to\r\n\r\nthe   Immigration  Department,  these  people   can\r\n\r\nproduce  certificates to the effect that  they  are\r\n\r\nstateless. Many of our residents who are holders of\r\n\r\nblue  identity  cards are from West  Malaysia;  and\r\n\r\nwhen  they go to the Malaysian High Commission  for\r\n\r\nsuch  a certificate, they are issued with some sort\r\n\r\nof  a cyclostyled letter stating that they are non-citizens  of  Malaysia  and  are,  therefore,   not\r\n\r\nentitled  to  a  passport. But this  paper  is  not\r\n\r\naccepted  by  the  Immigration  Department   as   a\r\n\r\ncertificate    of    their    statelessness,    and\r\n\r\nconsequently this Department refuse to  issue  them\r\n\r\nwith travel documents. There are many instances  of\r\n\r\na blue Singapore identity card holder wanting to go\r\n\r\nback to West Malaysia to visit his aged mother  who\r\n\r\nis  dying or very sick, and yet he could not do  so\r\n\r\nsimply  because  we  do  not  issue  him  with  the\r\n\r\nnecessary travel papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is a rather difficult state of\r\n\r\naffairs  for  the  blue identity card  holder,  and\r\n\r\nshould be corrected. As I see it, the travel paper,\r\n\r\ni.e., the Certificate of Identity, has a very clear\r\n\r\nnote  saying  that it is issued for the convenience\r\n\r\nof the holder to travel and in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno  way prejudices his national status. And if  the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Department want to be  satisfied  with\r\n\r\nhis   stateless-ness,   I   suppose   a   statutory\r\n\r\ndeclaration  by  himself should  suffice.  Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister look into this matter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the example\r\n\r\nquoted by the Member for Bras Basah in Mandarin and\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Choa Chu Kang with respect  to  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty of getting a tourist visa, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  say  only  this: one swallow does  not  make  a\r\n\r\nsummer.  These are exceptions to the  rule  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  certain rules and regulations which are  very\r\n\r\nnecessary for an orderly society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the applications for entry and\r\n\r\nadmission  of  aged  parents of Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\ninto Singapore, if they conform to these rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations, I do not see any difficulty in  giving\r\n\r\nthem  permission to come in. It is  only  in  cases\r\n\r\nwhere   they   do  not  conform  that   all   these\r\n\r\ndifficulties arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as we know, there has been no difficulty\r\n\r\nat  all  for tourists to obtain visas in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  we  have made it easier  by  making  the\r\n\r\nfollowing provision. We are extending the length of\r\n\r\ntime  that  air passengers can remain in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwithout  a  visa  - from 48 to 96  hours.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, anyone who visits Singapore by air can  stay\r\n\r\nin Singapore for up to 96 hours without a visa.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposal of the Member for\r\n\r\nDelta  to reduce the age is a problem which I think\r\n\r\nhas  been  considered. One must remember that  once\r\n\r\nthe  age limit is lowered, there may be a flood  of\r\n\r\npeople  coming  into  Singapore  on  this  pretext.\r\n\r\nThough  our economy is improving and expanding,  we\r\n\r\nare  not out of the woods yet, and it would not  do\r\n\r\nfor  us  at  this  moment to  carry  a  very  large\r\n\r\nproportion of the population who bring no  economic\r\n\r\nbenefit  at  all  to  us. I think  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and also the civil service have the same\r\n\r\nhumanitarian    feeling   as   the   Back-benchers,\r\n\r\nespecially  the Member for Bras Basah  -we  are  as\r\n\r\ntouched  as  he is by the fate of these people  who\r\n\r\nwould like to be reunited with their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparents. But there are certain considerations of  a\r\n\r\nlarger issue which we must have in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point here which I do not understand is all\r\n\r\nthis  talk  about filial piety and filial  duty  at\r\n\r\nthis time when during the last few years it was  so\r\n\r\neasy for parents to come in, and suddenly there  is\r\n\r\nnow  talk of filial piety and filial duty. This  is\r\n\r\nsomething  which  I cannot understand  at  all.  In\r\n\r\ndrawing  up our rules and regulations for admission\r\n\r\nof   aged   parents  here,  we   have   taken   the\r\n\r\nhumanitarian aspect into consideration,  and  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  we  can further relax it without  undue\r\n\r\nharm to our rate of progress in the economic field.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of certificates of\r\n\r\nidentity  for holders of blue identity  cards,  the\r\n\r\nmatter  is being looked into. I will not  make  any\r\n\r\ncommitment  just now. We understand  the  invidious\r\n\r\nposition  in  which these people are  put,  and  we\r\n\r\nshall try to do our best to see that they are given\r\n\r\ntravel  facilities  without in any  way  committing\r\n\r\nourselves to being responsible for them.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\ndid  not  reply to my question.

I\r\n\r\nnotice  that  several overseas missions  have  been\r\n\r\nestablished  and  are headed by High  Commissioners\r\n\r\nand Ambassadors, Against their designations are the\r\n\r\nsalary   codes  and  their  grades.  Sir,   it   is\r\n\r\ninteresting  to note that we have different  grades\r\n\r\nof  High  Commissioners and  Ambassadors,  Just  to\r\n\r\nquote,  Sir, the High Commissioner in Kuala  Lumpur\r\n\r\nis  Grade  III, salary code 1-4. In New  York,  the\r\n\r\nAmbassador    holds   the   rank   of    Ambassador\r\n\r\nExtraordinary  and Plenipotentiary, Grade  II.  The\r\n\r\nHigh  Commissioner in London is Grade II. I can  go\r\n\r\non  drawing examples of the same, and we then  come\r\n\r\nto Hong Kong where the High Commissioner's grade is\r\n\r\nIV.  Sir,  I  shall be extremely  grateful  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs will explain  this  to\r\n\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* Amendment (2) reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1201.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also been informed that some of our\r\n\r\nforeign  missions  are housed in  fiats.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the fiat serves both as the office and  the\r\n\r\nresidence   of   the   Ambassador   or   the   High\r\n\r\nCommissioner.  Sir,  in  this  respect,  will   the\r\n\r\nForeign Minister state the number of missions which\r\n\r\nhave proper offices and accommodation?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to Amendment (2) standing in my name\r\n\r\nregarding  subhead  1201. Sir, under  this  subhead\r\n\r\n\"Locally-recruited Staff\", I take it that the staff\r\n\r\nhave been recruited locally. In this case it is  in\r\n\r\nLondon. If one goes down the list one comes  across\r\n\r\n\"Confidential Secretary\". This is the post  I  wish\r\n\r\nto  enquire  about. I take it that  the  office  of\r\n\r\nConfidential  Secretary is  filled  by  a  locally-recruited  officer  in  the  U.K.  If  I   remember\r\n\r\ncorrectly,   going  through  the   other   overseas\r\n\r\nmissions,  I do not see any Confidential  Secretary\r\n\r\nwho  has been recruited locally. There is none,  in\r\n\r\nfact. I just want to know what sort of confidential\r\n\r\nsecretarial  work  this Confidential  Secretary  is\r\n\r\ndoing  and, if it is so confidential in  nature,  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  should  rather have our  own  home-based\r\n\r\nstaff than a person recruited locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, first, in regard to the\r\n\r\ngrading  of  Ambassadors  and  High  Commissioners.\r\n\r\nThere are in all three grades -I, II and III. Grade\r\n\r\nI  is really the Permanent Secretary, and the other\r\n\r\ntwo,  the Ambassadors and High Commissioners,  come\r\n\r\nwithin  either  of these two grades  -Grade  II  or\r\n\r\nGrade III. This grading is done partly on the basis\r\n\r\nof the importance for us of the particular mission,\r\n\r\nor  it may be on the basis of the person concerned,\r\n\r\nbecause  some  of  the appointments  are  political\r\n\r\nappointments.  So  it  is on this  basis  that  the\r\n\r\ngrading  of  the  respective  Ambassadors  or  High\r\n\r\nCommissioners is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to housing, finding houses and\r\n\r\nchancelleries   for   our   respective    missions,\r\n\r\nespecially  by  a  government, is a  very  delicate\r\n\r\naffair because when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople know that the Singapore Government is  going\r\n\r\nto  buy a house or a chancellery, prices tend to be\r\n\r\nhigher.    It    involves   long   and   protracted\r\n\r\nnegotiations.  But, by and large, in  most  of  our\r\n\r\nmissions we have managed to purchase residences and\r\n\r\nchancelleries.  I  think  the  exception   is   the\r\n\r\nparticular  case the hon. Member has in mind,  that\r\n\r\nis,  in London where the High Commissioner uses his\r\n\r\nfiat  as  his office and residence. This is  partly\r\n\r\nbecause  we  are  still considering an  appropriate\r\n\r\nresidence  for the High Commissioner. This  is  not\r\n\r\nunusual, Sir, because I think, in Washington we are\r\n\r\ndoing the same. For example, in Washington we  took\r\n\r\nover  from  another well-established mission  which\r\n\r\nhad  been conducting its business in a hotel suite.\r\n\r\nIf  you  want  to  go  for prestige  regardless  of\r\n\r\nexpense,  then,  of course, you can  buy  the  most\r\n\r\nexpensive house and the most expensive chancellery.\r\n\r\nSo  it is because of this that in one or two places\r\n\r\nthe  matter has not been resolved. But in the  case\r\n\r\nof  London  we  have got a house in mind.  We  have\r\n\r\npurchased  it  and we are considering  how  we  can\r\n\r\nrenovate  and  decorate it so that  the  Ambassador\r\n\r\nwill  have  a  house.  We  have  also  purchased  a\r\n\r\nchancellery  which  is  in  the  process  of  being\r\n\r\nrenovated  for  him to move into, and  it  will  be\r\n\r\nready as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the third point -Confidential\r\n\r\nSecretary  -yes,  she is a locally-recruited  staff\r\n\r\nmember  but  she  also happens to  be  a  Malaysian\r\n\r\ncitizen. I think she has had long connections  with\r\n\r\nSingapore  too, and she has been in  this  job  for\r\n\r\nquite  some time because this is part of our  trade\r\n\r\nsection.   As   far  as  I  know,  the  designation\r\n\r\n\"Confidential Secretary\" is the old one for a grade\r\n\r\nof  officer  higher than a stenographer  but  lower\r\n\r\nthan  a  Personal Assistant. So maybe next time  we\r\n\r\nwill take great care to change the name of the post\r\n\r\nand  that might satisfy the hon. Member. It is true\r\n\r\nthat  like  all  secretarial  work,  this  post  of\r\n\r\n\"Confidential Secretary\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoes  involve  certain confidential  correspondence\r\n\r\nand  files.  But if it is very highly  confidential\r\n\r\nand  is  of a nature which we do not want  to  pass\r\n\r\nthrough  the  hands  of  a  non-citizen,  then,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  will  consider employing  a  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen.  But considering the kind of work  she  is\r\n\r\ninvolved in, and the fact that she has been on  the\r\n\r\njob  for  a long time, there is nothing unusual  in\r\n\r\nher  continuing  with her present job  without  any\r\n\r\nmajor  disaster to Singapore. In fact, I understand\r\n\r\nthat  the designation of this post might be changed\r\n\r\nto Information Assistant, and I do not know whether\r\n\r\nthat would satisfy the hon. Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, taking one\r\n\r\npoint from the Hon.

Sir, I would like  to  know  the\r\n\r\nspecial reasons for opening up an office at  Johore\r\n\r\nBahru  and any particular service this office would\r\n\r\nserve to foreigners and Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully\r\n\r\nsupport  the  amendment moved by my colleague,  the\r\n\r\nhon.

The fact is that there\r\n\r\nhave   been   certain  difficulties  arising   from\r\n\r\napplications  for  visas by Singapore  citizens  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia who, if they are living in Johore or South\r\n\r\nMalaya, have to go all the way to Kuala Lumpur.  We\r\n\r\nhave occasions when some of our citizens from right\r\n\r\nacross   the  other  side  of  the  Causeway   look\r\n\r\nwistfully across to Singapore but they cannot  come\r\n\r\nin  without proper travel papers. We feel, in  case\r\n\r\nthere  are such problems, this diplomatic  post  in\r\n\r\nJohore Bahru will facilitate travel for some of our\r\n\r\nown citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is also for tourists who might have\r\n\r\ncome  down to Johore Bahru or the Johore  area  who\r\n\r\nhave  to get visas from Kuala Lumpur. So if we have\r\n\r\nan  office in Johore Bahru which will be under  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  the  Kuala Lumpur High  Commission,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  might facilitate matters  both  for  the\r\n\r\ntourists  and our citizens. Of course,  it  is  all\r\n\r\nsubject  to  our clearing these matters with  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur. In fact, the intention is not to set up  an\r\n\r\noffice immediately. It is intended to have an  E.O.\r\n\r\nor  a Third Secretary who will be able to discharge\r\n\r\nmany  of  these rather small functions which  might\r\n\r\nfacilitate things for our citizens and for some  of\r\n\r\nthe tourists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

What I wanted\r\n\r\nto ask of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Foreign Minister was why an embassy  in  Japan\r\n\r\nhad not been established, although in the Estimates\r\n\r\nfor 1967 there was provision for the setting up  of\r\n\r\nsuch  an embassy. In view of the fact that we  have\r\n\r\nvery  close  trading  relations  with  Japan,   and\r\n\r\nespecially in our industrialization efforts a great\r\n\r\ndeal  of  capital as well as technical  skill  have\r\n\r\ncome  from Japan, I think the establishment  of  an\r\n\r\nembassy in Japan should have been given priority. I\r\n\r\nnotice from the establishment of the other missions\r\n\r\nthat  possibly the Foreign Ministry has given wrong\r\n\r\npriorities  to  the  setting up of  these  overseas\r\n\r\nmissions,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, this year\r\n\r\nthe  Estimates for the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs\r\n\r\nhas  reached the figure of $7,395,530. This  is  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of about $2 million over the  figure  for\r\n\r\nlast  year.  I  know  that  this  increase  in  the\r\n\r\nestimates  has  been  due to the  increase  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber of missions in various countries and because\r\n\r\nof   additional  expenses  incurred  in   acquiring\r\n\r\naccommodation. This has been necessary in order  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  our relationship with other  countries,\r\n\r\nespecially in trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.09 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has also been necessary to increase our\r\n\r\nnational  income. Therefore, I support the increase\r\n\r\nin  the expenditure of this Ministry. This increase\r\n\r\nis meaningful.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to admit that the Ministry of Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs, under the able leadership of our Minister,\r\n\r\nMr  Rajaratnam, has successfully carried  out  our\r\n\r\nneutral  and non-aligned policy. We have seen  just\r\n\r\nnow  that  the Minister has the air of a  diplomat.\r\n\r\nOur  policy  in  foreign affairs  is  to  have  the\r\n\r\nmaximum number of friends and the minimum number of\r\n\r\nenemies -best of all, not to have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany enemies at all. This has won approval from many\r\n\r\ncountries in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have to mention that in October this year\r\n\r\nour  Prime  Minister,  together  with  the  Foreign\r\n\r\nMinister  and the Minister of State for  Education,\r\n\r\nvisited the United States of America and they  were\r\n\r\nwelcomed  by  the  American  Government  with   the\r\n\r\ngreatest cordiality. The speeches made by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  were very well received by the people  in\r\n\r\nAmerica,  and  other countries too.  In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nvisit   of   our  Prime  Minister  has   not   only\r\n\r\nstrengthened our position in international affairs,\r\n\r\nbut  it  has also enhanced our reputation.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, it has also facilitated our efforts  to\r\n\r\nincrease  foreign  investment  here.  According  to\r\n\r\nobservers   in   various   countries,   the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  visit  was a great  success.  From  our\r\n\r\npoint of view, his efforts are highly commendable.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point to be mentioned is that the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health represented our country at  the\r\n\r\nUnited   Nations   22nd   General   Assembly.   His\r\n\r\nperformance was a most remarkable one.  He  brought\r\n\r\nwith  him the liveliness of our country. The points\r\n\r\nof view he expressed won the recognition of all the\r\n\r\ncountries  there. Therefore, we should congratulate\r\n\r\nhim on his efforts.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to raise three questions. First,\r\n\r\nwhen  are  we  going  to establish  an  embassy  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia?  Indonesia is very near to our  country,\r\n\r\nand  it is our biggest customer in trade. Secondly,\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the progress made after the establishment\r\n\r\nof  ASEAN?  What  efforts  have  we  made  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection?  Thirdly, what sort of benefits  can  we\r\n\r\nderive from ASEAN? I wish the Minister can give  me\r\n\r\na reply to these questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Lim Cheng Lock):</b> Inche Mohd. Ariff is not here. Mr Chow Chiok Hock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I only\r\n\r\nwish  to  make  a suggestion. In the allocation  of\r\n\r\nposts,  the  Minister for Foreign Affairs  and  his\r\n\r\nofficials should emphasise on economic development.\r\n\r\nThe reason is this. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForeign Affairs Ministry is closely associated with\r\n\r\nother  countries and, therefore, the  officials  of\r\n\r\nthis   Ministry   should  receive   very   vigorous\r\n\r\ntraining,  especially in international affairs  and\r\n\r\npolitics.  They  should  pay  close  attention   to\r\n\r\ninternational affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand an incident happened in the Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs  Ministry  in October  this  year  about  a\r\n\r\nJapanese diplomat. A foreign correspondent  made  a\r\n\r\nphone  call to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  and\r\n\r\nasked  whether  it had anything to say  about  this\r\n\r\nJapanese  diplomat.  An official  of  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nasked. \"Who is this Japanese diplomat?\" He did  not\r\n\r\nknow anything about this diplomat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was made a laughing stock. As he was an\r\n\r\nofficial in the Ministry, he should have been  well\r\n\r\nversed with diplomatic figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that officials sent abroad\r\n\r\nshould thoroughly understand the foreign policy  of\r\n\r\nour country and at the same time should be able  to\r\n\r\npublicise   the  fact  that  our  country   has   a\r\n\r\nharmonious  multi-racial  society  so   that   more\r\n\r\ntourists  will  be attracted to our  country.  They\r\n\r\nshould also be upright and learned. Their selection\r\n\r\nshould be based on these qualities.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  have  two points to make  on  our  foreign\r\n\r\npolicy.  The  first  is that we  should  have  more\r\n\r\nforeign markets to ensure our economic development.\r\n\r\nOn  the  whole, our non-aligned foreign policy  has\r\n\r\nwon  the  approval  of  many  countries.  This   is\r\n\r\nsomething that we should be proud of. We have to be\r\n\r\nalert   all   the   time  in   order   to   promote\r\n\r\ninternational trade. I think this is very important\r\n\r\nbecause   Singapore,  as  an  independent  country,\r\n\r\ncannot   allow  itself  to  be  made  use   of   by\r\n\r\ninternational  forces. The strength of  our  people\r\n\r\nshould  not  be made use of by other  countries.  I\r\n\r\nhope  that our foreign policy will promote economic\r\n\r\nco-operation  with  other countries  in  South-east\r\n\r\nAsia in order to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nraise  our standard of living. Some countries  make\r\n\r\nuse  of international forces to promote trade. This\r\n\r\nis  a  short-term policy as finally these countries\r\n\r\nin fact resort to economic invasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should promote regional co-operation\r\n\r\nwith  other  countries in South-east  Asia  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of mutual benefit, In this way, we can  stop\r\n\r\nCommunism  from spreading. The Ministry of  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs can make efforts in this direction.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as I know, the majority\r\n\r\nof  Ambassadors  abroad  are  males.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs should look around for\r\n\r\nsuitable female candidates to become Ambassadresses\r\n\r\nbecause I feel that they are more adept as  far  as\r\n\r\ndiplomacy  is concerned and perhaps they can  bring\r\n\r\nmore  benefits to our country. If at the moment  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  have  suitable  candidates,  I  think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  send some women  with  adequate\r\n\r\nintelligence  to be trained overseas so  that  they\r\n\r\ncan  be  appointed  as  Ambassadresses  in  various\r\n\r\ncountries in future.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, several\r\n\r\nMembers have spoken on foreign policy. I would like\r\n\r\nto   take  up  one  point.  I  see  that  with  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  our so many  overseas  missions,\r\n\r\nonly  the  High Commission in London  has  a  Trade\r\n\r\nCommissioner. As far as I can remember,  the  Trade\r\n\r\nCommissioner's  Office in London was  set  up  long\r\n\r\nbefore  the High Commission was set up. As  I  said\r\n\r\nyesterday,   trade  may  not  be  a   provider   of\r\n\r\nemployment  in our economy. However, I  am  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion that trade is still a vital factor  in  our\r\n\r\neconomy.  In this respect. I would like to  suggest\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister  for Foreign Affairs  that  Trade\r\n\r\nSecretaries  be appointed to overseas  missions  so\r\n\r\nthat   they  can  help  to  promote  trade  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and the many countries in which  we  have\r\n\r\nsuch missions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\ndisagree with most of what has been said except  to\r\n\r\nclarify  some queries raised by some hon.  Members.\r\n\r\nOne  is with regard to Japan. One hon. Member  felt\r\n\r\nthat the system of priorities has not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  as  it  should have been.  Perhaps  I  should\r\n\r\nexplain  that sometimes priorities are decided  not\r\n\r\nby an objective standard of priorities but in terms\r\n\r\nof  the  persons  available,  A  man  for  such  an\r\n\r\nimportant  post as Commissioner in Japan will  have\r\n\r\nto  be a man of high calibre. There were one or two\r\n\r\nother places which were equally important, like New\r\n\r\nYork and London, and therefore we had to leave this\r\n\r\npost  vacant  not  because  of  anything  else  but\r\n\r\nbecause  we  could  not find a man  of  appropriate\r\n\r\ncalibre  to  be sent there, In fact, we  found  one\r\n\r\nbut, as I said earlier, unfortunately, he died.  We\r\n\r\ncould  not fill the post and we had to look around,\r\n\r\nI quite agree that Japan is just as important to us\r\n\r\nas any of the missions that we have established. It\r\n\r\nis  a  matter  of waiting for the right  person,  a\r\n\r\nperson  appropriate to Japan. Obviously,  a  person\r\n\r\nwho  goes to Japan must be well versed in trade and\r\n\r\nmust  be  as  sharp as the Japanese in  matters  of\r\n\r\ncommerce,  trade and industry. If  there  are  such\r\n\r\npeople,  they  are  already  well  established   in\r\n\r\nbusiness  concerns of their own and  they  are  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily going to enter the diplomatic service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, Sir, I would just like to clarify that\r\n\r\nsometimes  the systems of priorities are determined\r\n\r\nmore   by   other  factors  than  by  just   giving\r\n\r\nimportance to any particular mission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Indonesia -I think this point was\r\n\r\nraised by the Member for Sembawang -we have a Trade\r\n\r\nLiaison  Office there. Here again, we  are  looking\r\n\r\nfor   an   appropriate  man  to  head  this  rather\r\n\r\nimportant mission which involves both economic  and\r\n\r\ncommercial   knowledge   as   well   as   political\r\n\r\nperception in this part of the world. So we have to\r\n\r\nwait  until such time as such a person is available\r\n\r\n-the Indonesians themselves are equally anxious  to\r\n\r\nfind a suitable man -to take this job as Ambassador\r\n\r\nin Indonesia. We are not definitely in the habit of\r\n\r\nsetting  up  missions for the sake  of  setting  up\r\n\r\nmissions.  We would rather not establish a  mission\r\n\r\nif  we are satisfied that we have not got the right\r\n\r\npersonnel to go with it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to ASEAN, I do not want to launch\r\n\r\ninto a long lecture because I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  already made a statement in Parliament as  to\r\n\r\nwhat it is all about, except to say that since then\r\n\r\nthe  Standing  Committee which was established  has\r\n\r\nmet, I think, twice. At least, they are supposed to\r\n\r\nhave  met last month. I think it has been postponed\r\n\r\nto  January to consider certain specific schemes -I\r\n\r\nhope  seriously  -so  that by  the  time  the  next\r\n\r\nministerial  conference takes place, we  will  have\r\n\r\nsomething very tangible to agree upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with the Member for Punggol that we\r\n\r\nshould  set up Trade Secretaries, Trade Offices  or\r\n\r\nTrade  Representatives. If he had listened  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance, he would have heard that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  did indicate that this year we intend  to\r\n\r\nestablish  a  number  of  Trade  Offices  or  Trade\r\n\r\nRepresentatives. In fact, we already have  them  in\r\n\r\nthe  United States and Hong Kong and we  intend  to\r\n\r\nestablish  a  few such offices in  other  parts  of\r\n\r\nEurope.  But here again, it is a matter of  finding\r\n\r\nthe  right  person, because a very good businessman\r\n\r\nis  not  going to give up a very lucrative business\r\n\r\nespecially at this time in Singapore. If the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Punggol  has  any bright,  honest  or  upright\r\n\r\npersons  in mind, we will certainly be prepared  to\r\n\r\nconsider  any suggestions with regard to  potential\r\n\r\nTrade Representatives.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Delta that it would\r\n\r\nbe  a  very  good  thing if we  could  have  female\r\n\r\ndiplomats. I think it will make my job much easier,\r\n\r\nbecause  not only do I have difficulties with  male\r\n\r\ndiplomats but I think that male diplomats  do  have\r\n\r\ndifficulties  with  some of the  diplomats  in  the\r\n\r\ncountries  to which they are assigned. I  am  quite\r\n\r\nsure  that  female diplomats will have  that  extra\r\n\r\ntouch  which may be able to influence countries  to\r\n\r\nbe  more favourably disposed toward us than if they\r\n\r\nhad   to  contend  with  male  diplomats  and  High\r\n\r\nCommissioners. However, the difficulty is that very\r\n\r\nfew ladies in the Republic of Singapore seem to  be\r\n\r\nattracted  by  foreign service, We  have  solicited\r\n\r\napplications from potential lady diplomats  and  so\r\n\r\nfar  the response has been poor. There was one case\r\n\r\nwhere the lady was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhighly suitable for the diplomatic career. I  think\r\n\r\nshe was chosen, but after a while she wrote back to\r\n\r\nsay  that she had changed her mind. I am not  quite\r\n\r\nsure  whether  other  interests  had  developed  in\r\n\r\nbetween  her  being appointed and  her  being  sent\r\n\r\naway.  But  as  far  as  our policy  is  concerned,\r\n\r\neverybody  who has the capability and the necessary\r\n\r\nqualities, regardless of whether he is a male or  a\r\n\r\nfemale,  will  be  considered and accepted  by  the\r\n\r\nForeign Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I wish to withdraw the\r\n\r\namendment, Sir.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $7,395,530 for Head 0501 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.
