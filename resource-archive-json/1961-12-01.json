The detailed time-table  arrangements\r\n\r\nfrom day to day will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in accordance with the principle of\r\n\r\nequal  treatment  for  the  four  language  streams  of\r\n\r\neducation  in Singapore, I am pleased to announce  that\r\n\r\nthose who pass the Government Secondary IV examination,\r\n\r\nin   Chinese,  will  be  eligible  to  apply  for   100\r\n\r\nbursaries, which will be tenable for two years in Upper\r\n\r\nSecondary classes, valued at $420 per annum. The  award\r\n\r\nof bursaries will, as usual, be based on academic merit\r\n\r\nand  financial need. This. Sir, is similar to  the  100\r\n\r\nbursaries  now  available to students  in  the  English\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools  who  passed  the  Cambridge  School\r\n\r\nCertificate Examination and are attending two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears  of  upper secondary classes prior to taking  the\r\n\r\nCambridge Higher School Certificate Examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be pertinent to ask, Mr Speaker, Sir, why this\r\n\r\nboycott  has failed and why the evil men who  tried  to\r\n\r\nuse  misguided students as cover for their sinister and\r\n\r\ndangerous political operations have been reduced  to  a\r\n\r\nstate of impotent frustration. The first reason is that\r\n\r\nthe   Government,  in  tackling  this  delicate  issue,\r\n\r\nsteadfastly refused to fall into the pro-Communist trap\r\n\r\nof  hitting  out  at the misguided and excited  student\r\n\r\npicketers in order to get at the manipulators  who  hid\r\n\r\nbehind the students and who in their cowardly way  used\r\n\r\nthe  bodies  of  school children as their  shield.  The\r\n\r\nsecond  reason  is that the stand of the Government  on\r\n\r\nthis issue was a just and sensible one. That being  so,\r\n\r\npublic  opinion  was  on the side of  the  Government's\r\n\r\nstand which was that no one was compelled to take  this\r\n\r\nexamination.  It  is  quite clear  from  what  happened\r\n\r\nduring  the  past  one week that the vast  majority  of\r\n\r\nstudents  wanted  to  take  this  examination.  Despite\r\n\r\nintimidation   by   politically   manipulated   student\r\n\r\npicketers,  more than half of the students  braved  the\r\n\r\npickets  to take the examination. If there had been  no\r\n\r\nintimidation by hostile and unruly picketers, there  is\r\n\r\nno  doubt  that the attendance would have been  higher.\r\n\r\nThis  is shown by today's attendance. As the dispirited\r\n\r\npicketers melted away, more students turned up for  the\r\n\r\nexamination.  The third reason why this boycott  failed\r\n\r\nis  that  students and parents on their own  initiative\r\n\r\ndecided  that  they were not going to be cowed  by  the\r\n\r\npicketers and their cowardly leaders. Gone are the days\r\n\r\nwhen  students and parents could be intimidated in this\r\n\r\nfashion.  The  moment students and parents  decided  to\r\n\r\nstand up to the picketers and to exercise their rights,\r\n\r\nthe  so-called boycott collapsed like a house of cards.\r\n\r\nThis  should  be  a  good lesson to  the  pro-Communist\r\n\r\nconspirators  that the days are gone  when  they  could\r\n\r\nintimidate  the  people  and  bamboozle  students   and\r\n\r\nparents with false slogans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past week's events have shown clearly that there\r\n\r\nis no real foundation for the myth that Chinese schools\r\n\r\nare  centres  of unrest and indiscipline.  Last  week's\r\n\r\nevents  have proved that the vast majority  of  Chinese\r\n\r\nschool   students,  like  students  in  other  language\r\n\r\nstreams,   are  not  only  basically  law-abiding   and\r\n\r\nresponsible, but will not hesitate to stand up  bravely\r\n\r\nfor  what  is  right and fair, in standing  up  to  the\r\n\r\npicketers, they were asserting their rights as students\r\n\r\nto  take an examination which would not only equip them\r\n\r\neducationally but also enable them as educated citizens\r\n\r\nto  contribute  to  the welfare  and  progress  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's Free Press there is a picture, Sir, of\r\n\r\nparents and supporters standing outside the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation to protect students, who wish to sit for  the\r\n\r\nexamination,  from the picketers. You  will  see,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  unlike  the picketers there are no  handkerchiefs\r\n\r\ntied  around their faces to hide their faces.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  they have nothing to be ashamed of. There  was\r\n\r\nno reason for these people to hide their faces from the\r\n\r\npeople. But not so the picketers. They all had to  hide\r\n\r\nbehind handkerchiefs. They dared not reveal their  true\r\n\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students who sat for the examination and who\r\n\r\nforced  their way through booing and sometimes  violent\r\n\r\npickets  are the kind of Malayans and citizens on  whom\r\n\r\nwe  base our hopes for a peaceful, prosperous and happy\r\n\r\nMalaya.  Contrast them with the misguided students  who\r\n\r\nwere  tricked  into  picketing instead  of  taking  the\r\n\r\nexamination.  They have wasted a year  of  study.  They\r\n\r\nhave got nothing out of the picketing and their leaders\r\n\r\nwill  not be able to make good this loss. These leaders\r\n\r\nwill  abandon these misguided students and  seek  fresh\r\n\r\nstooges and reckless adventures elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmay  I  seek clarification on one point?

I also related  briefly\r\n\r\nhow   the  Communists  and  pro-Communists  in   Malaya\r\n\r\nmanipulated,  manoeuvred and posed themselves  as  true\r\n\r\nMalayan  nationalists. Mr Speaker, Sir, at that  time,\r\n\r\nthe Malayan nationalist fighters were quite prepared to\r\n\r\nstruggle  in close co-operation with them  so  long  as\r\n\r\nthey  did  not  infringe  or transgress  upon  national\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the amendment of the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown, I said yesterday that it has at least  four\r\n\r\nveiled motives. It is evident that party interests  and\r\n\r\nparty  ideology  take first place, with  the  Communist\r\n\r\nback-room  boys giving instructions. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nif  the  Barisan  Sosialis and other political  Parties\r\n\r\nhaving  an identical political ideology are sincere  in\r\n\r\nwanting a full and complete merger, why have the  words\r\n\r\n\"complete   merger\"  not  been  inserted  without   the\r\n\r\nnecessity to accentuate citizenship? In other words,  a\r\n\r\ncomplete   merger   means   the   acceptance    without\r\n\r\nqualification of the present policies of the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya on citizenship, education, labour,  language\r\n\r\nand other matters. But this is not what they asked for.\r\n\r\nTheir  contention is that the rights and  interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  people of the Federation are our rights, but, that\r\n\r\nthe  rights  and interests of the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncannot  be  interfered with by the Federation.  Surely,\r\n\r\nthis  is  not the spirit of give and take,  and  it  is\r\n\r\nunjust.  Even  small children understand this  kind  of\r\n\r\narithmetical calculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday the Member for Thomson - he\r\n\r\nis  not  here at the moment - posed at least 16 questions\r\n\r\nwhich he himself answered. The questions posed were why\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore could not get this and that and\r\n\r\nwhether   the  Nanyang  University  diplomas  will   be\r\n\r\nrecognised  by  the  Federation of  Malaya.  All  those\r\n\r\nquestions  are  just  like  asking  rights   from   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya. This means that we are  prepared\r\n\r\nto take but not to give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a married man and my wife is my\r\n\r\nwife,  of  course;  but if the wife of  another  person\r\n\r\nbecomes  my  wife,  this is not fair.  If  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  and other political Parties which  share  the\r\n\r\nviews  of  the Barisan Sosialis are really sincere  and\r\n\r\nresponsible  in  their  desire for  merger,  they  must\r\n\r\nopenly   declare  their  acceptance  of   the   present\r\n\r\nFederation  Constitution - chapter and verse.  They  must\r\n\r\nalso  be  prepared  to  give  an  undertaking  to  this\r\n\r\nAssembly and to all the people of Singapore that  their\r\n\r\nstand  is acceptable and that the people will be behind\r\n\r\nthem,  otherwise they should not try and hide behind  a\r\n\r\nsmokescreen  or attempt to fish in troubled  waters  or\r\n\r\ntry to poke at a hornet's nest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many of the points raised by the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown in support of his amendment  have\r\n\r\nalready  been  adequately dealt with by my  colleagues,\r\n\r\nbut  all the same I wish to add a little here and there\r\n\r\nto give it a finishing touch, just like adding a little\r\n\r\nmore  spice to the gravy to make it more appetising.  I\r\n\r\nwill be brief, of course, and do not intend to beat the\r\n\r\nrecord of the speech of the Member for Queenstown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Queenstown was in a rage when he attempted to convince the House that he and his Party alone were the real saviours of Singapore. Let us\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  accusations that he hurled  against  the\r\n\r\nnationalist fighters, independence through merger,  the\r\n\r\ntabling  of  the  White  Paper, and  the  motion  under\r\n\r\ndebate. He said that Singapore has been sold, that  the\r\n\r\nTunku wants Singapore but not her people and that  when\r\n\r\nBritish colonialism goes out of the front door, another\r\n\r\nform  of colonialism will enter from the back door.  He\r\n\r\nequated  Singapore to the position of a  mistress,  its\r\n\r\npeople   as  second-class  citizens,  and  many   other\r\n\r\nhackneyed phrases such as those uttered by a prostitute\r\n\r\nto her lover or to the man who keeps her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to the linguist, it is evident that\r\n\r\nthe language of the Member for Queenstown is, according\r\n\r\nto  an  old  Malay adage, \"As the tree, so the  fruit.\"\r\n\r\nLanguage reflects the mind. Your\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndemeanour  reflects your character. Now,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  everything  is clear to us. The  evidence  is  as\r\n\r\nclear as daylight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the basis of unity and solidarity of\r\n\r\na  nation is the devotion and undivided loyalty of  its\r\n\r\ncitizens  to  the State. The absence of  these  factors\r\n\r\nwill  result in the destruction of the State.  \"When  a\r\n\r\nhouse  is on fire, the rats run helter skelter,\" - so\r\n\r\ngoes another Malay saying. Mr Speaker, Sir, therefore,\r\n\r\nundivided  loyalty is one of the absolute prerequisites\r\n\r\nfor  a  strong  and united nation and  State.  Only  by\r\n\r\nsacrifices  can we prove our sincerity and  loyalty  to\r\n\r\nthe  State.  Take an easy example - for the  benefit  of\r\n\r\nMembers  who claim themselves to be representatives  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis - the Russian Communist Party. Yuri\r\n\r\nGagarin, the first cosmonaut, was accepted as a  fully-fledged  member  of  the Russian Communist  Party  only\r\n\r\nafter  his  perilous performance of orbiting round  the\r\n\r\nearth.  This was a sacrifice. Mr Speaker, when  I  say\r\n\r\nthat  the basis of unity and strength of a nation rests\r\n\r\non  the undivided loyalty of the citizens, it does  not\r\n\r\nimply  that  I  am  accusing the people  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhether  in  this  House  or  outside,  that  they  are\r\n\r\ndisloyal to the State. That is not my intention at all,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was listening attentively to the greater part of the\r\n\r\nspeeches  made by the Opposition Members,  particularly\r\n\r\nfrom  the group of 13 who style themselves the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, and who have all the time been emphasising on\r\n\r\nautomatic citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Mr Speaker, that there is no one in this\r\n\r\nAssembly who will not agree to automatic citizenship if\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government is willing to  accept  this.\r\n\r\nThe  Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya,  Tunku\r\n\r\nAbdul Rahman, rejected this demand, as contained in his\r\n\r\ncommunication  dated  13th  November,  1961,   to   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Prime  Minister,  and  circulated   to   all\r\n\r\nMembers.  The decision of the Tunku, according  to  his\r\n\r\nletter rejecting this demand, clearly reflects the view\r\n\r\nof the people of the Federation of Malaya. This\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nview  is based on the Federation Constitution, although\r\n\r\nArticle  22  of the Constitution states that Parliament\r\n\r\ncan decide and determine the rights of the people of  a\r\n\r\nnew  State  on  joining the Federation.  But  can  this\r\n\r\ndemand  he  acceptable to the Members of Parliament  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation? The views of the Prime Minister, Tunku\r\n\r\nAbdul Rahman, represent the stand of his Government and\r\n\r\nthe Alliance Party, which is now in power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this motion were moved in Parliament, I am sure the\r\n\r\nPan-Malayan   Islamic  Party  would  rise   in   strong\r\n\r\nopposition.  There may be a handful  of  men  who  will\r\n\r\nsupport the demand of the Barisan Sosialis in Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- people like Mr D. R. Seenivasagam, Mr Lim Kean Siew,\r\n\r\nand  a  few  other puppets, representing only  a  small\r\n\r\nminority in the Parliament. In facing a national  issue\r\n\r\nthat involves a multi-racial society like Singapore, we\r\n\r\nmust attempt to resolve it in a spirit of sincerity and\r\n\r\ncompromise   which  will  riot  adversely  affect   the\r\n\r\ninterests  of any particular section in the  community.\r\n\r\nIn  order to prove and demonstrate our loyalty  to  the\r\n\r\nState, we should be prepared to make sacrifices.  There\r\n\r\nis  no  struggle that does not call for  sacrifice.  We\r\n\r\nmust study the historical background of our fatherland,\r\n\r\nand we should accordingly be guided in our struggle  to\r\n\r\nachieve national objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we should not allow ourselves to be carried away by sentiments, because this will be detrimental to our national unity, which has been\r\n\r\ndeveloped by our nationalist heroes who have sacrificed\r\n\r\ntheir  all  and  who  have  undergone  repressive   and\r\n\r\noppressive  treatment  in the  past.  Mr  Speaker,  no\r\n\r\nstruggle will be achieved in one day, just as Rome  was\r\n\r\nnot  built  in  a day. Therefore, we, as leaders  of  a\r\n\r\nnation, fighters of the State, must have cool minds and\r\n\r\nseek  all  avenues of approach in order to resolve  our\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  In  this way we can demonstrate  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  that we are citizens with an undivided  loyalty\r\n\r\nto  the State and thereby convince our brothers in  the\r\n\r\nFederation that we are truly their brethren of the same\r\n\r\nnation and enjoying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  same fate. To true Malayan nationalists or to  the\r\n\r\nself-proclaimed leaders, this should be the first  task\r\n\r\nwhich  they must discharge. To be overcome by political\r\n\r\nsentiments  and party ideologies in order  to  win  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  people will not  solve  our  national\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, to those who allege that\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  been  sold to the Federation,  or  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  he  colonised  by  Malaya,   or   that\r\n\r\nSingapore   will  become  another  Manchuria,   I   say\r\n\r\ncategorically and in all frankness that such people are\r\n\r\ninsincere  and  that they do not regard Malaya  as  the\r\n\r\nobject  of their sole and undivided loyalty. I wish  to\r\n\r\nrepeat this, Mr Speaker - such people are insincere  and\r\n\r\nthey  do not regard Malaya as the object of their  sole\r\n\r\nand  undivided  loyalty. My charge  is  justified,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, for we are all agreed unanimously that  Malaya\r\n\r\nand Singapore are one, that is to say, one country.  We\r\n\r\nare in the process of building a united Malayan nation.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  those who regard themselves  as  aliens  or\r\n\r\nregard  Singapore as an alien country clearly  consider\r\n\r\nthemselves un-Malayans. It is impossible for  a  nation\r\n\r\nto  colonise its own people. The people in  Malaya  are\r\n\r\nall  our  brothers, of the same kind and  enjoying  the\r\n\r\nsame fate. The same can he said for those who refuse to\r\n\r\nacknowledge Singapore as being a part of the Federation\r\n\r\nof Malaya. If Formosa reverts to the mainland of China,\r\n\r\ndoes  it  mean that the Republic of China is colonising\r\n\r\nFormosa  or  Taiwan?  It  is a different  case  if  the\r\n\r\nAmericans  go  to  Formosa or Taiwan.  But  if  Formosa\r\n\r\nreverts  to Communist China, to me it is not a form  of\r\n\r\ncolonisation.  If  they really contend  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nforms  part  of the Federation of Malaya  and  that  we\r\n\r\nbelong  to the same nation and are known as the  people\r\n\r\nof  Malaya, then there is nothing to fear. I  feel  the\r\n\r\ndebate in this Assembly would have taken the form of  a\r\n\r\nmore sincere and sober note, and such diatribes as  \"to\r\n\r\ncolonise\", \"sell-out\", \"Manchurian incident\",  or  what\r\n\r\nhave  you, would not have been uttered in this Assembly\r\n\r\nby  people  with  any sense of decency at  all  towards\r\n\r\ntheir brothers in the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, of course, we can discuss our rights and our grievances. Or we can even ask for complete merger and so on. This is in the true spirit of democratic\r\n\r\npractice.  But  to  indulge in such  vituperation  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  result in explosive consequences detrimental\r\n\r\nto  our efforts to bring about unity to our people, and\r\n\r\nto  create  a united Malayan nation in our multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I sincerely exhort and appeal from the bottom of my heart to all those who have found themselves astray at the end of the road to go back to\r\n\r\nthe  start  so  that they may not get  completely  lost\r\n\r\naltogether.  The  allegation that the  Singapore  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has succeeded in persuading and convincing the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  of  the  Federation  of  Malaya   with\r\n\r\nfrightening  stories  is,  I  believe,  tantamount   to\r\n\r\nridiculing  a  Government  which  was  elected  by  the\r\n\r\npeople.  It is also an insult to the people of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nwho have elected their Prime Minister, that their Prime\r\n\r\nMinister can easily be influenced by the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nof Singapore. I am saying this in the interest of unity\r\n\r\nof  both the peoples of the two territories. There  are\r\n\r\npeople  who  say  that  this merger  proposal  was  not\r\n\r\nwritten  in the P.A.P. Five-Year Plan and so  why  must\r\n\r\nmerger be accelerated? Does it mean that we shall  have\r\n\r\nto  wait?  May I ask; until Mr D. R. Seenivasagam,  or\r\n\r\nMr  Lim  Kean Siew, or even the stooges, or  even  the\r\n\r\nMalayan  Communist  Party,  hold  the  reins   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  government, who can achieve  merger  before\r\n\r\nus? Answer yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the challenge that\r\n\r\ngeneral elections should be held both in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nin the Federation, I feel that as regards Singapore the\r\n\r\nchallenge has already been answered but I will  further\r\n\r\nanswer it later on. With regard to the Federation,  let\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  the  Federation  themselves  give  the\r\n\r\nanswer. It is hardly becoming of us if we in Singapore,\r\n\r\nas  one of the twelve States of the Federation, were to\r\n\r\ndemand our brothers in the other eleven States to  obey\r\n\r\nour  beckoning.  This is yet another  instance  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan's own vileness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown has posed this question:\r\n\r\n\"Has  our  Prime  Minister carried  the  fight  for  an\r\n\r\nequality of status for the people of Singapore into the\r\n\r\nFederation  Parliament?\" I feel this question  is  like\r\n\r\nthe  nightmare of a person who is sleeping  during  the\r\n\r\nday.  We are not as yet merged with the Federation.  We\r\n\r\nhave no representatives in the Federation Parliament to\r\n\r\nvoice our demands. Tarry a while until the time when we\r\n\r\ncan  send our representatives to the Federal Parliament\r\n\r\nwhen  merger has taken place. In the meantime, I wonder\r\n\r\nwhether   the  Barisan  Sosialis  already  have   their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives or agents in the Federation Parliament,\r\n\r\nin  the  persons of Mr Lim Kean Siew  and  Mr  D.  R.\r\n\r\nSeenivasagam,  to  put forward their  demands.  That  I\r\n\r\nwould not like to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, with regard to \"merger\", several Members of the Assembly have given various definitions. There are those who say that merger is like a marriage. But\r\n\r\nthere  are  different kinds of marriages. I  am  not  a\r\n\r\ndoctor of matrimony, Mr Speaker, Sir, and perhaps that\r\n\r\nis  why  I  find it somewhat perplexings to grasp  this\r\n\r\nanalogy. If the analogy of matrimony is advanced, I say\r\n\r\nsurely  you would not expect to beget yourself a  child\r\n\r\non  the  morrow of your wedding day. Unless, of course,\r\n\r\nthere are other ways of begetting legal children! I  am\r\n\r\nnot  a doctor like the Member for Nee Soon. For me, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I would draw the analogy of a big river  with\r\n\r\ntwelve  minor tributaries. Eleven of these  tributaries\r\n\r\nhave been freed of obstruction and have joined the main\r\n\r\nriver.  But one of these tributaries has had a  harrier\r\n\r\nplaced at its confluence, so that its water is not free\r\n\r\nto  flow  out into the main river. When the harrier  at\r\n\r\nthe  confluence is removed, the water will be  able  to\r\n\r\nflow  freely to join the main river. However,  upon  so\r\n\r\ndoing,   the   water  from  the  tributary   will   not\r\n\r\nautomatically  change its characteristic.  That  is  to\r\n\r\nsay,  its  taste, its colour, and so on,  will  not  be\r\n\r\nidentical with those of the water in the main river. It\r\n\r\nis only after it has undergone several phases of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  tide  that its identity will be completely  merged\r\n\r\nwith that of the rest, in the fullest sense of the word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if there is anyone whose thinking is\r\n\r\nconfused  and  whose stand is wavering  and  uncertain,\r\n\r\nthat  person is the Member for Cairnhill. There  was  a\r\n\r\ntime  when he would thump his chest and proudly exclaim\r\n\r\nthat  only his Party could bring about merger with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya. But now the hollowness  of  his\r\n\r\nwords  are  only too obvious. Nevertheless, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill  has  other excuses to  put  forward  to\r\n\r\nexplain why he cannot concede that the basic agreements\r\n\r\nas contained in the White Paper do, in fact, constitute\r\n\r\nmerger between Singapore and the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, he merely depends on the newspapers. But he did not take into consideration the paper-work that has been going on. We have not forgotten yet, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, that the Secretary-General of the S.P.A.,  Mr\r\n\r\nLim Choon Mong, who was also probably an adviser to the\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill, and sometime ago that  only  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. could succeed in bringing about merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Where is the relevance to  the\r\n\r\namendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I feel, Mr Speaker, that we\r\n\r\nare now on the question of merger, and I am replying to\r\n\r\nthe  arguments that have been put forward by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill, who is a representative of his Party  in\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly. Therefore, I was touching on  his  stand\r\n\r\nand  that of his Party on the question of merger  which\r\n\r\nwe are now debating in this Assembly. But, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nwhat  can the Member for Cairnhill say now? He can only\r\n\r\nsay, \"If the S.P.A. were in power, we too would be able\r\n\r\nto  achieve  what is contained in the White  Paper,  or\r\n\r\neven more.\" As the Malay saying has it. \"When the house\r\n\r\nis  completed, the chisel is heard. When the matter  is\r\n\r\nsettled, you put in your word.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do not wish to speak a great deal about the Member for Cairnhill. It appears to me that the demeanour of the Member for Anson is no different.\r\n\r\nIntentionally or unintentionally, he has been defending\r\n\r\nhis clients from the Barisan Sosialis who, according to\r\n\r\nhim,  are  in a pitiable state as the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave no legal adviser in this House. But the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  is  forgetting  that  they  have  many  advisers\r\n\r\nwaiting outside this Assembly. According to the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson,  the amendment proposed by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  is to make the definition of \"merger\"  more\r\n\r\ncomplete.  What  is  surprising  is  this.  Why  should\r\n\r\ncitizenship  alone complete the definition  of  merger?\r\n\r\nWhy  not  say, \"Full merger\", which by itself  embraces\r\n\r\nthe   question  of  citizenship,  education,  language,\r\n\r\nculture, internal security, etc.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what is even more surprising is that\r\n\r\nhe  and  his own Party have not yet decided on a  clear\r\n\r\nstand  on  the question of merger. In his  speech  last\r\n\r\nThursday,  he showed his considerable skill at  staking\r\n\r\nhis bets. His habit is to have a stake on all sides  so\r\n\r\nthat  he will not be a loser. If there are four digits,\r\n\r\nhe  will  lay his stake on all the four digits so  that\r\n\r\nwhichever  way  it goes, he will not be the  loser.  So\r\n\r\nalso is his strategem in politics. He wants merger with\r\n\r\nthe   Federation.  He  also  desires  independence  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  He  welcomes full internal self-government.\r\n\r\nHe  also welcomes an international status for Singapore\r\n\r\nwith the State being placed under the protection of the\r\n\r\nUnited   Nations.  Indeed,  he  will  even  countenance\r\n\r\nSingapore deteriorating into another Congo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech last week, he showed his true form once\r\n\r\nagain.  He said, \"Curse the Communists!\" He also  said,\r\n\r\n\"Beware of the Members of the Barisan Sosialis, who are\r\n\r\npro-Communists,  and  beware of  their  intelligentsia.\r\n\r\nThen  he  went  on  to say. \"Tunku Abdul  Rahman  is  a\r\n\r\nforemost statesman, sincere and honest.\" But he did not\r\n\r\nadmit  to  having  played up the  theme  of  Communism.\r\n\r\n\"Support the special rights of the Malays.\" he said. In\r\n\r\nthe same breath, he said, \"Cursed be those who say only\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese are Communists.\" Thus, where does he stand, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker?  He is here, and he is there, so  that  he  is\r\n\r\nloaded  with stands which are all calculated to  be  to\r\n\r\nhis  good. This is the demeanour and disposition  of  a\r\n\r\nMember  who brings a hammer into this House. Whom  does\r\n\r\nhe want to scare and hammer, Mr Speaker?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Mr Speaker, Sir, the time has come. Before  us\r\n\r\nnow  lies  the national issue to be decided by  us.  We\r\n\r\nwish to see every Member of the Assembly declaring  his\r\n\r\nstand - whether he is with the nationalists or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it was queer to note the Member for Nee Soon assuming the mannerism of a professor when he analysed the P.A.P. souvenir booklet - \"The Tasks\r\n\r\nAhead.\"  He  made  himself out to be  a  truly  genuine\r\n\r\nsocialist  after having read only a few  pamphlets  and\r\n\r\nbooklets.  Unfortunately, he is not here.  He  analysed\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P. struggle  in  the  manner  of  Khrushchev\r\n\r\nanalysing  the  struggle of Stalin and those  of  other\r\n\r\nmajor leaders of Communist Russia. He then came to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion  that  the  policy carried  out  by  Stalin,\r\n\r\nMolotov, Malinkov and others have all deviated from the\r\n\r\ntrue  Communist policies. Thus it was with  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Nee  Soon  when he analysed the  P.A.P. struggle.\r\n\r\nBecause  he  could not undertake the responsibility  of\r\n\r\ncollective  leadership, he came to the conclusion  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. has deviated from its true socialist stand.\r\n\r\nThis   is  the  same  deviationist  attitude   of   the\r\n\r\nCommunists. For our part, Mr Speaker, Sir, we who have\r\n\r\ngone  through  political stress and  strain  understand\r\n\r\nfull  well  the techniques of people of the Member  for\r\n\r\nNee  Soon's  ilk.  In order to uphold their  precarious\r\n\r\nstand,  they accuse others of having deviated.  Believe\r\n\r\nyou  me,  Mr Speaker, their seeming strength which  is\r\n\r\nthat of ice will not endure.

We are elected from political  Parties.\r\n\r\nSurely the results achieved whether in respect  of\r\n\r\nnational   development  or  of  merger   are   all\r\n\r\npolitical  achievements. If  you  plant  a  durian\r\n\r\ntree,  the fruit you expect to gather will  surely\r\n\r\nbe durians.

With regard to merger hindering\r\n\r\nthe spread and development of socialism, we can\r\n\r\nclearly see now why the Member for Nee Soon is\r\n\r\nafraid of merger. I say without hesitation that\r\n\r\nthis merely shows the Member's lack of knowledge\r\n\r\nof politics. I do not know if by socialism he\r\n\r\nmeans Communism. The people of Malaya previously\r\n\r\nwere not very alive to socialism even though there\r\n\r\nwere several aspects of it practised during their\r\n\r\nlife-time. Even so, socialism has not made very\r\n\r\nrapid progress then. Mr Speaker, socialism will\r\n\r\ncontinue to spread whether during the colonial\r\n\r\nregime or after Malaya has become independent and\r\n\r\nSingapore has achieved self-government. The spread\r\n\r\nof socialism will go on relentlessly like the tide\r\n\r\nwhich no obstruction can hinder. It is only\r\n\r\nnovices in politics who are unaware of this\r\n\r\nreality. We in the P.A.P., even after the\r\n\r\nachievement of merger, will resolutely remain a\r\n\r\nsocialist Party - a socialist, democratic, non-Communist Party - and will forever adhere to this\r\n\r\nideology. So long as the struggle is on\r\n\r\nconstitutional lines there need be no fear\r\n\r\nwhatsoever. In Malaya itself there are labour\r\n\r\nParties claiming to adhere to socialism. The Party\r\n\r\nRakyat with their proletarian ideology. We cannot\r\n\r\nsee wherein lies the obstacle to the spread and\r\n\r\ndevelopment of socialism that is feared by the\r\n\r\nMember for Nee Soon. Perhaps if the struggle is to\r\n\r\nbe carried out outside this Assembly on Communist\r\n\r\nlines, that is another matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Nee Soon drew attention to\r\n\r\nchauvinism. What did he say'? He said in Singapore\r\n\r\nthere   was  no  longer  any  chauvinism.  As   an\r\n\r\ninstance, he said Malay Members in the Government,\r\n\r\nincluding   myself,  were  returned   with   large\r\n\r\nmajorities  by  Chinese voters. I  do  acknowledge\r\n\r\nthat,  and  I  am  convinced that in  the  future,\r\n\r\nwhoever  stands for election, the result  will  be\r\n\r\nthe  same.  But why did the Member  for  Nec  Soon\r\n\r\nbring up this matter here in this House? Is there\r\n\r\nsome  hidden  motive  behind  it,  or  is  he  now\r\n\r\nattempting, as it were, to throw a brick and  then\r\n\r\nhide  his hand behind him? To bring up matters  of\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnature  is like imputing that it was we who had brought\r\n\r\nabout  chauvinism  and who were  not  grateful  to  the\r\n\r\nvoters  who had returned us. We would like to reiterate\r\n\r\nthat  we  always  appreciate the  stand  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nvoters.  Our stand is clear. Communalism is  the  enemy\r\n\r\nand the main obstacles in our efforts to bring about  a\r\n\r\nunited Malayan nation. Therefore, I say those who carry\r\n\r\nout the policy of communalism are indeed the enemies of\r\n\r\nevery  true Malayan nationalist in this young State  of\r\n\r\nours.  We  realise, and we are firmly  convinced,  that\r\n\r\nonly  a Party which is non-communal in outlook will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  succeed in the efforts to save the State  and\r\n\r\nbring about a united Malayan nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. is a socialist, democratic and non-Communist Party fighting towards that objective. We\r\n\r\nwere elected to the Assembly on the P.A.P. ticket,  and\r\n\r\nthe  people  in  our constituencies have  placed  their\r\n\r\nfaith in the P.A.P. as a socialist Party which is  non-communal. We stand resolutely on that firm policy.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  only waverers and saboteurs and cowards  will\r\n\r\nundertake   to  run  away  from  their  very  important\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.  They merely make utterances  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly, and with typical bovine docility they serve a\r\n\r\npurpose  like that of the proverbial cow which  gets  a\r\n\r\nname for the milk produced by the buffalo. This is  the\r\n\r\nattitude  of  people  who thump their  chests  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly like the blind man who has lost his stick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to Members of the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, especially the Member for Thomson who\r\n\r\nis not here, and who always says that the Government in\r\n\r\nthe Federation at the moment is a Right-wing Government\r\n\r\nand  its  education policy is misguided, and  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  as  a Left-wing political Party, has  gone  on\r\n\r\nbended  knees  to  this Government, implying  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has deviated to the Right, I feel this shows the\r\n\r\ntrue   colours   of  these  people.  This   shows   the\r\n\r\nshallowness  of these people in political know-how.  He\r\n\r\nand  his  comrades  are unable to  distinguish  between\r\n\r\nnational  and ideological matters. The merger of  these\r\n\r\ntwo territories is a national matter. The State is like\r\n\r\nan enterprise, whilst\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  political ideology is an instrument of  policy  by\r\n\r\nwhich  that  enterprise organises and  administers  its\r\n\r\naffairs.  Even  after  merger has  been  effected,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s   stand   will  resolutely  be  non-Communist,\r\n\r\nsocialist  and democratic. There is not a single  Party\r\n\r\nin  the  world  which can accept fully  the  policy  of\r\n\r\nanother  political  Party or another  government  whose\r\n\r\npolicy is diametrically opposed to its own ideology. We\r\n\r\nsay  that Communist China, Russia and Albania all  have\r\n\r\ndifferent policies. So to bring about a change  in  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  a  State would naturally take a  long  time\r\n\r\nuntil  the people of this State are prepared to  accept\r\n\r\nthe change in the policy and ideology of the Party.  We\r\n\r\nare   living   in   a  State  practising  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  For  instance. Party A may be  holding  the\r\n\r\nreigns  of government. The next day, it may be Party  B\r\n\r\nor  possibly  the  Barisan Sosialis.  Take  Kerala  for\r\n\r\ninstance.  After  the Communist Party  had  formed  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  in  the  following  general  election  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Kerala resisted and rejected the  Communist\r\n\r\nideology and elected instead the Congress Party to form\r\n\r\nthe  new  government. This is the practical reality  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy. If the Government  is  Right-wing  now,  this  should not be the reason  why  merger\r\n\r\nshould not take place. Merger should not be -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I hope the hon. Member is not getting\r\n\r\nangry  with the Speaker.

However frustrated  the  socialist\r\n\r\nmovement  may feel, we must have confidence to overcome\r\n\r\ndifficulties if only to safeguard the interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore from being reduced to second-class\r\n\r\ncitizens. As followers of socialism, we should be  able\r\n\r\nto stand firm in the face of great difficulties. In the\r\n\r\nhistory of world revolution, only progressive movements\r\n\r\ncan continue to survive and the retrogressive ones will\r\n\r\nalways go backwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the actions of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nare not for the interests of a few of us only. Whatever\r\n\r\nwe do is for the interest of the people of Singapore as\r\n\r\na  whole.  Our opinion is this. After a true merger  of\r\n\r\nthe  two  territories  is  achieved,  the  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and of the Federation of Malaya should  have\r\n\r\nthe  same citizenship rights. In other words, Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  should automatically become citizens  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya on Merger Day. This  proposal  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis is based on the interest  of  the\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore. But we have very often heard the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s arguments. They claim to be representative  of\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople.  They used to say that they wanted to sacrifice\r\n\r\nfor  the people, but now we have seen what they  really\r\n\r\nare. The time has come when many thousands of keen eyes\r\n\r\nare  watching whether the leadership of the P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nreally  sincere  in fighting for the interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore,  because the  destinies  of  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  Singapore  are  in  the  hands   of   the\r\n\r\nleadership of the P.A.P. This is a very dangerous  time\r\n\r\nfor  the  future welfare and interests of  the  people.\r\n\r\nThis is a very important period. The leadership of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. want  to  strengthen  their  own  interests  by\r\n\r\nselling  out  the  interests of the people.  They  have\r\n\r\ngiven  the  interests of the people of Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\ngift  to  other people. This is a very evil action.  If\r\n\r\nthe  leadership of the P.A.P. has really worked for the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the people of Singapore, then  when  they\r\n\r\ncome  to  this important test, it will be seen  whether\r\n\r\nthey  will  endure the test of fire.  In  other  words,\r\n\r\ntheir  real  faces  will be exposed - whether  they  are\r\n\r\nfoxes or angels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaders of the P.A.P. are opposed to our amendment\r\n\r\nto  the motion. They are opposed to our suggestion that\r\n\r\nwe  should  automatically become citizens  of  the  new\r\n\r\nFederation after reunification. They have put the blame\r\n\r\non  us, but actually the blame should be On themselves.\r\n\r\nTherefore, over 600,000 citizens will be sold  away  by\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. In this case, the history of Singapore will\r\n\r\ntell  our offspring that the leaders of the P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nthe sellers of our citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a nationalist, seeking nationalism\r\n\r\nat  a time when the two territories of our country  are\r\n\r\nseparated, will feel very sad about this because we are\r\n\r\npart  of  an independent entity, although we  had  been\r\n\r\nruled by colonialists for so long a time; and therefore\r\n\r\nin   an   independent  federation  this  aim  is   very\r\n\r\nattractive.  We should try to be part of an independent\r\n\r\nnation.  As  patriots  we  should  review  the  present\r\n\r\nsituation  when  the two territories  are  still  being\r\n\r\nseparated,   and   the  task  of  reuniting   the   two\r\n\r\nterritories  is the most important task which  everyone\r\n\r\nof  us  should undertake. The reunification of the  two\r\n\r\nterritories  is  what we want. It is  not  a  dishonest\r\n\r\ncheque.  We do not want to cheat the people. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis are never\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopposed  to  any  true  merger.

But  since  the\r\n\r\nsell-out of the people has been exposed, we the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  have  very positively and  realistically  put\r\n\r\nforward our stand on merger, and have announced this to\r\n\r\nall the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): What we really want is\r\n\r\na  kind of merger that looks after the interests of the\r\n\r\npeople,  and  not  after our own interests.

I do not want to say too much about it now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of citizenship rights after merger,\r\n\r\nonce again we have very often given a statement on  our\r\n\r\nviews and our stand. We have always insisted on a  true\r\n\r\nreunification of the two territories - that the  citizens\r\n\r\nof  Singapore should automatically become  citizens  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation. That is to say, the present 600,000 and\r\n\r\nmore  citizens  of Singapore, irrespective  of  whether\r\r\n\r\nthey  come from the Federation, India, Indonesia, China\r\n\r\nor  any other country, i.e. irrespective of their place\r\n\r\nof  origin,  should, according to  Article  22  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Constitution,  be  automatically  converted\r\n\r\ninto  citizens  at the Federation. This  is  the  basic\r\n\r\nstand  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  on  the  citizenship\r\n\r\nquestion.   This   is   the   basic   and   fundamental\r\n\r\nprerequisite and we will never give way an inch because\r\n\r\nthis is the basic right of the citizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, we have on many occasions heard the Prime Minister talk irrelevantly about merger and the citizenship issue, and not in accord with our\r\n\r\nproposals  in  regard to citizenship rights  and  other\r\n\r\nside  issues.  Instead  he has  tried  to  confuse  and\r\n\r\nmislead  the people. The Prime Minister has very  often\r\n\r\nsaid  that  complete merger will mean that  only  those\r\n\r\ncitizens who were born in Singapore could automatically\r\n\r\nbecome citizens of the Federation, This comes from  the\r\n\r\nhorse's  own mouth. We the Barisan Sosialis have  never\r\n\r\nsaid so. We wholeheartedly want to achieve what we have\r\n\r\nadvocated  and which is contained in the provisions  of\r\n\r\nArticle  22  of  the Federation of Malaya Constitution.\r\n\r\nUnder  Article  22  there is a clear  provision  saying\r\n\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If any new territory is admitted to the Federation in\r\n\r\npursuance of Article 2, Parliament may by law determine\r\n\r\nwhat  persons  are to be citizens by  reason  of  their\r\n\r\nconnection  with that territory and the date  or  dates\r\n\r\nfrom which such persons are to be citizens.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the question of citizenship rights, the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  of  the Federation has  expressed  his\r\n\r\nviews.  He  says that Singapore, apart from  the  three\r\n\r\nBornean  territories, i.e., Brunei,  North  Borneo  and\r\n\r\nSarawak, can be admitted in accordance with Article  22\r\n\r\nof the Federation Constitution. The people in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese   three  Bornean  territories  can  automatically\r\n\r\nbecome  citizens of the new Federation. Why cannot  the\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore automatically become the citizens\r\n\r\nof the new Federation? On 16th November, the Tunku said\r\n\r\nat  the  Singapore Airport that Singapore is a  naughty\r\n\r\nboy  because complete merger would cause unrest to  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  That is why the Federation does  not  want\r\n\r\nautomatic   conversion  of  Singapore   citizens   into\r\n\r\nFederation  citizens. But it is incorrect for  a  Party\r\n\r\nwhich  professes  to  be acting  and  working  for  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people of Singapore, to kow-tow to the\r\n\r\nFederation,  to  sell out the basic  interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  to make the citizens of Singapore second-class\r\n\r\ncitizens,  and  to let the citizens of  Singapore  have\r\n\r\nobligations  hut  no rights, to do  such  things.  This\r\n\r\nquestion is vital to the future and fate of the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. The question of citizenship in a  merger\r\n\r\nmust  be  solved  through discussions between  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories of Singapore and the Federation of  Malaya.\r\n\r\nOur stand is this. During the course of the discussions\r\n\r\non  merger  between the two territories, the Government\r\n\r\nshould state, as our basic principle, that from the day\r\n\r\nof    merger   all   citizens   of   Singapore   should\r\n\r\nautomatically become citizens of the new Federation. We\r\n\r\ninsist  that we should safeguard the interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. We, therefore, maintain positively\r\n\r\nthat  once  the  two territories are  merged,  all  the\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore should not lose their citizenship\r\n\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Barisan Sosialis want is that on merger, the\r\n\r\npresent   600,000  citizens  of  Singapore  should   be\r\n\r\nautomatically   converted   into   citizens   of    the\r\n\r\nFederation.  This request is right and  reasonable.  On\r\n\r\nthe   question   of  general  elections  and   electing\r\n\r\nrepresentatives   to  the  Federal  Parliament,   every\r\n\r\ncitizen should have the Pan-Malayan right to stand  for\r\n\r\nelection  or  to  vote at any place in the  Federation.\r\n\r\nThis  merger will have no meaning and no value  without\r\n\r\nthese  rights.  It is no merger at all. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. type of merger can be said to be a kind of sell-out   merger.  In  fact,  it  is  not  based   on   the\r\n\r\nreunification of the two territories, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is  not  in the interest of the people of  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories. All Malayan nationalists and patriots will\r\n\r\nresolutely  oppose this kind of merger. The  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore are now very concerned over this question  of\r\n\r\nmerger.  They are watching our progress.  Up  till  now\r\n\r\nthere  have been many classes and many groups of people\r\n\r\nwho  have  expressed  their views on  the  question  of\r\n\r\nmerger.  Yesterday  the  Chinese  Chamber  of  Commerce\r\n\r\nconvened an Executive Committee meeting to discuss this\r\n\r\nquestion.  They  urged that when  the  two  territories\r\n\r\nmerge,   the  interests  of  the  people  of  the   two\r\n\r\nterritories  should not be sold out.  They  decided  to\r\n\r\nconvene   a   meeting  of  representatives   of   civic\r\n\r\norganisations in Singapore to discuss the  question  of\r\n\r\nmerger and other related problems. I believe they  will\r\n\r\nreflect  the wishes and opinions of all the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.

This is not entirely  the\r\n\r\ndemand of a few Barisan Sosialis Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, on 21st November, the Minister for Finance touched on the question of genuine merger of the two territories, in particular, on the question of\r\n\r\nconversion   of   Singapore  citizenship   to   Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship. He admitted that the demand of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  is  in conformity with the interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore. He said that the reason  why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the Federation of Malaya did not agree to\r\n\r\nautomatic conversion of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens to Federal citizens is  that  there\r\n\r\nwere  Communist elements among the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut I well recall what our Prime Minister said. He said\r\n\r\nthat there were only 300 Communist agents in Singapore.\r\n\r\nHow  is  it  that it has now been increased to  620,000\r\n\r\nCommunists? Is it not possible that the P.A.P. leaders\r\n\r\nhave   taken  the  opponents  of  the  P.A.P. to  mean\r\n\r\nCommunists? So they now try to make the 620,000  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore out as communists and they are  going  to\r\n\r\nsell  out  the  rights of these people. If  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership  deny that the 620,000 people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nare  Communists, why then would they not fight for  the\r\n\r\nautomatic  conversion  of  these  citizens  to  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens  just  for the sake of a few Communists?  They\r\n\r\nwould  be arrested under the Internal Security  Council\r\n\r\nin  Malaya. Why should the Federation of Malaya  be  so\r\n\r\nafraid? I think the situation is not that simple.  What\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of Malaya want is not  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   What  they  want  is  the   territory   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. What the P.A.P. is trying to do is  to  sell\r\n\r\nout  the interests of the people of Singapore in  order\r\n\r\nto  safeguard  their  position.  Therefore,  they  have\r\n\r\ncollaborated  with  each  other  to  fulfil  their  own\r\n\r\npersonal, interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Minister for Finance has also said that after the merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya, the people of Singapore will\r\n\r\nretain  their  rights as Singapore citizens.  They  can\r\n\r\nstand  for  election in Singapore. The  people  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation can stand for election in the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya too. Does he mean that before the merger of  the\r\n\r\ntwo territories, the citizens of Singapore cannot stand\r\n\r\nfor  election in Singapore?

What then is\r\n\r\nthe meaning of this merger? The people of these two\r\n\r\nterritories will still continue to be separated. They\r\n\r\ncannot participate freely in a common political life.\r\n\r\nThey cannot enjoy common economic benefits. Only\r\n\r\nexternal affairs and defence will be in the hands of\r\n\r\nthe Federation Government. Furthermore, the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore will have to hand over $90 million to the\r\n\r\nFederation Government. If war were to break out in the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, or if the Federation wished to\r\n\r\nsend troops overseas, then the citizens of Singapore\r\n\r\nwould be conscripted. But the people of Singapore have\r\n\r\nno right on a national basis. Does it mean that we are\r\n\r\ngiving up $90 million just in exchange for the right to\r\n\r\nhave a national passport?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in these past few days we in\r\n\r\nthis House have been hearing speeches concerning merger\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation  of  Malaya.  Every  one  of  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  has his own particular ideas.  For  example,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Health and Law, speaking  about  his\r\n\r\nidea  of merger between the two territories, based  his\r\n\r\nspeech  on  the  law.  But  the  Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nadmitted  that it is in accordance with Article  22  of\r\n\r\nthe Federal Constitution, hut due to the Communists  in\r\n\r\nSingapore it is impossible to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, we have heard the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya admit on many occasions that with the reunification of the two territories,\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens will automatically become  citizens\r\n\r\nof  the Federation according to Article 22, so long  as\r\n\r\nit  is  passed  in  the  Federal  Parliament.  But  the\r\n\r\nquestion  is  whether  the  Federation  Government   is\r\n\r\nwilling to do so. We the Barisan Sosialis have moved an\r\n\r\namendment to the effect that Singapore citizens  should\r\n\r\nautomatically become citizens of the Federation. In the\r\n\r\npast  few  days, the P.A.P. leadership  have  found  no\r\n\r\nmaterial to refute our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narguments. Their minds are confused and they have  lost\r\n\r\ntheir  reasoning. The frank and sincere Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nof  the Federation of Malaya has also been despised  by\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. leaders. Therefore, in the past  few  days\r\n\r\nGovernment  Ministers have said that according  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation Constitution, Singapore citizens will not be\r\n\r\nable to become Federal citizens. They have to apply for\r\n\r\ncitizenship right or through naturalisation. In such  a\r\n\r\ncase, more than 600,000 citizens in Singapore will lose\r\n\r\ntheir citizenship right. The P.A.P. maintain that  they\r\n\r\nwant to keep Singapore citizenship. These are but false\r\n\r\nand  hypocritical  arguments. It is  just  like  a  cat\r\n\r\nshedding  tears  at  the plight of  the  rat.  So  very\r\n\r\npitiful  are  the  P.A.P. leadership.  They   are   on\r\n\r\ntenterhooks  and, at the same time, they have  offended\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister of the Federation of  Malaya.  The\r\n\r\nviews  of  the P.A.P. Ministers conflict with those  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  on  the question of  citizenship.  The\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister  of  the  Federation  has  said   that\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens could automatically become  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens  according to law. It could be done.  But  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Ministers have always maintained that it cannot\r\n\r\nbe  done.  They maintain that the citizens of Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  have  to apply in accordance with the citizenship\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Federation. From this, it can be seen\r\n\r\nthat -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Rajaratnam)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> On a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Point of order.

The legal experts of the P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nand the P.A.P. Ministers have perhaps been too confused\r\n\r\nin their opposition to the Barisan Sosialis' amendment.\r\n\r\nThey  have  thus  offended  the  Prime  Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya. The P.A.P. leadership  is  rather\r\n\r\npitiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Law (Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker,  for  almost  14  days  we  have  been\r\n\r\ndebating  this motion on merger to which  an  amendment\r\n\r\nhas  been moved by the Member for Queens-town. In every\r\n\r\nspeech of the Members from the Barisan Sosialis,  there\r\n\r\nis  not  one  argument put forth by them  that  can  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  as genuine and sincere. In fact,  when  the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown delivered his address, which took\r\n\r\nhim  7\ufffd  hours, I was under the impression  that  the\r\n\r\nleaders  of  the  Barisan Sosialis,  whether  they  are\r\n\r\nCommunists  or pro-Communist groups, were  prepared  to\r\n\r\nface  the hard fact that merger was inevitable. I  felt\r\n\r\nthat  they  were merely asking for the type  of  merger\r\n\r\nwhich  they  moved in the amendment, that  is  to  say,\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger  with automatic  citizenship  for  all\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens, and Singapore becoming the  twelfth\r\n\r\nState   in  the  Federation  of  Malaya.  However,   it\r\n\r\ntranspires  that  that  is not  what  they  asked  for,\r\n\r\nbecause  after  the 7\ufffd hours' marathon speech  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown on complete merger, citizenship,\r\n\r\nbasic  and fundamental rights, etc., it led us to think\r\n\r\nhe  did,  in  fact, want a complete merger. Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  this  means that he and the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nwant  independence through merger. Every Member of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  who  spoke  said  that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   would  struggle  for  full  internal   self-government for Singapore, if complete merger could  not\r\n\r\nbe  effected. Mr Deputy Speaker, the issue  before  us\r\n\r\nand the State is whether we want merger as outlined  in\r\n\r\nthe  basic agreements contained in the White Paper,  or\r\n\r\nmerger as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuggested by the Member for Queenstown. There  are  two\r\n\r\nchoices, Mr Deputy Speaker, and not three. The  reason\r\n\r\nbeing  that  the third one mentioned by the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  today  is obsolete, whilst  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and the people of Malaya are struggling  for\r\n\r\ncomplete  independence through  merger.  What  did  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown mean when he moved this  out-of-date  amendment,  that is to say, full  internal  self-government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, I have said that the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nand  his Party are insincere and dishonest. I mean that\r\n\r\nthey  know that their demand for merger, with  all  its\r\n\r\nimplications,   is   unreasonable   and   cannot   find\r\n\r\nacceptance  by  the  Federation  Government.   In   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances, they are aware that the demand  will  be\r\n\r\nrejected.  Therefore, the demand has been  deliberately\r\n\r\nbrought  up.  The  second proposal,  that  is  to  say,\r\n\r\nconfederation,  is  also  a  proposal  which   is   not\r\n\r\nacceptable to the people, so they go back to the  third\r\n\r\nproposal,  that  is, a self-governing status  with  the\r\n\r\nI.S.C. abolished  and  responsibility  for   internal\r\n\r\nmatters  being placed in their own hands. What  is  the\r\n\r\nmeaning of this? If the I.S.C. is abolished and  placed\r\n\r\nin  the hands of the Barisan Sosialis, then there is no\r\n\r\nneed   for   me   to   relate  the   consequences   and\r\n\r\nimplications.  That  is the sincerity  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  by  introducing  this   false   merger\r\n\r\nproposal,   the   P.A.P. leadership   have    exposed\r\n\r\nthemselves. All the people in Singapore know that  they\r\n\r\nhave  sold  their interest. When politicians are  faced\r\n\r\nwith  a  desperate  position, they  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nmaintain their political line by hook or by crook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the introduction of this\r\n\r\nmerger  motion by the P.A.P. was actually  unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn  this Session of the Legislative Assembly, the  most\r\n\r\nimportant  thing  is  to  debate  the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's speech. From the very beginning of the speech,\r\n\r\nthere is mention of merger and it occupies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  one-third  of  the  whole  of  the  speech.  The\r\n\r\ncontents of the motion of the Minister for Labour could\r\n\r\nhave  been  included in the text of the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's  speech. What was the intention or the  motive\r\n\r\nof the Government for not having done so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion of the Prime Minister on the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech seeks to ask the Assembly to\r\n\r\nexpress  its thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  for\r\n\r\nhis  speech. But when the Government came to know  that\r\n\r\nwe  were  going  to expose them with our  amendment  on\r\n\r\nmerger,  they  resorted  to other  means.  We  want  to\r\n\r\nexpress  our regret that the Government is  pursuing  a\r\n\r\nmerger policy which is contrary to the interest of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  the two territories, and we  urge  them  to\r\n\r\nreorientate  its policy in conformity with  the  ardent\r\n\r\ndesire of the people for a genuine reunification.  What\r\n\r\ndid  the  Government do when we tabled  our  amendment?\r\n\r\nThey were at their wit's end. They did not know whether\r\n\r\nto attack us or retreat, knowing that their merger is a\r\n\r\nsell-out  of  the interest of the people. Are  they  to\r\n\r\nagree with our amendment? If they do so, the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  will be offended, as this  is  contrary  to\r\n\r\ntheir policy of selling out the interest of the people.\r\n\r\nWhat  should  the  P.A.P. Government  then  do  on  the\r\n\r\namendment moved by the Barisan Sosialis? So they  think\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  necessary to raise a motion to  kill  two\r\n\r\nbirds  with  one  stone.  On the  one  hand,  they  can\r\n\r\nhoodwink  the people by offering them false  hopes  for\r\n\r\ntheir  happiness  and comfort, and on the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nthey can please the Federation Government. In order  to\r\n\r\nplease the people of Singapore, they are attempting  to\r\n\r\nwhitewash  the terms of their motion so as to  make  it\r\n\r\nappear  very  nice.  They accuse the  British  of  many\r\n\r\nthings so that they may appear to be anti-colonialists.\r\n\r\nIn  order to please the Federation, they have to attack\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis  in  the  course  of  debate  by\r\n\r\nalleging that it is a communal Party. That is why the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  have  raised this  motion,  to  attack  and\r\n\r\nembarrass us. But the dream of the Government has  been\r\n\r\nsmashed  by  us.  On the face of it, the  motion  looks\r\n\r\nnice,  but  between the lines there is  something  else\r\n\r\nwhich is the height of treachery. They want to give the\r\n\r\npeople  some  false impression because  they  have  not\r\n\r\ninserted   the  correct  adjective  before   the   word\r\n\r\n\"merger\". The Government do not indicate whether it  is\r\n\r\na  true  or a phoney merger. Therefore we now  have  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to counter-attack the arrogant  P.A.P.  We\r\n\r\nhave taken them unawares by tabling an amendment to the\r\n\r\nmotion.  By adding the word \"genuine\" before  \"merger\",\r\n\r\nthis is to prevent the P.A.P. from distorting the facts\r\n\r\nand bamboozling the people. The effect of our amendment\r\n\r\nis  that  all  Singapore citizens should  automatically\r\n\r\nbecome  citizens of the Federation on Merger  Day.  But\r\n\r\nthis hurried adroitness has caused the ruling clique of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. to bring up some other form  of  trickery.\r\n\r\nThey have tabled a so-called White Paper on merger. One\r\n\r\ncan well imagine the many trickeries and manoeuvres  of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. No matter how resourceful they can be in the\r\n\r\nplaying  of  words, terms and the introduction  of  new\r\n\r\ntrickeries, the people of Singapore know that basically\r\n\r\nthe  contents of the motion are very treacherous.  They\r\n\r\namount to a sell-out of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today when we are debating the question of merger\r\n\r\nwhich   affects  everyone  in  Singapore  and  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya irrespective of skin and religion,\r\n\r\nwe  see  the self-professed socialist ruling clique  of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. fanning the sparks of communalism and trying\r\n\r\nto  arouse suspicion among the different communities in\r\n\r\norder to sour their relationship with one another. Now,\r\n\r\nthey are fatalist; they are no longer true followers of\r\n\r\nsocialism.  They  have already forgotten  the  promises\r\n\r\nthey  made  in  the  l959 general  elections.  At  the\r\n\r\nsitting of 21st November, the Minister for Finance said\r\n\r\nthat  the period 1954 to 1959 was a phase in the  anti-colonial struggle. How correct this is. It follows that\r\n\r\nin   1959,   when  the  P.A.P. ruling  clique   became\r\n\r\nMinisters,  this  phase  of the anti-colonial  struggle\r\n\r\nshould have come to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> What about you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, you will remember the many policies declared by\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. to all the people of Singapore in 1959.

This\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould be found in the P.A.P.'s \"The Tasks Ahead\".  Now,\r\n\r\nI  want to throw at them their own words. It appears on\r\n\r\npage  8  of the Chinese version, and on page 14 of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish version. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In fact the intervention of the racialist merely\r\n\r\ntends  to  distract attention from the real  causes  of\r\n\r\neconomic  discontent.  For  this  reason  the  communal\r\n\r\npolitician often becomes the tool of reactionary vested\r\n\r\ninterests   who  want  to  divert  the   attention   of\r\n\r\nimpoverished workers and peasants from the real  causes\r\n\r\nof poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Chinese, Malay and Indian workers and farmers can\r\n\r\nbe  led  to believe that economic conflict is based  on\r\n\r\nracial rather than class interests, then, so the forces\r\n\r\nof  reaction  calculate, there will  be  no  danger  of\r\n\r\nChinese,  Malay and Indian workers uniting on  a  class\r\n\r\nbasis  to resist exploitation by Chinese, Indian, Malay\r\n\r\nand  British  capitalists. Thus it is significant  that\r\n\r\nleft-wing and socialist parties in Malaya are organised\r\n\r\non  a  non-racial and non-communal basis. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand  communal parties in Malaya, by and  large, stand\r\n\r\nfor  the economic status quo - that is for a capitalist\r\n\r\nsociety.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will recall that on the 21st\r\n\r\nDecember  the  Minister  for  Finance  said  that  \"the\r\n\r\npurpose and true aim of our merger is to overthrow  the\r\n\r\nRight-wing  reactionary Government of the  Federation.\"\r\n\r\nIt  is truly so. It is well said. We thank the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Culture very much if he could use the words he used\r\n\r\nin 1959 to explain to the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, \"the suspicion between the different\r\n\r\ncommunities  is  due to the discontent and  fears  over\r\n\r\neconomic  situations.\"  Can the  Minister  for  Culture\r\n\r\nrecall this statement - \"Poverty knows no Race\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now continue to talk about the\r\n\r\nstruggle  for the reunification of the two  territories\r\n\r\nand  the  problem of nation-building.

The Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture then continued to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the people of Singapore want merger, the people of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation,  in particular the Malays,  have  been\r\n\r\nfrightened  into  believing that merger  means  Chinese\r\n\r\ndomination.  We  in  Singapore should  by  our  actions\r\n\r\nremove  such fears. When we do that and when people  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  realise that race  and  religion  have\r\n\r\nnothing  to  do  with politics or economics,  then  the\r\n\r\nmerger   of   Singapore  and  the  Federation   becomes\r\n\r\ninevitable.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, this was said in 1959. But today, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership  have  forgotten  it  entirely.  You\r\n\r\ncannot  use it to fool the people because this was  our\r\n\r\npromise to the people in 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we use the above quotations to\r\n\r\nadvise those who play with communalism. In other words,\r\n\r\nonly  when  we  and  the people of the  Federation  can\r\n\r\nunderstand  that religion and race have nothing  to  do\r\n\r\nwith   politics  will  the  time  come  when  the   two\r\n\r\nterritories  can be merged. There is another  quotation\r\n\r\nby him:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For the reactionaries the end of communal politics\r\n\r\nwill  pose new dangers. It will not longer be  possible\r\n\r\nfor   them  to  divert  people's  attention  from   the\r\n\r\npolitical  and  economic causes  of  social  unrest  by\r\n\r\nplaying up racial issue.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  is  it  not very clear  from  all  these\r\n\r\nquotations  that today the leaders of the  P.A.P. have\r\n\r\nforgotten all these entirely? The most important  thing\r\n\r\nis  that they have not only forgotten this but they are\r\n\r\nnow turn-coats. They are no longer socialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Chairman of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  the  Member  for Queenstown,  has  raised  a\r\n\r\nseries of questions. I think it is not necessary for me\r\n\r\nto  remind the P.A.P. leadership of this.

He said the real purpose was  to\r\n\r\nask  for  full internal self-government, which includes\r\n\r\ncontrol  over internal security. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nTunku in the Federal Parliament last month very frankly\r\n\r\ntold  us  that he did not want a true merger.  What  he\r\n\r\nwanted   was   that   Singapore  should   have   closer\r\n\r\nassociation  with  the  Federation  on  the  basis   of\r\n\r\npartnership. Therefore, we the Barisan Sosialis on  the\r\n\r\n3rd of November issued a statement. The last passage of\r\n\r\nthe  statement clearly tells the people the path of the\r\n\r\npresent constitutional struggle. Let me quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We want to stress once more that merger is our main\r\n\r\nobjective.

When the people want to be united to  resolve\r\n\r\nour  many problems, we cannot forget the fact that  the\r\n\r\nexistence  of  the colonial power is  the  main  factor\r\n\r\nwhich   contributes  to  the  separation  of  the   two\r\n\r\nterritories and the separation of the people of the two\r\n\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

But today when\r\n\r\nthey have become Ministers, they have forgotten their\r\n\r\npromises made to the people in the general elections in\r\n\r\n1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been debating the question\r\n\r\nof  merger  for  many days. The ruling  clique  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. today  are  still insisting on  saying  that  a\r\n\r\npartnership  relationship is merger. Now,  whether  the\r\n\r\nruling clique of the P.A.P. are sincere or not has been\r\n\r\nexposed  today.  The Tunku has on many  occasions  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  negotiations between the two Prime Ministers\r\n\r\nof   the   two  territories  are  only  on   a   closer\r\n\r\nrelationship and not on merger. It is not  merger.  All\r\n\r\npolitical Parties in Singapore, irrespective of whether\r\n\r\nthey  are  Left-wing or Right-wing Parties,  have  said\r\n\r\nthat  these arrangements are not of a true merger. Only\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. have said that it is a merger. I wonder very\r\n\r\nmuch why the P.A.P. leadership nowadays do not honestly\r\n\r\nand  frankly want to confess this. I cannot  understand\r\n\r\nthe  ruling clique of the P.A.P. Do they want to  throw\r\n\r\nthe  reputation  of the P.A.P. into the night-soil  pit\r\n\r\nand  let it stay there and stink forever? Though we  do\r\n\r\nnot  agree with the Tunku's views, we at least find him\r\n\r\nhonest and frank. He has honestly disclosed that he  is\r\n\r\nanti-Communist  and does not want merger.  The  present\r\n\r\narrangements  are only to prevent the  Communists  from\r\n\r\ncontrolling Singapore. Why does our Prime Minister  not\r\n\r\nwant  to learn from the Tunku? If he does so, at  least\r\n\r\nhe  will  not  be  accused  by  the  people  of  being\r\n\r\ndishonest and his name will not stink in future years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said, the phoney merger\r\n\r\nproposed  by the ruling clique of the P.A.P. has  been\r\n\r\nthoroughly  exposed today. All the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nknow that this is a kind of sell-out merger. The ruling\r\n\r\nclique  of the P.A.P. have been playing about with  the\r\n\r\nword   \"citizenship\".  They  are  fishing  in  troubled\r\n\r\nwaters. They want to hoodwink the people if they can. I\r\n\r\nwant  to  avail myself of this opportunity to  admonish\r\n\r\nthem.  The people of Singapore have experienced many  a\r\n\r\npolitical   struggle.  They  have   now   become   more\r\n\r\nintelligent  and they are not so gullible. They  cannot\r\n\r\nbe deceived so easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the P.A.P. leadership will give up their\r\n\r\nattempt and walk on concrete ground. They should  think\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  the daily lives of the people  and  they\r\n\r\nshould   rack  their  brains  to  improve  the   future\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of  the  people. I  hope  they  will  check\r\n\r\nthemselves. There is still time for them to turn  back.\r\n\r\nThey  are  now faced with a situation where  all  their\r\n\r\nfriends  have rebelled against them and their relatives\r\n\r\nhave  deserted them. They are now with their  backs  to\r\n\r\nthe wall. They are now at the end of their tether. They\r\n\r\nare  now  trying to attack us erratically  to  maintain\r\n\r\ntheir  political power and position. This is  wrong.  I\r\n\r\nhope  they will turn back.

They are\r\n\r\nlike  brothers  and  they cannot be separated.  In  the\r\n\r\npast, the colonial rulers separated the two territories\r\n\r\nto  rule  over  them.  But why should  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown oppose merger now? I think he opposes merger\r\n\r\nnow  because  he has had a cup of tea with  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom Commissioner in Singapore. He is willing to  be\r\n\r\nmade  use  of  by the British.

Of course, since the Barisan Sosialis are  now\r\n\r\nseparated from us, they want to attack and ridicule us.\r\n\r\nThey  met with defeat. As they were only 13 in  number,\r\n\r\nthey  wanted to pull us over to their side. But we  are\r\n\r\n26  in  number and they are now only a minority. It  is\r\n\r\nvery  pitiful.  They  could not achieve  their  purpose\r\n\r\nwhich  was  to make one of them the Prime Minister.  If\r\n\r\nthey  could have mustered 26 Members, then perhaps they\r\n\r\ncould  have  formed the Government with the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown as the Prime Minister.

As  a\r\n\r\nMalay, and as an U.M.N.O. member, let me say,  be\r\n\r\nit to the P.A.P. which is in power today or to the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis which has moved the amendment  to\r\n\r\nthe motion, this is a moment, in my opinion, which\r\n\r\nis  crucial  to our mutual interest. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, from what has been interpreted into Malay  of\r\n\r\nthe  exchange of correspondence between the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinisters  of Singapore and the Federation,  there\r\n\r\nis   one  phrase  used - to  effect  the  merger  of\r\n\r\nSingapore with the Federation of Malaya in the new\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaysia. From this,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   all  accusations  made  of  my  colleagues,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  Member for Geylang  Serai,  for\r\n\r\nhaving  adopted  a  communalistic  attitude,   are\r\n\r\ncompletely improper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To return to the issue, Mr Speaker. The Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   have  been  wavering  right  from   the\r\n\r\nbeginning.  Although the Member  for  Thomson  has\r\n\r\nstated the views of his Party, the challenge  made\r\n\r\nby  the Publicity Officer of U.M.N.O., Malaya, has\r\n\r\nnot  yet been taken up outside this Assembly. They\r\n\r\nshould  take  it  up  so that the  people  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  and  Singapore  may  know   what   the\r\n\r\nBarisan's stand is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I very much regret to hear the Member for Changi saying in this Assembly something to the effect that there are people in\r\n\r\nSingapore  who will oppose any attempts by  people\r\n\r\nto  sell  the island of Singapore. May I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMember for Changi this, and if he has no chance of\r\n\r\nreplying as he has already spoken, he could convey\r\n\r\nhis  reply  to  his colleagues who  have  not  yet\r\n\r\nspoken,  or he could reply outside this  Assembly:\r\n\r\nwho  has the right to sell Singapore, and who  has\r\n\r\nthe right to demand Singapore? I am fortunate that\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister has just entered to listen  to\r\n\r\nwhat  I  have to say. I will not accept  in  their\r\n\r\nentirety  the arguments put forward by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson, whether they be true or not. I  want\r\n\r\nto  know once and for all whether it is true  that\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku was referred to as ayah. I am surprised\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister of Singapore should, at a time\r\n\r\nwhen  the Tunku was away in London, have expressed\r\n\r\nopenly - and  this  was witnessed  by  thousands  of\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore - that the Tunku is,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  father of independent Malaysia. If  that  was\r\n\r\nthe opinion of the Prime Minister of Singapore,  I\r\n\r\nam quite sure he will categorically deny that such\r\n\r\nan allegation is untrue. But if the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nof  Singapore could declare openly that the  Tunku\r\n\r\nis  the  father of independent Malaysia, then  we,\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O., will support to the hilt the opinion  of\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I will not be the stepson of Mao Tse-tung or Khrushchev, because I will oppose the amendment and support the father of independent\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  i.e. Tunku Abdul Rahman  Putra  Al-Haj.\r\n\r\nPeople  have said that Singapore has been sold  to\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya. If it is true, then the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime  is  opportune that the Tunku must take Singapore,\r\n\r\njust as Raffles conquered Singapore with pen and paper.\r\n\r\nSo  the  moment is ripe for the Tunku to take Singapore\r\n\r\ninto  the Federation. This has been made clear  by  the\r\n\r\nTunku.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.N.M.O. particularly did not at one time wish for\r\n\r\nmerger,  but now the Tunku wants merger. What  are  the\r\n\r\nreasons,  Mr Speaker? The reasons are as  reported  in\r\n\r\nthe  newspaper, Berita Harian of 20th October, that  if\r\n\r\nSingapore  gets independence, then there is the  danger\r\n\r\nof   undesirable   elements   infiltrating   into   the\r\n\r\nFederation. There is no need for me to go into details.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the reason why Singapore wants to be in  much\r\n\r\ncloser relationship with the Federation of Malaya. I do\r\n\r\nnot  wish to involve my friend, the Member for  Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai,  by  mentioning the long \"parang\" or unsheathing\r\n\r\nthe  traditional Malay weapon, the kris or  dagger,  if\r\n\r\nthe  Communists dare to rule Singapore. I have  already\r\n\r\nexplained  at  U.M.N.O. meetings that  a  conflagration\r\n\r\nwill  ensue  if Singapore is given full internal  self-government. If Singapore rejects the Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil,  it means, Mr Speaker, that communal  tension\r\n\r\nwill  be intensified in Singapore. Therefore, we oppose\r\n\r\nthe  abolition of the Internal Security Council. We had\r\n\r\nalready  opposed that line before the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nwas registered in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another question the answer to which I wish\r\n\r\nto  know.  When the Alliance and U.M.N.O., particularly\r\n\r\nin Malaya, struggled for independence, whether with the\r\n\r\ninclusion  of  Singapore  or  otherwise   - I  am  not\r\n\r\nsupporting  the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  but  I  agree with his  view  that  we  were\r\n\r\nfighting  colonialism  with the  seed  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  at  that  time.  I  seek  clarification.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I hope this clarification will be forthcoming\r\n\r\nfrom  Members of the Barisan Sosialis who have not  yet\r\n\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to come back to another matter which\r\n\r\nhas  been  the  subject of an allegation,  particularly\r\n\r\nagainst the Malays. The Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThomson  said  that  U.M.N.O., as  represented  by  the Member  for Geylang Serai, in his capacity as a member, is  a  communal organisation. If U.M.N.O. is  really  a communal  political organisation, what communal  demand has  U.M.N.O. put to the P.A.P. Government?  What  has been  given  to  us? I hope the Barisan  Sosialis  will\r\n\r\nreply  to this. What had the Member for Geylang  Serai,\r\n\r\nas an U.M.N.O. representative when he was a Minister in\r\n\r\nthe Labour Front Coalition Government, done to give the\r\n\r\nimpression that he was communal in outlook? I hope  the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson will clarify this.\r\n\r\nOr  is it his intention to spread communal feelings  in\r\n\r\nSingapore? We are against communalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is an important matter because many among us who have accepted Malay as the national language merely pay lip service to it. I observe that\r\n\r\nit  was  reported in the news-paper using the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage, the Berita Minggu dated 5th November,  1961,\r\n\r\nthat  at  the Delegates Conference of U.M.N.O., Malaya,\r\n\r\nall  U.M.N.O. members discussed the question of  Merger\r\n\r\nheatedly.  They were opposed to' the idea of  Singapore\r\n\r\nbeing  merged with the Federation. As explained by  the\r\n\r\nTunku and Tun Razak, the Mentri Besar of Malacca, Inche\r\n\r\nGhaffar  Baba, opposed the view of the Tunku  and  Tun\r\n\r\nRazak  at  the conference. Why is it that, on our  part\r\n\r\ntoday,  we  view  with suspicion the  struggle  of  the\r\n\r\nMalays for independence? If we are still suspicious  of\r\n\r\nthe  Malays  and  accuse U.M.N.O. of being  a  communal\r\n\r\norganisation,   the  P.M.I.P. is   also   a   communal\r\n\r\norganisation. May I say to the Member for Thomson  that\r\n\r\nInche  Ahmad Boestamam is a Malay, and that he  was  at\r\n\r\none  time the  leader  of  the youth  organisation  who\r\n\r\nfought  against British colonialism years back.  So  do\r\n\r\nnot  pay  tribute to one side when we do not know  what\r\n\r\nthe other side is doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these are the dangers which will\r\n\r\nbefall us in our struggle in Singapore if we still feel\r\n\r\nthat  U.M.N.O. is a communal organisation. I would like\r\n\r\nto state here, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I do not agree at\r\n\r\nall with the view that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere should be local autonomy in education and labour.\r\n\r\nBut  viewing  it  from the larger  and  more  important\r\n\r\naspect,  the P.A.P., by these means, is trying  to  get\r\n\r\nbenefits for the Chinese people. We can, if we want to,\r\n\r\noppose  that  stand,  because  that  will  be  to   the\r\n\r\ndetriment  of  the  Malays. But  we  have  to  come  to\r\n\r\nagreement  from  time to time. I doubt if  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  will  agree to accept 100 per  cent  what  is\r\n\r\nenshrined  in  the  Constitution of the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  regarding the Federation policies on  education\r\n\r\nand  so  on. This is merely a political stunt on  their\r\n\r\npart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson has also\r\n\r\nstated that the leaders of U.M.N.O., particularly those\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation,  come to Singapore  for  political\r\n\r\nreasons and to give political lectures here. This is  a\r\n\r\nsmall   matter,  Sir.  Why  did  the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nmembers,  when  they were still in  the  ranks  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  fail  to order the Registrar of  Societies  to\r\n\r\nrefuse  registration  of  our  Constitution?  If   they\r\n\r\naccepted   our  Constitution,  why  then   cannot   the\r\n\r\nFederation  U.M.N.O. members come down to Singapore  to\r\n\r\ngive  political  talks to U.M.N.O. members  here?  But\r\n\r\nafter  they have come out of the P.A.P., they  now  say\r\n\r\nthat  U.M.N.O. members from the Federation cannot  give\r\n\r\npolitical lectures here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> On a point of order. I did\r\n\r\nnot  object to Alliance leaders coming to Singapore and\r\n\r\ndelivering  speeches.

Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): So, Mr Speaker, on he\r\n\r\nother hand, why cannot political experts from Singapore\r\n\r\nbe  allowed to go to the Federation? My answer is  that\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore, including myself,  are  still\r\n\r\nunder the wings of the British. That is the reason  why\r\n\r\nwe should not try to teach the people in the Federation\r\n\r\non political matters. They are already independent. But\r\n\r\nthere will be open chances and when the time comes,  we\r\n\r\nwill  be able to breathe freely. We will then be facing\r\n\r\none another in our struggle on a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndemocratic basis. I shall await the day when  Singapore\r\n\r\nand the Federation will be brought closer together, and\r\n\r\nwe  will have 15 representatives from Singapore in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Parliament. I hope there  will  be  Members\r\n\r\nfrom  the Barisan Sosialis and from the P.A.P. who will\r\n\r\nbe  successful and who will sit together in the Federal\r\n\r\nParliament  in Kuala Lumpur. I believe if the  Alliance\r\n\r\nand U.M.N.O. are successful in winning a few seats,  we\r\n\r\ntoo  will sit there, and that will be the time when  we\r\n\r\nwill  show whether we are communal or otherwise in  our\r\n\r\nefforts to oppose the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Choa Chu Kang in his\r\n\r\nspeech,  which was of considerable length, stated  that\r\n\r\nperhaps there are some of them who will be arrested  by\r\n\r\nthe  Right-wing people. I am surprised. Why do we  wish\r\n\r\nto  arrest the Left-wingers? Are they such devils?  Can\r\n\r\nyou tell me that, Mr Speaker, Sir? So, if they are  no\r\n\r\ndevils but ordinary human beings, the Right-wing people\r\n\r\nwill  oppose  them with words which come out  of  their\r\n\r\nmouths.  If  they  force us to arrest  them,  then  Dr\r\n\r\nIsmail,  in his capacity as U.M.N.O. representative  in\r\n\r\nthe  general  meeting, has already clearly  stated  his\r\n\r\nstand.  I  do not wish to express here what  he,  as  a\r\n\r\nresponsible  Minister, has said he would  do  to  those\r\n\r\npeople  whom we can persuade by peaceful means  not  to\r\n\r\nbring up communalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before the Tunku proclaimed the independence of the Federation of Malaya, he made an opening speech at the Second General Assembly of\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. on 2nd June, 1957, in\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.   House,  Batu  Road, Kuala  Lumpur.  At  that\r\n\r\nmoment,  a clash had taken place in Penang.  I  feel  I\r\n\r\nshould   tell  this  House  what  the  Tunku  told   us\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of U.M.N.O. who were all Malay members.\r\n\r\nThis  is  what  the Tunku said, \"We all know  that  the\r\n\r\npublic  in  this  country  are  at  the  moment  making\r\n\r\npreparations  for  celebrating  the  31st   of   August\r\n\r\nbecomingly.

Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I will\r\n\r\ncontinue.  The Tunku said, \"The people of this  country\r\n\r\nwant  to celebrate Merdeka. They do not want to have  a\r\n\r\nblood-bath  as  is  intended by  the  enemies  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry. I still remember what took place in Penang  in\r\n\r\nJanuary  this  year.  The cause of  the  clash  was  an\r\n\r\ninstigation   as   I   have  stated   earlier.   During\r\n\r\ndemonstrations there were arguments and  all  sorts  of\r\n\r\naccusations  were  hurled back and forth.  The  Chinese\r\n\r\naccused  the Malays of wanting to do certain things  to\r\n\r\nthe   Chinese.  As  a  result,  innocent  people   were\r\n\r\ninvolved.\" The Tunku further stated that what had taken\r\n\r\nplace in Penang could well happen again. 'Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nask  members of U.M.N.O. and of the Alliance from  this\r\n\r\nmoment  onwards  to  work  hard  to  organise  goodwill\r\n\r\ncommittees  in  the various villages,  irrespective  of\r\n\r\npolitical Parties, so that all the people who  live  in\r\n\r\nthis  country  could work hard to bring about  goodwill\r\n\r\namong  all  communities  who  live  together  in   this\r\n\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, it is clear from that speech made in\r\n\r\nthe General Assembly of U.M.N.O., which was attended by\r\n\r\n100  per cent Malay members, that we were asked to keep\r\n\r\ncommunal  feelings away. But in Singapore,  the  people\r\n\r\nstill  have  their  suspicions  and  doubts  about  the\r\n\r\nintentions   of  U.M.N.O.,  both  here   and   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation. Mr Speaker, Sir, by the grace of  God,  it\r\n\r\nis  fortunate that the Tunku has now become the  leader\r\n\r\nto  replace Dato Onn.

We do not belong to such tribes and we are  not\r\n\r\na  community that is fond of clashes. But we would like\r\n\r\nto  tell  the  hon. Member for Anson that he  seems  to\r\n\r\ndoubt  the  existence of Communist elements.  He  would\r\n\r\nlike   to  know  how  many  Communists  there  are   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. The Government was keen to assist  him  with\r\n\r\ninformation although it was of a secret nature. I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Home Affairs could give clarification.\r\n\r\nIf  there  are Communists and there are elements  which\r\n\r\nare  pro-Communist in Singapore, these  Communists  and\r\n\r\npseudo-Communists have not only have grand-children and\r\n\r\ngreat-grand-children in this country.

Sir, were these  people\r\n\r\nnot returned by the voters because they stood as P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncandidates on the P.A.P. platform? Now that  they  have\r\n\r\nso treacherously defected, can they still say that they\r\n\r\nhave a mandate from the people? Should it not be proper\r\n\r\nthat  they  resign their seats to seek a fresh  mandate\r\n\r\nfrom the people instead of arrogating to themselves the\r\n\r\nrole of the champions of the people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis accuse the Government of selling\r\n\r\nout  the  people  of Singapore. They do  not,  however,\r\n\r\nindicate  how  this sell-out comes about.  They  cannot\r\n\r\ndeny  that  the  Government Party  has  tried,  in  the\r\n\r\nnegotiations  with the Federation, to secure  a  merger\r\n\r\nwhich  provides every safeguard for our citizens.  They\r\n\r\ncannot  be  unaware of the promise that with merger  no\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen  will  be  worse  off.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  fear merger and they do not want it  to  come\r\n\r\nabout.   But,  Sir,  they  dare  not  go  against   the\r\n\r\naspirations of the people. They know that the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore want merger. They therefore try their best to\r\n\r\nconfuse  the issue by insisting on what they call  full\r\n\r\nmerger.  They have changed their stand more  than  once\r\n\r\nduring  the  last few months. At the Anson by-election,\r\n\r\ntheir  call  was for full internal self-government  and\r\n\r\nthe  abolition  of the Internal Security Council.  This\r\n\r\ndemand  is a sell-out because these champions of  anti-colonialism would rather live in a colony under British\r\n\r\nrule  than to be free. Later, they supported the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nrequest  for merger, retaining autonomy in  matters  of\r\n\r\neducation   and  labour.  They  calculated   that   the\r\n\r\nFederation   of  Malaya  was  not  likely   to   accept\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Unfortunately for them, their  surmise  was\r\n\r\nwrong   and  the  Government  was  successful  in   its\r\n\r\nnegotiations  for merger on a special  basis.  Now  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis want full merger. Surely they  under-rate  the intelligence of the people if they think that\r\n\r\nthe  people  do not realise what practical  issues  are\r\n\r\ninvolved. They forget that besides education and labour\r\n\r\npolicies  as  well  as our peculiar  entrepot  economy,\r\n\r\nthere are other fields such as social welfare services,\r\n\r\nhousing,  industrial development and the  provision  of\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities for a fast growing population,\r\n\r\nand  so on, the problems relating to which are peculiar\r\n\r\nto  Singapore and would best be dealt with on  a  State\r\n\r\nrather than on a Federal basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen belaboured the point\r\n\r\nthat  with merger the 624,000 Singapore citizens  would\r\n\r\nnot  be able to vote in the Federation, and, this being\r\n\r\nso, they would become\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecond-class  citizens.  They  do  not  look   at   the\r\n\r\npractical  side  of the problem and consider  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  only a limited number of people in Singapore  are\r\n\r\nlikely to want to vote outside Singapore and that  more\r\n\r\npeople come to Singapore from the Federation than those\r\n\r\ngoing  away from Singapore. The only adverse effect  is\r\n\r\nthat  politicians discredited in Singapore cannot  look\r\n\r\nfor  new constituencies in the Federation. Surely, they\r\n\r\nare  making  a  mountain out of a molehill  about  this\r\n\r\ncitizenship issue. For the Member for Queenstown to wax\r\n\r\neloquent  on the issue of citizenship when only  a  few\r\n\r\nweeks ago he betrayed his ignorance of the subject at a\r\n\r\nradio  forum is surely straining our credulity. It  can\r\n\r\nonly  show that he is little more than a mouthpiece - His\r\n\r\nMaster's Voice in Hi-Fi. Unfortunately, it is true that\r\n\r\npuppets  seldom realise that they are being played  for\r\n\r\nsuckers.  Sir, history abounds with thousands of  cases\r\n\r\nwhere stooges and puppets and collaborators have on the\r\n\r\nsuccess  of  their  master's schemes  been  eliminated,\r\n\r\nliquidated or laid to rest in unknown graves once their\r\n\r\nusefulness  has  run out. These aspiring  to  be  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  or Deputy Prime Minister and other  Ministers\r\n\r\nwho  are prepared to be manipulated will find that when\r\n\r\ntheir usefulness comes to an end, they are the ones who\r\n\r\nwill be relegated to oblivion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is possible to take the\r\n\r\nextreme  view  and  say that unless  we  are  in  every\r\n\r\nrespect treated exactly the same as all the constituent\r\n\r\nparts  of the parent body, we have not been merged.  It\r\n\r\nis also possible to say that as long as we have a voice\r\n\r\nin  policy making by the parent body, we have become  a\r\n\r\nconstituent  part  and have therefore  merged.  Between\r\n\r\nthese two extremes, any association or relationship  is\r\n\r\nmerger.  It  must, therefore, be' contended  that  when\r\n\r\nSingapore  has 15 representatives in a House  of  about 100 Members who decide common policy, Singapore is part\r\n\r\nof the Federation and there is true merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate in the last few days has brought up the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  having  failed  to\r\n\r\noverthrow the Government in their abortive plot after\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Anson  by-election and having  made  a  series  of\r\n\r\nblunders  in  miscalculating the speed  of  the  merger\r\n\r\nnegotiations,  are  now  in an untenable  position - that\r\n\r\nthey  do  not want merger and yet dare not say  so.  We\r\n\r\ncannot  believe that the Barisan Sosialis do  not  know\r\n\r\nthat  they  have made a blunder. What we know  is  that\r\n\r\nthey  have not the political honesty to admit it.  They\r\n\r\nprefer to render lip service to the request for merger,\r\n\r\nbut  to make their demands such that no merger will  be\r\n\r\npossible. These are worn-out tactics by now,  and  they\r\n\r\ndo ring hollow in our ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen do not or will not\r\n\r\nface  the fact but keep on repeating such catch-phrases\r\n\r\nas   \"full   merger  or  no  merger\",   or   \"automatic\r\n\r\ncitizenship\",  \"second-class  citizens\",  and  so   on,\r\n\r\nwithout realising their true meanings and implications.\r\n\r\nSo   much  more  is  it  a  pity,  because  even  other\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members credit them with some intelligence.\r\n\r\nThey  accuse the Government of perpetrating a  sell-out\r\n\r\nwhen all along the Government has tried to work honesty\r\n\r\nfor  the benefit of the majority of the people. It  may\r\n\r\nbe  true that certain people, who are political  risks,\r\n\r\nmay  find that with merger the liberties which they now\r\n\r\nenjoy  under the benevolent P.A.P. Government  will  be\r\n\r\ndrastically  curtailed, but surely the  aspirations  of\r\n\r\nthe people should not be held up because of these few.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I oppose the amendment to the motion because it\r\n\r\nis   unrealistic  at  this  stage  to  demand  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  the type of merger proposed by the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. It is also unrealistic in view of Singapore's\r\n\r\nspecial position which I mentioned earlier, and of  the\r\n\r\neducation  and labour policies as well as our  peculiar\r\n\r\nenterpot  economy, our social services and our attempts\r\n\r\nat  industrial  development for the provision  of  more\r\n\r\njobs  for  our people. I must emphasise that  with  the\r\n\r\nmerger  as  proposed  by the P.A.P.  Government,  every\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens will continue  to  enjoy  the  same\r\n\r\nrights  and privileges that he now enjoys. In addition,\r\n\r\nhe  will be able to stand for election in Singapore  to\r\n\r\nbe  a Member of the Federal Parliament. Every Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen will be able to exercise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis  vote,  to  determine  as  to  who  should  be  his\r\n\r\nrepresentative  in  the Federal  Parliament.  With  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. merger.  Federation policies on  education  and\r\n\r\nlabour  will not affect us. We will continue to  strive\r\n\r\nfor  industrial peace-with justice and to create a more\r\n\r\njust  and  equal society. The policy of equal treatment\r\n\r\nfor  the four language streams of education will  carry\r\n\r\non.  There  will  still  be all the  opportunities  for\r\n\r\nparents to send their children to Chinese, Tamil, Malay\r\n\r\nor  English schools of their choice. Chinese  education\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  flourish with  the  continuance  of\r\n\r\nChinese  as the medium of instruction in our  secondary\r\n\r\nand  higher  educational, institutions. Those  who  are\r\n\r\neducated  in  Malay, Chinese or Tamil  would  be  given\r\n\r\nopportunities  for employment in the  public  services,\r\n\r\nand  our  public services will not be affected  by  the\r\n\r\nFederation 4:1 ratio policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, we the Barisan Sosialis have  proposed\r\n\r\nthis  amendment  through the Member for Queenstown.  In\r\n\r\nthe  debate these few days we have clearly proved  that\r\n\r\nour  amendment is justified. This is particularly  true\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Ministers and P.A.P. Assemblymen  could  not\r\n\r\nanswer  the  questions raised by us. It  clearly  shows\r\n\r\nthat  the  merger  proposed by the leadership  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is a kind of phoney merger, and our amendment is\r\n\r\nproof  of it. The discredited leadership of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nshould  rise  up  to face the people  and  seek  a  new\r\n\r\nmandate from them, so that the people could make a  new\r\n\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard the Minister for National Development\r\n\r\nsay   just   now  that  we,  the  13  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nAssemblymen,  contested the 1959 general  elections  in\r\n\r\nthe name of the P.A.P. That is quite true. But in those\r\n\r\ndays  we  were of the opinion that the P.A.P.  principles\r\n\r\nmet  with  the wishes of the people, and therefore  the\r\n\r\npeople  elected  the P.A.P. to form the government.  My\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Member for Havelock, has replied on this\r\n\r\npoint,  and  you  cannot say that  we  now  oppose  the\r\n\r\nprinciples of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P. But the leadership of the P.A.P. have forgotten\r\n\r\ntheir  own promises made in 1959. We have been  trying\r\n\r\nto  seek the true principles but the ruling clique  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. do not want to discuss all these questions\r\n\r\nin  a  democratic way. Instead they have  resorted  to\r\n\r\ndictatorial ways, and that is why today 13 of  us  are\r\n\r\nsitting here under the style of \"Barisan Sosialis\". We\r\n\r\nhave  not betrayed any election promises made in 1959.\r\n\r\nWe  the  Barisan Sosialis are ready to face the people\r\n\r\nat  any time any place, if the P.A.P. Assemblymen  are\r\n\r\nas  honest and courageous as we are, then they  should\r\n\r\nbe prepared to face the people at any time in order to\r\n\r\nlet the people make a new decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of merger is a national issue. It can\r\n\r\nalso  be said to have a very important bearing on  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore as well as  the  people  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya. It cannot  be  made  an  issue\r\n\r\npertaining  to the P.A.P. alone. It is not a  partisan\r\n\r\nissue peculiar to any Party or group of persons. It is\r\n\r\nnot an issue which can be resolved by only a group  of\r\n\r\npeople  or a political Party alone. Our view is  this.\r\n\r\nMerger  between the two territories of  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of Malaya should be  decided  by  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  both  territories, and it  should  not  be\r\n\r\ncarried out in the manner that the Prime Minister  has\r\n\r\ndone - by  secretly going to the Federation to negotiate\r\n\r\nand   to  try  to  get  his  type  of  merger  without\r\n\r\nconsulting the people of Singapore, and then come back\r\n\r\nto  tell  the people that merger is now in  view.  The\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore, especially the political Parties\r\n\r\nand  all trade unionists, have given many constructive\r\n\r\nviews  on  this  question.  Our  Prime  Minister   has\r\n\r\nentirely  ignored all these views and  opinions.  From\r\n\r\nthis,  we  can come to the conclusion that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister is dictatorial and is not democratic  in  his\r\n\r\nway of dealing with the problem of merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for merger between the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya  and  Singapore is that in  the  past  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories were under the rule of colonialists.  They\r\n\r\nruled over these two territories with a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndivide  and rule policy, as a result of which the  two\r\n\r\nterritories are divided. That is why today  we  demand\r\n\r\nthe  reunification of the two territories and  seek  a\r\n\r\nreunification of the people of these two  territories.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in  this respect this demand  should  meet\r\n\r\nwith   the   wishes  of  the  people  in   these   two\r\n\r\nterritories. The true way to achieve merger should  be\r\n\r\non an equal, just and reasonable basis. It should meet\r\n\r\nwith  the  true  wishes  and  interests  of  the   two\r\n\r\nterritories and with the true wishes of the people  of\r\n\r\nthe  two  territories. But our Prime Minister has  not\r\n\r\ndone so. Whenever he managed to have some kind of deal\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation Government, he would  return  to\r\n\r\nSingapore and make use of the radio and the newspapers\r\n\r\nto talk about his phoney merger. This undemocratic way\r\n\r\nof  handling  this matter cannot be  allowed  by, the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Prime Minister put forward this phoney\r\n\r\nmerger  proposal, the people of Singapore have clearly\r\n\r\nseen  through what this merger means. The eyes of  the\r\n\r\npeople are bright and discerning. The people have come\r\n\r\nto know clearly the kind of merger that is proposed by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister.  In order to  resuscitate  their\r\n\r\nmoribund   and   declining  political   fortunes   and\r\n\r\nposition, our sophisticated Prime Minister and several\r\n\r\nof his colleagues have continued to issue all kinds of\r\n\r\nsaying  and pretexts. But from these declarations  and\r\n\r\nspeeches,  the  people can still  see  that  they  are\r\n\r\ncontradicting themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has said in this Assembly during the present series of sittings that the Member for Queens-town has raised this point, namely, that under Article 22 of the Federation Constitution, the constitutional points with regard to the future status and political rights of the people can be determined. The Minister for Finance says that this is wrong. He also says that the Prime Minister of the Federation\r\n\r\ndoes  not  like  to accept the citizens  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nbecause there are Communists in Singapore. This is the\r\n\r\nreason  given by the Prime Minister of the  Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya.  We regret the way he talked  and  argued.\r\n\r\nAccording to information\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven by Intelligence to the Prime Minister, there  are\r\n\r\nonly  about 300 Communists in Singapore. But under  the\r\n\r\npresent  arrangements for merger, there will  be  about\r\n\r\n320,000  citizens of Singapore who will  not  have  any\r\n\r\nright  to  apply for Federal citizenship. This argument\r\n\r\ndoes not hold water. It is groundless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also heard from the Minister for Health and\r\n\r\nLaw  during  this  present series of sittings  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  He  quoted from documents and law  books  to\r\n\r\nshow that, according to the present Federation law, the\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  Singapore  cannot  automatically   become\r\n\r\ncitizens of the Federation of Malaya on Merger Day.  Is\r\n\r\nthis not in conflict with what the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nhas stated?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nsaid  in this House that we were not sincere in  asking\r\n\r\nfor  automatic conversion of citizens of  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens  on Merger Day.  He  said  that  this\r\n\r\nrequest  would  not  be acceptable  to  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.  At  the same time, he  criticised  us  for\r\n\r\nbringing  up  this  amendment.  He  further  said  that\r\n\r\nbecause  of this we the Barisan Sosialis are a communal\r\n\r\nParty.  He even accused us of being birds of  the  same\r\n\r\nfeather  with  the  Pan-Malayan Islamic  Party  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  What  is his motive  for  making  such  an\r\n\r\naccusation against us?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Havelock has refuted him in a\r\n\r\nvery concrete way. The object of the Minister is merely\r\n\r\nto  confuse the true nature of our amendment.  He  only\r\n\r\nwants to continue to bamboozle the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, he hopes that the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  not  continue  to  seek  their  basic  democratic\r\n\r\nrights. We the Barisan Sosialis have proposed a genuine\r\n\r\nmerger  of  the two territories. This is based  on  the\r\n\r\nequality   of  rights  of  the  people   of   the   two\r\n\r\nterritories. It is to achieve a united nation  so  that\r\n\r\nthe people can share a common political life. When this\r\n\r\nkind  of  merger is achieved, they can enjoy  the  same\r\n\r\nequal rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the Minister for Culture want to level\r\n\r\ncriticisms against us? His argument cannot be  accepted\r\n\r\nby  anyone. His accusation only reflects the fact  that\r\n\r\nhe  himself  is communalistic. Mr Deputy  Speaker,  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  tell the Minister for Culture that since  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis' inception up till  now, our  stand,\r\n\r\nviews  and  policies have all along be clear-cut.  Just\r\n\r\nnow  my colleague has read out our stand. So it is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  me  to  reiterate  it.  We   are   true\r\n\r\nsocialists. We are working along the true path  towards\r\n\r\nthe  building of a socialist country. We are  not  like\r\n\r\nthe leadership of the P.A.P. In name, they claim to  be\r\n\r\nLeft-wing   socialists, but,   in   fact,   they   are\r\n\r\ncompromising with opportunistic Right-wing elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of merger between the two territories,\r\n\r\nwe  have  noted clearly that this is actually a  phoney\r\n\r\nmerger  proposed by the P.A.P. But our  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\ninsists on telling the people that it is a true merger.\r\n\r\nOur  very clever Prime Minister is trying to sell dog's\r\n\r\nmeat  by showing a lamb's head when he tells the people\r\n\r\nthat  this  is a true merger. But I want  to  tell  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister that the people of Singapore have bright\r\n\r\ndiscerning  eyes.  The people have  gone  through  many\r\n\r\nactual experiences. Therefore, they are now able to see\r\n\r\nwhat  is right and what is wrong, and to make out  what\r\n\r\nis  true merger and what is phoney merger. Last Friday,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Member for Nee Soon was exposing the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nphoney  merger in this House, he pointed out  that  the\r\n\r\nleadership  of the P.A.P. had deviated from  its  Left-wing  socialist  stand. But our clever Prime  Minister,\r\n\r\nour  cunning  Prime  Minister,  produced  on  that  day\r\n\r\ncorrespondence  between himself and the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nof the Federation of Malaya. But we know very well that\r\n\r\nthe  contents  were out of date when he produced  them.\r\n\r\nThe  contents  related to nationality, citizenship  and\r\n\r\nrepresentation to the Federal Parliament. The Tunku had\r\n\r\nclearly  given  his answer to these few points  at  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Airport. Therefore, when the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nof the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleft  for  London, the Prime Minister of Singapore\r\n\r\nproduced  those letters. What was his  motive?  On\r\n\r\nSaturday  there  was  no sitting  of  this  House.\r\n\r\nPerhaps his intention was to have headlines spread\r\n\r\nover the newspaper's front page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Article 22 of the Constitution of the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.
