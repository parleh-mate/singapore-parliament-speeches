It seems to me that\r\n\r\nthe  obligation is an obligation on the  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  President  to  furnish  the  Report  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister, and it is the Minister in turn  who  is\r\n\r\nunder a responsibility to this Assembly to ensure\r\n\r\nthat the Report is received and presented to this\r\n\r\nAssembly. In other words, it is the Minister  who\r\n\r\nin  the  first instance is answerable to  the  As\r\n\r\nsembly for the default, if any, of the President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, however, the Minister or any other Member\r\n\r\nhas  satisfied  himself that  there  has  been  a\r\n\r\ndefault  on the part of the President  which,  in\r\n\r\nthe   Minister's  or  the  Member's  view,  would\r\n\r\nwarrant the intervention of this Assembly, it  is\r\n\r\nopen to the Minister or the Member to move for an\r\n\r\nOrder in the matter and for this Assembly to make\r\n\r\nthe Order if it so thinks fit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am bound to say, however, that it is doubtful\r\n\r\nwhether  any such Order could be effective  under\r\n\r\nour present Privileges Ordinance.

They\r\n\r\ntried to draw a picture of a dragon which was  not\r\n\r\nrealistic and certain parts of the picture had  to\r\n\r\nbe  painted  over by other artistic painters.  The\r\n\r\npicture drawn by them was incorrect and very  poor\r\n\r\nindeed.  Before we talk about poverty, we have  to\r\n\r\ntake  the  economic  situation in  Singapore  into\r\n\r\nconsideration.  If we are faced with  an  economic\r\n\r\nsituation which cannot meet our requirements, then\r\n\r\nwe  will have to look for other avenues to help us\r\n\r\ntide over it. In recent months, the Members of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis have not tried to help  us  with\r\n\r\nimproving  our  economic position.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand, they accuse us of having put our economy  in\r\n\r\na  predicament. Because the people are poor,  they\r\n\r\nare  unable to buy goods. This contributes to  the\r\n\r\npoor market and products are not easily sold.  The\r\n\r\nblame  for some of these things should, to a great\r\n\r\nextent,  be  put on the shoulders of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  When  merger  with  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  is  achieved,  our products  will  have  a\r\n\r\nlarger  market, and this will help to improve  our\r\n\r\neconomic  situation.  This is  one  of  the  steps\r\n\r\ntowards  this aim. But the Members of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis have been trying hard to hinder this move\r\n\r\ntowards merger.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated already\r\n\r\nthat  there  can be no reference to  merger  which\r\n\r\nwill  excite  a  debate. The hon.

He must  not  touch  on\r\n\r\nmerger in that strain.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I was only mentioning it in passing. I  will\r\n\r\nnow continue with another part.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I indicated to the Member for Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  yesterday that merger must not be  referred\r\n\r\nto in that strain even in passing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  now  let  me  reply to the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\naccusations  regarding certain situations  in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas. They mentioned street lights, water,\r\n\r\nelectricity   supplies.  On  these  questions   my\r\n\r\ncolleagues already replied yesterday. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor National Development also replied. But I would\r\n\r\ngive a further reply to certain points raised.  In\r\n\r\nthe  speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  it is\r\n\r\nclearly   stated   that   we   will   build   more\r\n\r\nagricultural  stations next year,  and  will  send\r\n\r\nmore agricultural officers and veterinary officers\r\n\r\nto  carry out services in the rural areas in  this\r\n\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example. We will increase medical\r\n\r\nservices  and  veterinary services.  The  services\r\n\r\nrendered  to chickens in the past have been  super\r\n\r\nseded.  We are using scientific methods  to  treat\r\n\r\nchickens  and  other domestic animals  and  reduce\r\n\r\ntheir   fatality.  On  the  other  hand,  we   are\r\n\r\nincreasing  the production of chickens  and  other\r\n\r\ndomestic animals. This will help the farmers to  a\r\n\r\ncertain extent. We will also introduce many  kinds\r\n\r\nof scientific methods to enable the farmers to use\r\n\r\nthese  methods to improve their agricultural  work\r\n\r\nand to compete with old methods. There is proof to\r\n\r\nshow   that   agricultural  products   have   been\r\n\r\nincreased this year. In the past our market was  a\r\n\r\nconsumers'  market, but nowadays we  are  able  to\r\n\r\nexport  our agricultural produce. This is concrete\r\n\r\nproof of the achievements by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, just now I have been talking about\r\n\r\nthe  rearing  of chickens. Now I will mention  the\r\n\r\nfeeding of pigs in Singapore. These past few years\r\n\r\nwe  have  been importing pigs of good strain  from\r\n\r\nEurope and America and these have been sold at one-tenth the original cost. This also is to help  the\r\n\r\nfarmers   in  their  production.  In  agricultural\r\n\r\nexperiment situations the chickens hatched every\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmonth  are sold to the farmers at very low prices. In  all  these fields we have been trying to  help\r\n\r\nthe  farmers increase their produce by the aid  of\r\n\r\nscientific  methods.  We will  show  them  how  to\r\n\r\nachieve  artificial breeding of domestic  animals.\r\n\r\nThis will also help them to a great extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now talk about fisheries. On this\r\n\r\nquestion,  in  order to increase  their  production\r\n\r\nand  reduce their costs, we have been teaching them\r\n\r\nhow   to   use   new  fishing  boats  and   fishing\r\n\r\nimplements  and  we  have  been  supplying  certain\r\n\r\nfishing  implements to them. We have conducted  for\r\n\r\nthem  courses  in fishery. In the  coming  year  we\r\n\r\nwill  establish more of such schools teaching these\r\n\r\ncourses  along the east coast. This is to  increase\r\n\r\nthe  technique of the fishermen in order to  enable\r\n\r\nthem  to make a living and be able to compete  with\r\n\r\nothers  in the business of catching fish.  We  have\r\n\r\nalso  established  a mobile motor  service  station\r\n\r\nwhich  is  to help repair fishing boats on request.\r\n\r\nCertain  officers will proceed to the  place  where\r\n\r\nsuch  services are required to repair  their  motor\r\n\r\nboats.  As to the question of fishermen on  certain\r\n\r\nislands,  we have this year already carried  out  a\r\n\r\nscheme  of distributing goats to them. My colleague\r\n\r\nwill give details of this scheme later on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, besides agriculture and\r\n\r\nfishery,  we  have been providing tractors  to  the\r\n\r\nfarmers  to help increase their production  and  to\r\n\r\nreduce  labour hands and thus reduce their cost  of\r\n\r\nproduction. This service has been well received  by\r\n\r\nthe  farmers.  We  have also established  a  mobile\r\n\r\nteaching  institution to teach the farmers  how  to\r\n\r\ntake  care  of  their lands and how  to  carry  out\r\n\r\nagricultural and other activities. The  aim  is  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  farmers  increase their  production  and\r\n\r\nreduce  their cost of production and  in  this  way\r\n\r\nhelp them generally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if all these measures are not\r\n\r\ndirected  at  helping  the  farmers  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas,  then  I  cannot  understand  what  can   be\r\n\r\nconstrued   as  helping  the  farmers.  I   believe\r\n\r\neverybody will agree with me, that the lot  of  the\r\n\r\nfarmers cannot be improved just by shouting  a  few\r\n\r\nslogans.  The Members of the Barisan Sosialis  have\r\n\r\nclaimed themselves to be\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrevolutionaries.  If  they are  really  concerned\r\n\r\nwith the livelihood of the farmers, then let them\r\n\r\ndo  something to help the economic development of\r\n\r\nSingapore and not hamper it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will talk about the shortage\r\n\r\nof arable land, which the Opposition Members have\r\n\r\nbeen talking about during these few days. The Gov\r\n\r\nernment  has  already taken steps  this  year  to\r\n\r\nreclaim  lands  in the Sungei Poyang  area.  This\r\n\r\nproject  will  be completed at the  beginning  of\r\n\r\nnext  year. After completion the land can be  put\r\n\r\nto  three uses. First, the land reclaimed can  be\r\n\r\nused  to  grow  vegetables.  Secondly,  the  land\r\n\r\nreclaimed can be used for fish ponds to  increase\r\n\r\nproduction.  Thirdly, certain lands  can  provide\r\n\r\nprawn ponds. All these will help to increase  the\r\n\r\nagricultural products for the needs of Singapore.\r\n\r\nIn  this  way we will be helping the  farmers  in\r\n\r\ntheir livelihood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the debate, I can come to\r\n\r\nthis conclusion. For the record, I will point out\r\n\r\nto this House that in the modern political arena,\r\n\r\nthere  are  two ways in which you  take  part  in\r\n\r\npolitical activities. One is where the activities\r\n\r\nare carried out in accordance with constitutional\r\n\r\nmeans to improve the lot of the people, and  with\r\n\r\nthe  consent  of the people. This  has  been  our\r\n\r\npolicy all\r\n\r\nalong.  The  second  way is to  create  political\r\n\r\ntrouble  and  damage  the  economic  position  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  behind  the scenes, thereby  hampering\r\n\r\nthe  livelihood  of the people, to  arouse  their\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction, and to urge or  excite  them  to\r\n\r\nseize political power. This way is adopted by the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to avoid this tragedy\r\n\r\noccurring   in  Singapore,  I  hope  the   policy\r\n\r\nstatement  by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  can  be\r\n\r\nrealised  and that Singapore will merge with  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, the important question\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  today,  the question  that  is  in\r\n\r\neverybody's    mind,   is   the    question    of\r\n\r\nunemployment. The Government have indicated  that\r\n\r\nthey  hoped  to  ease  the  unemployment  problem\r\n\r\nthrough industrial\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexpansion, But we are told, Sir, in the speech of\r\n\r\nthe Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nthis is Hansard, Vol. 15, col. 13:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Before, however, any significant improvement in\r\n\r\nthe  economic  and  industrial expansion  can  take\r\n\r\nplace, there must be brought\r\n\r\nabout a situation of political certainty and\r\n\r\nstability, within which it will be possible for\r\n\r\nlong-term investment of capital to be planned with\r\n\r\nconfidence.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  His Excellency says, \"must be brought about\".\r\n\r\nThat  indicates that it does not exist today.  Sir,\r\n\r\nmay  I  refer you to an earlier Hansard,  Vol.  11,\r\n\r\nNo. 1 of 1st July, 1959, in col. 7. It says here\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The political stability which is a pre-requisite\r\n\r\nfor  expansion  and which has been lacking  for  so\r\n\r\nlong, has been achieved by the election\r\n\r\nwith  an  overwhelming  majority  of  a  Government\r\n\r\nwhose   declared   policies   are   clear-cut   and\r\n\r\nunambiguous.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>It says that in 1959, Sir, this stability has\r\n\r\nbeen  achieved. Again in 1960, Sir, - I refer you  to\r\n\r\nHansard, Vol. 13, No. 1, col. 5  -  it says here  in\r\n\r\nline 9:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... Singapore has enjoyed greater political\r\n\r\nand economic stability than it has known during\r\n\r\nthe last 15 years.'\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  we were told in 1959 that stability had  been\r\n\r\nachieved.   In   1960  we  were  enjoying   greater\r\n\r\nstability than was ever known in 15 years. In  1961\r\n\r\nwe   are  told  that  we  must  go  and  find  that\r\n\r\nstability;  \"bring it about\". May I  ask  what  has\r\n\r\nhappened  to  the stability that has  already  been\r\n\r\nachieved?  Sir, I doubt whether what has been  lost\r\n\r\ncan be regained, because when the Government had  a\r\n\r\npowerful  majority of 43 against 8, they  lost  the\r\n\r\nstability that was already there. Now with  a  weak\r\n\r\n26,  it is not likely and not easy that they  could\r\n\r\nregain  the stability they have, lost. The  trouble\r\n\r\nis  this. There can be no political stability where\r\n\r\nthere is political corruption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, non-P.A.P. citizens have chosen non-P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers    to    represent    them    in    certain\r\n\r\nconstituencies. They have indicated in no uncertain\r\n\r\nterms  that  they have rejected a P.A.P. candidate.\r\n\r\nThey  do  not want a P.A.P. candidate to  represent\r\n\r\nthem.  They  want somebody else. And what  happens?\r\n\r\nThey  have  a  right,  Sir - political  franchise - to\r\n\r\nchoose  whom  they  like. The Government,  if  they\r\n\r\nrecognise political franchise, if  they\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nclaim  that  Singapore  has  political  franchise,\r\n\r\nmust  recognise the representative that  has  been\r\n\r\nchosen   by   the  people.  But  not  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Sir. They force their representatives\r\n\r\non  the  people. In divisions where the electorate\r\n\r\nhave chosen other than the P.A.P. representatives,\r\n\r\nthey  have  been  forced to accept the  leadership\r\n\r\nfrom P.A.P. Assemblymen or defeated candidates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope you will allow me to quote one more\r\n\r\nexample,  Sir, to substantiate my accusation  that\r\n\r\nthere is political corruption. When the school  at\r\n\r\nGuillemard was built with public funds, [Laughter] \r\n\r\n- the  Minister laughs; he knows what this  is  all\r\n\r\nabout because he is guilty of it - that school  was\r\n\r\nbuilt. What happened? When the people went  there\r\n\r\nthey  did not see the leader that they had chosen.\r\n\r\nThey  did  not see the person they chose as  their\r\n\r\nrepresentative, but a P.A.P. Assemblyman\r\n\r\nfrom  a neighbouring constituency was brought into\r\n\r\nthat   constituency   to   act   as   leader   and\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the people to open that  school.\r\n\r\nSir,  the electorate have indicated whom they want\r\n\r\nas their leader. Why must they be forced to accept\r\n\r\na  neighbouring leader to come and lead them?  Why\r\n\r\nmust  the leader that they have chosen be  brushed\r\n\r\naside?  Sir,  I  take it this is  an  attempt  to\r\n\r\nconfuse  the public into thinking that the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nAssemblyman is their leader and to make  them  get\r\n\r\nused to the idea that the P.A.P. Assemblyman,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  is  their  leader.  [Laughter]  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  laughs.  I tell him  this.  I  have  won\r\n\r\nMountbatten in a\r\n\r\nclean  fight  in  the last election,  and  if  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. wants Mountbatten, let them fight it  in  a\r\n\r\nclean fight in the next election and not rob me of\r\n\r\nthe constituency.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for\r\n\r\nMountbatten is perhaps getting too excited. It is\r\n\r\nnot too good for this Chamber. It is not too good\r\n\r\nfor  the  Speaker.  But I would  suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of the Government Front Benches  not  to\r\n\r\ndeal with these matters with such frivolity and\r\n\r\nnot  to sneer at remarks passed by the Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sorry, Sir, I take it that\r\n\r\nnot only am I robbed of my\r\n\r\nconstituency, but the constituents are  robbed  of\r\n\r\ntheir  leader too. The same attempt has been  made.\r\n\r\nIt  was  not an oversight because this has happened\r\n\r\nmore  than  once.  When  the Mountbatten  community\r\n\r\ncentre was opened, as has been mentioned before,  I\r\n\r\nwas  not  even invited. In Joo Chiat you knew  what\r\n\r\nhappened,  Sir, It  has  been  mentioned  that   a\r\n\r\ndefeated candidate was asked to open that centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can there be political stability when there\r\n\r\nis  such  political corruption? Sir,  public  funds\r\n\r\nhave  been  spent not on improving the lot  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  or  the  State, but to pay  P.A.P. cadres,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Political Secretaries  and  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation's  staff. As I have said  before,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. cannot  deny this, because  the  staff\r\n\r\nhave been called upon and told that they either  be\r\n\r\nloyal  or  be  asked  to quit. The  wishes  of  the\r\n\r\nmasses have been thoroughly ignored.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that there are 60,000 unemployed, plus\r\n\r\nthe  thousands  that  will be leaving  school  each\r\n\r\nyear  who will be seeking jobs. It looks as if  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is   unlikely  to  regain  the   political\r\n\r\nstability  sought  to be brought about.  Then  what\r\n\r\nhappens?  If the solution of unemployment  lies  in\r\n\r\nthe   expansion  of  industry,  if  there   is   no\r\n\r\npolitical stability, and it can\r\n\r\nnot  be obtained or regained by the P.A.P.,  I  ask\r\n\r\nthem,  Sir,  for  the  60,000  unemployed  and  the\r\n\r\nchildren  who leave school, where do they  go  from\r\n\r\nthere?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been told in the speech of His\r\n\r\nExcellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in  Hansard,\r\n\r\nVol.  15,  No.  1,  col. 23 (31st October,  1961),\r\n\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The problem that is always uppermost in the\r\n\r\ndeliberations of the Government is that\r\n\r\nof unemployment. This problem has been partially\r\n\r\nalleviated . . .'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It says it has been \"partially alleviated\". I\r\n\r\ncannot understand how it has been alleviated  when\r\n\r\nin 1958 we find in statistics that there were\r\n\r\nabout 16,000 unemployed; in 1959, it went up  more\r\n\r\nthan  double, 36,000; and recently, at the end  of\r\n\r\n1960, I think, in answer to one of my questions, I\r\n\r\nthink  the  figure  59,000 was  given.  Sir,  from\r\n\r\n16,000  it has gone up to 59,000, and we are  told\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  problem  has been alleviated. I  remember  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. did argue that the big number does not  mean\r\n\r\nvery  much because it was their confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nnew Government that made them rush to register. The\r\n\r\nunemployed  had  always  been  there,  but  it  was\r\n\r\nbecause  of  their confidence in the new Government\r\n\r\nthat they have come on to the register now. Sir, if\r\n\r\nyou  read  the  Annual  Report  of  the  State   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  1959, page 133, statistics  there  show\r\n\r\nthat  this argument is not very logical unless  the\r\n\r\nunemployed has a funny logic. In 1955, out of 1,381\r\n\r\nregistrants   of  unemployment,  368   were   given\r\n\r\nemployment, that is about 25 per cent roughly. Then\r\n\r\nin  1959,  out of 3,059 registered, only  313  were\r\n\r\ngiven employment, which was less than in 1955. This\r\n\r\nis only about 10 per cent. Sir, when 25 per cent of\r\n\r\nthose  who  registered were given  employment,  the\r\n\r\nunemployed had no confidence to register, but  when\r\n\r\nonly  10  per  cent registered, they  had  all  the\r\n\r\nconfidence in the world and 59,000 people rushed to\r\n\r\nregister. Sir, I am sure that is not very  logical.\r\n\r\nBut that is the way the Ministers have argued.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, there has been a lot of talk about\r\n\r\nindustrial  expansion. We have been  told  in  the\r\n\r\nsame  Hansard as I have read just now, i.e.,  Vol.\r\n\r\n15,  No.  1,  col. 23, which says the unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem has been partially alleviated; it goes  on\r\n\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...by the present boom in the building industry\r\n\r\nand  the  gradual  materialisation  of  plans  for\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are told that plans for industrialisation are\r\n\r\nmaterialising and there is a boom in, the building\r\n\r\nindustry.  Yet,  Sir, if we look  in  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nstatistics, it shows that in the industrial field,\r\n\r\nmanufacturing shows 50,878 employed  in  1958  and\r\n\r\n42,945  in 1960, both in September, the difference\r\n\r\nis  7,933,  nearly  8,000.  8,000  labourers  less\r\n\r\nemployed  in  manufacturing, but we say  that  our\r\n\r\nindustry is expanding and the expansion is  taking\r\n\r\nin more unemployed people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are told that there is a building boom when in\r\n\r\nthe   same  statistics  it  shows  that   in   the\r\n\r\nconstruction   section,  there   is   3,159   less\r\n\r\nlabourers employed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSir,   we  do  not  know  which  to  believe   the\r\n\r\nstatistics   or   the  statement.  Anyway,   about\r\n\r\nunemployment,  up  to  June  1959,  there  was  an\r\n\r\nunemployment  relief scheme which gives  temporary\r\n\r\nrelief  to the unemployed. There was, I think,  in  1959   before   June  1,165  who  were   receiving\r\n\r\nanything  between $3 and $5 with  two  katties  of\r\n\r\nrice  and one katty of sugar to take home to their\r\n\r\nfamilies.  This  was  abolished  immediately   the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. came in, and was substituted by  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade.  Sir,  what is the Work Brigade?  We  all\r\n\r\nknow  the  meaning  of  \"work\",  but  what  is   a\r\n\r\n\"brigade\"?  The  Oxford  Dictionary  gives   three\r\n\r\nmeanings:  Subdivision of army  (and  its  description),  uniformed  workers  and  disciplining  and\r\n\r\noccupying boys. Sir, is our Work Brigade an  army?\r\n\r\nAre  they  workers  or are they  delinquents  that\r\n\r\nneed  to be disciplined? The Government have said,\r\n\r\nin  answer to some attempts to form a union,  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  not workers. They cannot form  a  union\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are not workers. Then  are  they  a\r\n\r\nsubdivision  of  any army or are they  delinquents\r\n\r\nmeant  to  be disciplined? We all know what  they\r\n\r\nare,  Sir.  We have seen what they have been  used\r\n\r\nfor,   because   the   P.A.P. has   turned    an\r\n\r\nunemployment  relief scheme into  a  Work  Brigade\r\n\r\nspending  $7  million  not,  as  stated  in   this\r\n\r\nreport, to expand opportunities for work. It  says\r\n\r\nhere:  it has been used to build an army to  fight\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P. political  battle.  It   has   been\r\n\r\norganised  to form a section of workers  who  will\r\n\r\nbe   depending   on  the  P.A.P.  Government   for\r\n\r\nsurvival and must therefore of necessity be  loyal\r\n\r\nto  them.  So they thought. We knew what happened.\r\n\r\nTo  stand  on  the  roads  and  cheer  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwhenever  they come to this Chamber the first  day\r\n\r\nof Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1959, the P.A.P. came to power with an\r\n\r\noverwhelming  majority - 43 against  8.  That  shows\r\n\r\nthe  people accepted their policies and have given\r\n\r\nthem  a  full mandate to implement these policies.\r\n\r\nIt  shows the people had confidence and trust both\r\n\r\nin  their  policies  and in  the  Party.  All  the\r\n\r\npeople  wanted were employment, houses,  food  and\r\n\r\nwater, peace\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  stability,  personal freedom, good  education\r\n\r\nfor  their  children, a just, honest  and  sincere\r\n\r\ngovernment. They were promised these, Sir. But the\r\n\r\nquestion  is: Have these promises been  fulfilled?\r\n\r\nWhat  is the position today? Today there are  very\r\n\r\nmany  more unemployed than ever before.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\npromise  of  solution  of  unemployment  has  been\r\n\r\ngiven, but we find there are more unemployed  than\r\n\r\never  before.  Sir,  I  say  that  the  misery  of\r\n\r\nunemployment and other miseries that have befallen\r\n\r\nSingapore have been brought by the P.A.P. due  to\r\n\r\ntheir neglect of duty to the people and the State,\r\n\r\ndue  to  their arrogance, their mismanagement  and\r\n\r\ntheir political corruption. In 2\u00bd years they  have\r\n\r\nspent  millions of dollars of public  funds;  they\r\n\r\nhave  used  almost every Government department  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up  a  little P.A.P. empire.  The  people's\r\n\r\nwelfare has been postponed from year to year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Hansard of Vol. 13, No. 1 (20th July\r\n\r\n1960),  col. 5, we have been told, Sir, that  \"The\r\n\r\nfirst  year  of  office was one of reorganisation,\r\n\r\nconsolidation  and preparation. It  was  taken  up\r\n\r\nlargely  with clearing the ground and setting  the\r\n\r\ncourse  for  the year of construction ....\".  But,\r\n\r\nrecently,  Sir,  the Deputy Prime  Minister,  when\r\n\r\nmoving the motion of thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara,  said that between 1959 and 1961, that  is\r\n\r\nthe  first  year,  \"We  first  took  over  the  Government,  we had to feel our way.\"  he  says  the\r\n\r\nfirst year was \"feeling our way\". here it says the\r\n\r\nfirst   year   was  planning,  the   second   year\r\n\r\nconstruction, which means, first year plan, second\r\n\r\nyear  action. Here it says the first year was only\r\n\r\n\"feeling  our way\", second year was for plans  for\r\n\r\neconomic development, and only the second half  of\r\n\r\n1961  marks the beginning of implementation. Well,\r\n\r\nI  hope,  Sir, the calendar will not be moved  one\r\n\r\nyear  back again; it has already been  moved  one\r\n\r\nyear   back;  first  year  planning,  second  year\r\n\r\nimplementation,  and  now  we  hear   first   year\r\n\r\n\"feeling  our  way\", second year, planning,  third\r\n\r\nyear,  implementation. I hope something  new  will\r\n\r\nnot be invented next year.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):\r\n\r\nThird year - acceleration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, as I have said, they\r\n\r\nhave failed to give employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next one is housing. Have they succeeded? As\r\n\r\nyou know, Sir, they built practically nothing the\r\n\r\nfirst year. When they were exposed here in answer\r\n\r\nto  some  of  my  questions as to the  number  of\r\n\r\nhouses built, and when it was found that they had\r\n\r\nbuilt  practically nothing, they conveniently  at\r\n\r\nthat time blamed the Member for Hong Lim. But now\r\n\r\nthat  they have built some, Sir, what do we find?\r\n\r\nRents are terribly high; the people cannot afford\r\n\r\nthe  rents; and there are lots of houses  vacant.\r\n\r\nNow,  Sir,  at a time when thousands are  on  the\r\n\r\nwaiting list, Government keeps the houses vacant.\r\n\r\nAs  high as 18 per cent of the one-room,  16  per\r\n\r\ncent of the two-room and 6 per cent of the three-room  premises are vacant, Sir, In all, it  comes\r\n\r\nto  a  total  of  879  units  vacant.  There  are\r\n\r\nthousands on the waiting list. Not only  are  the\r\n\r\nrents  high,  but  they are  so  ridiculous  that\r\n\r\ncertain  portions of those houses  are  naturally\r\n\r\nvacant  and are not likely to be occupied because\r\n\r\nwhere  they  charge  $35  per  one-room  unit - the\r\n\r\nkitchen,  water  closet, washing  facilities  are\r\n\r\ncommunal  they charge $20 for a room  which  only\r\n\r\nhas the W.C. as a communal facility, the rest are\r\n\r\nself-contained. Naturally, nobody wants  to  take\r\n\r\nthe  $35 type of unit. When I ask why, I was told\r\n\r\nbecause  it was Mr Ong Eng Guan's plan. Sir,  we\r\n\r\ndo   not  care  whose  plan  it  was,  but   the\r\n\r\nGovernment must do something. They must not leave\r\n\r\nthose houses vacant forever and ever and lose not\r\n\r\nonly  the rent, but the Housing Board has to  pay\r\n\r\nassessment  to  the  Assessment  Department.  All\r\n\r\nthat, Sir, is unfair, because it adds to the cost\r\n\r\nof  the house. This paying of assessment is  from\r\n\r\none Government Department to another. They do not\r\n\r\nlose.  All that is added to the cost of the house\r\n\r\nand the poor tenant eventually has to pay for the\r\n\r\nshifting  of money from one Government Department\r\n\r\nto another, which is really unfair.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor which adds on to the rent which\r\n\r\nmakes  their  policy cock-eyed is  the  paying  of\r\n\r\nproperty tax on vacant premises. It affects  other\r\n\r\npeople badly enough, Sir, but it also affects this\r\n\r\nHousing   Board.  It  ,pays  property   tax   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, as I have said, whatever they  lose  is\r\n\r\nadded on to the cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a lot can be done about housing. Far too\r\n\r\nmany  houses  are vacant for reasons  which  could\r\n\r\neasily be rectified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other sore point about housing are the\r\n\r\nunauthorised huts. Instead of nipping  it  in  the\r\n\r\nbud, as I have suggested right from the beginning,\r\n\r\nas  in the case of those houses that have come  up\r\n\r\nin  years  past, and to take a very  firm  control\r\n\r\nover the future position to see that nobody builds\r\n\r\nunauthorised huts, this sore has been  allowed  to\r\n\r\nfester  and  fester and fester  until  now  it  is\r\n\r\nalmost  in  unmanageable proportions.  The  longer\r\n\r\nthey  delay, Sir, the more unauthorised huts there\r\n\r\nwill be and the bigger the problem will be and the\r\n\r\nmore difficult the solution. They should handle it\r\n\r\nsooner,  authorise  the huts that  deserve  to  be\r\n\r\nauthorised - because having lived there for so  many\r\n\r\nyears  people  have nowhere to go - and  then  start\r\n\r\ncontrolling either by legislation or otherwise  to\r\n\r\nsee  that no more unauthorised huts go up.  Unless\r\n\r\nthey  do  that, Sir, this sore is going to  fester\r\n\r\nand  eventually be fatal, I am afraid. Just now  I\r\n\r\nread  to you that the Government has claimed  that\r\n\r\nthere  is a building boom. But on page 28  of  the\r\n\r\n\"Malayan Statistics\" of October 1961, we  see  the\r\n\r\nlowest  number  of units built in  1960.  Sir,  in\r\n\r\n1958, it was 437; in 1959, it was 774; in 1960, it\r\n\r\nwas  422;  and  in 1961 it was 266. In  all  these\r\n\r\ncases,  the  period covered was  from  January  to\r\n\r\nAugust. It was the lowest in 1961. Yet we are told\r\n\r\nthat  there  is a building boom. [Interruption]  I\r\n\r\nagree that the building position has improved, but\r\n\r\nI  would  not  call it a boom. It would  not  have\r\n\r\nimproved  if  the Government had  not  decided  to\r\n\r\nrectify   their   detrimental  decision   on   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment   charges   in   respect   of   water,\r\n\r\nelectricity and other services. In fact,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhen they rectified that, the building trade began\r\n\r\nto show a revival. But I say, Sir, that it has not\r\n\r\ncome to a satisfactory\r\n\r\nposition yet because developers now - leaving aside\r\n\r\nthose charges - are hesitating to build because of\r\n\r\nthe stupid decision to charge assessment on vacant\r\n\r\nhouses. I have shown just now how it has affected\r\n\r\nthe tenants; but now it affects the developers too\r\n\r\nbecause if a house can be rented at $200 and a\r\n\r\ndeveloper decides to build 1,000 houses in an\r\n\r\nestate, he pays assessment at the rate of 36 per\r\n\r\ncent, which is $72. That means he pays $72,000\r\n\r\nevery month until his houses are sold. Sir, which\r\n\r\ndeveloper will not think twice before he\r\n\r\nstarts developing? In fact, the landlords too are\r\n\r\nhesitating to expand their business here. They\r\n\r\nwould rather go to the Federation or any other\r\n\r\nplace where they\r\n\r\ndo not run the risk of facing bankruptcy\r\n\r\nfrom having to pay assessment on vacant houses, if\r\n\r\ntheir houses happen to be\r\n\r\nvacant.  While superficially it seems to be capable\r\n\r\nof  bringing  in  money for the Government,  it  is\r\n\r\ndestroying  the  building  trade.  It  is  no   use\r\n\r\nblaming the Member for Hong Lim or Members  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis for not having done\r\n\r\ntheir duty when they were on the other side of the\r\n\r\nHouse. Because they were\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P.'s choice and if the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders  do  not have the quality of  choosing  the\r\n\r\nright  men  to run their business, whose  fault  is\r\n\r\nit, Sir?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another two essentials of life are food and\r\n\r\nwater.  Sir, I am sure you will agree with me  that\r\n\r\nany stupid government can\r\n\r\nsupply  water during the rainy season.  But  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  sign of a good and efficient government  which\r\n\r\nplans ahead or makes\r\n\r\nadequate  arrangements to meet unexpected droughts.\r\n\r\nOn  page  14  of Hansard, Volume 15, No.  1,  dated\r\n\r\n31st October, 1961, it is stated:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Concerning water supplies, the Tebrau\r\n\r\nWaterworks in Johore has been recently extended  to\r\n\r\ngive an increased supply of 15 million gallons  per\r\n\r\nday.  Furthermore, an agreement  to  extract  water\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Scudai  River  in  Johore  was  recently\r\n\r\nsigned   and   the  construction  of   the   Scudai\r\n\r\nWaterworks  will commence at the end of this  year.\r\n\r\nThe project is expected to take approximately two\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyears  to complete. The first phase of the Scudai\r\n\r\nScheme will produce a further 15 million gallons\r\n\r\nper  day.  The Tebrau extension should  meet  our\r\n\r\nordinary needs until the\r\n\r\nScudai Scheme is completed.'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"our  ordinary needs\", Sir. Does it mean that  if\r\n\r\nthere  are  further droughts next  year,  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to have further water rationing until  the\r\n\r\nScudai  scheme  is completed,  in  the  next  two\r\n\r\nyears? If the Member for Farrer Park is right - and\r\n\r\nhe  should be, having had such experience in  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council before - that means even after  the\r\n\r\ncompletion  of the Scudai scheme, we might  still\r\n\r\nhave  water  rationing. If they  cannot  give  us\r\n\r\nemployment and houses, at least give us water  to\r\n\r\ndrink.  What type of a government is  this  which\r\n\r\ncannot give us water to drink?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What is beer for?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> That is not what beer is\r\n\r\nfor. That is the P.A.P. mentality. The poor\r\n\r\ncannot afford beer, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next to water is food. The poor and the\r\n\r\nrich  need  food. This Government is a Government\r\n\r\nthat  claims to work for the poor. They plan  and\r\n\r\nthey  work  for  the poor. They are  chiefly  concerned with the poor. I was surprised to find  in\r\n\r\nthe  \"Malayan Statistics\" that the prices of food\r\n\r\nwhich finds its way to the table of the poor have\r\n\r\ngone up very much and the food that finds its way\r\n\r\nto  the  table  of the rich and the middle  class\r\n\r\nhave gone down.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> No, it is impossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Yes, definitely, Sir, In\r\n\r\nthe case of fish, it is the rich man who goes for\r\n\r\nikan bawal, pomfret, kurau, large prawns, and  so\r\n\r\non.  But  the poor people take ikan bilis,  selah\r\n\r\nand  tamban.  If you look at the statistics,  the\r\n\r\nfood  that usually goes to the table of the  poor\r\n\r\nhas  gone  up quite a lot in price, by  about  18\r\n\r\ncents  per katty, whereas the food for  the  rich\r\n\r\nhas gone down by about 20 cents per katty. I will\r\n\r\nnot  go  into details, but just to show you  that\r\n\r\nthe  food of the poor is going up. The Government\r\n\r\nmight  think that this is a frivolous  matter  to\r\n\r\nbring up in this House, but I would like to point\r\n\r\nout that\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  small rise in the price of food for the rich  is\r\n\r\nnothing - it  would probably mean less  hoarding  of\r\n\r\nmoney;  for the middle class, it might  mean  just\r\n\r\ncutting  out  a bit of luxury; but for  the  poor,\r\n\r\nSir, it would mean malnutrition, weaker youth  for\r\n\r\nour  next generation. It is no exaggeration,  Sir.\r\n\r\nIt would mean less resistance to disease. It would\r\n\r\nalso  mean that school children would be  affected\r\n\r\nin their work if they are undernourished. I am not\r\n\r\nspeaking   as   a   woman  who   understands   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties of a housewife with a limited  purse,\r\n\r\nbut  I  am speaking as one who has been the principal  of  a  school right in the heart of Chinatown\r\n\r\nand   has  seen  little  children  suffering  from\r\n\r\nmalnutrition. As a social worker, I  have  made  a\r\n\r\nstudy  of it and I have found - without exaggeration - \r\n\r\nthat   it  does  affect  the  children.  If   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does  not want to bother  itself  with\r\n\r\nvisiting  these places and making  a  study,  they\r\n\r\njust  have  to  read reports from the  F.A.O. and\r\n\r\nE.C.A.F.E. which   stress  the   importance   of\r\n\r\nnutrition. They have also stressed the dangers  of\r\n\r\nmalnutrition in the countries of South-East  Asia.\r\n\r\nI  do  not know why they seem to be very frivolous\r\n\r\nabout  this, Sir, whenever we talk about children.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  talked about the Chinese school children\r\n\r\nthe  last  time, the Prime Minister seemed  to  be\r\n\r\nvery  happy and he laughed over it. The Government\r\n\r\nMembers  always  laugh  when  the  dangers  facing\r\n\r\nchildren  are pointed out to them. I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhy, Sir.

You just  have\r\n\r\nto  look at Raffles Place and see the filth strewn\r\n\r\nby  the hawkers. I am not blaming the hawkers.

The overall policy clearly\r\n\r\naims  at  eventually controlling  all  social  and\r\n\r\nrecreational    groups   through   the    People's\r\n\r\nAssociation and the community centres, all workers\r\n\r\nthrough  the T.U.C. which has now failed, all  the\r\n\r\nunemployed  through  the  Work  Brigade,  all  the\r\n\r\neffective politicians by giving them good posts of\r\n\r\n$1,100  a month to do no harm, and all the farmers\r\n\r\nand  rural  people through their associations.  In\r\n\r\nthis  way,  Sir,  the P.A.P. hope to  control  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  sections of the whole of the population\r\n\r\nof Singapore.

It is now more  than\r\n\r\n1\u00bd  months  since this policy speech was delivered\r\n\r\nby  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara and the Government\r\n\r\ncan  hardly  be  said to be paying His  Excellency\r\n\r\nmuch  respect  by having pushed in  all  sorts  of\r\n\r\ninterjectory motions. It is a pity that the Budget\r\n\r\ndebate  had to come before the debate on the  main\r\n\r\npolicy  speech. The result was that  many  matters\r\n\r\nhad been touched on rather inadequately because of\r\n\r\nthe time guillotine on the Budget debate. However,\r\n\r\nSir,  never  have  we seen any  government  policy\r\n\r\nstatement so utterly dry and so completely  devoid\r\n\r\nof  colour  and imagination. One cannot  but  feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  this  year  is  simply  not\r\n\r\ninterested in forwarding any policy at  all.  Gone\r\n\r\nare  the  days when the P.A.P. could  put  forward\r\n\r\npolicy  statements full of imagination  and  drive\r\n\r\nthat  reflected  the vigour and  dynamism  of  the\r\n\r\nearlier  days of the P.A.P. In the first  year  of\r\n\r\noffice, the P.A.P. had called it a year that would\r\n\r\nlead  to  a  more equal and just society.  In  the\r\n\r\nsecond  year the P.A.P. had painted it, as Members\r\n\r\nhave  already  said, as the year of  construction.\r\n\r\nThis year the P.A.P. has not bothered to give it a\r\n\r\nname, let alone a policy. So what has happened  to\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.?  Where have all the imagination,  the\r\n\r\nvigour and the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndynamism of the P.A.P. gone to?

What is\r\n\r\nleft  of  the  original P.A.P. is  a  colourless,\r\n\r\nuninspiring  group of desperate politicians  whose\r\n\r\nsole aim in life is to keep themselves in office.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said, Sir, that the first year of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. might  be  described  as  the   year   of\r\n\r\nexcitement,  and the second year as  the  year  of\r\n\r\nconfusion.

The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders  have  now  thrown  overboard  all   their\r\n\r\ncarefully   planned  and  thought   out   election\r\n\r\nprogramme. They are only interested in  trying  to\r\n\r\nkeep  afloat their fast sinking ship.  Next  year,\r\n\r\nfrom what the Member for Mountbatten has asked,  I\r\n\r\ndoubt  if  the P.A.P. will still be here then.  So\r\n\r\nthere is no need to talk about next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, minus the parts of the speech touching on\r\n\r\nmerger,  there  is  really nothing  in  the  policy\r\n\r\nstatement  that merits serious consideration.  They\r\n\r\nare  more  like the departmental reports  from  the\r\n\r\nvarious  Government Ministries; dry  and  insipid,\r\n\r\nand  it  looks as though the P.A.P. this  time  has\r\n\r\nmerely  taken  out pages here and  there  from  the\r\n\r\nvarious   departmental  reports  and   bound   them\r\n\r\ntogether  as their policy statement. For  instance,\r\n\r\nin  col. 15 of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech,\r\n\r\nat the end of the first paragraph, it says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Water rationing will be lifted when the rainy\r\n\r\nseason breaks and the reservoirs are filled.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What  is  there  so informative about  that  little\r\n\r\nstatement?

It  is\r\n\r\neasier  now  to  get  immigration  permits   for\r\n\r\nrelatives  from abroad - thanks to representatives\r\n\r\nfrom  Barisan  Sosialis Assemblymen  and  branch\r\n\r\nexecutives. Various other small favours are  now\r\n\r\ngranted with a view to buying votes. Hence,  the\r\n\r\nrestoration  of paycuts and increase  of  social\r\n\r\nwelfare  benefits  for the  various  unfortunate\r\n\r\nmembers  of  our society. Sir, these concessions\r\n\r\nare correct and should have been given long ago.\r\n\r\nEverybody  knows that the change  in  Government\r\n\r\npolicy is motivated not by any sincere intention\r\n\r\nto  relieve  the  suffering of  the  people  but\r\n\r\nsimply  to buy votes. Sir, the people  have  not\r\n\r\nforgotten  that  only  a  few  months  ago   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance firmly refused  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  a  full restoration of their  allowance\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the supposed need for  a  stringent\r\n\r\neconomic plan. Now when the Government is  about\r\n\r\nto  topple, it suddenly has plenty of  money  to\r\n\r\nthrow  around.

The greater part of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated, because of the vicious falsehood\r\n\r\nand  smear campaign by the S.P.A. and the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes,  was  led to believe that when  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncame  to  power  they  would have  their  properly\r\n\r\nconfiscated, their rice bowl broken and all  would\r\n\r\nbe   forced  to  live  in  communes.

Sir,\r\n\r\nnever  in  my reading of socialism have  I  learnt\r\n\r\nthat  socialism can be achieved by  insulting  and\r\n\r\nintimidating sections of the people into accepting\r\n\r\nsocialist  thinking. Indeed, we must  be  able  to\r\n\r\nunderstand why certain sections of our people  are\r\n\r\napprehensive about socialism. It is  our  duty  as\r\n\r\nsocialists to try and explain away these fears and\r\n\r\nmisunderstandings. Only thus will all  the  people\r\n\r\nparticipate willingly and actively in  our  sacred\r\n\r\ntask  of  improving  the  livelihood  of  all  our\r\n\r\npeople.  Insults and intimidation will only  drive\r\n\r\nthose who do not understand socialism further away\r\n\r\nfrom our movement. We are happy to note, Sir, that\r\n\r\ntoday the English-educated worker is becoming more\r\n\r\nand  more politically conscious. The recent strike\r\n\r\nat  Robinson's shows that our English-educated are\r\n\r\nno  longer  spineless and soft.

It  is  clear,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government has abandoned  its  election\r\n\r\npromises to unify the trade union movement.  There\r\n\r\nis  no  mention  at  all of  this  in  the  policy\r\n\r\nstatement.   Today  the  Government  has   clearly\r\n\r\ndivided  the workers into two camps, those  unions\r\n\r\nwhich  are sponsored or controlled by the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nand  those which are not prepared to be tied  down\r\n\r\nto  the P.A.P. The Government has styled all those\r\n\r\nworkers  under P.A.P. control as nationalists  and\r\n\r\nsmeared  all  those who refuse to be under  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncontrol  as  pro-Communist.  By  this  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhopes  that  the workers will be frightened  into\r\n\r\naccepting  P.A.P. control. Sir, this is really  an\r\n\r\ninsult   to  the  intelligence  of  the   workers,\r\n\r\nbecause  every  worker knows, for  example,  about\r\n\r\nA.U.P.E.,  a  Government-sponsored splinter  union\r\n\r\nwhich  featured prominently in the  recent  Public\r\n\r\nDaily-Rated  Workers strike.  Every  worker  knows\r\n\r\nthat   it  was  the  Government's  insistence   on\r\n\r\nfoisting   upon   the  workers  this   Government-sponsored  union that had sparked off the  strike,\r\n\r\nin  spite  of  all  that the Government  has  said\r\n\r\nabout  the  evil men behind the scenes.  Sir,  all\r\n\r\nthis  talk of the P.A.P. wanting to spend millions\r\n\r\nof  dollars to build a trade union centre  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to deceive the people about the anti-worker\r\n\r\nattitude of the Government today. In the light  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  labour  policy  of  divide  and\r\n\r\nrule,  this extensive building may well  turn  out\r\n\r\nto be a mere white elephant.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards unemployment, the situation today is\r\n\r\njust  as  bad as ever.

Instead, Sir, today the P.A.P. uses  the\r\n\r\npolice  and  armed troops against the workers.  We\r\n\r\nhave  seen  how  the  City  Council  workers  were\r\n\r\nbullied  by  the use of brute military  force.  We\r\n\r\nhave  seen  how simple street cleaning was  turned\r\n\r\ninto  major political operations. There were  more\r\n\r\ntroops\r\n\r\nthan black-legs in each operation.

Government are  merely\r\n\r\nattempts  to terrorise and intimidate the  workers\r\n\r\nof  Singapore,  but  workers  are  not  so  easily\r\n\r\nterrorised  and intimidated these  days.  Let  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  realise  that.  It  is  indeed\r\n\r\nironical, Sir, that it should be a Government that\r\n\r\nwas  elected to power by the workers of  Singapore\r\n\r\nthat  is  now using troops and the police  against\r\n\r\nthe workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Ask the people's democracy!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, I doubt - there are very\r\n\r\nfew  Back-benches left anyway - if the P.A.P.

I do not wish to comment  on  the\r\n\r\nmerits  and  demerits of the education policy.  We\r\n\r\nwelcome  the  establishment  of  a  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  to  investigate into all aspects  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment education policy, including the English\r\n\r\nstream  of education, as has been promised by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education. But  I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to use this opportunity to  allow  all\r\n\r\nteachers  in Singapore to air their genuine  grievances.  The  question of a unified service  scheme\r\n\r\nfor   teachers   long  promised  by   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment has still to be met. Let the Government\r\n\r\nremember  that  for  the attainment  of  the  best\r\n\r\npossible  education results for  our  children,  a\r\n\r\nsatisfied  and  contented body of teachers  is  an\r\n\r\nessential prerequisite. Let the Government  handle\r\n\r\nthis  matter  with  tolerance,  understanding  and\r\n\r\npatience  and  not  with the usual  arrogance  and\r\n\r\nhaughtiness,  the  outstanding  qualifies   widely\r\n\r\nassociated with the Ministry of Education today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is regrettable, Sir, that this year the P.A.P.\r\n\r\npolicy statement completely omitted any mention of\r\n\r\nits professed policy to help the Malays.

We congratulate the Government on their\r\n\r\nhaving  built the first Malay Secondary School  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  a  Fisheries Training  School  for\r\n\r\nfishermen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Thank you.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But these, Sir, are not\r\n\r\nenough.

Let\r\n\r\nthem not play politics too much.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also pursuing a very dangerous\r\n\r\ncommunal  policy  as  regards  many  things,   but\r\n\r\nespecially  as  regards,  as  has  been  evidenced\r\n\r\nrecently, the Work Brigade. Soon after the\r\n\r\nworkers  of the Work Brigade had tried to  form  a\r\n\r\ntrade  union,  the Government had  segregated  the\r\n\r\nMalay  workers from the non-Malay workers  in  the\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade camps. We cannot see why the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment,  which  is  supposed  to  believe   in\r\n\r\ncommunal unity and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nharmony,   should   want  to   practise   communal\r\n\r\nsegregation.

But let us see  what\r\n\r\nhas  happened  in  these  two  years.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  could only build one  Malay  secondary\r\n\r\nschool,  namely, Sangnila Utama Malay School,  and\r\n\r\nanother  Chinese  School, namely, Whampoa  Chinese\r\n\r\nSecondary  School.  They  could  only  build  four\r\n\r\nChinese   middle  schools  namely,  River   Valley\r\n\r\nSchool, Teck Min School and two others. From  this\r\n\r\nwe  can  see that the Government is biased towards\r\n\r\nEnglish  education.  The integrated  schools  have\r\n\r\nbeen said to be very successful, according to  the\r\n\r\npolicy  statement.  I  doubt  this  because  these\r\n\r\nintegrated  schools  are mainly  English  schools.\r\n\r\nBefore  these  schools  were  opened,  they   were\r\n\r\nchiefly  English  schools. Later  on,  because  of\r\n\r\nother  reasons,  they  became integrated  schools.\r\n\r\nBecause there were vacant classes and most of  the\r\n\r\nclasses were meant for the teaching of English - \r\n\r\ntwo-thirds  of  them  for  the  English  stream - the\r\n\r\nbalance   was   allotted   to   other   vernacular\r\n\r\nlanguages.  The  facilities  in  all  schools  are\r\n\r\nmainly  meant  for English schools. Other  classes\r\n\r\nfor   vernacular  education  are  only  meant   as\r\n\r\nsupplementary classes and the use of these classes\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  depend  on from  which  stream  of\r\n\r\neducation the principal comes. Among the  students\r\n\r\nsome of them have to express their opinions in the\r\n\r\nvernacular languages in these integrated  schools.\r\n\r\nCan  this  be  claimed to be successful?  Is  this\r\n\r\npolicy really conducive to the so-called promoting\r\n\r\nthe   mutual   understanding  among  the   various\r\n\r\nlanguage streams? The Government has built about 9\r\n\r\nschools -  The $3 million spent last time  has  now\r\n\r\nbeen  increased to $9 million and it is  spent  on\r\n\r\nbuilding  a  few  schools. They have  promised  to\r\n\r\nbuild 19 schools. The\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsum  spent  on capital expenditure, i.e.,  building\r\n\r\nschools, last time was $3 million; but now  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  reduced  to  $1  million,  one-third  of  the\r\n\r\namount. Most of the schools are English schools and\r\n\r\nmost  of  the Chinese schools are Government  aided\r\n\r\nschools.  From  this we can see  that  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools  cannot develop smoothly and  that  is  the\r\n\r\nmain   reason.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  apply  for  school  building  funds.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  has  hampered  the  development  of\r\n\r\nChinese  schools. When a school wants to apply  for\r\n\r\nexpansion  of the school building, it  has  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough the Ministry of Education, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth,  and  the Ministry of National Development.\r\n\r\nVery  often  certain officers in  these  Ministries\r\n\r\nshift  the burden to other Ministries, evading  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  in dealing with applications.  Thus\r\n\r\napplications   are  delayed  for  several   months,\r\n\r\nsometimes  for  several years.  For  instance,  the\r\n\r\napplication for the building of Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nand the application relating to school expansion in\r\n\r\nChung  Cheng High School. These are good  examples.\r\n\r\nThe   procedure  has  not  been  explained  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to the schools. So the schools  applying\r\n\r\nfor capital grant, because they have not applied in\r\n\r\naccordance with the regulations, have not been able\r\n\r\nto  get  the grant. For instance, Kwong  Yong  High\r\n\r\nSchool could not get any grant. It put the Board of\r\n\r\nDirectors  in  a  difficult  position  because  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health demanded too much of the  school\r\n\r\nwithout   considering  its  special  and   economic\r\n\r\nconditions.  The Ministry concerned  insisted  that\r\n\r\nthe  site  should  be large, the  space  should  be\r\n\r\nample,  and  there  should  be  certain  kinds   of\r\n\r\nconditions applicable to sanitary facilities and so on and so\r\n\r\nforth. How could the applicant school afford to pay so much? When a school\r\n\r\nbuilding plan is given to the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Health, the Ministry not only entirely changes\r\n\r\nit, but very often certain structures already put up have to be\r\n\r\nadded in, such as window, ceilings and\r\n\r\nso on, thereby putting unnecessary restrictions on the applicant school and\r\n\r\ncausing much trouble to the Board of\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nDirectors.  The Ministry also insist on  the  land\r\n\r\nlease to be 30 years minimum, instead of 30 years.\r\n\r\nBut  then the Government, on the other hand, would\r\n\r\nnot grant a lease for 30 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way how can the Government help the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of vernacular schools? I suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe   Government   should   establish   a   special\r\n\r\ndepartment  to  deal with these matters  so  as  to\r\n\r\nenable  the  applicant schools to facilitate  their\r\n\r\napplications  and  so that they  can  approach  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  quarters  and realise their  aims  early.\r\n\r\nThe  Government should provide these facilities and\r\n\r\nassistance   so   that  the  Chinese   schools   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  can  shoulder  their  responsibility  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of education in their educational  stream.\r\n\r\nIn  this  way the Government can achieve what  they\r\n\r\nprofess  to do, namely, to give equal treatment  to\r\n\r\nthe   four  streams  of  education,  including  the\r\n\r\nChinese stream.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that in the Ministry of Education there\r\n\r\nis  already established an Examination Syndicate to\r\n\r\nmanage  and  control  matters  relating  to  common\r\n\r\nexaminations  in  all standards. It  is  not  known\r\n\r\nwhen  the  present  examination system,  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  conducting colonial examinations,  is  to  be\r\n\r\nabolished,  and  when the Government  is  going  to\r\n\r\nconduct  examinations  for  secondary  schools  and\r\n\r\nhigher  secondary  schools.  Everybody  knows   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  been saying that the  contents  of\r\n\r\nthe   textbooks  should  be  based  on  a   Malayan\r\n\r\nbackground.    But   if   the   Senior    Cambridge\r\n\r\nExamination   and  the  Higher  School  Certificate\r\n\r\nExamination  are not abolished, then  this  is  not\r\n\r\nquite   correct,  because  the  contents   of   the\r\n\r\ntextbooks used for these examinations are  colonial\r\n\r\nin  nature. The Government says they want to  unify\r\n\r\nthe  contents  of all textbooks in all  educational\r\n\r\nstreams,  but  there  are  still  contents   of   a\r\n\r\ncolonial nature in the textbooks. How then can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   achieve  the  purpose   of   promoting\r\n\r\nMalayan  culture  and achieve  a  Malayan  type  of\r\n\r\neducation!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About technical education, I am not satisfied\r\n\r\nwith  what the Government has done because it  has\r\n\r\nonly established\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntechnical  classes in the secondary schools.

Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  there  are  about 8,000 graduates  from  the\r\n\r\nChinese   secondary  schools  this   year;   5,000\r\n\r\nSecondary  III  graduates and 3,000  Secondary  IV\r\n\r\ngraduates. Next year a few will be able to  go  to\r\n\r\nthe    Upper   Secondary   classes   or   to   the\r\n\r\nUniversities.   There  is  no   other   employment\r\n\r\nopportunity  for them except to be  teachers.  How\r\n\r\nmany graduates can be absorbed into the Government\r\n\r\nservice!  The  Government should open  a  two-year\r\n\r\nteacher  training course to absorb  the  graduates\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Chinese secondary schools so that  they\r\n\r\nwill  not be unemployed. It should also set  up  a\r\n\r\ndepartment in the Polytechnic in which the  medium\r\n\r\nof  instruction should be Chinese  to  enable  the\r\n\r\nChinese  school students to receive some technical\r\n\r\ntraining.  This  is  the  demand  of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nparents and the school committee members.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Government will put into practice the  demand\r\n\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Adult Education\r\n\r\nBoard  was formed in April 1960. There were  about\r\n\r\n21,000  students.  But in July  1960,  there  were\r\n\r\nabout  17,400 students. We do not know the  number\r\n\r\nof students in 1961 because the Government has not\r\n\r\nannounced the number. Perhaps the number has been\r\n\r\nreduced  still further. It is said that there  are\r\n\r\nnow a few students in certain classes. In order to\r\n\r\nhave  enough  classes, the teachers in  the  adult\r\n\r\neducation classes have asked the pupils in\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  day  schools  to augment  the  number  in  the\r\n\r\nclasses  so  as to falsify the number of  students.\r\n\r\nAs  the number of pupils are so few in the classes,\r\n\r\nthe  teachers  are naturally very  slack  in  their\r\n\r\nwork.  How then are we going to wipe out illiteracy\r\n\r\nif  we  organise such classes? On the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  does not dare to  co-operate  with\r\n\r\nthe  civic  organisations and, as a  result,  these\r\n\r\norganisations run better classes than those run  by\r\n\r\nthe  Adult Education Board. This should be reviewed\r\n\r\nby the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let us review the work\r\n\r\ndone  by  the  Ministry  of  Culture.  It  can   be\r\n\r\nsummarised   in  eight  words - \"It  is   meant   for\r\n\r\ndecoration  and  show only.\" Let  us  see  how  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture whitewashes  its  work.  Last\r\n\r\nyear  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara in his speech  to\r\n\r\nthis  House pointed out that in order to  stimulate\r\n\r\nMalayan  art  and  culture  the  Government   would\r\n\r\nestablish  a national cultural brigade.  When  this\r\n\r\nscheme  is  implemented, it will  provide  a  fixed\r\n\r\nvenue for cultural activities. This is a very  good\r\n\r\nscheme.  The  ex-Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Culture gave details about  the  work\r\n\r\nof  this cultural brigade at a meeting last year in\r\n\r\nthe  belief that this project would be carried out.\r\n\r\nHe  said  that if we were to carry out  this  heavy\r\n\r\nwork,  we  must  absorb talented  and  hard-working\r\n\r\nartistes  into the cultural brigade and organise  a\r\n\r\nsystematic  research in art and creative  work.  He\r\n\r\nalso  spoke on the problem of organisation. He said\r\n\r\nthat,  on the whole, the cultural brigade would  be\r\n\r\ndivided  into  two groups. One group would  consist\r\n\r\nof  those  with a higher intellectual  ability  and\r\n\r\nthey  would  be  entrusted with the compilation  of\r\n\r\nartistic  works  such as songs,  dances  and  other\r\n\r\ncultural  activities and then, after some research,\r\n\r\nwith  the  production of Malayan music,  drama  and\r\n\r\ndances.  The  other group would  consist  of  those\r\n\r\ntalented  as  performers, for  example,  musicians,\r\n\r\ndancers,  singers and dramatists. These  performers\r\n\r\nwould  take  part  in open-air concerts  and  would\r\n\r\nassist  in the cultural and recreational activities\r\n\r\nof the community centres. It seemed that\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Culture wanted to gather all the\r\n\r\ntalented  people and artistes and give them  scope\r\n\r\nto express their artistic talents. But, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, after a lapse of 14 months now,  has\r\n\r\nthe  cultural brigade been formed? What songs have\r\n\r\nbeen  written and what dances have been  arranged?\r\n\r\nHow  many  artistes  have been  recruited?  I  can\r\n\r\nanswer  these  questions  for  the  Minister.  The\r\n\r\nanswer  is  that all these plans have been  thrown\r\n\r\ninto  the wastepaper basket.

The\r\n\r\naims and objects of the Institute\r\n\r\nhave  already  been explained to  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly. The Institute, in addition to publishing\r\n\r\ntranslations  of outstanding works  of  literature\r\n\r\nand promoting the growth and\r\n\r\nspread   of  the  national  language,  will   also\r\n\r\nencourage original works, literary and scientific,\r\n\r\nby local writers.'.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is very significant.\r\n\r\nWhen  tabling  the  Bill  on  the  Institute   for\r\n\r\nNational   Language   and   Culture,    the    ex-Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nCulture  said  that  the P.A.P. would  pay  great\r\n\r\nattention   to   the   establishment    of    this\r\n\r\ninstitution.  I  would like to  summarise  briefly\r\n\r\nwhat  he said.

This grandiose scheme  was\r\n\r\ndescribed  by  him in this House on  11th  August, 1960.  He  said that he would bring good  news  to\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore on the establishment  of\r\n\r\nthe  Institute for National Language and  Culture.\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, through the  assistance\r\n\r\nof  the  Indonesian Government,  Professor  Sulamo\r\n\r\nwas  recruited by the Singapore Government and  he\r\n\r\nis  the  Director  of the Institute  for  National\r\n\r\nLanguage   and  Culture.  I  believe  the   famous\r\n\r\nProfessor  Sulamo  will run  the  Institute  well.\r\n\r\nHowever,  Mr Deputy Speaker, we have so  far  not\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  see any publications published  by\r\n\r\nthat  institute or any textbooks in  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage. Translations of these works are  not  to\r\n\r\nbe  found  in  the bookshops. Is  it  because  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance did not give money or  is  it\r\n\r\nbecause of the shortage of personnel? It was  said\r\n\r\nthat  when Prof. Sulamo was appointed, he did  not\r\n\r\neven have typists and cupboards in his office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in the policy speech\r\n\r\ndelivered  by  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  last\r\n\r\nyear,    the   Government   boasted   about    the\r\n\r\nachievements   of  the  Government's  construction\r\n\r\nwork.  Not a word was mentioned about the work  in\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  of  Culture.  Is  it  because  the\r\n\r\nrevolution has not been successful? If it  is  so,\r\n\r\nthe  Government should tell the people. Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  in  the  past one  year  this  so-called\r\n\r\ncultural  revolution  by the Ministry  of  Culture\r\n\r\nwas  nonsense. There was no system  at  all.  Last\r\n\r\nyear the cultural brigade and\r\n\r\nthe  Institute  for Language and Culture  did  not\r\n\r\nachieve  anything. This year they  say  they  will\r\n\r\nput  up  television.

But according to the  work\r\n\r\ndone  last  year  we can see that  the  Government\r\n\r\nintends  to suppress the formation of Malayan  culture  and consciousness. From this we can see that\r\n\r\nthe T.V. plan will not be successful. But when one\r\n\r\ntalks  about  T.V., it is not so  very  simple  a\r\n\r\nmatter.  I think T.V. programmes will be  prepared\r\n\r\nin  time unless the P.A.P. Government collapses in\r\n\r\nthe near future; otherwise the Government will not\r\n\r\ngive up the plan to build a T.V. station. If it is\r\n\r\nso,  then  the question is not so simple.  Let  us\r\n\r\nstudy it. What is the motive of the Government  in\r\n\r\npromoting mass education? Everybody knows, and the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership also knows, that the P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nat  present faced with a very difficult situation.\r\n\r\nIt  has  its  back  to the wall,  because  it  has\r\n\r\nbetrayed the people\r\n\r\nand has no courage to face them. It has no courage\r\n\r\nto express the strength of the people and has lost\r\n\r\nthe  support of the people. Therefore,  in  future\r\n\r\nthere  will be no masses appearing at mass rallies\r\n\r\nor street comer meetings or large-scale\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmeetings.  The only people who want to attend  will\r\n\r\nonly  be a few pickets and it is likely that  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  no  pickets  at all when  they  hold  any\r\n\r\nmeeting.  It  will be just like one of those  minor\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties in 1955. It will  have  to  show\r\n\r\nsome kind of films and play some music in order  to\r\n\r\nattract people to attend its meetings. In the  past\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. has been attacking others and  accusing\r\n\r\nthem  of many faults. Now it is doing the same.  It\r\n\r\nis  very  difficult for them to explain away  this.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Mr Deputy Speaker, the leadership  of\r\n\r\nthe  people have now thought out a very cunning way\r\n\r\nto  go round it. They have thought out a T.V. plan.\r\n\r\nThen   in   all   the   community   centres,    the\r\n\r\nplaygrounds, shops, houses, everywhere,  T.V. sets\r\n\r\ncan  be set up, and the Government will be able  to\r\n\r\ncontact  the  people through television  programmes\r\n\r\nand  to  conduct their mass rallies. By  that  time\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister can come on to  the  stage  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  his mystic stories. The people  will  not\r\n\r\nonly  be  able  to  hear the  voice  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  but  will  also be able  to  see  him  in\r\n\r\nperson.  All  his  acts and gestures  can  be  seen\r\n\r\nclearly  on the screen. This will be of quite  good\r\n\r\nuse to the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways in which they could help the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  First, it will get them out of a situation\r\n\r\nif  they should convene any meeting and nobody  at\r\n\r\ntends. Secondly, perhaps they may still say  there\r\n\r\nare  650,000  citizens attending the  P.A.P. mass\r\n\r\nrally  and there is applause all round.  They  can\r\n\r\nclaim  that  the people have been supporting  them\r\n\r\nand  they can cherish this spirit of Ah Q.

I\r\n\r\nshould like to take this opportunity to answer  the\r\n\r\nmain  points  raised by them as far as possible  on\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the point raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nStamford on Tuesday when discussing the question of\r\n\r\nwomen's  rights. She referred to cases  of  certain\r\n\r\nChinese   married  women  teachers  who  paid   for\r\n\r\nsubstitutes  out  of their own pocket  before  they\r\n\r\nwent  on  maternity leave. It would seem from  what\r\n\r\nshe  said that the teachers concerned entered  into\r\n\r\nthis arrangement voluntarily. I mean it is a matter\r\n\r\nbetween  the  individual  teacher  and  the  school\r\n\r\nauthorities.  I  would like  to  explain,  for  the\r\n\r\ninformation  of all concerned, that  married  women\r\n\r\nteachers,  whether in Government service  or  aided\r\n\r\nschools, are eligible for maternity leave up  to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  of 60 days upon certification by a doctor.\r\n\r\nWhile  the  married woman teacher's  on  maternity\r\n\r\nleave,  the  school is expected  to  make  internal\r\n\r\narrangements  to cover her work, but such  internal\r\n\r\narrangements neither require the teacher to find  a\r\n\r\nsubstitute nor to pay for the substitute. But  when\r\n\r\ntoo  many women teachers are away on medical  leave\r\n\r\nin  the  same  school or when the  absence  of  any\r\n\r\nteacher  during  maternity leave  is  unnecessarily\r\n\r\nprolonged,  the Director of Education has  his  discretion to consider and approve the appointment and\r\n\r\npayment of substitute teachers provided always such\r\n\r\nappointment is essential for the proper running  of\r\n\r\nthe school. It is therefore clear, Sir,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom  what  I have said, that the cases mentioned\r\n\r\nby  the Member for Stamford are not authorised by\r\n\r\nmy   Ministry.  We  cannot  interfere  with  the\r\n\r\nteachers'  desire  to enter  into  any  voluntary\r\n\r\narrangement with their own school. But I  hope  I\r\n\r\nhave  made  it  plain that it is unnecessary  for\r\n\r\nmarried  women teachers to make such arrangements\r\n\r\nas  they  are entitled to maternity leave without\r\n\r\nhaving to find substitutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the Member for Pasir Panjang, it\r\n\r\nis quite a change to find him changing from being\r\n\r\nthe vanguard of Chinese education to stand up  in\r\n\r\ndefence of Tamil education. The Member for  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang  referred to the case of  the  Government\r\n\r\nhaving built Labrador School on the playing field\r\n\r\nof  Pasir  Panjang Tamil School,  thus  depriving\r\n\r\nthem of the use of a playing field. I assure  him\r\n\r\nthat  he  has been misinformed - they  are  always\r\n\r\nmisinformed unfortunately. Although Pasir Panjang\r\n\r\nTamil  Aided  School  is  occupying  State  land,\r\n\r\nLabrador  School was built outside the  perimeter\r\n\r\nfence  of the Tamil School. Only a small  portion\r\n\r\nof   the  Tamil  school  compound  was  used  for\r\n\r\nconstructing an approach road Ro Labrador School.\r\n\r\nThe   Tamil  school  building  itself  is  in   a\r\n\r\ndilapidated condition and provision has been made\r\n\r\nto  offer  them accommodation in the new Labrador\r\n\r\nSchool  building. In addition, the  Tamil  school\r\n\r\npupils  are  being  offered  use  of  the  common\r\n\r\nplaying  field for Labrador/Batu Berlayer Primary\r\n\r\nSchools and the Pasir Panjang Secondary Schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately the Member for Changi is not here,\r\n\r\nbut   he  did  raise  the  matter  about  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.  I think it is necessary  for  me  to\r\n\r\nrefer  to it somewhat in detail. Members  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis follow the regular  pattern  of\r\n\r\nlifting  sentences  out of  context  from  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nliterature  or statements and give them  a  twist\r\n\r\nand  distortion  where  such  interpretation   or\r\n\r\nintention  is not intended. The false  allegation\r\n\r\nhas  been  made  by the Barisan Sosialis  Members\r\n\r\nthat  we  have failed to uphold our election  promise to give financial aid to Nanyang University.\r\n\r\nThe relevant paragraph on\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNanyang   University  in  the   education   policy\r\n\r\nstatement made by us in April 1959, more  than  2\u00bd\r\n\r\nyears ago, reads as follows [The Tasks Ahead, Part 2, page 11]:\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The University [i.e. Nanyang University],\r\n\r\nhowever, does not officially exist, in the eyes of\r\n\r\nthe Federation government, although 60 per cent of\r\n\r\nits  students are from the Federation. Until there\r\n\r\nis  a  change  of  heart in  the  Federation,  any\r\n\r\ngovernment  grants to the Nanyang University  must\r\n\r\ntherefore   come   solely   from   the   Singapore\r\n\r\ngovernment.  To have two governments  support  two\r\n\r\nUniversities  is  obviously easier  than  for  one\r\n\r\ngovernment  to support two Universities.  The  out\r\n\r\nlook  actually  would appear to  be  that  if  the\r\n\r\npolitical  separation between  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation    continues,   then   the    Singapore\r\n\r\ngovernment  will be faced with the  responsibility\r\n\r\nof   supporting  the  University  of   Malaya   in\r\n\r\nSingapore   and  the  Nanyang  University.   Faced\r\n\r\nalready with an education bill amounting to 25 per\r\n\r\ncent of its budget and an increasing population of\r\n\r\nyoung  children, the prospects of  supporting  two\r\n\r\nuniversities may well strain the resources of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore government to the limit.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position today remains unchanged. Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  is not wholly for Singapore  students.\r\n\r\nAs  stated, the Federation students form about  60\r\n\r\nper cent of enrolment in Nanyang. Now, whereas the\r\n\r\nFederation Government is prepared to reimburse the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government to the sum of $4 million  for\r\n\r\nFederation students who will attend the University\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  next year, it is  not  prepared  to\r\n\r\nconsider the existence of Nanyang University. That\r\n\r\nis the problem to be resolved. Who is to carry the\r\n\r\nfinancial  responsibility for 60 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents in Nanyang who come from the Federation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The Member  for\r\n\r\nChangi made passing reference as to why, whereas\r\n\r\nthe non-English medium schools have English as a\r\n\r\ncompulsory subject in\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nschools, in English schools the students  are  not\r\n\r\ncompelled  to  study  Asian languages  like  Malay,\r\n\r\nChinese  and  Tamil. That is exactly what  the  Government  intends to do. We realise that the English\r\n\r\nmedium   schools  in  the  past  was  unfortunately\r\n\r\nconcentrating  far too much on the use  of  English\r\n\r\nalone.  That is why the English schools  have  been\r\n\r\non  a  six-day week to give the students more  time\r\n\r\nto  learn the Asian languages. But we cannot do  it\r\n\r\novernight.  Even though we have accepted  Malay  as\r\n\r\nthe  national  language,  there  is  a  paucity  of\r\n\r\nteachers  to teach the language. We are  not  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  insist that Malay  should  be  taught\r\n\r\ncompulsorily, otherwise  we  would have 370,000 children  wanting  to\r\n\r\nlearn  Malay  and we have only 600 teachers.  There\r\n\r\nare  not enough Malay teachers even to teach in the\r\n\r\nMalay  stream. We have started secondary  education\r\n\r\nin  the  Malay  stream and we find it difficult  to\r\n\r\nget  the  right  teachers. So it is useless  asking\r\n\r\nwhy  we  do  not make it a compulsory  subject.  We\r\n\r\nintend to. But the time must be given to train  the\r\n\r\nteachers  to  be  adequate in such  languages.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  in  conducting the Common Primary  School\r\n\r\nLeaving Examination in the four streams, we have  a\r\n\r\nsituation  where it is possible for  students  from\r\n\r\nthe   Chinese  medium  schools  to  take  a  second\r\n\r\nlanguage  paper other than the language  medium  of\r\n\r\ninstruction,  that  is  English,  but  it  is   not\r\n\r\npossible  to  insist on the other language  streams\r\n\r\nto  take  a  second language because  in  the  past\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  rather indifferent attitude  towards\r\n\r\nthe  study  of such second languages. Yet  we  have\r\n\r\nindicated  that  next year a second language  paper\r\n\r\nfor  the  four streams will have what is  called  a\r\n\r\nhalf-unit.  We  will  take  it  into  account   for\r\n\r\nexamination purposes, and by 1963, we will  have  a\r\n\r\nfull  unit. First we must give some time  for  this\r\n\r\nto  come into operation. We are hoping to introduce\r\n\r\na  regulation  whereby we will  insist  that  if  a\r\n\r\nPrimary   VI  student  has  had  three   years   of\r\n\r\ncontinuous learning of a second language,  then  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  compulsory  for him to  take  the  second\r\n\r\nlanguage  paper. But I think we have made  attempts\r\n\r\ntowards remedying a previous defect.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Toa Payoh picked out a little\r\n\r\nsentence - he  seems to be a protagonist for  farmers\r\n\r\nin  the  rural areas - that somewhere in  our  policy\r\n\r\nstatement  we  have indicated that the  farmers  in\r\n\r\nlarge rural areas should be given some education to\r\n\r\nhelp  them  in their rural life. He also said  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government had done nothing about it and  that\r\n\r\nthe  teachers  in  the rural schools  should  know.\r\n\r\nWell,  Sir,  we  have  appointed  a  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  into  Vocational and Technical  Education.\r\n\r\nThe  Government just does not go \"bang\"  and  introduce  things  off the cuff. We believe  in  getting\r\n\r\npeople  who are experts in education to  sit  down,\r\n\r\nmake   a  close  study  of  the  subject  and  make\r\n\r\nrecommendations,  and  then  Government  will  give\r\n\r\nthought  to  whether  the  recommendations  can  or\r\n\r\ncannot  be accepted. Well, this Report has  already\r\n\r\nbeen  tabled  and,  as I said,  a  White  Paper  is\r\n\r\nforthcoming. There is a recommendation here by  the\r\n\r\nCommission  of Inquiry at the top of the  paragraph\r\n\r\non page 23 which says:\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In the primary schools, syllabuses could be\r\n\r\nmodified  to take account of the particular  needs\r\n\r\nof rural children, and of those urban children who\r\n\r\nwill eventually enter careers\r\n\r\ninvolving also the use of their hands.'.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have done something and in the right way - not\r\n\r\nby  just  picking out sentences here and there  and\r\n\r\nnot being able to follow them through.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My former Parliamentary Secretary, the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon Gardens, lamented the fact that  students\r\n\r\nfrom the two Chinese secondary schools, Dunman  and\r\n\r\nHwa Yi, had to waste a lot of time moving over  to\r\n\r\nthe Tanjong Katong and Queenstown secondary schools\r\n\r\nto  pick up some technical secondary education.  It\r\n\r\nis  quite  a  change, Sir, to see the  Member,  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Gardens  saying  so  many  things  about\r\n\r\neducation.  When he was my Parliamentary Secretary,\r\n\r\nhe  was well known for his silence. If only he  had\r\n\r\nall  these ideas when he was assisting me  for  the\r\n\r\nlast  two  years,  we  could have  done  something.\r\n\r\nHowever,  here  again, I would  refer  him  to  the\r\n\r\nReport of the Commission of Inquiry into Vocational\r\n\r\nand  Technical  Education. The recommendations  are\r\n\r\nbeing  considered  and  when  the  White  Paper  is\r\n\r\npublished, perhaps I would like to know what he has\r\n\r\nto say\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthen  on the subject. Because of the existence  of\r\n\r\nthis  Report, we have not pushed forward our plans.\r\n\r\nAfter  all, there is an expert Report in hand,  and\r\n\r\nwe  may as well make use of the brains of those who\r\n\r\nproduced  the Report before involving the State  in\r\n\r\nexpenditure of millions of dollars. It  would  cost\r\n\r\nat  least  $1  million to build  a  good  secondary\r\n\r\ntechnical  school  and  to equip  it  properly.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the Report recommends the Government not  to\r\n\r\ngo too fast about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come next to the criticism lodged by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Toa  Payoh  and  by  my  former  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary,  the Member for Serangoon Gardens,  over\r\n\r\nthe  lack  of  liaison between the Adult  Education\r\n\r\nBoard  and  other organisations like  trade  unions\r\n\r\nand  so  on, and that therefore the Adult Education\r\n\r\nBoard  is failing to give that drive to get  pupils\r\n\r\nto  burn  the midnight oil. In the Constitution  of\r\n\r\nthe  Adult Education Board, there is provision  for\r\n\r\ntwo  representatives  from  the  trade  unions.  In\r\n\r\nfact,   the   Secretary-General   of   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  Mr  Lim  Ching Siong,  and  one  of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  the  Member for Ulu Pandan,  serve  on\r\n\r\nthe Board but unfortunately Mr Lim Ching Siong  is\r\n\r\nnoted  for his absence from meetings. So, far  from\r\n\r\ngetting  co-operation, we got little, if  any,  co-operation  by  his lack of attendance.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nwith  the  politics  that  went  on  and  with  the\r\n\r\ndissolution  of the T.U.C., they are no  longer  on\r\n\r\nthe   Board.   But   we   do   hope   that   proper\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  real  trade  unions  and   not\r\n\r\npoliticians   will   come   in   to   support   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criticism again was lodged by the Member for\r\n\r\nChangi  and the Member for Serangoon Gardens  about\r\n\r\nthe  continuance  of the Cambridge  Examination  in\r\n\r\nEnglish  as something that is colonial. I  like  to\r\n\r\nhear  the strong anti-colonial fervour of our great\r\n\r\nanti-colonialists as expressed by  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis! We have it as  an  objective  in\r\n\r\nour  education policy statement that we should have\r\n\r\nan  Examination  Syndicate. It is something  to  be\r\n\r\nachieved.   But  let  us  not  fool  ourselves   by\r\n\r\nthrowing  things to the winds. After  all,  we  are\r\n\r\nvery  much  tied up with the Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nwith whom we are to merge, and the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nFederation   Government   conducts   its    public\r\n\r\nexaminations closely with the Cambridge Syndicate.\r\n\r\nWe  are also using the Cambridge Syndicate for the\r\n\r\nconduct  of  our  English medium examinations  and\r\n\r\nmany  Singapore  students,  after  obtaining   the\r\n\r\nCambridge  School  Certificate  or  the  Cambridge\r\n\r\nHigher  School  Certificate,  will  have  to  find\r\n\r\nemployment  in the Federation or seek  entry  into\r\n\r\nthe  new  University of Malaya at Kuala Lumpur  to\r\n\r\ntake up engineering and agriculture, or to proceed\r\n\r\noverseas  anywhere in the world because  they  are\r\n\r\ncertificates  known to anyone as  certificates  of\r\n\r\nrecognition to Universities abroad. Now we do  not\r\n\r\njust tear it all up in order to comply with the so-called   anti-colonial  fervour  of  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. We will do it if we can be sure that the\r\n\r\ncertificates in the English medium, when we do con\r\n\r\nduct  such examinations locally, will be  accepted\r\n\r\nby  the Federation Government as equivalent to the\r\n\r\nCambridge  School Certificate. This  is  something\r\n\r\nwhich we do not just do overnight. We should  have\r\n\r\ndiscussions, close liaison; perhaps people in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  setting  the papers  and  vice  versa,\r\n\r\nwhere  probably we do the marking on their behalf,\r\n\r\nand  so on. It takes time and, in fact, the leader\r\n\r\nof the Barisan Sosialis mentioned quite earlier on\r\n\r\nduring  the previous debate on merger that  hordes\r\n\r\nof  Chinese  from  the  Federation  come  down  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  in order to take the examinations  that\r\n\r\nare  conducted in the Chinese medium but regretted\r\n\r\nthe fact that such certificates are not recognised\r\n\r\noutside the State of Singapore. So let us be clear\r\n\r\nabout this. Let us not say, \"Yes, we shall conduct\r\n\r\nour  School Certificate Examination in English  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,\"  and find the sad position  that  such\r\n\r\ncertificates  are not accepted outside  Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt   is   an   entirely  different   picture   for\r\n\r\nexaminations conducted in other than  the  English\r\n\r\nstream.  Nobody is providing for such examinations\r\n\r\nand  it  is the duty of the State to conduct  such\r\n\r\nexaminations for the Malay medium by 1962 and give\r\n\r\nit  equal  recognition with certificates conducted\r\n\r\nby  the  Cambridge Syndicate. I think it  is  time\r\n\r\nthat  Members of the Barisan Sosialis should  also\r\n\r\nthink   a  little  bit  more  before  they   start\r\n\r\ncriticising,  that all these are colonial  actions\r\n\r\nand so on;\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  anything English is colonial.

The Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Gardens  was my Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nuntil a few months ago. He knew that I had in  mind\r\n\r\nthe  relaxation of the regulations to assist  rural\r\n\r\nschools.  Let him and his colleagues not  get  away\r\n\r\nwith  it.

No, they do not get that  credit.\r\n\r\nTry  not  to  still the thunder from the Government\r\n\r\nwhich has been working on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> There is no more\r\n\r\nthunder, only a squib.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> We now come to the question of\r\n\r\nintegrated  schools  where my former  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary,   the  present  Member   for   Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens, again lamented the fact that we are trying\r\n\r\nto  have  integrated  schools  which  are  only  an\r\n\r\nadjunct  to the English schools. Now, according  to\r\n\r\nthe  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech, it is the  intention of the Government to have more and more  of\r\n\r\nsuch integrated schools. By that we mean one school\r\n\r\nbuilding  taking in two different language streams.\r\n\r\nWe  believe  that  by  bringing together  different\r\n\r\nstreams,  it  is  one  way to break  down  communal\r\n\r\nbarriers and communal schools. Since it is our plan\r\n\r\nto  bring multilingualism into our schools, I think\r\n\r\nit  will  be  possible  before  long  for  a  happy\r\n\r\nexchange of teachers to be effected between the two\r\n\r\nlanguage streams. Let us assume that we are talking\r\n\r\nof  an integrated school in English and Chinese, of\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have  about  ten  by  now.  The  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage teachers could come from a Chinese  school\r\n\r\nand  the  English language teachers for the Chinese\r\n\r\nstream  could come from the teachers in an  English\r\n\r\nschool,   That  raises  the  standard  of  language\r\n\r\nteaching  in  both streams, so that they  would  be\r\n\r\nfairly good in both\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nChinese and English. Next month, at the new school\r\n\r\nto   be  opened  in  Jalan  Kaki  Bukit,  we   are\r\n\r\nintroducing  an integrated school in  the  English\r\n\r\nand Malay media. We hope the children who come out\r\n\r\nof  this integrated Malay/English school would  be\r\n\r\nvery  good both in Malay and English. In the  past\r\n\r\nit  has  been such that products of Malay  schools\r\n\r\nare  generally unfortunately weak in English,  but\r\n\r\nwe  hope  to  remedy that situation in  course  of\r\n\r\ntime.  We might even say, Sir, that the integrated\r\n\r\nschool could well become a national school of  the\r\n\r\nfuture,  as  the  language medium  of  instruction\r\n\r\nbegins  to  be  more  and  more  in  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage and where all the races would be together\r\n\r\nin  one  school building and the correct type  for\r\n\r\nthe teacher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the question of the school building\r\n\r\nprogramme  where the Member for Serangoon  Gardens\r\n\r\nstated  that  the  Government  was  only  able  to\r\n\r\nestablish two secondary schools so far,  one,  the\r\n\r\nWhampoa  Chinese Secondary School, and the  other,\r\n\r\nthe first Malay Secondary School known as the Sang\r\n\r\nNila  Utama School. He has forgotten, I am afraid,\r\n\r\nthe new secondary school which was opened sometime\r\n\r\nago  by  my colleague, the Member for Tiong Bahru,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the Queensway Secondary School  in  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  medium. Sir, it is one thing to say  that\r\n\r\nwe want to build 19 schools a year, or maybe 16 or\r\n\r\n17  depending  upon whether the schools  concerned\r\n\r\nare  six storeys instead of three storeys, so that\r\n\r\nthere will be fewer schools but they will take  in\r\n\r\nthe same number of pupils; but it is another thing\r\n\r\nto see the schools really built. So far I think we\r\n\r\nhave been able now to build up to ten new schools,\r\n\r\nof  which three are secondary schools. But I think\r\n\r\nnext month we will have at least three new schools\r\n\r\nand  we  will  have to open one new school  almost\r\n\r\nevery  month.  So the rate of new  buildings  will\r\n\r\ncatch up, and we hope that by 1964 there would  be\r\n\r\nno  less  than  17 new schools. But  the  way  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Serangoon Gardens has put it  is  that\r\n\r\nthe   Government  has  done  nothing  for  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation. Everything that is being built  is  for\r\n\r\nEnglish schools. It is that chauvinistic\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntwang - if it is an English school, therefore, it  is\r\n\r\ncolonial   and,   therefore,  this  Government   is\r\n\r\ncolonial;  and  so on and so forth. Sir,  the  only\r\n\r\nway to prove it is by deeds, by facts.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we came into office in June 1959, the\r\n\r\nenrolment  in  Government Chinese  schools  was  as\r\n\r\nfollows:  Primary, 2,233 pupils;  Secondary,  1,361\r\n\r\npupils,  making  a total of 3,594 pupils.  By  June\r\n\r\n1960, these are media figures; the\r\n\r\nPrimary  enrolment  had  increased  from  2,233  to\r\n\r\n5,775.  The Secondary enrolment was increased  from\r\n\r\n1,361  to  5,230. The total enrolment  jumped  from\r\n\r\n3,954,  which  is just under 4,000,  to  more  than\r\n\r\n11,000,  i.e. close  to a 279 per  cent  increase.\r\n\r\nJune  this  year  (1961), Primary school  enrolment\r\n\r\nwas  raised  to  7,911; Secondary school  enrolment\r\n\r\nwas  raised  to  6,571; total school  enrolment  in\r\n\r\nGovernment Chinese schools was 14,482, or  365  per\r\n\r\ncent  over the figures before we came into  office.\r\n\r\nSir,   there  are  more  than  a  hundred  thousand\r\n\r\nstudents  in Chinese aided schools and  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  to  absorb  all of them  into  Government\r\n\r\nschools. But if the Government is able to  keep  up\r\n\r\nwith the school building programme of 19 schools  a\r\n\r\nyear,  I think perhaps within a decade the majority\r\n\r\nof   all  pupils  in  all  streams  would   be   in\r\n\r\nGovernment   schools  and  a  minority   in   aided\r\n\r\nschools, of whatever language stream they may be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I cannot do better in concluding my\r\n\r\nshort  address  than  by referring  to  my  Party's\r\n\r\npublication, Petir, Issue Vol. 4, No. 1,  Saturday,\r\n\r\n17th  June, 1961, to an article written by  Mr  S.\r\n\r\nWoodhull,  now  the VicePresident  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis on \"The Two Years of Concrete Progress  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.\".

I\r\n\r\nwill just quote the relevant paragraphs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Education\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In The Tasks Ahead we drew attention to the fact\r\n\r\nthat  our population was increasing by about 60,000\r\n\r\neach  year. There was a need, therefore, to provide\r\n\r\nschools  for  about the same number of pupils  each\r\n\r\nyear.  The  Ministry of Education has handled  this\r\n\r\nproblem of providing education with the\r\n\r\ngreatest zeal.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAnother  paragraph  on the Adult  Education  Board\r\n\r\nwhich   Members  of  the  Barisan   Sosialis   now\r\n\r\ncriticise.

It also says that it  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  do  something for the benefit  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  to provide them with certain  social\r\n\r\namenities.  But then what achievements  have  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government made? The Government's promises\r\n\r\nmade  in  the  policy statements in the  previous\r\n\r\nsessions - have   they   materialised?   Have   the\r\n\r\nGovernment kept their promises? Nothing has  been\r\n\r\nachieved. The policy statement for this  year  is\r\n\r\nvery poor indeed in content. There is nothing  in\r\n\r\nit.  Everybody is disappointed when reading  this\r\n\r\npolicy statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1959 general elections, Dr Goh Keng\r\n\r\nSwee,  namely, the present Minister for  Finance,\r\n\r\nread  out certain policies of the P.A.P. to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  I quote from the Chinese pamphlet.  This\r\n\r\nis on the economic policy of the P.A.P. It says:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The objective of the economic policy of the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party Government will be to obtain\r\n\r\nfor the general masses of the\r\n\r\npeople a happy, full and secure livelihood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything which can be done within the\r\n\r\nlimitations of our economy to achieve this will be\r\n\r\ncarried out by the P.A.P. Government.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, today, the P.A.P. is holding the\r\n\r\nreins  of  government  for  the  third  year.  The\r\n\r\nwelfare  and the wellbeing of the people have  not\r\n\r\nbeen safeguarded. More people are unemployed. Many\r\n\r\ngraduates  of  local secondary schools  are  still\r\n\r\nunemployed. I shall give a simple example. We read\r\n\r\nfrom the newspaper last month that the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  wanted to recruit 1,000  teachers  from\r\n\r\nall  the language streams as teachers. There  were\r\n\r\n11,683 applicants. From this it is clear that when\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Education asked for applications\r\n\r\nto fill 1,000 posts, there were so many applicants 11,000  applicants from middle school  graduates.\r\n\r\nThere are graduates from the Universities who  are\r\n\r\nalso unemployed. Cases of robbery and all kinds of\r\n\r\ncrimes are happening everywhere and everyday.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  does not try to solve these  problems.\r\n\r\nInstead,  it  resorts  to  certain  tactics   and\r\n\r\nactions against those people who do not see eye to\r\n\r\neye  with  it; for instance, members of  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade and the staff of the People's Association.\r\n\r\nFrom  all  this, we can see what the  Government's\r\n\r\nattitude to them is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us ask the hawkers and the workers what their\r\n\r\nlivelihood  has been. They can all  tell  you  that\r\n\r\nthey   are   very  disappointed  with  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment.  It is true that the P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nhas been a great disappointment to us. What then is\r\n\r\nthe  cause? In the 1959 general elections,  did  it\r\n\r\nnot  clearly  promise the people  of  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nimprove the economic situation of\r\n\r\nSingapore and to resolve unemployment? The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nalso  printed  in booklet form their  promises.  I\r\n\r\nwill  quote them in order to show that what  I  am\r\n\r\nsaying is correct. Otherwise they will say I  have\r\n\r\nno proof. From this booklet we can get our answers\r\n\r\nto  rebut  them. We can see that all the  promises\r\n\r\nmade by the P.A.P. at that time have not been\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrealised.  I  will mention some  of  them  and  to\r\n\r\nrefute everyone of them to show whether the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  has lived up to its promises.  In  the\r\n\r\nfirst book of the P.A.P. pamphlet on the hive-Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan, there is a short passage  which\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let us briefly consider what factors work to\r\n\r\nour  advantage  in  industrialisation,  where  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  are  likely to arise,  and  how  our\r\n\r\nfavourable factors can be put to the\r\n\r\nbest  advantage to overcome the difficulties.  The\r\n\r\ncorrect economic policy would then emerge.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In this small pamphlet it is also pointed out that\r\n\r\nin  regard  to the industrialisation of Singapore,\r\n\r\nthere  are  four  economic  advantages.  It  says,\r\n\r\nfirst,   we  have  in  Singapore  a  hard-working,\r\n\r\nresourceful and enterprising people. Our  workers,\r\n\r\nif given the proper training facilities to develop\r\n\r\ntheir   skill,  are  able  to  reach  the  highest\r\n\r\nstandard  achieved in a modern industrial  nation.\r\n\r\nLet  us  examine  the first point.  How  does  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.    Government   treat   our    hardworking,\r\n\r\nresourceful and enterprising people? Let  us  see.\r\n\r\nNot  only  does  the Government not  organise  and\r\n\r\nmobilise  all  workers to create a more  beautiful\r\n\r\nand  more reasonable society, but instead  it  has\r\n\r\nresorted  to  all means to defeat them,  and  give\r\n\r\nthem  much trouble. It has also de-registered four\r\n\r\ntrade  union federations. The Government  is  also\r\n\r\nmaking  use of certain yellow trade unions,  which\r\n\r\nhave  been  banned  before, to  defeat  the  other\r\n\r\nlegitimate trade unions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the promise of giving the workers certain\r\n\r\nkinds of training to equip them with higher skills\r\n\r\nand scientific training in order to serve society,\r\n\r\nit depends on the people themselves to acquire the\r\n\r\nknowledge,   to  study  and  to  practise.   Given\r\n\r\nencouragement by the Government all  this  can  be\r\n\r\nrealised.  But  the basic attitude of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntowards the workers is not a friendly one.  It  is\r\n\r\nat  enmity  with the workers. How  can  they  talk\r\n\r\nabout  improving the technique and  skill  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about the Singapore Polytechnic,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  meant  to  train  workers,  to  provide\r\n\r\npersonnel skilled in scientific knowledge. But how\r\n\r\nmany  workers  have the Polytechnic  trained?  How\r\n\r\nmany  workers are studying there? The  Polytechnic\r\n\r\ndoes  not  provide  any  technical  education   to\r\n\r\nChinese stream students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pamphlet says that the second advantage of\r\n\r\nSingapore is that its central position,  with  its\r\n\r\nexcellent  sea communications with all  places  in\r\n\r\nthe  world, gives her an advantageous position  to\r\n\r\nobtain  cheap raw materials from nearby countries.\r\n\r\nThe  absence  of the raw materials in  the  island\r\n\r\nitself   will   not   be  such   a   drawback   to\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  since  we  can   obtain   cheap\r\n\r\nsupplies from nearby countries. Now, that  is  the\r\n\r\nsecond     advantage     Singapore     has      in\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. Since we have these  favourable\r\n\r\nconditions  and  these  advantages,  why  has  the\r\n\r\nGovernment not tried to make use of them to  carry\r\n\r\nout  its  promises? Why then does  the  Government\r\n\r\nmake such pathetic accusations as that it does not\r\n\r\nhave raw materials and skilled labourers and other\r\n\r\nthings and contradict what it has said before?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the third advantage, the pamphlet says\r\n\r\nthere  is  a fairly substantial amount of  capital\r\n\r\naccumulated   by   local   concerns   and   public\r\n\r\nauthorities;  that much of this capital  is  lying\r\n\r\nidle  or  is  invested in foreign countries.  This\r\n\r\nadvantage  would give confidence to the people  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the  future  economic  prospects   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But  all  these  good  prospects   can\r\n\r\nmaterialise only if Singapore can shake away  from\r\n\r\ncolonial economic control and shake away the  yoke\r\n\r\nof  colonial rulers, and promote the local economy\r\n\r\nand  encourage  local  people  to  take  part   in\r\n\r\neconomic  activities. But what the  P.A.P.  Government  has  done  during their term of  office  has\r\n\r\ngreatly  disappointed us. The P.A.P. rulers  have\r\n\r\nkowtowed  to colonial rulers. They are now  trying\r\n\r\nto  grovel.  They  are  now trying  to  resort  to\r\n\r\nappeasing foreign capitalists, to come\r\n\r\nto terms with them. They have neglected our\r\n\r\neconomic development and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  policy. In this  respect,  there\r\n\r\nis  one very important factor, which is to make use\r\n\r\nof  our present local capital and not try to depend\r\n\r\nentirely  on  the  investment of  foreign  capital.\r\n\r\nThis   point  is  also  mentioned  in  the  Chinese\r\n\r\npamphlet of The Tasks Ahead. It says:-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The P.A.P. profoundly disagrees that the\r\n\r\nsurvival  of  Singapore depends on foreign  capital\r\n\r\nand  foreign capitalists. That is to say, there  is\r\n\r\nample local capital for this task.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>It continues to say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But it would be foolish to imagine that whatever\r\n\r\nwe  do,  foreign capital will come in on the  scale\r\n\r\nneeded to solve our problems.\r\n\r\nOur salvation lies in our own hands. There are no\r\n\r\nbenevolent foreigners knocking around\r\n\r\nthe world anxious to discharge these duties and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities which are rightly our\r\n\r\nown.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>There are also a few lines which say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let us never forget that self-government is not\r\n\r\npossible  without self-reliance. This is true  both\r\n\r\nin politics as well as in economics.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, this is what the P.A.P. promised\r\n\r\nin  1959.  How grand it sounds! But it  is  a  pity\r\n\r\nthat  our Minister for Finance is not here. He  has\r\n\r\nsaid  that we should not face our economic problems\r\n\r\nwith  the  mental attitudes appropriate to colonial\r\n\r\nservitude.  Can he still remember what he  said?  I\r\n\r\nbelieve he has relegated this statement of  his  to\r\n\r\noblivion.  During  these 30  months,  how  has  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   Government   dealt   with   the   economic\r\n\r\nsituation?  Has it carried out its promises?  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  a  Doctor  of  Economics. I have  not  studied\r\n\r\neconomics much. Of course, I am not used to  giving\r\n\r\ngrand  talks  on economic theories,  but  from  the\r\n\r\nrealities  of  life and facts,  I  feel  they  have\r\n\r\nalready  forgotten their resolute  belief  made  at\r\n\r\nthat  time. I say this not because I am now in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  When I was Parliamentary Secretary  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance, I also  mentioned  this\r\n\r\nto  him on many occasions. I suggested to him  how\r\n\r\nto  deal with the local economic situation and  how\r\n\r\nto  deal with foreign capitalists. But he seemed to\r\n\r\nfeel  that he is a very famous economist well known\r\n\r\nin   Singapore,  so  he  took  my  suggestions   as\r\n\r\nsomething acquired from others. When somebody  else\r\n\r\nsays so, I\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalso  say  so.  That  is what  he  thought  of  my\r\n\r\nsuggestions. But during its 30 months  of  office,\r\n\r\nhas the P.A.P. Government taken steps to encourage\r\n\r\nlocal capitalists and industrialists? Has it tried\r\n\r\nto  gather  scattered local capital  in  order  to\r\n\r\ninvest locally and to develop local industries? We\r\n\r\nhave  to  ask  our local national capitalists  and\r\n\r\nindustrialists this question. Their answer will be\r\n\r\nthe  same, that they are greatly disappointed. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has not done so. The P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nhas  not only not reclaimed the money invested  in\r\n\r\nEngland  to  invest  it in local  industries,  but\r\n\r\ninstead  it has reinvested large sums of money  in\r\n\r\nEngland. How disappointing it is to us. The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment is giving special treatment to  foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists  and their local compradores.  It  has\r\n\r\ngiven foreign monopolistic capitalists a five-year\r\n\r\ntax  holiday  from income tax. It has  also  given\r\n\r\nthem  pioneer status and certain favourable  terms\r\n\r\nfor     certain    Government    industries    and\r\n\r\nmanufactures.   Although  local  capitalists   and\r\n\r\nmanufacturers can apply to have such terms,  there\r\n\r\nis  a  provision in the Income Tax Ordinance which\r\n\r\ngives the Government power to claim arrears of tax\r\n\r\nretrospectively  for  12  years.  Of  course,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  if it is in the hands of the  people,\r\n\r\ncan  have  such  a law to prevent the  evasion  of\r\n\r\npaying tax. But during the previous Government the\r\n\r\npeople  tried  to  evade  paying  tax.  This   was\r\n\r\ninevitable  because, during those  colonial  days,\r\n\r\nthis was one way to hit at the colonial rulers  by\r\n\r\nevading  paying taxes to the colonial  government.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  relevant laws were formulated in  those\r\n\r\ndays, they were specially meant to deal with\r\n\r\nthe  general  public. But now, if anybody  or  any\r\n\r\nnational capitalist tries to evade paying tax,  he\r\n\r\nwill be running a risk.\r\n\r\nIt  is mostly in the past that they tried to evade\r\n\r\ntax. If they were to, put in capital, they run the\r\n\r\nrisk of investigation by the Government under  the\r\n\r\npresent  law  and  they  fear  that  they  may  be\r\n\r\nrequired to pay the tax which they evaded  in  the\r\n\r\npast. Therefore, they would rather carry out  some\r\n\r\nother   kind  of  business  in  order   to   avoid\r\n\r\ninvestigation by the Government. So\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis  policy of the Government is not very correct.\r\n\r\nIt  is  trying  to get golden eggs by  killing  the\r\n\r\ngoose which lays the golden eggs. But in the end it\r\n\r\nwill  lose  both the golden eggs and the goose.  If\r\n\r\nonly   it   does  not  take  stringent  restrictive\r\n\r\nmeasures     against    the    local    nationalist\r\n\r\nindustrialists and capitalists who help to  promote\r\n\r\nlocal  industries, commerce and trade, and economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  they  will be more  than  willing  to\r\n\r\nhelp.  But  the Government is in favour of  foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists,  and is neglecting our local  national\r\n\r\ncapitalists   and  industrialists.  How   can   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  now  explain  away  what  it  has  said\r\n\r\nbefore, of encouraging our local industrialists and\r\n\r\nnationalists? How can the Government now be able to\r\n\r\nstimulate   economy   and  achieve   its   economic\r\n\r\npurposes?  I  will  again  quote  from  the   small\r\n\r\npamphlet on the economic policy of the P.A.P.:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let us never forget that self-government is not\r\n\r\npossible without self-reliance. This is true  both\r\n\r\nin politics as well as in economics.'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  Minister  for Finance must  be  very  absent-minded,  because  how  can he  now  explain  this?\r\n\r\nPerhaps he has now forgotten what he said in 1959.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When touching on the fourth advantage of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation in Singapore, he said that large\r\n\r\nnatural  markets  exist in neighbouring  countries\r\n\r\nwith  whom  the merchants of Singapore  have  good\r\n\r\nrelations  and  that  manufacturers  in  Singapore\r\n\r\ncould  have access to these markets provided  they\r\n\r\ncould  produce  goods at competitive  prices.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  this is obvious. There  are  large\r\n\r\nnatural   markets  existing  in  our  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries,  not only in the Federation of  Malaya.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. is adopting a grovelling attitude  to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya as though the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  cannot exist without the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  The P.A.P. Government despises our  local\r\n\r\ncapitalists  and  industrialists.  It   does   not\r\n\r\nencourage and guide them. What is the use then  of\r\n\r\nthese  large  natural markets? The Government  has\r\n\r\nignored  the local capitalists and industrialists.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, most of the people engaged  in  the\r\n\r\nbiscuit,  soap  and leather-shoe  industries  have\r\n\r\nclosed down. Some of\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthem  have  gone bankrupt while others  are  in  a\r\n\r\nvery  bad  economic situation. Are these not  good\r\n\r\nexamples?  If the Government had taken  good  care\r\n\r\nof  them  so  that  they  could  have  sold  their\r\n\r\nproducts  at  a lower cost to world-wide  markets since  they had close links with these markets - the\r\n\r\nlocal  economy would have improved. We should  try\r\n\r\nto  lay  a sound foundation for our local  economy\r\n\r\nto  help the local industries prosper. But has the\r\n\r\nGovernment  done  anything towards  reaching  this\r\n\r\nobjective? Has it any plans? No, none at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see again whether the P.A.P. Government,\r\n\r\nduring  the  last  30 months of its  office,  has\r\n\r\ntried to remedy any defects in industrialisation.\r\n\r\nIn  their small pamphlet there is a passage which\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On the other side of the picture, there are\r\n\r\ncertain  weaknesses. The first is that  the  free\r\n\r\nentry of foreign goods places local manufacturers\r\n\r\nat a disadvantageous position especially in lines\r\n\r\nwhere  it would take some years for a factory  to\r\n\r\nreach full efficiency. Also foreign price-cutting\r\n\r\nis  not  unknown  as a method of killing  locally\r\n\r\nestablished industries.\r\n\r\nThis increases the risk of investing in manufacturing industries.'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  order  to cure this weakness, we  must  first\r\n\r\nbreak  away  from  the  colonial  economic  yoke,\r\n\r\neliminate  the colonial forces and help establish\r\n\r\nlocal  industries. That is the basic method.  The\r\n\r\npreservation of Singapore's status as a free port\r\n\r\nand the development of Singapore as an industrial\r\n\r\nisland    are   two   contradictory   objectives.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Government should try to find some\r\n\r\nmeans  whereby we can preserve our entrepot trade\r\n\r\nand,  at the same time, promote industrialisation\r\n\r\nso  that  we  can  offer more  opportunities  for\r\n\r\nemployment  to our rapidly increasing population.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  have  to  expand  our  industries\r\n\r\nrapidly. In order to protect our local industrial\r\n\r\nproducts  against foreign goods and at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime  compete  in other markets,  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  impose certain tariffs on foreign  goods.\r\n\r\nBut it is regrettable that the Government has-\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Let us touch on general policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nif  that  is  the case, I will go on to the  second\r\n\r\nweakness in the P.A.P.'s economic policy.  This  is\r\n\r\nvery  important.  In the P.A.P.'s pamphlet,  it  is\r\n\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The second disadvantage is that the large market\r\n\r\nin  the Federation is not open to Singapore on the\r\n\r\nsame  terms  as  it  is  open  to  the  Federation\r\n\r\nmanufacturers. A factory in Johore Bahru does  not\r\n\r\npay import duty on its products but one sited five\r\n\r\nmiles away along Bukit Timah Road will have to pay\r\n\r\na  duty  on  goods exported to the Federation.  So\r\n\r\nlong  as this is the case, there will be a  strong\r\n\r\nincentive to manufacturers to establish plants  in\r\n\r\nthe Federation rather than in\r\n\r\nSingapore.'.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>This is what the Minister for Finance said at that\r\n\r\ntime.  Everybody  can clearly understand  how  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government is treating us. It  is  just\r\n\r\nlike  an  elder brother bullying a younger brother\r\n\r\nwho  has  all  the  time  been  tolerant  of  such\r\n\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us recall what the P.A.P. said in 1959. This\r\n\r\nis  to  be  found  in the Chinese version  of  the\r\n\r\npamphlet:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Hitherto, Federation manufacturers have enjoyed\r\n\r\nnot  only  free  access to Singapore  markets  but\r\n\r\ncould also depend on Singapore's entrepot services\r\n\r\nto help them to penetrate\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noverseas  markets. On the other hand,  Singapore's\r\n\r\nproducts  are  treated  as foreign  goods  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  The Federation need not  assume  that\r\n\r\nsuch   a   one-sided  arrangement  could  continue\r\n\r\nindefinitely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of a common tariff-free market\r\n\r\nwithin  the  framework of a larger economic  union\r\n\r\nbased  on a co-ordinated development programme  is\r\n\r\nthe  only  way whereby both territories  can  find\r\n\r\nanswers to their pressing economic problems.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>It goes on to say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It will be foolish in the extreme for one\r\n\r\nterritory  to  take  temporary  advantage  of  the\r\n\r\nother,  for this will set off a chain reaction  of\r\n\r\nreprisals and counter reprisals which will lead to\r\n\r\nthe ruin of both territories. In Malaya, as indeed\r\n\r\nelsewhere, prosperity is indivisible.''\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been correct. Discussions on a common\r\n\r\ncommodity   market  between  Singapore   and   the\r\n\r\nFederation have been going on for two years. Up to\r\n\r\nnow,   this  question  is  still  being  discussed\r\n\r\nbetween the two Governments. This proves that  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government does not have any regard for\r\n\r\nthe  wishes  and hopes of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nWhere then are the ambitious aims which the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmanifested some time ago? The P.A.P. are  adopting\r\n\r\nan  ignominous, shameful and begging  attitude  by\r\n\r\nasking  the  Federation to  help  them.  This  description by me is not exaggerated. Let us  examine\r\n\r\nwhat the P.A.P. said in 1959 in their pamphlet:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A P.A.P. Government in negotiating with the\r\n\r\nFederation Government for the abolition of  import\r\n\r\nduty  on  Singapore manufactures need not approach\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  Government  in   the   role   of\r\n\r\nsupplicants for favours.'\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>Is  it  not very clear from this? The P.A.P. said\r\n\r\nthat   we   would  not  approach  the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment in the role of supplicants for favours.\r\n\r\nLet  us  now  hear  again what the,  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  said on the 25th November, 1959, when  he\r\n\r\nmade his Budget Statement. He pointed out that the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the two territories are indivisible.\r\n\r\nIt  is to be found in Volume 11, No. 13, col.  780\r\n\r\nof Hansard. Then he said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is clear from the foregoing account that an\r\n\r\narrangement  of this kind accepts the fact  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic  unity  of  the two territories.  Whatever\r\n\r\nthe  political divisions, it is obvious  that  they\r\n\r\nmust co-operate in economic fields and it would  be\r\n\r\ninjurious  to both countries to take an independent\r\n\r\nand   competitive  line  of  action  in   promoting\r\n\r\nindustrial growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the point of view of the prospective\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmanufacturer,  the  attraction  of  investing   in\r\n\r\nMalaya  would  immensely  increase.  A  Federation\r\n\r\ninvestor,  for  instance, would be  assured  of  a\r\n\r\nprotected market not only in his own country,  but\r\n\r\nalso   in   Singapore.  Similarly,   a   Singapore\r\n\r\nmanufacturer would not have to surmount the tariff\r\n\r\nwall  which  the  Federation  now  places  against\r\n\r\nSingapore products. It is therefore hoped that  an\r\n\r\nearly  decision  would be reached.  Any  delay  in\r\n\r\nreaching   a  decision  would  merely  mean   that\r\n\r\nprospective investors may be induced  to  adopt  a\r\n\r\nwaiting policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's attraction as a partner to the common\r\n\r\nmarket is much greater than the comparison of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  figures of the two  territories  would\r\n\r\nsuggest.  While the Federation has more than  four\r\n\r\npersons  to one Singaporean, the purchasing  power\r\n\r\nof  the  two territories by no means follows  this\r\n\r\nratio.

The   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment is a friendly government and I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  he  ought to say anything derogatory  about\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nare  we supposed to stare at the P.A.P. while they\r\n\r\nsell out the interests of the people of Singapore?\r\n\r\nOf  course, we should not allow them to do such  a\r\n\r\nthing.  But, Mr Speaker, we think that  Singapore\r\n\r\ncan  stand by itself. We do not have to kowtow  to\r\n\r\nanybody.  We  do  not have to supplicate  anybody.\r\n\r\nEverything  in the world is created by labour.  As\r\n\r\nlong  as  we have faith in ourselves, we can  live\r\n\r\nand  exist.  There  is nothing  difficult  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  The  only hindrance is that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nfaith in oneself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us now examine the fourth\r\n\r\nweakness.  It says the merchants of Singapore  pay\r\n\r\ntoo   much   attention  to  commerce  and   little\r\n\r\nattention  to industries. Singapore has  been  the\r\n\r\ncentre  of commerce for over a hundred years.  The\r\n\r\nBritish  colonialists, for the sake of  exploiting\r\n\r\nthe  primary  materials, products  and  wealth  of\r\n\r\nSouth-East Asia, did not in the past try to expand\r\n\r\nthe  local trading facilities. Whatever  they  did\r\n\r\nwas  only  for their own interests. They  did  not\r\n\r\nhave  the interests of the local people at  heart.\r\n\r\nThey did not have\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nany intention to promote our local industries.  So\r\n\r\nwithout  any  safeguard, local national capitalists\r\n\r\nand  industrialists would not dare to invest  money\r\n\r\nin   industries.  We  should  blame   the   British\r\n\r\ncolonialists  for what they did.  But  the  present\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  has  not  accused  the  British\r\n\r\ncolonialists.  Instead the Government  is  accusing\r\n\r\nthe local industrialists and capitalists of not  in\r\n\r\nvesting  locally. It has also accused  the  workers\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  of  not following the  line  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. As I have said just now, Singapore  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  commercial port for over a hundred  years.\r\n\r\nSo  to  revert it to an industrial centre is not  a\r\n\r\nvery  easy  matter. Therefore, the Government  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  encourage  local industrialists  and  mer\r\n\r\nchants  and national capitalists, to persuade  them\r\n\r\nand  give  them more confidence, and  try  to  help\r\n\r\nthem  in all ways to give them confidence to invest\r\n\r\nlocally,  to promote industries and to create  more\r\n\r\nemployment  opportunities. The  livelihood  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  will  then  be solved  partially.  But  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  not  encouraged  local   national\r\n\r\ncapitalists  and  industrialists to  develop  local\r\n\r\nindustries.  On the other hand, it  has  only  been\r\n\r\nridiculing   the   simple  family  industries   and\r\n\r\nbusinesses   carried  on  by   them.   Of   course,\r\n\r\nindustries  managed  by a family  are  not  run  on\r\n\r\nscientific lines. But the Government has  the  duty\r\n\r\nto  teach them, to encourage them, to help them run\r\n\r\ntheir  businesses on modern lines. So this attitude\r\n\r\nof  the Government is only impeding the development\r\n\r\nof  industries in Singapore. When the country is at\r\n\r\nthe  beginning  of industrialisation programme,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  expect it to be up to modern standards,  up\r\n\r\nto  100  per  cent. Our local national  capitalists\r\n\r\nhave  been  going  through a long period  in  which\r\n\r\nthey  have  been exploited by foreign  monopolistic\r\n\r\ncapitalists.  They  have been  suffering.  But  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  not  tried  to  help   them.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has said that it wants  to  help  build\r\n\r\nlocal  industries. But, on the other  hand,  it  is\r\n\r\nactually  helping foreign monopolistic  capitalists\r\n\r\nin industry locally.

What I want to do is to mention the most  important  point.  Having done  so  much,  the  said\r\n\r\ncompany  only engaged one extra worker. From  what\r\n\r\nwe   have  revealed  about  the  various  economic\r\n\r\nadvantages and disadvantages of Singapore, we  can\r\n\r\neasily come to this conclusion, which is that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government, which has been in office for 30\r\n\r\nmonths,  has not carried out its promises made  in\r\n\r\n1959.  The whole economic policy is near the stage\r\n\r\nof  bankruptcy. The livelihood of the  people  has\r\n\r\nbecome  more  difficult. The  whole  situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is very confused. It is in a  state  of\r\n\r\nturmoil. All this can be attributed to the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nIn  the  P.A.P.'s pamphlet, it is  also  mentioned\r\n\r\nthat the unemployment problem in Singapore is\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvery  acute.  If  we  do not try  to  resolve  this\r\n\r\nproblem  now,  then by 1962 the situation  will  be\r\n\r\nout  of  hand. It will be very difficult to  tackle\r\n\r\nit.  The  P.A.P. is  now  trying  to  salvage  its\r\n\r\npolitical  fortunes and to save itself from  dying.\r\n\r\nTo  do so, it is now trying to carry out a kind  of\r\n\r\nphoney  merger in order to achieve its own  purpose\r\n\r\nof   maintaining   its   political   position   and\r\n\r\npolitical power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I want to say that if we want to make the\r\n\r\neconomy of Singapore a prosperous one, we have,  on\r\n\r\nthe  one hand, to eliminate colonial influences and\r\n\r\nforces  and, on the other hand, to try to build  an\r\n\r\nindependent  and autonomous economic system.  Therefore,  our major economic tasks now are, first,  to\r\n\r\neradicate  colonial economic control  and  economic\r\n\r\nforces  and  to eradicate all kinds of unreasonable\r\n\r\nphenomena  from  our  society.  When  there  is  no\r\n\r\nexploitation of man by man can we then achieve  our\r\n\r\npurpose  of  having a more just and equal  society,\r\n\r\nwhich is our long-term aim.\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nwish  to  waste  the time of this  Assembly  to  do\r\n\r\nroundabout  talking, because we have  been  sitting\r\n\r\nin  this  Assembly for quite sometime  and  we  are\r\n\r\nalmost  tired  of  words being repeated  again  and\r\n\r\nagain.  I  do not think this is necessary  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. I feel that we, as  represen\r\n\r\ntatives  of the people, are big enough and  we  are\r\n\r\nquite  aware. We can understand what  we  say.  But\r\n\r\nunfortunately  there  are  people  who  could   not\r\n\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My intention in debating the Address of Thanks to\r\n\r\nthe  Yang di-Pertuan Negara in connection with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy is to draw  the  attention  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government, who has governed Singapore for two\r\n\r\nand  a  half  years,  to  certain  things.  It   is\r\n\r\nnecessary for us to look back during the two and  a\r\n\r\nhalf  years  and  see  what  are  the  achievements\r\n\r\nconfronting us now. This Government was elected  to\r\n\r\npower because it promised\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  bring  prosperity to the people of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  people of Singapore are still waiting for the\r\n\r\npromises to be fulfilled. But what we get is  just\r\n\r\nthe  reverse. There are things which are not satisfactory to us. There are political conflicts among\r\n\r\nthe  people. We find more unemployment, and it  is\r\n\r\ngetting worse each day. This is one instance which\r\n\r\nshows  that  the Government, who claims  to  be  a\r\n\r\nsocialist   Government,  has  not  fulfilled   the\r\n\r\npromises it made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another instance is this. There are rules and\r\n\r\nregulations  as to where hawkers  are  to  set  up\r\n\r\nstalls and what will happen to them if they do not\r\n\r\ncomply  with  those rules. It is  not  that  these\r\n\r\nhawkers  wish  to be like this, but they  have  to\r\n\r\nrely  on  their livelihood as hawkers. But  it  is\r\n\r\nwise  on  the part of Government to plan long-term\r\n\r\ndevelopment programmes, although the results  will\r\n\r\nnot  be achieved within a short space of one year,\r\n\r\ntwo   years   or   three  years.  Such   long-term\r\n\r\nobjectives will not immediately effect a change in\r\n\r\nthe   livelihood  of  the  people.   Everyone   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  needs  all  the basic  necessities  and\r\n\r\namenities  of  life, as are required  by  ordinary\r\n\r\nhuman  beings.  A  short-term  objective  can   be\r\n\r\nachieved  within  a  specified  time.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nbecause we are half independent but because of the\r\n\r\nrestrictive constitutional conditions that we  are\r\n\r\nbarred from finding ways and means. I feel this is\r\n\r\nmerely  an excuse put forward which is not in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the  public. I  think  there  is  no\r\n\r\ndifficulty which cannot be resolved. If there is a\r\n\r\nwill, there is a way, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, today we are providing houses.\r\n\r\nThere  are unemployed persons and the money  spent\r\n\r\nan  housing will be wasted because the houses will\r\n\r\nnot  be occupied by people because they are unable\r\n\r\nto  afford  the  rentals. This is  the  reason  as\r\n\r\nexplained  by  a  Member of  this  Assembly.  This\r\n\r\ncannot wholly resolve the unemployment problem. On\r\n\r\nthe  contrary, it will lead to communal  distrust.\r\n\r\nThey will have no faith in the Work Brigade which,\r\n\r\nit  is said, was in fact established for the  good\r\n\r\nof  the  people, although the object of  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade was to help in the implementation of the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment's  development  programmes.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nwish  to  go  deeply into the details,  but  it  is\r\n\r\nobvious  that  the Work Brigade is merely  for  the\r\n\r\ngood of the party in power and not for the good  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore. Similarly, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nalthough  we admit that the present Government  was\r\n\r\nelected on the basis of parliamentary democracy and\r\n\r\nthat it is the responsibility of the Government  to\r\n\r\ngovern, we cannot get the support of the people  if\r\n\r\nthe  methods  of administration are not implemented\r\n\r\nin the true spirit of democracy. Democracy does not\r\n\r\nmean  that the Party that has been elected to power\r\n\r\ncan force plans down the throats of the people. The\r\n\r\npeople  are not like hens which we feed with maize.\r\n\r\nWe  as humans beings can distinguish the good  from\r\n\r\nthe bad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister himself has admitted that he\r\n\r\nhas  no  confidence in nominating  persons  to  the\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission who are not closely  asso\r\n\r\nciated  with  the P.A.P. So when such a  method  is\r\n\r\nadopted   naturally   there   is   a   feeling   of\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction among those persons who cannot  get\r\n\r\nthrough the P.S.C. I think this question of  having\r\n\r\nno  faith  in the non-P.A.P. members is a  mistake,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Government are not merely responsible\r\n\r\nfor P.A.P. members. They are not going to provide a\r\n\r\nlivelihood  for  P.A.P. member's  alone.  They  are\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  all  the  people  of   Singapore,\r\n\r\nnumbering 1\u00bd million. Therefore, if this  practice\r\n\r\nis   continued  by  the  Government - we  experienced\r\n\r\nJapanese  administration for over 3\u00bd  years - I  fear\r\n\r\nmore  chaotic  conditions will be suffered  by  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of land planning, Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nknow  the  Government is basing it on  the  Master\r\n\r\nPlan  which, according to this policy speech,  says\r\n\r\nthat the Master Plan will be revised to fit in with\r\n\r\nthe  prevailing conditions as to the  provision  of\r\n\r\nhouses  for  the  public  and  the  development  of\r\n\r\nfactories and so on. I would like here to draw  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's attention to the fact that it is right\r\n\r\nand proper that some revision be\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmade  to the Master Plan. I think suggestions  for\r\n\r\nthe  amendments have already been submitted to the\r\n\r\nGovernment for consideration. I raise this matter,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, in view of the unsettled conditions,\r\n\r\nthat  is  to say, wherever vacant land  is  found,\r\n\r\nthere will be erected unauthorised huts. But I  do\r\n\r\nnot  wish  to  go  into  details.  Admittedly   in\r\n\r\naccordance with the law the people who build these\r\n\r\nunauthorised  huts  are  at  fault.  These  people\r\n\r\ndeserve  to be punished. The Government has  taken\r\n\r\naction to demolish these huts. But one thing which\r\n\r\nI  would like to awaken the Government to is  that\r\n\r\nthese   people  are  the  people  who  have   been\r\n\r\nneglected.  To  the  best of my  knowledge,  these\r\n\r\npeople  are unemployed or are not fully  employed.\r\n\r\nThey  are  hawkers selling satay and  things  like\r\n\r\nthat.  They are renting cubicles at $20 per month,\r\n\r\nsometimes $25 per month. They do not like to  rent\r\n\r\nsuch   cubicles  because  of  the  unhealthy   and\r\n\r\ninsanitary conditions. Naturally they wish to seek\r\n\r\nbetter  accommodation. These cubicles are  not  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the building regulations.  Because\r\n\r\ncircumstances force them to do so,  they  have  no\r\n\r\nalternative   but  to  erect  unauthorised   huts.\r\n\r\nAlthough   these  unauthorised   huts   had   been\r\n\r\ndemolished  by the Government, they were  prepared\r\n\r\nto  live in them. So this is a matter to which the\r\n\r\nGovernment   should  give  serious  consideration.\r\n\r\nThese people are prepared for the worst. They  are\r\n\r\nnot prepared to quit. This is a serious matter and\r\n\r\nI  have  brought it to the knowledge of the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  I  have  suggested  to  him  how   this\r\n\r\ndelicate  problem  could be overcome.  But  up  to\r\n\r\ntoday,  my  Party has not yet received a  positive\r\n\r\nreply   whether  our  recommendations  have   been\r\n\r\naccepted  in order to overcome this very  delicate\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this policy debate I have heard Members of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis who, in addition to attacking\r\n\r\nthe  present P.A.P.

This\r\n\r\nHouse has not been informed of any result so  far.\r\n\r\nThe  Four-Year Development Plan, as far as we  can\r\n\r\nsee,  is  nothing  but a mere plan  in  which  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. tries to\r\n\r\nmake itself happy. Mr Speaker, Sir, in the whole\r\n\r\nof the policy statement for the\r\n\r\npresent   session,  we  can  discover   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  now indulging in another  kind  of\r\n\r\nargument.  It is contradictory to what  they  said\r\n\r\nlast  year.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I would  like  your\r\n\r\npermission to make some quotations from the Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara's speech appearing in column  12\r\n\r\nof Hansard dated 31st October, 1961:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'With merger now in prospect, the assumptions on\r\n\r\nwhich the original economic policies of the\r\n\r\nGovernment were based must be reviewed.

Here again the Member for\r\n\r\nPunggol  is developing an argument which  involves\r\n\r\nmerger.  I  have indicated that that  has  already\r\n\r\nbeen  dealt  with and I do not want  a  debate  to\r\n\r\ndevelop on any aspect of merger.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  you  will  remember that  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance declared\r\n\r\nlast year that the Government wanted to increase\r\n\r\nthe registration fees of businesses\r\n\r\nand  the  property tax. At that time, my colleague\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim, with a mandate from  the\r\n\r\npeople,  criticised the Minister  for  Finance  by\r\n\r\nsaying  that the Estimates were going  to  extract\r\n\r\nmoney  from  the people. The Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\ntried  to  defend himself and this resulted  in  a\r\n\r\nvery  heated debate. At that time, the  Government\r\n\r\ninsisted  on its own views and refused  to  revise\r\n\r\nits  economic policy which was based on a  certain\r\n\r\nassumption.  The  P.A.P., in  wanting  to  prevent\r\n\r\nitself from coming to a political end, changes its\r\n\r\npolicy  from  time to time. We can see  this  very\r\n\r\noften and there is no need for us to speak a\r\n\r\nlot on this. In order to survive, the P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nresorted to all sorts of tactics. It has\r\n\r\nrestored the pay cuts and it has cancelled\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe    registration   fees   for   business    and\r\n\r\nprofessions. The Government is now in  a  pathetic\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have already approved about\r\n\r\n$6  million  as expenditure for the  Work  Brigade\r\n\r\nnext  year.  This  is  a  considerable  amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney.   But   we  have  not  as  yet   seen   any\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  plan which the Government  proposes\r\n\r\nfor  the Work Brigade. I am not personally against\r\n\r\nthe  Work  Brigade  or its members  who  are  very\r\n\r\nyoung  and  useful people. If the  Government  can\r\n\r\ntake  good care of them, they would then  be  able\r\n\r\nto help in nation building.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, due to a lack of leadership and\r\n\r\nability  and  the  lack of a  comprehensive  plan,\r\n\r\nthese  young people are just like heroes who  have\r\n\r\nno  way to express their abilities. As a result of\r\n\r\nthis,  public funds are being wasted on  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade.  This is, however, not so  bad.  But  now\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is even making  use  of  military\r\n\r\nforces  and the police to suppress members of  the\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I can  see\r\n\r\nthat  this  Government is becoming more  and  more\r\n\r\nfierce.  The  Prime Minister is now as  fierce  as\r\n\r\nHitler  was. I think if this amount of $6  million\r\n\r\nis  spent  on the construction of roads and  amenities  in the rural areas, the people in the  rural\r\n\r\nareas will derive a great deal of benefit.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we can see that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have done hardly anything in  respect\r\n\r\nof   health.  We  know  that  the  population   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  increasing  from  day  to  day.  At\r\n\r\npresent the Kandang Kerbau Maternity Hospital  has\r\n\r\nto attend to too many people. I wonder whether the\r\n\r\nGovernment are considering any plan to expand this\r\n\r\nhospital.  As a result of the present  congestion,\r\n\r\nmany  pregnant women can only stay in the hospital\r\n\r\nfor  one  day.  As a result of this,  mothers  and\r\n\r\nbabies are not receiving proper care. On the other\r\n\r\nhand, instead of doing something to extend the hos\r\n\r\npital, the, Government are building more and  more\r\n\r\ncommunity centres from public funds.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. have not helped the poor people\r\n\r\nvery  much.  I can quote an example to  illustrate\r\n\r\nthis.  Clinics,  which are  a  help  to  the  poor\r\n\r\npeople,  are not being built in great  numbers.  I\r\n\r\nwant  to  quote some facts to, show  how  the  Government  are  ill-treating  our  poor  people   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  At the 6th milestone, Upper  Serangoon\r\n\r\nRoad,  there is an old post office which has  been\r\n\r\nturned into a children's welfare clinic. This  old\r\n\r\npost  office building is very small and every  day\r\n\r\nyou  have many mothers bringing their children  to\r\n\r\nthis  converted clinic because they cannot  afford\r\n\r\nto  incur  medical expenses. When there is  a  big\r\n\r\ncrowd,  they  have to line up in the  hot  sun.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  ask the Government  whether  such\r\n\r\ntreatment of the poor people is proper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, we can take a look at the other\r\n\r\nside  of  the  picture. In Upper  Serangoon  Road,\r\n\r\nthere is a new community centre which is closed in\r\n\r\nthe  day. It is only used in the night when  there\r\n\r\nare  a  few people playing some games. At the  9th\r\n\r\nmilestone,  Punggol, there is not  even  a  single\r\n\r\nclinic  although  it is a very crowded  area.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  would do a better job  if  they  spend\r\n\r\nmoney  on  the  building of more clinics  than  on\r\n\r\ncommunity centres. We made these proposals  during\r\n\r\nthe Hong Lim by-election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember that when the P.A.P. came to\r\n\r\npower  in 1959, the former Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the  Ministry of Health, who is now the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Nee  Soon, invited me to visit the Woodbridge\r\n\r\nHospital  which is in the constituency of Punggol.\r\n\r\nI  had occasion to visit the voters living in  the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  and I noted that the workers  lived\r\n\r\nin  a  crowded  area. In some cases,  many  people\r\n\r\nlived in a small room. The ventilation was bad and\r\n\r\nso  was  the other aspect of health. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nasked  the Minister for Health to pay a  visit  to\r\n\r\nthis  place.  He  agreed to  do  so  and  we  went\r\n\r\ntogether  to inspect the quarters of the  workers.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  for Health agreed to my  suggestion\r\n\r\nand  promised to do something about  it.  He  even\r\n\r\nwent to the extent of saying in an angry tone that\r\n\r\nthis  came about as a result of colonial rule.  He\r\n\r\ntold  the  workers  that the Government  would  do\r\n\r\ntheir best to improve their living conditions. But\r\n\r\nnow the Minister has changed\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  the promised improvement has not come  about.\r\n\r\nI hope the new Minister for Health will one  day\r\n\r\npay this place a visit. A man with the physique of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Health will not be  able  to  go\r\n\r\ninto  the building. I am not making a joke at  his\r\n\r\nexpense, but it is a fact that the building is too\r\n\r\nsmall for him to enter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary to\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Prime Minister referred to  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   have   done  in   respect   of   road\r\n\r\nconstruction in the rural areas. Yes, we agree and\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  deny what they have done, but  what  I\r\n\r\nwant  to  say  is  that they have not  been  doing\r\n\r\nthings  in a positive manner. The construction  of\r\n\r\nroads  and  the  installation of  standpipes  were\r\n\r\ncarried  out  to  a great extent  by  the  present\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim who was then the Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational Development. Within a short period of one\r\n\r\nyear  about 300 standpipes were installed. I spent\r\n\r\ntwo weeks working on the job. In the morning I had\r\n\r\nto get up at 6 a.m. to go out with the engineers-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

The remaining  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  work  has  been done by the Urban  and  Rural\r\n\r\nServices   Consultative  Committee.

Now I am  making\r\n\r\nsome  views in this respect. I hope that  this  is\r\n\r\nnot a departure from the debate. What I have been\r\n\r\nsaying is that the Parliamentary Secretary to  the\r\n\r\nDeputy   Prime  Minister  knows  full   well   the\r\n\r\nconditions   in  the  rural  area.  I   hope   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will give him more powers to enable him\r\n\r\nto do some work in the rural area during his term\r\n\r\nof  office.  In the meantime, with the  additional\r\n\r\npowers  he  has, he will be able to do  some  more\r\n\r\nwork  for  the welfare and interest of  the  rural\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me touch upon the\r\n\r\nland and building constructions in the rural area,\r\n\r\nespecially the procedure for applications to build\r\n\r\nhouses.  During the general elections, the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nused  to  promise the people that once t  came  to\r\n\r\npower  it  would  simplify  all  applications  and\r\n\r\nprocedures  for permission to put up  houses.  But\r\n\r\nnow,  as  far as I can see, there has been  little\r\n\r\nimprovement in this line. I am of the opinion that\r\n\r\nthe  Planning Department is closely related to the\r\n\r\nrural  area, because mans parts of the rural areas\r\n\r\nhave been referred to as \"the green belt\" on which\r\n\r\nno  houses  will be allowed. On the one hand,  the\r\n\r\nland in the rural area is not well defined as  far\r\n\r\nas the boundaries are concerned. So when the rural\r\n\r\npeople apply to the Land Office for permission  to\r\n\r\nput  up houses, they are always turned down by the\r\n\r\nPlanning  Department because there is  a  lack  of\r\n\r\nland.  Now,  if  a piece of land is  not  defined,\r\n\r\nwell, there will be no\r\n\r\nroads. It does not mean that inside the land there\r\n\r\nis  no  system of roads. If this situation is  not\r\n\r\nimproved, then the\r\n\r\nrural  people  will  find  it  difficult  to   get\r\n\r\npermission  to  put up attap huts. The  procedures\r\n\r\nregarding  such applications should be  simplified\r\n\r\nas  far as possible. It is the stand of the United\r\n\r\nPeople's\r\n\r\nParty which has not changed at all.

In\r\n\r\nthat  speech  he  gave us three forecasts  of  fine\r\n\r\nweather  ahead.  The  first  was  that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  would build up a climate of  confidence\r\n\r\nfor  great  expansion  and industrial  growth.  The\r\n\r\nsecond  forecast was that there would be  political\r\n\r\nstability since the Party in power held 43  out  of\r\n\r\n51  seats  in the Assembly. The third forecast  was\r\n\r\nthat  there would be no industrial unrest;  instead\r\n\r\nthere would be industrial peace with justice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at that time the Opposition was very small\r\n\r\nin  number, but we warned the Government that there\r\n\r\nwould  be  hidden rocks ahead, that there would  be\r\n\r\nunseen dangers- \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Thirteen unseen rocks!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> - and that there might be\r\n\r\nstormy  weather. Sir, at that time the  Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis were Members of  the  Government  Party.  Today  the hidden rocks  have  become\r\n\r\nvisible.  Today, the three weather  forecasts  have\r\n\r\nproved  to  be  wrong.  Instead  of  a  climate  of\r\n\r\nconfidence,  we have today a climate of uncertainty\r\n\r\namong  the  people. Instead of political  stability\r\n\r\nas  promised,  there is now great instability,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Government  majority has been reduced  to  one\r\n\r\nvote.  Instead of industrial peace,  there  is  now\r\n\r\ngrave   industrial  unrest  and  an   epidemic   of\r\n\r\nstrikes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now see Singapore becoming a veritable battle-ground of two contending groups of trade unions - an\r\n\r\nunfortunate  state of affairs which the  Government\r\n\r\nseems  unwilling  to tackle vigorously.  Apparently\r\n\r\nthings have been allowed to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngo  on  indefinitely. Under the circumstances,  no\r\n\r\nwonder  the tone ,in the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's\r\n\r\nspeech  this  year  is  no longer  optimistic  but\r\n\r\ninstead is a very cautious one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government now talks about two roads - the main\r\n\r\nhighway  leading to peace and prosperity, and  the\r\n\r\nsidepath leading to disunity, to chaos and to  economic  ruination. Sir, we contend that we are  not\r\n\r\nat  the crossroads. We contend that since 1959 the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  have  been  led  down  that\r\n\r\nsidepath to chaos and economic ruination. Sir,  we\r\n\r\nhold  both the P.A.P. and the Barisan responsible.\r\n\r\nThey misrepresented the sidepath then as being the\r\n\r\nmain highway. And today, instead of having greater\r\n\r\npeace, unity and prosperity, we are already  in  a\r\n\r\nserious  state of affairs. We are not  facing  the\r\n\r\ncrossroads.  We are not facing a political  crisis\r\n\r\nor  economic crisis. We are now in the midst of  a\r\n\r\npolitical  and an economic crisis. I am  sure  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. now agrees, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of unemployment has been soft-pedalled. We know, and all political Parties know,\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  facing  a very  grave  situation  as\r\n\r\nregards  the  unemployment problem. The  Government\r\n\r\nhas  seen fit, while mentioning the seriousness  of\r\n\r\nthe  situation, to underplay it and say that it has\r\n\r\nbeen  partly alleviated by the present boom in  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  industry.  Employment  figures  in   that\r\n\r\nindustry  show  that the number of people  employed\r\n\r\nhas   not  reached  the  level  of  that  in  1957.\r\n\r\n[Interruption]  We  will come  to  that,  Sir.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment    has   decided   that,    under    the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  it  is  impossible  to  solve   the\r\n\r\nunemployment   problem   without   remedying    the\r\n\r\npolitical situation. We are not allowed to touch on\r\n\r\nthe  question  of merger, Sir, and so  I  will  not\r\n\r\nrefer  to  that.  But in the Four-Year  Development\r\n\r\nPlan,   they  did  say  that  under  certain   very\r\n\r\nfavourable   circumstances  described   as   \"under\r\n\r\nconditions  of maximum acceleration\" the Government\r\n\r\nhoped  to  solve  this problem by inducing  private\r\n\r\ninvestors to invest to the tune\r\n\r\nof   $600  million  to  provide  jobs  for  30,000\r\n\r\nworkers.  The rate estimated would be $20,000  per\r\n\r\njob  per  worker.  Sir, that is the  target  which\r\n\r\nunder the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npresent  circumstances we know cannot be  achieved,\r\n\r\neven  in the next two years. If the conditions were\r\n\r\nas  in  the  Federation, one  could  say  that  the\r\n\r\ntarget  could  be achieved. But under  the  present\r\n\r\nconditions,  what  do we see? Instead  of  maximum\r\n\r\nacceleration,  we might describe the conditions  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  those  of  maximum  retardation  and\r\n\r\nfriction,  because  in the struggle  for  political\r\n\r\npower  between the Barisan group and the Government\r\n\r\ngroup,  the welfare, the livelihood, the prosperity\r\n\r\nof  the  people have become subordinated.  This  is\r\n\r\nmost  unfortunate, because the situation is  really\r\n\r\ngrave  and almost desperate. When we think  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  of  Singapore, people  have  not  realised\r\n\r\nthat  we must think not in terms of the workers  in\r\n\r\nemployment   only  but  also  of  the  workers   in\r\n\r\nunemployment  and  those  leaving  school   seeking\r\n\r\nemployment.    According   to   the    Government's\r\n\r\nestimate,  there  will be in  1964  something  like\r\n\r\n83,600  unemployed.  Sir,  I  believe  this  is  an\r\n\r\nunderestimate. Very likely the figure is very  near\r\n\r\n100,000  or even more. It has not been realised  by\r\n\r\nmany  people that there is another picture somewhat\r\n\r\nhidden,  and  that  is that the number  of  workers\r\n\r\nemployed  has since 1957 been reduced by  something\r\n\r\nlike  15,000. I shall be quoting figures to support\r\n\r\nthis.  So we have a double picture of this tragedy.\r\n\r\nOne,  employment since 1957 becoming less and  less\r\n\r\nand  less;  more  and  more being  retrenched.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  in  the queue of unemployed seeking  employ\r\n\r\nment  increasing  year  by  year  because  of   the\r\n\r\nthousands coming in from the schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. M.

In the  1960\r\n\r\nAnnual  Report  of  the Labour Department,  Command\r\n\r\nPaper  24  of  1961, the total number  of  employed\r\n\r\nworkers  in  Singapore  was  123,000  in  1957.

We\r\n\r\nhope  building  construction  will  increase  in\r\n\r\nvolume as the years go on. The figures, however,\r\n\r\nfrom  1957  have  been  very  discouraging.

In 1957,  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party took\r\n\r\ncontrol  of the City Council. A new factor  came\r\n\r\ninto  the scene. Less workers in employment.

I am trying\r\n\r\nto  show  that  this political  instability  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  so  long as the tiger is being  treated\r\n\r\nlike a pussy-cat. If the Barisan leader is trying\r\n\r\nto  treat  it in the way the Prime Minister  did,\r\n\r\nthen  he may regretfully meet with the same fate.\r\n\r\nI  was  trying to show that he, being  a  doctor,\r\n\r\nmight  try  another  method,  to  chloroform  the\r\n\r\ntiger,  but in the struggle, the stopper  of  the\r\n\r\nchloroform bottle might get loose and the  doctor\r\n\r\nhimself  become chloroformed. I am  glad  to  see\r\n\r\nthat   Members  of  the  Government   know   from\r\n\r\nexperience that this can happen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Stamford made a statement\r\n\r\nwith  which  we  wholeheartedly agree.  She  said\r\n\r\nthere  are women who want employment in order  to\r\n\r\nsecure bread and freedom. The only thing is  that\r\n\r\nshe  limited that freedom to freedom so that  the\r\n\r\nwife could be independent of the husband. Sir,  I\r\n\r\nam  sure,  in  fairness to husbands,  she  should\r\n\r\nallow  the  same  freedom  to  the  husbands.  In\r\n\r\npolitical  life  the same principle  holds  good.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  want  bread and freedom for  ourselves,\r\n\r\nwhether we are in a community or in a party or in\r\n\r\na nation, we must concede that there must be also\r\n\r\nthe same desire to allow bread and freedom to  be\r\n\r\navailable  to  people of other  groups,  even  to\r\n\r\nother  political Parties, and other  communities.\r\n\r\nIn that spirit democracy will prevail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now touch very briefly on certain\r\n\r\naspects   in   the   policy  statement   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. First, on housing. Few people realise\r\n\r\nthat  whenever  private enterprise  builds  three\r\n\r\nhouses in the city area, one house is donated  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government, and for every four houses  built\r\n\r\noutside  the  city  area,  another  goes  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. So that by encouraging private people\r\n\r\nto  build,  workers to own their own houses,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  lightening the burden  that  they\r\n\r\ncould  carry  themselves.  No  doubt  they   have\r\n\r\nremoved the development charges, but I have  been\r\n\r\ntold that they have increased the deposits to the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npoint  where they will become a deterrent. I  hope\r\n\r\nthe Government will look into this matter because,\r\n\r\nif  it is their desire to encourage housing,  here\r\n\r\nis  one way by which they can encourage it. Let us\r\n\r\nremember that Government will be benefiting in the\r\n\r\nlong  run  not only through houses,  as  they  are\r\n\r\ndonated  to them, but by way of increased revenue,\r\n\r\npayment of light, water and other charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on education, I understand the Government\r\n\r\nis   thinking  of  building  multi-storey  primary\r\n\r\nschools,  and that the first one will  be  in  the\r\n\r\nSelegie Road area and there will be 7 storeys - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Ten.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Ten storeys. This has been\r\n\r\ntried  in certain cities. When f was in New York  I\r\n\r\nremember being shown a very tall building and  they\r\n\r\nsaid  that  was a school. Sir, I hope the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  taken  all  precautions to prevent  accidents,\r\n\r\nbecause young children, being thoughtless, are  apt\r\n\r\nto  push  one another and there have been instances\r\n\r\nwhere  small  children  have  been  pushed  out  of\r\n\r\nwindows.  Luckily, in these particular cases,  they\r\n\r\njust  fell  to ground level, about six feet  below.\r\n\r\nPrecautionary  measures  would  require  wire  mesh\r\n\r\nover windows. Another thing is the lift, lifts  are\r\n\r\nliable  to  go wrong. I hope there will be  liftmen\r\n\r\nprovided.  We  cannot expecct  young  children  to\r\n\r\nknow  all  these  things. After one experiment, if\r\n\r\nthe  results  are  not proved to be  very  good,  I\r\n\r\nwonder  if  the Minister will reconsider the  whole\r\n\r\nthing   and  have  multi-storey  secondary  schools\r\n\r\nrather  than  primary  schools,  because  secondary\r\n\r\nschool   boys  can  always  have  their  games   on\r\n\r\nplaygrounds  sited  a  distance  away  from   their\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Government carry out their policy\r\n\r\nof  having  the good boys in schools  in  the  city\r\n\r\narea  and  the  failures in schools  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas,  great hardship will befall parents who  are\r\n\r\nunable  to  pay  the extra transport  involved  and\r\n\r\nthey are now being forced through circumstances  to\r\n\r\nlook  for  private schools in the city area.  Under\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ncircumstances,   it  may   be   wise   for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to reconsider the present  policy  of\r\n\r\nactually   killing   the  private   schools   by\r\n\r\nallowing those private schools which are  up  to\r\n\r\nthe  right  standard to carry on,  because  they\r\n\r\nare  also playing a useful part in solving  this\r\n\r\nproblem of education over here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the Government policy of\r\n\r\nbuilding  more  and more State schools  so  that\r\n\r\nthey exceed the number of aided schools, I think\r\n\r\nit is only right that the Government should bear\r\n\r\nthe  greater  responsibility. But  let  us  also\r\n\r\nremember  that it is important to  provide  keen\r\n\r\ncompetition for the Government schools  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  standard will not be lowered. Sometimes the\r\n\r\nspirit  of  free enterprise does more  than  the\r\n\r\nState  can  do.  The  parents'  wishes  must  be\r\n\r\nconsidered so that where they want to have their\r\n\r\nchildren sent to certain schools to the  private\r\n\r\nor  aided Chinese middle schools - there should\r\n\r\nbe  no  attempt  made to prevent them.  In  such\r\n\r\ncases  our  Barisan friends will  not  have  any\r\n\r\ncause  to complain because, after all,  we  must\r\n\r\nallow  the  parents to decide to  which  schools\r\n\r\nthey want to send their children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.34 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I do not wish to spend too  much\r\n\r\ntime  on  the policy statement of the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara.

Just  now\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Havelock described the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment as feudalistic and Singapore as a slave.\r\n\r\nThis,  l  think, will not do any good in regard  to\r\n\r\nthe   unification  of  the  peoples  of   the   two\r\n\r\nterritories.  In  fact, such a  statement  will  be\r\n\r\ndiscarded by the peoples of the two territories.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as regards the\r\n\r\nachievements  of  the Government  in  the  past  21\r\n\r\nyears,  many of my colleagues have already  touched\r\n\r\nupon  them  in  some detail.

Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh has attacked the Government and described the\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade as a concentration camp. He  mentions\r\n\r\nhow members of the Work Brigade are restricted. But\r\n\r\nhe forgets that, in the past, he was all praise for\r\n\r\nthe  Work  Brigade  soon after  its  inception  and\r\n\r\nestablishment. So you find a lot of contradictions\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nin  the  Member for Toa Payoh. He is a man  of  no\r\n\r\nprinciple. It seems be has forgotten that when  he\r\n\r\nwas  responsible for the Work Brigade, he made use\r\n\r\nof  his  position  and power  to  give  favourable\r\n\r\npositions  to  those in whom he had trust  and  to\r\n\r\nthose  who followed him. Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe Work Brigade has come to the present situation\r\n\r\nof  turmoil and trouble and I think the Member for\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh has a certain responsibility  for  this\r\n\r\nstate of affairs. Can he deny he has agitated  the\r\n\r\nrebellious  members to form a union? The  Chairman\r\n\r\nof  their Action Committee is an important  leader\r\n\r\nin  Geylang  East.  The Barisan  Sosialis  Members\r\n\r\nthink  that by going through their stooges in  the\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade they can agitate members in the Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  to form a union to go against the  Govern\r\n\r\nment,  so that they Work Brigade will be dissolved\r\n\r\nas  a result of their activities. But the facts of\r\n\r\ntoday  have shattered their beautiful dreams.  All\r\n\r\nthe 10 camps of the Work Brigade have come back to\r\n\r\nnormal.  About  1,600 members are  now  leading  a\r\n\r\nnormal  life  of  discipline and doing  collective\r\n\r\nwork.  So the plot of the Barisan Sosialis leading\r\n\r\nto  the dissolution of the Work Brigade has failed\r\n\r\nmiserably.  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we  have  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility to reveal the sins  and  crimes  of\r\n\r\nthe rebellious members of the Work Brigade and the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis. Because of their foolish act  to\r\n\r\ndefy  authority, some 300 innocent members of  the\r\n\r\nWork Brigade have suffered. Members of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis must be responsible for this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Toa Payoh\r\n\r\nhas  smeared the Work Brigade without any  grounds\r\n\r\nat all. It is really shameless of him to make such\r\n\r\nan  attack and smear. There is no need for  us  to\r\n\r\nrefute him at all. He says men of the Headquarters\r\n\r\nin  the  Work Brigade, when going round the camps,\r\n\r\nfound   magazines   published   by   the   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity Society, namely, the Torch, but we have\r\n\r\nnot  discovered any such magazines. What  we  have\r\n\r\ndiscovered are some applications for membership of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis. So you can see the intention\r\n\r\nof the Barisan\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSosialis  in the Work Brigade. Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  because the Members of the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave tried to do something about the Work Brigade,\r\n\r\nI know they are now in a state of desperation. Let\r\n\r\nme  remind them that the Work Brigade of today  is\r\n\r\nfully supported by the broad masses of the people.\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis Members have talked at length and\r\n\r\nmade  irresponsible attacks and criticism  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. They are very naive indeed in so doing\r\n\r\nand  it  is  a matter for regret as far  as  I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned. They are trying their best to do things\r\n\r\nin  their own way in Singapore in order to achieve\r\n\r\ntheir political aims. They just adopt all sorts of\r\n\r\ntactics   to  mislead  the  innocent   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  These  are hard facts  which  we  must\r\n\r\nface.  Why  should  they not lead  these  innocent\r\n\r\npeople  in the right way? Why should they  try  to\r\n\r\nadopt  unprincipled  means  to  mislead  them?  We\r\n\r\nbelieve  Members  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  will\r\n\r\nperhaps  feel  as  sad as we  do  over  the  whole\r\n\r\nsituation  when  they  discover  that  their   own\r\n\r\nchildren   have   been  misled  and   tricked   by\r\n\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Toa Payoh was responsible for the\r\n\r\nWork Brigade before hoe became a turncoat. It  was\r\n\r\nthe  same in those days as it is now. There is  no\r\n\r\none trying to force members of the Work Brigade to\r\n\r\njoin any union. But today, the hon. Member says it\r\n\r\nis  like  a  wartime concentration camp.  This  is\r\n\r\nnonsense.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is my opinion that\r\n\r\nit  is  not  easy to he a fighter of true socialism\r\n\r\nespecially   in   a  place  like  Singapore   where\r\n\r\npolitical  influence  is still  in  existence.  The\r\n\r\npeople  are  quite happy with a peaceful  life;  so\r\n\r\nthey  do  not wish to have radical changes made  to\r\n\r\nthe   existing   system.  In  the   meantime,   the\r\n\r\ncolonialists are taking advantage of this  weakness\r\n\r\nof  the  people. They are trying to perpetuate  the\r\n\r\nexistence of this social system in order to  obtain\r\n\r\nbenefits  for  themselves. We  are  aware  of  this\r\n\r\npresent   phenomenon  and  so   are   the   Members\r\n\r\nopposite. When anti-colonial people have some\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npower, it is easy for them to be influenced by the\r\n\r\ncolonialists.  The Members in the Opposition  were\r\n\r\nat  one  time champions for the cause of the  poor\r\n\r\npeople but when they came to power, they just  did\r\n\r\nthings  in the interest of a minority. As a result\r\n\r\nof   this,  they  have  not  only  changed   their\r\n\r\npolitical  stand but they have also changed  their\r\n\r\nmode of living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Members in the\r\n\r\nOpposition   have  made  criticisms  against   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  today. In their criticisms  they  have\r\n\r\nranged  from the important question of  merger  to\r\n\r\nthe  question  of primary schools. All  they  have\r\n\r\nsaid  boils  down to this, that the Government  is\r\n\r\nalways wrong, but they have never pointed out  how\r\n\r\nand  where  we  have been wrong. They  have  never\r\n\r\nsuggested how things should have been done.  I  am\r\n\r\nof  the opinion that if the Opposition Members are\r\n\r\nmen  with conscience, who have the interest of the\r\n\r\npeople  at  heart, they should not play  political\r\n\r\ngames to distort the policies of the Government in\r\n\r\nthis House. They should sincerely try to work  for\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore. It is only  right  that\r\n\r\nthey should work for the welfare of the masses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is getting  late  now\r\n\r\nand  therefore  I will cut off two-thirds  of  nay\r\n\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this House is debating the third policy\r\n\r\nspeech  of  the Government which was delivered  by\r\n\r\nthe  Yang di-Pertuan Negara.

Ministers, Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries   and   Assemblymen   said   that   our\r\n\r\ncriticisms  on the policy speech and the  examples\r\n\r\nwe  quoted were based on a distortion of facts.  It\r\n\r\nis  regrettable that in the course  of  the  Budget\r\n\r\ndebate,  the  Government have  not  realised  their\r\n\r\npast  year's mistakes. In this connection,  I  wish\r\n\r\nto  make  use of some simple figures to  point  out\r\n\r\nwhere  they have failed. In this year's Development\r\n\r\nEstimates,  a sum of $166.2 million was  voted  for\r\n\r\nthe  Government, but as a matter of fact they  have\r\n\r\nonly  used  $67.8  million up to the  end  of  this\r\n\r\nyear.  It  is only 41 per cent of the total  amount\r\n\r\nvoted.  Therefore,  this year of  construction  has\r\n\r\nbecome  a  year  of disappointment and  a  year  of\r\n\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the past two days, the Government\r\n\r\nMinisters,     Parliamentary    Secretaries     and\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  have stressed in this House  that  the\r\n\r\ncriticisms  put forward by us were groundless.  The\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nNational  Development  also pointed  out  that  our\r\n\r\ncriticisms were based on a distortion of  facts.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to point\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nout who is really distorting facts or ignorant  of\r\n\r\nthe  facts.  The  Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  National  Development  said   that\r\n\r\nagricultural production has increased  because  of\r\n\r\nthe   help  given  by  the  Government  and   that\r\n\r\ntherefore we are able to export our foodstuffs  to\r\n\r\nother  countries.  I do not know  whether  he  has\r\n\r\ninvestigated the real state of affairs or he wants\r\n\r\nto deceive the Members of this House. I would like\r\n\r\nto  point out that what he said is a distortion of\r\n\r\nfacts.  I  wish  to quote from the Report  of  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee on the Agricultural Leases  Bill,\r\n\r\n1961, which was published on 15th May. On page A10\r\n\r\nof  this  Report there is a memorandum  which  was\r\n\r\nsubmitted to this Assembly by Dr Tham Ah Kow - the\r\n\r\nDirector  of the Department of Primary Production.\r\n\r\nThe   Speaker  was  the  Chairman  of  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.  The second paragraph of the memorandum\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A large quantity of eggs, vegetables and fruit,\r\n\r\nhowever,  has still to be imported.

Just   now   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary   was   talking    about\r\n\r\nreclamation  of land in Sungei Boyang.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether  the  Parliamentary  Secretary   has\r\n\r\nrevealed how much the Government has spent on this\r\n\r\nwork  out  of  the total vote in the  budget.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should complete this plan. Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,   when  we  were  discussing   the\r\n\r\nEstimates we pointed how the Government has failed\r\n\r\nin  this  respect but because of the limited  time\r\n\r\nwe, were  not able to do it in detail.  Therefore\r\n\r\nthe whole project to reclaim land is a failure. It\r\n\r\nshould be completed this year and not started just\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation has said that ten years hence the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  will be able to build more schools  to\r\n\r\naccommodate students and then there will not be so\r\n\r\nmany  private schools. I believe what the Minister\r\n\r\nmeant  when  he talked about private  schools  was\r\n\r\naided  schools. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,  can  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government survive to  1964?  We  are  not\r\n\r\nsure,  about  it. However, since the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation has said that ten years\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlater  the  Government can build many  schools  to\r\n\r\naccommodate  pupils,  I  want  to  point  out  his\r\n\r\nintention and motive for saying this. I  got  this\r\n\r\nimpression and I hope the Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister for Education can  reply  to  us\r\n\r\nwhether after ten years there is no need for aided\r\n\r\nschools to exist in Singapore. Does the Government\r\n\r\nthink  that the present aided schools do not  help\r\n\r\nthe   Government  in  solving  the   question   of\r\n\r\nvacancies  for  the students? Mr Deputy  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  this  is  a  very serious statement  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does not clarify this  point  clearly,\r\n\r\nwhether  by  aided schools in Singapore  it  means\r\n\r\nChinese,  English  and Tamil  schools.  All  along\r\n\r\nthese  aided  schools in the past 100  years  were\r\n\r\nsupported  by  people  who  gave  money  to  these\r\n\r\nschools.  Especially under the colonial rule  they\r\n\r\nwere  struggling to exist, to carry on  to  expand\r\n\r\nnational education. According to what the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education has said, does the Government think\r\n\r\nthat  ten years later all these schools will  have\r\n\r\nto  be closed down? Does the Government think that\r\n\r\nthey want to take back all these aided schools ten\r\n\r\nyears later? On this point I hope the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation or his Parliamentary Secretary can  give\r\n\r\nus clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from the whole content\r\n\r\nof  the  policy speech, we can see that next  year\r\n\r\nthere  will  not be any development in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  that the development next year is only a  con\r\n\r\ntinuation  of  what the Government is  doing  this\r\n\r\nyear. The whole policy speech as delivered by  the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara, has been described by  our\r\n\r\nleader  as  a  collection of reports from  various\r\n\r\ndepartments and are then later submitted  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  Many  projects which were  mentioned  last\r\n\r\nyear do not appear in the policy speech this year.\r\n\r\nFor  example, in the labour sphere last  year  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara said that the Trades Union\r\n\r\nBill would be tabled after amendments, but in  the\r\n\r\nwhole  policy speech this year we do not  see  any\r\n\r\nindication that the Government is going  to  table\r\n\r\nthis Bill. Does it mean that the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nis  going  to  give up its policy of unifying  the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the political stability\r\n\r\nand  economic  expansion of a  country  depend  on\r\n\r\nwhether the Government has met the demands of  the\r\n\r\npeople materially and spiritually. As regards  the\r\n\r\nmaterial demands of the people, my colleagues have\r\n\r\nmade  very detailed criticisms, and I am not going\r\n\r\nto repeat the arguments here. The people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  cannot  see  any  achievements  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government in the past two years. What  do\r\n\r\nthey  get  from  the  year of  construction?  What\r\n\r\nbenefits do they derive? They have lost their  confidence in the so-called construction work by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as has been fully said\r\n\r\nby  the Member for Bras Basah, the greatest  enemy\r\n\r\nof  the  people  is colonialism. On the  spiritual\r\n\r\ndemands,  what the people want is greater  freedom\r\n\r\nof speech, of assembly, of organisation, and other\r\n\r\nactivities.  All these freedoms are not  mentioned\r\n\r\nin  the  policy speech delivered by the  Yang  di- Pertuan  Negara.  Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore have placed high hopes on  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s fighting for these freedoms. What is  the\r\n\r\nresult?   The  result  is  that  they  have   been\r\n\r\ndisappointed. The P.A.P. Government have  deviated\r\n\r\nfrom  their  stand. Not only have the  people  not\r\n\r\nreceived any material benefits, but they have also\r\n\r\nnot received any spiritual benefits too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, under parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy, if the deeds and words of the Party  in\r\n\r\npower depart from the Party's original stand,  the\r\n\r\npeople will be the first to suffer. Without citing\r\n\r\nconcrete  facts to prove that the Party  in  power\r\n\r\nhas  now  pursued a Right-wing political line,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  prove they are doing so. Now,  I  want  to\r\n\r\nquote  some  of  the speeches made by  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders  to prove that the P.A.P. are now pursuing\r\n\r\na  Right-wing  political line and that  they  have\r\n\r\ngone  contrary  to their pledges made  during  the\r\n\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. has failed\r\n\r\nin construction and has also failed in politics.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>9.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to save the time of this House, I do not\r\n\r\nintend to quote old newspapers and magazines.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  after carefully  listening  to  my\r\n\r\nspeech,  I  believe  you will understand  why  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore are not satisfied  with  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Why has the P.A.P. lost the confidence  of\r\n\r\nthe  people?  Why is the policy speech  empty  and\r\n\r\nvague?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 31st May, 1956, at the\r\n\r\nJoint   Conference   of  the   Central   Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee  and  the branches, the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We must point out that what we want is only\r\n\r\ninternal  self-government. But we must  not  allow\r\n\r\nthe  British  to control our State, to  manipulate\r\n\r\nour military and economic activities.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>In 1958, the leader of the Party, in the Fourth\r\n\r\nSouvenir of the P.A.P. said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'1958 saw the end of a historical stage in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and in this coming year, Singapore will\r\n\r\nget internal self-government. There will\r\n\r\nbe   a   popularly  elected  government  and   the\r\n\r\npolitical status of Singapore will become a  semi-colony. However, defence and foreign affairs  will\r\n\r\nstill   be  in  the  hands  of  the  colonialists.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  cannot say that our  campaign  for\r\n\r\nindependence will come to an\r\n\r\nend.'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from these speeches by the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister,  we\r\n\r\ncan  discern  clearly  our present  mission.  Both\r\n\r\nspeeches  also show us the political situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, namely, that Singapore is still a semi-colony.  We still do not have full internal  self-government.  We  must carry on with  our  struggle\r\n\r\nagainst colonialism.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government has\r\n\r\ndiscarded the anti-colonial fighters and  has  come\r\n\r\nto  a compromise with the colonialists.

He said:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Today [meaning Labour Day] we are happy because\r\n\r\nthe  workers in Singapore are awakened  now.  They\r\n\r\nknow  how  to use their strength to improve  their\r\n\r\nliving  conditions.  We have proved  that  we  are\r\n\r\nunited.'\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>He also said:\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Today the workers are still living in a\r\n\r\nmiserable  condition. They are not free.  Even  on\r\n\r\nthis  day there are five or six strikes staged  by\r\n\r\nthe workers. Do you think that we workers like  to\r\n\r\nstrike?  No.  A strike is the last weapon  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  The workers are compelled to  strike  by\r\n\r\nthe  big-bellied capitalists. These  strikes  show\r\n\r\nthat  the  people  are  still  living  in  a  very\r\n\r\nwretched  condition. We appeal to all  workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  support  the  workers  who  are  on\r\n\r\nstrike.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Do you think that we have democracy when we can\r\n\r\nmeet here? This democracy is only a bluff. In  the\r\n\r\nday-time you can hold a meeting, but at night  you\r\n\r\ncannot  hold  a  meeting. All of us must  remember\r\n\r\nthat  the Emergency Regulations are still  hanging\r\n\r\nover  our  heads. Without the abolition  of  these\r\n\r\nEmergency Regulations, we are not able to  improve\r\n\r\nour living standards.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on 1st July, 1959, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in his policy\r\n\r\nspeech to this House said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The best way of ensuring industrial peace is to\r\n\r\nencourage  workers  and  employers  to   use   the\r\n\r\nmachinery  of  collective  bargaining  instead  of\r\n\r\ntaking direct industrial action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This implies strengthening workers' organisations\r\n\r\nso  as to enhance their bargaining position vis-a-vis  the employers. This means the emergence of  a\r\n\r\nunified labour movement.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, during the 1959 election,  what\r\n\r\nwas the labour policy of the P.A.P.? They said  we\r\n\r\nmust  have a strong trade union movement so as  to\r\n\r\nbe  able  to safeguard the interest of the people.\r\n\r\nIn  order to achieve this aim, we must revise  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C.  Constitution or absorb the T.U.C. into  a\r\n\r\nnew  organisation. Mr Speaker, Sir, our Prime Minister  was  shouting  that  the  workers  must  be\r\n\r\nunited. We must support the workers\r\n\r\non strike. We must abolish the Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations. How fine and beautiful are these\r\n\r\nphrases! How progressive are these phrases! But\r\n\r\nnow when the\r\n\r\nworkers are forced to strike, he says these\r\n\r\nstrikes are political strikes. When\r\n\r\nworkers support the strikes, he says the workers\r\n\r\nare inspired by the Communists.\r\n\r\nWhen workers demand unification of the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntrade  union  movement, he  says  the  trade  union\r\n\r\norganisations  are  heavily  infiltrated   by   the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  When people ask for the  abolition  of\r\n\r\nthe   P.P.S.O.,  he  says  this  is   because   the\r\n\r\nCommunists are afraid of the P.P.S.O. When  workers\r\n\r\ndemand  the  cancellation of yellow  trade  unions,\r\n\r\nthe  Government dissolve the Trades Union  Congress\r\n\r\nand  openly support the, splinter trade unions. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, in the past workers were  forced  to\r\n\r\nstrike.  But  what about now? Are the workers  glad\r\n\r\nof  striking? In the past the workers were told  to\r\n\r\nbe  united. What about now? Is there any reason why\r\n\r\nthey   should  not  be  united  now?   Should   the\r\n\r\nGovernment be allowed to dissolve the Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress?  I  hope the Government and the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof Labour can answer these questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Emergency Regulations are a\r\n\r\nmeans    of    suppressing   the   anti-colonialist\r\n\r\nfighters.  When the P.A.P. was formed in 1954,  the\r\n\r\nabolition of these Regulations was also one of  the\r\n\r\nobjectives  of  the P.A.P. When  the  P.P.S.O. was\r\n\r\ntabled  in  this  House, the  Prime  Minister  both\r\n\r\noutside  and inside this House opposed it. All  the\r\n\r\nprogressive   organisations   in   Singapore   also\r\n\r\nattacked it. They held several meetings to  protest\r\n\r\nagainst  it. Perhaps you can recall that  when  the\r\n\r\nP.P.S.O. was  debated in this House,  many  people\r\n\r\noutside  this Assembly wore black bands and carried\r\n\r\nbanners  to protest against it. In this  House  the\r\n\r\npresent   Prime  Minister,  then  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar,  also attacked the unreasonableness\r\n\r\nof  this Bill. What about now? The P.A.P. not  only\r\n\r\ndoes  not want to repeal the P.P.S.O., but it  also\r\n\r\nextends it to five years instead of one year for  a\r\n\r\nreview.  Should this be done by a socialist  Party?\r\n\r\nThe  Prime Minister, when he attacked the P.P.S.O.,\r\n\r\nwas a non-Communist socialist-\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

It is  completely\r\n\r\nirrelevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  what  I want to ask the Government  is  that\r\n\r\nthey  should  release the political  detainees  as\r\n\r\nsoon    as   possible   without   any   conditions\r\n\r\nwhatsoever. Mr Speaker, Sir, in order  to  assist\r\n\r\nyou  in understanding my argument, I must say that\r\n\r\nmy  argument  is based on what the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  said  before.  In this way,  I  will  not  be\r\n\r\naccused by the Government as being a Communist. It\r\n\r\nwas  the  Prime  Minister himself who  claimed  in\r\n\r\nthose days that he was a non-Communist socialist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are greatly disappointed in\r\n\r\nthe   policy  statement  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara,  especially in regard  to  the  Employment\r\n\r\nExchange  of the Labour Department. The Employment\r\n\r\nExchange  has this year given jobs to  only  1,400\r\n\r\npeople in Singapore - on the average of less than 4\r\n\r\npersons per day. I am doubtful indeed whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is justified in spending so much  money\r\n\r\nand  energy in running a big organisation such  as\r\n\r\nthe Employment\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nExchange which can give only 1,400 jobs to  people\r\n\r\nin  a  year. Has the Employment Exchange lost  the\r\n\r\nconfidence of the employers in Singapore?  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  employers  in  Singapore do  not  go  to  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Exchange  to get  their  employees.  I\r\n\r\nremember at one time the Government did appeal  to\r\n\r\nemployers  in  Singapore  to  make  use   of   the\r\n\r\nfacilities of the Employment Exchange to get their\r\n\r\nworkers.  In the meantime, it was also the  policy\r\n\r\nof   the   Government  to  get  people  from   the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Exchange to fill Government vacancies.\r\n\r\nBut  today, what we can see is that it  has  given\r\n\r\nonly 1,400 jobs to the people of Singapore. I hope\r\n\r\nit  will truly shoulder its responsibility so that\r\n\r\nmany  people in Singapore who go there  hoping  to\r\n\r\nget  jobs will not be disappointed. In fact,  many\r\n\r\npeople   who  are  registered  in  the  Employment\r\n\r\nExchange  have  to wait for several years  without\r\n\r\ngetting  any jobs. I hope the Minister for  Labour\r\n\r\nwill   be  able  to  get  co-operation  from   the\r\n\r\nemployers as far as possible. He should appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe employers in Singapore to make full use of its\r\n\r\nfacilities  so that more and more people  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to benefit from registration there. In  this\r\n\r\nway the people can have more confidence in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>9.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I will try to do my\r\n\r\nbest to make my\r\n\r\nspeech as short as possible. Since June 1959, when\r\n\r\nthis State began its self-government under the new\r\n\r\nconstitution,  this House has heard  three  policy\r\n\r\nstatements delivered by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\non  behalf of the Government. I am of the  opinion\r\n\r\nthat  of the three policy statements, the  one  we\r\n\r\nheard on 31st of October this year is most void of\r\n\r\ncontent. It is the most hollow of the three policy\r\n\r\nstatements. I have been reading it over  and  over\r\n\r\nagain,  but  I  am unable to find  anything  about\r\n\r\nsocial reforms therein. Apart from the mention  of\r\n\r\nmerger, this present policy speech is the same  as\r\n\r\nthe policy speech delivered by the governor of the\r\n\r\ncolonial government from year to year. Formerly, the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBritish   Colonial  Government   ruled   Singapore\r\n\r\nthrough  a  Governor,  and  the  policy  statement\r\n\r\ndelivered  by  him was mainly concerned  with  the\r\n\r\nconstruction of roads, the building of houses, the\r\n\r\nincrease   of  hospital  beds,  the  building   of\r\n\r\nschools, the expansion of social services and  how\r\n\r\nthe  Government was going to expand the facilities\r\n\r\nof  the  port and telecommunications  and  so  on.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  policy statement  of  the  colonial\r\n\r\nGovernor could never give excitement or joy to the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore, because the people were  just\r\n\r\nnot  satisfied with such things. True  the  people\r\n\r\nrequire houses, hospitals and factories, but  they\r\n\r\nalso  require  democracy and  freedom.  They  also\r\n\r\nrequire  a  thorough reform in the social  system.\r\n\r\nThey  also  want  to shake off the colonial  yoke.\r\n\r\nBased  on  this fact. Mr Speaker, Sir,  you  will\r\n\r\nknow  that  after  reading  the  policy  statement\r\n\r\ndelivered  on  the 31st October by  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara, the people of Singapore are  very\r\n\r\ndisappointed. This policy statement is nothing but\r\n\r\na  slipshod  affair. It has been  rushed  through.\r\n\r\nThis  explains how the P.A.P. Government is trying\r\n\r\nto pin all its hopes on merger. Apart from this-\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already stated time\r\n\r\nand time again that there must be no reference  to\r\n\r\nmerger in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Government\r\n\r\nis  no  longer interested and is no longer capable\r\n\r\nof  dealing  with the day-to-day business  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in Singapore. In the first year of  office\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P.,  there  appeared  in  the  policy\r\n\r\nstatement of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara some  very\r\n\r\ngood phrases which gave joy to the people, such as\r\n\r\nsocial  reforms, political, economic and  cultural\r\n\r\nrevolutions,  etc. It also touched upon  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  under  colonial rule only  a  minority  were\r\n\r\nenjoying  certain privileges. But  in  the  policy\r\n\r\nstatement delivered on the 31st October this year,\r\n\r\nwe  do not find any more such phrases. Perhaps the\r\n\r\nbig  shots  of the P.A.P. are of the opinion  that\r\n\r\nsince  they  have taken office for two years,  the\r\n\r\nsocial reforms, the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npolitical,  economic and cultural revolutions  have\r\n\r\nbeen  achieved. So there was no need  for  them  to\r\n\r\nmention  any  more of such things. In  the  second\r\n\r\nyear  when  the policy statement was  delivered  by\r\n\r\nthe  Yang di-Pertuan Negara, although there  was  a\r\n\r\nlack  of fighting spirit, we must admit that  there\r\n\r\nwas some courage ,on the part of the Government  to\r\n\r\nadmit  that it had made some mistakes and  that  it\r\n\r\nhad  its  own  shortcomings. In this second  policy\r\n\r\nstatement, the Government announced that it  wanted\r\n\r\nto  have  more consultation and understanding  with\r\n\r\nthe  people. But in the policy statement  delivered\r\n\r\nen  the  31st  October this year, this  courage  of\r\n\r\nself-criticism  and this courage to admit  mistakes\r\n\r\nand   shortcomings  no  longer  exist.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership today have changed. They are  no  longer\r\n\r\ncourageous  enough  to  face  their  own  mistakes.\r\n\r\nRecently the P.A.P. has even gone to the extent  of\r\n\r\nputting  the blame on the Barisan Sosialis for  the\r\n\r\nmistakes  they  made.  They described  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis as Communists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, let me\r\n\r\nmake  a  comparison of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's\r\n\r\npolicy  statement from another angle. In 1959  when\r\n\r\nthe  first policy statement was delivered, it  was\r\n\r\nfull   of  confidence  that  the  Government  would\r\n\r\novercome  difficulties. It touched  upon  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government would not hesitate  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout  economic expansion. It also  said  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  not hesitate  to  do  unpleasant\r\n\r\nthings  in  the  interests of the  people.  But  in\r\n\r\n1960, when the second policy statement was made  in\r\n\r\nthe  very  beginning, it stated that the Government\r\n\r\nhad  certain limitations in carrying out its  work.\r\n\r\nIt  even stressed that the existing conditions were\r\n\r\nnot  favourable to the achievement of  a  socialist\r\n\r\nsociety.  Obviously after coming  into  office  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has   met  with  many  difficulties,   but\r\n\r\nunfortunately  the ambition and the  confidence  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government has been lessened a great  deal  by\r\n\r\nhard facts and difficulties. This year we have  the\r\n\r\nthird  policy statement made by the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara.  In this we can see how the Party in  power\r\n\r\nis miserably trying\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  tell  the  people, \"Well, hurry  up.

Mr Speaker, Sir, the policy  statement\r\n\r\nof  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara is nothing  but  a\r\n\r\nstatement  written  on  paper.  Even  then  it  is\r\n\r\ncapable  of  reflecting the change  of  stand  and\r\n\r\nideology of the Party in power in these few years.\r\n\r\nMy  colleagues have already quoted many  classical\r\n\r\nexamples  in  this  House  to  explain  how  these\r\n\r\nchanges  have taken place. They have also  pointed\r\n\r\nout  how this change of stand and thought  on  the\r\n\r\npart  of the Party is not in the interests or  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  the people. I do not wish to  repeat,\r\n\r\nneither  do  I wish to supplement their statements\r\n\r\nattacking the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to tell the P.A.P. Government that\r\n\r\nwe,  the  thirteen  of us in the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nsitting  on  this  side of the House,  are  always\r\n\r\nprepared to support the Government in all sorts of\r\n\r\neconomic  construction and welfare services  which\r\n\r\nare in the interests of the people. We want to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Government to learn from its mistakes and try\r\n\r\nto  turn away from the wrong direction so that  it\r\n\r\nwill go back to the broad masses of the people. We\r\n\r\nalso ask the Government to carry out what was said\r\n\r\nin   the  first  policy  statement,  that  is,  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the  unions and organisations  and  to\r\n\r\ngive assistance to local industry and businessmen.\r\n\r\nWe  want  the  Government to  carry  out  what  it\r\n\r\ndeclared   it  would  do  in  the  second   policy\r\n\r\nstatement, that is, to give assistance to  farmers\r\n\r\nand  carry out a thorough campaign against  yellow\r\n\r\nculture. We also contend that the present Ministry\r\n\r\nof Education should be thoroughly reformed so that\r\n\r\nthe colonial\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neducation  policy  will be discarded.

We\r\n\r\nhope  the  P.A.P. leadership will wake up  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  discard  all its  plots  and  intrigues\r\n\r\nagainst the Left-wing progressive forces.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Paint of clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Let the Member carry on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The strength of\r\n\r\nthe  people  is  invincible.

Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  have\r\n\r\nnothing  praiseworthy to say of the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's policy speech delivered this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>9.57 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on reading\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  policy  statement  presented  to\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  and  read by  the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  on the 31st of October this year, one  most\r\n\r\nlamentable fact comes to light. In the text of  the\r\n\r\nwhole speech, there is not one single reference  to\r\n\r\nsocialism,  nor  is  the word  \"socialist\"  written\r\n\r\nanywhere. For a Party that was swept into power  on\r\n\r\na  socialist platform during the elections,  for  a\r\n\r\nParty  which had written into its Party  objectives\r\n\r\nsocialist   ideals,  such  an  omission   must   be\r\n\r\nconsidered  as  something  very  grave  indeed.  To\r\n\r\nunderstand  why  socialism  is  excluded  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in its third year of office,  one  must\r\n\r\ntrace  the  events that led to the  third  year  of\r\n\r\noffice of the Government. A good way is to go  back\r\n\r\nvery  briefly  and look into the speeches  made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Yang di-Pertuan Negara in the first and second\r\n\r\nyear   of   the   P.A.P.'s  term  of  office.   His\r\n\r\nExcellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, on  the  1st\r\n\r\nJuly, 1959 (Hansard, Vol. 11, col. 6), said in  the\r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This session of the Legislative Assembly is\r\n\r\nanother  step  away from the past.  The  immediate\r\n\r\nfuture is clear and certain. During the next  five\r\n\r\nyears  a Government elected by a decisive majority\r\n\r\nof   the   people  will,  through   peaceful   and\r\n\r\nconstitutional means, take the social revolution a\r\n\r\nstep  further. It is a Government pledged to bring\r\n\r\nabout a more just society.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>In the same speech at column 15:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The P.A.P. Government stands for an independent,\r\n\r\ndemocratic,  non-Communist, socialist  Malaya.  It\r\n\r\ncannot  be  pressured  into  deviating  from  this\r\n\r\nstand.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>It is curious that only a month ago, the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, when he was addressing the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Malaya Students'\r\n\r\nUnion,  deviated from this stand. For in  place  of\r\n\r\nthe  word  \"socialist\",  he  substituted  the  word\r\n\r\n\"nationalist\". And he now  pledges that the P.A.P. Government stands  for\r\n\r\nan    independent,   democratic, non-Communist,\r\n\r\nnationalist  Malaya. These are words  enshrined  in\r\n\r\nHansard and yet the Government does not pay heed to\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving the motion thanking the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  for delivering the speech on behalf of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, the Leader of the House said - I quote from Hansard,\r\n\r\nVolume 11, column 118:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In 1959 conditions have now changed. The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas  led the people of Singapore to obtain  a  new\r\n\r\nConstitution  which provides for complete  control\r\n\r\nof internal self-government in Singapore.'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>He went on to say at column 119 and 120:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The People's Action Party has a positive\r\n\r\nideology. We believe that our ills, the ills of our\r\n\r\nsociety,  can  only he solved on  the  basis  of  a\r\n\r\nsocialist  ideology, and it is because  we  hive  a\r\n\r\nPolitical  belief, we therefore have  a  principle,\r\n\r\nand  having a principle, we have the ability to lay\r\n\r\ndown  a  line of action by which we hope to advance\r\n\r\nour cause and the progress of our society.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Brave  words, Sir! The lamentable fact is that  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister is not here to hear me  quote\r\n\r\nhis words.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second year of office of the P.A.P. resulted\r\n\r\nin  a  speech that is of a slightly different tone.\r\n\r\nIt recognises the\r\n\r\nmistakes of the past, for it says in Hansard,\r\n\r\nVolume 13, Col. 5:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Government does not wish to give the\r\n\r\nimpression  that there have not been  mistakes  and\r\n\r\nshortcomings during the past year.

In some instances, it moved too fast and\r\n\r\nwithout  preparing public opinion  adequately  for\r\n\r\nthe  changes. Some of the legislation resulted  in\r\n\r\ninconveniences  or misunderstandings  which  could\r\n\r\nhave  been avoided by .a little more foresight,  a\r\n\r\nlittle  more consultation, discussion and a little\r\n\r\nmore explanation.'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third speech, Sir, is more a speech given by\r\n\r\na  caretaker Government, for it says at column  12\r\n\r\nof Hansard, Volume\r\n\r\n15, No. 1, last paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For the immediate future, the task of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  to proceed with the  work  already\r\n\r\ninitiated.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Since in the first two years of office very\r\n\r\nlittle has been initiated, by implication, it must\r\n\r\nmean that the Government has\r\n\r\nno intention to initiate anything in its third\r\n\r\nyear of office and it must necessarily mean that\r\n\r\nit is only acting as a caretaker Government in its\r\n\r\nthird year of office. In the first year of office,\r\n\r\nwe saw the Members on the Government Benches - I was\r\n\r\nthen privileged to be\r\n\r\non, their side but now I am privileged to  be  on\r\n\r\nthis   side-speak  arrogantly  with  revolutionary\r\n\r\nfervour. The Prime Minister in Hansard, Volume 11,\r\n\r\ncolumn 373, said these brave words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I say, without the slightest immodesty on the\r\n\r\npart of my colleagues and myself, that we are  the\r\n\r\nonly  group that has the coherence, drive and  the\r\n\r\nconvictions   to   build   something   more   than\r\n\r\nourselves - a democratic, socialist movement  within\r\n\r\na  revolutionary situation . .  .  If  we  do  not\r\n\r\ncontinue  recruiting as we have done in  the  past\r\n\r\nfive  years, then we shall eventually  wither  and\r\n\r\ndie.'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>Further down in the next paragraph, he says:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And you can only recruit if you convince those\r\n\r\nwhom   you   intend  to  recruit  that  you  are\r\n\r\nrecruiting for a worthwhile cause.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me draw one lesson for the Members on the\r\n\r\nother  side.  There is not one single Member - apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the  U.M.N.O.  [that, of course,  means  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A.,  Sir]  Members  who  are  representing   a\r\n\r\nportion  of  the Malay people - who  represent  the\r\n\r\npeople.'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the S.P.A. did not represent the people. But\r\n\r\nnow  they  represent the people because they  have\r\n\r\nsaved  the  P.A.P. The Prime Minister went  on  to\r\n\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They represent a group which is spent, lost and\r\n\r\nexhausted.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThey  do not seem to be very much exhausted  today,\r\n\r\nbecause  when  the Government falls  they  are  the\r\n\r\npeople  who stretch their hands to lift it  up.  He\r\n\r\nthen  had  these  gracious  words  to  say  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition - the same Hansard, column 375:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I tell the Opposition this.

To achieve this  goal,\r\n\r\nthe  statement  makes great play  of  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board, the Industrial  Research  Unit,\r\n\r\nthe  Common  Market  and the Four-Year  Plan.

If   the\r\n\r\nemployer-employee relationship in the  country  is\r\n\r\nnot  stable, all these very nice plans will be  in\r\n\r\nvain.  If the Government is sincere in wanting  to\r\n\r\nindustrialise  the country, it must  pay  heed  to\r\n\r\nstability  in  labour and employer  relationship.\r\n\r\nOne of the important ways of encouraging stability\r\n\r\nin this relationship is to help build up a unified\r\n\r\ntrade  union movement. In Hansard, Volume 13,  the\r\n\r\nthird paragraph in column 8 of the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's   speech,  reference  is  made   to   the\r\n\r\nstability of employer-employee relationship:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A further important factor is stability in\r\n\r\nlabour-employer relationships, for nothing is more\r\n\r\nharmful    to   economic   expansion   than    the\r\n\r\nunpredictable outbursts of industrial strife.'\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. in pursuing its trade union policy\r\n\r\ntoday   is  doing  exactly  the  opposite.  It   is\r\n\r\nsplitting  the trade union movement which  is  just\r\n\r\nbeginning  to  be  unified  and  splitting  it  for\r\n\r\npolitical  purposes.

We on this side of\r\n\r\nthe   House   would   like  to  congratulate   the\r\n\r\nGovernment on stating that the question of subsidy\r\n\r\nto  the  Housing  and Development Board  is  under\r\n\r\nreview.  For we know that in the past, the  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nhouses   were  subsidised,  but  when  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment came into office and started  to  build\r\n\r\ncheap\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhousing  units for the poor people, it  was, then\r\n\r\ndiscovered  that  the  cheap  houses  were  hardly\r\n\r\nsubsidised  at all by Government, for it  was  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  own admission that an economic  rent\r\n\r\nwas  charged for those houses. I believe that when\r\n\r\nthe  Government mentions \"economic rent\", it means\r\n\r\nrent worked on the most economic computation,  and\r\n\r\nif  it  is,  economic it cannot be subsidised.  We\r\n\r\nhave  read today that the Government has seen  its\r\n\r\nmistakes  and  is  reviewing the whole  policy  of\r\n\r\nhousing  subsidy. We look forward to the day  when\r\n\r\nthe  Government will subsidise the poorer people's\r\n\r\nhouses  as  much as the middle-class  houses  have\r\n\r\nbeen subsidised in the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I come to the Ministry of Health. Going\r\n\r\nthrough  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech,  I\r\n\r\nfind it curious that no mention has been made  of\r\n\r\nfamily planning. It cannot be that because I have\r\n\r\nleft  the Ministry that no mention has been made.\r\n\r\nIf  one  refers  to  the Four-Year  Plan  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, the biggest problem of the  State  is\r\n\r\nthe  state  of over-population and the  fast  and\r\n\r\nrapid  growth of the population which i,  a  very\r\n\r\nyoung  one;  and  the absence in  the  Government\r\n\r\npolicy   statement  of  any  mention  of   family\r\n\r\nplanning  and  birth control is surely  something\r\n\r\nvery  serious. It is said in this book, Sir, that\r\n\r\nunless  the population growth is checked,  unless\r\n\r\nfamily planning is properly taught to the people,\r\n\r\nno  amount of industrialisation plans could solve\r\n\r\nthe  Problem  of  the people  of  Singapore.  Yet\r\n\r\ntoday,  I  see the complete absence of this  very\r\n\r\nimportant subject in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's\r\n\r\nspeech.  I  recall, Sir, during the time  of  the\r\n\r\nlast   Government,  when  the  subject  of  birth\r\n\r\ncontrol and family planning was brought into this\r\n\r\nHouse, there was a free vote. The reason was that\r\n\r\nthe  then Minister was a Catholic. Now that I see\r\n\r\nthe  total absence of the subject in this  year's\r\n\r\nstatement, I am very tempted to draw some similar\r\n\r\nconclusions.  However, I  shall  not  labour  the\r\n\r\nHouse with such conclusions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome the Government's intention to enlarge\r\n\r\nthe  Tan Tock Seng Hospital because we know  that\r\n\r\nthere are\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  lot  of people on the waiting list for admission\r\n\r\nto  the  Tan Tock Song Hospital. We know  that  the\r\n\r\nonly reason preventing  the  expansion  of  the  hospital  is  the\r\n\r\nshortage of medical staff and nurses. We have  been\r\n\r\nassured  in  this House by the Minister for  Health\r\n\r\nand  Law  that the situation of the doctor shortage\r\n\r\nis  much  better today. In fact, the  Minister  has\r\n\r\nsaid  that  he  has  more  applicants  for  medical\r\n\r\nofficer vacancies than he has provision for in  the\r\n\r\nBudget to take them in. It is very glad tidings  to\r\n\r\none  who  has been in the Ministry before  and  who\r\n\r\nunderstands  how acute the shortage has  been.  But\r\n\r\non,  the question of the expansion of the Tan  Took\r\n\r\nSeng Hospital, the remedy does not lie only in  the\r\n\r\nrecruitment of doctors. The nursing staff is a very\r\n\r\nimportant  branch of the hospital  service.  It  is\r\n\r\nknown  that there are wards now ready to be  opened\r\n\r\nin  many  hospitals, including the  Tan  Tock  Seng\r\n\r\nHospital,  but  are  not  opened  because  of   the\r\n\r\nshortage  of nurses. We would, therefore, urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to reconsider the conditions of  service\r\n\r\nand the salary scale of nurses and to look into the\r\n\r\npossibility of recruiting more nurses, particularly\r\n\r\nfrom  the Chinese stream, into the nursing service.\r\n\r\nIn  its  first  year of office, the Government  was\r\n\r\nquite successful in recruiting Chinese school girls\r\n\r\ninto  the  nursing school. But today, I  understand\r\n\r\nthat  applications from Chinese school  girls  have\r\n\r\ndropped   very  considerably,  partly  because   of\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction  with the way  and  the  method  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  courses  are conducted  and  partly  on\r\n\r\naccount of other grouses and grudges.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

This is for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  the  Minister for  Home  Affairs  who\r\n\r\nthinks that my request has been frivolous and  not\r\n\r\nworth\r\n\r\nconsidering.

If  we  do,  then we must say categorically,\r\n\r\nwithout qualification, that no restraint from  any\r\n\r\ndemocratic process, other than by the ordinary law\r\n\r\nof  the  land, should be allowed. If a man chooses\r\n\r\nto  carry  a hand grenade or a revolver,  or  some\r\n\r\nother  lethal  weapon, in times when the  Governor\r\n\r\nand  the High Commissioner have proclaimed a state\r\n\r\nof  emergency,  then he takes the supreme  penalty\r\n\r\nthe  law has laid down for him. But if a political\r\n\r\nparty wants to hold an election meeting, or even a\r\n\r\npost-election  meeting after 7 o'clock,  they  are\r\n\r\ntold  : \"We do not believe in democracy after  the\r\n\r\nelection.  We  only believe in democracy  once  in\r\n\r\nfour  years, for one month.\" That is not the  kind\r\n\r\nof  democracy  that you can inspire men  with,  to\r\n\r\nfight  for  and die for. That is not the  kind  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy that is going to make it tick in  South-East  Asia,  if  you tell us that we  can  hold  a\r\n\r\npublic  meeting  in the heat of the  sun  at  four\r\n\r\no'clock or five o'clock when nobody would come  to\r\n\r\nlisten...[He  was speaking on behalf of the P.A.P. then.\r\n\r\nBut a lot of them came to listen to ours, Sir.]..\r\n\r\nwhen nobody would come and listen to us, when\r\n\r\ntherefore  there would be no real  danger  of  any\r\n\r\ndemocratic movement starting, but that  we  cannot\r\n\r\nhold a public meeting\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nafter 7 o'clock, when by the habits of the\r\n\r\nworkers  they  would have returned from  work,  the\r\n\r\nearth  has  got cooler, the walls have got  cooler,\r\n\r\nthe  night is getting mellow and warm speeches  can\r\n\r\nhe  made.

Is there any real doubt that  if  we\r\n\r\nwanted  to  introduce  television,  and  if   the\r\n\r\ncommittee  sitting on it should want to recommend\r\n\r\nit, it should be done by a public corporation?

So if I,  in  my  innocence,\r\n\r\nrepeat  something which the Barisan  Sosialis  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  I  would ask your indulgence. All I can  say\r\n\r\nis  that  it  has not been said by my Party  and  I\r\n\r\nwould like to say it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I go to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's\r\n\r\nspeech, there are one or two matters which I  would\r\n\r\nlike   to   raise  and  which  I  would  like   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to think about. First and foremost,  the\r\n\r\nTamil school teachers for high school. Sir, it  has\r\n\r\nbeen represented to  me  that  there is no possibility of recruiting\r\n\r\nany  Tamil school teachers to teach in a Tamil high\r\n\r\nschool.  There  is  nobody in  Singapore  qualified\r\n\r\nenough to take on the job. Therefore, I would  ask,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Education to consider whether  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  in  keeping  with  the  policy  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   that  qualified  Tamil  high   school\r\n\r\nteachers\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  be allowed to be recruited from  India  in\r\n\r\nthe   same  way  as  the  Government  has  already\r\n\r\nrecruited  a  large number of teachers  of  Bahasa\r\n\r\nKebangsaan from Indonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other one is water. It seems that in\r\n\r\nspite  of all the rains that we have been  having,\r\n\r\nthe  public  still have to be under  a  system  of\r\n\r\nwater rationing. It would seem that even the  gods\r\n\r\nare not pleased with the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> We do not believe in God. We\r\n\r\nare atheists.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Deputy Prime Minister does\r\n\r\nnot believe in\r\n\r\nGod,  so he says. But when the water shortage  hit\r\n\r\nSingapore the Prime Minister said, \"Only the  gods\r\n\r\ncould  save  us.\" And the only way the gods  could\r\n\r\nsave  us,  according to Chinese culture, would  be\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government just to strangle  itself  and\r\n\r\nthat would ease the ire of the gods and more water\r\n\r\nwould flow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one very important matter that has not\r\n\r\nbeen  touched upon by the Government nor  by  many\r\n\r\nspeakers on this side of the House. What  I  refer\r\n\r\nto  was the world-shaking event that was disclosed\r\n\r\nby the Prime Minister in his speech last year when\r\n\r\nhe  moved  the motion of thanks for the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's speech. He said, if  I  remember\r\n\r\nrightly,  that the Communist forces  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwere  building  up.  If  I  may,  Sir,  with  your\r\n\r\nindulgence, quote from Hansard, Vol.  13,  No.  2,\r\n\r\ncol. 54 [3rd August, 1960]. This is what the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister said last year:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Meanwhile, Communist sympathisers and activists,\r\n\r\nwho  had scattered and gone under cover before the\r\n\r\nlast  elections, began the work of regrouping  and\r\n\r\nreorganisation. Over the last 14 months, a  build-up  of their ground strength through ground cadres\r\n\r\nworking  on the workers has been taking  place  in\r\n\r\nthe   trade   union  movement.  These  pro-C.   P.\r\n\r\nactivists  have worked hard to secure the  support\r\n\r\nof the\r\n\r\nrank and file.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when he made that pronouncement last year,\r\n\r\nwe in the Opposition at that time did not have the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis with us; they were on the  other\r\n\r\nside.  We had, of course, the three U.P.P. Members\r\n\r\nwith  us.  We in the Opposition, particularly  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A.-U.M.N.O. Alliance, told the Government that\r\n\r\nif\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey  were really sincere in meeting this  threat,\r\n\r\nthen  the only way for them to do it was to cleanse\r\n\r\nthe  Party  from within, and I gave them  instances\r\n\r\nwhere  the  Party could be cleansed.  I  would  not\r\n\r\nlike to quote from Hansard, Sir, but I think I  can\r\n\r\nremember  what  I  said.  I  said  those  political\r\n\r\nbodies  who were not loyal to the Party  should  be\r\n\r\ndismissed.  The People's Association and  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade   are   Frankensteins   created   by    the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and the Government should  take  steps\r\n\r\nto  see that these Frankensteins do not come out to\r\n\r\ndevour  them. I said a number of other things  too.\r\n\r\nBut  then  the Prime Minister -  it was typical  of\r\n\r\nhim - came along and said, \"This discredited  Member  for Cairnhill, who lost the general elections,\r\n\r\nhas the nerve to stand up here and teach me how  to\r\n\r\nsuck  eggs.\" Look at what happened. Those 12  awful\r\n\r\ndisclosures  over Radio P.A.P. We told  them,  \"You\r\n\r\nsack  these people in your midst.\" \"Oh, no. We  are\r\n\r\na  clean Party. They were comrades of ours. We were\r\n\r\nnon-Communists. We had no Communists. No, we  never\r\n\r\nhad  them.\" But then let us examine those 12  awful\r\n\r\ndisclosures  over Radio Singapore. The  very  first\r\n\r\nthing  they  said was, \"Yes, we had the  Communists\r\n\r\nworking  with us in 1954.\" Yet they deny here  that\r\n\r\nthey  ever  had Communists working with  them.  The\r\n\r\nprevious  Government took action  against  what  we\r\n\r\nthen  did not call Communists - because we did  not\r\n\r\nfeel  that we should call them Communists;  but  we\r\n\r\ncalled them subversionists; people who were out  to\r\n\r\ndestroy the security of Singapore. We had by  force\r\n\r\nof  circumstances  to arrest  them.  What  did  the\r\n\r\npresent  Prime Minister, who was and is the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong  Pagar, do? He sat here and  tabled  a\r\n\r\nmotion  deploring the undemocratic  action  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  He said those were his comrades;  they\r\n\r\nwere   good  fighters;  they  are  not  Communists.\r\n\r\nToday, he has admitted that\r\n\r\nthey are Communists. I never called\r\n\r\nthem that. The Prime Minister called\r\n\r\nthem Communists. Talking of inside\r\n\r\npressures, they have not yet learnt-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> They are behind you now.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in 1959, when they came\r\n\r\nto power, there were 43 of them and we faced them.\r\n\r\nWe  were  happy to face them because we could  see\r\n\r\nthem  and therefore we knew what they were up  to.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for us now, we have 13 behind us and\r\n\r\nwe do not know what is going on behind.

That  today\r\n\r\nwe  have in this debate 13 Barisan Members who ran\r\n\r\ndown  this  Government  more  bitterly  than   the\r\n\r\nprevious  one. More bitterly because some  of  the\r\n\r\nthings were due to some personal hurts which  they\r\n\r\nhad  suffered and the awful disclosures that  they\r\n\r\nhad to make. Yet out\r\n\r\nof  the  13  who  spoke against the Government - I\r\n\r\nlook  through the records and I see that 8 of them\r\n\r\nwere  then speaking against poor me and my friends\r\n\r\nhere -   the Government was good, the  Government\r\n\r\nwas   first-class;  the  Opposition  was   talking\r\n\r\nrubbish  and  all that. Now they have joined  this\r\n\r\nside,  maybe more of them may come over, I do  not\r\n\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us come to these \"awful disclosures\". I\r\n\r\nam  afraid  I  have to speak out very strongly  on\r\n\r\nthis because it would appear that in spite of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that they come out today - I mean, the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister comes out today and openly calls his  ex-comrades  Communists,  Communist  front  men,  Communist  sympathisers.  At  one  time  it  was  the\r\n\r\nlunatic  Left  and  Communist;  now  it  is   real\r\n\r\nCommunist. Yet he says, \"Oh, no, I am not going to\r\n\r\ndo  anything. I am not like that foolish  Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock. He did all those things. We are not going to\r\n\r\nfall  into the trap that we laid for Lim Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nand  into which he fell.\" Sir, I think it is wrong\r\n\r\nof him\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  say such things. If he does not intend to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the security of the country, then he  should\r\n\r\nnot  go out of his way to smear them as Communists,\r\n\r\nfellow   Communists,  and  Communist   front   men,\r\n\r\nbecause   by   openly  calling   them   Communists,\r\n\r\nCommunist  front  men, and Communist  sympathisers,\r\n\r\nand  saying, \"You can have your fun, boys,\" you are\r\n\r\njust  giving encouragement to people who will  say,\r\n\r\n\"Well,  it is all right. I do not mind joining  the\r\n\r\nCommunist ranks now because the Government  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  do  anything about  it.\"  You  are  just\r\n\r\nencouraging  people to come out and join  them.  If\r\n\r\nthey  are  really  Communists, there  is  only  one\r\n\r\nanswer.  The security of the country is  vested  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  It is the most sacred  duty  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government has to look after. It  is  not  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  say,  \"No. We had slept with  them  since\r\n\r\n1954,  but only last July they came out.\"  At  that\r\n\r\ntime,  I  said you cannot sleep with the Communists\r\n\r\nwithout getting contaminated. Now they say, \"No,  I\r\n\r\ndid  not  get sufficient enjoyment and it  is  time\r\n\r\nfor  me  to go and tell the world.\" It is all  bad.\r\n\r\nThey  have  a Ministry of Culture and that  is  the\r\n\r\nkind of culture the P.A.P. has-\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> No honeymoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> There is another one about the\r\n\r\n\"Plen\".

The Government have admitted now that  when\r\n\r\nthey  were  nearly swallowed by the Communists  in\r\n\r\nAugust  1958 - when  they had six Communists  versus\r\n\r\nsix  non-Communists - they did not know what to do.\r\n\r\nBut  then poor me at that time felt that those who\r\n\r\nwere  out  to  damage the security of the  country\r\n\r\nshould  not be allowed to continue to do,  damage.\r\n\r\nSo the previous Government took in five. I want to\r\n\r\nsay  here,  Sir, since all these awful disclosures\r\n\r\nthat  have come out of it, Sir, it was because  it\r\n\r\nwas, felt that perhaps if the P.A.P. could be  rid\r\n\r\nof  the Communist stranglehold on them they could\r\n\r\ncome out clean. I knew\r\n\r\nthey could win and come out clean and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrun  the country clean. Instead, immediately  after\r\n\r\ntheir  victory, they said, \"Oh, comrades come out!\"\r\n\r\nThey  released  all  the  eight  before  they  took\r\n\r\noffice.  It  does not matter if they  released  the\r\n\r\neight.  They gave them jobs at $1,100 a  month.  We\r\n\r\nkept  telling them it was wrong, \"Do  not  do  it,\"\r\n\r\nand  they  told  us to suck eggs. Now  they  openly\r\n\r\nadmit  that  they  have  been  sleeping  with   the\r\n\r\nCommunists. They now say that what they  have  done\r\n\r\nother  people should not do. Sir, there are  people\r\n\r\nwho  feel that it is this group of people who  have\r\n\r\nbrought  the  P.A.P. to power and  they  happen  to\r\n\r\nfall out together at the same time. The P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nnow  trying to say that only they had the right  to\r\n\r\nbe  friendly with the Communists. Anyone  else  who\r\n\r\nwants  to  be  friendly with the  Communists,  like\r\n\r\ntheir   ex-comrades,  is  ridiculed,   jeered   and\r\n\r\nlaughed  at.  So  the  P.A.P. could  do  no  wrong,\r\n\r\naccording  to  them.  Fortunately,  Sir,   in   the\r\n\r\nNegara's speech the most important part of  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  settled. So we say that as far as  the  other\r\n\r\npart goes, the Government has failed the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and we will show by our  vote  that  we\r\n\r\nconsider  the Government has failed. Many  previous\r\n\r\nspeakers   have  spoken  on  the  first   year   of\r\n\r\nreorganisation,  the second year  of  construction,\r\n\r\nand  the  third year of liquidation. But I  say  to\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. that the day of their funeral  will  be\r\n\r\nthe  day  of the general election and they will  be\r\n\r\nburied   so   deeply   that   there   can   be   no\r\n\r\nrejuvenation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me, Sir, before, I sit down, to answer the\r\n\r\nunjust attack levelled at us by the Members of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis. One Member who spoke  before  me\r\n\r\nsaid  that the S.P.A. was giving a helping hand  to\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Previously,  there  was  also  another\r\n\r\nMember  of the Barisan Sosialis who said  that  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. and the P.A.P. are going together. Let  me,\r\n\r\nas  leader  of  the  S.P.A., say solemnly  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  that we will at no time have anything to  do\r\n\r\nwith the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And, in fairness, we must say\r\n\r\nthat  there have been no overtures from the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nto us nor\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom  us  to the P.A.P. of any coalition.

In spite  of  all  the\r\n\r\nexposures by the Barisan Sosialis Members, I would\r\n\r\nlike to say that it was we on the Front Bench  who\r\n\r\nwere able to expose certain acts of the Government\r\n\r\nthat  should have been challenged. As a result  of\r\n\r\npressure  from us and with the help of Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition - we were united in this - we got  the\r\n\r\nGovernment more or less to bow down to the  wishes\r\n\r\nof  the Opposition insofar as the 1963 Budget  was\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Toh, in reply.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after\r\n\r\nlistening to Members of the Opposition, I  find  I\r\n\r\nam  now  faced with the task of sifting the  chaff\r\n\r\nfrom the grain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said once before that I am quite prepared\r\n\r\nto  listen to any constructive suggestions made by\r\n\r\nthe  opposite side; but when it comes to  spending\r\n\r\nhours  in  this Chamber listening to  rubbish,  it\r\n\r\ntakes  quite a lot of patience to understand  what\r\n\r\nthe Opposition is driving at.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, I would like, before going\r\n\r\ninto generalities, to answer a few specific points\r\n\r\nraised  by Members of the Opposition and  which  I\r\n\r\nthink   ought  to  be  answered,  because  it   is\r\n\r\nnecessary to dispel any false allegations made  by\r\n\r\nthe other side.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Farrer Park and Cairnhill have\r\n\r\nagain  and  again harped on water  rationing.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park, in particular, asked  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to consider using Johore  River  as  a\r\n\r\nsource of water supply instead of proceeding  with\r\n\r\nthe  waterworks at the Scudai River.  Now  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  that I must place before the House  the\r\n\r\ntrue   picture  of  the  history  of  negotiations\r\n\r\nbetween  the Singapore Government and  the  Johore\r\n\r\nGovernment. In 1927, an agreement was entered into\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Sultan of Johore and  the  Municipal\r\n\r\nCommissioners of Singapore for the use  of  Gunong\r\n\r\nPulai and Pontian as sources of water supply. This\r\n\r\nagreement   expired  in  1948.  In   1952,   fresh\r\n\r\napproaches were made between the then City Council\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Johore Government to renew the use of  Gunong\r\n\r\nPulai  and  Pontian  and, at  the  same  time,  to\r\n\r\ninclude the Tebrau and Scudai Rivers as sources of\r\n\r\nwater  supply. No agreement, however, was  reached\r\n\r\nbetween  the Johore Government and the  past  City\r\n\r\nCouncils.  In 1958 a proposal by the City  Council\r\n\r\nto  the  Johore Government to include  the  Johore\r\n\r\nRiver  in  the  agreement was turned  down.  After\r\n\r\nthis,  nothing  more was heard  about  the  Johore\r\n\r\nRiver.  When  the P.A.P. formed the Government  in\r\n\r\n1959,  we  inherited a situation  where  no  fresh\r\n\r\nagreement  had  been signed between Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe  Johore Government for the extraction of water\r\n\r\nfrom  Johore sources. It was only in October  this\r\n\r\nyear  that  an  agreement  to  use  Gunong  Pulai,\r\n\r\nPontian, Tebrau and Scudai Rivers was signed.  Now\r\n\r\nthat  this  agreement has been signed, the  Johore\r\n\r\nGovernment has agreed to open negotiations for use\r\n\r\nof  the Johore River. These negotiations have just\r\n\r\nstarted. It is not possible to predict when a firm\r\n\r\nagreement  can  be  arrived  at  with  the  Johore\r\n\r\nGovernment for the use of the Johore River. In any\r\n\r\ncase,  any scheme to extract water from the Johore\r\n\r\nRiver  will take four years, costing $50  million.\r\n\r\nIt  is not possible for Singapore to wait for four\r\n\r\nyears  without looking for other sources of  water\r\n\r\nsupply.  The  Government,  therefore,  decided  to\r\n\r\nproceed with the project to extract water from the\r\n\r\nScudai River. It will take only two years, costing\r\n\r\n$20 million. The output from the Scudai River will\r\n\r\nbe  the  same  as  that of the Tebrau  River.  The\r\n\r\nGunong Pulai, Pontian, Scudai and Tebrau Rivers as\r\n\r\nsources  of  water supply should be able  to  cope\r\n\r\nwith  the demand for water until the Johore  River\r\n\r\nWaterworks  Scheme is implemented at  some  future\r\n\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear that it is not that the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government is reluctant to  go  to  the\r\n\r\nJohore River for our water supply\r\n\r\nbut  that  a concession from the Johore Government\r\n\r\nmust  first be obtained. Past City Councils failed\r\n\r\nto obtain this concession, and it is only now that\r\n\r\nthe  Johore  Government has agreed to open  formal\r\n\r\ndiscussions on the use of the Johore River.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Lady from Mountbatten alleged that\r\n\r\nsince  the  P.A.P. took over the Government, food\r\n\r\nprices have gone\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nup.  She quoted from the Malayan Statistics. I have\r\n\r\njust  referred  to  the latest  Malayan  Statistics\r\n\r\ndated October 1961 and nowhere in the Statistics is\r\n\r\nthere  any  indication  that  there  has  been   an\r\n\r\nincrease in food prices. In January this year, ikan\r\n\r\ntamban   (sprat)  cost  41  cents  per   kati.   In\r\n\r\nSeptember, it was 39 cents per kati. Pomfret - which\r\n\r\nthe Member for Mountbatten described as the food of\r\n\r\nthe  bourgeousie - or  what  the  Malays  call  bawal\r\n\r\nputeh,  cost $2.42 a kati in January this year  and\r\n\r\nthe  price in September was only $2.17 a  kati.  In\r\n\r\nJanuary,  the price of rice was $1.25 per  gantang;\r\n\r\nin September, it was $1.29. Poultry cost $1.60 per\r\n\r\nkati  in January and $1.57 in September. From these\r\n\r\nfigures, it is quite obvious-\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Chinese New Year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Still far away as yet.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> January.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> February. It is quite clear\r\n\r\nthat  the  prices  of food have therefore  remained\r\n\r\nmore  or less at a steady level and there has  been\r\n\r\nno  increase  in  the  cost of living.  The  slight\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the price of rice is a reflection  of\r\n\r\nthe  large purchases made by China to cover up  the\r\n\r\nagricultural deficit in that country.  It  is  only\r\n\r\nnatural  that  when  there are competitive  buyers,\r\n\r\nthere is an increase in price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of unemployment is not a new one. In\r\n\r\nfact,  when  we first came to power in  1959,  this\r\n\r\nproblem was very clearly stated, to the people when\r\n\r\nwe  held  a meeting at the City Hall steps  on  2nd\r\n\r\nJune, 1959. The Member for Tanglin has alleged that\r\n\r\nthere has been less employment during the tenure of\r\n\r\noffice  of the P.A.P. Government. However, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  inform the House that his  allegation  is\r\n\r\nfalse.  From figures in the Malayan Statistics,  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  1959,  the  total  number  of   workers,\r\n\r\nexcluding  clerks,  peons, watchmen,  domestic  ser\r\n\r\nvants   and   shop  assistants,  was  106,771.   In\r\n\r\nSeptember  1960,  the number was 105,605.  This  is\r\n\r\nonly  1,000  less  and  is part  of  what  we  call\r\n\r\n\"fiction\"  unemployment, that is  the  workers  who\r\n\r\nchange\r\n\r\ntheir jobs to look for other jobs.

In  fact,\r\n\r\nI  understand  the  President of  this  Court  will\r\n\r\npublish  the Annual Report which will be  available\r\n\r\nby January 1962.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point raised by the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  was  on the terms of service of the President\r\n\r\nof  the  Industrial Arbitration Court. It  is  true\r\n\r\nthat  he  was  appointed on a three-year  contract,\r\n\r\nbut  his  contract of service however does  not  in\r\n\r\nany  way  affect his status or interfere  with  the\r\n\r\nexecution  of  his  duties  as  laid  down  in  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;References have been made by Members of the\r\n\r\nopposition to the Government majority of one.

But  let  me  remind  the\r\n\r\nMembers  that the new Government in Australia  also\r\n\r\nhas  a  majority of one in the House of  Parliament\r\n\r\nand  the  Australian Prime Minister,  Mr  Menzies,\r\n\r\nwho  I think is more experienced than any of us  in\r\n\r\nthis House, has said that he is delighted with  his\r\n\r\nmajority - [Interruption] No. I  would  say  this  to Mr Menzies: we are doing fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much use of the smear has been made by the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis on the use of the military in  the\r\n\r\nrecent City Council strike\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  the trouble in the Work Brigade. Let me  say\r\n\r\nthis  :  the first duty of any government  is  to\r\n\r\nmaintain peace and order. The task of the  police\r\n\r\nforce  is  to  uphold  the  law.  It  acts  as  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent  to  evil-doers. The military  is  only\r\n\r\ncalled  in when backing-up force is necessary.  I\r\n\r\nhope Members of the Opposition are not suggesting\r\n\r\nthat the 800-odd troops in the Singapore Infantry\r\n\r\nRegiment are to be deployed only when there is  a\r\n\r\npossibility  of  a  foreign  army  invading   our\r\n\r\nshores. That would be ridiculous indeed.  One  of\r\n\r\nthe functions of this small military force is the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of internal security. Now, as long as\r\n\r\nworkers  strike  peacefully and do  not  seek  to\r\n\r\ncreate public disorder or damage public property,\r\n\r\nor  intimidate and injure members of the  public,\r\n\r\nwe  leave  them  alone. But  when  any  group  of\r\n\r\npersons  seek to disrupt the peace by a  show  of\r\n\r\nviolence,  then violence must be counteracted  by\r\n\r\nan  equally firm determination on the part of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  uphold orderliness  in  order  to\r\n\r\nprotect the public. No responsible government can\r\n\r\nallow  persons to go on a rampage of  destruction\r\n\r\nthroughout the City. We are not the first to  use\r\n\r\nthe  military  to assist the police  to  maintain\r\n\r\ntranquillity. Previous governments have done it the  Government  of  the Member  for  Anson,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the Member for Cairnhill. In  fact,\r\n\r\nI  can  quote  other instances. When rioting  and\r\n\r\ndisorder  broke out in Little Rock in the  United\r\n\r\nStates  over the question of admission of negroes\r\n\r\nto  schools attended by whites, it could only  be\r\n\r\ncontained by the use of the army. If the  Barisan\r\n\r\nwant other examples, we need only remind them  of\r\n\r\nHungary  and  Tibet.  The employment  of  violent\r\n\r\ntactics  by any group is anti-social and  against\r\n\r\nthe  welfare  of the community. It is  the  first\r\n\r\nduty of any government, be it Left-wing or Right-wing, to uphold peace and orderliness in the  use\r\n\r\nof forces at its command. It gives us no pleasure\r\n\r\nto  deploy the Singapore Infantry Regiment in the\r\n\r\nrecent  City  Council strike as we are  naturally\r\n\r\nexposed to the smear of using armed force against\r\n\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You have earned it.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> But we are not like the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson. As the Minister for Finance has\r\n\r\nsaid,  he was driven from pillar to post  because\r\n\r\nhe  wanted  to make everybody happy. Let  me  say\r\n\r\nthis:  we  will  not  shirk  our  duty  as   a\r\n\r\ngovernment. The House is fully aware that  if  we\r\n\r\nhad not taken prompt\r\n\r\naction,  the violence which appeared in the  early\r\n\r\ndays  of  the  strike  would have  grown  to  such\r\n\r\nproportions as to provoke rioting in the city.  As\r\n\r\nit  turned  out,  the use of armed  forces  had  a\r\n\r\nsalutary effect on a small group of people who had\r\n\r\nmade  up their minds to use violence to intimidate\r\n\r\nnot  only the Government but also members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the P.A.P. fought the general elections in\r\n\r\n1959,  we were the only Party to draw up  a  Five- Year  political programme found in The Tasks Ahead\r\n\r\nto   which   the   13  Members  of   the   Barisan\r\n\r\ncontributed  little  to its thinking.  But  it  is\r\n\r\ngratifying  that the Barisan Sosialis nevertheless\r\n\r\nthroughout  this  debate still make  reference  to\r\n\r\nour   booklet  The  Tasks  Ahead.  In   order   to\r\n\r\nimplement  this  political programme,  we  had  to\r\n\r\nhave  an economic programme. Therefore, some  time\r\n\r\nwas  spent when we formed the Government  in  1959\r\n\r\nto  draft  out the Four-Year Development Plan.  As\r\n\r\nfar  as our political policy is concerned, it  has\r\n\r\nalready  been  enunciated  in  The  Tasks   Ahead.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech\r\n\r\nonly  seeks  to  explain the steps the  Government\r\n\r\nintends to take next year to implement the  Government's  political policy through  its  Development\r\n\r\nPlan.   In   the  implementation  of  a  political\r\n\r\npolicy,  we  have  encountered  difficulties   and\r\n\r\nsometimes even resistance. It may be that part  of\r\n\r\nour political programme is acceptable and part  of\r\n\r\nit  is  controversial.  We  do  not  claim  to  be\r\n\r\ninfallible.  If  we  have made mistakes,  then  we\r\n\r\nmust obviously be told where the\r\n\r\nmistakes are so that we can rectify them. The six-day  week  for English schools, for instance,  has\r\n\r\nnot brought happiness\r\n\r\nto teachers in these schools.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sure of it.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> But if it is the view of\r\n\r\neducationists and parents that this policy  should\r\n\r\nbe  reviewed, we are going to have it re-examined.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  the Minister for Education has  earlier\r\n\r\ntoday  announced that he will set up a  Commission\r\n\r\nof  Inquiry  into the six-day week.  Such  is  the\r\n\r\nparliamentary democratic system which we  hope  to\r\n\r\noperate.  The Government's policy is debated,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's Budget is debated-how much the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister spends,\r\n\r\nhow much the Deputy Prime Minister gets in\r\n\r\nallowances is debated. All this is\r\n\r\ndone  without  fear of reprisal.  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition,  including the Member for  Anson,  can\r\n\r\neither be constructive or destructive.
