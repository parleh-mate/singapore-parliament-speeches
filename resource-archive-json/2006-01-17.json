Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, in terms of pollution, Euro IV diesel vehicles do emit 70% less particulate matter&nbsp;(PM) than Euro II diesel vehicles.&nbsp; However, compared to petrol vehicles, Euro IV diesel vehicles still emit five times more PM than petrol ones.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, our ambient level of particulate matter finer than 2.5 microns, or PM2.5 is 21 ug/m3 which does NOT meet the standards of 15 ug/m3 set by the US Environment Protection Agency (USEPA).&nbsp; If nothing is done, our PM2.5 levels are projected to further increase in the future.&nbsp; PM2.5 is of particular concern to us, as it <p align=left>Column: 2135</p>has been linked by many studies to respiratory diseases such as bronchitis and asthma, as well as heart disease, resulting in increased hospitalisations and premature deaths.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To lower our PM2.5 levels to USEPA standards, my Ministry has announced in April 2004 the introduction of Euro IV emission standards for all types of new diesel vehicles from 1st October 2006.&nbsp; This move is in line with other countries' efforts to impose stricter emission standards on diesel vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the EU and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> have adopted Euro IV or equivalent emission standards for vehicles in 2005 and <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region> will be adopting Euro IV standards from 2006.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As earlier mentioned, Euro IV diesel vehicles, although cleaner than Euro II vehicles, still emit much more PM2.5 than petrol vehicles.&nbsp; This is why we have discouraged diesel passenger cars on our roads through the imposition of a diesel tax.&nbsp; Nevertheless, with effect from <st1:date Month=\"1\" Day=\"1\" Year=\"2006\">1st January 2006</st1:date>, the special tax for Euro IV diesel passenger cars has been reduced from&nbsp;six times their road tax to&nbsp;four times their road tax.&nbsp; This is in recognition of the lower emissions of Euro IV compared to Euro II diesel passenger cars.&nbsp; As cleaner vehicles become available, a carefully balanced mix of different types of vehicles would help us move progressively towards higher standards of ambient air quality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:HDB SERVICE AND CONSERVANCY ARREARS--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Having said that, I should also emphasise that the equipment do meet with safety standards and they are made from materials that do not catch fire easily.&nbsp; We can well understand that if&nbsp;someone wants to set fire to something, then&nbsp;he can set fire to it, and it is really a question of arson.&nbsp; The&nbsp;answer to that kind of a problem is really by public education and&nbsp;enforcement.&nbsp; And when we do catch the people who do these things, they would be subjected to the law so that a clear message&nbsp;would be sent.&nbsp; I would say that we have to proceed in a balanced manner and to see what practical things that we can do on top of the current specifications to further&nbsp;enhance the safety of these equipment.&nbsp; But we should not go overboard&nbsp;and say that because one set of equipment was set on fire, therefore, we should not put the equipment there, because then you are really going to lose a lot of other benefits, such as children being able to play safely in all weather.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

NMP has asked for the number of men who have been abused by their female partners.&nbsp; Since 2002, an average of 260 husbands applied for personal protection orders against their wives every year.&nbsp; There are two specialised agencies that victims of abuse can call for help.&nbsp; They can call PAVe (Promoting Alternatives to Violence) and Trans Centre.&nbsp; PAVe and Trans Centre specialise in helping victims of family violence and perpetrators to stop their abusive behaviour.&nbsp; They also support families to break the vicious cycle of violence.&nbsp; Their services include counselling, group work and practical assistance like helping victims apply for personal protection orders, as well as helping perpetrators deal with their abusive behaviour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are crisis shelters which cater to men.&nbsp; But, so far, only a few have sought help.&nbsp; We encourage people in crisis, whether male or female, to contact any of the 36 Family Service Centres to seek professional advice and assistance.&nbsp; If they are in immediate danger, they should contact the SOS of Singapore or the Police.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for a campaign to promote programmes targeted specifically for men.&nbsp; We have put in place community-based support services, like the Family Service Centre, and would encourage men and women to approach an FSC as a first stop if they need help for themselves and their families, and to approach&nbsp;Trans Centre and PAVe&nbsp;if they are victims or perpetrators of abuse.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:VISIT OF HON.

Note&nbsp;that peritoneal dialysis is cheaper than haemodialysis.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public hospitals have focused on acute haemodialysis with complicated co-existing illnesses.&nbsp;In other words, our patients are much more complicated.&nbsp;For <p align=left>Column: 2153</p>chronic dialysis, public hospitals offer peritoneal dialysis&nbsp;as it is cheaper for the patients.&nbsp; &nbsp;In public hospitals, their CAPD cost, before subsidy, is about $1,300 per month, while the automated peritoneal dialysis&nbsp;equivalent is about $1,800.&nbsp;So for both modalities, the public hospitals' rates are at the lower end of the market range.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry will shortly publish on the MOH website the detailed comparison of the kidney dialysis charges by the various providers in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.

I think it is still running there.&nbsp; So I got to know a little bit about this business.&nbsp; There are indeed many possibilities of cost savings so that you can try to meet the patient's affordability level.&nbsp; Just now I talked about&nbsp;reuse of reagents.&nbsp; Clinically, it is safe and you have some room&nbsp;to play around.&nbsp; You can reuse two times, or you can stretch a bit, four times, and you can bring down the cost significantly.&nbsp; So&nbsp;a lot depends on the doctor's experience with his patients and he can push the boundary. Of course, there are also other possibilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of NKF, my own observation is that&nbsp;a big part of the costs, <p align=left>Column: 2155</p>not a major part, but a significant part of the costs are non-clinical activities, in other words, the administrative side, because they have a very heavy fund-raising component.&nbsp; But&nbsp;the new board has reviewed that particular portion and they have significantly reduced the involvement and&nbsp;the headcount and, therefore, the cost.&nbsp; So that is why I have&nbsp;hinted in my reply just now that they have done the first round, but this is not the end of it and,&nbsp;in fact, I received an email last night from the CEO, Prof. Goh Chee Leok, who told me that there is a possibility of another 10% reduction very soon, within days.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SINGAPOREANS WHO DIED FROM KIDNEY FAILURE--><p align=left>Column: 2155<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</B>:&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;there are many medical reasons why patients with renal failure die.&nbsp; In addition, each year, a small number of them, usually with other serious illnesses, choose not to go on dialysis, after taking into account the quality of life and the many complications that dialysis brings.&nbsp; The ability or inability to pay for dialysis is not a significant factor in the survival of renal failure patients.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pathology and mechanisms of death in renal diseases can be better explained by renal doctors, but the point I want to highlight is that, even under the <st1:country-region><st1:place>UK</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s health system where free dialysis is available on demand, their 5-year&nbsp;survival rate of&nbsp;renal failure patients at 45% is lower than <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s rate which exceeds 48%.&nbsp; Indeed, compared with developed countries, such as the US <p align=left>Column: 2156</p>which has&nbsp;38% 5-year survival rate, the UK and continental Europe, Singapore has the highest 5-year survival rate in its renal failure patients.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, with Government subsidy, Medisave, MediShield and Medifund, all renal patients can access the medical care that they need.&nbsp; Renal patients with financial difficulties are subsidised by the Government.&nbsp; In public hospitals, Government subsidies range from $850&nbsp;to $1,300 per month, depending on the mode of dialysis that the doctor and the patients decide upon.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Medisave covers up to $450 per month.&nbsp; The reformed MediShield pays up to $1,000 per month, while the enhanced Medisave-approved catastrophic illness insurance plans now cover up to $3,000 per month.&nbsp; At $3,000, it exceeds the highest dialysis charge in town.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VWOs also provide subsidies to their patients.&nbsp; Those who are eligible can, in addition, get a Government subsidy, ranging from $200 to $600 per month.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who are still unable to pay despite subsidies, Medisave and MediShield, Medifund provides the final safety net.&nbsp; Last year, 14,000 renal patient applications were supported by Medifund, to the tune of about $2 million.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

One thing good out of the NKF saga is it has focused the mind, at least mine, as well as my colleagues in the Ministry of Health, to rethink this whole issue of how we manage renal failure patients.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think, for many years, because of the success of NKF in raising funds, building and expanding dialysis centres, etc, we just&nbsp;assume that the problem is well taken <p align=left>Column: 2159</p>care of.&nbsp; But it is only in the last few months, as I began to gather data,&nbsp;think through all these and&nbsp;compare with other countries, we stood up like an outlier, whether it is in terms of very low transplantation rate or in terms of very high haemodialysis rate per capita.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So for various reasons, just spending money, raising money and&nbsp;building kidney dialysis centres is not right.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you&nbsp;have too few, you should build.&nbsp; But there is such a thing as over-built. If you ask me, I think we should rethink, and I am reflecting on those issues.&nbsp; Maybe, during March, when I will be more ready during the Committee of Supply discussions, we can devote some time discussing&nbsp;how&nbsp;we should handle renal failure patients.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have already been asking the new NKF Board to think through, in the long-term, as they put themselves in 10 years' time, what they want NKF to be.&nbsp; Is it still more of the&nbsp;same?&nbsp; I hope not.&nbsp; I do not think that is correct or wise.&nbsp; But, instead, we should be pushing&nbsp;other modalities, peritoneal is definitely in, and, of course, live donor transplantation, including cadaveric.&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember two years ago, I came to this House and with Members'&nbsp;support, we amended the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA) which has saved a couple&nbsp;of dozens more lives last year, but those are from cadavers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But live donor transplantation is something that we must push.&nbsp; Norway is quite outstanding.&nbsp; Norway's standard operating procedure - once you have a renal failure patient, the doctor&nbsp;would confront him -&nbsp;it is very natural to ask,&nbsp;which of your relative or friend is going to donate a kidney.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, you have this 70:30 split, only 30% on dialysis, 70% on transplantation. We are a complete reverse.&nbsp; Asian culture value is one; awareness is another.&nbsp; And we have to change that. We cannot achieve it <p align=left>Column: 2160</p>overnight, but&nbsp;let us take our time slowly, so long as it is in the right trend, to promote more.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the public stops donating to the NKF and the NKF reserves become completely depleted, will the Government come up with emergency funds for the NKF to help it sustain its operations until it meets its&nbsp;new objective?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:&nbsp;</B> The short answer is yes.&nbsp; But let me again give a little long-winded reply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NKF is not the only game in town.&nbsp; I think public perception is&nbsp;such that they see&nbsp;dialysis is all NKF, and if NKF&nbsp;collapsed, dialysis collapsed.&nbsp; NKF, after many years, is a major player but is not the only player.&nbsp; In fact, its market share is less than 50%. The rough figures are:&nbsp; about half, NKF; one-quarter, public hospitals;&nbsp;the remaining 20%, private dialysis centres; and 10%, the other charities. So this is the rough market share.&nbsp; But 50% is still&nbsp;a large part of the market share.&nbsp; Should it grow or should it just stay put and let the other players expand?&nbsp; Those are issues that we can discuss in March during the Committee of Supply.&nbsp; I have my own view, you may have different views.&nbsp; But I believe in diversity, and&nbsp;I think the whole healthcare model, including dialysis management, will be a lot more robust if we have multiple players.&nbsp; I am quite glad when I look at even the industry structure today, among the private providers, there are about a dozen of them. So my bottomline is:&nbsp; NKF is not the only name in dialysis, although it may be the most prominent name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But back to&nbsp;NKF reserves, I asked the new management this question a few weeks ago:&nbsp;&nbsp;with your&nbsp;$200-over million reserves, assuming you stop completely your fund raising and, therefore, you could shave a lot of your administrative <p align=left>Column: 2161</p>cost, how long can $200-over million last you?&nbsp; More than 10 years.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker</B>:&nbsp; Ms Olsen, last question.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen</B>:&nbsp; Sir, since the Minister mentioned about Norway,&nbsp;I would like to ask him whether or not studies are being done on comparative countries, ie, countries that do not adopt a free healthcare model, on how they juggle subsidies or how they manage renal failure.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</B>:&nbsp; We have always studied the different healthcare financing models all over, not just for dialysis.&nbsp; But specific to dialysis, I have my own view about how something like this ought to be funded.&nbsp;Renal failure is a catastrophic event. When it hits, it is very bad - disastrous, but low-risk - in fact, measurable risk.&nbsp; On a per capita basis, you can calculate it and it is quite stable. The way to fund those things is really insurance. That is why I spent a lot of time last year reforming MediShield and part of the&nbsp;things that I tweaked was to raise the dialysis claim rates from MediShield&nbsp;and the private MediShield equivalent. And really, the way to&nbsp;handle&nbsp;renal failure patients, whether it is through transplantation or the various modes of dialysis, is insurance.&nbsp; When you are healthy, young and working, please sign on to the MediShield or its private equivalent, so if you are in bad luck, you are one of those&nbsp;few&nbsp;unlucky chaps with renal failure, you have the money for treatment. And when you have the money, you can shop around.&nbsp; My&nbsp;job is to publish the various charges by these one dozen dialysis centres, and then you can pick and choose. Do you want an aquarium next to your couch or you do not want an aquarium, and therefore, slightly cheaper, and so on.&nbsp; That should be the way.&nbsp; But it does not mean that there is no role for charity or Government subsidy.&nbsp;But the main way of funding dialysis ought to be insurance <p align=left>Column: 2162</p>complemented by Government subsidy and charity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked NKF for some data.&nbsp; I said, \"Of your patients, how many are on MediShield?\"&nbsp; And I was greatly encouraged by the data that I got.&nbsp; Now, 60% of their patients are already on MediShield.&nbsp; Not too long ago, 50% and the trend is looking good.&nbsp; I am quite sure that eventually, maybe 70%-80%, and I think we would then reach that&nbsp;logical position of funding dialysis.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS OF WORKERS--><p align=left>Column: 2162<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS OF WORKERS</span></B></div><BR>\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Unfair dismissal--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Unfair dismissal)</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

This is to ensure that our population is protected from known risks.&nbsp; So all our policies are constructed around this primary aim.&nbsp; At the same time, we also want to broaden our import sources.&nbsp; This is to increase our supply resilience because the more&nbsp;we can spread out&nbsp;our sources of supply,&nbsp;the less we are dependent on any one supply, and the disruption such dependence can cause if that supply is disrupted.&nbsp; So we balance between these two.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also review any improvements in technology as well as updates in developments in disease control from <p align=left>Column: 2171</p>these import sources.&nbsp; In my response on the&nbsp;Mad Cow Disease, for example, the approach that we take towards that particular disease, the Member can see that we try to balance the two.&nbsp; And in respect of pork and other such meats and related products from Malaysia and elsewhere, we take the same general approach.&nbsp; We import significant amounts of foodstuffs from Malaysia and we are particularly careful to ensure that this particular supply source provides food that will be safe for our population.&nbsp; This is subject to continual review.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, in the case of poultry, we have moved, through mutual agreement, to a zonal approach.&nbsp; And where we can safeguard that, then it is allowed to be imported.&nbsp; I think under that general approach, further progress can be made as time goes on and as we review developments on both sides.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tan Sze Wee--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

(a)&nbsp; First, the implementation of a new IT system for the registration and licensing of vehicles;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; Second, the introduction of a licensing regime to regulate the operation of bus interchanges;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, amendments to improve the LTA's operational and regulatory effectiveness.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now highlight the key provisions in the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2173</p><p><I>A New Vehicle Registration and Licensing System</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the RTA will be amended to provide for a new IT system, the Vehicle Registration and Licensing System (VRLS), to support LTA's vehicle registration and licensing operations. The new system would leverage on Internet technology to deliver accessible, convenient and integrated vehicle-related electronic services to the motor trade industry, vehicle owners and the public, in the comfort of their homes and offices.&nbsp; The electronic service would accept multiple electronic payment modes, be available outside of office hours, from 6.00 am to midnight daily, and would enable motor dealers to provide one-stop service to their customers when purchasing or selling a vehicle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Bill enables the LTA to provide electronic services for the filing of applications to LTA, for example, for the registration and transfer of vehicles. The electronic services will support the move towards scripless transactions by doing away with the need to issue physical vehicle registration cards, commonly known as \"log cards\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments would allow for the assigning of user accounts to transact with LTA through the new IT system, and for the assigning of authentication codes (ie, the User ID and Password or the Transaction PIN) to these users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LTA would be able to set rules to allow any person, such as motor dealers, authorised Scrap Yard or Export Processing Zone operators, and authorised road tax collection centres to apply to LTA to be \"Electronic Service Agents\" (ESA). As an ESA, they can submit applications, both for their own account or on behalf of their customers, to LTA via the IT system.&nbsp; This is to allow the motor trade industry to provide one-stop services for the convenience of their <p align=left>Column: 2174</p>customers. To protect the interests of consumers, the LTA may suspend or cancel the registration of an ESA if the latter has contravened any provisions of the Act, rules or terms and conditions governing the use of the electronic service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LTA will be providing more details on the roll out of the new e-services, and what the changes will mean for vehicle owners and the motor industry. In essence, the VRLS would be launched in two phases. The Phase One launch would enable vehicle owners to access their accounts and obtain information on their vehicles, Temporary COEs, PARF/COE rebates, and vehicle registration numbers retained or obtained through bidding.&nbsp; For convenience, Singaporeans and Permanent Residents could use their SingPass to logon to the new IT system's \"Vehicle Hub\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Phase One, motor industry users would be able to submit registration, transfer and de-registration applications online for their own account or on behalf of their customers directly to LTA.&nbsp; The transactions would be processed and confirmed immediately if all the necessary pre-requisites, such as motor insurance cover, passing of vehicle inspections, have been satisfied.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Phase Two, more transactional e-services would be made available to vehicle owners themselves, for example, applying for the transfer of their vehicles directly to another individual.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>A licensing regime to regulate the operation of bus interchanges</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 of the Bill introduces a new licensing regime to regulate the operation of bus interchanges. Under the current system, the management and operation of bus interchanges owned by Government are regulated through Licence Agreements signed with the bus and commercial facilities operators. Such a requirement <p align=left>Column: 2175</p>cannot be extended to those bus interchanges that are not owned by Government. We therefore need to put in place a more effective regulatory framework so that operators of all bus interchanges can play a more active role in strengthening the security of the interchanges. This is even more pertinent given the current heightened security environment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the proposed framework, the LTA may grant a bus interchange operator's licence on the application of any person, subject to conditions relating to the operation, safety and security of the bus interchange.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be an offence to operate any bus interchange without a licence granted by the LTA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the operators fail to comply with any licence conditions or directions issued by LTA, the LTA can also rectify defaults of the bus interchange operator, suspend or cancel a licence or impose a financial penalty in specified circumstances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Other amendments to improve operational and regulatory effectiveness</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other amendments proposed in the Bill are to enable the LTA to improve its operational and regulatory effectiveness. I will now highlight some of these amendments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Requirements for vehicles exceeding 4.5 metres in height</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, under the RTA, the driver or person in charge of vehicles exceeding 4 metres in height is required to obtain a permit from the Traffic Police for the vehicle to be driven on the roads. Clause 13 amends the RTA to remove the requirement for permits so as to move towards a more self-regulating regime.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2176</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, as part of the permit application process, owners and drivers of heavy vehicles with overall height exceeding 4.3 metres are also required to engage a police or auxiliary police escort when driving on public roads.&nbsp; With the proposed changes, the RTA will only require those with overall height exceeding 4.5 metres to do so.&nbsp; Therefore, the above amendments will save time and effort for the drivers without compromising the safety of road users or users of overhead structures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>An offence to obstruct the removal of stationary vehicle from an expressway<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to remove stalled vehicles from expressway shoulders expeditiously for safety reasons and to maintain smooth traffic flow. There have been cases where motorists have refused to allow their vehicles to be towed away by LTA, thereby compromising their own safety and the safety of other motorists. To deter this, clause 18 of the Bill makes it an offence for any person to refuse to permit or obstruct LTA or its agent from exercising its powers to tow away the vehicle. The offence will be made compoundable.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Responsibility of person who furnished false or misleading particulars</I></p><p><I>in connection with the change of registration of vehicle</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, for the offences of making false statements and providing false particulars in relation to documents kept or required under the RTA, the person held responsible is the one who made the statement or declaration or had provided the information.&nbsp; There is the possibility that a person, such as a director of a company, can cause another person, such as an employee, to make false statements or declarations or provide false particulars. Under the current provisions, the director cannot be charged, as it was not he who made the false declaration. Clause 20 of <p align=left>Column: 2177</p>the Bill addresses such situations and ensures that these perpetrators can also&nbsp;be prosecuted.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Cancellation of registration of a vehicle which has ceased to be kept or used on the road</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill enables the Registrar to cancel the registration of a vehicle if he is satisfied that the vehicle has ceased to be kept on the road or will be destroyed or removed from Singapore within a prescribed period.&nbsp; This gives LTA a greater degree of flexibility in handling vehicle de-registrations which presently are limited to scrapping or exporting of vehicles. This gives scope for LTA to implement additional de-registration schemes which would better meet the needs of Singaporeans, for example, the keeping of de-registered vehicles as training aids in institutions of learning or for display purposes in a private compound.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, these proposed amendments to the RTA will enable LTA to carry out its duties more efficiently and effectively.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.56 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise in&nbsp;support of the&nbsp;Amendment Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Vehicle Registration and Licensing System (VRLS), proposed under this Bill, marks a quantum leap forward in the efficacy of transactions relating to the registration and licensing of vehicles.&nbsp; With the new VRLS, long queues at the Land Transport Authority will be a thing of the past and vehicle owners and motor traders alike will be able to enjoy savings in time and travel using the online computerised system from the comfort of <p align=left>Column: 2178</p>their home or office to complete the transaction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the implementation of this new system is long overdue as commercial banks, airlines, hotels and many other Government agencies have all gone online to provide electronic services.&nbsp; More importantly, Sir, in addition to merely providing a better and more convenient service, the VRLS seeks to prevent some of the problems and abuses that have surfaced under the present paper-based system of registration.&nbsp; Although the log card is not a document of title and does not prove ownership, scams involving photocopied, duplicate or forged log cards have caused undue distress to helpless vehicle owners.&nbsp; In recent years, we have also heard of complaints from car owners of their vehicles being transferred without their knowledge.&nbsp; Banks and finance companies that dispense loans based on fraudulent documents have also been entangled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fraud case involving fake PARF and COE rebate certificates in November 2000, the suspect apparently sold nine fake rebate certificates to buyers for a sum amounting to more than half a million dollars.&nbsp; Between 2000 and 2004, there were also three other cases of fraud - one involving the use of duplicate log cards that were issued by the LTA and the other two involving the use of alleged forged log cards to transfer&nbsp;or deregister the vehicles without the knowledge of the finance companies or the registered vehicle owners.&nbsp; The amount involved in these cases was about $6 million and the victims were mainly finance and leasing companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with the elimination of the physical log card, as proposed under the Amendment Bill, it will remove&nbsp;opportunities to pull off such log card scams in future.&nbsp; There were also dealers and buyers who deliberately failed to register car transfers, leaving the <p align=left>Column: 2179</p>unsuspecting previous owners to be landed with summonses for traffic and parking offences and other obligations of owning a car they thought they had sold.&nbsp; Another unfortunate effect of the present reliance on physical documents is the necessity for the identity cards of the buyers and sellers of the cars to be produced when registering a transaction, thus opening possibilities for abuse of the NRIC by the person it is entrusted to.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, Sir, I am pleased to note that the electronic service agents, proposed under the Bill, will be able to check and verify the NRIC on the spot before the requested transaction, thus eradicating the need for owners to give their NRICs away to dealers to carry out the transaction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to know if the VRLS addresses all the known shortcomings of the present system and whether there are any features of the VRLS that have been specifically designed to do so, particularly in relation to fraudulent transfers as well as non-transfers.&nbsp; For example, will the seller of a car be notified that the transfer to the buyer has been effected or is there a way that he can check and verify for himself? &nbsp; With the introduction of the VRLS, I am concerned whether this new system will have its own inherent vulnerabilities that may invite crooks to devise new methods of abuse and fraud.&nbsp; May I ask what kind of security features will this new system have?&nbsp; The confidentiality of the LTA's assigned authentication code is crucial to the successful operation of the VRLS.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

However, because the code to access&nbsp;VRLS will not be used as often as <p align=left>Column: 2180</p>the ATM PIN is used to withdraw cash, there may be a strong tendency for users to write it down somewhere.&nbsp; Once written down, it is possible that the code can be copied and used by others without the knowledge of the vehicle owner.&nbsp; This may not pose much of a problem for transactions such as renewal of road tax.&nbsp; However, for transactions, like the transfer of vehicle ownership, where assets of considerable value are involved, there should not be any room for fraud.&nbsp; How often do we hear that the car in Singapore can cost as much as a home?&nbsp; Yet, property transactions require checks on the intentions and identities of the parties, many times more stringent than that required for vehicle transfers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in rolling out the new system, I hope that the LTA will put in place measures to ensure that the person requesting the transfer online is, in fact, the vehicle owner.&nbsp; I hope the Minister of State can enlighten us as to the measures taken to ensure that the system is safe and dependable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Bill also seeks to remove the requirement for heavy vehicle owners and drivers to apply for permits from the Traffic Police to drive their vehicles that are more than 4 metres in height.&nbsp; While I agree that this will save time and effort for vehicle owners and drivers,&nbsp;I wonder whether allowing vehicles that are between 4 metres and 4.5 metres to have free room on our streets&nbsp;will pose a danger to building structures, roadside trees and other road users.&nbsp; Instead of removing the existing permit requirement totally,&nbsp;I would like to suggest that, as an intermediate measure, all owners and drivers of such large heavy vehicles should at least notify the Traffic Police or the LTA of the route that they propose to take and the timing of this trip.&nbsp; This can be done electronically online to save time.&nbsp; So if something happens, at least the authorities have the record of which owner and which vehicle and which driver <p align=left>Column: 2181</p>are involved to assist&nbsp;their investigation and prosecution.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I refer to the new Part VB - Licensing of bus interchange operators.&nbsp; I wonder if the Government intends to tender out the running of bus interchanges to companies which are not bus operators.&nbsp; Section 1110(d) states that when the LTA grants the licence to the interchange operator, it can stipulate&nbsp;the maximum fees chargeable by the licensee to the operator of the bus services.&nbsp; So if fees have to be paid by bus service operator to the interchange operator, these fees will eventually become costs which will ultimately pass on to the consumers and, because of this arrangement, whether the Minister will expect the bus fares&nbsp;to be increased again.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I thank Mr Ong Kian Min for his support of the Bill.&nbsp; Mr Ong has rightly pointed out the inadequacies of the present system and the new VRLS essentially has been designed and seeks to address most, if not all, of&nbsp;the current weaknesses. Essentially, with the cessation of the issuance of the physical log cards, forgery and fraud would hopefully be a thing of the past.&nbsp; As he has also elaborated on, there is now no need for vehicle owners to leave their NRICs with&nbsp;intermediaries which, by itself, can lead to a whole lot of abuse if they land in the wrong hands.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Ong has asked whether there are any inherent vulnerabilities in the new VRLS such that it will detract&nbsp;the system from being safe and dependent.&nbsp; I would like to assure Mr Ong that the new VRLS is designed to minimise risk of electronic fraud through two aspects, firstly, access and, secondly, transaction control.&nbsp; Let <p align=left>Column: 2182</p>me just elaborate on these two aspects.&nbsp; For the access control, as I have elaborated earlier on, basically for Singapore citizens and PRs, they would use the NRIC numbers or SingPasses and there will be help and public education on how to facilitate this for those who are not familiar with the process.&nbsp;For foreigners,&nbsp;companies,&nbsp;businesses and entities that are registered with ACRA, or Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority,&nbsp;they will be issued by the LTA with a set of user IDs and passwords.&nbsp; So that would be secure as well.&nbsp;Finally, for the motor dealers, and that is really the key part, they will be appointed as the Electronic Service Agents and they will be required to subscribe to NeTrust which, itself, has a two-factor authentication requirement.&nbsp; So on the access front, there will be sufficient security controls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the transaction aspects, a PIN, which is referred to as the authentication code in the Bill, will be required for each transaction.&nbsp; So it would not be just one.&nbsp; It would be one for each transaction, and this would&nbsp;also be issued under strict controls.&nbsp; They would be done at the request of the owner over the Internet, or in person, or by duly appointed authorised representative by the owner, and the PIN will be sent to the registered addresses.&nbsp; So it would not be misdirected.&nbsp; This is quite similar to how PINs are being handled for many other systems as well.&nbsp;The transaction PIN will only be required for online transfers, deregistration of vehicles, transfer of rebates and temporary COEs and division of rebates. So as Mr Ong has noted, the non-confidential information would still be based on input of vehicle numbers, for example, information on the expiry of road tax, and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong has actually made a valid observation about how members of the public which include us, occasionally or quite often will forget their PIN and may write it somewhere.&nbsp; This is generally an <p align=left>Column: 2183</p>issue that is common with all electronic services provided for the public.&nbsp; There will be public education by the LTA.&nbsp; LTA will also provide assistance for those not familiar with using the Internet.&nbsp; They will have over-the-counter services at the different LTA offices as well as now we have, what we call, the Citizen Connect and e-Citizen helpers located at over 20 community centres and clubs.&nbsp; So these are places where members of the public can also get assistance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now just move on to&nbsp;the other concern that Mr Ong has raised about the changes&nbsp;which will allow vehicles of height between 4 metres and 4.5 metres free room and whether they would pose a danger to building structures and other road users.&nbsp; I would like to assure Mr Ong that the risk is actually&nbsp;minimal as only a very small percentage, in fact,&nbsp;2% of overhead structures has less than a 4.5 metre height clearance, and most of these&nbsp;are actually height restriction gantry placed just before the MRT viaducts and road structures.&nbsp; Information on these will be gazetted and provided on the One.Motoring website.&nbsp; So owners of such vehicles would know where to look for information and which are the roads where the height restrictions would be.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we agree that notifying the authorities may provide extra protection, on balance, we think that there is sufficient mitigation of risk of collision and we would like to move&nbsp;to a self-regulating regime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now just move on to Mr Low's two comments.&nbsp; The first is whether the Government, in drafting the regulation of bus interchanges, has the intention to tender out the bus interchange.&nbsp; Sir, the drafting of the amendments serves to provide for as much flexibility as possible.&nbsp; So whilst now these interchanges are all being managed by the bus transport <p align=left>Column: 2184</p>operators, we do not rule out that that could be a possibility.&nbsp; Secondly, he asked whether, essentially, the levying of licensing fees would add on to transport costs in future.&nbsp; The LTA intends to only levy a very nominal fee and therefore this should by no means be any imposition in terms of transport costs in general.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe I have answered the questions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt;

Singapore is a party to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which regulates trade in wildlife. Parliament passed the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act (ESA) in March 1989 to give effect to CITES in <p align=left>Column: 2185</p>Singapore. The Act was amended in 2002 to include a list of endangered species.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the last amendment, there have been substantive changes to the CITES enforcement obligations on member states and the interpretation of illegal trade.&nbsp; Thus, there is a need to update and realign the ESA to the changes in the CITES, and to enhance the deterrence against any illegal trade in wildlife through Singapore.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry has carried out&nbsp;a comprehensive review of the ESA.&nbsp; The Endangered Species (Import and Export) Bill would repeal the ESA and re-enact with amendments the ESA. The key features of the Bill are as follows:&nbsp; Firstly, the Bill will strengthen the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority's (AVA) enforcement powers. Changes will, for example, allow enforcement action to be taken against illegal transshipments through Singapore of CITES-protected wildlife species.&nbsp; Secondly, the Bill will raise the maximum level of penalties to ensure an effective deterrence against the illegal trafficking and trade of CITES-protected species. Thirdly, the Bill will update terms, definitions and provisions used in CITES, and align general provisions in the ESA with those in other relevant legislation.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will elaborate on the key features of the Bill.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Strengthening AVA's Enforcement Powers</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on acting against illegal transshipments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is one of the busiest ports in the world and is an attractive transshipment hub.&nbsp; Currently, while the ESA empowers AVA to take action against illegal imports and exports of CITES-protected species, it is not specific about AVA's powers with regard to transshipments.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill will empower AVA to investigate illegal transshipment or transit <p align=left>Column: 2186</p>cases, and search, inspect, detain, seize or confiscate any illegal CITES-protected species.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This provision will be applicable to both travellers and cargoes passing through Singapore. It will enable AVA to act decisively upon receiving strong intelligence and evidence and tip-offs of illegal CITES-protected species being transshipped through Singapore and prevent Singapore from being used as a conduit for the smuggling of CITES-protected species.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, on treating fake products as if they were genuine.&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with CITES's recommendation, the Bill will allow AVA to take appropriate enforcement actions based on the markings, labels or claims that a product contains a part or derivative of a CITES species, without having to prove that this part or derivative is actually present in the product.&nbsp;&nbsp;Countries like Australia and also Hong Kong&nbsp;have similar provisions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some examples of fake products are traditional Chinese medicines purporting to contain bear bile, tiger bone, rhino horn or musk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sales of fake products will damage Singapore's image as a responsible global citizen to the same extent as sales of genuine products, as the international community is quick to judge our reputation based on such claims.&nbsp; In addition, the proliferation of sales of fake products produces \"noise\" and will complicate our effort to apprehend the genuine cases.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Bill will also raise the maximum level of penalties to better reflect the severity of the offences and strengthen deterrence against illegal wildlife trade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Interpol, smuggling of wildlife is second only to narcotics in <p align=left>Column: 2187</p>terms of the profits they generate and is estimated at some&nbsp;US$5 billion annually.&nbsp; The House may recall that in 2002, AVA has seized six tons of elephant ivory tusks in a single consignment, and that was worth about&nbsp;US$10 million then.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the value of smuggled endangered wildlife can be very high, the current fine of $5,000 is not an effective deterrent.&nbsp; So the Bill will increase the maximum penalty for illegal trafficking of endangered species from $5,000 and/or a&nbsp;year's jail, to $50,000 and/or two years' imprisonment.&nbsp; The fine is applicable to each CITES-protected animal or plant, or part thereof, involved in the offence, up to an aggregate maximum of $500,000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For abetment and attempted offences, the Bill will also impose the same penalty as the main offence. This is in line with the Criminal Procedure Code, where abetment and attempt to commit an offence carries the same penalty as the offence itself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, to maintain consistency with other Acts administered by AVA, the Bill will amend relevant provisions to be in line with similar clauses in those Acts.&nbsp; These include specifying the jurisdiction of District Courts to impose full penalties under the ESA; empowering AVA to seal and collect samples of specimens; and requiring owners, importers or exporters of CITES species to bear the cost of damage to specimens in the course of lawful exercise of powers by AVA.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill will also put in place provisions to specify the manner in which documents, such as notices, summonses, are delivered to persons connected with the offences; allow recorded statements to be submitted as&nbsp;evidence in court; and make it an offence to post advertisements for sale of illegal CITES specimens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2188</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in summary, the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Bill will strengthen deterrence and enforcement against illegal wildlife trade, and align the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act to recent changes made to CITES.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.<br></p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome this Bill, which repeals and re-enacts the existing Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act, particularly as it seeks to increase the penalties for illegal wildlife trading and enhance the enforcement powers of the Director-General, Agri-food and Veterinary Services, and other authorised officers.&nbsp; It is a big step forward for Singapore in our contribution towards environmental conservation and protection.&nbsp; We must play our part to conserve our planet and our fellow occupants&nbsp;- plants and animals - to ensure a sustainable living environment for our future generations.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore, due to our strategic location and the rich biodiversity of our neighbours, has become a transshipment hub for commercial trade in animals, plants and their by-products.&nbsp; Unfortunately, along with this, there is also some perception&nbsp;that we could unwittingly have become a centre for the illegal&nbsp;multi-billion-dollar wildlife trade.&nbsp; Even though this has not been proven to be so, we must do whatever we can to help stop this illegal and cruel trade.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too many species in Southeast Asia have been hunted to extinction.&nbsp; I understand that more than half of smuggled animals die.&nbsp; The majority of the survivors end up mistreated.&nbsp;Many do not adapt well to captivity and the very act of removing them from their natural habitat damages the fragile ecosystem and threatens the species' and other species' existence. Part of the problem is poverty <p align=left>Column: 2189</p>and ignorance.&nbsp; Another part is economics - demand is enormous and&nbsp;huge profits&nbsp;can be made.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to raise three points in relation to the Bill.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the mode of&nbsp;imposing penalty.&nbsp; I am glad that the Bill has increased the penalties imposed for illegally dealing with endangered species ten-fold, from $5,000 per species to $50,000 per species, but subject to a maximum of $500,000, and with a maximum jail term of&nbsp;two years, instead of&nbsp;a year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, given that the sums involved in illegal wildlife trading can run into tens of millions of dollars, as the Minister of State has just noted, I would like to ask the Minister of State why the penalty imposed is not&nbsp;computed on a per animal basis, but&nbsp;on a per&nbsp;species basis.&nbsp; This is despite the fact that there have been calls from various quarters, including the&nbsp;Animal Concern Research Education Society (ACRES), who have asked for the penalty imposed to be based on the number of animals traded, or in&nbsp;the case of animal parts, on a quantifiable unit, instead of a per species basis, which does not reflect the true market value of what is illegally traded.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logically, the higher the number of animals being illegally traded, the higher would be the value.&nbsp; Hence, the heftier&nbsp;the fine ought to be.&nbsp; This would then be an even stronger deterrent against illegal wildlife trading.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister of State what is the rationale for imposing penalties based on a per species basis.&nbsp; Is this in line with similar legislation in other countries that are also signatories to CITES?&nbsp; Furthermore, I would like to ask the Minister of State why is there a&nbsp; need to cap the penalty to a maximum of $500,000.&nbsp; If these illegal traffickers&nbsp;continue to commit such offences,&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2190</p>despite the hefty penalties, why should the law help limit the financial&nbsp;risk they face upon prosecution?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly,&nbsp;enforcement powers and manpower.&nbsp; I am also pleased that the Director-General and other authorised officers are now given wider enforcement powers, which include the right to enter and search any premises or ship, or any other conveyance as well as the right to seize any&nbsp;animal or plant, if there is a reason to suspect that they are being illegally trafficked.&nbsp; However, such enforcement powers can only be effective if there is sufficient manpower.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I would like to ask the Minister of State if the manpower for enforcement would also be strengthened.&nbsp; This would help to minimise the chance of illegal shipments slipping through the customs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister of State, how regularly AVA conducts checks on pet shops to ensure that there is no illegal trade in endangered species and that animal welfare is not compromised. And for that matter, even for Chinese medical shops.&nbsp; Just last year, it was reported that AVA, acting on a survey conducted by ACRES, visited some 100 pet shops and found 20 selling endangered species.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do cargoes, containing significant quantities of endangered animals occasionally slip into Singapore without detection?&nbsp; Would the AVA be undertaking&nbsp;&nbsp;stricter enforcement&nbsp;at pet shops, Chinese medical shops,&nbsp;checkpoints and other locations?&nbsp; Heavier penalties ought to be coupled with&nbsp;stricter&nbsp;enforcement to effectively&nbsp;deter such illegal trafficking of wildlife.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, public education.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to urge the Ministry to work closely with civic groups like ACRES, community centres, schools and other institutions&nbsp;to conduct more public education exercises to heighten the <p align=left>Column: 2191</p>public's awareness about not keeping endangered animals,&nbsp;the risks they pose to the animals and/or plants and their new environment.&nbsp; We should also continue to encourage members of the public and whistle-blower, to alert the authorities about individuals and organisations who flout the law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act was first passed, as was noted by the Minister of State, in March 1989 to give effect to the CITES.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Act has since been amended twice and this time it is being repealed and re-enacted to update and streamline the Act and align it with CITES' requirements.&nbsp; I am pleased that the Government has been proactive in this respect, and has taken into account feedback from the community regarding the need to impose heavier penalties as well as widen enforcement powers for the Act to serve as an effective deterrent against illegal wildlife trading.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill but hope that the Government can further strengthen the penalties as well as the enforcement system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Geh Min--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Geh Min:</B> Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.

It is certainly not because of an increase in wildlife in the world, but the experts say it is because of changing conditions that bring wildlife into closer contact with humans.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are certain conditions or causes which we cannot do anything about - increased globalism, increased international trade, increased international tourism, increased urbanisation.&nbsp; But there are causes which we can do something about, and which we should do something about and the illegal wildlife trade is definitely one of them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been shown by experts that one of the most dangerous cocktails you could have to generate new pathogens like SARS, for example, is close unnatural and unnecessary proximity between wildlife, domestic animals and humans.&nbsp; Professor Li Wendong, in an article on SARS, when he did his research on SARS, mentioned this in relation to a market in Guangzhou where there was a lot of illegal wildlife trading.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore does not have the conditions that China has but, however, as has been noted, we do have an illegal wildlife trade.&nbsp; I fully support the attempt by this Bill to eradicate this trade.&nbsp; However, I would like to address the issue of implementation which I am sure the Government fully intends to implement as effectively as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been brought to my attention, and this has already been mentioned by <p align=left>Column: 2193</p>the hon. Member, Dr Amy Khor, that at present, AVA does not have enough manpower to effectively implement the Endangered Species (Import and Export)&nbsp;Act.&nbsp; Despite the hopeful deterrent that&nbsp;higher penalties will have,&nbsp;this must be matched by the training of more AVA officers.&nbsp; NGO groups have done their part and, in fact, I have heard from ACRES that they not only alert AVA officers after doing their own recces, they have to go and pick up the AVA officers and drive them to the locations because apparently, there is not enough transport provided.&nbsp; I do not know how many vans AVA has for their officers, but they are not enough.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other area for better implementation that I would like to suggest is that AVA officers work more closely with other Government agencies, customs and immigration offices and&nbsp;the Police Force.&nbsp; A large part of this Bill is made up of a list of endangered species.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I would ask for better education of other enforcement agencies working with AVA to implement this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp;I would like to also call for better public education.&nbsp; A lot of the illegal wildlife that is brought into Singapore is done so with the unwitting participation of an ignorant community or members of the public.&nbsp; And I think a lot could be done, together with this new Bill, to alert members of the public, not just on the dangers to the illegal wildlife but the dangers to the community if illegal wildlife comes to Singapore.&nbsp; Because illegal wildlife, as we have heard, comes through in a sizable volume.&nbsp; A lot of these <p align=left>Column: 2194</p>animals are kept in highly unsanitary, crowded places.&nbsp; A lot of them die in transit.&nbsp; And this, as&nbsp;we all&nbsp;know, is one of the best ways to spread disease.&nbsp; It is impossible to track them, either the source or the movements, because it is illegal.&nbsp; And, finally, they are released into the community.&nbsp; Once they are released into the community,&nbsp;we cannot track them at all.&nbsp; A lot of them would be released into homes, but some of them are released into our national parks and reserves.&nbsp; Because, after people buy them, they may decide that they do not want them any more and the wildlife&nbsp;are put into the reservoirs of our drinking water.&nbsp; They are put into the national parks, and then it is too late.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I just mention here that in the case of SARS, the crucial scientific link when the virus mutated and became&nbsp; dangerous to humans has still not been found and experts say it will probably never be found now.&nbsp; This sort of switch that the virus makes is something that we cannot always prevent, although WHO suggests that we have to spend at least $1 billion on Avian Flu to try and prevent it.&nbsp; Otherwise, we will lose many times that quantum.&nbsp; But where there is low hanging fruit, like closing the loopholes on the illegal wildlife trade, we should do it and we can do it.&nbsp; I applaud the Government for the new Bill on endangered species.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I would like to address the points that they made.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, on the need to safeguard Singapore's reputation as an international centre for trade and as an international transshipment hub, I cannot agree more <p align=left>Column: 2195</p>with the two Members.&nbsp; We want to remain a global centre for trade, commerce and transshipment,&nbsp;and we will do everything possible to promote this status. But, at the same time, we will not want this role of ours to be abused by those engaged in illegal activities, whether it is&nbsp;narcotics or&nbsp; illegal wildlife trade, because that damages us in a serious way.&nbsp; This Bill will go some way towards addressing this particular danger that we may face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor asked whether or not it would&nbsp;be on a per animal basis.&nbsp; It is actually on a per animal basis because, according to the interpretation, the word \"species\"&nbsp;would also relate to per animal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On her question on penalties, she is right.&nbsp; We have increased the minimum fine ten-fold.&nbsp; In fact, the maximum fine of $500,000 is a hundred-fold of the old arrangement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked whether or not there are other jurisdictions that have similar arrangements.&nbsp; I know that in the case of Hong Kong, they have similar arrangements.&nbsp; They have a maximum fine of HK$5 million and two years' imprisonment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Dr Amy Khor and Dr Geh Min alluded to the importance of trained manpower&nbsp; to implement the measures in this Bill.&nbsp; AVA is aware of this.&nbsp; AVA has a pool of trained officers&nbsp;and would ensure that the manpower is properly trained.&nbsp; AVA would also review its structures and processes, including the headcount, and it would make the applications for supplementation if that becomes necessary.&nbsp; But, at the same time, it recognises that to tackle something like this, it really goes beyond AVA as well, because a lot of times,&nbsp;we know where to go because of intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are then talking about a network <p align=left>Column: 2196</p>approach&nbsp; -&nbsp; working with Customs, working with the Police, working with the relevant NGOs, working with international partners.&nbsp; All this is actually very important for&nbsp;us to target properly at these kinds of illegal activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor asked whether or not the AVA conducts checks on the pet shops, and whether they do so regularly enough in order to ferret out such activities.&nbsp; I would say that checks can be done, but these things can happen anywhere.&nbsp; The more critical and more productive way is to strengthen our intelligence collection abilities and to strengthen our network of partners.&nbsp; In that way,&nbsp;we are better able to sharp shoot and go in for effectiveness.&nbsp; So we will continue with our checks on related establishments but we will put even more emphasis on strengthening our coordination and networking with&nbsp;our partners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Geh Min alluded to a case where&nbsp;private transport apparently&nbsp;had been used to conduct a raid on&nbsp;some premises.&nbsp; I do not know the details of that case.&nbsp; But sometimes it is actually better to conduct a raid without a QX plate car, because it helps you get closer to the target.&nbsp; I really do not know the details of that case, but it might just have been that.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the important thing really is that we should work in partnership, enhance our intelligence collaboration and then be able to pinpoint and sharp shoot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On public education, once again, we are all together&nbsp;on this&nbsp;and I absolutely agree that there is a lot more that we can do, first of all, to raise the awareness of the importance of protecting our wildlife in general and of the importance of making sure that we do not become a centre of illegal wildlife trade and all the dangers that it can bring to our economy as well as to public health, as Dr Geh Min has elaborated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2197</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before this House seeks to amend the Singapore Armed Forces Act<p align=left>Column: 2198</p> to increase the maximum quantum of fines that the Subordinate Military Court and SAF disciplinary officers may impose on servicemen found guilty of the charges against them.</p><p align=\"left\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF is a military organisation where discipline is of utmost importance. The Singapore Armed Forces Act spells out the legal provisions that help uphold the level of discipline in the SAF. The Act applies to all members of the SAF, including regulars, full-time national servicemen and operationally-ready NSmen when they are called back for in-camp training or other activities. It does not apply to those who have yet to enlist for national service.</p><p align=\"left\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act provides for serious offenders to be dealt with by means of general court martial and less serious offenders to be dealt with by means of summary trials. It provides for a range of penalties for those found guilty of misconduct. These include discharge from service, detention, reduction in rank, forfeiture of seniority, fines and reprimand.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the SAF is not facing any problem with its state of discipline, MINDEF actively conducts periodic reviews of the discipline framework. In its most recent review, MINDEF found the discipline provisions in the Singapore Armed Forces Act to be still relevant and appropriate, with the exception of the maximum fine quantum prescribed in the Act.<br></p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum fine quantum in the Act was last amended 15 years ago in 1991. Since then, our environment has changed. There is a need to increase the maximum quantum to make the fines more effective, both as a deterrent and as a penalty. The effectiveness of the current fine quantum has declined over time when compared with current salaries and NS allowances, in particular the substantial increase in NS allowances instituted in <p align=left>Column: 2199</p>2002.&nbsp; The NS allowances for ranks typically held by our full-time National Servicemen are:&nbsp; for a Recruit $350 a month, for a Third Sergeant $560 a month, and for a Second Lieutenant it is $870 a month. For Lieutenants it is $1,050&nbsp;a month. These are the typical ranks and NS allowances of our full-time National Servicemen.&nbsp; NS allowances are thus substantially higher than Members of this House will have experienced during their own NS days.<br></p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quantum of increase in maximum fines proposed in the Bill better reflects these current NS allowances and should be able to serve the needs of the SAF for at least the next five to 10 years. The maximum fines for the junior ranks are typically less than one month of their NS allowance if they appear before a Junior Disciplinary Officer and 1.3 months if they appear before a Senior Disciplinary Officer respectively. The maximum fines for the more senior ranks are typically 1.3 to two months of NS allowance to reflect the wider range of seriousness of the offences that they may be charged with.</p><p align=\"left\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to highlight key aspects of the Bill.<br></p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 8 deal with the fine quantum for summary trials while clause 9 deals with the fine quantum for general court martial.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 proposes an increase in the maximum fine that a Junior Disciplinary Officer can impose. The increase is from $100 to $300 for a soldier of the rank of Third Sergeant and below, and from $300 to $1,000 for a soldier of the rank of Second Sergeant and above.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 deals with the maximum fine that a Senior Disciplinary Officer can impose. The maximum fine is proposed to go up from $150 to $500 for Third <p align=left>Column: 2200</p>Sergeant and below, and from $500 to $1,500&nbsp;for Second Sergeant and above.<br></p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 proposes an increase in the maximum fines that a Superior Commander can impose, from $500 to $2,000 for Lieutenants and Warrant Officers, and from $1,000 to $3,000 for Captains and Majors.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5 and 6 propose to increase the maximum fines that the Service Chiefs and the Chief of Defence Force can impose on Lieutenant-Colonels and Colonels from $1,500 to $6,000.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 is a consequential amendment on the provision dealing with detention in default of fine.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 proposes to increase from $1,500 to $10,000 the maximum fines that can be imposed on officers of the rank of Brigadier-General and above. A substantial increase in the maximum fines for this category is proposed as these are very senior officers for which a wider range of fines is appropriate to be commensurate with the wide range of seriousness of the offences that they may be charged with. They will be dealt with by a Senior Disciplinary Committee consisting of not less than three members of the Armed Forces Council.</p><p align=\"left\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 proposes an increase in the maximum fines that the Subordinate Military Courts can impose.&nbsp; For officers, the maximum will increase from $2,000 to $10,000.&nbsp; For soldiers, it will be from $1,000 to $5,000. The maximum fine quantum of $10,000 is similar to the maximum fine quantum that can be imposed by our district courts.&nbsp; Presidents of the Subordinate Military Courts are legally qualified operationally ready NSmen who are serving or have served as magistrates or district judges.<br></p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the increase in the maximum fine quantum for summary trials does not <p align=left>Column: 2201</p>mean that all servicemen will henceforth receive proportionately heavier fines. The fines will depend on the specific circumstances of each case. The higher maximum fine will allow for an appropriate level of punishment to be meted out based on the seriousness of the offences committed.<br></p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments to the maximum fine quantum will help to uphold the state of discipline in the SAF and to ensure that the SAF will continue to be a disciplined, professional and credible defence force.<br></p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Alexander Chan Meng Wah (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.41 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Alexander Chan Meng Wah (Nominated Member):</B> &nbsp;Mr Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak on the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendments have proposed increasing the existing range of fines imposable by various levels of disciplinary officers for offences under the SAF Act, from the current $100 to $2,000 to the new range of $300 to $10,000.&nbsp; These are multiples of three to five times the current levels.&nbsp; In the light of the development of the SAF towards a third generation fighting force, the SAF will be staffed by more highly trained and educated soldiers at all levels.&nbsp; In fact, a 3G SAF is made possible only because Singapore has the right kind of human capital to undertake this kind of development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background, I can see the logic to keep up with the times and&nbsp;to increase the scale of fines for offences committed.&nbsp; However, I note that the quanta and multiples have increased for higher levels of disciplinary officers such as superior commanders, more so than for less senior ones such as Junior Disciplinary Officers.&nbsp; As the specific <p align=left>Column: 2202</p>detailed schedule of offences for which the fines are used as punishment&nbsp;is not evident in the amendment, I have to ask if this then means that there has not been any change to the disciplinary responsibilities in spite of a more capable and responsible SAF organisation.&nbsp; Since we will find more SAF commanders and regular career commanders at the Junior Disciplinary Officer levels than at the senior levels, by virtue of promotional opportunities within the timeframe, the amendments proposed seem to give me the impression that we are not recognising the possibility for more disciplinary responsibilities for NS commanders.&nbsp; So, while this amendment proposes the wielding of a bigger financial stick, it is still the same stick</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>in the manner of speaking.&nbsp;While the changes proposed may reflect the effects of inflation of a time and perhaps some more financial burden on the offenders, it does not seem to go enough to reflect the increasing competence of our NS commanders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the SAF provide more responsibility to lower level Disciplinary Officers, for example, by way of expanding upon the types of offences under their charge, in addition to just increasing the scale of fines relative to the existing scales.&nbsp; Also, if the Superior Commanders are given more powers, in terms of fines, detention, reduction of ranks and reversion of ranks, the number of cases going before the general court martial will be much reduced.&nbsp;Presently, there are probably too many court martial cases because of the lack of powers on the part of the Superior Commanders.&nbsp; This would then shift responsibility and accountability lower down and it should also have a concomitant effect of reducing workload at&nbsp;the higher level of disciplinary jurisdictions.&nbsp; Therefore, while I am in support of the direction and the quantum of increases to the fines, as proposed in this amendment, I also hope to see further amendments to the SAF <p align=left>Column: 2203</p>Act to put more responsibility for discipline further down the organisation to NS and career commanders.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank Mr Alex Chan for making this point because it is indeed important that we give greater responsibility to our commanders, particularly our NS commanders, in the appropriate levels of the organisation.&nbsp; Many of our NS commanders are OCs and&nbsp;Platoon Commanders in the units.&nbsp; The Junior Disciplinary Officers are usually OCs in the units, officers commanding&nbsp;companies and batteries.&nbsp; The Senior Disciplinary Officers are usually Battalion Commanders, commanders of units.&nbsp; And indeed, one of the reasons why we wanted to put in place this increase in the quantum of fines is because the quantum of fines that can be imposed by Junior Disciplinary Officers is so low that if in a unit they want to bring a charge and a punishment against a particular soldier, the Junior Disciplinary Officer feels that the fines that he can impose are so low that they tend to escalate it up to the Senior Disciplinary Officer.&nbsp;So in this case, we do want to give the Junior Disciplinary Officer more ability to deal with the soldiers directly under his charge expeditiously and in the direct line of his command.&nbsp; So indeed, this is one of the objectives that we want to achieve.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And similarly, also, when we have increased the powers to fine&nbsp;of the Senior Disciplinary Officer, it avoids the Senior Disciplinary Officer having to escalate this particular charge to the Superior Commander who is usually the Brigade Commander.&nbsp; As for the types of offences that can be dealt with, the offences are specified in the Schedule of the SAF Act, and there are 28 such offences, if I remember correctly, which are triable by summary trials.&nbsp;All the offences in the SAF Act are triable by court martial, but <p align=left>Column: 2204</p>these 28 offences are triable by summary trials, as specified in the Act.&nbsp; And all summary trials, whether they are JDOs, SDOs or Superior Commanders can try these 28 offences.&nbsp;So we do want to give more powers, more discretion, to the Junior Commanders so that they can exercise discipline and responsibility for discipline in the unit.&nbsp; But of course, just by giving them disciplinary power is not the only way of giving them more responsibility, as I distributed yesterday in the pamphlet, we do want to give them more responsibility, more scope to make decisions in the 3G SAF by widening the responsibilities that they have in other areas.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Manpower&nbsp;started work on reforming the <p align=left>Column: 2205</p>Factories Act, this is the Act which&nbsp;regulates occupational safety and health (<st1:City><st1:place>OSH</st1:place></st1:City>) in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> in 2001.&nbsp; Three high-profile accidents in 2004 - the collapse of Nicoll Highway, the fire on the vessel \"Almudaina\" at Keppel Shipyard and the accident at Fusionpolis, which collectively claimed 13 lives, added new impetus and urgency to our efforts.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the passage of time may have lessened the pain, we must not forget the lessons learnt. If there can be any good from the tragic loss of lives, then let it be this - a constant reminder to us all that we ignore safety and health risks at our peril and to move us from platitudes to action, to create structures that will shape better behaviour and outcomes at the workplace.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our safety standards have improved over the years. Even after the&nbsp;three major accidents in 2004, we were within the top 20 developed countries and a leader in safety for Asian countries.&nbsp; But we must do better. In 2004, 83 people lost their lives in workplace accidents.&nbsp; More than 3,000 were injured in industrial accidents; 93 were permanently incapacitated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of these accidents were preventable.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reality is that on a day-to-day basis, safety may be the last thing on the minds of management and workers on the ground. There are deadlines to meet, monotony, apathy or lethargy to overcome, a lack of professionalism and training, unclear lines or no lines of accountability, and poor management.&nbsp; Any one of these factors can lead to an accident.&nbsp; A combination of them is often catastrophic.&nbsp; The Committee of Inquiry into the Collapse of Nicoll Highway noted: \"The collapse did not develop suddenly.&nbsp; Several technical and administrative factors contributed to the collapse.&nbsp; From the early stages \u20ac\u00a6 there were failures to demonstrate the necessary level of care.&nbsp; A multiplicity of events led to the position where design, construction, instru<p align=left>Column: 2206</p>mentation, management and organisation systems \u20ac\u00a6 failed. Serious human errors were made.&nbsp; There were failures in defensive systems.&nbsp; The builder did not adequately deal with insidious warning signs.&nbsp; There were no proper and appropriate design reviews.&nbsp; There were inadequate contingency and remedial measures.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In retrospect, we were extremely fortunate that more did not lose their lives in the accident.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the tragedies of 2004, I informed this House in March&nbsp;last year&nbsp;that Government would undertake a fundamental review of our legislation to improve safety outcomes. Three fundamental reforms in this Bill will improve safety at the workplace.&nbsp; First, this Bill will strengthen proactive measures.&nbsp;Instead of reacting to accidents after they have occurred, which is often too little too late, we should reduce risks to prevent accidents. To achieve this, all employers will be required to conduct comprehensive risk assessments for all work processes and provide detailed plans to minimise or eliminate risks.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, industry must take ownership of occupational safety and health standards and outcomes to effect a cultural change of respect for life and livelihoods at the workplace.&nbsp; Government cannot improve safety by fiat alone.&nbsp; Industry must take responsibility for raising OSH standards at a practical and reasonable pace.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, this Bill will better define persons who are accountable, their responsibilities and institute penalties which reflect the true economic and social cost of risks and accidents.&nbsp; Penalties should be sufficient to deter risk-taking behaviour and ensure that companies are proactive in preventing incidents. Appropriately, companies and persons that show poor safety management should be penalised even if no accident has occurred.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2207</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill will put into place a new and more effective framework to reduce accidents at the workplace&nbsp;- to bring about a quantum improvement in OSH standards and to achieve our intermediate goal of halving the present occupational fatality rate by 2015.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now give an overview of the Bill and explain its key provisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; I should start by thanking our tripartite partners, employers and unions, and also other key stakeholders&nbsp;- safety professionals, developers, designers, industry associations and many others who assisted in developing key ideas and regulatory concepts during the consultation process.&nbsp; Many insightful observations and comments were made, which have greatly improved the final product.&nbsp; During this reading, I will indicate to Members in this House&nbsp;changes in this Bill which are substantially different from the approach taken in the current Factories Act.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Scope of the Bill</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, coverage of all workplaces. Our current legislation only covers factories. This is of course archaic, as every worker deserves to be protected against safety and health risks.&nbsp;Occupational safety and health (OSH)&nbsp;legislation in other developed countries, including the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the United Kingdom, has long moved on to cover all workplaces.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will extend coverage of the Act in stages in consultation with industry. Our immediate priority is to focus on the sectors with the highest accident and fatality rates: these are construction sites, shipyards and metalworking factories. Clause 2(2) of the Bill allows the Minister to extend the scope to cover other workplaces in due course, which we intend to do over the next three to&nbsp;five years. We will engage and consult the <p align=left>Column: 2208</p>industries concerned regarding the timeframe, and help prepare them for compliance with the legislative requirements.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain occupational groups have been exempted, such as members of the Singapore Armed Forces, the Police and other members of the Home Team.&nbsp; These agencies need the flexibility to make urgent operational decisions without being encumbered by the legislative requirements.&nbsp; While the need is understandable,&nbsp;MOM will work with those exempted to ensure that their <st1:City><st1:place>OSH</st1:place></st1:City> management systems are comprehensive and up to date.&nbsp; Crew on international modes of transport are also exempted.&nbsp; This is because they are operating across international boundaries.&nbsp; Their safety and health will be protected by internal controls and other laws applicable to that sector.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Better defined liability regime to reduce risks at source</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the Bill will expand responsibility and better define persons who are accountable for safety outcomes. Under the present regime, legal liability in respect of all persons in the factory falls on the shoulders of the registered occupier.&nbsp; For a traditional assembly-line plant, this is comprehensive as the factory occupier is typically the employer of all the workers and has control over the risks to which they are exposed.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>However, today, with outsourcing, specialisation of work and more diverse employment relationships, workplaces will often have workers employed by third parties and other specialists.&nbsp;For example, in the&nbsp;construction sites,&nbsp;employees from various specialist sub-contractors work together on the same project, but under the direction of their respective employers.&nbsp; In such a scenario, placing legal liability on the registered occupier alone may be unfair and ineffective.&nbsp; This is because&nbsp;the employees of the sub-<p align=left>Column: 2209</p>contractors may choose to ignore the safety instructions of the occupier or carry out unsafe work practices, or introduce unsafe work practices without the knowledge of the occupier.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part IV the Bill effects a new and more direct liability regime which assigns legal responsibility to those who create and have control over safety and health risks. Clause 11 assigns liability to occupiers for dangers arising from the physical environment under their control.&nbsp; Clauses 12 and 13 assign responsibility for safety to employers and self-employed persons respectively.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 14 covers principals who engage contractors for specialised tasks or the services of workers from third-party labour suppliers.&nbsp; In such situations, there is no contract of employment between the principal and the contractor or the worker supplied.&nbsp; Traditionally, a principal who engages a contractor would be engaging the specialist services of the contractor, and would not be directing the contractor on how to do the work.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, today the situation is different.&nbsp; Principals often engage \"contractors\" and third-party labour not for their specialist expertise, but precisely so that they can avoid entering into a direct employment relationship, for organisational or other reasons. In such situations, the principal, in terms of supervision, takes on the role of an employer.&nbsp; The Bill thus places on him responsibility for the worker's safety and health as if he were&nbsp;the employer.&nbsp; If this were not the case, then the duties under the Act could be simply circumvented by a careful crafting of the legal relationship.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill also expands accountability for OSH risks to include risks posed to members of the public by employers, self-employed persons and principals. This is necessary as workplace accidents may have catastrophic effects, not only on their employees, but also on the public at <p align=left>Column: 2210</p>large. Take, for example, an alarming case in July last year, when a contractor caused a gas leak because he wrongly mixed cleaning reagents for a swimming pool. In that incident, over 50 members of the public were exposed to toxic chlorine gas. It is fortunate that no fatalities occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 16 covers manufacturers and suppliers of high-risk machinery and equipment specified in the Fifth Schedule of the Bill, which have been identified as generating more accidents.&nbsp; Companies who manufacture these products must ensure that they are safe for their intended use. The Fifth Schedule also contains a list of toxic and hazardous substances, including corrosive, flammable and explosive substances, which will be regulated under the same clause.&nbsp; This list is based on the UN's \"Globally Harmonised System (GHS) for Hazard Classification and Communication\", and thus represents an internationally accepted categorisation of dangerous substances.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most accidents involving dangerous machines and toxic chemicals are caused not by the inherent defects, but by ignorance of risks and inattention to necessary safety precautions.&nbsp; The duty under clause 16 therefore also requires manufacturers and suppliers to provide adequate and comprehensive information on use and the precautions to be taken.&nbsp; Such information should be documented and made available at the point of sale, not at the point of distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under clause 17, persons who erect, install, modify or maintain the same high-risk machinery or equipment are placed under a duty to do so responsibly.&nbsp;&nbsp; This includes third-party maintenance contractors.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To engender a strong safety culture, commitment of top management is <p align=left>Column: 2211</p>critical.&nbsp; Hence, the Bill holds managers and directors of companies accountable for safety and health practices at their workplaces under clause 48, even though managers may not be able to police safety and health on the ground.&nbsp; This means that even though physical supervision of workers may be delegated, management must show that they have taken active steps to implement sound OSH management systems, including proper risk assessments and reporting systems, provide adequate resources, and ensure that full information is disseminated to workers and other persons exposed to risks.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While management commitment is critical, it is not sufficient if employees ignore clear instructions.&nbsp; Under this new liability regime, responsibility for the safety and health of others will lie not only with employers, but also with employees, whether they be supervisors or rank-and-file workers. Clause 15(1) thus requires persons at work to use the personal protective equipment provided by their employer and cooperate with the employer on OSH matters. Clause 15(3) also imposes a duty to not wilfully or recklessly endanger the safety and health of themselves or others, with appropriate penalties in place to deter such behaviour.&nbsp; As I have said, this would greatly expand the liability framework.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Shifting mindsets to comprehensive risk management systems<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The present OSH regulatory regime defines which workplaces and aspects of work are regulated, and also prescriptively fixes the methods of achieving OSH competency on the ground,&nbsp;in other words, the law tells you what to do and how to do it.&nbsp; Such an approach has led to a morass of legislative rules and regulations, which may be ill-suited to particular sets of circumstances but must <p align=left>Column: 2212</p>be followed nonetheless. &nbsp;It promotes a mindset of simply following the letter of the law, without applying one's mind to how the measures should be implemented to be effective or if there is a better or more efficient solution.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Over the past&nbsp;three decades, leading OSH countries, including the UK and Sweden, have realised that as work processes become more sophisticated and more customised, it is increasingly difficult for the Government or any central authority to prescribe standards which can be applied uniformly to all companies,&nbsp;across all industries.&nbsp; The speed of technological development means that regulators which try to micro-manage will always be playing catch-up.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These countries have therefore changed their regulatory mindset.&nbsp; Rather than tell businesses how to run their factories or do their jobs, they have made businesses responsible for managing their own risks.&nbsp; Their legislation has moved from being prescriptive to performance-based.&nbsp; In other words, no&nbsp;longer does the law prescribe that your factory windows must be 10% of the floor size.&nbsp; The duty is simply to ensure that there is sufficient ventilation according to the number of people at work.&nbsp;&nbsp; You decide how to achieve this.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is inadequate wall space for windows, or if windows are not practical in the work environment, alternatives such as forced ventilation or suction fans can be used.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill adopts this performance-based approach in clauses 11 to 19.&nbsp; It requires stakeholders to take all reasonably practical measures to ensure the safety and health of their workers and the public.&nbsp; Under clause 47, the burden is on the party responsible to show that he has taken such reasonably practicable measures.&nbsp; To make sure companies internalise this, they will be required to conduct risk assessments, and take steps to eliminate or minimise identified risks, <p align=left>Column: 2213</p>and disseminate this information.&nbsp; The requirement for risk assessments will be contained in new Regulations made under clause 65(2)(u) of the Bill, which will be passed when the Act is brought into force.&nbsp; To help industry undertake risk assessments, my Ministry, together with our industry partners, has organised seminars and workshops.&nbsp; MOM has also made available a set of Risk Assessment Guidelines illustrating the principles of conducting a proper risk assessment, and providing a basic template.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Helping companies adjust to requirements of the new OSH framework<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM will ensure that there is sufficient guidance for companies to comply with the Act.&nbsp;&nbsp; Industry practitioners will play a central role in guiding this effort through the Workplace Safety and Health Advisory Committee (WSHAC).&nbsp; This 14-member Committee, from a variety of disciplines, was set up in November last year and is chaired by Mr Lee Tzu Yang, Chairman of the Shell Companies in Singapore.&nbsp; This Committee will help develop and revise safety and health standards across different sectors, such as construction, healthcare and metal working.&nbsp; It will assist in promoting OSH to top management through identifying and sharing practical and workable models of best practice.&nbsp; The Committee will also help develop in businesses a mindset of ownership of OSH standards and practices.&nbsp; This has proven&nbsp;elsewhere to be successful in reducing workplace injuries and diseases without sacrificing competitiveness. In fact, leading companies operating in such environments have told us that investments in safety and health&nbsp;enhance competitiveness by improving morale, reducing accidents and enhancing the corporate image.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM will also work with each industry sector to determine practical and realistic standards in the form of Codes of <p align=left>Column: 2214</p>Practice or non-legislative guidance.&nbsp; Clause 39(1) of the Bill allows the Commissioner for Workplace Safety and Health to issue codes of practice, or to adopt any code of practice published by a third-party where suitable.&nbsp; Our intent is that within each sector, there should be published reference points to guide and shape behaviour.&nbsp; There are today some 90 Singapore Standards published by SPRING Singapore on safety.&nbsp;&nbsp; In sectors such as construction, there is already much legislative and other guidance.&nbsp; The Government will continue to work with trade associations and other stakeholders to develop reference points in other regulated sectors over time.&nbsp; But&nbsp;industry itself must take ownership of standards and drive better outcomes. Standards will not improve if industry waits for Government to tell them what must be done, or does the bare minimum to comply even though safety has not been adequately achieved.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also help stakeholders build up their capabilities to better manage OSH at their workplace. As a start, we will be organising a series of seminars for industry and other partners to better understand the new requirements of the law.&nbsp; We will make our enforcement policies and expectations clear.&nbsp; We will help SMEs defray the cost of improving the OSH skills and capabilities of their staff.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond this, we will also be working on growing a larger body of competent OSH professionals to help businesses manage their OSH risks.&nbsp; These professionals, such as safety and health officers and auditors, should take on an expanded role in the longer term.</p><p><br><I>Higher penalties for poor safety management and performance<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even as we work with industry to build up their capabilities to improve <p align=left>Column: 2215</p>safety and health&nbsp;at their workplaces, we need to ensure that the penalties for non-compliance are sufficiently high to effect a cultural change&nbsp;on the ground.&nbsp; Penalties should be set at a level that reflects the true cost of poor safety management, including the cost of disruptions and inconvenience to members of the public which workplace accidents may cause. The collapse of Nicoll Highway not only resulted in the loss of&nbsp;four lives, but also caused millions of dollars in property damage and led to countless lost working hours and great inconvenience to the public. The maximum penalty of $200,000 under the present Factories Act is therefore inadequate.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill contains a revised penalty framework in Part X. &nbsp;First, maximum penalties have been increased.&nbsp; This is reflected in clause 50.&nbsp; For individuals, the maximum fine remains at $200,000, but the maximum period of imprisonment is increased from 12 to 24 months.&nbsp; For corporate offenders, the maximum fine is raised to $500,000.&nbsp; The limit for composition fines has also been raised from $2,000 under the Factories Act, to half the maximum fine on conviction, or $5,000, whichever is lower.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Factories Act contains a stepped penalty regime based on the harm done. The inadequacy of this regime is that it does not allow for meaningful penalties in cases where there are severe lapses, but fortuitously no accidents have occurred.&nbsp; Under the Bill, a single maximum penalty is prescribed. However, the penalty, in any given case, will be applied taking into account all the relevant circumstances, including the culpability of the offender, the potential harm that could have been caused, and the harm actually done.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving enforcement from reaction to prevention is the way forward to reduce <p align=left>Column: 2216</p>deaths and accidents.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I want to assure the House that my Ministry&nbsp;will be reasonable in its enforcement measures.&nbsp; In cases where safety lapses have been identified but where no accidents have occurred, we will first adopt an approach of positive intervention, rather than impose criminal liability. &nbsp;This is possible under clause 21 of the Bill where the Commissioner for Workplace Safety and Health is empowered to make a \"Remedial Order\" compelling a person to remove any workplace risk or comply with a safe work practice, whether or not any imminent danger is posed.&nbsp; We will also use Remedial Orders to require employers to improve the quality of their Risk Assessments if they are found to be lacking, rather than impose penalties upfront.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Changes to technical and administrative provisions<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have explained the main policy changes that will be brought about by this Bill.&nbsp; We are also making some structural changes.&nbsp; Members will note that technical provisions in the Factories Act, such as those relating to cleanliness, ventilation, prime movers and so on, are absent from this Bill. &nbsp;These provisions have been updated and will be enacted by Regulations when the Bill comes into force.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill also effects some administrative changes.&nbsp; The Factories Act is administered by the Commissioner for Labour, with the assistance of the Chief Inspector of Factories.&nbsp; As I have alluded to above, the Bill establishes a new office of the \"Commissioner of Workplace Safety and Health\", who will administer the Act when it is passed and exercise the powers of the Chief Inspector.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing scheme for the registration of factories will continue to operate under separate regulations, but <p align=left>Column: 2217</p>will be simplified to reduce the administrative burden on companies.&nbsp; The current safety officer, safety committee and safety auditor schemes will be preserved, although we have changed the nomenclature to \"Workplace Safety and Health Officer\", \"Workplace Safety and Health Committee\", and \"Workplace Safety and Health Auditor\" in line with the title of the Act.&nbsp; This is reflected in clauses 28, 29 and 30.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p><I>Conclusion<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the passing of this Bill will be a tangible expression that we have learnt from past mistakes.&nbsp; The Bill&nbsp;itself is not the solution,&nbsp;but it will put into place an improved legal framework to get all stakeholders to embed occupational safety and health into their daily operations.&nbsp; Although there is a lot more work to be done, it is a significant first milestone in our journey towards comprehensive protection for our workers and their loved ones. Together, we can make Singapore a safer place to work.&nbsp; I ask all Members of this House to support this Bill.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.30 pm</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> Sir, this legislation to regulate workplace safety comes none too soon.&nbsp; Even with so much scrutiny on worksite accidents after the Nicoll Highway mishap, and the Government vowing to crack down on work-related accidents as well as setting higher&nbsp;standards of safety, fatal worksite accidents continued to occur in 2004 and 2005.&nbsp; Just last Friday, another two workers were injured when a scaffolding collapsed at Keppel Shipyard.&nbsp; In fact, whilst the number of industrial accidents declined from 3,947 cases in 1995 to 3,179 in 2003, the numbers rose again to 3,283 in 2004.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2218</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The situation is especially worrying in the construction sector.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>approach where all stakeholders internalise a safety-first culture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, the new Price-Quality Method (PQM), introduced by the MND last year, to raise the quality attribute in public tenders to between 20 and 40%, would help to entrench safety as a key factor in tenders for construction projects, <p align=left>Column: 2219</p>and motivate contractors to maintain good safety records.&nbsp; However, MOM should urge all Government organisations to adopt this approach in all their tenders where safety is a concern, and not just for construction projects.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, where applicable, these Government organisations should also adopt LTA's reward system for safety performance, where&nbsp;companies can earn safety bonuses based on a percentage of their contract value and, at the same time, face penalties in the form of negative bonuses&nbsp;for poor safety record based on periodic audits of the workplace.&nbsp; This would be a more tangible way to motivate companies to maintain good safety records and instill safety-first practices within the company.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Private companies should also be urged to adopt such bonus payout schemes for good safety performance, as well as separately evaluate price and quality for their tenders so that safety would be viewed&nbsp; as a strong plus factor in securing contracts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister had noted in Parliament last year that the Workplace Safety and Health Council would publish the workplace safety performance of all companies under the ambit of this Bill at regular intervals for the consumption of potential principals, potential employees and insurance companies.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister if the Ministry would be proceeding with this soon.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, re-emphasising the essentials.&nbsp; Hazardous industries like construction, shipbuilding and manufacturing employ the most number of foreign workers.&nbsp; This is particularly so for&nbsp; the construction sector.&nbsp; The task of educating these foreigners on safe habits and practices is made more arduous due to language and cultural barriers.&nbsp; I understand that all <p align=left>Column: 2220</p>construction workers are already required to attend safety orientation courses to equip them with knowledge on common hazards at worksites.&nbsp; These are conducted in their vernacular languages.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, to imbue in these foreign workers a safety culture, the training courses should not just be mere orientation courses, but should be more in depth and in their vernacular, to ensure that the safety message is properly understood.&nbsp; They should also be regularly updated on safety best practices, and work hazards they should avoid.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further reinforce these safety messages&nbsp; and habits, there could be reminders&nbsp; and warnings&nbsp; in pictorial form and/or in languages they can understand, placed at strategic locations at the workplace.&nbsp; For example, signs at construction sites to alert these workers before they climb up the scaffolding or go&nbsp;on to the gondola.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ExxonMobil is a company that has an excellent safety record despite it being in&nbsp;a highly hazardous industry.&nbsp; All bosses and workers and their subcontractors are required to strictly abide by the safety first ethic.&nbsp; There are reminders usually in the form of posters about safety precautions&nbsp; that are placed all over the workplace.&nbsp; For instance, safety messages are even plastered on the risers of steps to remind people of safe habits even as they walk up and down the flight of steps.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, replenishing the&nbsp;resources.&nbsp;&nbsp; Safety inspectors are now given very wide powers and hence need to have&nbsp; the requisite skills and experience to effectively and fairly carry our enforcement.&nbsp; This is because&nbsp; any stop-work order issued would be costly to the affected company.&nbsp; Conversely, if this were not issued when it should, then it could lead to accidents and loss of lives.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2221</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides sending them for longer attachments to countries with better safety records, as suggested by the Minister previously, safety inspectors should also have some local experience in the relevant industry they are to oversee, say, by attachment to a firm so that they have a better understanding of the industry and the inherent risks involved.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM must also ensure that there is adequate manpower to carry out regular surveillance.&nbsp; The Minister noted in March 2005 that MOM has 100 inspectors regulating about 16,000 workplaces.&nbsp; At the extreme, the ratio of one inspector to 160 sites, or roughly one site inspected every two days in a year, is&nbsp;onerous, to say the least.&nbsp; I would like to urge MOM to study best practices in other countries with better safety records to determine what would be an appropriate manpower requirement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst whistle blowing could help prevent some accidents, many workers may still be wary of reporting unsafe work practices, even with the new legislation that protects whistle blowers&nbsp;for fear of negative repercussions, like being found out by the employers and being dismissed.&nbsp; This is especially so for foreign workers who have to pay off debts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, regular inspections would have to be done to act as a deterrent against unsafe practices.&nbsp; This is especially important in the initial years of the implementation of the new Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The qualifications and criteria for independent safety auditors and&nbsp; safety auditing organisations should be reviewed in consultation with the relevant industry to ensure that these personnel have the relevant skills and experience to competently carry&nbsp; out safety audits.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, there should also be a thorough review of the system of site audits and monitoring to ensure that contractors and other employers take <p align=left>Column: 2222</p>steps to immediately rectify the deficiencies identified by the audits. MOM should also conduct more frequent checks of the contractors if the audits of these contractors fall below a certain threshold.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The construction industry is now required to prepare health and safety plans which are to be checked by qualified safety professionals to ensure comprehensiveness and compliance, even before a project gets started.&nbsp; This is a positive move as it ensures that safety is taken into account right from the inception of the project.&nbsp; However, MOM should ensure that&nbsp; appropriately qualified officials undertake the checking so that the project is not unduly delayed due to the lack of experience or incompetence of the checker appointed.&nbsp; Each day of delay could cost the developer and other stakeholders millions of dollars in holding and other costs.&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister how&nbsp;he would ensure that there are enough qualified professionals to ensure the effective implementation of the legislation.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, resolving manpower needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even as we enact tougher legislation to deal with safety violators, we need to review the whole issue of man-year entitlement in the construction industry, and resolve the problem of the illegal sale of MYEs.&nbsp; Talk is rife in the industry that instead of parcelling out their MYEs to the various sub-contractors for a project, some main contractors are selling their MYEs to labour agents to make up for their below-cost suicidal bids.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-contractors desperate for work may resort to hiring such workers, while others resort to hiring illegals.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst this is not a key factor resulting in the poor safety performance of our construction sites, it&nbsp; can exacerbate&nbsp; the problem, since it is unlikely that sub-contractors who secure their foreign workers through such illegal means would&nbsp; ensure that the latter are properly <p align=left>Column: 2223</p>educated on worksite safety practices.&nbsp; As a result not only their lives but the lives of their fellow co-workers could also be endangered.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM has said in June 2005 that about 10% of MYEs allocated to construction companies remain unutilised and, in fact, less than 20% of construction companies have fully utilised their dependency ceiling of 80%.&nbsp; Yet, many industry observers continue to claim that the illegal sale of MYEs&nbsp; through labour agents is common.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides beefing up its enforcement team to clamp down on the hiring of illegal workers, the&nbsp; Ministry should also review the whole mode of allocation of MYEs, taking into account feedback from all players in the industry, which would include both the contractors and the sub-contractors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on another issue related to foreign workers, I would like to urge the Ministry to also focus its attention on the provision of adequate, humane and safe quarters for foreign workers.&nbsp; These foreign workers deserve to be treated with as much dignity as all other workers, and should not be exploited by irresponsible employers and agents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, living in crammed, unhygienic conditions would affect the health of these workers and thus place their lives and those of others at risk at the worksites.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, changing the safety regime from one based on compliance to one based on commitment to safety is a necessary step towards an accident free work environment.&nbsp; We need to change the philosophy of many from one of&nbsp; \"Safety is somebody else's&nbsp; business\" to \"Safety is everybody's business\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An important aspect of this new Bill is to get everyone to take ownership of <p align=left>Column: 2224</p>safety, from the bosses down to the lowliest worker.&nbsp; And as Erik Peyrer, Vice President and General Manager, Asia-Pacific and Middle East, Cooper Cameron, which won MOM's Safety Gold Award for the second time in 2005 notes, \"These things only work if the top man is passionate about&nbsp; it.&nbsp; These things never happen from bottom up.\"&nbsp; Hence, the Government should take the lead, both as a regulator and as a major employer, and work with all other employers to develop a zero tolerance towards unsafe practices and habits and accidents at worksites.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill, but urge&nbsp;MOM to do even more to raise our workplace safety record.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</B></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.59 pm</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Workplace Safety and Health Bill.&nbsp; Workers welcome this Bill.&nbsp; Memories of the major industrial accidents that occurred last year claiming a number of lives are still fresh in our memories and we hope never to see a repeat of that again.&nbsp; This Bill provides a fundamental change from the current prescriptive framework under the Factories Act</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>where managing safety and health is through penalties when an accident occurs, to a more proactive and robust safety and health framework where those who create risk are held responsible for their actions. This Bill is also timely as our progress in health and safety has stagnated and is behind that of many developed countries. Our fatality rate of 4.9 deaths per 100,000 workers is far higher than the 2.5 average for 15 European Union countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what is important under this Bill also is that an employer can be penalised not only after an accident has taken place <p align=left>Column: 2225</p>but even before that, if he fails to comply with the OSH management system that is in place. Also, the penalties for offences have been enhanced. In the wake of the NKF saga and the raging debate on whether or not the Government should introduce legislation to protect whistle blowers,&nbsp;clause 18(2) of the Bill is indeed a progressive move and I must applaud&nbsp;MOM for their farsightedness, although, as I will explain later, I think that even this provision provides limited protection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister whether MOM could set a more robust target. Halving our current occupational fatality rate by 2015 is, in my view, too long a period, considering that many developed countries are already way ahead of us. So the Ministry should set more robust targets to bring our accident rate down as otherwise, by the time we catch up with the rest of the world, they would have leapfrogged even further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other major area which this Bill has not addressed is the tendering system in Singapore which encourages companies to tender as low as possible in order to secure contracts and which could then lead to shortcuts, thus compromising safety. This method of tendering can be seen in all sectors and is certainly most prevalent in the construction sector, where accident rates are one of the highest in Singapore. And because the tender price is low and due to pressures to meet deadlines to avoid hefty penalties, other forms of exploitation may occur, such as making workers work excessively long hours, thus making them prone to accidents which is detrimental to them as well as&nbsp;their co-workers. Sir,&nbsp;a University of Massachusetts study on 11,000 workers over a&nbsp;13-year period shows that long working hours increase a person's chances of illness and injury. It shows that routinely working at least 12 hours a day posed 37% extra risk over those working fewer hours, while a 60-hour <p align=left>Column: 2226</p>week was associated with an increased risk of 23%. If we do not address this problem, which is the way our tender system works, then I am afraid that we will continue to have employers and contractors who will try to cut corners to save costs and this would have an impact on safety measures, regardless of the new law. I hope that the MOM's newly established Workplace Safety and Health Advisory Committee could also address this issue as part of its overall measures to raise safety standards in the four sectors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we also welcome the move to cover more workplaces under this Bill. It is indeed artificial to draw a line at some workplaces and exclude the workers from the protection that the law accords in other workplaces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now come to some specific aspects of the Bill, Sir.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, Sir, public sector unionists are concerned that the Bill has exempted some Government agencies, like the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority,&nbsp;from its scope, when currently they are covered under the existing legislation. They fear that supervisors from these agencies have no clear benchmarks and are not bound by legislation when enforcing safety and health standards which could be detrimental to workers. Our unionists, Sir, are also worried that they have no legal basis to fall back on should they want to discuss about safety and health issues with their management. Under&nbsp;clause 29(2) of the Bill, for instance, there is a mandatory requirement for a Workplace Safety and Health Committee comprising representatives of employees of the workplace as well as employers to review circumstances that will affect the health and safety&nbsp;of persons at the workplace and to do inspections. If these agencies are excluded, Sir, how will workers' voice be represented? I would like to seek a&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2227</p>clarification from the Ministry on the reasons for excluding those public agencies and an assurance that the exempted agencies will still comply with safety standards set by the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second concern raised by workers, Sir, is the hefty fines imposed on workers for a subsequent offence. For the first offence, the maximum punishment is $500 but for a&nbsp;subsequent offence the maximum fine is $2,000. Considering that our median wage is only $1,800, this amount is high for the average worker who would, in most cases, already be penalised with a dismissal if&nbsp;he is found to have caused an accident.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly<B>,</B> Sir, workers are grateful for clause 18, which prohibits employers from dismissing or threatening to dismiss a whistle-blower but they feel that this provision does not go far enough. They pointed out that short of a dismissal or threats to dismiss, an employer can inflict&nbsp;a whole host of other acts of intimidation and harassment against a whistle-blower such as withholding promotions, paying lower bonuses or generally making life so difficult that the person may be forced to resign. I think, Sir, we need a much more comprehensive framework than this to protect whistle-blowers. And I would like to suggest that the Workplace Safety and Health Advisory Committee consider devising such a framework as part of the compulsory standards on occupational safety and health that all companies in the four sectors covered by the Committee will have to adopt. <I>Inter alia</I>, Sir, the framework could cover things like how complaints are to be made, to whom, how would staff confidentiality be protected, what follow up action will be taken and what staff can do in the event that they feel that they are being victimised for whistle-blowing, short of dismissal. The objective, Sir, should be to educate employers that whistle-blowing is indeed <p align=left>Column: 2228</p>an integral part of an effective safety and health management system and whistle-blowers should not be treated as enemies of the company.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth major area of concern, Sir, is on the training of workers. Clause12(3)(e) provides that it is the employers' responsibility \"to ensure that the person at work has adequate instruction, information, training and supervision as is necessary for that person to perform his work\". There are two aspects to this issue. Firstly, there must be adequate measures to make sure that all workers, including foreign workers, are sent for training on the requirements&nbsp;of the new Act. It is difficult for workers to comply with the legal requirements, if they do not know what is required of them under the Act but which will cost them as they will now be exposed to specific penalties. Training should be done on a continuous regular basis and in a language that&nbsp;the workers understand, something particularly important in sectors where there are a lot of foreign workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, Sir, MOM should review the safety training framework, to ensure that workers have full knowledge of the various hazards at work. All workers should be equipped with skills to identify work processes or anything in the environment which are hazardous to their safety and health. This is important as technology and the type of chemicals used at work have expanded so much that it would not be possible for workers to rely on past knowledge and experience&nbsp;alone. Once a hazard is identified, workers should be empowered to stop work or request for relevant expertise to remove or eliminate the hazards, before starting or resuming work. Under&nbsp;clause 21(2), for instance, only the Commissioner can issue a stop-work order but no power is given to the individual worker who is aware of a danger to his safety or that of his co-workers from stopping work.&nbsp;Sir, now <p align=left>Column: 2229</p>that individual workers are made responsible for their actions that will compromise safety, they must first know what are the hazards and be sufficiently empowered to do something once they are aware of the presence of such dangers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fifth area, Sir, is resources. For the new framework to be effective, clearly more resources are required. In March last year, the Minister mentioned that there were only 100 inspectors to do inspection work and that more would be employed. Can the Minister enlighten this House how many more inspectors have since been recruited to implement this Act? Also, do the inspectors have the expertise and are fully equipped to perform the new roles that are required of them under the Act? &nbsp;This role is no longer just punishing employers when an accident takes place&nbsp;but, more importantly, to ensure that there is an effective safety management system at work and that employers comply with that system even before any accident takes place.&nbsp; This requires special and in-depth knowledge of the industry, the work processes involved and the risk posed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sixth area, Sir, which was also mentioned by the Minister last March, was that MOM would make safety records of employers available to the public and insurance companies. Can the Minister also update this House on this initiative? What has been done so far?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, I wish to stress that this Bill provides a useful and progressive framework to improve safety and health at work, and I certainly applaud the&nbsp;MOM for coming up with this Bill. Now that we have the framework in place, the key challenge for all stakeholders, Government, employers and workers alike, is to ensure that it is implementable. For this, we need to have a significant change in mindsets and considerably enhanced capabilities of all stakeholders. Without <p align=left>Column: 2230</p>the total commitment of all parties, we will not be able to achieve a zero accident workplace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I urge all employers to take safety and health at the workplace seriously. This should not be viewed only as a cost factor but, more importantly, it deals with the lives and limbs of our workers which should never be compromised under any circumstances. At the end of the day, although the Bill includes other stakeholders and expands their role, making sure that a workplace is safe is fundamentally the responsibility of employers and this Bill does not dilute that. Sir, for accidents do not just happen - they are caused - workers&nbsp;have a right to a safe working environment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.11 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy&nbsp;Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: .8in 1.3in 1.8in 2.3in 4.7in 5.1in\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: .8in 1.3in 1.8in 2.3in 4.7in 5.1in\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I moved a motion in this House in May 2004, together with my parliamentary colleague Ms Irene Ng, to urge the Government to re-emphasise safety at workplace in&nbsp;Singapore, and to review the current safety standards and practices so as to further enhance the safety of our workers. I am pleased to note that the Government has heeded&nbsp;our call, and has come up with a comprehensive set of legislation to raise the safety standards of our workplaces in the proposed Bill on \"Workplace safety and health\".</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: .8in 1.3in 1.8in 2.3in 4.7in 5.1in\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: .8in 1.3in 1.8in 2.3in 4.7in 5.1in\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, accidents occur at workplaces due to many reasons. Very often, it is attributed to a lack of professionalism and commitment on the various stakeholders at workplaces. Despite stringent safety legislation, there is still a high rate of accidents in certain industries, especially the construction industry. Sir, the root cause of this problem is the lack of safety culture in our workplaces.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: .8in 1.3in 1.8in 2.3in 4.7in 5.1in\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2231</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: .8in 1.3in 1.8in 2.3in 4.7in 5.1in\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the proposed Bill will provide impetus to improve safety standards in our workplaces, we need to ensure that its implementation is effective in building a safety culture among various stakeholders. Otherwise, it will be like having a set of traffic rules without any traffic police to enforce the rules. Sir, the reason why our roads are safe today is not due to our strict traffic rules alone. It is because we have traffic police patrolling our roads daily to ensure road safety.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: .8in 1.3in 1.8in 2.3in 4.7in 5.1in\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: .8in 1.3in 1.8in 2.3in 4.7in 5.1in\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite that, we still have many road users flouting the traffic rules, resulting in accidents at times. Sir, while it is possible to develop a safety culture, we need a strong enforcement regime to \"nurture\" the various stakeholders of our workplaces. However, due to the large number of workplaces in Singapore, the Ministry may face problems in enforcing the Act. That is why&nbsp;safety rules were sometimes enforced after accidents had occurred. Thus, the Act may not be effective in preventing accidents at workplaces.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: .8in 1.3in 1.8in 2.3in 4.7in 5.1in\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: .8in 1.3in 1.8in 2.3in 4.7in 5.1in\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would propose&nbsp;to the Ministry to&nbsp;appoint an enforcement agency, such as SPRING, to enforce safety at workplaces regularly. We must conduct more random checks to ensure that our workplaces&nbsp;are safe at all times. With regular enforcement like the traffic police, we will be able to effectively promote safe workplace practices among all stakeholders.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: .8in 1.3in 1.8in 2.3in 4.7in 5.1in\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: .8in 1.3in 1.8in 2.3in 4.7in 5.1in\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the construction and chemical manufacturing and gas bottling industries have been identified by MOM as hot spots where a high number of accidents occurred due to unsafe practices. Sir, let me use the construction industry as an example to illustrate the undesirable state of the industry, and propose how the Workplace Safety and Health Act can be implemented to develop a safety culture in <p align=left>Column: 2232</p>the industry.

This problem is further aggravated by the intense competition through open tendering, and the inclusion of safety provisions in competitive tendering. The undesirable outcome is that contractors who won tenders at the lowest bids or highly competitive bids are unable to provide adequate safety measures to prevent accidents happening on site. Sir, I have proposed before that we should set a specific sum for safety based on the size of the contract, and it should not be subject to tendering.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the lack of understanding among designers on the construction risks of various designs has also further increased safety risks at workplaces. For example, certain architectural designs, such as protruding structures, have made it difficult for contractors to erect scaffolding or temporary structures to construct, thus increasing construction risks unnecessarily.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the&nbsp;three key approaches as taken by the proposed Bill as follows:</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Reduce risks at source;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Promote industry ownership; and</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Punish poor safety management practices.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, reducing risks at source. &nbsp;Sir, research has shown that more than 60% of construction accidents are attributed to poor planning and design. Therefore, we need to focus on the practices of developers and consultants of building projects. How can developers and <p align=left>Column: 2233</p>consultants play a role to enhance safety in the construction industry?</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the new Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Management) Regulations as proposed in the Bill. Although there is a requirement to conduct risk assessment before work commences, it may be difficult for contractors to reduce risks at source if the risks are already incorporated in the design of a project. To be effective, it is crucial that risk assessment be conducted at the design stage. In this way, risks can be removed or managed with safe designs or&nbsp;appropriate safety measures during construction.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another key contributing factor of construction accidents is the planning of construction site and its activities. The poor planning of site layout and processes will lead to an unsafe work environment. As such, more needs to be done to train contractors on site planning and work processes so as to make our workplaces safer.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two, promoting industry ownership.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the approach to promote greater ownership among the stakeholders of our workplaces.&nbsp; Although the spelling out of the duties of all stakeholders, such as occupiers, employers, self-employed persons, principals and persons at work, will provide better accountability, there is a need to ensure that all stakeholders are properly trained and capable of fulfilling their duties.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, I fully support the appointments of Workplace Safety and Health Officers and co-ordinators, Workplace Safety and Health Committee, and Workplace Safety and Health Auditors as proposed in clauses 28, 29 and 30 of the Bill. All these appointments will set the framework to ensure adequate checks and balances on the respective stakeholders in fulfilling their duties.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2234</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I would caution against the use of performance-based approach in encouraging greater ownership on safety. Experiences in other countries have shown mixed results in the use of performance-based approach. This is due to the lack of knowledge and commitment among various stakeholders. While it is true that the prescriptive nature of the current Factories Act has created a \"minimum compliance\" mindset among stakeholders, the industry, especially the construction industry, is not ready and fully equipped to adopt a performance-based approach on safety.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the present competitive environment, a performance-based approach for safety may result in more accidents on site as stakeholders will most likely adopt a \"no need to comply\" mindset. Our tendering evaluation system which focuses on the lowest bids will further enhance this \"no need to comply\" mindset as many stakeholders, especially designers and contractors, may not&nbsp;know or&nbsp;see the potential safety hazards of a project.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I propose that we should adopt a hybrid method of using both prescriptive and performance-based approaches to safety. Certain high-risk areas will require more stringent prescriptive rules for compliance. For example, safety measures to prevent falls from height, measures for deep excavation works, or handling of inflammable materials on site.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance-based approach can instead be adopted for low-risk areas, such as house-keeping matters. The key objective is to reduce both fatalities and minor accidents on site. Sir, many minor accidents have occurred at workplace without much attention being paid to them. Many workers have suffered various disabilities, thus affecting their earning abilities. I hope the proposed Bill <p align=left>Column: 2235</p>will comprehensively address these minor accidents too.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides promoting industry ownership, the Ministry of Manpower must also take ownership and adopt a more hands-on approach to effectively implement the Act.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three,&nbsp;punish poor safety management practices.&nbsp; Sir, I support the imposition of greater financial disincentives and penalties on workplaces with unsafe systems before accidents occur on site. This will serve as an effective deterrence to unsafe practices, and foster a safer work culture. Clause 47 of the Bill which places the onus of proving what is reasonably practicable on the accused will impose more responsibility on various stakeholders to think through their workplace safety practices.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They no longer can rely solely on the \"minimum compliance\" of rules as having done due diligence in providing a safe work environment. I hope the stakeholders will understand the seriousness of this clause, and change their attitude towards safety at our workplaces.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, one of the key hurdles in developing a safety culture at workplaces in Singapore is cost. Who should pay for the safety of our workplace and workers?&nbsp; I have mentioned in my motion on workplace safety that we should not subject the provisions of safety to competitive tendering. This will definitely result in corner-cutting and safety lapses. Instead, we should have an independent safety checker system to vet through designs, and develop a safety management system for each workplace or construction project. This is especially so for high risk and complex projects or workplaces.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2236</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to develop a safety culture would require the investment of a safe workplace infrastructure and system, and the total commitment of all stakeholders of the industry. I do not believe that safety at workplaces can be self-regulated or achieved through a performance-based approach. Safety must be inculcated through a top-down approach whereby authorities and top management of firms commit to champion it. Thus, I would propose&nbsp;the following follow-up actions for the Ministry to consider:</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; The Ministry of Manpower must allocate more resources to conduct regular enforcement on workplace safety. This will incur more Government expenditure and show commitment on the part of the Government to protect our workers. Besides enforcement, the Ministry should launch an extensive outreach campaign to promote workplace safety and health. The Ministry should also accredit training institutions providing safety courses to ensure consistency and high training standards.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Occupiers of workplaces should be committed to invest on the safety infrastructure to provide a safe work environment for all our workers.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Employers must ensure that all workers are properly trained to adopt safe work practices. In addition, they must set up proper safety management system to facilitate the nurturing of a safety culture.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Self-employed persons must take on more individual responsibilities to adopt safe work practices.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; Principals of specialist works must be more hands-on to ensure that workers undertaking their works are properly trained to install their systems on site safely.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp; Every worker at our workplaces must place \"Safety First\" and protect themselves accordingly. Workers must be <p align=left>Column: 2237</p>more vigilant at workplaces, and look after one another to reduce accidents.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I hope the Ministry will take the lead to champion and enhance the safety of all workers in Singapore. We should change the slogan of&nbsp; \"Safety First\" to \"Safety Saves Lives\" so that all stakeholders will understand the importance of providing and working in a safe environment.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Alexander Chan Meng Wah--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.25 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Alexander Chan Meng Wah:</B>&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak on the Bill.&nbsp; I rise to speak in support of the Workplace Safety and Health Bill aimed at achieving quantum improvements in workplace safety and health and in making workplaces in Singapore one of the safest in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the work of the Ministry, safety standards have improved steadily for the past decade.&nbsp; Industrial accident frequency rates fell from 2.8 per million man-hours worked in 1994 to 2.2 per million man-hours worked in 2004.&nbsp; But as we have stated before, in the case of occupational fatality, this is still double that in the safer developed countries.&nbsp; And the Bill therefore aims correctly to halve this rate in the next 10 years.&nbsp; We also have our share of workplace accidents, several of them high profile ones involving the loss of precious lives in a variety of industries and workplaces.&nbsp; Each of those lives lost or workers seriously hurt as a result of poor workplace safety practices cannot be condoned.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the years ahead, with the growing emphasis on entrepreneurship, this country will see the birth of many new local companies.&nbsp; I anticipate that many of these businesses will have managements <p align=left>Column: 2238</p>which will not have had the benefit and experience of being part of a larger and more established multinational environment.&nbsp; As such, these managements will have to originate their company practices, including its workplace safety and health practices.&nbsp; I sincerely hope that we do not see a cycle of declining workplace safety and health as a result of this economic progression.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this revamped Workplace Safety and Health Bill is timely.&nbsp; Providing a safe working environment is the duty of every employer, but its achievement is also a shared responsibility of every employee.&nbsp; Under the new goal setting framework that&nbsp;more emphasis be placed on stakeholders to self-regulate and manage risks at source, I welcome this emphasis to foster a safety culture and to make safety an integral aspect of the workplace.&nbsp; What is&nbsp;noteworthy is the non-prescriptive nature of the Bill.&nbsp; This puts the onus on employers to make proper risk assessments that are specific to their business and to develop and then to put in place health and safety measures that are preventative in nature and appropriate to the work environment.&nbsp; This would avoid unnecessary costs for overburdensome measures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do note that in the Third Schedule of the proposed Bill, listing occupational diseases,</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>only repetitive strain disorders of the upper limbs&nbsp;are listed.&nbsp; What about similar disorders for the lower back, for example, in cases where repetitive lifting work is carried out?&nbsp;&nbsp;We certainly are not intending to only provide for the office worker and not for the manual worker involved in heavy manual lifting work. So I would like to propose that these be considered for inclusion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill will have an overall effect of raising the professionalism of those involved in safety and health practices. Companies must therefore respond <p align=left>Column: 2239</p>proactively to the Bill and invest in the skills upgrading of their staff involved in these areas. Such investment must extend beyond safety and health officers. It needs to engage management and supervisors who are involved in operations as well.&nbsp; Management must appreciate that this is an investment we must make. This will ensure that every company develops a safety culture that is sustainable by the staff and workers in the company.&nbsp; This will help Singapore companies, not just those operating in Singapore but also Singapore companies operating overseas, to be one of the safest in the world to work in.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also want to say that the Ministry has actively sought feedback on the proposed Bill. Several dialogue sessions were held with members of both SNEF and the Singapore Business Federation, and many of the feedback from companies have been incorporated in the Bill.&nbsp; I therefore support the Ministry not only for proposing the Bill, but also engaging the industry in the process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am in full support of it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.30 pm</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me thank Members - Dr Amy Khor, Mdm Halimah, Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Alex Chan - for their full support on this Bill.&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor said that it was none too soon.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah said that it was timely.&nbsp; All of them gave full support to the principles.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is&nbsp;clear consensus that this framework will allow us to be more effective. This is the right direction to go.&nbsp; There is also clear consensus that there is a lot to be done.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have said, the Bill that this House passes today is not the solution.&nbsp; It allows us the framework to step up our efforts and, indeed, there is a lot to do. There <p align=left>Column: 2240</p>were many issues that were brought up as we talked about why safety was what it was, management, culture, entrepreneurialism, MYEs, worker training,&nbsp;worker welfare, and they are all correct.&nbsp; At the end of the day, all these aspects&nbsp;-&nbsp;any one of these factors&nbsp;- can lead to a safety lapse, because&nbsp;an accident occurs at that point.&nbsp;&nbsp;I read accident reports that come across my desk.&nbsp;&nbsp;You find that even though certain safeguards have been put in place, ridiculous accidents happen because there is a lack of attention, whether it is due to fatigue or&nbsp;a variety of other reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, MOM is quite clear on the magnitude of this task.&nbsp; I want to assure Members that we are fully committed.&nbsp; Many of you have said that MOM and Government should take the lead.&nbsp; And, indeed, we will.&nbsp; Indeed, we will step up our measures.&nbsp;I welcome Members' re-enforcement that MOM&nbsp;should be given more resources for this and&nbsp;I will&nbsp;remind the relevant agencies&nbsp;that you have also&nbsp;backed us when we ask for more resources.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to clarify a point though where some Members touched on the number of safety officers that MOM has.&nbsp; For this framework to work, it cannot depend on&nbsp;100 or so safety inspectors that I have.&nbsp; And, indeed, no system works as such.&nbsp; We will have, as many of the Members alluded to, both by Dr Amy Khor and Mdm Halimah, to professionalise the safety management system, which includes safety auditors, safety officers as well as safety and health management committees.&nbsp; It is akin to saying that we need a proper audit system&nbsp;and if you only have a couple of people at IRAS, it just does not work.&nbsp; You need a whole industry of safety auditors and safety accountants to make sure&nbsp;that your financial accounting is in order.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current legislation, safety auditors are compulsory.&nbsp; They must conduct mandatory safety audits for selected groups of industries and this is <p align=left>Column: 2241</p>maintained. For example, for construction companies with worksites, a contract sum higher or equal to $30 million - I think Dr Teo Ho Pin brought up the point&nbsp;- we should have an independent audit. This is already mandated by law.&nbsp; Or shipyards hiring 200 or more workers or factories engaged in the processing or manufacturing of&nbsp;petroleum, petroleum&nbsp;products, petrochemicals, petrochemical products, or factories engaged in manufacture of fabricated metal products, machinery or equipment with a&nbsp;hundred or more persons are employed.&nbsp; It is already mandated.&nbsp; So you will need to leverage off this system.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Members talked about qualifications. The qualifications of safety auditors, which are mandated, are that they must have at least a recognised degree, ie,&nbsp;a degree holder in the relevant field or registered safety officer, with at least five years of related industrial working experience, at least three years of auditing-related practical experience and passed the&nbsp;MOM's accredited course, \"Workshop for Safety Auditors\", or its equivalent.&nbsp; We&nbsp;currently have about 20 approved safety auditor organisations and 100 approved auditors amongst them. So there is already a framework and&nbsp;we have to build on this framework.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, there is a second layer of safety officers. These are officers registered by MOM to provide assistance and advice. Full-time safety officers are required.&nbsp; I am giving some examples -&nbsp;and this is not an exhaustive list&nbsp;- shipyards with 100 or more persons or&nbsp;factories where 500 or more persons are employed.&nbsp; Part-time safety officers are also required for certain categories and the qualification requirements are diploma in the relevant field and at least three years of practical experience.&nbsp; There are currently&nbsp;2,000 registered safety officers.&nbsp; We will have to build this and we will have to professionalise it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2242</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see the next&nbsp;few years MOM&nbsp;engaging industries, together with the Workplace Safety and Health&nbsp;Council, to steadily step up the engagement of this community of professional&nbsp;safety officers. They must play an integral role in this framework.&nbsp; Because I agree with Members that if you just have a performance-based system, and if management decides that they are going to just delegate this, there must be a system of checks-and-balances.&nbsp; And what Dr Teo Ho Pin said was correct.&nbsp; If the employer thinks that a performance-based system is a non-compliance based system, then I think they will very quickly run afoul of our law and our inspections.&nbsp; Because compliance is required to ensure that they&nbsp;minimise the risk.&nbsp; So in certain cases, our safety inspectors can go to a site and say, \"Where is your report by a registered safety officer or registered safety inspector?&nbsp;This has been improved.&nbsp; Now, you,&nbsp;management, what have you done to minimise the risk?\"&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the current Factories Act, if no accidents occurred, it was very hard to penalise. Under the current Bill, we can penalise you for not having taken action.&nbsp; As I have said, we will be reasonable in our enforcement.&nbsp; We will issue a Remedial Order.&nbsp; But if someone does not comply, and even if there is no accident, he can be penalised.&nbsp; That is the radical change in which other countries have adopted and&nbsp;that is&nbsp;what we are also doing.&nbsp; A performance-based system does not mean that I can just (1)&nbsp; delegate it away; and (2) have a written report but not act on this.&nbsp; In fact, this would have to be seen through.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But while Government would lead, MOM will be engaged, as&nbsp;Members have asked for.&nbsp; I want to be realistic that industries must come aboard.&nbsp; If we cannot get management to be intricately&nbsp;pushing this, there will be a limit to what we can do.&nbsp; Because I can appoint 16,000 safety officers&nbsp;at whatever <p align=left>Column: 2243</p>workplaces,&nbsp;one for each worksite,&nbsp;they&nbsp;will be scurrying around.&nbsp; We can stop all work&nbsp;and the only way you can stop work accidents is to stop all work.&nbsp; But that will grind our economy to a halt.&nbsp; So we have to do it at&nbsp;a pace which is reasonable and we will have to live, if you like, with the inefficiencies that&nbsp;Members talk about - the MYEs and the training - and tackle these problems at the same time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For training, I am agreeable to Members' suggestions that we should step it up.&nbsp; I agree that that is an integral part of the downstream event where workers need to&nbsp;know what their rights are, including welfare rights, because&nbsp;Members are quite right.&nbsp; If you make me work 16 hours a day and it is against the Employment Act, you should be able to complain to MOM and we will act.&nbsp; But I also want to know what the management must do to ensure that it is a safe environment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have already begun thinking on this, engaging industries to move at&nbsp;a pace that is comfortable, together with the Council, how we can step up the training, as Dr Teo Ho Pin said, to have accredited training institutions, to also require certification, not only of foreign workers, but on all workers.&nbsp; In other words, if you do not know what basic safety rules are, then are you safe to be allowed in a particular industry - the chemical industry or the construction industry?&nbsp; And we have to think about that and we need to move along those lines. As we said,&nbsp;we also have to professionalise the&nbsp;industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to see how to engage them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the tender system, we agree that it plays a part, but I want us to be careful to always associate the lowest tenderer with the employer who cuts the most corners.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, that is not always true.&nbsp; I have seen contractors who have been <p align=left>Column: 2244</p>competitive, and yet, have the safest safety record.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in Singapore, with our current restrictions of MYE and tender, I can show you many examples of good developers and contractors who have got excellent safety records and yet remain competitive.&nbsp; So I do not want to perpetuate this notion that you can only be competitive if you cut corners, and you are unsafe.&nbsp; If you choose to do that, that is fine. The law will catch up with you.&nbsp; We have enhanced penalties and the penalties are meant to reduce risk-taking.&nbsp; And risk-taking also means working your employees to such an extent that they are so tired to disregard safety, in that sense.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were some other issues that were talked about.&nbsp; I just want to address them briefly.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked whether exemption of certain groups meant that they were not bound.&nbsp; And she quite rightly pointed out that certain groups were exempted - the SAF, the Police and the&nbsp;SCDF.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us understand that given their mission, they require that operational flexibility.&nbsp; But let me clarify that exemption from the current Workplace&nbsp;Safety and Health Bill does not exempt you from all Acts, for example, the Penal Code still applies.&nbsp;If there is a criminal negligence, in terms of other laws that govern them,&nbsp;they are still governed by other laws. This is not the only law that compels reasonable behaviour. But having said that, as it pertains to this Workplace Safety and Health Bill, we are working with these various agencies. While we understand the reasons for exempting them, we are working very closely with them. These agencies, I must say,&nbsp;have come on-board, to want to make sure that their structures and their processes comply in spirit as well as the requirements of this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some&nbsp;Members have asked whether&nbsp;they have safety and health management committees.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is an issue that we want to address and I think many of them have.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah also asked&nbsp;whether <p align=left>Column: 2245</p>these safety and health management committees work out processes by which, whether you are exempted or included in the law, they can bring up these issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is something worth considering.&nbsp; How do you put in processes so that there is some protection, not only of the individual workers standing up against the system and being terrified of having to come up with a system?&nbsp; I think, in the extreme, we know that MOM and the unions would protect them.&nbsp; But in between, we will give them much more comfort levels. So let us explore that to see how we can expand, even apart from clause 18 which protects whistle-blowers,&nbsp;their comfort space.&nbsp;&nbsp;The best position, as Mdm Halimah says, is where management welcomes somebody and does not even see him as a whistle-blower, but as providing active feedback.&nbsp; If we move towards that culture, we have succeeded to a great extent.&nbsp; But in the process, let us see how we can liberalise or increase that space in which workers can also contribute without fear or retribution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin talked about reducing further risk&nbsp;from design.&nbsp; He is quite right. Some jurisdictions compel or have legislation to even affect architects and designers.&nbsp; I think that is the position that we want to move to finally, where you can reduce risk from design.&nbsp; It is a goal but this framework allows us to move towards that goal and&nbsp;in time, we will get there, which brings me to the point of setting targets.&nbsp; I do not want us to give the impression that just because I set a 10-year target&nbsp;for 2015, I will be happy if I reach there.&nbsp; That is not the stance.&nbsp; It is a target that I deem realistic knowing all these factors.&nbsp; But let me assure the House that we will work very hard and if we accomplish those targets beforehand, I will celebrate it with you and you can tell me, \"Let us push to the next target\", as I know you will.&nbsp; But it is a working target.&nbsp; Rest assured that even though it is 2015, we will work very hard to achieve that together with Members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2246</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Members asked about reporting of accidents.&nbsp; They are quite right.&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to have a framework where there is information.&nbsp; Many of&nbsp;you asked and I am quite astonished with&nbsp;your memory that&nbsp;you remember&nbsp;what I said last year that&nbsp;we will put out&nbsp;information out there.&nbsp; Let me give you an update.&nbsp; Yes, we are on course to do that.&nbsp; But in order to do that, I need to effect a reporting system.&nbsp; I do not want to capture information that employers or workplaces have the ability to decide what information goes in. I want to capture the novel information as it occurs. So I need to strengthen the system, which is the mandatory reporting system.&nbsp; This is something that we will work at.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

In other words, any accident that occurs at the workplace that requires, say, X number of MCs must be reported or there is a liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will take time, but we will do it soon.&nbsp; We will put in a system that requires safety reporting so that when we gather this information, it is robust.&nbsp; In other words, the report card is sensible.&nbsp; It cannot be just because&nbsp;they are finding loopholes and&nbsp;are persuading&nbsp;their workers not to report it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that information, we will put it out to the public so that developers who use contractors or other principals downstream will know what the safety records are.&nbsp; I completely agree with Dr Amy Khor that it cannot just be penalties.&nbsp; And the reason why the Second Reading speech has been stanced this way is because this is a reading of the Bill.&nbsp; But if Members remember, last year, we also had&nbsp;taken proactive measures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we have to enforce but the key&nbsp;is&nbsp;that we have to get the industry working with us, which is why the Workplace Safety and Health Council is pivotal to this.&nbsp; If we move too fast, the industry <p align=left>Column: 2247</p>will say, \"Well, I can't take it.&nbsp;

But as I said in my Second Reading speech, if we are going to be effective, and as Dr Amy Khor said, we have to reach to the last man in the workplace.&nbsp; Because, at any given time on&nbsp;any given day, when there is rain and he has to work at night, safety may be the last thing on his mind.&nbsp; And our challenge is to make sure that it is not the last thing on his mind.&nbsp; That will take the combined efforts of legislation, promotion, making sure training is adequate, making sure that it is a safety ordered system, and safety inspectors making sure that management is on board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since a number of measures have taken place since 2004, I must tell&nbsp;Members that there has been an increase in engagement, and this is a good sign.&nbsp; I&nbsp; am not quite satisfied about the pace but I am quite encouraged that there is now a framework that we can ramp up our efforts.&nbsp;

We are mindful that any surprise emergency exercise involving large numbers of the public may lead to unnecessary panic and anxiety. Prior to an exercise, there will be publicity to give an indication of when the exercise would take place and what the public should expect. On the day of the exercise and just before the exercise commences, signs are put up and announcements are also made to assure the public that an exercise is being conducted and that there is no need to panic. Staff are deployed to guide, answer queries, and to explain the situation to members of the public who are affected by the exercise and who may not have understood the announcements. In addition, safety officers are deployed to look out for the safety of the public and to prevent accidents.&nbsp; Teams of paramedics and ambulances are also put on standby to respond to any injuries.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question of whether anyone would be responsible should there be a fatality during an emergency exercise depends on whether there is any negligence in the conduct of the exercise or the actions of the officers involved.&nbsp; The public can rest assured that every precaution will be taken to guard against this during the planning and execution of the exercise.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><p align=left>Column: 2251<p><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:OVERHEAD PEDESTRIAN BRIDGES--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>OVERHEAD PEDESTRIAN BRIDGES</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Accessible to elderly and disabled--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Accessible to elderly and disabled)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mdm Halimah Yacob </B>asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will (i) consider modifying the existing overhead pedestrian bridges which have very high steps, to make them more accessible to the elderly and disabled persons; and (ii) ensure that all new overhead pedestrian bridges that are built, will be elderly and disabled-friendly.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Cheow Tong--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah Yacob asked if pedestrian overhead bridges (POBs) will have lower steps to make them more accessible to the elderly and the disabled, and whether the new bridges that LTA builds will be elderly and disabled-friendly.<p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As mentioned in our response to a similar query by the Honourable Member Mr Ivan Png at the last Committee of Supply, LTA has revised the design of the staircases of new POBs to conform to BCA's Code of Practice on Barrier-Free Accessibility in Buildings since 2000.&nbsp; The step heights of POBs have been reduced from 175mm to 150mm while the <p align=left>Column: 2253<p>step widths have also been increased from 288mm to 300mm. As for existing bridges, the new standards will apply as and when they are due for replacement as it is not cost effective to conduct a massive replacement exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, LTA will look into providing ramps for POBs where there is a need, for instance, where there are no at-grade crossings nearby, and where space permits. Generally this applies to POBs spanning expressways and semi-expressways. In addition, LTA will also be implementing colour contrast strips at the edge of each step to enable the elderly and the visually handicapped to discern the steps better.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much as we would like to make POBs more accessible to the elderly and the disabled, it is not possible to provide ramps across-the-board, given that many POBs are located in densely built-up areas, with land-take constraints.&nbsp; In fact, at-grade crossings are more accessible than POBs and are the preferred form of crossing for the elderly and physically challenged.&nbsp; Therefore, to better meet the needs of this group, LTA will endeavour to provide more at-grade crossings at suitable locations.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><p align=left>Column: 2253<p><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY FUND--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY FUND</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Increase and flexibility--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Increase and flexibility)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

As a result, low income applicants today receive a grant of up to 90% of the cost of assistive devices, instead of 75% previously. The National Council of Social Service (NCSS), which administers the Fund, would disburse the grant according to the financial needs of the applicant.&nbsp;&nbsp; Needy applicants who are unable to pay their share of the cost despite the subsidy can approach NCSS, which will look at each case based on its own merit.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-date, the grants under the AT Fund are sufficient for most persons with disabilities. Based on applications to date, the average cost of assistive technology devices is about $3,160.&nbsp; Only two out of the 122 cases required a grant that was near the $10,000 cap.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NCSS is also setting up Assistive Technology Centres (ATCs) to help the disabled acquire affordable assistive technology devices. The ATCs will help the disabled with the procurement, training, maintenance, and after-sales support. To keep the technology affordable, the ATCs will work with the private sector in the research, development and <p align=left>Column: 2255<p>marketing of affordable assistive technology devices. To-date, NCSS has set up one ATC at the Society for the Physically Disabled. It is looking to set up an additional centre for the hearing impaired by the end of 2006.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given these arrangements, we do not think it is necessary to review the $10,000 cap at this point in time.</p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag --><!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES--><P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
