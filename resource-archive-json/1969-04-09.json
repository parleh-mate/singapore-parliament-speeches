The quantum of compensation  is\r\n\r\nbased  on  the  earnings of a workman, including  any\r\n\r\nprivilege  or  benefit  which  can  be  estimated  in\r\n\r\nmonetary terms.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For computation of the amount of compensation\r\n\r\npayable, the monthly average earning for all  classes\r\n\r\nof  adult  workers is estimated to be $200.

Whether or  not\r\n\r\nan   Adoption  Order  is  proof  of  one's  birth  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will depend on the terms of the order  and\r\n\r\nevidence before the court making the order. If  proof\r\n\r\nof place of birth is furnished to the satisfaction of\r\n\r\nthe court, it will be stated in the order itself.  In\r\n\r\nsuch  cases, a citizen (pink) laminated identity card\r\n\r\nwill be issued. If however a birth certificate cannot\r\n\r\nbe  produced  and all that is relied  upon  to  prove\r\n\r\nplace of birth is a statutory declaration, then  this\r\n\r\nevidence would not be conclusive evidence of place of\r\n\r\nbirth,  but  only prima facie evidence in support  of\r\n\r\nit. In such cases, a non-citizen (blue) identity card\r\n\r\nwill be issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also pertinent to point out to the hon.

The Government has encouraged bus companies\r\n\r\nto  operate school bus services through the offer  of\r\n\r\nrelatively  low licence fees and taxes.  Up  to  20th\r\n\r\nMarch,  1969, the Changi, Hock Lee, Katong-Bedok  and\r\n\r\nGreen  Bus  Companies operated a total  of  11  buses\r\n\r\npicking  up only school children at designated  stops\r\n\r\nalong  their usual bus routes. In addition, a  scheme\r\n\r\nhas  been  worked out to provide special bus services\r\n\r\nfor pupils who are residing in certain constituencies\r\n\r\nbut  who  are  studying outside their constituencies.\r\n\r\nFrom 17th March this year, the Green Bus Company  has\r\n\r\nbeen running special school buses to transport pupils\r\n\r\nwho  live  in the Bukit Panjang Constituency  to  and\r\n\r\nfrom  Toh  Tuck Primary School.

Within  a  short\r\n\r\nperiod of 2\u00bd months, after the decision to run  these\r\n\r\nspecial  classes was made, the Adult Education  Board\r\n\r\nhas  successfully  launched these classes  for  5,000\r\n\r\nstudents,  which  is a very outstanding  achievement.\r\n\r\nSince  these special classes would cater for students\r\n\r\nwho  were unsuccessful more than once in the  Primary\r\n\r\nSchool  Leaving Examination, it was agreed  that  the\r\n\r\nprogramme  should lay emphasis on craft training  and\r\n\r\nthe  acquisition of technical skills. While there was\r\n\r\nprovision  for academic subjects, e.g., the  Language\r\n\r\nof  instruction, Science, Mathematics and Civics, the\r\n\r\ncontent  of  these  subjects  would  relate  to   the\r\n\r\npractical  and  real-life  situation  and   not   the\r\n\r\nabstract.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syllabuses were drawn up for each subject to\r\n\r\nindicate  the  items to be taught, the skills  to  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped  and the attitudes to be inculcated.  Since\r\n\r\nthe  programme was being launched for the first time,\r\n\r\nit  was felt that the syllabuses should be considered\r\n\r\nexperimental,  to  be modified and  adjusted  in  the\r\n\r\nlight  of  actual experience gained in  the  teaching\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syllabuses drawn up covered (i) Language, (ii)\r\n\r\nMathematics   and   Science,   (iii)   Civics,   (iv)\r\n\r\nDressmaking and Tailoring, (v) Homecraft and Cookery,\r\n\r\n(vi) Metalwork and (vii) Woodwork.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 13th January, 1969, before the classes\r\n\r\ncommenced  operations, supervisors, senior assistants\r\n\r\nand  teachers of the special classes were briefed  on\r\n\r\nthe  objectives  of the programme and the  syllabuses\r\n\r\nintroduced to them.

On the 14th May, 1968, during  the\r\n\r\ndebate on the President's Speech, I mentioned that  I\r\n\r\nwas  fully aware of the pirate taxi problem  and  the\r\n\r\neconomic effects on the bus and taxi operators if the\r\n\r\npirate  taxis were to be legalised. I had  then  also\r\n\r\nstated that to legalise pirate taxis is equivalent to\r\n\r\nsuggesting  the legalisation of smuggling activities.\r\n\r\nI have not changed my view since.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that pirate taxis, though running illegally,\r\n\r\nare performing a form of social function in providing\r\n\r\nan  element of public transport service. But they are\r\n\r\nperforming this function at the expense of  the  law-abiding  licensed taxis and the bus  companies.  They\r\n\r\nare able to operate at a much lower cost because they\r\n\r\npay   less   tax,   incur  very  little   maintenance\r\n\r\nexpenditure and pay no insurance cover for  passenger\r\n\r\nliability.  Thus,  they offer an  unhealthy  type  of\r\n\r\ncompetition  to  the  licensed  operators  which   is\r\n\r\nharmful  to  our long-term planning for  an  improved\r\n\r\npublic transport service in Singapore.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August last year, I established a Transport\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Board with the objective of  improving  the\r\n\r\npresent  inadequacy of public transport services  and\r\n\r\nam   glad  to  say  that  modest  progress  has  been\r\n\r\nachieved. To date, there has been an increase  of  80\r\n\r\nnew  buses  operating on the road and more new  buses\r\n\r\nare  expected in the near future. As the adequacy and\r\n\r\nefficiency of the public transport services  improve,\r\n\r\nthere  should be a consequent decrease in the  number\r\n\r\nof pirate taxis running on the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

We  know  that  there are  numerous  shipping\r\n\r\ncompanies  which  are registered in Singapore.  These\r\n\r\nshipping companies should be requested to get rid  of\r\n\r\nthe  foreign seamen they employ and replace them with\r\n\r\nSingapore  seamen.

For  example,  a   Chinese\r\n\r\nbusinessman begins his career as an apprentice  doing\r\n\r\nodd  jobs. So we should train our seamen on the  same\r\n\r\nbasis.  We  should  request  these  foreign  shipping\r\n\r\ncompanies  to take on a few apprentices from  amongst\r\n\r\nour  citizens to do odd jobs in the ship.

Out of a total of 529 books published  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  in 1968, 429 were printed in the Republic.\r\n\r\nOf the 100 books printed outside the country, 87 were\r\n\r\nprinted in West Malaysia, 12 in Hong Kong and one  in\r\n\r\nthe Philippines.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to those local publications printed in\r\n\r\nWest Malaysia, most of them are textbooks and are for\r\n\r\nMalaysian  clientele.

Depending   on\r\n\r\nlegislation and tariffs alone is not the  right  kind\r\n\r\nof  approach  to help solve the problems  facing  the\r\n\r\nlocal  printing industry or the Republic as a  whole.\r\n\r\nThat  will not improve the situation. These  measures\r\n\r\nmay,  on  the  contrary, increase the burden  on  our\r\n\r\nreaders  and  particularly on  the  parents  who  buy\r\n\r\ntextbooks   and  other  reference  books  for   their\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, the percentage of local publications\r\n\r\nprinted  in Singapore is comparatively high and  does\r\n\r\nnot  appear to warrant any protective measures in the\r\n\r\nform  of  legislation, tariffs, etc, for our printing\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The positive measures should be, I think, to assist\r\n\r\nthe local printers to build an efficient industry  so\r\n\r\nthat  they can keep abreast with the modern  printing\r\n\r\nworld. Although Singapore compares favourably in book\r\n\r\nprinting  with  other Asian countries,  our  printers\r\n\r\nstill have to modernise so that they are capable  not\r\n\r\nonly   of  meeting  local  demands,  but  also   more\r\n\r\nimportant, of breaking into the international market.\r\n\r\nTo this end, a Printing Industry Advisory Council was\r\n\r\nformed  towards the end of 1967 to advise and  assist\r\n\r\nin   formulating  development  programmes   for   the\r\n\r\nprinting industry in Singapore. Steps have also  been\r\n\r\ntaken to set up a school of printing in Singapore  to\r\n\r\nhelp provide a constant and regular supply of trained\r\n\r\nand skilled workers to the industry.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the printers themselves can also play an\r\n\r\nimportant role in solving some of the problems facing\r\n\r\ntheir   profession.  There  are  about  220  printing\r\n\r\npresses  in  Singapore. The vast  majority  of  these\r\n\r\nfirms are small, under-capitalised family businesses,\r\n\r\nresulting in too\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany machines chasing too few jobs and giving rise to\r\n\r\ncut-throat   competition  which  also   affects   the\r\n\r\nbusiness   of   bigger  printers.  If  the   printers\r\n\r\nthemselves will try a new approach by amalgamating on\r\n\r\na  mutually advantageous basis, perhaps they  may  be\r\n\r\nable  to  achieve a breakthrough to great  potentials\r\n\r\nand  will  be  in a better position to  compete  with\r\n\r\nforeign printers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PAYA LEBAR CONSTITUENCY</b></div>\r\n\r\n                          \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Building of clinic)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. <b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> asked the Minister for Health\r\n\r\nwhether  he  has any plans to build a clinic  in  the\r\n\r\ndensely   populated  part  of  the  Paya  Lebar   Constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the Paya Lebar Constituency  does  not\r\n\r\nhave  an outpatient dispensary within its boundaries.\r\n\r\nBut   there  are  dispensaries  just  outside   these\r\n\r\nboundaries,   namely,  the  Paya   Lebar   Outpatient\r\n\r\nDispensary at the junction of Paya Lebar Road and Yio\r\n\r\nChu Kang Road; Lim Ah Pin Outpatient Dispensary which\r\n\r\nis  further up on Upper Serangoon Road from the  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar  Clinic; MacPherson Road Outpatient  Dispensary\r\n\r\nat   Pesiaran  Keliling  in  the  MacPherson  Housing\r\n\r\nEstate, just off Paya Lebar Road.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no immediate plans to build a new\r\n\r\ndispensary   for   the   Paya   Lebar   Constituency.\r\n\r\nDevelopment plans for resiting Paya Lebar  Outpatient\r\n\r\nDispensary  will have to be made should  it  be  demolished   to  make  way  for  road  development.

But  yesterday,  the\r\n\r\npress  and  radio gave the impression that I  support\r\n\r\nthis  Bill. So I must make my correction  now  and  I\r\n\r\nhope  that you, Mr Speaker, will first allow  me  to\r\n\r\ncorrect this impression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few minutes before the adjournment\r\n\r\nyesterday,  I  was  talking  about  the   fact   that\r\n\r\nSingapore's population explosion problem was attended\r\n\r\nto  by  the former Minister for Health who tried  his\r\n\r\nbest to promote family planning and, as a result, the\r\n\r\nbirth rate has been decreasing year by year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the statistics of the Kandang Kerbau\r\n\r\nMaternity  Hospital,  we can  see  that  there  is  a\r\n\r\ndecrease  in  the birth rate. We can, therefore,  say\r\n\r\nfor  certain  that family planning has been  a  great\r\n\r\nsuccess, and we can boast about it to the world.  But\r\n\r\ntoday  the Minister for Health is bringing up a  Bill\r\n\r\nto  liberalise the law on abortion. This may prove  a\r\n\r\nbit  too much in the circumstances. There is no doubt\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister, before bringing  up  this  Bill,\r\n\r\ncarried out extensive investigations and incorporated\r\n\r\nmany  suggestions from various quarters in the  Bill.\r\n\r\nThe   Bill  provides  that  certain  conditions   and\r\n\r\nrequirements  must be fulfilled before  a  woman  can\r\n\r\napply  for  abortion.  This merely  demonstrates  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  spirit of the People's  Action  Party  in\r\n\r\nseeking  public opinion and cannot be taken  to  mean\r\n\r\nthat there is merit in the liberalisation of the  law\r\n\r\non abortion. That is the true picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the Minister, on the Second\r\n\r\nReading  of the Bill, gave various reasons to support\r\n\r\nit.  But  I  am not able to accept them. I feel  that\r\n\r\nmany  of  the  reasons  advanced  need  more  careful\r\n\r\nconsideration. What is more important is that we must\r\n\r\nbe   very   careful  and  always  watchful  for   the\r\n\r\nundesirable  consequences  and  reactions  that  will\r\n\r\nfollow if the Bill is passed. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Psychological reaction. Married couples who\r\n\r\nhave  been  generally successful in  family  planning\r\n\r\nwill  no  longer worry about the unfavourable  circum\r\n\r\nstances  of  having  a  baby in  view  of  the  ready\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  abortion. They will thus  resolutely\r\n\r\ngive  up  resorting  to the troublesome  practice  of\r\n\r\nusing  contraceptives, such as the taking  of  pills,\r\n\r\nusing  intra-uterine  devices,  condoms,  diaphragms,\r\n\r\njellies,  etc.,  in order to enjoy  the  pleasure  of\r\n\r\nsexual intercourse. At the back of their minds is the\r\n\r\nthought  that  if there is any conception,  safe  and\r\n\r\neasy  abortion facilities will be available to  solve\r\n\r\ntheir  problem. Women who have been quite  successful\r\n\r\nin  family  planning if their financial circumstances\r\n\r\nare bad and they cannot maintain their livelihood  if\r\n\r\nthey  are  to  have more children need  not  continue\r\n\r\ntheir  way of life as before, because they can resort\r\n\r\nto the practice of abortion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The degeneration of social morality. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in this metropolitan  city  of  ours,\r\n\r\nthere  are  undeniably  groups  of  wanton  pleasure-seeking   vagabonds,  male  and  female,  and   other\r\n\r\nnumerous innocent, passionate and energetic youths to\r\n\r\nwhom romance and petting are the social vogue. If the\r\n\r\nlaw  on  abortion is liberalised, the flood-gates  of\r\n\r\nsexual  promiscuity will be opened. Such people  will\r\n\r\nindulge  in licentious behaviour and incest.  When  a\r\n\r\nwoman  becomes pregnant, she will take  advantage  of\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of the Bill and tell the  authorities\r\n\r\nthat  her  pregnancy has come about because of  rape.\r\n\r\nWhen people ask, \"You are not married. How is it that\r\n\r\nyou  are  pregnant?\", she can reply that  it  is  the\r\n\r\nresult  of  rape. Instances of false  allegations  of\r\n\r\nrape, which might arise as a result of the Bill, will\r\n\r\ncause  the  degeneration of social morality  and  the\r\n\r\ndecadence  of  our social order. We  shudder  at  the\r\n\r\nthought of such undesirable consequences.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Minister mentioned the circumstances\r\n\r\nof   those  who  have  been  taking  family  planning\r\n\r\nguidance.  But  he forgot one point.  Those  who  are\r\n\r\nreceiving family planning guidance are married women.\r\n\r\nThose who are not married are quite a different  lot.\r\n\r\nFamily\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplanning  is meant only for married couples  and  not\r\n\r\nfor teenagers. If an 18-or 19-year old unmarried girl\r\n\r\nis   misled   by  this  Abortion  Bill  and   becomes\r\n\r\nlicentious  in her behaviour, I shudder to  think  of\r\n\r\nthe consequences in our society.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) On humanitarian grounds. Sir, I have no\r\n\r\nintention to argue with the Minister as to whether  a\r\n\r\nconceptus is a foetus or an embryo or a ball of flesh\r\n\r\nand blood or what-not. But verily I would stress that\r\n\r\nit is truly and unmistakably a body with life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also mentioned that shortly after its formation, the foetus is still not a human being. It is considered something like a fertilised egg. A man may perhaps be compared to a fertilised egg in another form. But do we so nonchalantly destroy an egg - even a chicken egg?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister gave a lot of reasons yesterday in support of the Bill, but many of them are not acceptable. From an analysis of the Chinese character for yin, namely, conceptus or pregnancy, it is composed of two parts. There are two characters, \"being\" and \"child\". That is to say, the conceptus is\r\n\r\na child.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old days (even at the present time) there\r\n\r\nwere cases where people were so poor and hard pressed\r\n\r\nthat   they  had  to  sell  their  children  to  keep\r\n\r\nthemselves alive. One would never imagine that today,\r\n\r\nin  an age of science and space technology, there can\r\n\r\nbe  people  who will legislate to enable  parents  to\r\n\r\nkill their children in order to live. What a pity and\r\n\r\na  calamity. Where is the sense of humanity? For  the\r\n\r\nthree  reasons I have advanced, I oppose the  passage\r\n\r\nof this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken (Alexandra):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  recent years, the question of  liberalising\r\n\r\nabortion  laws  i;  a  familiar  one  in  progressive\r\n\r\nsocieties.  Many  other  nations,  both  within   and\r\n\r\nwithout the non-Communist bloc, have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfaced  the question. In a very broad sense, the  pros\r\n\r\nand  cons for liberalisation of abortion have  become\r\n\r\nclassical  arguments,  having  been  developed   with\r\n\r\nincreasing sophistication with the passage  of  time.\r\n\r\nThe   significant   point  to  note   is   that   the\r\n\r\nprotagonists of liberal reforms have, as a whole, won\r\n\r\nthe day, as can be testified by the increasing number\r\n\r\nof nations that have legalized abortion, with varying\r\n\r\ndegrees of liberalism, and by not one nation that has\r\n\r\nliberalized abortion taking retrogressive steps  into\r\n\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a rough sense, the controversy on the\r\n\r\nliberalization  of  abortion laws parallels  that  on\r\n\r\nbirth control. Regarding the latter, at least it  can\r\n\r\nbe  said  that  those who stood in  the  way  of  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of voluntary parenthood are being consigned\r\n\r\nrelentlessly  into  the dustbin of history, although\r\n\r\nthe  lid  is  occasionally lifted. The rough  analogy\r\n\r\nwith   contraception   is  of  interest,   as   early\r\n\r\nopposition  to  this  was  fierce,  often  expressing\r\n\r\nitself in prediction of moral decay, the collapse  of\r\n\r\nstable  society, and even the killing of life itself.\r\n\r\nToday,  contraception is accented and respectable  in\r\n\r\nmany narts of the world, and it is a tribute to  the\r\n\r\nhealthy  pragmatism of the people of  Sinzapore  that\r\n\r\nthey have come to take contraception as a normal  way\r\n\r\nof life.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cannot foresee such a future for abortion, and,\r\n\r\nin  any  case,  it has been stressed  time  and  time\r\n\r\nagain,  and it has been ignored time and time  again,\r\n\r\nthat   the   purpose  of  the  Abortion  Bill   under\r\n\r\ndiscussion   is  not  to  substitute   abortion   for\r\n\r\ncontraceptive  planned  parenthood.  Availability  of\r\n\r\ncontraceptives renders reliance on the unpleasant and\r\n\r\nrelatively  expensive device of an  abortion  unneces\r\n\r\nsary,  and, therefore, unlikely. As the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  succinctly  pointed out in the  parliamentary\r\n\r\nsession  yesterday,  the reason for  introducing  the\r\n\r\nAbortion Bill is to deal with the problem of unwanted\r\n\r\npregnancy.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Punggol - I do not think he is\r\n\r\nhere  at  the moment. Oh yes, I am very  glad  he  is\r\n\r\nback. He had asked whether there is any need for such\r\n\r\na  Bill. There has been no public clamour for it,  he\r\n\r\nsaid, and I think,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  obvious passion and conviction. Yet,  it  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter of history that abortion has been practised as\r\n\r\nlong  as organised society has existed. It is also  a\r\n\r\nuniversal  occurrence.  An  authoritative  survey  of\r\n\r\ncross-cultural data revealed that -  and  here  I  am\r\n\r\nquoting - \"there is every indication that abortion is\r\n\r\nan  absolutely universal phenomenon, and that  it  is\r\n\r\nimpossible  even  to  construct an  imaginary  social\r\n\r\nsystem  in  which no woman would ever feel  at  least\r\n\r\nimpelled  to  abort.\" The quotation  is  from  George\r\n\r\nDevereaux's   A  Study  of  Abortion   in   Primitive\r\n\r\nSocieties,  New York: Julian Press, 1954,  page  161.\r\n\r\nThe  main  reason for liberalizing abortion  laws  in\r\n\r\nother  countries has been patent unenforceability  of\r\n\r\nthe  law  against  it. It may be  argued,  and  quite\r\n\r\nrelevantly,  that the experience of  other  countries\r\n\r\nneed  not be the reason for our having a more liberal\r\n\r\nAbortion  Bill. But the central question  is:  do  we\r\n\r\nhave an abortion problem? The answer is definitely in\r\n\r\nthe affirmative.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because induced abortion is illegal, a statutory\r\n\r\ncrime,  in  fact,  in Singapore, it is  difficult  to\r\n\r\ngather adequate information on the subject; and,  for\r\n\r\nthat  matter,  anywhere in the  world  where  induced\r\n\r\nabortion is a crime. There is only one study  on  the\r\n\r\nsubject, mentioned several times by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth.  This is Dr Lee Yong Kiat's The Non-Clinical\r\n\r\nAspects  of  Induced Abortion in  Singapore.  He  has\r\n\r\nestimated that Singapore has annually 5,000  criminal\r\n\r\nabortions, a figure that clearly suggests we  have  a\r\n\r\nproblem   of   dealing  with  women   with   unwanted\r\n\r\npregnancies. Dr Lee Yong Kiat concluded in  page  48\r\n\r\nthat  \"when  a woman is desperate enough to  want  an\r\n\r\ninduced  abortion,  she  will  ignore  whatever   her\r\n\r\nreligion  teaches.  Religion does  not  play  such  a\r\n\r\ndecisive  role  as economic and social  factors.\"  If\r\n\r\nthere  he  a  lack  of  clamour for  a  more  liberal\r\n\r\nabortion  law in Singapore, it is simply  because  of\r\n\r\nthe intimidating effects of the existing law. Dr Lee\r\n\r\nYong  Kiat's observations are worth quoting  for  the\r\n\r\nedification  of  those who equate the  absence  of  a\r\n\r\nclamour for reform with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  lack of demand for it. He writes in page  79  of\r\n\r\nhis work:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'When a patient dies as a result of a criminal\r\n\r\nabortion,   the  Coroner  is  informed   and   police\r\n\r\ninvestigations and a Coroner's inquiry take place. In\r\n\r\nthe majority of cases, the matter ends there with the\r\n\r\nCoroner  passing  a  few caustic remarks  about  abor\r\n\r\ntionists and the evils of criminal abortion,  because\r\n\r\nwomen  are  willing  to  go to their  graves  without\r\n\r\ndivulging  the  names  of  the  abortionists  .  .  .\r\n\r\nPatients co-operating with the doctors and police are\r\n\r\nthe  exception rather than the rule. The reasons  for\r\n\r\nthis are obvious:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The patients are grateful and loyal to this\r\n\r\nparticular person who has 'helped' them in their hour\r\n\r\nof need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, they may need the services of the\r\n\r\nabortionist again in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Fear of prosecution. Under the present law they\r\n\r\nare  liable to prosecution, at least in theory.  They\r\n\r\nare  told this by the abortionist, and are warned  to\r\n\r\nkeep silent for their own sakes.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, can we expect a public clamour for a reformed Abortion Bill when women, whose misplaced confidence in the abortionists has been rewarded with death, are willing to risk the possible consequences of eternal punishment in the next world rather than inform against them?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has also made certain\r\n\r\nobservations which require refutation.  He  cited  an\r\n\r\nauthority  on  the dangers of abortion. The  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Health, in a written answer to a question  about\r\n\r\nthe  fatality  rate of abortion cases,  had  made  it\r\n\r\npatently clear that abortions carried out for medical\r\n\r\nreasons  in  the  Kandang Kerbau Hospital  are  safe.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  the experience in Singapore is supported  by\r\n\r\nthat of other countries. I quote from Loren G. Stern:\r\n\r\n\"Abortion:  Reform  and  the  Law\"  [The  Journal  of\r\n\r\nCriminal  Law,  Criminology and Police Science,  Vol.\r\n\r\n59, No. 1, March, 1968, page 88].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Russian experience with legalized abortion\r\n\r\nbetween  1922 and 1936 yielded statistics  indicating\r\n\r\nthe  mortality rate among pregnant Russian women  was\r\n\r\nless  than  001 per cent. In Sweden, where there  are\r\n\r\nabout 5,000 legal abortions per year, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfatality rate among pregnant women is about 0.04  per\r\n\r\ncent.  This rate is lower than those mortality  rates\r\n\r\noperative  in  both  the United States  and  England.\r\n\r\nStudies  of Japan, which legalized abortion in  1948,\r\n\r\nand  those  Eastern European countries which  provide\r\n\r\nstatistics  indicate that physical after  effects  of\r\n\r\nabortion   are  rare  and  the  mortality   rate   is\r\n\r\n'exceedingly low'. Based on these scientific studies,\r\n\r\nit  is evident that abortion under optimum conditions\r\n\r\ninvolves  little risk to the life or  health  of  the\r\n\r\nwoman.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol also made the point that it\r\n\r\nis  unnecessary to employ abortion as another adjunct\r\n\r\nto  family  planning on account  of  the  success  of\r\n\r\ncontraception. It is conceivable that in a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere   the   use  of  contraception  is   completely\r\n\r\neffective,  resort  to abortion is  unnecessary.  The\r\n\r\nreality  is  that  we  are  nowhere  near  completely\r\n\r\neffective use of contraception in all sectors of  our\r\n\r\nsociety. It is among the poor sections that  we  have\r\n\r\nnot  eliminated all the situations in which  abortion\r\n\r\nwill  be  required. It is among them that the  demand\r\n\r\nfor  induced abortions seems to be greatest,  for  an\r\n\r\nadditional  child born into an already  large  family\r\n\r\nmeans   automatically  a  reduction  of  an   already\r\n\r\npitifully  inadequate income. It means more  hardship\r\n\r\nfor  all in the family. It is the poor who resort  to\r\n\r\nthe  unskilled  operators because they cannot  afford\r\n\r\nthe  price demanded by the qualified doctors who make\r\n\r\na  living out of human misery. It is they who  suffer\r\n\r\nthe injuries of badly induced abortions and end up in\r\n\r\nhospitals.  The  rich  have no  problems  of  finding\r\n\r\nsomeone   to  perform  the  operation  under  aseptic\r\n\r\nconditions, either within or without Singapore. As  a\r\n\r\nsocialist Government, we cannot permit a situation to\r\n\r\nexist  where  the  opportunities for  abortion  under\r\n\r\naseptic  conditions  and proper  surgical  skill  are\r\n\r\nunequal,  and definitely to the disadvantage  of  the\r\n\r\npoor.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has rightly pointed out that\r\n\r\nthe  Abortion  Bill  will not eliminate  the  illegal\r\n\r\nabortionist,  but not for the reason  given  by  him.\r\n\r\nThis  must be the price that society must pay  for  a\r\n\r\nBill that does not provide for abortion on demand. It\r\n\r\nwill be noted that there is a great deal of public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding that the Abortion Bill provides  for\r\n\r\nabortion on demand, which it assuredly does  not.  If\r\n\r\nit  were the intention to have abortion on demand, it\r\n\r\nwould  be  scarcely necessary for  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth   to  introduce  a  Bill  with  a  controlling\r\n\r\nadministrative mechanism. One cannot predict that the\r\n\r\npresent Bill will lead to a situation of abortion  on\r\n\r\ndemand in the future.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attitudes change, and if public opinion changes in\r\n\r\nfavour of abortion on demand in the years ahead, then\r\n\r\nit  is  the  responsibility of another Parliament  to\r\n\r\ndecide  what it should do to satisfy public  opinion.\r\n\r\nIn  any  case, it is also equally possible  that  the\r\n\r\nAbortion  Bill may itself be obsolete in the  future.\r\n\r\nLet  me  quote  pages 70 to 71 of a very  stimulating\r\n\r\nbook by Robert\r\n\r\nE.     Cooke,  The  Terrible  Choice:  The   Abortion\r\n\r\nDilemma:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There are now in various stages of development\r\n\r\nseveral possible methods of preventing or aborting  a\r\n\r\npregnancy after intercourse through the use of pills.\r\n\r\nIt  is  believed already possible to do this  through\r\n\r\ntaking  a series of high-dosage hormone pills  for  a\r\n\r\nfew  days, within a few days after intercourse. There\r\n\r\nmay  well  be developed what is referred  to  as  the\r\n\r\n\"morning-after\" pill, a pill which if taken within  a\r\n\r\nfew  hours  after intercourse prevents the fertilized\r\n\r\novum  from  being implanted in the uterus. There  may\r\n\r\nalso  be  developed a pill which,  if  taken  on  the\r\n\r\ntwenty-eight day of each menstrual cycle, can  end  a\r\n\r\npregnancy begun during a cycle.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These pills are considered likely to be of general\r\n\r\nuse  in  future,  and  when this  occurs,  the  law's\r\n\r\nability  to control will diminish as abortion returns\r\n\r\nto the realm of private decision.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has also condemned the socio-economic arguments for abortion. I fully appreciate\r\n\r\nand  respect his concern for the foetus, but I cannot\r\n\r\nbut  note  a  singular lack of compassion  for  human\r\n\r\nsuffering,  and the social consequences  of  bringing\r\n\r\nforth   unwanted  children,  mentally  retarded   and\r\n\r\nphysically defective children. Unfortunately, we have\r\n\r\nno  major  studies  of  the  family  and  social  con\r\n\r\nsequences of unwanted children in Singapore.  We  can\r\n\r\nonly  rely on the experience of other societies where\r\n\r\nsuch studies have been made to provide a clue to what\r\n\r\nare the likely consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy  view  is that the consequences are likely  to  be\r\n\r\nsimilar.  In  a  public lecture at the University  of\r\n\r\nCalifornia,  at  Berkeley, Professor  Garrett  Hardin\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Is it good that a woman who does not want a child\r\n\r\nshould bear one? An abundant literature in psychology\r\n\r\nand  sociology proves that the unwanted  child  is  a\r\n\r\nsocial danger. Unwanted children are more likely than\r\n\r\nothers to grow up in psychologically unhealthy homes;\r\n\r\nthey   are   more  likely  than  others   to   become\r\n\r\ndelinquents, and as John Bowlby has pointed out, when\r\n\r\nthey become parents, they are more likely than others\r\n\r\nto  be  poor  parents themselves, and  breed  another\r\n\r\ngeneration  of unwanted children. This is  a  vicious\r\n\r\ncircle  if  ever  there  was one.  This  is  what  an\r\n\r\nengineer would call positive feedback: it is  ruinous\r\n\r\nto the social system.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carrying the argument of general social welfare\r\n\r\nfurther, Professor Hardin also said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The consequences of an abortion are mostly strictly\r\n\r\nlimited  in  time:  the consequences  of  ill-advised\r\n\r\nparenthood  are paid for by society for  decades  and\r\n\r\neven generations.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Punggol has called\r\n\r\nfor a new slogan: \"Every  child a protected child\". I share his concern\r\n\r\nfor  the  need to protect children, but I  say,  Sir,\r\n\r\nevery  child will be a protected child if every child\r\n\r\nis a wanted child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Hear,\r\n\r\nhear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> This is the compelling reality\r\n\r\nof life, here and everywhere.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol, Sir, also would have a\r\n\r\ndefective child born into this world.

Mr Speaker, Sir, would also\r\n\r\nwant  to compel a woman who is pregnant as the result\r\n\r\nof  rape and incest to go through with her pregnancy.\r\n\r\nYet  it  is  a hard reality of social life that  both\r\n\r\nrape  and incest are repugnant to our society as they\r\n\r\nshould  be.  For such situations, society imposes  an\r\n\r\neverlasting  stigma on the woman and the  child,  the\r\n\r\nproduct  of an unnatural relationship. I believe  the\r\n\r\nchild of an incestuous relationship in Singapore  can\r\n\r\nnever be legitimized, and experience and common sense\r\n\r\npoint to the unlikely legitimation of the child  born\r\n\r\nof  rape. I ask of Members of this House, in whom the\r\n\r\npublic  expect compassion and justice besides  common\r\n\r\nsense,  I  ask of them, is it reasonable to for-ce  a\r\n\r\nwoman to bear a child whose creation is the result of\r\n\r\na  relationship with a man she probably does not know\r\n\r\nnor  will ever want to know? Then, Sir, there are the\r\n\r\ncases of girls impregnated as the result of statutory\r\n\r\nrape.  Are  we to punish them for the rest  of  their\r\n\r\nlives,  when it is the presumption of law  that  they\r\n\r\nare  too  immature to know the nature of their  acts,\r\n\r\nand  then, after they become pregnant, force them  to\r\n\r\nface    the   consequences   of   motherhood?   Basic\r\n\r\nhumanitarian  instincts alone compel the legalization\r\n\r\nof  abortion  for  rape and incest cases.  We  cannot\r\n\r\npunish  the  child nor the mother for the actions  of\r\n\r\nothers  at  whose  hands she has already  suffered  a\r\n\r\nmajor traumatic experience.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol, Mr Speaker, Sir, is deeply\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  the legal rights of the  foetus.  On\r\n\r\nthis  subject,  there is a wide range of  views  even\r\n\r\namong  religious groups. Suffice it for me  to  quote\r\n\r\nthe Bishop of Exeter in the House of Lords debates in\r\n\r\nBritain. He had declared his support\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  abortion  where  the  interests  of  the  mother\r\n\r\nvitally  required  it.  He pointed  out  that  it  is\r\n\r\npossible to say that the foetus, the unborn baby,  is\r\n\r\nnot  a member of the human race in the ordinary sense\r\n\r\nof those words, but it has a potentiality of becoming\r\n\r\nso.  He  concluded, and here I quote  his  lordship's\r\n\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But since the foetus has only this potentiality of\r\n\r\nhumanity which is not yet fully real, because  it  is\r\n\r\nin  the  process of turning that which  is  potential\r\n\r\ninto that which is real, the rights of the mother who\r\n\r\nhas  already passed from the potential to  the  real,\r\n\r\nand  who is on any showing a full member of the human\r\n\r\nrace,  take precedence over those of her unborn baby.\r\n\r\nSo  where  there  is  a direct and unavoidable  clash\r\n\r\nbetween the interests of the mother and of her unborn\r\n\r\nbaby, the mother takes precedence over the baby.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if there is anything that is clear about the issue of abortion, it is that it is a complex and, often, an emotionally charged issue. This is because it is the potential of the human foetus which concerns us. Unless interfered with, this foetus will have the potential to develop into\r\n\r\nanother human being like ourselves. It is this  poten\r\n\r\ntiality that has moved society to set abortion  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  other surgical procedures. Because of  \"respect\r\n\r\nfor  life\",  in  religious and  non-religious  terms,\r\n\r\nsince it is the only life we have or know of, we  are\r\n\r\nlikely  to  have widely different views on  abortion.\r\n\r\nWhen  does life begin after sexual intercourse?  This\r\n\r\nquestion  has  been argued from time immemorial,  and\r\n\r\nfrom  civilization to civilization, and there  is  no\r\n\r\nuniversally acceptable answer, and the likelihood  is\r\n\r\nthat  there will be none. Religious views  about  the\r\n\r\nfoetus  based on doctrine cannot be proved or refuted\r\n\r\nas  they  are based on beliefs incapable of empirical\r\n\r\ndemonstration.   Despite   its   recent   spectacular\r\n\r\nadvances,  science  can give us no  answer.  At  each\r\n\r\nstage  of  development, the foetus has the  potential\r\n\r\nfor  further development, and even the most  accurate\r\n\r\nknowledge of the foetus cannot answer what value each\r\n\r\nstage  of development has for society, for the mother\r\n\r\nor   father,   or  in  religious  terms,   for   God.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as legislators, we must make a decision\r\n\r\nbecause\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  abdicate  our responsibility  to  find  a\r\n\r\nsolution   to  the  problem  of  unwanted  pregnancy.\r\n\r\nWhatever  our religious bias and faith, whatever  our\r\n\r\nethical and humanistic values, it is proper for us to\r\n\r\nrecognise that we are the elected representatives  of\r\n\r\nmen on earth, and not the earthly representatives  of\r\n\r\nour  faith  in  Parliament. Even among the  Christian\r\n\r\nchurches,  there  is no unanimity  of  views  on  the\r\n\r\nliberalisation  of  abortion laws even  in  Christian\r\n\r\ncountries. I believe, Sir, it is correct to say  that\r\n\r\nin  the  United States, even members of the  Catholic\r\n\r\nChurch  hierarchy  - and here I am quoting  Loren  G.\r\n\r\nStern again, at pages 90 to 91 of the same article  -\r\n\r\n\"do  not  believe  that it is the Church's  place  to\r\n\r\nimpose  its  moral  beliefs  upon  the  rest  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation through criminal statutes.\" He went on  to\r\n\r\ncite  a letter by Cardinal Cushing, and I would  like\r\n\r\nto quote a portion of the letter:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There is nothing in Catholic teaching which\r\n\r\nsuggests  that Catholics should write into civil  law\r\n\r\nthe  prescriptions of Church Law, or in any other way\r\n\r\nforce  the observance of Catholic doctrine on others.\r\n\r\nCatholics  have no right to do this . . .  while  we\r\n\r\nshould make every effort to see the law upholds human\r\n\r\nrights and values and reflects the moral consensus of\r\n\r\nthe  community  we should not look  upon  it-  as  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  promoting  specifically   religious\r\n\r\nteachings,  especially when this may be offensive  to\r\n\r\nsome citizens.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Abortion Bill under discussion should cause no\r\n\r\nconflict  of  conscience, as it  does  not  coerce  a\r\n\r\npregnant mother to have an abortion or a doctor  with\r\n\r\nstrong  views on the subject to perform it. Catholics\r\n\r\nand others who do not want to avail themselves of the\r\n\r\nliberalised  abortion  law  are  certainly  under  no\r\n\r\nobligation  to  do  so.  There remains  the  delicate\r\n\r\nquestion  of an emergency when a Catholic doctor  has\r\n\r\nto weigh the fear of excommunication with his duty as\r\n\r\na  doctor  to his patient. It seems clear to  me  his\r\n\r\nduty  is to his patient, and the true answer  to  his\r\n\r\ndilemma will not be found on this earth.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Abortion Bill is not a mandatory\r\n\r\npiece  of  legislation.  It  imposes   no obligation in conflict \r\n\r\nwith  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  religious  views  of  those  it  covers.  It  is\r\n\r\nessentially  a  permissive law, and  can  accommodate\r\n\r\nboth  those with diverse religious beliefs, the  non-believers,  and  the  humanists.  The  Abortion  Bill\r\n\r\nsubjects  none  to the will of others.  This  is  the\r\n\r\nnature  of  religious freedom and tolerance  we  must\r\n\r\nstrive  for  in  our multi-racial and multi-religious\r\n\r\nsociety.  If we cannot support the Bill on  religious\r\n\r\nand  other grounds of faith, we should not  deny  the\r\n\r\nright  to such a Bill to those who have the need  for\r\n\r\nit.  We  are,  Mr  Speaker.  Sir,  not  showing  any\r\n\r\ndisrespect for life. It is because we have a  respect\r\n\r\nfor  life, and the quality of life on this earth that\r\n\r\nI  believe is the moral justification for this  Bill.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot eliminate human misery on earth. At least,\r\n\r\nwe  can try to reduce it, especially for those  whose\r\n\r\nlikely  prospect in life can be summed up as follows:\r\n\r\n\"born  in  poverty, reared in poverty, and doomed  to\r\n\r\npoverty\".  Human misery may have a value for  certain\r\n\r\nreligions. I think it has none for us, whose  primary\r\n\r\nresponsibility is to improve the prospect and quality\r\n\r\nof human life on earth.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of medical concern has changed from\r\n\r\ncentury  to  century.  Today, it  embraces  not  only\r\n\r\ndisease and death but health as well. The modern  con\r\n\r\ncept of health is that of a positive state of general\r\n\r\nwell-being,  and not just an absence of disease.  The\r\n\r\nWorld Health Organization has described health as  \"a\r\n\r\nstate of complete physical, mental, arid social well-being,  and  not  merely the absence  of  disease  or\r\n\r\ninfirmity\". And on the way in which we vote  on  this\r\n\r\nBill  will  the  world judge us on our humanity,  our\r\n\r\nbreadth  of  vision  and intellectual  horizons,  our\r\n\r\ncapacity for compassion and for tolerance.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said, Mr Speaker, Sir, that a\r\n\r\npermissive  Abortion  Bill will  promote  immorality.\r\n\r\nYet, the experience of other nations and the study of\r\n\r\nDr Lee Yong Kiat all have shown that the majority of\r\n\r\nwomen  who go for induced abortions are married women\r\n\r\nwhose primary concern is the quality of life,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  respect  of  it,  among  the  members  of  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.  It rests upon the woman to make the  final\r\n\r\ndecision  to  abort,  and one must  presume  she  has\r\n\r\nweighed her decisions against her relations with  her\r\n\r\nhusband, her family, and her religious faith. This is\r\n\r\nher  fundamental right which I hope  the  House  will\r\n\r\naccept,  and  which  only  she  alone  can  exercise,\r\n\r\nhopefully, to her own happiness.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...leave her to heaven,\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prick and sting her.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Shakespeare: Hamlet, Act I, Scene V).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>Finally,  no\r\n\r\nhuman  wisdom  can define an Abortion  Bill  that  is\r\n\r\nperfect. It is commendable that provision is made for\r\n\r\nthe  review  of  the Bill before the House  within  a\r\n\r\ncomparatively short time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  my view, the Abortion Bill has been introduced on\r\n\r\ntwo main grounds. Firstly, to control effectively the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of our population and, secondly, to stop  the\r\n\r\nincrease or existence of illegal abortions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of population control, it i5 my view\r\n\r\nthat  in  so far as a small nation like Singapore  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, such a Bill is very important because  we\r\n\r\nlack  natural  resources and we have a population  of\r\n\r\ntwo million. Both in terms of our economy and the  un\r\n\r\nemployment  problem,  we are shouldering  very  heavy\r\n\r\nresponsibilities. At the present moment, about 60,000\r\n\r\nof  our  citizens  are in a state of unemployment  or\r\n\r\nunder-employment. Furthermore, we have to look  after\r\n\r\nour  citizens in the fields of health, education  and\r\n\r\nsocial  welfare.  Therefore,  we  must  stress   that\r\n\r\neffective  control  of  population  growth  is   very\r\n\r\nimportant in Singapore. We must make sure that  every\r\n\r\nchild  in  Singapore is a healthy child and a  wanted\r\n\r\nchild.  We must also ensure that every child  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety will have a place in the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have achieved a certain measure of success in\r\n\r\nfamily  planning and, in this respect, the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  should be congratulated on its foresight.\r\n\r\nAs  a  matter of fact, when family planning was first\r\n\r\nintroduced in Singapore, views were expressed against\r\n\r\nit.  Sir,  had  it not been for the adamant  attitude\r\n\r\nadopted by our Government, our population growth rate\r\n\r\nwould  have been about 40 per 1,000 and, as a result,\r\n\r\nour  population by now would have been at  least  2.5\r\n\r\nmillion  instead  of two million.  So,  on  the  same\r\n\r\nbasis,  the Singapore Government is trying to  effect\r\n\r\nbetter  control  over the growth  of  population  and\r\n\r\nthis,  in  my  view, is in keeping with our  national\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our Government is now encouraging the people to have small families with, at the most, three children in a family. This is not only beneficial to the individual family but also conducive to a better state of social well-being. According to statistics, many illegal abortions are\r\n\r\ndone  in  Singapore, amounting to at least 500  cases\r\n\r\nper annum, and the women involved will eventually  go\r\n\r\nto  the  Kandang Kerbau Hospital for assistance  when\r\n\r\ntheir  lives  are  in  danger.  We  must  take  every\r\n\r\npossible  step  to  prevent  the  recurrence  or  the\r\n\r\nworsening of this situation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, some people will say that this Bill will lower the standard of morality. I thin-k the people who hold this view are too passionate and incapable of making a cool and calculating analysis of the situation. If they open their eyes and look around the world, they will change their attitude. We\r\n\r\ncan  see  that thousands and thousands of people  are\r\n\r\ndying  because  of war, starvation and  malnutrition,\r\n\r\nand many thousands are on the brink of starvation. In\r\n\r\nmy  view, it is a sin for human society to allow such\r\n\r\nmisery  to  continue to exist.  It  is,  in  fact,  a\r\n\r\ntragedy  for human society to be in such a state.  We\r\n\r\nmust  not allow these things to happen. We must  take\r\n\r\npositive  steps to prevent an occurrence  of  such  a\r\n\r\nstate  of  affairs. We must effectively  control  our\r\n\r\npopulation growth. We must stress that in this  Bill,\r\n\r\nabortion is performed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  a  voluntary basis. It is not compulsory at  all,\r\n\r\nand  people  can, on religious grounds  or  for  some\r\n\r\nother reason, very well refuse to accept abortion  if\r\n\r\nthey  so  choose.  In  addition,  there  are  certain\r\n\r\nconditions - I can see at least four of them - to  be\r\n\r\nsatisfied  before  an  abortion  can  be  authorised.\r\n\r\nFirstly, that continued pregnancy will endanger life;\r\n\r\nsecondly,  financial hardship does  not  justify  the\r\n\r\ncontinuance of pregnancy; thirdly, the doctor must be\r\n\r\nsatisfied that there is a risk that the child  to  be\r\n\r\nborn  will  be abnormal; and, fourthly, the pregnancy\r\n\r\nis  the result of rape, incest or intercourse with an\r\n\r\ninsane or feeble-minded person. Because of these four\r\n\r\nsafeguards,  the  present  social  order  and   moral\r\n\r\nstandards can and will still be maintained.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another feature of this Bill is that there is a\r\n\r\nprovision for its review within five years,  so  that\r\n\r\nwhatever defects there might be will be corrected  in\r\n\r\ndue  course. In short, this Bill is based on national\r\n\r\ninterest  and  has  been carefully drafted.  It  will\r\n\r\nbring about social progress and promote human welfare\r\n\r\nas  well  as  economic development. In the  long-term\r\n\r\ninterest,  the  Bill is a good one. It  will  advance\r\n\r\nhuman welfare. For all these reasons, I fully support\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.17 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, ever since the Abortion Bill  had  its\r\n\r\nFirst  Reading in Parliament, it has stimulated  keen\r\n\r\ndiscussion  in  our society. Members of  the  public,\r\n\r\nwhether   from  medical,  religious  or   educational\r\n\r\ncircles, have come out with various views on it, both\r\n\r\ndivergent and controversial. This can be said  to  be\r\n\r\nthe first time that any Bill introduced in Parliament\r\n\r\nby  the  present Government has been keenly discussed\r\n\r\noutside Parliament. This spirit of taking part in the\r\n\r\nstudy  of  a  Bill  introduced by  Parliament  really\r\n\r\nmerits  our  encouragement. This is  just  where  the\r\n\r\nprecious spirit of our democratic system lies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, when we debate this Bill in Parliament, we\r\n\r\nhave naturally taken\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nnote of such public views. Whether or not the law  on\r\n\r\nabortion should be liberalised is certainly a  highly\r\n\r\ncontroversial  question. This must necessarily  arise\r\n\r\nin  a great metropolis. Singapore has reached a stage\r\n\r\nin its development where its population growth cannot\r\n\r\nbe allowed to increase without a check.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Minister spent much time and trouble\r\n\r\nin this House quoting extensive references in support\r\n\r\nof  his arguments for this Bill. We, of course,  have\r\n\r\ntaken note of the good intentions of the Minister  in\r\n\r\nintroducing  it. In view of the fact  that  our  land\r\n\r\narea  is  limited  and our population  is  increasing\r\n\r\ncontinuously, we must, therefore, ensure that  babies\r\n\r\nborn  will  become useful elements in our society  in\r\n\r\nthe  future  and  not become scums and  a  burden  to\r\n\r\nsociety. Moreover, in view of the prevailing practice\r\n\r\nof  illegal  abortions  which have  caused  traumatic\r\n\r\ndamage  and harm to ignorant women, we must legislate\r\n\r\nto  correct the situation. But the Minister seems  to\r\n\r\nsee  only  one side of the question and has neglected\r\n\r\nto see the other side. It is fortunate that there are\r\n\r\nalready  some  countries  in  the  world  which  have\r\n\r\nintroduced  a  law  to  liberalise  abortions.  Their\r\n\r\nactual implementation and result can serve as lessons\r\n\r\nfor our reference.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question that merits the reconsideration\r\n\r\nof  the Minister is whether the liberalisation of the\r\n\r\nlaw on abortion will actually solve our problems. The\r\n\r\nsecond  question  is, when the  law  on  abortion  is\r\n\r\nliberalised, what effect will it have on our society?\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  in  recent  years,  as  a  result  of  the\r\n\r\nsuccessful  implementation of  family  planning,  the\r\n\r\nrate  of  our  population growth has been effectively\r\n\r\nchecked. According to statistics based on the present\r\n\r\ntrend  of a decreasing rate of population growth,  by\r\n\r\n1971 the rate of births will be only 17 per 1,000. We\r\n\r\nshould    actually   strengthen   our   efforts    in\r\n\r\nimplementing  family  planning  and  not  allow   the\r\n\r\nliberalisation of the law on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabortion  to defeat or weaken the practice of  family\r\n\r\nplanning.  The  reason  is  very  simple.  Once   the\r\n\r\nliberalisation law on abortion is passed, women  will\r\n\r\ngenerally be less keen on family planning. They  will\r\n\r\nhave the idea that if they do not want the baby,  the\r\n\r\nfoetus can easily be aborted. If their application is\r\n\r\nnot   approved   by  the  Termination  of   Pregnancy\r\n\r\nAuthorisation  Board, they can still go  for  illegal\r\n\r\nabortions.  As  the Minister has admitted,  legalised\r\n\r\nabortions may not displace illegal abortions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In countries where the law on abortion has been\r\n\r\nliberalised,  such  as  Sweden,  America  and  Japan,\r\n\r\nabortion  is regarded as an ordinary domestic  chore,\r\n\r\nas the Member for Punggol pointed out yesterday. Many\r\n\r\nwomen have had three or four experiences in abortion.\r\n\r\nThey  substitute abortion for family  planning.  They\r\n\r\ntake  abortion as a means of population control. What\r\n\r\nis  more,  in  these  countries  there  are  tens  of\r\n\r\nthousands  of  bastards  born  every  year  of  unwed\r\n\r\nmothers.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we deem, like many other scholars, that the moment the foetus is formed inside the mother's womb it is a human life, then abortion will virtually amount to the taking of life. I think the Minister for Health has no intention of making himself the number one executioner by legislation\r\n\r\nkilling  a life which is absolutely unable to  defend\r\n\r\nitself  inside  the mother's body. Moreover,  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations  Code  of Children's  Rights,  it  is\r\n\r\nstated  that  a child should be given adequate  legal\r\n\r\nprotection   before  and  after   its   birth.   This\r\n\r\nillustrates the fact that before a child is  born  it\r\n\r\nshould  also  have its human rights.  Human  life  is\r\n\r\nsacrosanct  and inviolable. The process of  evolution\r\n\r\nfrom  the  primeval  age  to  the  present  state  of\r\n\r\ncivilisation has been long and arduous.  The  concept\r\n\r\nof  the  absolute sacredness of human life  has  also\r\n\r\nbeen  established through a similar arduous  process.\r\n\r\nThese are the fruits of civilisation and should on no\r\n\r\naccount be easily allowed to be damaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the law on abortion is liberalised, it will\r\n\r\nmean  that life can easily be killed. Human life will\r\n\r\nthen  become as valueless as a piece of waste  paper.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  even  worse  is  that  it  may  shake   the\r\n\r\nfoundation  upon  which mankind  has  maintained  its\r\n\r\nsocial order.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the law on abortion is liberalised, one of the\r\n\r\nobvious  consequences  will be  the  degeneration  of\r\n\r\nsocial behaviour. This can be evinced from the social\r\n\r\nbehaviour  of those countries which have  liberalised\r\n\r\nthe  law on abortion. Legalised abortion will  easily\r\n\r\nbe  misunderstood  by people. They  will  think  that\r\n\r\npregnancy  does  not matter. After  all,  it  can  be\r\n\r\naborted  at  will. Thus it will lead to a licentious,\r\n\r\nlaissez-aller relationship between the male  and  the\r\n\r\nfemale.  Libertines and promiscuous women  will  give\r\n\r\nfull  vent  to their feelings. In such circumstances,\r\n\r\nwill  the Minister for Health be able to ensure  that\r\n\r\nimpressionable  youths will not be uninhibitedly  and\r\n\r\nwantonly  more  unscrupulous in their  behaviour  and\r\n\r\nthat  the  standard  of  social  morality  will   not\r\n\r\ndeteriorate?  On the one hand, we are  determined  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a  rugged society, but, on the other hand,  we\r\n\r\nare  indirectly encouraging a libertine  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween the male and the female and thus allow social\r\n\r\nmorality  to degenerate. Is it not contradictory  and\r\n\r\nironical?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am a free thinker.

I\r\n\r\nunderstand that the family planning scheme at present\r\n\r\nbeing carried out is already opening the way for  our\r\n\r\nunmarried  girls  and  widows to  commit  fornication\r\n\r\nsince  they believe they can avoid becoming  pregnant\r\n\r\nby  means  of family planning contraceptive aids  now\r\n\r\nreadily available. If this Bill is passed and if they\r\n\r\nbecome  pregnant through the failure of contraceptive\r\n\r\naids,  then  they  can  resort  to  abortion  without\r\n\r\ndifficulty.  Do  we really wish to involve  ourselves\r\n\r\nand  be  a party to such a state of affairs?  In  all\r\n\r\nearnestness, we ought to be on guard against anything\r\n\r\nthat may impair the good name of the Republic. But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstead here we are trying to push through this  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich,  if passed, will only encourage all manner  of\r\n\r\ndespicable practices.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The religion of Islam prohibits abortion as an act\r\n\r\nthat is contrary to the will of God. It is a cardinal\r\n\r\nand  unforgivable sin because it is regarded as being\r\n\r\ntantamount to killing, even if the foetus has not yet\r\n\r\nassumed  human  form. Abortion is a  despicable  act.\r\n\r\nBesides,  it  serves  to  encourage  fornication  and\r\n\r\nadultery  and  leads  to moral  degradation,  thereby\r\n\r\ntarnishing  the  good  name  of  our  Republic.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I oppose this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.09 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Health  Minister,  in his long  and  devastating\r\n\r\nspeech  yesterday, said that it was  the  fundamental\r\n\r\nright  of  a woman to have an abortion if the  family\r\n\r\ncircumstances  are not right for  the  birth  of  the\r\n\r\nchild.  According to him, the issue  is  simple  - the\r\n\r\nright  of an individual to have a choice to abort  an\r\n\r\nunwanted  pregnancy under specified conditions,  just\r\n\r\nas  it  is the right of every human being to enjoy  a\r\n\r\nmeaningful  life, a right to liberty and a  right  to\r\n\r\nprivacy.   To  me,  all  these  sounded  like   pious\r\n\r\nprotestations of the other extreme view.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask, if we are to legislate a law in order to\r\n\r\ngive  an individual the right to abortion, the  right\r\n\r\nto  liberty, and the right to privacy, are we also to\r\n\r\nlegislate a law in future to ensure the right  of  an\r\n\r\nindividual or a group of\r\n\r\nindividuals  to  watch  a  blue  film  in  their  own\r\n\r\nresidence without being harassed by the police, since\r\n\r\nvalues  have become not abiding but conditional?  Are\r\n\r\nwe  also to legislate a law to ensure the right of an\r\n\r\nindividual  to  take away his own life by  committing\r\n\r\nsuicide  if  that individual feels that life  has  no\r\n\r\nlonger any meaning and any future for him? This could\r\n\r\nperhaps  be extended further by a pronouncement  that\r\n\r\nall  persons who are liabilities to the state  should\r\n\r\ndo society a favour by eliminating themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Health Minister presented to the House six case\r\n\r\nstudies of illegal abortions and he did not spare  us\r\n\r\nthe sordid details of the traumatic experience of the\r\n\r\npatients concerned. He went further and mentioned the\r\n\r\ncase  of a Roman Catholic housewife. I would like  to\r\n\r\ntell  the  Minister that, in the case  of  the  Roman\r\n\r\nCatholic  housewife,  if she had  only  followed  the\r\n\r\nteachings of her religion, she would not have in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  place  resorted to the illegal  abortion,  and\r\n\r\nthus  she  would  have spared herself  the  traumatic\r\n\r\nexperience. However, the point that I would  like  to\r\n\r\nbring  out  is this. Is it a right line  of  argument\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  take, when  we  say  that  we  must\r\n\r\nlegislate  the liberalisation of the law on  abortion\r\n\r\nin  order  to  enable our women folk  the  individual\r\n\r\nright  to  have  an unwanted pregnancy aborted?  This\r\n\r\nline   of   argument,  if  applied  in  a   different\r\n\r\nsituation, can also present the case for the state to\r\n\r\nlegislate a law for legalised suicide and to  provide\r\n\r\nfacilities for individuals wishing to commit  suicide\r\n\r\nto have the facilities of a gas chamber - seeing that\r\n\r\nthis  is a much easier way of taking one's life  than\r\n\r\nto   resort  to  various  hideous  forms  of  killing\r\n\r\noneself.  We could as well present to this House  the\r\n\r\ntraumatic experience of many individuals who had made\r\n\r\nunsuccessful attempts at suicide. But to  suggest  at\r\n\r\nthis juncture that the state legislates such a law to\r\n\r\nthis  effect will bring upon myself strong criticisms\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Health Minister and I might be accused  of\r\n\r\nbeing mischievous. But there is a parallel.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would think that the right way to help someone\r\n\r\nwho  wants  to take away his own life is to  persuade\r\n\r\nthe person to abandon the idea and help him to see  a\r\n\r\nfuture,  a  hope  and a more courageous  way  out  of\r\n\r\nwhatever  difficulties that he faces.  Similarly,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be equally logical to say that for an unwanted\r\n\r\npregnancy, we must try to find ways and means to make\r\n\r\nmothers  learn  to  want  the  unwelcomed  pregnancy.\r\n\r\nSurely it is not right for the state to help them get\r\n\r\nrid  of an unwanted pregnancy just as it is not right\r\n\r\nfor the state to help\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  individual get rid of his own life,  although  it\r\n\r\nmay  be  argued  that every individual  has  his  own\r\n\r\nright, even the right to take away his own life.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, it is dangerous to invoke such noble\r\n\r\nterms as the right of individuals, the right to  this\r\n\r\nand  the  right  to  that. I  think  the  fundamental\r\n\r\nprinciple  behind  a good law is that  the  law  must\r\n\r\ngenerally concern itself with the general welfare  of\r\n\r\nthe  public, even if such a law may encroach upon the\r\n\r\nrights of a minority group.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The welfare of a community must involve public order\r\n\r\nand  civil peace; the security of the young, the weak\r\n\r\nand the handicapped; the maintenance of the decencies\r\n\r\nof  public  behaviour,  the protection  of  life  and\r\n\r\nproperty.  To  me the liberalisation of  the  law  on\r\n\r\nabortion will work against the general welfare of the\r\n\r\ncommunity,  particularly when it will  infringe  upon\r\n\r\ncertain  moral  values of the Singapore  society.  In\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  respect and value certain  human  and\r\n\r\nmoral  values. The present Government has  not  shown\r\n\r\nitself  up to now in favour of a permissive  society.\r\n\r\nIts  marriage legislation and its concern over  porno\r\n\r\ngraphic   films,   in   its   emphasis   on    social\r\n\r\nresponsibility, it has striven to improve the  social\r\n\r\nand the moral standards of the people. I am sure this\r\n\r\ncan  be  undone to a certain extent by  the  move  to\r\n\r\nliberalise the law on abortion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Health Minister, in moving the Bill to be read a\r\n\r\nSecond  time,  has  proceeded to demolish  objections\r\n\r\nthat   might  be  anticipated  from  this  House   on\r\n\r\nreligious  grounds as well as ethical, moral,  social\r\n\r\nand   medical   grounds.  In  the  course   of   such\r\n\r\nrefutation,  he expressed his view that  abortion  is\r\n\r\nnot murder. Elsewhere in his speech, the Minister has\r\n\r\nlevelled  religious objections to legalised  abortion\r\n\r\nas being based on concepts which have sprung from the\r\n\r\nmiddle ages and beyond.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implied tenor of the Minister's arguments is\r\n\r\nthat  the  proponents of the Bill are  favoured  with\r\n\r\ncrystal-clear  and  rational  understanding  of   the\r\n\r\nconcept of life and the concept of laws pertaining to\r\n\r\nthe preservation of life. It is only unfortunate that\r\n\r\nin the course of his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlengthy  speech the Minister has lost the  thread  of\r\n\r\nhis own arguments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the very basis of the laws of the Republic\r\n\r\ngoverning  abortion is as outdated and as  irrational\r\n\r\nas  the  Minister  sincerely  believes,  a  pertinent\r\n\r\nquestion  may be asked why the Minister is sponsoring\r\n\r\na  Bill  which,  in effect, seeks tn  perpetuate  the\r\n\r\nconcept that abortion is intrinsically wrong and that\r\n\r\nthe  procreative organs of a human  being  are  of  a\r\n\r\nspecial  category meriting distinctive  treatment  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to the other organs and parts of the  human\r\n\r\nbody.  Such an inference is to be clearly drawn  from\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that the Bill is designated to reform  and\r\n\r\nliberalise  the  law of abortion in  Singapore  -  in\r\n\r\nother   words,   to   make   less   restrictive   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  in which an abortion  may  be  legally\r\n\r\nperformed. In contrast, the Minister has not found it\r\n\r\nnecessary to enact similar legislation to govern  the\r\n\r\nremoval  of  an  excrescence on the brain,  liver  or\r\n\r\nkidney  or  even  a portion of the  organ  itself  by\r\n\r\ncompetent medical personnel. The very fact  that  the\r\n\r\nremoval  of  a foetus, which the Minister regards  as\r\n\r\nnothing more than a piece of living organism, must be\r\n\r\nmade  the  subject of a special piece of  legislation\r\n\r\nwith  innumerable safeguards, is a strong  indication\r\n\r\nthat  the  proponents of the Bill are  not  clear  in\r\n\r\ntheir conscience that an operation for the removal of\r\n\r\nfoetus  can  be  considered  to  be  like  any  other\r\n\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sordid details and nebulous arguments have been used\r\n\r\nto  cover up the mental confusion and uneasiness that\r\n\r\nare  inherent  in the concept of life underlying  the\r\n\r\nsponsorship  of  the  Bill.  An  instance   of   such\r\n\r\narguments  is  the contention that  the  present  law\r\n\r\ngives  rise  to  a serious conflict for  the  doctor,\r\n\r\nbetween the duty to serve the patient and the duty to\r\n\r\nobey  the  law. With all due respect to the Minister,\r\n\r\nwho has been a distinguished legal practitioner, I am\r\n\r\nof  the view that there is no such conflict. The duty\r\n\r\nof  a  doctor  to serve his patient has  always  been\r\n\r\nconditioned  and  determined by his medical  training\r\n\r\nand  the  Hippocratic oath. It is my contention  that\r\n\r\nany law governing would only serve, as it does\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nat  present,  to  restrict the scope within  which  a\r\n\r\ndoctor  can  exercise  his discretion  to  serve  his\r\n\r\npatient in the best interest of the patient. I  would\r\n\r\nhave  thought  that the Minister should have  pursued\r\n\r\nhis  fundamental contention - namely, that abortion  is\r\n\r\ndesirable  and  necessary  in  the  context  of   the\r\n\r\nRepublic - to  its  logical  conclusion  by  repealing\r\n\r\nsections  312  to 316 and 511 of the Penal  Code  and\r\n\r\nenacting henceforth that abortion is an offence  only\r\n\r\nif  it is performed by medically unqualified persons.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  if  abortion is not intrinsically  wrong,\r\n\r\nwhy  should  members of such a responsible profession\r\n\r\nbe  made  subject to petty, harassing  man-made  laws\r\n\r\npertaining to abortion?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also a strong objection to the portion of the\r\n\r\nMinister's  speech relating to clause  10  (3)  which\r\n\r\nprovides that a doctor can be compelled to perform an\r\n\r\nabortion   against  his  conscience.   The   Minister\r\n\r\njustified  the invasion of a person's  right  to  act\r\n\r\nlegitimately  according  to  his  own  conscience  by\r\n\r\nsaying  that  the legal duty to preserve  life  over-rides  all  religious dogmas and beliefs. I  wish  to\r\n\r\npoint out that in countries such as the United States\r\n\r\nof America and the United Kingdom, even when they are\r\n\r\nengaged in a struggle of life and death, they do  not\r\n\r\ncompel  their  citizens against their  conscience  to\r\n\r\ncarry out their legal duty to kill in defence of  the\r\n\r\nstate  of which they are citizens. But where abortion\r\n\r\nis  concerned, the Minister is prepared to uphold the\r\n\r\nright  of  a  woman  who,  in  accordance  with   her\r\n\r\nconscience, demands an abortion, even at the  expense\r\n\r\nof  the  right of the doctor to refuse to perform  or\r\n\r\nassist in an abortion against his conscience. Thus an\r\n\r\nirony may arise later that while our police force  is\r\n\r\nnot  efficient  enough to enforce the  observance  of\r\n\r\nlaws  relating to criminal abortion as  the  Minister\r\n\r\nadmits,  there would be no difficulty in  prosecuting\r\n\r\ndoctors,  particularly those in  government  service,\r\n\r\nfor refusing to perform abortions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already in existence at present a law\r\n\r\npermitting abortion to be carried\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  on  the grounds that such an action is necessary\r\n\r\nto  save a woman's life, and today before this  House\r\n\r\nis  a  Bill intended to reform and to liberalise this\r\n\r\nlaw.  One  notable  feature  of  this  Bill  is   the\r\n\r\nextension of the law to permit abortion to be carried\r\n\r\nout  on social and economic grounds, and this feature\r\n\r\nto which I am referring is embodied in clause 5, sub-clause (2) (b) . This sub-clause, judging from the way\r\n\r\nthe  term  \"environment\" is defined,  makes  abortion\r\n\r\nreadily  available  to a substantial  number  of  our\r\n\r\nwomen  folk  who would be able to have  abortion  for\r\n\r\ntheir   unwanted   foetus   under   the   cover    of\r\n\r\nenvironmental circumstances. This sub-clause will, in\r\n\r\npractice, virtually allow abortion on demand  by  the\r\n\r\npersons  concerned. The underlying principle of  this\r\n\r\nsub-clause  represents  a  radical  change   of   the\r\n\r\nattitude  of  the  Government towards  abortion,  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  constitutes  the  main  reason  behind   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's move to liberalise the law  relating  to\r\n\r\nabortion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government's intention to liberalise the\r\n\r\nlaw  on abortion was first made known, it came  as  a\r\n\r\ncomplete  surprise  to  the public  especially  since\r\n\r\nthere  does  not  seem  to have been  any  widespread\r\n\r\npublic  clamour  for a change in the present  law  on\r\n\r\nabortion.   Naturally  there   were   strong   public\r\n\r\nreactions  to  the  Bill, even  though  it  would  be\r\n\r\ngranted that there was also a favourable response  to\r\n\r\nit.  But  it appears to me that there seems  to  have\r\n\r\nbeen  more  adverse than favourable response  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  intention.  The  Health  Minister   may\r\n\r\ndisagree  with me here. One section of the  community\r\n\r\nwhich  is greatly opposed to the Bill is the  medical\r\n\r\nprofession itself. The Singapore Medical Association,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the  spokesman for  Singapore  doctors  in\r\n\r\nmatters  relating  to  their profession,  is  divided\r\n\r\namong  itself towards the proposed Bill  before  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  One  would  gather the impression  that  many\r\n\r\ndoctors  have strong objections, founded  on  medical\r\n\r\ngrounds,  against the liberalisation of the  abortion\r\n\r\nlaw,  and I suggest that due consideration and weight\r\n\r\nbe given to their objections since\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  are  most qualified to comment on  the  medical\r\n\r\naspects  of  abortion. The objection of many  doctors\r\n\r\nagainst  liberalising the law on abortion is  on  the\r\n\r\nground that every operation for abortion carries with\r\n\r\nit  definite risks endangering the patient's life and\r\n\r\nhealth.  It will seem unreasonable for the Government\r\n\r\nto ignore such an important objection since this is a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  life and death. Medical science  has  not\r\n\r\nadvanced to such a stage as to ensure absolute safety\r\n\r\nfor  the patient undergoing abortion, no matter  what\r\n\r\nsafeguards  are  taken. An element  of  risk  to  the\r\n\r\npatient's life and health is always present. I do not\r\n\r\nfind  the  reasons  behind the Government's  proposal\r\n\r\ncompelling  enough  to  make  us  ignore   the   risk\r\n\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point of view to consider if we\r\n\r\nwant  to  liberalise  the law  on  abortion.  If  the\r\n\r\nabortion  law  is  liberalised, and the  practice  of\r\n\r\nabortion becomes widespread and \"respectable\", so  to\r\n\r\nspeak,  it would lead to a loss of respect for  human\r\n\r\nlife.  True,  there  has been much  controversy  over\r\n\r\nwhether  the foetus can be considered to be  a  human\r\n\r\nbeing. But whatever differences of views there may be\r\n\r\nas  to  the  true nature of the foetus, one  must  at\r\n\r\nleast accept that the foetus should not be treated as\r\n\r\nmere  waste-matter to be disposed of as circumstances\r\n\r\nrequire. Many eminent doctors hold the view that life\r\n\r\nis  present in full potentiality from the  moment  of\r\n\r\nconception   and   that  there   are   no   intrinsic\r\n\r\ndifferences between the foetus at conception  and  at\r\n\r\nbirth  -  the  only differences being  the  stage  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment. If our own convenience is put before our\r\n\r\nrespect  for  a  human life which is  not  yet  fully\r\n\r\ndeveloped, there is reason to fear that this attitude\r\n\r\nwill  spread.  In  other words,  once  we  allow  the\r\n\r\ndestruction of human life on the grounds that  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  completely  human, then we  leave  the  way  for\r\n\r\nothers  to  argue  what constitutes  complete  \"human\r\n\r\nlife\".  Once we start to value human beings according\r\n\r\nto  their  worth to the society, our attention  would\r\n\r\nthen be directed to those persons without whom  our\r\n\r\nsociety might be considered better off. We may  start\r\n\r\nto think in terms of getting rid of the aged,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  incurably sick, the deformed and so  on.  Surely\r\n\r\nthis is not the kind of society we desire and the way\r\n\r\nby which we want our society to evolve.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, the objections to reforming and\r\n\r\nliberalising   the  abortion  law  on   medical   and\r\n\r\nhumanitarian grounds are very valid no matter what my\r\n\r\ngood friend, the Minister for Health, may say. Let us\r\n\r\nnow  examine some of the reasons advanced by him  for\r\n\r\nthe  proposed changes of the abortion law as embodied\r\n\r\nin  the  Bill.  One  reason  seems  to  be  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wants to make abortion available  as  the\r\n\r\nultimate  method  of  population control  when  other\r\n\r\nmethods  of  family  planning  have  failed.  Another\r\n\r\nreason  may  be that the Government wants  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat the Republic is not burdened with the care of un\r\n\r\nwanted  babies. The third reason may be that  through\r\n\r\nliberalising  the  law  on abortion,  the  Government\r\n\r\nhopes  to get rid of the unqualified quacks  now  per\r\n\r\nforming illegal abortions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears at this juncture necessary to ask two\r\n\r\npertinent   questions.  First,  will   the   proposed\r\n\r\nAbortion  Bill  achieve  the  desired  results?  And,\r\n\r\nsecondly,  if so, will the harm done be greater  than\r\n\r\nthe good achieved? In my opinion, the probable answer\r\n\r\nto  the  above two questions is that it  is  possible\r\n\r\nthat  the Government might achieve partially some  of\r\n\r\nthe  desired results at the price of seeing more harm\r\n\r\ndone than good achieved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If abortion is resorted to as an ultimate means of\r\n\r\npopulation control when other family planning methods\r\n\r\nhave  failed, then it will either be rarely  resorted\r\n\r\nto  -  in  which  case  it will make  no  significant\r\n\r\ndifference to the overall population - or it will  be\r\n\r\nsomething widespread - in which case it is a very bad\r\n\r\nmeans  of  birth control, because it is dangerous  to\r\n\r\nthe  health of the woman and, also, because  it  only\r\n\r\nsolves the problem for a short time, especially  when\r\n\r\na  woman  can  become pregnant again within  a  short\r\n\r\nperiod after abortion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will therefore appear that the logical step to\r\n\r\ntake  in planning population control would be to step\r\n\r\nup our national\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncampaign  on  family  planning and  to  increase  the\r\n\r\neffectiveness  and efficiency of our family  planning\r\n\r\nmachinery,  to enable a sizable number of  our  women\r\n\r\npopulation  to  take advantage of the facilities  and\r\n\r\nadvice of our national family planning board.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the White Paper on Family Planning of September\r\n\r\n1965 the Government stated:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If our Family Planning Plan succeeds, the present\r\n\r\ncrude birth rate of over 30 per thousand in Singapore\r\n\r\ncould  be reduced to around 20 per thousand and  with\r\n\r\nour  death  rate  remaining constant around  six  per\r\n\r\nthousand,  Singapore's net increase in population  in\r\n\r\nthe  1970's  could be brought down to around  15  per\r\n\r\nthousand  - which will bring Singapore in  line  with\r\n\r\nprevailing rates of population increase applicable to\r\n\r\nprosperous and advanced countries elsewhere.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1966 and 1967 Annual Reports of the Singapore\r\n\r\nFamily  Planning and Population Board  indicate  that\r\n\r\nour national family planning programmes have achieved\r\n\r\na  significant reduction in our annual  birth  rates,\r\n\r\nand can become effective means of population control.\r\n\r\nThis  was  achieved  despite the  fact  that  a  vast\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the  women population  have  not  taken\r\n\r\nadvantage of the facilities and advice of the  Family\r\n\r\nPlanning  programmes.  As improvements  are  made  to\r\n\r\nextend  the services of the Singapore Family Planning\r\n\r\nand Population Board to reach a greater number of the\r\n\r\nwomen population in Singapore, I would expect to  see\r\n\r\na further drop in the annual birth-rate in Singapore.\r\n\r\nSurely,  the logical step for the Government to  take\r\n\r\nat this juncture should be to develop the services of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Family Planning and Population Board to\r\n\r\nsuch an extent as to reach the maximum number of  our\r\n\r\nwomen  population  to achieve a significant  drop  in\r\n\r\nannual  birth-rate rather than for the Government  to\r\n\r\nintroduce measures to liberalise the law on  abortion\r\n\r\nas an effective means to plan our population control.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In talking about population control, I do not think\r\n\r\nit  is  out  of place for me here to point  out  that\r\n\r\nsometimes  under-population can hamper  the  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment and progress of a country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile  I  do not see that under-population will  ever\r\n\r\nbecome a problem that we have to face, I do not  also\r\n\r\nsee  over-population becoming an over-riding  problem\r\n\r\nthat  we  have to face in our efforts to bring  about\r\n\r\nthe  economic  progress and advancement  of  our  two\r\n\r\nmillion  citizens. In Singapore today, while we  talk\r\n\r\nof unemployment of so many thousands on the one hand,\r\n\r\nwe  also find ourselves faced with the problem  of  a\r\n\r\nskilled labour shortage on the other hand. We  cannot\r\n\r\nhope  to expand industrially at a desired rate if  we\r\n\r\nlack  the skilled labour and the technocrats  to  man\r\n\r\nand run our factories. The problem, therefore, is not\r\n\r\none  of  number. The problem is how do  we  plan  and\r\n\r\ntrain   our  manpower  resources  according  to   our\r\n\r\nnational needs. If today, by a miracle, we can  train\r\n\r\nthe   unemployed   to  become  skilled   labour   and\r\n\r\ntechnocrats,  then  we can ensure for  ourselves  the\r\n\r\nsuccess in our industrial expansion and progress  and\r\n\r\nsolve  our  unemployment  problem.  Desirable  though\r\n\r\npopulation  control may be for planning our  economic\r\n\r\nprogress  and  advancement, it does  not  necessarily\r\n\r\nmean  that  we  must reduce the number of  births  to\r\n\r\nzero.  A  certain  number of births is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  our population at its prevailing  level.  A\r\n\r\nliberal abortion law which permits all babies  to  be\r\n\r\nkilled  before they are born, theoretically speaking,\r\n\r\nwill  serve to defeat the very purpose for which  the\r\n\r\nBill was proposed - to ensure the continuing survival\r\n\r\nof our Republic.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister in his speech also pointed out that the\r\n\r\ncentral  purpose  of the Bill may be  to  ensure  the \r\n\r\nquality of the life of children born in Singapore.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Not \"may be\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> All right.

Are we to consider them as unwanted children?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the Government hopes to get rid of\r\n\r\nthe   illegal  or  the  unqualified  quacks   through\r\n\r\nliberalisation  of  the law on abortion.  This  again\r\n\r\ncannot  be achieved as long as there are stipulations\r\n\r\nrestricting the circumstances under which an abortion\r\n\r\nmay  be legally permitted. Women who cannot meet  the\r\n\r\nstipulations will continue to seek illegal abortions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all that I have said, I feel that this is\r\n\r\nnot  the  proper time for the Government to introduce\r\n\r\nlegislation to liberalise the law on abortion. It  is\r\n\r\nto  be  hoped  that  such a move  will  never  become\r\n\r\nnecessary in Singapore. I therefore strongly urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment to withdraw the Abortion Bill in the light\r\n\r\nof what I have said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in full support  of\r\n\r\nthe  Abortion  Bill  now before  this  House.  It  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  purpose of record to state  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  decision  to introduce  this  piece  of\r\n\r\nprogressive legislation to legalise and to liberalise\r\n\r\nabortion was taken nearly two years ago, when  I  was\r\n\r\nthen  in  charge of the Ministry of Health.  A  great\r\n\r\ndeal   of   time,  thought  and  consideration   has,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  been given to the drafting of this  Bill,\r\n\r\nas  we  are  fully aware of the highly  controversial\r\n\r\nnature of the legislation to be enacted, and the  hue\r\n\r\nand  cry that will be raised by those holding  strong\r\n\r\nreligious views on the subject, as well as those  who\r\n\r\nare   sincere,   conscientious  objectors.

It must  be\r\n\r\nremembered,  however, that the large  majority,  espe\r\n\r\ncially  the  women folk who will benefit  under  this\r\n\r\nBill  and who are, I am sure, in full agreement  with\r\n\r\nthe  principles of the Bill, prefer to remain  silent\r\n\r\non it. As the saying goes, silence means consent.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first recall, briefly, the background of how\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  came into being. I can assure this  House\r\n\r\nthat  the  liberalisation of the law on abortion  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  is no flash-in-the-pan idea, just  to  hit\r\n\r\nthe  headlines, but a sober, measured, deliberate and\r\n\r\nultimate step for the full emancipation of our women.\r\n\r\nWe  passed the Women's Charter of 1961 which gives to\r\n\r\nour  women  (other  than those who subscribe  to  the\r\n\r\nMuslim faith) equality of status and security through\r\n\r\nthe one-man, one-wife law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are no longer chattels to be trifled with but\r\n\r\nequal  partners in a marriage. In my view, the  right\r\n\r\nof a woman to decide whether or not she is to bear  a\r\n\r\nchild  can  only be guaranteed if it is made  \"legal\"\r\n\r\nfor her, of her own free will, to undergo an abortion\r\n\r\nif  she so decides. Indeed, we would fail in our aim,\r\n\r\nthat  of  giving our women folk who, after all,  form\r\n\r\none-half of the human race living on this earth, full\r\n\r\nequality  in  the eyes of the law if we do  not  pass\r\n\r\nthis Bill to give her the right to decide whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  to have another baby. Having a baby is something\r\n\r\nno  man can ever understand because, physically,  man\r\n\r\nis  incapable of bearing children. Man  does  not  go\r\n\r\nthrough the profound\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexperience  of  childbirth and the attendant  mother-love  of tending and caring for the young till it  is\r\n\r\nable  to  look after itself, after years of laborious\r\n\r\ncare,  pain  and  sorrow. As men,  we  tend  to  talk\r\n\r\nsomewhat  lightly about the pangs of childbirth.  How\r\n\r\nmany  of us fathers who are not medical doctors  like\r\n\r\nyourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, have watched their\r\n\r\nwives  at  childbirth?  I  have.  It  is  only  after\r\n\r\nwatching  a  mother going through such an  experience\r\n\r\nthat  one  can understand the problem of the unwanted\r\n\r\nchild  to the woman - not the man. Mother-love is  so\r\n\r\nstrong and powerful and yet she chooses to abort.  It\r\n\r\ngoes  against her very nature to do it. But when  she\r\n\r\ndoes  make  that  decision, it must have  been  under\r\n\r\ngreat  provocation. Having an abortion is no  picnic.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  fun.  It is painful. It is  a  traumatic\r\n\r\nexperience, as mentioned by the hon. Member, and  the\r\n\r\nwoman  who  decides on an abortion does not  come  to\r\n\r\nsuch  a decision lightly. I, therefore say, that when\r\n\r\na  woman decides on an abortion, the least we can  do\r\n\r\nfor her is not to make it harder for her by labelling\r\n\r\nit as \"illegal\" and thus make her desperate enough to\r\n\r\ndo  something furtive and, worse still, to  go  under\r\n\r\nthe  counter, with all the attendant dangers that  go\r\n\r\nwith  illegal  activities, to  get  what  she  wants,\r\n\r\ndespite the fear, the risks that are being taken  and\r\n\r\nthe  rapacious  swindle that goes  on  by  those  who\r\n\r\nprofit out of it, just because of the existence of an\r\n\r\nantiquated law which, far from protecting women,  has\r\n\r\nmade them victims of it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Japan, which introduced legalised abortion in\r\n\r\n1948  as  a  population control measure  long  before\r\n\r\nfamily  planning  came  into  the  picture,   we   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, on the other hand, are fortunate to have a\r\n\r\nsuccessful mass family planning programme  in  action\r\n\r\nbefore  contemplating the introduction of  a  law  to\r\n\r\nliberalise  abortion. This is therefore no  desperate\r\n\r\nmeasure  to  control population growth in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  success of the first three years, 1966 to  1968,\r\n\r\nof   our  Five-Year  Family  Planning  programme  has\r\n\r\nalready brought\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndown  the  natural rate of increase of our population\r\n\r\nby  over  six  points,  i.e.,  from  24.4  per  1,000\r\n\r\npopulation  in 1965, the year before the introduction\r\n\r\nof  the  Five-Year Plan, to 18.2 per 1,000 population\r\n\r\nin 1968. This is a most satisfactory position indeed,\r\n\r\nand a record, probably unequalled elsewhere, for such\r\n\r\ngood results within the short space of three years of\r\n\r\nan action programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who ask, since our family planning\r\n\r\nprogramme  is  so successful, why then introduce  the\r\n\r\ncontroversial  issue  of  liberalising  the  law   on\r\n\r\nabortion?  Is  this  necessary?  The  answer   is   a\r\n\r\ncategorical  yes.  Once  the  principle   of   family\r\n\r\nplanning is accepted, i.e., that not every sex  union\r\n\r\nmust   automatically  result  in  a  conception   and\r\n\r\nthereafter  the  birth of a child,  it  automatically\r\n\r\nfollows  that  legalised abortion  for  contraceptive\r\n\r\nfailures  must be conceded to, and that is what  this\r\n\r\nAbortion Bill aims to achieve.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those who practise family planning, and they\r\n\r\nmust  include  many Members in this House  and  those\r\n\r\noutside   this  House,  must  know  how  easily   con\r\n\r\ntraceptive  failures can arise, whatever  the  method\r\n\r\nused - be it the rhythm method, which is reported  to\r\n\r\nhave  as high a failure rate as 75 per cent - a  most\r\n\r\nunreliable  method indeed, and other methods  like  a\r\n\r\ntear  in  the condom, whether through age  or  faulty\r\n\r\nmanufacture,  or  vaginal cream which  has  gone  off\r\n\r\nbecause  of time or temperature or being inadequately\r\n\r\nspread  out,  or forgetting to take the contraceptive\r\n\r\npill   for  one  occasion,  or  impatience  or  over-zealousness on the part of one or both partners. I do\r\n\r\nnot think I need go further into the subject. But  it\r\n\r\nis  patently clear that contraceptive failures  occur\r\n\r\ninevitably,  sometime  and somehow,  with  the  woman\r\n\r\nmissing  her next menstrual period - the  first  sure\r\n\r\nsign that conception has taken place. What then?  Why\r\n\r\ndo    we   practise   family   planning?

It is then the duty of Government  to  have\r\n\r\nthe   best   facilities  available  to  rectify   the\r\n\r\n\"accident\"  which has arisen and to heal  and  repair\r\n\r\nany damage that may have been caused.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague, the Minister for Health, said\r\n\r\nyesterday in his speech, it is possible for those who\r\n\r\nare  rich and able to pay the price for abortions  to\r\n\r\nbe  performed  legally under the guise of  dilatation\r\n\r\nand  curettage (i.e., dilatation of the neck  of  the\r\n\r\nwomb).  That is what abortion is. But because of  the\r\n\r\nso-called  ethics practised in the medical profession\r\n\r\nthat  of  secrecy between doctor and patient  -  very\r\n\r\nlittle  comes  out  unless a fatality  or  a  scandal\r\n\r\noccurs. So you hear very little about it. But  it  is\r\n\r\ngoing  on.  It  must  be  said  for  the  profession,\r\n\r\nhowever,  that most doctors will not be  prepared  to\r\n\r\nperform   abortions  under  the  present  Jaw,   but,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  many doctors are painfully  aware  of\r\n\r\nthe   unsavoury   \"goings-on\"  of   some   of   their\r\n\r\ncompatriots who have less scruples and are performing\r\n\r\nthese  supposedly \"illegal\" abortions, raking in  the\r\n\r\nmoney and exploiting the desperation of many women in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now read out a relevant paragraph of the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper mentioned by my Friend across the  Floor\r\n\r\non  Family Planning (Command Paper 22 of 1965), which\r\n\r\nwas published on 27th September, 1965, paragraph 8.2:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Purpose of 5-Year Plan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should not be forgotten that many women in\r\n\r\ndesperation   over  innumerable  child-bearing,   are\r\n\r\nresorting  to  illegal abortion as a way  out.  Every\r\n\r\nyear  nearly  500  patients  are  being  admitted  to\r\n\r\nKandang   Kerbau   Maternity  Hospital   in   serious\r\n\r\ncondition,  and their cases are clinically  diagnosed\r\n\r\nas  being  \"abortions with sepsis\", and  these  could\r\n\r\nwell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  been  the  result of unsuccessful  attempts  at\r\n\r\ninduced abortion. It is estimated that for every  one\r\n\r\nwho  is  hospitalised there may be as  many  as  five\r\n\r\ngoing  undetected. This yearly tragedy  of  suffering\r\n\r\nand   exploitation  of  thousands  of   women   which\r\n\r\nsometimes result in death must be stopped!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us put a stop to these malpractices by\r\n\r\nmaking  it  legal for our women to have abortions  if\r\n\r\nthey  so desire. Let us not have one law for the rich\r\n\r\nand  another for the middle class and the  poor,  who\r\n\r\nresort  to  all kinds of dangerous forms  of  induced\r\n\r\nabortions just because they cannot afford to pay  the\r\n\r\nhigh  sum and the price for a \"legal\" abortion to  be\r\n\r\nperformed in the aseptic conditions of a private well-equipped clinic or hospital under the present law.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why am I so confident that only the minority oppose\r\n\r\nthe  liberalising  of  the law  on  abortion?  Taking\r\n\r\nfamily  planning  as the cue, when  implementing  the\r\n\r\nFive-Year Mass Family Planning programme in  1966,  a\r\n\r\nsenior   official  of  the  Health  Ministry   (since\r\n\r\nretired)  in the Maternal and Child Health Department\r\n\r\nasked:  \"What  are we to do with staff  (doctors  and\r\n\r\nnurses)  who  are  opposed  to  family  planning   on\r\n\r\nreligious  grounds?\" My answer was a  straightforward\r\n\r\nadministrative one. \"Ask them to put in writing  that\r\n\r\nthey wish to be excused from family planning work  on\r\n\r\nreligious grounds and we can then transfer  them  out\r\n\r\nto  other  sections in the Ministry - we do not  sack\r\n\r\nthem  where  their  religious scruples  need  not  be\r\n\r\nembarrassed.\" The result was a request  for  transfer\r\n\r\nby  only two members of the staff (one doctor and one\r\n\r\nnurse) out of a staff of hundreds. That is all!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who oppose this Bill, we simply say no one\r\n\r\nis  being  compelled to have abortions. The  affected\r\n\r\nwoman  has to decide, of her own free will, that  she\r\n\r\nwants it. No one is going to force her to do it.  She\r\n\r\nhas  to come to that conclusion herself. The decision\r\n\r\nis  something for her to make. So if you must  oppose\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  you  are  at  liberty  not  to  have  an\r\n\r\nabortion. Have your baby, it is yours to have and  to\r\n\r\nhold, but please leave others alone and do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  interfere with the wishes of others who  want  a\r\n\r\nlegal abortion. Do not stand in their way. Stay  off!\r\n\r\nJust as we respect the views of those who differ,  so\r\n\r\nshould  they respect the views of others who want  to\r\n\r\nhave  legal  abortions  and to exercise  their  legal\r\n\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I say a vote to liberalise the law on\r\n\r\nabortion  is  a vote for progressive legislation  and\r\n\r\nfor the full\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemancipation of our women.
