It is quite possible, Sir, that in the near\r\n\r\nfuture,  this increase in the price of petrol will  be\r\n\r\npassed  on  to those who have to use public transport.\r\n\r\nNor  have  the  owners of private cars  been  let  off\r\n\r\nlightly.  Sir, car owners in the higher  income  group\r\n\r\nmay  be able to take the increase of 20 cents a gallon\r\n\r\non  petrol, they can afford it. But for those who find\r\n\r\nit  necessary or convenient to own a car for a  number\r\n\r\nof  good reasons, this increase will result, when they\r\n\r\ncome  to  balance their monthly budgets, in having  to\r\n\r\nrob Peter to pay Paul.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking closely at the picture, Sir, one cannot help\r\n\r\ncoming  to  the  conclusion that it is those  who  can\r\n\r\nleast afford it who will be the most hard hit by  this\r\n\r\nincrease  of 20 cents a gallon on petrol. For example,\r\n\r\nSir,  take a clerk who owns a car, draws $300 a  month\r\n\r\nsalary,  and  uses 1\u00bd gallons of petrol  a  day.  This\r\n\r\nmeans  that  the increased charge to him  will  be  30\r\n\r\ncents.  This  clerk who owns a car conveys  neighbours\r\n\r\nwho  work near his office or in the same office.  They\r\n\r\npay  him,  on  mutual agreement, $10 per  man,  which\r\n\r\nmeans  that each of them will have to pay an  addition\r\n\r\nof $2 per head. This is what I do not like, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is a taxi. Owners of taxis work on\r\n\r\nday  and  night shifts. The majority of them use  five\r\n\r\ngallons  of petrol per shift. An increase of 20  cents\r\n\r\nin  the  price of petrol will mean an addition of  one\r\n\r\ndollar  to the cost. As taxi drivers now earn  at  the\r\n\r\nrate  of  $5 per shift, this will mean that they  will\r\n\r\nlose  a dollar, thus reducing their actual earning  to\r\n\r\nonly  $4. How can they live on $4 a day at the present\r\n\r\ntime?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, instead of imposing an additional tax on petrol\r\n\r\nto  meet  part  of  the deficit  of  $8  million,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   should   concentrate   its   energy    on\r\n\r\nencouraging  the establishment of industries  here  by\r\n\r\nforeign  investors,  so that more employment  will  be\r\n\r\navailable  to  local citizens. With  more  employment,\r\n\r\nmore  money  will be in circulation. Instead,  we  are\r\n\r\ntold  by the Financial Secretary (column 2843), \"Money\r\n\r\nis tighter.\" Sir, it is obvious that foreign investors\r\n\r\ncan  only be induced to come here to set up industries\r\n\r\nif the Government is in a position to assure them that\r\n\r\nthe  business and political climates here are  healthy\r\n\r\nfor  their  enterprises. If such  conditions  are  not\r\n\r\nforthcoming in 1958, I am afraid there may be  even  a\r\n\r\nlarger deficit when the Financial Secretary makes  his\r\n\r\nnext  budget speech. Additional means of taxation  may\r\n\r\nthen have to be found to meet the deficit and probably\r\n\r\nit  will  again be those who can least afford  it  who\r\n\r\nwill have to foot the bill.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point on industry. The Government\r\n\r\nconcentrates on having more industry in Singapore, but\r\n\r\nthe  industries have to pay company tax or income  tax\r\n\r\nat the rate of 30 per cent. And we have export tax and\r\n\r\nimport tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> There is no import tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan:</b> We must bear these in mind. On\r\n\r\nbig   industries,  Sir,  the  Hon. the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommerce  and  Industry says, 'Oh, we have  a  few  of\r\n\r\nthese  industries  breaking down, but  we  have  small\r\n\r\nindustries coming up.' Sir, one must realise that if a\r\n\r\nbig  industry closes down we may have unemployment  of\r\n\r\n300 persons. The small industries come up, and two  or\r\n\r\nthree of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  may employ only about 100 people. So the balance\r\n\r\nof  200 persons are still unemployed. The Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Welfare is therefore  not  seeing  things\r\n\r\nquite  clearly.  Also  each  unemployed  man  may   be\r\n\r\nsupporting a wife and child. I take the family to be a\r\n\r\nsmall one. So, 200 unemployed each with a family of  a\r\n\r\nwife  and  child - an addition of two - will mean  another\r\n\r\n400  unemployed, making the total 600 instead of  only\r\n\r\n200.  Sir,  this  is what I expect  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour and Welfare should look into.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, income tax. An increase in taxation\r\n\r\nmay  be coming up. When the 1958 budget comes up,  the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary  will  say,  'We  are  still   in\r\n\r\ndeficit.  We  have no money now. So we are  trying  to\r\n\r\nfind  some  way to meet the deficit.' That means  more\r\n\r\ntax  will be coming up for the wage-earner. We are now\r\n\r\nnot  taxing  those  earning  $3,000  a  year  but  the\r\n\r\nGovernment may think, 'Ah, we must do something to get\r\n\r\nsome money by fixing up a minimum of $25 income tax on\r\n\r\n$3,000.' Who is going to suffer in the end? It is  the\r\n\r\nlower income group.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I come now to the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary's remarks on Malayanisation. He said (column\r\n\r\n2824):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... it is likely that actual expenditure in 1957\r\n\r\nwill amount to about $242 million. It should be noted,\r\n\r\nhowever, that this total includes a sum of $9  million\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  compensation under the Malayanisation\r\n\r\nScheme.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very good, Sir, I have no quarrel with the principle\r\n\r\nof Malayanisation. In fact I am all in favour of it. I\r\n\r\nvoted for it.\r\n\r\nBut  what  I  do  not  like about one  aspect  of  the\r\n\r\noperation  of the Malayanisation Scheme is  that  when\r\n\r\ncertain expatriate officers are upgraded they take the\r\n\r\nopportunity  shortly thereafter to retire and  thereby\r\n\r\nreceive  higher Malayanisation benefits. I have  heard\r\n\r\nof  certain senior police officers who, while on leave\r\n\r\nabroad  8,000 miles away from Singapore, were promoted\r\n\r\nto  higher  ranks. They came back from leave  to  fill\r\n\r\ntheir higher appointments for just a few\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonths  and  thereafter elected to  retire  under  the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  scheme  with larger  retirement  sums.\r\n\r\nThis  business of being here today and there  tomorrow\r\n\r\nshould be stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the opposite Government Benches must realise\r\n\r\nthat  the  amount  we  have  for  payment  under   the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation scheme comes out of public  money,  not\r\n\r\nfrom  ourselves. We must look into this carefully  and\r\n\r\nnot allow expatriates to return from their leave after\r\n\r\nbeing  promoted from grade one to special  grade,  and\r\n\r\nthen  to  retire. Otherwise where are we  to  get  the\r\n\r\nmoney to pay them? It might cost more than $9 million,\r\n\r\nthe  figure stated in the Estimates. Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nthe  Government to look into this matter. We must stop\r\n\r\nthe practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nHon. the Financial Secretary in his last speech as  an\r\n\r\nex-officio  Member of this Assembly  has  taken  great\r\n\r\npains   in  supporting  his  arguments  for  increased\r\n\r\nexpenditure and consequent increased taxation. He  has\r\n\r\nalso  drawn a gloomy picture for the future. Sir,  not\r\n\r\nonly  he  but his predecessors have from time to  time\r\n\r\ndrawn  such pictures. I do think the picture  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture  is  gloomy  when one looks  at  the  appalling\r\n\r\nexpenditure. Sir, be has raised matters in his  speech\r\n\r\nwith  regard to stability and so on. I would  like  to\r\n\r\ntouch on the speech he made the other day.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the backbone of our income is the entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade. Now nearly 150 years old, Singapore, what it is\r\n\r\ntoday, is built on entrepot trade. This life-blood  we\r\n\r\ncan  still preserve if we try but there are conditions\r\n\r\nto  keep  this entrepot trade. First, Sir, is economic\r\n\r\nstability.  Now,  Sir, economic stability  depends  on\r\n\r\npolitical stability. An unstable government can  never\r\n\r\ninspire   confidence  in  the  minds  of  the  public,\r\n\r\nespecially the investor, and unless there is a  stable\r\n\r\ngovernment, of the elected majority - I wonder  why  the\r\n\r\nNominated  Member Mr Thomas should laugh at this - this\r\n\r\nis an acknowledged   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfact  which  I  can  prove;  and  can  anyone\r\n\r\nchallenge  this fact, that unless there  is  a  stable\r\n\r\ngovernment with an elected majority of the people, the\r\n\r\ngovernment is not stable? Sir, I will deal  more  with\r\n\r\nthis subject a little later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, entrepot trade requires low handing charges.\r\n\r\nHandling charges should be the lowest to preserve  and\r\n\r\ncompete  with  neighbouring countries  in  selling  or\r\n\r\ntranshipping  your goods, either imports  or  exports,\r\n\r\nfrom  this territory. Now when I say handling  charges\r\n\r\nit  means  lorry  and  boat hire, insurance,  overhead\r\n\r\ncharges,  profits and so on, plus cheap  labour.  Sir,\r\n\r\nanother  condition to preserve this state  is  a  free\r\n\r\ntrade  policy. We have heard time and time again  wild\r\n\r\ntalk of import duties or expectation of import duties,\r\n\r\nand  of  luxury taxation (of course dead now, I hope).\r\n\r\nSuch  talk  keeps  the mind of the public  in  a  very\r\n\r\nuncertain  state. There is a fear and trade  will  not\r\n\r\nsettle  down at its own proper level. If you  want  to\r\n\r\npreserve the entrepot trade, free trade policy  should\r\n\r\ngo on as it is now.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth thing is capital and labour. Sir, we\r\n\r\nshould  not  forget  that the  reason  why  Singapore,\r\n\r\noriginally  a  fishing village, is today a  prosperous\r\n\r\ncity  is  due  to  its entrepot trade.  In  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance,   capital  was  brought   by   the   British\r\n\r\nmerchants.  But capital could not do anything  without\r\n\r\nlabour,  and labour was brought from India and  China.\r\n\r\nCapital  and labour worked hand in hand and  therefore\r\n\r\nwe  now  see a prosperous place. In other words,  Sir,\r\n\r\ncapital  and  labour,  in  the  peculiar  position  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  is  inter-dependent.  I  have  said   this\r\n\r\npreviously  and  I  repeat it again. Without  capital,\r\n\r\nlabour  cannot  exist. Capital can always  flow  in  a\r\n\r\nfavourable  climate. Therefore, in a place like  this,\r\n\r\nwe  should  see  that the capital is  there  and  that\r\n\r\nlabour is cooperating with capital.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me say this. When I said that in the first\r\n\r\ninstance  the  British brought the capital,  I  should\r\n\r\nalso  say  that they have taken back to England  many,\r\n\r\nmany   times   more   of  what   they   brought   into\r\n\r\nSingapore - through dividends, salaries,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npensions, banking, insurance, shipping, etc.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a condition to preserve a state of racial and\r\n\r\nclass   harmony  demands  that  preaching  or   saying\r\n\r\nanything which can create this racial or class  hatred\r\n\r\nwill  destroy  the economy of this city.  Can  we  get\r\n\r\ncapital  from abroad to come to this city if  we  have\r\n\r\nwild  talk which does more harm than good? We do  know\r\n\r\nthat  we  want  capital.  No country  can  do  without\r\n\r\nforeign capital. That is the position today in Asia.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us, Sir, depend on our sound commonsense. Many\r\n\r\npeople  have brought in a lot of \"isms\", possibly  all\r\n\r\nfrom  foreign countries. Now, Sir, Singapore  being  a\r\n\r\nsmall  city, can we not form a policy taking the  best\r\n\r\nof the two blocs for our economic purpose? I think the\r\n\r\npoliticians  should refrain from talking wild  slogans\r\n\r\nunnecessarily,   which  will   ultimately   harm   the\r\n\r\nmasses - and our population is fast growing with  plenty\r\n\r\nof unemployment.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another factor towards maintaining our entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  is a low cost of living. Can we not reduce  our\r\n\r\ncost  of living? Can we not formulate our policy  that\r\n\r\nour  cost  of  living comes down?  Means  have  to  be\r\n\r\ndevised.  As  it stands today, the cost of  living  is\r\n\r\ngoing higher and higher.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next thing is industry, after entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade. Many a time, politicians on the Government side\r\n\r\nhave  talked  about the development  of  industry  and\r\n\r\nbringing in capital from foreign countries to  develop\r\n\r\nindustry  here.  Sir, this kind  of  bluff  serves  no\r\n\r\npurpose  whatsoever. It might keep people busy  for  a\r\n\r\nshort  time but these false hopes will only  raise  or\r\n\r\ncreate more unemployment and unrest.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, how can industry survive unless these\r\n\r\nconditions are fulfilled? - capital is necessary; there\r\n\r\nshould  be  cheap labour as in competing countries;  a\r\n\r\nlow  cost  of  living so that the  worker  can  remain\r\n\r\ncontented;  a  vast  hinterland for  markets  for  our\r\n\r\ngoods;  political  stability  which  can  satisfy  the\r\n\r\ninvestor  that  his capital is safe;  cheap  power  to\r\n\r\nreduce  our cost of production; low taxation; and  raw\r\n\r\nmaterial of our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nown (but this can be imported if the other factors are\r\n\r\npresent).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say here and now, Sir, it is on these factors\r\n\r\nonly  that  large industries can exist,  and  all  the\r\n\r\nconfusing and irresponsible talk will only cause  more\r\n\r\nharm  than  good.  Have we these  conditions  here?  I\r\n\r\nchallenge  anyone to say that we have.  They  are  not\r\n\r\nexisting at all.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, take for granted that someone starts a\r\n\r\nfactory.  What  are  you going to do  with  the  goods\r\n\r\nproduced  at  high  cost? Can you sell  them?  If  you\r\n\r\ncannot, then that industry has to close down. Then the\r\n\r\nargument starts:\r\n\r\nwhy  not  impose import duties to help this  industry?\r\n\r\nYes,  you can help in that way, but the reason against\r\n\r\nit   is   this - that  you  are  preventing   your   own\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  from  buying cheaper goods  manufactured\r\n\r\nelsewhere in preference to his own goods, to meet  his\r\n\r\nimmediate  needs.  Another thing.  Sir -  if  you  have\r\n\r\nimport duty to preserve such an industry, then you are\r\n\r\nselling your manufactured goods to your own people  at\r\n\r\na  very high price. The result will be this, that  you\r\n\r\nwill have to increase wages and salaries. It leads you\r\n\r\nnowhere.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our population is growing. What is the solution\r\n\r\nthen? The only solution in the circumstances as we are\r\n\r\nfaced  today  is  to develop cottage  and  small-scale\r\n\r\nindustries  of which I spoke also at the  last  budget\r\n\r\nsitting.   We  should  keep  the  families - wives   and\r\n\r\nchildren - busy.  The creation of these industries  only\r\n\r\nis  not sufficient - what is also very necessary is  to\r\n\r\nfoster them with loans, advances, marketing, etc.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, people are blind to these and other\r\n\r\nfactors  when  they  talk  of  import  duties.   Those\r\n\r\ncountries having import duties are already large  with\r\n\r\nvast  populations, and they do not depend on  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  only. We are not in that position; we  in  this\r\n\r\nsmall territory are in a very peculiar position.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, economic stability is very essential and I said\r\n\r\nthat it depends on political stability which can bring\r\n\r\nconfidence to the investor, businessman and worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat  have we seen since this present Government  came\r\n\r\ninto  power?-strikes, lock-outs, unrest, arrests, etc.\r\n\r\nCan  this  bring  any confidence or stability  to  the\r\n\r\npublic mind? We are not better off even today. We  are\r\n\r\nin  the  same  position. Government can  always  avoid\r\n\r\nstrikes by looking into the matter immediately.  If  a\r\n\r\nstrike  takes  place and is settled, it leaves  a  bad\r\n\r\ntaste  in  both  the  mouth of the  employer  and  the\r\n\r\nemployee.   Settlement  should  be  made  immediately,\r\n\r\nbefore a strike develops. Sir, the masses should  also\r\n\r\nunderstand that they should not be misled by the wrong\r\n\r\npeople. After all, they will be hitting themselves  by\r\n\r\nthis process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the short period of the Coalition Government\r\n\r\nwe  have  had two commissions of corruption appointed.\r\n\r\nCan they bring stability to the minds of the public?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to expenditure, Sir, there should be very\r\n\r\nrigid   control  of  expenditure,  both  capital   and\r\n\r\nadministrative.  Cut  down  extravagant   expenditure,\r\n\r\nbanquets and unnecessary travelling, and cut our  coat\r\n\r\naccording to our stature.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one can compare our expenditure and income with\r\n\r\nthose of the Federation, our neighbour. The Federation\r\n\r\nhas a population four times bigger than Singapore. The\r\n\r\nFederation  has  thousands of miles of territories  to\r\n\r\nadminister. They have an Emergency too. If you compare\r\n\r\nit  with  our 220 odd square miles, you will see  that\r\n\r\nour expenditure is definitely very high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as an illustration I might mention conferences.\r\n\r\nIn previous years, Sir, Singapore was more politically\r\n\r\nadvanced than the Federation. When we were invited  to\r\n\r\nconferences,  the  Federation  used  to  be  satisfied\r\n\r\neither with briefing us or the United Kingdom chief of\r\n\r\nthe delegation, and thus avoid expenditure. Can we not\r\n\r\ndo  this  now wherever possible? After all  we  are  a\r\n\r\nColony  still and we are in a secondary position  with\r\n\r\nno vote.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our cost of administration is the highest\r\n\r\ncompared with that of any other Asian territory.  Why?\r\n\r\nYes, our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living is high, but  in  comparison  the\r\n\r\nadministration  cost is too high, and that  should  be\r\n\r\ncut down wherever possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to taxation, the Hon. the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  has  said  that the financial  position  is\r\n\r\nsound.  If  so,  why  this  additional  taxation?  The\r\n\r\nincrease  in  tax  on  petrol and  diesel  oil  engine\r\n\r\nvehicles will add to the difficulties and hardships of\r\n\r\nthe masses mostly, as taxis, lorries, buses and so  on\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  put up their fares. Who  will  be  the\r\n\r\nlosers?  It is the masses. They will have to bear  the\r\n\r\nextra  cost, they will have to foot the bill. Besides,\r\n\r\nit  will  harm our entrepot trade too. Your lighterage\r\n\r\nand lorry charges will go up higher. You are making it\r\n\r\nmore  difficult for the entrepot trade because of this\r\n\r\nhigher cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Government, a fraction means nothing. I say a\r\n\r\nfraction, in relation to our 1\u00bd million population, is\r\n\r\nvery  much.  Sir,  I might quote here  a  part  of  an\r\n\r\neditorial of the Singapore Standard:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"When a political party comes into power, it wishes\r\n\r\nto  experiment with its political theories, and in the\r\n\r\ncourse of such experiments the public are made to foot\r\n\r\nthe   bill,  however  unjustified  that  may  be.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment must remember that Singapore must  be  able\r\n\r\nto  earn enough to meet its expenditure, since  it  is\r\n\r\nnot   a   producing  territory.  Therefore,  political\r\n\r\nexperiments must not destroy world confidence in  this\r\n\r\nentrepot, thereby affecting its trade and prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe  most  capable  of  Financial  Secretaries  cannot\r\n\r\nperform   miracles   if  the  Government's   political\r\n\r\nexperiments  were  to drive away trade  and  kill  the\r\n\r\nsources of revenue.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The best thing is\r\n\r\nto  spend  as little as possible. No doubt  essentials\r\n\r\nlike  education  and health should be fully  supported\r\n\r\nbut  capital  costs  certainly can  be  reduced.  Sir,\r\n\r\ncompare the population of two or three years back with\r\n\r\nthat of today.

I consider that this work  is\r\n\r\nmore  or less routine and nothing else. Every year  at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  November we come here and are  asked  to\r\n\r\napprove   the   Budget  produced  by  the  Government.\r\n\r\nWhatever amendments moved by the Opposition will serve\r\n\r\nno  purpose.  I  have this morning received  about  60\r\n\r\namendments to the Budget, Sir, but I doubt how many of\r\n\r\nthem,  or  any  at all, will go through.  It  is  most\r\n\r\nunlikely because every time when a vote is put to  the\r\n\r\nHouse, the  Government  has the  majority,  with  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of the ex-officios and Nominated Assemblymen.\r\n\r\nI   may  then,  Sir,  call  elected  Members  of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition as rubber stamps and nothing else. We  come\r\n\r\nhere  just to put our signatures to the Budget because\r\n\r\nwe  are part and parcel of that Budget as well. We are\r\n\r\npartly responsible for its approval.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year the Hon. the Financial Secretary\r\n\r\npresented us with Estimates which showed a deficit  of\r\n\r\n$18.7  million. What is the result of that deficit  of\r\n\r\n$18.7  million, Sir? May I quote column  2824  of  the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary's speech:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Turning now to expenditure, it will be remembered\r\n\r\nthat  the original estimate was $254 million,  and  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  seen  from  pages 15 and  16  of  the  Draft\r\n\r\nEstimates that it is likely that actual expenditure in\r\n\r\n1957 will amount to about $242 million [only, I add in\r\n\r\nthat  word].  It should be noted, however, that  this\r\n\r\ntotal  includes  a  sum of $9 million  in  respect  of\r\n\r\ncompensation under the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  Scheme [as quoted by the  hon.  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kampong Kapor]. If this sum is excluded - it is,  I\r\n\r\nthink, a fair charge on surplus funds since it will be\r\n\r\nrecouped  by savings on expatriation pay and  passages\r\n\r\nover  a  period of years - what might be called  normal'\r\n\r\nexpenditure  will amount to about $233 million  [only]\r\n\r\nand  there will probably be a small surplus of revenue\r\n\r\nover  actual  normal expenditure at  the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the Financial Secretary, actual\r\n\r\nexpenditure  is only $233 million, that  is  excluding\r\n\r\nthe    $9   million   for   compensation   under   the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation scheme. Now if we add that $9  million,\r\n\r\nit comes up to only $242 million. Taking the $233 into\r\n\r\nconsideration   compared  with  what  was   originally\r\n\r\nestimated  at  $254 million, I now  see  that  we  are\r\n\r\nactually having a surplus of $2 million, rather than a\r\n\r\ndeficit of $18.7 million as estimated by the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary last year.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if we take the $9 million into\r\n\r\nconsideration, we then actually have a deficit of only\r\n\r\n$7  million,  and  not, may I emphasise  again,  $18.7\r\n\r\nmillion. Sir, if we compare this figure quoted by ,the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary with the $7 million, I  may  call\r\n\r\nhis  figure a fictitious one. The budget for next year\r\n\r\nshows a substantial deficit of $35 million. Where  can\r\n\r\nwe get that money, Sir? I wonder whether the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  will, when he comes before this House  next\r\n\r\nyear, say that the result will again be a surplus? May\r\n\r\nI  quote what he has got to say, expecting that he may\r\n\r\nsay that by next year, in col. 2830:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The position therefore is that the estimate of\r\n\r\nrevenue  is  $242 million, the estimate of expenditure\r\n\r\nis  $277  million, and we are faced with an  estimated\r\n\r\ndeficit of $35 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is what would this deficit be in the\r\n\r\nevent if no steps were taken to eliminate it. We  know\r\n\r\nthat,  in the past, expenditure has invariably  fallen\r\n\r\nshort  of  the  estimate and estimated  deficits  have\r\n\r\nturned into substantial surpluses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very substantial surpluses, I may say. Sir, I would\r\n\r\nnot  certainly employ the Financial Secretary  as  the\r\n\r\naccountant  of my firm if earlier he had  predicted  a\r\n\r\ndeficit and then at the end of the year I found that I\r\n\r\nhad  a  surplus.  All  these figures  are  just  make-believe, just to misguide us -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

These  figures  are\r\n\r\njust  make-believe, to show us that  there  should  be\r\n\r\nsome  form of taxation or increased taxation in  order\r\n\r\nto meet this deficit of $35 million. Now it so happens\r\n\r\nthat  this  year  the Budget sittings happen  to  take\r\n\r\nplace  during  election month. We will be  having  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council  elections, and it is rather  surprising\r\n\r\nthat the Government has not got the courage to put  up\r\n\r\nmore taxation proposals, as they were expected to  do.\r\n\r\nThey  have  very  carefully chosen only  one  item - one\r\n\r\nsmall item - and that is an increase of only 20 cents  a\r\n\r\ngallon on petrol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M.

How can you expect poor people  to  own\r\n\r\ncars?  But it is rather surprising, Sir, that we  have\r\n\r\nso  many vehicles on the road today. I wonder if every\r\n\r\nowner  of a vehicle that is on the road is in  fact  a\r\n\r\nrich  man. Does the Government know that most  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment clerks also own cars? Are they rich  people\r\n\r\nor are they working class people earning a few hundred\r\n\r\ndollars  a  month?  I  leave  that  to  the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary to answer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Secretary in his speech also said that\r\n\r\nthis  small  increase of 20 cents a gallon  on  petrol\r\n\r\nwill not affect the ordinary people at all. As I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  it will only affect the rich. I will quote  his\r\n\r\nspeech again, Sir, in col. 2831.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This rate of $1 a gallon has been in force in the\r\n\r\nFederation  since  November  of  last  year  and   its\r\n\r\nimposition  is  unlikely  to  cause  any  hardship  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. It has caused none in the Federation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every time the Government has something to say,\r\n\r\n\"Oh,  we  must follow the Federation. We must fall  in\r\n\r\nline  with  the  Federation.\"  Why?  Why  cannot   the\r\n\r\nFederation  for  once follow us rather  than  that  we\r\n\r\nfollow  the Federation? Let us set an example and  let\r\n\r\nthe  Federation follow us for once. I quote again  the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The new rate of duty will result in cars which do\r\n\r\n20  miles to the gallon costing 1 cent a mile more  to\r\n\r\nrun.  Those which do 30 miles to the gallon will  cost\r\n\r\n2/3rd  of  a cent a mile more to run, those  doing  40\r\n\r\nmiles  to  the gallon, \u00bd a cent more, and  so  on.  If\r\n\r\n1,000 miles a month, or 30 miles a day, is taken as  a\r\n\r\nfair  average  mileage for private cars in  Singapore.\r\n\r\ncars  doing 20 miles per gallon will cost $10 a  month\r\n\r\nmore to run, . . . These additional sums can be of no\r\n\r\nconsequence to people who can afford to run  cars  for\r\n\r\npleasure...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what about those who cannot afford to run cars\r\n\r\nfor  pleasure?  What  about  the  clerks  working   in\r\n\r\nGovernment offices, Sir? They do not own cars for  the\r\n\r\nsake  of  running them for pleasure. They own cars  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can  go to work. I quote  again  from  the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary's speech:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Nor will the increase in duty be of much\r\n\r\nconsequence  to haulers. A round trip to  Penang  will\r\n\r\ncost  about $10 more. I do not think that the increase\r\n\r\nin  duty  will affect consumption. The number  of  new\r\n\r\ncars, and the total number of cars registered, tend to\r\n\r\nincrease  each  year  and the  consumption  of  petrol\r\n\r\nincreases  accordingly. I doubt if the  increase  will\r\n\r\ntend to make people use their cars less than they have\r\n\r\ndone in the past.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will certainly try to take shortcuts or walk, if\r\n\r\npossible,  so  as to economise on petrol  consumption.\r\n\r\nBut  if I do not, Sir, it is going to cost me $10 more\r\n\r\na  month.  Is my employer going to pay me $10  more  a\r\n\r\nmonth?  I do not know where to get the extra  $10.  My\r\n\r\nincome  will be the same as it is now. Where  can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  expect  me  to get that  extra  $10?  Beg,\r\n\r\nborrow or steal? Is the Government trying to encourage\r\n\r\ncar  owners to try and beg, borrow or steal to get the\r\n\r\nextra  $10  a month? I leave it again to the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1956 Budget the petrol tax was increased by 5\r\n\r\ncents.  That  was  a very small figure.  In  the  1957\r\n\r\nBudget  the  Government said they had to increase  the\r\n\r\npetrol tax again by another\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7  cents,  just to meet the deficit. Now in  the  1958\r\n\r\nBudget  all of a sudden there is a jump of  20  cents.\r\n\r\nWhat will be the fate of the car owners then when  the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary puts up his 1959 Budget? Will  the\r\n\r\npetrol  tax  go up by another 40 or 50 cents  or  even\r\n\r\nmore? The Financial Secretary might bear in mind  that\r\n\r\na  Member of the Assembly has suggested an increase of\r\n\r\n50 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has also increased the tax on\r\n\r\nheavy  oil  engine vehicles, and again  the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary has said that this will not affect  anybody.\r\n\r\nWill  that not affect the bus companies? Not  the  car\r\n\r\nowners,  but  the  bus companies? Now  who  travel  in\r\n\r\nbuses? Do the rich travel in buses? Are the owners  of\r\n\r\nbus   companies  in  the  least  worried  about   this\r\n\r\nincrease? I doubt they are. Whatever increase  in  tax\r\n\r\nthey  have  to pay will ultimately fall  back  on  the\r\n\r\npeople  that  travel  in  their  buses.  If  the   bus\r\n\r\ncompanies find that their budget cannot balance,  they\r\n\r\nwill  certainly  put  up  their  fares  to  meet   the\r\n\r\nincreased  expenses. Ultimately it will all come  back\r\n\r\nto  those  who travel in buses. It is more or  less  a\r\n\r\nmerry-go-round. As the Member for Kampong Kapor  said,\r\n\r\nit is like robbing Peter to pay Paul. I think that was\r\n\r\nthe phrase he used. It goes round and round.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer, who is a businessman, has\r\n\r\nsaid that we should have some stability in the country\r\n\r\nrather  than an increase of taxation. Let us encourage\r\n\r\nnew industries. The Minister for Commerce and Industry\r\n\r\nhas  always tried to encourage more industries. He has\r\n\r\nsaid that quite a number of small industries have been\r\n\r\nestablished  during this year. That  might  have  been\r\n\r\ncorrect, but the Member for Kampong Kapor has  pointed\r\n\r\nout  that many big companies have closed down. I think\r\n\r\nhe  has quoted a figure of about 4,000 people who have\r\n\r\nlost  their employment. Is that stability? I doubt  it\r\n\r\nis.  Now let us encourage local industries so that  we\r\n\r\ncan  buy  local goods and we can have more  employment\r\n\r\nfor our own people here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next comment I wish to make on the Budget is the\r\n\r\ncreation of new posts. I went through the whole  Draft\r\n\r\nEstimates - it  is so thick - and to my surprise  I  found\r\n\r\nmore than 1,300 new posts being created for next year.\r\n\r\nNow  is  this  necessary? As I again went  through  it\r\n\r\ncarefully  I  found  most of  the  posts  overlap  one\r\n\r\nanother.  Is  that necessary, Sir? Cannot  we  try  to\r\n\r\neconomise on the money that will be spent on these new\r\n\r\nposts?   It  is  rather  surprising,  Sir,  that   the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary in his speech gave no word at  all\r\n\r\nabout  the  creation of new posts which will  increase\r\n\r\ngovernment  expenditure. He  never  told  us  anything\r\n\r\nabout  it. That is one of the reasons for the deficit.\r\n\r\nThe Financial Secretary does not bother to mention the\r\n\r\n1,300 new posts at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr T. M.

But  what  I\r\n\r\nmay  say,  Sir,  on  this subject  of  stability,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has not taken steps to prevent riots  and,\r\n\r\nas  has been mentioned by an hon. Member, kidnappings,\r\n\r\nextortion,  burglaries and so  on.  In  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nStandard  I find almost every day that they publish  a\r\n\r\nspecial   column  on  the  first  page   showing   the\r\n\r\nkidnappings,  thefts  and other crimes  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSir, where is the stability? Where is the security for\r\n\r\nthe people? If we are going to vote for more money, we\r\n\r\nmust have some form of security in return. If there is\r\n\r\nno  security,  why should we vote for more  money  for\r\n\r\nnext  year? As law abiding citizens, I am sure all  of\r\n\r\nus  expect to have freedom of movement either  in  the\r\n\r\nday  or  at  night. But as it stands, I know  quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  people who are not prepared to go  out  at\r\n\r\nnight,  because  they are afraid of  being  kidnapped.\r\n\r\nThen where is the security to the people? We must have\r\n\r\nlaw and order. Unless we have law and order, there  is\r\n\r\nno   stability  at  all.  The  Government   introduced\r\n\r\n\"Operation  Dagger\" sometime ago, and  I  wonder  what\r\n\r\nhappened  to  that operation. No news has  been  heard\r\n\r\nabout it but I understand that it is still continuing.\r\n\r\nWhether  it is really continuing is left to  be  seen.\r\n\r\nNow if we have security, then we will achieve our goal\r\n\r\nof having control over our internal security and self-government  will  come much earlier.  Unless  we  have\r\n\r\ninternal  security,  I  doubt if  we  can  have  self-government;  and  if  we cannot have  self-government,\r\n\r\nwhen can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  gain  independence?  So  let  the  Government  pay\r\n\r\nparticular  attention to this question of security  so\r\n\r\nthat we can have our independence. At the moment, Sir,\r\n\r\nunder  the  Defence and Security Council,  we  have  a\r\n\r\nMember from the Federation presiding over us. In  that\r\n\r\nCouncil  his casting vote will decide the  destiny  of\r\n\r\nthis  country. It is not we Singaporeans  who  are  to\r\n\r\ndecide  the destiny of our country. It is the  casting\r\n\r\nvote  of  a  Member of the Federation, and  he  is  an\r\n\r\noutsider  who has nothing to do with us;  or,  as  the\r\n\r\nTunku  said,  \"We  do  not  want  you  at  all.\"   The\r\n\r\nFederation  does  not want us. Why should  we  have  a\r\n\r\nMember of the Federation to preside over this Council?\r\n\r\nIf  Government can provide security, then  we  do  not\r\n\r\nneed him at all and we will have our own people on the\r\n\r\nDefence and Security Council. Let us then look forward\r\n\r\nto self-government and independence. Majula Singapura!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.00 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I had not\r\n\r\nintended to speak so early in the debate, but  I  fear\r\n\r\nthat if I had to sit through another two hours of this\r\n\r\nminor heckling, we might all go nuts before the debate\r\n\r\nis  over. Quite frankly, Mr Speaker, Sir, I  used  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  when  we met the mobs  we  talked  more\r\n\r\nnonsense than when we met the legislators. After  this\r\n\r\nmorning's  debate  I have decided that  we  talk  more\r\n\r\nsense  when  we meet the mobs than when  we  meet  the\r\n\r\nlegislators of Singapore. I do not propose to touch on\r\n\r\nthe  remarks made by Members who sit on the same  side\r\n\r\nof  the House as I do, because their approach to  this\r\n\r\nproblem has nothing in common with ours.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the last Labour Front\r\n\r\nBudget  and  I think that it should not be allowed  to\r\n\r\npass  unnoticed. I remember the first Budget  when  it\r\n\r\ncame in with all the pomp and fury which we have since\r\n\r\nlearnt  to  associate with the ex-Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nand the ex-Chief Minister. However, all that grandiose\r\n\r\ntalk  has left the Labour Front and this Party is  now\r\n\r\nleft  only with the tarnished gilt with which  it  was\r\n\r\nonce adorned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. is in a quandary regarding this Budget.\r\n\r\nThough we have no love for the Labour Front, we should\r\n\r\nhate to see the Liberal-Socialist Party beat it at the\r\n\r\npolls.  It is therefore our duty to see that, whatever\r\n\r\nthe  weaknesses and deficiencies of the  Labour  Front\r\n\r\nCoalition  Government,  it  should  not  result  in  a\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialist victory at the City Council polls on\r\n\r\n21st December, because we have been throwing stones at\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that has decided us to take a much more matter-of-fact approach to this Budget. It could have been\r\n\r\nworse.  After  all, petrol has gone up  20  cents  and\r\n\r\nnobody is going to be better off. The chances are that\r\n\r\nnobody  is  going  to be much worse  off,  except  the\r\n\r\npirate taxi, drivers who will be seeing the Member for\r\n\r\nKampong Kapor, and the licensed taxi drivers who  will\r\n\r\ncome  and see the P.A.P., and we might have to  change\r\n\r\nthe  taxi meters. Instead of 40 cents showing  on  the\r\n\r\nmeter  when the flag comes down, we might have to  put\r\n\r\nit  up to 50 cents.

If  that  department\r\n\r\ncannot spend it, then let it say in the remarks column\r\n\r\nthat this was an amount which would have been budgeted\r\n\r\nfor  if  it  could have spent it, but as it could  not\r\n\r\nspend  it,  it  was therefore not budgeting  for  this\r\n\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1957 Budget estimate for revenue was $235.9\r\n\r\nmillion.  The  actual revenue is now  expected  to  be\r\n\r\n$235.7.  There  is  quite a drop  in  the  Income  Tax\r\n\r\ncollection  although there have  been  some  gains  in\r\n\r\nother   directions.  The  1957  Budget  estimate   for\r\n\r\nexpenditure   was  $254  million,   but   the   actual\r\n\r\nexpenditure is $241 million, including $9 million  for\r\n\r\nabolition terms to expatriates. In other words, if  we\r\n\r\nknock off the $9 million to expatriates, which was not\r\n\r\nbudgeted  for  in the 1957 Budget, then we  have  $232\r\n\r\nmillion, i.e.  $22 million short in expenditure.  The 1958 Budget estimate for expenditure is $277 million,\r\n\r\ni.e. a rise of $23 million on last year's estimate  of\r\n\r\n$254  million. Then this very glib, this real  sleight\r\n\r\nof hand on page- \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon.

He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"There is no formula which indicates what actual\r\n\r\nexpenditure will be. We make our estimate in the light\r\n\r\nof  past experience and results and anticipated future\r\n\r\nrequirements and capacity. We know that, for the  past\r\n\r\ntwo years, actual recurrent expenditure has tended  to\r\n\r\nincrease on the average by about $18 million  a  year.\r\n\r\nIn  this connection, I invite attention to the  tables\r\n\r\nwhich  were  given in the Memorandum which accompanied\r\n\r\nthe Draft Estimates. It seems likely that this rate of\r\n\r\nincrease  will be maintained in 1958. If  that  should\r\n\r\nprove  to  be the case, actual expenditure,  excluding\r\n\r\nany  compensation  in respect of Malayanisation  which\r\n\r\nmay  have to be brought to account, should be  of  the\r\n\r\norder of $250 million.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, having gone to the trouble of\r\n\r\nworking  out  the  estimate  for  each  item  in  this\r\n\r\nvoluminous Budget, he says, \"Well, actually  all  this\r\n\r\nis a lot of rubbish. Do not believe it. The way we are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  budget  is this: last year  we  spent  $241\r\n\r\nmillion - never mind about what we said we were going to\r\n\r\nspend - we spent $241 million. From our past experience,\r\n\r\nnot based on any length of time, but based on the last\r\n\r\ntwo   years,  we  found  that  expenditure   kept   on\r\n\r\nincreasing by $18 million a year. In 1955 and 1956  it\r\n\r\nwent up by a few million dollars; in 1957 and 1958  it\r\n\r\nwent up by $18 million. So let us forget all about it.\r\n\r\nIt  is all rubbish. Plus another $18 million, that  is\r\n\r\nthe  way to work out the Budget - $241 million plus $18\r\n\r\nmillion. But knock off $9 million first, that makes it\r\n\r\n$232  million.  Then  plus $18 million.  That  is  the\r\n\r\nfigure  we  should have budgeted for.\" Sir,  then  why\r\n\r\npresent  it?  Why  are  we  not  told  that  for  each\r\n\r\nindividual   item  we  are  going  to   approve   this\r\n\r\nexpenditure?  Let  this be said honestly  and  plainly\r\n\r\nagainst  each individual item, if this is supposed  to\r\n\r\nbe  a  serious Budget: \"This is what we hope to spend.\r\n\r\nOur  intentions  are  good  intentions.  This  is  our\r\n\r\ncapacity.\" And then we will know what we are  passing.\r\n\r\nAs  it is, we have all these good intentions here  and\r\n\r\nthe  Financial Secretary has the audacity to  come  to\r\n\r\nthis  House and say, \"Well, I do not know how all this\r\n\r\nis  going  to work out. I take last year's  figure  of\r\n\r\n$241  million, minus $9 million for expatriates, which\r\n\r\nreally should not be in the Budget. It is one of those\r\n\r\nsudden  capital losses which we will have to bear.  So\r\n\r\nit  is $232 million plus $18 million - $250 million. The\r\n\r\nrevenue,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  it goes on unchanged, and if none of the rates  of\r\n\r\ntaxation  change,  will be $242  million.  Therefore,\"\r\n\r\nsays  the Financial Secretary, \"let us find where  the\r\n\r\n$8  million  is  going  to come  from.\"  I  quote  the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If that should prove to be the case, actual\r\n\r\nexpenditure, excluding any compensation in respect  of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  which  may have  to  be  brought  into\r\n\r\naccount,  should be of the order of $250  million.  In\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances,  assuming  that  the  estimate  of\r\n\r\nrevenue  is  achieved, it is possible that the  actual\r\n\r\ndeficit  would  be of the order of $8  million,\"-  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and these are the operative words\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>\"and  it is this sum which we must endeavour to cover\r\n\r\nby means of additional taxation.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not a rebuke to the Labour Front\r\n\r\nMinisters  or  of  the U.M.N.O. Minister.  We  do  not\r\n\r\nexpect  them  to come into power and bring  their  own\r\n\r\napparatus  of  state with them. The democratic  system\r\n\r\ndoes  not work that way. Political Parties compete  on\r\n\r\npolitical   policy,  not  on  the   effectiveness   of\r\n\r\npolitical bureaucracy. What is alarming is that we may\r\n\r\nbe saddled with a machinery of state which cannot tell\r\n\r\nus  at the end of each year what exactly happened last\r\n\r\nyear  and  what we can do for next year. The Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary -  next  year it will  be  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance elected by the people - will have to come  again\r\n\r\nto  this  House  and say, \"Well, gentlemen....\".\r\n\r\nHaving  heard  some of the speeches  this  morning,  I\r\n\r\nthink  \"gentlemen\" is to too kind a word. But if  next\r\n\r\nyear  we have the same kind of legislators as we  have\r\n\r\nhad in the last two years, then I say they deserve the\r\n\r\nkind  of figures they will again get next year.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  see how, unless we have a real shake, up  in  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service  administration,  we  can  improve  the\r\n\r\nsituation.  The instruments of policy  are  blunt  and\r\n\r\nineffective,  and  whoever has to  use  them  must  be\r\n\r\ndismayed at the prospect of not being able to  sharpen\r\n\r\nthem  in  the  space of time that is left for  popular\r\n\r\ndemocracy to operate effectively in this part  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.  We view the position in South-east Asia  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.   I   would   like  Members  of   this   House,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the Member for Queenstown - he  reads  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Standard (I myself never read that rag)  but\r\n\r\nnevertheless if he wants to torment himself by reading\r\n\r\nit  every  morning,  especially  the  thefts  and  the\r\n\r\nkidnapping column, then let\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhim  do  so. But I would like him to look at  what  is\r\n\r\nhappening in some other parts of the world. We have to\r\n\r\nview  our  position from the context of the  whole  of\r\n\r\nSouth-east Asia. We want to escape the fate  that  has\r\n\r\nbefallen  some  of the other countries  in  South-east\r\n\r\nAsia,  because  they  also  took  over  from  colonial\r\n\r\nregimes  which were effete and ineffective  and  which\r\n\r\npacked up because they were effete and ineffective. So\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  consider seriously how we are  going  to\r\n\r\nsharpen  those instruments of policy, because  whoever\r\n\r\ncomes   in   will  have  to  work  through  the   same\r\n\r\nbureaucratic  machinery. Without  any  slight  at  our\r\n\r\nnewly-promoted   Permanent   Secretaries,   let   them\r\n\r\nremember  this: that their pensions and  their  future\r\n\r\ndepend   upon  the  bureaucracy  being  an   effective\r\n\r\nbureaucracy. If it is not an effective bureaucracy, it\r\n\r\nis  not just the politicians who will be going.  They,\r\n\r\nthe Permanent Secretaries, themselves will also go  to\r\n\r\nthe  limbo of all forgotten men, and the whole society\r\n\r\nwill  be  swept away and a new dictatorship will  take\r\n\r\nits place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot allow this Budget to go without making\r\n\r\nsome  reference to the expatriates. They are  a  much-abused and maligned group of people, but I think  they\r\n\r\ndeserve  every bit of the abuse that has  been  heaped\r\n\r\nupon  them.  But  today I do not intend  to  join  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Kampong Kapor - I have a  sneaking  feeling\r\n\r\nthat   somebody   else  wrote  his  speech   for   him\r\n\r\n[Interruption]. I am quite sure the P.A.P. would  not\r\n\r\nbe involved in such a nefarious scheme as to write the\r\n\r\nspeech  for the Member for Kampong Kapor. We say  what\r\n\r\nwe  think openly and frankly. We do not seek  to  hide\r\n\r\nour  views  under the cover of the Member for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKapor.  But  I would like to have this thrown  at  the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary. He said last year they spent - this\r\n\r\nis  another  one  of those glib things - $9  million  on\r\n\r\nexpatriate compensation. \"It is well worth  it.  There\r\n\r\nwill  be savings in allowances and all kinds of things\r\n\r\nwhen  we  get rid of the expatriates.\" Now they  agree\r\n\r\nwith  us  that there will be savings. But the rate  of\r\n\r\ncompensation and the rate of savings - let us work  them\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$9 million was paid out last year. The expatriate\r\n\r\nallowance budgeted for the next year is $1.04 million.\r\n\r\nThis year it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis $1.42. In other words, the saving is $0.38 million,\r\n\r\ni.e. $380,000. It looks as if it will take 30 years to\r\n\r\nrecover this $9 million. When I was talking about this\r\n\r\nto  an  accountant, he said, \"Ah, yes, but you  cannot\r\n\r\nhave $9 million and not pay interest.\" Now, if we  add\r\n\r\ninterest and we calculate the interest running  on  $9\r\n\r\nmillion - I  will not go through the laborious  counting\r\n\r\nprocess - I am told the $9 million will not be recovered\r\n\r\nin less than a generation. So $9 million has gone down\r\n\r\nthe  drain and we are saving $380,000 a year.  We  are\r\n\r\nnot likely to recover in one generation the $9 million\r\n\r\nif  we  have to pay interest, as we have to, according\r\n\r\nto the accountant.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$21 million - that is the total we have to pay for\r\n\r\nMalayanisation. If $21 million were paid out all of  a\r\n\r\nsudden,  then  we  would have to wait  till  the  next\r\n\r\ncentury  to  recover it at the rate we are  recovering\r\n\r\nthe  $9  million. Something has gone wrong  somewhere.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the gloomiest prospect of them all which  we\r\n\r\nwill have to consider one of these days; doing to  the\r\n\r\nChartered  Bank and Hong Kong and Shanghai  Bank  what\r\n\r\nthey have been doing in Djakarta, and that is to put a\r\n\r\nbanner  up at these two establishments and say, \"Taken\r\n\r\nover  by  the people of Singapore in order to pay  for\r\n\r\nthe   compensation  terms  that   we   paid   to   the\r\n\r\nexpatriates.\" Because $21 million plus interest - to  be\r\n\r\nrecovered  at  the rate of $380,000 on $9 million - will\r\n\r\ntake  two  centuries to recover. The right way  to  do\r\n\r\nthis is to write the whole thing off. But, however,  I\r\n\r\ndo not want to alarm any foreign capital away because-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P.

Sir, no one is more conscious\r\n\r\nthan the P.A.P. of the limitations on fiscal policy in\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  a result of the peculiar  economic  and\r\n\r\npolitical   situation  of  Singapore   vis-a-vis   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya. To those in the Federation  who\r\n\r\nare  not so conversant with political leaders  or  so-called  political  heroes in Singapore  and  political\r\n\r\nstars,  let  me say this: what was said by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown  is not what the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nsay. If the Member for Queenstown does not believe it,\r\n\r\nthen  I  will  invite him to attend  the  next  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nrally - he  is  not  here, but nevertheless  let  it  be\r\n\r\nconveyed  to him that the people of Singapore  do  not\r\n\r\nshare his opinion. It is because of the stupidity  and\r\n\r\nthe  irresponsibility  of opportunist  politicians  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  that,  from time to time, silly  statements\r\n\r\nare made which not only do themselves a lot of harm - we\r\n\r\nlike  to  see  them  heap  more  and  more  harm   and\r\n\r\nhumiliation upon themselves - but which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmight  adversely  affect temper  and  feeling  between\r\n\r\nlarge  groups  of people who may not be aware  of  the\r\n\r\nunworthiness  of  the source of these  statements.  We\r\n\r\nunderstand  these  limitations on  fiscal  policy  and\r\n\r\ntherefore I do not wish to ask awkward questions like,\r\n\r\n\"Why  was  not company tax put up to recover  this  $8\r\n\r\nmillion deficit? Why on petrol? But, anyway, it has to\r\n\r\nbe  done on petrol, but why not company tax first? Why\r\n\r\nnot income tax, why not a lot of other things?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we were further alarmed at the light-hearted\r\n\r\nway  in which the Financial Secretary said, \"Oh, well,\r\n\r\nthe  Income Tax Department has not collected its  full\r\n\r\nquota because it lost a few expert Europeans.\" One  or\r\n\r\ntwo  of  them pocketed a large sum of money  and  then\r\n\r\nswitched  round to the Telephone Board and climbed  on\r\n\r\nto  another  cushy  and  comfortable  job.  All  these\r\n\r\npersonal  things aside, we do not understand why  only\r\n\r\n$65  million is expected to be collected next year.  I\r\n\r\nam not an expert on Income Tax figures, Sir, but I put\r\n\r\nforward  this  proposition as one which is  sound  and\r\n\r\nreasonable  and  one  which  I  think  merits  serious\r\n\r\nconsideration in this House. Everybody knows that  tax\r\n\r\nevasion  goes  on  everywhere in the world.  In  fact.\r\n\r\ngreat  democracies like America, when they cannot  get\r\n\r\nkidnappers  for  kidnapping, get them for  income  tax\r\n\r\nevasion.  The  Income Tax people here should  look  up\r\n\r\nthese  things. They might be able to profit  from  the\r\n\r\nAmerican system. If you cannot get our local Al Capone\r\n\r\nfor kidnapping Tan Lark Sye's nephew, then get him for\r\n\r\ndodging the income tax or do something about it.  Here\r\n\r\nare figures which, in my estimation, prove that if  we\r\n\r\nhave a tough and efficient Income Tax Department,  not\r\n\r\nless  than  $100  million should be collected  on  the\r\n\r\npresent  rates.  Sir, the figures  are  quite  useful.\r\n\r\nThere are no less than 12,300 employers-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The way to do it is the way it is done  in  all\r\n\r\ncivilized  countries. If you think that Mr  Goldsmith\r\n\r\nhas  not  been paying his tax, then judging  from  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  cars and the number of diamond  solitaires\r\n\r\nhis wife exhibits, you just put in an estimate of what\r\n\r\nyou think he ought to pay and let him disprove it.  If\r\n\r\nhe  pays  it, next year double the estimate; then  let\r\n\r\nhim  disprove it. If he pays again, quadruple it,  and\r\n\r\nso  we  go on until we make everybody in the community\r\n\r\npay their fair share of taxation or become barrow-boys\r\n\r\nor  hawkers, in which case they do not have to pay any\r\n\r\ntaxes  at all. It might well be, as a result  of  just\r\n\r\nrounding  off this computation, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  at\r\n\r\n12,300  employers, as I said, on the mean  average  of\r\n\r\n$50,000 chargeable profits, that ought to bring $8,630\r\n\r\nper  employer, which means $106,149,000 per year  just\r\n\r\nfrom  employers alone. I could develop this  argument,\r\n\r\nand  I  will, all about this property tax both in  the\r\n\r\ncity  area  and  the Rural Board. But  a  conservative\r\n\r\nestimate  of what could be collected on present  rates\r\n\r\nis  somewhere in the region of $128 million per  year;\r\n\r\nin  other  words, double what the Hon. the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary estimates for next year. The tragedy of  the\r\n\r\nsituation  is this, that although this is what  should\r\n\r\nbe  the  case, what, ever Government comes into  power\r\n\r\nnext  year  it will be saddled with the same apparatus\r\n\r\nwith  which  to  extract the tax.  Unless  we  have  a\r\n\r\nruthless Minister for Finance who will deal with inept\r\n\r\nand  bureaucratic civil servants and will improve  the\r\n\r\nrunning of the machinery of state, we will be back  in\r\n\r\nthe same position.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to wind up, it is only fair to say that the\r\n\r\nBudget  could have been worse.

It has forgotten all the big paper promises. I\r\n\r\nremember  the  first Budget debate when there  was  at\r\n\r\nleast a spirited defence. Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated)\r\n\r\nreminded  the P.A.P. that this was a four-year  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  programme and that it was only  one-quarter  of\r\n\r\nthe  way. Now this is the last year of three years and\r\n\r\nit  has  given  up  trying  to  pretend  that  it  can\r\n\r\nimplement them. It cannot. That is one of the  reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  it  will  be  in the soup in the next  elections,\r\n\r\nbecause it could not implement the programme on  which\r\n\r\nit  got  elected. It said all kinds of foolish  things\r\n\r\nand I hope that all other political Parties and would be politicians will benefit from this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Including you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Indeed I have. I have taken this\r\n\r\nvery  much  into account and the P.A.P. programme  for\r\n\r\nthe  next elections will be a programme which will  be\r\n\r\nimplemented  after the elections. But  there  was  one\r\n\r\npolitician who I see is still running around the place\r\n\r\nlike  a mad dog and he has not learned from all  this;\r\n\r\nhe  has  started a new Party. He wants  to  start  the\r\n\r\nconcertina  all over again - try again with a  big  high\r\n\r\nbid  and wind up once more in the gutter. Sir, I  send\r\n\r\nout   my  formal  condolences  to  the  Labour   Front\r\n\r\nMinisters opposite. Theirs is a very unhappy  position\r\n\r\nand I have to tender to them my formal sympathies. But\r\n\r\nI  hope that they have served a useful purpose if only\r\n\r\nto be an example to all political leaders in Malaya of\r\n\r\nhow  not  to win the elections and how not  to  run  a\r\n\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.35 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is\r\n\r\nquite  unusual in the debate on this important  Budget\r\n\r\nthat,  except for the leader of the P.A.P., the  other\r\n\r\nspeakers are Independents. I must confess that I  have\r\n\r\nnever  listened to the speeches of the leader  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., the Member for Tanjong Pagar, so carefully  as\r\n\r\ntoday.  I  think we must congratulate him in  that  at\r\n\r\nlast, with God's blessing, he realises that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponsibility lies on his shoulders, and  the  advice\r\n\r\nwhich  he  has given to this House I should  recommend\r\n\r\nsincerely to the P.A.P. itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for Members to argue with statistics and\r\n\r\nfigures is, I think, a waste of time. I wish to recall\r\n\r\nthe  remarks and recommendations which I made  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  last year's Budget debate.  We  should\r\n\r\nadopt an old Chinese saying: \"Open more fountains  and\r\n\r\nrestrict  the outflow.\" In other words, we should  try\r\n\r\nto find more sources to collect money and restrict the\r\n\r\nspending  of  money. I do not oppose the principle  of\r\n\r\ntaxation.  I was not surprised at all when the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown (Mr Lee Choon Eng) said that  we  are\r\n\r\ntaxing   the  poor  but  I   am  surprised  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has not the courage to impose new taxes  on\r\n\r\ncompanies, which means taxing the rich. Sir, it  shows\r\n\r\na  lack  of  confidence  in  the  prosperity  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  If this country's prosperity can be assured,\r\n\r\nthen the Hon. the Financial Secretary be the first one\r\n\r\nto try to get money from that source.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not satisfied with the argument which is\r\n\r\nput  up  that the reason why the Government refuse  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  company  tax is because  they  want  to\r\n\r\nattract  foreign investment. Sir, I cannot  deny  that\r\n\r\nthat  is  partly  the reason but  how  can  we  expect\r\n\r\nforeign  investment when we are faced today with  such\r\n\r\ninstability - politically  and socially?  Therefore  the\r\n\r\nfundamental remedy to solve this problem is  to  bring\r\n\r\nstability to this colony. The Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nsaid  that  he  was not playing party politics  but  I\r\n\r\nwould like to point out that even on the first page of\r\n\r\nthis  Budget the phrase \"Colony of Singapore\" appears\r\n\r\nand  the  P.A.P. leader went on to  attack  it  as  a\r\n\r\ncolonial Budget. Yes, it is a colonial Budget. What is\r\n\r\nwrong with that? Such an outlook shows that we are not\r\n\r\napproaching the problem seriously and practically.  He\r\n\r\nstill plays a great part in politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my views are these: first of all, the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  failed  to  increase  company   tax;\r\n\r\nsecondly,  the  Government has  refused  to  heed  the\r\n\r\npublic  demand to increase the parental allowances  on\r\n\r\npersonal  relief. All that shows that  the  future  of\r\n\r\nSingapore is not very bright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, the Member for Queens-town mentioned\r\n\r\nkidnappings  and  extortions in  connection  with  the\r\n\r\nstability  of this country. I wish to add  it  is  not\r\n\r\nonly  the  rich who are affected; pupils, hawkers  and\r\n\r\ndance  hostesses  are in the grip of  gangsters.  They\r\n\r\nmust pay a monthly rate of extortion or protection fee\r\n\r\nto  certain groups of gangsters. So I wonder why, with\r\n\r\nall  the  power  in  his hands,  the  Chief  Secretary\r\n\r\nconsiders  that  the Preservation of  Public  Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance   should  only  apply  to  those   who   are\r\n\r\nsubversive  elements but not to gangsters.  Since  the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the  Citizenship  Bill,  does  the\r\n\r\nBanishment Ordinance still serve any purpose?  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the Chief Secretary and the Government will take\r\n\r\nall  this  into consideration. The stability  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry is in their hands, and if they want to attract\r\n\r\nforeign investment, the stability of society is, first\r\n\r\nand   foremost,   important,  and   not   merely   the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of a low rate of company tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Financial Secretary said that the\r\n\r\ncomplicated education problem has at last been solved.\r\n\r\nSir,  to  me, it is still not solved but only halfway.\r\n\r\nSome days ago I read - I cannot remember which paper  it\r\n\r\nwas - that two parents were arguing in a market. One  of\r\n\r\nthem  asked, \"To which school do you want to send your\r\n\r\nchildren?\" The other one said. \"No, I will not send my\r\n\r\nchildren to any school.\" The former asked, \"Why?\"  The\r\n\r\nanswer  was, \"If I send John to an English school,  he\r\n\r\nis  bound to be a delinquent. If I send Mary to a high\r\n\r\nschool,  she  is  going  to be a subversive  element.\"\r\n\r\nThat, of course, cannot be a true picture, but if that\r\n\r\nis  part  of  public opinion, then it shows  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  have no faith and have lost confidence in  our\r\n\r\neducation system for which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  provide and spend so much money. Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Minister for Education to consider  this\r\n\r\nquestion: how is he going to solve the problem of  the\r\n\r\nover-age  students who are thrown out from Standard  V\r\n\r\nand  the  many more we expect from the Chinese  Junior\r\n\r\nmiddle schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

All of us have to work under\r\n\r\nthe  constitution and the constitution, whether it  is\r\n\r\nthe  Rendel Constitution or the one which is proposed,\r\n\r\nclearly states that defence is solely in the hands  of\r\n\r\nthe  British  Government. Yet we are  now  to  have  a\r\n\r\nbattalion  and a navy. Sir, I would like to  ask  this\r\n\r\nquestion. Is it necessary, in this new age of sputniks\r\n\r\nand the hydrogen bomb, to be talking about defence  in\r\n\r\nthe   form  of  creating  new  battalions,  purchasing\r\n\r\nminesweepers and bolstering up our military forces  to\r\n\r\nprotect our soil? Sir, I want to ask another question.\r\n\r\nIs  there anyone in this House who opposes or does hot\r\n\r\nbelieve   in   the  stand  taken  at  the   Afro-Asian\r\n\r\nConference  held  in  Bandung that Afro-Asian  nations\r\n\r\nshould  unite into a solid front and should  stop  and\r\n\r\noppose  any form of war through the banning of nuclear\r\n\r\nweapons?  Therefore  from which prospective  enemy  of\r\n\r\nthis  country  can  we  expect an  attack?  With  full\r\n\r\nconfidence and full support in a lasting peace for the\r\n\r\nwhole  world, there is then no necessity for  building\r\n\r\nup  a  defence force to defend our territory. That  is\r\n\r\nthe first argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second argument is: for whom is this defence\r\n\r\nnecessary? We cannot deny that we are a chain  in  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Commonwealth defence strategy.

It is a subject on which the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Financial Secretary was  almost  completely\r\n\r\nsilent,  as  might be expected, as he could  have  had\r\n\r\nnothing  good to say. The only reference he  did  make\r\n\r\nwas  indirectly  through the  mention  of  income  tax\r\n\r\nreturns:  $68  million  was  collected  in  1956;  $65\r\n\r\nmillion  is  the  anticipated sum for  1957,  and  the\r\n\r\namount budgeted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  in  1958 is again $65 million, despite  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  personal income tax was increased last year from\r\n\r\n30  per  cent  to 40 per cent. Those,  I  submit,  are\r\n\r\nconfessions  of  failure by the Government  to  expand\r\n\r\nindustry because if industry had expanded, it would be\r\n\r\nreflected in income tax revenues. But there are  other\r\n\r\nbarometers  to indicate this. While our population  is\r\n\r\nincreasing  by 50,000 a year from 940,000 in  1947  to\r\n\r\n1,463,000  estimated in 1957, the number of  labourers\r\n\r\nemployed in manufacturing dropped from 57,332 in March\r\n\r\n1956  to  55,011  in March 1957 and in all  industries\r\n\r\nfrom 124,645 to 123,263 in the same period. Since  the\r\n\r\ngeneral elections, 125,000 roughly have been added  to\r\n\r\nthe population, and yet less are employed in industry.\r\n\r\nThat   is   the   Government's  record.  In   existing\r\n\r\nindustries, to take only two examples, the manufacture\r\n\r\nof  biscuits  has dropped from 196,000  cwt, for  the\r\n\r\nperiod  January to September 1956 to 136,000 cwt, for\r\n\r\nthe  same  period in this year. Production  of  rubber\r\n\r\nsheeting has dropped from 277,000 lbs, from January to\r\n\r\nSeptember 1954 to 112,000 last year and 79,000 for the\r\n\r\nsame  period in this year - a drop of something like  60\r\n\r\nper  cent.  I  mention these points  in  view  of  the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary's  statement  that  an  excellent\r\n\r\nunderstanding  had  been reached with  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  that  there  has  been  a  return  of\r\n\r\nconfidence   in   the   future  of   Singapore-unusual\r\n\r\nexaggeration   for   a   usually  cautious   Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  make. The fact of the  matter  is  that\r\n\r\nhardly   a   single  new  major  industry   has   been\r\n\r\nestablished and developed in Singapore in the  2\u00bd years\r\n\r\nof  the Government's life; hardly a single big factory\r\n\r\nof any consequence has been opened. When questioned in\r\n\r\nthis House or by newspaper reporters, the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommerce  and  Industry has always hinted mysteriously\r\n\r\nat  large  developments impending and behind-the-scene\r\n\r\nnegotiations  with  large  industrial  concerns  which\r\n\r\ncannot be disclosed, but nothing concrete has emerged.\r\n\r\nIn the Governor's speech on 22nd April, 1955, when the\r\n\r\npresent Government first announced its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicy, it was stated that it would be \"the policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government to encourage in all practical ways the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of local industries\". On 29th June of  the\r\n\r\nsame year, I asked:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"What plans the Government has in view for the\r\n\r\ncarrying out of its declared aim of attracting private\r\n\r\ncapital from both local and overseas investors for the\r\n\r\npurpose of expanding trade and industry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I obtained from the Minister the reply:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...assistance in the industrial and commercial\r\n\r\nfields  is  taking the form of attention to individual\r\n\r\napplications on their merits...\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>an extremely nebulous answer. In November 1955, in the\r\n\r\ndebate  on  the  Second Reading of  the  Appropriation\r\n\r\nBill - two years ago - I said that I had hoped in vain  to\r\n\r\nhear that the Government-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"will  carry  out its declared policy  of  encouraging\r\n\r\ninvestment,  both locally and from overseas,  by  such\r\n\r\nmethods  as allowing income tax relief's, both initial\r\n\r\nand  annual,  on the cost of factory construction  and\r\n\r\ninitial plant and ensuring that such construction goes\r\n\r\nahead with the least possible administrative delay.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

That  is  the  sort  of\r\n\r\nannouncement   expected   of   run-of-the-mill   civil\r\n\r\nservants  trained  in  caution and  the  avoidance  of\r\n\r\ndecisions,  not  the  trumpet blast  of  the  Minister\r\n\r\ndetermined   to   tackle  with   energy,   drive   and\r\n\r\nimagination one of the most urgent problems  affecting\r\n\r\nthis country's welfare. But the Government machine  is\r\n\r\ntired  and  worn  out;  it never  had  much  drive  or\r\n\r\nefficiency  but now it has run down and lost  so  much\r\n\r\nconfidence  in itself that some of the Ministers  have\r\n\r\nto go off on various pretexts to Tokyo or Delhi, while\r\n\r\nthose  who remained behind threw themselves  into  the\r\n\r\narms of the P.A.P. to get them to fight their election\r\n\r\nbattles  for them. And so, Sir, there is no sign  from\r\n\r\nthe Financial Secretary's speech or from the Estimates\r\n\r\nof  any  sign of improvement on the industrial horizon\r\n\r\nduring the life of the present Government, nor have we\r\n\r\nfound,  in  turning the pages of the  Estimates,  that\r\n\r\nthere  is any sign of important decisions in any other\r\n\r\ndirection.  Commissions and experts  have  come,  made\r\n\r\ntheir reports and gone at enormous public expense, but\r\n\r\nnothing  has  been  implemented.  The  unified  public\r\n\r\ntransport system, free legal aid, minimum standards of\r\n\r\nliving,   Singapore's  port,  television,  a   housing\r\n\r\nauthority,  the drive against tuberculosis,  a  public\r\n\r\ncorporation  for  broadcasting,  the  results   of   a\r\n\r\nCommission  to investigate corruption - all  these  are\r\n\r\nempty  promises or paper proposals or recommendations,\r\n\r\nand  nothing  is done. The Minister for Communications\r\n\r\nand Works in weary cynicism has said that he no longer\r\n\r\ntrusts  experts because experts always differ. So  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  which  is  barren  of  ideas  of  its  own\r\n\r\nmistrusts  the  ideas which it pays highly  at  public\r\n\r\nexpense  for  experts to supply.  An  example  of  the\r\n\r\ninefficiency  of the Government is the fact  that  the\r\n\r\npresent session has been allowed to run on from August\r\n\r\n1956 beyond the usual period of a year to January 1958\r\n\r\npresumably in the hope that something will turn up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government expects bouquets for two reasons.\r\n\r\nFirstly,   it  has  through  a  firm  policy   towards\r\n\r\nsubversive  elements  removed an  immediate  Communist\r\n\r\nthreat  to Singapore. We have supported the Government\r\n\r\nstand but we would remind the opposite side that it is\r\n\r\nonly  a negative policy. While stamping out subversion\r\n\r\non  the  one  hand,  what  has  been  done  to  create\r\n\r\nconditions  which will make Communism impossible?  Not\r\n\r\nonly  do we need more industries for our young people,\r\n\r\nbut  more  secondary and technical education to  train\r\n\r\nthem  for industry, and cheap housing for them to live\r\n\r\nin,  but  what  do  we  find? - employment  in  industry\r\n\r\ndeclining,  as  I  have  already  quoted,   only   one\r\n\r\nsecondary  school or technical school being built  for\r\n\r\nevery three primary schools as the Estimates show,  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  only $20,000 in the grants  for  evening\r\n\r\nclasses which could help to bridge the educational gap\r\n\r\nbetween the primary school and fitness for employment,\r\n\r\nand  the  deplorable failure to build  houses  to  the\r\n\r\nextent that between September 1956 and August 1957 not\r\n\r\none  single S.I.T. housing unit was completed. Sir,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that I must elaborate to a little extent on this\r\n\r\ndeplorable   failure   regarding   housing.   In   the\r\n\r\nGovernor's   speech   on   22nd   April,   1955,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy was stated as follows in column 8,\r\n\r\nVolume 1:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The imperative and pressing need for adequate\r\n\r\nhousing for those in the lower income group, including\r\n\r\nthe  solution of the problem of the attap dwellers and\r\n\r\nthe  clearance of slum areas is a challenge which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  appreciates can only be met  by  the  most\r\n\r\nvigorous and in some cases drastic measures.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Four days later, the Minister for Housing in the first\r\n\r\nflush  of enthusiasm in his first few weeks in  office\r\n\r\nstated, and I quote from column 40 of Volume 1:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\".... it is proposed to tackle the housing problem\r\n\r\nmore  vigorously  and  efficiently  by  setting  up  a\r\n\r\nstatutory  Housing  Authority, solely  responsible  to\r\n\r\nGovernment,   to   replace   the   present   Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust. It is hoped that  such  a  Housing\r\n\r\nAuthority would be able in a comparatively short  time\r\n\r\nto  bridge  the increasing gap between public  housing\r\n\r\nprogrammes and the needs of the people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With what vigour has the housing problem been tackled?\r\n\r\nThe  Minister gave this answer on 21st August of  this\r\n\r\nyear  when  he informed us in reply to a  question  of\r\n\r\nmine that whereas the number\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   applicants  on  the  waiting  list   for   S.I.T.\r\n\r\naccommodation  on  30th June,  1955,  was  9,571,  the\r\n\r\nnumber on 30th June. 1957 was 11,547; no housing units\r\n\r\nhaving  been completed since September 1956.  So  much\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government's vigour - 2,000 more families  on\r\n\r\nthe  waiting list for houses after two years' vigorous\r\n\r\neffort!  And where is the Housing Authority? There  is\r\n\r\nno  sign of it. Let us hear the opinion of a Member of\r\n\r\nthis  House  on  housing given in the  debate  on  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading  of the Appropriation Bill  two  years\r\n\r\nago, appearing in column 1047 of Volume 1:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Housing is a very, very essential social service.\r\n\r\nIt  is  almost  basic in the social service  programme\r\n\r\nbecause,  unless you get your housing  done,  you  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to have a slum population and a slum population\r\n\r\nis  a  political  and  economic liability.  Some  slum\r\n\r\ndwellers  in Singapore - a remarkable number  of  them\r\n\r\nmanage  to  rise above their environment and  maintain\r\n\r\nproper   standards   of  behaviour  and   cleanliness,\r\n\r\ncharacter  formation and so on, but by and large,  the\r\n\r\npressure   of   life  in  the  slum  is   such   that,\r\n\r\nscientifically speaking, it does cause the  population\r\n\r\nto   deteriorate  as  human  material.  You   get   an\r\n\r\nirresponsible,    unemployable, uneducable,    dull,\r\n\r\nbackward, and criminal population which is a permanent\r\n\r\nliability  to  that  part of the population  which  is\r\n\r\nemployable  and  productive and it is  most  important\r\n\r\nthat  you should get rid of your slums as a matter  of\r\n\r\nfirst priority.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the words, Sir, of the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications  and Works - words spoken doubtless  with\r\n\r\ngreat  emotion, but sounding horribly hollow  now.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Government felt really sincerely like  this,  why\r\n\r\nhave they failed so miserably?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we recall with some cynicism paragraph 50 of\r\n\r\nthe  Governor's speech opening this session from  29th\r\n\r\nAugust of last year when it was stated:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government has been gravely concerned by the\r\n\r\ndanger  to  the  public welfare from  gangsters,  from\r\n\r\nsecret  societies,  from  armed  violence,  and   from\r\n\r\ncorruption.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>No  doubt the Government is still gravely concerned in\r\n\r\nits  own  platitudinous way 16 months later, but  what\r\n\r\nhas been done to improve the situation? We see no sign\r\n\r\nof  a vigorous housing policy or educational policy or\r\n\r\nindustrial  policy, all of which would have undermined\r\n\r\nthe disorders, gang-fights, and kidnappings which have\r\n\r\nbecome an almost daily occurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another bouquet which the Government expects is\r\n\r\nregarding the small $8 million gap between revenue and\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  which has to be filled by  taxation.  We\r\n\r\nsubmit  that greater industrial activity, more  vigour\r\n\r\nin  the  Income Tax Department and more vigour in  the\r\n\r\nRural  Board  offices  where  there  is  a  figure  of\r\n\r\nanything up to $3 million in rates to be collected, as\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the Public Accounts Committee discovered,\r\n\r\ncould have bridged this gap without extra taxation  at\r\n\r\nall. If a result of the rise in the higher charges  of\r\n\r\nhaulage  is an increase in the cost of living  because\r\n\r\nof  the  petrol tax and diesel tax going up, then  the\r\n\r\nGovernment must take the blame. At best, the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving  will not drop. The price index for  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  group in September of this year was  319.8  as\r\n\r\nagainst  313.1  in September 1956, 317 in  October  of\r\n\r\nthis  year as against 311.4 in October last year.  The\r\n\r\nprice  of  rice  in October this year  was  $1.54  per\r\n\r\ngantang  against $1.35 a year previously. So much  for\r\n\r\nthe  Government's boast that it has helped to increase\r\n\r\nwages  by ten per cent! This has been swallowed up  in\r\n\r\nthe increased cost of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only bouquet I will permit the Government is\r\n\r\ntheir  realisation, though belated, that economic  co-operation  with  the  Federation  Government  is  more\r\n\r\nimportant  than political co-operation, and  that  the\r\n\r\nsuccess   in   the  former  may  lead   in   time   to\r\n\r\nunderstanding  in  the  latter.  Singapore   and   the\r\n\r\nFederation must operate as one economic unit  and  the\r\n\r\nsooner that is accepted as axiomatic on both sides  of\r\n\r\nthe   Causeway  the  better  chances  there   are   of\r\n\r\nreasonable  prosperity. We hope that this policy  will\r\n\r\nbe pursued with tact and imagination.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion. Sir, I would like to say how heartily\r\n\r\nI  agree with the Hon. the Financial Secretary when he\r\n\r\nsaid in the course of his speech:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is undeniable that there is at the present time\r\n\r\na certain amount of pessimism about the future.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  pessimism will continue so long as  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment  remains in office and leans on the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nfor its survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Since they could not  find\r\n\r\nany  taxation  which they could really  say  would  be\r\n\r\ndetrimental to the poor man-in-the-street, they had no\r\n\r\nother  way but to pick holes in this increase  in  the\r\n\r\npetrol  tax.  However,  Sir, their  reasoning  is  not\r\n\r\naccording to the logic that a normal man would pursue,\r\n\r\nand  I am not going to comment at length on what  they\r\n\r\nsaid  because  their arguments are not of  such  great\r\n\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another English saying, Sir, and that is\r\n\r\nthat  a  little  knowledge is more dangerous  than  no\r\n\r\nknowledge,  and that was proved when the  hon.

But before I comment on his\r\n\r\narguments,  I  would  say that there  are  other  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  who  put  up various other arguments  on  the\r\n\r\nBudget  that  is  before  the  House  today  deserving\r\n\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly glad, Sir, to notice that certain\r\n\r\nmembers of the Liberal-Socialist Party have now fallen\r\n\r\nin  line with the trend of thought which I put to this\r\n\r\nHouse as far back as last year, and that is that  wild\r\n\r\ntalk is detrimental\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand does harm to Singapore and its economic position,\r\n\r\nand that politicians should refrain from wild talk. I\r\n\r\nsounded  that  warning at a similar sitting  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  last year when we discussed the Budget, and  I\r\n\r\nsounded  it  before, when I opened the  office  of  a\r\n\r\nlocal  insurance  company.  And  when  I  said  that,\r\n\r\nprobably certain Members who sit smugly now thought I\r\n\r\nmeant  only  those  irresponsible  elements  in   our\r\n\r\nsociety.  But  I  also  meant  others,  Sir,I   am\r\n\r\nclarifying  it  now  for the information  of  certain\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  Liberal-Socialist  Party  who  have\r\n\r\nalways  been  saying. 'Capital has  flown  away  from\r\n\r\nSingapore.  What  have  we  got  to  attract  capital\r\n\r\nhere?', and this and that. That also is wild  talk - talk that is calculated to harm us in the long run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad. Sir, that we have also found support\r\n\r\nin  the Liberal-Socialist Party for Singapore's  free\r\n\r\nport  policy but here again, they are a little behind\r\n\r\nthe times. In fact, the Singapore Standard of the day\r\n\r\nbefore yesterday contained this headline:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Government's free trade policy to stay - Commerce\r\n\r\nMinister. Singapore's Commerce and Industry Minister,\r\n\r\nMr J. M. Jumabhoy, yesterday gave the assurance that\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  maintain a free trade  policy  and\r\n\r\nkeep the island a free port as far as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, Sir, on this side, realise the importance of the\r\n\r\nfree port policy. At the same time. Sir, we must make\r\n\r\nan   effort  to  develop  our  industries.   And   in\r\n\r\nindustrial   matters  there  are  always  conflicting\r\n\r\ninterests.  To develop industries, there are  certain\r\n\r\ntimes when certain industries would require a certain\r\n\r\namount   of  protection.  On  the  other  hand,   the\r\n\r\nmerchants who predominate today in Singapore are  all\r\n\r\nfor  the  free port policy, and therefore we  have  a\r\n\r\nconflict of interests.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the merchant class predominates in\r\n\r\nSingapore: the industrial class is much less. But  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  get a balance between the two  and  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether  both  views  cannot be brought  together.  I\r\n\r\nstated  earlier  in this House - I think  it  was  last\r\n\r\nyear - that there was a possibility that in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfuture  we  might  have to have  tariffs  to  protect\r\n\r\ncertain industries. I specifically mentioned that  if\r\n\r\nthat does come about, we should see that the entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  is  not hampered, in other words, that  if  we\r\n\r\never impose tariffs, they should be selective tariffs\r\n\r\non  such  items as would benefit us in the industrial\r\n\r\nfield  but at the same time would not take  away  our\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade. That means those items that  do  not\r\n\r\nenter  into  the  entrepot trade and which  we  could\r\n\r\nmanufacture locally to advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore used that word particularly, Sir - it is\r\n\r\n\"selective\" tariff. But of course, Sir, when  Members\r\n\r\nwant  to  interpret  it to their own  advantage  they\r\n\r\nconveniently forget certain words - like the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin  has when he quoted statistics (I shall  come\r\n\r\nto  that  later) and then put out a one-sided version\r\n\r\nfor  the  consumption of the public. That, I suppose,\r\n\r\nSir,  is quite a common practice with Members of  the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialist Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the hon. Member for Telok Ayer gave us the\r\n\r\npoints which would have to apply here in Singapore if\r\n\r\nindustries are to function. I will deal with them one\r\n\r\nby one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that, first, capital was required. No doubt\r\n\r\ncapital  formation is the chief of the  requirements.\r\n\r\nWithout  capital we cannot have industry - and we  have\r\n\r\nset  up  the Industrial Promotion Board to  help  the\r\n\r\nsmall  man  with capital. But we have to  rely  to  a\r\n\r\ngreat  extent on imported capital. Why?  The  reason,\r\n\r\nSir, is that our local millionaires do not believe in\r\n\r\nlong-term investment. They want to get quick  returns\r\n\r\nin  a  short time. They go in for the rubber  market,\r\n\r\nthe  share  market,  the tin market  and  other  such\r\n\r\nmarkets  which  give them quick returns  in  a  short\r\n\r\ntime.  In  spite of a lot of speeches to the contrary\r\n\r\nby  people  outside  this House,  these  facts  still\r\n\r\nremain so. Even this afternoon's Free Press has  this\r\n\r\nto  say, \"Slight interest in loans\" - referring to  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council loan of $13 million floated in  October\r\n\r\nlast. It says:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... The City Treasurer yesterday reported that\r\n\r\nonly  $9,000,000 had been subscribed so far. Most  of\r\n\r\nit came from the Central Provident Fund...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This loan, Sir, is offering a very good rate of\r\n\r\ninterest and good returns compared with similar  loans\r\n\r\nfloated previously and with the general interest  rate\r\n\r\nprevailing  at the moment, and yet we find that  local\r\n\r\ninvestors are not interested in investing in it.  They\r\n\r\nwant  to  go  in for quicker returns. So that  is  the\r\n\r\ntrouble  with us; we cannot blame anyone particularly.\r\n\r\nIt  is a thing that will have to be realised slowly by\r\n\r\nour own investors and be rectified by them.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Sir, the Member referred to cheap labour. Now\r\n\r\nit  is not necessary just to have cheap labour. We can\r\n\r\nhave  very cheap labour but labour that is inefficient\r\n\r\nand  ineffective. What is required is not cheap labour\r\n\r\nor the cutting down of the wages of labour and thereby\r\n\r\nreducing  their  standard  of  living  (because  every\r\n\r\ncountry wants to raise the standard of living  of  its\r\n\r\npeople),  but  higher  productivity  from  labour.  If\r\n\r\nlabour  can  produce more, if it acts in a responsible\r\n\r\nmanner while it does its job, and gives full value for\r\n\r\nthe money it is paid, you can step up productivity and\r\n\r\ntherefore  make goods at a cheaper price. You  can  be\r\n\r\nmore competitive in your final product.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer also says that one of the\r\n\r\nrequirements is low cost of living. Cost of living  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, Sir, is a matter which is beyond our hands.\r\n\r\nWe  depend  on  our food supplies, like rice,  on  our\r\n\r\nneighbours.  We do not produce much of  our  food  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  the  cost  of  living,  where  food  items,\r\n\r\ntextiles  and  wearing  apparel,  and  most   of   the\r\n\r\nnecessities  of  life are concerned,  depends  on  the\r\n\r\nmarket trends operating in the countries from which we\r\n\r\nimport  those  goods.  Therefore  it  is  beyond   our\r\n\r\ncontrol. Later on, however, I will prove with  figures\r\n\r\nthat  the  cost of living has not gone up - in  fact  in\r\n\r\ncertain cases it has come down slightly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vast hinterland is required; no doubt about that.\r\n\r\nA  vast  hinterland is always useful  but  it  is  not\r\n\r\nsomething that we can get for the asking. In fact  our\r\n\r\npolicy  to  merge with the Federation of  Malaya  will\r\n\r\nprovide that the economy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  both  territories will operate as  one.  Therefore\r\n\r\nthere  would be no question of a hinterland for  us - we\r\n\r\nwould be part of Malaya with a population of seven  or\r\n\r\neight million people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political stability, Sir - that is a thing which you\r\n\r\ncannot have overnight. That is a thing which is in the\r\n\r\nhands of certain Members of the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheap power - I think we already have cheap power\r\n\r\navailable in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower taxation - Sir, compared with those in many\r\n\r\nother  countries, our taxation rates  are  quite  low;\r\n\r\nexcept  perhaps those of Hong Kong; but then in  Hong Kong  you do not have a government responsible to  the\r\n\r\npeople  and therefore does not have to give the social\r\n\r\nservices  to them. You can find thousands of  refugees\r\n\r\nin  Hong Kong living in appalling conditions. Here, if\r\n\r\nyou build an Improvement Trust house and charge $30 in\r\n\r\nrent,  you have the Opposition Members shouting, \"$30!\r\n\r\nHow  can the poor man afford it?\" - in spite of the fact\r\n\r\nthat  half  of the appropriate rent is a subsidy  from\r\n\r\nGovernment  derived from taxation. If  you  have  such\r\n\r\nirresponsible Opposition Members, Sir, what can you do\r\n\r\nwith them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raw materials - Hong Kong has no raw materials and yet\r\n\r\nit has got first-class industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, a question was asked by the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin,   \"What   has  the  Government   done   about\r\n\r\nindustries?  Government  has  no  definite  policy  or\r\n\r\ninterest   in  industries.\"  The  Member  conveniently\r\n\r\nforgets,  Sir, that on 7th November, 1956,  I  made  a\r\n\r\nstatement   to   this  House  in  which   I   outlined\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy in regard to the encouragement  of\r\n\r\nforeign  capital and industries. I would like  to  say\r\n\r\nthat most of that policy has been carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go through it point by point. First of all, a\r\n\r\nsuitable  climate  for investment - Government's  action\r\n\r\nagainst  subversive elements is intended to  create  a\r\n\r\nsuitable  climate, but this is not something that  can\r\n\r\ncome overnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then repatriation of profits or capital - that is in force now. We are not refusing\r\n\r\nrepatriation of capital, or remittances of profits, to\r\n\r\nany foreign enterprise.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entry into Singapore of skilled workers, technicians\r\n\r\nand  so  on  who  are not available  here - that  is  in\r\n\r\noperation  now, Any foreign investor can say  that  he\r\n\r\nneeds  so  many  skilled workers or higher  managerial\r\n\r\nstaff  and  we  give him permission to bring  them  in\r\n\r\nprovided  he  can  not get similar  types  of  persons\r\n\r\nlocally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Importation from competitive markets of raw\r\n\r\nmaterials,  machinery  and  technical  equipment - there\r\n\r\nagain even though hard currency is really hard, we  do\r\n\r\nallow  hard  currency to a manufacturer where  he  can\r\n\r\nprove  that he can get an advantage by buying  from  a\r\n\r\nhard currency source.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I said, \"Government intends that a survey of\r\n\r\nthe  Colony's industrial potential and markets  should\r\n\r\nbe  carried  out\"; and, \"enquiries are being  made  to\r\n\r\nobtain the services of an expert\". I think at the last\r\n\r\nsitting  of  the Assembly, Sir, I made a statement  in\r\n\r\nwhich  I  said  that we had obtained  an  expert  from\r\n\r\nCanada  under  the Colombo Plan for this purpose.  Now\r\n\r\nMembers  will  ask, 'Why did you take  a  year?'  Sir,\r\n\r\nexperts are not produced from our pockets; we have  to\r\n\r\nget  a suitable man from a friendly country, and  that\r\n\r\nis  something which we have to wait and  try  and  try\r\n\r\nuntil we get him, and no amount of shouting across the\r\n\r\nfloor can accelerate getting that man. And experts are\r\n\r\nalso in short supply.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Government intends to establish an Institute of\r\n\r\nScientific and Industrial Research\" - we had Dr  Godwin\r\n\r\nhere to make a report on that. That report is now with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government for consultation with them,\r\n\r\nand until these consultations are finalised, we cannot\r\n\r\nmove  in that direction. And if the Member asks,  'Why\r\n\r\nwait for Kuala Lumpur? Why don't you do it here?',  he\r\n\r\nwill  be  belying  his  own statement  just  now  that\r\n\r\neconomically we must be in step with the Federation - we\r\n\r\nmust have one policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I said that an Industrial Promotion Board with\r\n\r\na  capital of $1 million would be set up - that has been\r\n\r\ndone already.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then \"Government is investigating the question of\r\n\r\nmaking  tax concessions to industries..\".  I  said\r\n\r\nfurther,  \"The outcome of this investigation  will  be\r\n\r\nreported  in due course\" to the House. Now, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nis  again  a pan-Malayan matter - income tax is  a  pan-Malayan  matter and any time we want to move  in  that\r\n\r\ndirection   we   have  to  get  agreement   from   the\r\n\r\nFederation.  Therefore this is something in  which  we\r\n\r\ncannot move unilaterally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members seem to be impatient at the\r\n\r\nslowness   at   which   industrial   development    is\r\n\r\nproceeding, and I can understand that-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Hon. Minister identify the\r\n\r\ndocument he is reading from?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The quotations are from a\r\n\r\nstatement  I made on 7th November, 1956, and  included\r\n\r\nin the Official Report of that day.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, hon. Members seem to be impatient at the\r\n\r\nslowness  of  industrial development and  I  can  well\r\n\r\nunderstand that. But when a man wants to invest even a\r\n\r\nthousand dollars he thinks ten times before he puts in\r\n\r\nthe  money.  This is a question of people coming  from\r\n\r\nother  parts  of  the world to invest millions,  in  a\r\n\r\ncountry of which probably they have heard a lot  about\r\n\r\nadversely  because  of  certain  politicians  on   the\r\n\r\nopposite  Benches. Therefore it takes time to convince\r\n\r\nthem  that  all is not bad with us; that we have  good\r\n\r\npeople -  even  though  they  may  not  be  in  a   big\r\n\r\nmajority - on the Government side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said also that Government intends to carry out a\r\n\r\nsurvey  of  the  Colony's  industrial  potential   and\r\n\r\nmarkets  which  will, for the first time,  reveal  the\r\n\r\npossibilities for industrial development.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nprocess you cannot expedite. The findings will act  as\r\n\r\na  basis  for future industrial development and  be  a\r\n\r\nuseful guide to prospective investors who are desirous\r\n\r\nof   ascertaining  the  industrial  possibilities   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And about tariffs I said that the question would be\r\n\r\ndeferred  until  the industrial potential  and  market\r\n\r\nsurvey  had  been  completed. It  is  no  use  running\r\n\r\nheadlong  into  such  a  thing.  When  you  plan  your\r\n\r\nindustrial  development or economic future,  you  have\r\n\r\ngot  to  be  very  certain that you are  not  damaging\r\n\r\nanything,  that  what  you plan will  give  you  added\r\n\r\nbenefits   but  not  take  away  from  your   existing\r\n\r\nresources. And therefore you cannot rush headlong into\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention was made, Sir, of 4,000 workers going out of\r\n\r\njobs  in  the  footwear industry. Sir, as  soon  as  I\r\n\r\nreceived   an   appeal   from  the   rubber   footwear\r\n\r\nmanufacturers,  I  said we would  investigate, and  I\r\n\r\nreferred the matter to the Industrial Promotion Board,\r\n\r\nwhich is the competent authority to examine this.  But\r\n\r\nthey  took their own time. It was only yesterday, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  they approached the Board and you will  find  in\r\n\r\ntoday's papers a reference to the fact that they  have\r\n\r\nnow set up a Working Committee.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before we rush headlong into giving tariff\r\n\r\nprotection to every Tom, Dick and Harry who  asks  for\r\n\r\nit,  we  have  got to make certain that there  are  no\r\n\r\nother   possibilities  by  which  we  could  save   an\r\n\r\nindustry. If we are absolutely certain that  there  is\r\n\r\nno  other way for the survival of that industry,  then\r\n\r\nwe  can think of tariff protection, but not before. It\r\n\r\nis  no  use  rushing precipitously into giving  tariff\r\n\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin also said, 'Where is the\r\n\r\ntrumpet blast of Ministers?' -referring to me, Sir.  He\r\n\r\nforgets  that about a year back we had trumpet  blasts\r\n\r\nevery day from the ex-Chief Minister which were not to\r\n\r\nthe  liking  of Members. Now when we have  no  trumpet\r\n\r\nblasts,  they bemoan the fact that we have no  trumpet\r\n\r\nblasts.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to see, Sir, how facts can be put\r\n\r\nin  a  one-sided manner, when the Member  for  Tanglin\r\n\r\nreferred  to  labour  and said  that  in  March  1956.\r\n\r\n124,645  labourers  were  employed,  in  March   1957,\r\n\r\n123,263 - a  short  fall of just over a  thousand.  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhat he did not mention were figures previous to those\r\n\r\nyears.  The  figures for 1954 (when  we  were  not  in\r\n\r\npower)  and early in 1955 (when we were not in  power)\r\n\r\nhe omitted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   mention.  He  also  omitted  to  mention  another\r\n\r\nsignificant  fact,  that is that  these  returns  were\r\n\r\nobtained   from  employers.  The  1956  returns   were\r\n\r\nobtained  from  5,470  employers,  whereas  the   1957\r\n\r\nreturns  (which  show  about  a  thousand  less)  were\r\n\r\nobtained from 5,155 employers - 300 less of them.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  why  the remaining employers did  not  give\r\n\r\ntheir returns but these figures represent returns from\r\n\r\nemployers, of whom 300 have not given returns. So both\r\n\r\nfigures are not fully given and even in the ones given\r\n\r\nyou might get slight variations. You do not look at  a\r\n\r\nparticular  month in a particular year and quote  that\r\n\r\nas  an example; you have got to look at the graph over\r\n\r\na  long period to gauge the trend. Not to do that,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, comes out of immature understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member quoted some figures, about rubber. I\r\n\r\nhave  some  figures  here.  January!  September  1955,\r\n\r\nremilled  rubber  including smoked  rubber  except  on\r\n\r\nestates,  Singapore  production, 56.2  thousand  tons;\r\n\r\nJanuary/September    1956,    59    thousand     tons;\r\n\r\nJanuary/September 1957, 62.5 thousand  tons - a  gradual\r\n\r\nincrease over the three years.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubber footwear, over which there has been a lot of\r\n\r\nbemoaning     in    this    House    this     morning:\r\n\r\nJanuary/September  1954,  Singapore  production  2,141\r\n\r\nthousand  pairs;  January  /  September  1955,   2,832\r\n\r\nthousand;  January / September 1956, 2,919.7 thousand;\r\n\r\nJanuary! September 1957, 2,784 thousand. So from  1954\r\n\r\nto  1957  there has been an increase in production  of\r\n\r\nroughly over 600 thousand pairs, if I am not mistaken.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also quoted figures about rice prices and said\r\n\r\nthe  price  had  gone up. There again I  said  it  was\r\n\r\nbeyond  our  control if the price went up because  the\r\n\r\nmarket  had  gone up in Thailand or in  Burma  due  to\r\n\r\ndelayed rains or some other causes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Stockpile.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> It is not due to stockpile. That\r\n\r\nis an absurd argument, Sir,In 1954 the rice price per\r\n\r\ngantang  was $1.65; in 1955 it was $1.36, in  1956  it\r\n\r\nwas $1.38-a sharp reduction from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$1.65  to $1.38. Of course, Sir, the Member will  pick\r\n\r\nout  a particular month which is to his advantage  and\r\n\r\nquote.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flour, wheaten, Australian - in 1954 it was 27 cents\r\n\r\nper  pound  and it has gone do wn until now  it  is  25\r\n\r\ncents.  For the last two years it has been  25  cents.\r\n\r\nMee - in 1954 it was 28 cents; now it is 25 cents.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthese figures show that the situation is not as bad as\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tanglin wishes to make out.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the main part of his speech, in\r\n\r\nwhich   he   said   that  the  Minister   had   hinted\r\n\r\nmysteriously  in  newspaper reports  about  industries\r\n\r\nbeing opened but nothing concrete was being done. Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  was  almost  a hint that the  Minister  did  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  what truth was. I have figures here  which\r\n\r\nmay  surprise  the House. In 1955, 74  new  industrial\r\n\r\ncompanies were registered; in 1956, 93; in 1957,  129 - these  are  industrial companies. Of these  industrial\r\n\r\ncompanies,  you have a vegetable oil refinery  with  a\r\n\r\ncapital  of  $1\u00bd  million. The Member mentioned  small\r\n\r\nindustries, not big ones, having been registered; I am\r\n\r\ngiving   the  big  ones - with  $1\u00bd  million   capital - a vegetable oil refinery. Then you have industries  with\r\n\r\n$1   million   capital - a  biscuit  and   confectionery\r\n\r\nmanufacturer,  cotton  spinner,  linen  maker,  rubber\r\n\r\nmiller - each  with $1 million capital. In  the  half  a\r\n\r\nmillion   dollar  capital  class  you   have   a   box\r\n\r\nmanufacturer,  gramophone  record  maker,  latex  foam\r\n\r\nproducts maker and pineapple canner.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these industries have been registered in the 11\r\n\r\nmonths  of  this  year, from January to  November.  In\r\n\r\nthese  11 months, 2,154 businesses were registered  of\r\n\r\nwhich  165  were  limited liability companies  of  all\r\n\r\ntypes with a total capital of $225 million.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that shows that Opposition Party members can\r\n\r\nalways  talk at random, generalise and ask, `Where  is\r\n\r\nthe evidence of industrial progress?', but they cannot\r\n\r\nquote  figures. I have here proved that they  are  far\r\n\r\nfrom the truth when they make such allegations.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1955 and 1956 there were $2 million capital\r\n\r\ncompanies operating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncanneries,     sauce    factories,    rubber     goods\r\n\r\nmanufacturers; and of course we have a steel and  iron\r\n\r\nmill  plus  other manufacturers with a million  dollar\r\n\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

All these companies are working.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now. Sir, what are the new industries which are not\r\n\r\nin  this list but which are coming? I am going to tell\r\n\r\nthe  House  now - the  ones that I  have  been  `hinting\r\n\r\nmysteriously' about. Unfortunately, Sir, I have had to\r\n\r\nhint mysteriously because as Minister for Commerce and\r\n\r\nIndustry  I  am in a responsible position  and  cannot\r\n\r\ndivulge  secret  information; the companies  concerned\r\n\r\nwould  not  like  me to do so. It is against  business\r\n\r\ninterests  and business etiquette to give  out  secret\r\n\r\ninformation which is in my possession and which  I  do\r\n\r\nnot have the authority from them to divulge. Therefore\r\n\r\nI  have  had  no  recourse but to  generalise  without\r\n\r\nmaking  special  reference  to  what  they  are.  Now,\r\n\r\nhowever, I can tell the House something.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans are now finalised for the establishment of a\r\n\r\nflour mill which, in the final stages, will involve  a\r\n\r\ncapital of $5 million. The company will be operated by\r\n\r\nHong Kong capital. Approval in principle has also been\r\n\r\ngiven for another big enterprise with about $2 million\r\n\r\ncapital the nature of which I am still not allowed  to\r\n\r\ndisclose.  However, I can say that  one-third  of  its\r\n\r\ncapital  will  be  local and two-thirds  foreign.  The\r\n\r\nShell  Company,  as I have stated  in  the  Press,  is\r\n\r\nplanning to build a big oil-bulking plant with a total\r\n\r\nexpenditure of about $3 million. Then negotiations are\r\n\r\nnow  going on for the establishment of a tuna industry\r\n\r\nusing Singapore as a base for the fishing vessels, and\r\n\r\nthe   ancillary  industries  of  canning  and   others\r\n\r\nconnected  with  tuna fishing. We have  also  received\r\n\r\nenquiries  and  are  negotiating  for  various   other\r\n\r\nventures. I am sorry that even if hon. Members tax  me\r\n\r\nto  the extent of raising my temper, I cannot disclose\r\n\r\nthe  nature  of  these enterprises because  I  am  not\r\n\r\nallowed to do so yet.

He  has\r\n\r\ncarefully avoided telling us how much of  the  $200\r\n\r\nmillion  worth of capital has been paid up.  It  is\r\n\r\nvery easy for anyone to start a company with a  $10\r\n\r\nmillion capital and registering it by paying a very\r\n\r\nsmall  premium on that capital but the main  factor\r\n\r\nis  how  much of it is paid up? He has not told  us\r\n\r\nhow   many  of  these  companies  which  have  been\r\n\r\nregistered are really companies, not companies like\r\n\r\npartnerships and concerns which have been  carrying\r\n\r\non  for  a number of years and are now being turned\r\n\r\ninto  limited  companies  and  which  have  to   be\r\n\r\nregistered under the Companies Ordinance.

Sir, I must say that we are very grateful to\r\n\r\nhim  for letting us know his policy at this stage  and\r\n\r\nit is for all of us in Singapore now to decide on what\r\n\r\nfuture for Singapore we would like to have: whether we\r\n\r\nwould  have his choice to scare away capital which  is\r\n\r\nso   badly  needed  at  the  present  moment,   create\r\n\r\nunemployment and chaos, inevitably leading us into the\r\n\r\nposition  as  in  Indonesia today,  or  to  adopt  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  which  our Party stand  for - a  co-operation\r\n\r\nbetween  capital and labour which we think is possible\r\n\r\nand  the  only solution for Singapore. If we  have  to\r\n\r\nfight  like Indonesia for independence, then  I  would\r\n\r\nagree   with  his  principle.

We are concerned only with the  failure\r\n\r\nand  the consequences that they have brought upon  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore. We are only concerned  with  the\r\n\r\npromises  that have been broken. At the elections,  we\r\n\r\nwere told that we would have everything and now we get\r\n\r\nnothing. What do we have? We have 12,000 families  now\r\n\r\non  the  waiting list and for them there is no earthly\r\n\r\nchance of getting houses in the next few years because\r\n\r\nevery house that is going to be completed will have to\r\n\r\nbe  given  to those living on sites which have  to  be\r\n\r\ncleared  for  building  by the  Singapore  Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust.  Sir, that is a grievous position and what  has\r\n\r\nthe  Government  done to make up for  the  failure  in\r\n\r\nmeeting this what must be the most important platform?\r\n\r\nNothing,  absolutely nothing! Private development  has\r\n\r\nbeen  held up too. In my experience, it has  taken  us\r\n\r\nlonger  to get a plan passed than to build 500 houses.\r\n\r\nI  am afraid and I am ashamed that I have to say this.\r\n\r\nStill,   that  is  true  and  because  of  this,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has created problems everywhere.  What  has\r\n\r\nhappened? You cannot stop people from finding shelter;\r\n\r\nthey have to live somewhere. That has given the chance\r\n\r\nto  speculators to build wildly all over  the  country\r\n\r\nhundreds  of  houses. That has already  caused  or  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  cause the collapse of the Master  Plan  and\r\n\r\nthat has created a problem for any government to solve\r\n\r\nand  it can only be solved with firmness and sympathy.\r\n\r\nGovernment could have easily acquired large tracts  of\r\n\r\nland, putting roads, water and light and selling plots\r\n\r\nto  the people who want sites to build their houses on\r\n\r\nor   lease  the  land  out  so  that  they  can  build\r\n\r\nthemselves  a  shelter over their  heads.  Instead  of\r\n\r\nthat,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neverything  that goes out to the Planning Department  is  held  up\r\n\r\nbecause  of the Master Plan - a Master Plan which has never had  our\r\n\r\nsanction  but which has been applied during the last three  years.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the result? Now, there are thousands of illegal houses\r\n\r\nand what is to be done? Sir, that is the biggest problem before us\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same position, Sir, also applies to development schemes. The\r\n\r\nHon. the Financial Secretary sighed with relief when he mentioned:\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... it appears likely that, instead of the estimated deficit of\r\n\r\n$3 million, the Development Fund will show a surplus at the end of\r\n\r\nthe year of the order of $40 million...\".\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is no progress. What it means is that $43 million\r\n\r\nworth  of works which should have been done has not been done  and\r\n\r\nis  projected  into the future causing more delay  and  confusion.\r\n\r\nWould  it  not  be better for us, Sir, to have a realistic  Budget\r\n\r\nthan just hopes and aims unachieved?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do however endorse heartily that more of the Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund  should  be invested locally and also the suggestion  of  the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Financial  Secretary that  a  Planning  Committee  with\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the Government, the City  Council  and  other\r\n\r\ndevelopment  authorities  be set up as quickly  as  possible.  Too\r\n\r\noften have I noticed roads being torn up, repaired and being  torn\r\n\r\nup  again for the water, light and sewerage services and I am sure\r\n\r\na  Planning  Committee like this will avoid all these  unnecessary\r\n\r\nexpenses being incurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, contrary\r\n\r\nto  the opinion of some Members on this side of the House,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion, one of the most cheerful things about the review of  1957\r\n\r\nwhich  the Hon. the Financial Secretary made in his speech is  the\r\n\r\nrecord  of  progress. The Budget has been described by  the  local\r\n\r\nPress as \"painless\" and I think that is a very fair criticism;  so\r\n\r\nalso  were the Hon. the Financial Secretary's remarks on  economic\r\n\r\ncooperation  between Singapore and the Federation of  Malaya.  The\r\n\r\nfuture of these two territories, Sir, is so closely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlinked that one would like to believe that anything other than the\r\n\r\nclosest  economic  liaison  between  them  would  be  unthinkable.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I have heard fears expressed from time to time about\r\n\r\nthe  future of the currencies of these territories and, in a  way,\r\n\r\nit  is a pity that the Hon. the Financial Secretary was unable  to\r\n\r\ntell  us  more  at this stage regarding the issue and  control  of\r\n\r\ncurrency,  foreign  exchange control,  import/export  control  and\r\n\r\nother matters which, as he said in his speech, were for the moment\r\n\r\nsub judice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I do not find myself in agreement with very many of the\r\n\r\nremarks  made by the Member for Tanjong Pagar this morning,  I  do\r\n\r\nagree that there must be a large amount of income tax evasion  and\r\n\r\nthis  is a particularly sore point with the much maligned European\r\n\r\ncommunity  who nobody will deny have always met their  obligations\r\n\r\nin  full.  It is at least reassuring however to hear the Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary  saying  that  outstanding  arrears  will  be\r\n\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the good thing about this Budget, Sir, and indeed about\r\n\r\nalmost  every Budget presented to us over the last few  years,  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  position remains, as described by the Hon. Minister  on\r\n\r\nmore than one occasion when he uses the effective but prosaic word\r\n\r\n\"sound\".  A  small  public  debt and  a  general  revenue  balance\r\n\r\nequivalent  to  3\u00bd  months  revenue is indeed  a  sound  position.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, one cannot help experiencing a little uneasiness  at\r\n\r\nthe  thought of expenditure growing year by year while revenue  is\r\n\r\nshowing signs of levelling out. It is true that the main increases\r\n\r\nin  expenditure  are  in  social services, education  and  medical\r\n\r\nservices but in the final analysis, the country's expenditure must\r\n\r\nbe  related to its revenue capacity and, in view of the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinancial    Secretary's   rebuttal   of   allegations   regarding\r\n\r\nGovernment's  extravagance, it is difficult  to  see  how  in  the\r\n\r\nforthcoming years, the gulf of $12 to $15 million annually can  be\r\n\r\nbridged  unless there be a considerable increase in taxation.  For\r\n\r\nmy  own  part, I cannot see any reduction in the rate of expansion\r\n\r\nof the social services, and so on,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing  lightly undertaken by any socialist Government.\r\n\r\nPersonally,   I   accept  the   Hon. the   Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary's  statement that there is  nothing  new  or\r\n\r\nnovel in the estimate of expenditure. I should believe\r\n\r\nthat under his supervision and direction, the Treasury\r\n\r\nmay and probably does argue bitterly about expenditure\r\n\r\nbefore it is approved. So, Sir, we arrive at an actual\r\n\r\nestimated deficit of $8 million and the Assembly  last\r\n\r\nweek  heard,  to  my  mind, the astounding  fact  that\r\n\r\nincreases  in taxation this year would be confined  to\r\n\r\npetrol, diesel vehicles and stamp duty on conveyances,\r\n\r\nand  I doubt, Sir, if any Members on this side of  the\r\n\r\nHouse were other than greatly surprised. I cannot  pay\r\n\r\nany serious attention to the arguments put forward  by\r\n\r\ncertain Members on this side of the House against  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of a tax on petrol. It seems to me a  tax\r\n\r\nwhich  is  both logical and equitable but  while  many\r\n\r\npeople  must have sighed with relief at the moderation\r\n\r\nand   mildness   of   the  measures  introduced,   the\r\n\r\nineluctable fact remains that much greater taxation is\r\n\r\nin  the offing and that the present is no more than  a\r\n\r\nrespite.  We have to admit that we are indeed  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  most lightly taxed nations in the world,  as  the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Financial  Secretary has  said,  but  those\r\n\r\ncountries  which are more heavily taxed  probably  get\r\n\r\nmore  for  their money. However, if we want  more,  we\r\n\r\nmust pay more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find, Sir, again that I cannot share the Member\r\n\r\nfor   Tanjong   Pagar's  view  that  the   method   of\r\n\r\npresentation  of  these Estimates  is  deplorable  and\r\n\r\ninefficient. There is no overt attempt to deceive  the\r\n\r\npeople  or  to  secrete  large  sums  away  like  some\r\n\r\nmendacious company director or, as we already have had\r\n\r\nreference  to  sleight  of hand, some  prestidigitator\r\n\r\nsuch as the Minister for Health. However, perhaps  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will make an attempt to simplify  them  so\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  unlikely event of the  People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty coming into power, then the great brains of  the\r\n\r\nParty will be able to understand them.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say, Sir, that I do not like at all, in the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Financial Secretary's speech, the  sinister\r\n\r\nreferences to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neventual   introduction   of   import   duties.   Many\r\n\r\nbusinessmen would be dismayed at the thought and  even\r\n\r\nif  the  tariffs,  as, the Minister for  Commerce  and\r\n\r\nIndustry has indicated, were carefully chosen to avoid\r\n\r\nitems  which figure largely in the entrepot  trade,  I\r\n\r\nshould  feel that there is more in the entrepot  trade\r\n\r\nthan goods to godown basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a debate such as this, it is inevitable that\r\n\r\npolitical Parties will attack one another and it is in\r\n\r\na  way  surprising that they should spare any time  at\r\n\r\nall  for nominated Members. I never had such limelight\r\n\r\nthis  morning since the days of the ex-Chief Minister.\r\n\r\nHowever,  one is not impressed by the remarks  of  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar. He rarely makes  a  speech\r\n\r\nwithout   reference  to  perils  unseen   and   people\r\n\r\nperishing  and  diving  into  the  sea  and  such-like\r\n\r\nremarks  but one or two things he said this morning  I\r\n\r\ncannot let go unchallenged. One would have thought  to\r\n\r\nhear  him speak that the making of profits is an evil.\r\n\r\nFar  from being an evil, it is indeed the chief object\r\n\r\nof business and is in itself an entirely laudable one.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  important is how profits are dealt with.  An\r\n\r\nexamination.. Sir, of the balance sheets of many local\r\n\r\npublic  companies, such as the list read  out  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar this morning, reveals  that\r\n\r\nfar  from paying a large percentage of the profits  to\r\n\r\navaricious shareholders, the shareholders only receive\r\n\r\nwhat  in  business circles is known as a fair  return.\r\n\r\nFrequently  a large percentage is ploughed  back  into\r\n\r\nthe  business  here  in  this country  permitting  the\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  expand and thus creating employment.  A\r\n\r\ndividend  of, shall we say, 30 per cent  paid  on  the\r\n\r\npaid-up capital of a company would be described by the\r\n\r\nuninitiated and even by the Member for Tanjong  Pagar,\r\n\r\nwho  in this field shows an obtuseness which he shared\r\n\r\nwith  the ex-Member for Cairnhill (Mr D. S. Marshall)\r\n\r\nprobably  as  \"an  obscene  profit\" -  that   was   the\r\n\r\nexpression  once used in this House.  A  30  per  cent\r\n\r\ndividend,  Sir, does not mean that  one  can  invest\r\n\r\none's  money  in a company and obtain 30 per  cent  on\r\n\r\none's money. It is entirely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwrong and illogical to consider in isolation dividends\r\n\r\npaid  on  paid-up capital and unless  one  takes  into\r\n\r\naccount all the money employed in the business -  funds\r\n\r\nwhich incidentally belong to the shareholders - one  may\r\n\r\nreceive  an  entirely  wrong  impression.  Any   local\r\n\r\ninvestor  knows very well that he can  only  expect  a\r\n\r\ncertain  yield on his investment. Such yield might  be\r\n\r\n10  per  cent although the dividend might be  100  per\r\n\r\ncent.  I  would  say, Sir, just before  I  leave  this\r\n\r\nsubject  that an investor is entitled to a  reasonable\r\n\r\nreturn  on  his  money  especially  in  an  industrial\r\n\r\nenterprise. He is taking a calculated risk .and he  is\r\n\r\nentitled  to  a  certain return. Out of  this  return,\r\n\r\nGovernment  takes  a  .good  slice.  The  attitude  of\r\n\r\ncertain politicians to this is that the workers should\r\n\r\nshare  in all this in a bigger way than they  do.  The\r\n\r\nwicked capitalist. .of course, supplies them with jobs\r\n\r\nand  their livelihood but he also takes all the  risks\r\n\r\nas  all  the  headaches, pays  the  taxes,  gives  his\r\n\r\nworkers  annual  leave, medical leave,  casual  leave,\r\n\r\nmaternity  leave and virtually runs a  welfare  state.\r\n\r\nHis  motto  might  very well be  Liberty  Egalite  and\r\n\r\nmaternity. All this he must do so even if his  company\r\n\r\nmakes  losses and we know full well that if they  made\r\n\r\nlosses, the workers would never dream or indeed  would\r\n\r\nbe  incapable of making them up. But my last  word  on\r\n\r\nthis subject, Sir, which I am cutting short, is simply\r\n\r\nthis.  Let  us remember that a large majority  of  the\r\n\r\nlocal  companies here may have foreign-sounding  names\r\n\r\nor   may  have  originally  been  foreign  or  British\r\n\r\nentirely  in their origin but today a great number  of\r\n\r\ntheir  shareholders  and the executives  too  are  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily foreigners. The owners of the company  may\r\n\r\nin  fact  be  the clerks in your office who  may  have\r\n\r\nventured their small capital in order to get a  better\r\n\r\nreturn  than  they  get  in  their  miserable  deposit\r\n\r\naccounts with banks or the Post Office savings bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is just one other thing I would like to say,\r\n\r\nSir,  apropos  the remarks of the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar,  and  that is this: he actually  mentioned  the\r\n\r\ncorporation  I myself serve and I would like  to  tell\r\n\r\nhim  that in the dire circumstances which he envisaged\r\n\r\nof our being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaken  over  by  some unfriendly local set-up,  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  him that whoever they are, they will  probably\r\n\r\nget less than the Japanese got out of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.41 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI must contradict the statements and the speeches made\r\n\r\nby  two  Members in the Assembly today.  One  was  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin (Mr Ede) and the other  was  the\r\n\r\nMember for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck). They accuse\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  Sir, for the state of  affairs  with\r\n\r\nregard to the housing programme. It is true that I did\r\n\r\nmake  a  statement  earlier  this  year  that  between\r\n\r\nSeptember  1956  and August 1957 not a single  housing\r\n\r\nunit  was completed. I hope that both the Members  and\r\n\r\nthe  other Members of this Assembly would realise that\r\n\r\nI used the word \"completed\" and that I did not use the\r\n\r\nwords  \"under construction\". But in actual fact,  Sir,\r\n\r\nduring that period, there were more than 4,000 housing\r\n\r\nunits  under  construction. If Members had  taken  the\r\n\r\ntrouble to follow some of the statements which I  have\r\n\r\nmade  both in this House and outside, they would  have\r\n\r\nrealised  that  to  have a house  completed  in  1956,\r\n\r\nplanning  should  have started way  back  in  1954  or\r\n\r\nearlier. That was the time, Sir, when we were  not  in\r\n\r\npower. You cannot build a house, less still complete a\r\n\r\nhuge  building programme, by the mere stroke of a pen.\r\n\r\nYou  need  planning,  money and vacant  land.  As  for\r\n\r\nvacant  land,  Sir,  there  is  hardly  any  place  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  today which is not crowded with  squatters.\r\n\r\nOne  cannot  arbitrarily evict this  class  of  people\r\n\r\nwithout  giving  them alternative  accommodation  even\r\n\r\nthough  Government has taken mandatory orders  against\r\n\r\nthem.   The   resettlement  of  squatters  from   land\r\n\r\nearmarked for the Singapore Improvement Trust building\r\n\r\nschemes   is  the  most  formidable  task  confronting\r\n\r\nGovernment   in   its  housing  projects.   One   non-cooperative squatter can hold up the whole  scheme.  I\r\n\r\nhope  that Members of this Assembly will realise  this\r\n\r\nwhen they send their chits and bits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  papers to me pleading for an extension of time  on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of squatters on Crown land against whom action\r\n\r\nis    about    to   be   taken.   The    Member    for\r\n\r\nTanglin - fortunately he is not here today - is one of the\r\n\r\nmost   distinguished  offenders  of  this  habit.   If\r\n\r\nOpposition Members blame Government, then  I  think  a\r\n\r\nfair measure of the blame should also be placed on the\r\n\r\nshoulders of the Members themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Housing Authority, I have promised this\r\n\r\nHouse  that a Bill for this will be introduced at  the\r\n\r\nnext  session of the Assembly. There has been no delay\r\n\r\nin  tackling  this  problem. The  establishment  of  a\r\n\r\nhousing  and  development  authority  is  also  inter-dependent  on  the  establishment of  a  new  planning\r\n\r\ndepartment  and  a  new planning authority  since  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Improvement Trust is at present responsible\r\n\r\nfor both housing and planning, and the dissolution  of\r\n\r\nthe Trust therefore requires that planning should also\r\n\r\nbe covered besides housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last word, Sir. The Member for Paya Lebar said\r\n\r\njust  now  that there had been delays in having  plans\r\n\r\npassed by the authorities because of the Master  Plan.\r\n\r\nAs far as I am aware, Sir, this is not quite the case.\r\n\r\nThe  question of saving plans passed in Singapore does\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily  rest entirely with the  Master  Plan\r\n\r\nteam  or  the Master Plan itself but you have so  many\r\n\r\nauthorities  in Singapore which have got to  give  the\r\n\r\ngreen light. Sometimes it may be the City Council  and\r\n\r\nsometimes the Rural Board but inevitably the  approval\r\n\r\nmust finally rest with the Singapore Improvement Trust\r\n\r\nwho  are not, shall I say, the authority on the Master\r\n\r\nPlan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> r Speaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\nhis  reply, the Minister for Commerce and Industry has\r\n\r\ntried  to paint a picture to tell us that all is  well\r\n\r\nbut from one of his colleagues, the Hon. the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary,  we  have heard that \"the  boom  period  is\r\n\r\nover\"  and  that \"money is now tighter\".

The Government  Benchers\r\n\r\nhave always taken that advantage and I think they take\r\n\r\nit as a matter of right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that today trade has not been good. The\r\n\r\nMinister for Commerce and industry will remember  that\r\n\r\nwhen   we   met  this  time  last  year,  there   were\r\n\r\ndelegations of traders coming to see him. I would  say\r\n\r\nthat  there had been people who were manufacturers  of\r\n\r\nbeehoon  who  came along to see him saying  that  they\r\n\r\nwould  have  to close down 20 or 30 factories  and  he\r\n\r\nsaid, \"We will help you. We will start a corporation.\"\r\n\r\nHe  called that the Industrial Promotion Board with  a\r\n\r\ncapital  of $1 million. They did what they  could  and\r\n\r\ntook his advice. Today, they are still in exactly  the\r\n\r\nsame  position.  The  manufacturers  still  find  keen\r\n\r\ncompetition and many of them are throwing out more and\r\n\r\nmore   of  their  employees.  I  think  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nStandard  published  a  report  of  some  more  people\r\n\r\ncalling  on  him and this time it was the  oil-millers\r\n\r\nwho  described to him the shortage of copra which  was\r\n\r\naffecting  their business. I do not think that  he  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  able to do anything for  them  in  that\r\n\r\nmatter. Again we had the shoemakers headed by Mr  Soh\r\n\r\nKoon  Tin seeing him about their difficulties. He told\r\n\r\nthem  that  he  could not do anything for  them,  that\r\n\r\nthings  must take their course, that goods  cannot  be\r\n\r\nstopped from coming in and that the free flow of goods\r\n\r\nmust  not be stopped - and I should say nor can he stop\r\n\r\nhis salary from getting into his pocket! Last year, we\r\n\r\nhad  the  soap  manufacturers rushing madly  about  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and the biscuit manufacturers too and  these\r\n\r\npeople  have reduced their output; many of  them  have\r\n\r\nshifted their factories into the Federation. I suppose\r\n\r\nthis   would  be  described  as  being  an   excellent\r\n\r\nunderstanding  that  has  been  established  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  the Federation of Malaya.  Yes,  in  a\r\n\r\nmatter  such  as  this, our Singapore  Government  has\r\n\r\nnever  been  in a position to protect its  own  trade.\r\n\r\nWith  the Federation, it is a sovereign state  and  we\r\n\r\nmust\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntake  the  heavy end of the stick! Today we are  faced\r\n\r\nwith   another  difficulty.  There  is  a  crisis   in\r\n\r\nIndonesia. I think that our Ministers will again  fold\r\n\r\ntheir  arms  and  say, \"Well, you  may  complain  that\r\n\r\nbusiness  has  dropped 50 per cent. The  import/export\r\n\r\nbusiness  between Indonesia and Singapore has  dropped\r\n\r\nbecause  of  this crisis, but we cannot do  anything.\"\r\n\r\nLocal  traders are afraid of what will happen to their\r\n\r\ncapital  in Indonesia. They will want protection  from\r\n\r\nthis  Government.  I expect the same  reply  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will be, \"We cannot help you.  We  can  do\r\n\r\nnothing.  It  will have to take its  own  course.\"  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, Government will claim credit especially during\r\n\r\nlast  year  when  it  sent  an  expensive  mission  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia and came back announcing everywhere that  it\r\n\r\nhad  brought  back  so many tons of goods  and  rubber\r\n\r\nwhich had incidentally already been negotiated by  the\r\n\r\ntraders themselves. All these, Sir, leave me to  think\r\n\r\nthat Government has never awakened to the fact that it\r\n\r\nis  their  duty to increase trade because it  is  only\r\n\r\nwith increased trade that we can increase revenue.  If\r\n\r\nwe  look  into the income tax returns right  from  the\r\n\r\nbeginning when we started to collect tax, we will  see\r\n\r\nthat  right  from  1948  we  started  collecting  $2.8\r\n\r\nmillion, going up to $30 million and going up all  the\r\n\r\ntime  until  in 1956 it was $68 million.  This  shows,\r\n\r\nSir, that expenditure in this colony may rise, we  may\r\n\r\nneed  more money for our social services, but the most\r\n\r\nsensible  way and the most painless way of  collecting\r\n\r\nrevenue would be to increase trade because anybody who\r\n\r\nmakes money will not worry about being taxed. With the\r\n\r\nsame rate of income tax but with increased business, I\r\n\r\nexpect  that  we  should not be  collecting  just  $68\r\n\r\nmillion but should be collecting near $100 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

We must not have wild  talk\r\n\r\nas  he  said. We must keep Singapore as a  free  port.\r\n\r\nYes, we must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkeep  Singapore as a free port, so said the  Minister,\r\n\r\nbut  we would have introduced the Luxury Tax Bill  and\r\n\r\nmake it not so free, and from what the Government  has\r\n\r\nbeen  trying  to tell us, we expect that this  freedom\r\n\r\nwill  be  curtailed soon. This would be  very  serious\r\n\r\nindeed. To create a suitable climate, the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommerce and Industry remarked that they have arrested\r\n\r\nsubversives  and  that  there has  been  a  return  of\r\n\r\nconfidence.

The  local people understand  things  even\r\n\r\nbetter  and  the local people I would  say  have  even\r\n\r\nadvocated that their money be invested in foreign\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountries. I will give you a very good example,  Sir,\r\n\r\nan  example that is, I should say, sponsored  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  because I again agree with the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary that this  step  is  wrong:  the\r\n\r\nCentral Provident Fund Board insists that 25 per cent\r\n\r\nof  its fund should be invested outside Malaya  at  a\r\n\r\ntime  when Singapore is requiring it and the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund  Board is a Board  appointed  by  the\r\n\r\npresent Government! This Board I would say must  have\r\n\r\nthe blessings of the Government to give an example to\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore not to invest all its  money\r\n\r\nin   Singapore  but  elsewhere!  This  I   think   is\r\n\r\nabsolutely bad for Singapore. We need that money.  We\r\n\r\nmust  have confidence in ourselves. All organisations\r\n\r\nthat  have money and all capital in Singapore  should\r\n\r\nexpress  confidence  in Singapore  and  invest  their\r\n\r\nmoney here otherwise how can we attract the people in\r\n\r\nforeign countries to invest their money here? However\r\n\r\nlet  me now turn to what Singapore can supply in  the\r\n\r\nmatter  of its facilities. Singapore produces nothing\r\n\r\nbut  she can produce the service and we just  do  not\r\n\r\nproduce the service by folding our arms or by leaving\r\n\r\nthings  to  take their own course. We must train  our\r\n\r\nmen. In one of the -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> The Singapore Standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, in the Standard again, you\r\n\r\nwill  find that they referred to the large number  of\r\n\r\nstudents who are leaving schools this year in  search\r\n\r\nof  jobs and they referred to them as aspiring to  be\r\n\r\nclerks - Singapore as a country or as a  land  that  is\r\n\r\nturning out people fit to be clerks. In this country,\r\n\r\nwe  produce nothing and if we just produce clerks, we\r\n\r\nwill not progress. I compare Singapore with countries\r\n\r\nlike  Britain and Japan with limited land  but  which\r\n\r\nmake  use of their services for their livelihood.  In\r\n\r\nthese countries, the Governments should plan to  give\r\n\r\nthe  people facilities so that students will not only\r\n\r\nget training to be clerks, but they can be trained in\r\n\r\ntechnical  jobs  too.

There is a big Head for\r\n\r\nDefence. We are spending a lot of money on our  Navy.\r\n\r\nI  wonder how big a Navy we can create, whether  that\r\n\r\nNavy  will be big enough to withstand any one of  our\r\n\r\nneighbours. At best it can be said that the  Navy  we\r\n\r\ncan   create   will  be  a  coastal  patrol   against\r\n\r\nsmugglers. Why can we not put that sum of money  into\r\n\r\nsomething  more  useful? Why can  we  not  train  our\r\n\r\npeople  to become mariners and navigators? We have  a\r\n\r\nlot  of seamen in Singapore but we do not have people\r\n\r\nwho  are  trained to take over the control of  boats.\r\n\r\nThat money, I think, is utterly wasted. Of course the\r\n\r\nHon. the Financial Secretary assured us that  should\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya take over our Navy then  we\r\n\r\nmust  provide  further regiments.  I  again  ask  why\r\n\r\nfurther regiments? Are we going to war? Even  if  the\r\n\r\nwhole population of Singapore become soldiers, can we\r\n\r\nfight any of our neighbours? We will have to rely  on\r\n\r\nother  factors than our own strength and  that  money\r\n\r\ncould  be usefully spent in training our own  people.\r\n\r\nThe  regiment is needed to help the Police in keeping\r\n\r\ninternal  peace  but we do not want to  overspend  on\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now even turning to Education, we know that we have\r\n\r\nprovided  nothing to train technical  people  to  fit\r\n\r\nthem   into  the  various  positions  in  trade   and\r\n\r\nindustry. The Government has even failed to implement\r\n\r\nits  policy  of giving a place to every child  before\r\n\r\nthe  age  of  12  or  14 years.  Again  I  find  this\r\n\r\nreference  in  the speech by the Hon. the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is the aim of the Government to give primary\r\n\r\neducation to all children between the ages of  6  and\r\n\r\n14.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today we find that many of the students have been\r\n\r\nthrown out of school because they failed to pass  the\r\n\r\nStd. V or Primary VI examination, and they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nhave  not attained the age of 14.

This\r\n\r\nagain,  Sir,  will be contrary to the promise  of  the\r\n\r\nLabour Front and children between the ages of 6 and 14\r\n\r\nwill  not  have a place in school. Of course,  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is pursuing such a policy and knows that it\r\n\r\ncannot  sufficiently provide for all students and  all\r\n\r\nthe  children,  then it should help  young  people  in\r\n\r\nother ways. Today we find that because of insufficient\r\n\r\neducational  facilities young people have been  thrown\r\n\r\nout  into  the streets, too young to be employed,  and\r\n\r\nnot  educated enough to be employed, and  nobody  will\r\n\r\never  employ them because of these factors;  and  when\r\n\r\nthey are out in the streets, they become a problem  to\r\n\r\nthe  police.  We have heard a great deal  of  juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency.  Government has not  been  helping  these\r\n\r\npeople much. The Member for Tanjong Pagar referred  to\r\n\r\nboys'  clubs.  At  least the boys' club  movement  has\r\n\r\ntried to help the young people of Singapore. What  has\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. to offer to the young people of Singapore?\r\n\r\nI certainly feel that with organisations  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  movements such as this they  should  get\r\n\r\nencouragement  from  leaders like the  P.A.P. leader,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  having cold water poured on them.  If  he\r\n\r\nwould do a stroke of work to lift the young people  up\r\n\r\nfrom  their  idleness and uselessness,  I  would  have\r\n\r\ntaken my hat off to him.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Today\r\n\r\nwe  find  there is a general feeling of insecurity  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This feeling is expressed by  one  of  the\r\n\r\nmost  important organisations in Singapore - the Chinese\r\n\r\nChamber of Commerce. They have downright condemned the\r\n\r\ninactivity of the Government in matters such as  this.\r\n\r\nWe  must be able to live in peace and security, and if\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot offer us that, then it is not  doing\r\n\r\nits job.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must now, Sir, touch on some of the points raised\r\n\r\nby  other  speakers this morning during the debate.  I\r\n\r\nwas  most surprised to hear the P.A.P. leader  talking\r\n\r\nof  the  Labour  Front being hoodwinked  by  the  past\r\n\r\ncolonial government and again offering to its partner\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na wreath for its early demise. This seems to be bad. I\r\n\r\nam referring to this because the Minister for Commerce\r\n\r\nand   Industry  mentioned  stability.  I  wonder   how\r\n\r\nstability  can be brought about when one  of  its  own\r\n\r\npartners  is accusing it of being led by the  nose  by\r\n\r\nthe  colonial  government and  that  the  millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars   that  was  approved  for  payment   to   the\r\n\r\nexpatriates  is going to be poured down the  drain.  I\r\n\r\nfind  it  most  illogical for  the  young  brother  to\r\n\r\ncriticise the big brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question of taxation, Sir, when the\r\n\r\nLabour Front presented this Budget, I would say it was\r\n\r\npresenting a Budget meant for the election.  We  shall\r\n\r\ncall  it an election budget- with an eye to persuading\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore that it is going  to  be  a\r\n\r\npainless  budget, that it is not going to  hurt  them,\r\n\r\nand  that the best way not to hurt them is to tax them\r\n\r\nvery  little. The Labour Front seems to think  that  a\r\n\r\ntax on petrol would do the job. I was thinking that it\r\n\r\nwill have its repercussions and I think I am not wrong\r\n\r\nbecause the newspapers have reported that the increase\r\n\r\nof 20 cents a gallon on petrol will increase the fares\r\n\r\nof  taxis. The taxi drivers have protested against  it\r\n\r\nand  they  are thinking of increasing the  fares.  The\r\n\r\nlorry  owners' association, bringing in rice and daily\r\n\r\nnecessities  for  the  people, have  also  thought  of\r\n\r\nincreasing  haulage fees. These increases  in  haulage\r\n\r\nfees  and  in taxi fares will certainly not hit  those\r\n\r\nwho  own the vehicles, but they will usually be passed\r\n\r\non to the consumers. As the Chinese say, \"If the sheep\r\n\r\nwants  more wool, then it has to be pulled out of  its\r\n\r\nown  body.\"  If  the  poor  people  want  more  social\r\n\r\nservices,  then the Government will get the money  for\r\n\r\nthem  out of their own pocket. This method of taxation\r\n\r\nis  not only directed at the people who have money but\r\n\r\nis also directed at those who have to travel by public\r\n\r\nconveyances and who rely on shopkeepers or lorries  to\r\n\r\nsupply  them with food. A newspaper article says  that\r\n\r\nthe  increase in petrol will also affect fishermen who\r\n\r\nuse  motorised  sampans.  It will  also  affect  those\r\n\r\nindustries that have anything to do with petrol. So on\r\n\r\nthis taxation, I find that the Government has again\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplaced  it  on  those people who would  want  to  have\r\n\r\nfacilities from the rich but have now to pay for  them\r\n\r\nout  of their own pocket. On the question of promotion\r\n\r\nof  trade,  the Government has failed. On housing,  it\r\n\r\nhas  not built sufficient houses. On education, it  is\r\n\r\nwell  known  that the people of Singapore  have  never\r\n\r\nbeen  satisfied with what Government has done. So  all\r\n\r\nin  all,  I  find that this last Budget of the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  is  not  at  all a Budget for  the  people.  It\r\n\r\npresents  a programme that is cock-eyed, and one  that\r\n\r\nwill not benefit the people one iota.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I sometimes get\r\n\r\nrather bored when I am travelling in my car, and I try\r\n\r\nto  find  something  to do. One  little  thing  I  did\r\n\r\nrecently was to take a count of the taxis I met on the\r\n\r\nroad.  I think the hon. Member for Serangoon and other\r\n\r\nhon. Members might be interested to know the result. I\r\n\r\ntook a count extending over nine days and over a total\r\n\r\nof  12 trips. These were mostly at rush hours, at 8.30\r\n\r\nin the morning or at 5.30 to 6.00 in the evening which\r\n\r\nare  the  hours when I am going to and from my office.\r\n\r\nThere  were other trips as well. I counted only  those\r\n\r\ntaxis  which were actually in the traffic stream,  not\r\n\r\nparked taxis or taxis at the stands or drawn up by the\r\n\r\nside of the road because the driver was going to get a\r\n\r\ncup  of  coffee.  I found that there  were  334  taxis\r\n\r\ntravelling along with no passengers on board  and  236\r\n\r\nhad  passengers on board. My deduction  from  that  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  236  passengers who  were  travelling  were\r\n\r\npaying not only for their own 2 miles or so, but  they\r\n\r\nwere  going  to pay for the 3 miles during  which  the\r\n\r\nvehicle was travelling empty. If that is true  of  all\r\n\r\ntaxis  in Singapore, then that means, of course,  that\r\n\r\nby  and large, out of every 5 miles they travel, 3 are\r\n\r\nunpaid  miles  during which they are travelling  empty\r\n\r\nlooking for a fare. If that is true - I do not  say  it\r\n\r\nis,  it  is  not a sufficient sample,  but  it  is  an\r\n\r\ninteresting   one -  then  the  taxis   have   a   very\r\n\r\nconsiderable margin which they can still absorb in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  way of taxation before they have to put up  their\r\n\r\nfares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, there is another margin which can well be\r\n\r\nabsorbed by taxis before their fares are driven up  by\r\n\r\nincreased petrol costs, and that of course is the fact\r\n\r\nthat  about  50  per  cent  of  the  taxis  are  still\r\n\r\ncapitalist-owned, for which a worker has to pay a rent\r\n\r\nto  the capitalist. After he has paid the rent, he  is\r\n\r\nthen  free to make his own personal living. The number\r\n\r\nof  taxis has gone up by about 40 per cent. There  are\r\n\r\nroughly  600  more  taxis  on  the  roads  since   the\r\n\r\ndelimitation  which we have secured on taxis.  Of  the\r\n\r\n2,300 operating, I am told that half of them are owner-operated and the other half are still capitalist-owned\r\n\r\nrented ones. The man who rents a taxi, I am told,  has\r\n\r\nto  pay about $10 a day; or $7 or $8 if it is a  night\r\n\r\nrental.  That  means that this $7, $8, or  $10  is  an\r\n\r\navailable  margin which can still be absorbed  by  the\r\n\r\nindustry.  The capitalists can go out of business  and\r\n\r\nsell  their taxis to the good men who are driving them\r\n\r\nand  there is still an ample margin before fares  have\r\n\r\nto  go  up.  At  present, the largest  amount  of  the\r\n\r\nearnings in the industry are going to idle people  who\r\n\r\nare  sitting  back and making a noise. I think  it  is\r\n\r\nhighly  desirable  that we should have  owner-operated\r\n\r\ntaxis  and  I  think, in so far as  this  increase  in\r\n\r\npetrol costs, or diesel costs for that matter, has  an\r\n\r\neffect  on  the taxi industry, it will be to  turn  it\r\n\r\ninto  an owner-operated industry and not a capitalist-controlled one.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not heard much about the diesel-engine tax.\r\n\r\nEveryone seems to think in terms of the petrol engine,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is  worth noting that the diesel  engine  has\r\n\r\nhitherto  had  a  very  marked  favourable  margin  in\r\n\r\ncomparison  with  the petrol engine  in  the  past.  A\r\n\r\ndiesel  motor-car - not many of them, but such as  there\r\n\r\nare - has  been  paying $168 in tax before  compared  to\r\n\r\n$364  paid  by a 14 h.p. petrol car doing  a  thousand\r\n\r\nmiles  a month. That gap is still a wide one with  the\r\n\r\nnew  tax.  The figure is $456 for petrol and $336  for\r\n\r\ndiesel, and there is still a big advantage in having a\r\n\r\ndiesel-engine vehicle if you can get\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none.  The  same  sort of margin applies  to  buses  or\r\n\r\nlorries, but I will not take up the time of the  House\r\n\r\nbecause the debate has already gone on too long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must point out also that in the bus industry - there\r\n\r\nare  some  1,200 vehicles - about two-thirds are  diesel\r\n\r\nbuses  and one-third are petrol buses, and the  diesel\r\n\r\nbuses  have  had  a marked advantage  in  relation  to\r\n\r\npetrol  buses, and still have it after tax. The number\r\n\r\nof  passengers  carried  in buses  is  probably  about\r\n\r\n200,000,000 a year, possibly more, and I do not  think\r\n\r\nthat  the  amount of tax distributed amongst  them  is\r\n\r\ngoing to affect the bus fares.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one little point to make about the lorries,\r\n\r\nand  that  is  that the Registrar of  Vehicles  is  at\r\n\r\npresent unable to impose a load limit on them, so that\r\n\r\nthey do carry very heavy loads for the time being.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to turn, quite briefly, to one or\r\n\r\ntwo  other  points made by Members of the  Opposition.\r\n\r\nOne  of their favourite tricks is to say that we  have\r\n\r\nsaid things which we have not said and then to attempt\r\n\r\nto  shoot us down. Mr Lim Choon Mong remarked of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Commerce that he had said that  all  was\r\n\r\nwell  in industrial development. He did not say  that;\r\n\r\nhe said there had been progress.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr John Ede remarked about myself that I said I had no faith in experts.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> On a point of order, Sir, Is it\r\n\r\nin  order  for the Minister to call an hon.

What I said  was\r\n\r\nthat  when we got experts we had to stick to them.  We\r\n\r\nhave had expert after expert coming in and putting  up\r\n\r\nschemes all of which have been admirable, but they  do\r\n\r\nnot agree with each other, so when we have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  get an expert, we have to work on his advice. This\r\n\r\nsort of misrepresentation is damaging, Sir, because it\r\n\r\nleads  off  into  a  general inaccuracy  of  mind  and\r\n\r\nmisrepresentation  which is carried  to  quite  absurd\r\n\r\nlengths  in  Singapore. We know that  there  are  some\r\n\r\ndifficulties and troubles in Singapore but there are a\r\n\r\ngreat many more signs of hope and prospects of success\r\n\r\nand  it  is  of no service at all to this  country  to\r\n\r\npretend  that  Singapore is a bad place or  a  foolish\r\n\r\nplace or a weak place, because it is not. It is a very\r\n\r\ngood  place  indeed and it is very far ahead  of  many\r\n\r\nother territories in this part of the world, and  even\r\n\r\nof  territories  with a very much  longer  history  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment;  and no service is done to  Singapore  by\r\n\r\nmisrepresentation  of the facts. Particularly  a  very\r\n\r\nbad  case  of  this  is  where  the  hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon - he  has  gone out for his tea - chose  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  trade of Singapore has fallen. It  has  not\r\n\r\nfallen. I will read out the figures to the House\r\n\r\nto get them on the record:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      1954                    $\r\n\r\n                     \r\n\r\n       Imports         3,024,000,000\r\n\r\n                     \r\n\r\n       Exports         2,685,000,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      1955\r\n\r\n                       \r\n\r\n       Imports         3,849,000,000\r\n\r\n                       \r\n\r\n       Exports         3,369,000,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      1956\r\n\r\n                          \r\n\r\n       Imports         3,929,000,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       Exports         3,429,000,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  other words, trade has gone up in value year after\r\n\r\nyear,  $5,700,000,000  in 1954  to  $7,350,000,000  in\r\n\r\n1956.  And when an hon. Member stands up in this House\r\n\r\nand  hopes to get himself quoted in the Press  with  a\r\n\r\ncompletely inaccurate statement that trade has fallen,\r\n\r\nI  regard  it as doing no service at all to  Singapore\r\n\r\nbut  doing considerable harm, because he may find that\r\n\r\nhis  incorrect  figures and views are quoted  and  the\r\n\r\ntruth  is  ignored and the good name of  Singapore  is\r\n\r\ndamaged.  Luckily  I do not think the  words  of  this\r\n\r\nparticular  Member will carry very great  weight  with\r\n\r\nany section of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another attempt was made by the same Member. He\r\n\r\nquoted  various industries - beehoon and oil-milling,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  footwear and so on - and said that the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Commerce  and Industry had not done  much.  Well,\r\n\r\nthere  again  that is a misrepresentation.  What  they\r\n\r\nasked  for of course were protective tariffs, throwing\r\n\r\naway  our  free  port  status in order  to  give  them\r\n\r\nprotection. Well, that is a very big thing to ask for.\r\n\r\nIn  view  of  the fact that Members of the  Opposition\r\n\r\nhave  laid  great stress on the free  port  status  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, they can hardly say that we have been wrong\r\n\r\nin denying the beehoon factories protective tariffs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just some of the points which, I think,\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy  Speaker, ought to be  referred  to.  Even\r\n\r\nthough the hon. Members concerned are not here, I wish\r\n\r\nto  get  them on the record, to see the facts  of  the\r\n\r\ncase are there for those who wish to find them out  in\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I might make one further reference, Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, and that is to the unification of  the\r\n\r\ntransport system. We have in fact been told by one  or\r\n\r\ntwo  Members  of the Opposition that we have  not  yet\r\n\r\nunified   the  transport  system.  There   have   been\r\n\r\ndifficulties  and  delays and I think  the  public  is\r\n\r\nentitled  to know what these difficulties  and  delays\r\n\r\nhave been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am far from having lost my faith in experts. I\r\n\r\nhave  a  transport expert who has been helping  us - Mr\r\n\r\nHawkins - and he was here a year ago. Unfortunately,  he\r\n\r\nfell  sick  early this year and had  to  get  back  to\r\n\r\nEngland for an operation and has not been available to\r\n\r\nus, although he is now restored to health and will  be\r\n\r\navailable, I hope, in the near future. Well that is an\r\n\r\nact  of  a  misfortune  on  which  no  government  can\r\n\r\nprovide. We cannot ensure that an expert whom we  have\r\n\r\nrelied  on  will  not get sudden and  serious  illness\r\n\r\nwhich  may cost him his life; and if he gets  ill,  we\r\n\r\nshall  have to wait till he gets well again before  we\r\n\r\ncan go forward.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor is that last year when I went to\r\n\r\nEngland  one of the points which I managed  to  secure\r\n\r\nwas  an  agreement  by the Singapore Traction  Company\r\n\r\nthat we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  have full access to their records and accounts\r\n\r\nfor   the   purpose   of   getting   an   accountant's\r\n\r\nprofessional  report, so that if  we  consider  taking\r\n\r\nthem  over  we  should be able to  go  ahead  with  an\r\n\r\naccountant's  report  as  a  guide  and  a  basis  for\r\n\r\nnegotiation.  I  got  that  agreement  and   we   then\r\n\r\ndiscussed with them in detail precisely what they were\r\n\r\nmaking  available and what we would do,  with  various\r\n\r\narrangements.  In  February this  year  we  were  able\r\n\r\ndefinitely  to  employ accountants both  here  and  in\r\n\r\nLondon,  and  to  put  them to work  on  the  Traction\r\n\r\nCompany's  accounts. We hoped to have the report  from\r\n\r\nthe   accountants,   I  think  it   was   last   June.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,   for  one  reason  or   another,   the\r\n\r\naccountants have not been able to produce their report\r\n\r\nand  I have still not got it. So there again I had  to\r\n\r\nget  an expert or experts to do the survey of accounts\r\n\r\nand  the experts unfortunately have not yet been  able\r\n\r\nto keep to their due date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, we are operating in Singapore at a time of\r\n\r\nfinancial  stringency with very  great  calls  on  our\r\n\r\ncapital,  and  I  have  been  anxious  to  devise,  if\r\n\r\npossible,  a  method of unifying our transport  system\r\n\r\nwhich  would minimise the amount of capital which  had\r\n\r\nto  be  found  from public funds and  therefore  which\r\n\r\nwould  employ  as  far as possible  private  funds  at\r\n\r\npresent in the industry. This is of course one of  the\r\n\r\npoints  made  in the Hawkins Report, one on  which  we\r\n\r\nhave  been working. I particularly refer at the moment\r\n\r\nto   the  Chinese  Bus  Owners'  Association,  the  12\r\n\r\ncompanies run by Chinese firms of varying sizes. I had\r\n\r\nhoped  very  much  that we should  retain  the  skill,\r\n\r\ncapital and initiative which those Chinese bus  owners\r\n\r\nhave shown in the industry, because if we lose them we\r\n\r\nwill  have to find somebody else - and that is  also  a\r\n\r\ntroublesome and maybe costly business.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, they have not shown any enthusiasm for\r\n\r\nunification  but,  in the process of  negotiation  and\r\n\r\ndiscussion  extending  over a  very  long  period,  we\r\n\r\nfinally - a  little earlier this year, a  month  or  two\r\n\r\nago - got them to agree that they would he unified, they\r\n\r\nwould be prepared\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  amalgamate. We have on the files the general lines\r\n\r\nof  what  they had in their minds and we were  waiting\r\n\r\nfor  further progress on that. But unfortunately I  am\r\n\r\ntold  (I  do not read the Chinese papers myself)  that\r\n\r\nnow  the  President of that Association has  come  out\r\n\r\nwith  a  further  statement  saying  that,  on  second\r\n\r\nthoughts,  he thinks amalgamation would be a  mistake.\r\n\r\nConsequently, I am back where I started. After seeking\r\n\r\nto  get  the co-operation of the bus owners, I am  not\r\n\r\nquite sure where I stand now in relation to them,  and\r\n\r\nit  may  be  that we may have to think again,  and  on\r\n\r\ndifferent lines. As to that again, I cannot  say,  but\r\n\r\nthese  are factors which do not lie under the  control\r\n\r\nof Ministers or the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot control the sickness or health of an expert\r\n\r\nnor,  having  engaged a very highly  reputed  firm  of\r\n\r\naccountants, can I compel production of  a  report  in\r\n\r\ntime;  or  if  not, to get another firm of accountants\r\n\r\nand start all over again; having engaged an expert,  I\r\n\r\nhave  to  stick to him. For these reasons, there  have\r\n\r\nbeen delays. I have wished very much to avoid them and\r\n\r\nI  think  the  House will be interested  to  know  the\r\n\r\nreasons  why  Government has not been  able  to  avoid\r\n\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, Sir, I think the most ignorant speech\r\n\r\nI  have heard this afternoon was the one delivered  by\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member  for Serangoon, who  styles  himself\r\n\r\nleader  of  the  Opposition. I  suppose  the  Liberal-Socialists  can  never  produce  any  better  man   of\r\n\r\ncalibre.  He  went  on attacking  the  Government  for\r\n\r\nfailures, piled on it one criticism after another, and\r\n\r\nsaid that Government had failed to increase trade.  On\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, he failed to tell us how to  increase\r\n\r\ntrade. He failed to give us any constructive means  or\r\n\r\nways by which Government can increase the trade of the\r\n\r\nColony. All he did was to criticise.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also gave us a false impression by saying that\r\n\r\nGovernment  was  not  do, ing its  part  in  providing\r\n\r\nadequate   educational   facilities   for   the   vast\r\n\r\npopulation. He said that Government had no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplan  to  provide  technical education  for  over-aged\r\n\r\nstudents. It is extremely mischievous - I am sorry he is\r\n\r\nnot  here to hear this, although I do not think he has\r\n\r\nthe courage to hear this-it is mischievous to say that\r\n\r\nthere is no plan for over-aged students, or that  they\r\n\r\nare being neglected. Even at the present moment, there\r\n\r\nare   large  numbers  of  over-aged  students  in  the\r\n\r\nschools.  There is no intention to throw them  out  to\r\n\r\nmake space (which would be proper) for children of the\r\n\r\ncorrect  age group, of whom there are many  clamouring\r\n\r\nfor  places.  So long as these over-aged students  can\r\n\r\nmake the grade, they will be allowed to continue,  and\r\n\r\nto  assist  them to make the grade, schools have  been\r\n\r\nasked  to separate them from those of the proper  age,\r\n\r\nso  that  teachers  can pay special attention  to  and\r\n\r\nassist them where there is no need to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is under the Adult Education Council a large\r\n\r\nnumber  of  over-aged students or  young  adults,  who\r\n\r\nreceive  some sort of education. Government  gave  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  a grant of $500,000 this year and I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  this  amount will increase  as  the  need\r\n\r\narises.  There  are evening classes run by  Government\r\n\r\nwhich will cost Government an estimated $360,000  next\r\n\r\nyear.  Recently,  I have noted that  voluntary  bodies\r\n\r\nwant  to  run  night schools or classes for  over-aged\r\n\r\nstudents. I would like to take this opportunity to say\r\n\r\nthat  I  note this with satisfaction and that officers\r\n\r\nin   my  Ministry  will  be  instructed  to  give  all\r\n\r\nassistance to such a scheme which may be submitted for\r\n\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect I want to stress that there is no\r\n\r\nshirking  of  responsibility,  but  Members  must   be\r\n\r\nreminded that Government resources - such as finance and\r\n\r\npersonnel - are limited, and that it will therefore fall\r\n\r\non the shoulders of public-spirited people to come and\r\n\r\nassist Government in this gigantic task.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of school buildings, I think it was\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member for Tanglin who said that Government\r\n\r\ndid  not  provide  any technical  education  to  fight\r\n\r\nCommunism, and that only one technical school had been\r\n\r\nbuilt. Well, two technical schools have been operating\r\n\r\nfor a year now. I wish to remind\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Member that during our term of office, 54 primary\r\n\r\nschools  have  been built, as against  42  during  the\r\n\r\nperiod  between 1949 and 1954. And of 12 new secondary\r\n\r\nschool buildings planned, some have been completed and\r\n\r\nothers  will be completed within the next  12  months.\r\n\r\nThe peak for secondary school buildings has yet to  be\r\n\r\nreached,  but  it  will not be  long  before  the  big\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  post-war primary school  population\r\n\r\nwill be felt.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the biggest challenge is provision of\r\n\r\nmore schools for Chinese education. The Government  is\r\n\r\ncommitted  to this and will see it through.  The  next\r\n\r\nfour secondary school buildings completed will be used\r\n\r\nto  house the present four Government Chinese middle\r\n\r\nschools.  Indeed,  two of the four have  already  been\r\n\r\ncompleted and will be used next month.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten-year plan, augmented by the previous five-year plan, is based on the need of the English schools\r\n\r\nsystem.  Now that the full grant-in-aid scheme  is  in\r\n\r\noperation  and  Government  is  committed  to  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation side by side with English, Malay and  Tamil,\r\n\r\nI  can  assure the House that a new phase in  planning\r\n\r\nhas begun and that this will be pursued vigorously  by\r\n\r\nmy Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acting Chief Secretary (Mr S. T. \\): Sir,\r\n\r\nI do not propose to take up the time of this House for\r\n\r\nmore  than a few minutes but I would like to touch  on\r\n\r\none or two points which has arisen out of the debate.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one is in connection with Malayanisation.\r\n\r\nI think when the hon. Member for Kampong Kapor touched\r\n\r\non it, he was under the impression that an officer, on\r\n\r\nbeing  promoted  to  a  higher post,  can,  under  the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation scheme, retire with higher compensation\r\n\r\nafter  occupying that post for just more  than  a  few\r\n\r\nmonths. For the purpose of clarification, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to point out the fact that if an entitled officer\r\n\r\nis  promoted, it does not necessarily mean an increase\r\n\r\nin his compensation. Officers are required to serve in\r\n\r\na  promotion  post for a minimum period of  two  years\r\n\r\ninclusive of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleave  before they are entitled to compensation based\r\n\r\non the salary of the higher promotion post.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, reference was made this morning to the present\r\n\r\nproblem  of  crime and gangsterism in Singapore.  The\r\n\r\npolice, Sir, have already taken certain steps in this\r\n\r\ndirection, but I am sure its work in combating  crime\r\n\r\nand gangsterism can be made much more effective if it\r\n\r\nreceives    an   increasing   measure   of   support,\r\n\r\ninformation and co-operation, from the public. I  can\r\n\r\nassure the House that the Government is giving active\r\n\r\nconsideration   to  other  measures   to   meet   the\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the hon. Member for Serangoon touched on the\r\n\r\nneed  to  expend money on our regular  Battalions.  I\r\n\r\nthink the short answer to that, Sir, is that we  must\r\n\r\nhave our local forces; we would like to have them  to\r\n\r\nsupport  the  police  in maintaining  law  and  order\r\n\r\nshould the need arise.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the hon. Member for Changi seemed to have\r\n\r\nadopted  the attitude that in this H-bomb and sputnik\r\n\r\nage,  we  should not bother about defence at  all.  I\r\n\r\nthink  this attitude would be all right, Sir,  if  we\r\n\r\ncould  get an undertaking from all potential  enemies\r\n\r\nthat  they would never attack us except with an  all-annihilating H-bomb! As well say, 'Why bother to  buy\r\n\r\nand  carry a payong? It would be no good if  you  are\r\n\r\nstruck  by lightning!' Yet a payong will protect  you\r\n\r\ncompletely  from  light showers  and,  to  a  limited\r\n\r\nextent, from the heaviest rain.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the truth, Sir, is that, unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthere  are many forms of warfare and aggression short\r\n\r\nof  all-out attack with the most devastating weapons.\r\n\r\nI  think the atomic and hydrogen bombs, Sir, have not\r\n\r\nlessened   the   destructive   force   of   what   is\r\n\r\neuphemistically called conventional high  explosives;\r\n\r\nand  nuclear weapons can be used in a tactical  (that\r\n\r\nis  limited objective) as well as strategic (that  is\r\n\r\nblanketing) role. And whilst Singapore wishes nothing\r\n\r\nbut  peace to all, Sir, we must have local forces  to\r\n\r\nsupport our police in maintaining law and order\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithin  our borders which (Singapore being an island)\r\n\r\ninclude large tracts of sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin, in the course of a rather feeble effort\r\n\r\nto  belittle the achievements of Government,, amongst\r\n\r\nother  things suggested that the Coalition Government\r\n\r\nhas  not achieved anything in combating tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nI  think he picked on TB because our achievements  in\r\n\r\npractically all fields have been so substantial  that\r\n\r\nhe  could  not think of anything else,  but  even  in\r\n\r\nthis,  his appreciation of the true situation  is  in\r\n\r\nerror.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conquest of TB is not one of those things which\r\n\r\ncan be achieved overnight. Tuberculosis has been with\r\n\r\nmankind  for as long as history can recall.  Even  in\r\n\r\ncountries where medical facilities and advances  have\r\n\r\nbeen  considerable, it has taken a very long time  to\r\n\r\ncome to a state where the incidence of the disease is\r\n\r\nunder control.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I assumed office, what was the situation in\r\n\r\nregard  to TB? A small body of hard-working men  were\r\n\r\ntrying to cope with the demands of thousands,  in  a\r\n\r\nhospital  which could not accommodate more  than  500\r\n\r\npersons,  and a part of which was for the chronically\r\n\r\nsick  other  than TB. I refer to the  Tan  Tock  Seng\r\n\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position is very much otherwise today, Sir. The\r\n\r\nbed  accommodation has been increased to nearly 1,000\r\n\r\nand,  before the first half of next year is over,  we\r\n\r\nwill see a further increase of another 400 beds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the school medical service's has\r\n\r\nexpanded   its   programme  of  contact-tracing   and\r\n\r\ndetection  of  cases  amongst  pupils  and  teachers.\r\n\r\nSubstantial  financial assistance, far in  excess  of\r\n\r\nthat  which  the  previous  Government  provided   or\r\n\r\nthought  of  providing, has been  made  available  to\r\n\r\nanother  body which is attempting to combat  TB,  and\r\n\r\nthat is the Royal Singapore Tuberculosis Association.\r\n\r\nGovernment is also making a contribution towards  the\r\n\r\ncapital  expenditure of a hospital  which  SATA  will\r\n\r\nmanage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, under the Colombo Plan, we have come to\r\n\r\narrangements  with the Australian Government  for  the\r\n\r\ninitiation of a case-finding programme. That programme\r\n\r\nwill develop and soon become a reality. Registrars and\r\n\r\nradiographers have been trained overseas, officers  to\r\n\r\nman  it  have  been appointed, the unit is  ready  and\r\n\r\nAustralia  will  be able, I am told (unless  something\r\n\r\nabsolutely   unforeseen  develops)  to  initiate   the\r\n\r\nprogramme here in the second half of 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest to you, Sir, that these are not small\r\n\r\nachievements. They are real achievements  when  viewed\r\n\r\nagainst  the  background  of  indifference  which  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the former Progressive Party who  adorned\r\n\r\nthe  Legislative Council, displayed over and again,  a\r\n\r\nsprinkling  of  whom I see today, who have  made  vain\r\n\r\nattempts  to  grasp  power, and who  have  lost  their\r\n\r\nidentity  in a marriage with lion dancers  and  former\r\n\r\nindependent capitalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr T.

One  was  criticism  of  the  method   of\r\n\r\npresentation  and  compilation of the  Estimates;  the\r\n\r\nsecond  was  criticism  of the  measures  of  taxation\r\n\r\nproposed; and the third was general criticism  of  the\r\n\r\npolicies of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the first, Sir-criticisms of the\r\n\r\nmethod   of  presentation  and  compilation   of   the\r\n\r\nBudget-colonial  officials were accused  by  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar of inefficiency and worse.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not think I need reply to this criticism, Sir.

The form in which they are  presented  has\r\n\r\nstood  the  test of time. It has been  used  for  many\r\n\r\nyears.  It  has been shaped and amended as  conditions\r\n\r\nhave  demanded, and I think it does represent the best\r\n\r\npossible  way  of  presenting  the  Estimates   of   a\r\n\r\nGovernment under the present Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is extraordinarily difficult, Sir, to estimate\r\n\r\nactual  expenditure  with any degree  of  accuracy  in\r\n\r\nconditions   of   an  expanding  economy   and   where\r\n\r\ndepartments  are  growing  rapidly.  We   take   every\r\n\r\npossible step to ensure that nothing is entered in the\r\n\r\nEstimates  which  is not required  for  the  efficient\r\n\r\nconduct   of   Government   business   and   for   the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of plans for the expansion  of  social\r\n\r\nservices, but it is difficult if not impossible to say\r\n\r\nwhat  will  be spent in the event. If I may  take  the\r\n\r\nexample of Personal Emoluments, Sir, we examine  every\r\n\r\napplication  for  new appointments with  extreme  care\r\n\r\nbecause,  if  approved,  not  only  will  it  mean  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in Government expenditure for the period  of\r\n\r\nthe  officer's service, but it will also increase  the\r\n\r\nbill  for pensions. We examine these applications with\r\n\r\nvery  great  care and we only enter in  the  Estimates\r\n\r\nthose new appointments which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  required for the efficient conduct of Government\r\n\r\nbusiness.  But  we cannot say when  we  make  up  the\r\n\r\nEstimates  how many of the new posts will be  filled,\r\n\r\nwhat will be the state of the recruitment market, how\r\n\r\nmany  officers will be promoted to vacant  posts,  or\r\n\r\nwhen  they  will  be promoted, or what  savings  will\r\n\r\neventuate at the end of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly in the case of Other Charges Annually\r\n\r\nRecurrent  and Other Charges Special Expenditure,  we\r\n\r\nmay provide recurrent expenditure for a new launch or\r\n\r\na  new  building,  or some similar service,  but  the\r\n\r\nlaunch  or building may not be completed on  schedule\r\n\r\nand  savings result. I think Sir, that explains  how\r\n\r\nthese savings do occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, of course, a solution of the kind whereby\r\n\r\nover-estimating  might  be  avoided.  It   might   be\r\n\r\npossible  to make a very rough guess under each  head\r\n\r\nof  expenditure of what under-expenditure might be at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  the year, and then make a corresponding\r\n\r\ndeduction from the total of that head. But that is  a\r\n\r\npurely arbitrary approach to the matter, Sir, and any\r\n\r\nguess made in that way is as likely to prove wrong as\r\n\r\nto prove right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally prefer the course which we have\r\n\r\nfollowed for many years in Singapore. That is to  let\r\n\r\nthe Estimates stand and then to try, on the basis  of\r\n\r\nexperience and the record of the past, to  give  some\r\n\r\nestimate of what actual expenditure is likely  to  be\r\n\r\nwhen presenting the Budget. That is what we have done\r\n\r\nin  the past, Sir, and what I have done this year.  I\r\n\r\nhave endeavoured, on the basis of past experience, to\r\n\r\nestimate  what actual expenditure for 1958  will  be,\r\n\r\nand  I think that my estimates will not be very  wide\r\n\r\nof  the mark. I cannot believe, Sir, that this  is  a\r\n\r\nglib presentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may continue, Sir, on the subject of the speech\r\n\r\nof  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar, he  touched  on  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  Malayanisation which I think  illustrated\r\n\r\nvery  clearly his facile manner of speech. He said - if\r\n\r\nmy  memory  serves me right - that the total  bill  for\r\n\r\nMalayanisation, taking this at $25 million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  take  approximately 200 years to wipe  off.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to refer him to the Interim Report of  the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Commission and to Chapter VI which  is\r\n\r\nentitled the \"Financial Aspect\", in which he will see\r\n\r\nthat  the  members of the Commission estimated  that,\r\n\r\nwhen  Malayanisation  was complete,  the  savings  on\r\n\r\nexpatriation  pay,  passages  and  allowances   would\r\n\r\namount  to  approximately $34 million per year.  That\r\n\r\nbeing  so,  the  total cost of Malayanisation  would,\r\n\r\naccording to my calculations, be wiped off  within  a\r\n\r\nperiod of eight years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also made, Sir, some rather facile\r\n\r\nreferences  to  income tax, to the inability  of  the\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax  Department to collect tax, and  he  also\r\n\r\nmade what I regard as rather facile suggestions as to\r\n\r\nhow we might collect $108 million in a full year.  He\r\n\r\nquickly  passed from the matter - perhaps  he  did  not\r\n\r\nhave  time to explain how it could be achieved - but  I\r\n\r\nhope,  Sir, that before the matter comes  up  in  the\r\n\r\nCommittee of Supply he will give me an opportunity to\r\n\r\nconsider   his   suggestion   by   showing   me   his\r\n\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Minister responsible for the Department of Income\r\n\r\nTax,  I  must  protest  most vigorously  against  the\r\n\r\naccusations which are constantly levelled against it.\r\n\r\nThe  Department has been in existence  for  a  little\r\n\r\nmore than nine years. It now collects 27 per cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  revenue  of  the  Colony.  I  am  satisfied,  on\r\n\r\ninvestigations which I myself have made in connection\r\n\r\nwith  criticisms made in this Assembly, that most  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  who are liable to tax are known  to  the\r\n\r\nDepartment. To assess 20,000 individuals in  a  year,\r\n\r\n60,000  cases  are examined. As I say, Sir,  I  think\r\n\r\nthat  most  of the people who are liable to  tax  are\r\n\r\nknown to the Department. It is, however, an extremely\r\n\r\ndifficult matter, in a complex society such  as  that\r\n\r\nof Singapore, to make certain that everybody pays the\r\n\r\namount of tax which he is liable to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Sir, in the matter of the assessment and\r\n\r\ncollection of tax, we have been hampered to a certain\r\n\r\nextent   by  the  fact  that  the  officers  of   the\r\n\r\nDepartment started as it were from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscratch  in  1948. But we have, over a  period  of  9\r\n\r\nyears,  Sir,  built  up what  I  regard  as  a  quite\r\n\r\nextraordinary volume of experience in tax  assessment\r\n\r\nand   collection.  And  I  am  confident   that   the\r\n\r\nefficiency  of  the Department will increase  and  as\r\n\r\nthis  efficiency  increases, so  the  amount  of  tax\r\n\r\ncollected will increase, and the number of evaders of\r\n\r\ntax be substantially reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing now, Sir, to the question of taxation, it\r\n\r\nhas  been suggested that this was an election  Budget\r\n\r\nand  I would like to deny this most stoutly. The fact\r\n\r\nof  the  matter is that, on my calculations, no  more\r\n\r\nthan  $8  million  will be required  to  balance  the\r\n\r\nactual  expenditure and revenue next year.  Had  more\r\n\r\nbeen   required,  the  Government  would   not   have\r\n\r\nhesitated to impose further taxation. I would like to\r\n\r\nmake that quite clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also suggested, Sir, that in choosing petrol,\r\n\r\nwe were following the lead of the Federation. That of\r\n\r\ncourse  is not correct. It was stated when presenting\r\n\r\nthe   Budget  for  1956  that  the  policy  of   this\r\n\r\nGovernment wherever items in the tariffs of  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories  coincided, was to  bring  the  rates  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  the  same  level  as  those   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation.  The  necessity for  such  action  is  of\r\n\r\ncourse  obvious  and  I  need not  elaborate  to  any\r\n\r\nextent.  The existence of different rates of  tax  in\r\n\r\nthe    two    territories   creates    administrative\r\n\r\ndifficulties  and results in a considerable  loss  of\r\n\r\nrevenue.  It  was said by, I think,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  (Mr Lee Choon Eng) that it  would  be  a\r\n\r\nvery  good  thing  if, for a change,  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment followed the Government of Singapore but I\r\n\r\nwould  point  out that this has indeed happened  this\r\n\r\nyear. The Government of the Federation of Malaya  has\r\n\r\nraised  its rate of estate duty to the same level  as\r\n\r\nthat of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the increase in petrol duty, we\r\n\r\nwent  into this with very great care, Sir, and  quite\r\n\r\napart  from the desirability of having the same  rate\r\n\r\nhere  as in the Federation, we are convinced that  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  20  cents  per gallon  would  cause  no\r\n\r\nhardship to any category of society in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain remarks were made during the course of the\r\n\r\ndebate on the statement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  I made in my speech, and which my hon, friend\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Commerce and Industry made  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech,, to the effect that import duties  might  be\r\n\r\nimposed  in Singapore. I would however like  to  draw\r\n\r\nattention to the fact that I merely mentioned this as\r\n\r\na  possibility  which would only be considered  after\r\n\r\nall  other  possible means of increasing revenue  had\r\n\r\nbeen explored - you might say, as a last resort. As  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  I  hope  sincerely  that  it  will  never   be\r\n\r\nnecessary  to impose import duties and thus undermine\r\n\r\nthe free port status of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy)\r\n\r\nexpressed a desire that all possible steps should  be\r\n\r\ntaken  to  reduce expenditure and I can  only  assure\r\n\r\nhim, as I did when presenting the Budget, that we are\r\n\r\nvery  conscious  of  the need.  It  is  our  constant\r\n\r\npreoccupation,  Sir, to take every possible  step  to\r\n\r\nreduce  expenditure. We examine  every  proposal  for\r\n\r\nincreased expenditure and new appointments with  very\r\n\r\ngreat care and I think that most heads of departments\r\n\r\nwill  agree  that it is an extremely hard  matter  to\r\n\r\npersuade  the  Treasury that any new  appointment  or\r\n\r\nincreased expenditure is essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on the question of the general policies of\r\n\r\nGovernment, attention has been drawn to the fact that\r\n\r\nI  said  that it was idle to deny that confidence  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  was less at the moment than  it  had  been\r\n\r\nprior  to  1955. I should point out that my statement\r\n\r\nreferred to the fact that events in 1955 and  in  the\r\n\r\nearly  part of 1956 had done much to destroy external\r\n\r\nconfidence  in the future of Singapore. What  I  also\r\n\r\nsaid  in  my  speech, Sir - and here I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nspeak,  if I may, as a colonial official - was that  a\r\n\r\nfeature of the last two years was the extent to which\r\n\r\nconfidence in Singapore has been restored by the  Lim\r\n\r\nYew  Hock Government. This has been due to the  quiet\r\n\r\nand   commonsense  approach  to  all   economic   and\r\n\r\nfinancial matters which has characterized its work. I\r\n\r\nwould like to stress that I speak not as a politician\r\n\r\nbut  as a civil servant of some years experience.  We\r\n\r\nare  all  aware that Singapore has been built  up  by\r\n\r\ntrade, that the future of Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndepends  on trade, that trade cannot exist or flourish\r\n\r\nunless   there   is   confidence  in   the   policies,\r\n\r\norganisation  and the constitution  of  the  place  in\r\n\r\nwhich trade takes place. Traders must be certain  that\r\n\r\ntheir contracts will be honoured and that, if they are\r\n\r\nnot  honoured, they can obtain redress in the  courts.\r\n\r\nIt  is  with these facts in mind that I say  that  the\r\n\r\nefforts  of  this  Government in connection  with  the\r\n\r\nsuppression of subversion, and the action which it has\r\n\r\ntaken to pursue commonsense and realistic economic and\r\n\r\nfinancial policies, have done a very, very great  deal\r\n\r\nto restore confidence in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend the Minister for Commerce and Industry\r\n\r\nspoke  at  considerable  length  on  the  question  of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. On this particular  point,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nmust  congratulate the Member for Telok Ayer  (Mr  R.\r\n\r\nJumabhoy)  for setting out so succinctly  the  various\r\n\r\nconditions  which have to be fulfilled if industry  is\r\n\r\nto flourish in Singapore. As for the criticisms of the\r\n\r\naction of the Government in this matter, I think these\r\n\r\nhave  been  answered very fully by  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommerce, but I would like to say, Sir, before I leave\r\n\r\nthis particular subject, that we should free our minds\r\n\r\nfrom  any  misapprehensions  about  this  question  of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation of Singapore. Industrialise we must,\r\n\r\nbut  it  must  be  realised that our  main  source  of\r\n\r\nlivelihood  has  always been and  always  will  remain\r\n\r\ntrade,  and  industry can only be at the very  best  a\r\n\r\nsecond line of defence. All this talk about industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion must not be allowed to distract the minds of\r\n\r\nour   traders   from   what   must   be   their   main\r\n\r\npreoccupation, that is, the prosecution of  trade  and\r\n\r\nthe  preservation of their ability to be  competitive,\r\n\r\nto  offer  immediately  the  best  possible  terms  to\r\n\r\nanybody  who  comes  to  buy  or  sell  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSingapore can never be a Birmingham. We will never see\r\n\r\na  pall of smoke above Singapore indicating a range of\r\n\r\nfactories  turning  out  manufactured  goods.  We  are\r\n\r\nalready  fairly  highly  industrialised  in  an  Asian\r\n\r\ncontext. There are very few places in Asia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  are more heavily industrialised than we are  at\r\n\r\nthe   moment,   and  any  expansion  of  industry   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, as I see it, can only be by small  advances\r\n\r\nalong  the  very  wide  existing  range  of  secondary\r\n\r\nindustries. We cannot hope for steel mills  or  thread\r\n\r\nmills or anything like that on a highly industrialised\r\n\r\nscale.  What  we  can hope for is the  replacement  of\r\n\r\nexisting   machinery   by   better   machinery,    the\r\n\r\nreorganisation of the capital structure of the  family\r\n\r\nfirm  to  allow  expansion,  the  employment  of  more\r\n\r\ncapable  managers and the examination and exploitation\r\n\r\nof  overseas markets. But that could amount to a  very\r\n\r\ngreat deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Mr Sutherland touched upon the question of\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Bank. As I explained in my  speech  when\r\n\r\npresenting  the Budget, this matter is sub  judice  at\r\n\r\nthe  present time. I should say quite clearly  however\r\n\r\nthat  it is the concern of the Government of Singapore\r\n\r\nto  preserve  a  stable, strong and  an  automatically\r\n\r\nconvertible  currency,  because  a  currency  of  that\r\n\r\nnature is vital to Singapore as a trading centre,  and\r\n\r\nI  may  say  that we are prepared to go to very  great\r\n\r\nlengths indeed to achieve the aim. I hope that, in the\r\n\r\nfuture,  it  will be possible to reach some compromise\r\n\r\nwhereby,  over a period of time, we can,  on  the  one\r\n\r\nside, learn to appreciate the value of a Central  Bank\r\n\r\nand  on the other side learn to appreciate to the full\r\n\r\nthe great advantages of a currency such as we have  at\r\n\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I  must\r\n\r\nadmit  that I was very dissatisfied with the  replies\r\n\r\ngiven  and  at  that  time  I  considered  that   any\r\n\r\nsupplementary Question to those replies  would  serve\r\n\r\nvery little purpose because I would not be allowed to\r\n\r\nelaborate on my Questions. So the only course left to\r\n\r\nme  was to claim the right to speak on this matter on\r\n\r\nthe  motion  for adjournment and I have now  obtained\r\n\r\nthis right.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I will deal with the restriction of hours\r\n\r\nwithin the city limits for learner-drivers. The hours\r\n\r\nthat  are restricted are from 8.00 a.m. to 9.30 a.m.,\r\n\r\nfrom  12.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. and from 4.30  p.m. to\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m. Sir, these hours happen to be the best\r\n\r\nhours  for  a  working man to learn  driving  because\r\n\r\nthese are the hours during which a working man can be\r\n\r\nfree.  Apart from these hours, a working man has  got\r\n\r\nto  be  at his office from 9 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. So  if\r\n\r\nthe hours outside 9 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. are restricted,\r\n\r\nthere  will not be a good chance for a man  to  learn\r\n\r\nhow  to  drive.  So  is it then  desirable  that  the\r\n\r\nlearner  should learn how to drive after dusk because\r\n\r\nif  he leaves his office at 4.30 p.m. and there is no\r\n\r\nchance  for him to learn between 4.30 p.m. and  6.30\r\n\r\np.m., which time is restricted, the only time that he\r\n\r\ncan learn is after dusk? Is it then desirable that  a\r\n\r\nlearner should learn driving when it is just about to\r\n\r\nbecome dark? Now, as a learner, he\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  new to the wheel; that is number one. He is  new\r\n\r\nto  road sense; that is number two. And, Sir,  he  is\r\n\r\nnew to all the Jaws of the Road Traffic Ordinance. At\r\n\r\nthe  same time, he may have loss of judgment at dusk.\r\n\r\nSo  where is the chance for him to actually learn how\r\n\r\nto  drive?  I  do  appreciate that these  restriction\r\n\r\nhours are for the purposes of restricting people from\r\n\r\nlearning to drive cars within the congested areas  or\r\n\r\nin the heart of the town. Certainly, Sir, I would not\r\n\r\nencourage a learner to drive in Raffles Place,  North\r\n\r\nBridge   Road  or  South  Bridge  Road   during   the\r\n\r\nrestricted  hours because I do agree that  all  these\r\n\r\nplaces are congested with traffic and it is not  only\r\n\r\nundesirable  and  risky to the life of  the  learner-driver  but  also  to  the lives  of  the  public.  I\r\n\r\ncertainly agree, but what I am saying is this:  I  am\r\n\r\nasking  the  Minister to consider  that,  apart  from\r\n\r\nthese  congested  streets, whether  there  are  other\r\n\r\nstreets within the city limits that are not congested\r\n\r\nwithin the restricted hours. The area within the city\r\n\r\nlimits covers an area of about 39.6 square miles.  Is\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to suggest to this House  that  within\r\n\r\nthis  39.6 square miles every street within this area\r\n\r\nis  congested  with traffic during all hours  of  the\r\n\r\nday?  I  doubt it very much, Sir. Take, for instance,\r\n\r\nAlexandra  Road which is in the division I represent.\r\n\r\nI  find very little traffic at any time on that road.\r\n\r\nAgain,  Sir, I do not find that there is much traffic\r\n\r\non  Holland  Road during the restricted  or  ordinary\r\n\r\nhours.  Now Farrer Road is another road which  I  may\r\n\r\nquote on which you cannot find heavy traffic at  all;\r\n\r\nalso Pasir Panjang Road which is a straight road  and\r\n\r\nis very good for a learner to drive for a distance of\r\n\r\nabout  5  to 8 miles or so. All these roads  are  not\r\n\r\ncongested at all and why then should we restrict them\r\n\r\nwithin  the city limits during certain hours? Now  if\r\n\r\nwe  relax  the  question  of restricted  hours  on  a\r\n\r\ncertain  number of streets, only then will a  learner\r\n\r\nbe able to have the chance of driving much earlier to\r\n\r\noffice - he  could start much earlier than 9 a.m.,  say\r\n\r\nat about 7.30 a.m. - and on the way down he can have  a\r\n\r\nchance to learn driving. At the same time when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  leaves his office at 4.30 p.m. to go home, he will\r\n\r\nalso  have the chance to learn from 4.30 p.m. to  just\r\n\r\nbefore dusk, say 6.30 p.m. or 7.00 p.m. Why should  we\r\n\r\nrestrict  the hours for driving on the streets  within\r\n\r\nthe  city limits which are not congested at all?  This\r\n\r\nis  one  of  the things in which I think the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment has not followed the Federation Government.\r\n\r\nFor  all purposes, the Singapore Government says  that\r\n\r\nwe must follow the Federation Government. As far as  I\r\n\r\nunderstand, Sir, there is no such restriction  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  So  if  in  everything  we   follow   the\r\n\r\nFederation,  why  should  we  also  not   follow   the\r\n\r\nFederation  on  this question of restriction?  I  also\r\n\r\nunderstand, Sir, that in a big city like London, there\r\n\r\nis  no  question of restriction at all, and I am  sure\r\n\r\nthat within the City of London there are more vehicles\r\n\r\nthan we have in Singapore. Although Singapore may be a\r\n\r\nsmall  little  island  with  the  number  of  vehicles\r\n\r\nregistered now having a new serial lettering  \"SS\",  I\r\n\r\nthink  that  London  must be a far  busier  city  than\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not asking the Government to lift the ban\r\n\r\naltogether.  What I am only suggesting is  this,  that\r\n\r\nGovernment should consider making or make a survey  of\r\n\r\nall  the streets within city limits and then ascertain\r\n\r\nwhich  streets are really congested with traffic - as  I\r\n\r\nhave  said,  Raffles Place, South Bridge  Road.  North\r\n\r\nBridge  Road and so on. Have a survey to find  out  if\r\n\r\nthese  streets are actually congested; then  in  other\r\n\r\nstreets   that  are  not  congested,  let   us   relax\r\n\r\nrestrictions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here, Sir, a letter from the Hon. the\r\n\r\nMinister for Communications and Works addressed to the\r\n\r\nPresident    of   the   Singapore   Driving    Schools\r\n\r\nAssociation,  and  with  your permission,  I  quote  a\r\n\r\nparagraph from it:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Although I am bound in consideration of the general\r\n\r\ninterests   of  the  public  to  refuse  to   consider\r\n\r\nwholesale   lifting  of  these  restrictions,   I   am\r\n\r\nsympathetic to the needs of the driving schools and am\r\n\r\nanxious that they should improve their service,\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Minister is really sympathetic to this\r\n\r\nmove,  but he says that \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the interests of the public\r\n\r\nhe  is  not prepared to consider the wholesale lifting\r\n\r\nof  restrictions.  I am not asking for  any  wholesale\r\n\r\nlifting of the restriction, Sir. What I am asking  for\r\n\r\nis  that  the Minister consider relaxing the ban,  the\r\n\r\nrestriction,  on some streets which are not  congested\r\n\r\nwith  traffic.  As the Minister has said  that  he  is\r\n\r\nreally  sympathetic, I hope that he will  consider  my\r\n\r\nrequest  and make a survey of all the streets  whether\r\n\r\nthey  are  congested or not, and then  accede  to  the\r\n\r\nrequest I have just made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is that of licence fees. I see\r\n\r\nthat tuition cars must be charged double fees compared\r\n\r\nwith   those  of  privately  owned  cars.   I   cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand  this discrimination between a tuition  car\r\n\r\nand  a privately-owned one. There is no difference  at\r\n\r\nall  because  a tuition car is as much a  car  as  the\r\n\r\nprivately  owned.  Both are of the  same  category  of\r\n\r\nvehicle whatever their horse powers may be.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, Sir, that the driving schools that\r\n\r\nbelong  to  this Association charge the  same  tuition\r\n\r\nrate  irrespective of whether a learner uses  his  own\r\n\r\nprivate  car  or  one from a school belonging  to  the\r\n\r\nAssociation. What is the difference then, Sir? Even if\r\n\r\na  learner provides his own car, he pays the same rate\r\n\r\nfor  tuition that he will have to pay if he uses a car\r\n\r\nfrom a school. There is no difference at all.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is there to prevent me teaching my children to\r\n\r\ndrive?  Will you consider me a professional instructor\r\n\r\nand charge my car double fees? I do not think so, Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause I have already taught my son how to drive  and\r\n\r\nI have not been charged double fees. Is the Government\r\n\r\ngoing  to  do so now? I may go further, Sir,  and  say\r\n\r\nthat even a Minister in this House has used his car to\r\n\r\nteach  his wife to drive. Are we going to charge  that\r\n\r\nMinister  double tax on his car? Are we going  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  he  should pay double tax on his car as  on  one\r\n\r\nwhich  is used for tuition? His car has been used  for\r\n\r\ntuition; it comes under the category of a tuition car;\r\n\r\nthen  why not charge it double tax? if not, why should\r\n\r\nwe victimise all these instructors?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should relax all these restrictions and\r\n\r\nimpositions,  and  see  that we  give  the  same  fair\r\n\r\ntreatment  to  everyone.  If  not,  Sir,  we  will  be\r\n\r\nencouraging illegal driving schools because  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing to prevent an ordinary car owner using his car\r\n\r\nfor  tuition purposes, as long as he does not use  the\r\n\r\nword \"school\". He has a privately-owned car and he can\r\n\r\nteach  on  it  without  paying  double  fees.  Is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment trying to encourage illegal driving schools\r\n\r\nthen?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there anything to differentiate between a tuition\r\n\r\ncar  and  a privately-owned one, or has the Government\r\n\r\nregistered   all  cars  used  for  tuition?   Has   it\r\n\r\nregistered all such cars and said that they are solely\r\n\r\nused  for the purpose of tuition and nothing else?  If\r\n\r\nit  has, then by all means charge double fees; if not,\r\n\r\nthere  should be no differentiation or discrimination.\r\n\r\nThere  is no registration to prove what a car is  used\r\n\r\nfor.  How  then  can we call one owner a  professional\r\n\r\ninstructor and another an amateur? I cannot see why we\r\n\r\nshould penalise one man and let go the other.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After tuition hours, Sir, a car used for tuition\r\n\r\nwill  be  used  by  its  owner  for  his  own  private\r\n\r\npurposes. Where is the difference? He uses his car for\r\n\r\nhis  own  pleasure and not for tuition  after  tuition\r\n\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point, Sir, is the Minister's reply to my\r\n\r\nquestion whether an instructor is allowed to accompany\r\n\r\na  learner  while  out on test. His reply  was  rather\r\n\r\nvague, I might say. With your permission, Sir, I  will\r\n\r\nquote his reply the other day, printed in column  2815\r\n\r\nof the Official Report:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As an instructor myself I learn the faults of my\r\n\r\npupils when I am instructing them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister concerned happens to be an ex-school master. I do not know whether he was drawing\r\n\r\nfrom  his experience as a schoolmaster or as a driving\r\n\r\ninstructor.  If he was drawing from his experience  on\r\n\r\nhow to drive cars, I am surprised to know that one  of\r\n\r\nour Ministers is also concurrently minister of driving\r\n\r\ninstruction!  Can  a Minister hold  two  appointments,\r\n\r\nSir?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with him that as a schoolmaster he learns\r\n\r\nthe faults of his pupils\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhilst he instructs them, but teaching how to drive is\r\n\r\nentirely  different  from checking  his  pupils  in  a\r\n\r\nclassroom.   In   the  class,  the  schoolmaster   has\r\n\r\nexamination papers to guide him. At the end of a  term\r\n\r\nor   a   certain   period,  the  pupil  undergoes   an\r\n\r\nexamination.  The  examination  papers  come  up,  the\r\n\r\ninstructor  or  schoolmaster checks the answer  papers\r\n\r\nand finds out the faults of his pupils. With a driving\r\n\r\ninstructor, it is all practical work, so if faults are\r\n\r\nmade  by  a  learner  whilst  out  on  test  and   his\r\n\r\ninstructor is not present, how can the latter find out\r\n\r\nthe  faults  of  his pupil? The instructor,  from  his\r\n\r\nimpressions after coaching a learner for a few months,\r\n\r\nfeels,  or  is confident that his pupil can  pass  the\r\n\r\ntest. But what happens when the pupil does go on test?\r\n\r\nThe instructor is not allowed to accompany him and the\r\n\r\nlatter fails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the present system of tests is most\r\n\r\nundemocratic  because you are not allowed  to  appeal.\r\n\r\nAll the faults of the learner are not known to anybody\r\n\r\nexcept  the tester. Now, Sir, may I say that it  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter   of  opinion - a  term  always  used   in   this\r\n\r\nAssembly - whether the learner has passed  the  test  or\r\n\r\nnot.  The instructor feels that his pupil learner  can\r\n\r\npass  but  the tester feels that he cannot. So  it  is\r\n\r\njust a matter of opinion and there must be a board  or\r\n\r\nsome body to which the learner can appeal against  the\r\n\r\ndecision of the tester.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more point, Sir, is that if the tester does not\r\n\r\nlike the face of the learner when he presents himself,\r\n\r\nhe  may  say,  \"I do not like to see your  face\",  and\r\n\r\nhowever good that learner may be, the tester may  say,\r\n\r\n\"I  am  sorry,  young boy, because I do not  like  the\r\n\r\nface\" - he  says it privately to himself, not  openly - \"I\r\n\r\nam afraid I have to fail you.\" This is not fair, Sir.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an instructor brings a pupil to the traffic\r\n\r\npolice, the instructor ought to go on the test and  so\r\n\r\nbe  able to find out the faults of his learner  during\r\n\r\nthe  test.  Then if the learner has to go back  for  a\r\n\r\nsecond test, the instructor can coach his pupil on the\r\n\r\nfaults made during the first one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I may suggest, Sir, that when a learner goes for\r\n\r\na  second test, he should only be tested on the faults\r\n\r\nhe  made during the previous or first test; he  should\r\n\r\nnot be tested all over again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these good reasons, I say that instructors\r\n\r\nshould be allowed to follow their pupils on test. I do\r\n\r\nhope that the Minister will take all these points into\r\n\r\nconsideration, stick to his letter to the President of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Driving  Schools  Association  on  7th\r\n\r\nDecember that he is sympathetic to its demands and\r\n\r\nconsider the request made by me in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Could I just clarify one or two\r\n\r\npoints of information before I speak, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am afraid the Hon. the Minister\r\n\r\nshould make his speech now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, I had intended to ask the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown how long he had  been  a  City\r\n\r\nCouncillor. My recollection is, since 1952, but I  may\r\n\r\nbe  mistaken - I am not quite certain about the date.  I\r\n\r\nwas  then  going to ask him what he himself did  as  a\r\n\r\nCity  Councillor in this matter of the restriction  of\r\n\r\nhours  and the fee for instructional cars and  so  on.\r\n\r\nAnd  finally, I wanted to ask him whether he was aware\r\n\r\nof  S29,  1957,  and SL33 of 1955. Because  these  are\r\n\r\nessentially  City  Council matters which  come  to  me\r\n\r\nunder  a  very complicated Ordinance - the Road  Traffic\r\n\r\nOrdinance - on  which I constantly have  to  refresh  my\r\n\r\nmemory  because  it  is complicated.  I  have  certain\r\n\r\nduties, responsibilities and powers but,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nby  and  large, these are matters dealt  by  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  which  come up to me and  I  have  either  to\r\n\r\napprove  its proposals, or I may disapprove  of  them.\r\n\r\nWhenever I can, of course, I approve because certainly\r\n\r\nI   have  no  wish  to  come  into  conflict  with   a\r\n\r\ndemocratically elected body. And the hon. Member, as a\r\n\r\nCity  Councillor, has had the fullest access to  these\r\n\r\nmatters no doubt, and I am sure or I should wish to be\r\n\r\nsure that he has taken advantage of his position as  a\r\n\r\nCity  Councillor  either in the long  past  before  he\r\n\r\nadded  the  duties of the Assembly as  well,  or  even\r\n\r\ntoday when he still retains his position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Second thoughts are always good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> But apparently he has not in fact done\r\n\r\nso.  He  was under the impression that a worker cannot\r\n\r\nget  tuition except after the hours of dark,  that  is\r\n\r\npresuming that he is working in his office or  factory\r\n\r\nduring  the  hours of daylight. Well, I  am  presuming\r\n\r\nthat  the  worker  is not working over-time  over  the\r\n\r\nweekend,  and  if the Member had studied  this  matter\r\n\r\nwith  the  care which I am sure all Members  ought  to\r\n\r\nbefore  raising a matter on the adjournment, he  would\r\n\r\nbe  aware  that one of the things that I, on  becoming\r\n\r\nMinister,  did in connection with this matter  was  to\r\n\r\nfree the weekends so that in fact tuition can be given\r\n\r\non  Saturday afternoons and the whole of Sundays,  and\r\n\r\nof course also on gazetted holidays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Not enough tuition time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> It may well be that he feels that that\r\n\r\nis not enough time but nevertheless there is time, and\r\n\r\nit  is  not true that you have to manage it all  after\r\n\r\ndusk. You have half Saturdays and the whole of Sundays\r\n\r\navailable if you want to take your private tuition  in\r\n\r\ndriving.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have lost my notes and I cannot remember\r\n\r\nwhat  the  hon. Member said - a tragic loss to posterity\r\n\r\nif I do not answer his remarks. However,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  will do my best according to my recollection - ah,  I\r\n\r\nhave  found them. Now here is one thing I must  resist\r\n\r\nvery   strongly, a  perfectly  wrong  statement - is\r\n\r\n\"disgraceful\"   an  unparliamentary  expression,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker? - a  disgraceful expression  that  testers  who\r\n\r\ntest  people fail them because they do not like  their\r\n\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think \"disgraceful\" is an\r\n\r\nunparliamentary expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Well, Mr Speaker, I will say that it is\r\n\r\na  suggestion which should not be made, and  certainly\r\n\r\nnot made by a responsible person who is concerned with\r\n\r\nthe  proper  conduct  of public  business,  because  a\r\n\r\nsuggestion  of that sort can only do harm  and  cannot\r\n\r\npossibly  do  good.  There is no  ground  at  all  for\r\n\r\nsupposing that in any case a person has been failed on\r\n\r\nthe ground of personal dislike, If the hon. Member has\r\n\r\nany evidence of that, he should have brought it to  me\r\n\r\nlong  ago;  if he has no evidence, then he should  not\r\n\r\nmake that sort of suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> No appeal allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown feels he has been misunderstood  or  wishes\r\n\r\nfor  elucidation, he can always stand up and I am sure\r\n\r\nthe Minister will sit down and hear him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Thank you, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Now he was using an entirely wrong\r\n\r\nargument  to support the suggestion that the tutor  or\r\n\r\ninstructor should accompany his pupil on test, and  he\r\n\r\nwent  on to speak about examinations and that kind  of\r\n\r\nthing.  The  simple  fact is that  when  you  have  an\r\n\r\nexamination  you  do  not have  your  teacher  sitting\r\n\r\nbeside   your  desk  helping  you  pass  your   school\r\n\r\ncertificate;  if the Member suggests  that  a  driving\r\n\r\ntutor who sits in the back of the car will not in  one\r\n\r\nway  or another attempt to assist his pupil during the\r\n\r\ntest - and  is certain to distract the pupil's attention\r\n\r\nfrom  his job of being tested - I cannot agree with him.\r\n\r\nTo  suggest that it is undemocratic to insist  that  a\r\n\r\nman is tested under test\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconditions,  and  not with an instructor  on  hand  to\r\n\r\nencourage  and guide him, seems to me a most fantastic\r\n\r\nmisuse  of words. There is nothing undemocratic  about\r\n\r\nit  at all. A man has been taught and he then goes  to\r\n\r\nthe  test;  if he cannot pass it, he can have  another\r\n\r\ntry - at  quite  short notice if he has  any  reason  in\r\n\r\nsupport of it. So much for what is the weakest part of\r\n\r\nthe  hon. Member's argument, and one in which I cannot\r\n\r\nsee any validity.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the same tuition rate, whether you\r\n\r\nown  the  car  in  which you are being  instructed  or\r\n\r\nwhether  you use the instructor's car - it is  purely  a\r\n\r\nmatter  for  the instructor to decide  what  rates  he\r\n\r\nwishes to charge. If he wishes to charge more, it  has\r\n\r\nnothing to do with the Government. The point is simply\r\n\r\nthis, that if a man proposes to use his car for reward\r\n\r\nfor instruction, if he is making his living out of the\r\n\r\nuse  of the roads, then it is very reasonable that  he\r\n\r\nshould pay rather more highly than he would pay if  he\r\n\r\nwas  merely driving around in the ordinary  course  of\r\n\r\nhis social life.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the road is turned into a place of profit and\r\n\r\nbusiness,  then it is very proper that the  person  so\r\n\r\nusing it should pay a sort of rent for it because what\r\n\r\nis  meant for everybody to use for normal movement  is\r\n\r\nbeing  turned by him into a place of business.  It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  reasonable that he should pay  rather  more\r\n\r\nthan  the  ordinary person does, just as a  hawker  or\r\n\r\nanybody  else  who  tries to  trade  on  the  road  is\r\n\r\nexpected to contribute.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. Member had studied the matter with the\r\n\r\ncare  with which it ought to be studied, he would have\r\n\r\nnoticed of course that the tax is not levied on  those\r\n\r\nwho  use their motorcars for instruction, it is levied\r\n\r\non  those who use their motor-cars for instruction for\r\n\r\nreward,  and that the tax is levied only on those  who\r\n\r\nare  professional instructors. Well, so much for  that\r\n\r\npoint.   If   the  Member  had  studied  things   more\r\n\r\ncarefully,  he  would have taken less time  and  there\r\n\r\nwould have been less need to answer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the central point that the Member wants to make\r\n\r\nis simply this, that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere are some streets or roads within city limits  on\r\n\r\nwhich it would be possible for instruction to be given\r\n\r\nwithout  adding  to congestion, because  there  is  no\r\n\r\ncongestion. Well, that is a matter of opinion. I  have\r\n\r\nalready  written  to  the  President  of  the  Driving\r\n\r\nSchools  Association and I have had meetings with  and\r\n\r\nletters  from  him. Then I had meetings  with  Chinese\r\n\r\ndriving instructors, with Mr Lambert, and with  other\r\n\r\npeople  concerned with giving driving  tuition.  I  am\r\n\r\nvery willing to have meetings with these bodies and it\r\n\r\nis  quite  unnecessary for an hon. Member  to  get  up\r\n\r\nwithout  instructing himself about the  matter  he  is\r\n\r\nraising  and  to  waste the time  of  this  House.  If\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public have these points to  raise.  I\r\n\r\nhave  never denied them access to myself.  I  am  most\r\n\r\nwilling  to  consider any points they  raise,  and  if\r\n\r\nanybody can show me, indicate to me, streets and roads\r\n\r\nwhich are free from heavy traffic and can be used  for\r\n\r\ninstruction during the hours at present forbidden, and\r\n\r\nif  they  can suggest how the pupil and the instructor\r\n\r\nare   going  to  get  themselves  there  without   the\r\n\r\ntemptation of the pupil taking the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwheel  on  the way there through the heavy traffic,  I\r\n\r\nwill  be willing to look into the matter to see if  we\r\n\r\ncannot come to a reasonable agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is of course why I said in my letter that I\r\n\r\ncould   not   envisage  wholesale   lifting   of   the\r\n\r\nrestrictions. But I am perfectly willing  to  consider\r\n\r\nreasonable  suggestions put to me, provided  that  the\r\n\r\nperson knows what he is talking about, has studied the\r\n\r\nmatter  and is prepared to support his arguments  with\r\n\r\nsome reasonable facts and figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately in my Ministry I have no transport\r\n\r\nexpert,  and  all transport work has  to  be  done  in\r\n\r\naddition to the normal work of the Ministry. In  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, I cannot call for advice on matters  of\r\n\r\nthis sort. I must necessarily depend on those who wish\r\n\r\nfor  special  consideration putting  up  a  reasonable\r\n\r\ncase;  then  we  will give it reasonable consideration\r\n\r\nand no difficulty will arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">fifty-one minutes past Five o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
