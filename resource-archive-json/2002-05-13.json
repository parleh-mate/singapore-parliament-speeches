Sir,  PUB  has\r\n\r\ntidal  gates  at  four  other locations.   These  are:  Lower\r\n\r\nSeletar  Reservoir, Poyan Reservoir, Pandan Canal and  Jurong\r\n\r\nLake.  Safety operating procedures similar to those in Kranji\r\n\r\nare also observed in these four locations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members may wonder how effective these safety\r\n\r\nmeasures have been.  These procedures have been in place  for\r\n\r\n27  years.   There has not been any accident or mishap  being\r\n\r\nlinked to the operations of the tidal gates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the recent incident on 14th April 2002, I am\r\n\r\naware  that  there has been some speculation, as reported  in\r\n\r\nour local media, that the incident might have been caused  by\r\n\r\nthe  operations of the tidal gates. So far, PUB has not found\r\n\r\nany technical evidence suggesting that this may be the case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the incident is now under police investigation.\r\n\r\nWhile  awaiting  for the outcome of the police investigation,\r\n\r\nthe  PUB  has introduced two extra safety measures to address\r\n\r\npublic concern.  These are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Converting the signboards in the park area into\r\n\r\nfour languages, and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) PUB staff using a loud-hailer to warn the public to\r\n\r\nstay  clear  of  the water channel before opening  the  tidal\r\n\r\ngates.  This is a temporary measure.  We will review the need\r\n\r\nto  continue  with  this  measure as  well  as  the  need  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  further  measures pending the  outcome  of  police\r\n\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister whether the need for all these safety  measures\r\n\r\ndoes  suggest that there are certain dangers involved in  the\r\n\r\nopening  of  these  tidal gates?  Could he perhaps  elaborate\r\n\r\nwhat  these  dangers are likely to be and whether there  will\r\n\r\nindeed be a proper\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninquiry  into  the extra measures, if possible,  rather  than\r\n\r\nwaiting  for the police investigation because I am  not  sure\r\n\r\nwhat  the  police  will come up with?   But  surely,  he  has\r\n\r\nexperts  in  the  Ministry who can perhaps  do  the  function\r\n\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, Prof. Chin asked two questions:\r\n\r\nfirstly,  what  are  the  likely dangers  involved  with  the\r\n\r\nopening of the tidal gates?  Sir, to be more specific, I will\r\n\r\nexplain  using the Kranji tidal gates.  For the Kranji  tidal\r\n\r\ngates, there are two types of operations.  The first type  is\r\n\r\nwhen  the  water  level in the reservoir  reaches  a  certain\r\n\r\nlevel.   To prevent any upstream flooding or overflow of  the\r\n\r\nreservoir,  the floodgate will be lowered from the  top,  ie,\r\n\r\nthe  flag  gates  are  declined, so that  the  water  in  the\r\n\r\nreservoir  can overflow into the channel.  For this  kind  of\r\n\r\noperation, the lowering of the flag gates, the danger area is\r\n\r\nactually  very small.  It covers only the first 40 metres  of\r\n\r\nthe  channel.  In fact, this is the reason why the  first  80\r\n\r\nmetres of the channel is guarded by this high fencing so that\r\n\r\nnobody  could  get  access to the  first  80  metres  of  the\r\n\r\nchannel.  In other words, the lowering of the flag gates is a\r\n\r\nfairly  safe operation and the danger area involves only  the\r\n\r\nfirst 40 metres in the channel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin and the other Members may wonder: if that is\r\n\r\nthe case, why have these signboards to warn the public of the\r\n\r\ndanger  of  rapid  flow?   Sir,  there  is  another  type  of\r\n\r\nfloodgate  operation, which is, if the lowering of  the  flag\r\n\r\ngate  is not enough to contain the rising water level in  the\r\n\r\nreservoir, then in extreme situations, we may have no  choice\r\n\r\nbut to lift the floodgate entirely.  This vertical lifting of\r\n\r\nthe  floodgate will cause the water in the reservoir to  rush\r\n\r\nthrough the floodgate from the bottom.  Obviously, the  speed\r\n\r\nof  the  flow in the channel will be much higher.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  in  operating a floodgate, PUB does look at  the  two\r\n\r\ndifferent  types of operations.  In the case of lowering  the\r\n\r\nflag  gate,  PUB  staff will ensure that the  immediate  area\r\n\r\noutside of the floodgate is cleared of human activities.   On\r\n\r\nthe  day of the incident, that was indeed the case where  the\r\n\r\nflag  gate was lowered but there was no requirement  on  that\r\n\r\nday to lift the floodgate.  In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother words, the danger posed by the lifting of the floodgate\r\n\r\ndid not happen on that day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Prof. Chin asked whether there would be a\r\n\r\nproper inquiry conducted to look into the incident.  Sir, the\r\n\r\nmain  responsibility of PUB is to make a technical assessment\r\n\r\non  the  potential impact of the tidal gate operation on  the\r\n\r\nwater  surrounding  the area.  As regards  investigating  the\r\n\r\ncause of the incident, this comes under the police under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Home Affairs.  We will leave MHA to complete  its\r\n\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, why is the PUB\r\n\r\ndumping  water  into the sea?  Is there not a  way  where  we\r\n\r\ncould  channel  this excess water into some other  reservoirs\r\n\r\ndirectly to save the water?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Tan raised a very\r\n\r\ninteresting  point.   Today, in Singapore,  our  daily  water\r\n\r\nconsumption is about 300 million gallons.  To make sure  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  enough water stored in the reservoirs in  case  of\r\n\r\ndrought and so on, we have created as much reservoir capacity\r\n\r\nas we can.  At this moment, the water storage capacity in our\r\n\r\nreservoirs  is  about 100 times our daily consumption  -  300\r\n\r\nmillion  gallons  multiply by 100 times will  give  us  about\r\n\r\nthree thousand million gallons of reservoir capacity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB's strategy is to manage our water supply and\r\n\r\nconsumption in such a way that, as far as possible, we  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  keep the water level in the reservoirs as  high  as\r\n\r\npossible.   In  case we run into a situation of  shortage  in\r\n\r\nwater supply due to drought season, these reservoirs will  be\r\n\r\nable to serve as a buffer.  The water level in the reservoirs\r\n\r\nnow  is about 90%.  During a heavy downpour, we will have  to\r\n\r\nlet go some of this water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Mr Tan and Members here that we\r\n\r\nare certainly not wasting all our rain water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of the incident, from 5 pm to 5.30 pm, the\r\n\r\nopening of the floodgate released about 17 million gallons of\r\n\r\nexcess rainwater.  But during the same half\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  hour  period,  we  managed to capture  about  51  million\r\n\r\ngallons.  In other words, three-quarters of the downpour were\r\n\r\ncaptured  and  retained  in the reservoir.   The  other  one-quarter,  unfortunately, has to flow away because  the  water\r\n\r\nlevel  in the reservoir has already reached 90% which is  the\r\n\r\nsafety limit.  However, Mr Tan may be happy to learn that  we\r\n\r\nare  now  embarking  on  a  programme  to  link  up  all  the\r\n\r\nreservoirs.   This  is to ensure that in a situation  whereby\r\n\r\nsome  reservoirs may have reached 90% while  there  is  still\r\n\r\nspare  capacity  in the other reservoirs, we  will  be  able,\r\n\r\nthrough  this  reservoir integration scheme, to minimise  and\r\n\r\nreduce  the need to lower the floodgate at times of  a  heavy\r\n\r\ndownpour.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> The Minister just now\r\n\r\nmentioned that there are four other areas with similar gates.\r\n\r\nIs  his  Ministry likely to conduct a survey  as  to  whether\r\n\r\nthese  areas will also pose likely dangers to members of  the\r\n\r\npublic?   Would it be better to make sure that no members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public use the areas near the floodgate at all to  avoid\r\n\r\nsuch incidents?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier, the same safety operating procedures do apply at all\r\n\r\nthe  four locations.  Further to that, the PUB has looked  at\r\n\r\nthe other four areas and concluded that the only area at this\r\n\r\nmoment  where there is mud flat and visitors is at the  Lower\r\n\r\nSeletar  Reservoir.  PUB is going ahead to change the warning\r\n\r\nsign there into four languages as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PSA CORPORATION LIMITED</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Competitiveness)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mdm Halimah Yacob</b> asked the Minister for Transport\r\n\r\nwhat  measures  are  being taken to  ensure  PSA  Corporation\r\n\r\nLimited's  competitiveness in view of the  intense  challenge\r\n\r\nposed by other ports to PSA's premier position.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, first, let me assure the House  that  PSA  has\r\n\r\nbeen a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompetitive  port  operator, and  that  it  is  committed  to\r\n\r\nremaining  so for the long term.  Despite the decision  of  a\r\n\r\nmajor  customer,  Maersk, to hub elsewhere,  PSA's  container\r\n\r\nthroughput  for the first four months of this  year  went  up\r\n\r\n8.6% compared with last year's figures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a reflection of its capabilities, PSA has been\r\n\r\nconsistently  voted the best container terminal  operator  in\r\n\r\nAsia for 13 years.  More than 250 shipping lines call at  the\r\n\r\nport, providing PSA with superb connectivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, shipping is a dynamic and increasingly\r\n\r\ncompetitive  business.  This  is  especially   so   for   the\r\n\r\ntranshipment  business, as shipping lines need  not  call  at\r\n\r\nSingapore to tranship their containers.  Given the  open  and\r\n\r\ncompetitive  nature  of  the shipping  industry,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nuncommon  for new ports to woo shipping lines,  and  for  the\r\n\r\nlatter to seek out ports which offer better commercial terms.\r\n\r\nPSA  expects that it will continue to grow its volumes in the\r\n\r\ncoming  years even as shipping lines readjust their ports  of\r\n\r\ncall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many positives in PSA's favour, including\r\n\r\nits  high  connectivity, high productivity, reliable services\r\n\r\nand  a large critical base of over 15 million TEUs per annum.\r\n\r\nIt  took PSA many years to achieve this, and it will not lose\r\n\r\nits big lead overnight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me add that PSA is acutely aware\r\n\r\nthat  the  competitive  environment is  constantly  changing.\r\n\r\nCompetition  for  the  regional  transhipment  business   has\r\n\r\nintensified, with countries in the region striving to develop\r\n\r\ntheir  own hub ports.  PSA is reviewing its strategy, and  is\r\n\r\ntaking steps to anchor its customers here for the long  term.\r\n\r\nIt  is  committed to remaining customer-oriented  and  price-competitive in order to maintain and grow its position as the\r\n\r\nworld's number one transhipment port.  PSA will also continue\r\n\r\nto  innovate  and  add  value to  its  services  through  the\r\n\r\nadoption of new technology and processes.  It will share  the\r\n\r\nsavings from productivity improvements with its clients. This\r\n\r\nwin-win approach will help\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentrench PSA's long term position as a hub port.\r\n\r\n.     The  Government,  through  agencies  such  as  MPA,  IE\r\n\r\nSingapore,  EDB  and  MAS, will also  continue  to  grow  the\r\n\r\nmaritime  services  sector.   These  activities,  like   ship\r\n\r\nmanagement,  ship financing, insurance and other  specialised\r\n\r\nservices,  provide high value-add to the  economy.   In  this\r\n\r\nregard, I am pleased to announce that MPA is setting up a $80\r\n\r\nmillion fund to help speed up the development of the maritime\r\n\r\nsector.  One key focus of the fund will be the development of\r\n\r\nthe  specialist knowledge and expertise needed by the sector.\r\n\r\nDetails  of  this  fund  and how the shipping  community  can\r\n\r\nbenefit  from it will be released by MPA shortly.   The  fund\r\n\r\nand  its programmes will complement PSA's efforts, and ensure\r\n\r\nthat Singapore continues to grow as a hub port, as well as an\r\n\r\nInternational Maritime Centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, the Minister has\r\n\r\nmentioned  that PSA is looking into ways on how  to  innovate\r\n\r\nits  operations, its business, as well as how  to  share  the\r\n\r\nproductivity   gains.   The  situation  is  now   much   more\r\n\r\ncompetitive.  Competitors are giving things like lower rates.\r\n\r\nThey  are also allowing a share in the port operations.  Does\r\n\r\nit  suggest that PSA has failed to look at all these areas of\r\n\r\ninnovation before?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to ask the Minister what useful lessons can\r\n\r\nother  Singapore  companies draw from PSA's  experience,  and\r\n\r\nwhat are the implications to workers and management in PSA as\r\n\r\na result of this development.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, PSA has had a very competitive\r\n\r\nregime  of  rates.  As you know, the marketplace  is  a  very\r\n\r\ndynamic   one.    Different  ports  offer  different   rates,\r\n\r\ndifferent benefits.  And PSA has always strived to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat it is able to keep ahead of the competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the two lines that are leaving to hub\r\n\r\nelsewhere - one of which has already left - they were offered\r\n\r\nterms which they found difficult to turn down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPSA  is reviewing its strategy now.  As I have mentioned just\r\n\r\nnow, primarily, it has to be price competitive.  But price is\r\n\r\nnot  the  end of the story, because what shipping lines  look\r\n\r\nfor are other services.  It is the range of services that can\r\n\r\nbe  provided because, at the end of the day, they are looking\r\n\r\nat  the total value chain that the port can give.  A port can\r\n\r\ngive very low rates.  In fact, there are many ports that give\r\n\r\nrates  that  are  far, far below what PSA is offering.   But,\r\n\r\nbecause of inefficiencies and other problems, the total  cost\r\n\r\nincurred  by  the  shipping line to call at  those  ports  is\r\n\r\nactually much higher than what it would cost to call at  PSA.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is  a  total  equation that  has  to  be  taken  into\r\n\r\nconsideration.   PSA is reviewing this total equation to make\r\n\r\nsure  that it is still the most cost effective port  to  call\r\n\r\nat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister has mentioned, we would definitely\r\n\r\nconsider   the  other  options  as  well,  such  as  offering\r\n\r\ndedicated terminals and offering shareholdings in PSA by  the\r\n\r\nshipping   lines.

In part, this  is\r\n\r\ndue to the rapid expansion of the air passenger and air cargo\r\n\r\nmarket  as Asian economies grow.  The Asian financial  crisis\r\n\r\nand  September 11 have temporarily disrupted the growth,  but\r\n\r\nthe   long-term  trend  is  positive.   As  a   result,   the\r\n\r\ncompetition amongst airports will continue to intensify.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To preserve our position as an air hub, we will continue\r\n\r\nto  focus  on  three  main areas.  First,  strengthening  our\r\n\r\nposition  as  a  regional business  and  tourism  hub.   This\r\n\r\nensures that there is high passenger traffic originating from\r\n\r\nand  coming into Singapore.  A strong economy also translates\r\n\r\ninto  large numbers of Singaporeans who can afford to  travel\r\n\r\nabroad for business or on holiday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, enhancing our connectivity. Fifty eight\r\n\r\nscheduled airlines now serve Singapore, connecting us with 50\r\n\r\ncountries  and 139 cities.

URA  chairs a regular Community  Facilities  Co-ordination  Committee  meeting  with  relevant  agencies  and\r\n\r\nparent  Ministries  of  the common  community  facilities  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate implementation of co-location.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo's suggestion for various community groups and\r\n\r\nvoluntary welfare organisations to share space or premises is\r\n\r\na  useful  one.  Such arrangements can be worked out,  taking\r\n\r\ninto   account  the  needs  of  the  clients  or  users   and\r\n\r\noperational requirements.  This is already taking place among\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development Councils (CDCs) and various grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations,   which  work  closely  together   and   share\r\n\r\nresources.  The five CDCs are using the CCs and RCs to  reach\r\n\r\nout to a larger number of residents.   For example, the South\r\n\r\nEast  CDC  is using Potong Pasir Community Centre  and  Bedok\r\n\r\nCommunity  Centre  as service points.

These  efforts\r\n\r\ninclude  job  referral  services  at  my  Ministry  and   our\r\n\r\npartners,  job  fairs  and  traineeship  programmes  for  the\r\n\r\nunemployed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On average, 1,200 unemployed Singaporeans, including 600\r\n\r\naged 40 and above are successfully placed each month.  At  my\r\n\r\nMinistry's career centre, for example, about 60%  to  70%  of\r\n\r\nthe  job  seekers would receive referrals for job  interviews\r\n\r\nwith  prospective employers.  Close to 15% would successfully\r\n\r\nfind  jobs through our referral services.  However,  for  job\r\n\r\nseekers aged 40 years and above, the placement rate (that is,\r\n\r\nthe  rate at which they obtain their jobs through our  direct\r\n\r\nassistance)  is  significantly lower; it is  only  8%.   This\r\n\r\nshows  that  older unemployed workers face greater challenges\r\n\r\nin their job search.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also encourage unemployed workers to explore other\r\n\r\navenues in their job search and not just wait for us to  find\r\n\r\nthem a job.  Hence, some job seekers who come to us initially\r\n\r\nwould  subsequently  find  jobs through  their  own  efforts.\r\n\r\nOverall, 59% of Singaporeans aged 40 and above retrenched  in\r\n\r\nthe  first  9 months of 2001 were re-employed by the  end  of\r\n\r\n2001.  This is lower than the national average of 65% and the\r\n\r\naverage of 70% for Singaporeans aged below 40.

We have made it very clear, first\r\n\r\nof  all,  that  there are certain criteria that  need  to  be\r\n\r\nfulfilled.   In  the case of the Estate Upgrading  Programme,\r\n\r\nyou  have  got  criteria like age, condition,  etc.   And  of\r\n\r\ncourse, there is also the condition that the Government  must\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  afford to do upgrading.  In other  words,  that\r\n\r\nthere are budget surpluses available.  First of all, we  must\r\n\r\nget  the  budget for it and then, secondly, we  have  got  to\r\n\r\ninvite nominations and all the estates which are eligible for\r\n\r\nupgrading will then be considered together and the ones  that\r\n\r\nare   most  deserving  will  be  selected.   There  are  many\r\n\r\ncriteria, as I have listed earlier.  Age is one, but not  the\r\n\r\nmost important one.  Similarly, the scope of works.  And  the\r\n\r\nsupport  for  the  programme is also one, but  not  the  only\r\n\r\ncondition.   So eligibility of Sennett Estate for the  Estate\r\n\r\nUpgrading Programme is certainly there.  But whether it  will\r\n\r\nbe  selected  or  not depends on whether other  precincts  or\r\n\r\nestates are more deserving.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> If I get the Minister right, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  National  Development does  not  take  note  of\r\n\r\nanything\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstated  by  the Ministers during the elections, ie,  whatever\r\n\r\npromises  they have made mean nothing to his Ministry.

In the case of Sennett Estate, it fulfills some of\r\n\r\nthe  criteria and certainly when it comes up, if and when  it\r\n\r\nis  nominated  for upgrading, we will certainly consider  it.\r\n\r\nBut it must be done together with all other deserving estates\r\n\r\nand  I am sure all the other Members of this House here would\r\n\r\nappreciate that we would have to be fair in our selection.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  National Development  seems  to  be  giving  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  criterion  now.

There are a whole series of  criteria.\r\n\r\nIn  this  particular case, the age is very important  because\r\n\r\nobviously  the older the estate, the more need there  is  for\r\n\r\nupgrading.  But then, this is not the only criterion  because\r\n\r\nif  you go by age alone, then obviously you are only going to\r\n\r\nconcentrate on one area of Singapore.  Besides that, it  does\r\n\r\nnot  mean  that,  if the estate is old, it is  in  very  poor\r\n\r\ncondition.  Sometimes, the estates which are older are not in\r\n\r\nsuch  poor  condition.  So again, we  have  to  take  a  very\r\n\r\nconsidered view of the age criterion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then of course, we have things like scope of works.\r\n\r\nWhat  do you mean by \"scope of works\"?  It simply means  that\r\n\r\nin  certain estates, certain things need to be done which  in\r\n\r\nother  estates  do not need to be done, for example,  drains.\r\n\r\nThere  are some estates where the condition of the drains  is\r\n\r\nvery  poor.  So we have to look at that specifically  because\r\n\r\nthe Drainage Department of the Ministry of the Environment is\r\n\r\nalso  spending  money on drains.  So we have to  dovetail  it\r\n\r\nwith  the drainage programme.  Last but not least, of course,\r\n\r\nthere  is the question whether the residents actually support\r\n\r\nsuch  programmes,  whether they have  a  sense  of  community\r\n\r\nbonding, a sense of community spirit.  How do we gather that?\r\n\r\nWe  gather  that  by seeing whether there is a  neighbourhood\r\n\r\ncommittee.  If there is a neighbourhood committee, it is much\r\n\r\neasier   to  get  the  residents  together  to  support   the\r\n\r\nprogramme,  to  tell us what is it that  they  need,  to  get\r\n\r\ntogether  to work the programme through and to implement  it.\r\n\r\nSo all these things need to be done and to be considered.  It\r\n\r\nis  not a paper exercise, as Mr Low seems to suggest, that we\r\n\r\njust  go  through and tote up the points and, after that,  we\r\n\r\nmake a selection.  A lot of investigations need to be done, a\r\n\r\nlot of ground work needs to be done, a lot of discussions and\r\n\r\ninteractions with other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistries  need to be done also.  So this is  not  a  simple\r\n\r\nexercise, as Mr Low seems to think.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having gone through that exercise, we have to make\r\n\r\nvery  sure that the budget that we have for this is  properly\r\n\r\nspent.   There is a limited budget.  The Ministry of  Finance\r\n\r\ngives  us  a specific budget, say, $40 million for  the  next\r\n\r\nfive years.  We have found that the amount may not be enough.\r\n\r\nSo  we  have got to go and ask for more money.  Before we  go\r\n\r\nand  ask for more money from the Ministry of Finance, we have\r\n\r\nto  be  very sure about what the money is to be for, how  the\r\n\r\nmoney  is  to be spent and to assure them that the  money  is\r\n\r\nwell spent.  So there is a lot of work that needs to be done.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  would like to assure the House that when the advisors\r\n\r\nput  in their applications, we will assess those applications\r\n\r\ncarefully  and  we  will make a decision  which  will  be  of\r\n\r\noptimal benefit, not just to the residents, but also to  make\r\n\r\nsure the money is well spent.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, may I clarify with the\r\n\r\nMinister?

The  Resource\r\n\r\nPanel  Members  comprise professionals,  top  executives  and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs who come from varied industry background,  such\r\n\r\nas   banks,  insurance  companies,  manufacturing  companies,\r\n\r\nhotels, retail and others.

It is a forward-looking and  progressive\r\n\r\nBudget in the sense that the announced policies are meant  to\r\n\r\nprepare Singapore for the challenges of the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed tax and GST changes are bold and will\r\n\r\nhave  deep structural impact.  For this Budget, the corporate\r\n\r\ntax  and  personal income tax rates will be reduced  to  22%,\r\n\r\nwith the GST increased by 2% to 5%.  The basic objectives  of\r\n\r\nthese   fundamental  changes  are  to  make  Singapore   more\r\n\r\ncompetitive  and better able to attract foreign  investments,\r\n\r\nattract foreign talent, and hold on to the well-qualified and\r\n\r\nwealthy  residents and Singaporeans to remain  here,  arising\r\n\r\nfrom the lower tax incidence for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I cannot help but feel that if merely changing\r\n\r\nthe  tax  structure will attract foreign investments,  retain\r\n\r\ntalent  and  solve all our problems, then the solution  seems\r\n\r\nall  too  easy.   As DPM Lee has said, the Budget  is  not  a\r\n\r\nmagical  wand.   Merely by one wave of the  wand,  everything\r\n\r\nwill be solved magically.  I think that is too simplistic.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Budget is part of an unfinished jigsaw puzzle</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that this year's Budget policies\r\n\r\nand  changes  announced by DPM is but part of  an  unfinished\r\n\r\njigsaw  puzzle.  Annually, the Budget serves as the blueprint\r\n\r\nof  the  Government  for not only the  year's  financial  and\r\n\r\nfiscal policy, but a policy narration of the medium and  long\r\n\r\nterm economic plans of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this Budget, a major piece of the puzzle is in\r\n\r\nplace, which is with regard to tax policy.   However, certain\r\n\r\nmajor  Government  policies are not fully  described  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget.   The  overall economic plan normally includes  other\r\n\r\nkey elements.  They should encompass the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Major industrial policies, such as promotion of local\r\n\r\nindustries, technopreneurship, innovation, target  industrial\r\n\r\nsectors for promotion such as biotech, IT, education services\r\n\r\nand tourism;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Manpower planning and labour policies, which impinge on\r\n\r\nCPF rates, retirement age, foreign labour, foreign talent and\r\n\r\ntraining; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Trade and international competition, such as economic\r\n\r\nrelations  with  our neighbouring countries, and  threat  and\r\n\r\nopportunity of China and India.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason for this sense of incompleteness of the\r\n\r\nBudget  is primarily because the Government has launched  two\r\n\r\ninitiatives where the final reports are not out yet.  One  is\r\n\r\nthe  Economic  Review  Committee (ERC)  chaired  by  DPM  Lee\r\n\r\nhimself and the other is the Remaking of Singapore called the\r\n\r\nROS.   These two major long-term review studies have  various\r\n\r\nsub-committees looking into several areas.  As  DPM  Lee  has\r\n\r\nsaid,  these groups will review all matters, including sacred\r\n\r\ncows and leave no stone unturned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these two committees, the people are adopting\r\n\r\na  bit of a wait and see attitude.  I believe that once these\r\n\r\nreviews  are  completed, the entire  jigsaw  puzzle  will  be\r\n\r\ncomplete  and the total picture will emerge.  DPM  Lee  could\r\n\r\nperhaps  enlighten  this  House  on  the  progress  of  these\r\n\r\ncommittees,  and when do we expect to see the whole  picture.\r\n\r\nWhat  are  the  final grand plans?  What  directions  are  we\r\n\r\ntaking?  Where are the threats and opportunities?  Where  are\r\n\r\nthe  further pains to be borne by the people?  Will there  be\r\n\r\nfinal light at the end of the tunnel?\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Specific comments on the Budget announcement</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we wait for the big picture to emerge, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, allow me to make some specific remarks on the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Financial Year 2001 and Financial Year 2002 Budgets</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to note that for the FY 2001 Budget,\r\n\r\nthe Government has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nachieved  a  surplus  of S$3.84 billion  versus  an  original\r\n\r\nestimate of S$6.22 billion.  Although lower than expected, we\r\n\r\nare pleased that a surplus is nevertheless achieved, in spite\r\n\r\nof  the  year  2001  being a very bad recession  year.   This\r\n\r\nenabled   the  Government  to  introduce  the  new   Economic\r\n\r\nRestructuring  Shares  (ERS).   We  are  very  thankful   and\r\n\r\nappreciative  of the very generous gesture of the  Government\r\n\r\nto introduce this ERS soon after giving out the New Singapore\r\n\r\nShares (NSS) last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly for FY 2002, the Government is projecting a\r\n\r\nsmall surplus of S$0.89 billion.  Again, we are very thankful\r\n\r\nthat  due  to  prudent and careful financial management,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  operating budget for FY 2002 remains  in  surplus\r\n\r\nand not a deficit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Impact of tax changes</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general concern of the people is that the tax and\r\n\r\nGST  changes  are  shifting  the tax  burden  from  the  rich\r\n\r\nindividuals and successful companies to the lower and  middle\r\n\r\nincome  people.   About 70% of the people, essentially  those\r\n\r\nfrom  the lower and middle income bracket, do not pay  income\r\n\r\ntax,  so they will not enjoy the income tax reduction but  at\r\n\r\nthe   same   time   will   pay  more  on   consumption   tax.\r\n\r\nFundamentally the tax changes are regressive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to note that the Government has\r\n\r\nintroduced offset measures to lighten the higher GST load  on\r\n\r\nthe  low  income group.  But the definition of this group  is\r\n\r\nderived  from  the  use of 1-5 room HDB  flats  as  the  base\r\n\r\ncriterion.  However, two groups of Singaporeans will have  to\r\n\r\nbear  the brunt of the GST increase without much relief  from\r\n\r\nthe offset package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One group is the lower to middle income employees and\r\n\r\nexecutives who do not live in HDB 1-5 room flats.  They enjoy\r\n\r\nvery little of the income tax reduction, but at the same time\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay  more  GST.  Another group is  the  pensioners,\r\n\r\nespecially  a certain pocket of retired junior and  mid-level\r\n\r\nformer civil servants, who live\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin old condominiums, old private apartments and small terrace\r\n\r\nunits.   They  also  do  not  enjoy  the  personal  tax  cut.\r\n\r\nHowever, they will pay fully on the higher GST rates  without\r\n\r\nenjoying  any of the offset package being offered since  they\r\n\r\ndo  not live in HDB flats.  Therefore, inherently there is  a\r\n\r\nflaw  in this method of offering offset reliefs via HDB  flat\r\n\r\ndwellers as the definition.  On the other hand, these  groups\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans  are too proud to seek redress  through  the\r\n\r\nrelief  scheme  administered by the constituency's  Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the Government comb through\r\n\r\nits  pensioners' list and offer on an automatic basis,  those\r\n\r\nlower  income  pensioners who do not live  in  HDB  flats,  a\r\n\r\npackage  similar  to those given to the HDB  dwellers.   This\r\n\r\nwould be a very nice gesture on the part of the Government if\r\n\r\ndone.   It will demonstrate the Government's appreciation  of\r\n\r\nthis  bunch of old civil servants who have laboured  hard  to\r\n\r\nhelp Singapore in the progress we have made today.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Group offsetting of corporate tax</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased that the Government has finally agreed\r\n\r\nto this long-standing call by MPs, including myself, to allow\r\n\r\ngroup offset of corporate tax.  The first step agreed upon is\r\n\r\nto  allow  subsidiaries of 75% owned Singapore companies  for\r\n\r\ncorporate tax group offset.  I have some suggestions.  One is\r\n\r\nto  include all Singapore companies above 51% because 51%  is\r\n\r\nthe  standard definition of a subsidiary to enjoy  group  tax\r\n\r\noffset; and the second is to consider extending group  offset\r\n\r\nto foreign subsidiaries of Singapore-based companies.  Sir, I\r\n\r\nshall elaborate on these suggestions during the debate in the\r\n\r\nCommittee of Supply under the Ministry of Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>One tier tax system on dividends</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the proposed one-tier system, there is no\r\n\r\nallowance of a tax credit to the individual, who will then be\r\n\r\ntaxed  at  full rate for the dividends earned on shares  they\r\n\r\nown.   This  one  tier tax system is unfair to  lower  income\r\n\r\nearners and also to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npensioners  who depend on their share dividends  as  part  of\r\n\r\ntheir  income.   These groups of people pay no  tax  or  much\r\n\r\nlower  than the full rate of income tax.  Again, I intend  to\r\n\r\nelaborate on this detail on my proposal during the COS stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Educating the public on the purpose and impact of GST</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the GST is a hot topic, I thought it is imperative\r\n\r\nof the Government to continue to educate the public about the\r\n\r\nconcept of GST.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, the Government has to continuously explain\r\n\r\nto  the  people via public education programmes on why  lower\r\n\r\ndirect tax can help to attract foreign investors, and in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  create jobs.  Many people are enquiring:   Will  the\r\n\r\nshift of direct corporate tax burden from lower direct tax to\r\n\r\nhigher GST truly bring in new investments and therefore bring\r\n\r\nin  employment?   What  if we cannot  achieve  these  desired\r\n\r\nresults?  Will there then be deeper direct corporate tax cuts\r\n\r\nand  personal income tax cuts leading to the need to increase\r\n\r\non  GST?  I believe it is useful for this matter to be  fully\r\n\r\nexplained to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>GST as a tax-on-tax</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another common misunderstanding of the GST is that the\r\n\r\n5%  rate is a tax-on-tax.  The confusion is that some  people\r\n\r\nthink  that the GST is computed at the full 5% at each  stage\r\n\r\nof  a  transaction.   So for a product that  requires  a  few\r\n\r\ntransactions  before reaching the final consumer,  the  total\r\n\r\nGST charged could end up being 15% to 20% because of the tax-on-tax  effect.   Of  course, this is  the  wrong  perception\r\n\r\nbecause GST is computed on a value-added basis.  However  the\r\n\r\npublic  is  not clear.  To make matters worse,  I  understand\r\n\r\nthat    certain   opposition   MPs   are   propagating   this\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  and  instilling  unnecessary  fear  on  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Small firms bear the GST</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other common misunderstanding is that the small\r\n\r\nfirms, since they are not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGST-registered, therefore cannot claim for GST paid from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   For  small firms and retailers,  they  have  to\r\n\r\nabsorb  the  GST which is charged on them by the larger  GST-registered  suppliers.  In turn, they cannot claim  from  the\r\n\r\nIRAS.   In  the  process they are disadvantaged.   Obviously,\r\n\r\nthis is another false understanding.  Sir, I believe there is\r\n\r\na  need  for more public education to clarify the  matter  on\r\n\r\nGST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Combat Profiteering</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be unscrupulous retailers, shops, hawkers and\r\n\r\ncompanies  which want to take advantage of the added  2%  GST\r\n\r\nincrease  to charge unfair higher prices.  I am pleased  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government has formed a Committee to Combat Profiteering\r\n\r\nunder the Minister of State, Mr Chan Soo Sen.  To improve the\r\n\r\neffectiveness  of  this committee, I wish to  urge  the  mass\r\n\r\nmedia  to  come  in to take part and help to publicise  those\r\n\r\nculprits,  retailers, shopkeepers, group  companies  who  are\r\n\r\nproven to be profiteering from this GST increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Assistance to local companies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the tax reduction is to attract foreign\r\n\r\nMNCs   to   invest  in  Singapore.   By  the  same  line   of\r\n\r\njustification, it can be construed that the corporate tax cut\r\n\r\nis  therefore beneficial primarily to MNCs, and not to  local\r\n\r\ncompanies, especially for the SMEs.  The reason is that  SMEs\r\n\r\ngenerally  pay low or no corporate tax as they  do  not  make\r\n\r\nsubstantial profits.  Hence, the corporate tax cut  does  not\r\n\r\nbenefit them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, SMEs continue to face pressure on the\r\n\r\nhigh  cost  of  doing business in Singapore.   Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthis year's Budget did not address in much detail on how SMEs\r\n\r\ncan  be  helped to lower business costs.  In previous  years,\r\n\r\nthe  Government has helped the SMEs by lowering property  tax\r\n\r\nrate,  lower  rental charges by HDB and JTC  and  other  such\r\n\r\nmeasures.   This  year, there is scarce mention  of  how  the\r\n\r\nGovernment intends to promote local companies and how to help\r\n\r\nthem to combat rising business\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncosts.   A  good  example is the recent  increase  in  petrol\r\n\r\nprices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a call on the Government to address these\r\n\r\nissues,  perhaps under the Economic Review Committee.   There\r\n\r\nis  also  a call on the Government to continue to extend  the\r\n\r\nprevious rebates and rental reductions, such as property  tax\r\n\r\nrebates  and  other fee reductions for local companies.   The\r\n\r\nreason  is that many of them are still facing severe business\r\n\r\ndownturn, with no signs of recovery yet in sight for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>We need to lift the doom and gloom mood</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to report that there is\r\n\r\na  prevailing  mood  of gloom and doom amongst  some  people,\r\n\r\nespecially   amongst  the  older  segment  of   the   working\r\n\r\npopulation.  Maybe I could cite this example to illustrate my\r\n\r\npoint.   Recently, I was informed by a colleague of mine  who\r\n\r\nsaid  that he was very struck by the very low spirits of  his\r\n\r\nelder brother and his group of friends.  In the past, he  and\r\n\r\nhis  friends were a cheerful and spirited lot.  They  are  in\r\n\r\ntheir  late 40s and early 50s.  They have enjoyed the heydays\r\n\r\nof  Singapore's boom in the 80s and 90s.  They bought  houses\r\n\r\nand cars, went on family holidays overseas, and generally had\r\n\r\na  good  run.  But in recent years, since the Asian financial\r\n\r\ncrisis  in 1997, and the recession last year, many saw  their\r\n\r\nfortunes turned for the worse.  They saw their friends losing\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs  and encountering great difficulties  to  be  re-employed.   Prospective employers thought they were  too  old\r\n\r\nand  outdated  to  employ them.  Those  with  jobs  clung  on\r\n\r\nprecariously,  toiling long hours just to  keep  their  jobs.\r\n\r\nThose in business saw business failures, or severe cutback in\r\n\r\ntheir business volume.  Many are just hanging on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two years, we saw the September 11 incident,\r\n\r\nread  about the terrorist threat in Singapore and around  the\r\n\r\nworld;  watched  with  concern the  political  and  religious\r\n\r\nturmoils   yet  to  be  fully  unfolded  in  Indonesia;   the\r\n\r\nescalation  of  the quarrel between Singapore  and  Malaysia;\r\n\r\nrepeatedly told of the great\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthreat  of China but not yet told of how Singaporeans  should\r\n\r\nwork  together to deal with this threat and turn it  into  an\r\n\r\nopportunity.  They were worried about the rising costs,  such\r\n\r\nas  how  the  increase in GST could add  to  their  household\r\n\r\ncosts.  The  talk  about CPF cuts has  raised  some  concern.\r\n\r\nPeople  are worried about how the CPF cuts will affect  their\r\n\r\nability  to  service  their housing mortgages.   Just  today,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a report in the front page of Business Times  that\r\n\r\nstates  that  \"Defaults on HDB mortgage loans on  the  rise\".\r\n\r\nThere were 19,400 households in arrears as at end March  this\r\n\r\nyear against 14,400 a year ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the bright side, there are reports of signs of\r\n\r\neconomic recovery in Singapore.  The Government has upped the\r\n\r\nforecast  of  the GDP growth rate.  In the US, which  is  our\r\n\r\nlargest trading and export partner, the Federal Reserve Board\r\n\r\nChairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, has said that signs of  recovery\r\n\r\nare evident.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In typical \"Greenspan\" speak, he recently said on 17th\r\n\r\nApril  2002 at a Joint Economic Committee hearing  that  \"the\r\n\r\nfoundation for economic expansion has been laid.\"  I think we\r\n\r\nhave  to  figure out ourselves what he meant  by  that.   But\r\n\r\nthere are also other economists and politicians who have said\r\n\r\nthat  it is still too early to tell. Such conflicting reports\r\n\r\nadd  to  the confusion and uncertainty.  We are living  in  a\r\n\r\nfast changing world with shifting sands, hazy future and  few\r\n\r\nguide posts to help us find our way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier in my speech, Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\ncannot help but feel that the Budget is only revealing a part\r\n\r\nof  the  big  picture on how the Government intends  to  take\r\n\r\nSingapore  into  the  future.  I would urge  the  leaders  to\r\n\r\nconclude the reviews of the ERC and the Remaking of Singapore\r\n\r\nexpeditiously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not try to fly too many trial balloons. Do not pick\r\n\r\nevery  stone to turn it up, and then merely put it back  down\r\n\r\nagain.  Do not mindlessly slaughter all our sacred cows, many\r\n\r\nhave served us well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in times of uncertainty, the people\r\n\r\nwant  strong and able leadership. The Government has  in  the\r\n\r\npast\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproven itself to be capable of tackling crises.  Work out the\r\n\r\nshort,  medium and long term plans quickly, explain  them  to\r\n\r\nthe people and then just get on with it.  We believe that  if\r\n\r\nwe  work  side by side together, Singapore could  once  again\r\n\r\npull  through this crisis.  All we need is the Government  to\r\n\r\npoint the way.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, today I would like\r\n\r\nto  address a number of issues which are related to the state\r\n\r\nof  the economy and will basically set the stage for a number\r\n\r\nof  recommendations which I hope to make during the next  two\r\n\r\nweeks of the Committee of Supply discussions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start by saying what I have said many times too\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore's economic development model  has  done  very\r\n\r\nwell  in  the  first 30 years of development.  Our  model  of\r\n\r\nbringing   in   foreign  direct  investments,   multinational\r\n\r\ncompanies  and even of developing Government-linked companies\r\n\r\nwas necessary to bring Singapore to where it is today and  it\r\n\r\nis a model that many countries try to emulate.  In developing\r\n\r\nstrategies   in  the  past,  we  did  however  develop   some\r\n\r\nstructural  problems  which I would  like  to  address  today\r\n\r\nbefore I talk about the Budget proper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fundamental problem of how our economy is\r\n\r\nstructured  can  be  traced  to the  role  of  Government  in\r\n\r\ninfluencing the economy. We are seeing our worst recession in\r\n\r\nour  history  since  independence, and  in  my  opinion,  the\r\n\r\napproach  we  took in developing our economy got outdated  as\r\n\r\nthe  new  economy  arrived.  Specifically, I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nhighlight a few areas where the Government had played a  role\r\n\r\nin  causing  some  of the problems, because of  its  dominant\r\n\r\npresence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the asset enhancement policy. The asset\r\n\r\nenhancement policy has been a key policy since the 1990s  and\r\n\r\nthe  key  goal  was  to  create wealth for  all  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthrough  owning properties that will increase in  value  over\r\n\r\ntime.   Little  did  we realise that this wealth  was  mostly\r\n\r\ngoing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be  unrealised or perhaps paper wealth.  Through a number\r\n\r\nof  Government  initiatives and policies, we  drove  property\r\n\r\nprices to untenable levels, much like how the Japanese  asset\r\n\r\nbubble  grew in the 1980s.  As has been told by history  many\r\n\r\ntimes  before,  the  bubbles  are  never  long-lasting.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment's  attempt  to  implement  the  asset  enhancement\r\n\r\npolicy  basically backfired, resulting in a vicious cycle  of\r\n\r\nartificial high costs of properties, high wages and the  high\r\n\r\ncost of doing business in Singapore.  The three policy levers\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Government  used that have created  this  vicious\r\n\r\ncircle   are:   firstly,  the  use  of  CPF  investments   in\r\n\r\nproperties,  resulting  in  Singaporeans  over-investing   in\r\n\r\nassets,  especially in properties; secondly, the  land  sales\r\n\r\npolicy and the approach of reserve pricing which artificially\r\n\r\npropped up the price of land, whether for private, commercial\r\n\r\nor  industrial land; and thirdly, the prices of new HDB flats\r\n\r\nwhich increased at unbelievable rates throughout the 1990s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the above levers were completely in the hands and\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  the Government.  Why do I say that this  is  the\r\n\r\ncause  of  our  economic problems and  hence  our  employment\r\n\r\nproblems?   The  answer  lies in the  vicious  cycle  that  I\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier.  The high cost of owning properties  drove\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  higher wages which added to  business  costs.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  as  commercial and industrial land  and  property\r\n\r\nprices went up, this eroded the margins for businesses.  This\r\n\r\ntherefore  accelerated the changes in the type of  industries\r\n\r\nwhich  could  operate  in Singapore  and  also  led  to  many\r\n\r\ncompanies  having  to exit from Singapore,  many  prematurely\r\n\r\nbecause of the high rate of increase of cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue which is structural in nature is one of\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked companies and is another significant factor\r\n\r\nand  the creation of these companies, which are called  State\r\n\r\nOwned  Enterprises  in many countries, is another  deliberate\r\n\r\nGovernment policy.  Being impatient about the development  of\r\n\r\ncertain  industries, the Government felt that they needed  to\r\n\r\nstep  in  and  create companies, using the reason  of  market\r\n\r\nfailure.  On the other hand, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment,   through   its  protective   policies,   created\r\n\r\nmonopolies which lasted for too long.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the issues that GLCs have created? I will\r\n\r\nbriefly  mention  some  of  them as  they  have  been  widely\r\n\r\ndebated.  The three main issues are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the stifling of entrepreneurship by using their\r\n\r\nresources in the GLCs, especially easy access to funds, to do\r\n\r\nthe  same  of what can be done by smaller players,  that  is,\r\n\r\nbefore they are publicly listed;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the crowding out of local companies, sometimes\r\n\r\nthrough unfair practices; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) dominating and predatory practices which result in\r\n\r\nforeign  companies  being compelled to  work  with  the  GLCs\r\n\r\ninstead of local companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third structural issue is one of the Government\r\n\r\ninfluencing  the  outcome  of the  economy.   The  Government\r\n\r\ncreated   many   economic  agencies  which  have   tremendous\r\n\r\ninfluence on the outcome of our economy.  If you talk to  any\r\n\r\nprivate sector company, whether big or small, they will  most\r\n\r\nlikely  agree that these agencies have had an impact on  what\r\n\r\nthey  do and how they do their business.  The Government  has\r\n\r\nbeen dominant in the following three areas:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) picking industries;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) picking winners in each industry; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) deciding on how funding and incentives should be\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;channelled.\r\n\r\nAll these influences are outcomes of our industries here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we have regulators also playing the role of\r\n\r\nindustry  developers, we run into problems.  Today, you  will\r\n\r\nsee  many private sector companies here which feel that  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  get the endorsement and the support of our economic\r\n\r\nagencies in order to get moving in their businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we still have the opportunities to be competitive\r\n\r\nin  certain  types  of industries if we  focus  on  enhancing\r\n\r\ncapabilities  and  productivity,  and  through  the  use   of\r\n\r\ntechnologies,   when   Government  agencies   start   picking\r\n\r\nindustries, they will never be able to do a good  job  simply\r\n\r\nbecause  they  do  not  have  a  feel  of  business  nor  the\r\n\r\nexperience  of business acumen to understand what  determines\r\n\r\nthe  success of a particular industry.  For this  reason,  we\r\n\r\nhave  not  been able to successfully create global  champions\r\n\r\nlike  Starbucks and McDonalds.  These industries would  never\r\n\r\nhave  been  on  the  radar screen of our  economic  agencies.\r\n\r\nInstead of planning the industries to the details and instead\r\n\r\nof   driving   industry  development  to  the  details,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  focus  on the  broad  strategies  and  be\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  only  creating  and facilitating  the  business\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are there no new world-class companies from\r\n\r\nSingapore?   I still remember the Government's bold  plan  of\r\n\r\nidentifying 500 world-class companies in a certain number  of\r\n\r\nyears.  We have missed the target by miles and if you ask me,\r\n\r\nI would have guessed that we would have missed simply because\r\n\r\nthe  Government was not capable of picking industry  winners.\r\n\r\nThe  various  Government  agencies have  relied  on  old  and\r\n\r\nirrelevant  measures  in  picking the  potential  winners  to\r\n\r\ngroom.   Schemes  like the Promising Local  Enterprise  (PLE)\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been  in place for so many  years  have  had  no\r\n\r\nsuccess  in finding real global winners except for a  handful\r\n\r\nof  companies which were excellent in their own  sense.   The\r\n\r\nyardsticks   measuring  promising  companies   have   to   be\r\n\r\ncompletely different from what we are used to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third structural issue is basically rules and\r\n\r\nregulations designed for multinational companies and GLCs and\r\n\r\nnot  for SMEs.  One of the clear issues we have today,  which\r\n\r\nis  a cause for concern, is a structural problem and that  is\r\n\r\nthe lack of local private enterprises and local entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nwho  are  able to develop world-class capabilities.  How  did\r\n\r\nthis  come  about?  We started rightfully with the industrial\r\n\r\neconomy driven by multinationals and then one dominated by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked  companies.  Our  administrators  basically\r\n\r\nfocused  on a regulatory system which was conducive for  both\r\n\r\ntypes of companies to operate in Singapore and they were big.\r\n\r\nThere  was nothing wrong with this in the beginning,  but  we\r\n\r\nnever got out of this mode, despite the many signals that  we\r\n\r\ngot  many  years  ago when we started seeing sleeping  giants\r\n\r\nlike  India and China opening up.  What we should  have  done\r\n\r\nwas  to  start shooting the laws to accommodate and encourage\r\n\r\nand  grow  local enterprises, particularly SMEs.   We  should\r\n\r\nhave  learnt  from countries like USA where  legislation  has\r\n\r\nbeen put in place for many years with SMEs at the core.   The\r\n\r\nfocus  for legislators and government administrators  in  the\r\n\r\nUSA  has been to create local private enterprises many  years\r\n\r\nago.   It  will  logically  follow then  that  if  rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations  work for SMEs, there should be no  problems  for\r\n\r\nthe  same  rules to work for larger companies.  The likes  of\r\n\r\ncompetition    laws,   Government   procurement   procedures,\r\n\r\nfinancing schemes and many others are examples of legislation\r\n\r\nwith  SMEs  in mind. Time is of essence for us in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe must make the necessary changes to our rules to facilitate\r\n\r\nthe development of our private enterprises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there were very high expectations for this year's\r\n\r\nBudget  because it was supposed to be a Budget for a new  and\r\n\r\ndifferent world.  I personally feel that there were  no  real\r\n\r\nnew initiatives to tackle the issues of the new world, except\r\n\r\nfor  the tax changes.  I was hoping that this could have been\r\n\r\ncalled  a  bold  new Budget, with creative  initiatives,  but\r\n\r\nfrankly  I feel that there has been nothing significant  this\r\n\r\nyear.   To  be fair, I believe that the Government  is  still\r\n\r\nwaiting  for  the  recommendations  of  the  Economic  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee  to  be  finalised before making the  bold  changes\r\n\r\nwhich   Singapore  badly  needs.   I  hope  that  after   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  are ready, the Minister will  not  wait  for\r\n\r\nnext  year's Budget to make more changes.  I feel that  there\r\n\r\nis  a  real  need  for  us  to  implement  measures  quickly,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  the area of the cost of doing  business  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and by waiting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoo  long,  it may result in the premature collapse  of  many\r\n\r\ncompanies   and  the  premature  departure  of  many   multi-nationals.  I would like to touch on a few areas which I feel\r\n\r\nshould have been addressed, but have not been done so in  the\r\n\r\nBudget   and,   I   hope,   in  anticipation   of   the   ERC\r\n\r\nrecommendations,  these issues will be  considered  seriously\r\n\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, the tax system. While I am in\r\n\r\ncomplete  agreement  to  go towards a consumption  based  tax\r\n\r\nsystem, I believe that we have been too quick to increase the\r\n\r\nGST  from  3% to 5%.  By all means, this should be the  long-term  target,  but by doing it so early, we  once  again  put\r\n\r\ntremendous  cost pressures on our companies even before  they\r\n\r\ncould  recover from the worst recession our nation has  seen.\r\n\r\nThe  real  short-term  improvement  that  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nsuggesting  is a mere 0.5% reduction in taxes since,  in  the\r\n\r\npreceding  years,  we  were  already  enjoying  tax  rebates,\r\n\r\nbringing  the effective tax rate down to 221 /  2%.   So,  by\r\n\r\ngoing down to 22% with a consequential increase of 2% in GST,\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  significant increase in cash out-flow  for  many\r\n\r\ncompanies.   The feedback that I have got from  a  number  of\r\n\r\npeople is that while a 20% maximum income tax level is  good,\r\n\r\nwe have not been radical enough.  We are still worse off than\r\n\r\nHong  Kong,  and  if  we include the many  other  taxes  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and Singapore-based companies are paying,  then\r\n\r\nwe  are still not very competitive.  While we may look better\r\n\r\nthan many countries like the USA and Germany, as the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  mentioned,  we must compare this against the  percentage\r\n\r\nreduction  these  countries have  made  as  compared  to  the\r\n\r\nreductions we have made.  The facts are as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the USA, as the Minister has mentioned, the effective\r\n\r\ntax  rate,  after  many  provisions,  is  actually  11%.   In\r\n\r\nGermany,  the  new tax rate is 25% compared to  the  previous\r\n\r\n40%.  This is a reduction of 37 1/2% for the 15%-point drop.\r\n\r\nWhereas in Singapore, we plan to reduce from 25% to 20%,  and\r\n\r\nthis is only a 20% reduction.  In Ireland, the tax rate is at\r\n\r\n12 1/2%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countries that I have mentioned are the ones that we\r\n\r\nshould compare against,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas we are trying to do the same things as all of them.  It is\r\n\r\nobvious  that compared to where they have gone,  our  changes\r\n\r\nare not radical enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue with this Budget is that we have not\r\n\r\naddressed the single most important issue, and this is on the\r\n\r\ncost  of doing business.  I mentioned about our vicious  cost\r\n\r\ncycle  and  the consequent impact on the cost of  businesses.\r\n\r\nThis   year's  Budget  clearly  did  not  address  this  very\r\n\r\nimportant issue.  On the contrary, we ended up adding to  the\r\n\r\ncost  problems  with the implementation of the additional  2%\r\n\r\nGST.  We may argue that companies will be able to offset this\r\n\r\nwith lower income taxes.  The problem is that this additional\r\n\r\n2%  adds  up to the cost upfront and affects cash  flows  and\r\n\r\nputs  additional strains on businesses, while the tax  is  an\r\n\r\nafter-the-fact phenomenon.  Many companies in the short  term\r\n\r\nmay  not even benefit from the lower taxes, because they will\r\n\r\nnot be making money in the first place.  I therefore urge the\r\n\r\nMinister to delay the implementation of the additional 2% GST\r\n\r\nuntil  the  business environment improves.   Why  the  hurry,\r\n\r\nespecially   since  the  Government  has  the  firepower   to\r\n\r\nwithstand lower tax collections for a short period?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless we find a solution for our structural cost\r\n\r\nproblems, we will have difficulties competing in any type  of\r\n\r\nindustries that we choose to compete in, including  those  in\r\n\r\nthe high value added activities.  Everything being equal,  we\r\n\r\nwill  still  lose out because of the cost when  it  comes  to\r\n\r\ncompeting  with any of the countries, whether it  is  Taiwan,\r\n\r\nChina,  Malaysia, Ireland or many others.  So we  should  not\r\n\r\nbrush  aside the cost issues by saying that those  industries\r\n\r\ndependent  on cost should be eliminated from Singapore  while\r\n\r\nwe  bring  in new industries.  The cost issue will linger  on\r\n\r\nwith us forever.  It is a structural problem and needs urgent\r\n\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are our cost problems? And everyone knows this.\r\n\r\nFirst, the high wages driven by high asset values.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, terribly high land cost leading to high rentals,\r\n\r\nthus eroding margins for businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the regime of hidden taxes which also erode\r\n\r\nmargins.   Let  us  for a moment try to add  all  the  taxes,\r\n\r\nlevies and charges which may seem small on their own in  some\r\n\r\ncases,  but all add up significantly.  Let me list  the  ones\r\n\r\nthat  I  can think of.  We have property taxes, petrol taxes,\r\n\r\nutilities  taxes, foreign worker levies, COEs,  ERP  charges,\r\n\r\nbusiness licences, Skills Development Fund contribution,  and\r\n\r\nthese  are all that I could think of when I was writing  this\r\n\r\nspeech.  I am sure there are many more that I do not have the\r\n\r\ntime  to think of.  These all add up and do have a high  cost\r\n\r\nimpact for businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of years ago, a prominent businessman from the\r\n\r\nSingapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry showed  me\r\n\r\na  computation  comparing  similar businesses  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nMalaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and his analysis showed  that\r\n\r\nbecause of all these hidden taxes, companies in Singapore are\r\n\r\ninherently  delivering weaker profits and much lower  margins\r\n\r\ncompared  to Malaysian and Hong Kong companies doing business\r\n\r\nin the same area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, Government charges like aviation and port\r\n\r\ncharges, Government fees, licence fees and the likes are also\r\n\r\nsignificant.  Adding to the cost problems are also  our  high\r\n\r\ntelecommunications charges compared to many  other  countries\r\n\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue that was missing in this Budget was help\r\n\r\nfor the small and medium enterprises (SMEs).  This is another\r\n\r\nregular topic for many of us from the private sector.   There\r\n\r\nwere  high  expectations of the Budget from local  companies,\r\n\r\nand  they  were disappointed that help did not come promptly.\r\n\r\nMany are struggling and have faced two consecutive recessions\r\n\r\nand  many  have  yet  to  come back  to  profitability.   The\r\n\r\nadditional cost burden, especially the increase in GST, could\r\n\r\ndeal  a  final blow to some of these companies.  I  mentioned\r\n\r\nabout  the  need to restructure our economy and to create  an\r\n\r\nenvironment  which  nurtures small  and  medium  enterprises.\r\n\r\nSMEs are not always looking for handouts, as has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npopularly  been talked about.  And I also do  not  support  a\r\n\r\nsubsidy   mentality,  because  I  believe  that  it   weakens\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  not  strengthens them.   All  SMEs  want  are\r\n\r\navenues which facilitate and not hinder their businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is that our SMEs face obstacles in many areas,\r\n\r\nincluding  when  they deal with Government  agencies.   Those\r\n\r\nwhich  are  bigger know how to get around the obstacles,  but\r\n\r\nthe smaller ones, particularly the start-ups, have tremendous\r\n\r\nproblems.   They  do  not  have the  resources  and  time  to\r\n\r\nmanoeuvre around the obstacles that they face.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other important problem they face is the access to\r\n\r\nfunds.   Once  again, SMEs are not asking for free  and  easy\r\n\r\nmoney.   They  just need the right channels and  institutions\r\n\r\nwhere  they are able to get the support.  For the banks,  the\r\n\r\neffort put in for too many small companies are just not worth\r\n\r\ntheir while and they prefer to deal with bigger clients,  and\r\n\r\na number of bankers have mentioned this very clearly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue for Singapore is also the fact that we are at\r\n\r\na  very  infant  stage  of our venture capital  (VC)  market,\r\n\r\ncreated by transplanting some big names from around the world\r\n\r\ninto  Singapore.   The problem with this transplant  is  that\r\n\r\nthese VCs operate in a very narrow range of investment cycle.\r\n\r\nWith  VCs on the one end and debt financing through banks  on\r\n\r\nthe  other end of the spectrum, we have one big vacuum  which\r\n\r\nshould  consist  of  a  whole slew of  financing  instruments\r\n\r\nconsisting  of  angel  investors, early stage  VCs,  hybrids,\r\n\r\nderivatives,  junk bonds, collateral and IP-based  financing,\r\n\r\nbrand  name  financing and many others.   If  the  Government\r\n\r\nwants  to  help  out  by  not getting  directly  involved  in\r\n\r\nbusinesses, then it should focus on developing the  financial\r\n\r\ninstruments that I have mentioned above.  It will go  a  long\r\n\r\nway  in  helping our SMEs.  This approach differs from giving\r\n\r\nhandouts and subsidies which we all want to avoid.   We  will\r\n\r\nsee two possible outcomes if nothing new is done\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  SMEs.  First, they will collapse and, second, they  will\r\n\r\nrelocate,  and  many of them are talking about relocating  to\r\n\r\nthe  nearest location they can think of and manage, and  that\r\n\r\nis  to  Malaysia.  And I know that many of them are seriously\r\n\r\nthinking of this right now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final issue about the Budget, and about most of\r\n\r\nthe  Budgets  that  we  have had in the  past,  is  that  the\r\n\r\napproach  that  we have taken to address the  cost  pressures\r\n\r\nduring  the  recession has been by temporarily bringing  down\r\n\r\nrentals,  charges, levies and taxes through rebates,  and  we\r\n\r\nhave become a nation of rebates, subsidies and grants.  While\r\n\r\nthis is good for the short term, it does nothing for the long\r\n\r\nterm.   On  the  contrary,  it sends  the  wrong  signals  to\r\n\r\ninvestors and companies that costs will go back again to  the\r\n\r\nhigh  levels  once  there is a sign  of  improvement  in  the\r\n\r\neconomy.  It may have worked in the past in keeping companies\r\n\r\ninvested in Singapore, but I think, by now, most of them have\r\n\r\nwised  up  to the reality that costs will come back  and  hit\r\n\r\nthem  over  and over again.  So, instead of using rebates  to\r\n\r\naddress our cost problems, it is more prudent and more useful\r\n\r\nto institute real cost reductions, whether in rentals, taxes,\r\n\r\nlevies  or charges.  It will allow companies to have a  long-term  view  of  things and plan to be in  Singapore  for  the\r\n\r\nlonger term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also have an issue with the approach that we have\r\n\r\ntaken  each  time when we run into an economic crisis.   Each\r\n\r\ntime,  we have put in place rebates for companies as well  as\r\n\r\nindividuals.   The signal that this gives to our  society  is\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  so tightly geared and fundamentally  stretched\r\n\r\nthat  each time something changes, we have to resort to  such\r\n\r\nmeasures to create some relief.  This indicates that  we  are\r\n\r\nliving  to  the brink and have very little room for  changes.\r\n\r\nWith  such tight margins, life can be very stressful and  one\r\n\r\ncan  understand why the Government has to come to the  rescue\r\n\r\nwith  rebates  and subsidies.  We really need to  permanently\r\n\r\nreset  the  whole  cost  structure so that  Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\ncompanies  here will have much more margins,  and  each  time\r\n\r\nthey face a crisis,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  will  then  not have to resort to rebates and  subsidies.\r\n\r\nAnd we should spend the next few years building up the margin\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans so that their lives do not have  to  be  so\r\n\r\nstretched and stressful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I started by saying that the Budget\r\n\r\nhas  not  been  bold  enough, contrary to  expectations  that\r\n\r\nsomething  significant should have been done in  this  year's\r\n\r\nBudget.   We know that we have to wait for the final  outcome\r\n\r\nof  the  ERC  recommendations.  I thought I should  take  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to give a sense of what I feel are bold  measures\r\n\r\nand  of  what it should really mean when the Government  says\r\n\r\nthat  there will be no \"sacred cows\" and that \"no stones will\r\n\r\nbe  left  unturned.\"  Here is my wish list of radical  things\r\n\r\nwhich we should do:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a 30% reduction in rentals, whether it is JTC or\r\n\r\nHDB  properties, and allowing property prices to decline  and\r\n\r\nto   find  their  right  levels,  without  propping  them  up\r\n\r\nartificially.  And if need be, the Government should step  in\r\n\r\nto  mop  up  any residual problems, even if it means  dipping\r\n\r\ninto the reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, bringing the income tax level down to 121/2%\r\n\r\nthat Ireland has.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, to spin off most of the GLCs, except for\r\n\r\nstrategic  ones like SIA, PSA and perhaps SingTel.   And  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should cut its ownership to less than 30% in  each\r\n\r\nof these GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, to help the SMEs with their problems before we\r\n\r\ncould develop a mature financing industry, to create a fourth\r\n\r\nlocal bank to service the SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, halve the petrol tax, halve the ERP charges,\r\n\r\nhalve the foreign worker levies and halve the property tax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, eliminate the need for yearly Government issued\r\n\r\nlicences  and  depend on income tax and GST  to  collect  all\r\n\r\nrevenues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh, reduce the size of the Government and the civil\r\n\r\nservice by 30% over a 5-year period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are radical things, just to give you a feel\r\n\r\nof  what  people are thinking of. The list can go on,  but  I\r\n\r\nthought  that I would give a feel of what being  bold  really\r\n\r\nmeans, from the perspective of the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I feel that it is too early to rejoice. When\r\n\r\nthe Minister revised the growth forecast from the previous 1-3%  to  the current 2-4%, I thought he was a little too quick\r\n\r\noff  the  mark.  Things are still very unclear, including  in\r\n\r\nthe  USA.   There are pockets of recovery, but  just  a  few.\r\n\r\nGood  times  will  come back, as we know, but  let  us  tread\r\n\r\ncarefully  for now and not let our guards down  too  quickly.\r\n\r\nBy  thinking that the economic recovery is going to come very\r\n\r\nsoon, I feel that the Government may get complacent in trying\r\n\r\nto  help  address  some  of  the  issues  that  I  have  just\r\n\r\nmentioned.  Sir, uncertainty still rules the day.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must commend Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit  Singh on his very interesting speech.  In fact,  it\r\n\r\nwas a good lecture, as far as I am concerned.  He has touched\r\n\r\non  cost issues and he has also given his wish list.   But  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is very difficult because whatever spare money  in\r\n\r\nthe  market,  the Government will mop them up.  Basically,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Government's intention is always to have  a  very\r\n\r\nstrong surplus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall touch again on this topic of Government\r\n\r\nsurplus.  In the past, in the debates on Budget statements, I\r\n\r\nhave  highlighted the obsession of the Government in  wanting\r\n\r\nto  budget  for a surplus for that year.  This year,  despite\r\n\r\nthe  recent economic recession that Singapore has  just  gone\r\n\r\nthrough,  the  Government is still bent on budgetting  for  a\r\n\r\nsurplus,  albeit  a modest sum at $0.9 billion,  compared  to\r\n\r\nother  years of $4-5 billion.  However, with the 2%  increase\r\n\r\nin GST and revenues from motorcars and other sources, I would\r\n\r\nnot  be  surprised at all if the Government ends  up  with  a\r\n\r\nbudget surplus close to $3 billion.  I have asked many  times\r\n\r\nin  this House why is there a need to have such a substantial\r\n\r\nbudget surplus every year.  If I am not mistaken, it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  reputed that Singapore has about US$140 billion  surplus.\r\n\r\nWhy is there a need to accumulate such a mind-boggling sum of\r\n\r\nmoney?   That colossal amount of money, I believe, is  mostly\r\n\r\ninvested abroad.  Singapore does not really benefit much from\r\n\r\nsuch  a  large sum of money in terms of improvement  for  its\r\n\r\npeople.   Our  quality  of  life  has  not  improved  by  our\r\n\r\nsurpluses when compared to those in the developed West.   Our\r\n\r\nindigenous industries have not in any way benefited from  our\r\n\r\nsurpluses.   Other than Creative Technology,  which  we  have\r\n\r\nheard  so  much,  we  cannot speak  much  of  our  home-grown\r\n\r\nindustries.  The surpluses are like huge monuments set up  to\r\n\r\ngive  repute  and  manifest the power of the PAP  Government.\r\n\r\nThe   surpluses   that  are  tucked  away  do   not   benefit\r\n\r\nSingaporeans very much in their daily lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surpluses remind me of the pyramids of ancient\r\n\r\nEgypt.   The  old  Pharaohs exuded power  and  might  in  the\r\n\r\npyramids  they  built.  At first, the people  of  Egypt  were\r\n\r\nhappy  and joyful to labour under the hot sun, to cut  stones\r\n\r\nand  drag  them  to build the pyramids for their  kings.   In\r\n\r\nlater  years,  when much of the stone supply in  neighbouring\r\n\r\nquarries  were  exhausted, the Pharaohs  had  to  source  for\r\n\r\nstones  further  and further away.  By then,  the  people  of\r\n\r\nEgypt  were quite exhausted.  They could not see the  purpose\r\n\r\nof  building those huge monuments to perpetuate the  rule  of\r\n\r\nthe  Pharaohs.  The Pharaohs had to use force  to  get  their\r\n\r\npeople  to  work  hard, to go further and further  afield  to\r\n\r\nbring the stones back to construct the pyramids.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope that the huge amounts of surpluses the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has accumulated are not just for the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nperpetuating the PAP rule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that, at the present time, the economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties   of   our   people  are   not   resolved   yet.\r\n\r\nUnemployment  stands at about 5%, and the world  economy  has\r\n\r\nnot   really   picked  up.   Times  are   still   tough   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Yet, the Government goes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nahead to force the people to pay an additional 2% GST on what\r\n\r\nthey  consume.  Government coffers shall probably swell by  a\r\n\r\ncouple  of  billion  dollars.  If this  is  not  pushing  our\r\n\r\nworkers  to work harder and contribute to the income  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  I  do  not know what is.  The  workers  and  the\r\n\r\npoorer Singaporeans shall probably suffer a double blow.   On\r\n\r\nthe one hand, the GST is raised to 5% and, on the other hand,\r\n\r\nretailers  and  hawkers shall seize the  opportunity  of  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  GST  to  raise  their  prices.   When  GST  was\r\n\r\nintroduced in 1994, prices were increased by about 20%.  This\r\n\r\ntime  round,  since  the  GST is  pegged  at  5%,  the  price\r\n\r\nincreases  shall  most likely be more than  20%.   This  will\r\n\r\ncause  hardship  to households with old people,  infants  and\r\n\r\nother dependants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the people's part, they must be urged not to give in\r\n\r\nto hawkers and shopkeepers who practise blatant profiteering.\r\n\r\nUntil now, without the Fair Trading Act or other statutes  to\r\n\r\ncontrol unfair trading, the Government and CASE cannot really\r\n\r\ndo  much.  I am wondering how the proposed committee to check\r\n\r\non prices can be useful when it has no enforcement powers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB flat dwellers are concerned at the impending\r\n\r\nincrease in the monthly parking fees.  At the moment,  it  is\r\n\r\npegged  at $55 a month for one parking lot.  At $55, the  HDB\r\n\r\nis  already getting more than the land cost.  It is therefore\r\n\r\nunfair and unnecessary to increase the cost of parking at HDB\r\n\r\nhousing  estates.  If the monthly parking fees are increased,\r\n\r\nthen  it  is a case of the Government giving rebates  to  HDB\r\n\r\nflat  dwellers on the one hand and taking them back with  the\r\n\r\nother.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the increase in GST, I hope the Government\r\n\r\nshall commit to holding down the GST at 5% and give a promise\r\n\r\nnot to increase it for at least five years beginning from 1st\r\n\r\nJanuary next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of Community Development and Sports (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what we have heard from the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister and Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Finance, I believe, is a pro-growth, pro-job  and,  very\r\n\r\nimportantly,  a  caring Budget.  We heard Mr  Inderjit  Singh\r\n\r\nwanting  to  do  very radical things.  I think  some  of  the\r\n\r\nproposals  may make very good economic sense.   But  when  we\r\n\r\nconsider people's feelings as well as the kind of people  who\r\n\r\nmay be most affected by such radical changes, the outcome can\r\n\r\nbe disastrous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, in Singapore, are faced with a very big dilemma. We\r\n\r\nmust compete with the potential competitors around the region\r\n\r\nand  win.  Because if we do not, we get skinned!  And we were\r\n\r\ntold  that there were many ways of skinning us.  But, on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  if we have a Budget which is perfectly  correct\r\n\r\neconomically, but without due care for the people who may  be\r\n\r\nvery  badly  affected, then I think we will face an  internal\r\n\r\ncollapse.   We  lose  cohesion; we lose unity.   We  will  be\r\n\r\nfinished with all our bones broken.  We either lose  all  our\r\n\r\nskin  or lose all our bones.  Hence, we need a balanced, pro-growth, pro-job and, at the same time, caring Budget.  It may\r\n\r\nnot  appear  radical at first, but with clear  direction  and\r\n\r\nconsistent implementation, it will all add up over time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are facing a situation very similar to what we\r\n\r\nwere  going through in the late 60s and the early 70s.   Just\r\n\r\nlike  that  time,  we  have to generate growth,  we  have  to\r\n\r\ngenerate  jobs, we have to preserve the value of our savings,\r\n\r\nand  we  have  to ensure that we do not have hyper  inflation\r\n\r\nthat  eats  away confidence and strength.  And that  explains\r\n\r\nwhy  we  cannot have deficit financing, certainly  not  on  a\r\n\r\nlarge  scale - cutting 30% here, 40% there.  Such sudden  and\r\n\r\npanic action will scare away foreign investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that on the unity part, I read the 4th May\r\n\r\nLianhe Zaobao and I found something very exceptional.  I  see\r\n\r\nMr Chiam See Tong, in a sense, giving some support to what we\r\n\r\nare  trying to do, saying that whatever that is given out  in\r\n\r\nthis Budget as relief is more than enough to balance off  the\r\n\r\nincreased tax liability on the people who are poor.  He  even\r\n\r\nsaid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  while there can be concern about profiteering, he would\r\n\r\nbe  very  happy to join the Committee to Combat Profiteering.\r\n\r\nWell,  may  I  say that I sincerely invite him  to  join  the\r\n\r\nCommittee and work with us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are here to achieve unity. We are here to involve\r\n\r\neverybody  to  support the new measures and the  new  Budget,\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  our  economic  restructuring.   In  combating\r\n\r\nprofiteering, we are going to invite the local  community  to\r\n\r\njudge  whether  a  certain undue price  increase  amounts  to\r\n\r\nprofiteering.  If it is, we will try to talk to  the  traders\r\n\r\nfor  precisely the same reason that Mr Chiam and Mr  Inderjit\r\n\r\nbrought  up,  that the traders were also subjected  to  price\r\n\r\npressures,  some  of  which might be  beyond  their  control.\r\n\r\nMaybe  the sole distributor may have jacked up prices because\r\n\r\nof  certain  international pricing  policies  set  elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhat  is important for us is to ensure that people feel  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  a  Budget that is really fair to everybody.   Well,\r\n\r\nmaybe  not entirely fair to everybody, as not everybody would\r\n\r\nagree that the Budget is totally fair to him.  But seen as  a\r\n\r\npackage,  I  think  we  have benefited here  and  there,  and\r\n\r\neverybody feels that it is something worth supporting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say to Mr Chiam that he might want to let me\r\n\r\nknow   later   whether  he  wants  to  accept  this   sincere\r\n\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think many hon. Members will be talking about the\r\n\r\neconomic and financial aspects of Budget.  I would just  want\r\n\r\nto  emphasise on the heartware aspect.  We are  going  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  a  very,  very important phase in order  to  face  a\r\n\r\nchanged world.  We want to be able to face this changed world\r\n\r\nas a people, as a people who feel that we have got a stake in\r\n\r\nthis nation.  Therefore, we have to ensure that our Budget or\r\n\r\nour   economic   policy   is  well   balanced   with   people\r\n\r\nunderstanding it, with people feeling that they play  a  part\r\n\r\nin  it, and with people supporting it.  In the 1970s, we were\r\n\r\nable  to  achieve unity of the people and we steered  through\r\n\r\nthe  then  difficult economic situation.   Not  only  did  we\r\n\r\ncreate an economic miracle, we also built a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  are now at the crossroads again.  We want to ensure  that\r\n\r\nall  of us, cosmopolitans and heartlanders, feel that we  are\r\n\r\ntogether on this ship, each playing a role in sailing through\r\n\r\nthis  difficult  stretch of water.  If we sail  through  this\r\n\r\ndifficult  stretch  of water, then we  would  emerge  with  a\r\n\r\nstronger Singapore to face the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Sir, many people, when\r\n\r\nasked  what  they thought about the recent Budget  2002,  had\r\n\r\ndescribed it as a \"balanced\" Budget.  I would like to use the\r\n\r\nword \"surgical\" to describe the Budget.  Let me explain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister for Finance has said, we are in a very\r\n\r\ndifferent world.  As a result of all that has happened around\r\n\r\nus  in  the  recent year or two, Singapore, like  many  other\r\n\r\ncountries, faces many challenges that affect the economic and\r\n\r\nsocial  conditions.   The  Budget  addresses  many  of  these\r\n\r\nchallenges and concerns in a pragmatic approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight four areas that I feel the pro-business Budget underscores the surgical aspect that I am\r\n\r\nreferring to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the reduction in corporate taxes. Business\r\n\r\nperformance is key to our nation's survival.  I am happy that\r\n\r\nthe  corporate tax is being reduced from 24.5% to 22% for the\r\n\r\nYear  of Assessment 2003, and a plan to further reduce it  to\r\n\r\n20% by financial year 2004.  This is good news.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For companies with deferred tax liabilities, a reduction\r\n\r\nin  corporate tax rates will result in an immediate reduction\r\n\r\nin  their  deferred tax liabilities.  Companies  with  a  big\r\n\r\ncapital  expenditure programme on their balance  sheets  will\r\n\r\nthen have an improved net asset position and tax write-backs.\r\n\r\nSome  of  our  bigger companies that fall into this  category\r\n\r\nwill  have a direct benefit as a consequence of the reduction\r\n\r\nin corporate taxes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What many may not know is that the cut in the corporate\r\n\r\ntax by a 2 percentage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npoint also means that the estimated market earnings per share\r\n\r\n(EPS)  of  a company may rise by about 2%.  A combination  of\r\n\r\nthese two factors, ie, improved net asset position and a rise\r\n\r\nin  EPS,  makes these companies very attractive to investors.\r\n\r\nThis  gives investors a very clear signal that the Government\r\n\r\nis serious in promoting companies in this position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the business community's and hon. Members'\r\n\r\nrequest  for  group relief for losses has  been  answered  in\r\n\r\nBudget 2002.  It is indeed a welcome news and all too timely.\r\n\r\nBy  allowing qualifying companies within a group to  transfer\r\n\r\ntheir  current  year's  unutilised  capital  allowances   and\r\n\r\nlosses,  it  helps  businesses reduce  some  risks  in  doing\r\n\r\nbusiness.   It echoes the Government's call to businesses  to\r\n\r\nbe more entrepreneurial and to explore new ventures.  By this\r\n\r\none  stroke, it also reduces the high effective tax rates  in\r\n\r\ntheir consolidated accounts and cash flow problems due to tax\r\n\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on the GST increase. The GST increase will\r\n\r\nimpact  some businesses that are not registered for  GST  who\r\n\r\nincur  the  increase  of  2%  on  their  purchases  from  GST\r\n\r\nregistered suppliers, and residential property developers and\r\n\r\nfinancial  services industry that may not fully recover  some\r\n\r\ninput  tax.   With  the specific tax changes  for  businesses\r\n\r\ncoupled with the corporate tax decrease, it may mitigate some\r\n\r\nof  these effects.  For some SMEs, for example, if they  have\r\n\r\nprivate  cars  that they use for their marketing  force,  the\r\n\r\ncharges for the repairs on these cars may not be claimable by\r\n\r\nthe company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For individuals, the offset package that will accompany\r\n\r\nthe  GST  increase is not only comprehensive but is flexible.\r\n\r\nAs  the  Minister  has said that, should the  need  arise,  a\r\n\r\nreview to extend the package beyond the five-year time  frame\r\n\r\nis  possible,  this  package will benefit  the  lower  income\r\n\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth highlight is in the area of transport and\r\n\r\nlogistics.   We  are  faced  with extreme  competition.   The\r\n\r\nextension of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApproved International Shipping Enterprise Scheme to  enhance\r\n\r\nthe  attractiveness for international shipping  companies  is\r\n\r\ncrucial  at this time.  We need to tackle the possible  slide\r\n\r\nin contribution to our GDP from this area with some urgency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if necessary, I hope that the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\ncan  support  an  allocation  of a  supplementary  budget  to\r\n\r\nreinforce our position in the transport and logistics sector,\r\n\r\nas it is not only the threat of a reduced contribution to GDP\r\n\r\nfrom this sector but recent events have shown that a loss  to\r\n\r\nanother  competitive  party  has  impinged  somewhat  on  our\r\n\r\nnational morale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, I am kiasu. In this matter, we\r\n\r\ncannot  lose.  Not yet.  Not when our other engines  that  we\r\n\r\nare  building in R&D, biotech, life sciences, and so on, have\r\n\r\nnot taken off yet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong mentioned that the Government's\r\n\r\nintention  is  always to have a strong  surplus.   Without  a\r\n\r\nstrong  surplus, we would not have been able to dish out  the\r\n\r\npackage  that we did last year to help our citizens.   Kuwait\r\n\r\nhas  oil.  Brunei has oil.  They can extract their oil,  send\r\n\r\nit  overseas and invest, and when need to, they could call on\r\n\r\nthose  resources.  We do not have oil.  We do not have water.\r\n\r\nAnd I do not think it is possible to squeeze water or oil out\r\n\r\nof this sand that we are using to reclaim land around us.  It\r\n\r\nis  just like what Mr Lim Swee Say mentioned earlier on, this\r\n\r\nis  the  character of the PAP Government.  Mr  Lim  mentioned\r\n\r\nthat   we  have  reserves  of  about  100  times  our   daily\r\n\r\nconsumption of water in our reservoirs.  Money is like water.\r\n\r\nIn  that sense, it can never be enough.  But we are using  it\r\n\r\nand directing it to help our citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when Mr Mah had one minute left to\r\n\r\nanswer  some  of  the points that Mr Chiam brought  up  about\r\n\r\npromises  that we have to keep, may I remind him  that,  ever\r\n\r\nsince  the  elections, almost every other day, we  have  been\r\n\r\nkeeping our promises.  The ERC has been meeting almost  every\r\n\r\nother  day  involving citizens and non-citizens to  keep  our\r\n\r\neconomy and engine going.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, permit me to continue by using some aeronautical\r\n\r\nparlance.   In  the early 80s, as a result of  our  pragmatic\r\n\r\napproach  to  economic planning, we enjoyed economic  growth,\r\n\r\nemployment  was  not  a  problem,  foreign  investments  were\r\n\r\npouring in, so the economy accelerated and we went aerobatic.\r\n\r\nThen in the mid-80s, Singapore faced a difficult period.  The\r\n\r\neconomy  went  acrobatic.  During that period,  many  of  our\r\n\r\nbusinesses  had to take the flips, the twists, the  yaws  and\r\n\r\nthe  pitch as the economy spun.  Well, we went from aerobatic\r\n\r\nto  acrobatic,  and it certainly was not very  aromatic  when\r\n\r\nparts  of  the economy sputtered and many splattered  towards\r\n\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now, we are in a very different world,\r\n\r\nwhere economies are so intertwined that even with the control\r\n\r\nof  the  joysticks  in our hands, the deliberate  actions  on\r\n\r\nthose  joysticks  may not produce an exact  response  to  the\r\n\r\ninput.  As our Leader of the House, Mr Wong Kan Seng, put  it\r\n\r\nin  his speech on a sitting on 31st August 1985, and I  quote\r\n\r\nhim,  \"economics is not an exact science\".  In the  world  of\r\n\r\ntoday,  the aircraft must be built with a fuselage  that  can\r\n\r\ntake  the  spins,  the twists, the yaws, the  pitch  and  the\r\n\r\nforces  in  the environment through which it has to navigate.\r\n\r\nThe PAP Government had been building this fuselage, inspected\r\n\r\nit as it went through some stress testing as late as the 1998\r\n\r\nAsian  financial crisis and as recent as the global  economic\r\n\r\nslowdown  that  began last year.  This  Budget  will,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion, contribute to strengthening that fuselage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need our people and our businesses to understand that\r\n\r\nwe need to adapt to new forces that are already upon us as we\r\n\r\ngo  about in our lives today.  We have built and strengthened\r\n\r\nthe  fuselage,  but  it  is only as  good  as  the  crew  and\r\n\r\npassengers  to  take the physical stresses the  fuselage  can\r\n\r\nwithstand.  In this changed world, our economy, our  country,\r\n\r\nhas  to  be  able to navigate the crowded airspace  with  new\r\n\r\nengines  for  this  fuselage.  We have to  jettison  the  old\r\n\r\nengines and snap on new ones that will take us through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget encourages the production and the ultimate\r\n\r\npromotion  of those engines.  As I have mentioned earlier,  I\r\n\r\nliken  these new engines to the areas of biotechnology,  life\r\n\r\nsciences,  the  businesses of R&D and intellectual  property.\r\n\r\nThe budget also secures the fuel to drive these engines.   It\r\n\r\nprovides the technology to operate and, more importantly, the\r\n\r\nability to tune these engines while we are in mid-flight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is much like the Formula One car, where the\r\n\r\nsuspension  set  up  can  be  adjusted  from  the   technical\r\n\r\ndirectors'  computer via radio signals from the pit  lane  as\r\n\r\nthe  car  races around the circuit.  They do this to  account\r\n\r\nfor  the  changes  in  the  race  conditions  brought  on  by\r\n\r\nvariables, such as fuel load changes as the car gets  lighter\r\n\r\nfurther along a race and changes in the track temperature  as\r\n\r\na  result  of  the weather, and we know how controllable  the\r\n\r\nweather is!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has to adapt as we race along. The changes to\r\n\r\nthe economic, social and security aspects demand that we have\r\n\r\nto adapt on the fly, except that our race is for survival and\r\n\r\nto provide a better way of life for the four million of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Budget has been surgical in that\r\n\r\nit  fixes the areas that need to be mended, reinforces  areas\r\n\r\nthat need to be stronger, and it reconstructs areas that need\r\n\r\nto be more flexible.  And I hope that during the Committee of\r\n\r\nSupply,  we  will  be  touching more  on  SMEs  and  cost  of\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concert, Sir, this Budget is what I will call an ERS,\r\n\r\nnot  the  Economic Restructuring Shares, but this  Budget  is\r\n\r\nexpedient, it resuscitates or revitalises areas that needs it\r\n\r\nand,  if  I  may borrow the expression, it is \"right  on  the\r\n\r\nmoney\" in its specificity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou for allowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Budget Statement was made on 3rd May, there\r\n\r\nhas  been  much discussion in society.  And as expected,  the\r\n\r\nmost  discussed  areas were the GST increase and  its  offset\r\n\r\npackage,  and the cuts to corporate and personal income  tax.\r\n\r\nSome individuals say that they will not benefit from the  tax\r\n\r\ncuts  because  they were already not paying any  income  tax.\r\n\r\nSome  business people lament that the corporate tax cuts will\r\n\r\nnot help them if their business is bad and there is no profit\r\n\r\nto be taxed, and therefore no tax to be saved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the GST increase, we hear fears about it triggering\r\n\r\ninflation  and profiteering, driving up the cost  of  living.\r\n\r\nAnd  turning to the offset package, some pointed out that  it\r\n\r\nmight  not  be enough to offset the tax in their  case.   One\r\n\r\nperson  at a dialogue asked, \"Even if it is enough to  offset\r\n\r\nfor  five years, what happens after five years?\"  And another\r\n\r\npointed  out  that since the offset package cost  almost  the\r\n\r\nsame  as the expected increased GST collection, why not  save\r\n\r\nthe effort and do the tax cuts?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans are indeed paying great attention to\r\n\r\nhow  these  measures  are affecting them individually  or  as\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   This is understandable and to be expected.   It\r\n\r\nis  in fact a good sign that Singaporeans are concerned about\r\n\r\nthe impact of policies and have done the calculations and are\r\n\r\nvoicing  their reactions and concerns.  The challenge  before\r\n\r\nus  now  is  how, having listened to those reactions,  do  we\r\n\r\nconnect  those  views with our process here  in  this  Budget\r\n\r\ndebate,   to  yield  the  best  outcome  for  Singapore   and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the budget session is an annual exercise,\r\n\r\nit is by no means a routine or a mere ritual.  When we decide\r\n\r\non  the  budget, we do not just vote money for the Government\r\n\r\nMinistries and Departments to continue operating as they are.\r\n\r\nWhen  we ask questions on the budget, we do not ask them just\r\n\r\nto  make a display or to give a semblance of scrutiny, or  to\r\n\r\ncreate work and stress for those who have to answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the budget is the means to carry out the intent of\r\n\r\nthis  House.   It  is the ship that sails us to  our  desired\r\n\r\ndestination  in the future.  And if we build a ship  that  is\r\n\r\nstructurally weak, or that lands us in a different place from\r\n\r\nthat which we want to head, then we will be in trouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of ships, I am reminded of the story of the\r\n\r\nTitanic - not the love story that came to our cinema screens,\r\n\r\nbut  the real disaster that killed more than 1,500 people  on\r\n\r\nthe  high  seas.   The Titanic  was touted as an  \"unsinkable\r\n\r\nship\"   in   its   design.   It  had  15  airtight   buoyancy\r\n\r\ncompartments that were supposed to be impervious to piercing.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, its designers calculated that even  if  four  of\r\n\r\nthe  15 compartments did puncture, it would still have enough\r\n\r\nbuoyancy  to  stay  afloat.  Added to that was  sophisticated\r\n\r\ncommunications  equipment of the time, and additional  safety\r\n\r\nprovisions such as some lifeboats.  Hence, the maiden  trans-Atlantic voyage of the Titanic was supposed to be nothing but\r\n\r\npure  fun  and  enjoyment for all those on board.   For  what\r\n\r\ncould go wrong?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Titanic, as we all know, sank after hitting an\r\n\r\niceberg.  Was it an unfortunate accident that could not  have\r\n\r\nbeen avoided?  Records showed that the ship received at least\r\n\r\nsix  warnings of icebergs before the hit.  The warnings  were\r\n\r\nnot taken seriously.  Maybe people were more caught up in the\r\n\r\nrevelry and game of one-upmanship to see who could get better\r\n\r\nseats at the ship's theatre.  Maybe the captain and crew  did\r\n\r\nnot  act on the signs because they were complacent about what\r\n\r\nthey thought were the \"unsinkable\" design of their ship,  and\r\n\r\nsaw no need to prepare the passengers for what was happening.\r\n\r\nMaybe  they  dismissed too readily what seemed to  be  little\r\n\r\npieces of floating ice until the hit revealed the rest of the\r\n\r\nicy mountain that lurked beneath the surface.  Whatever their\r\n\r\nthoughts  were, when the accident happened, there  was  utter\r\n\r\nchaos  and  confusion,  as the population  on  board  plunged\r\n\r\ntotally unprepared into the sea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the aftermath of the disaster, fingers were pointed\r\n\r\nin many places and at many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfaces.  Why did the captain and crew not take the ice warning\r\n\r\nsignals seriously?  Then there was another ship nearby  which\r\n\r\ncould  have helped but did not.  Why?  There were not  enough\r\n\r\nlifeboats  relative to the number of passengers.  Why?   Some\r\n\r\nmen  were  rushing to get onto the lifeboats, denying  places\r\n\r\nfor  women  and  children.  Why?  Whatever the  reasons,  one\r\n\r\nthing  is  for  sure.  No answer, however  comprehensive  and\r\n\r\nwise,  could  bring back one lost life.  It  simply  was  too\r\n\r\nlate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the often-told story of the Titanic is one of\r\n\r\ntragedy,  drama  and heroism at the point of  disaster.   The\r\n\r\nseldom  mentioned  story,  and  that  which,  to  me,  is  of\r\n\r\nimmeasurably greater value, is the prevention and preparation\r\n\r\nthat  could have gone into avoiding the disaster.  But  alas,\r\n\r\nprevention  and  preparation are never as glamorous  as  high\r\n\r\ndrama, and so are often overlooked.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the Titanic story to do with our Budget debate?\r\n\r\nEverything, in my view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the President addressed this House in March\r\n\r\nthis year, he reminded us that \"the world has changed\".   And\r\n\r\nit  was  in the context of that changed setting that he  laid\r\n\r\nout the future direction of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister in his Budget Statement said, \"We\r\n\r\nare   entering  a  very  different  world.   Conditions   are\r\n\r\nuncertain  and  volatile, competition is intense,  change  is\r\n\r\nfaster  than  ever.  Our ability to adapt nimbly and  quickly\r\n\r\nwill give us a valuable edge.  In our personal lives too,  we\r\n\r\nmust expect change and disruption.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the iceberg warnings to us. They define\r\n\r\nthe  setting  around which this Budget must  be  built.   The\r\n\r\ncentral  purpose  of  this Budget is  therefore  not  a  mere\r\n\r\nroutine  or  ritual.  It is our opportunity to  redesign  our\r\n\r\nship,  Singapore,  so that it can sail the  stormy  seas  and\r\n\r\nbring  us to our destination safely.  We must be careful  not\r\n\r\nto become Titanic II.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then should we structure our policies to maximise\r\n\r\nour hopes?  Sir, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  like to suggest three areas for consideration.  First,\r\n\r\nto   increase   awareness   of  the   fundamentally   changed\r\n\r\ncircumstances  among the population.  For without  widespread\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and  acceptance  of  the  new  situation,  old\r\n\r\npatterns of behaviour will continue to be entrenched.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my concern is that despite the many jobs that have\r\n\r\nbeen lost, and the many pronouncements of change and need for\r\n\r\nfundamental  adjustments, I think the message is  still  just\r\n\r\nscratching the surface of our collective awareness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we ask ourselves what proportion of our population\r\n\r\nhave become keenly aware of these wrenching changes that  are\r\n\r\naltering  the way work and employment are structured  in  our\r\n\r\neconomy, what would be our estimate?  If we ask of those  who\r\n\r\nare   aware,   what  proportion  among  them  is   responding\r\n\r\nproactively, what would be our estimate?  If we do  not  know\r\n\r\nthe   answers  to  these  questions,  or  if  we  think   the\r\n\r\nproportions  are  still low, then we  must  consider  how  to\r\n\r\nredouble  our  efforts in this area.  The Government  on  its\r\n\r\npart  must  consider  how  best to  coordinate  the  flow  of\r\n\r\ninformation from the labour market to the student and working\r\n\r\npopulations  on  a  sustained basis.  Improved  knowledge  of\r\n\r\nsupply  and  demand  conditions, and the ways  that  work  is\r\n\r\nstructured  are key to helping both students and workers  set\r\n\r\nand adjust to realistic expectations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get the message out on a strong, sustained basis\r\n\r\ncannot just be the work of the Government.  It is not only  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of information and resources to mount communication\r\n\r\ncampaigns.  It is also about the strength and credibility  of\r\n\r\nnetworks   and  how  these  can  be  tapped   to   speed   up\r\n\r\ndissemination, acceptance and response.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to my second point, which is the need to\r\n\r\nrally  the  public, private and people sectors to  work  more\r\n\r\nclosely   together   to   achieve   national   progress   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  We must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecognize that it is only through such a partnership approach\r\n\r\nthat  the  different  strengths of  the  three  sectors  will\r\n\r\nreinforce each other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector is the engine of economic growth and\r\n\r\nwealth   creation.    It  must  identify  opportunities   for\r\n\r\ninvestment    and   break   barriers   through    innovation,\r\n\r\nresourcefulness  and  sheer  grit  to  make  a   success   of\r\n\r\nenterprise.  How far have our businesses come to  terms  with\r\n\r\nthe changed landscape?  What are their strategies to overcome\r\n\r\nthe challenges posed by a saw-tooth economic growth path?  Do\r\n\r\nthey  expect to win by out-competing their rivals to  capture\r\n\r\nmarket  share  and revenue growth?  Or do they just  hope  to\r\n\r\nsurvive  through more cost savings and rebates?  And  indeed,\r\n\r\nhow  are  employers  fulfilling  their  role  as  responsible\r\n\r\ncorporate  citizens to help prepare workers for  the  changed\r\n\r\nenvironment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a time when circumstances were much more stable,\r\n\r\nit  may  be  viable  or  desirable for the  State  to  decide\r\n\r\nindustrial policy and for businesses to simply toe the  line.\r\n\r\nIn   the   complexity  of  today's  environment,  much   more\r\n\r\nvisioning, strategizing and path finding must come  from  the\r\n\r\nbusinesses  themselves.   Enabling businesses  to  strengthen\r\n\r\nthemselves  in  these areas is key to our future.   For  this\r\n\r\nreason,  enterprise  development must continue  to  be  given\r\n\r\nheavy weightage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector has great clout in Singapore. Through\r\n\r\nits  policies and commitment of resources, it signals to  the\r\n\r\nrest of the society the direction that the country will head.\r\n\r\nFor  example, when 45 % of the Government Budget is  proposed\r\n\r\nto be allocated to Social Development, with Education, Health\r\n\r\nand  Community  Development  and Sports  getting  substantial\r\n\r\nincreases, it signals the Government's emphasis on human  and\r\n\r\nsocial capital.  Similarly, when the Government says that  it\r\n\r\n\"will  not  stint  in  its  support for  workers  to  upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves\",  we know that the employability  of  workers  is\r\n\r\ntopmost on the mind of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the role of Government is more than just using its\r\n\r\nannual Budget allocations to signal its priorities.  It  also\r\n\r\nhas the critical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrole  of setting up and managing a conducive environment  and\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, so that the overall goals of society could be\r\n\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to highlight two specific points. If\r\n\r\ntax revenues and Budget surpluses are most likely going to be\r\n\r\nreduced  and become more volatile, then how should Government\r\n\r\nagencies plan their services?  Clearly, they cannot go on the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  \"straight  line  projections  from  the  past,  or\r\n\r\nbusiness  as usual\".  On the other hand, it may not  be  wise\r\n\r\nfor  Government  services to match the volatility  of  cycles\r\n\r\nlike  the  private sector business would  try  to  do.   Some\r\n\r\nservices,  such as those in social development, may  arguably\r\n\r\nhave   funding  needs  that  are  counter-cyclical.    Hence,\r\n\r\nMinistries   and   departments,  just  like  businesses   and\r\n\r\nindividuals,  must  examine  the  implications  of  the   new\r\n\r\neconomic   landscape  and  adjust  their  work   accordingly.\r\n\r\nClearly,  in  such an environment, more must be  done  to  be\r\n\r\nfrugal  in expenditure and to maximise savings from  improved\r\n\r\nproductivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must also continue to invest in long-term\r\n\r\ninfrastructure   and   capability  building   to   strengthen\r\n\r\nSingapore's place as an investment location and hub.  How are\r\n\r\nMinistries   and  statutory  agencies  being   measured   for\r\n\r\ninvestments  and outcomes in these areas?  My concern  simply\r\n\r\nis  that  \"what  gets measured gets done.\"   In  the  private\r\n\r\nsector, unbridled pursuit of shareholder value and return  on\r\n\r\ninvestment,  asset and cost of capital have  accentuated  the\r\n\r\nalready  short-term  orientation.  Chief Executives  may  not\r\n\r\nalways   be  interested  in  the  long-term  good  of   their\r\n\r\ncompanies, because they do not expect to be there in the long\r\n\r\nterm  to  inherit  either the rewards or  the  mess.   In  an\r\n\r\nenvironment  of  reduced surpluses and more uncertainty  over\r\n\r\ntax  revenues, there may, at times, be similar temptation for\r\n\r\nthe  public  sector to let up on longer-term  commitments  in\r\n\r\nfavour of projects that yield more immediate returns,  or  to\r\n\r\ninadvertently drive up costs of services and assets in  order\r\n\r\nto  show  a  return.  So we must ensure that our  performance\r\n\r\nindicators for the public sector continue to let a long  term\r\n\r\nview to be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people sector is an equal partner in this tripartite\r\n\r\nrelationship.  It is not a \"remainder sector\" that  picks  up\r\n\r\nthe  pieces  that neither the public nor the  private  sector\r\n\r\nwishes  to deal with.  By its vision, focus and capabilities,\r\n\r\nit  encourages  and amplifies the efforts of  Government  and\r\n\r\nenterprise  toward social cohesion.  Encouraging philanthropy\r\n\r\nis  a  good  example of an action that links the three  parts\r\n\r\ntogether  for the benefit of the less fortunate  in  society.\r\n\r\nStrengthening the relationship between the Government, labour\r\n\r\nand employers is another example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential of the people sector is immense. In an\r\n\r\nincreasingly uncertain and stress-filled world, many  of  the\r\n\r\nservices provided by the people sector, such as social  work,\r\n\r\ncounselling  and mediation will become critical.   An  ageing\r\n\r\npopulation  will  also  create new demands  that  the  people\r\n\r\nsector   will  be  well  placed  to  meet.   These   enhanced\r\n\r\ncapabilities and capacities will require additional attention\r\n\r\nand resource support to develop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move now to my final point, which is to increase\r\n\r\nthe  development  and  support of  individual  self-help  and\r\n\r\ninitiative.   This I see as a key success factor  in  a  more\r\n\r\nturbulent  operating environment.  Central direction  is  too\r\n\r\nslow and inadequate in many instances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All said and done, the individual is the one who\r\n\r\nultimately faces the consequences.  As someone once remarked,\r\n\r\n\"The  unemployment  rate may be 5%,  but  to  any  unemployed\r\n\r\nworker, the unemployment rate is 100%.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals who insist on not responding to the changed\r\n\r\nreality  have  made themselves unemployable.  But  those  who\r\n\r\nunderstand the situation and want to keep themselves relevant\r\n\r\nand  employable should be helped.  Here, I return to my  call\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government to move on supplementing  employer-based\r\n\r\ntraining with more support for individual-initiated training.\r\n\r\nConditions  can  be set and safeguards made  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\ntraining  is  not frivolous or wasteful.  Countries  such  as\r\n\r\nSweden and even England are ahead of us in this.  Let us move\r\n\r\nquickly on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the challenges before us are big and serious. Our\r\n\r\nonly  hope lies in strengthening our unity, organisation  and\r\n\r\ncapabilities.   This  Budget  is  strong  on  prevention  and\r\n\r\npreparation, to give Singaporeans hope for a better future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank you for allowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the quintessence of Finance Minister Lee Hsien\r\n\r\nLoong's Budget Statement is encapsulated in the title for his\r\n\r\nspeech  \"A Budget For A Different World\".  Indeed, while  the\r\n\r\nphysical  landscape of the world remains largely intact,  the\r\n\r\neconomic landscape has seen fundamental shifts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ancient times, human beings were hunters and\r\n\r\ngatherers.   The economy was totally mobile - existing  where\r\n\r\nthe   hunters   and  gatherers  existed.   The   agricultural\r\n\r\nrevolution created predictability in food supply.  Homes were\r\n\r\nbuilt,  production  and  economies  were  centralised.    The\r\n\r\nindustrial  revolution again changed the  basis  of  economic\r\n\r\nproduction.   Division of labour and mass production  led  to\r\n\r\neconomic  specialisation.  Where is the hunter and  gatherer?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,  in this whole process, our hunters and  gatherers\r\n\r\nhave  become  merchants and tradespeople - their geographical\r\n\r\nspread diminished in favour of clustered industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, however, the IT revolution is again changing the\r\n\r\nrules   of  the  game.   Time  and  distance  do  not   limit\r\n\r\nbusinesses.  Even space tourism is now a reality.  People are\r\n\r\nonce  again extremely mobile, like our `hunter and  gatherer'\r\n\r\nforefathers.   The new age hunters and gatherers  find  their\r\n\r\nfood  in  a borderless world, armed with advanced information\r\n\r\nsystems   and   network  that  can  help  them   find   their\r\n\r\nopportunities  and  make  their kill.   The  world  is  their\r\n\r\noyster.   The rule of the game is the fittest and the fastest\r\n\r\nsurvive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I take this opportunity to applaud the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister's courage in keeping\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  sight  the demands of the global arena in the formulation\r\n\r\nof this year's Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this breed of new hunters and gatherers,\r\n\r\nwe  must  ready our people, our economy, to stay relevant  to\r\n\r\nthe  world.  May I offer three areas which the Budget, or the\r\n\r\nrest of the ERC jigsaw puzzle teams can address:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we must attract the new breed of hunters and\r\n\r\ngatherers  to our land.  Second, we must cultivate  our  own,\r\n\r\nour local hunters and gatherers and, third, we must take care\r\n\r\nof all who is in our land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch on the first point. To attract the new\r\n\r\nbreed  of hunters and gatherers to our land, we must  realise\r\n\r\nthat  when these IT-age hunters and gatherers move, they move\r\n\r\nwith  huge  resources and global network that we can  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom.   They can enhance our global hub status and bring  the\r\n\r\nlatest technology to create jobs, jobs and more jobs for  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget has addressed these challenges by firming a\r\n\r\nfundamental  shift in the national tax regime, from  narrowly\r\n\r\nfocused  direct tax structure to a broad-based  indirect  tax\r\n\r\nstructure.   The controversial GST hike from 3%  to  5%,  the\r\n\r\nwelcome cuts in corporate tax from 24% to 20% and the reduced\r\n\r\npersonal  income tax from 26% to 20% in 3 years are necessary\r\n\r\nsteps to position Singapore as a viable business location for\r\n\r\nboth  local and global players.  The Not Ordinarily  Resident\r\n\r\n(NOR)  taxpayer  scheme  attracts  talents,  while  the   tax\r\n\r\nincentives  for  the  global fund managers  attract  capital.\r\n\r\nWith all these, combined with our FTA efforts that fasten our\r\n\r\nlinks  to  the  world, Singapore is in a better  position  to\r\n\r\nattract talents that will reside here and create new business\r\n\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I feel we need to further identify the type of\r\n\r\nhunters  and  gatherers  we  want  to  attract.   The  Budget\r\n\r\nsignalled   a   shift   in  emphasis  to   develop   high-end\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  alongside high value added services,  such  as\r\n\r\nfinance,  logistics,  healthcare and  education.   Given  the\r\n\r\nlimited  land and high labour cost, we must indeed  focus  on\r\n\r\nbranding ourselves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  develop  industries at the top  of  the  economic  value\r\n\r\nchain.   While  diversification  is  sound,  we  must   avoid\r\n\r\ndiluting our potentials to become mediocre players.  Just  as\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  brand is synonymous with  \"quality\",  we  may\r\n\r\nconsider further positioning ourselves to be synonymous  with\r\n\r\nour  niche industries.  This will position us as the de facto\r\n\r\nheadquarters for our desired hunters.  These niche industries\r\n\r\nshould  then  be developed as our new engines of growth  that\r\n\r\nlead  economic activities further down the value chain.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  when we think of consumer electronics, Japan  comes\r\n\r\nto  mind.  When we think of IT, Silicon Valley appears.  When\r\n\r\nwe  think  of  textile,  it is India and  when  we  think  of\r\n\r\nfashion,  it is Paris.  So my question is:  when we think  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, what comes to mind?  Perhaps it is SIA or Creative\r\n\r\nTechnology.   Whatever the case may be, we need  a  face  and\r\n\r\npersonality to attract these global hunters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, cultivate hunters and gatherers from our land.\r\n\r\nIn  times  of severe crisis, I believe that chances  are  the\r\n\r\nhome-grown  industries  will have  a  stronger  economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial  heartstring  to Singapore.  Therefore,  we  must  not\r\n\r\nrelent  on  our  efforts  to  cultivate  our  own  companies,\r\n\r\nalongside world class MNCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do so, we need to adopt a holistic approach. Very\r\n\r\noften,  it  has  been said that we are very clinical  in  our\r\n\r\napproach  and  we segmentise things, and when these  segments\r\n\r\nare put together, they do not form anything that is viable in\r\n\r\nthe  long-term.   Hence, I would call on  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nconsider  putting  these segments together and  examine  them\r\n\r\nclosely  and  adopt a holistic approach.  Perhaps,  a  broad-based  \"dare  to fail\" or \"never say die\" culture  should  be\r\n\r\ninculcated  all  round,  rather than in  limited  pockets  of\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that via the budget allocated to MITA,\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower,  Ministry of Education,  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nTrade and Industry and Ministry of Community Development  and\r\n\r\nSports, we invest heavily in our human capital. We can create\r\n\r\nmore community-in-partnership\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogrammes beyond the football fields into the fields of arts\r\n\r\nand  culture,  entrepreneurship, sports and adventure.   This\r\n\r\nbroad-based  approach  will help lay the  foundation  for  an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial  culture  and  provide  the   critical   mass\r\n\r\nnecessary to encourage any snowball effect desired.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also applaud the 7.8% increase in MOE's budget and\r\n\r\nhope  that  the  investment in our children's varied  talents\r\n\r\nwill   translate  into  future  leaders  who  are  not   just\r\n\r\nacademically sound, but also able to think out of the box and\r\n\r\nmove  fast in the global hunting arena.  For those  who  have\r\n\r\nleft  school,  the  Finance Minister can  consider  a  higher\r\n\r\npersonal tax relief for education to encourage working adults\r\n\r\nto  upgrade themselves.  The current relief level  of  $2,500\r\n\r\nhas  not  kept pace with the cost of education which,  for  a\r\n\r\npart-time degree programme can cost between $15,000-$20,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there is no gain without pain, an encouraging\r\n\r\nbreeding  ground  for our own hunters should have  favourable\r\n\r\nrisk-reward ratios.  This is especially so in Singapore where\r\n\r\nmany are educated and taught to look at cost-benefit analysis\r\n\r\nbefore venturing beyond their comfort zones.  Currently,  the\r\n\r\nrisks associated with entrepreneurship is perceived to be  at\r\n\r\na  premium vis-a-vis a return on investment.  For example,  a\r\n\r\nyoung entrepreneur who requires a small basic office with two\r\n\r\nclerical  staff  would probably need a  start-up  capital  of\r\n\r\nabout $75,000 to last a year, ie, not counting his own salary\r\n\r\nor living needs.  For the many self-employed road warriors in\r\n\r\nsales-related  work, a shift in car cost  from  ownership  to\r\n\r\nusage has also become an additional cost that eats into their\r\n\r\nreturn on investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cost of doing business, this risk-return\r\n\r\nrelationship, must be addressed, not just for the new  start-ups,  but also for the existing SMEs.  In fact, for  the  new\r\n\r\nstart-ups,  due  to  the limited finance  schemes  available,\r\n\r\nyoung  start-ups often have to beg and borrow from the 3Fs  - father, friends and some say in jest, the `fools'.   Each  of\r\n\r\nthem  then becomes a minor shareholder who may decide to  get\r\n\r\ninterested and exercise their rights when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  business  grows, thereby distracting  the  entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nfrom  the  main thrusts of his business.  When  the  business\r\n\r\nfails, the entrepreneur is greatly discouraged and he becomes\r\n\r\nthe  laughing  stock of the community that he  lives  in  and\r\n\r\nborrowed from.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is made worse with the local bank mergers. Even\r\n\r\nbanking  and  finance costs have increased for  the  new  and\r\n\r\nsmaller enterprises, as banks prefer to deal with the 'bigger\r\n\r\nfish'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these, to sum up, are entry barriers. Perhaps, the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister can look into the above areas of concern and\r\n\r\nconsider  measures to create a conducive breeding ground  for\r\n\r\nlocal hunters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of SMEs, many SMEs that I spoke with were\r\n\r\nunexcited  about the Budget.  Some lamented  about  the  high\r\n\r\ncost  of  doing business in Singapore and some  were  worried\r\n\r\nabout the hollowing out of some industries to countries  with\r\n\r\nlower  cost.  Many are unhappy about the crowding-out  effect\r\n\r\nof  GLCs.   All  these were not directly  addressed  in  this\r\n\r\nBudget.  May I suggest that resources be allocated to build a\r\n\r\ndatabase  of  business opportunities, procedures and  network\r\n\r\nprogrammes,   so   that  there  is  more   transparency   and\r\n\r\naccessibility  to information?  Perhaps GLCs  and  successful\r\n\r\nenterprises  may also act as mentors for the new  or  smaller\r\n\r\nkids on the block.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the Budget made provisions for start-up stock\r\n\r\noptions, specific incentives for SMEs would make our economic\r\n\r\nstimulation  initiatives even more powerful.  In  particular,\r\n\r\neasier  access  to capital for SMEs and other entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nfinancing  instruments  could  be  developed.   Perhaps,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could consider setting up SME banks that  operate\r\n\r\non  slightly different objectives from that of the three  big\r\n\r\nbanks, with the focus on helping and investing in SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In both the inward and outward economic expansion\r\n\r\nstrategies of Singapore, the EDB has been instrumental,  over\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears,  in  bringing the top names to Singapore.  The  newly-formed International Enterprise Singapore (IES) will need  to\r\n\r\nexpand  their every effort to globalise our enterprises.   To\r\n\r\nthis  end, we need to unlock the potentials of SMEs and  grow\r\n\r\nthem  into corporate giants of tomorrow.  We should  identify\r\n\r\nas  many SMEs as are deserving, so as to form a critical mass\r\n\r\nwith  real  impact.    Thus, the Budget should  increase  the\r\n\r\nresources  for  these Boards in lean times, rather  than  cut\r\n\r\nthem.  A penny saved on this may cost us many dollars in lost\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, take care of all in our land. If the Pareto's\r\n\r\nprinciple  of 80/20 is true, then whilst the Budget addresses\r\n\r\nthe  needs of the top 20%, which are our desired hunters  and\r\n\r\ngatherers, who may create jobs and wealth for the  nation  at\r\n\r\nlarge;  the  Budget must make provision for  the  less  well-endowed and the less able.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, Budget 2002 has sagaciously granted double\r\n\r\ntax  deductions to charitable and welfare organisations  with\r\n\r\nIPC  status.  This means that for every one dollar given, the\r\n\r\nGovernment contributes 44 cents.  In addition, donations from\r\n\r\nestates,  are now exempt from estate duty.  This is certainly\r\n\r\na step in the right direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher personal income tax relief for NSmen, their\r\n\r\nwives  and  parents,  new  tax  reliefs  for  families   with\r\n\r\nhandicapped  parents and continued child-bearing rebates  for\r\n\r\ndivorcees,  are  also  much  welcomed  measures.   All  these\r\n\r\ndemonstrate the budget planner's determination in promoting a\r\n\r\ncohesive society based on the virtue of care and share.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, perhaps more funds can be allocated to help the\r\n\r\nlower-income and senior citizens who have toiled to bring  us\r\n\r\nthe  fruits  of their labour.  Many of them are the  founding\r\n\r\nfathers of Singapore, and many of them have low education and\r\n\r\nlittle funds to live on. Even with retraining, many would not\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  keep up with the pace of change and the  rising\r\n\r\ncost  of  living.  Hence, I hope that the heartening increase\r\n\r\nin  the  social  development budget to 44.5% would  translate\r\n\r\ninto greater benefits for the less-able and senior\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizens,  to help them take care of their basic  needs  like\r\n\r\nfood, medical, transport, among other needs.  Most of all, it\r\n\r\nmust  help  them to integrate into the mainstream.   To  this\r\n\r\nend,  perhaps  I could suggest that the GROs  be  given  more\r\n\r\noperating grants so that volunteers can focus on serving  and\r\n\r\nintegrating residents and the community, rather than limiting\r\n\r\ntheir ideas and imaginations to the funds they can raise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RC centres, for example, given the necessary manpower,\r\n\r\ncan  be opened every night and utilised as residents' kampong\r\n\r\ncorners.   These  centres can certainly act  as  social  glue\r\n\r\nstations  for all, regardless of race, language or  religion.\r\n\r\nIn  the  face of rising ethnic and religious intolerance,  as\r\n\r\nwitnessed in the Middle East and, more recently, the rise  of\r\n\r\nMr  Jean-Marie Le Pen in France and the shooting  of  Mr  Pim\r\n\r\nFortuyn  in Holland, I urge the Government to reconsider  its\r\n\r\nfunding operatives for GROs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, after the two economic crises in 1998 and\r\n\r\n2001, the GST hike and the sweeteners, what remains unchanged\r\n\r\nis  an  economy that needs to constantly redefine itself,  in\r\n\r\norder to stay relevant to the world.  This is the only way to\r\n\r\nensure  that its people can continue to enjoy growth and  the\r\n\r\ncomforts   of   secure   jobs.    Commensurate   with   this,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  must be willing to take on the  challenges  and\r\n\r\naccept rapid changes in their working lives.  This means  not\r\n\r\njust a political will but a collective will of the 3Ps, as Mr\r\n\r\nHeng  Chee  How has mentioned -  the people, the private  and\r\n\r\nthe  public sectors.  The Government's role will then  be  to\r\n\r\npersuade  and  enable  the people, enhance  and  empower  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector,  and  style itself as a  shrewd  steward  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's economic growth in the global arena.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

While  the\r\n\r\nPharaohs  were  interested  in  building  edifices,  we   are\r\n\r\nbuilding  a  cohesive  and  strong  nation  in  which   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  has  a stake, and I think the  Budget  addresses\r\n\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not a businessman, but I acknowledge the need\r\n\r\nto see their major concerns.  I see the strong and clear need\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  focus on the future of our people in a  balanced\r\n\r\nway.  Sir, I think this Budget is fair and a balanced one. Of\r\n\r\ncourse, employers would expect more concessions.  But by  the\r\n\r\nsame  token, employees expect more give-aways.  So, too,  are\r\n\r\nretirees  and  others who are now not in the workforce.   But\r\n\r\nthe  business  of  government in raising revenue  is  not  to\r\n\r\npunish  its people, but in order that we have more  resources\r\n\r\nto do more things for the common good of society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of greater concern to me is whether the Government will\r\n\r\ndo  more  in the area of skills training.  All too often,  we\r\n\r\nhear  of people who find it difficult to get alternative jobs\r\n\r\nafter  they  are retrenched.  When I was in the NTUC,  I  was\r\n\r\ndeeply involved in the business of job matching.  Believe me,\r\n\r\nit  is  an unenviable task!  Yet, it has to be done, and  the\r\n\r\nNTUC is now expanding much resources to improve job matching.\r\n\r\nThere is even a centre in Trade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnion House, now located at Bras Basah Road, dedicated to job\r\n\r\nmatching.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that if the Government releases more money\r\n\r\nfor  training, more can be done to run even more courses, not\r\n\r\nonly to equip retrenched workers for new jobs, but to upgrade\r\n\r\nthe  skills  of those still at work, so that they can  better\r\n\r\npreserve  their  jobs.   The figures given  by  the  Manpower\r\n\r\nMinister  earlier indicate that retrenched workers  above  40\r\n\r\nyears  old face more difficulties in securing jobs.   To  me,\r\n\r\nthe  most important task is to change the mindsets of workers\r\n\r\nas  well  as employers.  We need to also address the concerns\r\n\r\nof retrenched workers who turn down job offers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of training should be offered? Experience\r\n\r\ntells me that workers are better prepared psychologically  if\r\n\r\nthey  are given training when they know it will benefit them.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, if a worker is told that at the end  of  the\r\n\r\ncourse he will have a job, he will be even more motivated.  I\r\n\r\nam  therefore calling on the Government to spare  no  efforts\r\n\r\nand  resources in having a closer link between  job  training\r\n\r\nand  job placement.  We should even consider farming out such\r\n\r\ntraining-for-job   placement  schemes   to   private   sector\r\n\r\ncompanies which can do the job more efficiently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the media has a big role to play in helping\r\n\r\nto  encourage  workers to switch from one  kind  of  work  to\r\n\r\nanother.  Yes, there have been some examples  -  in the print\r\n\r\nmedia, on radio and over television. But more can be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various constituencies have their own newsletters. They\r\n\r\nare  an  excellent avenue to let residents  know  of  success\r\n\r\ncases.  These are people in their own neighbourhood who  have\r\n\r\nbenefited from breaking with the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with another area of training. This is\r\n\r\nthe  preparation  of  young  Singaporeans  yet  to  join  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.  In particular, I would like to talk about\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose  who take the ITE path.  I would like to put particular\r\n\r\nstress  on  this because, as we are tackling the  problem  of\r\n\r\nemployability  of older workers, we do not want  to  see  the\r\n\r\nyounger generation face the same problems because they do not\r\n\r\nhave a good education foundation.  Parents whose children may\r\n\r\nnot  be academically inclined should consider seriously about\r\n\r\nsending  them  to  ITE.  Here, I would like  to  commend  the\r\n\r\nGovernment for continuing to give substantial allocations for\r\n\r\neducation,  from  which our ITE campuses  and  students  have\r\n\r\nbenefited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some parents and Singaporeans in general appear to think\r\n\r\nthat  ITE  is  an  inferior institution, and  that  if  their\r\n\r\nchildren end up in ITE, then their job prospects will be less\r\n\r\npromising.   No, this cannot be true.  Statistics  show  that\r\n\r\n88%  of  ITE  graduates  get  jobs  within  three  months  of\r\n\r\nfinishing  their  courses.  According to the  recent  release\r\n\r\nfrom  ITE,  the  average  salary is about  $1,222  for  fresh\r\n\r\ngraduates and $1,423 for post-NS graduates.  This is not  bad\r\n\r\nfor people on their first job.  The salary is just $300 short\r\n\r\nof  the  starting  pay  of people with diplomas.   These  are\r\n\r\nstrong  indicators which reaffirm the employability  and  the\r\n\r\nvalue of ITE graduates, even during economic downturns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ITE has, over the years, made a conscious effort to\r\n\r\ndevelop  in students skills that are needed in the  industry.\r\n\r\nSo  parents as well as young Singaporeans should look at  ITE\r\n\r\nin better light.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, ITE increases the employability of young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  It gives them the foundation to upgrade  their\r\n\r\nskills.   Some ITE graduates have gone on to the  polytechnic\r\n\r\nto further enhance their employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also considerable debate over the need to\r\n\r\nraise GST from 3% to 5%.  Of course, if we look at it from  a\r\n\r\nmathematical perspective, it is almost a 100% jump.   But  is\r\n\r\nthis so?  Of course, not.  Nevertheless, we have to intensify\r\n\r\npublic  education so that our people are not unduly  worried.\r\n\r\nOne good example of how the GST works can be found in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlatest issue of NTUC News.  I recommend that Members look  at\r\n\r\nthe  latest  issue of NTUC News in our attempt to explain  to\r\n\r\nour residents and the public about how GST works and how they\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  unduly worried about  the  increase  in  two\r\n\r\npercentage points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have to be on guard against possible\r\n\r\nprofiteering.  Those who try to take advantage from  the  GST\r\n\r\nincrease  by  hiking  their  prices  unjustly  will  only  be\r\n\r\ndamaging   their   businesses.   The  Committee   to   Combat\r\n\r\nProfiteering, chaired by Mr Chan Soo Sen, should expose  such\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When GST was first introduced, NTUC cooperatives were\r\n\r\namong  the first to declare that they would absorb GST for  a\r\n\r\nperiod.  Other trades followed suit.  NTUC cooperatives  also\r\n\r\ndecided not to round up prices.  Again, this was emulated  by\r\n\r\nother traders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time round, NTUC cooperatives have again been the\r\n\r\nfirst off the mark, to say that they will absorb the extra 2%\r\n\r\nthat  is  to be levied.  And, as in the first exercise,  this\r\n\r\nwill  be  for  a  period  of time.   This  is  a  commendable\r\n\r\ninitiative by NTUC cooperatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an impression in some circles that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  been  over generous towards  those  who  are\r\n\r\nbetter off.  Now, they pay less in taxes  -  both company tax\r\n\r\nand  income  tax.  This will lead to widening of  the  income\r\n\r\ngap.   But  has the Government done this to deliberately  fix\r\n\r\nthe  lower  income?   We  all know the  answer  is  No!   The\r\n\r\nGovernment has adjusted taxes to make Singapore an even  more\r\n\r\nattractive  place for people to do business,  and  to  create\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in general, I find the Budget generous and fair.\r\n\r\nIt  may  appear  to be pro-business, but it is actually  pro-people  because  it  attempts to create  more  jobs  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njoin in this debate.  I support the efforts by the Government\r\n\r\nto remake Singapore for a changed world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, driven by technology and globalisation,\r\n\r\nthe  world has been changing.  The pace, initially slow,  has\r\n\r\nspeeded  up  in recent years.  It was just a matter  of  time\r\n\r\nwhen  the  cumulative effects became visible.   September  11\r\n\r\nprecipitated  its  unveiling.   Everyone  was  thus  abruptly\r\n\r\nawoken  to  a  changed  world.   However,  if  one  has  been\r\n\r\ndiscerning with the works of the Government over time via the\r\n\r\nchanges   made  to  policies,  systems,  values,   processes,\r\n\r\ninstitutions, infrastructure, he would have noticed that  our\r\n\r\nleaders have always realised the changing landscape.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of September 11 thus demanded a sudden step\r\n\r\nchange,  ie, a major response.  The luxurious gradual  change\r\n\r\nof  yesteryears was no longer enough.  The tax  changes  just\r\n\r\nannounced  emanated from the recommendations by the  Economic\r\n\r\nReview  Committee's  sub-committee  on  policies  related  to\r\n\r\ntaxation,  the CPF system, wages and land, headed  by  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of State, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, and  reflected\r\n\r\nthe gravity of the situation.  These are significant changes.\r\n\r\nI  know.  I have sat over five budget sessions in this august\r\n\r\nChamber  in  the past years.  To get Minister Richard  Hu  to\r\n\r\nagree  to a tax change was a major battle, very few of  which\r\n\r\nwere  ever won.  But in the Budget just announced, the  shift\r\n\r\nwas  tectonic.  The changes could only have been  dreamt  of.\r\n\r\nThe  degree  and  extent  of  change  clearly  reflected  the\r\n\r\nseriousness  with  which the Government  viewed  the  changed\r\n\r\nworld  and  our  need to respond.  These are  brave  changes,\r\n\r\nwhich  though  taken with calculated risks, are fraught  with\r\n\r\ngreat  uncertainties, but change we must if we want  to  give\r\n\r\nour  children and grandchildren as good a future in Singapore\r\n\r\nas  we  had  of our lives and opportunities.  My more  senior\r\n\r\ncolleagues with more years in this Chamber may feel even more\r\n\r\nstrongly of these changes than I.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the tectonic shift, some may ask, is it\r\n\r\nenough?  Hong Kong has a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncorporate tax of just 16%.  Ireland has reduced its corporate\r\n\r\ntax  even lower to 12 1/2% taking effect next year.  I  would\r\n\r\nsay  that it is enough for now.  By raising our GST  rate  by\r\n\r\n2%,  from  3% to 5%, it has already aroused so much  distress\r\n\r\nand  discomfort in our people.  A reduction of both corporate\r\n\r\nand  individual  tax rates to below 20% would necessitate  an\r\n\r\neven  higher GST rate.  In any case, tax, though an important\r\n\r\nfactor,  is  not  the  only factor in  the  decision  whether\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  a  good place to do business.   We  require  a\r\n\r\nholistic response to the new circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, very few worthy changes are easy or painless to\r\n\r\nachieve.   More  often  than not, sacrifices  are  needed  to\r\n\r\nachieve  the  desired goals.  The changes in the  tax  regime\r\n\r\nwill  shift  and  redistribute responsibilities.   Some  will\r\n\r\ncontribute more, others less.  This is inevitable,  but  this\r\n\r\nis  not  the  purpose  of the change.  These  are  unintended\r\n\r\neffects.  It is vital to constantly bear in mind the  primary\r\n\r\npurpose  of making the change.  But it does not mean that  we\r\n\r\nshould  merely accept the pain and not do anything to  soften\r\n\r\nthe adverse consequences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GST affects every Singaporean. This means that\r\n\r\nincreasing the GST rate, all Singaporeans will pay more  GST.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  pay income tax and thus benefit  from  the\r\n\r\ndecrease  in  income tax will be better off  in  the  changed\r\n\r\nregime, but those who do not pay income tax and thus  do  not\r\n\r\nbenefit from the decrease in income tax will be worse off  in\r\n\r\nthe changed tax regime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GST offset package of economic restructuring shares\r\n\r\nand  rebates is thus very reassuring to the people.   I  have\r\n\r\nspoken to several of my residents and they are reassured.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for all of us to realise that by making\r\n\r\nchanges,  we  can grow the pie.  The intended result  is  not\r\n\r\nthat  of  a  zero sum game where one gains at the expense  of\r\n\r\nanother, but that of a win-win\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsituation where every Singaporean benefits.  Let us say  that\r\n\r\nif  we  have $100 to spend with the GST rate of 3%,  we  have\r\n\r\neffectively  $97 to spend.  If we do nothing and become  less\r\n\r\ncompetitive,  we  may end up with just $50, and  taking  into\r\n\r\naccount  3% GST, it means that we have effectively $48.50  to\r\n\r\nspend.   But with the change and the economy grows, we  could\r\n\r\nhave  $150,  and taking into account 5% GST,  it  will  still\r\n\r\nleave  us with effectively $142.50 to spend.  So compare  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  $48.50 without change to a value of  $142.50  with\r\n\r\nchange,  the  brief  pains of change are  clearly  worth  the\r\n\r\nwhile.  Some may disagree with my choice of numbers, but this\r\n\r\nillustration makes clear the intended dynamics of the change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, let me join my colleague, Mr Leong Horn\r\n\r\nKee,  to  plead with the Government for the public assistance\r\n\r\nrecipients and pensioners.  The Minister has said  that  both\r\n\r\nthe  amounts of public assistance and Singapore Allowance are\r\n\r\nunder  review.  This  is  good.  I  have  spoken  to  several\r\n\r\npensioners  who  ask  for more sympathetic  understanding  of\r\n\r\ntheir  situation.  Their pensions are tied to their salaries.\r\n\r\nThe  current  salary has galloped way out of sight,  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Allowance which is to adjust for this hardly  keeps\r\n\r\npace.   They  had  contributed to the growth  of  the  nation\r\n\r\nduring their productive years and now depend on the State for\r\n\r\nthe  remaining years of their lives.  Like them,  the  public\r\n\r\nassistance recipients, less able to help themselves, are also\r\n\r\ndependent  on the State for help to live.  On this  basis,  I\r\n\r\nhope  that the Government, in the current consideration, will\r\n\r\nbe more generous in its assistance to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately after Senior Minister of State, Mr Tharman,\r\n\r\nannounced  the recommendations of his Committee,  changes  to\r\n\r\nincome, corporate and goods and services tax rates caught the\r\n\r\nattention  of the public.  Many saw the changes as benefiting\r\n\r\nthe rich and taxing the poor.  After the Budget was announced\r\n\r\nand  the  package of GST offset was made known,  the  fervour\r\n\r\nquietened.   The  purpose  of  the  GST  offset  package  was\r\n\r\nachieved.  It was thus evident that to many, the changes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquickly boiled down to who gained and who lost.  Every  group\r\n\r\nsaw  the  specific impact upon itself.  The raison d'etre  of\r\n\r\nthe  effort was missed.  Should this be the case, the purpose\r\n\r\nof  the  change  would be defeated.  We cannot merely  assume\r\n\r\nthat the people will understand, or that they will eventually\r\n\r\nunderstand.   The  changes, with many more on  the  way,  are\r\n\r\nintended to remake Singapore for a changed world.  The  world\r\n\r\nwill  not wait for us to be ready.  The world will just  move\r\n\r\non.   Hence, the quicker we get the people to understand  the\r\n\r\nseriousness of the situation, the better prepared will we  be\r\n\r\nto  face and surmount the challenges, and the faster  we  can\r\n\r\nrespond  to  the changing environment.  We need  to  get  our\r\n\r\npeople  to  understand and focus on the big picture,  on  the\r\n\r\nlong-term  benefits  to  all,  than  merely  harping  on  the\r\n\r\nimmediate gains and losses to individuals and groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot just assume that a few announcements by\r\n\r\nMinisters  and  the  discussion in this august  Chamber  will\r\n\r\ninform  the people of the purpose and the seriousness of  the\r\n\r\nchange.  Like Mr Heng Chee How, I believe we need to sell the\r\n\r\nneeded change to the people.  We must engage our people.   To\r\n\r\nsucceed, we must try to get everyone to come on board  -  the\r\n\r\nquicker,   the  better.   To  succeed  in  the  remaking   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we need the population to understand and  support\r\n\r\nthe  changes  that are needed.  We need a deliberate  focused\r\n\r\neffort to do this.  But let me also quickly add that we  must\r\n\r\nlet our people know that we are not making these changes from\r\n\r\na  position  of desperation or panic, but one of proactivity.\r\n\r\nBy  moving before others do, we get a headstart in the  race.\r\n\r\nWe  must not be complacent like the proverbial hare.  But  it\r\n\r\nbears  repeating that we do not oversell the  change  to  the\r\n\r\nextent  that  we  appear desperate, as this  will  cause  the\r\n\r\npeople to lose confidence, when we are really taking off from\r\n\r\na  position of strength, of confidence and in command of  our\r\n\r\npace of change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am repeating myself here in elaborating the rationale\r\n\r\nfor  change.  There is a tendency to view the change  in  tax\r\n\r\nrates as a key point of change.  It is not.  It bodes us well\r\n\r\nto remember that a zero\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npercentage  of  nothing  is  still  nothing.   Whereas   some\r\n\r\npercentage  of  something is real, no matter how  small  that\r\n\r\nsomething is.  For if there is no work, there is no  pay,  so\r\n\r\nwhat, if the tax is zero?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that our people will rally round if they\r\n\r\nare  aware  of this.  The changes are efforts to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthere  will be good, well-paying jobs for us and our children\r\n\r\nnow  and  in the future.  I am sure that we will happily  pay\r\n\r\nour taxes for there is something to pay from.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will more changes be necessary? Unfortunately, the\r\n\r\nanswer  is  yes.  Besides the increase in pace,  change  will\r\n\r\nalso  be relentless.  The number of players in the field  has\r\n\r\nincreased  and  they  have  also become  more  sophisticated.\r\n\r\nCompetition in the future will be like treading on a conveyor\r\n\r\nbelt, constantly on the move.  We have to keep on moving just\r\n\r\nto  keep up.  Hence, we have to be constantly on our  toes  - changing  and,  at  the  same time, proactively  anticipating\r\n\r\nchanges to keep ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides rapid changes, the cycle of change will be\r\n\r\nshort.   Booms  will follow busts, in quick succession.   The\r\n\r\npace  of  technological advances will force us to  learn  and\r\n\r\nrelearn  our knowledge and skills to remain relevant, quickly\r\n\r\ndiscarding  those  no longer useful and replacing  them  with\r\n\r\nnewer  useful  ones.   Furthermore,  the  downturn  will   be\r\n\r\nsectoral.    In  other  words,  simultaneously,  while   some\r\n\r\neconomic  sectors boom, others may be in recess.  It  appears\r\n\r\nthat  this  will  be the typical economic  landscape  of  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cope with such a dynamic and parlous future requires\r\n\r\na  sea  change in our mental attitude, in how we should  plan\r\n\r\nand do for the future.  Our thinking of what we need to do to\r\n\r\nsurvive must change.  Because of the last 40 years of  nearly\r\n\r\ncontinuous   prosperity,  we  are  not  well   prepared   for\r\n\r\nadversities.   Over committed in assets and low  in  savings,\r\n\r\ntwo economic downturns in quick succession, resulting in high\r\n\r\nretrenchment  and  exhaustion of savings,  led  to  financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties for many.  Here, we can learn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the proverbial ant who starts to prepare for winter,  as\r\n\r\nsoon  as  spring begins, through autumn, knowing that  winter\r\n\r\nwill  come and life will be tough.  Unlike the happy-go-lucky\r\n\r\ngrasshopper,  the  ant tempers his enjoyment  during  spring,\r\n\r\nsummer  and  autumn, keeping something aside and accumulating\r\n\r\nits  larder for the winter.  Singaporeans must do  the  same.\r\n\r\nWe  have till now saved for just one winter in our life - our\r\n\r\nold age.  Some do not even do that.  We must now begin to set\r\n\r\naside  a part of what we earn to build a larder for the  next\r\n\r\ndownturn,  so  that  we  will have the resources  to  weather\r\n\r\nthrough  it while waiting for the upturn.  It is better  that\r\n\r\nwe  prepare for such a future than to look forward to others,\r\n\r\nlike  the  Government,  each time for help  when  a  downturn\r\n\r\noccurs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we first began as a nation, our leaders, with\r\n\r\nless  resources  and  experience and under  equally  daunting\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  overcame the odds to develop the  country  to\r\n\r\nwhat  it  is  today.    They  succeeded  because  the  people\r\n\r\nunderstood  the  situation  and  what  needed  to  be   done,\r\n\r\nsupported  the Government and worked together to achieve  our\r\n\r\ncommon  goals.  Today, we come yet again to another watershed\r\n\r\nin  the  life  of  our  nation, but now  equipped  with  more\r\n\r\nresources  and  experience.   The  unknown  is  the  support,\r\n\r\ncommitment  and resolve of our people.  Like our parents,  if\r\n\r\nwe  understand our situation, share a common vision, and  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to support the Government and work hard and  smart,\r\n\r\nwe will succeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not fear competition. As much as we desire to\r\n\r\ngrow,  so  also  do others.  Economies grow as societies  and\r\n\r\nnations  prosper.   With  the growing  pie,  competition  can\r\n\r\nresult  in  a  win-win  situation.  Under  fair  competition,\r\n\r\neveryone  improves and the pie grows in size.   We  must  not\r\n\r\nparticularly  fear  our neighbours, for competition  can  and\r\n\r\nwill   also   come  from  afar,  especially  with  increasing\r\n\r\nglobalisation  as an irreversible trend.  But this  does  not\r\n\r\nmean we simply give up our share.  We will fight to keep what\r\n\r\nis ours,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  our  competitors will have to convince the  buyers  that\r\n\r\nthey can do better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am convinced that my fellow countrymen share with me\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  the  means and the resolve  to  overcome  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  that  we face.  We can have our place  under  the\r\n\r\nsun.  We will, if we work together as a people, thinking  not\r\n\r\njust  for  ourselves but also our relatives and friends,  all\r\n\r\nour  fellow  Singaporeans and, importantly, our children  and\r\n\r\ntheir children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the People's Action Party and its leaders have\r\n\r\nremained  true to its ideal to serve the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nto  the  best  of  its ability.  As long  as  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  keep faith with the PAP, we will work our  fingers\r\n\r\nto  the bone for them.  With the support of all Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nwe will overcome our challenges and our nation shall prosper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion moved by the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, over the last one\r\n\r\nweek, I have been asked many times how I would describe  this\r\n\r\nBudget.  Many also asked whether the tax measures would  help\r\n\r\nto  create jobs as promised, or is this just a Budget to take\r\n\r\ncare of the rich in our society.  These may sound like simple\r\n\r\nquestions,  Sir, but there are serious issues which  underpin\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget reinforces the shift that has taken place\r\n\r\nover  the  last few years in our tax and regulatory  systems.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not something new, as many other countries  are  also\r\n\r\ndoing the same.  Among the OECD countries, for instance, most\r\n\r\nhave  been reducing their corporate tax rate since 1990.   In\r\n\r\nfact,   concerned   by  the  revenue  consequences   of   tax\r\n\r\ncompetition,  the OECD has even established a task  force  to\r\n\r\nlook  into the matter, as it recognises that capital mobility\r\n\r\nopens  up  the risk of competitive bidding between  countries\r\n\r\nfor mobile business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the key words here are capital mobility. Companies\r\n\r\ncan vote with their feet and will relocate to countries where\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  can  reap the most returns.  It is a serious  challenge\r\n\r\nfor  states  limited by geographical and manpower constraints\r\n\r\nto  draw and retain capital within their boundaries.   To  do\r\n\r\nso,  they  have  to  create  attractive  tax  and  regulatory\r\n\r\nsystems.   We  know  that  capital  mobility  is  due  to   a\r\n\r\nconvergence   of   factors,   such   as   globalisation   and\r\n\r\nderegulation   of  trade  and  investment  and  technological\r\n\r\nadvancement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, having an attractive tax and regulatory system\r\n\r\nalone  is insufficient to sustain our long-term progress  and\r\n\r\nprosperity.   We  can have an attractive tax system,  but  we\r\n\r\nwill  still not be able to attract and retain investments  if\r\n\r\nthere  is no support for such initiatives, because people  do\r\n\r\nnot  understand nor appreciate how these measures can improve\r\n\r\ntheir  well-being.  We have seen how globalisation  has  come\r\n\r\nunder  attack  world-wide.  Abating somewhat only  after  the\r\n\r\nSeptember  11 incident, the debate on globalisation  has  not\r\n\r\nended.  In many countries, people feel that globalisation and\r\n\r\nfree trade have not benefited them.  The fiasco in Seattle is\r\n\r\na  case  in  point and it is not likely that such  objections\r\n\r\nwill  disappear  if  the  key  issues  of  inequity  are  not\r\n\r\naddressed.   The real problem though is not globalisation  or\r\n\r\nfree trade.  Rather it is the failure of many governments  to\r\n\r\ninvest  in  their people and have an effective social  safety\r\n\r\nnet.    Without  heavy  investments  in  human  capital   and\r\n\r\nprogrammes to help those who are displaced to cope  with  the\r\n\r\ntransitional  adjustment  problems,  there  will  be   strong\r\n\r\nreactions  to  change  and the chorus of  protest  will  grow\r\n\r\nlouder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we, in Singapore, are no strangers to change. Over\r\n\r\nthe  last few years, the pace of change has in fact quickened\r\n\r\nconsiderably.   Many  of  us have  had  to  revisit  our  old\r\n\r\nassumptions   and  beliefs.   Job  security   and   life-long\r\n\r\nemployment  no  longer  carry the  same  meaning  as  before.\r\n\r\nToday,  nobody can reasonably expect to retire from the  very\r\n\r\nfirst  job  that  he  or she was employed  in  after  school.\r\n\r\nIndividuals  now  have  to  take  on  the  responsibility  of\r\n\r\nmanaging   their   own   careers  and  ensuring   their   own\r\n\r\nemployability.  Many companies today do not wait to  retrench\r\n\r\nuntil they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  in the throes of death, but regularly review their  cost\r\n\r\nstructure  in  order  to  stay competitive.   In  many  ways,\r\n\r\nindividuals  now  carry  more of the risk  of  labour  market\r\n\r\ndownturn  and  a company's poor performance compared  to  the\r\n\r\npast.  Workers can no longer afford to remain indifferent  to\r\n\r\nissues  of cost and returns to shareholders, as these have  a\r\n\r\ndirect link to their job security and wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, Sir, we question whether there is any meaning to\r\n\r\nthe  word  \"loyalty\" at all.  What is the meaning of  loyalty\r\n\r\nwhen  you  cannot even be assured of a job?  As the  business\r\n\r\nenvironment becomes more competitive and companies come under\r\n\r\npressure  to  reduce  cost,  the social  compact  with  their\r\n\r\nworkers  can weaken.  Not so long ago, I remember  we  had  a\r\n\r\ndifferent discussion about loyalty.  The debate then was  how\r\n\r\nto penalise job hoppers by forfeiting their CPF contributions\r\n\r\nif they leave a company after only a short period of service.\r\n\r\nToday,  we have to deal with issues of outsourcing,  contract\r\n\r\nwork and part-time work, all of which are on the increase and\r\n\r\nare temporary in nature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that we are having this discussion shows how\r\n\r\ndramatic  the  changes have been.  We are no  longer  talking\r\n\r\nabout  how to retain people but instead our focus is  now  on\r\n\r\nhow to educate and train people to manage frequent changes in\r\n\r\njobs and careers.  We know that change is inevitable.  But we\r\n\r\nalso  know  that  the impact of such changes on  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  be  managed, so that those who  are  affected\r\n\r\nduring  the transition will not bear the cost of such changes\r\n\r\ndisproportionately.   In a free market and  an  open  economy\r\n\r\nlike  Singapore, the Government has a very important role  to\r\n\r\nplay.   Openness  is clearly good for growth and  employment.\r\n\r\nBut  for such openness to benefit everyone, there must  be  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  policy  on human resource  development  and  a\r\n\r\nsocial floor in the form of effective labour legislation  and\r\n\r\nsocial protection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because labour markets are different from\r\n\r\nmarkets for goods and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservices.  Labour markets are about people, their skills  and\r\n\r\ncompetencies  and  their  aspirations  and  motivations.   An\r\n\r\nemployment  contract cannot be treated as  purely  commercial\r\n\r\ncontracts   due  to  the  unequal  bargaining  strengths   of\r\n\r\nindividuals  as  against companies.   In  Singapore,  we  are\r\n\r\nfortunate  to  have a farsighted Government that  understands\r\n\r\nthese imperatives.  We have a comprehensive social safety net\r\n\r\nin the form of subsidised education, health and housing.  And\r\n\r\nthere  is  heavy  investment in human  resource  development.\r\n\r\nAlthough the social contract with companies has weakened, the\r\n\r\nsocial  compact  between our Government and  the  people  has\r\n\r\nstrengthened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased, Sir, to note that in this year's Budget,\r\n\r\n45%  of  the  expenditure will go to social  development.   I\r\n\r\nagree  entirely  with  the  Minister  for  Finance  that  the\r\n\r\nsubstantially  increased  budget  allocation  for  education,\r\n\r\nhealth  and  community development are necessary  foundations\r\n\r\nfor a strong, cohesive and resilient society.  I believe that\r\n\r\nwithout  such  heavy investment in human and social  capital,\r\n\r\nchanges  will be more bumpy and there will be greater  social\r\n\r\ndisruptions  which,  at the end of the day,  will  impoverish\r\n\r\neveryone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also note that the allocation for the Ministry of\r\n\r\nManpower's  operating expenditure has increased by  22%.   Of\r\n\r\nthis,  the  largest percentage, or 28.4% of the total  budget\r\n\r\nallocation of $220 million allocated to the Ministry, will be\r\n\r\nspent  on life-long education and skills upgrading programme.\r\n\r\nI strongly welcome the Minister for Finance's statement that,\r\n\r\ndespite budgetary constraints, the Government will not  stint\r\n\r\non  its support for workers to upgrade themselves.  We are on\r\n\r\nthe  right track, Sir.  Our priorities are well-placed.   The\r\n\r\nway ahead for us is to make sure that everyone who aspires is\r\n\r\ngiven a chance to be placed on the ladder and, thereafter, he\r\n\r\nor  she decides how fast or how slow he or she wants to climb\r\n\r\nup the ladder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question which I raised at the beginning of my\r\n\r\nintervention, has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanswered.  Yes, the 2% GST increase will be painful.  But the\r\n\r\noffset  package of measures will take care of the  adjustment\r\n\r\nneeds  of low income Singaporeans in the short term.  And  in\r\n\r\nthe   long   term,   the  heavy  investment   in   developing\r\n\r\ncapabilities  through  education  and  skills  training   and\r\n\r\nupgrading will enable all Singaporeans to acquire better jobs\r\n\r\nand  a  better  life.  This Budget is clearly  not  for  high\r\n\r\nincome  Singaporeans only, but will benefit all  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ntoday and in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we move ahead, there will be serious challenges\r\n\r\nfaced  by  all  Singaporeans.  For the Malay  community,  the\r\n\r\nchallenges will be even more serious.  As it is a known  fact\r\n\r\nthat the community lags behind others in education and skills\r\n\r\nupgrading, there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that  there\r\n\r\nare more Malay workers in low-end and unskilled jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many training opportunities available and\r\n\r\nfunds  is  not  an issue.  The Minister in charge  of  Muslim\r\n\r\nAffairs  has also outlined a vision for the Malay  community.\r\n\r\nIn  this  vision of a community of excellence, upgrading  the\r\n\r\nskills  and  employability of Malay workers is a  key  focus.\r\n\r\nFor  this community of excellence vision to take place, there\r\n\r\nmust be a quantum leap in the thinking in the Malay community\r\n\r\nabout  the  importance of learning and skills  upgrading.   I\r\n\r\nmust stress that, over the years, we have seen some progress.\r\n\r\nMany  more  have enrolled in the various training programmes.\r\n\r\nIT  and  computer literacy courses run by NTUC see  a  larger\r\n\r\nnumber  of  Malay  workers attending them.   Higher  educated\r\n\r\nMalays  are now no longer contented only with basic  degrees.\r\n\r\nMany  have gone on to acquire post-graduate degrees and post-diplomas  in  various areas.  Self-help bodies, like  MENDAKI\r\n\r\nand  AMP,  have also rallied around this cause and have  been\r\n\r\nactively  promoting  skills  upgrading  courses.   But   more\r\n\r\nremains to be done, as I fear that, as the economy moves into\r\n\r\nhigher gear, there will be more displaced workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this respect, I call upon the community to focus\r\n\r\non the key points\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmentioned  in the community of excellence vision outlined  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister in charge of Muslim Affairs.  They should avoid\r\n\r\ngetting  side-tracked by specific issues of how to  interpret\r\n\r\nsome  of  the points made in the vision statement.   Instead,\r\n\r\nfocus  on  the core issues, believe that change is necessary,\r\n\r\ngalvanise all our resources and work together with one  heart\r\n\r\nand one mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before ending, I would like to urge the relevant\r\n\r\nMinistries,  statutory  boards and  GLCs  to  exercise  great\r\n\r\nrestraint before increasing the prices of their services.  We\r\n\r\nare  not out of the woods yet.  We still have 100,000  people\r\n\r\nunemployed and, therefore, I think this call for restraint is\r\n\r\nnecessary and pertinent.  The recent increase of HDB car park\r\n\r\ncharges  by $15 to $90, for instance, has created  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nunhappiness,  because  it has also affected  the  small  time\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and the retailers.  The dust on the GST  has  not\r\n\r\nyet  settled and people are still trying to digest the impact\r\n\r\nwhen this increase comes about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of particular concern to Singaporeans will be\r\n\r\nhealthcare   cost.    I  note  the  Minister   for   Health's\r\n\r\nexplanation on this recently, but I am not clear whether  the\r\n\r\nassurance  which  he  had given is in  relation  to  the  GST\r\n\r\nspecifically,  or  whether it was on  healthcare  cost  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.   There is also a concern expressed over the  proposed\r\n\r\nmeans  testing  of subsidised healthcare.  I hope  that  this\r\n\r\nwill not make it much more difficult for those who are really\r\n\r\nin need of help to get subsidised medical care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I end, Sir, there is one old ghost which I would\r\n\r\nlike to revisit since this is a new Parliament, I think it is\r\n\r\nonly  appropriate that we must look at some of the old ghosts\r\n\r\nand  resurrect them for some discussion.  The policy which  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to see changed is the medical benefit policy  for\r\n\r\nfemale civil servants.  I must declare my interest because we\r\n\r\ndo  have many female civil servants in our membership in  the\r\n\r\nNTUC.   Presently,  unlike  their male  counterparts,  family\r\n\r\nmembers of female civil servants do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenjoy subsidised medical benefit.  With a high percentage  of\r\n\r\nwomen  now  in  the workforce - we have two  women  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretaries, we have many women Judges, we have several women\r\n\r\nLieutenant  Colonels - I really do not see  why  we  need  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  with  this policy which is quite unsustainable  and\r\n\r\nthe rationale for which is becoming more and more murky as we\r\n\r\ngo on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I certainly think that it sends a contradictory\r\n\r\nsignal about the Government's position on women.  On the  one\r\n\r\nhand,  the  Government encourages and supports  women's  full\r\n\r\nparticipation in the labour force but, on the other hand,  it\r\n\r\ncontinues  to preserve outdated policies.  Sir,  I  am  quite\r\n\r\nsure that the new Minister for Finance is a very progressive,\r\n\r\nin  fact, fair-minded person and that perhaps, this time,  we\r\n\r\nwill actually see a change in this policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this hopeful note, Sir, I thank you and I support the\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, for allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several European businessmen I met last week, when\r\n\r\ndiscussing the Budget, felt that this is a rather bold,  even\r\n\r\naudacious Budget.  They were very impressed by our commitment\r\n\r\nand  political will to implement fundamental changes  to  our\r\n\r\nfiscal  infrastructure.   They  admired,  even  envied,   our\r\n\r\nfinancial   capacity  and  commitment  to  help  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nadjust.  But they also pointed out that, after all, the  core\r\n\r\nproposal  is  to cut taxes for corporates and  those  at  the\r\n\r\nhigher end of the income spectrum whilst increasing the  GST,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  affect  the  man-in-the-street.   And  in  their\r\n\r\ncountries,  such a fiscal mix would make for a very  volatile\r\n\r\ncocktail.  That is perhaps why Singapore is different.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a close analysis of the Finance Minister's\r\n\r\nspeech  and specific measures within the Budget should dispel\r\n\r\nany  misconceptions.  Because this Budget addresses both  the\r\n\r\nneeds in the immediate term of businesses and talented\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindividuals  so  that they will come here but,  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  also  sets  in  place fundamental changes  which  will\r\n\r\nbenefit Singaporeans as a whole in the long term.  The aim is\r\n\r\nto  create economic growth and jobs.  The strategy is to  put\r\n\r\nin  place fiscal measures that will ensure Singapore's  long-term  competitiveness whilst maintaining essential Government\r\n\r\nservices.  The short-term impact on Singaporeans is cushioned\r\n\r\nby  a slew of offset measures.  And if we are successful  and\r\n\r\nwith  a  modicum of luck, the average Singaporean will  be  a\r\n\r\nsignificant   beneficiary,  through  more  and   better   job\r\n\r\nopportunities as well as higher wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past week or so, I have also had the\r\n\r\nopportunity to discuss the Budget with Singaporeans from  all\r\n\r\nwalks   of  life,  through  numerous  feedback  and  dialogue\r\n\r\nsessions,  and  I  must  say I was  very  inspired  by  their\r\n\r\nfeedback.   In general, Singaporeans accept and  support  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  that  underpin Budget 2002.  They  understand  the\r\n\r\nneed  to  attract and retain businesses and talent to  foster\r\n\r\ngrowth  in  our  economy.   And  they  also  appreciate   the\r\n\r\nheightened competition that Singapore faces and the  need  to\r\n\r\nreposition our economy.  They also understand the  role  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  play through training, skills upgrading, and  maybe\r\n\r\neven absorbing some short-term pain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, Sir, the Singaporeans I have spoken to, and\r\n\r\nthey  are  reflective of Singaporeans in  general,  they  are\r\n\r\nconcerned  about jobs and job security.  They have put  their\r\n\r\ntrust  in  this Government's judgment that Budget  2002,  and\r\n\r\nother recommendations of the Economic Review Committee,  will\r\n\r\nbest serve their long-term interests.  It is critical that we\r\n\r\nlive up to this expectation and fulfill our obligations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to make specific comments on one or two\r\n\r\naspects of the Budget, drawing on some of the feedback I have\r\n\r\nreceived   so  as  to  represent  some  of  the  views   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have conveyed to me.  One pertains to  the  GST,\r\n\r\nand it pertains to the timing and extent of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincrease.  Many have raised this question and I believe  some\r\n\r\nof  my colleagues have done so earlier as well.  Why increase\r\n\r\nthe  GST?  Why now?  And if any increase in the new financial\r\n\r\nyear  is  necessary, why not adopt a more graduated approach?\r\n\r\nThese   questions  come  from  different  segments   of   the\r\n\r\ncommunity,  stemming from varying concerns.  Small businesses\r\n\r\nare concerned that an increase in GST in the current economic\r\n\r\nenvironment will have a further negative psychological impact\r\n\r\non  consumers  and cause contraction in spending.   They  are\r\n\r\nalso worried about an increase in business costs, even though\r\n\r\nGST-registered businesses can claim input taxes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual Singaporeans welcome the Government's\r\n\r\ncomprehensive offset package to ease the impact of the GST on\r\n\r\nthem.   But they also asked whether the whole exercise  could\r\n\r\nhave  been  deferred till the economy is more firmly  on  the\r\n\r\npath to recovery and the employment situation has stabilised.\r\n\r\nThey are concerned that many sellers of products and services\r\n\r\nmight  use this opportunity to raise their prices.   We  have\r\n\r\nthe legendary examples of coffee prices going up by more than\r\n\r\nthe 2% implied by GST increases.  Perhaps the rises in prices\r\n\r\nmay  not be high enough to be deemed to be profiteering  but,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, it could be significantly higher  than  the  2%\r\n\r\nimplied  by the GST rise, and that, in turn, they fear  would\r\n\r\nhave a greater impact on their own spending.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from a broader fiscal perspective, the question is\r\n\r\nalso  whether  the desired corporate and personal  tax  cuts,\r\n\r\nwhich are essential for repositioning our economy, could have\r\n\r\nbeen  absorbed  without a concomitant rise in  the  GST.   In\r\n\r\nparticular, the increase in GST from 3% to 5% is expected  to\r\n\r\nyield  additional  revenue  of $1.3  billion  annually.   The\r\n\r\noffset  package costs nearly the same amount.  The ERS  alone\r\n\r\nwill  cost the Government about $1.2 billion a year  for  the\r\n\r\nnext  three years.  So, that being the case, the question  is\r\n\r\nwhether we could have deferred the decision on the GST.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans accept the need for Government to\r\n\r\ncompensate for revenue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlost through tax cuts in order to meet the growing demand for\r\n\r\nessential   Government   services.   The   Finance   Minister\r\n\r\nelaborated on this point extensively during his statement  on\r\n\r\nthe  need  to  maintain  Government  services  in  education,\r\n\r\nhealth, housing, transport and defence, and I think the point\r\n\r\nhas been well taken by Singaporeans.  The question is whether\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  need to implement the GST immediately,  in  the\r\n\r\nshort term, especially given the economic situation today and\r\n\r\ncost  of  the  offset package.  I do hope  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   and  Finance  Minister  will  elaborate   on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's thinking on this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other aspect that has come up for some degree\r\n\r\nof commentary is the Economic Restructuring Shares.  Sir, the\r\n\r\nERS is a welcome and effective means of cushioning the impact\r\n\r\nof  the  GST  increase  on  average Singaporeans.   The  ERS,\r\n\r\ntogether with the S&C and rental rebates, will go a long  way\r\n\r\ntowards   helping   Singaporeans  adjust  to   the   changes,\r\n\r\nespecially  those  in  financial difficulty.   However,  some\r\n\r\nquestions have been raised on the ERS scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first pertains to its coverage. Many have asked\r\n\r\nwhether  the  ERS  scheme's coverage need be  so  wide.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  even  those  who benefit  from  the  corporate  and\r\n\r\npersonal  tax  reductions and, for  that  matter,  the  other\r\n\r\nreductions  for vehicle related taxes, will be receiving  the\r\n\r\nshares.   Is  that necessary or should the scheme  have  been\r\n\r\nconfined  to those in the lower income brackets or those  who\r\n\r\ndo not benefit directly from the tax reductions?  Sir, unlike\r\n\r\n1994 when the GST was first introduced, in this instance,  it\r\n\r\nis  being  raised to compensate for revenue lost  from  other\r\n\r\nmeasures which already favour those who are better off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question pertains to the criteria for\r\n\r\nallocation.   By  using the annual value  of  properties  and\r\n\r\nsetting it at $10,000, the Minister for Finance has erred  on\r\n\r\nthe  side  of  generosity,  and I suspect  deliberately,  and\r\n\r\ncaptured  all  HDB households, and then some.   But  property\r\n\r\nvalue is a relatively blunt instrument to gauge a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhousehold's  financial situation.  There  are,  for  example,\r\n\r\nmany  retirees who may be living in terrace houses bought  20\r\n\r\nyears  ago, and they certainly do not fall within the  higher\r\n\r\nincome bracket, but they would probably get the lower tranche\r\n\r\nof  ERS  shares.   At the same time, there  are  high  income\r\n\r\nindividuals,  some  owning  several  properties  and  driving\r\n\r\nluxury  cars, who live in HDB flats.  Could we therefore  not\r\n\r\nuse  income, based on income tax returns or other sources  of\r\n\r\ndata,  as  the  allocation  criteria  instead?   I  know  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has to strike the tricky balance between efficiency\r\n\r\nof  the  process and equitability of the outcome.   There  is\r\n\r\nalso  a  need  to  ensure privacy of personal  data  such  as\r\n\r\nincome.   But given the sophistication of IT systems and  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service's  experience with previous  schemes  in  this\r\n\r\ngenre,  could  we  not try to have a more  equitable  outcome\r\n\r\nbased on a more reflective allocation criteria?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the SME perspective and on business cost,\r\n\r\nseveral small businessmen have opined that the Budget appears\r\n\r\nto  favour  the  larger and more profitable companies.   They\r\n\r\npointed  out that a tax cut is useful only if one's  business\r\n\r\nis  profitable  in  the  first place, and  the  reduction  in\r\n\r\npersonal  income tax does not really help them in  attracting\r\n\r\nthe  necessary talent to drive their businesses so as to  get\r\n\r\nthem  into  new  areas of growth.  They  therefore  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to take further measures to reduce business  costs\r\n\r\nwhich  will be of the greatest significance to them, and  the\r\n\r\nkey  components  they  highlight are the  cost  of  land  and\r\n\r\nrentals.  This would also apply to many MNCs who have to  pay\r\n\r\ncorporate  taxes  at the rates applicable  in  the  countries\r\n\r\nwhere  they  are headquartered regardless of Singapore's  tax\r\n\r\nrates.  Many are aware that the Economic Review Committee  is\r\n\r\nstudying  this  aspect  of  the  economy  and  are  anxiously\r\n\r\nawaiting the recommendations on these other measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, a word on intellectual and social capital.\r\n\r\nI  was very inspired by some of the measures announced by the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  to promote and grow both  aspects  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry and economy.  In times of economic difficulty,  there\r\n\r\nis a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntendency  for  companies  to cut  back  on  R&D  expenditure,\r\n\r\nbecause  it has an immediate impact on expenditure  and  cash\r\n\r\nflow, and the benefits are only realised in the long term.  I\r\n\r\nam  therefore glad that the Minister will be liberalizing the\r\n\r\ntax  deduction  for  expenses incurred for  R&D,  leading  to\r\n\r\nownership  of  intellectual  property  in  Singapore.   This,\r\n\r\ntogether with our laws protecting intellectual property, will\r\n\r\ncertainly  encourage Singapore's development  as  a  hub  for\r\n\r\nintellectual capital and knowledge-based industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another casualty of economic hardship is philanthropy.\r\n\r\nI   am  aware  that  many  charities  and  volunteer  welfare\r\n\r\norganisations  are  finding it hard to raise  funds  in  this\r\n\r\nclimate.   Yet, we would all acknowledge that their  work  is\r\n\r\nessential  if  Singapore is to be cohesive and united.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of double tax deductions  of  donations  to\r\n\r\nIPCs  and allowing such tax deductions to be carried  forward\r\n\r\nfor five years is a welcome investment in our social capital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank you for allowing me to join the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my discussions with my community and grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders,  many  have  expressed  concerns  about  Singapore's\r\n\r\nfuture.  Can Singapore continue to remain competitive in  the\r\n\r\nlong  term, especially with the entry of China into the World\r\n\r\nTrade  Organisation, the uncertainties in the global as  well\r\n\r\nas  the  regional  economies and our  neighbours'  intent  to\r\n\r\nchallenge our competitive position, pulling away some of  our\r\n\r\nbusinesses?  As for GST, there is a concern that there may be\r\n\r\nmore GST increases at shorter and more frequent intervals  in\r\n\r\nthe future, especially when we reach the limit of our ability\r\n\r\nto reduce corporate and personal income tax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Budget has addressed some of\r\n\r\nthese fundamental\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcerns.   At  the same time, the Economic Review  Committee\r\n\r\nand  the Remaking of Singapore Committee are considering what\r\n\r\nmore  need  to be done to strengthen Singapore's capacity  to\r\n\r\nkeep ahead of our competitors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our effective economic management and prudent\r\n\r\nfiscal  policy  have  enabled  us  to  accumulate  a  healthy\r\n\r\nreserve,  and we have the resources to decisively restructure\r\n\r\nour  economy  and  be ready for the tough  challenges  ahead.\r\n\r\nSir,   the   recent   General  Elections  have   shown   that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are solidly behind our leaders in their move  to\r\n\r\nchart  new  directions  to be a more vibrant  and  successful\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to overcome the challenges before us, it is clear\r\n\r\nthat  we cannot afford to be complacent and soft.  The  world\r\n\r\nis changing fast and we will have to make changes and adjust,\r\n\r\nregardless of how painful they may be, so that we continue to\r\n\r\nbe  relevant.   We cannot become a low-cost business  centre,\r\n\r\nbut  we  can be a reliable and flexible place to do business.\r\n\r\nWe  must also be ready to accept measures that will enable  a\r\n\r\nfair share of global talents to join our team.  Above all, we\r\n\r\nhave  to strengthen inter-racial and religious confidence  to\r\n\r\nenhance our social cohesion and national unity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this point I would like to stress that the Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity  in  Singapore has a bright and sunny  place  here.\r\n\r\nThe  educational attainments of the Malay students have shown\r\n\r\nremarkable  and  steady  improvements.   Most  of  our  Malay\r\n\r\nstudents  have  strong  grasps of English  and  their  mother\r\n\r\ntongue.   We  can  therefore continue to be relevant  to  the\r\n\r\nglobal new economy.  In fact, some of our Malay students have\r\n\r\nshown  that  they  can attain high rankings in  international\r\n\r\ncompetitions in Science and Mathematics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new Minister in charge of Muslim Affairs, Dr\r\n\r\nYaacob  Ibrahim, has spoken on his vision of a  Community  of\r\n\r\nExcellence.  Sir, I am confident that the community will have\r\n\r\nthe confidence to move ahead and reach higher heights of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexcellence, and we can make significant contributions to push\r\n\r\nSingapore  ahead to a higher standard and quality of  living.\r\n\r\nIn  this connection, Sir, I share entirely what Madam Halimah\r\n\r\nhas  said of the need for us to be ready to make changes  and\r\n\r\nadjustments so that we can continue to excel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with those opening remarks, let me now move to\r\n\r\ncertain  specific  issues.   First,  employability  of  older\r\n\r\nworkers.  Sir, the experience at the CDC's Employment Centres\r\n\r\nis  that it is difficult to find jobs for older workers, even\r\n\r\nfor   those   with  skills,  education  and   relevant   work\r\n\r\nexperience.  This situation is likely to continue  even  when\r\n\r\nthe  economy  improves.  Sir, employers' first preference  is\r\n\r\nfor  younger  workers.  Hence, there is  a  need  to  provide\r\n\r\nurgent  measures  to help older workers and  make  them  more\r\n\r\nconfident.  I think it is necessary to provide more financial\r\n\r\nincentives  to  employers to encourage them to consider  more\r\n\r\nemployment of older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Manpower's People for Jobs\r\n\r\nProgramme is helpful but I think much more need to  be  done.\r\n\r\nCan  we  provide  funds either in the Ministry  of  Finance's\r\n\r\nbudget,  or for SPRING or EDB, so that they can provide  help\r\n\r\nto senior and experienced employees who are now redundant, to\r\n\r\nenable them to set up businesses, say, consultancies, to help\r\n\r\nlocal  businesses to improve their organisations or  even  to\r\n\r\nventure  overseas?   Sir,  the  EDB  may  have  the  Industry\r\n\r\nAssistance   Scheme,  but  the  criteria  are   perhaps   too\r\n\r\nstringent.   Could  we also encourage our  banks  to  open  a\r\n\r\nsympathetic  window to provide loans to persons who  want  to\r\n\r\nopen  businesses,  provided  they  come  up  with  some  good\r\n\r\nbusiness plans?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the South-East CDC has set up job creation\r\n\r\nopportunities.  For example, we provide the Domestic Training\r\n\r\nScheme  and  the  Ministry of Manpower is providing  us  some\r\n\r\nfinancial  provisions.  We will consider more such facilities\r\n\r\nin   the  informal  sector  and  I  believe  my  other  Mayor\r\n\r\ncolleagues are also doing the same.  But we certainly can  do\r\n\r\nwith more funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, more assistance to the small business enterprises\r\n\r\nand on this point Mr S Iswaran has provided some inputs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feedback which I received is that the SMEs are\r\n\r\nrather disappointed with the Budget.  They find that the cost\r\n\r\nof  doing  business is high, eg, high rentals and  also  high\r\n\r\nstatutory  charges,  and many experience cash-flow  problems.\r\n\r\nThey  also find it difficult to get good staff.  Hence, there\r\n\r\nis  a  need to help them to tap finance, recruit good  talent\r\n\r\nand  also  to  help  them  expand  their  business  overseas,\r\n\r\nespecially beyond our troubled region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me touch on the CPF. Many older workers are\r\n\r\nconcerned   about  their  ability  to  meet   their   housing\r\n\r\ncommitments  if the employer's contribution rates  for  older\r\n\r\nworkers  are  reduced.   So  I  think  it  is  important  and\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  quickly clarify and remove  this  uncertainty.\r\n\r\nOlder  workers have planned their commitments on the  current\r\n\r\nrates  and they therefore fear changes.  Perhaps the new  CPF\r\n\r\nrates  should  apply only to younger workers who  could  then\r\n\r\nplan  the use of their CPF for housing, having regard to  the\r\n\r\nnew contribution rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on social cohesion and national unity, the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister has pointed out that we have been  able  to\r\n\r\nweather difficult times because of our strong unity.  We will\r\n\r\nhave  greater challenges to our social cohesion in the  years\r\n\r\nahead,  because  of  September 11 and  also  because  of  the\r\n\r\nincreasingly  competitive global environment.  Sir,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to encourage our companies and businesses to provide  a\r\n\r\nbudget  for  activities to enhance social cohesion  in  their\r\n\r\norganisations  and for the bigger companies,  they  can  also\r\n\r\nperhaps  appoint special staff for this function.   It  would\r\n\r\nbenefit  them  as  it  would  help enhance  teamwork,  better\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and therefore increase productivity.   Perhaps\r\n\r\nsuch  expenditure could receive tax credits  or  can  be  tax\r\n\r\nexempt  and they can use the funds to organise projects  with\r\n\r\nthe local community where the company is located, or with the\r\n\r\nCDCs.   Sir, in this way, we will create a more united people\r\n\r\nand this will certainly enhance our total competitiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, the Budget this\r\n\r\nyear is hard-headed, yet compassionate.  It is hard-headed in\r\n\r\nits determination to restructure Singapore and at a time when\r\n\r\nunemployment is hurting some 100,000 Singaporeans.  Put  them\r\n\r\ntogether, and that is more than three-quarters the population\r\n\r\nsize   of   Tampines  GRC,  my  constituency.   Indeed,   the\r\n\r\nrestructuring  process is likely to cause more  blood  to  be\r\n\r\nspilled  in  the  job  market.  But as the  Finance  Minister\r\n\r\npointed out, this decisive move to restructure the economy is\r\n\r\nthis  country's best hope of staying ahead of  the  race  and\r\n\r\ncreating jobs for our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hard-headedness is balanced by compassion, with the\r\n\r\nclose  attention  paid to those who will be affected  by  the\r\n\r\nrestructuring  process.  The Government should  be  commended\r\n\r\nfor  working  out a generous Economic Restructuring  Package,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  ERS, and for promising that all  lower-income\r\n\r\nhouseholds will not be worse off with the hike in GST rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have several concerns. They revolve around\r\n\r\nthe kind of society that we are building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the measures are said to be aimed ultimately at\r\n\r\ncreating  jobs.   But jobs for whom?  Most  likely,  for  the\r\n\r\nskilled and nimble workers who are able to compete in the new\r\n\r\neconomy.  But if there are not enough of them, we say, \"bring\r\n\r\nin  the foreigners\".  Let me make clear that I am not against\r\n\r\nthis  policy.   It is good for Singapore that  higher  value-added jobs will come in, such as in biotechnology and in  the\r\n\r\nlife  sciences.   It generates growth for  this  country  and\r\n\r\nhelps  to  secure our economic future.  But where  does  that\r\n\r\nleave our lower-income, lower-skilled and our older workers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures show that they are often the first casualties of\r\n\r\nthe  restructuring process.  This is often because  the  jobs\r\n\r\nthat  are  created are way beyond their skills  level  or  in\r\n\r\nentirely  new  high-tech fields.  Their  problem  is  one  of\r\n\r\nstructural unemployment.  This is a problem confronting  many\r\n\r\ndeveloped countries and many countries in transition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the problem is being felt on the ground.\r\n\r\nI  see  a  steady  stream of older workers and  lower-skilled\r\n\r\nworkers  coming  to my meet-the-people sessions  begging  for\r\n\r\njobs.  The success rate of job matching at the North-east CDC\r\n\r\ndoes not give much cause for cheer.  Despite its best efforts\r\n\r\nto  find jobs for 1,220 job applicants from January to  March\r\n\r\nthis  year, only 41 of them were successfully matched with  a\r\n\r\njob.   This  is  about a 3% success rate.  The  main  reasons\r\n\r\ncited  for  the  low  rate: shrinking vacancies  in  the  job\r\n\r\nmarket, more retrenchments, the mindsets of employers and job\r\n\r\nseekers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not helpful for us to keep lamenting that\r\n\r\nthey   are  choosy  about  work  or  have  unreasonable   pay\r\n\r\nexpectations.   Some, especially the older workers,  tell  me\r\n\r\nthat  they are prepared to take lower pay but employers  just\r\n\r\nrefuse  to give them a foot in the door.  Companies are  also\r\n\r\nreluctant  to  send  their older workers for  retraining  and\r\n\r\nupgrading  programmes, preferring to invest in their  younger\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these biases and practices against the older\r\n\r\nworkers,  including  the skilled ones,  must  be  overturned,\r\n\r\nespecially  given  the  fact  that  Singapore  has  an  aging\r\n\r\npopulation.  Will the lower-skilled and older workers have  a\r\n\r\nplace in this new Singapore?  If the Government can go out of\r\n\r\nits  way  to  save  and conserve marine life  in  Chek  Jawa,\r\n\r\nsurely,  it  should  expend even more effort  in  saving  and\r\n\r\npreserving  the economic shelf life of our lower-skilled  and\r\n\r\nolder workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, I would like to make four suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, redistribute the overall gains from free trade\r\n\r\nthrough subsidies to employers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  hire  and  train such workers.  The first step  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection  could  be  a  tax credit.  If  tax  credits  prove\r\n\r\ninsufficient,  the Government should consider cash  subsidies\r\n\r\nto firms that hire and train lower-skilled and older workers.\r\n\r\nOur  People  for Jobs Traineeship scheme should  be  expanded\r\n\r\nfurther.  This is a better option than giving direct handouts\r\n\r\nto  those hit by restructuring.  It fosters self-reliance and\r\n\r\nself-respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, review the effectiveness of the training\r\n\r\nprogrammes. There are many training programmes.  There is  no\r\n\r\ndoubt that the Government has put a lot of thought and effort\r\n\r\ninto  rolling them out.  The issue is how effective are  they\r\n\r\nin  securing  better jobs for displaced workers  in  a  fast-changing environment.  It is a cause for worry that  many  of\r\n\r\nthe places on the various training schemes still go unfilled.\r\n\r\nBut  we cannot expect hard-pressed workers to go for training\r\n\r\njust for the sake of it.  They must be confident that it  can\r\n\r\nreap  some  tangible  benefits for them and  their  families.\r\n\r\nWhat  is the point of going for retraining if at the  end  of\r\n\r\nit, jobs are still elusive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I welcome the Finance Minister's assurance that\r\n\r\nthe  Government will not stint in its support for workers  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  themselves,  we must ask, given  our  scarce  budget\r\n\r\nresources,  how  high  are  the  returns  on  this  slew   of\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   We must identify the effective programmes  that\r\n\r\ncan  lead  to better jobs for workers, rather than  roll  out\r\n\r\nmany programmes with minimal returns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we should address the issue of quality of work\r\n\r\nfor  older workers. This means modifying the organisation  of\r\n\r\nwork,  working hours and working life in general to the needs\r\n\r\nand  abilities  of  the older workers.   Most  older  workers\r\n\r\nseeking  employment today want part-time work.  However,  new\r\n\r\ntypes  of  jobs  suited to the older workers  are  still  too\r\n\r\nscarce.   Presently, only about 3% of workers work  part-time\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must declare my interest. I am working on a\r\n\r\nprogramme to give part-time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwork  for older residents at my ward in a non-profit  elderly\r\n\r\ncentre  in  my constituency, Tampines-Changkat.  I hope  that\r\n\r\nsuch grassroots effort will receive the support of Government\r\n\r\nin terms of funding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should consider providing funding to new\r\n\r\nbusinesses or projects that promote legitimate employment and\r\n\r\ntraining opportunities for these workers.  They may not yield\r\n\r\nhigh-growth rates for the economy but it will give  residents\r\n\r\nsome  useful  pocket money and a greater sense of  belonging.\r\n\r\nWe should also provide incentives for VWOs and CDCs to expend\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities for this group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Africa, to help its older workers cope, the\r\n\r\nGovernment in Zimbabwe has given rural headmen in some  areas\r\n\r\nto  set  aside one plot of land to be farmed jointly  by  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  Private charities, such as HelpAge Zimbabwe,  are\r\n\r\nalso  trying to set the elderly up with small businesses  and\r\n\r\ncollective  farms.  We do not have land to set up farms,  but\r\n\r\nwe  can  take  the  lead  by running  useful  businesses  and\r\n\r\nprojects which involve older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These issues facing us today are not just technical\r\n\r\neconomic issues.  They are also moral and ethical ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those urging ever more tough market measures use the\r\n\r\nlanguage  of  economic efficiency and individual  enterprise.\r\n\r\nThey  tacitly assume that people stay the same regardless  of\r\n\r\nthe  kind of social structures that surround them.   This  is\r\n\r\nnot  true.   If a society becomes too thoroughly  marketised,\r\n\r\nwhere  everyone is an economic entity or else irrelevant,  if\r\n\r\nthe principle of private pursuit of personal gain becomes too\r\n\r\ndominant, then people become greedy and selfish.  I fear that\r\n\r\nwe might run that risk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already, I hear that Singaporeans are not talking just\r\n\r\nabout the 5Cs.  They are now talking about promoting the need\r\n\r\nfor  the  5Ks - Kaki Ko Kaki.  That is Hokkien for \"to  each,\r\n\r\nhis  own.\"   If  we  go down that road, it undermines  social\r\n\r\nrelations that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmake  life worth living.  It treats people as things with  an\r\n\r\nexpiry date.  It breeds alienation and rootlessness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is crucial that we reinvigorate families, community\r\n\r\ngroups  and  VWOs  which  stress responsibilities,  duty  and\r\n\r\nsharing,  to  counterbalance  the  ethic  of  private   self-interest.   The  Government is trying to give  a  balance  by\r\n\r\nraising  public spending significantly on social  development\r\n\r\nand  by  providing the ERS package.  It is well aware of  the\r\n\r\nneed  to  promote  a  sense of community and  to  spread  the\r\n\r\nbenefits of growth across the board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud particularly the tax measures to promote the\r\n\r\nspirit of philanthropy in individuals and corporations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no one disputes that faster growth is necessary to\r\n\r\nreduce  poverty and the income gap between people.  The  more\r\n\r\nchallenging  question is whether economic  growth  itself  is\r\n\r\nenough to achieve our social goals of creating a better  home\r\n\r\nand a better future for all Singaporeans.  The Government has\r\n\r\nlong  subscribed to the world view in which the  rising  tide\r\n\r\nlifts   all  boats,  including  many  at  the  bottom.    But\r\n\r\nincreasingly, this world view is being challenged.  The  poor\r\n\r\ndo  get  richer,  but at a far slower pace than  the  higher-income  group.    This leads to a widening income  gap.   The\r\n\r\nlatest  measures to cut tax rates will widen this income  gap\r\n\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was with an eye on this widening gulf that Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Goh Chok Tong had last year stressed  the  need  to\r\n\r\nforge  a  new  social compact. One prong  of  it  is  to  pay\r\n\r\nparticular   attention  to  the  needs  of  the  lower-income\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  But going by the handout given by the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister,   the   table  which  says  \"Impact   of   Economic\r\n\r\nRestructuring Package on representative households\", it would\r\n\r\nappear that those who gain most would be those in 4-room  and\r\n\r\n5-room  flats,  mainly because of the ERS.   Unlike  previous\r\n\r\nredistribution of budget surpluses, this time the  allocation\r\n\r\nis not skewed in favour of the lower-income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the NSS scheme last year, the lower-income\r\n\r\nreceives  seven times more shares than the top earners.   The\r\n\r\nEconomic  Restructuring  Shares will  be  redistributed  more\r\n\r\nevenly,  with  more  than  90% of  households  receiving  the\r\n\r\nmaximum, 1,200 shares each and the rest, half of that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not help very much to narrow the income gap.\r\n\r\nIn  a  sense, this focus on the middle-income is  fair.   The\r\n\r\nmiddle-class is also hit by restructuring, and in some cases,\r\n\r\neven  harder,  as they have to bear higher financial  burdens\r\n\r\nthan  the lower-income.  Middle-income families, as we  know,\r\n\r\nnow  form the bulk of Singaporeans.  About 60% of HDB  owners\r\n\r\nlive in 4- or 5-room flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So perhaps it is right that they get attention this time\r\n\r\nround.  On the other hand, unlike those without the skills to\r\n\r\ncope  in the new economy, the middle-class Singaporeans  have\r\n\r\nmore  resources and abilities to fall back on.   It  is  this\r\n\r\nresilience that we need to encourage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a danger that all the welfare and wealth-sharing mechanisms and schemes will be taken for granted and\r\n\r\nthat  everybody  would begin to expect them as  a  matter  of\r\n\r\ncourse.   I am not saying that we should not help the middle-income families but I am saying that we should help them, but\r\n\r\nto  help  the lower-income more.  They are the ones  who  are\r\n\r\nfinding  it  hard  to cope and they are the ones  who  should\r\n\r\ndeserve our special attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fundamental task of every legitimate government\r\n\r\nis  to  secure  the  good society for its citizens.   A  good\r\n\r\ngovernment has to discern the true interests of this  country\r\n\r\nto  invent  and  pursue  policies that  transcend  the  self-interest often revealed in public opinion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing which worries me is how quickly\r\n\r\ndespondency descends on the public mood when faced  with  bad\r\n\r\ntimes.   The danger is that it can paralyse required  efforts\r\n\r\nto  turn  retreat into advance.  And this mood does not  only\r\n\r\naffect  the  vulnerable groups, such as the lower-income  and\r\n\r\nolder workers, it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseems that they are also spreading to the younger generation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an Asian survey conducted last year for Coca-Cola,\r\n\r\nyoung Singaporeans are found to be the least optimistic among\r\n\r\nyoung  people  surveyed in eight countries.   Asked  if  they\r\n\r\nagree   that   the  future  always  offers   more   and   new\r\n\r\npossibilities, only about 65% of Singaporeans say  yes.  This\r\n\r\nis compared to 84% in Malaysia and 91% in Thailand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possible reason for this could be the trend towards\r\n\r\nmore  unemployed graduates.  The latest labour  force  survey\r\n\r\nshowed  that  the  number of graduates unemployed  rose  from\r\n\r\n6,600  in 1997 to more than 20,000 last year.  The Government\r\n\r\nmust give hope that the restructuring will yield jobs for the\r\n\r\nmass of Singaporeans and that it will indeed translate into a\r\n\r\nbetter Singapore with opportunities for all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, employment is not just about numbers or a line on a\r\n\r\nchart.   The  conditions under which work is  performed,  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood  it  provides, and the solidarity shown  by  those\r\n\r\ndoing  well  in  this  new  economy  towards  those  who  are\r\n\r\ndisplaced by it - these are all measures of a decent society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to take this opportunity to also lend my\r\n\r\nvoice  and support to Halimah who asked for a review  of  the\r\n\r\nmedical  benefits scheme for women.  I had intended to  raise\r\n\r\nthis  as  a Budget cut which I put under the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nOffice  but I just want to say that it is an outmoded  policy\r\n\r\nand it definitely needs to be reviewed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his Address, the President called on us to\r\n\r\nremake  Singapore together so that we will continue to thrive\r\n\r\nand  prosper  in  an  uncertain  world.   The  world  may  be\r\n\r\nuncertain  but  we  have  to  be certain  about  why  we  are\r\n\r\nembarking  on this difficult journey as a people.  It  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  only  for  economic growth.  In this globalised  economy,\r\n\r\ngrowth rates can zig zag up and down very rapidly, as we have\r\n\r\nall found out, and if that is what we hitch our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndestiny  and  happiness to, we will be quite a  sick  people.\r\n\r\nNausea  cannot be a driving force.  In facing these difficult\r\n\r\ntimes,  we  must equip and engage our people as  citizens  in\r\n\r\nshaping their future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This economic downturn will be worth all the troubles\r\n\r\nand problems they give us if they show up the areas which  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  work  on,  and  teach us that  the  true  worth  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship  lies not in waiting selfishly to be helped,  but\r\n\r\nin  helping ourselves and our fellow citizens.  We will need,\r\n\r\nin  larger  measure  than before, the help and  encouragement\r\n\r\nthat  the  strong  can give the weak.  Thus  helped,  we  all\r\n\r\nshould  rise to the path that leads to the objective we  have\r\n\r\nall   pledged  ourselves  to:   \"Happiness,  prosperity   and\r\n\r\nprogress for our nation.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\ncongratulate  the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  his  courage and vision in outlining for us a  pragmatic\r\n\r\nand competitive strategy in this Budget that will see through\r\n\r\nthe  remaking  and  survival  of Singapore  in  these  highly\r\n\r\nvolatile times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget has been labelled \"pro-individual\".\r\n\r\nIt  has also been called  \"pro-business\".  Many agree that it\r\n\r\nis  indeed a \"balanced\" Budget.  The need to enhance business\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness in the country by reducing the cost of  doing\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  Singapore  is balanced off  by  mitigating  the\r\n\r\nimpact   of  the  associated  measures  on  the  economically\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged  consumers and businesses, as well  as  by  the\r\n\r\nneed to meet the concerns and aspirations of its citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noteworthy that the Finance Minister has actually,\r\n\r\nafter  taking into account relief packages, budgetted  for  a\r\n\r\nsmall  deficit  of  $190  million.  For  a  country  used  to\r\n\r\nenjoying surpluses in excess of $10 billion, this is symbolic\r\n\r\nand  could be viewed as an indication of the resolve  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to increase Singapore's competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not an entirely painless budget for some, the\r\n\r\nkeywords used by the press\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto describe the Budget Statement were \"bold and competitive.\"\r\n\r\nThere  has been applause from businesses, and even  Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nSee  Tong from Potong Pasir has been positive in his response\r\n\r\nto the press after the budget announcement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, the reactions of the men-in-the-street - the workers, the wage earners and the displaced\r\n\r\nprofessionals,  executives and managers  -  have  yet  to  be\r\n\r\ndigested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Singaporeans, especially the middle-income\r\n\r\ngroups,  have  expressed their displeasure at  the  allotment\r\n\r\nformula  used  in  the first distribution  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nShares.   This  time, the Government has heard their  voices,\r\n\r\nand   has   made  the  necessary  adjustments  to  make   the\r\n\r\ndistribution of the Economic Restructuring Shares more widely\r\n\r\nacceptable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, as the Finance Minister has put it, Singapore\r\n\r\nhas to make painful but necessary adjustments now so that  we\r\n\r\ncan   sharpen   our  competitive  edge  in  an   increasingly\r\n\r\nunpredictable  world.  This year's Budget must be  understood\r\n\r\nin this context.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government has made these unavoidable\r\n\r\nadjustments less painful, Singaporeans must fully accept  the\r\n\r\nsurgical  act when it comes, as otherwise the patient  cannot\r\n\r\nrecover.   Let  us  therefore take comfort in  the  assurance\r\n\r\ngiven  by  Government that we are in their good and competent\r\n\r\nhands,  that Singaporeans will be widely consulted  and  that\r\n\r\nramifications of any measures are clear.  As with  any  major\r\n\r\noperation, life-supporting and life-saving equipment as  well\r\n\r\nas contingency plans must be in good working order before the\r\n\r\nsurgical knife is delicately applied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pronouncements in this year's Budget have all the\r\n\r\nmakings of a successful operation.  But until Singapore fully\r\n\r\nrecovers   from  the  operation,  ie,  the  remaking  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy,  external  global viruses and infections  can  still\r\n\r\nattack us\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith   impunity,   often  without  warning.    I   urge   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to accept some of the painful adjustments  such\r\n\r\nas the GST increase as a necessary vitamin pill to strengthen\r\n\r\nour competitive immunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that a key fundamental that has helped\r\n\r\nSingapore  make economic progress in these last 37 years  has\r\n\r\nbeen  the  vigilant  and robust promotion of  wise  economic,\r\n\r\nsocial  and political policies.  These policies have  brought\r\n\r\nabout   political   stability,  racial  harmony,   industrial\r\n\r\nadvancement and a secure livelihood for our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the farsighted and dynamic leadership of the\r\n\r\npresent  Government  and with the unanimous  support  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore, this little island with no resources has\r\n\r\nmade  quantum  progress  in  various  fields,  much  to   the\r\n\r\ndiscomfort   of   our  Malaysian  neighbour.    I   am   sure\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are proud to belong to a nation whose future  is\r\n\r\npromising and a Government that has always come good  on  its\r\n\r\npromises to the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, today, Singapore is operating in a very\r\n\r\ncompetitive  business environment, but some  Singaporeans  do\r\n\r\nnot seem to grasp the momentous and dramatic changes going on\r\n\r\naround  us.   Singapore faces increasingly fierce competition\r\n\r\nfrom  China,  which today offers a haven for investors.   But\r\n\r\nare  we  prepared  to  take  the  Chinese  on  in  terms   of\r\n\r\ncreativity, entrepreneurship, and sheer diligence?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even our much vaunted advantage over the Chinese in the\r\n\r\narea  of  services  may now be under threat.   Prof.  Michael\r\n\r\nPorter has recently pointed out that our nation needs to work\r\n\r\non  some of our competitive strengths, one of which is in the\r\n\r\narea  of  services.  However, if we are not careful,  we  may\r\n\r\neven lose this edge to China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a point of illustration, Sir, I had an opportunity\r\n\r\nlast month to attend the Assembly of the Asian Parliaments in\r\n\r\nChina.   Prior to this visit, my last visit to China was  two\r\n\r\nand  a  half  years  ago.  I must say, the first  thing  that\r\n\r\nstruck me this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime  round was the tremendous change in the attitude of  the\r\n\r\nChinese people.  What I could literally feel was their hunger\r\n\r\nfor  knowledge, friendship and the desire to want  to  please\r\n\r\nand  serve their foreign guests from both young and old,  men\r\n\r\nand women alike.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Chinese people, attending to the Assembly,\r\n\r\nspoke  grammatically flawless English.  It seemed  as  though\r\n\r\nthey  had learnt  \"by heart every phrase and choice of word,\"\r\n\r\nto  demonstrate  that I can do just as well, if  not  better.\r\n\r\nThey  even delivered their services beyond what was  normally\r\n\r\nexpected of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when you ask for the directions to the\r\n\r\nwashroom,  the service provider will walk you  all  the  way.\r\n\r\nSuch  is  the  kind of service excellence that  will  make  a\r\n\r\ndelightful service experience and provide the cutting edge in\r\n\r\nthe  competition.  The whole attitude displayed  was  one  of\r\n\r\neagerness to show their feats and their readiness to  embrace\r\n\r\nforeign investors.  Customer savvyness  seems to become  more\r\n\r\nand more an ingrained part of the Chinese psyche.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in remaking Singapore, our ultimate aim is to\r\n\r\nthrive  and  prosper in this global competition.   Our  long-standing  principle  \"to  make as few  enemies  but  as  many\r\n\r\nfriends as possible\" is worth revisiting.  By this principle,\r\n\r\nwe  will  make more friends amongst men and nations, and  our\r\n\r\npersonal  and national prestige can be expected to grow.   No\r\n\r\ndoubt  the pedagogy of engaging Singaporeans from all sectors\r\n\r\nof  our  society  in  this remaking  is  a  resounding  move.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, our policy makers and leadership must be able to\r\n\r\nconvince and win the hearts and minds of our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China's economic involvement will increase in this part\r\n\r\nof the world.  It is to our advantage that we start preparing\r\n\r\nour young for more involvement with China, as the majority of\r\n\r\nour  students  still  betray very  scanty  knowledge  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our students have even expressed disbelief at\r\n\r\nreports of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrapidity  with  which the Chinese people have  made  economic\r\n\r\nprogress.   What is even more disturbing is that some of  our\r\n\r\nstudents  have shown a marked reluctance to monitor and  keep\r\n\r\nup with developments in China.  To many of them, the world of\r\n\r\nexcitement and progress is still America and Europe.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to propose that the Ministry of Education sets aside  a\r\n\r\nbudget  to  organise  more  subsidised  educational-cum-trade\r\n\r\nmissions   for  our  students  from  secondary  and  tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such educational-cum-trade missions will provide a\r\n\r\nmelting pot into which distances, differences, prejudices and\r\n\r\neven  self-interest  are integrated, mixed  and  brewed  into\r\n\r\nmutual beneficial arrangements.  What I saw during this trip,\r\n\r\nin  the world's largest dam construction of the Three Gorges,\r\n\r\nwill  amaze Singaporeans of the engineering prowess and  feat\r\n\r\nof the Chinese civil engineers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dam site takes 17 years to construct. 28,000 people\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  this project have been living in this  isolated\r\n\r\nsite  since 10 years ago and will continue to live there till\r\n\r\n2009, the expected date of completion.   All these will be  a\r\n\r\nreminder to Singaporeans that, at the end of the day, it is a\r\n\r\nflexible, adaptable and enduring attitude that will make us a\r\n\r\nwinner, granted that all other qualities are a given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also timely that a national customer service\r\n\r\nprogramme  be  mounted to start inculcating service  attitude\r\n\r\nand service skills in our students who are the future service\r\n\r\nleaders  of  tomorrow.  Sir, it is not  enough  to  have  the\r\n\r\nknowledge of the product.  That is going to be a given.   But\r\n\r\nthe service attitude and skills will make that difference  in\r\n\r\nwhether customers choose to patronise the business again  and\r\n\r\nagain.  In inculcating such values and attributes, we need to\r\n\r\nstart early.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my proposition for such a programme is premised on\r\n\r\npracticality  and  what is much needed in the  real  business\r\n\r\nworld.   The  IT world has taken away too much of  the  human\r\n\r\ntouch and face to face encounter, and we need to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbring back these old but results-winning formula.  Again, the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education should seriously consider incorporating\r\n\r\nsuch a programme into its syllabus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This programme is about \"Hui Zhuo Ren, Hui Yong Ren\", a\r\n\r\nphrase  used by shipping tycoon, Li Ka Shing when asked  what\r\n\r\nwas  the secret of his success.  This phrase means, if we  do\r\n\r\nit  right from here on the way to deal with people, we  would\r\n\r\nhave equipped ourselves with a powerful tool for survival.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no point remaking Singapore in all the 5Cs if we\r\n\r\ncannot  recognise  that the fundamental C is  your  customer,\r\n\r\nboth  internal  and external, whom you must win  over.   When\r\n\r\nthat  happens,  then  all the Cs of cash,  condominium,  car,\r\n\r\ncredit  card, club will be yours with the wink of an eye  and\r\n\r\nthe smile of the lips.  Sir, we need to learn the finesse  of\r\n\r\nwinning  people in this competition, and we must  start  with\r\n\r\nour students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have mentioned in the beginning that some have\r\n\r\nfelt  the  pain  of  this Budget.  I agree with  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister's  sentiments that this is not a  give-away  but  an\r\n\r\nencouragement  to help Singaporeans remake  themselves.   The\r\n\r\npro-business strategy of our Government all these  years  has\r\n\r\nbeen  necessitated by our geographical size and fate and this\r\n\r\nyear's Budget continues to aim at attracting investments plus\r\n\r\nglobal talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shift to an indirect mode of taxation is in the\r\n\r\nright direction.  The increase in the GST, which is meant  to\r\n\r\nmake  up for the loss in revenue as a result of the reduction\r\n\r\nin  corporate  and  income taxes, is well  cushioned  by  the\r\n\r\noffset  package  which  ranges to about  10  years  for  some\r\n\r\ncategories.   As  can be expected, there are Singaporeans  in\r\n\r\nour midst who will be left out totally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hardest hit in this downturn is the cohort of\r\n\r\ndisplaced professionals, executives and managers I label PEM.\r\n\r\nUnlike the unskilled lower income and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nolder   workers  who  touch  at  the  heartstrings   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  PEMs do not do that well.  Many retrenched  PEMs\r\n\r\nhave  heavy  commitments incurred during  better  times,  eg,\r\n\r\nmortgages, loans, children's educational expenses. Yet,  when\r\n\r\nthey  are out of work, they are not considered \"poor  enough\"\r\n\r\nto  qualify for the offset measures spelt out for the  lower-income groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the same vein as Mr Iswaran who has treaded on the\r\n\r\nsubject  of  the ERS, I offer another perspective.   Some  of\r\n\r\nthese displaced PEMs reside in residential dwellings and,  as\r\n\r\nsuch,  will  not  be eligible for the higher tranche  of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Restructuring Shares (ERS).   Therefore  using  the\r\n\r\ncriterion of housing type or value may penalise those in need\r\n\r\nof  real  help.   To extend the argument, one may  say,  then\r\n\r\ndowngrade.   But,  Sir,  this may be painful  as  residential\r\n\r\nproperty  prices  were much higher in the past  and  it  just\r\n\r\nmakes no economic sense to sell at a loss.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me turn to some other areas where further\r\n\r\nstrengthening of our social fabric can take place.  The  bulk\r\n\r\nof  the  displaced PEMs, if they remain unemployed, will  not\r\n\r\ngain  from any income tax deduction in 2003, whereas in 2002,\r\n\r\nwhen they lost their jobs, they had to fork out their savings\r\n\r\nto  pay tax for income earned in the year 2001.  The increase\r\n\r\nin GST will be an additional burden compared to those who are\r\n\r\ngainfully employed.  They need some financial assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I therefore humbly request that this group of\r\n\r\naffected Singaporeans be helped in the transition, as they do\r\n\r\nnot  benefit from the tax-saving and road tax saving, and yet\r\n\r\nthey  have to meet additional expenses due to the higher GST,\r\n\r\ntransport  and  parking charges?  Will the  Finance  Minister\r\n\r\nconsider making an exception for displaced PEMs to enjoy  the\r\n\r\nhigher  tranche  of the ERS, if at the point  of  issue  they\r\n\r\nstill have not found employment, and not subject them to  the\r\n\r\ncriterion of housing type?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, taking care of the elderly and needy requires\r\n\r\nsacrifices and resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith  GST  and other increases associated with ferrying  them\r\n\r\naround,  people  who do not qualify for the  offset  measures\r\n\r\nneed  to  be  helped, especially when they  are  affected  by\r\n\r\ndifficult economic situations, such as unemployment  and  its\r\n\r\naccompanying effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget is silent on the assistance measures. I\r\n\r\nwould  like to urge the Government to consider the plight  of\r\n\r\npeople   who  have  to  take  care  of  the  less  fortunate,\r\n\r\nespecially  when they are handicapped or are  suffering  from\r\n\r\nillnesses requiring regular treatments, and thereby having to\r\n\r\nincur non-healthcare related expenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the highly anticipated changes to the role of\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked Companies (GLCs) were not mentioned in  the\r\n\r\nBudget.   Generally,  the feeling of the small-time  business\r\n\r\nplayers  is  that  they relish being courted  or  invited  to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  the business of the GLCs.  I recognise  that\r\n\r\nthis  should not be too great an issue if the SMEs can  prove\r\n\r\nthat  they  have value added contribution to  make.   No  one\r\n\r\nbegrudges  the  GLCs of their right to compete for  business,\r\n\r\nespecially in those areas that are their forte.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I continue to encourage and support Government private\r\n\r\njoint   ventures  in  order  to  further  consolidate  social\r\n\r\nconstruction  and  welfare services.  I  trust  hon.  Members\r\n\r\nwould  agree  that the hard work of our people and  the  wise\r\n\r\nleadership  have  enabled resource scarce Singapore  to  grow\r\n\r\ninto  an  economically strong and prosperous nation within  a\r\n\r\nshort period of its independence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must therefore continue to nurture our national\r\n\r\ncapitalists through business opportunities and, at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  grow  the State coffers from the profits derived  from\r\n\r\nthe  GLCs.   These profits can be used to initiate programmes\r\n\r\nto help  the aged and the handicapped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the increase in parking charges, I fear\r\n\r\nthat the cost will go up for those who use their vehicles for\r\n\r\ncarrying out their work activities, eg, taxi drivers,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbus   operators,  heavy  vehicle  operators,   salesmen   and\r\n\r\ntechnicians.   Unlike  those  who  use  their  vehicles   for\r\n\r\nconvenience and comfort, these vehicles are essential to  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of these Singaporeans.  Is the increase on vehicle\r\n\r\nusage  aimed  at those in the second category  or  the  first\r\n\r\ncategory?   Should  we have a differential  in  the  rate  of\r\n\r\ncharges  for  the two categories in order to achieve  a  more\r\n\r\nequitable imposition of such increases?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern arising from the increase in parking\r\n\r\ncharges  is  the issue of illegal parking in private  estates\r\n\r\nnear  to  HDB  estates.  Our successful  integration  of  HDB\r\n\r\ndwellings  with  private  residential  estates  has  made  it\r\n\r\nconvenient for vehicle owners, including goods vehicles  from\r\n\r\nHDB  estates,  to  park their vehicles in  these  residential\r\n\r\nestates,  often  causing  inconvenience.   Will  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister kindly look into some of these implementation issues\r\n\r\nso as to minimise negative consequences?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to end here by saying that in this\r\n\r\ntime of great change and in the midst of the terrorist threat\r\n\r\nand political instability in the Middle East, it is important\r\n\r\nthat Singapore continues to surge forward with both political\r\n\r\nand   economic  strength.   The  Finance  Minister   deserves\r\n\r\nappreciation from all in this House for presenting  a  Budget\r\n\r\nwhich  pulls  no  punches in laying out a  strong  and  sound\r\n\r\nlaunching  pad by which the economy will find the ballast  to\r\n\r\nthrust us upwards into higher global reaches.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Mdm Halimah and Ms Irene Ng, I look forward to the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister's  pro-women policies in  order  that  more\r\n\r\nSingapore women will be convinced to come forward to serve in\r\n\r\nthis august Chamber.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I join my colleagues in supporting this Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the new economic landscape created by a sea change over\r\n\r\nthe last few years warrants a new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbudgeting  paradigm.   Budget  2002  manifests  this  as   it\r\n\r\nrepresents   more  than  a  carefully  thought  revenue   and\r\n\r\nexpenditure plan with its broad policy and strategic thrusts.\r\n\r\nBeyond  the  cyclical  measures and the short-term  budgetary\r\n\r\ngoodies, more importantly, the 2002 Budget embodies  two  key\r\n\r\ntenets which I would like to highlight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first tenet refers to an \"under siege\" Budget.\r\n\r\nThere  have  been criticisms aplenty about this  Government's\r\n\r\noverly  cautious approach to budgeting.  The debates in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  accompanying  last  year's second  set  of  off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures amply illustrate this point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, a journalist commented in a recent story\r\n\r\nin  Streats  that  he  knows of no other government  that  is\r\n\r\nplanning to give hand-outs just after general elections,  and\r\n\r\nin  the midst of a recession.  This remarkable ability to  do\r\n\r\nso  stems  from  our  previous healthy budget  surpluses  and\r\n\r\nprudent fiscal management.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, underlying this conservative budgetary approach is\r\n\r\nwhat  critics have described as a siege mentality,  bordering\r\n\r\non  paranoia, a general reluctance to loosen up, to  being  a\r\n\r\ntad  more  generous.  This is borne of fear that baser  human\r\n\r\ninstincts may take over and lead to the squander of  precious\r\n\r\nresources,  like  the  prodigal son in  the  Bible.   Such  a\r\n\r\nmindset, however unpopular, is nonetheless not completely  at\r\n\r\nodds with the New Singapore we are trying to create.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we push ahead with giving our citizens more\r\n\r\neconomic,   social  and  political  space,  the   forces   of\r\n\r\nglobalisation   will  create  winners   and   losers.    This\r\n\r\nGovernment needs to build up the resources to help the weaker\r\n\r\nmembers  of  our  society  - the aged,  the  underclass,  the\r\n\r\nphysically  and  mentally challenged - who feel  increasingly\r\n\r\nbewildered by the profound changes affecting us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic base is being challenged by the rise of\r\n\r\nChina and India.  Around us\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoo, there are also voices of suppressed anger and envy.   We\r\n\r\nare  a little red dot, and a cat waiting to be skinned.  Sir,\r\n\r\nwe are indeed under siege.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the very small budget deficit of $190 million\r\n\r\nafter  implementing the proposed tax changes and  GST  offset\r\n\r\npackage  is  understandable.  A budget should not be  viewed,\r\n\r\nlike  in  some  quarters, as a well-conceived plan  to  spend\r\n\r\nbeyond  one's  means.   Our years of prudent  budgeting  have\r\n\r\ngiven  us  fiscal surpluses that have enabled us to implement\r\n\r\noff-Budget  measures,  including  immediate  significant  tax\r\n\r\ncuts, without undermining our fiscal position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am very pleased that the tenor\r\n\r\nof  this  Budget shows a sensible approach to  balancing  the\r\n\r\ncompeting  claims  that  confront us  and  yet,  retains  the\r\n\r\nprudence  of  past  budgets,  belying  our  siege  mentality.\r\n\r\nFuture budgets of this Government will undoubtedly follow the\r\n\r\nspirit of this Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second key tenet I would like to highlight is one of\r\n\r\nletting  winners  emerge.  Sir, this Budget  can  be  rightly\r\n\r\ncalled  a  New Singapore Budget, a watershed Budget,  one  in\r\n\r\nwhich  due  recognition  is given  to  the  markedly  changed\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  precipitated  by  the  onslaught  of   global\r\n\r\ncompetition and heightened nationalism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I am delighted to note that the Budget\r\n\r\nrepresents  the  beginnings  of  a  sea  change  in  the  way\r\n\r\nindustrial policy is being pursued, from trying to  pick  and\r\n\r\ngroom winners, including GLCs, to creating an environment, an\r\n\r\necosystem, in which winners can emerge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowing an analogy from the stock market, the\r\n\r\nefficient  market  hypothesis  postulates  that  one   cannot\r\n\r\nperpetually outperform the market by intelligent stock picks.\r\n\r\nNeither  can we do so for industrial sectors, no  matter  how\r\n\r\n\"sexy\" they may be.  Hence, as Harvard academic Rosabeth Moss\r\n\r\nKanter recently remarked, it will be better not to place your\r\n\r\nbets only on a few\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkey  industries, but to cast the net wider and  bet  on  more\r\n\r\nsectors, including the social services or people sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is exactly the comment of a volunteer\r\n\r\nsocial worker for autistic children whom I recently met.  She\r\n\r\nobserved that every time they organise a seminar or course on\r\n\r\nautism, it is over-subscribed with many participants from the\r\n\r\nregion.   She  feels  that there is scope  for  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nbecome  a  regional  hub  for  special  education,  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should also take a bet in this  sector,  and  not\r\n\r\njust in mainstream education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2002, as my other parliamentary colleagues have\r\n\r\nnoted,  is clearly only one part of a very large jigsaw  that\r\n\r\nis  still being put together to remake Singapore for the  new\r\n\r\nuncertain  and volatile world.  It initiates the  process  of\r\n\r\nrestructuring  Singapore, but a lot more  work  needs  to  be\r\n\r\ndone.   There  are  some areas of concern  that  need  to  be\r\n\r\naddressed  to  ensure that Singapore can play confidently  in\r\n\r\nthe  major league - share in the pie and not just pick up the\r\n\r\ncrumbs.  And I wish to highlight three.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the plight of the SMEs. Although the generous\r\n\r\nincome  and corporate tax rate cuts and group tax relief  are\r\n\r\nwelcomed by manufacturers, a frequent complaint has been that\r\n\r\nthis  Budget  does little to help SMEs faced  with  shrinking\r\n\r\nmarkets,  high  costs  and domestic competition  from  multi-nationals and GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the oft-repeated refrain of what use is the\r\n\r\nreduction  in corporate taxes if there is no profit  to  tax.\r\n\r\nWorse   still,  the  shift  from  direct  taxes  to  indirect\r\n\r\nconsumption  and  usage-based  taxes  will  exacerbate  their\r\n\r\ndifficulties.   While consumers can turn to  the  GST  offset\r\n\r\npackage  and the economic restructuring shares, SMEs continue\r\n\r\nto face daunting cost structures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I appreciate that Singapore's limitations will\r\n\r\nalways mean that we cannot compete with the low cost base  of\r\n\r\nChina or India and, hence, are at risk of more hollowing out.\r\n\r\nWhile the policy of moving\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  the  value chain and promoting entrepreneurial  start-ups\r\n\r\nthat could become the next Creative Technology is, I believe,\r\n\r\ncorrect.   SMEs are also our constituents.  They  do  have  a\r\n\r\nrole  to  play  in  the economy and should  not  be  left  to\r\n\r\nstruggle on their own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would thus like to echo the calls of the SMEs and urge\r\n\r\nthe  Government to undertake a comprehensive  review  of  all\r\n\r\nGovernment  administered charges and levies and  reduce  them\r\n\r\nwhere possible, so that operating costs could be kept as  low\r\n\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I have no quarrel with the view held by the\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister of State for Trade and Industry, Mr  Tharman\r\n\r\nShanmugaratnam,  that  the  lasting  solution  for   economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness   is   not   lower   costs,   but    stronger\r\n\r\ncapabilities,   streamlining  and   reducing   costs,   where\r\n\r\npossible,  would  clearly  allow the  ship  to  be  run  more\r\n\r\ntightly,  and  thus making it more profitable without  losing\r\n\r\nits seaworthiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should also be a thorough review of all Government\r\n\r\nrules  and  regulations which affect  SMEs  with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nrationalising  these  rules  and regulations  to  remove  any\r\n\r\nbarriers  to doing business.  Many businessmen have expressed\r\n\r\nfrustration over the labyrinth of rules and regulations  they\r\n\r\nmust negotiate.  More recently, for instance, Mr Simon Lim, a\r\n\r\nDirector at Wong San's pub in Mohamed Sultan Road was  quoted\r\n\r\nin  the  press as saying that setting up a pub could  involve\r\n\r\n\"onerous\"  applications to at least seven separate Government\r\n\r\nagencies!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I support some of the ERC's recommendations on\r\n\r\ntaxes and incentives that would help SMEs.  These include the\r\n\r\nbroadening  of the Technopreneur Investment Incentive  to  an\r\n\r\nEntrepreneur Investment Incentive to be made available  to  a\r\n\r\nwider  group  of  entrepreneurs, and not just  the  high-tech\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third concern relates to rationalising the role of\r\n\r\nGLCs.   Again, there has been considerable debate  about  the\r\n\r\nrole of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLCs in Singapore's economic development, and their \"crowding\r\n\r\nout\"  effects.  Sir, it is recognised that GLCs, such as  SIA\r\n\r\nand   PSA,   have  played  critical  roles  in  the  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Singapore.  Indeed, I have no doubt that  GLCs\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  play  important  roles  in  the  economy,\r\n\r\nspecifically in areas where the private sector does not  have\r\n\r\nthe resources or the will to enter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I submit that, important as GLCs have been in the\r\n\r\npast,  the  time has come for them to re-look  at  their  own\r\n\r\nbackyards.    Recapping   a   now  familiar   criticism,   an\r\n\r\nunidentified businessman was quoted in the Straits Times, 4th\r\n\r\nMay  2002,  that there is a perception among many, even  till\r\n\r\nnow,  that GLCs have intruded into every profitable  business\r\n\r\nthere  is,  often  at  the  expense of  the  private  sector.\r\n\r\nSometimes,  the companies at risk are the SMEs  who  are,  at\r\n\r\ntimes,  aggrieved  by the zeal of GLCs  in  their  quest  for\r\n\r\nhigher EVAs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The working out of a charter for Temasek Holdings to\r\n\r\nspell out its mission and responsibilities, and make it clear\r\n\r\nhow  the  Government sees the role of the Temasek  stable  of\r\n\r\ncompanies  in the Singapore economy is therefore  timely  and\r\n\r\nwelcomed.   It  is also heartening to note that the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance has categorically stated that the Government will\r\n\r\ndivest or dilute its shareholdings in a controlled manner  in\r\n\r\nGLCs  that  are  no  longer relevant  to  the  Government  or\r\n\r\nTemasek's objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I am pleased to note that the ERC sub-committee headed by the Minister of State for Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry and Foreign Affairs, Mr Raymond Lim, is working  out\r\n\r\na  set of guiding principles for Government's involvement  in\r\n\r\nbusiness.   This is to ensure that private sector  initiative\r\n\r\nwill  not be stifled by the pervasive role of GLCs with  deep\r\n\r\npockets  and abundance of scholarly talent, or even statutory\r\n\r\nboards offering services to the public that are already being\r\n\r\noffered  by private entities.  Instead, GLCs could facilitate\r\n\r\nthe internationalisation of SMEs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby working jointly with them on overseas projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that clarifying the role of GLCs would help\r\n\r\ndefine   business   areas   where   GLCs   could   contribute\r\n\r\nstrategically  to  the  development of  the  economy  without\r\n\r\ntreading into areas where the private sector is fully capable\r\n\r\nof handling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my third concern relates to helping stragglers\r\n\r\ncope.   Even as the Government embarks in earnest to  put  in\r\n\r\nplace  changes  that  will  help  Singapore  survive  in   an\r\n\r\nincreasingly competitive and hostile environment,  there  are\r\n\r\nmany  in the marathon race that are straggling behind.  These\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are bewildered and fearful, even feeling a sense\r\n\r\nof  hopelessness  with the sea change that is  taking  place.\r\n\r\nSome,  particularly the above 40s, who have found  themselves\r\n\r\nunemployed  due  to restructuring exercises  are  frustrated.\r\n\r\nWhat  use is a reduction in income tax as they are now unable\r\n\r\nto earn any income?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, those who remain employed are now\r\n\r\nworried  about how any change in the CPF system would  affect\r\n\r\nthem.   Many are also feeling indignant that the proposal  to\r\n\r\ncut  employer's  CPF  contribution  for  those  above  40   - supposedly the prime years of a person's working life - is an\r\n\r\nindictment of their economic worth.  Some are also  concerned\r\n\r\nthat  they may become redundant soon and lose their jobs.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore would like to urge the Government to continue to be\r\n\r\nsensitive  to  the many Singaporeans, including professionals\r\n\r\nand  other white-collar workers, who may feel left behind and\r\n\r\nhopeless  as  a  result of the many changes  that  are  being\r\n\r\nimplemented or considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am relieved, for instance, that the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  has  taken pains to mention in his Budget  Statement\r\n\r\nthat  the  issues related to the CPF contribution  for  older\r\n\r\nworkers  and  allocation  amongst  the  different  uses   are\r\n\r\nrecognised  to  be  complex and sensitive.   He  has  assured\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  that  any change will be done  very  carefully,\r\n\r\nafter full consultations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  without causing disruptions either to CPF members or the\r\n\r\nproperty market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would therefore like to urge the Government to\r\n\r\ncommit sufficient resources to consult and educate the public\r\n\r\nand carefully consider the possible impact on individuals and\r\n\r\nthe   economy  before  slaughtering  any  scared  cow.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment must avoid the temptation of finding \"quick fixes\"\r\n\r\nfor  problems which touch on the very fabric of  society,  as\r\n\r\njust  like  surgery, a botched operation  could,  instead  of\r\n\r\ncuring the sickness, cause even more harm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, I would also like to join the\r\n\r\nchoruses  of  my female parliamentarians here  regarding  the\r\n\r\nmedical  benefit  for  female civil servants.   Sir,  I  must\r\n\r\nprofess and say that I have a vested interest because if  you\r\n\r\nare  a male MP, you are entitled to medical benefits for your\r\n\r\ndependants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> No more!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> No more. I am sorry. Then I do\r\n\r\nnot  have  a  vested interest.  I am pleading for the  female\r\n\r\ncivil servants whom I think deserve our plea.  In addition to\r\n\r\nthe  fact that they work full time and work as hard as  their\r\n\r\nmale counterparts, they also have to take on many other roles\r\n\r\nas a wife and as a mother in many instances.  So I would also\r\n\r\nlike to join the plea of my female parliamentarians that  the\r\n\r\nreasons  for  not  giving  medical benefit  to  female  civil\r\n\r\nservants are getting murkier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2002 spells a brave new vision for the future\r\n\r\nSingapore economy and takes the first few steps forward.  The\r\n\r\nmarathon,  or  more accurately the \"ironman race\",  has  also\r\n\r\njust begun.  There is still a long distance to cover and many\r\n\r\nobstacles to overcome.  The Government has clearly shown  its\r\n\r\nresolve   and   set  the  tone  for  change,  including   the\r\n\r\nwillingness  to  slaughter what were  previously  thought  as\r\n\r\nscared  cows in the tax system, such as the Group Tax Relief.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, more scared cows may have to be slaughtered, whilst\r\n\r\nsome others may have to be given\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  strong  dose  of  medicine when the ERC and  the  Remaking\r\n\r\nSingapore Committee submit their recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, to restructure Singapore, so that it is able to\r\n\r\ncompete  effectively in the major league,  truly  requires  a\r\n\r\nmindset  change  and  cooperation of  all  players  including\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  Government and society.  Many other issues  have\r\n\r\nto  be grappled with and carefully considered.  These include\r\n\r\nCPF  issues, portable medical and retrenchment benefits, dual\r\n\r\ncitizenship   and  changing  attitudes  about   success   and\r\n\r\neducation.  The task to remake Singapore thus has  only  just\r\n\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, thank you for allowing me to speak in this debate on the\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement.  After a series of speeches  by  my  three\r\n\r\nfemale  colleagues,  I hope the House  will  welcome  a  male\r\n\r\nvoice.   My speech would not be long.  I will take  about  10\r\n\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gist of my good friend and fellow parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Mr Arthur Fong's speech is that, in a new  world,\r\n\r\nwe  are  living  with  new and sometimes tougher  challenges.\r\n\r\nHence,  we need a newer and stronger plane to fly us  through\r\n\r\nthe turbulence we are experiencing now and, more importantly,\r\n\r\nto  last  the  longer journey ahead.  Mr Fong's speech  is  a\r\n\r\ndirect  reference  to the title of Finance Minister's  Budget\r\n\r\nSpeech \"A Budget for a Different World\".  This Budget  is  an\r\n\r\naberration  in more ways than one.  It is indeed a  different\r\n\r\nworld we are living in.  For starters, we are experiencing  a\r\n\r\nhitherto high unemployment.  The experts in this field called\r\n\r\nthis structural unemployment.  But, Sir, call it by any other\r\n\r\nname,  to the tens of thousands of unemployed, for months  on\r\n\r\nend now, it is just as painful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two points I would like to highlight with regard\r\n\r\nto  this  Budget.  Firstly, the changes to our tax  structure\r\n\r\nintroduced in this Budget.  When I was in university, I  read\r\n\r\nwith great interest that Singapore's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbrand  of  politics  can  be  best described  as  \"democratic\r\n\r\nsocialism\".   Hence,  whenever I discuss Singapore's  success\r\n\r\nwith  foreign  counterparts,  I  feel  very  proud  to  be  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean.  I am very proud to say that the PAP  Government\r\n\r\nhad  benefited the whole population.  Our people's lives  had\r\n\r\ngotten richer over the years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Government's policies had always been crafted\r\n\r\nto  benefit  the  people on a bottom  up  the  social  strata\r\n\r\napproach.   For  instance,  we allocated  a  huge  amount  of\r\n\r\nresources  to the building of public housing and the  success\r\n\r\nof  HDB  had ensured 90% of Singaporeans having a  roof  over\r\n\r\ntheir heads.  We build schools with universal access to allow\r\n\r\nall  our citizens, regardless of race, language, religion and\r\n\r\nsocial class, the benefits of education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our system of rewards is based on meritocracy and it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  matter who your father or mother is.   It  matters\r\n\r\nequally  less what race and social class you belong to.   For\r\n\r\nthat,  Sir, I am very proud to be a Singaporean.  And because\r\n\r\nI  am  proud to be a Singaporean and being also a  Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament, I feel that I would not be doing my duty if I  do\r\n\r\nnot echo the concerns of my fellow citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some wise alecks have labelled this Budget as a\r\n\r\n\"Reverse   Robin   Hood\".   This  view,   unfortunately,   is\r\n\r\nreverberating in many quarters of Singapore.  They  refer  to\r\n\r\nthe changes in the tax structure.  In particular, many are of\r\n\r\nthe  opinion that  lowering personal income tax and corporate\r\n\r\ntax  will benefit only a small pool of the population.  Since\r\n\r\nabout 70% of Singaporeans do not pay personal income tax, the\r\n\r\nreduction in personal income tax does not benefit them.   The\r\n\r\nincrease  in  GST, notwithstanding the offset  package,  they\r\n\r\nargue, will hit them directly.  The GST is indirect in nature\r\n\r\nand  is  consumption based; it is the 70% who would be  taxed\r\n\r\nmost.  Hence, the wise alecks argue that the shortfall in tax\r\n\r\nrevenue  collected as a result of the reduction  of  personal\r\n\r\nincome  tax  amounting to $1.3 billion is net  off  with  the\r\n\r\namount of $1.32 billion collected\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom GST.  Is this really reverse Robin Hood?  Is this really\r\n\r\nthe  Government  taking from the poor and,  in  the  process,\r\n\r\nbenefiting  the rich only and, in the midst of  it,  widening\r\n\r\nthe  income  gap, as mentioned earlier on by my parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Ms Irene Ng?  If this is so, we have shifted  our\r\n\r\nfocus  in our policy.  If not, I rather believe that we  have\r\n\r\nnot.  How did this perception creep up, and is germinating?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me state here that I do not fully agree with\r\n\r\nthe  views represented by the general public.  The perception\r\n\r\nhowever  is  very real on the ground.  Do we  put  our  heads\r\n\r\nabove  the cloud level ignoring the rumblings on the  ground,\r\n\r\nstubbornly believing in the superiority of our views?  I feel\r\n\r\nthe changes introduced are significantly profound.  The shift\r\n\r\nfrom direct to indirect taxation calls for greater individual\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  I feel that this is a fundamental change and\r\n\r\nthe   citizenry  should  be  given  more  time   to   prepare\r\n\r\nthemselves.  As a doctor, I have come across enough cases  to\r\n\r\ncome to the conclusion that individual responsibility is  not\r\n\r\nvery reliable.  Many times, I have made the correct diagnosis\r\n\r\nand prescribed the right medicine for the full recovery of my\r\n\r\npatients.   Yet, I see many repeat cases simply because  they\r\n\r\ndo  not  take  their  medicine.   The  increase  reliance  on\r\n\r\nconsumption-based  tax system might be a step  in  the  right\r\n\r\ndirection.  Many feel that this is a major change, yet  there\r\n\r\nis not enough consultation and deliberation.  Herein, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  lies  the  problem.   Our population  is  getting  more\r\n\r\neducated and informed.  They would like to be informed of big\r\n\r\nchanges, preferably well beforehand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is the objective to allow me to quote\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  Lee Hsien Loong, \"bring to  Singapore  the\r\n\r\neconomic  activities  that  will  provide  Singaporeans  with\r\n\r\njobs\".   Sir, I have no quarrels with that stated  objective,\r\n\r\nexcept the point of using lower corporate and personal income\r\n\r\ntax  to  attract foreign direct investment to  Singapore.   I\r\n\r\nfeel that the concomitant reduction of corporate tax and  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  GST  have,  in total,  a  negative  bias.   The\r\n\r\nattractiveness to foreign companies of the reduction in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncorporate tax is very much negated by the increase in GST.  I\r\n\r\nam  not  a businessman, but I do not think you need to  be  a\r\n\r\nsavvy  businessman to work this out.  When a company  invests\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, the reduction in corporate tax is good to them\r\n\r\nonly if they are profitable.  But when a foreign company sets\r\n\r\nup  shop  in Singapore, they pay the GST upfront,  even  when\r\n\r\nthey  are still starting to set up the shop.  Moreover,  they\r\n\r\nmight not have benefited from the reduction in corporate  tax\r\n\r\nif their business is not profitable, while they still have to\r\n\r\npay indirect tax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am highlighting these feedback so that we may\r\n\r\nhave,  to quote Mr Arthur Fong again, a better plane  with  a\r\n\r\nstronger jet engine to take us higher and faster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih (Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Matthias Yao Chih):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support\r\n\r\nthe motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 1960s, a Dutch bus company wanted to find a\r\n\r\nmore   scientific   way  of  recruiting  bus   drivers.    It\r\n\r\ncommissioned  a  study on what makes  a  bus  driver  a  good\r\n\r\ndriver.   At  first, most people thought that the  key  trait\r\n\r\nshould be quick reaction and sharp reflexes.  Well, that  was\r\n\r\nnot so.  As it turned out, the study showed that the best bus\r\n\r\ndrivers   were  the  ones  who  could  anticipate  the   road\r\n\r\nconditions  early and adjust their driving well  before  they\r\n\r\nentered the curves or the bumpy stretches on the road.   That\r\n\r\nmakes  a  lot  of sense.  A bus driver is not  a  racing  car\r\n\r\ndriver.   If  he drives the bus like a Formula One  car,  the\r\n\r\npassengers  will have a scary and sometimes disastrous  ride.\r\n\r\nA  good  bus driver is one who brings his passengers speedily\r\n\r\nbut  safely on their journey, while giving them as  smooth  a\r\n\r\nride as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In managing the economy, the Government must drive it\r\n\r\nlike  a  bus, not like a racing car.  That means anticipating\r\n\r\nthe  problems that may come well in advance, and making small\r\n\r\nadjustments  before the problems hit us so that they  do  not\r\n\r\nbecome a crisis.  This Budget is one such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmove.   It  anticipates the tough economic  competition  that\r\n\r\nlies ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, investors would set up companies where the\r\n\r\nmarkets  were.  This was because transport was expensive  and\r\n\r\ncommunication  was slow.  The businessmen and  the  factories\r\n\r\nhad  to be close to where the buyers were, to lower the  cost\r\n\r\nof  delivery and shorten the reaction time to changing market\r\n\r\nconditions.  Investments had to be spread over many countries\r\n\r\nto  be  close  to  the customers in every region.   Singapore\r\n\r\nbenefited by being the gateway into South East Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, transport is cheap and communication is fast. It\r\n\r\ndoes not cost much more to ship an item 5,000 km than 500 km.\r\n\r\nBusinessmen  can  be  in touch with the developments  in  any\r\n\r\nmajor  market by cable television and Internet  even  as  the\r\n\r\nevents  unfold.   They can give instructions  by  e-mail  and\r\n\r\ntelephone  direct to the recipients almost  anywhere  in  the\r\n\r\nworld in an instant.  Investors no longer need to spread  out\r\n\r\ntheir plants and offices to be close to their markets.   They\r\n\r\nare more concerned over where they can get the best value for\r\n\r\ntheir dollar.  And they can concentrate their investments  in\r\n\r\na  few  locations  around the world  to  derive  the  highest\r\n\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, there are many more new places that are\r\n\r\nattractive  for them to invest in.  The end of the  Cold  War\r\n\r\nopened up the whole of Eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union\r\n\r\nrepublics  to  Western  investment.   Ireland  adopted   pro-investment policies and made its economy attractive.   Mexico\r\n\r\njoined  NAFTA  and  became an important supplier  to  the  US\r\n\r\nmarket.   China  entered the WTO and will  be  the  focus  of\r\n\r\ninvestor attention for many years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The competition for investments is no longer regional,\r\n\r\nbut  global.   It is so much keener than just 15  years  ago.\r\n\r\nThe  world  does not, and will not, stay still  for  us.   To\r\n\r\nattract investments, we must watch what others are doing  and\r\n\r\ntake the necessary steps to stay ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax changes are an important step in the right\r\n\r\ndirection.  But in our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiscussions  with union leaders in NTUC, one question  stands\r\n\r\nout  and this is the same as the one raised by Dr Chong  Weng\r\n\r\nChiew  a moment ago.  This Government has always been a Robin\r\n\r\nHood government, ie, it takes from the rich and gives to  the\r\n\r\npoor.   So, why is it that this time the Government is taking\r\n\r\nfrom  the  poor  by raising GST and giving  to  the  rich  by\r\n\r\nlowering their income tax?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is taking nothing from the poor.\r\n\r\nThe  GST is fully offset for lower income Singaporeans for  5\r\n\r\nyears  or  longer,  by  which time the  economy  should  have\r\n\r\nrecovered  sufficiently for wages to rise again.   But,  more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  if Robin Hood wants to rob the rich,  the  rich\r\n\r\nmust be there for him to rob.  I regret to report, Sir, Robin\r\n\r\nHood  cannot  rob  the  Sheriff of Nottingham  anymore.   The\r\n\r\nSheriff  has  relocated  to Hong Kong  because  of  the  more\r\n\r\nconducive environment there.  And I heard that he is thinking\r\n\r\nseriously about moving on to China next year!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that this Government will always be a Robin\r\n\r\nHood  at heart.  But to be always able to take something from\r\n\r\nthe  high-income individuals and companies  to  give  to  the\r\n\r\nlower-income, they must want to remain here to work and to do\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  the first place.  We must do  what  we  can  to\r\n\r\nencourage  them to come here and stay here, so  that  we  can\r\n\r\ncollect  a  little  bit of income tax  from  them  and,  more\r\n\r\nimportantly, so that they can create good jobs for  us.   The\r\n\r\ntax changes will be effective in achieving this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Economist Intelligence Unit rated\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  have  the best business environment  in  Asia,\r\n\r\novertaking Hong Kong for the first time, and the tax  changes\r\n\r\nwere cited as a key factor.  Singaporeans should view the new\r\n\r\ntax  structure positively.  It will help our economy to  grow\r\n\r\nin the long run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another change that is being discussed is the CPF\r\n\r\nsystem.  Sir, the public discussions are getting Singaporeans\r\n\r\nworried.  They wonder how much of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontributions will be cut, and what new restrictions will  be\r\n\r\nput in place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge Singaporeans to take a calm approach to this\r\n\r\ndiscussion.   The time has come for us to take a  re-look  at\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  system.   As the population ages  and  as  we  live\r\n\r\nlonger, our retirement income will become an important issue.\r\n\r\nThe   projections  suggest  that  at  current   rates,   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will not have enough savings to retire on.  This\r\n\r\nneeds  to  be corrected before it is too late.  The  question\r\n\r\nis:  what should we do?  In making the review, I suggest that\r\n\r\nwe observe four working rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, focus firmly on the fundamental objectives of CPF\r\n\r\nsavings,   which  are  to  provide  for  retirement   income,\r\n\r\nhealthcare  and housing.  We need to make adequate provisions\r\n\r\nfor  each  of  these  needs and find  the  right  balance  of\r\n\r\nallocation  among them.  Everything else should be secondary.\r\n\r\nWe  should  not eye CPF funds for other uses.  We should  not\r\n\r\nuse CPF as a macro-economic instrument to influence the money\r\n\r\nsupply   or  disposable  income.   We  should  make  a   firm\r\n\r\ncommitment never to dilute its basic aims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, workers should have enough CPF savings but they\r\n\r\nmust  not be priced out of a job because of CPF.  Because  of\r\n\r\nour  seniority-based wage system, employers  prefer  to  hire\r\n\r\nyounger  workers  compared to older ones.   Since  the  Asian\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis  in 1998, we have seen  many  instances  of\r\n\r\nolder  workers  not  being able to secure another  job  after\r\n\r\nretrenchment.  If the CPF system needs to be adjusted to help\r\n\r\nolder  workers  find  and  keep  jobs,  we  should  study  it\r\n\r\nseriously.  Remember that without a job, there is no  CPF  to\r\n\r\ntalk about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, while we may suggest ideal new systems to replace\r\n\r\nthe  current one, many Singaporeans are already locked in  by\r\n\r\nthe  present  system and practices.  Knowing what  the  ideal\r\n\r\nsystem  should be and changing the present system to fit  the\r\n\r\nproposals are two different things.  Workers use CPF  to  pay\r\n\r\nfor  their housing and medical care.  A complete overhaul  of\r\n\r\nthe  system, or any drastic changes to the rules, will  cause\r\n\r\nhardship to ordinary workers and their families.  While we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  range freely to capture all good ideas,  we  must  be\r\n\r\nextremely careful in choosing what to implement and how to do\r\n\r\nit.   Like  a good bus driver, we must not turn a corner  too\r\n\r\nsharply  as  the  passengers will surely be flung  off  their\r\n\r\nseats if we do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, give as much time as possible for Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  make  the  adjustments.  CPF is a  huge  subject.   Every\r\n\r\nworker, every family in Singapore is affected.  We must  help\r\n\r\neveryone  understand  and  prepare  for  the  changes.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment gave almost 10 years between the original proposal\r\n\r\nfor GST and its implementation.  The Medisave system was also\r\n\r\ngiven  much time for digestion before implementation.  I  ask\r\n\r\nthe Government to make haste slowly on the CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Budget kicks off many more changes to our\r\n\r\neconomic strategies and structures.  The Government  is  open\r\n\r\nin finding new ideas and proposals.  I hope Singaporeans will\r\n\r\ntake  part in these discussions with a positive spirit.   The\r\n\r\noutcome will be a set of changes that will put our economy on\r\n\r\na firmer footing to face our challenges ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise on a\r\n\r\npoint  of  clarification.  Too many people have talked  about\r\n\r\nskinning  cats  in this House and I want to  remind  everyone\r\n\r\nhere  that  we are a civilized people.  We do not indulge  in\r\n\r\nbarbaric  acts  like that.  In fact, the Bill  to  amend  the\r\n\r\nAnimals  and Birds Act, which had its First Reading  a  month\r\n\r\nago,  provides  for increasing the fine and imprisonment  for\r\n\r\npeople  who indulge in cruelty to animals.  So I would advise\r\n\r\npeople  who persist in such barbaric acts to keep  away  from\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, since the delivery of the Budget Speech by  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lee Hsien  Loong,\r\n\r\nmany discussion sessions have been conducted, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  have  participated  in  a  number  of  them.   From  these\r\n\r\ndiscussions,  a few issues kept popping up.  Let  me  reflect\r\n\r\nfive of these issues concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget Statement, DPM Lee said our highest\r\n\r\npriority is to create good jobs for Singaporeans.  To do this\r\n\r\nwe  must continue to attract companies and talent to come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  and help our economy to grow.  This  statement  is\r\n\r\nvery  reassuring  to  the workers.  Many  workers  and  union\r\n\r\nleaders have asked how the ordinary workers will benefit from\r\n\r\nthe  tax changes.  The link between tax cuts and job creation\r\n\r\ncannot be seen immediately, but we all know that the link  is\r\n\r\nthere.   Tax cuts attract investments and investments  create\r\n\r\njobs.   This is the message that union leaders shall continue\r\n\r\nto  convey  to our workers.  Some people are sceptical  about\r\n\r\nhow  the  tax cuts work.  Let us look at a concrete  example.\r\n\r\nWithin  two weeks of the announcement by the Economic  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee  recommending cuts in corporate  tax  and  personal\r\n\r\nincome tax, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) published a\r\n\r\nsurvey  that Singapore had overtaken Hong Kong as the economy\r\n\r\noffering the best business environment in Asia.  The EIU said\r\n\r\nthat  the  proposal  to  cut taxes was  the  key  reason  why\r\n\r\nSingapore had topped the survey.  We are on the right track.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspaper reported last week that our biomedical hub\r\n\r\nwill  generate  at  least  4,000  jobs.   That  is  certainly\r\n\r\nencouraging  news but there are some questions asked  by  our\r\n\r\nworkers.  Apart from this, with the new tax regime, how  many\r\n\r\njobs can we create down the road?  What jobs are these and in\r\n\r\nwhat sectors?  How soon can we expect these jobs to come?  We\r\n\r\nhope  the  Government can give us more good  news.   Can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   give  us  some  projections?    We   know   that\r\n\r\nprojections are projections.  They are tentative.  But,  with\r\n\r\nmore accurate projections we will able to guide and encourage\r\n\r\npeople  to  upgrade their skills in the relevant fields,  and\r\n\r\nhave  better  chances  of  getting better  jobs  in  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reducing corporate tax does not mean reducing corporate\r\n\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, the reduction in corporate tax  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  be  welcomed by the business community.   It  will\r\n\r\nalleviate  the tax burden on the companies and improve  their\r\n\r\nbottom-line.   As  a labour MP I urge the companies  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of the tax changes by taking more risks and seeking\r\n\r\nnew markets so that their business can grow and more jobs can\r\n\r\nbe created for workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They should also realise that reduction in corporate tax\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mean reduction in corporate responsibility.   What\r\n\r\nare  these responsibilities?  Let me broadly highlight  three\r\n\r\nmessages   to   the  business.   First,  treat   workers   as\r\n\r\nstakeholders.  From time to time we hear of horror stories  - employers    retrenching   workers   without    compensation,\r\n\r\nretrenchments disguised as dismissals or terminations to save\r\n\r\non  retrenchment benefits.  Such cases, if proven to be true,\r\n\r\nmust  be  deplored.   Companies have an obligation  to  their\r\n\r\nshareholders  to  improve on their returns.   But  they  must\r\n\r\nacknowledge that there are other stakeholders too, and  these\r\n\r\ninclude  the  workers too.  With improved earnings  resulting\r\n\r\nfrom lower corporate tax,  I urge companies to invest more on\r\n\r\nworkers'  training and spend more to enhance  their  welfare.\r\n\r\nDo not forget that all members of the staff are entitled to a\r\n\r\nshare in the fruit of the company's success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, responsibility towards customers. I have been\r\n\r\ninvolved  with CASE for two years and I have personally  come\r\n\r\nacross   many  cases  of  business  malpractice.   A   common\r\n\r\ncomplaint is a lack of transparency.  Consumers are often not\r\n\r\nwell-informed of price change or they are caught by the  fine\r\n\r\nprint.  I believe that the business approach can be a win-win\r\n\r\nsituation.   There  can  be improvements  to  their  earnings\r\n\r\nwithout  compromising the interest of  their  customers.   In\r\n\r\ntoday's  newspapers,  it is reported that  the  DBS  Bank  is\r\n\r\nmaking  their credit card terms reader-friendly.  That  is  a\r\n\r\ngood example.  Other companies should do likewise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, responsibility towards the community. A\r\n\r\ncompany cannot be completely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nisolated  from  the  public  and  the  community  at   large.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, companies that are performing well can channel  part\r\n\r\nof  their  improved  earnings  to  community  and  charitable\r\n\r\nprojects.   Such an act of charity will send a strong  signal\r\n\r\nthat  it is sharing its successes with the community and that\r\n\r\nit is a good corporate citizen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government has introduced a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  package to offset the impact of  the  proposed\r\n\r\nGST  increase.   In particular, I am glad that  DPM  Lee  has\r\n\r\ngiven  a  strong reassurance that low-income households  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  worse  off.   I want to highlight three  GST-related\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I urge the Government to monitor the impact of\r\n\r\nthe GST when it is implemented next year to make sure that it\r\n\r\nwill  not  lead  to  inflation.   Secondly,  I  commend   the\r\n\r\nGovernment for making much efforts to explain the reasons  of\r\n\r\nthe  tax  changes.   I  am impressed by  three  things:   the\r\n\r\nbrochures  in  different  languages  to  reach  out  to   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, the use of cartoons to convey the key  messages\r\n\r\nand  the  on-line calculator which Singaporeans  can  use  to\r\n\r\ncompute  how  much   benefit they can  get  from  the  offset\r\n\r\npackage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Government can do more to dispel common\r\n\r\nmisconceptions such as:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) GST is compounded and the end-customer pays more\r\n\r\nthan 5%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Increased GST will discourage consumers from\r\n\r\nspending   and   the  retail  sector  will  be   hurt.   More\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will  shop in neighbouring  countries  and  our\r\n\r\nneighbours will benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our part, as a labour movement, the NTUC News\r\n\r\npublished an article last week using the example of  a  shirt\r\n\r\nto  illustrate that GST is not compounded and would not  lead\r\n\r\nto   price  increase.   The  Government  can  consider  doing\r\n\r\nlikewise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, are there any particular group of people who\r\n\r\nare  not  adequately covered by the GST offset package?   All\r\n\r\nalong, the Government has been using examples of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntypical families to illustrate the extent of GST package. How\r\n\r\nabout those single-parent families or retirees who are living\r\n\r\nalone?  Could we do more to help them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the Budget speech, DPM Lee\r\n\r\nsaid  that Government expenditure in the economic development\r\n\r\nsector  would continue to emphasise on workers' training  and\r\n\r\nupgrading.  He stressed that the Government would  not  stint\r\n\r\nin  its  support for workers to upgrade themselves.  This  is\r\n\r\nvery  important.  Our efforts to train workers must keep pace\r\n\r\nwith  economic  restructuring.  It is time for  our  training\r\n\r\ndrive  to go into turbo charge.  We have all along relied  on\r\n\r\nincentives  and  subsidies.  But if these  incentives  cannot\r\n\r\nachieve  the  desired result, should we not push workers  and\r\n\r\nemployers  harder?   Workers  are  increasingly  seeing   the\r\n\r\nimportance of training but can we do more to get employers to\r\n\r\ncome  on  board?   Can Government identify  certain  specific\r\n\r\nindustries  and  areas to channel our training  efforts?   We\r\n\r\nknow generally where the growth areas are, such as biomedical\r\n\r\nand  ship building.  If more specific industries and  numbers\r\n\r\ncan  be  provided,  we will have clearer objectives  to  move\r\n\r\ntowards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the world has changed and\r\n\r\nchanged  rapidly.  International competition is getting  more\r\n\r\nintense.   The future challenges are getting more severe  and\r\n\r\nthe  current times are unsettling.  What are the main  causes\r\n\r\nof  uncertainty?  I can identify three sources of discomfort.\r\n\r\nThe  first  source is employment-related issues.   There  are\r\n\r\ndiscussions on employability of older workers and changes  in\r\n\r\nthe CPF can be disenchanting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second source of worry is the uncertain external\r\n\r\nenvironment,  particularly the competition we face  from  our\r\n\r\nneighbours and the unresolved issues we have with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third source is the likelihood of lifestyle changes\r\n\r\nthat  we  may  have to make. Can we continue to maintain  our\r\n\r\nhigh  standard  of living as we used to enjoy?   In  such  an\r\n\r\r\nuncertain environment, it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant  for  the  Government to give our  people  a  clear\r\n\r\nreassurance, just like what DPM Lee has done when he gave the\r\n\r\nassurances  that the Government's top priority is  to  create\r\n\r\njobs  and the low-income families will not be worse off after\r\n\r\nthe GST increase.  We have to continue to reassure them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, after MediaCorp actor, Pierre\r\n\r\nPng gave part of his liver to Andrea De Cruz, I was told that\r\n\r\nmany  wives  and  girlfriends had been asking their  partners\r\n\r\nwhether  they  would do the same thing if  the  same  tragedy\r\n\r\nhappens  to them.  The New Paper reported yesterday  that  it\r\n\r\nasked  50 single Singaporeans whether they would donate their\r\n\r\norgans  to  their  partners and 33 said,  \"Yes!\".   Unmarried\r\n\r\npartners  may be able to say no, but for husbands,  there  is\r\n\r\nonly  one correct answer to your wives - \"Yes!\".  This answer\r\n\r\nalone  is a reassurance of  love for your better half, and  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  that it is something that many wives would want  to\r\n\r\nhear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our Government does not have any liver to\r\n\r\ndonate,  I am sure  it has a big caring heart. The Government\r\n\r\nshould  reaffirm and say to its citizens that  \"we  have  the\r\n\r\ninterest of all Singaporeans at heart and we will continue to\r\n\r\nenhance  the  social  safety  net\".   Such  a  statement  and\r\n\r\ncommitment would be a reassurance that Government  cares  and\r\n\r\nno  matter  how  many times it has been said, no  matter  how\r\n\r\ndifficult our circumstances, we will make sure that our heart\r\n\r\nis  always warm, and the people will not be tired of  hearing\r\n\r\nit.   I hope that the Government will make such assurance  of\r\n\r\nlove,  especially when we have to face the challenges  ahead,\r\n\r\nwe  must  have  a  government with the people's  benefits  at\r\n\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, to restructure the economy, Singapore obviously\r\n\r\nneeds  to  have a more equitable direct and indirect taxation\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget goes someway to address this issue and the\r\n\r\nDPM and Minister for Finance has been, and should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplauded for providing a comprehensive analysis of  how  the\r\n\r\ntax  structure should be revised.  I generally agree with the\r\n\r\nBudget.   I  only  have  a few points to  make,  mainly  from\r\n\r\nfeedback  received,  I realise that Members  before  me  have\r\n\r\nraised some of the points already, so I shall attempt  to  be\r\n\r\nbrief.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the comment is that: is this the right time to\r\n\r\nintroduce  the restructuring?  Some see the restructuring  of\r\n\r\ncourse  as leading to a more equitable system.  However,  for\r\n\r\nthe  majority of Singaporeans who do not pay income tax, they\r\n\r\nonly  see the increase in indirect taxes as making them  even\r\n\r\npoorer  and the reduction in direct taxes as benefiting  only\r\n\r\nthe  better off.  Must the changes therefore come at  a  time\r\n\r\nwhen  almost  everyone is facing economic  problems  such  as\r\n\r\nunemployment, retrenchment, pay reduction or pay freezes?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, following from that, has the Budget adequately\r\n\r\naddressed the high cost for individuals and businesses?   For\r\n\r\nthe  individual,  the  tax  burden  will  increase  with  the\r\n\r\nincrease  of  GST  next  year.   The  increase  in  GST  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely bring higher bills for essentials, such  as  food,\r\n\r\nutilities  and transport. We can only hope that the  increase\r\n\r\nin  GST  will  not result also in a reduction in consumption,\r\n\r\nwhich will always affect our economic recovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly worried for those who are still\r\n\r\nunemployed.  As it is, I believe all in this House have  seen\r\n\r\nthe hardship faced by many jobless.  Even at today's prices - mountains of bills to pay - many have had their power  supply\r\n\r\ncut  off at one time or another, many could not afford to pay\r\n\r\nfor  even the basic necessities, and there seems to be no end\r\n\r\nin sight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many families have been affected. So the question is:\r\n\r\nwill  the  offset  package be enough?  All  in  all,  is  the\r\n\r\nMinister  confident that the offset for GST  has  taken  into\r\n\r\naccount, for example, the potential increases that are likely\r\n\r\nto be brought\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  by  increases in fuel cost?  Can we expect  more  off-Budget  measures to tackle the problems that the increase  in\r\n\r\nconsumption  taxes would bring?  The Minister  has  mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  where the offsets are not enough to cover the  increase\r\n\r\nin  GST, such families could appeal to the CCCs.  Sir,  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  that if the current trend in unemployment  continues,\r\n\r\nthe  CCCs  will be snowed under with this burden and  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat sufficient resources for this purpose will come from the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also disappointed that while we recognise that in\r\n\r\nSingapore, we have an increasing number of older workers,  we\r\n\r\nseem  not to have provided sufficient incentives to encourage\r\n\r\ncompanies   to   retain  or  re-employ  them.    Even   small\r\n\r\nindustries,  such  as the garment industry,  are  outsourcing\r\n\r\ntheir  work  to neighbouring countries where labour  is  much\r\n\r\ncheaper.   There  is no incentive for them to employ  workers\r\n\r\nhere even when such workers are available, ready and willing.\r\n\r\nMany of them have come to tell us, \"give us some work and  we\r\n\r\nwill  prove  ourselves\".  Should we not consider some  fiscal\r\n\r\nincentives  to  encourage  companies  to  employ  Singaporean\r\n\r\nworkers  even  in  those non high-tech industries  so  as  to\r\n\r\nabsorb this growing group of workers who are in their mid-40s\r\n\r\nor  50s?   We need fiscal measures to encourage companies  to\r\n\r\nemploy   these  older  workers,  preferably  without  adverse\r\n\r\nconsequences to their CPF.  I believe that the over-40s still\r\n\r\nneed their CPF, even though they may not have as much to  pay\r\n\r\noff as the younger ones, but they would still need to provide\r\n\r\nfor their retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, is the Budget helpful to small businesses?\r\n\r\nAnother  growing  perception is  that  this  Budget  did  not\r\n\r\nprovide  much  good news for the small businessmen  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  facing the twin mishaps of poor business and increasing\r\n\r\ncost.  There is every probability that with fuel prices going\r\n\r\nup, business cost will increase.  The small businesses in the\r\n\r\nsectors,  such  as manufacturing, retailing or  non-financial\r\n\r\nservices,  see no great tangible benefits from  this  Budget.\r\n\r\nMany of the companies are striving to stay afloat, so a cut\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  corporate taxation, as many of my colleagues had  earlier\r\n\r\nmentioned, is irrelevant because they have no profits to  pay\r\n\r\ntax on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, they face increasing competition with\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries and if costs in Singapore rise all the\r\n\r\ntime,  the  degree  of  competitiveness must  correspondingly\r\n\r\nreduce.   One example I have been told about is that  freight\r\n\r\ncosts, for instance, have already risen by 10% recently,  and\r\n\r\nGST has not been increased yet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those in the retail business, we have also been\r\n\r\ntelling  Singaporeans to shop in Singapore and support  them.\r\n\r\nBut,  in reality, can we blame Singaporeans from going across\r\n\r\nthe  Causeway if the Singapore dollar stretches much  further\r\n\r\nthan  it  does  here?   So,  all in  all,  small  businesses,\r\n\r\nparticularly those in the retail trade, see that  the  Budget\r\n\r\ndoes not really help them that much.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, from the consumers' point of view and from the\r\n\r\nHDB residents' point of view, many have made the comment that\r\n\r\nthis Budget is a give-and-take budget.  What is given by  one\r\n\r\nhand  is taken away by the other.  And the illustration  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  of this is the way in which we have been  adjusting\r\n\r\ntaxes on cars.  True, of course, there are reductions in  the\r\n\r\nARF,  road taxes and other direct taxes, but these reductions\r\n\r\nare  unlikely to be felt, with the increase in petrol prices,\r\n\r\nCOE, ERP and HDB car park fees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, car owners are already paying substantial\r\n\r\ntaxes to buy a car and maintain them.  And the taxes that are\r\n\r\ncollected  amount to billions of dollars.  Also, if  we  just\r\n\r\nlook  at the additional 5,000 COEs to be issued, and if  each\r\n\r\nCOE  is  worth  about $30,000, it would generate  about  $150\r\n\r\nmillion.   One suggestion is that Government should use  this\r\n\r\nrevenue to offset some of these increases in the building and\r\n\r\nmaintenance of car parks until such time as the economy picks\r\n\r\nup.  So, will the Government consider postponing the rise  in\r\n\r\ncar  park charges till a later date when the economy is in  a\r\n\r\nmore robust condition?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I have to confess that I withdrew my\r\n\r\nwish  list  after listening to the one proposed by  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember for Ang Mo Kio, Mr Inderjit Singh.  My wishes pale  by\r\n\r\ncomparison,  and I do not think that I can come up  with  the\r\n\r\nbold  ones  that  he had proposed.  But in listening  to  the\r\n\r\nfemale  colleagues of this House, I cannot  but  find  myself\r\n\r\ncompelled to support the call to review medical benefits  for\r\n\r\nfemale  civil  servants.  And I hope they will not  think  it\r\n\r\npresumptuous of me to do so and would welcome support,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure, from their male counterparts as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that in mind, Sir, may I say that although this\r\n\r\nBudget  presented so well by the DPM and Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nshould  also  perhaps pay attention to those individuals  and\r\n\r\nbusinessmen that remain mired in the throes of the recession.\r\n\r\nLet  us  hope  that these concerns will be addressed  at  the\r\n\r\nearliest opportunity should the need arise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Budget, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, for allowing me to participate in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say, at the outset, that I thought that\r\n\r\nthe presentation of the Budget by the Finance Minister was an\r\n\r\nextremely good presentation, and that it is a Budget which is\r\n\r\ndeserving of praise.  I do not think it is necessary  for  me\r\n\r\nto highlight all the good points about it, because so many of\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues in this Chamber have done so before  me.   So,\r\n\r\nwhat  I intend to do is just to raise three areas in which  I\r\n\r\nhave specific comments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is, of course, my concern that it does not\r\n\r\nsufficiently address the needs of the SMEs.  For that, I  had\r\n\r\nprepared  a  segment, but here I want to  thank  Mr  Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh  for  saying some of the things which I had  considered\r\n\r\nand  many  more things which I had not, and I would  like  to\r\n\r\nendorse what he has said and fully support that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is on the GST offset. I understand the\r\n\r\nneed for the offset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  financial  policy is not  like  Newton's  law  of\r\n\r\ngravity.  It is not a situation where what goes up must  come\r\n\r\ndown.   When  you are trying to balance a budget, clearly  if\r\n\r\nsomething comes down, something else must go up, and I  think\r\n\r\nwe  fully understand the need for it.  The only thing  though\r\n\r\nabout  the  GST offset is that it is, in its very  nature,  a\r\n\r\nshort-term  solution.  It does not address the problem  which\r\n\r\nis  really  the  employability of older  workers,  especially\r\n\r\nthose  who have a lower level of education.  I have heard  it\r\n\r\nsaid  in  this House that, ultimately, we hope that with  the\r\n\r\nrestructuring  and with the financial and fiscal  incentives,\r\n\r\nin  due  course, the economy will recover and there  will  be\r\n\r\njobs.  This is true, but the way we are trying to restructure\r\n\r\nour  economy  is to attract the high value-added  industries.\r\n\r\nAnd for the older workers with lower levels of education,  it\r\n\r\nwill   still  be  extremely  difficult  for  them   to   find\r\n\r\nemployment.   So,  as  far  as  this  segment  of  people  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  the  GST  offset is a  short-term  solution  but,\r\n\r\nultimately, we have to find a way to make them employable and\r\n\r\nkeep  them  employable.  In that respect,  I  was  encouraged\r\n\r\nsomewhat by hearing the Minister for Manpower talk about  the\r\n\r\nskills  upgrading programme and the amount of money  that  we\r\n\r\nspend  on that.  This is something which I think needs to  be\r\n\r\ntaken further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing, of course, is to change the employers'\r\n\r\nmindsets.  I am not sure that subsidies alone will  do  that,\r\n\r\nbut it is a mindset change that employers have to go through.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to identify certain types of industries where\r\n\r\nthese older workers would be more suitable to participate in.\r\n\r\nBut,  clearly, we have to do something in that regard.   That\r\n\r\nwas my second point on GST offset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is on the falling birth rates. Financial\r\n\r\npolicy  is wonderful if we are planning to build the economy,\r\n\r\nwe  are  planning  for the future.  Of  course,  if  we  have\r\n\r\nfalling birth rates, there may not be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans left by that time to enjoy the  fruits  of\r\n\r\nwhat we are planning now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had noticed that in the Budget Statement, no specific\r\n\r\nthings  were put in the Budget to address this concern.   The\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, at the opening of Parliament, had very kindly\r\n\r\nresponded  to  my plea for housing for singles  and,  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of addressing that, he said that the greater  problem\r\n\r\nwas the falling birth rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our birth rate in 1988 was 1.96. It has been on the\r\n\r\ndownward trend since then.  In 1999, it was 1.48; in 2000, it\r\n\r\nwas  1.59; and in 2001, it was an all-time low of 1.42.   And\r\n\r\nwe have to ask ourselves why this is the case.  Partly, it is\r\n\r\na  personal  decision.  But, partly, I think  it  is  also  a\r\n\r\nresult of the somewhat incoherent policy that we have had  in\r\n\r\ntrying  to  encourage the birth rates to go up,  and  I  will\r\n\r\nexplain exactly why I say our policy has been incoherent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two groups of people we have to look at when\r\n\r\nwe  are looking at falling birth rates.  One is the group  of\r\n\r\npeople  who  choose not to get married at  all.   The  second\r\n\r\ngroup  is  those  who  are married but  choose  not  to  have\r\n\r\nchildren.  And we must never confuse the two groups,  because\r\n\r\ntheir reasons are quite different.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take the second group first, which is married\r\n\r\ncouples.   When dealing with married couples and  encouraging\r\n\r\nthem  to  have children, the problem with our policy is  that\r\n\r\nthe  measures  so  far  have  been essentially  financial  or\r\n\r\nfiscal.   We  have treated what is, by its nature,  a  social\r\n\r\nproblem as if it is an economic one, and that is why we  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  successful.  Because Singapore, as a  country,  is\r\n\r\nexcellent  at  economic policy.  We are very good  at  fiscal\r\n\r\nmeasures.  And over the years, we have restructured, managed,\r\n\r\nboosted,   designed,  tweaked,  pruned  our   economy   using\r\n\r\nfinancial and tax incentives.  We have pioneer tax status, we\r\n\r\nhave  ERP,  we  have car ownership, and somewhere  along  the\r\n\r\nline,  we  have  come  to believe that Singaporeans  have  an\r\n\r\nalmost pavlovian response to cash stimuli.  We put a monetary\r\n\r\nincentive and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will react.  That is fine when, ultimately,  the\r\n\r\nend  objective is profit.  They will react in that way.   But\r\n\r\nwhen  the  end  objective  is  a  social  thing  like  having\r\n\r\nchildren, then money has very little to do with it.   And  if\r\n\r\nwe want to address the problem, we have to ask ourselves what\r\n\r\nare  the  things that people actually think about  when  they\r\n\r\ndecide whether or not to have children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various reasons. One, they look to see\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not they are ready, because having babies  is  a\r\n\r\nheavy  responsibility.  And, increasingly,  we  find  amongst\r\n\r\nyoung couples that they actually want to spend some time with\r\n\r\neach other first before they actually have children, and that\r\n\r\nis  why  they  put  off the decision to  have  children.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  if  they wait too long, they could run into  medical\r\n\r\nproblems, but that is another area altogether which I do  not\r\n\r\nintend to touch on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is whether they can manage their work\r\n\r\ncommitments  if they have a child.  This is perhaps  less  so\r\n\r\nfor  men who are expected to be the breadwinner.  But I think\r\n\r\nwe  constantly underestimate the desire of women to  actually\r\n\r\ncontinue working even if they have children.  So we  have  to\r\n\r\ntake this into account if we want women to have children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that they take into account also is time\r\n\r\nand  stress.  The pressures and demands of work in  Singapore\r\n\r\nare  enormous.  This pressure has been exacerbated by the use\r\n\r\nof  information technology.  Generally speaking, Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave  very little rest.  We cannot escape, because  there  is\r\n\r\nSMS,  there is e-mail and there are all sorts of things.   We\r\n\r\njust  cannot  switch off, and work follows us  everywhere   - back home, to the office, in our car, when we are on holiday,\r\n\r\nwork  comes  with  us.  And with all this kind  of  pressure,\r\n\r\npeople  are so busy just trying to live their own lives,  let\r\n\r\nalone  think  about  having children  and  worry  about  that\r\n\r\nadditional responsibility.  These are the three main factors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing about our policy regarding financial\r\n\r\nincentives to have children is that it has a very off-putting\r\n\r\neffect to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  It is off-putting because many  of  them  feel\r\n\r\nthat when we do this, it is as though I give you money, I pop\r\n\r\nit  in  and  out  comes  a baby.  They  are  not  baby-making\r\n\r\nmachines.   It does not work that way.  It is not correct  to\r\n\r\nthink  that  financial or fiscal measures  will  address  the\r\n\r\nproblem.  So then, what will?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applied some thought to this. I certainly do not have\r\n\r\nall  the  solutions, but there are a couple of ideas which  I\r\n\r\nthink may help.  One is a more coherent approach towards  the\r\n\r\nissue of maternity leave.  There are currently two pieces  of\r\n\r\nlegislation  on  maternity  leave.   First,  there   is   the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act  which provides for two months  of  maternity\r\n\r\nleave  for employees who are covered by the Act.  I  have  no\r\n\r\nissue  with  two months of leave.  But when you look  at  the\r\n\r\nEmployment Act, the provision was enacted at a time  when  it\r\n\r\nwas  a stop-at-two policy.  So that allows for paid maternity\r\n\r\nleave  for  the first and second child, and it  provides  for\r\n\r\nprotection against termination of employment during a woman's\r\n\r\nmaternity leave for first and second child only.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then somewhere along the line, we decided that having a\r\n\r\nthird   child  will  be  good.   So  we  have  the   Children\r\n\r\nDevelopment Co-Savings Act.  What that Act does  is  that  it\r\n\r\nallows  for  paid maternity leave for a third  child  and  it\r\n\r\nimports  the provision of the Employment Act.  So it provides\r\n\r\nfor  protection  against termination of  employment  for  the\r\n\r\nthird  child.  The thing is that the Employment Act does  not\r\n\r\ncover  professionals, executives, managerial or  confidential\r\n\r\nstaff.   That  means   women  professionals,  executives  and\r\n\r\nsecretaries are excluded.  They do not have the protection of\r\n\r\npaid maternity leave.  I know in the market many employers do\r\n\r\nfollow the Employment Act, but it is not compulsory for  them\r\n\r\nto do so for the non-Employment Act group of women workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads to a very inconsistent situation because for\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act  women,  first  and  second  child,   it   is\r\n\r\nprotected  in  the sense that a woman cannot  get  terminated\r\n\r\nwhen she is on paid maternity leave.  And for all women under\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren  Development Co-Savings Act, they get paid maternity\r\n\r\nleave.   But for women executives, for their first and second\r\n\r\nchild,  they are not protected, because legislation does  not\r\n\r\nprovide  that they have maternity leave there, and  certainly\r\n\r\nnot  for the fourth, fifth, sixth child.  So we have got this\r\n\r\nvery incoherent policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing about maternity leave is that it is not\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  be regulating the number of babies  one  churns\r\n\r\nout.   The thing about maternity leave is that at the end  of\r\n\r\nnine  months  of  carrying a child  -  mind you,  I  have  no\r\n\r\npersonal experience, but I have it on good authority that  it\r\n\r\nis  very tiring  -  the woman needs some rest, and she  needs\r\n\r\nsome time with the child to bond, and that is the purpose  of\r\n\r\nmaternity  leave.  The trouble is that we use paid  maternity\r\n\r\nleave  as  a  means to regulate the number of babies  that  a\r\n\r\nwoman  has,  but that misses the purpose altogether.   And  I\r\n\r\nthink  if our target is to encourage more women professionals\r\n\r\nto have babies, this is an area that needs to be looked at.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing I should mention is that maternity leave\r\n\r\nshould be across the board, not just for first, second, third\r\n\r\nchild, but for any child, and it should also be for unmarried\r\n\r\nmothers.  I know that, as a matter of policy, we do not  wish\r\n\r\nto  encourage  people to have children outside  of  marriage.\r\n\r\nThat is true, but mistakes do happen.  These things do happen\r\n\r\nand  we  cannot ignore it.  And if the purpose ultimately  at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of the day is to allow a mother some time to  rest,\r\n\r\nallow  her  some time with her child, then I think we  should\r\n\r\nhave maternity leave for this group of people too.  I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  if  we had paid maternity leave for unmarried mothers,\r\n\r\nthat  it  would  suddenly result in a rash of  children  born\r\n\r\noutside  of wedlock.  Because I think the societal  pressures\r\n\r\nare  still  strong enough that people would  prefer  to  have\r\n\r\nchildren  within marriage and not outside.  So  that  is  the\r\n\r\nfirst thing that would help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing is greater childcare facilities. What\r\n\r\nis the one thing that will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmake  a woman want to have more children?  If she has a child\r\n\r\nand  she  wants to work, the thing that would really help  is\r\n\r\nher  feeling that the child is looked after while she  is  at\r\n\r\nwork.   There  are many mothers who choose to give  up  their\r\n\r\njobs.   That is not a problem.  If they are happy to do that,\r\n\r\nthat  is  okay.   They  stay at home  and  look  after  their\r\n\r\nchildren.   But  like  I  said, we have  under-estimated  the\r\n\r\ndesire of many Singapore women to want to work.  If we  force\r\n\r\nthem  to  choose  between having a child  and  maintaining  a\r\n\r\ncareer,  they  may  very well choose  the  latter,  and  that\r\n\r\nresults  in  a falling birth rate.  So something  that  would\r\n\r\nhelp  them  is  better  childcare  facilities.   And  knowing\r\n\r\nSingapore parents, it is not just childcare facilities  where\r\n\r\nthey  can just drop their children, and that is it.  It would\r\n\r\nhave to be childcare facilities that are good in terms of the\r\n\r\npeople  who  look after the children, the kind  of  not  only\r\n\r\nteaching but care that they can give their children, and also\r\n\r\nthe  age at which they look after the children.  Because now,\r\n\r\nmost childcare centres would be happy to take them in at  two\r\n\r\nyears  old, some may be at 18 months, but certainly not  many\r\n\r\nthat I know of that would take them in at perhaps six months.\r\n\r\nIn  the Scandinavian countries, I think they do take them  on\r\n\r\nfrom six months onwards.  So if we want to increase the birth\r\n\r\nrate, that is something that has to be looked at.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the first category of people - the married\r\n\r\ncouples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the group of singles who do not want to\r\n\r\nget  married.  And we have to ask ourselves why this  is  the\r\n\r\ncase.  At the Opening of Parliament, in his speech, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister identified the two groups where there seem to be the\r\n\r\nlargest  problem.   For single men, it was  those  that  have\r\n\r\nsecondary  school level education and below.  And for  single\r\n\r\nwomen, the largest proportion of the unmarried women was  the\r\n\r\ngraduates.  What this suggests is that non-graduate women are\r\n\r\nmarrying  either graduate men or non-graduate men.   So  they\r\n\r\nhave a larger pool to select from.  And for the graduate men,\r\n\r\nit also suggests that they are marrying either graduate women\r\n\r\nor non-graduate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwomen.  So they also have a larger pool to select from.   And\r\n\r\nthat  is  why we have the two ends, which is the non-graduate\r\n\r\nmen with secondary education and below and, of course, at the\r\n\r\nother end of the spectrum, graduate women.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the reasons why these two groups tend to remain\r\n\r\nsingle  are  different.  For the men in the  lower  education\r\n\r\ngroup, I think it is more difficult for them to marry someone\r\n\r\nwith a much higher education qualification.  And if the women\r\n\r\nwith  the  same or similar education qualification with  them\r\n\r\nare  marrying  upwards, so to speak, that  leaves  them  with\r\n\r\nlittle  choice  but  to look outwards  and  perhaps  to  non-Singapore  women.  But if they do that, they run  smack  into\r\n\r\nthe  SIR.  Because during my meet-the-people sessions, I have\r\n\r\nmany  men  who come to me to ask for PRs or citizenships  for\r\n\r\ntheir  wives,  or they have difficulty getting permission  to\r\n\r\nmarry  in some cases.  I fully understand that we need to  be\r\n\r\nvery  cautious in terms of immigration policy because we have\r\n\r\nto be quite careful about where our society is going.  But if\r\n\r\nwe  do  want  to look after the needs of this group,  then  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  do  have to examine the criterion for  immigration\r\n\r\npolicy afresh and see whether there is a way in which we  can\r\n\r\nstrike  some  balance so that at least for this  group,  they\r\n\r\nwill  have  a  certain measure of access, shall  we  say,  to\r\n\r\nspouses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the single women, it is quite different. Although\r\n\r\nit has been put as the largest group being graduate women,  I\r\n\r\nthink the \"true\" group is actually career women, not so  much\r\n\r\ngraduate  women, because we can have non-graduate  women  who\r\n\r\nare  also career women.  What has happened, I think, is  over\r\n\r\nthe years, there has been a change in gender expectations  of\r\n\r\none another which has led to this current situation.  For the\r\n\r\nmen,  they  have  not really had to change their  own  roles.\r\n\r\nForty years ago, a man was seen as a breadwinner, a protector\r\n\r\nand  a  provider,  and today he still sees  himself  in  that\r\n\r\nlight.   There  is absolutely nothing wrong with  that.   For\r\n\r\nwomen,  40  years  ago,  they may not necessarily  have  seen\r\n\r\nthemselves  as  career women.  What has happened  in  the  40\r\n\r\nyears is that they have actually\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncome  a  long way.  We have education, and because we have  a\r\n\r\nmeritocratic system, we have been able to advance in terms of\r\n\r\ncareers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So a lot of changes have happened in women's life over\r\n\r\nthe  last  40  years and their perception of  themselves  has\r\n\r\nchanged,  and  the perception of the role that men  play  has\r\n\r\nchanged as well.  For women, they see the men today less as a\r\n\r\nprotector  and  a provider, although I think many  still  do.\r\n\r\nBut many see them as a person whom they can look to for their\r\n\r\nemotional  or intellectual needs.  By this, what  I  mean  is\r\n\r\nthat in the past, many women would have married for financial\r\n\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, because they can actually earn for themselves,\r\n\r\nthis  is  not  the reason to marry anymore.   They  have  the\r\n\r\noption of not marrying, which means that they do not look for\r\n\r\na  man  for  financial security.  They look to him and  would\r\n\r\nconsider  marrying him only if he meets their  emotional  and\r\n\r\nintellectual needs.  And I am not sure that this problem  has\r\n\r\nbeen  sufficiently identified or realised because the way  we\r\n\r\ntreat the problem is one of, \"Oh, well, you know, maybe  they\r\n\r\nare  not  meeting one another enough.  Maybe they don't  have\r\n\r\nopportunities for interaction.\"  So I asked a friend of mine,\r\n\r\nwho is single, after the Prime Minister's speech, and I said,\r\n\r\n\"Well,  you know, you think it would help if you get to  meet\r\n\r\nmore  men?\"  And she looked at me with a slightly incredulous\r\n\r\nexpression  and said, \"What will I talk to him  about?\"   She\r\n\r\nobviously had this difficulty.  So that is actually the  real\r\n\r\narea of the problem.  And if it is something that we want  to\r\n\r\naddress,  then this is what we should be looking at,  not  so\r\n\r\nmuch of fiscal measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role that SDU and SDS play in helping people to\r\n\r\nmeet, I am sure, is helpful, but it does not actually address\r\n\r\nthe  crux of the problem.  Just a brief word on the  role  of\r\n\r\nSDU  and  SDS.   I  am  not  sure that  the  public  actually\r\n\r\nappreciates the distinction of one organisation for graduates\r\n\r\nand  another for non-graduates.  Because what we are actually\r\n\r\ndoing is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsending  out a message that there are two classes of society.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have been born and bred to believe that we are a\r\n\r\nmeritocratic system and, in many respects, we are  equal  and\r\n\r\nthere are equal opportunities for all.  Certainly, there  are\r\n\r\nmany  graduate  women  I know of who do  not  appreciate  the\r\n\r\ndistinction,  and  they automatically switch  off  when  they\r\n\r\nreceive  something from SDU.   This is not to  denigrate  the\r\n\r\nefforts  of  SDU whose officers work extremely hard  and  are\r\n\r\nvery  diligent.   I  know because when  I  became  an  MP,  I\r\n\r\nreceived  a packet on dating tips which I have not  yet  made\r\n\r\nuse  of.   But they do work very hard.  But they are fighting\r\n\r\nagainst something which is not within their control.   So  if\r\n\r\nwe  do  wish  to  address the problem,  I  think  maybe  this\r\n\r\ndistinction  between  graduates and non-graduates  should  be\r\n\r\ndone  away with.  And we should see Singaporeans as a  whole,\r\n\r\nas equal people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a tax reform\r\n\r\nBudget.   The  Government intends to offset the reduction  in\r\n\r\ndirect  tax revenue by increasing the Goods and Services  Tax\r\n\r\n(GST).  The  reason  for reducing the  corporate  tax  is  to\r\n\r\nattract more investments, retain the present investments  and\r\n\r\ncreate  more job opportunities for our people.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime, we are reducing the personal income tax to attract more\r\n\r\nforeign  talents  to  come  to  Singapore  and  to  encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  be more enterprising.  If this  policy  can\r\n\r\nattain  the above objectives, then there is no reason why  we\r\n\r\nshould not support it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, having heard the Budget Statement by the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister and Finance Minister, I do have a  number  of\r\n\r\ndoubts.   We reduce the corporate tax by 2.5% and then  raise\r\n\r\nthe GST by 2%.  This would only benefit those companies which\r\n\r\nare  making  substantial amount of profits.  If  you  have  a\r\n\r\nproduct  for  sale,  take  away  the  production  cost,   the\r\n\r\noverheads\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  other  costs, your profit margin is 45% and  above,  you\r\n\r\nwill  benefit from this scheme.  If the profit margin is less\r\n\r\nthan 45%, the company would be worse off.  Three years later,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  corporate tax is further reduced to 20%, you  will\r\n\r\nbenefit if your profit margin is 35% and above.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the MNCs, most, if not all, small and medium\r\n\r\nenterprises  (SMEs) in Singapore do not have a profit  margin\r\n\r\nas  high  as 35%, not to mention 45%.  So with this  new  tax\r\n\r\nregime, the business cost would increase rather than decrease\r\n\r\nfor  the SMEs.  These measures would not benefit them and  it\r\n\r\nwould, in fact, be detrimental to their operation.  I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  what  measures  we have to help these  companies  which\r\n\r\nwould end up worse off because of these tax adjustments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, most Singaporeans are not paying any income\r\n\r\ntax   since  the  major  adjustment  when  the  3%  GST   was\r\n\r\nimplemented in 1994.  That being the case, this present round\r\n\r\nof  tax reduction does not benefit them at all.  On the other\r\n\r\nhand,  they have to pay 2% more in GST, the tax burden  would\r\n\r\nbe  heavier for them.  Although we do have an offset package,\r\n\r\nit  is  going to last only five years or, at most, 10  years.\r\n\r\nWhat is going to happen after that?  Like it or not, the poor\r\n\r\npeople  would  still have to pay 5% GST.  As  a  result,  the\r\n\r\nlower income people will have a heavier tax burden, and  this\r\n\r\nburden is added to them because they have to make up for  the\r\n\r\nreduction in tax revenue resulting from the tax cut  for  the\r\n\r\nhigh  income earners and the corporate tax.  In the long run,\r\n\r\nthis is not being fair to the lower income people. As far  as\r\n\r\nthis  issue is concerned, in five or 10 years' time, it  will\r\n\r\nbe  a  real  problem for our people.  I think the  Government\r\n\r\nshould take note of this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we know that many people living in\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  executive flats have a lot of unhappiness over  the\r\n\r\ndistribution  of  the New Singapore Shares.   Those  who  are\r\n\r\nliving  in  the Executive Condominiums (EC) were conveniently\r\n\r\nclassified as \"rich\" people.  As such, they were deprived  of\r\n\r\nthe  benefits  enjoyed by those living in HDB  flats.   Under\r\n\r\nsuch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncircumstances,   many   people  living   in   the   Executive\r\n\r\nCondominiums were very unhappy with this distribution.   This\r\n\r\ntime round, when the Economic Restructuring Shares (ERS)  are\r\n\r\nbeing distributed, the Executive Condominium residents should\r\n\r\nbe  very  happy  because they will be entitled  to  the  same\r\n\r\nnumber  of  shares as the HDB residents.  In this  aspect,  I\r\n\r\nthink we should recognise that the residents in the Executive\r\n\r\nCondominiums are not really \"rich\" people as such.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on conservancy charges rebate, the E-flat\r\n\r\nresidents again will be excluded from this benefit.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the Finance Minister would listen to the complaints  of\r\n\r\nEC owners.  They are not high-income people.  In fact, many E-flat  residents  are  earning  just  as  low  as  other   HDB\r\n\r\nresidents.   I hope that the Finance Minister would  consider\r\n\r\nthis  aspect of it and consider giving some of these benefits\r\n\r\nto  the  owners  of Executive flats to offset the  impact  of\r\n\r\nhigher GST.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my speech during the debate on the President's\r\n\r\nAddress,  I  mentioned that subsidiary  companies  should  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  offset their losses against the profits  of  the\r\n\r\nother  companies in the group or the main company.   This  is\r\n\r\nalso  one  of  the  means to reduce business  cost.   I  also\r\n\r\nmentioned   about  the  high  business  cost  due   to   high\r\n\r\ntransportation  cost.   I  am pleased  that  both  are  being\r\n\r\nprovided   for  in  Budget  2002.   This  will  benefit   the\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  and  the businesses would  be  more  willing  to\r\n\r\nundertake  more  high risk ventures and this  would  help  in\r\n\r\nbuilding up their entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the reduction in the vehicle taxes, I have some\r\n\r\nviews.   Every time, when the Government reduces the  vehicle\r\n\r\ntaxes  like  the  Additional Registration Fee  (ARF)  or  the\r\n\r\nimport duty, the second-hand car dealers would be hard-hit as\r\n\r\nthe  stock of second-hand cars would almost immediately  lose\r\n\r\nits value substantially.  The losses can be very severe.  For\r\n\r\nexample, a second-hand car dealer has about 20 to 30 cars  in\r\n\r\nhand.  If the price of a second-car drops by, say, $2,000, he\r\n\r\nwould  have  suffered  a  loss of  some  $40,000  to  $60,000\r\n\r\novernight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we help these people when we implement these\r\n\r\nmeasures?   How do we help the second-hand car  dealers?   It\r\n\r\nwould depend on how we are going to decide on the PARF value.\r\n\r\nIf reduction in the PARF values equals to the total reduction\r\n\r\nin the ARF and import tax, the effect on price of the second-hand cars would be minimised.  In this instance, the ARF  and\r\n\r\nimport tax are reduced by a total of 20 percentage points  of\r\n\r\nthe  OMV, when the car is to be scrapped in five years' time,\r\n\r\nthe  PARF  value  will  be reduced by 33%  of  OMV  from  the\r\n\r\noriginal  PARF value.  In other words, by these new measures,\r\n\r\non  the  surface, it would appear that they would reduce  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  owning a car.  But, in fact, by implementing  these\r\n\r\nnew  measures, the scrap-value for vehicles will be  reduced,\r\n\r\nand  the  amount  recoverable by the  owners  will  be  less.\r\n\r\nHence,  the  net  cost in owning a car is  higher  under  the\r\n\r\nproposed new scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the end result of these new measures actually\r\n\r\nruns  contrary to the original intention of making cars  more\r\n\r\naffordable to the people.  The effective cost of owning a car\r\n\r\nis  actually  higher  than  the original  one.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should reconsider this PARF adjustment, as it runs\r\n\r\ncontrary to its original intention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Budget, it is mentioned that the civil service\r\n\r\nand  statutory  boards should be \"lean\" and  efficient.   But\r\n\r\nwhen  you  look  at the procedure in some of  the  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments,  you will find that some of the  procedures  are\r\n\r\nunnecessarily  cumbersome.  For  example,  if  you  want   to\r\n\r\nregister  a  car,  you have to go through  so  many  payments\r\n\r\nbefore a car can be registered.  Let me tell you what are the\r\n\r\nthings  you  have to do.  First of all, you have to  pay  the\r\n\r\nimport  duty,  the  GST  on the import  duty,  the  ARF,  the\r\n\r\nregistration  fee, and then the road tax,  and  then  another\r\n\r\nGST.  When the car is on the road, you pay petrol tax GST and\r\n\r\nERP.   There  are so many types of charges that you  have  to\r\n\r\npay.   Is  it really necessary?  If the Government wants  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments to be lean and  efficient,  then  you\r\n\r\nshould consolidate all these levies into one payment.  If the\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwants  to  be  effective, to be lean, it has to simplify  all\r\n\r\nthese procedures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that we are talking about giving double\r\n\r\ntax  rebates for R&D expenses and for those who are employing\r\n\r\nforeign companies to conduct R&D for local companies. It is a\r\n\r\nvery  good  practice.   It  is something  that  warrants  our\r\n\r\nsupport.   But we know that in R&D, the scope is  very  wide.\r\n\r\nMore  often  than  not,  it is not  just  one  company  doing\r\n\r\neverything  in a R&D project.  In the R&D market,  there  are\r\n\r\nthings like copyright, patent and other intellectual property\r\n\r\nrights on sale.  Companies could speed up their technology by\r\n\r\npurchasing all these intellectual property rights.   It  will\r\n\r\nbenefit many companies.  So I hope that when a company has to\r\n\r\npay for the use of intellectual property or right/licence for\r\n\r\nmanufacture, these expenses would also be entitled to  double\r\n\r\ntax rebates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite all my doubts and reservations, I nevertheless\r\n\r\nsupport  the motion standing in the name of the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and Finance Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  first Budget 2002 presented by DPM and Finance Minister\r\n\r\nLee Hsien Loong is significant in responding to the different\r\n\r\nworld we now live in.  The proposed strategic changes, in  my\r\n\r\nopinion, are bold, honest and unwavering.  The impact will be\r\n\r\nfar-reaching  as  it would contribute to  the  well-being  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans in the next phase of our growth and development.\r\n\r\nThe  picture  he has painted is now clearer in  defining  the\r\n\r\nkind  of economy we want to create for Singapore.  Sir,  this\r\n\r\nis  the  kind  of  leadership  that  Singapore  needs  during\r\n\r\nturbulent  times  and  when we move from  one  generation  to\r\n\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget is presented later than the usual end-March Budget in each year. The Budget has the advantage of\r\n\r\nknowing  the  results  of the year's first  quarter  economic\r\n\r\nperformance.  In fact, the global economic environment is so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvolatile  and uncertain that it makes financial and  economic\r\n\r\nforecasting  perilous.   There  is  the  dire  need  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  even  after  the Budget  has  been  approved  by\r\n\r\nParliament, to constantly review the progress throughout  the\r\n\r\nyear  so that timely measures are taken and adjustment  made,\r\n\r\ntaking  into  account any critical and momentous developments\r\n\r\nthat  might  scuttle the Budget plans for  the  year.   I  am\r\n\r\nthinking  about  the developments in the  Middle  East  which\r\n\r\ncertainly could be a development that can change the scene in\r\n\r\nthe  world.   We  experienced this last year, Sir,  when  the\r\n\r\nBudget  was  presented as usual in March, yet the  Government\r\n\r\nsaw  it fit to implement the $2.2 billion package of measures\r\n\r\nin  July  to forestall and cushion the effects of the  severe\r\n\r\ndeterioration in our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has given the highest priority in\r\n\r\ncreating good jobs for Singapore.  Sir, good jobs mean higher\r\n\r\nvalue  jobs  that command good salaries for Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nhave  the  skills  and  qualifications  to  take  them.   The\r\n\r\nSingaporean businessmen commonly ask the Government  to  help\r\n\r\nbring  their cost of operations down so that they can compete\r\n\r\nagainst the countries in the region.  Unfortunately, there is\r\n\r\na  limit  as  to how low we can go in bringing  the  cost  of\r\n\r\noperations  down.   Sometimes, I wonder whether  our  liberal\r\n\r\npolicy  to allow the importation of cheap foreign labour  has\r\n\r\nled  to our lack of competitiveness in some of our industries\r\n\r\ntoday.   It  is  not possible for Singaporean businessmen  to\r\n\r\nwant  to earn good profits and Singaporean workers to  desire\r\n\r\nand  expect  higher  salaries and yet are unprepared  to  pay\r\n\r\ncommensurate  prices for the goods and services produced  and\r\n\r\nprovided for by fellow Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, we should not unwisely pay generous\r\n\r\nremuneration to foreign talent just because they are  foreign\r\n\r\nwithout  scrutinising their capacity to contribute and  their\r\n\r\nability  to  fit into the local culture and environment.   We\r\n\r\nshould  not  overlook the equally deserving  Singaporeans  by\r\n\r\ngiving  them  similar opportunities to make the  grade.   The\r\n\r\ncynicism  Singaporeans have for foreign talent has been  that\r\n\r\nquite a few have been deemed to be largely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunsuccessful  in making their mark.  Singaporeans  have  been\r\n\r\nunconvinced that foreigners have made the vast difference  to\r\n\r\nthe  performance  of  Singaporean organisations  that  employ\r\n\r\nthem.   Singaporean  corporations can  do  a  better  job  in\r\n\r\nsuccession planning and the development of Singaporean talent\r\n\r\nas   corporate  leaders  for  their  organisations.   It   is\r\n\r\nsometimes amusing to note of the contrary approach  taken  by\r\n\r\nSingaporean  corporations that want to  employ  more  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent  and  the foreign MNCs are satisfied with Singaporeans\r\n\r\nbecause they find them to be capable and competent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore market is highly competitive and\r\n\r\ndemanding.   In  order to succeed, a strong  management  team\r\n\r\nsupported  by  a  cohesive  group  of  subordinate  staff  is\r\n\r\nrequired.  The issue is not talent alone.  It has also to  do\r\n\r\nwith  business knowledge, systems, culture and  team  effort.\r\n\r\nThe  question is not foreign or local talent.  It is that  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, we just simply do not have a large enough pool  of\r\n\r\nleadership and executive talent in Singapore with the breadth\r\n\r\nand   depth   of   experience  operating   as   multinational\r\n\r\ncorporations  at  the  corporate level in  the  regional  and\r\n\r\nglobal markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans now realise that it is no longer a stigma\r\n\r\nto  move  from job to job and to change from one business  to\r\n\r\nanother.    Singaporeans  have  learnt  to   seize   whatever\r\n\r\nopportunities available and the need to climb  up  the  value\r\n\r\nchain both in their careers and businesses.  However, we have\r\n\r\nto  be  realistic that no matter how hard we try and whatever\r\n\r\nencouragement  we  may  give, there would  only  be  a  small\r\n\r\nsegment of our population who would want to be entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nThe  vast  majority  would be content to remain  as  salaried\r\n\r\nemployees.  There is no doubt that the nature and  tenure  of\r\n\r\nemployment   will  also  change.   The  present  unfavourable\r\n\r\nemployment  market conditions have affected the attitude  and\r\n\r\npsyche  of  the  average Singaporean who feels  insecure  and\r\n\r\nvulnerable.   In  recent  times, we have  witnessed  graduate\r\n\r\nexecutives  and professionals losing their jobs arising  from\r\n\r\nmergers  and acquisitions, and the organisations  needing  to\r\n\r\nadjust to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew   business  operating  environment  with   the   use   of\r\n\r\ninformation and communications technology and this had  added\r\n\r\nto the gloom and doom.  We have to brace ourselves that for a\r\n\r\nlong  while yet, a sizable number of Singaporeans will suffer\r\n\r\njoblessness   and   have   difficulty  securing   alternative\r\n\r\nemployment  with  salaries comparable to what  they  used  to\r\n\r\nearn.   For Singaporeans who are currently employed, the  way\r\n\r\nto protect themselves and secure their employability would be\r\n\r\nto  be  flexible  in  accepting  work  assignments  and  even\r\n\r\naccepting downgrading in job roles and be diligent  to  learn\r\n\r\nnew skills and apply their knowledge as best as they can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Budget did not cover any changes to the\r\n\r\ncurrent rate of CPF contribution at 20% for employees and 16%\r\n\r\nfor employers for those below 55 years.  Singaporeans used to\r\n\r\nhave  the  total CPF saving rate of 50% and then  reduced  to\r\n\r\n40%,  and  now  adjusted  to  36%  because  of  the  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn.   The Government has all along expounded the  long-term  policy  of 40% in CPF contributions to be  adequate  in\r\n\r\nproviding   for   the  retirement  needs   of   Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Singaporeans are especially concerned when  there\r\n\r\nwas a suggestion to introduce new age bands for the 40 to  55\r\n\r\nyears  old  to  lower  the employers' wage  cost.   This  has\r\n\r\nrattled  middle age Singaporeans who fear that they would  be\r\n\r\nadversely affected if this came about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that CPF savings have been used to\r\n\r\ncater  to  the  housing,  medical  and  retirement  needs  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Singaporeans in the 40 to 55 age  groups  are\r\n\r\npeople  with  the  highest financial needs.   We  should  not\r\n\r\nreduce  the employers' CPF contribution for the older workers\r\n\r\nwithout giving them ample notice.  I would hazard to say that\r\n\r\nthey  should be given at least five years' notice before  any\r\n\r\nchange  could  be made to allow them to make their  long-term\r\n\r\nadjustment.   I  estimate that there must  have  been  a  few\r\n\r\nhundred  thousand properties that have changed hands at  high\r\n\r\nproperty  prices  in the last few years.   Many  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave  borrowed and mortgaged their homes to the hilt  with  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstalment  repayment coming from the withdrawal  from  their\r\n\r\nCPF  savings.   Any reduction in employers' CPF  contribution\r\n\r\nwould  certainly  cause severe financial  hardships  to  many\r\n\r\nfamilies who have bought new homes in recent years.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthe Government will think very carefully before attempting to\r\n\r\nchange  the  rate  of employers' CPF contribution  overnight.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  think any change just to solve the problem of a small\r\n\r\ngroup at the expense of a much larger group is not the way to\r\n\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Government has recognised that\r\n\r\nwith  the reduction of corporate and income taxes, the income\r\n\r\ngap  will  widen.   The  tax deductions  provided  will  help\r\n\r\npromote  the  spirit  of  philanthropy  in  individuals   and\r\n\r\ncorporations,  which  I  believe  is  a  step  in  the  right\r\n\r\ndirection.   In fact, I am pleasantly surprised that  such  a\r\n\r\nheavy document as the Budge Statement saw it fit to have this\r\n\r\nelement  of  philanthropy  written  into  it.   I  hope  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and local and foreign corporations operating  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  contribute generously to support  the  less\r\n\r\nable  in  our  community.  Their act as socially  responsible\r\n\r\ncitizens will contribute to social bonding and help  build  a\r\n\r\nstrong and cohesive Singapore society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  thank  you for the opportunity  to  speak  on\r\n\r\nBudget  2002.  However, it is getting late now and many  have\r\n\r\nspoken, and on overlapping areas too, and so I will try to be\r\n\r\nshort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government is well-known for being\r\n\r\ndecisive.   Now is the time indeed to be decisive  and  bold.\r\n\r\nAs  DPM  and  Finance Minister Lee Hsien Loong  said  in  his\r\n\r\nBudget  speech, to thrive in a different world we are in,  we\r\n\r\nmust  confront and accept the new realities, we must  quickly\r\n\r\nadapt ourselves to the changed environment, and to many  more\r\n\r\nchanges to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed changes to restructure our economy are\r\n\r\nindeed  very sweeping.  I agree, as we must start  early.   I\r\n\r\nhave  asked  around and the reactions I obtained are  varied,\r\n\r\nunderstandably.  From the private sector, they like the  bold\r\n\r\nmoves,  especially the corporate and personal tax  cuts.   We\r\n\r\nmust  spur our economy to grow, they urged.  There are  those\r\n\r\nwho however feel that not enough was being done for the SMEs,\r\n\r\na  point  also stressed by Mr Inderjit Singh and many  others\r\n\r\ntoday.   For  the  more  radical, they  even  feel  that  the\r\n\r\ncorporate tax cuts should not be done in stages.  For greater\r\n\r\nimpact, it should be done at one go, they said.  That is  how\r\n\r\nserious  and  how  urgent, they feel,  is  the  situation  if\r\n\r\nSingapore were to remain competitive and to save jobs.   That\r\n\r\nis  how  fundamental it is.  The bottom line  is  saving  and\r\n\r\ncreating jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the average citizen, especially the lower income\r\n\r\nearners,  their main preoccupation is why increase  the  GST,\r\n\r\nespecially  now.  They feel that while the corporate  sectors\r\n\r\nand  higher income earners have a lot to gain, they  are  the\r\n\r\nones  having  to  pay more.  The GST offsets notwithstanding,\r\n\r\nthey  feel  that  there is no point in the Government  taking\r\n\r\npride in the position that 75% of the population does not pay\r\n\r\ntaxes when there is the GST to fend for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the lower income, including and especially those who\r\n\r\nhave  been retrenched or unemployed, there is no big picture.\r\n\r\nIt  is  their micro position that looms high on their agenda.\r\n\r\nThat is the bottom line too:  jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we know, of course, that this is precisely the\r\n\r\nreason for the sweeping changes in Budget 2002:  saving  jobs\r\n\r\nand  creating jobs.  That is also the critical test for  this\r\n\r\nBudget.  If I may cite the experience at the North-East  CDC,\r\n\r\nand  here  I  declare my interest as Mayor of the  North-East\r\n\r\nCDC, jobs, jobs and jobs are also the focus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when I was appointed Mayor of\r\n\r\nthe  Ang Mo Kio-Cheng San CDC, part-time before and now full-time at North-East, my main\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npreoccupation  was then racial harmony and  social  cohesion.\r\n\r\nBut now, it seems \"Jobs, Jobs, Jobs\" matter most.  But do not\r\n\r\nbe mistaken, for jobs too play an important part in forging a\r\n\r\nmore  cohesive society.  For not many will care about harmony\r\n\r\nand  cohesion,  when on an empty stomach, and  with  so  many\r\n\r\nbills unpaid, with electricity and water on hold, awaiting to\r\n\r\nbe cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the North-East CDC, we have set up what we call JELL\r\n\r\n(Jobs, Employability and Lifelong Learning) Committee as part\r\n\r\nof  our  priorities.  Yes, jobs, not just for the short-term,\r\n\r\nfilling the vacuum left by retrenchment and unemployment, but\r\n\r\nlong-term  employability achieved through lifelong  learning.\r\n\r\nWe  believe  that  way we will be able  to  ensure  a  better\r\n\r\njelling of the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, Sir, the people trust the Government.\r\n\r\nThe  75%  votes cast last November said so.  Not  that  there\r\n\r\nwere  no outstanding issues and problems then, but the people\r\n\r\nknew that the Government can and will deliver, especially  in\r\n\r\ntrying times.  In other words, the people are saying, do what\r\n\r\nyou  think  is necessary, but just save the jobs  and  create\r\n\r\nenough new ones to make us Singaporeans sleep better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to close by focusing\r\n\r\non three recommendations:\r\n\r\n<br><br>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To call upon the Government to do more for the SMEs and\r\n\r\nhelp them to grow further and help save and create more jobs;\r\n\r\n<br><br>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To monitor closely the effects of the new GST rate to\r\n\r\nensure that the offset package to help alleviate the short-term problem is effective, especially for the lower income\r\n\r\nearners; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide more resources for the CDCs to help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans prepare for the new realities, be it in\r\n\r\neducational and bonding programmes, improved job matching and\r\n\r\nplacements and/or training and retraining.\r\n\r\nI  have  just mentioned them briefly but I think  I  will  be\r\n\r\ndwelling on them at the COS later this week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a final note, Sir, if the Government has been bold in\r\n\r\nits  Budget measures, the people too should respond with grit\r\n\r\nand  determination.  The challenges brought about by this new\r\n\r\nand different world require nothing less.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my\r\n\r\nparliamentary colleagues in this Budget debate have spoken on\r\n\r\nthe different financial aspects and the difficulties faced by\r\n\r\nour  people, SMEs and corporate companies.  I would like  now\r\n\r\nto dwell on another financial consideration of many, that is,\r\n\r\nhealthcare  affordability which has been  touched  on  by  my\r\n\r\nparliamentary  colleague Madam Halimah Yacob earlier.   After\r\n\r\nlistening to 23 speakers before me and a long day, may I seek\r\n\r\nthe  patience of my colleagues here for a while more to  hear\r\n\r\nme out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, healthcare affordability has been a major concern\r\n\r\nfor many Singaporeans.  This concern will only get worse with\r\n\r\nthe  expected  escalating healthcare costs  in  view  of  our\r\n\r\nageing  population and rapid advances in medical  technology.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  Singapore's national health  expenditure,  at  the\r\n\r\ncurrent level of healthcare servicing, will rise to 7% of GDP\r\n\r\nby 2030.  The widespread worry, especially among the elderly,\r\n\r\non  hospitalisation  affordability is understandable.   I  am\r\n\r\nreminded  of a familiar saying \"Can die but cannot afford  to\r\n\r\nfall  ill\" and I hope we do not succumb to such a predicament\r\n\r\nin the days ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our National Health Expenditure (NHE) increased from\r\n\r\n$4.4  billion  in  1999  to  $4.7  billion  in  2000.   As  a\r\n\r\npercentage  of  GDP, NHE formed about 3%.  Per-capita  health\r\n\r\nexpenditure rose about 6% in one year from $1,360 in 1999  to\r\n\r\n$1,439  in  2000.  The NHE proportion is borne two-thirds  by\r\n\r\nthe  people, or the private share and only one third  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   This  contrasts  significantly  with  that   in\r\n\r\nEngland  where  the  private share  is  only  one  sixth,  in\r\n\r\nAustralia where the private share is only half, and  in  Hong\r\n\r\nKong and Malaysia where the ratio is roughly one to one.   If\r\n\r\nthe ratio of Government and private\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproportion  is going to remain, the impact on the people  can\r\n\r\nbe  great indeed.  It is worse still as in this year, when in\r\n\r\nabsolute  terms,  the allocation to MOH is less  because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment allocation is based on GDP.  As the NHE cannot  be\r\n\r\nlessened, the extra burden will be on the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I would like to beseech the Government to address\r\n\r\nthis concern of many Singaporeans and find ways to ameliorate\r\n\r\ntheir worry with some expedient actions and with further  and\r\n\r\nbetter planning to soften the future burden.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a people, our main prime resource, the provision\r\n\r\nof  good  healthcare to all Singaporeans must be prioritised.\r\n\r\nThis   is   to  ensure  a  healthy  workforce  as  the   main\r\n\r\ncontributors  to our survival as a nation.   The  MOH  should\r\n\r\nhave  the same importance and bestowed the same weightage  as\r\n\r\nother  Ministries, the MOE, for example.    The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  is  cultivating  our  future  resource,  but   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health is sustaining and nursing the present  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  our future resource.  Sir, I would like to  suggest\r\n\r\nthe  following  eight ways relevant to Singapore  to  address\r\n\r\nthis issue of affordability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) There is a need to allay the concerns of many,\r\n\r\nespecially    the    elderly   on   the   affordability    of\r\n\r\nhospitalisation bills should they fall sick.  It  is  a  fact\r\n\r\nthat  hospitalisations can cost thousands of dollars and  can\r\n\r\neven be tens of thousands if surgery is involved.  This is so\r\n\r\neven  in  our  public  hospitals.  We need  immediate  action\r\n\r\ntowards assuring people that affordability of hospitalisation\r\n\r\nis  ensured  with  our  3M-scheme (Medisave,  Medishield  and\r\n\r\nMedifund).   Remarkably, many people still do not  understand\r\n\r\ntheir  usage  fully.   For  a start,  MOH  can  provide  more\r\n\r\nbriefing  materials for MPs to familiarise  their  grassroots\r\n\r\nworkers  with what is provided for.  With the new Eldershield\r\n\r\nand Elderfund, MOH must provide even more in public education\r\n\r\nregarding the various schemes available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To ensure special long-term affordability, \"health\r\n\r\nrisk pooling\" through\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninsurance,  a  risk transfer mechanism, may  be  better  than\r\n\r\nplain  dependence  on  savings alone.   Therefore,  a  bigger\r\n\r\nproportion  of  Medisave should be allowed  for  purchase  of\r\n\r\nmedical  insurance,  such  as the  Portable  Medical  Benefit\r\n\r\nHospitalisation and Surgical cover.  The fear of  encouraging\r\n\r\nthe buffet syndrome or of driving up healthcare costs can  be\r\n\r\ncontained  as long as Medisave accredited insurance companies\r\n\r\ncontain  the  co-payment  and deductible  elements  in  their\r\n\r\npolicies.   This will emphasise the principle  of  individual\r\n\r\nresponsibility  or  one's own healthcare  needs.   This  will\r\n\r\nencourage Singaporeans to better plan and save when they  are\r\n\r\nyounger,  and not to depend just on Medisave alone or,  worse\r\n\r\nstill,  to  depend on Medifund when they fall  sick.   It  is\r\n\r\nnecessary for the people to know that we cannot assume  there\r\n\r\nwill always be budget surpluses to build up our Medifund  and\r\n\r\nprovide an unlimited safety net in the years ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Sir, our homecare services are almost non-existent\r\n\r\nat present. We need to make this service available quickly in\r\n\r\norder  to  lessen the need for high cost stay in the tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  especially  the  acute  hospitals.   With  our\r\n\r\nageing  population, homecare, where many discharged  patients\r\n\r\ncan be looked after in their own homes, will be an increasing\r\n\r\ndemand and an important part of our healthcare structure.  In\r\n\r\ntandem  with  the establishment of homecare,  there  must  be\r\n\r\neffective   support   from  primary   healthcare,   community\r\n\r\nhealthcare and social services, as well as modified  housing.\r\n\r\nI  feel that for homecare to be really effective, there  must\r\n\r\nbe  the  involvement of the community.  There should be  more\r\n\r\ncommunity volunteers and home help for families to  care  for\r\n\r\nthe  dependent elderly in their homes.  There should also  be\r\n\r\nmore  adjunct community supporting services like domiciliary,\r\n\r\ndaycare, rehabilitation and occupational therapy services  to\r\n\r\ncomplement  the  homecare.  Such facilitation will  translate\r\n\r\ninto lower costs and convenience for a happier people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) We need more innovative concepts to better plan the\r\n\r\npresent and future manpower needs of our healthcare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem  because manpower costs demand a rather large  portion\r\n\r\nof  our  healthcare costs.  We must have fresh  ideas  and  a\r\n\r\n\"dare-to-do\" attitude in trying out new grounds. For example,\r\n\r\nin  order to cater to the manpower needs in starting homecare\r\n\r\nservices,  MOH  should  re-look at the  usage  of  healthcare\r\n\r\nworkers and consider using not only full-time paid personnel,\r\n\r\nbut  also  family members, community volunteers, and  so  on.\r\n\r\nSuch  healthcare workers can be trained in a matter of weeks.\r\n\r\nIn  England, it takes only three weeks of intensive  training\r\n\r\nto  equip them with the necessary skills.  They are certified\r\n\r\nat  the  end of courses which teach them in assisted feeding,\r\n\r\ncatheter  care, prosthesis use, simple dressings  and  simple\r\n\r\ngrooming  as  in  toenail  cutting  for  non-diabetics  using\r\n\r\nsterile techniques.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another example is the recognition that nurses who\r\n\r\nare well-trained can do a lot and can contribute not only  to\r\n\r\nbetter care of patients but also to lower costs in healthcare\r\n\r\ndelivery.   It is very much cheaper to maintain  a  nurse  as\r\n\r\ncompared  to,  let us say, a doctor.  Moreover,  well-trained\r\n\r\nnurses  can  carry out many functions otherwise performed  by\r\n\r\ndoctors  and  this  frees the latter for other  duties.   The\r\n\r\npresent shortage of nurses has to be addressed urgently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have an undergraduate nursing programme for\r\n\r\nnurses.   There  is  only  the diploma  course  from  Nanyang\r\n\r\nPolytechnic and Certificate in Nursing course from ITE.  Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is about time that this option be made available. We need\r\n\r\nto train more professional nurses, not just as caregivers but\r\n\r\nalso as care managers, coordinators and innovators to keep up\r\n\r\nwith  the  changing needs.  The provision of an undergraduate\r\n\r\nprogramme  for  nursing  will also address  the  shortage  of\r\n\r\nnurses  and this will provide another channel for the  better\r\n\r\nqualified  students that will otherwise  not  go  to  ITE  or\r\n\r\nNanyang Polytechnic to do nursing.  This group may feel  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  wasting their talent by not pursuing a  university\r\n\r\ndegree.  The undergraduate course will provide the discipline\r\n\r\nto  grow  as  many  nurses can also upgrade themselves  after\r\n\r\ngraduation from ITE and Nanyang Polytechnic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the scope of nursing work must be expanded.\r\n\r\nQualified  nurses become even more relevant as we pursue  the\r\n\r\nlife  sciences and excellence in medical healthcare.  We  can\r\n\r\nhave nurses as trained personnel to assist in scientific  and\r\n\r\nclinical  projects  as  part  of  a  team  with  doctors  and\r\n\r\nscientists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Preventive healthcare must be the hallmark of all\r\n\r\nissues  concerning  healthcare affordability.   The  adequate\r\n\r\nallocation  of  funds  today and the  success  of  preventive\r\n\r\nmeasures  will save us millions in the future.  The  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Health  must ensure continuity and lasting follow-through\r\n\r\nof  all  efforts  on preventive healthcare.   The  Ministry's\r\n\r\npriority  must be to continuously identify prevalent diseases\r\n\r\nthat  need greater attention and to continuously monitor  and\r\n\r\nstudy the trends for prevention and common diseases, as  well\r\n\r\nas  the  many  different  aspects of  preventive  healthcare.\r\n\r\nConsider  these  examples.  Since colorectal  cancer  is  the\r\n\r\nsecond  leading  cause of cancer in men, there  should  be  a\r\n\r\nnational screening programme started.  Since pneumonia is the\r\n\r\nthird  leading cause of death, it will be useful to find  the\r\n\r\ncausal factors and establish the preventive measures. As  the\r\n\r\nprevalence  rate of depression in Singapore is  8.6%,  a  new\r\n\r\nemphasis  on  mental health, which has not received  its  due\r\n\r\nattention, is necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since morbidity and mortality\r\n\r\nfrom  any  disease  can  be  dramatically  reduced  when  the\r\n\r\ndiseases  are  treated  in  their  early  stages,  preventive\r\n\r\nhealthcare  should be especially targeted at the younger  age\r\n\r\ngroup.   I  am concerned that the young may assume that  they\r\n\r\nare  less  vulnerable because of age, and therefore  have  no\r\n\r\nneed  for regular check-ups.  We have to make sure that  they\r\n\r\nare  not  left out in our preventive care efforts, especially\r\n\r\nin   prevention  of  early  and  treatable  conditions   like\r\n\r\ndiabetes,   hypertension  and  high-blood  cholesterol.    In\r\n\r\ntackling  this problem, there is a need for much  creativity,\r\n\r\nfunding and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Appropriate investment in medical research and life\r\n\r\nsciences directed at our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprevalent  needs,  like  finding the  cures  for  the  common\r\n\r\ndiseases  and  cancers  that affect  most  Singaporeans,  can\r\n\r\naddress  the  long-term  healthcare affordability.   If  gene\r\n\r\ntherapy  can  be  found to treat and prevent heart  diseases,\r\n\r\ndiabetes  and  hypertension, the amount of  savings  will  be\r\n\r\nenormous.   If  cures or better still the preventive  factors\r\n\r\ncan be found for the common cancers affecting Asians, such as\r\n\r\nnasopharyngeal  cancer, many will be saved  from  dying  from\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is better to place more emphasis on prevalent\r\n\r\ndiseases  and  possible  future plans  in  Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of these diseases.  For example, Hepatitis C  has\r\n\r\nemerged  from  obscurity  to being recognised  as  the  major\r\n\r\npublic health problems world-wide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because western researchers may lack priority and\r\n\r\nsubject material to work on Asian conditions, priority in use\r\n\r\nof  funds  and manpower should therefore be directed  at  our\r\n\r\nspecific  needs and especially at those diseases that  affect\r\n\r\nmostly  Asians.  We should have more detailed epidemiological\r\n\r\nstudies of disease patterns and based on medical research and\r\n\r\nlife  sciences study on them, to better plan and cushion  our\r\n\r\nown long-term healthcare cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The rise in healthcare expenditure has prompted\r\n\r\nmany  nations  to develop and implement on armoury  of  cost-control  mechanisms.   A  study  on  the  experience  of  six\r\n\r\ncountries, Australia, Canada, Germany, United States,  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  and Singapore, showed that healthcare inflation  can\r\n\r\nbe  managed  and not through the strategy of competition  but\r\n\r\nthrough  centralised control over healthcare resources.   Two\r\n\r\ncountries, the United States of America and Singapore,  opted\r\n\r\nfor  competition in healthcare financing.   In  the  case  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  our Government decided to use market  competition\r\n\r\nby  carefully  designing competition between the  public  and\r\n\r\nprivate  hospitals.  The expectation of countries subscribing\r\n\r\nto  this approach is that competition will drive down prices,\r\n\r\nwhile providing incentives to improve efficiency\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  quality.  However, evidence suggests the contrary.   The\r\n\r\nUnited  States  and  Singapore have experienced  the  highest\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate  in  healthcare expenditures.   Sir,  the  right\r\n\r\napproach  should be an integration of the private and  public\r\n\r\nsectors in Singapore to maximise our small resource pool.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Sir, new medical technology can contribute to\r\n\r\nefficiency gain in the hospitals, for example, in  making  it\r\n\r\npossible for more day surgeries done which otherwise  require\r\n\r\nhospitalisation  stay.   Technology  acquisition  is  closely\r\n\r\nlinked with manpower considerations.  Physicians are a  major\r\n\r\nfactor  in  the  demand  for and  use  of  technology.   More\r\n\r\nspecific  training  of  physicians to use  high-tech  devices\r\n\r\nshould be encouraged.  Limits on medical technology have been\r\n\r\nenvisioned  for the private sector in Singapore.  Sir,  these\r\n\r\nlimits  will  jeopardise Singapore's  role  as  a  healthcare\r\n\r\nmagnet  for  patients  from  foreign  countries.   Technology\r\n\r\nlimitation might alter the inflow of such patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to end by reiterating that the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Singapore into a medical hub of the region and\r\n\r\nturning Singapore into the \"Mayo Clinic of Southeast Asia\" is\r\n\r\na  worthwhile  industry to pursue.  Having  more  full-paying\r\n\r\nforeign patients, apart from giving a spin-off effect for our\r\n\r\nother services by having more visitors to Singapore, may be a\r\n\r\nsource  of  subsidy rather than a cause of rising  healthcare\r\n\r\ncost for local patients. There is a need for a mindset change\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope that the above\r\n\r\nsuggestions  to  address the affordability of  healthcare  in\r\n\r\nSingapore can be considered favourably by our Government.\r\n\r\n<br>7.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI shall be as brief as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an overwhelming victory of 75%, the people's\r\n\r\nexpectation of the Government is very high, and the  task  of\r\n\r\nmeeting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  expectation  is challenging and daunting.   Challenging\r\n\r\nbecause  many  changes  to our economy and  institutions  are\r\n\r\nbeing made, and daunting because these changes bring a lot of\r\n\r\nuncertainty and pain to our people.  Yet, not to do so  would\r\n\r\nbe  like  an ostrich hiding its head in the sand.  We  change\r\n\r\nbecause  the world has changed since September 11.   Business\r\n\r\nmethods  are  changing,  so  our financial  institutions  and\r\n\r\nbanking instruments will have to change.  Manufacturing is no\r\n\r\nlonger assembly work, but innovation, design, research-based.\r\n\r\nBiotech  is  slowly  going to replace  even  our  wafer  fab,\r\n\r\nbecause the latter has reached an over supply stage.  And  we\r\n\r\ncannot  compete with China as it has more of  the  wafer  fab\r\n\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Indonesia and Malaysia served as our\r\n\r\nhinterland, but geopolitics and competition have changed  all\r\n\r\nthat.    Our   ports  face  competition  from  Malaysia   and\r\n\r\nIndonesia, and so also our airport will soon face very strong\r\n\r\ncompetition.  We must accept this as part of our neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries'  upgrading and domestic needs, and push  ourselves\r\n\r\ninto new frontiers of service and business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not foresee the position we enjoyed in the past\r\n\r\nwith  our neighbouring countries as ever coming back.  So  we\r\n\r\nmust  change  and  change fast.   Geopolitics  and  terrorist\r\n\r\nactivities will serve as a backdrop, as we continue with  our\r\n\r\ndetermination  to progress and survive.  With  these  opening\r\n\r\nremarks,  I  look  at  our  Budget trying  to  meet  the  new\r\n\r\ncircumstances  of doing business and helping  our  people  to\r\n\r\ncome along with the Government to meet this new challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern of the man-in-the-street is GST, CPF\r\n\r\nchanges,  car  park  charges,  utility  bills,  medical   and\r\n\r\neducation.  Above all these, he wants job security and  jobs.\r\n\r\nThe changing economy has made many Singaporeans very insecure\r\n\r\nand  worrying.  This insecurity affects many, but more so the\r\n\r\nless  educated.   Some want to change with  retraining,  some\r\n\r\nsimply  cannot  change,  and watch with  frustration  to  see\r\n\r\nforeign workers doing the jobs that they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  not want.  Calling Singaporeans to have mindset change is\r\n\r\nright,  as  we  cannot  continue  to  provide,  for  example,\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn  relief,  as this  will  create  a  crutch\r\n\r\nmentality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, there are some who have lost jobs, because of\r\n\r\nbusiness  change  and  relocation  up  north  and  elsewhere,\r\n\r\nespecially   manufacturing  plants.   They  cannot   upgrade,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  technological changes and cost of  operation  is\r\n\r\nhigh compared to China, Indonesia, etc.  However, perhaps  to\r\n\r\nsave  jobs,  we  should  not be too  eager  to  replace  such\r\n\r\nfactories too quickly with new biotech ones.  Some are beyond\r\n\r\nrescue,  but surely there must be some that can be helped  to\r\n\r\nupgrade   to   meet   the  new  business  and   manufacturing\r\n\r\nrequirements of high-end products.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope our special Committee on Remaking of Singapore\r\n\r\nwill look into this.  Perhaps they can involve the Enterprise\r\n\r\nPromotion Centre to help.  Do not write off manufacturing too\r\n\r\nfast,  because employment in this sector is high, and  if  we\r\n\r\ncan  lend a helping hand, we should and this will be able  to\r\n\r\nprotect  job  losses in this sector.  We must capitalise  the\r\n\r\nexpertise  of EDB, our universities and industry  experts  to\r\n\r\nhelp such companies to upgrade, and thus preserve jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am advocating a balanced approach to transform\r\n\r\nour  economy because many of our people are not able to  cope\r\n\r\nwith  the speed of change we expect of them.  So many  policy\r\n\r\nchanges  are  happening each day that the average Singaporean\r\n\r\nis  probably lost or cannot follow, resulting in many  to  be\r\n\r\nindifferent  to  the changes.  However, we  cannot  turn  the\r\n\r\nclock  back.  We have to be more circumspect in the execution\r\n\r\nof  our policy changes and not be too quick to throw the rule\r\n\r\nbook at them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, creating jobs through the tax\r\n\r\nrestructuring is one way of attracting investors and  talent.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the cut in corporate and personal income tax  will\r\n\r\nbe  most  welcome.  But do tax cuts draw investments?   In  a\r\n\r\nreport  of  Barclays Capital, which I read  in  the  Business\r\n\r\nTimes on 9th May 2000, it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunlikely to spur inflows of foreign direct investments  (FDI)\r\n\r\nand   in  its  view,  the  main  impediment  to  FDI  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily the cost base but limited business opportunities.\r\n\r\nAnd it goes to explain:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'South-east Asia's manufacturing base is also \"far\r\n\r\nshallower\"  and its economic outlook \"far more  modest\"  than\r\n\r\nNorth  Asia,  while  Singapore's regional  entrepot  role  is\r\n\r\nundermined by competing port and transport hubs in  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nUntil   South-east  Asia  can  deliver  the  economic  growth\r\n\r\nprospects  seen  in   North Asia, we find  it  unlikely  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  experience  an  upsurge  in  foreign  direct\r\n\r\ninvestments.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It further says:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'At best, the new tax measures may prevent a net decline\r\n\r\nin FDI   -  which itself is not an achievement that should be\r\n\r\nsniffed at.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Singapore watchers\r\n\r\nare guarded in their assessment of our economy restructuring.\r\n\r\nBut  having said that, I think they should, on the  contrary,\r\n\r\nspur us to explore more investment opportunities through more\r\n\r\naggressive  selling  of  Singapore through  our  EDB.    This\r\n\r\nbecomes a challenge to push us to achieve more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree that tax changes do help to bring more\r\n\r\ninvestments to our country, I am sure those who want  to  set\r\n\r\nup  businesses  here have to take into account the  political\r\n\r\nand  social security of our land.  In this respect, we should\r\n\r\nbe ahead of many countries.  In fact, I have no problems with\r\n\r\nthe  Minister allocating one-third of this Budget to  Defence\r\n\r\nand  Security.  We have to ensure that this place is safe not\r\n\r\nonly for the investor but also for his family and friends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the GST on the economy as a whole has been\r\n\r\ndiscussed  and  I  shall not go into it.  What  seems  to  be\r\n\r\ntaking  a low profile is the offsetting package for the  GST.\r\n\r\nSo,  to  sell  the  GST  better, I would  suggest  that  more\r\n\r\nemphasis be done after this Budget to bring the message home.\r\n\r\nThere are already listed at least nine ways of cushioning the\r\n\r\nGST  and  this includes the ERS shares, no GST on  subsidised\r\n\r\nmedical  care,  increased subvention to  Town  Councils,  PTC\r\n\r\nwould\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  raise  fares  in 2003, SC&C and rental rebates  for  low\r\n\r\nincome  HDB households, households with less than $3,000  can\r\n\r\napply  for  assistance from the CCC, raise public  assistance\r\n\r\nand  the  Singapore Allowance for pensioners and, finally,  a\r\n\r\nCommittee to Combat Profiteering.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to emphasise this and in order to sell our\r\n\r\nGST  better,  because  we did well in  1994.   Here,  I  must\r\n\r\ncommend NTUC Fairprice, Unity, NTUC Healthcare and NTUC  Food\r\n\r\nFare  for volunteering to absorb the 2% GST hike for at least\r\n\r\none  year  on essential items.  They deserve a pat  on  their\r\n\r\nbacks and I do hope others will follow suit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, Sir, when I talk to Singaporeans, I get a\r\n\r\nvery  gloomy picture of Singapore, somewhat depressing.  They\r\n\r\nworry  about  the  economy,  Malaysia's  recent  harsh  stand\r\n\r\nagainst us, Indonesia's response to terrorist operations  and\r\n\r\nChina's emergence as an economic force.  While I share  their\r\n\r\nconcerns, I also tell them to look on the more positive side.\r\n\r\nAll  is not lost.  Relations with Malaysia, like the economy,\r\n\r\nwill  have  its  ups  and downs.  Nothing  is  static.   Good\r\n\r\nfortunes  will  return, not by chance,  but  through  careful\r\n\r\nplanning.  We must not take things lying down, react fast  to\r\n\r\nmake  the  necessary  change, to be more  pro-active  in  our\r\n\r\napproach  to issues, and to stand our ground when challenged.\r\n\r\nI  believe  this  Budget  tries to  meet  some  of  the  more\r\n\r\nchallenging issues facing us.  Externally, a different  world\r\n\r\nand  uncertain  outlook globally and regionally;  internally,\r\n\r\nrestructuring taxes and creating jobs.  We may not  have  the\r\n\r\ncomplete  answers,  but at least we are  attempting  to  move\r\n\r\nahead.   I  wait to see the various reports of the many  sub-committees involved in the Remaking of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget. It is a good Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate be now adjourned. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Lee, resumption of debate, what\r\n\r\nday?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Tomorrow, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Twenty Five</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Minutes past Seven o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>NOT ANSWERED BY 1.30 PM</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SENIOR CITIZENS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Acting Minister for Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and  Sports what further measures  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  take  (i)  to  alleviate the sense  of  loneliness  and\r\n\r\nalienation faced by senior citizens;  and (ii) to allow  them\r\n\r\nto remain economically active.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Our  desired\r\n\r\noutcome is for every Singaporean to grow old gracefully, stay\r\n\r\nactive  and  continue to enjoy the support  of  families  and\r\n\r\nfriends in the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already a number of programmes and services,\r\n\r\ncarried   out   by   various  agencies,  to   support   older\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who are more vulnerable, for example  those  who\r\n\r\nlive  alone  or without family support.  One example  is  the\r\n\r\nbefriending  programme, where a volunteer is assigned  to  an\r\n\r\nelderly and visits him/her on a regular basis. Another is the\r\n\r\nmutual   help   scheme  where  10-15  seniors   are   grouped\r\n\r\ninformally, pursue activities of common interest and  members\r\n\r\nkeep an eye on the well-being of one another. For seniors who\r\n\r\nlive  in selected one room rental flats or studio apartments,\r\n\r\nmy   Ministry   has  set  up  senior  activity   centres   or\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood Links to help integrate them in community life.\r\n\r\nWe  will be setting up more Neighbourhood Links over the next\r\n\r\nfour years to cover more housing estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older persons need social contact and meaningful roles\r\n\r\nto  keep  them alert, active and integrated in the community.\r\n\r\nThe  programmes  and courses run by the People's  Association\r\n\r\nSenior  Citizens' Clubs and Retirees' Clubs have  contributed\r\n\r\ntowards enhancing the well-being of their participants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has also set up a $1 million a year Active\r\n\r\nSeniors  Programme to support projects that help our  seniors\r\n\r\nto  play a more active role in the community.

We  hope   these\r\n\r\ninitiatives will encourage more seniors to become  active  in\r\n\r\nthe  community.  This in turn will enable them  to  be  fully\r\n\r\nintegrated into our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continual employment of our senior workers remains a\r\n\r\nkey  challenge  to the Government.  About  a  year  ago,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Community Development and  Sports  piloted  the\r\n\r\nfirst  Golden  Manpower Centre at the Central Singapore  CDC.\r\n\r\nThe  Centre  sources  for  employment  opportunities  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity for their residents, including senior citizens  and\r\n\r\nworks  towards  changing the mindsets  of  employers  towards\r\n\r\nolder  workers. With this initial experience, the CDC is  now\r\n\r\nin  better  position to reach out to our senior citizens.  We\r\n\r\nwill  look  into sharing the Centre's experience more  widely\r\n\r\nwith  other CDCs and employment agencies, so as to strengthen\r\n\r\nour efforts to find suitable employment for our seniors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower has also implemented the People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme to help older job seekers who\r\n\r\nare  prepared  to  make a career switch across  sectors.  The\r\n\r\nprogramme provides financial support to companies to  put  in\r\n\r\nplace  traineeship arrangements to better induct and increase\r\n\r\nthe  comfort level of older workers taking on a new job in  a\r\n\r\nnew  working environment. MOM also actively promotes training\r\n\r\nand  skills  upgrading  of  older workers  under  the  Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment  Programme.  The  National  Skills  Recognition\r\n\r\nSystem  which  will be set up in more industries,  will  also\r\n\r\nprovide  modular courses to make skills upgrading easier  for\r\n\r\nolder workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EARLY MARRIAGES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman</b> asked the Acting Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Community Development and Sports (a) what is the  extent\r\n\r\nof  the  problem of early marriages; and (b) what  programmes\r\n\r\nare and will be in place to address this trend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 22,561 registered marriages in 2000, 18,550 were\r\n\r\ncivil and 4,011 were Muslim marriages. For non-Muslims, 1% of\r\n\r\ngrooms and 4% of brides married when they were below 21 years\r\n\r\nof  age.  The corresponding percentages for Muslim grooms and\r\n\r\nbrides  were  higher  -  4% and 16% respectively.   Marriages\r\n\r\ninvolving 1 teenage partner have been declining since 1980.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000,13% of female divorcees and 2% of male divorcees\r\n\r\nwere  under 20 years old when they married. The corresponding\r\n\r\nfigures  for Muslims were 22% of female divorcees and  5%  of\r\n\r\nmale divorcees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason for teenage marriages is pre-marital\r\n\r\npregnancy. They are usually forced to choose marriage to save\r\n\r\ntheir  families from embarrassment. Marriage for such couples\r\n\r\nis  often  the  start of more problems for themselves,  their\r\n\r\nchildren and families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underaged couples granted the Special Marriage Licence\r\n\r\nunder  the Women's Charter are required to attend a  workshop\r\n\r\nto  prepare  themselves  for marriage and  parenthood.  Their\r\n\r\nparents  are  advised  to support the  couple  in  their  new\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.   For  young  Malay/  Muslim  couples,  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  for  Muslim  Marriages  refers  them  to   similar\r\n\r\nmarriage preparation workshops.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February this year, the Registry of Muslim Marriages\r\n\r\nlaunched  the  Strong  Relationship for  Resilient  Community\r\n\r\nProgramme,  which  targets Muslim  teenagers.   A  series  of\r\n\r\npreventive  education  programmes will  be  launched  by  the\r\n\r\nsecond half of this year. For example, the No Apologies:  The\r\n\r\nTruth About Life, Love & Sex Programme will help youths  make\r\n\r\ninformed  life  choices.  Parents will be  taught  skills  to\r\n\r\nguide  their teenagers in the area of sexuality.  The various\r\n\r\ncommunity partners of MCDS will conduct these programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, my Ministry will continue to reach out\r\n\r\nto  teenagers through a variety of activities.  Some of these\r\n\r\ninclude  roadshows  in secondary schools, programmes  in  the\r\n\r\nmedia  on  dating,  values and responsible sexual  behaviour,\r\n\r\ndialogue sessions with teenagers, and positive messaging  via\r\n\r\nsports.  Marriage  is a personal choice.  But  we  hope  that\r\n\r\nparents and the community can play an active role in advising\r\n\r\nour  young  on  the  right choices to make  with  respect  to\r\n\r\nmarriage and the starting of a family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD FLATS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  if there are plans to ease restrictions  on  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  Housing and Development Board flats for other quiet,\r\n\r\ndesk-bound  businesses, other than the current  technopreneur\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Technopreneur Home Office (THO) Scheme,\r\n\r\naspiring technopreneurs are allowed to use their HDB flats as\r\n\r\ntheir     registered    business    address,    to    conduct\r\n\r\ninfocommunication  technology-related  work.

The Penal  Code\r\n\r\nwas  thus  amended  in  1998 to enhance  penalties  committed\r\n\r\nagainst a foreign domestic worker (FDW) by 150%.  Since then,\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  maid abuse cases has declined significantly.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  the Police, the number of substantiated  abuse\r\n\r\ncases has dropped from 157 cases in 1997 to 41 cases in 2001.\r\n\r\nThis declining trend should also be seen in the context of  a\r\n\r\nrising FDW population.
