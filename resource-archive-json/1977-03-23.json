Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member is referring\r\n\r\nto an article by a Mr William Shawcross in the Sunday\r\n\r\nTimes of London of 13th March. In answering the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember's question I am in danger of breaching  a  new\r\n\r\nconvention  which  certain sections  of  the  Western\r\n\r\nPress  have  developed in regard to criticism.  If  a\r\n\r\npressman  attacks a politician, that is free  speech.\r\n\r\nBut if the politician concerned hits back, then a hue\r\n\r\nand  cry  is raised that freedom of the press  is  in\r\n\r\nutter  jeopardy. A point that has been lost sight  of\r\n\r\nin   recent  press  criticisms  about  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment is that though we have, as a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment,  often exercised our right  to  tell  off\r\n\r\ncertain   foreign  pressmen  when   we   think   them\r\n\r\nmisguided, we have never arrested or deported any  of\r\n\r\nthem or banned their publications merely for critical\r\n\r\nand even ill-informed articles about Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have done so only when, from being mere observers\r\n\r\nand  reporters, pressmen have become active partisans\r\n\r\nin  our domestic affairs or, as a number of them did,\r\n\r\ngot  involved with subversion and the espousal of its\r\n\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to Mr William Shawcross'\r\n\r\nobservation  in the Sunday Times that the  arrest  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who have admitted to working  with  the\r\n\r\ncommunists  has  blackened Singapore's  international\r\n\r\nreputation,  it has about as much substance  as  that\r\n\r\npaper's  efforts a few years ago to sell the  Slater-Walker  team  to the world as model of  21st  century\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, Sir, the reputation of the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment has sunk rapidly in the eyes of a  handful\r\n\r\nof  British publications, like the Sunday Times,  The\r\n\r\nTimes,  the  Far  Eastern  Economic  Review  and  the\r\n\r\nEconomist.  But these publications do  not  represent\r\n\r\nworld  opinion  and our reputation  with  some  1  50\r\n\r\nnations is as sound as ever before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No government or international\r\n\r\nfinanciers  have  told us officially or  unofficially\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  lost confidence  in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  as  a  result of the  recent  arrests  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  So  I  do not know what Mr  Shawcross  is\r\n\r\ntalking about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member's second half of the question,\r\n\r\nI  am  not quite sure what the hon. Member means when\r\n\r\nhe  asks whether \"foreign correspondents resident  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  have  any  role to  play  in  the  foreign\r\n\r\nrelations  of the Republic.\" Perhaps what the  Member\r\n\r\nhas  in  mind is, to me, the astonishing  conduct  of\r\n\r\nsome  foreign newsmen in Singapore and the even  more\r\n\r\nastonishing  reaction of certain British publications\r\n\r\nto  the  arrest  and confessions of Mr  Arun  and  Mr\r\n\r\nRaman, among others. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncoverage in a number of British papers of the  public\r\n\r\nstatements  of Arun and Raman have not been  so  much\r\n\r\nfactual    reports   as   sceptical   and   selective\r\n\r\nevaluations  of  what was said by them.  The  general\r\n\r\ntenor  of  the  reports was such as to leave  in  the\r\n\r\nminds  of  their  readers the  impressions  that  the\r\n\r\nconfessions were rigged and that the people  arrested\r\n\r\nwere  not  really communists or communist  supporters\r\n\r\nbut victims of PAP intolerance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, Mr Speaker, Sir, when the foreign press was\r\n\r\ninvited  to  question Arun and Raman over  TV,  their\r\n\r\nsilence  was  deafening. If Western  pressmen  really\r\n\r\nbelieved that the whole show was stage-managed,  that\r\n\r\nthe  two gentlemen concerned had been either tortured\r\n\r\nor  terrorised  into admitting things  they  had  not\r\n\r\ndone,  then one would have thought that here  was  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  for the Western pressmen  to  expose  by\r\n\r\nsharp  and in-depth questioning of the two  that  the\r\n\r\nwhole thing was rigged. Here was an opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can think of many occasions in Europe and\r\n\r\nAmerica  when newsmen were not averse to coming  into\r\n\r\nTV  studios, were not deterred by studio  lights  and\r\n\r\nbatteries  of  TV cameras from grilling subjects  who\r\n\r\ncould  provide  them  with news and,  in  this  case,\r\n\r\nindeed most startling news had the newsmen been  able\r\n\r\nto expose these confessions as a fraud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not that we had put any kind of restraints on\r\n\r\nthe questions the newsmen could ask. There were none.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  the Chairman. Mr James Fu, had  repeatedly\r\n\r\nasked  the foreign pressmen to put questions and  all\r\n\r\nthis  was  greeted with what I can only  describe  as\r\n\r\n\"studied  silence\". Clearly, the foreign newsmen  had\r\n\r\ncome determined and convinced that the cause of press\r\n\r\nfreedom  or some other cause could best be served  by\r\n\r\nnot being provoked into asking questions. This, in my\r\n\r\nview,  is odd behaviour for men who earn their  bread\r\n\r\nand  butter  and  their reputation by asking  awkward\r\n\r\nquestions.   I  can  only  make  a  guess   at   this\r\n\r\ninexplicable lack of curiosity over confessions which\r\n\r\nhad already been portrayed by sections of the Western\r\n\r\npress as manifestations of a police state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My guess, Mr Speaker, is that the Western newsmen\r\n\r\nsensed  from  the  evidence given  to  them  that  an\r\n\r\nintense  grilling of Mr Arun and Mr Raman, far  from\r\n\r\nweakening  the  Government's case,  would  only  have\r\n\r\nstrengthened it. It would have shattered the myth  so\r\n\r\nelaborately built up in sections of the Western press\r\n\r\nthat the PAP Government was dedicated to stamping out\r\n\r\nall  dissent,  crushing all political  opponents  and\r\n\r\nbuilding up a totalitarian state. Had there  been  an\r\n\r\nintense cross-questioning by foreign pressmen of Arun\r\n\r\nand  Raman, what would have in fact emerged was  that\r\n\r\nwe had detained a journalist who had knowingly played\r\n\r\nalong   with  the  communists,  and  a  lawyer   with\r\n\r\naffiliations  with  British  Marxists,  not   averse,\r\n\r\naccording  to  Mr Raman, to using violence  to  bring\r\n\r\ndown  the  PAP  Government. Had the  Western  newsmen\r\n\r\nactively  participated in the  interview,  then  they\r\n\r\nwould  have had to report it as such and report  what\r\n\r\nactually  happened  and  that  would  have  left   an\r\n\r\nimpression  in  the minds of readers in  the  Western\r\n\r\nworld  that  the detention was justified.  So  better\r\n\r\nkeep  quiet and leave undisturbed the impression that\r\n\r\nthe  TV press conference was rigged. Hence The  Times\r\n\r\nof   18th   March   could   with   apparent   honesty\r\n\r\neditorialise as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The televised statements by Mr Raman and Mr\r\n\r\nSenkuttuvan, both  of them hollow-sounding  recitals\r\n\r\nwith  a  dictated air - by whatever means  they  were\r\n\r\nextracted ...\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, \"the whole thing is phoney. Do not\r\n\r\nquestion.  Just  report  what  you  think  happened.\"\r\n\r\nIncidentally,  Sir,  the  same  paper  dismissed  the\r\n\r\nrecent  Singapore general elections in  a  couple  of\r\n\r\nobscure  paragraphs.  It would not  have  suited  The\r\n\r\nTimes'  carefully nurtured image of a tyrannical  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment to have given importance to the fact  that\r\n\r\nit  had instead won all seats for the third time  and\r\n\r\nwith an increased majority of the votes cast. So tuck\r\n\r\nit away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, thanks to the silence of the Western\r\n\r\npressmen, the Economist of 19th March, the next  day,\r\n\r\npermitted itself this little bit of detached comment,\r\n\r\nand I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Roll up for yet another public showing of the\r\n\r\nuglier face of Singapore's police state. On March 12.\r\n\r\nthe  Government persuaded two of the men arrested ...\r\n\r\nto  confess  to the error of their ways  in  a  press\r\n\r\nconference on live television.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither of the two journals concerned mentioned the\r\n\r\npertinent  fact that the Western pressmen were  there\r\n\r\nat  the  conference and that they had  not  made  the\r\n\r\nslightest  attempt through interview to  get  at  the\r\n\r\nfacts,  to  get  at  the truth. Sir,  the  truth  had\r\n\r\nalready  been arrived at before the press  conference\r\n\r\nin  the editorial offices in London and any fresh and\r\n\r\nconflicting evidence would be most unwelcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the PAP Government and the voters of Singapore\r\n\r\nappear to be adamant in doing what they think is good\r\n\r\nfor Singapore, the Sunday Times and Mr Shawcross have\r\n\r\nnow  carried  British  journalism  into  the  murkier\r\n\r\ngrounds  of blackmail. Since they cannot persuade  us\r\n\r\nby  threats,  what  about  blackmail.  So  he  warned\r\n\r\nSingapore that (and I quote):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"as Singapore depends on the international money\r\n\r\nmarket  for  its prosperity (the arrests)  can  prove\r\n\r\ncounterproductive.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Telling us if we do not do what they say we must  do,\r\n\r\nno more investments. That is how I read it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shawcross wants us to believe that were Singapore\r\n\r\nto  release known and self-confessed Communists, stop\r\n\r\nbroadcasting  revelations  by  Communists  and   pro-Communists  how they go about their furtive  business\r\n\r\nof  subversion,  give immunity to  those  who,  under\r\n\r\ncover  of  free speech, breach the laws of libel  and\r\n\r\nslander  and  scrap the detention laws for  which  we\r\n\r\nhave popular mandate then, according to Mr Shawcross,\r\n\r\nforeign  investors would be streaming into Singapore,\r\n\r\npockets full of money and with joy in their hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps Mr Shawcross has a pretty low opinion of\r\n\r\nAsian   intelligence  and  especially  of   Singapore\r\n\r\nintelligence. On the contrary it is because  we  have\r\n\r\nnot  been following Mr Shawcross' advice that foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors  have shown a growing interest in Singapore\r\n\r\nand increasing nervousness about those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountries  where  the remedies Mr Shawcross  suggests\r\n\r\nhave been applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have my own views as to why\r\n\r\ncertain  sections  of  the  Western  press,  and   in\r\n\r\nparticular  the British press, are going  beyond  the\r\n\r\nbounds  of  journalism  to pressurise  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment into adopting policies which the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  know  would  bring back  the  lawlessness,\r\n\r\nviolence, rioting, and economic stagnation which were\r\n\r\nfeatures when the Communists and pro-Communists  were\r\n\r\nallowed  to  run  around. The  Western  press  knows,\r\n\r\nincluding the Western pressmen here, that we are  not\r\n\r\ncrushing  opposition. In the recent  elections  there\r\n\r\nwere  any  number  of parties. We  are  not  crushing\r\n\r\nopposition  which  is lawful and  constitutional  but\r\n\r\nCommunist opposition which is unlawful, and  for  the\r\n\r\nsuppression  of which we have full mandate  from  the\r\n\r\npeople.  And yet they go back, even now, and  say  we\r\n\r\nare crushing opposition, never saying we are crushing\r\n\r\nCommunist opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, under the pretence of upholding\r\n\r\nhuman rights and democracy in darkest Singapore, what\r\n\r\nthis  section of the press, of the British  press  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  is agitating for through distortion  and\r\n\r\neven  blackmail  is  rights for Communists  and  pro-Communists  to  run  around once again  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nknowing full well what the consequences would be  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it that they want a revival of the old Singapore?\r\n\r\nWhy  is the press doing this? Well, Mr Speaker,  that\r\n\r\nis  another story for some other time. Are  then  the\r\n\r\nforeign correspondents resident in Singapore suspect?\r\n\r\nIn my view, and I know many of them, most of them are\r\n\r\njust   being   straightforward  newsmen.   But   some\r\n\r\npresumably  are specially selected by their  editors,\r\n\r\nincluding  local  journalists,  for  more  than  mere\r\n\r\nreporting.  For example, Mr Derek Davies of  the  Far\r\n\r\nEastern  Economic Review has a flair  (it  must  have\r\n\r\nbeen a well developed one, a very unusual flair)  for\r\n\r\nchoosing local malcontents for correspondents. I must\r\n\r\nassume  that  Mr Davies has carefully assessed  their\r\n\r\ncharacter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore  appointing them. He must therefore know  that\r\n\r\nhe  will  get biased, blunted and false reports  from\r\n\r\nthem.  Mr Speaker, you may recollect a British  press\r\n\r\nbaron,  Lord Northcliffe, if I am right, who said  he\r\n\r\nnever  had  to tell his editor what to write  because\r\n\r\nthe  man  he  chose made this unnecessary.  Or  as  a\r\n\r\nBritish poet put it more pungently (and I quote):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>                          \r\n\r\n `You cannot, thank God\r\n\r\n Bribe or twist\r\n\r\n A British journalist\r\n\r\n But seeing what the fellow will do\r\n\r\n Unbribed\r\n\r\n There's no occasion to.'\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lau Teik Soon (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I wish to ask a supplementary question.

(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng\r\n\r\nKah Ting).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the main function of the Urban and\r\n\r\nRural  Services  Committee  is  to  look  after   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the rural areas in Singapore. Over the\r\n\r\npast decade the URSC has been quite successful in the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the rural areas in Singapore. This\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nachievement  has  helped to improve the  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving  of  the  rural  people by  the  provision  of\r\n\r\nelectricity,  better  roads, water  supply,  etc.  In\r\n\r\nother words, the URSC has brought to the rural people\r\n\r\nmodern facilities in their environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding this achievement I\r\n\r\nnotice from the provision that there is a sum of only\r\n\r\n$3.94 million for expenditure on so many rural areas.\r\n\r\nThis  is  obviously insufficient and it is less  than\r\n\r\nthe  provision for last year. We should increase this\r\n\r\nprovision  so  that  the  various  construction   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment work in the rural areas can be  proceeded\r\n\r\nwith more expeditiously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I visit my constituents very often. In the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  my  visits I notice  that  some  recently\r\n\r\nconstructed roads have a lot of potholes and  driving\r\n\r\nbecomes rather bumpy, so soon after the completion of\r\n\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the reason for this? Sir, I think this is\r\n\r\nbecause  supervision of the work has not been carried\r\n\r\nout  thoroughly.  As  a  result  of  lack  of  proper\r\n\r\nsupervision, unethical and irresponsible  contractors\r\n\r\nhave  provided bad services at the expense of  public\r\n\r\nmoney.  In  other words there have been malpractices.\r\n\r\nThey have failed to construct the roads according  to\r\n\r\nproper   specifications.  As  a  result,  the   roads\r\n\r\ndeteriorate  more rapidly than expected.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nwaste of public funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand. Sir,I have also noticed that\r\n\r\nroads  built under the gotong royong scheme are  much\r\n\r\nbetter  than  those  built by the  contractors.  Even\r\n\r\nafter  several  years of use, these roads  are  still\r\n\r\ngood.  So  I  would like to propose that, where  road\r\n\r\nconstruction is concerned, whether the job is big  or\r\n\r\nsmall, we should encourage more people to participate\r\n\r\nin  gotong  royong rather than leaving this  work  of\r\n\r\nroad  construction  entirely to contractors.  By  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of  gotong royong, we will be  able  to  save\r\n\r\ncosts  and  use the savings to construct still  more.\r\n\r\nwithin the limited supply of funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, MPs representing the\r\n\r\nrural areas welcome the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovision  of  $3.94  million  for  urban  and  rural\r\n\r\nservices.

Would  not  the  URSC\r\n\r\nconsider resurfacing them?

The  Member\r\n\r\nfor   Sembawang  has  said  that  after   repair   of\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  roads in the rural  areas,  further\r\n\r\nrepairs  often become necessary and he has  expressed\r\n\r\nthe  view  that  this was due to the lack  of  strict\r\n\r\nsupervision.  As  a  matter of fact,  Sir,  all  road\r\n\r\nconstruction undertaken by contractors is  supervised\r\n\r\nby  officers  of  the  Public Works  Department  very\r\n\r\nstrictly. There is no need for us to worry about this\r\n\r\naspect. Furthermore, Sir, it is also written in every\r\n\r\ntender   contract  that  for  the  first  six  months\r\n\r\ncontractors are held responsible for any  defects  or\r\n\r\ndisrepair of the road after completion. The  crux  of\r\n\r\nthe matter is that the newly completed metalled roads\r\n\r\nvery  often attract a lot more vehicles. As a  result\r\n\r\nof  excessive  use  of such roads,  the  neighbouring\r\n\r\nrural roads are also affected\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  become  damaged. As soon as  the  URSC  has  got\r\n\r\ninformation of such a state of affairs, the PWD  will\r\n\r\nbe  told  to  carry out immediate repairs to  prevent\r\n\r\nfurther deterioration of the roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also suggested that we\r\n\r\nshould  encourage more people to participate in  road\r\n\r\nconstruction  under the gotong royong  scheme.  As  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of fact, Sir, this has always been encouraged\r\n\r\nby  the  URSC.  In  1976 alone,  in  Chua  Chu  Kang.\r\n\r\nPunggol, Nee Soon, Jurong, Tampines and Kampong  Chai\r\n\r\nChee, we launched a gotong royong campaign for  road\r\n\r\nconstruction in these areas. As a result, 18  rural\r\n\r\nroads  were  repaired  or  improved  at  a  cost   of\r\n\r\n$638,000.  All  these  road  construction  works  and\r\n\r\nimprovement  were  completed according  to  schedule.\r\n\r\nHere,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I would like to  express  my\r\n\r\nthanks  on behalf of the Government to all the  rural\r\n\r\npeople, the CCC, the MPs, national servicemen and the\r\n\r\nundergraduates of higher institutions of learning for\r\n\r\ntheir  participation in these gotong royong projects.\r\n\r\nSir, I can assure the Member for Sembawang that these\r\n\r\ncollective gotong royong projects will continue to be\r\n\r\nencouraged by the Government and will receive all the\r\n\r\nnecessary support of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also asked for an\r\n\r\nincrease in the provision of funds for the URSC. As a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  fact, Sir, over the past few  years,  the\r\n\r\nUrban  and  Rural Services Committee has  been  given\r\n\r\nincreasing  funds from year to year. For example,  in\r\n\r\nFY  1974-75, the  provision for the  URSC  was  $3.3\r\n\r\nmillion  whereas  in  FY  75-76  the  provision   was\r\n\r\nincreased  to $3.6 million. There was an increase  of\r\n\r\n9.8%.  In  FY 76-77, the provision was $3.98 million,\r\n\r\nan increase of 9.7%. For the new financial year of 77-78,  the provision is $3.94 million. This may  appear\r\n\r\nto  be slightly less than the previous provision but,\r\n\r\nin actual fact, it is not so. I say so because in the\r\n\r\nprevious provisions for the URSC there was included a\r\n\r\nsum  of  $1  million  for the improvement  of  street\r\n\r\nlighting in the urban areas, and this amount has  now\r\n\r\nbeen  transferred  to  the PWD fund  from  the  total\r\n\r\nallocation to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nURSC.  So  if  we were to include the $1 million  for\r\n\r\nstreet  lighting improvement in the city  area,  then\r\n\r\nthe total allocation can be said to have increased by\r\n\r\n25% over the previous year's provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the view expressed by\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member for Punggol that the U  RSC  annual\r\n\r\nallocation  of  funds  can  only  be  used  for   the\r\n\r\nimprovement  of public amenities within  the  various\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  As  regards the  work  for  the  new\r\n\r\nresettlement areas, such as the resettlement area  in\r\n\r\nJalan Kayu and Punggol, the pig farms, etc., the URSC\r\n\r\nwill  very  soon make a careful study and  survey  of\r\n\r\nthese  two Constituencies to understand and  to  find\r\n\r\nout  which public facilities need further improvement\r\n\r\nor greater attention. At the same time, the URSC will\r\n\r\nalso make an estimate of the amount of money required\r\n\r\nfor  these facilities and action will be taken to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Finance for the  appropriation  of\r\n\r\nfunds. So the hon. Member can rest assured about this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the matter raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nPunggol  that  the street lights in the  rural  areas\r\n\r\nprovided by the URSC are not bright enough and should\r\n\r\nbe improved, my answer is that his criticism is quite\r\n\r\ncorrect.  As  a  matter of fact, Sir, the  Urban  and\r\n\r\nRural  Services Committee as far back as three  years\r\n\r\nago,  looked  into this matter very  carefully.  But,\r\n\r\nbecause  in certain rural areas there were  still  no\r\n\r\nstreet  lights  available, so they  could  not  as  a\r\n\r\nmatter of priority improve on the lighting conditions\r\n\r\nof the earlier existing lamps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, because most of the roads in the rural areas\r\n\r\nare  equipped  with street lights, the  URSC  is  now\r\n\r\nready  to  do something to improve the poor lighting.\r\n\r\nIn the past the street lights installed in some rural\r\n\r\nareas  were 100 watt metal filament lamps.  That  was\r\n\r\none  type. The other type was the 40 watt flourescent\r\n\r\ntubes.  The  common  feature of these  two  types  of\r\n\r\nlighting  is  that they will only last two  to  three\r\n\r\nmonths. The maintenance cost therefore is very  high.\r\n\r\nThree   years  ago  the  Urban  and  Rural   Services\r\n\r\nCommittee on an experimental\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbasis  used the 125 watt high pressure mercury vapour\r\n\r\nlamps and they found that this kind of light was much\r\n\r\nbetter.  They find that the new type was eight  times\r\n\r\nbrighter than the old ones and they could last two to\r\n\r\nthree  years.  This  means a greater  consumption  of\r\n\r\nelectricity.  The  URSC has decided  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nexisting lamps gradually over the next few years.  In\r\n\r\nthe  more  densely populated areas or in areas  where\r\n\r\nthere  are community centres, priority will be  given\r\n\r\nin the replacement of old lamps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the rural roads built earlier are found to be in\r\n\r\na  very serious state of disrepair, the URSC is  ever\r\n\r\nready  to consider taking immediate action to  repair\r\n\r\nsuch  roads  as  soon  as possible.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nPunggol  wanted to know the work of the URSC  in  the\r\n\r\npast  14  years from 1963 to 1976, in the improvement\r\n\r\nof  public  facilities in the rural and urban  areas.\r\n\r\nOver  the  14 years, the URSC has spent  a  total  of\r\n\r\n$48,144  million for the improvement  of  the  living\r\n\r\nenvironment of the rural people. This amount of money\r\n\r\nhad  been  spent on the provisions for the  following\r\n\r\nseparate   items:   First,  on   rural   roads,   the\r\n\r\nexpenditure  amounted to $15.691 million. Second, the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  street lighting which  took  up  $8.96\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the provision of water pipes $6.288 million,\r\n\r\nunder   this  scheme  11,542  households  have   been\r\n\r\nprovided with water supply. That is to say, more than\r\n\r\n103,800   people  have  benefitted.   Fourth, rural\r\n\r\nelectrification  scheme which was completed  by  1972\r\n\r\naccounted  for  $13.624 million, benefitting  about  1\r\n\r\n62,000  people  involving  about  23,000  households.\r\n\r\nFifth,  improvement of jetties and other works $3.551\r\n\r\nmillion. All these facts and figures show that of the\r\n\r\n$48.144 million mentioned earlier, about 74%  of  the\r\n\r\nmoney  was spent on rural constituencies. This  shows\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  has  done  a  great  deal   in\r\n\r\nimproving the living conditions of the people in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas.  Nothwithstanding what  we  have  done.\r\n\r\nthere  is  still room in the rural areas which  merit\r\n\r\nfurther consideration and attention from the URSC and\r\n\r\nfurther efforts will be made to improve such areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 16th of this month when the House was\r\n\r\ndebating  the estimates for the Ministry of  Culture.\r\n\r\nthe Member for Boon Lay raised the question as to why\r\n\r\nthe  URSC  had not held press conferences as  in  the\r\n\r\npast.  I would like to take this opportunity to  give\r\n\r\nhim a brief reply. In the past, because the Urban and\r\n\r\nRural Services Committee was just a newly established\r\n\r\nGovernment  agency, the people in Singapore  did  not\r\n\r\nquite  understand the objectives, plans and the  work\r\n\r\nprocedure  adopted by the URSC. There  was  therefore\r\n\r\nthe  necessity for frequent press conferences  to  be\r\n\r\nheld to keep the people informed of the detailed work-objectives,  the procedure and development  plans  of\r\n\r\nthe  URSC.  After  several years of  work  the  rural\r\n\r\npeople have improved in their living conditions.  The\r\n\r\nliving  environment  in  the  rural  areas  has  been\r\n\r\nimproving  all  the time. The people  not  only  have\r\n\r\nbetter  roads,  brighter lights but they  also  enjoy\r\n\r\nmodern  living facilities. Subsequently, we have  the\r\n\r\nCitizens'  Consultative Committees and the Management\r\n\r\nCommittees of Community Centres set up in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.  The  URSC  has often come  into  contact  and\r\n\r\nliaise  with such committees. The needs were  brought\r\n\r\nto  the  attention of the Government and  the  people\r\n\r\nalso  know  what  the Government is doing  for  them.\r\n\r\nUnder  the circumstances there is no longer the  need\r\n\r\nto hold press conferences which would be amounting to\r\n\r\ndrawing  a  snake  and adding legs to  it, which  is\r\n\r\nunnecessary. The more important thing for the URSC is\r\n\r\nto  keep  on  with its effort to improve  the  living\r\n\r\nconditions of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary has given me a  satisfactory\r\n\r\nanswer, and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nbeg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of subhead AAA 8201.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, I am taking the opportunity\r\n\r\nto enquire from the Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  to  when  the Housing and Development Board  will\r\n\r\ndevelop Ah Hood Road vicinity. It was some years  ago\r\n\r\nwhen  land was acquired by the HDB after fire  gutted\r\n\r\nsome  of the huts there. Since then no concrete steps\r\n\r\nwere  taken to expedite the development of the  area.\r\n\r\nResidents  staying there are not allowed to  renovate\r\n\r\ntheir   present  huts.  Some  of  them   want   early\r\n\r\nresettlement but were told to wait. The question  is.\r\n\r\nhow  long  do  they have to wait? As  the  Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament for the area, it is natural that I  should\r\n\r\nwant  to see, despite some of the criticisms that  my\r\n\r\nfellow  Members of Parliament have to say  about  the\r\n\r\ndesigns and qualities of the HDB flats, a nice little\r\n\r\nhousing  estate,  with pleasant surroundings  in  the\r\n\r\narea  rather than to see the present dilapidated  old\r\n\r\nhuts in such deplorable surroundings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be opportune for me at this time to suggest\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  development scheme for  the  area  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development  Board  should  take   into\r\n\r\naccount  two factors: (1) There is already  a  fairly\r\n\r\nlarge  scale  development of  private  flats  in  the\r\n\r\nadjoining   areas.  This  definitely  adds   to   the\r\n\r\npopulation  density in and around  the  area.  It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  important that sufficient open  space  and\r\n\r\nrecreational facilities be provided. (2)      Because\r\n\r\nof the very large number of households in the area it\r\n\r\nis very necessary to build a market there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W.

Many families have  to  move\r\n\r\nout from Punggol to make way for the pig farmers from\r\n\r\nChua  Chu  Kang  and Kranji catchment  areas.  I  had\r\n\r\nappealed  that  the  approach  to  this  resettlement\r\n\r\nshould  be  more  humane and  sympathetic  so  as  to\r\n\r\nalleviate  the  bitterness  on  the  part  of   those\r\n\r\nfamilies  concerned. Those who had to move  out  were\r\n\r\nnot  given sufficient time to do so and were to  some\r\n\r\nextent often harassed. They complained that they were\r\n\r\nnot  given the opportunity to purchase flats of their\r\n\r\nchoice  on  grounds that these flats are  not  ready.\r\n\r\nTake,  for  example,  the Punggol  estate  which  was\r\n\r\ndeveloped  in two phases. Phase I has been  completed\r\n\r\nand  Phase II is nearing completion. The result, they\r\n\r\nhave  to rent flats first in those offered for rental\r\n\r\nin Punggol Estate Phase I and await completion of the\r\n\r\nnew flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reinforce my assertion, may I inform the House\r\n\r\nand  the  Minister concerned that I  have  about  103\r\n\r\nresettled  families (from Punggol) in Punggol  Estate\r\n\r\nwaiting  to purchase their flats in the said  Estate,\r\n\r\nwhich  will be due for balloting at the end  of  this\r\n\r\nmonth.  My  question  is  why  the  HDB  resettlement\r\n\r\ndepartment did not encourage these affected  families\r\n\r\nto  accept  other estates where flats are  ready  for\r\n\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the relocation of farmers from the catchment\r\n\r\nareas to the non-catchment areas. I have visited them\r\n\r\non  several occasions and held discussions with them.\r\n\r\nThey complained to me that they were told to move out\r\n\r\nsoonest  possible  because their  farms  are  causing\r\n\r\npollution  to  the Kranji Reservoir. They  agreed  to\r\n\r\ncooperate  in  the national interest, but  when  they\r\n\r\ncame to see the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfarming lots allocated, they noted that they  had  to\r\n\r\nstart life anew because they had to set up new farms.\r\n\r\nThey  accept  this and I am proud of them.  But  they\r\n\r\npointed  out  that  apart from the barest  facilities\r\n\r\nprovided, they need time to settle down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had to spend a lot of money to do so. Moreover,\r\n\r\nthey had to borrow money to set up their farm, as the\r\n\r\nso-called enhanced compensation could not be paid  to\r\n\r\nthem  earlier. I mentioned that in some  cases,  they\r\n\r\nhave  been resettled as many as four times. Therefore\r\n\r\nthe  uprooting of these families has made the  ground\r\n\r\nbitter. I must urge the Hon. Minister concerned  that\r\n\r\nhis  department should henceforth be more humane  and\r\n\r\nsympathetic in its approach towards resettlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, the Government is\r\n\r\nappreciative of the understanding of these  resettled\r\n\r\nfamilies in the importance of water and the  need  to\r\n\r\nmove  them out from the catchment area. The  Ministry\r\n\r\ndoes  not  believe  that the Resettlement  Department\r\n\r\nwould  really harass the families concerned in  order\r\n\r\nto achieve its objectives but, if it pleases the hon.\r\n\r\nMember,   we  can  perhaps  advise  the  Resettlement\r\n\r\nDepartment  to be more persuasive in its approach.  I\r\n\r\nam  surprised  at  the  incidence  quoted  where  the\r\n\r\nResettlement  Department did not try to persuade  the\r\n\r\n103  resettled  families to other areas.  The  likely\r\n\r\nreason  would be that there are available flats,  for\r\n\r\nexample, in Bedok, Ang Mo Kio and even as far away as\r\n\r\nWoodlands,  but  the families have been  so  used  to\r\n\r\nPunggol and the good efforts done by the MP that they\r\n\r\nchoose  to  stay in Punggol. So they would prefer  to\r\n\r\nrent  the  flats at Punggol Estate I and do not  mind\r\n\r\nwaiting to purchase the flats at Punggol Estate II. I\r\n\r\nthink that is more likely the reason and not the fact\r\n\r\nthat  the HDB's Resettlement Department had not given\r\n\r\nthem any alternative accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his query on the need to be more humane and\r\n\r\nsympathetic  to  alleviate the  bitterness  of  these\r\n\r\npeople concerned, we share his sentiments and  I  can\r\n\r\nonly  reiterate  by saying that we could  advise  the\r\n\r\nResettlement Department to be more persuasive in  its\r\n\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original time given for those to resettle from\r\n\r\nthe  Kranji  catchment area was much  shorter  and  I\r\n\r\nthink,  due  to the urgency of the project,  extended\r\n\r\ntime  was  given to allow them to move out  from  the\r\n\r\ncatchment area. Similarly. I suppose the same reasons\r\n\r\nare  applicable  to Punggol where the  families  have\r\n\r\nbeen  resettled  outside  so  as  to  make  the  land\r\n\r\navailable  to  resettle those pig  farmers  from  the\r\n\r\ncatchment area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> In view of the assurance from the\r\n\r\nSenior   Minister  of  State  that   his   department\r\n\r\nconcerned would be more humane and sympathetic, I beg\r\n\r\nleave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I would just  like  to  make  the\r\n\r\npoint  that  if  we must go ahead, I think  an  early\r\n\r\ndecision  should  be  made because  any  delay  means\r\n\r\nfurther costs and this Government is, as we all know,\r\n\r\nvery cost-conscious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, the Singapore Mass Transit\r\n\r\nStudy  was  undertaken in two  phases.  In  Phase  I,\r\n\r\nvarious mass transit systems including both the  all-bus  and the bus-rail systems were examined. Phase  I\r\n\r\nwas  completed  in early 1974 with the recommendation\r\n\r\nto study in greater detail a bus-rail system and this\r\n\r\nwas  carried out in Phase II. Both phases of the  MTS\r\n\r\nwere undertaken by a firm of consultants appointed by\r\n\r\nthe  World Bank which acted as executing agencies for\r\n\r\nthe  UNDP. To assure the hon. Member for Anson, local\r\n\r\ncounterpart  staff  were attached  to  the  MTS  Unit\r\n\r\nthroughout the feasibility study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Phase II study was completed by the consultants\r\n\r\nin  March  1976 and the draft final report which  was\r\n\r\nsubmitted  by the consultants is now under review  by\r\n\r\nthe  World  Bank. The consultants had concluded  that\r\n\r\nthe  rail-base  mass  transit system  is  technically\r\n\r\nfeasible.  The  World Bank, however, has  taken  some\r\n\r\ntime for their review because of the many factors  to\r\n\r\nbe considered, including a close scrutiny of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbases  and assumptions used in this study. The  World\r\n\r\nBank  has indicated that the review will be finalised\r\n\r\nshortly.  My colleague, the Senior Minister of  State\r\n\r\nfor  Communications is still extremely interested  in\r\n\r\nthis  project and he has just told me that  they  are\r\n\r\npursuing the report of the World Bank very closely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Minister has just been to Hong Kong but it was on\r\n\r\nan  unofficial  visit.

All the pig sties are in single-storeys and in\r\n\r\nrows.  The  pigs have to drink water and also  to  be\r\n\r\nwatered. Therefore, several pig farmers encounter the\r\n\r\ndifficulty  of locating water through the digging  of\r\n\r\nwells.  The costs for well-digging range from  $5,000\r\n\r\nto  $40,000 depending on the size, capacity and depth\r\n\r\nof the well. Sometimes, several places have to be dug\r\n\r\nbefore  water  can be found. In this respect,  may  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that the Department concerned look into  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of carrying out hydrographical  surveys  of\r\n\r\nthese   farmlands  and  make  use  of  the  necessary\r\n\r\nequipment to assist the farmers in locating water  so\r\n\r\nas to cut down cost in well-digging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem, Sir, concerns those farmers who\r\n\r\nhave  been allowed to remain where they are. Most  of\r\n\r\nthem  are poultry farmers. I have received complaints\r\n\r\nfrom  a  number  of  them stating  that  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department has asked them to indicate when\r\n\r\nthey  would convert to pig farming. (I have seen such\r\n\r\nforms relating to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis).  These  farmers tell me that  they  have  been\r\n\r\ncarrying out poultry farming activity practically all\r\n\r\ntheir  lives and that they do not know anything about\r\n\r\npig   farming.  I  believe  that  there  is  a  great\r\n\r\ndifference between pig and poultry farming. And  when\r\n\r\nI  checked  up with the department concerned,  I  was\r\n\r\ntold  that  the  areas have been designated  for  pig\r\n\r\nfarming.  I therefore cannot understand the rationale\r\n\r\nin allowing the retention of the poultry farms in the\r\n\r\nfirst  instance.  It may well be  that  because  they\r\n\r\ncomply  with  certain requirements laid down  by  the\r\n\r\ndepartment  concerned  they were  allowed  to  remain\r\n\r\nwhere  they  are.  I  think the department  concerned\r\n\r\nshould have considered the question of loss of income\r\n\r\nto  these  poultry farmers in the first  place.  They\r\n\r\nshould also note the costs involved in the setting up\r\n\r\nof pig farms, which are different from poultry farms,\r\n\r\nwhilst  not  forgetting the fact that  these  poultry\r\n\r\nfarmers may have to be retrained for pig farming.  As\r\n\r\nsuch,   they  also  have  to  incur  extra  financial\r\n\r\nresources.   In  this  light,  could  the  department\r\n\r\nconcerned   offer   them  financial   assistance?   I\r\n\r\nsincerely hope that the Minister would enlighten  the\r\n\r\nHouse on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point I wish to touch on, Sir, concerns\r\n\r\nthose  farmlands which are situated on higher ground.\r\n\r\nI am told that some farmers have rejected them on the\r\n\r\nground  that  there is no water in the area.  It  may\r\n\r\nwell  be  that if they should move there, they  would\r\n\r\nhave to dig deeper into the ground to reach the water\r\n\r\ntable.   In  this  case,  may  I  suggest  that   the\r\n\r\ndepartment  concerned should consider  allowing  such\r\n\r\nlands to be used for poultry farming instead as  this\r\n\r\nwill  mean that there is optimal utilisation of lands\r\n\r\navailable for farming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction   Department   is   not   an   expert   in\r\n\r\nhydrographical  surveys such  as  the  detection  and\r\n\r\ndigging of wells. If I remember correctly, there  are\r\n\r\nfirms  which specialise on this. In fact, some  firms\r\n\r\nalso give guarantee that if no water is detected  you\r\n\r\ndo not have to pay any money at all. I think it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbest left to the private sector to do that type of\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Punggol area was extensively acquired by\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  the sole purpose of  resettling  the\r\n\r\naffected pig farmers from the Kranji catchment  area,\r\n\r\nso that Punggol, being a non-catchment area, could be\r\n\r\nmade into the place for pig-rearing in Singapore. The\r\n\r\n62  poultry  farmers were retained on  the  condition\r\n\r\nthat  they should be prepared to switch over to  pig-farming.  The criterion used was to allow any  farmer\r\n\r\nwith  more than 3,000 birds to stay. I am sympathetic\r\n\r\nwith those who have to switch from poultry farming to\r\n\r\npig farming as it involves some costs but the PPD has\r\n\r\nreally  no  money  to  help them  in  financing  this\r\n\r\ntransaction. But due to the representations  made  by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Punggol on the plight of these poultry\r\n\r\nfarmers, the Primary Production Department has  given\r\n\r\nthem a grace period to switch over. Instead of asking\r\n\r\nthem  to resettle elsewhere immediately, the PPD  has\r\n\r\nindicated that farmers will be given three  years  to\r\n\r\nswitch from poultry farming to pig farming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that certain parts of Punggol are high\r\n\r\nland where pig farming in the conventional sense  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  attractive. But we have figures to  indicate\r\n\r\nthat  even  in these high lands, where PUB  water  is\r\n\r\navailable,  and using modern commercial  methods  the\r\n\r\ntotal  cost  of  water per pig after slaughtering  is\r\n\r\nonly $4. However, we are prepared to concede that  if\r\n\r\ncertain plots in these high lands are not taken up by\r\n\r\npig  farmers,  then  when the  time  comes,  we  will\r\n\r\nconsider converting it into poultry farming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I thank the Senior Minister of\r\n\r\nState for his kind remarks.

(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Dr Ong\r\n\r\nLeong Boon.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a remarkable improvement in our bus\r\n\r\nservice over the last few years. For one thing, rude\r\n\r\nconductors,  smoky  buses, infrequent  services  are\r\n\r\nthings  of  the  past,  with  some  exceptions.   The\r\n\r\nimprovement  has been made possible  because  of  the\r\n\r\naction taken by the Government Team of Officials\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been  seconded to the SBS.  However,  the\r\n\r\nauthorities  still  have to look after  some  of  the\r\n\r\nminor  problems  which still exist. It  is  a  common\r\n\r\nsight to see buses speeding, especially at night  and\r\n\r\nalso at rural areas throughout the day. Some even  go\r\n\r\nagainst  the traffic lights and practically  bulldoze\r\n\r\ntheir  way  through traffic. Obviously  most  of  the\r\n\r\ndrivers  hold the maxim that \"might is right\".  There\r\n\r\nare  some  drivers who on the pretext  of  overtaking\r\n\r\nother  vehicles do not care to halt at scheduled  bus\r\n\r\nstops,  even  though  the  commuters  who  have  been\r\n\r\npatiently waiting for that particular service, signal\r\n\r\nthe  bus  to stop. This normally happens outside  the\r\n\r\npeak periods when there are fewer inspectors around.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has also been a remarkable improvement in\r\n\r\nthe  condition of buses. However, on rainy days  many\r\n\r\nbuses, both old and even some of the newer ones, seem\r\n\r\nto  leak  from the top and also from the windscreens.\r\n\r\nThus,  seats are wet and commuters have to  stand  up\r\n\r\nand  dodge  the  rain water that  splashes  into  the\r\n\r\nbuses.  I wonder whether the SBS carries out periodic\r\n\r\nchecks to see that the buses do not leak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of the bus services from housing estates\r\n\r\ndo  not  cater  for services to places all  over  the\r\n\r\nisland.  For  instance, there is no  service  running\r\n\r\ndirect from Marine Parade to Telok Blangah via Keppel\r\n\r\nRoad.  In  fact, in Keppel, Telok Blangah  and  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang Roads, there are many offices and yet no  bus\r\n\r\nservice  has  been considered. Even  before  the  bus\r\n\r\nservice  was reorganised there was a service  running\r\n\r\nfrom  Cantonment Road turning to Keppel Road to Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang. But now there is no such service. It appears\r\n\r\ncommuters  have to change buses to go  through  these\r\n\r\nroutes. This would then cost them an extra fare.  Why\r\n\r\nnot  introduce direct services running through  these\r\n\r\nroutes, because  I have received complaints  from  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of workers whose place of work is at  Keppel,\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah  and Pasir Panjang  Roads.  Could  the\r\n\r\nMinister look into this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SBS also seems to have certain rules just to\r\n\r\nsuit its conductors. They refuse to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccept  Malaysian coins. Yet they do not mind  giving\r\n\r\nthem for the return change and tell off the commuters\r\n\r\nif they refuse to accept Malaysian coins. What is the\r\n\r\nguideline on this matter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city shuttle service is performing a very good\r\n\r\nservice  to  the public, though the reasons  for  the\r\n\r\nintroduction   of   this  service   have   completely\r\n\r\noverlapped  their original functions. Why not  extend\r\n\r\nthe  hours  and  the terminal points of  the  shuttle\r\n\r\nservice?  This  will  in a way  improve  further  our\r\n\r\ntransport service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scheme B service is also providing a useful\r\n\r\nsupplementary service during the peak hours. When  it\r\n\r\nwas introduced it was praised as clean and efficient.\r\n\r\nYet  lately  the service seems to have  deteriorated,\r\n\r\nlike  running  the  service with  no  proper  timing,\r\n\r\nchanging directions at their discretion and buses not\r\n\r\nas tidy as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present there are about 7,000 taxis. Yet\r\n\r\nthis  number  seems to be insufficient  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nneeds of the public. At times, it is difficult to get\r\n\r\na  taxi  at many places in the city area and also  in\r\n\r\nthe outskirts of town. It is time the number of taxis\r\n\r\nwas  increased. We should also see that they are  run\r\n\r\nefficiently so that more people will give up the idea\r\n\r\nof  owning  cars. At present, some people  are  still\r\n\r\nreluctant  to give up their cars simply  because  our\r\n\r\nbus  service  has not improved sufficiently  and  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty of getting taxis for commuting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, turning to the subject of telephones, though we\r\n\r\nare  proud  that many new lines have been introduced,\r\n\r\nyet  there seems to be too many complaints of getting\r\n\r\nthrough   the   main   lines   of   most   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments. At times, even the police 999  emergency\r\n\r\nline  is difficult to get through. What would  happen\r\n\r\nwhen  there  are  serious  crimes?  Because  of  poor\r\n\r\ncommunication, they may not be solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At times, when we get through the line, we could\r\n\r\nhear  the ringing but no one would answer for a  long\r\n\r\ntime. Sometimes we hear wonderful opera music on  the\r\n\r\nphone when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  are dialling. And also very often we get crossed-lines. Why is this so? The telephone exchanges of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments must definitely  be  improved\r\n\r\nfor   the  benefit  of  the  public,  especially  the\r\n\r\nbusinessmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Hon. Minister will reply to my\r\n\r\nqueries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some\r\n\r\nyears  ago  a  campaign on queuing-up for  buses  was\r\n\r\nunsuccessfully  launched  in  Singapore.   I   wonder\r\n\r\nwhether the Ministry had analysed the failure of that\r\n\r\ncampaign  and whether or not another similar campaign\r\n\r\nwill be launched to instill in the minds of commuters\r\n\r\nthat  a sense of discipline must be developed in  bus\r\n\r\nstops situated in heavy traffic routes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During peak hours, commuters comprising office\r\n\r\nworkers,  school children and other bus users  gather\r\n\r\nin large numbers at bus stops. In such circumstances,\r\n\r\nbuses  packed  with  passengers are  frequently  seen\r\n\r\novershooting   such  bus  stops  to   allow   certain\r\n\r\ncommuters  to  disembark.  This  has  caused  waiting\r\n\r\ncommuters  to  run, rush and worst of  all,  scramble\r\n\r\ntheir  way  into  these buses which have  hardly  any\r\n\r\nstanding  room left. Obviously, there is overcrowding\r\n\r\nin  the  buses. Accidents can happen during this  mad\r\n\r\nscramble.  I  can  imagine that these  commuters  are\r\n\r\nlosing their patience after a long wait for buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ironical to see a big and bold display board\r\n\r\nin  the  passenger  cabin of every  bus  stating  the\r\n\r\nnumber of passengers it is licensed to carry (sitting\r\n\r\nand  standing)  when practically every bus  overloads\r\n\r\npassengers at peak hours. Perhaps, the situation  can\r\n\r\nbe  further  improved by increasing additional  buses\r\n\r\nwith similar service numbers on routes where the corn\r\n\r\nmuter  traffic  is very heavy. I wonder  whether  the\r\n\r\nexcess   passengers  over  and   above   the   figure\r\n\r\nstipulated in the licence are covered by insurance. I\r\n\r\nalso   wonder   whether   the  drivers,   conductors,\r\n\r\nconductresses  or for that matter the  bus  companies\r\n\r\nhave ever been prosecuted for such overloading, as it\r\n\r\nundoubtedly flouts the law. Perhaps the Hon. Minister\r\n\r\ncan enlighten us on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Double-decker buses will soon be introduced on our\r\n\r\ncongested roads. Overloading in these buses  may, be\r\n\r\ndisastrous particularly in the upper deck. I  foresee\r\n\r\nthis will happen when they are put on the roads,  for\r\n\r\nthey will become a novelty on our roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the stipulated passenger capacity for each\r\n\r\nbus  is  strictly observed where commuters can travel\r\n\r\nin  comfort  either standing or sitting,  buses  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  over-crowded with commuters.  As  a\r\n\r\nconsequence,   accidents   will   happen   and   will\r\n\r\ndefinitely raise the rate of traffic accidents on our\r\n\r\nroads.  In fact, this morning I saw another  accident\r\n\r\nat  Airport Road where an elderly lady was killed  on\r\n\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank you, Sir, for allowing me this opportunity\r\n\r\nto speak although my name is not on the list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to inform the hon. Member for Anson  that\r\n\r\naction has been and will continue to be taken by  the\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police and the Singapore Bus Service against\r\n\r\nreckless and inconsiderate drivers. In fact, the  SBS\r\n\r\noperates  five  radio-equipped patrol cars  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose.  In  the  past  14  months,  it  has   taken\r\n\r\ndisciplinary action against 400 drivers for  speeding\r\n\r\nor   for   dangerous  driving  or  for  inconsiderate\r\n\r\ndriving.  I am glad to inform the Member that  during\r\n\r\nthe  last  three months the number of such cases  has\r\n\r\ndropped  because  of  this strict enforcement  action\r\n\r\ntaken by the SBS and the Police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, Sir, buses which have to stop at the\r\n\r\nleft  side of the road have to make a right turn  and\r\n\r\nin  doing so they edge their way from the left to the\r\n\r\nright  and  might give the impression that  they  are\r\n\r\nbulldozing their way. Under such circumstances,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  drivers  and conductors have been  given  strict\r\n\r\ninstructions to give appropriate signals  to  provide\r\n\r\nsufficient  warning to other road users.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nintention  of  the  SBS  to continually  upgrade  the\r\n\r\nskills of the drivers by training and retraining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not feasible to provide direct bus services\r\n\r\nfrom  the housing estates to every part of Singapore.\r\n\r\nResources are limited and to do so would be  a  waste\r\n\r\nof  limited  resources. A direct service between  two\r\n\r\nareas  can  only be justified when there  is  a  high\r\n\r\ndemand  for  such  service. In all other  cases,  bus\r\n\r\ntransfers  will  be inevitable. The Member  gave  the\r\n\r\nexample  that there is no direct bus service  between\r\n\r\nMarine  Parade and Keppel/Telok Blangah/Pasir Panjang\r\n\r\nRoads.  The  demand is not sufficient  to  justify  a\r\n\r\ndirect  route. But they only need to do one transfer.\r\n\r\nLater  on if the demand should increase and there  is\r\n\r\njustification, the  SBS  will  run  a  direct  route\r\n\r\nbetween Marine Parade and the roads mentioned by  the\r\n\r\nMember.  At the moment there are already 10  services\r\n\r\noperating  70  buses along Keppel/Telok  Blangah  and\r\n\r\nPasir Panjang Roads. The SBS will continue to monitor\r\n\r\nclosely  the  demand  for such  services.  If  it  is\r\n\r\nrequired, more buses will be put in service there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, the rate between the Malaysian and\r\n\r\nSingapore   currencies  fluctuates.   The   SBS   bus\r\n\r\nconductors  have  been told not to  accept  Malaysian\r\n\r\ncurrency  and  it is only fair that they  should  not\r\n\r\ngive Malaysian currency in return. The directive will\r\n\r\nbe further emphasised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present condition, the City Shuttle\r\n\r\nService  operates for quite an extended period,  that\r\n\r\nis,  from 7.00 a.m. to 7.30 p.m. This covers both  the\r\n\r\nmorning  and  evening  peak  periods.  Extension   of\r\n\r\noperational  hours will result in the need  for  more\r\n\r\nbuses,  more  workers  and  more  costs.  Since   the\r\n\r\ncommuting demand outside the CSS operational hours is\r\n\r\nadequately met by the SBS, there is no need to extend\r\n\r\nthe CSS period of operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the extension of the routes, this\r\n\r\nagain depends on the demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned about deterioration of the\r\n\r\nScheme B services. The Registry of Vehicles has  been\r\n\r\ntaking enforcement action against Scheme B\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noperators  who  have breached operational  conditions\r\n\r\nstipulated in their licence. One of the conditions is\r\n\r\nthat  the  operator can only operate on  an  approved\r\n\r\nroute  and  he  cannot change his route  without  the\r\n\r\nprior  approval of the authorities. Those who do  not\r\n\r\nobserve  this rule can have their licences  suspended\r\n\r\nor  even  revoked. The ROV is also in constant  touch\r\n\r\nwith the Singapore School Bus Owners' Association and\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  School Transport  Association,  whose\r\n\r\nmembers  operate most of the Scheme B services.  From\r\n\r\ntime  to time these associations are asked to  remind\r\n\r\ntheir  members  of  the rules and conditions  of  the\r\n\r\nscheme  under  which they operate. Since  early  this\r\n\r\nyear  the  Scheme  B operators have introduced  time-keepers  at  four major terminals. This  has  brought\r\n\r\nabout some improvement in the service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not have 7,000 taxis. The Member is\r\n\r\nwrong.  There  are only 5,745 taxis. 400  taxis  have\r\n\r\nbeen  added  to the fleet during the period  November\r\n\r\n1976  to March 1977. We expect to add another 1,800\r\n\r\ntaxis to the fleet. To increase the efficiency of the\r\n\r\ntaxi  fleet, taxi operators are encouraged to operate\r\n\r\nradiophone   taxis  and  set  up  taxi  kiosks   with\r\n\r\ntelephones.   When  radio  taxis  become   universal,\r\n\r\nprobably the service will improve greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> What about buses leaking?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> There may be a few buses with\r\n\r\nleaking roofs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

They can and should help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> The seats are already wet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> If there are no passengers, the bus\r\n\r\nconductors will be asked to close the windows.  These\r\n\r\ncases are few\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  far  between because the conductor himself  does\r\n\r\nnot  like  to get wet. But if his complaint is  about\r\n\r\nleaks  from  the  roof, then my explanation  is  that\r\n\r\nprobably these cases are getting less and less.  From\r\n\r\nthe  figures given to me, in spite of an increase  of\r\n\r\n400 buses to the fleet, the number of buses that have\r\n\r\nbeen  laid  up has dropped from 750 to 110  per  day.\r\n\r\nThere has been an improvement in the servicing of the\r\n\r\nbuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards music through the telephone, this is due\r\n\r\nto  interception of broadcasting wavelength, but more\r\n\r\noften  than  not  it  is  due  to  the  proximity  of\r\n\r\nRediffusion wires. If the Member should pick  up  the\r\n\r\nphone and hear music the next time, the TAS will make\r\n\r\nthe  necessary  adjustment if he will only  telephone\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to difficulties in getting through to\r\n\r\nsome  Government departments, perhaps everybody wants\r\n\r\nto  get  through to the same department at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adequacy or inadequacy of telephone lines for\r\n\r\nany organisation, be it a Government department or  a\r\n\r\nbusiness concern, is something over which the TAS has\r\n\r\nno control. The TAS can however advise the department\r\n\r\nor  organisation concerned as to what should  be  the\r\n\r\nappropriate number of lines, taking into account  the\r\n\r\nusage,  but  the  decision whether  to  increase  the\r\n\r\nnumber of lines or not lies upon the Minister or  the\r\n\r\nHead of Department or the organisation concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\nRegarding the bus service, I had mentioned last  year\r\n\r\nat  the  Budget debates that they must take down  the\r\n\r\nstatistics of passengers travelling from one place to\r\n\r\nanother.  If they had done that, they would now  know\r\n\r\nwhether or not the particular direct service  has  to\r\n\r\nbe  put on. And if they increase the number of  buses\r\n\r\nthere, it will be much easier for the passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir,I am greatly enlightened.

Govindaswamy:</b> Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> To come to the Member for Changi, I\r\n\r\ndo not know whether he is aware that the Minister for\r\n\r\nHome Affairs has already indicated that there will be\r\n\r\na  nation-wide campaign on road safety  in  order  to\r\n\r\ninstil  into the commuters and motorists a  sense  of\r\n\r\ndiscipline for the good of all concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think either the SBS, the drivers or the\r\n\r\nconductors would like to have an overloaded  bus,  if\r\n\r\nthey can help it. It is all very well to say that  we\r\n\r\nhave  certain limitations and that we must not  allow\r\n\r\nmore  passengers on the bus and that  the  bus  would\r\n\r\nmove off when there are enough passengers. But it  is\r\n\r\nnot  as  easy as that. I do not think it is practical\r\n\r\nduring the rush hours when every one, as he says,  is\r\n\r\nrushing  helter skelter trying to get into an already\r\n\r\noverloaded bus. To push them out would have caused  a\r\n\r\nriot.  Probably  his  experience with  travelling  in\r\n\r\naeroplanes gives him a bias over the way in which the\r\n\r\nrunning  of  the bus can be controlled. I would  like\r\n\r\nhim to get down to a bus stop during a rush hour, and\r\n\r\nobviously  he must have done so, otherwise  he  would\r\n\r\nnot have been able to give such a good description of\r\n\r\nthe  scene  during the rush hours.  I  think  if  the\r\n\r\nconductor or the driver were to start pushing  people\r\n\r\noff the bus, there will be a riot and there will be a\r\n\r\nterrific jam. Much as we like to, there has got to be\r\n\r\nsome  laxity.  The answer here would be  probably  to\r\n\r\nsupply  more buses. This we are doing. We are  adding\r\n\r\nmore  buses to the fleet. This is one of the ways  by\r\n\r\nwhich   we  can  alleviate  overcrowding  in   buses.\r\n\r\nProbably  the way to solve this problem would  be  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the number of buses and provide buses  with\r\n\r\nlarger capacity.

In  the\r\n\r\npast  two years, our bus transport system has greatly\r\n\r\nimproved,  as  a  result  of  the  efforts   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Government side, there are a few ministries\r\n\r\nand  agencies which are in close touch with  the  bus\r\n\r\ntransport   system,   that  is,   the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nCommunications,  PWD, Housing and  Development  Board\r\n\r\nand  the Ministry of the Environment. But because  of\r\n\r\nred-tape  and  the  complicated  procedure  of  these\r\n\r\nministries or agencies plans or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures on how to improve public transport were very\r\n\r\noften delayed or could not be implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me touch on a few measures for the\r\n\r\nimprovement of bus services which have been  shelved,\r\n\r\ndelayed  or not yet been solved. Firstly, bus depots.\r\n\r\nBecause of the great number of buses, the bus company\r\n\r\nshould have some well-equipped bus depots in order to\r\n\r\nrepair at all times the buses that have broken  down.\r\n\r\nHowever, this question of bus depots has' yet  to  be\r\n\r\nsolved.  Only the Braddell Road Main Depot has  shown\r\n\r\nsome progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, sanitary facilities at bus terminals. The\r\n\r\nGovernment,  trade  unions and the  bus  company  all\r\n\r\nfully  understand that there is an  urgent  need  for\r\n\r\ngood  sanitary facilities at bus terminals.  The  bus\r\n\r\ncompany   has  therefore  applied  to  the  authority\r\n\r\nconcerned.  However, because  of  red-tape  and  the\r\n\r\ncomplicated procedure of these ministries or agencies\r\n\r\nthere  has  been no reply although applications  were\r\n\r\nsent in to the authorities concerned years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, bus lanes. During the peak hours many bus\r\n\r\nlanes are obstructed by some buses which have no time\r\n\r\nschedule  to  keep and that causes other buses  which\r\n\r\nhave  a time schedule to keep to move out of the  bus\r\n\r\nlane,   otherwise  it  would  disrupt  all  the   bus\r\n\r\nschedules badly. Yet, buses leaving the bus  lane  is\r\n\r\nillegal  and  it  is also extremely  unsafe  for  the\r\n\r\ncommuters.  It  also directly affects the  safety  of\r\n\r\nother  road  users.  Although  the  trade  union  has\r\n\r\ncomplained to the authorities which then became  busy\r\n\r\nfor  a while, but there was no result and it was  the\r\n\r\nend of the matter,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, bus bays. On the dividers in front of the\r\n\r\nbus   bays  usually  some  plants  are  planted   for\r\n\r\ndecoration  and the branches of these often  obstruct\r\n\r\nthe  view  of the bus drivers. Moreover,  because  of\r\n\r\ntheir length, when the buses move into or out of  the\r\n\r\nbus bay, the buses inevitably run into some branches.\r\n\r\nthus causing unnecessary danger to commuters and also\r\n\r\ncausing unnecessary wear and tear of the buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, bus stops. Some bus stops are sited very\r\n\r\nclose to traffic lights. At present some buses do not\r\n\r\nhave  automatic  doors  and this  is  very  dangerous\r\n\r\nbecause  some commuters would try to get up  or  down\r\n\r\nthe  bus  before the traffic lights. This  can  cause\r\n\r\nunnecessary accidents. Therefore, I hope the Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned will try his best to cut down on  red  tape\r\n\r\nand  simplify the procedures and would take  note  of\r\n\r\nthe above points in order to ensure that any plans or\r\n\r\nmeasures  for  the  improvement of  public  transport\r\n\r\nwould not be hindered or delayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Senior Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Sir, the hon. Member for Paya Lebar\r\n\r\nraised a number of points. The first one is about bus\r\n\r\ndepots and workshops. It is not true that no progress\r\n\r\nhas  been  made.  In  fact, the construction  of  the\r\n\r\nBraddell Road Depot and Central Workshop has  already\r\n\r\ncommenced  and  is  expected to be completed  by  the\r\n\r\nmiddle  or  before the middle of next year.  Besides,\r\n\r\nthe  new bus depot at Jurong which will be commencing\r\n\r\nwork  very soon is expected to be completed  sometime\r\n\r\nnext  year  too. As to the other depots and workshops\r\n\r\nin  the other areas, various stages of progress  have\r\n\r\nbeen made and they will be completed over a period of\r\n\r\ntime, within the next two to three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding toilet and canteen facilities in the\r\n\r\ndepots  and terminals. I wish to inform him that  all\r\n\r\nthe  existing  depots are presently already  provided\r\n\r\nwith  toilets  and  canteen facilities.  Of  the  bus\r\n\r\nterminals, most of them, 56 out of 66 terminals,  are\r\n\r\nprovided with toilet facilities and canteens. Only 10\r\n\r\nterminals are without these facilities, and eight  of\r\n\r\nthem  are  in the Jurong area but they will  soon  be\r\n\r\nrelocated to a proper terminal in Jurong when the new\r\n\r\nterminal is completed,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two bus terminals without toilet\r\n\r\nfacilities  and they will not be able to have  toilet\r\n\r\nfacilities  because of shortage of space  on  a  very\r\n\r\nrestricted land. This is the one at Yio Chu Kang Road\r\n\r\nnear the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSembawang  Circus and the other one is at the  Mandai\r\n\r\narea. In 1974 and 1975, SBS has spent $125,000 on the\r\n\r\nbuilding   of  toilets  at  the  various   terminals.\r\n\r\nTerminals  with proper toilet and canteen  facilities\r\n\r\nand  other  amenities  for the  bus  crew  are  being\r\n\r\ndeveloped  at Paya Lebar Airport and Boon Lay  Garden\r\n\r\nat  a cost of $130,000 and $185,000 respectively.  So\r\n\r\nit  is  not  true to say that nothing is being  done.\r\n\r\nBut,  of  course, all this takes time and all efforts\r\n\r\nare   being  made  to  improve  the  facilities   and\r\n\r\namenities for the bus crew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned about bus stops near traffic lights.\r\n\r\nSir,  bus stops are normally sited away from  traffic\r\n\r\nlights. However, there are instances when the  siting\r\n\r\nof  a  bus  stop near a traffic light is unavoidable,\r\n\r\nespecially   when  the  junctions   are   too   close\r\n\r\nespecially  in  the  City  area.  I  wish  to  assure\r\n\r\nMembers, however, that where a bus stop needs  to  be\r\n\r\nsited  near  a  traffic  light,  whether  at  a  road\r\n\r\njunction  or a pedestrian crossing, the PWD  and  the\r\n\r\nROV  would ensure that pedestrians and motorists  are\r\n\r\nnot being endangered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has referred to tree planting near bus bays.\r\n\r\nTrees   are   planted  to  provide  shade   for   the\r\n\r\npedestrians  and commuters waiting at bus  stops.  In\r\n\r\nthe  planting of trees in the vicinity of bus  stops,\r\n\r\ncare  is  usually  taken to  see  that  they  do  not\r\n\r\nobstruct  visibility or constitute a potential  cause\r\n\r\nfor  accidents if the plants grow and reach  a  stage\r\n\r\nwhere  they are likely to obstruct the view.  We  are\r\n\r\naware of that and the Parks and Recreation Department\r\n\r\ndo  go  around and trim these trees when they  become\r\n\r\nobstructive. However, if the Member does come  across\r\n\r\nany  bus bay obstructed by plants. I suggest that  he\r\n\r\nwrites   immediately  to  the  Parks  and  Recreation\r\n\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned about bus lanes being obstructed by\r\n\r\nschool  buses, resulting in the buses having to  move\r\n\r\nout of the bus lanes and saying that this is illegal.\r\n\r\nAs  my Minister has pointed out earlier, this is  not\r\n\r\nso.  The  bus  lanes are meant to accord priority  to\r\n\r\nhigh capacity public transport vehicles. During the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noperative  hours  bus lanes are  reserved  for  buses\r\n\r\nonly.  But  this  does not mean that buses  can  only\r\n\r\ntravel in bus lanes. The buses continue to have equal\r\n\r\nright  as  other  vehicles to use the  other  traffic\r\n\r\nlanes.  This  is  in line with our policy  of  giving\r\n\r\npriority  to high capacity public transport  wherever\r\n\r\nthe  road  space  is  limited,  particularly  in  the\r\n\r\nCentral area. Since the objective is to give priority\r\n\r\nto  high  capacity  public  transport  vehicles, the\r\n\r\nScheme B school buses will continue to be allowed  to\r\n\r\nuse  these  bus  lanes. The ROV, however,  has  taken\r\n\r\naction   against   school  buses  for   unnecessarily\r\n\r\nobstructing  the  bus lanes as it would  against  any\r\n\r\nother  vehicles.  For the last two  months  alone,  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of 24 school bus drivers have been booked  for\r\n\r\nthis  offence.  Obstructions caused by  school  buses\r\n\r\nhave  already been reduced significantly. I  think  I\r\n\r\nhave replied to all his points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng San</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State has said that up to  the  present\r\n\r\ntime  there  are  10  bus  terminals  which  have  no\r\n\r\nsanitary  facilities.  Will  the  Minister  concerned\r\n\r\nprovide   temporary  sanitary  facilities  at   these\r\n\r\nplaces?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, this request has, in fact,\r\n\r\nbeen  looked  into sometime ago. As I have  mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier, at some of the depots, there is just  simply\r\n\r\nno space for these facilities to be provided. The bus\r\n\r\ncrew  will have to go to the other terminals if  they\r\n\r\nwant   to   use  the  facilities.  This   is   rather\r\n\r\nunfortunate.  Fortunately, the  number  of  terminals\r\n\r\nwithout  facilities is small. As I have  said,  there\r\n\r\nare  only 10 of them. Eight of them will be relocated\r\n\r\nsoon  to  proper terminals with facilities. Regarding\r\n\r\nthe  other two terminals without facilities, the  SBS\r\n\r\nhas  been  asked to look into this question seriously\r\n\r\nand hopefully proper solutions will emerge soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng San</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we\r\n\r\nknow   that  the  bus  routes  are  now  quite  long.\r\n\r\nTravelling from one terminal to the other  will  take\r\n\r\nabout two hours.

No  doubt over  the  years, we  have\r\n\r\nimproved  and expanded our international  airport  to\r\n\r\nthat  comparable to many western countries, but  then\r\n\r\nfurther improvements can still be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to our Development Expenditure there\r\n\r\nis  a revote of $8,300,000 for the construction of  a\r\n\r\nnew arrival block for Paya Lebar Airport.

I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwonder  whether he knows how many seats there are  in\r\n\r\nthe departure lounge at the Paya Lebar Airport. There\r\n\r\nare  actually more than 1,400 seats now at  the  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar Airport departure transit lounge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> It is congested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> It is true that there are times\r\n\r\nwhen  there are insufficient number of seats for  the\r\n\r\npassengers  and  the well-wishers, especially  during\r\n\r\nthe  peak  hours. However, these waiting periods  are\r\n\r\nnormally of very short duration. There is only a high\r\n\r\nturn-over of passengers and their well-wishers during\r\n\r\nthe  peak  periods. With the reopening of the  waving\r\n\r\ngallery  in  September last year  the  situation  has\r\n\r\nimproved,  since many of the well-wishers  leave  the\r\n\r\ndeparture lounge to go upstairs to the waving gallery\r\n\r\nto view the planes landing and taking off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Airport shops provide essential services for the\r\n\r\nconvenience of air travellers. Banking, post  office.\r\n\r\ninsurance   and   money   changing   activities   and\r\n\r\noperations  as  well as other Airport  shops  are  an\r\n\r\nintegral part of passenger terminals and are provided\r\n\r\nat  all  the  international airports  throughout  the\r\n\r\nworld.  Our shops occupy only a small portion of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  space in the departure lounge and they are  so\r\n\r\nlocated  to  avoid  hindering  the  smooth  flow   of\r\n\r\npassengers.  We do realise that there  is  inadequate\r\n\r\nspace  in  the present departure lounge at  the  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar Airport during the evening peak hours. However,\r\n\r\nto  provide more seats for the passengers  and  well-wishers  would  cause  more  serious  congestion   as\r\n\r\ncirculation space would be reduced. That  is  why  we\r\n\r\nare  now building a new arrival terminal, after which\r\n\r\nwe  will convert the existing passenger terminal into\r\n\r\na  departure  terminal. This is so  even  as  we  are\r\n\r\nconstructing the new Airport at Changi, which will be\r\n\r\nready  only  in  the middle of 1980, or  maybe  early\r\n\r\n1981.  In  the meantime we must continue  to  provide\r\n\r\nmore  space  and  facilities to cope with  the  ever-increasing traffic. The new arrival building  at  the\r\n\r\nPaya Lebar Airport will be ready by the end of this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear.  When  the renovation of the existing  terminal\r\n\r\ninto  a  departure building is completed in mid-1978.\r\n\r\nmore  seats will be provided for passengers  and  the\r\n\r\nwell-wishers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also referred to the taxi situation at\r\n\r\nthe  Paya  Lebar Airport. The taxi situation  at  the\r\n\r\nPaya Lebar Airport has improved considerably over the\r\n\r\nlast  few months. The current airport fleet  of  over\r\n\r\n500  is  double that of May last year, that is,  nine\r\n\r\nmonths  ago. Periodic surveys on the waiting time  of\r\n\r\npassengers  for  taxis  by the  Department  of  Civil\r\n\r\nAviation have revealed a remarkable reduction in  the\r\n\r\nwaiting  time.  Generally, only 7% of the  passengers\r\n\r\nneed  to wait more than 15 minutes during the evening\r\n\r\npeak hours, while during the non-peak hours there  is\r\n\r\nno  taxi  waiting problem at all. There  are  special\r\n\r\nairconditioned bus services from the airport  to  the\r\n\r\nmajor hotels - these are airconditioned coaches -  at\r\n\r\n$3  per  passenger.  In addition, the  Department  of\r\n\r\nCivil Aviation has also introduced a mini-bus service\r\n\r\nto hotels, leaving the airport at 15-minute intervals\r\n\r\nduring the evening peak hours and charging $2.50  and\r\n\r\nnot  $5 per passenger. These bus services have  taken\r\n\r\nabout  10%  off  the taxi passenger  load  and  have,\r\n\r\ntherefore, contributed to the reduction in  the  taxi\r\n\r\nwaiting time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the two points raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah. The first question is about  the  car\r\n\r\nparks  at  the  Paya Lebar Airport and whether  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  additional  car parks in  the  new  arrival\r\n\r\nbuilding.  The  answer is yes. For  the  new  arrival\r\n\r\nbuilding at the Paya Lebar Airport, an additional 303\r\n\r\nprivate  parking lots. 102 permanent taxi stands  and\r\n\r\n20 coach stands have been constructed. Although these\r\n\r\nadditional parking lots are to serve the new  arrival\r\n\r\nbuilding  which  is  expected  to  be  completed   by\r\n\r\nNovember   or  December  this  year, the   PWD   has\r\n\r\nconstructed  the parking lots ahead  of  time.  These\r\n\r\nadditional parking lots have, in fact, been completed\r\n\r\nand  are  open  to the public. With these  additional\r\n\r\nparking  lots. Sir, the parking situation during  the\r\n\r\npeak periods at Paya Lebar Airport has improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Seletar Airport, Sir, the type of\r\n\r\ntraffic   which  uses  Seletar  Airport   are   light\r\n\r\naircraft,  helicopters and small jets.  The  type  of\r\n\r\naircraft that will be diverted to Paya Lebar  Airport\r\n\r\nin  the later years when the Changi Airport is  ready\r\n\r\nwill  be  the larger aircraft. Therefore, Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nand Seletar Airports will serve different markets. It\r\n\r\nis  unlikely  that  the general aviation  traffic  at\r\n\r\nSeletar will be affected when Paya Lebar is used  for\r\n\r\ncharter and cargo flights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I\r\n\r\nbe  given permission to seek some clarification  from\r\n\r\nthe Senior Minister of State?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On what point, Mr Tan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> On the seating capacity at the\r\n\r\nAirport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I thought the Minister has already\r\n\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, earlier on, in reply to the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson, he mentioned that he was going  to\r\n\r\ngive   figures  of  the  seating  capacity  for   the\r\n\r\ndeparture  lounge.  When, quoting  the  figures, he\r\n\r\nmentioned  more  than  1,000  seats  as  the  seating\r\n\r\ncapacity in the transit lounge. What I want  to  know\r\n\r\nis  whether  this figure is for the whole airport  or\r\n\r\njust  for  the transit lounge, because if  I  am  not\r\n\r\nwrong,  the  Member for Anson is more concerned  with\r\n\r\nthe seating capacity for people who go to the airport\r\n\r\nto await arrivals and departures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir,I have the figures here.\r\n\r\nThe  actual  figure  is  1,420 seats  for  passengers\r\n\r\ncoming  to the airport to depart.

But\r\n\r\nI  think our meteorological service in Singapore  can\r\n\r\nprovide  us  with  a  more reliable  forecast.  I  am\r\n\r\nthinking  more in terms of a longer one-week forecast\r\n\r\nof  possible weather fronts coming to Singapore. This\r\n\r\nwill  help our people to plan their activities during\r\n\r\nthe  weekend. Perhaps if inclement or hot weather  is\r\n\r\nexpected  during the weekend, they can plan ahead  of\r\n\r\ntime  and this will also be of service to our service\r\n\r\nindustries   like   the  lighterage   business,   the\r\n\r\ntransport  business  and  the  stevedoring  business.\r\n\r\nKnowing  what kind of weather is coming up, they  can\r\n\r\nplan for the situation and perhaps save some money in\r\n\r\nthe process and help to increase our productivity.

This will\r\n\r\nenable it to provide a higher standard of service not\r\n\r\nonly  to  members of the public but  also  to  ships,\r\n\r\naircraft and other specialised users.

(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P.\r\n\r\nGovindaswamy).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this amendment. I would like to raise\r\n\r\nthree questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) According to the complaints I have received from\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the public, the present postal  services\r\n\r\nare  not as good as before. In the past, if a  letter\r\n\r\nis  posted in the morning the addressee might be able\r\n\r\nto  receive  it in the evening or at the  latest  the\r\n\r\nfollowing day. But in recent years, the situation  is\r\n\r\nentirely different. Sometimes for ordinary local mail\r\n\r\nthe  addressee can receive it only after some two  or\r\n\r\nthree  days  after  posting. This  delay  will  cause\r\n\r\nunnecessary  inconvenience to members of the  public.\r\n\r\nparticularly in the case of Government correspondence\r\n\r\nsuch  as property tax bills. PUB bills, radio and  TV\r\n\r\nlicence renewal notices and certain urgent letters or\r\n\r\nnotices.  If delivery is delayed or missed, then  the\r\n\r\naddressees can be inconvenienced by having to  pay  a\r\n\r\nfine  or  put  in  a difficult position  for  delayed\r\n\r\npayments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In Marsiling, in Sembawang Constituency, there\r\n\r\nis  a  new  HDB housing estate with a temporary  post\r\n\r\noffice  in a HDB block for the needs of the residents\r\n\r\nthere.  There are altogether 37 blocks of  HDB  flats\r\n\r\ncomprising 5,604 units of flats with a population  of\r\n\r\n30,000 people. So there is a lot of mail to be  dealt\r\n\r\nwith. I understand that there is a staff of only four\r\n\r\nmembers in the post office, including the postmaster,\r\n\r\nand  seven  postmen.  This number  of  staff  is  not\r\n\r\nsufficient  to deal with the large parcels  of  mail.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  there  are  19 blocks  of  factories  with\r\n\r\nthousands of workers in Marsiling area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of them have Post Office Savings Bank accounts\r\n\r\nthere.  Very  often on pay days they crowd  into  the\r\n\r\npost  office and pack up all the space, and the small\r\n\r\nnumber of staff would be kept very busy. According to\r\n\r\nmy  understanding, the small post office  there  will\r\n\r\nsoon  be  receiving payments for PUB  bills  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of the people there. Of course, this will  be\r\n\r\nconvenient to the residents there. But to tackle this\r\n\r\njob  there  is  a  need for more staff  at  the  post\r\n\r\noffice.  So  I  would  like to ask  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider  increasing the number  of  staff  there.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to stress here that the working efficiency\r\n\r\nof the staff at this post office is good. But in view\r\n\r\nof  the  small  number of staff, it is  difficult  to\r\n\r\ntackle the big amount of work to be dealt with. So it\r\n\r\nis necessary to increase the number of staff there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) At the moment, this post office is a temporary\r\n\r\none.  I would like to ask the Minister whether  there\r\n\r\nis  any plan to set up a permanent post office  on  a\r\n\r\nlarger  scale, because more and more people  will  be\r\n\r\nliving  in this new housing estate. There is  a  need\r\n\r\nfor a bigger post office to serve the people better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

However.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether due consideration has been  given  to\r\n\r\nsee that ample space is made available for the postal\r\n\r\nstaff to perform their duties comfortably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that in certain post offices, the space at\r\n\r\nthe  sorting  section  of mails  and  parcels  is  so\r\n\r\nlimited   that   the  postmen  find   difficulty   in\r\n\r\nperforming   their   duties  in   the   uncomfortable\r\n\r\natmosphere. Furthermore, there are no rest rooms  for\r\n\r\nthe  staff. Sometimes there is only one toilet.  When\r\n\r\nthe  postwomen  are  inside the toilet,  the  postmen\r\n\r\noutside will say, \"Siapa goreng ikan?\" (Who's  frying\r\n\r\nfish?)  We  can  see  this at the  newly-opened  post\r\n\r\noffice  at the Tanjong Pagar Plaza. It has  not  been\r\n\r\nofficially opened yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, the Postal Department has\r\n\r\nactually  set  up an internal monitoring  system  for\r\n\r\nmonitoring its mail delivery service performance, and\r\n\r\nit   has  been  found  that  letters  posted  locally\r\n\r\nnormally  take  about one day to reach addressees  in\r\n\r\nSingapore after the date of posting. Delay of one day\r\n\r\naffecting  some  mails due to bad  weather  has  been\r\n\r\nrecorded  in the past, especially in the  more  rural\r\n\r\nareas where the coverage is wide. But mail deliveries\r\n\r\nto  the Sembawang Constituency has been found  to  be\r\n\r\nquite  in order. Mail deliveries are undertaken there\r\n\r\nby  nine postmen, and not seven postmen.

Should  the\r\n\r\nneed arise later on, that will be looked into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the plan to set up a bigger post office in\r\n\r\nWoodlands  New Town, the answer is, yes, there  is  a\r\n\r\nplan to set up a bigger post office in Woodlands  New\r\n\r\nTown.  This  new  post  office  is  expected  to   be\r\n\r\ncompleted  early next year. In fact, there  are  also\r\n\r\nplans  to establish four more post offices eventually\r\n\r\nin the entire Woodlands New Town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also mentioned about the\r\n\r\nMarsiling Post Office being a temporary post  office.\r\n\r\nThe  Marsiling  Post Office is not a  temporary  post\r\n\r\noffice.  The  Marsiling Post Office will continue  to\r\n\r\noperate  even  after  the Woodlands  Post  Office  is\r\n\r\nestablished in early 1978. The present Marsiling Post\r\n\r\nOffice  is  staffed  by a total of  11  members.  The\r\n\r\nexisting  staff strength is found to be  adequate  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  present needs to serve the people  in  the\r\n\r\narea.  The  staffing needs at all  post  offices  are\r\n\r\nconstantly under review by the Postal Department  and\r\n\r\nincreases will be made as and when necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the Member for Anson, it is\r\n\r\nthe responsibility of the Stamp Advisory Committee to\r\n\r\nconsider, select and recommend themes for the stamps.\r\n\r\nAs  a  matter  of general policy, the  Committee  has\r\n\r\nrefrained   from   considering   themes   to   depict\r\n\r\npersonalities.  This  same  policy  also  extends  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  currency notes and coins as  well  as  new\r\n\r\nstreet names and other public projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned about the inadequate working space for\r\n\r\nthe  staff in the post office. Normally each  postman\r\n\r\ninvolved in the sorting of mails is provided  with  a\r\n\r\nworking space of four to five square metres. (This is\r\n\r\nroughly 40 to 50 sq, ft. We have now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmetricated.) This is considered to be sufficient.  It\r\n\r\nis  within the current standards for working space of\r\n\r\n3 1/2  to  5  square metres per head laid  down  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Building Committee for Division IV  staff,\r\n\r\nto  which  the grade of postman belong.  The  working\r\n\r\nspace  at Tanjong Pagar Plaza Post Office is about  4\r\n\r\nsquare   metres   per  postman.  This   is   actually\r\n\r\nconsidered to be adequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he said is true - there is no rest room in\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  Plaza Post Office,  because  for  one\r\n\r\nreason  there is a shortage of space. Besides,  there\r\n\r\nare  nearby  coffee  shops  and  canteens  where  the\r\n\r\npostmen can go to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About toilets, I do not know whether the example\r\n\r\nwhich  he  has quoted is in Tanjong Pagar Plaza  Post\r\n\r\nOffice or somewhere else. Perhaps if he would let  me\r\n\r\nknow I would look into the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with the reply given, and I beg  leave  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of subhead FAA 1101*.

This wrong attitude has often given  rise  to\r\n\r\ndoubts  as  to  whether the ROV also takes  taxis  as\r\n\r\npublic service vehicles. As we all know and agree, in\r\n\r\nthis  developed society of Singapore taxis constitute\r\n\r\na very important link in the public transport system,\r\n\r\nparticularly at the present juncture when as a result\r\n\r\nof Government restrictions the number of private cars\r\n\r\nis  decreasing.  This gives rise to  a  corresponding\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the demand for taxis.  In  the  Central\r\n\r\nBusiness  District, because car owners do  not  drive\r\n\r\ntheir cars into the CBD there is an even greater need\r\n\r\nfor  them to use taxis for transport. In view of  all\r\n\r\nthis  and  the  importance given to public  transport\r\n\r\nvehicles\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the  ROV  I  would  expect  them  to  give  every\r\n\r\nencouragement  to taxi operations, but  instead  the\r\n\r\nattitude adopted is just the reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of taxes, one has to pay the same amount of\r\n\r\nadditional  registration fee for  a  taxi  as  for  a\r\n\r\nprivate car. The original 25% ARF levied in 1972  has\r\n\r\nbeen   increased   to   100%  today.   To   give   an\r\n\r\nillustration:  if the original price  of  a  taxi  is\r\n\r\n$10,000, then the taxi driver will now have  to  pay\r\n\r\nanother  $10,000  by  way of additional  registration\r\n\r\nfee. If this vehicle is not locally assembled but .an\r\n\r\nimported vehicle, the taxi driver will have to pay  a\r\n\r\nfurther  45% in import duty. From this, you  can  see\r\n\r\nthat  a  car which orginally costs only $10,000  will\r\n\r\nnow  cost about $24,500 because of the imposition  of\r\n\r\nadditional registration fee and the import duty.  But\r\n\r\nbuses   are   not   affected   by   this   additional\r\n\r\nregistration fee because the Government regards buses\r\n\r\nas  public transport vehicles. Does not this attitude\r\n\r\nthen  show that the Government does not regard  taxis\r\n\r\nas public transport vehicles?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as entering the CBD is concerned, the ROV\r\n\r\nis  also imposing on taxis the same rate of the  area\r\n\r\nlicensing  fee as for private cars, i.e, at  $4  per\r\n\r\nentry. In the case of buses, they are not subject  to\r\n\r\nthis  imposition  on the ground that  the  Government\r\n\r\nregards buses as public transport vehicles. But taxis\r\n\r\nare  not  regarded  by  the same  measure  as  public\r\n\r\ntransport  vehicles. I would like to point  out  here\r\n\r\nthat   because  taxis  are  subject   to   the   same\r\n\r\nrestrictions  as for private cars entering  the  CBD.\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers  try to avoid entering the  CBD  during\r\n\r\npeak  hours  in  order to avoid paying  the  $4  area\r\n\r\nlicensing  fee.  As  a result, many  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic    are   experiencing   a   great   deal    of\r\n\r\ninconvenience. The ROV has naively suggested that  to\r\n\r\navoid  paying  the $4 area licensing fee,  taxis  can\r\n\r\nalso  resort to car-pooling. They could wait to  pick\r\n\r\nthree  passengers before entering  the  CBD.  Such  a\r\n\r\nproposition from the ROV seems to fail to  take  into\r\n\r\naccount the reason why members of the public make use\r\n\r\nof  taxis.  Members of the public use taxis  and  not\r\n\r\nbuses  simply  because they find the  taxi  to  be  a\r\n\r\nfaster and more convenient means of transport. If the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassenger  in a taxi has to wait for other passengers\r\n\r\nto make up a car-pool what is the point of boarding a\r\n\r\ntaxi  and who wants to ride in a taxi? This  kind  of\r\n\r\nproposition by the ROV is easier said than  done.  To\r\n\r\nimplement it will get just the reverse result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attitude of the ROV not to regard taxis as\r\n\r\npublic transport vehicles has been mentioned by me in\r\n\r\nthis  House, but  the authority  concerned  has  not\r\n\r\nanswered my point directly. In actual fact this  kind\r\n\r\nof attitude is now adversely affecting members of the\r\n\r\npublic  and  the  taxi drivers. It also  affects  our\r\n\r\npublic  transport  services. The authority  concerned\r\n\r\nshould  not  bury its head and remain indifferent  to\r\n\r\nthis matter. I am awaiting for a concrete answer from\r\n\r\nthe relevant authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Lang Kee):</b> Sir, road transport\r\n\r\nproblems  are  part and parcel of the urban  problems\r\n\r\nconfronting most major cities in the world and, as an\r\n\r\nurban   centre.  Singapore  could  not  avoid   these\r\n\r\nproblems.  Moreover, since Singapore is also  a  city\r\n\r\nstate,  road  transport problems have  received  much\r\n\r\nattention  and ranked high in the priority  scale  of\r\n\r\nnational policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two or three years, the Government has\r\n\r\nintroduced  a number of policy measures to  curb  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in car population and to alleviate  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion,  particularly  in  the  Central  Business\r\n\r\nDistrict. These measures range from increases in road\r\n\r\ntax,   introduction  of  Area  Licensing  Scheme   to\r\n\r\nimposition  of additional registration  fee.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  many  people  understand  and  support   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's good intention to reduce the  number  of\r\n\r\nvehicles  on the roads. Given the constraint  of  our\r\n\r\nland area, restriction on the increase of vehicles on\r\n\r\nthe   roads  is  absolutely  necessary.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\ntraffic  congestion  is counter-productive;  this  is\r\n\r\nmanifested   in   the  unnecessary   lengthening   of\r\n\r\ntravelling time to and from work, fuel wastage and so\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, a given objective normally could be\r\n\r\nachieved  by  alternative  means.  In  selecting  the\r\n\r\nmeasures,   their  effectiveness  in  achieving   the\r\n\r\nobjective and their by-effects must be evaluated  and\r\n\r\nexamined. In this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontext,  I would like to make some observations  and\r\n\r\ncomments  on  the two policy measures implemented  by\r\n\r\nthe Registry of Vehicles. The first is the additional\r\n\r\nregistration  fee  and its related measures  such  as\r\n\r\npreferential ARF and surcharge on old cars. According\r\n\r\nto  the  Motor Vehicles (Registration and  Licensing)\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Rules,  1976,  Part  II  of  the   First\r\n\r\nSchedule,  a  fee equal to 100% of the value  of  the\r\n\r\nvehicle  will  be imposed on vehicles under  category\r\n\r\n(b)  which  includes private motor  cars,  taxis  and\r\n\r\nbusiness  service  passenger vehicles.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  preferential rates (ranging from  35%  to  55%\r\n\r\ndepending  on  the cylinder capacity of the  vehicle)\r\n\r\nare  granted on application by the car-owner provided\r\n\r\nthat  his old vehicle could satisfy certain specified\r\n\r\nconditions. One of these conditions is that  the  old\r\n\r\nvehicle  should  not be more than 10  years  old  or.\r\n\r\nwhere the vehicle is a taxi, it be not more than five\r\n\r\nyears  old. For vehicles which are more than 10 years\r\n\r\nold, a surcharge on an increasing scale according  to\r\n\r\nthe age of the vehicle will be imposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the full ARF, by increasing the purchase price\r\n\r\nof  a vehicle and its annual depreciation expense, is\r\n\r\neffective in discouraging car ownership. However,  it\r\n\r\nis  both  inflationary and discriminating. It  raises\r\n\r\nthe cost of living and imposes hardship on people who\r\n\r\nhave to use vehicles to make a living. Naturally, car\r\n\r\nowners would try to qualify for the preferential ARF.\r\n\r\nThe  conditions laid down for the PARF, together with\r\n\r\nthe   surcharge  on  old  cars,  however,   are   not\r\n\r\nconsistent  with the objective, i.e, restricting  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  car  population  and  alleviating   the\r\n\r\ntraffic  congestion. Rather, these measures  seem  to\r\n\r\naim   at   reducing  the  average  age  of  our   car\r\n\r\npopulation.  Moreover, Sir, these measures  encourage\r\n\r\nwasteful consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One virtue of the Oriental societies is\r\n\r\n\"thriftiness.\"  It  is  well known  that  many  older\r\n\r\npeople   are  even  reluctant  to  throw  away   used\r\n\r\nclothing, bottles or cans. Our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment also encourages people to save voluntarily\r\n\r\nwith  the  Post  Office Savings  Bank  and  increases\r\n\r\nforced savings by raising the CPF contribution rates.\r\n\r\nYet,  Sir, when it comes to the motor vehicle,  which\r\n\r\nis   the  second  most  important  investment  of   a\r\n\r\nhousehold,  next  only  to the  house  or  flat,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has taken a contradictory philosophy.  It\r\n\r\nencourages  people to abandon their  cars  within  10\r\n\r\nyears  even  though  they  might  still  be  in  good\r\n\r\ncondition. Another consequence is that car owners may\r\n\r\nchoose  to  intensify  the usage  of  their  vehicles\r\n\r\nwithout  proper maintenance within the  limited  life\r\n\r\nspan.  By  so  doing,  they  increase  the  risk   to\r\n\r\nthemselves  and  to  other  road  users  when   their\r\n\r\nvehicles are on the roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing the objectives in mind, the following\r\n\r\nmodifications seem to be better:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the full ARF should be imposed on second and\r\n\r\nsubsequent  vehicles of a family  or  a  company  not\r\n\r\nengaged in public transport activities;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) all first registered vehicles would be given a\r\n\r\npreferential  ARF, based on their cylinder  capacity,\r\n\r\nbut lifting the condition concerning the old car;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) all cars which are more than 10 years old should\r\n\r\nbe  subjected to an annual roadworthiness test by the\r\n\r\nRegistry of Vehicles. The surcharge should be imposed\r\n\r\nonly if the cars fail the test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to another problem and I am glad to\r\n\r\nnote  that  the  Member for Aljunied  has  made  some\r\n\r\nremarks  on this problem. I just want to add some  of\r\n\r\nmy personal observations. Sir, I submit that the Area\r\n\r\nLicensing  Scheme has resulted in an excess  capacity\r\n\r\nof  the  present taxi fleet, in the sense  that  many\r\n\r\ntaxis  remain idle during the peak hours. The  extent\r\n\r\nof  excess  capacity could, in fact, be estimated  by\r\n\r\nthe  difference between the number of taxis  entering\r\n\r\ninto  the Central Business District before and  after\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of the ALS. The excess capacity  of\r\n\r\ntaxis would be further aggravated with an increase in\r\n\r\nthe number of taxis as time goes by. To eliminate the\r\n\r\nexisting excess capacity, I humbly suggest that taxis\r\n\r\nshould not be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntreated in the same manner as private passenger cars.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, the Road Action Committee has first treated\r\n\r\ntaxis  as  public transport vehicles.  Its  document,\r\n\r\nentitled  A Plan For the Relief of Traffic Congestion\r\n\r\nin the City (Page 7) stated that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The following categories of vehicles will be\r\n\r\nspecifically exempted and be allowed free access into\r\n\r\nthe restricted zone at all times:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Public transport vehicles including regular\r\n\r\nscheduled  buses, school buses, private  buses  with\r\n\r\nseating capacity of 7 or more persons and taxis:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Emergency vehicles, e.g, ambulances, fire\r\n\r\nengines, police and military vehicles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while some may argue that taxis do not have the\r\n\r\nsame  passenger capacity as buses, we must also  bear\r\n\r\nin  mind  that  at present taxis still represent  the\r\n\r\nmost  efficient and convenient alternative  means  of\r\n\r\ntransport  for  those who opt not to drive  into  the\r\n\r\ncity. While taxis may not be given full exemption  as\r\n\r\nwith  buses, they should be given some concessionary\r\n\r\nrates  in view of the present role they play  in  our\r\n\r\ntransport   system.  Also,  some  taxi-drivers   have\r\n\r\ncomplained that they are not allowed to park at  taxi\r\n\r\nstops  to  wait for passengers. Sir, I hope that  the\r\n\r\nRegistry  of  Vehicles could relax  this  restriction\r\n\r\nduring the peak hours, thereby enabling taxis to wait\r\n\r\nat  taxi stops within the CBD. This will also help to\r\n\r\neliminate the excess capacity mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, after several\r\n\r\nreorganisations  the bus services in  Singapore  have\r\n\r\nmade  some improvement but this improvement is  still\r\n\r\nfar from ideal, I think it will take some time before\r\n\r\nit  can reach a higher degree of satisfaction because\r\n\r\nI  can still find certain defects and shortcomings in\r\n\r\nthe  bus  service. I wish to bring a few examples  to\r\n\r\nthe attention of the Minister of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, many Members of the public complain that\r\n\r\nsome buses do not keep to the schedule regularly. For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  bus  service from Victoria  Street  to\r\n\r\nSembawang, the people have to wait as long as half an\r\n\r\nhour and at times several buses come together at  the\r\n\r\nsame time with very few\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassengers.  As a result of this irregular  schedule,\r\n\r\ninconvenience is caused to the people living  in  the\r\n\r\nSembawang  area.  I  think this is  because  of  poor\r\n\r\nallocation  and  scheduling  of  buses  and  remedial\r\n\r\naction should be taken to improve the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly. I would like to ask the Minister of State\r\n\r\nto  consider this. There should be more buses  plying\r\n\r\nfrom  Naval Base to Marsiling. At the present moment,\r\n\r\nthere  is  only Service No. 1 69 running this  route.\r\n\r\nThis  is  inadequate. In the past, we had bus Service\r\n\r\nNo.  1  60 from Crawford Street to Sembawang  passing\r\n\r\nthrough  Marsiling, but now it does not pass  through\r\n\r\nMarsiling.  So  I would like to ask the  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState to consider reinstating Service No. 160 to pass\r\n\r\nthrough Marsiling and to increase the number of buses\r\n\r\non  this  route, so that people living in  this  area\r\n\r\nwill have a better bus service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I have received many complaints from the\r\n\r\npublic  that the buses are still very dirty nowadays.\r\n\r\nThis  was  also pointed out by the Member for  Anson.\r\n\r\nThe  seats  are also very dirty. They have  not  been\r\n\r\ncleaned properly. Some of the bus windows are damaged\r\n\r\nand  they Cannot close properly. Once they are pushed\r\n\r\nup  they  will slide down again because there  is  no\r\n\r\ncatch.  As a result, whenever it rains the buses  get\r\n\r\nwet,  and there is no cloth or rag in the bus to wipe\r\n\r\nthe  seats  dry. I have travelled in buses  on  rainy\r\n\r\ndays. So I would call for immediate attention to  the\r\n\r\ncleanliness and repair of bus windows. If  necessary,\r\n\r\nI  can  produce my bus tickets to prove that  I  have\r\n\r\ntravelled in buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly. Sir, on the emission of black smoke. I\r\n\r\nstill notice a lot of old buses emitting black smoke.\r\n\r\nVery smoky buses on the road are still to be seen. We\r\n\r\nhave  often  asked public vehicles to be kept  clean.\r\n\r\nTaxis have been summoned for smoky exhausts but I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  whether  similar  action  has  been  taken\r\n\r\nagainst  buses. I would like some report on  this  in\r\n\r\nthis  House.  Action should be taken  to  reduce  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of smoky buses on the road so as to alleviate\r\n\r\nair  pollution in Singapore so that the  people  here\r\n\r\ncan have fresher air for good health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, bus lanes have been\r\n\r\nintroduced  to  speed  up  the  bus  service.   Other\r\n\r\nvehicles cannot use these lanes during the restricted\r\n\r\nhours,  but  it seems that buses are not confined  to\r\n\r\nbus  lanes because they are allowed to use the  other\r\n\r\ntraffic   lanes  during  the  peak  periods, thereby\r\n\r\ncausing  obstruction to other vehicles. I  think  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has replied on this point but I would  like\r\n\r\nto bring up a few more points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What action is being considered to force lorries\r\n\r\ncarrying  sand and stones to cover their load?  These\r\n\r\nlorry  drivers  drive recklessly on the  roads,  thus\r\n\r\nposing  a threat to other motorists, particularly  to\r\n\r\nmotor-cyclists who are at times injured by the  loose\r\n\r\nstones falling from the lorries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it appears that nowadays there are too many\r\n\r\ntraffic  signs and restrictions in most of  the  City\r\n\r\nlimit  areas. In fact, most streets have  either  the\r\n\r\nsingle  or  double white and yellow lines. Therefore,\r\n\r\nvehicles cannot park along the roads. As a result, in\r\n\r\ntimes   of  emergency, both  public  and  Government\r\n\r\nvehicles cannot comply with these road traffic signs.\r\n\r\nI  wonder whether in times of emergency these traffic\r\n\r\nregulations  could be relaxed, especially  Government\r\n\r\nvehicles on official duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the high price of oil has in a way compelled\r\n\r\nmotorists  to economise in the use of their vehicles.\r\n\r\nHowever, since most of our roads are one-way streets.\r\n\r\nmotorists have to drive a little extra whenever  they\r\n\r\nwant  to  make  a U turn or to drive in  an  opposite\r\n\r\ndirection.  But  then some of the U turns  are  sited\r\n\r\nsome  miles away, especially along the highways,  and\r\n\r\nthe  motorists have to drive those extra miles before\r\n\r\nhe  makes  the  turn. This is, in fact,  a  waste  of\r\n\r\npetrol  and  money.  Just  to  quote  an  example.  A\r\n\r\nmotorist,  especially, driving at night,  is  driving\r\n\r\nfrom  Serangoon Road to Punggol. When  he  approaches\r\n\r\nthe  Woodsville junction and instead  of  turning  to\r\n\r\nUpper  Serangoon Road he wrongly turns into Toa Payoh\r\n\r\nRoad,  he has to make the unnecessary trip of driving\r\n\r\nabout three to four miles ahead before he could  make\r\n\r\na U turn to come back to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noriginal  point. I wonder whether more U turns  could\r\n\r\nbe  provided  at  shorter intervals in  some  of  our\r\n\r\nhighways so that our motorists would not waste petrol\r\n\r\nand money unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho Kah Leong and Dr Ong Leong Boon\r\n\r\nare not here. Mr Ong Teng Cheong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, a number of Members have\r\n\r\ntouched upon the treatment that is given to taxis  in\r\n\r\nas  far  as the Area Licensing Scheme and road  taxes\r\n\r\nare concerned. I agree with Members' observation that\r\n\r\ntaxis  are not private cars and should not be treated\r\n\r\nin  the  same  manner as private cars.  In  fact,  as\r\n\r\nfurther   measures  are  taken  to   discourage   the\r\n\r\nownership  and  use of private cars,  more  commuters\r\n\r\nwill turn to taxis. The taxi is an inefficient use of\r\n\r\nroad  space, like private cars, against which various\r\n\r\nmeasures  have been taken to relieve our  urban  road\r\n\r\nnetwork. Although taxis do not use the road space  as\r\n\r\nefficiently  as  the buses, which are  high  capacity\r\n\r\npublic  transport vehicles, they nevertheless  are  a\r\n\r\npersonalised  mode of public transport to  provide  a\r\n\r\ndoor-to-door service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with our attempts to encourage the use of\r\n\r\npublic  transport,  my  Ministry  has  examined   the\r\n\r\nAdditional   Registration  Fees  and  import   duties\r\n\r\nimposed on taxis. I am pleased to inform hon. Members\r\n\r\nin  this  House  that Government has  agreed  to  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  after the persistent request made  by  the\r\n\r\nhon. Member for Aljunied over the last three years: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Additional Registration Fee (ARF) for taxis\r\n\r\nwill be reduced from the present rate of 100% of  the\r\n\r\nopen  market value of the vehicle to a flat  rate  of\r\n\r\n$5,000;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The import duty for taxis will be reduced from\r\n\r\nthe present 45% to 20% of the open market value;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The ARF will be further reduced to a flat rate\r\n\r\nof  only $2,000 instead of $5,000 if the new taxi  to\r\n\r\nbe  registered is a replacement for a  taxi  that  is\r\n\r\nbetween five and six years old;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The full exemption from ARF will be allowed if\r\n\r\nthe  new vehicle is a replacement for a taxi that  is\r\n\r\nfive years or less in age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the objective of this reduction in the ARF and\r\n\r\nimport  duty  is to encourage the use of  larger  and\r\n\r\nmore   powerful  vehicles  as  taxis.  It  will  also\r\n\r\nencourage taxi operators to replace their vehicles at\r\n\r\nthe  end of five or six years instead of seven years.\r\n\r\nwhich  is the maximum life span of a taxi. This  will\r\n\r\nresult in a newer and better taxi fleet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, in line with the policy of treating taxis\r\n\r\nas a form of public transport. Sir, I am also pleased\r\n\r\nto inform Members of this House that the Area Licence\r\n\r\nFee  for taxis will be reduced by 50%, that is,  from\r\n\r\n$4  to  $2 for a daily area licence, and from $80  to\r\n\r\n$40  for a monthly area licence. The reduced ARF  and\r\n\r\narea  licence  fee will be effective from  1st  April\r\n\r\n1977. With the implementation of this reduction, Sir.\r\n\r\nit  is expected that the grade of service provided by\r\n\r\ntaxis will gradually improve over the next few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to a few points raised by the Member for Leng\r\n\r\nKee  on the surcharge of cars over ten years old  and\r\n\r\nparking  of taxis at taxi stops. Regarding the  first\r\n\r\npoint, as the Member has eloquently explained in  his\r\n\r\nspeech, Government's policy is to control the  growth\r\n\r\nof  private car population. Amongst the many measures\r\n\r\ntaken was the increase of the ARF for new cars.  With\r\n\r\nthe  increased cost of new cars, owners of  old  cars\r\n\r\nwill  tend to keep their cars longer than they  would\r\n\r\notherwise  have  done.  Apart from  discouraging  the\r\n\r\npurchase  of new cars it is, therefore, necessary  to\r\n\r\nensure that old cars are not kept for an inordinately\r\n\r\nlong time. Surcharges on road tax are imposed on cars\r\n\r\nthat  have  reached or are over ten years old.  Under\r\n\r\nlocal conditions, cars of this age would have reached\r\n\r\nthe  limit of their physical and economic life  span.\r\n\r\nOwners  would  have little reluctance to  dispose  of\r\n\r\nthem,  as  a  trade-off and an inducement  for  these\r\n\r\nowners   to   scrap   or  export  their   cars,   the\r\n\r\npreferential ARF scheme was introduced  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime.  There may be some cars that are over 10  years\r\n\r\nold but still in road-worthy condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\nThe  scrapping  of  these cars may lead  to  economic\r\n\r\nwaste, as the hon. Member has said. This is, however.\r\n\r\nminimal  and it is insignificant when weighed against\r\n\r\nthe   overall  environmental,  economic   and   other\r\n\r\nbenefits  derived. It is not a compulsory  scrapping,\r\n\r\nSir,  when  a  car  has reached  10  years  old.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  if  the  Member owns a Mercedes  200  which\r\n\r\nwould cost $35,000 or $40,000 to purchase now, and if\r\n\r\nit  is still in a road-worthy condition, there is  no\r\n\r\nneed  for  him to scrap his old car for  a  new  one.\r\n\r\nAfter all the 10% surcharge amounts to less than  $90\r\n\r\na year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On taxis entering the restricted zone since the\r\n\r\nrevision  of  the area licence fee on  31st  December\r\n\r\n1975, if the hon. Member would submit a Question  for\r\n\r\na  Written Answer. I will give him the details of the\r\n\r\nstatistics.   But  there  is  definitely   a   slight\r\n\r\nreduction  in  the  number of  taxi  trips  into  the\r\n\r\nCentral Business District. I believe the reduction is\r\n\r\nin   the   region  of  18%.  But  with   my   earlier\r\n\r\nannouncement  that  the  Government  has  decided  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the  area licence fee for taxis by  50%, the\r\n\r\nnumber of taxi trips into the restricted zone will no\r\n\r\ndoubt increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of parking of taxis at taxi stops in\r\n\r\nthe  Central Business District raised by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Leng  Kee.  I wish to inform him that  the  taxi\r\n\r\nstops   are   introduced  in  the  CBD   to   prevent\r\n\r\nobstruction  caused by taxis stopping  at  random  to\r\n\r\npick  up or drop passengers. Since the traffic volume\r\n\r\nin  the  CBD during the restricted hours of the  Area\r\n\r\nLicensing  Scheme is now not as heavy as before,  the\r\n\r\nROV and the Traffic Police will be asked to look into\r\n\r\nthe Member's suggestion of allowing the taxis to wait\r\n\r\nat taxi stops where adequate space is available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang is concerned about the bus\r\n\r\nservices  in  Sembawang  and  at  Marsiling.  He  has\r\n\r\ncomplained  about the irregular services, the  dirty\r\n\r\ncondition of the buses and windows not being able  to\r\n\r\nshut properly and causing inconvenience to passengers\r\n\r\nduring rainy days. Generally, there is no doubt  that\r\n\r\nthe  bus services have improved. But it does not mean\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  perfect and there are  no  problems.\r\n\r\nThere are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblems.  But  every effort is made to  improve  the\r\n\r\nservice  generally  and that  takes  time.  When  the\r\n\r\ncentral  workshop  and  other workshops  at  the  bus\r\n\r\ndepots  are  completed in the next one or two  years,\r\n\r\nthe  improvement would be more rapid. At the  present\r\n\r\nmoment  the  facilities  to  provide  the  preventive\r\n\r\nmaintenance,  repair of buses and so  on  are  rather\r\n\r\nlimited  because of the inadequacy in the  facilities\r\n\r\nprovided. The bus services in both the Sembawang  and\r\n\r\nMarsiling areas have also been improved over the last\r\n\r\ntwo years in line with the general improvement of the\r\n\r\nSBS  services. The SBS will continue to  improve  its\r\n\r\nservices by re-routing and adding more buses  if  the\r\n\r\ndemand justifies it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also complained about the bunching\r\n\r\nof   buses  together  at  times  and  sometimes   the\r\n\r\npassengers have to wait for a long time for a bus.  I\r\n\r\nwish  to  inform him that there are many  buses  from\r\n\r\ndifferent  services running along  a  certain  common\r\n\r\nroute. For instance, Sembawang Road is served  by  31\r\n\r\nbuses  per  hour, that is one bus every  two  minutes\r\n\r\nduring  peak  hours. Since the buses plying  any  one\r\n\r\nservice  are scheduled independently from  the  buses\r\n\r\nplying other services, it is possible for a few buses\r\n\r\nfrom different services to arrive at the bus stop all\r\n\r\nat  about  the same time, especially during the  peak\r\n\r\nhours.  So we have this bunching-up problem of  buses\r\n\r\nat  the bus stops. But, on the other hand, during the\r\n\r\noff-peak periods the time interval between two  buses\r\n\r\nof  a  certain service could be as long as 15 minutes\r\n\r\nand  it  is  possible that because of a bus  breaking\r\n\r\ndown  the commuters would have to wait up to half  an\r\n\r\nhour  for  the  next  bus.  However,  this  type   of\r\n\r\ndisruption  of service has been greatly reduced  with\r\n\r\nthe improved maintenance and better buses used by the\r\n\r\nSBS.  As  my  Minister  has  mentioned  earlier,  the\r\n\r\nbreakdown of buses has been reduced from 750 a day in\r\n\r\n1974  to 110 buses breaking down a day now. There  is\r\n\r\ntherefore a vast improvement in this respect. It is a\r\n\r\nvery  rare occasion when a commuter has to  wait  for\r\n\r\nmore  than  an hour for a bus. This sort of  occasion\r\n\r\nhappens only when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  massive  traffic  jam  due  to  traffic\r\n\r\naccidents  or  other causes which in  turn  seriously\r\n\r\naffect the bus services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has raised a few points. He\r\n\r\nhas complained about the counter staff showing a lack\r\n\r\nof  courtesy and helpfulness when serving the public.\r\n\r\n[Interruption]  No, he did not? All right.  Like  all\r\n\r\ncounter officers, they are asked, to be polite to the\r\n\r\npublic.  He mentioned about the buses moving  out  of\r\n\r\nbus  lanes. I think the Minister has replied to  that\r\n\r\nand  I have also mentioned that. But in practice  the\r\n\r\nbus  drivers have been encouraged to drive within the\r\n\r\nbus  lanes wherever possible. He has mentioned  about\r\n\r\nthe  spillage from lorries carrying sand and  stones.\r\n\r\nThe officers from the Ministry of the Environment and\r\n\r\nthe Traffic Police do take enforcement action against\r\n\r\nspillage  from lorries, The lorry users  and  drivers\r\n\r\nare  encouraged  not to overload  their  lorries  and\r\n\r\ndrive  carefully to avoid spillage. The  covering  of\r\n\r\nlorries may help but does not prevent spillage if the\r\n\r\nlorries  are not properly loaded and driven. We  have\r\n\r\nno  intention  to  make it a general compulsion  that\r\n\r\nloads  on  lorries have to be covered although  lorry\r\n\r\nusers   and   drivers  are  encouraged  to   do   so.\r\n\r\nEnforcement officers will, however, see  to  it  that\r\n\r\nwhere  loads  carried are light and  are  of  a  fine\r\n\r\nnature and are likely to be blown off the lorries  by\r\n\r\nwind, then such loads should be covered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also complained about too many\r\n\r\ntraffic signs at certain road junctions. There  is  a\r\n\r\ncommittee on traffic signs. I do agree with him  that\r\n\r\nat  certain  road junctions there are too many  signs\r\n\r\nwhich  confuse the motorists. If the Member  and  all\r\n\r\nthe other Members in this House could help by writing\r\n\r\nin  to the committee - I think the Member for Kampong\r\n\r\nChai Chee does write in to the committee now and then\r\n\r\nto inform the committee of certain junctions with too\r\n\r\nmany  of these signs - I am sure they will look  into\r\n\r\nthe  matter. He also has mentioned whether Government\r\n\r\nvehicles on official duties should be allowed to park\r\n\r\nin  areas  prohibited  by road traffic  signs.  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  the  commission of offences is not encouraged\r\n\r\nnor allowed, even if it is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  vehicle on official duties. If  it  is  a\r\n\r\ncase  of emergency, it is for the offender to explain\r\n\r\nthe  nature  of  the emergency to the  Magistrate  in\r\n\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be pre-arranged, or the Traffic Police\r\n\r\ncould  be informed on the spot of the nature  of  the\r\n\r\nemergency,  For  example, in  case  of  a  fire,  the\r\n\r\nfiremen  would be fighting the fire, and there  would\r\n\r\nbe  fire engines, ambulance, and so on. And if  there\r\n\r\nare Traffic Police on the spot, they would understand\r\n\r\nthe  need  for parking of such vehicles against  road\r\n\r\ntraffic signs. I think that is all right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member complained about not enough U-turns along\r\n\r\ncertain  roads and quoted the example of  a  motorist\r\n\r\ngoing  from Serangoon Road to Punggol had to  make  a\r\n\r\nwrong turn at Woodsville Circus into Jalan Toa Payoh.\r\n\r\nWell,  he has himself to blame. If he is alert, after\r\n\r\nturning  into Jalan Toa Payoh, he should straightaway\r\n\r\nturn  left  and  get back into Serangoon  Road  again\r\n\r\nthrough Moonstone Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Yes, I use that road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Yes.

When he makes a mistake, as I said, he has\r\n\r\nhimself  to  blame.  Anyway, if the  Member  has  any\r\n\r\nsuggestions  on the provision of U-turns,  I  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  he writes to the Roads Branch of the PWD  which\r\n\r\nhave  all  the experts and traffic planners  to  look\r\n\r\ninto the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank the\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister of State for his answer, but he  has\r\n\r\nleft  out  two points.

The\r\n\r\nsecond point is about buses emitting obnoxious  black\r\n\r\nsmoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, the Traffic Police and the\r\n\r\nEnforcement  Squad of the ROV do take action  against\r\n\r\nbuses  with smoky exhausts.

I  wish to inform him that the SBS, in  fact,\r\n\r\nhas   been  paying  great  attention  to  this.   But\r\n\r\nunfortunately as I mentioned earlier, this takes time\r\n\r\nto  overcome. There are too many buses. The  SBS  now\r\n\r\noperates over 2,000 buses and sometimes after a rainy\r\n\r\nnight  the buses just have to go on to the road  with\r\n\r\nthe seats still wet. But they do give instructions to\r\n\r\nthe bus conductors to clean the buses. There are rags\r\n\r\nprovided for them to wipe the seats dry and  to  keep\r\n\r\nthem  clean.  If  the  Member  has  come  across  any\r\n\r\nparticular  bus  which is not  kept  clean.  I  would\r\n\r\nappreciate it if he lets the SBS know by taking  down\r\n\r\nthe  bus  numbers,  the time of  the  incidents,  and\r\n\r\naction will be taken against them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to save\r\n\r\ntime  I  will just raise my points in question  form.\r\n\r\nThe  Senior  Minister of State has  said  that  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of this announced reduction in import  duties\r\n\r\nand  ARF for taxis, he expected an improvement in the\r\n\r\ntaxi  service. My question is: does it therefore mean\r\n\r\nthat  the  imposition of such  a  fee  in  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance  was meant as a disincentive for an improved\r\n\r\nservice? In other words, was it meant to obstruct  an\r\n\r\nimproved service?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is related. Does he mean that it\r\n\r\nis  the deliberate policy of the Government to impose\r\n\r\na  higher  fee and thereafter reduce it to show  that\r\n\r\nthe Government is benevolent?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question. The area licensing fee will be\r\n\r\nreduced  from 1st April, from $4 to $2  for  a  daily\r\n\r\nlicence and from $80 to $40 for a monthly licence. He\r\n\r\nexpects an increase in the number of taxis after this\r\n\r\nnew  rate of fees. Does he mean, therefore,  that  he\r\n\r\nwants more taxis to go to the City area now? Or  does\r\n\r\nit  mean that he was quite satisfied that the initial\r\n\r\nfee would not affect the taxi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npopulation in the City and that there were sufficient\r\n\r\ntaxis to serve the people there?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question. There is one junction near\r\n\r\nKilliney  Road.  I think it is Somerset  Road,  where\r\n\r\nroadside trees were planted. As a result, you  cannot\r\n\r\nsee  the traffic lights; so a letter was sent to  the\r\n\r\npress  complaining  about  it.  The  answer  to  this\r\n\r\ncomplaint in the press was that, instead of  removing\r\n\r\nthose  trees  planted wrongly, they  put  up  another\r\n\r\ntraffic  light  about one metre away from  the  first\r\n\r\none.  So  there are now two traffic lights  within  a\r\n\r\ndistance of one metre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, if I may be allowed to go\r\n\r\nback  to the basic principles of the introduction  of\r\n\r\nthe  area licensing fees on taxis. As I have  briefly\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier, taxis like private cars do not use\r\n\r\nthe road space efficiently, although it is a form  of\r\n\r\npublic  transport.  But it is  not  a  high  capacity\r\n\r\npublic  transport.  The whole  purpose  of  the  Area\r\n\r\nLicensing  Scheme  is to give priority  to  the  high\r\n\r\ncapacity  public  transport vehicles converging  into\r\n\r\nthe  CBD.  Therefore, when the Area Licensing  Scheme\r\n\r\nwas introduced, the object was to screen off the non-efficient   road  user  from  contributing   to   the\r\n\r\ncongestion  in  the  urban  road  network.   It   was\r\n\r\ndifficult at that time to anticipate the response  of\r\n\r\ntaxis  coming  into the central area  when  the  area\r\n\r\nlicensing measure was extended to include taxis.  But\r\n\r\nafter  conducting surveys and taking down statistics,\r\n\r\nit  was found necessary to reduce the licence fee for\r\n\r\ntaxis,  not  because the objective was wrong  or  the\r\n\r\nprinciple was wrong but that this is a mechanism used\r\n\r\nin traffic management to adjust the need and the flow\r\n\r\nof commuters' vehicles in the Central area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to the point he raised on the junction of\r\n\r\nSomerset Road and Killiney Road, perhaps if he  could\r\n\r\nlet  me  know the exact position.

Union\r\n\r\nleaders  as a whole were able to maintain a  rational\r\n\r\napproach to the adverse effect of economic recession.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the overall satisfactory situation, a\r\n\r\nweakness   in   the  industrial  relations   practice\r\n\r\ndeserves  our attention. I refer to the frequency  of\r\n\r\nillegal industrial actions. In 1975, six out  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal 26 work stoppages were illegal. Last year,  two\r\n\r\nstrikes,  six  minor  work stoppages  and  a  go-slow\r\n\r\naction were staged without conducting a secret ballot\r\n\r\nto  obtain the majority consent of the union  members\r\n\r\naffected as required by law. In many cases, the union\r\n\r\nheadquarters or branch officials claimed ignorance of\r\n\r\nany  prior knowledge and invariably attributed  these\r\n\r\nto  spontaneous actions on the part of the  rank  and\r\n\r\nfile  members.  Ironically, these  protestations  are\r\n\r\ntantamount   to  an  admission  that  the  industrial\r\n\r\nactions taken were not only contrary to the law,  but\r\n\r\nalso in contravention of union rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An illustration is the recent illegal industrial\r\n\r\naction  in Metal Box Singapore Limited. The Company's\r\n\r\nemployees are organised in a house union known as the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Metal  Box  Workers'  Union.  On   1   5th\r\n\r\nFebruary, 19 union members in the factory applied for\r\n\r\na  day's  leave  on  16th February, the  day  before\r\n\r\nChinese  New  Year eve. The applications were  turned\r\n\r\ndown by the Personnel Office. On 16th February, these\r\n\r\nworkers  reported for work as usual at 2.30 p.m. for\r\n\r\ntheir  shift duties which were supposed to end at  11\r\n\r\np.m, that night. But at around 6.30 p.m, all of them\r\n\r\ndecided to walk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  of the factory, although their request for early\r\n\r\nrelease were earlier turned down by their supervisor.\r\n\r\nThe  walk-out  rendered  two production  lines  idle.\r\n\r\nUnion  officers could have stopped the illegal  walk-out.   They   failed   to  do   so   and   disclaimed\r\n\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another incident, some 60 workers stopped work\r\n\r\nfor  1 1/2 hours on 23rd February over an issue created\r\n\r\nby  the  Union.  The circumstances  leading  to  this\r\n\r\nillegal work stoppage are briefly as follows. On 14th\r\n\r\nFebruary  at  around  4  p.m. the  Union's  secretary\r\n\r\nrequested  the  management  to  advance  the   normal\r\n\r\nWednesday  pay day, which fell on 16th  February,  to\r\n\r\n15th  February. The request was turned  down  by  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of Metal Box because the notice  was  too\r\n\r\nshort.  The  Union  then demanded  that  the  workers\r\n\r\nshould   be  paid  full  wages,  inclusive   of   all\r\n\r\nallowances, due to them in respect of the week ending\r\n\r\n20th February, on the following pay day which fell on\r\n\r\n23rd  February.  The  Union  made  this  unreasonable\r\n\r\ndemand  knowing  full  well  that  it  would  not  be\r\n\r\npossible for management to work out the full salaries\r\n\r\nof  the  600-strong workforce in time, as the factory\r\n\r\nwould  be  closed for the Chinese New  Year  holidays\r\n\r\nfrom  17th to 21st February. The management suggested\r\n\r\ntwo  alternatives. The first was to pay  the  workers\r\n\r\ntheir  basic  wages on 23rd February, and  the  other\r\n\r\nallowances on the following Wednesday. The second was\r\n\r\nto pay full wages to the workers on 24th February and\r\n\r\nnot  on 23rd February as demanded by the Union.  Both\r\n\r\nalternatives  were not acceptable to the  Union.  The\r\n\r\nmanagement then tried but failed to persuade all  the\r\n\r\nthree  wage clerks who are also members of the Union.\r\n\r\nto return for work on 21st February over the holiday,\r\n\r\nso  that full wages of their comrades could be worked\r\n\r\nout in time for payment on 23rd February. The Company\r\n\r\nfinally  decided  to  pay only basic  wages  on  23rd\r\n\r\nFebruary  and  the other allowances on the  following\r\n\r\nWednesday.   On  23rd  February, the  workers   were\r\n\r\naccordingly paid their basic wages in respect of  the\r\n\r\npreceding  week, Some 60 workers then  downed  tools.\r\n\r\nThe  Union  again  claimed  ignorance  of  any  prior\r\n\r\nknowledge of the illegal industrial action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third incident occurred on 4th March when the\r\n\r\nunion  members in two production lines staged  a  go-slow  which cut the production of the affected  lines\r\n\r\nfor the day by about 30%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is Government's policy to promote the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  a  healthy non-communist  democratic\r\n\r\ntrade union movement, as an essential element in  our\r\n\r\neconomic life. But industrial action in contravention\r\n\r\nof  the  constitution and rules of the  trade  unions\r\n\r\nwill  not  in  any way foster trade union  democracy.\r\n\r\nWild-cat  industrial action would defeat the national\r\n\r\npurpose  of  more  exports and  more  investments  to\r\n\r\ngenerate more wealth. Non-observation of union  rules\r\n\r\nin the conduct of any form of industrial action would\r\n\r\nerode   trade  union  discipline.  Without  effective\r\n\r\nexercise of union discipline it would be idle to talk\r\n\r\nof increasing productivity and of creating employment\r\n\r\nthrough   capital   investment.  It   is   desirable.\r\n\r\ntherefore,  to  ensure that any  form  of  industrial\r\n\r\naction  initiated by a branch committee is  conducted\r\n\r\naccording  to  the constitutional provisions  of  the\r\n\r\ntrade union concerned and with prior sanction of  the\r\n\r\nUnion headquarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing subsection (1) of section 28 of\r\n\r\nthe Act any strike or industrial action is illegal if\r\n\r\nit  is  taken without obtaining the consent by secret\r\n\r\nballot  of  the majority of the members so  affected.\r\n\r\nSubsection  (2)  of  the same  section  makes  it  an\r\n\r\noffence  for  a  trade union or the  members  of  its\r\n\r\nexecutive committee to commence, promote, organise or\r\n\r\nfinance such illegal strike or industrial action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions are inadequate. The Registrar of\r\n\r\nTrade  Unions has no power to deal with persons  who,\r\n\r\nthough  fully acquainted with the illegal  strike  or\r\n\r\nindustrial  action,  refuse  to  cooperate   in   his\r\n\r\ninvestigation.  The Registrar is  powerless  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  ordinary members or paid employees of the trade\r\n\r\nunion who not only commence, promote or organise  but\r\n\r\nalso  participate  in illegal strikes  or  industrial\r\n\r\nactions. He is also unable to take action when  union\r\n\r\nbranch  committees take illegal strike or  industrial\r\n\r\naction in contravention of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  union rules or by-laws. Clause 4 of  the  Bill\r\n\r\ntherefore   seeks  to  remedy  these   defects.   The\r\n\r\nRegistrar is empowered to require any person  who  is\r\n\r\nacquainted  with  the  illegal strike  or  industrial\r\n\r\naction  to  fully  assist him in his  investigations.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  unions who are involved in such  illegal\r\n\r\naction  are also brought within the ambit of  section\r\n\r\n28  of  the Act. In addition, it makes it an  offence\r\n\r\nfor  any  person, including paid officials  and  non-union members, to instigate or incite others to  take\r\n\r\npart in illegal strikes or industrial actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing provisions of the Trade Unions\r\n\r\nAct,  a person who is under the age of 21, but  above\r\n\r\nthe  age of 18, may be a member of a trade union, but\r\n\r\nhe  is  not  allowed to hold office.  Representations\r\n\r\nhave  been made by the NTUC. SILO and PIEU, that this\r\n\r\nstipulation has handicapped the efficient running  of\r\n\r\ntrade  unions in establishments which employ a  large\r\n\r\npercentage  of young persons such as the  electronics\r\n\r\nand   garment   factories.  An  analysis   of   union\r\n\r\nmembership reveals that there are at present about  1\r\n\r\n5,000 unionised employees who are between the age  of\r\n\r\n18  and 21. If the present law is rigidly adhered to.\r\n\r\nthe  unions  may  not  be  able  to  find  sufficient\r\n\r\neligible  members to stand for elections  as  office-bearers  in certain branches where there  is  a  high\r\n\r\nconcentration  of  young workers. This  would  create\r\n\r\ndifficulties in unionisation of establishments  which\r\n\r\nemploy  a  large  percentage of  young  persons.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has therefore decided to  lower  the  age\r\n\r\nqualification from 21 to 18 years for a union  member\r\n\r\nto  be  eligible for holding office. Clause 5 of  the\r\n\r\nBill  adds  a  provision to section  29  of  the  Act\r\n\r\nvesting  the Minister with the authority to  allow  a\r\n\r\nunion  member who is below 21 but above 1 8 years  of\r\n\r\nage  to hold office in or to be a trustee of a  trade\r\n\r\nunion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the amendments made to\r\n\r\nthe  Trade Unions Act in 1967, the democractic  trade\r\n\r\nunion   movement   has   gone   through   a   dynamic\r\n\r\nmodernisation  process. The number of  employees  who\r\n\r\ncarry union membership cards has now reached an  all-time  record high figure of 221,936 as at the end  of 1976.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNinety-three  per  cent of these unionised  employees\r\n\r\nbelong to 51 unions affiliated to the National Trades\r\n\r\nUnion    Congress    (NTUC).   Another    significant\r\n\r\ndevelopment  is  that there has been  an  appreciable\r\n\r\nimprovement  in  trade  union finance  following  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of the check-off system in May 1970.  As\r\n\r\n31st December, 1976\r\n\r\nimplemented  by  39  NTUC  affiliates  whose   assets\r\n\r\ntotalled  nearly  $17 million. A total  of  seven  of\r\n\r\nthese  unions have assets of $1 million or more.  The\r\n\r\nassets of the richest of them exceed $4 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fortunate in the Republic that there has\r\n\r\nbeen, by and large, no abuse of union funds in recent\r\n\r\nyears.   It   is   an  eloquent  testimony   to   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of our present trade union leadership.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  should  provide for  proper  safeguards\r\n\r\nregarding   the  use  of  union  funds.  At   present\r\n\r\nsubsection (1) of section 16 of the Act only empowers\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to freeze the bank account of  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion  after  it  has been served with  a  notice  of\r\n\r\nderegistration. In practice, notice of deregistration\r\n\r\nis  normally served on unions involved in  activities\r\n\r\nprejudicial to national security and public order. No\r\n\r\nprovision  was made to freeze a union's bank  account\r\n\r\nwhen  only  the  funds  of a trade  union  are  under\r\n\r\ninvestigation. When millions of dollars  are  passing\r\n\r\nthrough the accounts of trade unions, there is a need\r\n\r\nfor  additional preventive measures to protect  union\r\n\r\nfunds. The Government would be failing in its duty if\r\n\r\nadequate  measures  are not taken  to  safeguard  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the rank and file members in such funds,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill therefore empowers the Minister\r\n\r\nto  freeze a trade union's bank account, for a period\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding  three months, if an investigation  is\r\n\r\nmade   by   the   Registrar  of  Trade  Unions,   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of Police, the Commissioner  of  Inland\r\n\r\nRevenue  or  the  Director of the  Corrupt  Practices\r\n\r\nInvestigation  Bureau regarding the improper  use  or\r\n\r\nmisapplication  of the funds of the trade  union.  In\r\n\r\norder   to   ensure   that  union   officials   under\r\n\r\ninvestigation do not tamper with union  funds  during\r\n\r\nthe period\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  the union's bank account is frozen, appropriate\r\n\r\namendments will also be made to Regulations 25 of the\r\n\r\nTrade   Unions  Regulations  to  deprive  the   union\r\n\r\nofficials concerned of the power of using union funds\r\n\r\nuntil the investigation is completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the introduction of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill, the Member for Toa Payoh has expressed his\r\n\r\nconcern  to me that the freezing of the union banking\r\n\r\naccount   may  result  in  hardship  for  the   union\r\n\r\nconcerned  by making it impossible for the  union  to\r\n\r\nmeet its legitimate expenditure of a recurrent nature\r\n\r\nsuch  as  staff  salaries, rent.  PUB  and  telephone\r\n\r\ncharges.  I  am  indeed grateful to  the  Member  for\r\n\r\ndrawing my attention to this possible difficulty  and\r\n\r\naccordingly, I shall be moving an amendment to clause\r\n\r\n3  to enable such legitimate recurrent expenditure to\r\n\r\nbe  expended subject to the approval of the Registrar\r\n\r\nof Trade Unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Unions Act at present has no provisions to\r\n\r\ncontrol   the   investment  of  union  funds.   Every\r\n\r\nregistered trade union makes provisions in its  rules\r\n\r\nempowering  its executive committee to  invest  union\r\n\r\nfunds  in  any manner as it deems fit.  Many  of  the\r\n\r\nunions  invest  their  surplus  funds  in  the   NTUC\r\n\r\ncooperatives.  A  few unions have bought  substantial\r\n\r\namounts  of  shares through the Stock  Exchange.  The\r\n\r\nvalue  of these shares has since declined. With  most\r\n\r\nunions  becoming  affluent, an increasing  number  of\r\n\r\nthem may yet invest their surplus funds in stocks and\r\n\r\nshares.  As  stocks  and shares are  not  the  safest\r\n\r\nsecurities  for investment, some form of  control  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to safeguard the use of union funds in this\r\n\r\nrespect.  Clause  6  of the Bill therefore  seeks  to\r\n\r\nprohibit  trade  union funds from being  invested  in\r\n\r\nsecurities except those approved by the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  Trade Unions (Amendment)  Bill.  In\r\n\r\ndoing  so. I am confident that I have the support  of\r\n\r\nthe trade union\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmovement  in  Singapore as well as my  colleagues  in\r\n\r\nthis House. There are, of course, some provisions  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill on which trade unionists may want  to  have\r\n\r\nclarifications  or assurances from the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour.  Apart  from  that,  the  Bill  is  generally\r\n\r\nacceptable  and  does in no way seek  to  hamper  the\r\n\r\noperation of a responsible trade union movement, as I\r\n\r\nintend to explain later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One particular provision, which I am most pleased to\r\n\r\nnote,  is  that  contained in clause 5  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\npertaining  to  the amendment of section  29  of  the\r\n\r\nprincipal Act. This House may recall that in 1974 and\r\n\r\n1975  I drew the attention of the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nto  the desirability of amending the Trade Unions Act\r\n\r\nto   lower  the  statutory  minimum  age  for   union\r\n\r\nmembership and for holding office in trade unions. As\r\n\r\nI  stated at that time, there was a compelling reason\r\n\r\nfor  lowering  the age requirement for union  members\r\n\r\nand  union  officers. The compelling reason  is  that\r\n\r\npersons are entering into the labour market under the\r\n\r\nage  of  18 years in increasing numbers, It  was  not\r\n\r\nunusual in the last few years, and more so today,  to\r\n\r\nfind  new  establishments staffed with a majority  of\r\n\r\nworkers   under   18  years.  Under  the   prevailing\r\n\r\nprovision,  young workers under the age of  18  years\r\n\r\nare  not supposed to be members of a union and  young\r\n\r\nworkers  between the age of 21 and 18 years  are  not\r\n\r\npermitted  to  hold  any  office  in  a  union.  Such\r\n\r\nstatutory  restriction is out  of  keeping  with  the\r\n\r\nprevailing social situation in Singapore and, in that\r\n\r\nsense,  has  become outdated. The proposed  amendment\r\n\r\nrectifies  the  matter by, in a manner  of  speaking,\r\n\r\nputting the clock forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are those who may quibble about the need\r\n\r\nfor young workers between the age of 21 years and  18\r\n\r\nyears  to  obtain  the approval of the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  to hold office in a trade union, I, on behalf\r\n\r\nof  the  National Trades Union Congress, welcome  the\r\n\r\nproposed provisions as they stand in clause 5 of  the\r\n\r\nBill.  The  lowering  of the minimum  age  for  union\r\n\r\nmembership  and for holding office in  the  union  is\r\n\r\nmost   timely.   Otherwise,  there   would   be   the\r\n\r\nparadoxical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsituation of selected young persons between  the  age\r\n\r\nof 21 years and 18 years being considered matured and\r\n\r\nfit   enough  to  be  commissioned  officers  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Armed  Forces,  while  no  young   persons\r\n\r\nbetween  the  age  of 21 years and 18  years  can  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  matured and fit enough to be officers  of\r\n\r\ntrade  unions. The proposed provisions put right  the\r\n\r\nmatter by permitting young persons between the age of\r\n\r\n21  years and 1 8 years, who have shown themselves to\r\n\r\nbe  responsible,  to hold office in their  respective\r\n\r\ntrade  unions.  I do not think there  should  be  any\r\n\r\nconfusion  between  the  eligibility  of  all   young\r\n\r\npersons  between the age of 21 years and 18 years  to\r\n\r\nbe   officers  of  a  trade  union, and  the  actual\r\n\r\nselection of a smaller number of young persons to  be\r\n\r\nthe  officers of the respective trade union. With the\r\n\r\nlowering  of  the statutory minimum age  for  holding\r\n\r\noffice  in a union, it is now possible for  the  NTUC\r\n\r\nand its affiliated trade unions to groom and train at\r\n\r\nan  earlier  stage such young persons to  become  the\r\n\r\nfuture leaders of the trade union movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, the leadership of the trade union\r\n\r\nmovement must be judged by its ability to secure  and\r\n\r\npromote the welfare and interest of the rank and file\r\n\r\nmembership, without unduly prejudicing  the  general\r\n\r\nwelfare  and  interest  of the larger  community, in\r\n\r\nwhich the members live and work. I am confident  that\r\n\r\nthe  National Trades Union Congress and my colleagues\r\n\r\nin  this  House  share  my view  on  the  responsible\r\n\r\nleadership of a constructive trade union movement and\r\n\r\nwelcome  the  provisions of  clause  4  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\npertaining to section 28 of the principal Act.  There\r\n\r\nare,  of course, those who, again, will quibble about\r\n\r\nthe  supposedly  restrictive effect of  the  proposed\r\n\r\nprovision which, among other things, seek to penalise\r\n\r\nmembers  of a trade union participating in an illegal\r\n\r\nstrike or industrial action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members of this House may recall, the prevailing\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the principal Act, regarding  illegal\r\n\r\nstrike  or industrial action in contravention of  the\r\n\r\nsecret ballot requirement or in contravention of  the\r\n\r\nrules  of  the respective trade union, have  been  in\r\n\r\nforce for the past 11 years or so. But the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprevailing provisions, while penalising an  offending\r\n\r\ntrade union or the officers of such trade union,  are\r\n\r\nsilent  on  the  part played by  the  rank  and  file\r\n\r\nmembers  in  an illegal strike or industrial  action.\r\n\r\nThe  result  is  that it can be a rather  intolerable\r\n\r\nsituation  for  officers  being  confronted  by   the\r\n\r\nmembers, who are pressing for an illegal  strike  or\r\n\r\nindustrial  action  and who are too  aware  of  their\r\n\r\nbeing  not  subject to any sanction  of  the  law  in\r\n\r\nparticipating  in  an  illegal strike  or  industrial\r\n\r\naction  under  the prevailing legislation.  I  should\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  a logical matter, if not for  anything\r\n\r\nelse, that if a strike or industrial action is deemed\r\n\r\nto  be  illegal  for any failure to comply  with  the\r\n\r\nsecret  ballot  requirements  or  the  rules  of  the\r\n\r\nrespective   trade  union, then  all   persons   who\r\n\r\nparticipate  in any manner or to any extent  in  such\r\n\r\nillegal strike or industrial action should be subject\r\n\r\nto the same sanction, irrespective of whatever office\r\n\r\nthey   hold  or  their  status  in  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in welcoming the proposed provisions under\r\n\r\nclause  4  of the Bill, I must, however,  express  my\r\n\r\nstrong misgiving in that the proposed provisions  are\r\n\r\nnot  as  comprehensive as they should be. I am  parti\r\n\r\ncularly  concerned that the proposed  provisions  are\r\n\r\ndirected   against   members   of   a   trade   union\r\n\r\nparticipating  in  an  illegal strike  or  industrial\r\n\r\naction,   but   are   strangely  silent   about   the\r\n\r\napplication of a sanction of the law on persons,  who\r\n\r\nare   not   members  of  any  trade  union  and   who\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  an  illegal  strike  or   industrial\r\n\r\naction.  It is true in the principal Act,  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  is  defined to include a temporary combination\r\n\r\nof  workers  with the object of promoting, organising\r\n\r\nor  financing strikes. But knowing how the  officials\r\n\r\nof  the Labour Ministry react to something out of the\r\n\r\nordinary,  I  do  not  expect  there  would  be   any\r\n\r\nprosecution of un-organised workers participating  in\r\n\r\nan  illegal  strike or industrial action.  An  excuse\r\n\r\nthat  might  be  advanced by the Ministry  of  Labour\r\n\r\nofficials  would probably be that, since such  groups\r\n\r\nof  workers are not formally organised, it  would  be\r\n\r\ndifficult  for them to comply with the secret  ballot\r\n\r\nrequirement. I personally do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhope  that  the  scenario I have just sketched  would\r\n\r\nnever  take  place.  But the probability  of  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation  arising is not all that  insignificant.  I\r\n\r\nhave  in mind two particular situations. One  is  the\r\n\r\nminority  of  non-members in  an  establishment,  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  whose employees are  represented  by  a\r\n\r\nregistered trade union, The other is the entire group\r\n\r\nof  workers  employed  by  a  contractor  or  a  sub-contractor,   as  contract  workers  are  notoriously\r\n\r\nimpossible  to  be organised into a registered  trade\r\n\r\nunion.   If  such  workers  can  commence, promote,\r\n\r\norganise, participate or otherwise act in furtherance\r\n\r\nof  any  illegal strike or industrial action and  get\r\n\r\naway with it, it would be extremely demoralising  for\r\n\r\nother  workers  who are members of  registered  trade\r\n\r\nunions. I hope the Minister for Labour will make  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  amendments to the proposed  provisions  to\r\n\r\nprevent such a situation arising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I must express my puzzlement over clause 6\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill relating to section 50 of the principal\r\n\r\nAct. In addition to the prevailing prohibition on the\r\n\r\nuse  of trade union funds for political purposes, the\r\n\r\nproposed  provisions seek to restrict the  investment\r\n\r\nof  union funds in securities, The principal Act  has\r\n\r\nbeen  in  force for some thirty years  and  all  that\r\n\r\ntime,  it  has  not  been  considered  necessary   to\r\n\r\nintroduce any restriction on the investment of  union\r\n\r\nfunds  in  securities. Though the principal  Act  has\r\n\r\nbeen  silent  on this point, the Registrar  of  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions, in  the  course  of  exercising  his   wide\r\n\r\nadministrative  function, has  more  or  less  guided\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  in  their investment  of  trade  union\r\n\r\nfunds.  I  am  sure the NTUC and all  its  affiliated\r\n\r\ntrade  unions have not, in their investment of  their\r\n\r\nrespective  funds in securities, given any  cause  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to prompt him to introduce the proposed\r\n\r\nrestriction.  Apart from that, I also hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  would not be unduly restrictive  in  giving\r\n\r\nhis approval to securities in which unions may invest\r\n\r\ntheir   funds.   I  have  in  mind  the   cooperative\r\n\r\nenterprises and projects, with which the NTUC and its\r\n\r\naffiliated   trade   unions  are   associated.   Such\r\n\r\nenterprises may not be satisfactory from the point of\r\n\r\nview of yield from or return on investment but they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreatly  benefit the members of the trade unions  and\r\n\r\ntheir families in a way which cannot be evaluated  in\r\n\r\nthe statement of accounts or the balance sheet of the\r\n\r\ntrade union concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   I   wish  to  comment  on  the  Trade   Unions\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill. As a trade unionist I must say that\r\n\r\nthe  Bill seems at first sight to be more restrictive\r\n\r\nthan  beneficial to the trade unions. But  if  it  is\r\n\r\naccepted  that  trade unions and their  members  have\r\n\r\ntheir  obligations  to  society, then  the  proposed\r\n\r\namendments have to be viewed in the light of  whether\r\n\r\nthey  are compatible with the social responsibilities\r\n\r\nof trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My comment, however, is directed to the proposed\r\n\r\nsection  1 6(2) of the principal Act, as set  out  in\r\n\r\nclause  3  of  the Bill. A superficial impression  is\r\n\r\nthat  section  16(2) is mainly an  extension  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting  section  16(1), whereby  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  may,  if  he is satisfied  that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nlikelihood  of  a  misuse of union funds,  order  the\r\n\r\nbanking  account of the union concerned to be frozen.\r\n\r\nBut  on further scrutiny, the proposed section 1 6(2)\r\n\r\nis radically different from section 16(1) both in its\r\n\r\neffect on and in its implication to trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one thing, the existing section 16(1) deals with\r\n\r\nthe  situation of a union under notice, in accordance\r\n\r\nwith  section  1  5(2), of  deregistration  by   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Trade Unions. In such a context there is\r\n\r\nevery  likelihood for the funds of  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nconcerned  to be misused and every justification  for\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to intervene to prevent the  misuse  of\r\n\r\ntrade  union  funds. But in relation to the  proposed\r\n\r\nsection 16(2), the situation likely to be encountered\r\n\r\nis  entirely  different from that  encountered  under\r\n\r\nsection 16(1). It is not necessary that a trade union\r\n\r\nunder  investigation is likely to be deregistered  on\r\n\r\ncompletion of the investigation. Moreover, it  is  by\r\n\r\nno  means  certain  that the investigation  will  not\r\n\r\nvindicate   the   reputation  of  the   trade   union\r\n\r\nconcerned. I am aware that the power to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconduct  such  investigation  is  confined   to   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Trade  Unions,  the  Commissioner   of\r\n\r\nPolice,  the Commissioner of Inland Revenue  and  the\r\n\r\nDirector of the CPIB, and the period for the freezing\r\n\r\nof  the  banking  account of the union  concerned  is\r\n\r\nrestricted to a maximum of three months.  What  I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned about is that there is no safeguard in  the\r\n\r\nproposed provision to ensure that an investigation is\r\n\r\nnot  commenced  unless the relevant public  authority\r\n\r\nhas  good  reasons  to believe the  investigation  is\r\n\r\nnecessary.  As  it  is, any  of  the  stated  public\r\n\r\nauthority  has the absolute discretion to  launch  an\r\n\r\ninvestigation into the improper use or misapplication\r\n\r\nof  union  funds. Thus on the basis of  a  frivolous.\r\n\r\nvexatious  or  malicious complaint, an  investigation\r\n\r\ncan  be  launched under the proposed  section  16(2).\r\n\r\nmuch  to the demoralisation and inconvenience of  the\r\n\r\ntrade union concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will, therefore, be grateful if the Minister can\r\n\r\ngive an assurance that an investigation, as envisaged\r\n\r\nin  the proposed section 16(2), will not be commenced\r\n\r\nexcept in accordance with an administrative procedure\r\n\r\nto   be   devised   by  the  Ministry,   to   prevent\r\n\r\ninvestigation for frivolous, vexatious  or  malicious\r\n\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly. I have a slight misgiving about the\r\n\r\nproposed section 9(2) as contained in clause 2 of the\r\n\r\nBill.  Ostensibly,  the proposed provision  seeks  to\r\n\r\nabolish  the  practice  of requiring  applicants  for\r\n\r\nregistration  of  trade unions to  affix  a  dollar's\r\n\r\nworth  of stamp to their applications and to  empower\r\n\r\nthe Minister to fix the fee for registration. In that\r\n\r\nway, the Ministry of Labour will be credited with the\r\n\r\nregistration  fee  which, at  present,  go  into  the\r\n\r\ncoffers  of the Ministry of Finance by way of revenue\r\n\r\nstamps.  But I am more concerned with the fact  that,\r\n\r\nunder  the proposed amendment, the Minister is  given\r\n\r\nthe   absolute  discretion  to  fix  the  amount   of\r\n\r\nregistration fee for application for registration  of\r\n\r\ntrade  unions.  I  hope  the Minister  will  give  an\r\n\r\nassurance  that  whatever fees are  to  be  fixed  in\r\n\r\nfuture   will  be  reasonable  in  relation  to   the\r\n\r\nprevailing  rate  of one dollar per  application  and\r\n\r\nwill not be so unreasonably increased in future as to\r\n\r\ndefeat the provision\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  section 17 of the Employment Act entrenching  the\r\n\r\nright  of workers to be members and officers of trade\r\n\r\nunions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Boon Teck has suggested that the proposed\r\n\r\namendments  to, section  28  should  also  make   it\r\n\r\nmandatory for non-unionised workers to take a  secret\r\n\r\nballot before embarking on any industrial action. The\r\n\r\nprimary objective of enacting the present section  28\r\n\r\nin  1966  was to prevent union officers from  abusing\r\n\r\ntheir powers by calling industrial action without the\r\n\r\nprior consent of the rank and file members.

In this instance the\r\n\r\nsecret   ballot  serves  as  a  significant  aid   in\r\n\r\nfostering  trade union democracy. It is not  intended\r\n\r\nto  curtail  the  right  of a  trade  union  to  take\r\n\r\nindustrial  action. The proposed amendments  to  this\r\n\r\nsection   are  aimed  at  furthering  the  democratic\r\n\r\nprocess  in  the  conduct of trade union  affairs  by\r\n\r\nmaking  it mandatory for the union members and branch\r\n\r\nofficials  to observe the rules and bylaws  of  their\r\n\r\nown union when they decide to take industrial action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an important social organisation such as a trade\r\n\r\nunion,  it is only right that the member's  right  to\r\n\r\nvote  for  industrial  action  should  go  with   the\r\n\r\nobligation  to  be bound by the union's  rule.  Since\r\n\r\nthese  provisions  are aimed at  fostering  at  trade\r\n\r\nunion  democracy  and  trade union  discipline,  they\r\n\r\ncould   not   be  made  applicable  to  non-unionised\r\n\r\nworkers.  Until  they are in possession  of  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion  membership card, the unorganised workers  who,\r\n\r\nby  and  large, are less well off than the  unionised\r\n\r\nworkers will remain, whether as a individual or as  a\r\n\r\ngroup,  outside  the  industrial relation  system  as\r\n\r\nregulated by the Industrial Relations Act. Lacking in\r\n\r\norganisational strength, they will not  be  protected\r\n\r\nby the bargaining power of a trade union. At the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame  time, they could not be expected to be  subject\r\n\r\nto  the  exercise of trade union discipline. In  this\r\n\r\ncontext,  it will go against the spirit and intention\r\n\r\nof the law to extend the secret ballot requirement to\r\n\r\nthe  unorganised  workers. The concern  of  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  over  wild-cat  industrial  action  by   non-unionised  workers is well taken. As I have mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier, a  total of four strikes and 10 minor  work\r\n\r\nstoppages occurred in 1976. Of this number, only  two\r\n\r\nminor  work  stoppages were staged  by  non-unionised\r\n\r\nworkers,  despite the fact that 69% of the  total  of\r\n\r\n713,200 employees in Singapore were still unorganised\r\n\r\nlast  year.  This compared with two strikes  and  six\r\n\r\nminor  work stoppages staged by union members without\r\n\r\na  secret ballot in contravention of the law as  well\r\n\r\nas their own union rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the unorganised contract workers who were\r\n\r\nsingled out for mention by the hon. Member, they seem\r\n\r\nto  have  little  inclination for industrial  action.\r\n\r\nThis  is  borne out by the fact that during the  past\r\n\r\nfive years, out of a total of 36 strikes and 78 minor\r\n\r\nwork  stoppages recorded by my Ministry, none involve\r\n\r\nunorganised  contract workers. There is therefore  no\r\n\r\ncompelling  reason for any legislative action  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken to deal with wild-cat industrial action by non-unionised workers. However, the hon. Member for  Boon\r\n\r\nTeck  can  be assured that the Government will  watch\r\n\r\nthe   situation  closely  and  if  the  need  arises,\r\n\r\nconsideration  will  be  given  to  amend  the  Trade\r\n\r\nDisputes Act whose provisions apply to both unionised\r\n\r\nand  non-unionised workers to ensure that  industrial\r\n\r\nharmony continues to prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also expressed concern that the proposed\r\n\r\nprovisions of section 50 might impede the  growth  of\r\n\r\nthe  NTUC  cooperative enterprises.  It  is  not  the\r\n\r\nintention  of  the proposed amendment to  impose  any\r\n\r\nrestrictions on sound investments. To do so would run\r\n\r\ncounter  to the Government's policy of assisting  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  trade union movement to attain  financial\r\n\r\nself-sufficiency. The proposed provisions in clause 6\r\n\r\nwill   not   affect   the   cooperative   enterprises\r\n\r\nestablished by the NTUC because approval has  already\r\n\r\nbeen given under the present paragraph (g)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  section  48 of the principal Act for trade  union\r\n\r\nfunds  to be expended on the promotion, organisation.\r\n\r\noperation   and   financing   of   such   cooperative\r\n\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member for Toa Payoh expressed concern\r\n\r\nthat  the  proposed  section  16(2)  might  lead   to\r\n\r\nfrivolous,  vexatious or malicious  investigation  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of  trade  union  funds.  There  is   no\r\n\r\ndisagreement  over  the object of the  new  provision\r\n\r\nwhich is to safeguard the union funds in the interest\r\n\r\nof the rank and file members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The points raised by the Member concern\r\n\r\nadministrative   procedures   in   connection    with\r\n\r\nimplementation. Under the existing relevant laws, the\r\n\r\nRegistrar   of   Trade  Unions,   the   Police,   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of  Inland Revenue and  the  CPIB  have\r\n\r\npowers  to  investigate into the use of  trade  union\r\n\r\nfunds.  The purpose of the proposed section 16(2)  is\r\n\r\nto  confer  the additional power to freeze  the  bank\r\n\r\naccount  of the trade union while such investigations\r\n\r\nare   in   progress.  Even  if  there  is   such   an\r\n\r\ninvestigation, the  freezing  of  the  union's  bank\r\n\r\naccount will not follow automatically. Each case will\r\n\r\nbe  considered  on its own merit. No action  will  be\r\n\r\ntaken  to freeze the bank account unless it is  found\r\n\r\nabsolutely necessary. This guideline has been adopted\r\n\r\nin  implementing the existing section  16(1)  of  the\r\n\r\nAct. This is borne out by the fact that hitherto  not\r\n\r\nall  the  unions  which were served with  notices  of\r\n\r\nderegistration  by  the  Registrar  had  their   bank\r\n\r\naccounts  frozen.  The hon. Member can  therefore  be\r\n\r\nassured that the new provision in section 16(2)  will\r\n\r\nnot    give   rise   to   frivolous   and   vexatious\r\n\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has also expressed concern that the\r\n\r\nfreezing  of  the union funds may be extended  beyond\r\n\r\nthe  initial period of three months. I wish to  point\r\n\r\nOut that three months will be a long enough period to\r\n\r\nestablish whether prima facie there is a case against\r\n\r\nthe union for improper use or misapplication of union\r\n\r\nfunds.  Hence, legally clause 3 provides for a freeze\r\n\r\nof three months only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question on new registration fee, the\r\n\r\nhon. Member knows that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  fixing of fees will be a joint decision  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour and the Ministry of Finance.
