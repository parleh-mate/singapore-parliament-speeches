The\r\n\r\nmuch  publicised  reason for the  introduction  of\r\n\r\nthese measures is to make the terms and conditions\r\n\r\nof  service  in the public sector comparable  with\r\n\r\nthose  prevailing in the private sector.  However,\r\n\r\nthe Government has made it known that employees in\r\n\r\nthe  Education service are to be excluded from the\r\n\r\nbenefits   of   the   various   schemes   recently\r\n\r\nintroduced  by  the Government to attract  and  to\r\n\r\nretain  the  best  in the public  service.  In  so\r\n\r\ndoing,   the  Government  has,  in  fact,  created\r\n\r\nfurther  anomalies in the terms and conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice for different groups of employees  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector  and  has,  therefore,  effectively\r\n\r\nnullified  all its past attempts to establish  the\r\n\r\nprinciples   of  fair  comparison   and   internal\r\n\r\nrelativity  within  the  public  service   as   an\r\n\r\nobjective  basis  in  determining  the  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions of work in the public service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now refer the Education\r\n\r\nMinister  to  the recent scheme of the  Government\r\n\r\nwhereby  a  monthly allowance is  to  be  paid  to\r\n\r\nemployees  in  the public service as  compensation\r\n\r\nfor  the  reduction  of  their  annual  leave  and\r\n\r\nmedical leave eligibility. Such a realistic scheme\r\n\r\nis much to be welcomed, except\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   the   Government  has  declared  that   all\r\n\r\nemployees  in  the  Education service  are  to  be\r\n\r\nexcluded from the scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the revised scheme, in respect of medical\r\n\r\nleave  eligibility, all public  officers  can  opt\r\n\r\neither  for  the maximum medical leave eligibility\r\n\r\nunder   the   old  scheme  without  any   monetary\r\n\r\nallowance, or for a reduced leave eligibility plus\r\n\r\na  monetary allowance equivalent to ten days' pay.\r\n\r\nThe  full  medical leave eligibility is a  nominal\r\n\r\nbenefit of which a very small proportion of public\r\n\r\nemployees  have availed themselves  to  the  whole\r\n\r\nextent.  As  far as possible, they  prefer  to  be\r\n\r\nspared  the  circumstances whereby  they  have  to\r\n\r\nutilise any portion of their hospitalisation leave eligibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the revised scheme, therefore, those public\r\n\r\nofficers  who normally do not fully utilise  their\r\n\r\nleave  eligibility will, by opting to  participate\r\n\r\nin  the  scheme, gain by converting their  surplus\r\n\r\nportion   of   leave  eligibility,  which   is   a\r\n\r\ncontingent  interest, into  an  entitlement  of  a\r\n\r\nmonetary  allowance equivalent to ten  days'  pay.\r\n\r\nThe   exclusion   of   education   officers   from\r\n\r\nparticipation under the scheme in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nconversion  of  surplus medical leave  eligibility\r\n\r\ninto  a  monetary allowance results in a  positive\r\n\r\ndisadvantage  to education officers in  comparison\r\n\r\nwith  their  colleagues in the administrative  and executive services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the abovementioned scheme, the\r\n\r\ndecision of the Government to exclude officers  in\r\n\r\nthe Education service from the scheme seems to  be\r\n\r\nbased  on  an  oversight. While  officers  in  the\r\n\r\nEducation  service  generally  do  not  enjoy  any\r\n\r\nannual  leave eligibility, they do have  the  same\r\n\r\nmedical  leave eligibility as their colleagues  in\r\n\r\nthe  administrative and executive services of  the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view, therefore, that all officers in\r\n\r\nthe Education service, whether performing teaching\r\n\r\nor  administrative duties, should be  accorded  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  opt for a payment  of  a  special\r\n\r\nmonthly  allowance  in lieu of a  greater  medical leave eligibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the revised scheme on annual leave eligibility, the decision of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Government to exclude persons in the Education\r\n\r\nservice  seems to be based on the assumption  that\r\n\r\nall  persons  in  the Education  service  have  no\r\n\r\nannual  leave eligibility and that, as such,  they\r\n\r\ncannot opt for any reduction in their annual leave\r\n\r\neligibility  to  qualify for the  special  monthly\r\n\r\nallowance.  I  agree that such  an  assumption  is\r\n\r\naccurate  and  justifiable  in  respect   of   the\r\n\r\nmajority of the persons in the education service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, a minority of persons in the\r\n\r\nEducation   service  who  are  attached   to   the\r\n\r\nHeadquarters  in  the Ministry of Education.  Such\r\n\r\neducation officers have the same hours of work and\r\n\r\nsimilar   annual   leave  eligibility   as   their\r\n\r\ncolleagues  who are in the administrative  or  the\r\n\r\nexecutive  service. I am of the  view  that  these\r\n\r\neducation  officers  who are  accorded  an  annual\r\n\r\nleave    eligibility   by    reason    of    their\r\n\r\nadministrative  or  special  functions  should  be\r\n\r\npermitted  to opt for a special monthly  allowance\r\n\r\nin   consideration  for  a  reduced  annual  leave\r\n\r\neligibility under the scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While an objection may be raised against the\r\n\r\ninclusion  of such officers in the scheme  on  the\r\n\r\nground  that postings to the Headquarters  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry are not of a permanent duration and  that\r\n\r\nthe  officers  so posted may sooner  or  later  be\r\n\r\ntransferred back to teaching duties in schools, in\r\n\r\npractice the possibility of officers who have been\r\n\r\nassigned  administrative or special  duties  being\r\n\r\ntransferred  back  to  teaching  duties,  is  very\r\n\r\nremote. Even if I concede that such transfers  may\r\n\r\nand  do  take place, there is no reason  that  the\r\n\r\nofficers  so affected cannot be accorded  whatever\r\n\r\nspecial monthly allowance may be payable under the\r\n\r\nscheme for so long as they are required to perform\r\n\r\nadministrative or special functions and to observe\r\n\r\nthe   same   working  hours  and   other   working\r\n\r\nconditions  as  their  office  colleagues  in  the\r\n\r\nadministrative or executive service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now refer the Education Minister to the\r\n\r\nMinisterial   Statement  of  his  colleague,   the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister, on 16th February, 1973 in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  in  which he stated that a Merit  Increment\r\n\r\nScheme  for civil servants will be introduced  and\r\n\r\nthat the upper timescale will be revised\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom $l,700x50-1,850 to $l,700x100-2,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Education service structure, there are\r\n\r\nnine  salary scales, the highest of which  is  the\r\n\r\nscale of $1,700x50-1,850. A teacher who starts  at\r\n\r\nthe  bottom of the Education service will have  to\r\n\r\nsecure eight promotions before he can expect to be\r\n\r\nplaced on this scale. This scale is identical  and\r\n\r\ncorresponds  to the upper timescale.  It  is  only\r\n\r\nlogical that revision of the upper timescale  must\r\n\r\nresult in the revision of this scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of a Merit Increment Scheme by\r\n\r\nGovernment is to retain and to attract the best in\r\n\r\nthe civil service. I am sure Members in this House\r\n\r\nwill agree with me that the need to retain and  to\r\n\r\nattract the best in the Education service is  just\r\n\r\nas  crucial and vital as the need to retain and to\r\n\r\nattract  the  best  in the other  sectors  of  the\r\n\r\npublic service. Unless the Education Ministry  has\r\n\r\nstrong   objections  to  granting  increments   to\r\n\r\nteachers, I urge the Government to reconsider  its\r\n\r\ndecision and not to create a \"Cinderella\"  out  of\r\n\r\nthe Education service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  recently  a  case  of  errors   in\r\n\r\ntranslation was found among textbooks approved  by\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education. Moreover, some of these\r\n\r\nbooks  were  edited in a haphazard  manner.  As  a\r\n\r\nschool  teacher,  I would like to  speak  on  this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to deal with the textbooks.\r\n\r\nWe  all  know  that irrespective of  the  teaching\r\n\r\nmethod  adopted, the textbook remains one  of  the\r\n\r\nmain  tools  for teaching and imparting knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe   textbook  is  a  medium  for  teaching   and\r\n\r\nlearning.  If  a textbook is full of  errors,  the\r\n\r\nteacher  will  have to spend a  lot  of  his  time\r\n\r\nreading  other  books to supplement  the  material\r\n\r\ncontained  in the main textbook. And if  it  is  a\r\n\r\ntextbook edited in a haphazard manner, the teacher\r\n\r\nwill also have to spend a lot of his time teaching\r\n\r\nwithout the use of the textbook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent case, we found many translation\r\n\r\nerrors in a textbook. The teacher had to waste his\r\n\r\ntime correcting these errors. At the same time, it\r\n\r\ndemoralises  the  teacher  and  the  pupils.  Some\r\n\r\nconfusion  and misunderstanding must  result  from\r\n\r\nthese  translation errors. Sir, these errors  have\r\n\r\ncaused untold damage and irreparable harm. To  the\r\n\r\nyounger  generation,  the  textbook  is   a   very\r\n\r\nimportant  medium of knowledge and we  should  pay\r\n\r\nserious attention to this matter. On discovery  of\r\n\r\nthese   translation  errors,   the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation immediately announced that it would take\r\n\r\nimmediate measures to prevent a recurrence of such errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last few years we have spent large\r\n\r\nsums  of  money  on education. The expenditure  on\r\n\r\nEducation  is  second only to Defence.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwhy is it that the Ministry of Education has still\r\n\r\nnot  established  a committee for the  translation\r\n\r\nand  editing  of textbooks? As an educationist,  I\r\n\r\nhope that the Ministry of Education will look into\r\n\r\nthis  matter. Of course, what's done is done.  But\r\n\r\nit is better late than never. I think the Ministry\r\n\r\nshould   consider   setting  up   an   independent\r\n\r\ncommittee on textbooks, so that it will absorb the\r\n\r\npresent  employees and staff of the  Ministry  who\r\n\r\nare  responsible for the publication of textbooks.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people with specialist knowledge\r\n\r\nand  wide teaching experience can come forward  to\r\n\r\nassist  this  committee. This  committee  can,  in\r\n\r\naddition to editing the textbooks for the  primary\r\n\r\nand   secondary  schools,  also  review  all   the\r\n\r\ntextbooks  currently in use in  the  schools.  The\r\n\r\npurpose of the review is to ensure that there  are\r\n\r\nno  further  cases of errors and also to  make  an\r\n\r\nimprovement to the textbook, if necessary. We know\r\n\r\nthat  the  contents if textbooks will  affect  the\r\n\r\nspirit  and attitude of both the teacher  and  the\r\n\r\npupils,  and  the wrong textbooks  will  therefore\r\n\r\nlead to confusion and misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this juncture, I would also like to raise\r\n\r\na  few other points, one of which is in regard  to\r\n\r\nthe  administration of the Ministry of  Education.\r\n\r\nAlthough\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Ministry is in charge of education in the four\r\n\r\nlanguage   streams,   95   per   cent    of    the\r\n\r\ncorrespondence  from the Ministry  is  written  in\r\n\r\nEnglish.   I  am  not  raising  the  question   of\r\n\r\nlanguage. The Government has laid down the  policy\r\n\r\nof  multi-lingualism. Why is it that the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof Education, which has so many talented officers,\r\n\r\ncannot translate official correspondence into  the\r\n\r\nother  official  languages?  Of  course,  if   the\r\n\r\ncorrespondence is addressed to English schools  it\r\n\r\nis  quite  logical  and  understandable.  But  the\r\n\r\nquestion  is this. When correspondence in  English\r\n\r\nis  addressed to schools which do not use  English\r\n\r\nas  the medium of instruction, then time is wasted\r\n\r\nby  the  school  staff  in  understanding  it  and\r\n\r\ngetting it translated. I trust, Sir, that from now\r\n\r\non  the Ministry will be able to use all the  four\r\n\r\nofficial languages in its correspondence  and  its\r\n\r\ncirculars  to  all  schools in the  four  language\r\n\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the debate on the President's\r\n\r\nAddress, I had spoken about the retirement age  of\r\n\r\nteachers  in  Government-aided  schools.  At  that\r\n\r\ntime,  perhaps the Minister for Education was  not\r\n\r\npresent.  But up to now, I have still not received\r\n\r\nany reply. Now that the Minister is present, I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  whether he has looked up  the  relevant\r\n\r\ncopy of the Hansard on this matter so that he  can\r\n\r\ngive me a reply. If he has not, may I be permitted\r\n\r\nto  repeat what I said on that occasion, i.e, that\r\n\r\nall  Government-aided school  teachers  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  the opportunity to retire at the age of  60\r\n\r\nyears.  I  hope the Minister will now  give  me  a\r\n\r\nreply one way or the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another point is in respect of\r\n\r\nschools  in the rural areas. Some of them  are  so\r\n\r\nsmall  that they do not even have a school  clerk.\r\n\r\nSometimes  the principal himself has to teach  and\r\n\r\nto  do the administrative and clerical work. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  understand why the Ministry cannot provide  a\r\n\r\nclerk for a small rural school, which has the same\r\n\r\namount   of  administrative  work  as  the  larger\r\n\r\nschools. Up to now I have not received any  reply.\r\n\r\nI hope the Minister will be able to give me a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreply.  I also hope that by tomorrow these schools will be provided with clerks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to touch on the question of\r\n\r\nmedical  benefits for teachers in Government-aided\r\n\r\nschools.  By doing so, I am not saying  that  they\r\n\r\nare not contented. We are most grateful indeed  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  for  giving  us  the  same  medical\r\n\r\nbenefits as the Government teachers. But there  is\r\n\r\nstill some difference to a certain extent. In  the\r\n\r\ncase   of   Government   teachers,   after   their\r\n\r\nretirement,  they will continue to  enjoy  medical\r\n\r\nbenefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the teachers in Government-aided schools do\r\n\r\nnot   qualify  for  free  medical  benefits  after\r\n\r\nretirement.   What   is  the   reason   for   this\r\n\r\ndifference?  Both  are doing  the  same  work  and\r\n\r\nliving  in  the same country. This is not  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  teachers  in  aided  schools  are   not\r\n\r\ncontented  with what have been accorded  to  them.\r\n\r\nWhile a young man, he is strong and healthy and is\r\n\r\nnot  likely to suffer from any illness. It is only\r\n\r\non  occasions  that he might have  minor  ailments\r\n\r\nlike  a  cold or flu. But when he is old,  he  may\r\n\r\nhave health problems. Many Government-aided school\r\n\r\nteachers  suffer from ill-health after retirement.\r\n\r\nThe  older they are, the more troubles they  have.\r\n\r\nThese  old people, who have devoted 20 to 30 years\r\n\r\nof  their  lives in the Education service  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  suffer  a poor fate after  retirement.  I\r\n\r\nhope    that    the   Minister   concerned    will\r\n\r\nsympathetically consider the plight of the  aided-school teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay, I have allowed you more\r\n\r\nthan 10 minutes.

Those\r\n\r\nteachers who have reached the age of 40 years  and\r\n\r\n50  years or more have to report their ages to the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education. It is as if the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  is  afraid that they will  stay  on  to\r\n\r\nteach for one day more than is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many applications from the\r\n\r\nretired  teachers for extension of  service.  Some\r\n\r\napplications have been granted on a three-month or\r\n\r\nsix-month basis, and only a very fortunate few are\r\n\r\ngranted  an  extension of one year. Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nsome  teachers are only allowed to get 80 per cent\r\n\r\nof  their  last drawn pay when they are  so-called\r\n\r\n\"re-employed\".  I think this is a bit  ridiculous.\r\n\r\nSince  we  allow  these teachers to  extend  their\r\n\r\nservices,  that  means we consider their  services\r\n\r\nuseful, valid and effective. Since they are useful\r\n\r\nand effective teachers, why should their salary be\r\n\r\nreduced by 20 per cent? To an old teacher who  has\r\n\r\ndedicated his whole life to education, this  is  a\r\n\r\ngreat  blow to him morally. Unlike people in other\r\n\r\nprofessions,  teachers  start  their  professional\r\n\r\nwork  at  a late age because of their professional\r\n\r\ntraining. These teachers are brain workers. But if\r\n\r\nthey  are forced to retire at the age of 50 which,\r\n\r\naccording  to  experts, is the maturity  age,  and\r\n\r\nthis  also is the important stage of the teachers'\r\n\r\ncareer, then this will not only be a great loss to\r\n\r\nthe  teachers themselves but also a  loss  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  It  is  my hope that the  Minister  will\r\n\r\nsympathetically  consider  the  applications  from\r\n\r\nteachers for extension of service, and that on re-employment their salaries should not be reduced by 20 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has brought up the\r\n\r\nquestion of textbooks, and I would like to add  my\r\n\r\nviews to what he has said. There has been quite  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  criticisms  against  textbooks  published\r\n\r\nlocally.  While  we here are not concerned  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether this is the result of some overt or covert\r\n\r\nrivalry  between publishers in the private sector,\r\n\r\nsuch criticisms have brought into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  open the defect in the present review  system\r\n\r\nof   textbooks.  Sir,  textbooks  are  not  to  be\r\n\r\nregarded  as  bibles. However, there is  no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat they form the basis of teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if there are any defects in them,  they\r\n\r\nwill be very unreliable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully endorse that there should be freedom of\r\n\r\npublication,  because  if  there  is  freedom   of\r\n\r\npublication  there  will be  competition,  and  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  competition there will be  improvement.\r\n\r\nBut  this should not be taken haphazardly or  done\r\n\r\nin  a  very irresponsible manner, particularly  in\r\n\r\nregard  to textbooks for schools. I would like  to\r\n\r\ntake  this  opportunity therefore to propose  that\r\n\r\nhenceforth book publishers or book-shops should be\r\n\r\nasked  to  set  up a textbook editorial  committee\r\n\r\nwith  such members to be approved by the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof   Education.  In  this  way,  we  can   prevent\r\n\r\npublishers  or bookshops from getting anyone  they\r\n\r\nchoose within a short time. Next, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation   should  also  set   up   a   committee\r\n\r\nconsisting of experts in their own field, such  as\r\n\r\nspecialist inspectors and representatives from the\r\n\r\nvarious teachers' associations. We cannot continue\r\n\r\nwith  the  present system of giving  $50  to  each\r\n\r\ntextbook  reviewer  and  expect  good  result.  In\r\n\r\nfairness, we should also ensure that adequate time\r\n\r\nis given to the compilers or editors of textbooks.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot  expect these people  to  produce  good\r\n\r\ntextbooks within six months of the publication  of\r\n\r\nthe   syllabuses,  because  the   publication   of\r\n\r\ntextbooks involves not only editing, printing, but\r\n\r\nalso  research.  So  we cannot  rush  out  a  good\r\n\r\ntextbook in any case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally I would like to suggest to the Minister\r\n\r\nthat prices of textbooks should be rationalised so\r\n\r\nthat  there  would  be  no undue  profiteering  by\r\n\r\npublishers and bookshops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nabolition  of  history and geography from  Primary\r\n\r\nVII  exanimations has been a very wise move on the\r\n\r\npart  of this Ministry. The increase in the number\r\n\r\nof  passes in Primary VI is a clear indication  of\r\n\r\nthe wisdom of this move. As a result of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  large  number  of passes, we  have  a  unique\r\n\r\nsystem  introduced in secondary schools.  We  have\r\n\r\nsuch a thing as \"floating\" classes. Literally they\r\n\r\nare  floating,  for  the  students  have  no  firm\r\n\r\nclassroom which they can claim as their  own,  and\r\n\r\nas  a  result  we have a class of pupils  who  are\r\n\r\nwithout a permanent place in the school. I  wonder\r\n\r\nhow long these \"floating\" classes will go on. What\r\n\r\nwe  need  urgently are extensions  to  accommodate\r\n\r\nmore classes, and this is not an impossible task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I brought the attention of the\r\n\r\nMinister  to the sad state of affairs of Secondary\r\n\r\nI and II students. Not only have they got to learn\r\n\r\n11  compulsory examination subjects, but they also\r\n\r\nhave  to  go for workshop practices twice  weekly,\r\n\r\nand  for extra-curricular activities two or  three\r\n\r\ntimes  a week. How on earth can these young  minds\r\n\r\ncope with this enormous work-load?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the removal of history and geography from\r\n\r\nPrimary  VI  examinations  has  concretely  proved\r\n\r\nbetter  results,  would it not  also  be  wise  to\r\n\r\nremove history and geography from examinations  in\r\n\r\nSecondary I and II? This will lighten their load a\r\n\r\ngreat deal, and probably we may eventually be able\r\n\r\nto  produce better results in Secondary IV and HSC\r\n\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Education Ministry's policy regarding\r\n\r\ntransfers?  I  thought the  policy  is  to  reduce\r\n\r\ntransfers  to  the  minimum.  Yet  we  still  find\r\n\r\nteachers  being transferred within 24  hours.  How\r\n\r\ncan teachers in Government schools be expected  to\r\n\r\nbe fully loyal to the school, if they realise that\r\n\r\nthey  can  be  transferred within 24 hours  merely\r\n\r\nupon  a  telephone  call?  Is  this  the  way  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  runs  its  establishment?  Has   it   no\r\n\r\nconsideration  for  the  teachers?  Or  have   the\r\n\r\nofficers working in air-conditioned comfort become\r\n\r\nso  inhumane,  as  to think of  teachers  as  mere\r\n\r\ndigits in their files? I urge the Minister to give\r\n\r\nmore  valued  consideration  to  the  transfer  of\r\n\r\nteachers against their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwishes,  and to consider the human aspect  of  the\r\n\r\naction  more  than just filling in the  gap  in  a\r\n\r\nstaffing list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are teachers made to do two compulsory extra-curricular activities, one of which must be a\r\n\r\nsports  activity? Why not confine it to  one,  but\r\n\r\nlet  the  number  of  hours  remain  unchanged?  A\r\n\r\nteacher  who  specialises  in  a  particular  game\r\n\r\ncannot  give his full attention if half his extra-curricular  activities' time is taken  by  another\r\n\r\nactivity  in which he has no interest.  We  should\r\n\r\nencourage  specialisation  in  activities,  rather\r\n\r\nthan  discourage it, especially in  the  secondary\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently there was a promotion exercise for the\r\n\r\nteachers  and others connected with the  Education\r\n\r\nservice.  Though this exercise was held  after  an\r\n\r\nunusual  delay, the promoting body has not decided\r\n\r\non  the  persons to be promoted. There has been  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  talk about the exercise in the newspapers\r\n\r\nas well as in public. Can the Minister explain why\r\n\r\nsuch  a situation had arisen? It appears that most\r\n\r\nof  the  principals, being human  and  some  being\r\n\r\ninhuman,  may  have  made gross  mistakes  in  the\r\n\r\nassessment of their teachers. It is my  view  that\r\n\r\nsome  solution  must be found, otherwise  we  will\r\n\r\nhave a very unhappy lot of teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, with your permission can I speak  on\r\n\r\namendment (2)* now?\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* The amendment, standing in the name of Mr Teong  Eng Siong, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1002.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right, Mr Teong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have heard\r\n\r\nseveral  comments  from  my  colleagues.   So   in\r\n\r\nfairness  to  the Ministry of Education,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  say something. It cannot be denied  that\r\n\r\nover  the  past few years there has been  a  great\r\n\r\nachievement  in  education in Singapore.  The  sum\r\n\r\nallotted to the Ministry of Education for  1973-74\r\n\r\ncomes to about $300 million, both for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Main and the Development Estimates. This is to\r\n\r\nensure  that there is an all-round development  in\r\n\r\nthe  four  language streams and that  all  school-going  children will have good teaching and proper education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilingual education is a very realistic and\r\n\r\npractical  approach to a multi-lingual society  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This  is a system  which  gives  equal\r\n\r\ntreatment to the various language streams. What is\r\n\r\nmore  important  is  that under  this  system  our\r\n\r\nstudents  will  become good and  rugged  citizens.\r\n\r\nThese  are the main objectives of education  which\r\n\r\ncannot   be  denied,  but  the  problem   is   the\r\n\r\nadministrative   officers  in  the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation  headquarters and the administration  in\r\n\r\nthe  schools.  Are  they capable  of  implementing\r\n\r\nthese objectives effectively? I have received some\r\n\r\ncomplaints from both teachers and parents on  this\r\n\r\nmatter.  These  complaints and criticisms  can  be\r\n\r\nclassified into four categories:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Bilingualism, in principle, is not wrong but\r\n\r\nin  practice, more often than not we  come  across\r\n\r\ndifficulties in its implementation. This is due to\r\n\r\nthe lack of teachers. As a result of this shortage\r\n\r\nof  qualified teachers, it is difficult  to  raise\r\n\r\nthe  standard  of  bilingualism, particularly  the\r\n\r\nsecond  language. Students in the  Chinese  stream\r\n\r\nfind  it  difficult  to  follow  the  teaching  of\r\n\r\nscience   and   mathematics,  for  which   English\r\n\r\ntextbooks are used. That is one of the reasons why\r\n\r\nbilingualism cannot be effectively implemented. So\r\n\r\nI  would  like the Minister for Education to  look\r\n\r\ninto   this  problem  of  sufficiency  of   second\r\n\r\nlanguage teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The shortage of physical education teachers.\r\n\r\nWe  are concentrating our efforts and attention on\r\n\r\nextramural activities in the schools, but in  many\r\n\r\ncases  there  is  a  shortage of  PE  teachers  in\r\n\r\nschools.  This  shortage  affects  the  extramural\r\n\r\nactivities,  and it also means that  teachers  who\r\n\r\nare  not  interested  or not trained  in  physical\r\n\r\neducation are dragged in to be involved  in  extra\r\n\r\nphysical  education activities. As a  result,  the\r\n\r\nstandard of physical education does not reach  the\r\n\r\nlevel expected. So I would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike  the Minister to consider the possibility  of\r\n\r\nopening  holiday-classes for teachers in  physical\r\n\r\neducation,  both  in terms of technique,  practice\r\n\r\nand  theory.  This  may  go  a  long  way  towards\r\n\r\nalleviating the shortage of PE teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The shortage of full-time teachers. I said\r\n\r\njust  now  that  there  is a  shortage  of  second\r\n\r\nlanguage teachers and PE teachers. There is also a\r\n\r\nshortage  of full-time teachers. What has happened\r\n\r\nhere?  According to people involved in  education,\r\n\r\nthere is still a good number of relief teachers in\r\n\r\nour  schools.  Some of these relief teachers  have\r\n\r\nbeen  teaching  for more than 10 years,  but  they\r\n\r\nstill   remain  relief  teachers.  They  are   not\r\n\r\npromoted to the status of full-time teachers. As a\r\n\r\nresult  of this, the relief teachers are not  able\r\n\r\nto  concentrate and dedicate themselves  to  their\r\n\r\nwork.  They just adopt the attitude of `work today\r\n\r\nfor life today', because they are relief teachers.\r\n\r\nI  think  the  senior assistants  in  the  various\r\n\r\nschools understand this problem best because  they\r\n\r\nhave to deal with these relief teachers. There  is\r\n\r\nthe Teachers' Training College. Why cannot we make\r\n\r\nuse  of  the Teachers' Training College to produce\r\n\r\nmore  qualified  teachers? The  next  question  is\r\n\r\nthis.  Since a relief teacher is allowed to  teach\r\n\r\nfor  10  years  or  more, cannot consideration  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  convert  them into  ordinary  full-time\r\n\r\nteachers,  so that they will be able  to  dedicate\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  teaching  without  worrying  about\r\n\r\ntheir tenure of office?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Sir, we come to the question of teacher-pupil\r\n\r\nrelationship. There seems to be a barrier  between\r\n\r\nteachers  and  students  in  Singapore.  That   is\r\n\r\nprobably because students and teachers spend  only\r\n\r\nhalf  a  day  together in schools. There  is  very\r\n\r\nlittle  time for them to mix around in a  half-day\r\n\r\nsession.  Steps should be taken to promote  better\r\n\r\nrelationship  among teachers, pupils and  parents,\r\n\r\nparticularly at the present juncture when  we  are\r\n\r\nfaced  with  the  problem of some students  taking\r\n\r\ndrugs. We cannot blame the schools alone for this,\r\n\r\nbecause there is just not enough\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime for students and teachers to get together. So\r\n\r\nthe  society and the Ministry of Education  should\r\n\r\npartly shoulder the blame. I believe that if there\r\n\r\nis closer and better relationship between teachers\r\n\r\nand students, a lot of problems can be solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Sir, we come to the number of pupils for each\r\n\r\nclass.  In my view, for a teacher to be in  charge\r\n\r\nof  40 pupils per class is too great a task. Since\r\n\r\nthere  is  an improvement in our economy,  perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education can consider recruiting\r\n\r\nmore  teachers  in order to reduce the  number  of\r\n\r\nstudents  per  class.  I  am  sure  many   of   my\r\n\r\ncolleagues here in this House will support  me  on\r\n\r\nthis.  With a reduced number of pupils per  class,\r\n\r\nthe  teacher will be able to teach better and give\r\n\r\nmore  individual attention to the students. I hope\r\n\r\nthe  Minister will consider this, and ask for more\r\n\r\nfunds to be allocated for the next financial  year\r\n\r\nto recruit more teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) We come to the promotion of teachers. This\r\n\r\nhas  been widely publicised recently, and it gives\r\n\r\nencouragement  to  the  teachers.  The   promotion\r\n\r\nprospects  for  teachers will be an incentive  for\r\n\r\nthem  to work harder and with stronger dedication.\r\n\r\nBut there has been also dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, your 10 minutes are up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I only need 10 seconds more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Lastly, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like the Minister to consider setting up  an\r\n\r\nHSC  class  for  Sembawang High School  or  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency. There are three secondary schools in\r\n\r\nmy  constituency, but there is not a single school\r\n\r\nrunning HSC classes. So my constituents will  have\r\n\r\nto  go  out  of  my  constituency  to  attend  HSC\r\n\r\nclasses.  I think the setting up of at  least  one\r\n\r\nHSC  class  is  justified  because  there  are  at\r\n\r\npresent    three   secondary   schools    in    my constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, the Minister has not replied to whatever points you have raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir, since the Members for Anson\r\n\r\nand  Sembawang  have touched on  the  question  of\r\n\r\npromotion, may I be permitted to express my  views\r\n\r\non this point?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, carry on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of education policies and  the\r\n\r\nachievement  of its objectives depend  to  a  very\r\n\r\ngreat extent on the efforts of teachers. To ensure\r\n\r\nthat  there  is no brain drain from the  Education\r\n\r\nservice  to  the  private sector,  the  Government\r\n\r\ndecided   to  hold  negotiations  with   teachers'\r\n\r\norganisations  two years ago on the  restructuring\r\n\r\nof  salary scales and improvement of conditions of\r\n\r\nservice.  As  a  result of such  negotiations,  an\r\n\r\nagreement  was  reached. This agreement,  however,\r\n\r\ndoes  not  give, and will not give,  teachers  any\r\n\r\nimmediate benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the terms of the agreement was the\r\n\r\npromotion prospects for teachers. This, of course,\r\n\r\nis  a  source of encouragement for teachers.  But,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  recent  promotion  exercise,  in  which\r\n\r\ninterviews have been held, has caused a lot of new\r\n\r\nproblems. This has also exposed the defects of the\r\n\r\npresent  promotion system. The basis for promotion\r\n\r\nis  that  a teacher, in addition to being good  in\r\n\r\nteaching, should also be good in other activities,\r\n\r\nsuch  as extracurricular activities in school  and\r\n\r\ncommunity  service outside the school.  He  should\r\n\r\nset  a  good example in extracurricular activities\r\n\r\nand  community service. In other words, a  teacher\r\n\r\ndoes not belong to the school alone. He belongs to\r\n\r\nthe society and the country. He should not only be\r\n\r\na  teacher  of  pupils but, in time  of  need,  he\r\n\r\nshould  be  able to make his contribution  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry  and  the society. So a good  teacher,  by\r\n\r\nthis  definition,  would be  an  activist,  and  a\r\n\r\ncreative  educator  of  man.  But  what  are   the\r\n\r\nprospects of promotion? Under the present  system,\r\n\r\nall  teachers with five years' teaching experience\r\n\r\nare allowed to put in their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplications. Of course, this is quite democratic.\r\n\r\nBut anomalies have arisen out of this system. As a\r\n\r\nresult   of   such  anomalies,  there   has   been\r\n\r\nwidespread dissatisfaction, which is caused by the\r\n\r\nfact  that  applications must  be  accompanied  by\r\n\r\nconfidential  reports put up  by  the  principals.\r\n\r\nThese  reports  become  the  prerequisite  for  an\r\n\r\ninterview for promotions, and undue importance has\r\n\r\nbeen given to such confidential reports. And those\r\n\r\nteachers,  who  were  not  even  shortlisted   for\r\n\r\ninterviews,  have  blamed the principals  for  not\r\n\r\nputting up proper reports. As a result, there  has\r\n\r\nbeen some misunderstanding and dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that some senior assistants\r\n\r\nhave   not   been  selected  or  shortlisted   for\r\n\r\ninterviews. On the contrary, some junior  teachers\r\n\r\nhave  been  shortlisted.  This  is  a  source   of\r\n\r\nembarrassment  to  the senior assistants.  In  the\r\n\r\nearlier  days,  senior assistants  were  appointed\r\n\r\nbecause of their outstanding performance. But  now\r\n\r\nthey  are  not even given a chance to  go  for  an\r\n\r\ninterview in the promotion exercise. Sir, although\r\n\r\nit is a good policy to promote teachers or to give\r\n\r\nthem  opportunities for promotion,  teachers  have\r\n\r\nbeen demoralised because of the present system  of\r\n\r\npromotion. I hope the Minister concerned will look\r\n\r\ninto the matter, and remedy the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lee, I will extend the\r\n\r\nguillotine time for you because there are so  many\r\n\r\nquestions to be answered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Thank you, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I take the question of the\r\n\r\npromotion exercise first? This was already  raised\r\n\r\nby  the  Member  for Jurong in the debate  on  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  policy of this Government,  and  he  is\r\n\r\nbringing  it  up  again  today.  This  topic   has\r\n\r\nattracted  a lot of interest. There is  a  lot  of\r\n\r\npublicity given by the press and a large number of\r\n\r\nanonymous letters have been received. I am  afraid\r\n\r\nthe most important consideration of a good teacher\r\n\r\nis  his ability to teach, and short-listing has to\r\n\r\ndepend on that. His ECA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand community service activities, however, will be\r\n\r\ntaken  into consideration in the actual  promotion\r\n\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one common misconception about the mechanics\r\n\r\nof  the  present promotion exercise  is  that  the\r\n\r\nshortlisting of candidates was done by a computer,\r\n\r\nthe  implication being that the assessment of  the\r\n\r\ncandidate  was  left  to a  machine.  This,  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid, is being alleged by the Member for  Jurong\r\n\r\nduring the debate on the financial policy. This is\r\n\r\nnot  so.  Assessment in every case was made  by  a\r\n\r\nreporting officer and checked by a counter-signing\r\n\r\nofficer  who could, if he thought fit, change  the\r\n\r\ngrading given by the reporting officer. Apart from\r\n\r\nthe confidential report prepared for the promotion\r\n\r\nexercise,  the confidential reports  for  the  two\r\n\r\nprevious  years are also taken into consideration,\r\n\r\nmaking  three  confidential reports  in  all.  The\r\n\r\ncomputer part of the exercise was merely  to  work\r\n\r\nout  the  final grading awarded, and to  list  the\r\n\r\ncandidates  in order of merit for the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nshort-listing.  In other words, the  computer  did\r\n\r\nnot pass judgment on anyone. It merely performed a\r\n\r\nmechanical  task  which would have  taken  a  much\r\n\r\nlonger time if it was carried out manually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, admittedly human judgment is not infallible.\r\n\r\nHowever,  every  effort has been  made  to  ensure\r\n\r\nuniformity and objectivity in assessing the  merit\r\n\r\nof  candidates by comparing them with their peers.\r\n\r\nFor  this purpose, a new confidential report  form\r\n\r\nwas  devised  with  the expert assistance  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission, the Management Services\r\n\r\nUnit  of the Ministry of Finance, and the Research\r\n\r\nUnit   of  this  Ministry.  Detailed  notes   were\r\n\r\nprepared  and  issued  to all reporting  officers,\r\n\r\nexplaining  the various qualities  expected  of  a\r\n\r\ncandidate  and the system of grading to  be  used.\r\n\r\nBoth the confidential report form and the notes to\r\n\r\nthe  reporting officers were subjected to  various\r\n\r\ntests  and amended several times before they  were\r\n\r\nfinalised. The Member for Jurong may be pleased to\r\n\r\nknow that the whole process of developing this new\r\n\r\nconfidential report took us more than six months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another common complaint is that some\r\n\r\nteachers  who were reported on by their principals\r\n\r\nwere  shortlisted  for the interview  whereas  the\r\n\r\nprincipals  themselves were not  shortlisted.  The\r\n\r\nargument  behind this criticism seems to  be  that\r\n\r\nthose  who  are good enough to report  on  someone\r\n\r\nelse,  must themselves be better than the officers\r\n\r\nthey  are  reporting on, and therefore  should  be\r\n\r\nshortlisted.  If we pursue this, argument  to  its\r\n\r\nlogical  conclusion,  then every  teacher,  except\r\n\r\nthose  at  the  lowest grade, that  is,  Education\r\n\r\nOfficers   in  Group  III,  would   have   to   be\r\n\r\nshortlisted.  I  am  afraid  this   is   not   the\r\n\r\nintention.  The restructured scheme  is  aimed  to\r\n\r\nprovide  greater promotion prospects for  everyone\r\n\r\nin  the  teaching service. The criticisms  clearly\r\n\r\nindicate  that  the  complainants  do  not   fully\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  basic philosophy  underlying  the\r\n\r\nrestructured Education service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One fundamental feature of this new restructured\r\n\r\nscheme is that promotion is no longer awarded to a\r\n\r\npost  but  to  a grade, so that a teacher  can  be\r\n\r\npromoted  and  still  remain a  teacher.  It  also\r\n\r\nfollows  that a teacher may be promoted whereas  a\r\n\r\nprincipal may not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of rewarding an officer according\r\n\r\nto   his  own  merit  and  not  according  to  the\r\n\r\nfunctions  he performs is a rather new concept  in\r\n\r\nthe   public  service.  This  feature  was   fully\r\n\r\npublicised  in  October 1971  when  agreement  was\r\n\r\nfinally  reached  after  a  year  of  negotiations\r\n\r\nbetween   the  Ministry  of  Education   and   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Teachers'  Unions.  At  that  time   no\r\n\r\ncriticism   was  levelled  against   either   this\r\n\r\nprinciple  or the new Education service structure.\r\n\r\nFor one and a half years not a single criticism or\r\n\r\ncomment   has  been  received  by  the   Education\r\n\r\nMinistry, or by the Singapore Teachers' Unions for\r\n\r\nthat matter, on the principle underlying this  new\r\n\r\nstructure.  It is only now when the  teachers  are\r\n\r\nbeing called up for interview that criticisms have\r\n\r\nemerged, including the anonymous letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in any promotion exercise, it is inevitable\r\n\r\nthat those who are unsuccessful\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be  disappointed.  In  this  particular\r\n\r\npromotion exercise, being the first one under  the\r\n\r\nnew structure based on the new principle, it is to\r\n\r\nbe  expected that even more than the usual  number\r\n\r\nof   disgruntled  candidates  will   voice   their\r\n\r\nmisgivings.  I  am not saying that the  system  is\r\n\r\nperfect. My Ministry will continue to improve  the\r\n\r\nprocedure,  and  any constructive suggestions  for\r\n\r\nfuture  promotion exercise will be most  welcomed.\r\n\r\nBut  to  those who are disappointed in the current\r\n\r\nexercise,   let  me  assure  them  that  promotion\r\n\r\nexercises will be carried out regularly in  future\r\n\r\nas  spelt  out in the agreement with the Singapore\r\n\r\nTeachers'  Unions. Let me also point out  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  past  an average of 30 officers were promoted\r\n\r\nevery  year.  It is to be expected  that  in  this\r\n\r\ncurrent promotion exercise, the opportunities  for\r\n\r\npromotion will increase more than ten-fold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to correct the statement\r\n\r\nmade  by  the Member for Jurong during the  debate\r\n\r\nlast  week,  and  that  is, there  was  a  massive\r\n\r\nresignation  of  teachers  as  a  result  of  this\r\n\r\npromotion  exercise. I am afraid that he  has  got\r\n\r\nhis   facts  wrong.  Only  32  resignations   were\r\n\r\nreceived after the teachers had been called up for\r\n\r\ninterview.  Although this figure is slightly  more\r\n\r\nthan that for the corresponding period in 1971 and\r\n\r\n1972,  which  is  28  and 21 respectively,  it  is\r\n\r\nrelevant  to note that more than half of them  are\r\n\r\nstill  under  probation. Therefore, the  promotion\r\n\r\nexercise has nothing to do with their resignation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another popular issue under\r\n\r\ndiscussion  currently is the review of  textbooks.\r\n\r\nArising   from  the  recent  incident   concerning\r\n\r\ncertain  history  textbooks, which  has  generated\r\n\r\nconsiderable interest, perhaps it is relevant  for\r\n\r\nme  to  explain  how the machinery works.  When  a\r\n\r\npublisher wishes to have his textbook accepted  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education for use in the schools,\r\n\r\nhe  has  to  submit  a draft to the  Ministry  for\r\n\r\nreview. The Ministry will then appoint a panel  of\r\n\r\nthree  reviewers.  The reviewers  are  experienced\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the teaching service, either  in  the\r\n\r\nschools or in the institutions of higher learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  will  have to keep their identity  secret  for\r\n\r\nfear  that  they  may be unduly  influenced.  This\r\n\r\nsystem  of  review was introduced in  August  1970\r\n\r\nafter  a series of negotiations with the Singapore\r\n\r\nEducational  Publication Council. In the  past  we\r\n\r\nhad our Specialist Inspectors to do the reviewing.\r\n\r\nBut  unfortunately, this system did not work  very\r\n\r\nwell   because  there  were  lots  of  allegations\r\n\r\nagainst  certain  Specialist Inspectors  who  were\r\n\r\nbook-writers themselves. We are now working out  a\r\n\r\nmore   stringent  system  for  the  reviewing   of\r\n\r\ntextbooks.  The Member can rest assured  that  the\r\n\r\nincident  which  came to light recently  will  not\r\n\r\noccur  again. The Ministry will welcome any  views\r\n\r\nand suggestions from the teachers on the textbooks\r\n\r\nwhich they use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar raised a number of\r\n\r\nquestions  on  the  retirement  of  teachers,   in\r\n\r\nparticular, the difference in retirement  ages  of\r\n\r\n55  and  60 years. The retirement age for teachers\r\n\r\nand  all other civil servants is governed  by  the\r\n\r\nPensions   Ordinance,  1956,  under  which   those\r\n\r\nofficers  who were employed before 1st July,  1956\r\n\r\nwould  retire  at  55  years  of  age,  and  those\r\n\r\nemployed after that date would retire at 60  years\r\n\r\nof  age.  This scheme is applicable to the  entire\r\n\r\npublic  service, and not to the Education  service\r\n\r\nalone. I am afraid we cannot make an exception  to\r\n\r\nthe teaching service. However, it is the policy of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  to  encourage  good  and  dedicated\r\n\r\nteachers  to  remain in the teaching service,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  as  is  the practice in  the  past,  an\r\n\r\nextension  of service is generally given  to  such\r\n\r\nteachers.  Other  teachers whose  performance  has\r\n\r\nbeen   found   to  be  satisfactory  are   usually\r\n\r\nreemployed. The Member for Jurong will be  pleased\r\n\r\nto  note  that, with immediate effect, in all  new\r\n\r\ncases  of  re-employment they will be given  their\r\n\r\nfull  salary. Those who have been paid four-fifths\r\n\r\nof  their last drawn salary will have their  cases\r\n\r\nreviewed at the end of their re-employment  period\r\n\r\nand, if they are found suitable, they will be paid\r\n\r\ntheir full salary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar also raised the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  medical  benefits  for  aided-school\r\n\r\nteachers  on  retirement. Again, I am  afraid  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Paya  Lebar thinks that  aided-school\r\n\r\nteachers  are the only category of public officers\r\n\r\nwho  are  not  on Government pensionable  service.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not  so.  There are  thousands  of  such\r\n\r\nofficers employed by the various statutory bodies,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the Public Utilities Board, the Port  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   Authority   and   the   Housing    and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board. These officers  and  those  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  service who contribute to the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund are not entitled to medical benefit\r\n\r\nafter their retirement. This ruling is applied  to\r\n\r\nall  officers in this category, and  not  just  to\r\n\r\nschool  teachers alone. The Member for Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\ncan  rest  assured  that retired school  teachers,\r\n\r\nlike all the others, are entitled to the excellent\r\n\r\nmedical service available to our citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also raised the question of correspondence\r\n\r\nbetween the Education Ministry and the school.  He\r\n\r\nalleged  that  95  per cent of the  circulars  and\r\n\r\ncorrespondence between the Education Ministry  and\r\n\r\nthe  schools are written in English. Again,  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid   that   he  has  got  his   facts   wrong.\r\n\r\nPractically  all  circulars from the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation   are  written  in  the  four   official\r\n\r\nlanguages. Most of the correspondence are  in  the\r\n\r\nappropriate language of the school concerned.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Paya Lebar will agree with me that  the\r\n\r\nschool  is perhaps the most appropriate  place  to\r\n\r\npractise  and  implement our bilingual  policy.  I\r\n\r\nthink both principals and teachers must be able to\r\n\r\ncommand  a  second language. Word  must  now  have\r\n\r\nfiltered  through  that in  the  recent  promotion\r\n\r\nexercise considerable weight was given even  to  a\r\n\r\nteacher's command of a second language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another question raised on school\r\n\r\nclerks  for  the small rural school with  a  small\r\n\r\nenrolment. Let me assure the Member for Paya Lebar\r\n\r\nthat  we are, in fact, actively looking into  this\r\n\r\nmatter. He is aware that a number of large  aided-schools  have more than their quota of clerks.  We\r\n\r\nare looking into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  feasibility of transferring the excess clerks\r\n\r\nfrom  these  schools to the smaller rural  schools\r\n\r\nwhich do not have a clerk at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson raised a number of\r\n\r\ninteresting  points, especially on  curriculum.  I\r\n\r\nagree with him that at the moment the students are\r\n\r\noverloaded.  In fact, it is the Ministry's  policy\r\n\r\nto avoid overworking the students. But in order to\r\n\r\nprovide  an all-round education within the present\r\n\r\nconstraint of curriculum time, there is  only  one\r\n\r\nway  out,  and  that  is, the integrated  teaching\r\n\r\napproach. We are currently working on this system.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  a  few  similar  subjects  will  be\r\n\r\nintegrated into one, such as physics and chemistry\r\n\r\nwill be integrated into physical science; history,\r\n\r\ngeography  and  civics  will  be  integrated  into\r\n\r\nsocial  study. At the present moment there  is  an\r\n\r\nexperiment  to integrate English, mathematics  and\r\n\r\nscience  into  a  single subject  in  the  primary\r\n\r\nschools.  This may partly answer the query  raised\r\n\r\nby  the Member for Sembawang. If he has the  time,\r\n\r\nhe  is  most welcomed to visit this school to  see\r\n\r\nhow the system works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also raised a number of\r\n\r\nquestions  on  extra-curricular  activities.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education attaches great importance to\r\n\r\nECA.  Pupils generally turn up once a week outside\r\n\r\nschool hours for ECA, and three hours for workshop\r\n\r\npractice.  Only those who have been nominated  for\r\n\r\nparticipation in special events, such as the Youth\r\n\r\nFestival, the National Day Parade, etc., are asked\r\n\r\nto  go  for practice occasionally. The Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  is  wrong  when  he  said  that  it  is   a\r\n\r\ncompulsory requirement for teachers to do two ECA,\r\n\r\nalthough  I am aware that some of them  are  doing\r\n\r\nso.  But  it is not compulsory. The allocation  of\r\n\r\nECA  responsibilities to teachers is made  by  the\r\n\r\nprincipals   in  consultation  with   the   senior\r\n\r\nassistant  and  the teachers concerned,  based  on\r\n\r\ntheir  attitude and interest, so that  they  could\r\n\r\nspecialise in a particular activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also passed some very interesting remarks on\r\n\r\n\"floating\"  classes.  Sir,  the  introduction   of\r\n\r\n\"floating\" classes in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary   this  year  was  necessitated   by   the\r\n\r\nunexpectedly large number of students  who  passed\r\n\r\nthe  Primary School Leaving Examination last year.\r\n\r\nI  have to disappoint him by saying that this  has\r\n\r\nno  direct relevance to the withdrawal of  history\r\n\r\nand  geography from the examination. There are  92\r\n\r\nsuch  \"floating\" classes in about 58  schools,  an\r\n\r\naverage of two \"floating\" classes per school. This\r\n\r\nsystem has been introduced in schools where  there\r\n\r\nis   not  enough  ground  for  building  temporary\r\n\r\nstructures or where other means to accommodate the\r\n\r\nstudents  have failed. As a temporary measure,  we\r\n\r\nhave  built  some  50  additional  classrooms  and\r\n\r\nconverted   another   50   special   rooms    into\r\n\r\nclassrooms,   in  addition  to  these   \"floating\"\r\n\r\nclasses.  As soon as we have built enough schools,\r\n\r\nthere will no longer be any \"floating\" classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year I announced the change of exposure\r\n\r\ntime  for second language. As a result there is  a\r\n\r\nmassive transfer of teachers. This has to be  done\r\n\r\nto meet this change of policy. In fact, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson can expect another massive transfer  at\r\n\r\nthe  end of this year and next year so as to reach\r\n\r\nthe  target in 1975 whereby more than 40 per  cent\r\n\r\nof  the curriculum time in primary schools will be\r\n\r\nin  the  second language. Sir, in such a  transfer\r\n\r\nexercise, school principals are generally asked to\r\n\r\nsubmit the names of teachers who will be redundant\r\n\r\nand,  therefore,  available for re-posting.  Under\r\n\r\nthis  arrangement,  certain  appeals  against  the\r\n\r\ntransfer  are sympathetically considered  and,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  entertained. But it is not always  possible\r\n\r\nto  accommodate  the wishes of  every  teacher  in\r\n\r\nrespect of the school of his choice. To do so will\r\n\r\nresult in chaos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am afraid I am not aware of any case where\r\n\r\nteachers  have  been transferred  by  a  telephone\r\n\r\ncall. If the Member for Anson is aware of any such\r\n\r\ncase,  please  let me know, and I will  definitely\r\n\r\nlook into the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has raised a number of\r\n\r\nquestions. On the question of shortage of teachers\r\n\r\nfor the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecond  language in respect of the  implementation\r\n\r\nof  our bilingual policy, as I mentioned just now,\r\n\r\nthe  way  to overcome this problem is to introduce\r\n\r\nan  integrated teaching approach as has been  done\r\n\r\nin  many  schools. And we will see the results  of\r\n\r\nour work very soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also suggested that in view of the\r\n\r\nshortage of physical education teachers, we should\r\n\r\nrun  more  in-service courses  during  the  school\r\n\r\nvacation.  I  think this is a good idea.  We  will\r\n\r\nlook  into  his  suggestion, and implement  it  if\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has quoted examples of relief teachers\r\n\r\nwho  have been doing relief teaching for 10  years\r\n\r\nor  so.  I am afraid I am not aware of such cases,\r\n\r\nand  I  would be most grateful if he could let  me\r\n\r\nhave more particulars. If the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nknows of such cases, it is not only his duty as  a\r\n\r\nMember  of Parliament but as a citizen to  let  mc\r\n\r\nknow instead of keeping us in the dark. Sir, I  am\r\n\r\nafraid   that  the  use  of  relief  teachers   is\r\n\r\nunavoidable. Relief teachers are used, as  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  almost  every year to relieve  teachers  on\r\n\r\nmaternity leave and so on. Unless we can  do  away\r\n\r\nwith  maternity  leave and prevent  teachers  from\r\n\r\ngoing  on  maternity leave, we still have  to  use\r\n\r\nrelief teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I could not disagree with the Member that\r\n\r\nthere must be greater rapport between teachers and\r\n\r\nstudents. We are encouraging this by all means and\r\n\r\nthe ECA is one of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one point which I am afraid the\r\n\r\nMember  seems to contradict himself. At  first  he\r\n\r\npointed  out that we have a shortage of  teachers,\r\n\r\nand therefore we have to use relief teachers. Five\r\n\r\nminutes  later he said that we should  reduce  the\r\n\r\nnumber of students per class, which means that  we\r\n\r\nrequire  more teachers. Sir, we would not be  able\r\n\r\nto get the teachers, and we would not also he able\r\n\r\nto  satisfy  the  Member for Anson  because  there\r\n\r\nwould   not  be  enough  classrooms.  Until   such\r\n\r\nfacilities are available, we will not be  able  to\r\n\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, notwithstanding the many good words the\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang has said about the Ministry,\r\n\r\nI  am  afraid  there  is  no  demand  for  a  pre-University class in Sembawang. We will  look  into\r\n\r\nthis when the need arises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nhas not answered my points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, my apologies. The Member\r\n\r\nfor Moulmein has raised two points relating to the\r\n\r\neligibility of the teaching service in respect  of\r\n\r\nthe  conversion of leave eligibility into monetary\r\n\r\nterms,  and the other the extension of  the  Merit\r\n\r\nIncrement  Scheme to the upper timescale  officers\r\n\r\nin  the  teaching service.

First, the\r\n\r\nMinister has said that the implementation  of  our\r\n\r\nbilingualism  policy  now  will  not   cause   any\r\n\r\ndifficulty. Therefore, when he says that there  is\r\n\r\nno problem for the Chinese schools to use English,\r\n\r\nI  hope he could also say the same for the use  of\r\n\r\nChinese in English schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that he has asked us to\r\n\r\npromote  bilingualism.  But  I  recall  that   the\r\n\r\nChinese  teachers'  union asked  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  to  make  available more  teachers  and\r\n\r\nfacilities  to help its members learn  the  second\r\n\r\nlanguage,  and  so  far it has  not  received  any\r\n\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am quite\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with the reply given by  the  Minister,\r\n\r\nexcept  for  the problem relating to shortlisting,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  would like him to clarify.

And  in\r\n\r\ncertain other schools, none of the applicants  was\r\n\r\ncalled   for  interview.

In\r\n\r\nfact,  I  thought  he  has got  a  bonus  already.\r\n\r\nAnyway,  the Ministry of Education, together  with\r\n\r\nthe  Institute of Education and the Chinese Middle\r\n\r\nSchool Teachers' Union, is currently looking  into\r\n\r\nthe possibility of running courses during the long\r\n\r\nvacation, in July and at the end of the year,  for\r\n\r\nthis particular purpose. When it is organised,  it\r\n\r\nwill be open to everyone in the teaching service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point raised by the Member for Jurong\r\n\r\nregarding  the promotion exercise,  where  in  one\r\n\r\nschool  practically  all those  who  applied  were\r\n\r\nshortlisted whereas in another school none of  the\r\n\r\napplicants  was  shortlisted,  is  a  very   valid\r\n\r\nexample.  In  fact,  I  am  fully  aware  of  this\r\n\r\nphenomenon.  As  a  result  we  are  contemplating\r\n\r\nintroducing  a  ranking  system  for  confidential\r\n\r\nreports in schools whereby a principal has to rank\r\n\r\nhis  staff, say, 10 per cent of the best,  15  per\r\n\r\ncent  of the second best, and so on, so that there\r\n\r\nwill  be  an  even spread of those called  up  for\r\n\r\ninterview.

We have three secondary\r\n\r\nschools  in Sembawang with a few hundred Secondary\r\n\r\nIV graduates every year, but they do not have pre-University  classes.  I am sure  Sembawang  has  a\r\n\r\nsufficient  number of students for  pre-University\r\n\r\nclasses  to  be set up in Sembawang.

This is not the way.\r\n\r\nSome of the students have to travel a few miles to\r\n\r\ngo  to the pre-University classes.

But where administration and salary\r\n\r\nconditions are concerned, the two universities are\r\n\r\nafforded   different   treatment.   The    Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity teaching and administrative  staff  are\r\n\r\nat  a  disadvantage. Recently, the salary  of  the\r\n\r\nVice-Chancellor  of  the  Nanyang  University  was\r\n\r\nraised  to the same level as that of the Singapore\r\n\r\nUniversity.  This symbolises that the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  is  trying to standardise the  salaries\r\n\r\nand   working  conditions  of  the  teaching   and\r\n\r\nadministrative staff of the two universities.  The\r\n\r\ngraduates  of the two universities are  given  the\r\n\r\nsame  treatment  when  they  work  in  the  public\r\n\r\nsector.  The two Vice-Chancellors are getting  the\r\n\r\nsame  salary.  So  there  is  no  reason  why  the\r\n\r\nadministrative  and  teaching  staff  of  the  two\r\n\r\nuniversities should not be standardised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the designations and titles of the teaching\r\n\r\nstaff  of  the  two universities are different.  A\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Singapore lecturer has  a  maximum\r\n\r\nsalary  of  $1,700 and an Assistant  Professor  in\r\n\r\nNanyang University has a maximum salary of $1,600.\r\n\r\nA  senior  lecturer in the University of Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  a  salary of $1,200 rising to $2,050. But  an\r\n\r\nAssociate  Professor in Nanyang University  has  a\r\n\r\nsalary  of only $1,650 rising to $1,850. It  seems\r\n\r\nthat  in the same country the Professor is not  as\r\n\r\ngood  as the Lecturer. This sort of phenomenon  is\r\n\r\nlikely to lead to confusion and misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the salaries of the two Vice-Chancellors are\r\n\r\nthe  same.  The  teaching and  the  administrative\r\n\r\nstaff  of the two universities are doing the  same\r\n\r\njob.  Why  cannot we standardise the designations,\r\n\r\nsalary  scales and working conditions?  Under  the\r\n\r\npresent  system, if a lecturer from the University\r\n\r\nof Singapore is transferred to Nanyang University,\r\n\r\nhe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  become an Assistant Professor or an Associate\r\n\r\nProfessor,  but his salary may be  lower.  On  the\r\n\r\nother hand, if an Assistant or Associate Professor\r\n\r\nin  Nanyang  University,  is  transferred  to  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Singapore, he can  only  become  a\r\n\r\nlecturer  and  his salary can be even  higher.  So\r\n\r\nsome  people  may think that the standard  of  one\r\n\r\nuniversity  is  higher  than  that  of  the  other\r\n\r\nuniversity.

I think it is time  to  review  and\r\n\r\nstandardise the administrative system, and to  put\r\n\r\nright   the   various   anomalies.   The   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  is  a  University  initiated  by   the\r\n\r\npeople.   After   the   reorganisation   of    the\r\n\r\nuniversity, it is under Government's finance.  The\r\n\r\nNanyang  University is doing the job  of  training\r\n\r\nthe   elite   of  our  society.  We   should   not\r\n\r\ndiscriminate between the two universities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise is in regard\r\n\r\nto  the housing loan for Nanyang University staff.\r\n\r\nI  know  that  the  staff  in  the  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore are entitled to housing loans.  But  the\r\n\r\nstaff,  both teaching and administrative,  in  the\r\n\r\nNanyang  University are riot entitled  to  housing\r\n\r\nloans.

The trouble, as far  as  salary\r\n\r\nscale  is  concerned, lies in  Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nhaving  a great proliferation of titles and  names\r\n\r\nand  scales.  For  example, in the  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  there are ranks of Professor, Associate\r\n\r\nProfessor, Senior Lecturer, Lecturer and Assistant\r\n\r\nLecturer.   Whereas  in  the   case   of   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  there are such titles  as  Foundation\r\n\r\nProfessor,  Professor, Associate Professor,  Grade\r\n\r\nI;   Associate  Professor,  Grade  II;   Assistant\r\n\r\nProfessor-I  am  not quite sure whether  there  is\r\n\r\nGrade I or Grade II - then Lecturer,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssistant Lecturer, and Teacher.

I can assure  both  the  Members\r\n\r\nfor  Delta and Jurong that the principle of parity\r\n\r\nis definitely being applied. In fact, the Ministry\r\n\r\nhopes  to  take  up this matter with  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  to  consolidate the  great  number  of\r\n\r\ngrades  of  academic staff so as to  conform  with\r\n\r\ninternationally acceptable ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid the Member for Jurong does not quite\r\n\r\nget   his  facts  right.  Academic  staff  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore obtain their housing loans\r\n\r\nfrom the University of Singapore, and the loan  is\r\n\r\na  private fund of the University. It has  nothing\r\n\r\nto  do  with  Government. It is an endowment  from\r\n\r\ndonations  in  the  past, and  they  have  a  huge\r\n\r\nendowment fund from which, I think, the  loan  was\r\n\r\nobtained.  I am afraid the Nanyang University  has\r\n\r\nno  such funds. Perhaps what it can do is to raise\r\n\r\na  large  endowment fund, and the interest accrued\r\n\r\ntherefrom can be used for housing loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of\r\n\r\nthe grand reply given by the Minister, I hope that\r\n\r\nin the not too distant future the staff of the two\r\n\r\nuniversities  will  be  given  exactly  the   same\r\n\r\nconditions of service.

In fact,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is encouraging students not only to  be\r\n\r\ngood  in their studies but also to build a  rugged\r\n\r\nbody. To achieve this, sufficient facilities  must\r\n\r\nbe  provided. But in the case of children who live\r\n\r\nin the vicinity of schools in the slums of Kampung\r\n\r\nKembangan,  they are not allowed to  make  use  of\r\n\r\nschool playgrounds. Where then can they go to?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has called for the\r\n\r\nformation of School Advisory Committees comprising\r\n\r\nparents  and  people living near the schools.  The\r\n\r\npurpose  of  these  Committees is  to  enable  the\r\n\r\npeople to share the responsibility and progress of\r\n\r\nthe  school,  and  to help expand its  activities.\r\n\r\nSuch committees have done a lot to raise funds  to\r\n\r\nachieve  these  objectives. Some of them  organise\r\n\r\nfunfairs, jumble sales and also cinema shows, etc.\r\n\r\nFunds collected from these efforts are contributed\r\n\r\nby  people who live close to the schools. However,\r\n\r\nwhen their children want to make use of the school\r\n\r\nplaygrounds, they are not allowed to. An  incident\r\n\r\ntook  place  in one of the primary schools  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency.  The  school  principal   saw   some\r\n\r\nchildren playing in the school playground and sent\r\n\r\nfor the police to arrest them. Some of the parents\r\n\r\nof  these  children  are  members  of  the  School\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Committee and had worked  very  hard  to\r\n\r\nraise  funds  for  the school by  selling  funfair\r\n\r\ntickets and cinema tickets. So they approached me,\r\n\r\nas  MP  for  Kampung Kembangan, to  help  them  to\r\n\r\nobtain the release of their children. This is  not\r\n\r\nthe  way to further establish rapport between  the\r\n\r\nschool  and  parents. On the other hand,  it  will\r\n\r\ncreate  enmity which will lead to their reluctance\r\n\r\nto  give support to the School Advisory Committee.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I wish to know whether the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation  can  allow children who live  close  to\r\n\r\nschools  to  make  use of the  school  playgrounds\r\n\r\neither during or after school hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\nreply  to  the question raised by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKampung  Kembangan, I am happy  to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education does consider applications\r\n\r\nfrom  outside  organisations to make  use  of  the\r\n\r\nschool  playing fields after school hours, subject\r\n\r\nto  the  payment of a small fee.

The main purpose of ETV is to\r\n\r\nraise  the efficiency of teaching in the  schools.\r\n\r\nETV  is  indeed a good method of teaching and  its\r\n\r\nprogrammes   are   a   very   useful   medium   of\r\n\r\ninstruction.  In  this  respect,   I   have   some\r\n\r\nquestions to ask the Minister concerned. First the\r\n\r\ntelecast  time  seems  to  be  rather  short   and\r\n\r\nlimited, and it cannot therefore achieve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  much  as  it should. For example, the  various\r\n\r\nclasses  in  the primary schools have  only  seven\r\n\r\nprogrammes for the whole term, and each  programme\r\n\r\nis  only  for 15 minutes. This is too  short.  The\r\n\r\nvarious classes include Primaries I, II, III,  and\r\n\r\nV.  Primaries IV and VI, however, do not have  any\r\n\r\nETV  programmes,  and  this  seems  to  give  good\r\n\r\ntreatment on the one hand and yet not well  enough\r\n\r\non   the  other.  What  is  the  reason  for  this\r\n\r\ndiscrepancy?  Why  are there  no  good  television\r\n\r\nprogrammes for Primaries IV and VI? Is it  because\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  shortage of teaching  materials  for\r\n\r\nPrimaries  IV  and VI? If there is a shortage,  by\r\n\r\nall  means  proceed to acquire  the  relevant  and\r\n\r\nnecessary  materials  for  the  benefit   of   the\r\n\r\nPrimaries  IV  and  VI students.  In  addition  to\r\n\r\nincreasing the telecast time for ETV programmes, I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether  the Minister  for  Education  can\r\n\r\nconsult  the Minister for Culture, who is  present\r\n\r\nhere  now  -  after all, television is  under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Culture-as to whether it is  possible\r\n\r\nto  telecast  part  of the ETV programmes  in  the\r\n\r\nevening. But if the Minister says that this is not\r\n\r\nreally necessary because we have to let the pupils\r\n\r\nhave some rest or recreation in the evenings, then\r\n\r\nI say that if this is what he thinks, it is wrong.\r\n\r\nIf  we want a student to have a firm impression of\r\n\r\nwhat  he  has  studied  in the  day,  then  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to give him the opportunity to revise in\r\n\r\nthe evening. So if we can telecast it again in the\r\n\r\nevening,  the  parents will be able  to  supervise\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impression will be better if the students are\r\n\r\ngiven  the opportunity to see the programmes again\r\n\r\nin  the  evening.  We know that  very  often  they\r\n\r\nforget  what they have learned. The Ministers  are\r\n\r\nall bright and learned people. So I would like  to\r\n\r\nknow  whether  it  is possible to  telecast  these\r\n\r\nprogrammes in the evenings. I think this is a very\r\n\r\ngood programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise is since we\r\n\r\nare  spending a few hundred thousand dollars every\r\n\r\nyear, therefore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  must  get  some returns from this expenditure.\r\n\r\nHas  the  Ministry of Education made any study  to\r\n\r\nassess  the  returns we get from the provision  of\r\n\r\nthis service?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Mr Chai Chong Yii):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang asked his questions in Mandarin,  may  I\r\n\r\nbe permitted to answer in Mandarin?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, we are thankful\r\n\r\nto  the Member for Sembawang for his concern about\r\n\r\neducational television service. There is no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat telecasting time for this programme is rather\r\n\r\nshort. But we must understand that although it  is\r\n\r\na  short  programme, it requires a great  deal  of\r\n\r\neffort and preparation to put up the programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Sembawang said\r\n\r\nthat  Primary  IV and Primary VI students  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  ETV  programmes. Perhaps he is referring  to\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  stream. As for  the  other  language\r\n\r\nstreams,  Primary IV and Primary VI do have  these\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  It  is therefore not correct  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  there  are no ETV programmes for Primary  IV\r\n\r\nand  Primary VI students. Besides it is  difficult\r\n\r\nto  say whether the ETV programmes are confined to\r\n\r\nstudents of certain standards only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of expenditure for these\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  I  would  like  to  say   that   this\r\n\r\nexpenditure is worthwhile. Since we started  these\r\n\r\nprogrammes  in 1966, the returns we have  achieved\r\n\r\ncan  be seen in many respects. I cannot elaborate,\r\n\r\nmeasure  or  itemise all the good  results  but  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to pick out the main benefits that  we\r\n\r\nhave  achieved. The first point is  that  we  have\r\n\r\nprovided a more systematic teaching programme  for\r\n\r\nthe  various classes in the primary schools,  with\r\n\r\nparticular   emphasis  on  science,   mathematics,\r\n\r\nlanguage and social science. We have prepared more\r\n\r\nsystematic teaching methods on these subjects. The\r\n\r\nsecond  point is that through the ETV  programmes,\r\n\r\nwe   have  provided  new  teaching  material   and\r\n\r\ntechniques for teachers. We have achieved  a  fair\r\n\r\namount in this particular respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThirdly, through the ETV service, teaching methods\r\n\r\nmay   be  revised  and  brought  up-to-date.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  new techniques and methods  of  teaching\r\n\r\nhave  been  introduced. Fourthly, ETV service  has\r\n\r\ndone   a  lot  to  promote  the  use  of  teaching\r\n\r\nmaterials    and    teaching   aids,    such    as\r\n\r\ntransparencies and colour slides, video-tapes, and\r\n\r\nso  on.  We  have made use of these materials  and\r\n\r\nhave  promoted  the application of  such  teaching\r\n\r\naids.  We  have  also conducted  seminars  on  the\r\n\r\napplication of teaching aids to assist teachers in\r\n\r\ngeneral, and I think we have achieved something in\r\n\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the question that some of the programmes\r\n\r\nshould  be  telecast  in  the  evenings,  we  have\r\n\r\nalready  done  this.  It is only  because  of  the\r\n\r\nlimitation  of time that we cannot do  this  on  a\r\n\r\nwider scale. We have co-operated with the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture and the Adult Education Board  to  put\r\n\r\ncertain  programmes  over  television,  like   the\r\n\r\nteaching  of  English and how to play the  guitar.\r\n\r\nAll  these  are relevant to educational television\r\n\r\nservice.  But, as I have said, because of  certain\r\n\r\nlimitations, we cannot do it on a bigger scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister of State's fairly good reply, I  beg\r\n\r\nleave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1501 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2108.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know what are the breakdown\r\n\r\nfigures of the grants to the four institutions  of\r\n\r\nhigher  learning.

Sir, over the past few years the  Annual\r\n\r\nYouth  Festival has been organised by the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education so that our youths would be given an\r\n\r\nopportunity to show their potential in art, music,\r\n\r\nsports  and other activities. This is commendable.\r\n\r\nHowever,  much  organisational  work  is  involved\r\n\r\nduring   the   period  before  the  Annual   Youth\r\n\r\nFestival.  It  takes months to  prepare  for  this\r\n\r\nfestival, and only those students involved  in  it\r\n\r\nwill  take part in such activities. Other students\r\n\r\nare not even aware of the Annual Youth Festival. I\r\n\r\nwonder whether the Minister for Education will set\r\n\r\naside one day as a Youth Day so that all the young\r\n\r\npeople   in  Singapore  can  take  part   in   the\r\n\r\ncelebration  of  the  Annual Youth  Festival.  For\r\n\r\nexample, the children have Children's Day on which\r\n\r\nthe   primary   schools   are   closed   for   the\r\n\r\ncelebrations  to  be  carried out.  Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nshould  have a Youth Day to enable the  youths  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to take part in various activities  and\r\n\r\ngive more meaning to the Annual Youth Festival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposal by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Jurong to set aside one day in the\r\n\r\nschool  calendar  to be called Youth  Day  and  to\r\n\r\ncoincide  with  the opening of  the  Annual  Youth\r\n\r\nFestival is indeed a laudable one.

On the question of school\r\n\r\ncrossing patrol in the Jurong Town Primary  School\r\n\r\nin Jurong Town, they have a problem which has been\r\n\r\nin  existence  for some time. It is  a  source  of\r\n\r\nworry  to the parents and students because of  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in employing people to do  the  school\r\n\r\ncrossing patrol. As a result of the difficulty  in\r\n\r\nrecruitment,  some teachers have  been  given  the\r\n\r\nduty  of  guiding the school children  across  the\r\n\r\nroad.  They  do this by rotation. I do  not  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  proper because the teachers  have  other\r\n\r\nduties   to  perform.  Moreover,  they   have   no\r\n\r\nexperience   in  school  crossing   patrol   work.\r\n\r\nRequests have been made to the Police to help  the\r\n\r\nstudents to cross the road. But a policeman  would\r\n\r\nonly  turn  up  at certain times, while  at  other\r\n\r\ntimes  he  would fail to turn up. You can imagine,\r\n\r\nSir,  how  heavy the traffic is along  Corporation\r\n\r\nDrive because of the industrial development there.\r\n\r\nIt  is  difficult to cross the road.  Without  any\r\n\r\nhelp from the school crossing patrol, the students\r\n\r\nwill be exposed to a lot of danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that there has been a high rate of\r\n\r\nresignations of school crossing patrolmen  because\r\n\r\nof  the low pay which, I understand, is only $4.65\r\n\r\nper  day. This wage is only paid for working days.\r\n\r\nIn other words, they do not get paid on Sundays or\r\n\r\npublic holidays. They can only earn about $100 per\r\n\r\nmonth for doing this kind of work. They can easily\r\n\r\nget  more  than  this amount  in  any  factory  in\r\n\r\nJurong.  Unless  their wages are increased,  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid that this school in Jurong will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnever   be   able  to  employ  a  school  crossing\r\n\r\npatrolman. I hope consideration will be  given  to\r\n\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Jurong is to be commended for  his\r\n\r\ninterest in the safety of school children  in  his\r\n\r\nconstituency.   School  crossing   patrolmen   are\r\n\r\nnormally employed on a part-time basis because  of\r\n\r\nthe  short hours of work. On the average, a school\r\n\r\ncrossing patrolman works only five hours per  day.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the daily wage is quite comparable  to\r\n\r\nthe  other  daily-rated  employees,  although   it\r\n\r\ncannot he said to be very attractive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the school mentioned by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jurong,  we  are aware that  this  particular\r\n\r\nschool   has   been  without  a  school   crossing\r\n\r\npatrolman  for quite some time. But  he  has  also\r\n\r\nmentioned that teachers have been asked to perform\r\n\r\nthe  duty  of a patrolman. I think it  is  a  good\r\n\r\nidea.  In  fact, it is good for teachers  or  even\r\n\r\nolder  students to take an interest in the welfare\r\n\r\nof  the younger school children. I agree with  him\r\n\r\nthat  teachers have their own work to do, and that\r\n\r\nthe  duty  of  guiding children  across  the  road\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  their main concern.  However,  if\r\n\r\nteachers  could guide school children  across  the\r\n\r\nroad,  it will promote better relationship between\r\n\r\nstudents and teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we have been trying very hard, it is still\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  get  an adequate number  of  school\r\n\r\ncrossing  patrolmen. The difficulty of  recruiting\r\n\r\nthe  required  number of men within a  short  time\r\n\r\ncould probably be due to the availability of  jobs\r\n\r\nin  Jurong.  If we can get hawkers in  the  school\r\n\r\ncanteen or tuck-shop to take up this employment on\r\n\r\na  part-time basis, perhaps the problem of low pay\r\n\r\nand the difficulty of recruitment can be solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, Sir, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation has also given consideration to the need\r\n\r\nof   getting  assistance  from  the  Public  Works\r\n\r\nDepartment to build either a pedestrian overhead\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbridge or a traffic control point at the school to\r\n\r\nsolve  this problem. But personally it is my  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the teachers will continue to give a  little\r\n\r\nof  their  time  for this kind of service  to  the\r\n\r\npupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know  whether the Minister of  State  for\r\n\r\nEducation   is   aware  that  a  school   crossing\r\n\r\npatrolman  must  first be trained by  the  Police.\r\n\r\nWithout  the proper supervision of the Police,  no\r\n\r\nTom,  Dick  or Harry can do traffic control  duty.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is impossible to get hawkers in  the\r\n\r\nschool  tuck-shop  to  take up  this  job  without\r\n\r\nproper training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that school crossing patrolmen should be\r\n\r\nemployed   on   a   part-time   basis   is    also\r\n\r\nunacceptable. No doubt the actual working time  is\r\n\r\nfive  hours, but the five working hours are spread\r\n\r\nover  the  whole  day.  He  cannot  therefore   be\r\n\r\nexpected  to be gainfully employed in between  his\r\n\r\nduty  hours, which are spread over three sessions,\r\n\r\nmorning, afternoon and evening. He cannot take  up\r\n\r\nany other employment in between his duty hours.  I\r\n\r\nhope   the   Minister  of  State   will   consider\r\n\r\nincreasing the salary because this is one  way  of\r\n\r\ngetting  the necessary manpower for this  job.  If\r\n\r\nyou  ask a teacher to take up this job, of course,\r\n\r\nhe  will have to do it. But I do not think this is\r\n\r\nan   appropriate  duty  for  a  teacher.   Another\r\n\r\nsuggestion  from  the Minister of  State  is  that\r\n\r\nsenior  students should be asked to do  this  job.\r\n\r\nBut I think it is quite risky for them to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is,  of course, true that training is required\r\n\r\nfor  the school crossing patrolman. It is  a  very\r\n\r\nsimple  form  of training. If the hawkers  in  the\r\n\r\nschool tuck-shop are prepared to take up this job,\r\n\r\nthere will be no difficulty in getting the traffic\r\n\r\npolice  to give them the training. I am  sure  the\r\n\r\ntraffic  police  will be quite  willing  to  train\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the comment that it s not quite\r\n\r\nsuitable  for  teachers to take  up  this  job,  I\r\n\r\npersonally feel that,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalthough  my  view  may not be acceptable  to  the\r\n\r\nMember for Jurong, it is a very simple task  which\r\n\r\nthe  teachers  can undertake after the  school  is\r\n\r\ndismissed.  It  will only take ten  minutes  after\r\n\r\neach  session  at the most to guide  the  students\r\n\r\nacross the road. But if this is not feasible, then\r\n\r\nthe  only  way  left is to set up a traffic  light\r\n\r\ncontrol  at  the school.

Of course, it may be  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  anyone  to take up this job if he  lives  far\r\n\r\naway  from the school.

I have come across a case  where  a\r\n\r\nhousewife  was given the job of a school  crossing\r\n\r\npatrolwoman  by  the Employment Exchange.  In  her\r\n\r\ndaily  life  this woman seldom goes out,  and  she\r\n\r\nmight even find this job of school crossing patrol\r\n\r\ndifficult to manage. Therefore, this matter of any\r\n\r\nTom,  Dick and Harry, or even Mary taking up  this\r\n\r\njob  is  open to question. For the safety  of  the\r\n\r\nchildren, we should not employ any person  who  is\r\n\r\nnot  able to look after his or her own safety when\r\n\r\ncrossing the road. If he cannot look after his own\r\n\r\nsafety,  how then can we expect him to look  after\r\n\r\nthe  safety of the children crossing the road?  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, there are some former civil servants\r\n\r\nwho  have  retired at the age of 55  but  who  are\r\n\r\nstill  physically fit.

If I can recall rightly,  I  remember\r\n\r\nthat  every year we had occasion to come  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse  to revote about half a million dollars  for\r\n\r\nthe   building  of  staff  quarters   of   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.  Last year there was  such  a  revote.\r\n\r\nThis  year  there  is again a  revote  of  half  a\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars for such a building.  Maybe  next\r\n\r\nyear we will have to revote again. I would like to\r\n\r\nask the Minister why has the building of the staff\r\n\r\nquarters   been   delayed.   According    to    my\r\n\r\nunderstanding, the staff are waiting to move  into\r\n\r\nthe  quarters because many of them have come  from\r\n\r\nabroad. If there is no such facility, it is rather\r\n\r\ninconvenient  to them because at the  moment  they\r\n\r\nare  living  very  far away from  the  University.\r\n\r\nAlthough they are used to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  travelling distance at the moment, but if  we\r\n\r\ncan  provide them with these quarters, it will  be\r\n\r\nhelpful  to  them.

Since then,  we\r\n\r\nhave a more detailed study of the master plan  and\r\n\r\nare  having  second  thoughts about  it.  We  have\r\n\r\ndecided  instead  to  appoint  a  local  team   of\r\n\r\narchitects  to  prepare another master  plan,  and\r\n\r\nthis  will  be ready soon.

The setting up of the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Training Board is a very good move.  In\r\n\r\nthis  respect,  perhaps we may be faced  with  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty   of   obtaining   suitable   technical\r\n\r\nteachers.  At  the  moment the  factories  are  in\r\n\r\nurgent  need  of trained and skilled  technicians,\r\n\r\nand have offered attractive pay for such people. I\r\n\r\nraise  this  question  now so  that  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned  will be able to give his  attention  to\r\n\r\nthe  problem  in  advance, that is,  the  pay  and\r\n\r\ntreatment  accorded to the technical teachers.  It\r\n\r\nseems that their salary is lower than that of  the\r\n\r\ntechnicians  in  the factories. I  am  afraid  the\r\n\r\nexperienced   and   trained   teachers   in   this\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Training School may be  absorbed  into\r\n\r\nthe  factories. So I hope the Minister will  raise\r\n\r\ntheir salary at least equal to that of the skilled\r\n\r\ntechnicians employed in the factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about the long hair problem.\r\n\r\nThis  has  been mentioned when we debated  on  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Home Affairs, but I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nraise  it again. We have a certain training course\r\n\r\nunder   the  joint  industry-Government   training\r\n\r\nscheme, and many of the trainees are sporting long\r\n\r\nhair. The Ministry concerned with this scheme does\r\n\r\nnot  seem to have given any instructions to  these\r\n\r\ntrainees to cut their hair\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshort.   I  do  not  know  whether  this  is   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the school principal  concerned,\r\n\r\nor  whether  it is the responsibility  of  someone else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is, after the setting up of\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial  Training  Board,  what  kind   of\r\n\r\nindustrial and technical training courses will  be\r\n\r\navailable, and how many students will be recruited\r\n\r\ninto these various courses?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, the attraction by the\r\n\r\nindustry  to experienced qualified staff from  the\r\n\r\nteaching institute is a phenomenon throughout  the\r\n\r\nworld. It is not peculiar to Singapore, but we are\r\n\r\ntrying  our best to retain them. May I just  quote\r\n\r\nan   example?  Recently  the  Ngee  Ann  Technical\r\n\r\nCollege   offered  an  appointment  to  a   former\r\n\r\ngraduate.  Immediately after the offer  was  made,\r\n\r\nthe  firm  in  which  he  is employed  immediately\r\n\r\ndoubled  his salary, thereby pie-venting him  from\r\n\r\ncoming  back to the College. It is precisely  with\r\n\r\nthis  problem  in  mind that we  have  established\r\n\r\njoint  training schools with major  industries  so\r\n\r\nthat  we can have their manpower to help us  train\r\n\r\nour own people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of long hair, the trainees in\r\n\r\nthis  joint  training school have to  observe  the\r\n\r\nrules  and regulations of the vocational institute\r\n\r\nin which they are housed. They are not supposed to\r\n\r\nkeep  long hair, and we will enforce the rule very\r\n\r\nstrictly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Training Board will take over the\r\n\r\nfunctions of industrial training formerly  handled\r\n\r\nby  the Technical Education Department. At present\r\n\r\nthe  Board  runs  some  40  different  courses  at\r\n\r\nvarious levels and of various durations, from  six\r\n\r\nmonths to two years. The output for 1972 was 4,000\r\n\r\nand  we expect to increase it to 6,000 in the near\r\n\r\nfuture. This is in addition to the 10,000 expected\r\n\r\nto  be  trained by the joint training  school,  as\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  my  colleague,  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nFinance, in an earlier debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank\r\n\r\nthe Minister for his answer, and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $259,741,150 for Head 1501 ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $37,312,500 for Head 1501 ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The remaining heads of expenditure\r\n\r\nin  respect  of which no amendment stands  on  the\r\n\r\nOrder Paper Supplement are Heads 0103, 0104, 0106,\r\n\r\n0107,  0109,  0302, 0602, 0702, 1102, 1103,  1105,\r\n\r\n1106, 1109, 1110, 1403 and 1405.
