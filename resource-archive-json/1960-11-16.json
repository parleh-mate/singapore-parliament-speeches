When the law  was\r\n\r\npassed, the power of the Minister to direct that  a\r\n\r\nsupervisee shall remain within such area as may  be\r\n\r\nspecified in a Supervision Order was interpreted to\r\n\r\nmean  that a person under Supervision Order can  be\r\n\r\nprohibited from visiting any area specified in  the\r\n\r\nOrder.  In  an  appeal against the acquittal  of  a\r\n\r\nsupervisee for breaking this condition, it was held\r\n\r\nby  the  High  Court that the power  to  confine  a\r\n\r\nperson on a Supervision Order to a particular  area\r\n\r\ndoes  not  entitle  the  Minister  to  impose   the\r\n\r\ncondition that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe shall not visit the area specified in the Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Government's campaign against secret\r\n\r\nsocieties, it has been found that such a  provision\r\n\r\nin  the  Criminal Law has been effective in curbing\r\n\r\nsecret  society  activities. The continued  use  of\r\n\r\nthis condition is therefore very desirable in order\r\n\r\nto  prevent persons placed under Supervision Orders\r\n\r\nfrom  visiting areas which have been the  scene  of\r\n\r\ntheir  past secret society activities. The Criminal\r\n\r\nLaw  (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance is  therefore\r\n\r\nbeing  amended to make this condition  intra  vires\r\n\r\nthe law. This condition is used judiciously and  is\r\n\r\napplied  mainly  to those secret society  gangsters\r\n\r\nwho,  although they do not live or work in  certain\r\n\r\nstreets  or  areas,  have been concentrating  their\r\n\r\nactivities  or  exerting their  evil  influence  in\r\n\r\nthose streets or areas. These streets or areas have\r\n\r\nbeen  well  rid  of the presence  of  these  social\r\n\r\nparasites. This amendment to the law, Sir,  follows\r\n\r\na  similar  provision  in the Prevention  of  Crime\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 1959, of the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the help of the powers granted under\r\n\r\nthe  Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1955,  the  Government has dealt telling  blows  on\r\n\r\nsecret society activities and is getting on top  of\r\n\r\nthe  situation. The secret society  menace  is  now\r\n\r\nbeing  dealt with under a two-pronged strategy.  On\r\n\r\nthe   one  hand,  thugs  and  gangsters  are  being\r\n\r\ncontinually  kept on the run, while  on  the  other\r\n\r\nhand those under detention are now being channelled\r\n\r\nthrough the educative and rehabilitative process of\r\n\r\nthe   Pulau   Senang  scheme.  The   Pulau   Senang\r\n\r\nexperiment  has gone off to a good  start  and  its\r\n\r\npresent  progress  gives  cause  for  hope  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itsself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Mr Ong Pang Boon].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT TO A LATER DAY MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That at its rising this day, this\r\n\r\nAssembly  do  stand  adjourned  to  29th  November,\r\n\r\n1960.\"-[The  Deputy Prime Minister-Dr  Toh  Chin Chye.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>QUEEN STREET AND SILAT ROAD SIKH GURDAWARAS BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>Introduction and First Reading</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leave be given to bring in a Bill to\r\n\r\namalgamate the Queen Street and the Silat Road Sikh\r\n\r\nGurdawaras  and to place them under an Incorporated\r\n\r\nBoard of Trustees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this Bill is to amalgamate the two\r\n\r\nGurdawaras   under   a  single   constitution   and\r\n\r\nmanagement at the request of the present  Board  of\r\n\r\nTrustees.

The Undesirable  Publications\r\n\r\nOrdinance  is one of Government's main  weapons  in\r\n\r\nits   fight  against  lewd,  obscene,  immoral  and\r\n\r\nundesirable  publications  which  either  tend   to\r\n\r\ncorrupt  individuals or threaten  the  welfare  and\r\n\r\nsecurity   of  our  lawfully  and  constitutionally\r\n\r\nestablished State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the law as it stands, the powers of\r\n\r\nGovernment   under  this  Undesirable  Publications\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to  prohibit the importation,  sale  and\r\n\r\ncirculation  of  any  undesirable  publication  are\r\n\r\nrestricted  to publications which are published  or\r\n\r\nprinted  outside Singapore or printed in  Singapore\r\n\r\notherwise  than  in  accordance with  the  Printing\r\n\r\nPresses Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, certain local writers and\r\n\r\npublishers have taken advantage of loopholes in the\r\n\r\nPrinting  Presses  Ordinance to print  and  publish\r\n\r\nundesirable  material.  By  undesirable,  we   mean\r\n\r\nwritings  which  are  morally  offensive   or   are\r\n\r\ncalculated  to  endanger  the  welfare,  peace  and\r\n\r\nsecurity  of  the  state. Thus  lewd,  immoral  and\r\n\r\nobscene publications are undesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Undesirable Publications Ordinance, as it now\r\n\r\nstands, cannot adequately control local undesirable\r\n\r\npublications  of this kind, because  certain  local\r\n\r\nwriters  and  publishers have been  cashing  in  by\r\n\r\ntaking  advantage of the definition of  \"newspaper\"\r\n\r\nin  the Printing Presses Ordinance. Because of this\r\n\r\ndefinition,  permits  are  not  required  to  print\r\n\r\npublications  in the form of novels, short  stories\r\n\r\nor  magazines containing only articles  of  general\r\n\r\nliterary interest, poems and short stories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a number of these books and magazines,\r\n\r\nthough superficially professing high moral and\r\n\r\nliterary facade, nevertheless contain articles,\r\n\r\npoems, and short stories which are undesirable.\r\n\r\nThere may be a show of dealing with sex and morals\r\n\r\nin an intelligent and adult fashion but those who\r\n\r\nread between the lines know that the intention is\r\n\r\nnot so high-minded and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nliterary, in other cases, though professing  to  be\r\n\r\nliterary  articles,  many  of  these  articles  are\r\n\r\nundesirable  in  content and purpose.  But  because\r\n\r\nthese publications do not require permits under the\r\n\r\nPrinting   Presses  Ordinance, they   cannot   be\r\n\r\nproceeded    against    under    the    Undesirable\r\n\r\nPublications Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible to amend the definition of\r\n\r\n\"newspaper\"  to  cover any type of publication  but\r\n\r\nthat  would affect bona fide local writers,  poets,\r\n\r\ndramatists, literary critics and novelists.  It  is\r\n\r\nour  purpose to encourage local writers to  produce\r\n\r\ngood  reading material - and more of it. By  amending\r\n\r\nthe  definition of \"newspaper\" we would be  putting\r\n\r\nlocal  writers to unnecessary trouble and delay  by\r\n\r\nsubjecting them to the procedure under the Printing\r\n\r\nPresses Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore considered that the best way of\r\n\r\npreventing  evasion  of the  laws  regarding  local\r\n\r\npublications in Singapore would be not to amend the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of \"newspaper\" in the Printing  Presses\r\n\r\nOrdinance,    but   to   amend   the    Undesirable\r\n\r\nPublications Ordinance by deleting from  section  3\r\n\r\nthereof the words \"published or printed outside the\r\n\r\nState or printed within the State otherwise than in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  the provisions  of  the  Printing\r\n\r\nPresses  Ordinance\". Such an amendment will empower\r\n\r\nthe Minister to proscribe any publication which  he\r\n\r\nconsiders undesirable, whether it is printed within\r\n\r\nor  without the State and whether it is printed  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the Printing Presses Ordinance  or\r\n\r\nnot.  Such an amendment will give the Police  power\r\n\r\nto   enter   premises  and  seize  such  proscribed\r\n\r\npublications under section 8 of the same Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it can therefore be seen that this short\r\n\r\nAmendment  Bill  is  aimed at  solely  against  the\r\n\r\nundesirable  local  writers  and  authors  who  are\r\n\r\ntaking  advantage  of a loophole  in  the  Printing\r\n\r\nPresses Ordinance to serve their own ends and their\r\n\r\nbank balances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.

The  activities  of  touts,\r\n\r\noperating  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Courts   and\r\n\r\nGovernment  and other public offices  have  been  a\r\n\r\nsource of considerable nuisance to the public,  and\r\n\r\nhitherto  it has proved very difficult  to  proceed\r\n\r\nagainst  them successfully for loitering under  the\r\n\r\nexisting Minor Offences Ordinance (Cap. 117).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These touts are not only a nuisance with their\r\n\r\npestering and ill-mannered ways, but they are  also\r\n\r\nhuman  sharks  who swindle the poor and  illiterate\r\n\r\nmembers of the public. They charge exorbitant  fees\r\n\r\nfor  filling in application forms, making Statutory\r\n\r\nDeclarations,  stamping  documents,  etc, or   for\r\n\r\ngiving them unauthorised and, more often than  not,\r\n\r\nwrong  advice.  They are also a  potent  source  of\r\n\r\ncorruption of Government officers when they act  as\r\n\r\ngo-betweens between the public and these Government\r\n\r\nofficers.  There have been cases of  corruption  by\r\n\r\nGovernment  officers linked with the activities  of\r\n\r\ntouts.  Again, touts sometimes pose as  persons  of\r\n\r\ninfluence  with departmental officers, and  for  an\r\n\r\nadequate  fee  can  be persuaded to  exercise  such\r\n\r\ninfluence  in obtaining documents or in  completing\r\n\r\nprocedures without delay. They even ask  for  money\r\n\r\nfrom   the   illiterate  by  pretending  to   bribe\r\n\r\nofficials for favours. What their gullible  clients\r\n\r\ndo not know is that in almost all cases the touts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npocket   the  money  themselves.  Of  course,   the\r\n\r\nreputation   of  the  public  service  is   thereby\r\n\r\nbesmirched. Furthermore, many of these touts do not\r\n\r\nfill  in  forms  correctly for their customers  and\r\n\r\nthese  forms consequently have to be amended before\r\n\r\nthey can be accepted. When this occurs, applicants,\r\n\r\ninstead  of blaming the touts, criticise Government\r\n\r\nservants  for unnecessarily giving them trouble  in\r\n\r\nrefusing to accept forms filled in incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative measures have been and are being\r\n\r\ntaken  to combat this touting nuisance and  a  good\r\n\r\nmeasure  of success has been achieved, but  it  has\r\n\r\nnot been possible to eliminate the touts completely\r\n\r\nfrom their happy touting ground nor to prevent them\r\n\r\nfrom  accosting members of the public  even  before\r\n\r\nthey reach the Courts and public offices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the activities and behaviour of\r\n\r\ntouts,  which I have just described, this Bill  has\r\n\r\nbeen   introduced  to  amend  the  Minor   Offences\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to  make it a seizable offence  for  any\r\n\r\nperson  to tout for any purpose connected with  any\r\n\r\ncourt  or  department  of the  Government  or  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  or to act as unauthorised adviser  to  any\r\n\r\nperson  who  has  business in  any  such  court  or\r\n\r\ndepartment. It also makes loitering in or near  any\r\n\r\ncourt  or  department  of the  Government  or  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  for any such purpose also an offence.  The\r\n\r\npunishment on conviction is a fine up to  $500,  or\r\n\r\nimprisonment up to 6 months, or to both  such  fine\r\n\r\nand imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhile  accepting the principle enunciated  in  this\r\n\r\nBill,   I  wish  to  draw  the  attention  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to certain difficulties that may crop up\r\n\r\nas a result of the implementation of this new Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the difficulties arise because the persons\r\n\r\nwho  are  set  upon by these touts are  illiterate.\r\n\r\nThey  do not understand Government procedure.  They\r\n\r\nwant somebody to help them over the difficulties of\r\n\r\nprocedure and language. It is because the necessity\r\n\r\nexists  and because nobody else can help them  that\r\n\r\nthese so-called touts go to their assistance.  Some\r\n\r\nof  them provide a service and some of them exploit\r\n\r\nthese  illiterates. I think it is the  exploitation\r\n\r\nof   these  people  by  touts  which  is  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is aiming at. The situation is, I  agree\r\n\r\nwith the Government, getting worse from day to day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remedy, Mr Speaker, Sir, to my mind is not\r\n\r\nthe  elimination  of the tout.  Because  if  we  do\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  eliminate the  tout,  the  need  will\r\n\r\nstill  be  there  and  somebody  must  provide  and\r\n\r\nsatisfy   that  need  so  far  as  the  public   is\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see in the Bill that the phrase \"an\r\n\r\nunauthorised adviser\" is used. I presume that  that\r\n\r\nis  being  used deliberately, because an authorised\r\n\r\nadviser, I take it, is not going to come within the\r\n\r\nambit  of this Bill. If one goes to the Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment one sees a number of persons  seated  at\r\n\r\ntables providing this service to people who  go  to\r\n\r\nthe  Immigration Department. I take it  that  under\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  they  will not be touts but  authorised\r\n\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly. Mr Speaker, Sir, if Government could\r\n\r\nprovide an authorised service for these people when\r\n\r\nthey  go  into  Court or Government departments  so\r\n\r\nthat  they will know where they are going, whom  to\r\n\r\nsee,  what  forms to get and how to fill  them  up,\r\n\r\nthen  I  think  the  tout will be eliminated.  This\r\n\r\nnaturally  will  mean that either  Government  will\r\n\r\nhave   to  increase  its  own  staff  or  authorise\r\n\r\nsomebody to provide this service either on  payment\r\n\r\nof a licence fee or on some other basis. But merely\r\n\r\nto  eliminate the tout and not to put somebody else\r\n\r\nin  his  place is going to lead certain members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public into difficulties and will put them  to\r\n\r\nundue stress and strain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Lee, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor   Farrer   Park  is  quite  right   about   the\r\n\r\nexploitation  part of it.

Strict control of the issue of forms or blank\r\n\r\ndocuments  so that they do not fall into the  hands\r\n\r\nof touts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Rearranging inquiries and advice counters in\r\n\r\norder  to  provide  for  more  efficient  reception\r\n\r\nservice. And of course finally,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.

The Bill also seeks to give power\r\n\r\nto the Police to obtain information relating to the\r\n\r\nperson  in  control  of a road vehicle  alleged  or\r\n\r\nsuspected  to have been used in connection  with  a\r\n\r\nscheduled offence under the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the light of experience, the existing\r\n\r\nRoad Vehicles (Special Powers) Ordinance, No. 8  of\r\n\r\n1960, has not been found to be completely effective\r\n\r\nin  its main purpose of enabling the Police in  its\r\n\r\ncampaign  against  criminals  and  secret   society\r\n\r\ngangsters to take effective action against vehicles\r\n\r\nused  in  connection  with  or  in  furtherance  of\r\n\r\ncriminal activities. In many cases, the Police have\r\n\r\nnot  been  able  to obtain orders of forfeiture  of\r\n\r\nmotor vehicles, because in certain circumstances it\r\n\r\nwas  difficult for them to first prove as  the  law\r\n\r\nrequired  that  they  had  reasonable  grounds  for\r\n\r\nsuspecting  that  there was  to  be  found  in  the\r\n\r\nvehicle any article in respect of which a scheduled\r\n\r\noffence  had been or was being committed,  although\r\n\r\nthey were certain that the vehicle was used in  the\r\n\r\ncommission of a scheduled offence. Again, under the\r\n\r\nexisting   Ordinance,   the   Court   could   order\r\n\r\nforfeiture of a vehicle seized under the provisions\r\n\r\nof  subsection  (2) of section 3 of  the  Ordinance\r\n\r\nonly when it was proved to its satisfaction that  a\r\n\r\nscheduled offence has been committed in respect  of\r\n\r\nany  article found in the vehicle or on any  person\r\n\r\nfound therein and seized by the Police or that such\r\n\r\nvehicle  was  used to convey persons to  the  scene\r\n\r\nwhere  the scheduled offence had been committed  or\r\n\r\nused for the escape or to facilitate the escape  of\r\n\r\npersons found in the scene of a scheduled offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the draft Bill, therefore, repeals\r\n\r\nthe original restrictive powers in section 4 of the\r\n\r\nexisting Ordinance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder  which the Police and the court had  to  act,\r\n\r\nand  the new section 4, as introduced by clause  3,\r\n\r\nis  more definite and provides that the court shall\r\n\r\norder  the forfeiture of the road vehicle if it  is\r\n\r\nproved that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) (i) that the vehicle was used in the\r\n\r\ncommission of a scheduled offence; or\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) that a scheduled offence has been committed in\r\n\r\nrespect of an article found in the vehicle or any\r\n\r\nperson found therein; or\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) that the vehicle has been used to convey\r\n\r\npersons to the scene where a scheduled offence has\r\n\r\nbeen committed or attempted to be committed; or\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) that the vehicle has been used for the escape\r\n\r\nor to facilitate the escape of any persons from the\r\n\r\nscene of a scheduled offence; and\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that the vehicle was seized by a police\r\n\r\nofficer; and\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) that written application has been made to\r\n\r\nthe  court by the State Advocate-General for its\r\n\r\nforfeiture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Once these three essentials, i.e. (a), (b) and (c),\r\n\r\nare  proved,  the  power  of  the  court  to  order\r\n\r\nforfeiture  is mandatory, notwithstanding  that  no\r\n\r\nperson  may  have been convicted of  any  scheduled\r\n\r\noffence.

As the power  to  make  these\r\n\r\nappointments is at present vested in the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara, it is necessary to refer constantly\r\n\r\nto  His  Excellency to approve these  appointments.\r\n\r\nThis  is  vexatious  to  His Excellency  since  the\r\n\r\nmatter  is  really  trifling.  Besides,  all  these\r\n\r\nappointments are purely administrative  in  nature,\r\n\r\nand  are  merely made so as to enable the  officers\r\n\r\nconcerned to carry out the statutory functions  and\r\n\r\npowers vested in the holders of these appointments;\r\n\r\nit  is  considered  that the  power  to  make  such\r\n\r\nappointments should be transferred to the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Mr Low Por Tuck].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TAN TOCK SENG'S HOSPITAL (TRANSFER) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.57 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish\r\n\r\nto inform you that His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's recommendation to with this Bill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since the 27th of August, 1880,\r\n\r\nthe    Tan   Tock   Seng's   Hospital,   originally\r\n\r\nestablished for the reception of diseased  paupers,\r\n\r\nhas been constituted a body corporate under the Tan\r\n\r\nTock  Seng's  Hospital Ordinance, Cap.  149,  by  a\r\n\r\ncommittee  of management consisting at  present  of\r\n\r\nthe  Director of Medical Services, a representative\r\n\r\nof  the Treasury, the Secretary for Social Welfare,\r\n\r\nthe   Assistant   Director  of   Medical   Services\r\n\r\n(Tuberculosis), the eldest male descendant  in  the\r\n\r\nmale  line  of the late Tan Tock Seng  residing  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  willing to serve,  and  five  other\r\n\r\npersons  chosen  by the remaining  members  of  the\r\n\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assets of the original foundation were in the\r\n\r\nform  of land given by two benevolent persons,  Mr\r\n\r\nTan  Tock Seng and Syed Aiwi. Government had  since\r\n\r\nacquired  more land and approved the use  of  Crown\r\n\r\nland  for  the  use of the Hospital.  Many  of  the\r\n\r\npresent buildings were erected at the cost  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Although it was intended  that  public\r\n\r\nsubscriptions  should provide much of  the  support\r\n\r\nfor the hospital, the only assistance that has been\r\n\r\ngiven  since the war is almost entirely limited  to\r\n\r\nthe  T.B. dispensary built within the hospital  by\r\n\r\nthe Rotary Club of Singapore.

Income  from  the\r\n\r\ncorporation's  property  is  minute.  All  hospital\r\n\r\nstaff  apart  from  600 odd hospital  servants  and\r\n\r\nsimilar  grades  employed by  the  corporation  was\r\n\r\nsupplied   by   the   Government.   This   included\r\n\r\nspecialists,  doctors and all  nursing  staff.  The\r\n\r\ncorporation,  therefore, has had  no  control  over\r\n\r\nstaff  other than the 600 persons mentioned.  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  Government  nominees  on  its  committee   of\r\n\r\nmanagement,  members  of  the  corporation  had  no\r\n\r\nspecial  qualifications for advising Government  on\r\n\r\nanti-T.B. measures or on the organisation  of  the\r\n\r\nhospital as a T.B. hospital for Singapore, which it\r\n\r\nhas now become.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the original benefactions and the\r\n\r\nlanded  property,  there  is  little  left  of  the\r\n\r\noriginal  trust. Government has in fact taken  over\r\n\r\nthis hospital in all but name. In view of this,  it\r\n\r\nis  considered that Government should legally  take\r\n\r\nover  the maintenance of the hospital and this Bill\r\n\r\nis  intended  to effect its transfer to Government.\r\n\r\nSince   Government   would  have   to   take   over\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for the 600 subordinate  staff,  at\r\n\r\npresent  employees  of  the Corporation,  the  only\r\n\r\nfinancial  commitment  will be  an  extra  annually\r\n\r\nrecurrent   expenditure   of   increased   retiring\r\n\r\nbenefits  under the Pensions Ordinance,  1956,  for\r\n\r\nwhich  these 600 employees will become eligible  on\r\n\r\ntransfer to Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anticipated increase in financial provision\r\n\r\nfor  1960  is, as explained at the end of the  Bill\r\n\r\nunder  \"Expenditure of Public Money\", approximately\r\n\r\n$10,700.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as, in your opinion, this is a\r\n\r\nhybrid  Bill because of clauses 2, 3, 4  and  6,  I\r\n\r\nshall  therefore at the end of the  Second  Reading\r\n\r\nmove  that  the  Bill  be  committed  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a\r\n\r\nsecond time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  as  I have stated, as you have ruled that  in\r\n\r\nyour  opinion  this  Bill  is  a  hybrid  Bill,   I\r\n\r\ntherefore move under Standing Order 65 (1),\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be referred to a Select Committee\r\n\r\nconsisting  of  Mr  Speaker as Chairman  and  such\r\n\r\nMembers  as  may be nominated by the  Committee  of\r\n\r\nSelection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be referred to a Select Committee\r\n\r\nconsisting  of  Mr  Speaker as Chairman  and  such\r\n\r\nMembers  as  may be nominated by the  Committee  of\r\n\r\nSelection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NATIONAL THEATRE TRUST BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

Its purpose was  two-fold.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  was to set up a permanent memorial  to  mark\r\n\r\nthe attainment of self -government by the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  second was to  make  the  National\r\n\r\nTheatre a symbol affirming our faith in our ability\r\n\r\nto  create  a Malayan nation and a Malayan  culture\r\n\r\nthrough united action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two ways in which the Government could\r\n\r\nhave approached this project. It could have adopted\r\n\r\nthe  old patriarchal approach. A benevolent and  an\r\n\r\nall-powerful government could have voted the  money\r\n\r\nnecessary for the project; it could have built  the\r\n\r\ntheatre  and  presented it to  the  people  as  yet\r\n\r\nanother  example of the omnipotence and benevolence\r\n\r\nof Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other way was to make the National Theatre an\r\n\r\nobject lesson in self-reliance and joint endeavour.\r\n\r\nSince  the  National Theatre was to be a symbol  of\r\n\r\nour  will  to be a nation, it was decided that  the\r\n\r\nNational  Theatre  should be the fruit  of  popular\r\n\r\nendeavour with Government and every stratum of  the\r\n\r\npopulation participating in it. It would not  be  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  theatre or a theatre built through  the\r\n\r\nefforts of this or that group, but of every section\r\n\r\nof the population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is what the National Theatre project has\r\n\r\nturned  out to be. Funds for it have come from  all\r\n\r\nclasses and all races. Cultural organisations  from\r\n\r\nall races have organised concerts and shows to add,\r\n\r\nlittle  by little, to the fund. So have many  civic\r\n\r\nand  sports organisations. So have trade unions and\r\n\r\npolitical  parties and business concerns.  So  have\r\n\r\nthousands of individuals ranging from the  well-to-do to farmers, hawkers and to school children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, over $600,000 have been contributed by\r\n\r\nthe  public,  and though nearly a year has  passed,\r\n\r\nmany  organisations and groups still have plans  to\r\n\r\nput up shows and activities to increase the fund. I\r\n\r\nshould  like to take this opportunity to thank  all\r\n\r\nthose who have spent so much time, energy and money\r\n\r\nto augment the National Theatre Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill to set up a National Theatre Trust\r\n\r\nseeks  to ensure that the management of the Theatre\r\n\r\nremains a public affair too. Right from the  start,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  set  up a representative  National\r\n\r\nTheatre  Fund Committee to be in charge of  getting\r\n\r\nfunds  for the Theatre. It included representatives\r\n\r\nof  the  Press  unions, cultural organisations  and\r\n\r\nbusinessmen,  and  though  their  work   has   been\r\n\r\nsustained and time-consuming, their enthusiasm  has\r\n\r\nnot waned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that plans have been approved for the Theatre\r\n\r\nand  an  architect appointed, the time has come  to\r\n\r\ncreate a proper machinery for the administration of\r\n\r\nthe  Theatre. In appointing members to  the  Board,\r\n\r\nthe Government will bear in mind the principle that\r\n\r\nwhat has been paid for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the  public should also be administered by  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also those appointed to the Board will be people\r\n\r\nwho  can  administer the Theatre properly  for  the\r\n\r\nends  for  which  it  was  designed,  that  is,  to\r\n\r\nstimulate  the  growth  and  appreciation  of  art,\r\n\r\nmusic,  and  drama, and through these to  foster  a\r\n\r\nMalayan culture and a Malayan identity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first job of the Board will be to take over\r\n\r\nthe  Fund which is now held by Government in  trust\r\n\r\nfor  the  public and use it in such manner as  they\r\n\r\ndeem  fit  in accordance with the objects specified\r\n\r\nin  clause  6  of  the Bill. When  the  Theatre  is\r\n\r\ncompleted,  it  will be the duty of  the  Board  to\r\n\r\nmanage it, consistent with the objects for which it\r\n\r\nwas built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the time is ripe, it is hoped that all other\r\n\r\ntheatrical  institutions now under the  control  of\r\n\r\nthe Government will also be passed on to the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9 and 10 of the Bill provide for the\r\n\r\npresentation  of  the  Board's  annual  report  and\r\n\r\nstatement of accounts to the Assembly so that  this\r\n\r\nHouse is kept informed of the Board's activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential thing to bear in mind about the\r\n\r\nNational Theatre is that it is proof that people of\r\n\r\ndiverse races, creeds and classes can work together\r\n\r\non  their  own  for  the realisation  of  a  common\r\n\r\nobjective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it is only in common endeavours of this kind\r\n\r\nthat we learn that diversity of race, language  and\r\n\r\nreligion  are barriers only in the warped minds  of\r\n\r\ncommunal demagogues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Mr Rajaratnam].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PENSIONS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(VALIDATION OF PAYMENTS)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.13 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> May I interrupt at this\r\n\r\njuncture  to signify that I have the recommendation\r\n\r\nof  His  Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  to\r\n\r\nproceed with this Bill?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg\r\n\r\nto move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to fill a deficiency in the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Pensions Ordinance. This  relates\r\n\r\nto  pensions, gratuities and allowances awarded  to\r\n\r\nofficers  who  have had service with the  Board  of\r\n\r\nCommissioners of Currency as well as  service  with\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pensions Ordinance provides for the payment\r\n\r\nof  pensions, gratuities and allowances in  respect\r\n\r\nof Government service and other services which have\r\n\r\nbeen  accepted as service counting for  a  pension.\r\n\r\nService with the Board of Commissioners of Currency\r\n\r\nis   neither  Government  service,  nor  any  other\r\n\r\nservice counting for a pension. Therefore, strictly\r\n\r\nspeaking, no pension, gratuity or allowance  should\r\n\r\nhave been paid in respect of this service. However,\r\n\r\nin  an  administrative action taken as long ago  as\r\n\r\nJuly  1931,  persons  with service  both  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the  Board  of  Commissioners   of\r\n\r\nCurrency  have  been paid pensions, gratuities  and\r\n\r\nannual allowances as if service with the Board  was\r\n\r\nreckonable for a pension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of persons who were awarded a pension or\r\n\r\nannual  allowance in respect of their service  with\r\n\r\nthe Board have since died, but there are at present\r\n\r\na small number of such persons to whom a pension or\r\n\r\nannual  allowance  continues  to  be  paid.  It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  necessary  to validate  the  payment  of\r\n\r\nthese pensions, gratuities and allowances, if  this\r\n\r\nsmall  number of pensioners are to continue  to  be\r\n\r\npaid their pension or annual allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an amendment to the Bill and I will move\r\n\r\nthis  amendment at the Committee stage.

Those\r\n\r\nunder  restriction  are for  reasons  of  security,\r\n\r\nhealth,  exchange  control and  protection  of  our\r\n\r\nlocal  industries. Export controls  are  also  very\r\n\r\nfew.  We  must, however, retain the powers to  meet\r\n\r\nour international obligations to control the export\r\n\r\nof goods of strategic importance, in the event of a\r\n\r\nsudden  shortage of certain goods, it is  necessary\r\n\r\nin  the interests of the State to retain powers  to\r\n\r\nrestrict exports of such goods. The current  export\r\n\r\nprocedures also afford facilities for ensuring that\r\n\r\nall export regulations are complied with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with subsection\r\n\r\n(2)  of  section  1 of the Control of  Imports  and\r\n\r\nExports Ordinance (Chapter 214), resolves that  the\r\n\r\naforesaid Ordinance shall continue in force  for  a\r\n\r\nfurther  period of one year commencing on  the  8th\r\n\r\nday of December, 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.22 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>A NATIONAL UNION FOR WORKERS IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\none  of  the  early declarations of policy  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is the encouragement of the formation of\r\n\r\nnational unions of workers. The Opposition does not\r\n\r\nfind fault with this policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\nIn  fact, the Opposition supports and welcomes this\r\n\r\npolicy. But then, Sir, the declaration of a  policy\r\n\r\nis  one thing, and the method employed to implement\r\n\r\nthat  policy  is  quite another  thing.  I  do  not\r\n\r\npropose now, Sir, to go into details the many  acts\r\n\r\nof   suggestive  intimidation  and  of   the   many\r\n\r\nmanipulations  that  are  being  practised  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. trade union leaders in an endeavour to  win\r\n\r\nover uncommitted unions and organised workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I wish to speak on a national union for\r\n\r\nworkers  in the petroleum industry. I want to  make\r\n\r\nit  clear that I am not speaking as adviser to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Petroleum Workers Union, but that  I  am\r\n\r\nspeaking  today  as  a  trade  unionist.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\ndistribution  of  oil  has been  classified  as  an\r\n\r\nessential service under the Criminal Law (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions) Ordinance. It is, therefore, imperative\r\n\r\nthat  everything must be done to  see  to  it  that\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace and justice are not  upset  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of irresponsible activities on the part  of\r\n\r\nemployers and unions alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Government came into power in June\r\n\r\n1959,  there  were in existence four  trade  unions\r\n\r\nrepresenting workers in the petroleum industry. The\r\n\r\nSingapore  Petroleum  Workers  Union,  the   oldest\r\n\r\nunion,  was registered in 1952. The Shell Employees\r\n\r\nUnion,  the Stanvac Employees Union and the  Caltex\r\n\r\nEmployees  Union  came  into  being  in  succeeding\r\n\r\nyears.  To strengthen themselves, these four unions\r\n\r\nformed  into a Federation of Oil Workers Unions  in\r\n\r\n1958.  Hon.  Members will recollect that  with  the\r\n\r\nformation  of this Federation, there  was  a  joint\r\n\r\ndemand on the oil companies for recognition and for\r\n\r\na bonus. And if I remember rightly, the advisers to\r\n\r\nthis  Federation  at that time were  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister and the Minister for Labour and Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the Government had made known its\r\n\r\npolicy  on  national  unions, the  Shell  Employees\r\n\r\nUnion,  the Caltex Employees Union and the  Stanvac\r\n\r\nEmployees Union held several meetings with  a  view\r\n\r\nto  the  formation  of a national  union.  It  was\r\n\r\nbecause   of  the  deliberate  exclusion   of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Petroleum Workers Union, which was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen and still is the oldest registered union, that\r\n\r\nthese  discussions did not result in the  formation\r\n\r\nof  a  truly  national union for oil  workers.  The\r\n\r\nShell  Employees  Union and  the  Caltex  Employees\r\n\r\nUnion  became amalgamated into a National Union  of\r\n\r\nOil  Workers. The Stanvac Employees Union, however,\r\n\r\npulled out of the discussions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the N.U.O.W., which is led by P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers, was registered on the 27th January,  1960.\r\n\r\nAnd  consequent upon this registration, the Stanvac\r\n\r\nEmployees  Union was notified by the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nTrade  Unions  that it would be deregistered.  This\r\n\r\nwas  obviously, Sir, due to the Government  playing\r\n\r\npolitics  in this particular field. If the  Stanvac\r\n\r\nEmployees  Union had toed the line  and  agreed  to\r\n\r\nbecome  absorbed  into the National  Union  of  Oil\r\n\r\nWorkers, then the Singapore Petroleum Workers Union\r\n\r\nwould  have been deregistered for the same  obvious\r\n\r\nreason. Sir, because of the registration in January\r\n\r\n1960 of the P.A.P.-controlled N.U.O.W., because  of\r\n\r\nthe  deregistration of the Stanvac Employees  Union\r\n\r\nwhich  refused to become absorbed into the NU.O.W.,\r\n\r\nand   because  of  the  P.A.P.-controlled  T.U.C.'s\r\n\r\nacceptance  of affiliation of the newly  registered\r\n\r\nP.A.P.-controlled  N.U.O.W. and their  unjustified\r\n\r\nnon-acceptance  of  affiliation  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPetroleum  Workers Union, which was  registered  in\r\n\r\n1952, it became obvious to people outside that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. was   playing  party  politics   in   this\r\n\r\nparticular sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was also inevitable that there would be\r\n\r\ntrade union rivalry in the petroleum industry. As a\r\n\r\ntrade unionist, I could see that this rivalry would\r\n\r\nbe to the detriment of the workers in the industry.\r\n\r\nSo  when I was approached in February this year  by\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Petroleum Workers Union  to  be  its\r\n\r\nhonorary adviser, I accepted the appointment on one\r\n\r\ncondition:  that the S.P.W.U. agreed to empower  me\r\n\r\nto  see  the  Minister for Labour and Law  to  take\r\n\r\nsteps  towards  the formation of a  truly  national\r\n\r\nunion  of oil workers. With this authority, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nsaw the Minister for Labour and Law and offered\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy  services to bring unity among the oil  workers.\r\n\r\nUnder  the chairmanship of the Minister, Sir, there\r\n\r\nwas  a meeting with representatives of the N.U.O.W.\r\n\r\nand  the  Secretary-General of the T.U.C.  At  this\r\n\r\nmeeting  I  put up my suggestions for the formation\r\n\r\nof  a truly national union of oil workers and I was\r\n\r\ntold  that I would be informed at a later  date  of\r\n\r\nthe  views  of  the  N.U.O.W. No  such  information\r\n\r\nmaterialised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, rival union activities intensified. The\r\n\r\nleaders  of  the  P  A.P.-controlled  N.U.O.W. in\r\n\r\ncampaigning for members made full and free  use  of\r\n\r\nthe   Minister's  name.  They  intimated  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister had told them that he would deregister the\r\n\r\nS.P.W.U. So why join the S.P.W.U. which had  earned\r\n\r\nthe displeasure of the Minister? The S.P.W.U. then,\r\n\r\nin  an attempt to resolve this issue, requested the\r\n\r\noil  companies to conduct a secret ballot among the\r\n\r\nemployees  to  ascertain which union the  employees\r\n\r\nwould  wish to have to represent them. The N.U.O.W.\r\n\r\nobjected  to  this and intimated  that  the  proper\r\n\r\nthing  to do was to conduct an industry-wide secret\r\n\r\nballot  of all direct employees to ascertain  which\r\n\r\nunion  should be the union to survive to  represent\r\n\r\nthe  workers in the petroleum industry. Because  of\r\n\r\nthe  intimation of the N.U.O.W., the S.P.W.U. then\r\n\r\nrequested  the  Minister  for  Labour  and  Law  to\r\n\r\nconduct such an industry-wide secret ballot of  all\r\n\r\ndirect employees. This request, Sir, did not elicit\r\n\r\nany  reply  from  the Minister for some  time.  The\r\n\r\nS.P.W.U. then  called  a  general   meeting   and\r\n\r\nexplained  the  situation to its members.  At  this\r\n\r\nparticular meeting it was unanimously resolved that\r\n\r\nstrike   notices  should  be  issued  to  the   oil\r\n\r\ncompanies to gain recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of these strike notices coincided\r\n\r\nwith the sending of a letter by the Minister to the\r\n\r\nS.P.W.U. inviting them to send representatives to a\r\n\r\nmeeting  together  with  representatives   of   the\r\n\r\nN.U.O.W. and of the oil companies to  discuss  the\r\n\r\narrangement for conducting an industry-wide  secret\r\n\r\nballot of all direct employees. Press reports, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  this connection indicated that the Minister was\r\n\r\nvery,  very  angry  indeed with  the  S.P.W.U. for\r\n\r\nhaving sent strike\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnotices,  and  it was also indicated in  the  Press\r\n\r\nthat the Minister threatened to take action against\r\n\r\nthe  S.P.W.U. unless  the  S.P.W.U. withdrew  the\r\n\r\nstrike notices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this meeting arranged by the Minister duly\r\n\r\ntook  place in the Ministry under his chairmanship.\r\n\r\nAt  this meeting the Minister quite rightly pointed\r\n\r\nout  to  the  representatives of the S.P.W.U. that\r\n\r\nthere could be no discussion on the arrangement for\r\n\r\nconducting  an industry-wide secret ballot  of  all\r\n\r\ndirect  employees unless the S.P.W.U. withdrew  the\r\n\r\nstrike   notices.   The  representatives   of   the\r\n\r\nS.P.W.U.,    in    order   to    discharge    their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  to their members,  elicited  from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  that  the strike  notices  were  not\r\n\r\ncontrary  to the laws of the State and that  should\r\n\r\nan  industry-wide  secret ballot  take  place,  the\r\n\r\nunion   winning  the  ballot  would  survive.   The\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the S.P.W.U. told  the  Minister\r\n\r\nthat  they  had  no  power to withdraw  the  strike\r\n\r\nnotices  but that they would go back to the general\r\n\r\nbody and advise them of the wishes of the Minister.\r\n\r\nThe meeting then terminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.P.W.U., Sir, issued a circular to their\r\n\r\nmembers  calling  them  to a  general  meeting  and\r\n\r\ninforming them of what took place at the meeting in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Labour and  Law.  This  circular\r\n\r\ntelling  the facts obviously got under the skin  or\r\n\r\nthe  Minister and he rushed to the Press and denied\r\n\r\nthat  he ever gave an assurance at that meeting  to\r\n\r\nthe representatives of the S.P.W.U. that should  an\r\n\r\nindustry-wide  secret ballot take place  the  union\r\n\r\nwinning  the  ballot would survive. As  was  to  be\r\n\r\nexpected, Sir, this caused great resentment in  the\r\n\r\nminds  of the members of the S.P.W.U. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nwas  asked to attend their general meeting  because\r\n\r\nit  was  felt that the meeting might become  highly\r\n\r\ncritical  of this kind of double talk. I  therefore\r\n\r\nattended  the  meeting. And I must say,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthat  meeting  was very, very firm in its  feelings\r\n\r\nagainst the Minister for denying what they believed\r\n\r\ntheir  representatives had  told  them  the  truth.\r\n\r\nThere  was  strong talk of not wanting to  withdraw\r\n\r\nthe  strike notices. Sir, I was able to pacify  the\r\n\r\nmeeting.  I explained to them that they should  not\r\n\r\ntake  heed of any kind of double talk that had been\r\n\r\ngoing on; that if any industry-wide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecret  ballot  were  to take place,  it  would  be\r\n\r\nridiculous and foolish on the part of the Government\r\n\r\nto  ignore the union that came out successful in  a\r\n\r\nballot conducted by the Government. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nmeeting  should take no heed of whether or not  the\r\n\r\nMinister  did or did not give an assurance.  I  was\r\n\r\nalso able, Sir, to persuade the meeting to withdraw\r\n\r\nthe  strike  notices, because I explained  to  them\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  a proper thing to do;  that  if  the\r\n\r\ndiscussions  at the Labour Ministry  with  all  the\r\n\r\nparties  concerned  were  to  be  conducted  in  an\r\n\r\natmosphere  of  cordiality  and  in  a  spirit   of\r\n\r\ngoodwill,   then  the  strike  notices  should   be\r\n\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some spies of the Minister rushed to him and\r\n\r\nmisinformed  him  of  my  speech  at  that  general\r\n\r\nmeeting.  And behaving in a manner that is  typical\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister, he rushed into press and accused\r\n\r\nme  of  saying  things  that  I  did  not  say  and\r\n\r\nthreatened a probe into my alleged utterances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a probe in this particular context can only\r\n\r\nmean one thing - a form of suggestive intimidation. I\r\n\r\nread  this  Press report when I was in Brunei.  The\r\n\r\nHon, the  Prime Minister was also there  attending\r\n\r\nthe Sultan's birthday celebrations. And believe me,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  had a good laugh about how silly a  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinister  could  be. Sir, this kind  of  suggestive\r\n\r\nintimidation is really typical of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Law. The public has not yet  forgotten\r\n\r\nthe  threat  that he issued against an employer - the\r\n\r\nthreat of using the Preservation of Public Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance  on an employer. The public has  not  yet\r\n\r\nforgotten that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even if I had, as misreported by the spies\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister,  said the  things  that  it  was\r\n\r\nalleged  that  I had said, surely  it  was  in  the\r\n\r\nexercise  of  my democratic rights; or  are  we  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  that under the P.A.P. Government  there\r\n\r\nis  now no longer freedom of speech as there is now\r\n\r\nno  longer  freedom of the Press as stated  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the meeting then agreed to withdraw the\r\n\r\nstrike  notices, and so the representatives of  the\r\n\r\nS.P.W.U. attended another meeting  at  the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt  this meeting the N.U.O.W. turned about face and\r\n\r\ndid not agree to an industry-wide secret ballot  of\r\n\r\nall direct employees although it was their original\r\n\r\ndemand.  And  they then insisted  that  the  secret\r\n\r\nballot  should only be confined to members  of  the\r\n\r\nunions. Sir, if the Minister for Labour and Law had\r\n\r\nreally been impartial, he would have insisted  that\r\n\r\nthe  N.U.O.W. stick to their original  demand.  But\r\n\r\nthen,  Sir,  could one expect a P.A.P. Minister  to\r\n\r\nrender a slap to a P.A.P.-controlled union? So  the\r\n\r\nsecond meeting was again abortive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third meeting took place again on the 11th of\r\n\r\nOctober. Nothing came out of it. But it was left to\r\n\r\nthe two unions to talk among themselves and find  a\r\n\r\nway out of this difficulty. The S.P.W.U. then wrote\r\n\r\na  letter  after  this  meeting  to  the  N.U.O.W.,\r\n\r\ninviting  them  to  a meeting to discuss  ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans to resolve their differences and form a truly\r\n\r\nnational union for oil workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while this correspondence was going on as to\r\n\r\nwhen,  where  and  how such a meeting  should  take\r\n\r\nplace,  the Justice Chua Court of Inquiry submitted\r\n\r\nits report to the Minister for Labour and Law. This\r\n\r\nreport had been given publicity in the Press. Among\r\n\r\nother things, the Court recommended that to put  an\r\n\r\nend  to  this union rivalry it was imperative  that\r\n\r\none national union be created. The Court also found\r\n\r\nthat  the action taken by the N.U.O.W. was a strike\r\n\r\nwithin the meaning of the laws of the State. As the\r\n\r\nN.U.O.W. had not complied with the law by giving  a\r\n\r\n14-day  strike  notice, the N.U.O.W. had  therefore\r\n\r\nindulged  in  an illegal strike. The union  leaders\r\n\r\nand   the   N.U.O.W. are  therefore   liable   to\r\n\r\nprosecution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the report of the Justice Chua Court of\r\n\r\nInquiry  came  out  in the Press  on  the  24th  of\r\n\r\nOctober.  The  S.P.W.U. submitted  demands  to  the\r\n\r\nthree  oil  companies  for  better  conditions   of\r\n\r\nemployment  and these demands were given prominence\r\n\r\nin the Press on the 25th of October. On the 26th of\r\n\r\nOctober - just a big knife. The union was told by the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Trade Unions that the Registrar  was\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that this union should be  deregistered.\r\n\r\nBoth unions were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  told  by the Registrar of Trade  Unions  that\r\n\r\nthey would be deregistered. Sir, the action against\r\n\r\nthe N.U.O.W. was called for because of the findings\r\n\r\nof  the Justice Chua Court of Inquiry. The N.U.O.W.\r\n\r\nhad  indulged in an illegal strike. The leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe   N.U.O.W. had  behaved  in  an  irresponsible\r\n\r\nmanner.  Therefore,  it was quite  right  that  the\r\n\r\nunion should be deregistered. But why penalise  the\r\n\r\nS.  P.W.U. also for an act committed  by  a  rival\r\n\r\nunion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the notice issued by the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Trade Unions, the  ground  for  such\r\n\r\nproposed  cancellation was that \"the  Registrar  is\r\n\r\nsatisfied that the trade union is likely to be used\r\n\r\nagainst  the  interest of workmen in the  petroleum\r\n\r\nindustry.\" Let us take note of the operative  words\r\n\r\n\"the trade union is likely to be used\" and not \"the\r\n\r\ntrade union has been used\" against the interest  of\r\n\r\nworkmen  in  the  petroleum industry.  Sir,  is  it\r\n\r\nagainst  the interest of workmen for the  union  to\r\n\r\nsubmit   demands  on  the  employers  for  improved\r\n\r\nconditions  of  employment? Or is  it  because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is very anxious to protect the  interest\r\n\r\nof  employers,  and that is why the R.T.U. had  to\r\n\r\nclamp  down on the trade union which had  submitted\r\n\r\ndemands to the employers for improved conditions of\r\n\r\nemployment?  Sir, if the Registrar of Trade  Unions\r\n\r\nhad not taken that action against the S.P.W.U., the\r\n\r\nunion  and  the  employers today would  be  sitting\r\n\r\nround  a table negotiating for a new wage agreement\r\n\r\nfor  workmen in the petroleum industry and  certain\r\n\r\nbenefits  were bound to accrue. And yet the  ground\r\n\r\nfor  the  cancellation of registration is that  the\r\n\r\nunion is likely to be used against the interest  of\r\n\r\nworkmen in the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the general election, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\npromised  that it would help to raise the  standard\r\n\r\nof living and help to improve the conditions of the\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the State. I do not want  to  suggest,\r\n\r\nSir, that the P.A.P. has forgotten its promise, but\r\n\r\nif  it  has not forgotten its promise, how  can  we\r\n\r\nreconcile  this  with the fact that the  Government\r\n\r\nhad  to  close down the union one day after it  had\r\n\r\nsent  in  a  demand  for  improved  conditions   of\r\n\r\nemployment for workmen in the State of Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the N.U.O.W. have accepted the justification\r\n\r\nfor  the deregistration. Obviously, they could  not\r\n\r\nprotest  because they were in the  wrong;  but  the\r\n\r\nS.P.W.U. have  strongly  protested  against   this\r\n\r\nunjustifiable  action. They claim that  it  is  not\r\n\r\nfair  and justifiable on the part of the Government\r\n\r\nto punish them for an irresponsible act perpetrated\r\n\r\nby  a  P.A.P.-controlled union. They say that  they\r\n\r\nshould not be punished for what they did not do.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to know what the Government proposes to\r\n\r\ndo about this. It is not right and proper that this\r\n\r\nunion  should be deregistered. But then  again  one\r\n\r\ncan   ask  the  question,  \"Will  this  solve   the\r\n\r\nsituation in the petroleum industry?\" But  I,  Sir,\r\n\r\nknow the leadership of the S.P.W.U. quite well, and\r\n\r\nI can say this, that this leadership is prepared to\r\n\r\nreorganise  the union and bring in the  leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe  N.U.O.W. to  form a truly national  union  of\r\n\r\npetroleum workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  when the Member for Cairnhill gave notice  of\r\n\r\nhis  proposed adjournment speech under the  heading\r\n\r\nof  \"A  National Union for Workers in the Petroleum\r\n\r\nIndustry\", I was under the impression that  he  was\r\n\r\ngoing  to  entertain  the  House  with  his  expert\r\n\r\nexperience  as the former Minister for  Labour  and\r\n\r\nWelfare, but instead he proclaims himself to  be  a\r\n\r\ntrade unionist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the object of the hon. Member's\r\n\r\nadjournment  speech is to find a way to  solve  the\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction  of the workers  in  the  petroleum\r\n\r\nindustry. After hearing his speech, I rise, as  the\r\n\r\nacting Minister for Labour and Law, to speak on the\r\n\r\nfundamental issues, but I shall not talk at  length\r\n\r\nby  going into the details of the negotiations  for\r\n\r\nwhich the Government provided the facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, I would like to state that\r\n\r\nthe union that the Member for Cairnhill alleges  to\r\n\r\nhave been in existence since 1952 was not known  as\r\n\r\nthe  S.P.W.U.  It was not until the end  of  August\r\n\r\n1955  that  that union changed its name and  called\r\n\r\nitself  the  S.P.W.U.  By  that  time,  there  were\r\n\r\nalready  on the register the Shell Employees  Union\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Stanvac Employees Union, the membership of each\r\n\r\nof  which was open to workers in the respective oil\r\n\r\ncompany. Besides, the Caltex Employees Union, which\r\n\r\nwas registered in October 1955, was actually in the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  organisation  by  then.  Moreover,  not\r\n\r\nwithstanding  the assumption of its new  name,  the\r\n\r\nrules  of the S.P.W.U. remained confined to workers\r\n\r\nemployed  by  oil-dealers  and  were  not  open  to\r\n\r\nworkers employed by oil companies until the end  of\r\n\r\nNovember 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above facts show clearly that it is not at\r\n\r\nall  correct to say that the S.P.W.U. is the oldest\r\n\r\nunion catering for workers in the oil industry  and\r\n\r\nthat  the  other  unions in the  oil  industry  are\r\n\r\nsplinter unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has said that the\r\n\r\nGovernment has deviated from its declared policy of\r\n\r\nbringing  about  unity among  the  workers  by  the\r\n\r\nformation of one union for each industry instead of\r\n\r\nhaving splinter or yellow unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me give some facts about the emergence of\r\n\r\nthe  N.U.O.W. About six months after the assumption\r\n\r\nof  office  of the P.A.P. Government in June  1959,\r\n\r\nthe  N.U.O.W. applied for registration  as  a  new\r\n\r\nunion. There were then already on the register, the\r\n\r\nS.P.W.U.,  the Shell Employees Union,  the  Stanvac\r\n\r\nEmployees Union and the Caltex Employees Union. The\r\n\r\napplication was forthwith refused by the  Registrar\r\n\r\non  the ground that the Trade Unions Ordinance  had\r\n\r\nalready  been  amended to empower the Registrar  to\r\n\r\nrefuse  registration  of any  splinter  union.  The\r\n\r\napplicants  accordingly withdrew their application.\r\n\r\nIs  there then any truth in the allegation that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government was encouraging the formation  of\r\n\r\nany splinter union?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of January 1960, the Shell Employees\r\n\r\nUnion  and  the Caltex Employees Union  effected  a\r\n\r\nvoluntary  amalgamation and adopted  the  title  of\r\n\r\n\"N.U.O.W.\"   with  new  rules  which   opened   its\r\n\r\nmembership to all workers in the oil industry.  The\r\n\r\nRegistrar   had   no  power  to  refuse   such   an\r\n\r\namalgamation,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich was accordingly registered. This was how  the\r\n\r\nN.U.O.W. came into existence. The registration  of\r\n\r\nthis amalgamation was, in fact, the marriage of two\r\n\r\nunions,  one  of  which was registered  before  the\r\n\r\nS.P.W.U. came into being under that title, and  the\r\n\r\nother one before the S.P.W.U. amended its rules  to\r\n\r\naccept employees in oil companies as its members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I was not present during the\r\n\r\nnegotiations  which were held in  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour, I feel that I am not in a position to state\r\n\r\nexactly  what  transpired at  those  meetings.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment has no intention of backing the N.U.O.W.\r\n\r\nat the expense of the S.P.W.U.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this matter dragged on until\r\n\r\n21st  October, 1960, when the Court of Inquiry  was\r\n\r\nappointed   under   the  then   Industrial   Courts\r\n\r\nOrdinance (Chapter 151) to inquire into the  causes\r\n\r\nand   circumstances  of  the  dispute  between  the\r\n\r\nStandard-Vacuum  Oil  Company  and  the   N.U.O.W.,\r\n\r\nresulting  in  the  dismissal of an  employee.  The\r\n\r\nCourt submitted its Report and recommended, amongst\r\n\r\nother   things,  the  formation  at  the   earliest\r\n\r\npossible  moment  of  one  single  union  for   all\r\n\r\nemployees  in  the oil industry, because  otherwise\r\n\r\nthe increasing rivalry between the unions might, in\r\n\r\nthe  opinion of the Court, lead to other larger and\r\n\r\neven more serious incidents than the one which  the\r\n\r\nCourt inquired into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. Kandasamy (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the Member for Cairnhill prefaced his speech\r\n\r\nwith  the  remark  that  he supported  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy  of  unification  of  trade  unions.  If  he\r\n\r\nsupports that policy, then he must realise that the\r\n\r\nunification   of   trade   unions - amalgamation   or\r\n\r\nfederation  in  the  initial stages - can  only  take\r\n\r\nplace  with  the  ultimate aim of amalgamating  the\r\n\r\nseveral  unions that are in the same industry.  The\r\n\r\ntrade  unions have generally accepted  this  policy\r\n\r\nand have, since June 1959, worked towards achieving\r\n\r\nunification. It is in this spirit that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanvac Employees Union, the Shell Employees  Union\r\n\r\nand  the  Caltex  Employees Union  amalgamated  and\r\n\r\nformed  the National Union of Oil Workers.  At  the\r\n\r\ntime the amalgamation was made and registered,  the\r\n\r\nthree  unions  were  affiliates  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTrades  Union  Congress. It is the normal  practice\r\n\r\nthat where three unions have been affiliates of the\r\n\r\nCongress and have since amalgamated, the new  union\r\n\r\nthat  has  been  registered  is  considered  as  an\r\n\r\naffiliate in place of the names of the three unions\r\n\r\nwhich  will  be  deleted from the  records  of  the\r\n\r\nCongress. The National Union of Oil Workers became\r\n\r\nan  affiliate of the T.U.C. I must inform the House\r\n\r\nthat  before  the amalgamation, those three  unions\r\n\r\nwere  affiliated to the T.U.C. as far back as 1958.\r\n\r\nIn 1958, the Trades Union Congress did make efforts\r\n\r\nto  bring in the Singapore Petroleum Workers  Union\r\n\r\nas  well.  At  that time, the S.P.W.U. refused  to\r\n\r\naffiliate  with  the T.U.C. It was only  after  the\r\n\r\nNational  Union of Oil Workers became an  affiliate\r\n\r\nof the T.U.C. that the S.P.W.U. wished to become an\r\n\r\naffiliate  of the T.U.C. It was at this, time  that\r\n\r\nthe  dispute  between the two  unions  reached  the\r\n\r\nstage  where  all  parties, the  Minister  and  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C.,  were very concerned that this dispute,  or\r\n\r\ninter-union  rivalry for members might  develop  to\r\n\r\nthe  extent  that it might harm union  relationship\r\n\r\nand  might  discourage members  from  remaining  in\r\n\r\nunions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The T.U.C. made a conscious effort to bring about\r\n\r\namalgamation at the last meeting that was  held  in\r\n\r\nthe  Minister's office. That meeting was  attended\r\n\r\nby  the  S.P.W.U. representatives, the N.U.O.W.\r\n\r\nrepresentatives and the T.U.C. representatives. The\r\n\r\nobject of the meeting was to find ways and means of\r\n\r\nunifying  these  two  unions. Both  unions  adopted\r\n\r\ndifferent  approaches, and after  some  discussion,\r\n\r\nthe  Vice-President of the S.P.W.U. himself made  a\r\n\r\nproposal  that a selected number of representatives\r\n\r\nfrom the two unions should hold meetings to draft a\r\n\r\nnew  constitution  for  a  new  single  union.  The\r\n\r\nproposal  was a sound one and the Minister accepted\r\n\r\nit. The T.U.C. also accepted it. What\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhappened   was   that  a  paid   officer   of   the\r\n\r\nS.P.W.U. - one  might call him a paid clerk,  not  an\r\n\r\nexecutive  officer  of  the  union,  but   a   paid\r\n\r\nclerk - protested     against     this      proposal.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,   the   T.U.C. and   the   Minister\r\n\r\nrecommended  this proposal submitted by  the  Vice-President of the S.P.W.U., and asked the two unions\r\n\r\nto  consider  it. Two days later, we  read  in  the\r\n\r\npapers that the Vice-President of the S.P.W.U. had\r\n\r\nbeen  expelled  from  the unions.  After  that  the\r\n\r\nS.P.W.U. invited the N.U.O.W. to a meeting at their\r\n\r\nheadquarters.  The  N.U.O.W. did  not  reject  the\r\n\r\ninvitation.  They accepted it, but suggested  that.\r\n\r\nas  a  result of the inter-union rivalry, feelings\r\n\r\nhad  become so bad that it was better to  have  the\r\n\r\nmeeting in a neutral place. And the venue suggested\r\n\r\nwas the T.U.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is not neutral!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kandasamy:</b> The S.P.W.U. later suggested the\r\n\r\nY.M.C.A.  Probably they thought  the  Y.M.C.A. was\r\n\r\nneutral.  The  N.U.O.W. accepted the proposal.  But\r\n\r\njust two hours before the meeting was scheduled  to\r\n\r\nbe held, the S.P.W.U. again cancelled it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Cairnhill can have only one\r\n\r\nmotive  for bringing up this question here, because\r\n\r\nI am sure, as the honorary adviser to the S.P.W.U.,\r\n\r\nhe  is  well  aware that meetings have been  taking\r\n\r\nplace;  that  five representatives of the  S.P.W.U.\r\n\r\nand  five representatives of the N.U.O.W. have been\r\n\r\nmeeting   on   several   occasions   to   draft   a\r\n\r\nconstitution.  And if we have the interest  of  the\r\n\r\nunions  at heart, and if we believe that these  two\r\n\r\nunions  should unite and that there should  be  one\r\n\r\nand  only one union for the oil workers in the  oil\r\n\r\nindustry,  as recommended by Justice  Chua  at  the\r\n\r\nCourt of Inquiry, then we should work towards that.\r\n\r\nBut the speech of the Member for Cairnhill makes it\r\n\r\nquite clear that it is not his intention that  this\r\n\r\nmeeting should be a success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trades Union Congress, Sir, have made it very\r\n\r\nclear  to  the representatives of the S.P.W.U. and\r\n\r\nthe N.U.O.W. that the best thing that can happen in\r\n\r\nthis situation is for the two unions to agree\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nupon  a  constitution,  and having  agreed  upon  a\r\n\r\nconstitution, then let the members elect whom  they\r\n\r\nwant  as their leaders. But not so the S.P.W.U.  As\r\n\r\nthe Member for Cairnhill himself remarked just now,\r\n\r\nthe  S.P.W.U. made this grand gesture,  \"Come  and\r\n\r\njoin  the  S.P.W.U.  As for the  leaders,  we  will\r\n\r\narrange  that. We will fix that.\" If  this  is  the\r\n\r\nattitude  of  the  S.P.W.U. as  regards  arranging\r\n\r\nleaders  and  fixing leaders, then the trade  union\r\n\r\nwill not be a trade union, but it will be a company-controlled  union. I am surprised,  Sir,  that  the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Cairnhill,  who  spoke  as  a   trade\r\n\r\nunionist,  should at this juncture, when one  might\r\n\r\ncall  it \"peace talks\" are being carried out,  when\r\n\r\nthere is a possibility that a new constitution will\r\n\r\nbe  adopted, when there is a possibility that these\r\n\r\ntwo unions will come together, make this, one might\r\n\r\nsay, deliberate attempt to keep them apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's order to cancel the registration\r\n\r\nof  the  two unions was no doubt motivated  by  the\r\n\r\nrecommendation of the Court of Inquiry to have  one\r\n\r\nsingle union. In order to achieve one single union,\r\n\r\nnotices  went  out  that the  registration  of  two\r\n\r\nunions   should   be  cancelled,  and   after   the\r\n\r\ncancellation,  a  single union should  be  created.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no suggestion, either in the  T.U.C. or\r\n\r\nanywhere  else, as to what type of union should  be\r\n\r\ncreated  or  who  should be its  leaders.  What  is\r\n\r\nimportant is that there should be one single  union\r\n\r\nin the oil industry for the oil workers and managed\r\n\r\nby the oil workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Tun Lim, is it a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> No, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is no right of reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Ten minutes past Five o'clock to Tuesday, 29th November, 1960.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADDENDA</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>VACANT POSTS IN GOVERNMENT SERVICE HELD BY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>OFFICERS IN ACTING CAPACITY</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Goh Keng Swee, pursuant to his reply to the following question for oral answer asked on 21st\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1960\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Official Report, 21st September, 1960, Volume 13, No. 9, column 624):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Mohd.
