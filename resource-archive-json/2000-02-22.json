In brief, the Restricted  Passports  have\r\n\r\nbeen phased out due to falling demand, and because it is  not\r\n\r\ncost-effective to continue issuing them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B.

I thought that a  great  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  were crossing the Causeway.  That  is  what  we\r\n\r\nhear  every  day. Is the Minister saying that the number  has\r\n\r\ndropped to an extent that it is no longer productive for  the\r\n\r\nMinistry to produce the Restricted Passport?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

But by the actual\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnumber of passports that have been issued over time, there is\r\n\r\nclearly a falling demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister whether money was\r\n\r\nan important factor? The Singapore International Passport,  I\r\n\r\nam  told, costs $70, whereas the Restricted Passport used  to\r\n\r\nbe  only $30.  Was that a factor -  that the Government could\r\n\r\nget more revenue?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam knows that\r\n\r\nthe  Government does not operate this way. We  do  not  raise\r\n\r\nfees  just  to get more revenue. The cost-effectiveness  part\r\n\r\ncomes in due to the new security features which have made our\r\n\r\npassport  so much more secure.  If we had continued producing\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  Restricted  Passport,  then  the   cost   of\r\n\r\nproduction for both the Singapore Restricted Passport and the\r\n\r\nSingapore  International Passport would have been  equalised.\r\n\r\nIn   other  words,  we  would  have  to  charge  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nsomething  similar, whether we issue them a SRP or  SIP,  and\r\n\r\nthat  does  not  make  sense  because  now,  for  $60,  if  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean  applies by post, he gets a passport  (96  pages)\r\n\r\nthat would enable him to travel to more than just one country\r\n\r\nand with added security features at a one-time cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> For those\r\n\r\nregulars  travelling  between both  sides  of  the  Causeway,\r\n\r\neither  for  work or business, is the Government  considering\r\n\r\nissuing a Smartcard to facilitate travelling?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

However,  these\r\n\r\nproved  to  be inadequate.  McDonald's was particularly  ill-prepared  for the large crowds which turned up overnight  for\r\n\r\nthe  27th  January 2000 launch. Some radio stations regularly\r\n\r\nreported  the  size  of  the queues,  leading  to  even  more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans rushing to join the queues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the 27th January 2000 launch, on Police\r\n\r\nadvice,  McDonald's came up with a system  that  extends  the\r\n\r\nperiod  of sale, and which ensures that all demands  for  the\r\n\r\nlast  pair  of  Hello Kitty dolls would be  met.   The  final\r\n\r\nlaunch on 3rd February 2000 under this new system took  place\r\n\r\nwithout incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizers of promotional events that are likely to\r\n\r\nattract  large  crowds should act responsibly by  putting  in\r\n\r\nplace  arrangements and procedures to ensure that their event\r\n\r\ndoes not lead to law and order problems.

While the use of safety harness  was\r\n\r\na  possibility, we concluded that it is not the best  way  to\r\n\r\nresolve the problem of foreign domestic workers falling while\r\n\r\ncleaning  windows  in high-rise buildings.  Safety  harnesses\r\n\r\nare  used  when workers have no option but to work in  places\r\n\r\nwhere  there are no secure foothold or handhold and the  risk\r\n\r\nof  falling is high.  Foreign domestic workers should not  be\r\n\r\nrequired to carry out any work under such risky conditions at\r\n\r\nall.  If they are required to clean windows, they should  use\r\n\r\nappropriate cleaning equipment with extended handles to reach\r\n\r\nthe difficult spots.  They do not have to stand on chairs  or\r\n\r\nstools  or  climb out of the building to clean windows.   The\r\n\r\nrequirement  for the use of a safety harness is  also  not  a\r\n\r\nfail-safe  measure as evidenced by the number of construction\r\n\r\nworkers  who suffered injuries or died from falls.  A  safety\r\n\r\nharness  must  be worn and secured properly in  order  to  be\r\n\r\neffective.    Employers   and   foreign   domestic   workers,\r\n\r\nunfamiliar  with  the use of safety harnesses,  may  endanger\r\n\r\nthemselves.   In  fact, its use may create a false  sense  of\r\n\r\nsecurity  with  more employers asking their foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers to do dangerous work leading to accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem is best addressed through proper public\r\n\r\neducation  and  raising awareness among employers  and  their\r\n\r\nforeign domestic workers of the danger of cleaning windows in\r\n\r\nhigh-rise buildings.  Most foreign domestic workers come from\r\n\r\nrural areas and are thus not familiar with working and living\r\n\r\nin  an urban environment.  Employers should ensure that their\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic workers are properly oriented  and  trained\r\n\r\nwhen  performing household duties.  Singaporeans  who  employ\r\n\r\nforeign   domestic   workers   have   a   moral   and   legal\r\n\r\nresponsibility to ensure that their foreign domestic  workers\r\n\r\nwork   safely  and  securely  in  their  homes,   free   from\r\n\r\nunnecessary risks, harassment or physical abuse.  Employers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  not  compromise on the safety and  welfare  of  their\r\n\r\nforeign domestic workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to help raise the awareness of our employers of the\r\n\r\nlikely  hazards of household work, my Ministry had in October\r\n\r\nlast  year,  sent  a  circular to all  employers  of  foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic workers to remind them to exercise greater care when\r\n\r\nassigning household cleaning duties to their foreign domestic\r\n\r\nworkers.   Early last year, we had issued an information  kit\r\n\r\nto   all   employers  of  foreign  domestic   workers.    The\r\n\r\ninformation   kit   highlighted  the  employers'   role   and\r\n\r\nresponsibility   and  includes  a  training   checklist   for\r\n\r\nemployers  to  discuss  potential  safety  hazards  that  the\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic  workers  may  encounter  while  performing\r\n\r\nhousehold chores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has also produced an orientation video for\r\n\r\nnew  foreign  domestic workers coming to  Singapore  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time.  Amongst other things, the video advises foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic  workers to lock the window grilles before  cleaning\r\n\r\nhigh-rise  windows, and not to climb out  of  the  window  to\r\n\r\nclean the windows or to retrieve objects that may have fallen\r\n\r\nonto the window ledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to educate and raise the awareness of\r\n\r\nemployers  and  their  foreign domestic  workers.   The  Work\r\n\r\nPermit  Department is currently working on a new  information\r\n\r\nkit  that will be issued to foreign domestic workers in their\r\n\r\nown  language.  The kit will also draw the attention  of  the\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic workers to the precautionary measures  that\r\n\r\nneed  to  be taken when they perform various domestic chores.\r\n\r\nWe  believe that our effort will minimise risk and  accidents\r\n\r\ninvolving foreign domestic workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, does the\r\n\r\nMinister  really expect that just by educating the  employers\r\n\r\nso  that  they could teach their maids how to clean high-rise\r\n\r\nwindows, it would be effective?  Secondly, the Minister  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  maid  is not supposed to do such a dangerous  job.\r\n\r\nBut I think we all know that we cannot prevent employers from\r\n\r\ninstructing  their  maids to do such a chore.   Thirdly,  the\r\n\r\nsafety harness is not really that difficult to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuse.   Apart from a safety harness, can the Minister  suggest\r\n\r\nsomething concrete, apart from just advising the employers to\r\n\r\nask  their maids to be more careful?  Is there any other  way\r\n\r\nthat can ensure the safety of the maids?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, the answer to the Member's first\r\n\r\nsupplementary  question  is  yes,  we  believe  that   public\r\n\r\neducation will be effective in minimising such accidents.  It\r\n\r\nwill  raise the awareness among employers that in fact  there\r\n\r\nare  safer ways to clean windows, and there is really no need\r\n\r\nfor  them  to  ask  their  foreign domestic  workers  to  put\r\n\r\nthemselves in such a dangerous situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether foreign domestic workers are supposed to\r\n\r\nclean  windows, I think cleaning windows is, of course,  part\r\n\r\nof  domestic  chores.   But it is  the  way  they  clean  the\r\n\r\nwindows.   As  I  have  said in my answer  earlier  on,  most\r\n\r\nwindows  in  high-rise  buildings  and,  in  fact,   in   HDB\r\n\r\napartments  where most of our people live  in,  the  HDB  has\r\n\r\nassured  us that the windows can be cleaned using  the  right\r\n\r\ncleaning implements without having to climb out of the window\r\n\r\nor  to  expose yourself to any danger of falling out  of  the\r\n\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that the safety harness is not difficult to use.\r\n\r\nIt  still requires a certain amount of training.  It requires\r\n\r\nthe  installation of the appropriate anchor points  for  such\r\n\r\nsafety  harnesses.  Safety harnesses have got to be inspected\r\n\r\nregularly  to  ensure  that they are not  subject  to  damage\r\n\r\nthrough wear and tear.  I am just quoting to the Member  what\r\n\r\nwe  have to do in the construction industry, and despite  the\r\n\r\nelaborate  and  very massive efforts, we still  do  encounter\r\n\r\naccidents  of  foreign  construction  workers  falling   from\r\n\r\nheights.   In fact, it is probably one of the biggest  causes\r\n\r\nof accidents in the construction sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let us not assume that just by requiring the foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic  workers  to  use a safety harness,  we  would  have\r\n\r\neradicated the problem completely.  In fact, my fear,  shared\r\n\r\nby  the  officers  in  the Ministry when we  considered  this\r\n\r\nproblem last year was that if you require\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  safety  harness, it would give people  a  false  sense  of\r\n\r\nsecurity.   They would just give the foreign domestic  worker\r\n\r\nany old safety harness they come across, tie it to any anchor\r\n\r\npoint and say, \"Now, you climb out of the window and do  this\r\n\r\ndangerous work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that cleaning a window from the outside of a\r\n\r\nbuilding  is  not  a domestic task.  It requires  specialised\r\n\r\nwindow  cleaners  who  are trained  to  do  such  work.   Any\r\n\r\nemployer who does so and force the maid to climb out  of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  to clean the windows is obviously out of his  mind.\r\n\r\nWould  the employer himself or herself do such a thing?   And\r\n\r\nif  you are not prepared to do it, why would you get somebody\r\n\r\nelse, who is totally untrained and unfit for this task, to do\r\n\r\nso?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our job is to educate our people and say that you must\r\n\r\nnot  adopt  such  a  callous  attitude  towards  the  foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic   workers.   They  deserve  your   care   and   your\r\n\r\nprotection.  They have come from a far off country to work in\r\n\r\nyour home.  You should look after them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also like to point out that every case of a foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic  worker falling from a high-rise window and  getting\r\n\r\ninjured  or dying as a result will be thoroughly investigated\r\n\r\nby  the police.  I just want to repeat that the police  will,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  investigate thoroughly into the  cause  of  death,\r\n\r\nincluding whether there was any criminal negligence involving\r\n\r\nthe  employer or any other person.  If there is evidence that\r\n\r\ncriminal  negligence  is  involved   -   I  understand   that\r\n\r\ncriminal negligence is an offence in the Penal Code  -   then\r\n\r\nI  can  assure  Members  that the police  and  the  Attorney-General's Chambers will not hesitate to act according to  the\r\n\r\nlaw.   So  it  is not as if we are totally powerless  against\r\n\r\nunscrupulous   employers  who  deliberately,   wilfully   and\r\n\r\nunfairly  force their foreign domestic workers  to  undertake\r\n\r\nsuch  a dangerous and hazardous task.  There are already laws\r\n\r\nwhich  cover such a situation.  If the investigation  reveals\r\n\r\nsuch  evidence,  we  can already proceed under  the  existing\r\n\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, it is life that we are talking\r\n\r\nabout,  although they are foreign maids.

We will proceed  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  that  continuing education of  the  employers  of\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic  workers is the best way of  tackling  this\r\n\r\nproblem  at  source.   If  we  require  the  use  of   safety\r\n\r\nharnesses, then we are telling the employers that,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nplease  go  ahead  and  put their maids  into  all  kinds  of\r\n\r\ndangerous  situations.  Just have them use a  safety  harness\r\n\r\nand  they will be fully protected.  It will be all right  for\r\n\r\nthem  to do so.  I think it is totally unjustified for us  to\r\n\r\nexpect these women coming from a village in Indonesia or  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines to suddenly climb out of a window or to stand  on\r\n\r\nthe window ledge on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25th  floor of a building to clean the window.  It is out  of\r\n\r\nthis  world.  How can we imagine that they should be  put  in\r\n\r\nsuch  a  position just because we have given  them  a  safety\r\n\r\nharness?  I think it is wrong to take such a position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should take the position that no employer on his own\r\n\r\nwould  want  to  ask the maid to do such a task.   There  are\r\n\r\nalready   existing  equipment.   One  can   walk   into   any\r\n\r\nsupermarket  or department store and maybe for  $10  or  even\r\n\r\nless, he could buy himself a cleaning device that allows  him\r\n\r\nto  reach every part of the window.  Then why are we  talking\r\n\r\nabout having to have safety harnesses and so on and so forth?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his other point, I thank the Member for his\r\n\r\ncontribution   that   if  there  is  evidence   of   criminal\r\n\r\nnegligence, then a prosecution can be sustained.  Even though\r\n\r\nno employer had been prosecuted in the past, it does not mean\r\n\r\nthat  no employer will be prosecuted in the future.   If,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  police  investigations  reveal  evidence  of  criminal\r\n\r\nnegligence, as I have assured Members earlier on, I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  the  police and the Attorney-General's  Chambers\r\n\r\nwill proceed according to the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Sir, can the Minister\r\n\r\nconsider publicising the punitive measures which can be taken\r\n\r\nagainst employers?

But if  the\r\n\r\nemployers know that if they do that and the penalty  is  very\r\n\r\nsevere, then they will not ask the maid to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will certainly ask\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry  to  do that and to continue to  reinforce  this\r\n\r\nmessage.   We have been doing so, as I have mentioned  in  my\r\n\r\nearlier answer, and we will update  the information kit  that\r\n\r\nwe issue both to the domestic workers and to the employers to\r\n\r\ncaution them on this particular aspect of domestic work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Maybe the Ministry should consider\r\n\r\nconducting  a short course to educate foreign domestic  maids\r\n\r\non   the   proper  ways  of  cleaning  windows  in  high-rise\r\n\r\nbuildings, because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere are certainly other safer ways to clean windows.

There are already,  if  I\r\n\r\nremember  correctly, nearly 1,000 employment agents  involved\r\n\r\nin recruiting such domestic workers.  I think we can leave it\r\n\r\nto  them  to  provide the appropriate level of  training  for\r\n\r\nthese  domestic  workers.  In fact, some of the  training  is\r\n\r\ndone  in  the  home  country before they actually  leave  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  In some other cases, community organisations,  such\r\n\r\nas  the  Marine  Parade  CDC had offered  such  training  for\r\n\r\ndomestic workers. This is all to be supported.  We can  leave\r\n\r\nit  to  the employment agents and the community organisations\r\n\r\nto  run  such courses rather than asking my Ministry  or  the\r\n\r\nWork  Permit Department to conduct such courses.  I think  it\r\n\r\nis  more appropriate for a wide variety of suppliers for this\r\n\r\nservice  to run the courses and to train the maids  according\r\n\r\nto  the  needs of the employers.  Members have to  understand\r\n\r\nthat some people employ foreign domestic workers not just  to\r\n\r\nlook  after children or clean windows.  Some employ  them  to\r\n\r\nlook  after  the  aged.   So what particular  aspect  of  the\r\n\r\ntraining should we focus on?  I think we should leave  it  to\r\n\r\nthe  private sector.  They know what the customer  wants  the\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic worker for.  Therefore, they would  provide\r\n\r\nthe right level of training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I understand that there are about\r\n\r\n50,000  maids in Singapore and that 86% of Singaporeans  live\r\n\r\nin  highrise flats and many of them employ foreign maids.

The  total number of  CPF  members  using\r\n\r\nMedisave  to  pay  for  coverage under  the  IncomeShield  or\r\n\r\nManaged HealthCare System was 200,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the inception of the Basic MediShield Scheme in\r\n\r\n1990,  about  230,000  members had  opted  out  and  did  not\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  any  health  insurance  schemes  using   CPF\r\n\r\nsavings.   Such persons could have their own health insurance\r\n\r\ncoverage  or  felt  that they were adequately  covered  under\r\n\r\ntheir   employers'  healthcare  benefits.   Another   337,000\r\n\r\nmembers had opted out of the Basic MediShield Scheme in order\r\n\r\nto  join  MediShield Plus, IncomeShield or Managed Healthcare\r\n\r\nSystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board recognises that there could still be some\r\n\r\nmembers who may not have healthcare coverage.  Therefore, the\r\n\r\nBoard  carries  out regular programmes to promote  MediShield\r\n\r\ncover.   These  include sending to all  new  CPF  members  an\r\n\r\ninformation  package on MediShield, and providing information\r\n\r\non  MediShield  in  the CPF Newsline in all  the  four  major\r\n\r\nlanguage  newspapers regularly.

Therefore, once you opt out,  to  rejoin,\r\n\r\nyou  will  have to satisfy the conditions as a new applicant,\r\n\r\nwhich  may well include medical examination and a ruling  out\r\n\r\nof  coverage for prevailing or pre-existing illnesses.   That\r\n\r\nis why it is beneficial for CPF members to remain a member of\r\n\r\nMediShield   or  some  other  insurance,  such   as   Managed\r\n\r\nHealthcare  System or IncomeShield or MediShield  Plus  right\r\n\r\nfrom  day one.

Encouraging competition and increasing access  to\r\n\r\na  range of goods and services enable consumers to make their\r\n\r\nown  decisions from a menu of choices.

However,\r\n\r\none side effect is that serious crimes are no longer confined\r\n\r\nwithin   national   boundaries.   The  reduction   of   trade\r\n\r\nrestrictions, the increasing ease with which people and goods\r\n\r\ncross    national    borders,    the    global    reach    of\r\n\r\ntelecommunications  and  financial  systems,  all  of   these\r\n\r\npresent opportunities to criminals to extend their activities\r\n\r\nbeyond  national borders.  The same forces that make possible\r\n\r\ntoday's  rapid international trade can be exploited  and  are\r\n\r\nexploited  by  criminals to extend their criminal  activities\r\n\r\nand influences across countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without an effective network of international\r\n\r\ncooperation in the war against transnational crimes, criminal\r\n\r\norganisations  will  be able to exploit the  differences  and\r\n\r\ndislocations  caused by national borders to  their  advantage\r\n\r\nand  defy  the individual efforts of national authorities  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  them.  This Bill before the House  today  signals\r\n\r\nSingapore's  commitment to be part of the wider international\r\n\r\nnetwork of cooperation in combating crime on a global scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time that we have enacted legal\r\n\r\nprovisions  for international mutual assistance  in  criminal\r\n\r\nmatters.    In   1993,  we  enacted  the   Drug   Trafficking\r\n\r\n(Confiscation  of  Benefits) Act with mechanisms  for  mutual\r\n\r\nassistance   built   in  to  help  in   the   fight   against\r\n\r\ninternational drug money-laundering.

It follows  closely\r\n\r\non  the  heels of the amendments last year, as  part  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  progressive  move  towards  building  a   wider\r\n\r\nframework  for international legal assistance  in  the  fight\r\n\r\nagainst  crime.   There is an increasing international  trend\r\n\r\ntowards   enacting  comprehensive  mutual  legal   assistance\r\n\r\nlegislation.  We see this in the laws of the United  Kingdom,\r\n\r\nAustralia, New Zealand and Hong Kong, to name but a few.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  during the Plenary of the Financial Action Task  Force\r\n\r\nlast  year,  Singapore was encouraged to  enact  a  dedicated\r\n\r\nmutual assistance law.  It is in keeping with our role  as  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the Financial Action Task Force to  act  on  this\r\n\r\nsuggestion and to propose this Bill to this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill not only facilitates the provision of legal\r\n\r\nassistance by Singapore to foreign authorities, it will  also\r\n\r\nenhance  the  legal  arsenal  at  the  disposal  of  our  law\r\n\r\nenforcement  agencies in fighting transnational  crime.   For\r\n\r\nexample, our law enforcement agencies have in the past  faced\r\n\r\nproblems  in  getting witnesses from other  jurisdictions  to\r\n\r\ncome  to Singapore to give evidence. This has hampered  their\r\n\r\ninvestigations in some cases.  The Bill before us will  allow\r\n\r\nthem  to receive such assistance.  It will help to facilitate\r\n\r\nthe work of our enforcement agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Overview of the Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now take the House through the main\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the Bill.  The Bill has four parts.   Part  2\r\n\r\ndeals  with the requests for assistance made by Singapore  to\r\n\r\nforeign  countries.   Part  3 deals  with  the  requests  for\r\n\r\nassistance to Singapore by foreign countries.  Parts 1 and  4\r\n\r\ndeal with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngeneral issues which are common to both requests by Singapore\r\n\r\nto foreign countries and foreign countries to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill marks out the extent and forms of assistance\r\n\r\nwhich Singapore is prepared to give, the pre-conditions to be\r\n\r\nmet  before  such  assistance is given,  and  the  conditions\r\n\r\ngoverning the rendering of such assistance.  It also provides\r\n\r\nthe  legal  framework  for Singapore to request  and  receive\r\n\r\nassistance from other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill does not deal with extradition. All requests\r\n\r\nfor  extradition and assistance leading to extradition,  will\r\n\r\ncontinue   to  be  handled  under  the  provisions   of   the\r\n\r\nExtradition Act.  Clause 5 of the Bill makes that very clear.\r\n\r\nThe  Bill  will  also  not  affect  the  system  of  informal\r\n\r\ncooperation  currently existing between our  law  enforcement\r\n\r\nagencies  and  other  law enforcement  agencies  as  well  as\r\n\r\ninternational organisations, such as Interpol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance under the Bill may be obtained or provided\r\n\r\nfor  criminal investigations, criminal proceedings in  court,\r\n\r\nand  seizure or confiscation of proceeds or instrumentalities\r\n\r\nof  crime.  The Bill imposes no restrictions on which country\r\n\r\nSingapore may request assistance from.  When it comes to  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  assistance  to  foreign  countries,  the  Bill\r\n\r\ndistinguishes between assistance involving coercive measures,\r\n\r\nsuch as, for example, search warrants and those not involving\r\n\r\ncoercive   measures,  for  example,  service  of   documents.\r\n\r\nAssistance  which does not involve coercive measures  may  be\r\n\r\nprovided to any country.  On the other hand, assistance which\r\n\r\ninvolves coercive measures may only be provided to a  country\r\n\r\nwhich  has  a mutual legal assistance treaty with  Singapore.\r\n\r\nFor  these  measures, the Bill merely lays down the framework\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore to enter into a mutual legal assistance treaty\r\n\r\nwith   other  countries  for  the  provision  of  assistance.\r\n\r\nTherefore, whether assistance can be provided will depend  on\r\n\r\nthe  existence  of  a  treaty.   Just as extradition  is  not\r\n\r\nautomatic  but  is  conditional  on  the  existence   of   an\r\n\r\nextradition  treaty, it is also consistent with international\r\n\r\npractice to condition the use of a State's coercive powers on\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexistence  of  a  mutual legal assistance  treaty,  sometimes\r\n\r\nreferred  to as MLAT in short.  The requirement for a  treaty\r\n\r\nwill  allow  Singapore  to  set  conditions  for  giving   of\r\n\r\nassistance  and  provide safeguards against abuses  by  other\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point out at this stage that there is one\r\n\r\nexception  to  this  distinction between  coercive  and  non-coercive  measures.  This relates to the provision on  taking\r\n\r\ntestimony  in Singapore courts for use in foreign proceedings\r\n\r\n(clause  21).   This is because this form  of  assistance  is\r\n\r\nalready   currently  available  under  section  43   of   the\r\n\r\nExtradition  Act,  without the requirement for  mutual  legal\r\n\r\nassistance  treaty  and we do not wish to  upset  a  practice\r\n\r\nwhich has been in place for many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the list of offences for which assistance may be\r\n\r\nobtained  or provided for under the Bill is the same  as  the\r\n\r\nlist   currently   applicable  under  the  Corruption,   Drug\r\n\r\nTrafficking   and  Other  Serious  Crimes  (Confiscation   of\r\n\r\nBenefits) Act (or CDSA for short).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that the Attorney-General will be the\r\n\r\nauthority for requesting assistance from other countries  and\r\n\r\nreceiving requests for assistance from other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Request by Singapore</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as requests by Singapore are concerned, under the\r\n\r\nBill,  Singapore can ask for a number of different  forms  of\r\n\r\nassistance  from  a  foreign  country.   The  first  form  of\r\n\r\nassistance involves obtaining of evidence - that is, asking a\r\n\r\nforeign  country to take evidence in that country,  including\r\n\r\nobtaining  the  testimony of witnesses  as  well  as  seizing\r\n\r\nphysical evidence, photographs, documents, and transmit  them\r\n\r\nto  Singapore for use in legal proceedings.  The second  form\r\n\r\nof assistance is in arranging for the voluntary attendance of\r\n\r\npersons in Singapore as witnesses in legal proceedings or  to\r\n\r\nassist  in  criminal  investigations.  Clause  11  gives  the\r\n\r\nassurance that a person who comes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  Singapore under this provision will, during the period of\r\n\r\nhis  stay  in Singapore for the purpose requested, be  immune\r\n\r\nfrom prosecution or civil suit for anything which he has done\r\n\r\nbefore leaving the foreign country to come to Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nthird  form of assistance is to request a foreign country  to\r\n\r\nenforce  a Singapore confiscation order.  Fourthly, a request\r\n\r\ncould  be made to a foreign country to assist in locating  or\r\n\r\nidentifying  a person who could be of assistance in  criminal\r\n\r\ninvestigations  or proceedings or who could  be  affected  by\r\n\r\nsuch  investigations or proceedings.  Finally, a request  can\r\n\r\nbe  made to a foreign country for service of Singapore  court\r\n\r\ndocuments in that country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the existence of these provisions in our law\r\n\r\ndoes  not mean that any foreign country will be automatically\r\n\r\nobliged  to  accede  to our requests.   Whether  the  foreign\r\n\r\ncountry  will  accede  to  our request  will  depend  on  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of that country's laws.  Just as we  require  the\r\n\r\nexistence   of  a  mutual  legal  assistance  treaty   before\r\n\r\nproviding some forms of this assistance, the country to which\r\n\r\nwe  make  a  request  may  similarly impose  a  condition  of\r\n\r\nrendering assistance upon the existence of prior arrangements\r\n\r\nor  understanding  with  Singapore  concerning  mutual  legal\r\n\r\nassistance.  Essentially, Sir, what these provisions do is to\r\n\r\nestablish  that the Attorney-General has the legal  authority\r\n\r\nto make such requests on behalf of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Request to Singapore</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to requests which may be made by foreign\r\n\r\ncountries  to  Singapore,  the  forms  of  assistance   which\r\n\r\nSingapore can request are also the forms of assistance  which\r\n\r\nSingapore  can  provide  under  the  Bill.   As  I  explained\r\n\r\nearlier,  some  of these provisions of giving  assistance  by\r\n\r\nSingapore,   like  those  concerning  search   warrants   and\r\n\r\nproduction  orders,  are only enabling  provisions.   Whether\r\n\r\nassistance can be invoked in any particular case will  depend\r\n\r\non  whether there is a mutual legal assistance treaty between\r\n\r\nSingapore and the requesting country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the various forms of assistance which Singapore can\r\n\r\nprovide,  assistance  concerning  production  orders,  search\r\n\r\nwarrants  and enforcement of foreign confiscation orders  are\r\n\r\nalready  provided for in the CDSA.  As I mentioned just  now,\r\n\r\nthese  mutual  assistance provisions  in  the  CDSA  will  be\r\n\r\nrepealed and moved into this Bill.  Assistance in the  taking\r\n\r\nof  evidence is also not new, as it is now provided for under\r\n\r\nsection  43  of the Extradition Act.  Similarly,  section  43\r\n\r\nwill  be repealed and moved into the Bill as clause 21.  This\r\n\r\nconsolidation  will now provide a convenient one-stop  source\r\n\r\nof  reference  of  the  provisions for mutual  assistance  in\r\n\r\ncriminal matters in our law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Safeguards built into the Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the safeguards which have been built into\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.   While  we are willing to provide  assistance  to\r\n\r\nforeign  authorities in appropriate circumstances,  obviously\r\n\r\nthere  must be safeguards in place to prevent abuses  of  our\r\n\r\nwillingness to assist and to prevent unnecessary intrusion by\r\n\r\nforeign  authorities into the privacy of our  businesses  and\r\n\r\nindividuals.   Many safeguards are therefore built  into  the\r\n\r\nBill.  I shall briefly explain the main safeguards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first safeguard of course is the limited list of\r\n\r\noffences  for which assistance is available.  As I  mentioned\r\n\r\nbefore,  this list is tied to the list of offences under  the\r\n\r\nCDSA.  Limiting the list of offences for which assistance can\r\n\r\nbe  provided  ensures that assistance is given only  for  the\r\n\r\noffences  which are considered to be sufficiently serious  in\r\n\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second safeguard is the requirement for mutual legal\r\n\r\nassistance  treaty for certain forms of assistance,  which  I\r\n\r\nhave  already mentioned, and can be described as coercive  in\r\n\r\nnature.   A  related  safeguard is that  a  request  will  be\r\n\r\ndeclined if it does not comply with the conditions laid  down\r\n\r\nin the applicable treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that requests are not made unnecessarily, it\r\n\r\nis  provided  that  the Attorney-General will  not  honour  a\r\n\r\nrequest if the thing requested is not of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsufficient  importance  to  the  investigation  of   criminal\r\n\r\nproceedings, or could reasonably be obtained by other means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid information or evidence obtained pursuant to a\r\n\r\nrequest  from being used subsequently for other purposes,  it\r\n\r\nis provided that a request will be declined if the requesting\r\n\r\nstate  fails to give an undertaking that the thing  requested\r\n\r\nwill not be used for purposes other than those for which  the\r\n\r\nrequest was made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is a general power to decline a request\r\n\r\nif  the  provision  of  assistance could  prejudice  a  local\r\n\r\ninvestigation  or criminal proceeding or would prejudice  the\r\n\r\nsafety  of any person or if it is not in the public  interest\r\n\r\nto provide the assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Miscellaneous amendment to CDSA</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I end, I should mention that the Bill also seeks\r\n\r\nto  insert a new section 39A into the CDSA. This will empower\r\n\r\nSuspicious  Transactions Reporting Officers in the Commercial\r\n\r\nAffairs   Department  to  share  information   with   foreign\r\n\r\nfinancial  intelligence units.  Safeguards  have  been  built\r\n\r\ninto  section  39A  such that the sharing of  information  is\r\n\r\nconditional  on  there  being  an  arrangement  between   the\r\n\r\nfinancial  intelligence units of Singapore  and  the  foreign\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, let me say that this Bill will\r\n\r\nenhance  the legal arsenal at the disposal of law enforcement\r\n\r\nagencies.  It will also enable Singapore to play its part  in\r\n\r\nthe  wider  international  efforts  to  combat  transnational\r\n\r\ncrimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport  the Bill.  In preface to that, I am sure Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House  will remember that the whole world  was  waiting\r\n\r\nwith  bated breath on the eve of the New Year, 31st  December\r\n\r\n1999, when we thought that if the millennium bug did not  get\r\n\r\nus, the other viruses will.  In the end, happily, it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  a  non-event,  though  many,  especially  those  in  the\r\n\r\ncomputer departments must have thought that there were better\r\n\r\nways to spend the millennium eve than to sit in one's office,\r\n\r\nwatching computer screens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this example shows how we entered this new\r\n\r\nmillennium, this new century, feeling very vulnerable.  Crime\r\n\r\nknows  no  borders and criminals these days are as much  into\r\n\r\nglobalisation  as any self-respecting industry.   It  is  the\r\n\r\nsame  for those who are engaged in other crimes and  who  use\r\n\r\ncomputers,   for  example,  to  facilitate  their   nefarious\r\n\r\naffairs, such as money laundering and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore imperative that we have in place\r\n\r\nlegislation  that  would allow our prosecutors  to  cooperate\r\n\r\nwith  their  counterparts  in other countries.  Indeed,  such\r\n\r\nlegislation is not just timely, but overdue.  Be that  as  it\r\n\r\nmay, we observe the rule of law and once this Bill is passed,\r\n\r\nwe  will have in place the legislation needed for us to  seek\r\n\r\nassistance  from  others in a variety of ways  -  to  collect\r\n\r\nevidence,  to  look  for witnesses, to  enforce  confiscation\r\n\r\norders and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have several issues that I hope the Minister can\r\n\r\nclarify in this debate.  The first has to do with the  effect\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill  on the process of extradition.  According  to\r\n\r\nclause  5, the Bill does not authorise extradition,  and  any\r\n\r\narrest  or  detention associated with it. At the  same  time,\r\n\r\nPart  III  of  the Bill, which the Minister has referred  to,\r\n\r\ndeals with requests made by other countries to Singapore  for\r\n\r\nassistance.   This  may conceivably be used  to  request  the\r\n\r\nattendance of a person from Singapore and if that person were\r\n\r\nto  go,  he may find himself subjected to other charges  that\r\n\r\nneither  the Attorney-General nor he was informed  about.   I\r\n\r\nshould like to ask the Minister to confirm to the House  that\r\n\r\nthe  safeguards provided in this Bill would not be used as  a\r\n\r\nback  door  to extradition, and that adequate safeguards  are\r\n\r\nindeed in place to prevent this.  Would he also confirm  that\r\n\r\nextradition  remains the main process through  which  alleged\r\n\r\ncriminals are extradited to other countries?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue I have concerns the use of evidence,\r\n\r\nonce  obtained from abroad. Clause 8(3) allows evidence  from\r\n\r\nabroad  to be admitted, subject to the Evidence Act  and  the\r\n\r\nCriminal Procedure Code. Such evidence may include, according\r\n\r\nto  the  clause,  things  or  photos  or  copies  of  things.\r\n\r\nHowever, unlike statements contained in things, there  is  no\r\n\r\nprovision  on how to authenticate and evaluate this evidence.\r\n\r\nIf a statement is involved, then the Court is under a duty to\r\n\r\nsee  whether  it  is possible to challenge the  statement  by\r\n\r\nquestioning  the  maker.  It is also  to  take  into  account\r\n\r\nwhether  legal representation was available to the  maker  at\r\n\r\nthe  time the statement was made.  One example of the problem\r\n\r\ncould be in relation to the case of things or objects.  It is\r\n\r\nusually  required in Singapore that the person  adducing  any\r\n\r\nthing or object should show the \"chain of evidence\" from  the\r\n\r\ntime  the  object was seized to the time it was  produced  in\r\n\r\nCourt.  Thus, for example, if a packet of heroin was  seized,\r\n\r\nsay,  in  Jakarta,  and if that packet were  to  be  used  in\r\n\r\nevidence here in Singapore, there should be a record from the\r\n\r\ntime  it  was seized to the time it was produced in Court  to\r\n\r\navoid  the  danger of fabrication or misuse of  evidence.   I\r\n\r\nhope  that the Minister can confirm that the Attorney-General\r\n\r\nand  other prosecuting authorities would take the utmost care\r\n\r\nin  using evidence obtained from abroad in Singapore  courts.\r\n\r\nIt  must satisfy the rules of production in Singapore courts,\r\n\r\nand  that  this  clause does not, without more,  justify  the\r\n\r\nadmission of evidence without proper authentication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third issue relates to the immunities and privileges\r\n\r\nof a person whose presence is requested through the Bill.  It\r\n\r\nis  whether  the  immunities and privileges  go  too  far  in\r\n\r\ncertain respects, and not far enough in others.  Under clause\r\n\r\n11(a),  the person whose presence is required shall  not  \"be\r\n\r\ndetained, prosecuted or punished in Singapore for any offence\r\n\r\nthat  is  alleged  to  have  been  committed,  or  that   was\r\n\r\ncommitted,  before the person's departure  from  the  foreign\r\n\r\ncountry.\". So a person who has committed a crime in Singapore\r\n\r\nflees to another country, and then requested to come back  to\r\n\r\ngive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevidence,   say,  against  his  accomplice,  would   not   be\r\n\r\nprosecuted while he is returning under this provision.  Could\r\n\r\nthe Ministry clarify that this is indeed the position?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now refer to clause 11(2) which withdraws the\r\n\r\nprotection  under  subclause  (1)  if  the  person  has  left\r\n\r\nSingapore  or  the person has the opportunity  to  leave  but\r\n\r\nremained in Singapore for a purpose unrelated to the  purpose\r\n\r\nfor which his presence was required. Thus, if after the case,\r\n\r\nthe  person were to stay back a day to catch a later  flight,\r\n\r\nand  at  the  same time, do a bit of shopping, it seems  that\r\n\r\ntechnically,  it  would  be  regarded  as  having   had   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  leave,  but has remained  in  Singapore  for\r\n\r\nanother  purpose,  and  therefore, the immunities  no  longer\r\n\r\napply.   I  bring  out this somewhat casual  example  to  ask\r\n\r\nwhether  in such instances, we intend to stick to the  letter\r\n\r\nof  the  law, or its spirit.  Could we expect other countries\r\n\r\nto  be  also  flexible in their approach, and not apply  such\r\n\r\ntechnicalities  when  it  comes  to  Singapore  persons   who\r\n\r\nvoluntarily go to the country requesting their presence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I refer to the wide authority of the Attorney-General to request the presence of a person in Singapore from\r\n\r\na  foreign country. Clause 9 states that the Attorney-General\r\n\r\nmay  make a request to secure a person's attendance if \"there\r\n\r\nare  reasonable grounds to believe that a person in a foreign\r\n\r\ncountry  is capable of giving evidence or assistance relevant\r\n\r\nto  a  criminal matter involving a Singapore offence.\"   Does\r\n\r\nthis  broad authority extend to helping defence counsel,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  in  procuring alibi witnesses?  Or is it  the  case\r\n\r\nthat the procedures under this Bill would only be used to aid\r\n\r\nin prosecutions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I refer to the wide discretion given to\r\n\r\nthe Attorney-General to delegate his powers under the Bill to\r\n\r\nany  public  officer under clause 43.  I  wonder  whether  in\r\n\r\nrelation to such serious matters, the discretion should be so\r\n\r\nwide.  Surely, it would have been more appropriate  to  limit\r\n\r\nthe  delegable  authority  to someone  who  is  in  a  senior\r\n\r\nposition in the Legal Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to reiterate that I do support the Bill, and that\r\n\r\nit   marks   a   significant  step  in  the   fight   against\r\n\r\ninternational crime.  I hope, however, that the Minister  can\r\n\r\nassure  the  Members of this House that such powers,  as  are\r\n\r\nconferred by the Bill, would be properly used, and that  care\r\n\r\nwill always be taken when the life, liberty or property of an\r\n\r\nindividual, whether foreign or local, is at stake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I thank you\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to seek clarifications from the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I support the Bill and since there is\r\n\r\nglobalisation, crime has also globalised, I think  this  Bill\r\n\r\nis  very  useful.  However, I just want to ask  whether  this\r\n\r\nBill  will  be  used  in the case of trafficking  in  people,\r\n\r\nespecially women and children.  There is an increase in these\r\n\r\ncrimes worldwide and will this Bill address that problem. And\r\n\r\nsecondly,  will this Bill be used even in cases  where  there\r\n\r\nare  unscrupulous employment agents who, we know that happens\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  also  bring in foreign workers  illegally  on\r\n\r\npromises  of  employment here? Will these  be  classified  as\r\n\r\nserious crimes and will this Bill be applicable?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I thank Prof. Chin Tet Yung and\r\n\r\nMr  Thomas Thomas for their support of the Bill.  Let me take\r\n\r\nthe  questions which they pose. First, I will deal  with  the\r\n\r\nquestions raised by Prof. Chin Tet Yung.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked about extradition and whether this\r\n\r\ncould  be  used as a back door route of extradition.   He  is\r\n\r\nright  in  pointing  out that this Bill does  not  deal  with\r\n\r\nextradition,  as I have stressed in my speech.  All  requests\r\n\r\nfor  extradition and assistance leading to extradition  would\r\n\r\ncontinue   to  be  handled  under  the  provisions   of   the\r\n\r\nExtradition Act.  This is made clear in clause 5.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nlet me point out that in respect of requesting the assistance\r\n\r\nof   people  to  come  from  foreign  countries  and  foreign\r\n\r\ncountries regarding assistance from Singaporeans to go  there\r\n\r\nto  give  evidence,  the  Bill makes  it  clear  that  it  is\r\n\r\ndependent on their consent. So, this Bill therefore does  not\r\n\r\ndeal with compulsory handing over of witness or person who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan give assistance.  And it also has not got anything to  do\r\n\r\nwith charging a person for any offence in this country or the\r\n\r\nother country with respect to mutual assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked if we could compel the attendance of a\r\n\r\nperson as a way of obtaining extradition by the back door.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not think there is any scope for achieving extradition by\r\n\r\nthe  back door.  Under clause 26, it makes it clear that  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General would not arrange for the  attendance  of  a\r\n\r\nperson  overseas unless the foreign authority gives  adequate\r\n\r\nundertakings   to  the  Attorney-General.    One   of   these\r\n\r\nundertakings,  and it is spelt out in clause 26(3)(a)(i),  is\r\n\r\nthat that person will not be charged for any offence which he\r\n\r\nmay  have committed before he leaves Singapore for a  foreign\r\n\r\ncountry.  This will ensure that a person who travels overseas\r\n\r\nand  has agreed to travel overseas under clause 26 would  not\r\n\r\nbe  charged for any pervious offence while he is in a foreign\r\n\r\ncountry.  That is an important safeguard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked about immunity. If you look at clause\r\n\r\n11, it is clear that for the whole time that a person is here\r\n\r\nin Singapore, pursuant to a request under clause 9, he cannot\r\n\r\nbe  charged for any offence he had committed before  he  left\r\n\r\nthe  foreign country to come to Singapore and I confirm  that\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  intention.  Let me give  an  example  so  that\r\n\r\nMembers  will understand the purport of such a safeguard.   A\r\n\r\nperson  may have committed an offence in Singapore some  time\r\n\r\nago and may be living in a foreign country. If we need him to\r\n\r\ncome  to  Singapore to help with the investigation of another\r\n\r\ncrime,  or to give evidence in a trial concerning some  other\r\n\r\naccused,  naturally, he will be reluctant to do so, for  fear\r\n\r\nthat he would be prosecuted for his previous offence once  he\r\n\r\ncomes  to  Singapore.   This may not serve  the  interest  of\r\n\r\njustice  as  this  witness' evidence could  be  valuable  and\r\n\r\nanother  criminal  could walk free if  we  fail  to  get  his\r\n\r\nassistance.  When the Bill becomes law, the witness  will  be\r\n\r\nwilling  to  come  to Singapore as clause 11  will  give  him\r\n\r\nimmunity if he comes at the request\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the Attorney-General, but the immunity is only temporary.\r\n\r\nOnce a witness leaves Singapore, the immunity ceases to apply\r\n\r\nand  we could prosecute him if he comes back again on his own\r\n\r\nvolition.   Of course, if there is an extradition arrangement\r\n\r\nin  place,  we can also ask for his extradition  at  a  later\r\n\r\ntime.  The key is that during the period, he is here for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of which assistance was sought and he had agreed  to\r\n\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also clarify that the immunity only applies to\r\n\r\noffences committed by the person before he begins his journey\r\n\r\nto  Singapore.  If he commits a crime when he is in Singapore\r\n\r\nduring  that  period to give assistance, it  is  a  different\r\n\r\nstory and the immunity will not apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also asked a related point, about the point\r\n\r\nof  time  when  the  immunity is deemed withdrawn.   He  gave\r\n\r\nexamples.   He is supposed to leave but he goes shopping  and\r\n\r\nso  on.   Let  me  say  that all these provisions  on  mutual\r\n\r\nassistance will work only if the countries concerned exercise\r\n\r\nthem  in  good  faith and some common sense.  Because  if  we\r\n\r\napply   these   provisions  in   a   very   unrealistic   and\r\n\r\nunreasonable  manner, then, of course,  since  these  matters\r\n\r\ndepend  on  reciprocity, we can expect that  other  countries\r\n\r\nalso  not to act in good faith.  So, international assistance\r\n\r\nand  cooperation  in  legal and law  enforcement  matters  is\r\n\r\npredicated  upon countries working in good faith.  Otherwise,\r\n\r\ninternational cooperation will break down.  So I guess if  it\r\n\r\nis  one  day's shopping, our law enforcement authorities  are\r\n\r\nnot  going  to  unreasonably pounce on him for  his  previous\r\n\r\noffence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also asked a point concerning the reliability\r\n\r\nof  evidence received from overseas, and the example he  gave\r\n\r\nabout scrutinising chain of evidence, packet of heroin seized\r\n\r\nin another country and so on.  I think it goes without saying\r\n\r\nthat  all  evidence received under clause 8 will have  to  be\r\n\r\nassessed   by   our   court  for  relevance,   admissibility,\r\n\r\nreliability and weight.  All evidence received from overseas,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  will  have to be subject to  the  same  rules  of\r\n\r\nevidence as evidence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobtained  locally,  a point which Prof.  Chin  was  concerned\r\n\r\nabout.   It is not the intention that evidence received  from\r\n\r\noverseas  authorities will be scrutinised any less critically\r\n\r\nthan evidence obtained locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add that a statement can be used against a\r\n\r\nwitness only if it is inconsistent with the testimony of  the\r\n\r\nwitness.  If the statement is inconsistent with the testimony\r\n\r\nof  the witness and the intention is not to use the statement\r\n\r\nagainst  the  witness, then the Bill neither  authorises  nor\r\n\r\nprohibits its use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke about the ambit of the Attorney-General's\r\n\r\ndiscretion to make requests to other countries, and he  asked\r\n\r\nwhether  this would include accommodating requests by defence\r\n\r\ncounsel in various cases.  He is right that the Bill provides\r\n\r\nthat  only  the  Attorney-General can make  a  request  to  a\r\n\r\nforeign  country for assistance.  Let me say that the primary\r\n\r\nintention   of   this   Bill   is  to   facilitate   criminal\r\n\r\ninvestigations  and the prosecution of offenders.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nthis  is so for legislation enacted by other countries  also.\r\n\r\nThat is the primary intention.  Having said that, let me  say\r\n\r\nthat there is, of course, nothing in the Bill to prevent  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General from making a request to obtain evidence  in\r\n\r\nthe  aid  of the defence in a particular case.  In answer  to\r\n\r\nProf. Chin's question, let me say that I am sure the Attorney-General  will  give  due consideration to  any  request  from\r\n\r\ndefence  counsel to invoke the Attorney-General's  discretion\r\n\r\nto  request assistance from a foreign country.  But I do  not\r\n\r\nwish  to  give the impression that defence counsel should  be\r\n\r\nfreely  making  such  requests, or that the  Attorney-General\r\n\r\nwill  frequently  agree  to all these  requests  to  approach\r\n\r\nforeign countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I say that? It is because I foresee that even\r\n\r\nrequests  in  aid  of  the  prosecution  will  be  made  very\r\n\r\nsparingly,  because  in mutual legal assistance  arrangement,\r\n\r\nsuch  requests are not routinely made.  They are made in very\r\n\r\nserious cases, because a lot of effort on the part of the law\r\n\r\nenforcement authorities and quite a lot of resources have to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  spent  to  accommodate the request of a foreign  country.\r\n\r\nSo,  each request which Singapore makes to a foreign  country\r\n\r\ndoes  impose  a strain on the resources of a foreign  country\r\n\r\nand  vice  versa.  Just as we have given the Attorney-General\r\n\r\nthe right to decline to deal with trivial, unsubstantiated or\r\n\r\nunnecessary  requests from foreign countries, I should  think\r\n\r\nthat we ourselves would not want to make  such a request in a\r\n\r\nroutine  manner.   Otherwise, we  may  lose  credibility  and\r\n\r\ngoodwill  internationally, and other countries may  not  deal\r\n\r\nwith our requests promptly or seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also dealt with power of delegation. It is\r\n\r\nobvious that there has to be a power of delegation.   And  if\r\n\r\nwe look at the destination table of the different models from\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have  borrowed  some  of  these  provisions,   the\r\n\r\nAustralian legislation has power of delegation.  Let me  say,\r\n\r\nin  answer to his concern, that delegation will be made  only\r\n\r\nto  officers  of  sufficient seniority  to  make  appropriate\r\n\r\ndecisions.   As  to  why it is not confined  only  to  senior\r\n\r\nmembers of the legal service, as he knows, in our system,  we\r\n\r\nhave  the legal service, the police, the CID, maybe CPIB  and\r\n\r\nothers.   Many  law enforcement agencies are involved  and  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  should give the discretion to the Attorney-General\r\n\r\nin  a  particular  case  to  harness  the  resources  of  the\r\n\r\nappropriate department, other than the legal service itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in answer to Prof. Chin's request for an\r\n\r\nassurance, I do wish to assure him that the powers under this\r\n\r\nBill,  of  course, will be properly used,  and  that  is  our\r\n\r\nintention  to do so.  Our main objective of this Bill  is  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate obtaining of evidence and testimony from  overseas\r\n\r\nwith the objective of assisting the efficiency of our own law\r\n\r\nenforcement and criminal investigations and prosecution.   In\r\n\r\ndoing  so,  there  is  no  intention whatsoever  of  lowering\r\n\r\nstandards  or to allow unreliable evidence to be used.   Just\r\n\r\nas  we  are  interested  in  securing  the  conviction  of  a\r\n\r\ncriminal,  it  is  equally important that we  avoid  wrongful\r\n\r\nconviction of innocent people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to thank Mr Thomas for his support of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.   He had two questions.  First, whether this  Bill\r\n\r\nwould  enable  us  to request mutual assistance  from   other\r\n\r\ncountries  in tackling offences on trafficking in  women  and\r\n\r\nchildren.   Upon  perusing the list of offences  namely,  the\r\n\r\nlist  in  the CDSA, I note some of these offences are clearly\r\n\r\nlisted,   such   as   offences  relating   to   prostitution,\r\n\r\ntrafficking in women and girls, importation of women or girls\r\n\r\nby  false  pretences,  causing and encouraging  prostitution,\r\n\r\nintercourse with indecent assaults.  They are covered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His other point is whether the Bill also enables mutual\r\n\r\nassistance  in prosecuting unscrupulous foreign  agents  with\r\n\r\nrespect to foreign illegal workers.  My quick perusal of  the\r\n\r\nlist  does  not show that this specific offence  is  covered.\r\n\r\nWhy?  I think the answer is that our Penal Code and our other\r\n\r\nlegislation  have  hundreds of offences.   Usually,  when  we\r\n\r\ndevise  a  list of offences for the purposes of  extradition,\r\n\r\nconfiscation  orders or mutual assistance, we  will  have  to\r\n\r\nnarrow  them  down to offences which are very  likely  to  be\r\n\r\nconsidered as serious offences in other countries.  This does\r\n\r\nnot  mean that we view the offence of exploitation of workers\r\n\r\nby foreign employment agencies to be any less serious, but we\r\n\r\nhave  to be selective.  I think not all other countries  view\r\n\r\nthe  problem with the same gravity as Singapore.  So they may\r\n\r\nnot  list  it as an extraditable offence or as an offence  in\r\n\r\ntheir mutual legal assistance.  Of course, these matters  are\r\n\r\nnot  cast  in  stone.  Situations may vary.   More  and  more\r\n\r\ncountries may face the same problem and it could well be that\r\n\r\nthis  could be a candidate for mutual legal assistance  at  a\r\n\r\nlater date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill.  -  [Prof. S.

It  also  seeks  to   make\r\n\r\nconsequential amendments to the Development Fund Act and  the\r\n\r\nExternal Loans Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rationale</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has identified the need to strengthen\r\n\r\nSingapore's competitive position to meet the challenges posed\r\n\r\nby  a  rapidly changing global competitive landscape. Towards\r\n\r\nthis  end, capabilities in the more knowledge-intensive parts\r\n\r\nof  the value chain have to be developed. Our human resources\r\n\r\nmust   be   enhanced   and  our  science  and   technological\r\n\r\ncapabilities upgraded to allow us to achieve our objective of\r\n\r\nbecoming  an  advanced  and  globally  competitive  knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy within the next decade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has, over the years, been undertaking a\r\n\r\nhost  of developmental investments aimed at enhancing, either\r\n\r\ndirectly  or  indirectly,  the  economic  growth,  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities and general welfare of Singapore. An example of\r\n\r\nsuch  developmental  investments would be  the  US$1  billion\r\n\r\nTechnopreneurship  Investment Fund (TIF) announced  in  April\r\n\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, only investments made with the primary\r\n\r\npurpose  of  deriving  some interest, income  or  profit  are\r\n\r\npermissible under the Financial Procedure Act. As  a  result,\r\n\r\ninvestments  with developmental objectives such  as  the  TIF\r\n\r\nhave  to be funded under the Development Budget and therefore\r\n\r\ntreated  under  the  Government's cash accounting  system  as\r\n\r\nexpenditure, rather than investments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has thus decided to establish a new fund,\r\n\r\nthe   Developmental   Investment  Fund   (DIF)   to   finance\r\n\r\ndevelopmental  investments. This would allow  the  investment\r\n\r\nnature  of  these developmental investments  to  be  properly\r\n\r\nreflected.  The investments will not be treated  as  straight\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  which  would be the  case  if  the  investments\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  funded through the Development  Fund.  This\r\n\r\nwould  allow the better accounting and management  of  public\r\n\r\nmoneys invested by the Government for developmental purposes.\r\n\r\nThe  DIF  will  be limited to investments where  returns  are\r\n\r\nclearly required and expected.

These are monies invested in companies  or\r\n\r\nindividuals which have a purpose of developing new industries\r\n\r\nor  new  companies to generate future profits for  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThese  are  monies  which will be spent for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\ndeveloping  a  particular  activity  which  is  expected   to\r\n\r\ngenerate returns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the normal Development Fund in our Budget, the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expenditures would be monies which are  expensed\r\n\r\nin  the  current  year,  like  expenditures  in  building  up\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, buildings and so forth which have  value  but\r\n\r\nnot spent specifically for purposes of generating profit.

The amendments  and  new\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  the Bill will enhance unions' decision-making\r\n\r\nprocedures   to  enable  delegates  in  unions   with   large\r\n\r\nmembership  to  make prompt decisions and  also  ensure  that\r\n\r\nunion  appointments  will better safeguard  the  interest  of\r\n\r\nmembers.   Recognising  the  widespread  use  of  Information\r\n\r\nTechnology,  provisions  will also be  introduced  to  enable\r\n\r\ntrade   union   records  to  be  submitted   and   maintained\r\n\r\nelectronically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last major review of the Act was carried out in\r\n\r\n1982.   The  1982 amendment created the framework  for  trade\r\n\r\nunions  to  play a more constructive role by working  closely\r\n\r\nwith  employers  and the Government towards  the  raising  of\r\n\r\nproductivity and the promotion of economic growth.  This  has\r\n\r\nbenefited   our  workers,  employers  and  the   economy   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  active  engagement  of  trade   unions   in\r\n\r\nstrengthening  our  economic  competitiveness   has   brought\r\n\r\nenormous  benefits to workers and contributed to  their  high\r\n\r\nstandard of living and a better quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill, 2000</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The views of the National Trades Union Congress and the\r\n\r\nSingapore National Employers' Federation have been sought\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand, where appropriate, they have been incorporated into  the\r\n\r\namendments in this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the details of the proposed amendments are covered\r\n\r\nin the Explanatory Statement to the Bill.  I will now address\r\n\r\nthe key features of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Delegates System</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin with the delegates system. Sir, the trade\r\n\r\nunion movement in Singapore has bucked the worldwide trend of\r\n\r\ndeclining union membership by being able to maintain a steady\r\n\r\ngrowth in membership throughout the years.  Over the last  10\r\n\r\nyears,  union membership rose from 212,874 in 1989 to 289,707\r\n\r\nin 1999, an increase of 36%. This increase did not come about\r\n\r\nby  chance.  The trade union movement under the leadership of\r\n\r\nthe  National Trades Union Congress works very hard to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  it  stays relevant to meet the changing  needs  of  the\r\n\r\nworkforce,  and  to  recruit and retain members  through  its\r\n\r\nvigorous recruitment campaigns.  Smaller unions have reviewed\r\n\r\ntheir  ability to expand membership and to serve the changing\r\n\r\nexpectations  and  needs of members.  Many  have  decided  to\r\n\r\nmerge  with  other  unions to achieve critical  mass  and  be\r\n\r\ntransformed into more effective organisations to better serve\r\n\r\nthe  needs of their members.  For example, the merger of  the\r\n\r\nJurong  Shipyard Employees Union and Shipbuilding and  Marine\r\n\r\nEngineering   Employees  Union.   As   companies   merge   or\r\n\r\nrestructure  to enhance their competitiveness,  their  unions\r\n\r\nwill  also  have to take similar actions.  For example,  when\r\n\r\nthe  Post  Office Savings Bank was merged with DBS, the  Post\r\n\r\nOffice Savings Bank Employees Union and the Development  Bank\r\n\r\nof Singapore Staff Union merged into one union. This trend of\r\n\r\nmergers  is  likely to continue in order to expand membership\r\n\r\nbase and to better serve workers in related industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade unions with large membership often provide in\r\n\r\ntheir  union  rules  for the delegates to decide  on  various\r\n\r\nmatters, as it would be inefficient and cumbersome for  every\r\n\r\nsuch decision to be taken by all the members. These delegates\r\n\r\nare elected\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the  members of their union through a democratic  process\r\n\r\nand  have  the  confidence  of  members  to  safeguard  their\r\n\r\ninterest and well being.  In these unions, decisions such  as\r\n\r\nthe  election  of  union officers and the amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nunion rules are taken by the delegates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larger trade unions face administrative difficulties in\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of existing sections 33, 34  and  section\r\n\r\n47(2)  of the Act.  Under these provisions, the trade  unions\r\n\r\nare required to seek the consent of their union members on  a\r\n\r\nchange  in  the name of the trade union, which is covered  by\r\n\r\nsection  33; amalgamation with other registered trade unions,\r\n\r\nwhich is covered by section 34, and the change in the use  of\r\n\r\nunion  funds, which is covered by section 47(2). There is  no\r\n\r\nprovision  in the law to allow decisions on these matters  to\r\n\r\nbe  made by the delegates.  In other words, the existing  law\r\n\r\nrequires  that  these  three areas be  decided  upon  by  the\r\n\r\ngeneral membership of each trade union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the system of empowering delegates to make decisions\r\n\r\non  other  affairs has worked well, we propose to extend  the\r\n\r\ndelegates'  power  to include decisions in  the  three  areas\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have just mentioned.  Hence, clause 2 of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides for a delegate system, including the definition of a\r\n\r\n\"delegate\" and how \"requisite consent\" can be sought to allow\r\n\r\nthe  delegates  to make decisions on such  matters.   When  a\r\n\r\ndecision  is  made  by  the delegates, the  number  of  union\r\n\r\nmembers  involved  in the process would  inevitably  be  much\r\n\r\nsmaller  than  having  to convene a general  meeting  of  the\r\n\r\nmembers of the unions.  Hence, it would not be too onerous on\r\n\r\nthe  trade  unions  to  require two-thirds  majority  when  a\r\n\r\ndecision is made through a vote by their delegates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, clause 8 of the Bill repeals and re-enacts\r\n\r\nsections 33 and 34 of the Trade Unions Act to allow  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion  to  seek the requisite consent from its  delegates  to\r\n\r\nchange  its name or to amalgamate with other unions.  Clauses\r\n\r\n9 and 12 will introduce consequential amendments arising from\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of the new provision to allow decisions  to\r\n\r\nbe taken by delegates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are similar provisions in clause 2 of the Bill\r\n\r\ngoverning decisions made in these areas by a person,  who  is\r\n\r\nelected  or appointed as a delegate to attend and vote  at  a\r\n\r\nmeeting  of a federation, on behalf of any of the constituent\r\n\r\ntrade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Appointment of Union Officers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the years many trade unions have\r\n\r\nbuilt  up  strong financial reserves as a result  of  prudent\r\n\r\ninvestments of surplus union funds in union co-operatives and\r\n\r\nother  investments  that  are  authorised  by  law  for   the\r\n\r\ninvestment of trust money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade union funds and assets actually belong to the\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the trade unions and it is important  that  they\r\n\r\ncontinue  to be managed prudently by officers of the  unions.\r\n\r\nIt  will  therefore  not  be desirable  for  an  undischarged\r\n\r\nbankrupt  to become a union officer and manage the  financial\r\n\r\naffairs of the union.  Clause 7 of the Bill amends section 30\r\n\r\nof  the  Trade  Unions  Act  to  disqualify  an  undischarged\r\n\r\nbankrupt from acting as a union officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Appointment of Union Trustees</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Act, all union properties, either movable or\r\n\r\nimmovable,  have to be controlled and vested in the  trustees\r\n\r\nfor the use and benefit of the union and its members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appointment or election of the trustees and the\r\n\r\nfilling of these vacancies are determined by the union rules.\r\n\r\nAs unions accumulate financial reserves and other assets, the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  of  union  trustees  have  become  heavier.\r\n\r\nClause  13 of the Bill amends section 43 of the Trade  Unions\r\n\r\nAct  to  disqualify  an undischarged bankrupt  and  a  person\r\n\r\nconvicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty or  any\r\n\r\nother  offence, which renders him unfit from  being  a  union\r\n\r\ntrustee.  We should ensure that only persons of unimpeachable\r\n\r\ncharacter and integrity hold such important position  in  the\r\n\r\nunions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Freeze on Union Funds</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the existing Act, the Minister is empowered\r\n\r\nto  direct  in  writing  a freeze on union  funds  during  an\r\n\r\ninvestigation by a public authority into the improper use  or\r\n\r\nmisapplication  of the funds of a trade union  under  section\r\n\r\n16.   However,  the  existing provision does  not  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration   funds  that  are  kept  in  other   financial\r\n\r\ninstitution besides banks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill addresses this inadequacy by\r\n\r\namending  section 16 of the Act to replace  the  word  \"bank\"\r\n\r\nwith  the words \"financial institution\".  The term \"financial\r\n\r\ninstitution\"  has  been defined to mean \"a  bank,  a  finance\r\n\r\ncompany  or any co-operative society carrying on the business\r\n\r\nof  managing and investing funds.\"  It will ensure that  when\r\n\r\nthe  situation  calls for a freeze, all of a  union's  assets\r\n\r\nwill be protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Purchase of Land and Building</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 46 of the Trade Unions Act allows a trade union\r\n\r\nto purchase or lease in its trustees' name any land exceeding\r\n\r\n4,047  square  metres in size provided it  has  obtained  the\r\n\r\napproval  of  the  Minister.  There is no  compelling  reason\r\n\r\ntoday for us to restrict purchases of land based on its plot-size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, clause 14 of the Bill will repeal and re-enact\r\n\r\nsection  46  of  the  Act  to  remove  the  requirement   for\r\n\r\nMinister's approval in the purchase of land where  the  plot-size  exceeds 4,047 square metres.  It will also allow  trade\r\n\r\nunions  to  purchase  or lease any land or  building  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore  provided  the  union has  obtained  the  requisite\r\n\r\nconsent of its members or delegates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary for the union to obtain a clear mandate\r\n\r\nbefore  the  purchase  of  an overseas  property  as  such  a\r\n\r\npurchase  may carry a certain amount of risk due to  economic\r\n\r\nand  political  uncertainties  apart  from  foreign  exchange\r\n\r\nfluctuations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Application of Union Funds</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, section 47 of the Act prohibits a union\r\n\r\nfrom using money received from its members or (in the case\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  a federation) its constituent trade unions, for a purpose\r\n\r\nother  than the purpose for which it is given.  Clause 15  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill amends section 47 of the Act to provide that it can\r\n\r\ndo  so where the requisite consent has been obtained from its\r\n\r\nmembers or delegates.  This will provide greater scope for  a\r\n\r\nunion  to  utilise  its  reserves  without  compromising  the\r\n\r\ninterest of its members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Penalties</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it may sound a bit jarring in the light\r\n\r\nof  peaceful industrial relations climate and the  close  co-operation prevailing between the tripartite partners, namely,\r\n\r\nthe  trade union representing the workers, employers and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, for us to talk about enhancing penalties  imposed\r\n\r\nunder  the  Trade Unions Act.  However, we feel  that  it  is\r\n\r\ntimely  for  a thorough review so that the penalties  imposed\r\n\r\nunder the Act would reflect the severity of the offences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have lived through the difficult periods of\r\n\r\nthe  50s  and  60s would recall that strikes  were  prevalent\r\n\r\nthen.   This  resulted in the loss of thousands of  otherwise\r\n\r\nproductive  man-days.   The  social  disorder  crippled   the\r\n\r\neconomy   and  caused  tremendous  hardship  to  the  people.\r\n\r\nAlthough  we have been almost strike-free for more  than  two\r\n\r\ndecades,  we  should constantly guard against this  brand  of\r\n\r\ntrade unionism so as to avoid its damaging effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties imposed under the Act had remained\r\n\r\nunchanged for many years and are now no longer comparable  to\r\n\r\nthose  for offences of a similar nature found in other  laws.\r\n\r\nTake,  for  example, the offence under section 27(3)  of  the\r\n\r\nTrade Unions Act where any union member who takes part in  an\r\n\r\nillegal  industrial action shall be guilty of an offence  and\r\n\r\nshall  on  conviction  be fined a sum not  exceeding  $1,000.\r\n\r\nThis  offence is no less severe when compared to the  offence\r\n\r\nunder  section  5(1) of the Trade Disputes  Act  (Cap.  331).\r\n\r\nUnder  this provision, ie, the Trade Disputes Act, any person\r\n\r\nwho participates in an illegal industrial action can be fined\r\n\r\na sum not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexceeding  six  months  or  to both.   So  you  can  see  the\r\n\r\ndiscrepancy  -  a  union member taking  part  in  an  illegal\r\n\r\nindustrial  action  only  faces a penalty  of  a  maximum  of\r\n\r\n$1,000, whereas any other worker, meaning a non-union member,\r\n\r\nwho  takes  part in an industrial dispute illegally  faces  a\r\n\r\nmuch  more severe penalty which may or may not include a term\r\n\r\nof   imprisonment.   Hence,  we  have  to  rationalise  these\r\n\r\ndifferences.   Clause 6 of the Bill therefore  increases  the\r\n\r\nfine  for  this  offence  from  $1,000  to  $2,000  and  also\r\n\r\nincreases  the fines for other offences under section  27  of\r\n\r\nthe Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, clauses 10, 16 and 18 to 21 of the Bill seek\r\n\r\nto  increase the amount of fines spelt out in sections 37, 53\r\n\r\nand 56 to 59 of the Act respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 of the Bill introduces a new section to grant\r\n\r\ndiscretionary  powers to the Registrar  to  accept  from  any\r\n\r\nperson  or the trade union reasonably suspected of committing\r\n\r\nan  offence a compound fine for a sum not exceeding $200  for\r\n\r\nevery  offence.

They will also enable our trade\r\n\r\nunions  to  respond  to  changing  environment  and  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of information technology to better meet the  needs\r\n\r\nof their members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, over the past one year, from the newspapers and\r\n\r\nthe  television, we read and heard a lot of news of companies\r\n\r\ninvolved in mergers,  restructuring or  buying over.    These\r\n\r\nmergers, restructuring and buying over  will affect not  only\r\n\r\nthe  workers  but  also the structure and operations  of  the\r\n\r\nunions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past one year, many trade unions were also\r\n\r\namalgamated or in the process of amalgamation.  As a  result,\r\n\r\nthese unions will have to change their names to reflect their\r\n\r\nnew  status,  otherwise  the  old  names  may  no  longer  be\r\n\r\nrelevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the NTUC supports this amendment,\r\n\r\nparticularly the repeal and re-enactment of sections  33  and\r\n\r\n34  of  the Trade Unions Act.  Under the existing provisions,\r\n\r\nthe  consent  of  two-thirds of the total membership  of  the\r\n\r\nunion  is  required  if it wants to change  its  name.   Just\r\n\r\nimagine,  if  you have a union with 6,000 members,  you  will\r\n\r\nneed  to  have 4,000 members voting in favour of the proposed\r\n\r\nchange.  With so many workers needed to go to the ballot, the\r\n\r\nfactories  may  have to shut down, and many production  hours\r\n\r\nwill  be  lost.  At the same time, if the unions were  to  be\r\n\r\namalgamated,  you need 50% of the members to vote,  of  which\r\n\r\n60% must vote in favour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo  if you have 6,000 members, you would need 3,000 people to\r\n\r\nvote. This is certainly a waste of resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, many unions have adopted the delegates\r\n\r\nconference   system   whereby  the   ordinary   members   are\r\n\r\nrepresented  by  their branch leaders  as  delegates  in  the\r\n\r\nunions'  conferences where resolutions can be carried   by  a\r\n\r\nsimple majority for decisions to be made.  As such, with  the\r\n\r\nnew  sections  33  and  34,  the delegates  can   attend  the\r\n\r\nmeetings on behalf of the general members, and decisions such\r\n\r\nas  amalgamation or change of name can be made  by  a  simple\r\n\r\nmajority of votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 43 of the principal Act\r\n\r\nconcerns the appointment of the trustees of trade unions.  We\r\n\r\nall  know  that  the  trustees of the trade  unions  have  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  not only the interest of the workers but  also  to\r\n\r\nprotect   the  assets  of  the  trade  unions.   Under   this\r\n\r\namendment, undischarged bankrupts are not  allowed to  become\r\n\r\ntrustees.   The National Trades Union Congress supports  this\r\n\r\namendment. I do not think anyone would oppose this amendment.\r\n\r\nThose  who  are undischarged bankrupts are unable to  resolve\r\n\r\ntheir own financial problems.  How would they be in the right\r\n\r\nframe  of  mind  to safeguard and protect the assets  of  the\r\n\r\nunion?   In  addition,  under the amendment, anyone  who  has\r\n\r\nbeen  convicted of an offence involving fraud  or  dishonesty\r\n\r\nshall  be  disqualified as a trustee of the  union.  This  is\r\n\r\nobvious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC supports the spirit of this amendment because\r\n\r\nfirstly  it  safeguards the assets of the trade  unions  and,\r\n\r\nsecondly, it upholds the reputation of the union leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at\r\n\r\npresent,  undischarged bankrupts can  hold  office  in  trade\r\n\r\nunions.   Apart from the requirement of age and  nationality,\r\n\r\nthe  only  other restriction imposed on any office holder  is\r\n\r\nthat  he  should  not  have  any prior  criminal  conviction,\r\n\r\nespecially  those  involving  criminal  breach  of  trust  or\r\n\r\ncriminal intimidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the amendment of sections 30 and 43 to\r\n\r\ndisqualify  undischarged bankrupts  from  holding  office  in\r\n\r\ntrade unions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor being appointed as trustees to the union.  This is in line\r\n\r\nwith  other  legislation, such as the Companies Act  and  the\r\n\r\nSocieties  Act,  which impose similar restriction  on  office\r\n\r\nbearers.   Our  trade union movement supports this  amendment\r\n\r\nwhich  arose  partly because of our own request made  in  the\r\n\r\npast.  It gives greater protection of trade union funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the current provision, any union that wishes\r\n\r\nto  buy  or  lease any land which is more than  4,047  square\r\n\r\nmetres  must  first obtain the consent of  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nManpower.   With  the new amendment, there is no  restriction\r\n\r\nimposed  on unions on the purchase or lease of local land  of\r\n\r\nany  size.   However,  for  purchase  or  lease  of  overseas\r\n\r\nproperty,  the consent of the union members or  delegates  is\r\n\r\nnow  required.  Although this is a new restriction,  it  will\r\n\r\naccord  better  protection  to members  from  risky  overseas\r\n\r\ninvestments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the labour movement, I also welcome the\r\n\r\namendment  on  change in application of  union  funds.   This\r\n\r\namendment  allows the trade unions to use the money  received\r\n\r\nfrom  compulsory contributions for purposes other than  those\r\n\r\noriginally intended.  To make such a change, unions need only\r\n\r\nto  seek the consent of their delegates, instead of having to\r\n\r\nget  all  members'  consent as is currently  provided.   This\r\n\r\namendment  was  made  at  the  request  of  NTUC  as  it   is\r\n\r\nadministratively more convenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment also allows unions to change their\r\n\r\nfinancial year to coincide with the calendar year rather than\r\n\r\nstick rigidly to the current financial year from 1st April to\r\n\r\n31st  March.  The labour movement supports this change as  it\r\n\r\naffords more flexibility into the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment also allows for the register of trade\r\n\r\nunions to be kept and maintained in an electronic form.   The\r\n\r\nlabour  movement supports the change as this facilitates  the\r\n\r\nglobal  trend  towards data entry and captured in  electronic\r\n\r\nform rather than in paper form only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the review of penalties is long overdue as the\r\n\r\nexisting fines imposed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  not been reviewed for more than 30 years.  However,  by\r\n\r\nlooking  at purely the rate of increase, which in some  cases\r\n\r\nby  100%,  it is a significant jump.  And I hope the Minister\r\n\r\ncould clarify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the whole, these proposed amendments\r\n\r\nmerely make technical modification to refine the system.   It\r\n\r\nprovides  greater flexibility for unions with  these  changes\r\n\r\nand should therefore be supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I agree with the Minister that this  Bill\r\n\r\nwill  make  it easier for unions to operate.  Unionists  must\r\n\r\ntherefore  welcome  the amendments as they  reflect  changing\r\n\r\ntimes and ensure the quality of the movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of changing times are the use of IT to maintain\r\n\r\nrecords  and  union register; reflecting the  new  investment\r\n\r\nclimate  of opportunities in the greater flexibility  in  the\r\n\r\napplication  of union funds, more leeway in the  purchase  of\r\n\r\nland  and building; and also to make it easier for unions  to\r\n\r\nchange  names or amalgamate, just as corporations  do.   This\r\n\r\nBill will enable unions to respond more quickly to changes in\r\n\r\ntheir operating environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also support the increase in fines, because it\r\n\r\nalso reflects changing times, and it is just like keeping  up\r\n\r\nwith  times.  The quality of the movement would also  improve\r\n\r\nthe  imposition of additional disqualifications on those  who\r\n\r\nwant to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhold  union  office  or  become trustees.  I  do  not  intend\r\n\r\nspecifically  to go through the details of the Bill,  because\r\n\r\nit was adequately covered by the previous two Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation has increased the power of management\r\n\r\nrelative  to  labour on a world scale.  Management  seems  to\r\n\r\nhave more options whilst labour has a smaller voice globally.\r\n\r\nUnless  trade  unions can remain an effective voice  for  the\r\n\r\nsmall  man, frustration in the workplace can threaten  social\r\n\r\ncohesion  in the long run.  Strong trade unions are therefore\r\n\r\ngood  for the country.  In this context, I wish to thank  the\r\n\r\nMinister for acknowledging the contribution of unions in  the\r\n\r\neconomic and social progress of Singapore, as well as  saying\r\n\r\nthat in the long run, he supports the growth of a responsible\r\n\r\nand  strong  trade union movement in Singapore.  I  therefore\r\n\r\nsupport  these  moves that would strengthen the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement  and  therefore also support the amendments  in  the\r\n\r\nBill.   However, my only complaint is that I wish there  were\r\n\r\nmore   amendments,  which  reflect  the  changing  employment\r\n\r\npatterns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, a \"normal\" employment relationship involved\r\n\r\na full-time job with a specific employer and usually had some\r\n\r\nlong-term stability.  We saw attempts in the past to  promote\r\n\r\ncompany   loyalty,  a  closer  nexus  between   workers   and\r\n\r\nemployers, and even a shared common destiny. Therefore,  this\r\n\r\n\"normal\"  worker was also a normal union member or  a  normal\r\n\r\npotential union member, and he was a full-time employee whose\r\n\r\nemployment relationship was not casual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, things have changed so much. It is recognised\r\n\r\nthat atypical employment situations are increasingly becoming\r\n\r\ntypical.   Part-time work, short-term and casual  employment,\r\n\r\nagency  work, self-employment, work from home, contract  work\r\n\r\nand, of course, unemployment, are all now more common.  Down-sizing  and  structural shifts in sectoral  and  occupational\r\n\r\ndistribution, changing technologies and increased use  of  IT\r\n\r\nhave added to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  changes.  The net result is increased uncertainty  and\r\n\r\nambiguity for the worker.  The contract of service, which  is\r\n\r\nused in the Trade Unions Act, to define a worker is more  and\r\n\r\nmore  being  substituted in the workplace with  contract  for\r\n\r\nservice,  as employers seek to lower cost with less manpower,\r\n\r\nto  save  on  CPF  contributions, fringe benefits  and  other\r\n\r\nbenefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to illustrate this point. The New York Times of\r\n\r\n16th  February carried an article entitled \"Who is the  boss?\r\n\r\nWho  is a worker?\", reported some interesting cases. One  was\r\n\r\nof  temporary workers successfully suing and getting benefits\r\n\r\nof  full-time  workers. Another was that the New  York  State\r\n\r\nAttorney-General is trying to force Manhattan food stalls  to\r\n\r\npay  minimum  wage to delivery people employed  from  another\r\n\r\ncompany.   There is even debate on whether health and  safety\r\n\r\nstandards  for  offices should apply to home offices.   These\r\n\r\ncases, as illustrated, show that United States laws have  not\r\n\r\nkept up with changes in the workplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore too, there are many workers with a contract\r\n\r\nfor  service instead of a contract of service working for one\r\n\r\nemployer. The work they do can be considered an integral part\r\n\r\nof  the  business  and  the employer is able  to  discipline,\r\n\r\ndismiss and give them incentives.  In the United States, non-governmental organisations, with the support of trade unions,\r\n\r\nare  emerging  as  champions for  the  cause  of  workers  in\r\n\r\natypical  employment.   The  question  I  ask  is:   who   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  represent this growing group  of  workers?\r\n\r\nShould  they  bring their problems to Court  and  let  Judges\r\n\r\ndecide?   In  that  case, do we want to see  an  increase  in\r\n\r\nlitigation,  or  do  we want to see NGOs agitating  on  their\r\n\r\nbehalf?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all these, I would therefore like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  take some proactive steps to enable  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement to cover this type of workers.   By  bringing\r\n\r\nthem within our existing industrial relations system, it will\r\n\r\nreduce  social  tensions and enhance  social  cohesion.  This\r\n\r\nwould  also  ensure  that our tripartite  system,  which  has\r\n\r\nserved us\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery  well  in  the  past, will stand the test  of  time  and\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  serve  in the best interests  of  workers,  the\r\n\r\nemployers and their unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I join\r\n\r\nmy former colleagues from NTUC in supporting this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister had pointed out earlier, a major review\r\n\r\nof  the  Trade Unions Act was carried out way back  in  1982.\r\n\r\nAlthough  this  Bill should have been introduced  some  years\r\n\r\nago,  it  is,  nevertheless, timely  that  the  Ministry  has\r\n\r\nbrought to the fore some major amendments to the Trade Unions\r\n\r\nAct,  especially  because in the last few years,  there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  significant  changes and this changed circumstances  in\r\n\r\nthe administration of trade unions in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I just want to touch on two or three key points in\r\n\r\nthis  amendment Bill. First, the delegate system, as  pointed\r\n\r\nout  in sections 33 and 34.  As Mr Seng Han Thong has pointed\r\n\r\nout,  many unions, for many years now, have been facing  this\r\n\r\nproblem   of   having   annual  ordinary   members   meeting,\r\n\r\nparticularly unions like AUPE, UWEEI, SMMWU, SEAHSU and  many\r\n\r\nothers.   They have as many as 30,000 members,  and  to  have\r\n\r\n30,000  members to come for a meeting is an impossible  thing\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  Even the World Trade Centre conference  halls\r\n\r\ncannot hold these people.  Therefore, they had to work within\r\n\r\ntheir  union  constitution to come  out  with  this  delegate\r\n\r\nsystem,  and  I  am  very  pleased  that  the  Ministry   now\r\n\r\nrecognises  this  delegate system and has actually  empowered\r\n\r\nmore provisions through this delegate system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking broadly, globally there have been tremendous\r\n\r\nchanges,  particularly  in  the  corporate  world  -  company\r\n\r\nglobalisation, corporate restructuring, together with some of\r\n\r\nthe  changes  in  Singapore, for example, corporatisation  of\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards  and other Government  bodies,  going  from\r\n\r\ncorporatisation to privatisation like PSA. All these have led\r\n\r\nto  major  impacts on the way the unions organise  themselves\r\n\r\nand  has therefore made it a necessity to have a major  union\r\n\r\nrestructuring through either dissolution of some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  older unions, or having amalgamation of unions,  new\r\n\r\nstatutory board employee unions and also the registration  of\r\n\r\nnew unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore appropriate that the delegate system is\r\n\r\nbeing  recognised  and extended to simplify  vote  taking  by\r\n\r\nallowing decisions on the change of union names, amalgamation\r\n\r\nof  unions  and in the change of use of union  funds.   I  am\r\n\r\nconfident that the larger unions particularly will find  this\r\n\r\na more efficient and effective means for decision-making.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only question I have in this regard to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister is:  why is there a provision to say that there is a\r\n\r\nneed  for  a two-thirds vote delegate system, while a  simple\r\n\r\nmajority  is  needed  for an ordinary  members'  meeting?   I\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  it  is  a form of safeguard,  especially  in\r\n\r\ntoday's context where most unions are well-run, but you never\r\n\r\nknow  something in the future.  But I want to know  why  this\r\n\r\nmagic number of two-thirds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, all these changes have come about\r\n\r\nbecause of the changing corporate manpower landscape  due  to\r\n\r\nglobalisation, technology and corporate restructuring and  so\r\n\r\non.  But these changes and response, while it is necessary, I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  not  sufficient.  I  feel  that  corresponding\r\n\r\nchanges  that relate to the unionisation of a wider range  of\r\n\r\nemployees  to join rank-and-file unions may be necessary  and\r\n\r\nthe  Nominated  Member of Parliament, Mr Thomas  Thomas,  has\r\n\r\ntouched  on  this  point.   I think  the  Ministry  needs  to\r\n\r\nexamine,   for  example,  section  16(3)  of  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  Act  and look at a major review of  this  section.\r\n\r\nAnd the reason is as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Thomas has pointed out, changing job designations,\r\n\r\njob  re-designs,  job enrichment and many other  changes  for\r\n\r\nemployees necessitate a complete review as to who  can  be  a\r\n\r\nunion  member. Sir, with the advent of the knowledge economy,\r\n\r\nor  knowledge-based economy, as we call it in  Singapore,  it\r\n\r\nhas blurred the distinction between a worker and a manager in\r\n\r\ntoday's context.  I remember the Trade and Industry Minister,\r\n\r\nBG\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge  Yeo,  had  some two or three years  ago,  at  a  NTUC\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Delegates Conference, made a keynote  address.   He\r\n\r\nhad  said  that in the knowledge economy, everyone, including\r\n\r\nmanagers,  and  even  the CEO, is a  knowledge  worker.   So,\r\n\r\neveryone is a worker.  So, who can join a union?  And in this\r\n\r\ncontext  of a rapidly changing knowledge economy, and  it  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that  we ourselves are very much involved  through\r\n\r\nSingapore 21 and many of the moves that Dr Tony Tan  and  his\r\n\r\ncommittee are looking at, we would certainly need to take  it\r\n\r\na  step to the unions to see how union membership has  to  be\r\n\r\nextended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I may still sound like a unionist who had spoken\r\n\r\nfor  workers  many  times in this House, though  I  have  now\r\n\r\nreturned back to the corporate world.  This is because of the\r\n\r\nimpact  that  NTUC had made on me during my  stint  there,  a\r\n\r\ncertain  sense of passion for helping workers and unions.   I\r\n\r\nwant  to  use my personal experience, both in the  union  and\r\n\r\nmanagement, to contribute in whatever small way to building a\r\n\r\nstronger tripartite model in the new knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point that I want to make here is that union\r\n\r\nmembership  and  collective  bargaining  rules  have  to   be\r\n\r\nrevamped  in  this context, and union membership  has  to  be\r\n\r\nbroadened   through  legislation,  not  just  by  convenience\r\n\r\nthrough  union constitutions or rules.  I therefore call  for\r\n\r\nfurther  amendments to the Trade Unions Act, as well  as  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Act, if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember some years ago, the Secretary-General of NTUC\r\n\r\nhad made this call to broaden union membership by proposing a\r\n\r\n80-20  rule,  meaning that in any organisation,  80%  of  the\r\n\r\nemployees  should be unionised.  This point has been  brought\r\n\r\nup many, many times in various forums where even the Minister\r\n\r\nhimself  was present and he felt at that point of  time  that\r\n\r\nthere  was no need to legislate.  But some years have  passed\r\n\r\nand I think with these amendments and with the change that is\r\n\r\ntaking place in our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neconomy, I think it is time to look at the legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to move on to some other amendment in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill   -   purchase of property.  Section 46  has  been\r\n\r\nrepealed and re-enacted to give greater flexibility to  trade\r\n\r\nunions  to  directly purchase properties  while  also  making\r\n\r\npossible  for  decision making through the  delegate  system.\r\n\r\nThis  change  will  certainly be welcomed by  the  unions,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  for at least two reasons.  Firstly, it  gives  them\r\n\r\nthe   direct  opportunity  to  own  and  develop  their   own\r\n\r\nbuildings,  to  give  unions a status  symbol  and  a  public\r\n\r\nrecognition that they truly deserve.  Secondly, it also gives\r\n\r\nall  their members more facilities within their own  premises\r\n\r\nfor  their  members  and  their  members'  families  to  use.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  takes  away the need to  work  through  other\r\n\r\nlabour institutions or labour foundations to achieve this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, in conclusion, I am generally pleased with\r\n\r\nthe  amendments put forth by the Minister for Manpower on the\r\n\r\nTrade  Unions  (Amendment) Bill, though I feel  more  can  be\r\n\r\ndone.   Some time ago, I made a call to the then Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour,  the  new Ministry of Manpower, to play a  more  pre-eminent role in labour related issues as NTUC had done.  I am\r\n\r\nvery  happy to note and acknowledge that during the past year\r\n\r\nor   so,   the  Ministry  of  Manpower  has  launched   major\r\n\r\ninitiatives and charted new directions for Singapore  through\r\n\r\nManpower  21  and Construction 21 and many other  initiatives\r\n\r\nlike  that.   These have become blueprints for  our  workers'\r\n\r\nfuture  and  for  the  future of all  Singaporeans.   Sir,  I\r\n\r\ncongratulate the Minister and the Permanent Secretary and his\r\n\r\nteam for a job well done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have\r\n\r\njust  one  simple  clarification to seek from  the  Minister.\r\n\r\nThis  is  on  the  amendment to section 43.   This  amendment\r\n\r\nexcluded  two classes of individuals from holding  office  of\r\n\r\ntrustee   of  a  trade  union.   One  group  is  undischarged\r\n\r\nbankrupts.   The  second  group is individuals  convicted  of\r\n\r\nfraud, dishonesty or any other offence which the Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsiders  them unfit to be a trustee.  Yet, for  the  second\r\n\r\ngroup of individuals, there is a clause which says, \"with the\r\n\r\napproval  of the Minister.\"  My question to the Minister  is:\r\n\r\nwhy  are  undischarged bankrupts considered more  undesirable\r\n\r\nthan  other  individuals who have been  convicted  of  fraud,\r\n\r\ndishonesty  or other offences which render them unfit  to  be\r\n\r\ntrustees?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the\r\n\r\nOrder Paper for today be exempted at this day's sitting  from\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  of Standing Order No. 1.  -   [Dr  Lee  Boon\r\n\r\nYang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TRADE UNIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would like\r\n\r\nto  thank all the Members who have spoken, in particular,  Mr\r\n\r\nSeng  Han  Thong,  Mr  Yeo  Guat  Kwang,  Mr  Thomas  and  Mr\r\n\r\nSinnakaruppan,  for their strong support  of  the  amendments\r\n\r\nintroduced in this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said in my Second Reading speech, this Bill\r\n\r\nhad  gone  through  a  long process of  discussion  with  the\r\n\r\nNational  Trades  Union Congress and the  Singapore  National\r\n\r\nEmployers' Federation.  So it is not a unilateral decision on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of  the  Ministry to make these  amendments.   The\r\n\r\namendments were arrived at after a thorough discussion and in\r\n\r\nconsultation  with  all  the parties  that  are  involved  in\r\n\r\nforging  a stronger, more cooperative, more productive,  more\r\n\r\nfruitful industrial relations in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked for some clarifications with\r\n\r\nregard  to the penalties.  He generally supported the  review\r\n\r\nof  penalties.  He said that the review of penalties is  long\r\n\r\noverdue, but he saw the increases in some cases going  up  to\r\n\r\n100%  and  he  felt that there is a need to  clarify  why  we\r\n\r\nactually have to make such a steep increase in the penalties.\r\n\r\nLet me reiterate that most of these penalties in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  existing  Act were set long ago, even  before  the  1982\r\n\r\nreview  of  the present Trade Unions Act.  Some of them  date\r\n\r\nback  to  1952.  I have given an example in my Second Reading\r\n\r\nspeech   about   union  members  participating   in   illegal\r\n\r\nindustrial  action  paying a much  smaller  fine  of  $1,000,\r\n\r\ncompared  to  another  worker  who  participates  in  illegal\r\n\r\nindustrial action and being charged under the Trade  Disputes\r\n\r\nAct having to pay a much heavier fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members some other examples of why this long\r\n\r\noverdue  review of penalties justifies raising some penalties\r\n\r\nby  more than 100%.  For example, the penalty of giving false\r\n\r\ninformation  relating  to  trade  unions.    This  is   under\r\n\r\nexisting section 53(6).  It is a fine not exceeding  $200  or\r\n\r\nan  imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both\r\n\r\nfine  and imprisonment, in other words, basically, $200  fine\r\n\r\nand  maybe  imprisonment.  But in the case  of  the  existing\r\n\r\nSocieties  Act, the fine for furnishing false information  is\r\n\r\n$1,000.   In the case of the Employment Act, an employer  who\r\n\r\nfurnishes  false information would be subjected to a  maximum\r\n\r\nfine  of $1,000 and/or up to six months of imprisonment.   In\r\n\r\nthe  case  of the Factories Act, a similar offence of  giving\r\n\r\nfalse  information carries a maximum fine of $2,000 and/or  6\r\n\r\nmonths of imprisonment.  So we have to look at the review  of\r\n\r\nthe  fines  in totality of the legal framework.  We  have  to\r\n\r\nlook  at  other legislation and see what level of  fines  are\r\n\r\nbeing  imposed, and not just look at a particular offence  in\r\n\r\nthe Trade Unions Act and see whether this penalty of $200 has\r\n\r\nnow   been  increased,  as  in  the  case  of  giving   false\r\n\r\ninformation.   We are proposing under clause  16(c)  of  this\r\n\r\nBill  to  raise the fine from $200 to $2,000.  It looks  like\r\n\r\npercentage-wise, it is a very steep increase indeed,  but  we\r\n\r\nhave  to look at it historically.  The $200 fine was set  way\r\n\r\nback  in  the  50s  and today, the overall  climate  and  the\r\n\r\noverall  level  of fines in other legislation  would  justify\r\n\r\nsuch  an  increase to $2,000 for giving false information  to\r\n\r\nthe Registrar of Trade Unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas supported the amendment including the increase\r\n\r\nin fines which reflects the changing times.  I agree with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhim.   That  was  what I have just been explaining.   But  he\r\n\r\nasked  whether  we  could, in fact, make more  amendments  in\r\n\r\norder  to  widen the reach of the Trade Unions Act,  a  point\r\n\r\nwhich  Mr  Sinnakaruppan also made.  Specifically, Mr  Thomas\r\n\r\nmentioned that in the past the trade unions drew its  members\r\n\r\nfrom  the  pool  of  perhaps  mainly  full-time  blue  collar\r\n\r\nworkers,  and  this is changing.  There is  emerging  in  the\r\n\r\nworkforce  part-time workers and there is  increasing  highly\r\n\r\nskilled  technical  and  also more white  collar  work  being\r\n\r\ngenerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with him that there is a change in workers'\r\n\r\nprofile.   As  to whether we should, in fact, now  widen  the\r\n\r\nTrade  Unions  Act to cover non-employees,  in  other  words,\r\n\r\npeople who are not working under a contract of service,  this\r\n\r\nis  something that at this juncture, we feel that it has  not\r\n\r\nreached  the  stage  and it is not necessary  to  extend  the\r\n\r\ncoverage  in this manner.  The Trade Unions Act will,  as  it\r\n\r\nstands,  cover persons who work under a contract of  service.\r\n\r\nIn   other   words,   there  is  a  direct  employer/employee\r\n\r\nrelationship.   Mr   Thomas referred to a group  of  contract\r\n\r\nworkers because companies are increasingly out-sourcing  some\r\n\r\nof  their  services to outside providers  of  labour.   While\r\n\r\nthere is no existing contract of service relation between the\r\n\r\nworker  and  the  ultimate employer,  there  may  well  be  a\r\n\r\ncontract  of  service relation between  the  worker  and  the\r\n\r\norganisation  that provides the out-source service.   So,  in\r\n\r\nfact, such workers can also be covered if they have an actual\r\n\r\ncontract  of  service  with  their  employers  in  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance.   It  is  not  as  if  this  group  of  workers  is\r\n\r\ncompletely omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is on part-time workers. Part-time\r\n\r\nworkers  can also become union members, as long as they  have\r\n\r\nan  actual contract of service.  For instance, there are many\r\n\r\npart-time  workers in the catering and food service industry.\r\n\r\nThere  are  part-time workers in the departmental stores  and\r\n\r\nsupermarkets.  There are even part-time workers in hospitals.\r\n\r\nAs long as they have a contract of service, there is an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployer  and employee relationship between the employer  and\r\n\r\nthe  worker, they come under the ambit of the existing  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions  Act,  and they can become a full member  of  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan's point is about expanding the outreach\r\n\r\nand  who  can be a member.  The answer is that, in fact,  all\r\n\r\nworkers,  as  I have just explained, who have a  contract  of\r\n\r\nservice  with  the employer can be a union member,  and  that\r\n\r\ncovers nearly everyone, including executives.  Executives can\r\n\r\nbecome members of a trade union.  The only restriction is the\r\n\r\nrestriction  which  exists in the Industrial  Relations  Act,\r\n\r\nwhich  seeks to avoid a conflict of interest where executives\r\n\r\nor management staff of a company join the rank-and-file union\r\n\r\nof the same company.  In fact, executives can all form unions\r\n\r\nof  executives  and be full members of unions of  executives.\r\n\r\nWe  have to be careful when executives join the rank-and-file\r\n\r\nunion, because there is always this potential of conflict  of\r\n\r\ninterest.   In  fact,  this is an area that  my  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nactively studying.  We have established a committee  to  work\r\n\r\ntogether  with  NTUC  and the Singapore  National  Employers'\r\n\r\nFederation to look into how we can widen the definition,  how\r\n\r\nwe can amend section 16(3) of the Industrial Relations Act to\r\n\r\nensure  that  we  only exclude that group of  executives  who\r\n\r\ngenuinely face the possibility of a conflict of interest, and\r\n\r\nthat  we  do  not just bluntly exclude a large group  of  the\r\n\r\nmiddle level executives from joining the rank-and-file union.\r\n\r\nThe  committee is, in fact, in progress.  They  are  studying\r\n\r\nthis  issue.   I  hope  that they will be  able  to  reach  a\r\n\r\nconsensus and make their recommendations for consideration by\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry.  And in due course, we may well have  to  amend\r\n\r\nthe Industrial Relations Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 80:20 rule, we have discussed this before. It\r\n\r\ndepends  on  the nature of work of the company.   If  we  are\r\n\r\ntalking of a company that is very labour intensive, then   it\r\n\r\nmay  well go beyond 80:20.  It may well be 90:10.  But  in  a\r\n\r\ncompany   that  is  less  labour  intensive,  more  knowledge\r\n\r\nintensive,  we may end up seeing a situation  of  40:60.   So\r\n\r\nfixing it at 80:20 is introducing an element of rigidity,  my\r\n\r\nview has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen that we will continue to assist NTUC to reach out to all\r\n\r\nworkers  and companies and assist NTUC in its effort to  seek\r\n\r\nrecognition,  and  to represent as many workers  as  possible\r\n\r\nwithout  having to adopt a fixed rule of whether it is  80:20\r\n\r\nor  whatever it is.  I think we have to look at each  company\r\n\r\non  its own, the profile of its workforce, and therefore  try\r\n\r\nto  recruit  as  many  of the workers  who  are  eligible  as\r\n\r\npossible  to  join  the union, rather than  set  ourselves  a\r\n\r\ntarget, which may not be representative or reflective of  the\r\n\r\nprofile of the workforce in that particular company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to refer to Dr Wang's query. This\r\n\r\nis   clause  13  which  amends  section  43  to  exclude   an\r\n\r\nundischarged  bankrupt from being appointed or serving  as  a\r\n\r\ntrustee  of a trade union.  In the case of a person  who  has\r\n\r\nbeen  convicted of an offence, there is a provision here that\r\n\r\nallows  the  Minister to exercise judgment.  In  some  cases,\r\n\r\nsome  people  may  have  a very old  conviction  and  in  the\r\n\r\nintervening  years since his conviction he has shown  himself\r\n\r\nto  be  an  honest, upright citizen, somebody  who  has  been\r\n\r\nreformed  and who can now be trusted to serve a  trade  union\r\n\r\nand  its  workers  in this capacity as a trustee.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nprovision  to  ensure  that we do not just  bluntly  adopt  a\r\n\r\nposition  against people who have an old criminal  conviction\r\n\r\nfor dishonesty or fraud.  So we give people a chance.  If  he\r\n\r\nmakes  a  genuine  effort to reform and  not  commit  further\r\n\r\noffences in the intervening years, we may not want to hold it\r\n\r\nagainst him, unless the offence, in the first instance, was a\r\n\r\nvery  serious  offence which raised strong doubts  about  the\r\n\r\nperson's   character.   So  we  will  need   to   have   this\r\n\r\nflexibility, otherwise it is too rigid. Somebody with an  old\r\n\r\noffence going back 25 years and we say, \"No, you cannot be  a\r\n\r\ntrustee.\"  In the meantime, he has risen through his  effort.\r\n\r\nHe  has  become  a successful and prosperous businessman  and\r\n\r\ncontributed  both to union and community work.  And  now  you\r\n\r\nsay  he  cannot be a trustee because of this old offence.   I\r\n\r\nthink that will be a bit too rigid.  Whereas in the case of a\r\n\r\nbankrupt,  of  course,  we are saying,  he  is  a  discharged\r\n\r\nbankrupt.  The moment he has discharged his bankruptcy, he is\r\n\r\nno longer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncaught  by  this  particular section  43(1A).   I  hope  that\r\n\r\nclarifies the position for Dr Wang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, can I just clarify as well as\r\n\r\nseek  clarification?   When  I  talked  about  expanding  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  workman,  in the present  Trade  Unions  Act,\r\n\r\n\"workman\" is somebody who enters or works under a service  of\r\n\r\ncontract  or  apprenticeship.  That is all.  But  before  the\r\n\r\n1982 amendment, the definition was slightly wider.  It talked\r\n\r\nabout  any workman who had entered or worked under a contract\r\n\r\nwith  an  employer, whether the contract was  a  contract  of\r\n\r\nservice  or  a contract personally to execute any  work.   In\r\n\r\nother  words, during those times, around 1982,  most  of  the\r\n\r\nregular  sort of employment relationship existed  but  before\r\n\r\nthat,  there  were  many  people who were  self-employed  but\r\n\r\nactually  worked for just one employer.  I am trying  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  in  downsizing  and outsourcing, there  are  also  many\r\n\r\npeople  who actually just work for one employer, and who  are\r\n\r\nnot  in a position of bargaining and they sometimes need  the\r\n\r\ncollective  power  of the trade unions to  ensure  a  bit  of\r\n\r\nequity  in  the labour market.  There are such categories  of\r\n\r\npeople.   It could be the couriers and taxi drivers,  and  we\r\n\r\nalso need to reach out to those groups of people.  I ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to understand this position as well as to  look  at\r\n\r\nthe law to bring these people in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is correct that\r\n\r\nprior to 1982, the Trade Unions Act allowed non-employees  or\r\n\r\nthe  self-employed to become members of a union.   Precisely,\r\n\r\nthis  situation  was not tenable that in  1982  the  law  was\r\n\r\namended to define a workman as a person who has entered  into\r\n\r\na contract of service with an employer regardless of how this\r\n\r\ncontract of service was written up and what are the terms. As\r\n\r\nlong  as  there is employer/employee relationship,  he  is  a\r\n\r\nworkman, he can join a union or form a union. During the 1982\r\n\r\ndebate  on the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill, the reason  was\r\n\r\nprovided for this exclusion.  I think the reason still exists\r\n\r\nand  it  is  still  relevant in today's  situation.   In  the\r\n\r\nabsence of an employer/employee relationship, there is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno   collective  bargaining  between  the  employee  and  the\r\n\r\nemployer,  between this worker who is actually a  free  agent\r\n\r\nworking on a contract for service with a particular company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas mentioned the example of a taxi driver. Who\r\n\r\nis  the  employer in this instance?  Is it  COMFORT?   Is  it\r\n\r\nTIBS?   There  is no employer/employee relationship  in  that\r\n\r\nsense  because  the  taxi  driver hires  the  taxi  from  the\r\n\r\ncompany.   Is the taxi driver himself an employer?  It  could\r\n\r\nwell  be, by his definition, because part of the time he gets\r\n\r\na relief driver to drive his taxi. So does that mean he is an\r\n\r\nemployer?  We can see that if we adopt that approach, we will\r\n\r\nreach very difficult and unsustainable positions.  So we have\r\n\r\ndecided that, as a rule, as long as he does not have a  fixed\r\n\r\ncontract    of   service,   where   there   is    no    clear\r\n\r\nemployer/employee relationship, he should not be covered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this. Even if we want to include the\r\n\r\nself-employed, they would not be able to avail themselves  of\r\n\r\na  conciliation  on  any trade dispute or reference  to  IAC,\r\n\r\nbecause  there is no employer/employee relationship on  which\r\n\r\nthey  can  refer  the  matter to the  Industrial  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt.  Each one is a free agent working on his own and  with\r\n\r\nhis  own  terms and conditions.  The employer exercises  very\r\n\r\nlittle  supervision  or  disciplinary  proceedings  over  the\r\n\r\nworker.   So it is very difficult to try to attempt to  cover\r\n\r\nthis  group.   In fact, it confers upon them no advantage  to\r\n\r\nbring them in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in 1982, it was argued that we should exclude\r\n\r\nthem. We have since then maintained this position.  I do  not\r\n\r\nthink the situation has changed so much between 1982 and  now\r\n\r\nthat  we  should go back there and re-examine  this  area  to\r\n\r\nbring  in the self-employed within the coverage of the  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.

I am very pleased  to  hear\r\n\r\nfrom  him  that  he  would look at reviewing  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Act and that a Review Committee has been formed  in\r\n\r\nhis  Ministry.   Sir, I am, as he has said,  fully  aware  of\r\n\r\nexecutive  unions and executives are able to  form  and  join\r\n\r\nunions.  All I am saying is that because of the change in ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Sinnakurappan, you are embarking on a new\r\n\r\nspeech.  Could you ask your question?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> The question is this: in his Review\r\n\r\nCommittee, I would like them to consider the executives being\r\n\r\npart of the rank and file union.  The leadership question  is\r\n\r\nan  important question to unions because today's trade unions\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  are  a  model for the  world  because  of  the\r\n\r\nleadership  that we have in our unions.  I think this  should\r\n\r\ncontinue  and, therefore, I would like to request  that  this\r\n\r\nReview Committee ensures that there are sufficient executives\r\n\r\nwho are part of this rank and file union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Precisely. In fact, the Committee\r\n\r\nthat  is  working  on it is looking at the ways  of  enabling\r\n\r\nexecutives of companies to join rank and file unions.   As  I\r\n\r\nsaid  earlier on, we have to address not just the concern  of\r\n\r\nNTUC in wanting to reach out to a wider group of workers  but\r\n\r\nalso  the  concerns of employers over this potential conflict\r\n\r\nof  interest.   The Committee will certainly consider,  where\r\n\r\nthere is no real potential for conflict of interest, allowing\r\n\r\nexecutives  to  join the rank and file unions  and  even,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, where they have sufficient support, to  serve  the\r\n\r\nunion in a leadership position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MEDICAL AND ELDERLY CARE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ENDOWMENT SCHEMES BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.58 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  beg  to  move, \"That the Bill be now read  a  Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has decided to introduce a new\r\n\r\nendowment  fund  to  finance operating subsidies  to  nursing\r\n\r\nhomes  run by Voluntary Welfare Organisations, or VWOs.  This\r\n\r\nBill  is  to repeal the Medical Endowment Scheme Act and  re-enact  it  as the Medical and Elderly Care Endowment  Schemes\r\n\r\nAct, to set up this new endowment fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Need for step-down care increases as population ages</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our population is rapidly ageing. Today, we have about\r\n\r\n220,000 people aged 65 years and above, making up about 7% of\r\n\r\nour  population. By 2010, we will have about 312,000  elderly\r\n\r\npersons, comprising 8% of our population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most elderly persons will remain healthy and\r\n\r\nindependent. However, it is estimated that about 3% of  those\r\n\r\naged  65  and  above do acquire severe disabilities  and  are\r\n\r\nunable  to  go  about their daily lives without  considerable\r\n\r\nnursing  care, medical attention or assistance. Yet,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame time, their conditions are not severe enough for them to\r\n\r\nbe warded in acute hospitals. These elderly persons should be\r\n\r\nlooked  after in their own homes, or if residential  care  is\r\n\r\nrequired, in \"step-down\" facilities such as nursing homes. As\r\n\r\nour  population ages, the demand for nursing home  care  will\r\n\r\nrise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, some two-thirds of our nursing home beds are\r\n\r\nin  VWO-run  facilities. VWO nursing homes receive assistance\r\n\r\nfrom  the  community,  in  the form of  volunteers  and  cash\r\n\r\ndonations.   Community   assistance  thus   supplements   the\r\n\r\npatients' payment for their share of the cost of care. At the\r\n\r\nsame  time, the Government also provides financial assistance\r\n\r\nto  keep  nursing  home care affordable to those  from  lower\r\n\r\nincome\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouseholds.  Nursing homes that are funded by Government  now\r\n\r\nreceive  capital funding of up to 90% of the cost of building\r\n\r\nand   equipping  the  homes.  In  addition,  Government  also\r\n\r\nprovides full subsidy for land rental and input GST.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame time, Government also funds 50% of the recurrent cost of\r\n\r\nproviding  care to patients with immediate family incomes  of\r\n\r\nless than $2,000.  Patients on public assistance receive  75%\r\n\r\nsubsidy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Higher  proportion  of  Singaporeans  will  be  eligible  for subsidy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Ageing\r\n\r\nPopulation,  in  its  report released  late  last  year,  had\r\n\r\nrecommended  that  the  Government  consider  expanding   its\r\n\r\noperating subsidies to VWO-run nursing homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has considered this recommendation and\r\n\r\ndecided to implement a three-tier subsidy of 75%, 50% and 25%\r\n\r\nfor  VWO  nursing  homes this year.  The highest  quantum  of\r\n\r\nsubsidy will be given to those with the least ability to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that subsidy goes to those who most deserve\r\n\r\nthem,  the introduction of the new subsidy structure will  be\r\n\r\naccompanied  by  refining the means  test  conducted  in  VWO\r\n\r\nnursing  homes.  In addition to the financial  means  of  the\r\n\r\nimmediate family, it will also take into account the size  of\r\n\r\nthe immediate family.  This is fairer because larger families\r\n\r\nwould  necessarily require a larger income to live on.   VWOs\r\n\r\nwill  also continue to take into account the patient's assets\r\n\r\nin evaluating his financial circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-tier subsidy will result in higher funding\r\n\r\nsupport  by  the  Government to the VWO  nursing  homes.   In\r\n\r\naddition  to  patients  on  public  assistance,  those   with\r\n\r\nimmediate  family per capita incomes below $300 will  receive\r\n\r\n75%  subsidy.  Those with per capita incomes between $300 and\r\n\r\n$500  will  receive  50% subsidy.  Further,  those  with  per\r\n\r\ncapita  incomes  between  $500  and  $700  will  receive  25%\r\n\r\nsubsidy, where they now receive none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this three-tier subsidy framework, therefore, a\r\n\r\nhigher proportion of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will  be eligible for subsidy.   The  financial\r\n\r\nburden  on low- and lower-middle income households supporting\r\n\r\ndisabled elderly family members who require nursing home care\r\n\r\nwill be considerably lightened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Need  to  safeguard affordability of care in future,  against shrinking tax base</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having decided on this subsidy framework, we need to\r\n\r\nconsider  how best to finance it.  Sir, our population  today\r\n\r\nis still relatively young.  Many of us are able to contribute\r\n\r\nactively  to  the economy and help generate  tax  revenue  to\r\n\r\nfinance   Government   programmes,  including   health   care\r\n\r\nsubsidies.   However,  this will change.   Not  only  will  a\r\n\r\nrapidly ageing population require more step-down health  care\r\n\r\nservices such as nursing home care, it will also result in  a\r\n\r\nshrinking  tax  base where a smaller working population  will\r\n\r\nfind  it  harder and harder to pay for health care  subsidies\r\n\r\nconsumed by a larger ageing population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without these subsidies, health care for the future\r\n\r\nelderly may not remain affordable to individuals from low and\r\n\r\nlower-middle income households and their families.   Yet,  at\r\n\r\nthe   same   time,   we   need  to  preserve   our   economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness in an increasingly globalised economy,  where\r\n\r\ncountries   maintain  competitive  tax   rates   to   attract\r\n\r\ninvestments.   Hence,  it would not be realistic  for  us  to\r\n\r\ncontinually  count on taxpayers to pay for the  subsidies  to\r\n\r\nour nursing homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ensure the affordability of nursing home care\r\n\r\nin future years.  Instead of continuing with today's practice\r\n\r\nof  paying subsidies to the VWO nursing homes directly out of\r\n\r\nthe  Government's budget, the Government will  establish  the\r\n\r\nalternative mechanism of an endowment fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Purpose of ElderCare Fund</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed endowment fund will be called ElderCare\r\n\r\nFund.  We will gradually build up a large enough capital  sum\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  ElderCare Fund, so that the interest income can be  used\r\n\r\nto fully finance the subsidies for patients who are cared for\r\n\r\nin VWO nursing homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By setting aside funds now while we can afford it, we\r\n\r\nwill  ensure  that  funding of subsidies for  step-down  care\r\n\r\nfacilities for the elderly of the future can be sustained  in\r\n\r\nthe long term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Top-ups of capital sum during budget surpluses</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ElderCare Fund will start off with an initial\r\n\r\ncapital  injection of $200 million.  During years  of  strong\r\n\r\neconomic growth, the capital sum can be topped up with budget\r\n\r\nsurpluses, so as to generate more interest income.  Only  the\r\n\r\ninterest income can be used to finance the nursing homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the initial years, subsidies to VWO nursing homes\r\n\r\nwill  be  partially funded from the interest  income  of  the\r\n\r\nFund,  and  partially  funded direct  from  the  Government's\r\n\r\nbudget.  The goal is for the Fund to reach a capital  sum  of\r\n\r\n$1 billion by the year 2010.  By then, the capital sum should\r\n\r\nbe  large  enough for subsidies to VWO nursing  homes  to  be\r\n\r\ncompletely financed from its interest income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, ElderCare Fund will provide subsidies only\r\n\r\nto VWO nursing homes.  Other kinds of step-down care provided\r\n\r\nby  VWOs  and supported by the Government, such as  community\r\n\r\nhospitals,  will  continue to be funded from  the  Government\r\n\r\nbudget.   However,  when ElderCare Fund has  more  resources,\r\n\r\nextension  of  its coverage to other kinds of step-down  care\r\n\r\nservices can be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Endowment fund will not replace community support</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have mentioned that VWOs fund their operating\r\n\r\nexpenditure  through community donations,  patient  fees  and\r\n\r\nGovernment  subsidies.  The introduction  of  ElderCare  Fund\r\n\r\nwill  not displace the role of community donations in helping\r\n\r\nthe  poor to pay for VWO nursing home care, as this  is  part\r\n\r\nand  parcel of the community support structure.  This  spirit\r\n\r\nof community help must be preserved and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nencouraged.  Hence, VWOs should continue to raise funds  from\r\n\r\nthe  community  and do their part in helping  the  needy  and\r\n\r\nindigent  patients foot their share of the charges using  the\r\n\r\ndonations raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>No change to administration of Medifund</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill also proposes some amendments to the\r\n\r\nexisting   provisions  on  Medifund.   Today,  each  approved\r\n\r\nhospital  sets  up a Hospital Medifund committee,  comprising\r\n\r\npersons   of   standing  with  grassroots  or   social   work\r\n\r\nexperience, to consider and approve applications  from  needy\r\n\r\npatients.   Funds  are  then paid  out  from  the  hospital's\r\n\r\nMedifund  Account  to  defray the  charges  incurred  by  the\r\n\r\napplicant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this system has worked well, we need to build\r\n\r\nin  greater flexibility for the administration of the  scheme\r\n\r\nto  adapt to changing circumstances, so that patients'  needs\r\n\r\nwill  continue to be well served.  For instance,  instead  of\r\n\r\nsetting   up  one  Medifund  committee  for  every   approved\r\n\r\nhospital,  it might be more desirable in future for community\r\n\r\norganisations  to be responsible for disbursing  Medifund  to\r\n\r\nneedy  residents  living  in  the  community.   The  proposed\r\n\r\namendments to the existing provisions on Medifund will  allow\r\n\r\nfor such alternative arrangements to be made, if necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, however, no changes will be made to the\r\n\r\nadministration of Medifund.  Singaporean patients in B2 and C\r\n\r\nclass  wards  of public hospitals and subsidised  outpatients\r\n\r\nwho  face  financial difficulty, and are unable to pay  their\r\n\r\ncharges, can continue to apply for Medifund assistance at the\r\n\r\nhospitals.  Their applications will continue to be considered\r\n\r\nby the hospital Medifund committees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to support the Medical and Elderly Care Endowment\r\n\r\nSchemes  Bill.   In fact, I am very glad that the  Government\r\n\r\nhas come up with yet another provision to cope with our fast-increasing population of elderly and an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\never-increasing  ratio of non-working to working  individuals\r\n\r\nin  the  near future.  It is good that there is now a  scheme\r\n\r\nthat gives Singaporeans further peace of mind in their golden\r\n\r\nyears.   I  would, however, like to add that this  Government\r\n\r\nmust continue to promote and encourage some of the very basic\r\n\r\nvalues  that have served us well all these years.   Sir,  the\r\n\r\nneed for self-sufficiency and looking after one's own kin and\r\n\r\nfamilies   in   our  Asian  values  should   be   emphasised.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the two endowment funds which are to serve only as\r\n\r\nsafety  nets  for those really in dire need,  will  be  found\r\n\r\nlacking through callous and overwhelming demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ElderCare Fund, like the Medifund, will be for the\r\n\r\nnursing care of our needy elderly in future.  As announced by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Health  in his introductory  speech,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will build up the ElderCare Fund with an  initial\r\n\r\ncapital   injection   of  $200  million.    Further   capital\r\n\r\ninjections  will be made when budget surpluses are available.\r\n\r\nOnly  the interest income of the ElderCare Fund will be  used\r\n\r\nto  fund  the  operating subsidies to VWO nursing  homes  and\r\n\r\nextension to other kinds of step-down care services  will  be\r\n\r\nconsidered when the ElderCare Fund has more resources.   Sir,\r\n\r\nin  order  to  build up the ElderCare Fund faster  so  as  to\r\n\r\nextend  the  other  services  sooner,  would  the  Government\r\n\r\nconsider  accepting  donations  from  private  organisations,\r\n\r\nphilanthropists or even grassroots organisations?  Would  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  also  encourage donations with  an  incentive  of\r\n\r\nthree-to-one  matching grant, similar to that  given  to  the\r\n\r\nCDCs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\ndevise  a  plan  for  the approval and  disbursement  of  the\r\n\r\nMedifund  and  ElderCare  Fund via  \"local  councils\".   Such\r\n\r\n\"local  councils\" could be the CDCs.  The authority to assess\r\n\r\neligibility and to approve the use of these Funds can then be\r\n\r\ndevolved.  The Ministry will, hence, need less administrative\r\n\r\nmanpower.  Each CDC could be made to raise some of the  money\r\n\r\nso  that  it will have more authority to disburse the  funds.\r\n\r\nIt  is  likely that the CDC, through its closer rapport  with\r\n\r\nthe constituents and with the liberty to decide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhom  to  help  in  its ward, will allow for  more  effective\r\n\r\ndisbursement  of  the funds.  The CDC will also  become  more\r\n\r\nrelevant  to the people.  Sir, as Members of Parliament  have\r\n\r\ncloser contact with their residents and also have the help of\r\n\r\nthe  grassroots  workers, they would know the  needs  of  the\r\n\r\nresidents  better.  They could be advisers  to  these  \"local\r\n\r\ncouncils\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like now to comment on the\r\n\r\nfollowing  clauses of the Medical and Elderly Care  Endowment\r\n\r\nSchemes Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clause 6</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act to be repealed specifies that the Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil  should contain not less than five and not more  than\r\n\r\nnine  members.  The Bill does not provide for any minimum  or\r\n\r\nmaximum number and is left to the discretion of the Minister.\r\n\r\nIs there any reason for this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Clause 25(6)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is any suspension, the approved provider\r\n\r\nshall  not be regarded as one.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill although I\r\n\r\nwould like to propose an amendment to one clause of the  Bill\r\n\r\nat the Committee stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Ageing Population headed by\r\n\r\nMinister  Mah Bow Tan presented its report to the  Government\r\n\r\nin  November  last  year.  One of its key recommendations  is\r\n\r\nthat  community  based step-down care  services  need  to  be\r\n\r\nstrengthened to support the family in its role of caring  for\r\n\r\nelderly members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the Elderly Care Endowment Scheme to be introduced\r\n\r\nand  the ElderCare Fund to be established under this Bill can\r\n\r\nbe  seen as Government's response to the recommendations.  It\r\n\r\nis  in  line  with  the  principle  of  promoting  individual\r\n\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore 21 Committee, launched by Prime Minister\r\n\r\nGoh in 1997, was tasked to look into the challenges faced  by\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  the  21st century.  One of  the  dilemmas  the\r\n\r\nCommittee dealt with is that of taking care of the  needs  of\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens versus the aspirations of  the  young.   The\r\n\r\nidea  is  that we need to promote strong family ties so  that\r\n\r\nthe  needs of the elderly can be taken care of by the family.\r\n\r\nBut  the community and the Government will help if the family\r\n\r\nis  unable to handle the problem.  The ElderCare Fund  is  in\r\n\r\nline with this idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I support the setting up of the ElderCare\r\n\r\nFund,  may I seek clarification from the Minister as  to  the\r\n\r\ninterpretation of the step-down care.  Clause 2 of  the  Bill\r\n\r\ndefines  step-down care as \"accommodation, personal care  and\r\n\r\nhealth  care  for  persons suffering or recovering  from  any\r\n\r\nsickness, disability or injury.\"  Could the Minister  clarify\r\n\r\nwhether  the  elderly who are \"frail\" and need some  form  of\r\n\r\nsupervision but not sick, disabled or injured, fall under the\r\n\r\ncategory  and can qualify for step-down care?   We  know  the\r\n\r\nfigure of Liang Po Po.  Just imagine that one day Liang Po Po\r\n\r\ngets  older, cannot even \"ho, ho, ho\", and becomes frail  but\r\n\r\nshe  is  not  sick, disabled or injured.  As  our  population\r\n\r\nages, there will be more of such groups who are able to carry\r\n\r\nout  their  daily needs or daily routine but are  frail.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  the  majority of the NTUC Day Care patients are  frail\r\n\r\nbut not sick, disabled or injured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister may also clarify whether the provision\r\n\r\nof elderly services at the space designated for such communal\r\n\r\nservices   at  the  HDB  apartments  qualifies  for  approved\r\n\r\nprovider  premises status under clause 22  of  the  Bill.   I\r\n\r\nraise  this because it is foreseen that there will be a  need\r\n\r\nto  provide such services at the void decks of HDB  flats  in\r\n\r\nfuture as our population is ageing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 26(4) refers to \"relevant patient\" to be a\r\n\r\nperson  who,  in the opinion of the Minister, requires  step-down  care and is assessed by the Minister to be \"financially\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged\".   May  I  propose that  in  arriving  at  the\r\n\r\ndefinition,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Minister will consider the predicament of the elderly who\r\n\r\nbelong  to the \"sandwiched\" group, that is, the middle income\r\n\r\ngroup  who  cannot  afford the fees charged  by  the  private\r\n\r\norganisations  and, at the same time, not  eligible  for  any\r\n\r\nsubvention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to declare my interest as the\r\n\r\nChairman  of the Medifund Council since it was set up.   Over\r\n\r\nthe  years, the Medifund has helped many thousands of  people\r\n\r\nto  meet their hospital and medical expenses.  It worked well\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  flexibility built into the  rules  for  the\r\n\r\nMedical  Endowment Fund.  With a basic set of rules supported\r\n\r\nby  guidelines,  Medifund committees were  able  to  exercise\r\n\r\njudgement,  especially  in  border  line  cases,  to  balance\r\n\r\nbetween  the  resource available and the  help  that  can  be\r\n\r\nprovided.   And I am happy to see that even more  flexibility\r\n\r\nis  being  considered  under the  reconstitution.   The  same\r\n\r\nspirit  of  flexibility is being suggested for the  ElderCare\r\n\r\nFund.   It  is certainly timely to establish such a  fund  to\r\n\r\nprovide subventions to approved providers of step-down  care.\r\n\r\nIt  will  be a great help to existing providers of  step-down\r\n\r\ncare  who  qualify as well as encourage the establishment  of\r\n\r\nnewer facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two areas that I would like to seek\r\n\r\nclarification.   One in particular relates to  the  ElderCare\r\n\r\nFund.   The  definition of \"step-down care\"  suggested  means\r\n\r\n\"accommodation,  personal care and health  care  for  persons\r\n\r\nsuffering  or  recovering  from any sickness,  disability  or\r\n\r\ninjury; personal care and health care during the day for  any\r\n\r\nsuch  persons;  or such other forms of health  care  or  care\r\n\r\narrangements\".   If  I look at the definition  of  \"step-down\r\n\r\ncare\",  I  do  not  see  it  as something  that  is  strictly\r\n\r\nrestricted  to  the  elderly.  It  could  well  be  something\r\n\r\nbeneficial to someone that is young.  So I am not sure why we\r\n\r\nare  restricting ourselves to the elderly.  It could be  just\r\n\r\nto  start it off and as the Fund builds up, maybe it will  be\r\n\r\nexpanded.  In which case then, by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncalling  it  the  ElderCare Fund, are  we  placing  a  mental\r\n\r\nceiling  and  whereby even if the Fund  builds  up,  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  restrict step-down care only for  the  elderly?\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  the  Minister could let us know the  rationale  for\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next concern is the sweeping exclusion from the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  \"step-down care\" of medical  or  health  care\r\n\r\nprovided  in any maternity homes or premises used or intended\r\n\r\nto  be  used  for the accommodation of pregnant women  or  of\r\n\r\nwomen immediately after child birth.  I can accept that post-natal  care  is  excluded from the definition  of  \"step-down\r\n\r\ncare\".   However,  I  am  sure there is  a  range  of  health\r\n\r\ncomplications arising from pregnancy which can be  adequately\r\n\r\ndealt  with  by  the  professionals at a  maternity  home  or\r\n\r\nsimilar premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern arises from the first-hand knowledge of a\r\n\r\nlady  who suffered from a stroke whilst pregnant.  The health\r\n\r\ninsurance policy taken out for her covered medical  care  for\r\n\r\nstrokes,  but  because her stroke was deemed to  have  arisen\r\n\r\nfrom her pregnancy, she found that her medical costs were not\r\n\r\ncovered.   A less sweeping exclusion directed at medical  and\r\n\r\nhealth care for normal pregnancy, including Caesarian births,\r\n\r\nwould  be  preferable.  This would ensure that only  premises\r\n\r\nset aside to deal with special pregnancy cases would qualify.\r\n\r\nLarger  families  are being encouraged  in  the  light  of  a\r\n\r\nrapidly  ageing and shrinking population.  No one would  wish\r\n\r\nfor  a  complicated pregnancy.  The medical cost for a normal\r\n\r\npregnancy is sufficient financial burden to many.  Some  help\r\n\r\nis  well deserved by those playing their part in replenishing\r\n\r\nand expanding our major resource, our citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, for the opportunity to speak on the Bill.   My\r\n\r\ncomments are directed largely to Part III of the Bill on  the\r\n\r\nElderCare  Scheme.  The Bill seeks to establish a  Government\r\n\r\nfund   to  subvent  the  recurrent  cost  of  step-down  care\r\n\r\nproviders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to commend the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nfor moving so expeditiously on the recommendation of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on the Ageing Population to\r\n\r\nmake  provisions for the funding of step-down care.  The  IMC\r\n\r\nhad  observed that while the provision and financing of acute\r\n\r\nhealth  care services for the elderly in Singapore are pretty\r\n\r\nmuch  adequately  taken  care of,  the  step-down  care  and,\r\n\r\nprimarily,  the  community-based  services  still  need  much\r\n\r\nstrengthening.  The Ministry has in fact started  to  address\r\n\r\nthose  areas  under  its purview.  The  recent  announcements\r\n\r\nrelating to allocation of land for private nursing homes  and\r\n\r\nchanges  in  eligibility  for subsidy  of  new  residents  in\r\n\r\nGovernment-funded VWO-run nursing homes and, now,  this  Bill\r\n\r\nto  set  up  the  ElderCare Fund, are  all  directed  towards\r\n\r\nfacilitating  the  provision of step-down  care,  encouraging\r\n\r\nappropriate  usage  and assisting in the financing  of  these\r\n\r\nservices.  This is certainly moving us in the right direction\r\n\r\nin   preparing   for   our  growing   population   of   older\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do have a concern, however, that our attention\r\n\r\ncontinues to be much more heavily directed towards  the  very\r\n\r\nvisible problem related to institutional care and not  enough\r\n\r\ntowards  the  not  so  visible, but  equally,  if  not,  more\r\n\r\nimportant, educational, preventive and rehabilitative aspects\r\n\r\nof  the  whole picture.  The Bill has defined step-down  care\r\n\r\nvery broadly to cover both accommodation and day care, and to\r\n\r\ncover both health and personal care as well as other forms of\r\n\r\ncare  arrangements.  This is good and necessary as it is  not\r\n\r\nonly more places for institutional care and nursing homes and\r\n\r\nin  day  care centres that are needed, but even more  so  the\r\n\r\nprovision of home care services, medical and nursing services\r\n\r\nand  simple home-help services in which a large gap currently\r\n\r\nexists.   But  step-down care, as its  very  name  indicates,\r\n\r\naddresses  the situation after the damage has been  done  and\r\n\r\nseeks the solution from the acute care institution's point of\r\n\r\nview  of how to get the senior citizen who has needed  to  be\r\n\r\nhospitalized back in various stages to the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have defined in our vision of successful ageing for\r\n\r\nSingapore that, at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  individual level, we aspire to have healthy  and  active\r\n\r\nolder Singaporeans who lead independent and fulfilling lives.\r\n\r\nTo  achieve this, there is a chasm we have yet to  bridge  in\r\n\r\nmindsets  and attitudes, both in the value that we  currently\r\n\r\nplace on the advanced years of an older person's lifetime  as\r\n\r\nwell  as in the importance of paying attention to the  simple\r\n\r\ndaily  routines in preventive health care to ensure that  our\r\n\r\nsenior citizens continue to stay fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, it is not infrequently that I have heard stories\r\n\r\nof  older  persons who have not had treatment for correctable\r\n\r\nconditions simply because the family had not thought that, at\r\n\r\ntheir  age, the expense would be worth it.  Just recently,  a\r\n\r\ncolleague who does voluntary work in the community shared  an\r\n\r\naccount  of  an elderly woman who was house-bound because  of\r\n\r\nfailing  eyesight due to cataracts.  The family felt that  it\r\n\r\nwould  not  be justified to dig into the family reserves  for\r\n\r\nthe  thousand  dollars that they took for  the  operation  to\r\n\r\ncorrect  the problem, and that was because she was  70  years\r\n\r\nold.   But  for this lady, she has five more years,  10  more\r\n\r\nyears, maybe even more, house-bound and unable to see.  It is\r\n\r\nthe  attitude, I think, of after a certain age, it  does  not\r\n\r\nmatter  so much.  But our life expectancy is now pretty  high\r\n\r\nand  I think we need to put more value on the quality of life\r\n\r\nfor the older Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Health Survey conducted by the Ministry in\r\n\r\n1995 discovered a high occurrence of high blood pressure  and\r\n\r\ndiabetes  in  our population.  These medical conditions  will\r\n\r\nincrease in incidence with age.  High blood pressure that  is\r\n\r\nnot managed well will predispose to strokes and diabetes that\r\n\r\nis  not well treated may very well lead to amputations.  Poor\r\n\r\neyesight  and frailty result in falls.  All three  result  in\r\n\r\ndrastically  reduced  mobility for the  older  persons.   The\r\n\r\nquantum leap in care needed when an older person suffers loss\r\n\r\nof  mobility and the impact on her or his quality of life  is\r\n\r\nhorrendous.  Very often, people will scrimp on or ignore what\r\n\r\nthey feel to be small things - good, effective control of low\r\n\r\ngrade chronic illnesses or exercise and rehabilitation to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaintain fitness, not paying attention until what could  have\r\n\r\nvery  easily  been  managed on an  outpatient  basis  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity becomes a hospitalisation for a major health event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So while the provisions in the Bill for financing and\r\n\r\nsubsidy  of  step-down  care are most  welcome,  I  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  put aside enough resources towards  encouraging\r\n\r\nand  facilitating the development of strong programmes in the\r\n\r\ncommunity for health educational and preventive services,  to\r\n\r\nre-orient  our perspective so that what drives the system  is\r\n\r\nhow to prevent the strokes, the amputations and the fractures\r\n\r\nthat  give  rise to the need for the step-down  care  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Services to meet the needs of the frail, ill and\r\n\r\ndisabled  elderly  are  currently  provided  by  a  range  of\r\n\r\nagencies  under the umbrellas of the Ministry of Health,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Community Development and the National Council of\r\n\r\nSocial  Services.  As the Health Ministry proceeds to  refine\r\n\r\nits  existing criteria for susbsidy of nursing home residents\r\n\r\nto  ensure the appropriate use of facilities and services and\r\n\r\nto  enact  and  implement  regulations  to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nElderCare Fund to be established is drawn upon prudently  and\r\n\r\nappropriately, there will be a shift in the mix of  residents\r\n\r\nthat are presently being looked after by the nursing homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has recently announced that it will no\r\n\r\nlonger subsidise new incoming residents who need only varying\r\n\r\nlevels  of  assistance in their routine activities  of  daily\r\n\r\nliving -  I think these are referred to as Category 1  and  2\r\n\r\npatients  - as these persons should not be cared for  in  the\r\n\r\nnursing  home,  but  rather  in  their  own  homes,  in   the\r\n\r\ncommunity,   or   perhaps  in  the  homes   for   the   aged.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, at the moment, the homes for the  aged,  which\r\n\r\ncome  under  MCD, are not geared up to deliver this  care  as\r\n\r\nthey are actually meant for the well elderly.  And there  are\r\n\r\ninsufficient  VWOs providing community services  and  support\r\n\r\nthat   would  be  available  to  help  families  and  elderly\r\n\r\nindividuals to cope at home.  So, as the nursing homes resist\r\n\r\ntaking in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCategory  1  and  2 patients because they no  longer  receive\r\n\r\nsubsidy  for  them, where will these people go to?   In  this\r\n\r\ninterim,  there  will be tremendous pressure on  families  to\r\n\r\ncope.   Is there some way perhaps the Minister could look  at\r\n\r\nsome resources towards helping bridge this interim gap, until\r\n\r\nsuch  time  as MCD and VWOs are able to provide the  services\r\n\r\nthat  will enable these categories of residents to  be  taken\r\n\r\ncare of at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the various agencies will move at different speeds in\r\n\r\nundertaking their part of the work that needs to be  done  in\r\n\r\nmoving  towards our desired destination of successful  ageing\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, much coordination is required to ensure  that,\r\n\r\nfor all our good intentions, we do not in fact exacerbate the\r\n\r\nproblem in the meantime.  I trust that the Minister will take\r\n\r\nthe  points  raised into consideration as  he  moves  to  put\r\n\r\ntogether the policies, initiatives and legislation to provide\r\n\r\nfor  and finance appropriate health and personal care for our\r\n\r\ngrowing senior citizenry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How we treat the sick and old is a strong signal on how\r\n\r\nwe  recognise  their  contributions to the  success  of  this\r\n\r\nnation.   It  is part of strengthening the software  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the  old  and the sick.  Today's old  was  yesterday's\r\n\r\nyoung  who  contributed  to the success  of  Singapore.   And\r\n\r\ntoday's  young who is presently contributing to  our  success\r\n\r\nwill be tomorrow's old.  I do not wish to go through all  the\r\n\r\nmany  things  in  the  Bill because it has  been  covered  by\r\n\r\nprevious  speakers.   However, I have two concerns  regarding\r\n\r\nelderly  care.   First,  in  promoting  step-down  care,  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector would be playing a role.  The private  sector\r\n\r\nis  primarily  profit-motivated, and there is  nothing  wrong\r\n\r\nwith  that.   But, Sir, the question we ask is:   should  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of elderly care be subjected to too much of  market\r\n\r\nforces?   And as a follow up, is it not better to  serve  the\r\n\r\nneeds of the elderly through the VWOs and cooperatives?   The\r\n\r\nsetting  up of cooperatives would have social objectives  and\r\n\r\nthey could give the elderly care and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose  who  need  it better value for money.   Moreover,  the\r\n\r\nsurpluses of cooperatives, which are run on commercial  line,\r\n\r\nbelong to members and will go back to the people who need it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to make is about home care.\r\n\r\nWhile  we  promote institutional care, I think we should  not\r\n\r\nneglect  home  care.   The  report of  the  Inter-Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  the Ageing Population had a whole  chapter  on\r\n\r\nenabling families to care for the elderly.  It primarily says\r\n\r\nthat the care of the elderly by the family is the best avenue\r\n\r\nas  they also need to talk about physical need as well as the\r\n\r\nemotional  and social needs.  And it is also in keeping  with\r\n\r\nour value of filial piety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I support step-down care and institutional care\r\n\r\nfor  the  elderly,  I ask that we do not neglect  home  care.\r\n\r\nHome  care  is also the desire of most of the elderly.   They\r\n\r\nlike  to  be  near their children and grandchildren,  and  we\r\n\r\nshould  say  that it is part of the value for the  family  to\r\n\r\ntake care of them. Towards this end, I would like to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  what  steps are going to be taken to  promote  home\r\n\r\ncare  so  that  more and more people will  look  after  their\r\n\r\nelderly at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, I would first like to thank the\r\n\r\nMembers  for their contributions to this debate.  This  whole\r\n\r\nissue  of looking after the aged sick is a very big challenge\r\n\r\nfor  us. This is not the first nor the last time that we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  discuss  on  how we are  going  to  approach  this\r\n\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, I would like to say that I agree entirely\r\n\r\nwith  Dr  Lily  Neo  and Mr Seng Han Thong  that  our  entire\r\n\r\napproach  must  emphasise  the  personal  responsibility  for\r\n\r\nlooking  after  one's  health and  also  counting  on  family\r\n\r\nmembers to look after you when you grow old or when you  fall\r\n\r\nsick.  I think these are two pillars that would not change  - personal responsibility and family support.  But at the  same\r\n\r\ntime, there would be this small percentage of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  elderly who would fall sick.

For those  categories  that\r\n\r\nrequire  a very high level of nursing care, what we designate\r\n\r\nas  Categories  III  and IV, the medical conditions  of  such\r\n\r\npeople  would  affect approximately 2% to 3% of  the  elderly\r\n\r\nabove  65 years old.  So, what we are discussing today  is  a\r\n\r\nfairly  well-defined group of about 2% to 3% of  the  elderly\r\n\r\nabove  65  years old.  Of course, this is part of  the  whole\r\n\r\nissue  of  how  you  address  the  challenge  of  the  ageing\r\n\r\npopulation and many issues have been raised by Members.   But\r\n\r\nI  just want to concentrate Members' minds that the ElderCare\r\n\r\nFund is set up to target at this 2% to 3% of the 65 years and\r\n\r\nabove  who  fall sick, categorised as Categories III  and  IV\r\n\r\nunder  these medical conditions, and who require care  in  an\r\n\r\ninstitution or in a home setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first definition is the medical condition of\r\n\r\nthe person that requires such care.  As Mr Seng Han Thong has\r\n\r\nasked, this is addressed in the definition in the Bill and it\r\n\r\ndoes not cover the elderly frail.  Elderly frail, who are out\r\n\r\nof  this  3%,  would not be covered by this  ElderCare  Fund.\r\n\r\nHaving defined this group whose medical condition requires us\r\n\r\nto look after them, then it really does not matter whether we\r\n\r\nlook  after  them  in an institution setting  or  in  a  home\r\n\r\nsetting.   But  for  purposes of implementing  the  financial\r\n\r\nsupport,  we  are  saying  that  we  start  off  first   with\r\n\r\nsupporting  the  nursing homes run by VWOs.   This  would  be\r\n\r\nextended in due course in future to nursing homes run by  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  when  we  are  familiar  with  running  such\r\n\r\nfinancial  support.   The  subsidies  are  meant  for  people\r\n\r\nmeeting  the  medical condition, and passing the means  test.\r\n\r\nIn  future,  we  can also extend to other institutional  care\r\n\r\nsettings,  whether it is a community hospital,  chronic  sick\r\n\r\nhospital  or such facilities set up in the void decks.   When\r\n\r\nwe are able to develop home care facilities and services in a\r\n\r\nbetter way, such financial support would also be extended  to\r\n\r\nhome care services for this 3% of elderly sick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we start off with this category that requires\r\n\r\nthe medical attention and financial support.  As a start,  to\r\n\r\nimplement this programme, my Ministry suggests we do it first\r\n\r\nwith  the  nursing homes run by VWOs, develop some expertise,\r\n\r\nand  then  we  can  systematically extend  it  to  widen  the\r\n\r\ncoverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee asked does the ElderCare Fund only cater\r\n\r\nfor  the elderly? The answer is no.  It is mainly the elderly\r\n\r\nwho would require such nursing home care, but there would  be\r\n\r\nothers who would also require such rehabilitative and nursing\r\n\r\nhome  care, for example, the case that he cited of a pregnant\r\n\r\nlady  who  suffered  a stroke.  In the  first  phase  of  the\r\n\r\nsickness,  she  would  be  cared for  in  an  acute  hospital\r\n\r\nsetting.  Then  later,  when she is  more  stable,  when  her\r\n\r\nrecovery  is  better, we would probably  transfer  her  to  a\r\n\r\nnursing home. And when she is in a nursing home, and  if  she\r\n\r\nbelongs  to  the  low  and  lower-middle  income,  then   the\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance would kick in.  We  call  it  ElderCare\r\n\r\nbecause the vast majority of the people who would enjoy  this\r\n\r\nfunding  would  be the elderly.  But it is not restricted  to\r\n\r\njust the elderly.  People whose medical conditions satisfy or\r\n\r\nrequire us to provide medical and nursing care, ie, those  in\r\n\r\nCategories  III and IV, would be eligible for  the  financial\r\n\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having defined the medical condition and the premises,\r\n\r\nwe  can  now  define  the  relevant  patient,  that  is,  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  categories  of people who  deserve  the  different\r\n\r\nlevels  of financial support.  Mr Seng Han Thong made a  plea\r\n\r\nfor  the  sandwiched  group,  the middle-income  group  whose\r\n\r\nincome is too low to afford private nursing home and too high\r\n\r\nto  enjoy  the  subsidies.  We try to take care  of  this  by\r\n\r\nhaving  a  three-tier  framework.  Previously,  it  was  only\r\n\r\neither  above or below $2,000 household income.  Now we  have\r\n\r\nthree  tiers, so it is no longer a sandwich.   It  is  now  a\r\n\r\nthree  layered nonya cake.  But of course, there would  still\r\n\r\nbe  people who fall outside the criteria.  I do not think  we\r\n\r\nneed to go into a kueh lapis, with so many layers, but we can\r\n\r\nobviously extend the layers and provide more assistance  when\r\n\r\nwe build up the fund and when we build up the experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would turn to the specific suggestions and points\r\n\r\nraised.    Dr  Lily  Neo  asked  whether  we  accept  private\r\n\r\ndonations. The answer is yes.  All donations and bequests can\r\n\r\nbe  paid  as  capital  monies  into  both  the  Medifund  and\r\n\r\nElderCare Fund. She asked whether the Government would give a\r\n\r\nmatching  grant of 3 to 1. At this moment, I do not  see  the\r\n\r\nneed  because  the Government is pledging  to  build  up  the\r\n\r\nElderCare Fund to the tune of $1 billion.  That is a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney,  so there is really no need to have further incentives\r\n\r\nto  ask the private sector or the individuals to donate.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  I  would  urge the private sector and individuals,  if\r\n\r\nthey   want  to  make  donations,  not  necessarily  to  make\r\n\r\ndonations  to  the ElderCare Fund because the  Government  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  build  it up to $1 billion, but to make  donations\r\n\r\ndirectly to the VWOs, because they need the donations to help\r\n\r\npay for the patients' portion of their bills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also asked whether we can work through local\r\n\r\ncouncils  like  the  CDCs.  This is  something  that  we  are\r\n\r\nthinking  about  and this is one of the reasons  why  we  are\r\n\r\nmaking  some of the amendments, in particular, the  amendment\r\n\r\nto  section  6  where  we  did not stipulate  the  number  of\r\n\r\nadvisory  councils.   This is to give us the  flexibility  to\r\n\r\nappoint  enough  people to match the CDCs, depending  on  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  members  in the CDCs.  So, the  intention  is  to\r\n\r\ninvolve the community in the form of the CDCs.  They are  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  know  the  residents  on  the  ground  and   can\r\n\r\nunderstand  their  needs and make sensible decisions  on  who\r\n\r\nqualifies for Medifund assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked what happens to the patients if we\r\n\r\nhave  to suspend a nursing home. That really depends  on  the\r\n\r\nreasons  for  suspending the nursing home.   We  may  suspend\r\n\r\nnursing  homes for several reasons.  The most drastic  reason\r\n\r\nis  when we have to remove the licence from the nursing  home\r\n\r\nbecause  it  does not meet the medical criteria of continuing\r\n\r\nto  run  the  nursing  home. Under  such  circumstances,  the\r\n\r\npatients  will have to be taken care of in other homes.   But\r\n\r\nif the nursing home continues to meet the medical criteria of\r\n\r\nrunning a nursing home, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngets  suspended  for  other reasons,  for  example,  for  not\r\n\r\nkeeping  good  accounts  or  for whatever  reasons,  then  of\r\n\r\ncourse, it would not affect the patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee asked why we exclude facilities meant for\r\n\r\npregnancy,  etc.  As I explained, complications arising  from\r\n\r\npregnancy  will  be dealt with either in the  acute  hospital\r\n\r\nsetting  or  if  it is something that requires  nursing  home\r\n\r\ncare, then it will be dealt with in a step-down nursing  home\r\n\r\ncare  facility.  Under the latter circumstances, the  patient\r\n\r\nwill qualify for ElderCare funding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee made several very good points. I just\r\n\r\nwant  to  say  that  all  these are  very  important.  We  do\r\n\r\nrecognise the full range of the challenge facing  us.   As  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  the Bill tackles 3% of the elderly who require nursing\r\n\r\nhome  care.   My Ministry, working together with  MCD,  would\r\n\r\nalso  look  at the other very important areas.  I agree  with\r\n\r\nher  entirely that we first have to set up the framework  for\r\n\r\npreventive  care so that as few as possible  of  our  elderly\r\n\r\nactually  fall into acute or chronic problems. So  preventive\r\n\r\nhealthcare  and public education are very important,  and  we\r\n\r\nare also working on programmes that will address this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Dr Jennifer Lee and Mr Thomas also talked about the\r\n\r\nvery important role played in home care facilities.  This  is\r\n\r\na  tremendous challenge.  It requires a lot of resources.   I\r\n\r\ncan  assure  both of them that both MCD and my  Ministry  are\r\n\r\nworking to improve the home care facilities and services that\r\n\r\nwe have in Singapore but Members have to give us some time to\r\n\r\nwork on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular problems of Categories I and II, I think,\r\n\r\nrequire  a joint effort between MCD and MOH to deal with.   I\r\n\r\ndo  not  want to give the impression that because we come  to\r\n\r\nthis House on our plans for setting up nursing homes and  our\r\n\r\nfinancial  arrangements for the ElderCare Fund  that  we  are\r\n\r\ngiving focus or attention to institutional care, and not to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe other aspects of the problems confronting our aged. As  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  this would not be the first or the last time  that  we\r\n\r\nwould  be  talking about the issue.  I am  sure  we  will  be\r\n\r\naddressing it. Members can have my assurance that my Ministry\r\n\r\nand  MCD will tackle this problem systematically, and we will\r\n\r\ncome  back  to the House for support for the other components\r\n\r\nof looking after the elderly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the Minister said earlier that the\r\n\r\nElderCare  Fund will also go towards the recipients  of  home\r\n\r\ncare.  I want to ask him how would this work and who will  be\r\n\r\neligible for this ElderCare Fund.  Will the recipient be  the\r\n\r\nbeneficiary or the carer of the recipient?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Dr Lily Neo is always moving at the\r\n\r\nspeed  of  a  train.   I said that we start  off  first  with\r\n\r\nnursing  homes run by VWOs.  We build up the experience  and,\r\n\r\nin future, we can extend the scope to the next step, which is\r\n\r\nnursing homes run by the private sector.  Then we can  extend\r\n\r\nit  to another step, which is other types of homes, not  just\r\n\r\nnursing  homes,  but community hospitals, chronic  sick,  and\r\n\r\nalso facilities in the void decks.  We can also extend it  to\r\n\r\nhome care.  I know the real challenge and the difficulties of\r\n\r\nproviding subsidies or financial assistance to home care, the\r\n\r\nvery  issues  that  the  Member raised,  whether  it  is  the\r\n\r\nprovider or the recipient; who gets, who approves.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nhuge  problem.  I prefer to go about it systematically.   Let\r\n\r\nus start with the easy part first, which is nursing homes run\r\n\r\nby  VWOs.  Then we extend it systematically, but I can assure\r\n\r\nMembers that we will reach home care in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The subsequent clauses  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill seek to establish the legislative framework for the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the  Premium Plan  for  military  Warrant\r\n\r\nOfficers  and  Specialists.  Provisions  are  also  made  for\r\n\r\nconsequential amendments to the Pension Fund Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to briefly explain the rationale for the\r\n\r\nintroduction of the Premium Plan, and how it relates  to  the\r\n\r\nSAVER Plan for military Officers which the House had endorsed\r\n\r\nin March 1998.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is the guarantor of our\r\n\r\nnational security. The SAF is a credible deterrent because of\r\n\r\nthe  dedication  and professionalism of  its  personnel.   To\r\n\r\nmaintain  this  edge, the SAF must be able to recruit,  train\r\n\r\nand  retain  enough  quality Officers, Warrant  Officers  and\r\n\r\nSpecialists  who  are  able to meet  its  high  standards  of\r\n\r\ncommitment and professionalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with this objective in mind that MINDEF formulated\r\n\r\nthe \"New Partnership\" programme for our military Officers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  1997.  The \"New Partnership\" programme is a total  revamp\r\n\r\nof   the  manpower  management  system  of  the  SAF,  making\r\n\r\nfundamental  changes  to  the career structure,  remuneration\r\n\r\npackage  and career management and performance management  of\r\n\r\nour  personnel.  As part of the \"New Partnership\",  in  1998,\r\n\r\nMINDEF  implemented  the  SAVER  Plan,  which  replaced   the\r\n\r\nPensionable,  CPF  Plus and Contract schemes,  for  uniformed\r\n\r\nOfficers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not enough to revamp the manpower management\r\n\r\nsystem  of  the  Officer Corps alone.  The SAF requires  good\r\n\r\npeople  at  every  level to ensure that it  can  continue  to\r\n\r\nperform its role effectively.  The non-officer corps is  just\r\n\r\nas  important, as it forms the backbone of the SAF.  A review\r\n\r\nwas  therefore  commissioned in 1998  to  revamp  the  career\r\n\r\nstructures  and  remuneration mechanisms of military  Warrant\r\n\r\nOfficers and Specialists.  As part of this review, MINDEF has\r\n\r\ndeveloped  a new scheme of service, to be called the  Premium\r\n\r\nPlan,  to  support the career structures of military  Warrant\r\n\r\nOfficers  and  Specialists, in the same way  the  SAVER  Plan\r\n\r\nsupported the career structure for military Officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Premium Plan will meet the needs of Warrant Officers\r\n\r\nand  Specialists at different stages of their careers.  Under\r\n\r\nthe  Premium  Plan, MINDEF will provide a  gratuity  for  the\r\n\r\nserviceman  after  his 10th year of service,  and  thereafter\r\n\r\ncontribute an amount, based on his monthly salary,  into  his\r\n\r\nPremium Plan accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the objectives and mechanisms of the SAVER and\r\n\r\nPremium  Plans are broadly similar, funds in both Plans  will\r\n\r\nbe  pooled  and  invested  as a joint  \"SAVER-Premium  Fund\".\r\n\r\nInvestment returns from this Fund will be credited into  each\r\n\r\nserviceman's  individual accounts.  The Fund  would  adopt  a\r\n\r\nsimilar  structure  of  governance  and  the  same  Board  of\r\n\r\nTrustees as the existing SAVER Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accumulated balance in the Premium Plan accounts\r\n\r\nwill  be  given   to  the servicemen when they  retire  after\r\n\r\nserving  a full career with the SAF.  Those who leave earlier\r\n\r\nwill get a smaller sum, depending on their length of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, this Bill also empowers the Armed Forces\r\n\r\nCouncil  to make provisions for loans and other benefits  out\r\n\r\nof  both  the  SAVER Plan and the Premium Plan.   This  would\r\n\r\ninclude the provision of flexible benefits for servicemen and\r\n\r\ntheir families under the Premium Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF intends to implement the Premium Plan on 31st\r\n\r\nMarch  2000  for  all  newly-enlisted Specialists.   Existing\r\n\r\nWarrant Officers and Specialists will be offered an option to\r\n\r\nconvert  to  the  Premium Plan, and transfer the  accumulated\r\n\r\nbenefits  from their current schemes of service  to  the  new\r\n\r\nPlan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, quality manpower is a key pillar of the SAF's\r\n\r\ndefence  capabilities.  The Premium Plan aims to attract  the\r\n\r\nquality manpower that the SAF needs, by providing first class\r\n\r\ncareers in the SAF that are both challenging and rewarding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr David T.

This is the best  way  to\r\n\r\nincrease  consumer welfare. The policy has  served  us  well.\r\n\r\nIn  areas  where  protection is necessary,  for  example,  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard health, safety or public morals, there are  already\r\n\r\nexisting  legislation.   Specific offences  of  cheating  and\r\n\r\ncertain  forms of fraudulent trades are also covered  in  the\r\n\r\nPenal Code and other legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must avoid over-regulating. First, legislative and\r\n\r\nregulatory  requirements  on  businesses  carry   with   them\r\n\r\ncompliance  costs.   This will increase business  costs  that\r\n\r\nwould ultimately be passed on to consumers.  Second, we  must\r\n\r\nalso  avoid  excessive dependence by consumers on  Government\r\n\r\nregulation.  Otherwise,  legislation  would  have   to   keep\r\n\r\nexpanding  in scope and coverage to cover all possible  cases\r\n\r\nof  cheating and unfair trade practices.  In the end, let the\r\n\r\nbuyer beware - this is the caveat emptor principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that a better approach is to educate\r\n\r\nconsumers  and make more information available, so that  they\r\n\r\ncan  make good choices.  The Government will continue to work\r\n\r\nwith CASE on such efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CASE has also informed that it will be putting up a\r\n\r\nproposal  for  a  Fair Trading Act for Singapore.   They  are\r\n\r\nstudying,  among others, the two Acts cited by Mr  Chiam  See\r\n\r\nTong  and will be incorporating the elements which they  deem\r\n\r\nappropriate  for  Singapore.  MTI will study CASE's  proposal\r\n\r\nwhen it is ready, but our preference is for a minimalist Fair\r\n\r\nTrading Act, should one be deemed necessary.\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
