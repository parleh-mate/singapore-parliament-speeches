 have  made  the\r\n\r\nrequisite $50 CPF contribution to qualify for  ERS.   Out\r\n\r\nof  this  1.3 million Singaporeans, 100,398 are  inactive\r\n\r\nCPF  account  holders  and another 221  are  non-salaried\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will take steps to remind\r\n\r\nSingaporeans about the ERS.

Thus,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans should help to remind their family  members,\r\n\r\nrelatives  and  friends  to make the  requisite  $50  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution.

The\r\n\r\nfirst phase of the deposit insurance study by MAS focused\r\n\r\non issues related to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmembership, coverage limit, the size of the fund and  how\r\n\r\nparticipating institutions will be assessed  for  premium\r\n\r\ncontributions.  Who  will  manage  the  scheme  will   be\r\n\r\nconsidered in the second phase of the study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two broad options for managing deposit\r\n\r\ninsurance.  One  option  is to  have  the  responsibility\r\n\r\nreside  within MAS. There is substantial overlap  in  the\r\n\r\ninterests and responsibilities of a bank supervisor and a\r\n\r\ndeposit  insurer. MAS supervises banks  to  assess  their\r\n\r\nsafety  and  soundness  and  to  minimise  incidences  of\r\n\r\nfailure.   A  major  part  of this  supervision  involves\r\n\r\nevaluating  the risk profile of institutions -  both  the\r\n\r\nhealth of their balance sheets as well as the strength of\r\n\r\ntheir  risk management systems and processes. The deposit\r\n\r\ninsurer  similarly needs to assess the  risk  profile  of\r\n\r\ninstitutions so that it can price the insurance  premiums\r\n\r\nappropriately and take supervisory action to minimise the\r\n\r\nrisk posed by a weak institution to the deposit insurance\r\n\r\nfund. If MAS administers the deposit insurance scheme, it\r\n\r\ncan leverage on its existing supervisory resources, avoid\r\n\r\nthe duplication of supervisory functions and minimise the\r\n\r\nburden on institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another option is to set up a separate organisation\r\n\r\nwith   its   own  governance  structure.   This  approach\r\n\r\nemphasises  the concern that the interests of  a  deposit\r\n\r\ninsurer and a bank supervisor may not always coincide.  A\r\n\r\ndeposit  insurer  may want to close  a  weak  bank  early\r\n\r\ninstead of risking further deterioration in the bank  and\r\n\r\na  larger  loss to the deposit insurance fund.  The  bank\r\n\r\nsupervisor  may disagree if there is a good  chance  that\r\n\r\nthe  bank can be returned to health after cleaning up its\r\n\r\nbalance  sheet  and  improving its management.  But  even\r\n\r\nunder  this option where the deposit insurer is  separate\r\n\r\nfrom  the  bank  supervisor, the two will still  need  to\r\n\r\nconsult closely and share information with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second phase of the study, the MAS will\r\n\r\nassess   the   relative  merits  of  the   two   opposing\r\n\r\nconsiderations,   and  study  the  practices   in   other\r\n\r\ncountries, before\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaking  a  firm  proposal on an organisational  structure\r\n\r\nmost suitable for the Singapore deposit insurance scheme.\r\n\r\nThe   MAS  will  consult  with  the  industry  and  other\r\n\r\ninterested parties when the study is completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, in the\r\n\r\nestimation  of  the Finance Minister, how  much  does  he\r\n\r\nenvisage  that  these small depositors  need  to  pay  as\r\n\r\npremium to be covered under such a scheme?

Speaking from memory, our intention is  to\r\n\r\nbuild up a deposit insurance fund which will amount to 30\r\n\r\nbasis points, which means, 0.3% of the amount of deposits\r\n\r\ninsured.  But we are not building this up overnight.   We\r\n\r\nare  planning to build this up over a period of 10 years,\r\n\r\nwhich  means  a very small levy, 3 basis points  a  year,\r\n\r\nover  a period of 10 years.  But the exact levy will vary\r\n\r\ndepending  on  the state of the bank and the  supervisory\r\n\r\nassessment of the bank on how risky it is.  So  the  levy\r\n\r\nwill vary from bank to bank, but it will be a small levy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, does MAS have any scheme to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  deposits of large depositors  and  what  do\r\n\r\nthese other countries do for their large depositors?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, generally\r\n\r\nspeaking,  deposit insurance schemes have a  cap.   Their\r\n\r\npurpose is to protect small depositors because they  will\r\n\r\nfind  it  difficult to get enough information  about  the\r\n\r\nbanks and to make a considered assessment as to which  is\r\n\r\na  safe  bank  to  put their money.  Big  depositors  are\r\n\r\nexpected  to make their own judgment and decide where  it\r\n\r\nis  safe to put their money and not to vest their savings\r\n\r\nto  banks which are unsafe.  This is not just a necessary\r\n\r\nevil  but  it  is  the way the system  works.   If  every\r\n\r\ndepositor  can  put money, regardless  of  amounts,  into\r\n\r\nbanks,  however unsafe and be confident that it  will  be\r\n\r\ninsured by some deposit insurance scheme, then you have a\r\n\r\nmoral hazard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  means  that  the depositor does  not  have  to  pay\r\n\r\nattention  to whether the bank is safe and  the  bank  is\r\n\r\nunder  no pressure to perform and to become a sound  bank\r\n\r\nin order to attract deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, nearly all deposit insurance schemes got\r\n\r\ncaps.   The  caps vary.  We have set our cap  at  $20,000\r\n\r\nwhich covers 85% of deposits in Singapore.  We think that\r\n\r\nis  sufficient.  Some countries have higher caps.   Where\r\n\r\nthey do, it is sometimes the result of political pressure\r\n\r\nrather  than because it is prudentially a sound thing  to\r\n\r\ndo  or  because  there is a need for it.  In  fact,  Alan\r\n\r\nGreenspan, advising against raising the deposit insurance\r\n\r\ncap  in the US recently, said, \"This is the solution, but\r\n\r\nwhat is the problem?\"  But, nevertheless, the problem was\r\n\r\nthat this was election year and the Bill was passed.   We\r\n\r\nare  setting it at $20,000 which we think is the  correct\r\n\r\nlevel.  If you look at Japan, of course, they have no cap\r\n\r\nwhatsoever, but there banks are in quite an extraordinary\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>REBATES IN LIFE INSURANCE INDUSTRY</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Miss Penny Low</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand  Minister  for Finance (a) what is the  rationale  or\r\n\r\nobjective behind the reversal of the policy on rebates in\r\n\r\nthe  life  insurance industry; and (b)  in  view  of  the\r\n\r\nFinancial   Advisers  Act,  how  will  this  affect   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  a professional group of people  such  as\r\n\r\nfinancial advisers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nprohibition   on  rebates  under  MAS  Notice   304   was\r\n\r\nintroduced in the 1990s to prevent life insurance  agents\r\n\r\nor brokers from rebating, or offering to rebate, any part\r\n\r\nof  their  commissions as an \"inducement\" to  clients  to\r\n\r\npurchase   life  insurance  policies,  without  assessing\r\n\r\nwhether the policies were appropriate for the clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS discourages the use of rebates by any life\r\n\r\ninsurance adviser as the basis for his recommendation  to\r\n\r\nany\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicyholder.   It  still  discourages  this   with   the\r\n\r\nFinancial Advisers Act, which requires financial advisers\r\n\r\nand  their representatives to have a reasonable basis for\r\n\r\ntheir recommendation. Recommendations are expected to  be\r\n\r\nreasonable   and   appropriate,  having  considered   the\r\n\r\ninvestment objectives, financial situation and  financial\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the  clients.  Financial  advisers  and  their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  should  focus  on  the  value  of  their\r\n\r\nservices  to their clients and should not resort  to  the\r\n\r\noffering of rebates as a basis for their recommendation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life insurance companies have effectively\r\n\r\nimplemented  the  best  practice recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Efficient Distribution of  Life  Insurance\r\n\r\n(CEDLI),   including  a  Needs-based  sales  process,   a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  Training  and Competency  regime  for  its\r\n\r\nadvisers   and  Enhanced  Disclosure  of  life  insurance\r\n\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has therefore lifted the outright prohibition on\r\n\r\nrebates contained in MAS Notice 304. This is in line with\r\n\r\nthe  Authority's shift from a regulatory to a supervisory\r\n\r\napproach.  We  are  progressively replacing  prescriptive\r\n\r\nregulations  with  principle-based  regulations,  as  the\r\n\r\nmarket   demonstrates  the  maturity   to   follow   best\r\n\r\npractices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insurance companies can decide for themselves how to\r\n\r\npackage  and market their products without the ban.  This\r\n\r\nrelaxation should not lower professional standards of the\r\n\r\nlife  insurance advisers, because unprofessional  conduct\r\n\r\nwill not be viewed any less seriously under the Financial\r\n\r\nAdvisers Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I should clarify that the CPF Board has\r\n\r\ndecided   that  where  rebates  are  given  for  products\r\n\r\npurchased  using  CPF  savings,  the  rebates  should  be\r\n\r\nrefunded to the CPF accounts so that members' savings can\r\n\r\nbe safeguarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, how would\r\n\r\nMAS  then  regulate  and monitor the policy  of  what  is\r\n\r\nconsidered an \"inducement\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is one of\r\n\r\nthose  questions  which is impossible to  answer  in  the\r\n\r\nabstract.

Through  the\r\n\r\npublicity efforts, we hope to create awareness  and  help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans understand the benefits of ElderShield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, 21% of Singaporeans aged 40 to 69 who are\r\n\r\neligible  for  auto-cover have opted out of  ElderShield.\r\n\r\nSome  of  them  may already have adequate  coverage  from\r\n\r\nprivate insurance plans, while others in the lower income\r\n\r\ngroup  may  feel that they may not be able to afford  the\r\n\r\npremiums.   For  those  in  the  low  income  group,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   will  continue  to  help  them  meet   their\r\n\r\nhealthcare  expenses  through  other  avenues,  such   as\r\n\r\nMedifund and subsidies at the nursing homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent weeks, 1,780 Singaporeans who opted out have\r\n\r\nchanged  their mind and opted back in again.  For  others\r\n\r\nwho wish to do so, both ElderShield insurers have devised\r\n\r\na  simple process for these people to withdraw their Opt-out  Forms,  and still accord them auto-cover  status  so\r\n\r\nlong  as  they inform the insurers of their new decisions\r\n\r\nbefore 30th September this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the time limit of 15th August 2002 to open a CPF\r\n\r\naccount   so   as   to   qualify  for  auto-cover   under\r\n\r\nElderShield, I believe Singaporeans have been given ample\r\n\r\ntime  to do so since the publicity on ElderShield started\r\n\r\nin  end  June  2002.   As at 15th August  2002,  only  11\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  in  the age group of 40  to  69  have  come\r\n\r\nforward to open an account.

We try to start off with a basic scheme,  and\r\n\r\nit  is quite understandable that a certain percentage  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans may assess that this scheme does  not  quite\r\n\r\nmeet  their needs.  For example, those in the high income\r\n\r\ngroups  may feel that $300 pay-out is too low  for  them,\r\n\r\nand they will find their own means to seek other covers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the low income groups, as I said earlier, the\r\n\r\nGovernment will continue to look after them if they  meet\r\n\r\nthe means test through our step-down care facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, the name\r\n\r\n\"ElderShield\" is actually very misleading because,  as  I\r\n\r\nsee,  it  is  actually  a disability  scheme.   Will  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  consider changing the name, so as  to  be  more\r\n\r\nreflective of the objective and purpose of the scheme?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, severe disability insurance\r\n\r\ncomes  under different terms.  In the private sector,  it\r\n\r\nis  called long-term care insurance.  In other countries,\r\n\r\nit  is  called severe disability insurance.  In our case,\r\n\r\nwe  coin the word \"ElderShield\" so that it is easier  for\r\n\r\npeople  to  identify  the  scheme.   Essentially,  severe\r\n\r\ndisability  sets in primarily  when a person is  elderly.\r\n\r\nSo it is meant primarily for the elderly people.  But, of\r\n\r\ncourse, severe disability can set in any time.  A  person\r\n\r\ncan  have  a stroke when he is 45, and he will  still  be\r\n\r\ncovered.   But  I  think we want to reflect  the  primary\r\n\r\npurpose of this scheme, which is for the elderly.

We  start\r\n\r\noff  with a very basic scheme of $300, so as to keep  the\r\n\r\npremiums as affordable as possible.  If we raise the pay-out  to $600, then the premiums will be double, and  even\r\n\r\nmore Singaporeans will opt out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of introducing this scheme, we want a\r\n\r\nsimple scheme and as affordable as possible.  And  as  we\r\n\r\ngain  more experience, we will allow the insurers to have\r\n\r\ntop-ups to the scheme.  So it is quite conceivable that 3-5  years  from now, the insurers will offer  higher  pay-outs,  and  correspondingly  higher  premiums.   But  the\r\n\r\nprimary objective in launching this scheme is to  get  as\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans sign up as possible.   So  we  want  a\r\n\r\nbasic scheme with low premiums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether it\r\n\r\nis  correct to say that the majority of Singaporeans take\r\n\r\nup  insurance  for peace of mind and for any eventuality?\r\n\r\nTherefore,  if  ElderShield does not  adequately  address\r\n\r\nthis  basic issue, then it is deficient.  The purpose  of\r\n\r\nthis  national insurance scheme as ElderShield  can  only\r\n\r\nlessen  the  load  of the people and not  help  in  their\r\n\r\nneeds.   Therefore, the rich, as the Minister  has  said,\r\n\r\nprobably do not need this scheme, and those who are  poor\r\n\r\nand  the ones that are most in need will find this scheme\r\n\r\ninadequate to ease their difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, that is not true, because if\r\n\r\nyou are from the low income group and you are admitted to\r\n\r\na  nursing home and you meet the means test, the  nursing\r\n\r\nhome  will probably  charge about $1,000 per month.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  will subsidise 75%, which is $750,  and  your\r\n\r\npay-out  is $250.  So I think the $300 goes some  way  in\r\n\r\nmeeting  the expenses.  We are not saying that  the  $300\r\n\r\nwill  pay  for  everything  that  you  need  if  you  are\r\n\r\ndisabled.   We want to keep the scheme as simple  and  as\r\n\r\naffordable  as possible.  We set it at $300 because  that\r\n\r\nmakes  some sense in relation to somebody who is  in  the\r\n\r\nlow income and will enjoy subsidies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the Government if he is admitted to a nursing home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, if people think that this scheme does not\r\n\r\nquite meet their needs, they can opt out.  And five years\r\n\r\nlater  when the insurers offer a higher pay-out of $1,000\r\n\r\nand if they think that it meets their needs, they can opt\r\n\r\nin  again.  But at that time when they opt in, they  will\r\n\r\nhave to pass a medical test.

May I ask the Minister whether  the\r\n\r\nenhanced  scheme  will  be  accompanied  by  a  hike   in\r\n\r\npremiums?  Will Singaporeans feel the burden if  premiums\r\n\r\nrose?   And will people feel short-changed having to  pay\r\n\r\nmore  and more for ElderShield coverage after some  time,\r\n\r\ndespite   paying  for  many  years,  as  the  ElderShield\r\n\r\npremiums  will  only remain unchanged for the  next  five\r\n\r\nyears?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> ElderShield is a scheme based on\r\n\r\nactuarial calculations.  So, the more people we have, the\r\n\r\nbigger  the  risk pool.  Then, of course, those  who  are\r\n\r\nlower risk will subsidise those who are higher risk.  The\r\n\r\nidea  is  to  go  out with at least a  minimum  cover  of\r\n\r\n250,000  people.  That is what the actuarial  consultants\r\n\r\ntell  us  is  needed as the minimum risk pool.   Anything\r\n\r\nbeyond  250,000 participants, we have a sound  basis  for\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have put in the contract with the insurers\r\n\r\ncertain safeguards.  As I said, we start off with a  very\r\n\r\nsimple  scheme  -  $300 pay-out and we keep the  premiums\r\n\r\nas affordable as possible.  We understand that this is  a\r\n\r\nvery new scheme.  The insurers do not have very much data\r\n\r\nto  go  by.   They use our own data.  We  have  done  two\r\n\r\nlongitudinal  studies.   We  have  taken  the   data   of\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries.   Here, you  are  calculating  your\r\n\r\nobligations  for the next 40-50 years.   Because  if  you\r\n\r\ntake  somebody in at age 40, he may live till 85-90.   So\r\n\r\nyou  are going to do all these actuarial calculations  to\r\n\r\ncalculate your obligations 40-50 years down the road.   I\r\n\r\nthink  the  consultants and the actuaries have been  very\r\n\r\nconservative.   And  that  is  the  reason  why  in   the\r\n\r\ncontract, we have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilt  in  provisions that if the claim history  is  less\r\n\r\nthan  what they projected, then they will offer a  rebate\r\n\r\nto  the  holders.  If the claim history turns out  to  be\r\n\r\nhigher  than  the  projection, then, of course,  we  will\r\n\r\nallow them to raise the premium.  Because this scheme  is\r\n\r\nactuarial based and it must be self funding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the basis of the insurance is that you\r\n\r\nare paying a premium and the pay out ratio is between 1:4\r\n\r\nor  1:5.  And if Singaporeans want peace of mind and they\r\n\r\nare  prepared  to  set aside this small  sum  from  their\r\n\r\nMedisave, then they participate.  If they think they  can\r\n\r\nlook after themselves, then they opt out.  The choice  is\r\n\r\ntheirs.   What  we try to do is to provide this  facility\r\n\r\nwhich  is open to Singaporeans and encourage as  many  as\r\n\r\npossible to join in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether he\r\n\r\nagrees that a person who is unable to do three activities\r\n\r\nof  daily living is unlikely to get better and, in  fact,\r\n\r\nmost  likely to get worse with time?   Therefore,  is  it\r\n\r\nnot  inhumane to cut off payment after five  years?   The\r\n\r\nMinister  will  probably reply that the majority  of  the\r\n\r\ndisabled will not need aid for more than five years.   My\r\n\r\nquestion to the Minister is: what about those who survive\r\n\r\nmore than five years, by which time their financial needs\r\n\r\nwill even become more critical?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, as I said, we are starting a\r\n\r\nvery  new scheme.  When we call the tender, we could have\r\n\r\nsaid $300 and pay out until death, in which case there is\r\n\r\nno  prescribed cap. Or we could call the tender  and  say\r\n\r\n$300  up to a maximum of 60 months.  Then there is a cap.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  insurers will tender accordingly.   We  decided\r\n\r\nthat, as a start, we put a cap so that the insurers  have\r\n\r\nas  much certainty as possible to bid for the tender.  If\r\n\r\nwe  have put $300 and pay out until the person dies, then\r\n\r\nthere is additional uncertainty and the risk is that  the\r\n\r\ninsurer  may tender at a higher price or ask  for  higher\r\n\r\npremiums to cover the risk.  So we want to start off with\r\n\r\na scheme which is as simple as possible.  And as we build\r\n\r\nup experience and knowledge, then we can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  enhancements.

Then the insurers will  be  able  to\r\n\r\ncalculate  and say what additional premium you will  have\r\n\r\nto  pay  to  have  that enhancement.

May I ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhat kind of percentage out of the present 8% of severely\r\n\r\ndisabled people that can qualify for these claims?  Based\r\n\r\non the strict criteria by the medical assessors, I should\r\n\r\nthink  that  this percentage must be very  small  indeed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, is this not a very profitable scheme  for  the\r\n\r\ninsurers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also ask the Minister whether the criteria set\r\n\r\nfor  ElderShield  claims on the aid of special  equipment\r\n\r\nwill be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincreasingly   disadvantageous   to   policyholders    as\r\n\r\ntechnology   becomes  progressively  more  advanced   and\r\n\r\nefficient?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also ask the Minister on the repeated\r\n\r\npublications  by the Ministry of Health and the  insurers\r\n\r\nciting that based on the British experience, men have 35%\r\n\r\nrisk,  and women 45% of being disabled some time in their\r\n\r\nlives.

But, more  importantly,  on  a\r\n\r\nbigger  picture, should the Ministry of Health and people\r\n\r\nnot  be  alarmed by such possible high disability figure;\r\n\r\ntherefore, more proactive actions on preventive  measures\r\n\r\nshould  be  embarked on urgently to prevent getting  such\r\n\r\nincidents?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all insurance\r\n\r\nclaims need to go through an assessment process.  For the\r\n\r\nElderShield, we have set up a group of assessors who  are\r\n\r\nGPs  to make this assessment.  If the policyholder is not\r\n\r\nhappy with the assessment done by the assessors, there is\r\n\r\na  channel  for appeal to the Ministry.  But it  is  very\r\n\r\nearly  days.

Right\r\n\r\nnow,  we still do not have enough cases to determine  one\r\n\r\nway  or  the other whether the assessors have been overly\r\n\r\nstrict or overly lenient.  I think we need at least  two,\r\n\r\nthree,  maybe  five, years to build up  some  kind  of  a\r\n\r\npattern.

This disrupted the natural  gas\r\n\r\nsupply  to  SembCorp  Gas  and its  gas  customers.   The\r\n\r\nactivation  of  the  emergency  valve  is  part  of   the\r\n\r\nprotection design to prevent unsafe conditions in the gas\r\n\r\nnetwork such as over-pressure.  Conoco has reported  that\r\n\r\na  false  alarm  from  one of the monitoring  instruments\r\n\r\nactivated the emergency valve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas-fired plants, although designed to also run\r\n\r\non  diesel, could not switch over from gas to  diesel  in\r\n\r\ntime  as  gas  pressure was lost very rapidly.   Instead,\r\n\r\nfour standby diesel-fired turbine generators were pressed\r\n\r\ninto  service.  It took about half an hour to  bring  all\r\n\r\nthese  units  into  operation from a  cold  start.   This\r\n\r\nstabilised the system, and thereafter electricity  supply\r\n\r\nwas restored to the affected areas progressively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the emergency shutdown valve was accidentally\r\n\r\ntripped, Conoco has stopped all non-essential maintenance\r\n\r\nwork at the ORF until investigations are completed.  They\r\n\r\nhave  also  changed  the computer  logic  by  temporarily\r\n\r\ndisabling  tripping by this instrument in  the  automated\r\n\r\nsafety system.  Any tripping will be done manually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Task Force comprising members from the industry\r\n\r\nand the Energy Market Authority (EMA) has been set up  to\r\n\r\nidentify all likely factors that could activate  the  ESD\r\n\r\nvalve  and  cause  gas disruption.

This system rewards workers more  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis of their seniority in service and less on  the\r\n\r\nvalue of the job.  Subsequently a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntripartite  committee  under the National  Wages  Council\r\n\r\nstudied  ways  to make our wage system more flexible  and\r\n\r\nlinked to the value of the job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Wages Council Tripartite Committee on\r\n\r\nWage  Reform recommended that a flexible wage system with\r\n\r\na variable component be implemented.  It also recommended\r\n\r\nthat  wages should reflect the value of the job and  that\r\n\r\nsalary  ranges  should  not be too  wide.   A  reasonable\r\n\r\nmaximum to minimum salary ratio could be 1.5: 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the implementation of the above\r\n\r\nrecommendations, we have made progress.  Today more  than\r\n\r\n80%  of the companies have implemented the flexible  wage\r\n\r\nsystem  with  a year-end variable component and  the  one\r\n\r\nmonth  Annual Wage Supplement or otherwise known  as  the\r\n\r\n13th  month pay, amounting to about 15% to 16%  of  total\r\n\r\nwages.   The  variable  component  enables  companies  to\r\n\r\nreward   workers   based   on  company   and   individual\r\n\r\nperformance.   On  the seniority-based  wage  system  the\r\n\r\nratio  between the maximum and minimum salary points  for\r\n\r\nmany  jobs has been brought down from more than 2.5 times\r\n\r\nto between 1.5 and 2 times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While progress has been made in building up the\r\n\r\nvariable  component, which is often paid at  the  end  of\r\n\r\neach  year, our wage system is still not flexible  enough\r\n\r\nto  respond  to the rapidly changing business conditions.\r\n\r\nHence,  in  1999  the National Wages Council  recommended\r\n\r\nthat  a  monthly  variable  component  be  introduced  to\r\n\r\nenhance the flexibility of our wage system.  With  regard\r\n\r\nto  the seniority-based wage system, more efforts have to\r\n\r\nbe  made to further narrow the maximum to minimum  salary\r\n\r\nratio  and  to  actively promote a system  which  rewards\r\n\r\nworkers  based  on  the  value  of  the  job  and   their\r\n\r\ncontribution.  This will enhance the cost-competitiveness\r\n\r\nand employability of older workers who face a higher risk\r\n\r\nof losing their job and greater difficulty of seeking re-employment due to our seniority wage system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the Economic Review Committee Sub-committee on Taxation, CPF, Wages and Land has been\r\n\r\ntasked  to review the wage system in Singapore.

In\r\n\r\nthe  mid-80s,  as  I  mentioned in  my  main  reply,  the\r\n\r\nTripartite  Committee  considered that  if  the  variable\r\n\r\ncomponent comprised something like 18-20%, we would  have\r\n\r\nmore  or less achieved significant progress and we  would\r\n\r\nhave  succeeded to make our wage system flexible  enough.\r\n\r\nWe  are  almost  there.  As I said, 80% of our  companies\r\n\r\nhave  adopted  the  variable wage system.   The  variable\r\n\r\ncomponent  is  around 16-18%.  But in recent  years,  the\r\n\r\npace  of  change has been so fast.  Competition has  been\r\n\r\nheating  up  so  rapidly.   We may  not  be  sufficiently\r\n\r\nflexible with what we have achieved so far.  So  we  have\r\n\r\nto push the envelope up a little bit more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very difficult to determine, at this point in\r\n\r\ntime, what percentage of the wages should be variable for\r\n\r\nus  to be truly flexible, adaptable and responsive to the\r\n\r\nmarket changes.  I think that can only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  determined in the actual labour or employment  market\r\n\r\nsituation and also in the context of economic performance\r\n\r\nof  the  day.   It  is  rather difficult  to  predict  in\r\n\r\nadvance.   But  what we want is to evolve a  system,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, the monthly variable component, where  you  set\r\n\r\naside  10%,  or  maybe 12% of your  monthly  wages  as  a\r\n\r\nvariable component which companies may be able to adjust,\r\n\r\nif  there  is a sudden downturn in demand, or  businesses\r\n\r\ndrop  sharply.   The  company  can  then  use  this  MVC,\r\n\r\ncomprising  about 10% of the monthly wages,  to  make  an\r\n\r\nadjustment  which  helps  the  company  to  weather   the\r\n\r\ndownturn  and  also reduce the burden on the  company  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  do not have to instantly resort to redundancy\r\n\r\nor retrenching workers.  These are just ballpark targets.\r\n\r\nBut  whether  10% is enough will have to  depend  on  the\r\n\r\nstate of the economy and the kind of competitive pressure\r\n\r\nthat  we  have to face.  It may well be that the  10%  is\r\n\r\nsufficient.   But  it may also be that, as  the  scenario\r\n\r\nunfolds,  we may need to build up more of our wages  into\r\n\r\nthe  monthly variable component.  So let us take an open-minded approach to this.  Let us continue to progress  on\r\n\r\nour development of a flexible wage system and then assess\r\n\r\nour  competitiveness  and ability  to  resist  all  these\r\n\r\nsudden changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> There are two parts to this. One\r\n\r\nis the flexible system that allows companies to cut costs\r\n\r\ndown  quickly.   The  other is the  seniority-based  wage\r\n\r\nsystem, and my focus is actually on seniority-based  wage\r\n\r\nsystem.  I would just like to clarify if my understanding\r\n\r\nis  correct.  What we are talking about here, in terms of\r\n\r\nmonthly variable component, is actually a variable system\r\n\r\nbut  within  a  seniority-based wage  system.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the  older workers are still getting more,  which\r\n\r\nmeans  that  this  particular emphasis on  MVC  will  not\r\n\r\nactually address the seniority-based wage system.   Would\r\n\r\nthat be the correct understanding?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> With regard to the seniority-based wage system, as I said earlier on, we started out\r\n\r\nin  the mid-80s with a maximum to minimum ratio of 2.5 to\r\n\r\nas  high  as 3.3.  Over the years, this has been  trimmed\r\n\r\ndown.  Today, we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naround  2 to 1.5.  I think maybe 1.5 is about reasonable,\r\n\r\nthat means, between the starting point and the last point\r\n\r\nin  the salary scale, it is a difference of 1.5.  That is\r\n\r\nwhat the NWC Tripartite Committee recommended in the mid-80s to be a reasonable maximum to minimum ratio.  We have\r\n\r\nnot  quite arrived at it.  Some companies have, but there\r\n\r\nare still many other companies operating at a ratio of 2.\r\n\r\nSo   they  will  have  to  individually  start  to   make\r\n\r\nadjustment  to  try  to  bring this seniority-based  wage\r\n\r\nscale  to  the figure of about 1.5:1.

The other point  is\r\n\r\nin  fact how much longer will it take us to get that 1.5,\r\n\r\nif  we  have a real confidence level that this will  take\r\n\r\ncare  of  the  problem.  And I am asking this  because  I\r\n\r\nthink  they are all anxious that in the future we do  not\r\n\r\nhave to resort to CPF cuts for older workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said, 1.5\r\n\r\nwas  set as a target by the NWC in the mid-80s.  We  have\r\n\r\nnot  quite  reached  this target.   When  we  reach  this\r\n\r\ntarget,  we  will  have to assess whether,  in  fact,  as\r\n\r\nexpected  by NWC in making the recommendation, 1.5  would\r\n\r\nbe  a  reasonable  figure.   Of course,  the  competitive\r\n\r\nenvironment changes all the time, the nature of jobs  and\r\n\r\ncompetition  in  the employment market  changes  all  the\r\n\r\ntime.   So we cannot tie ourselves down to say that  this\r\n\r\nshall  be the ratio forever and ever.  We have to realise\r\n\r\nthat   the  labour  market  is  in  a  state  of  dynamic\r\n\r\nequilibrium.

But even if at\r\n\r\n1.5, we find that older workers are continually suffering\r\n\r\na  disadvantage,  in  the sense that  they  have  greater\r\n\r\ndifficulty retaining their jobs, they are retrenched,  or\r\n\r\nthey  have even greater difficulty seeking re-employment,\r\n\r\nthen we have to address this issue whether in fact 1.5 is\r\n\r\nreasonable, or in fact it should be even less than that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nhow  we  can have comfort in knowing where we are  going.\r\n\r\nJust trying to determine that we do not see a repetition,\r\n\r\nhow  would  we know that we are actually making progress?\r\n\r\nBecause  it  would be a sad situation 10 years  down  the\r\n\r\nroad  to be looking at the same picture again.

We  took\r\n\r\ncareful  consideration in the mid-80s with the Tripartite\r\n\r\nCommittee  and we have been promoting this concept  of  a\r\n\r\nflexible wage scheme and shrinking the difference between\r\n\r\nthe maximum and minimum ratio in our seniority-based wage\r\n\r\nscale  progressively and carefully.  So  it  is  not  the\r\n\r\nintention  of  the Government to force changes  upon  the\r\n\r\npeople  unnecessarily.   And if, in fact, as I said,  the\r\n\r\neconomic situation takes a turn for the worse and we  are\r\n\r\nseeing  a  dramatic  increase in unemployment  among  the\r\n\r\nolder workers, then it would be foolish of us to say that\r\n\r\nwe  had  adopted a certain target years ago, this  target\r\n\r\nshould remain in place and we should not make any further\r\n\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not that we wish to impose changes on our\r\n\r\nworkers  unnecessarily.

I  cannot  remember  exactly  what  was  the\r\n\r\ntimeframe.  The hon. Member may be correct in saying that\r\n\r\nit  was  over  two collective agreements  which,  in  our\r\n\r\ncontext,  would mean about six years maximum,  because  a\r\n\r\ncollective  agreement runs for up to a maximum  of  three\r\n\r\nyears.

We have and will  continue\r\n\r\nto  deal  with  abusive employers  firmly.   My  Ministry\r\n\r\nreiterates  its  call  for employers  to  treat   foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  with  dignity  and respect.   Indeed,  the  vast\r\n\r\nmajority  of  foreign domestic workers in  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nwell  treated  and  have found work in  Singapore  to  be\r\n\r\nrewarding.  Regrettably, there remains a very small group\r\n\r\nof  employers who treat their foreign workers shamefully.\r\n\r\nTo this group, let me remind them that we are resolute in\r\n\r\npunishing  errant  employers  who  abuse  their   foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic  workers.  As a strong deterrent against  abuse,\r\n\r\nthe  Penal  Code was amended in 1998 to enhance penalties\r\n\r\ncommitted  against a domestic worker by one  and  a  half\r\n\r\ntimes.   Since  then,  the  number  of  abuse  cases  has\r\n\r\ndeclined  significantly.  According to  the  Police,  the\r\n\r\nnumber of substantiated abuse cases has dropped from  157\r\n\r\ncases  in  1997 to 41 cases in 2001 and 8 cases  up  till\r\n\r\nJune  this  year.   This  shows  that  firm  action   and\r\n\r\ndeterrent  penalties are effective measures against  such\r\n\r\nabuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now respond to Ms Irene Ng and Mr Chiam See\r\n\r\nTong's  queries more specifically.  My Ministry  had,  in\r\n\r\nMay, this year announced a mandatory accreditation scheme\r\n\r\nfor  employment  agencies dealing with  foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers to help upgrade their professional standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accredited employment agents who put in greater\r\n\r\neffort  to  recruit, train and prepare  foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers  for work in Singapore households will  ensure  a\r\n\r\nbetter  match  between the employer and foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworker.  This will foster a more healthy employer-foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic  worker relationship and  reduce  the  potential\r\n\r\nfor conflict, complaints and abuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the suggestion to make it compulsory for doctors\r\n\r\nto  ascertain  if  a  foreign domestic  worker  has  been\r\n\r\nphysically abused, the Member of Parliament may  wish  to\r\n\r\nknow  that  under  the Criminal Procedure  Code,  anyone,\r\n\r\nincluding the doctor who is aware of physical abuse,  has\r\n\r\na  legal  obligation to report the matter to the  Police.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  of  Health and my Ministry  are  currently\r\n\r\nworking  on  a  set of guidelines to help doctors  better\r\n\r\nidentify cases of physical abuse.  Doctors will  also  be\r\n\r\nreminded to report cases of abuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it would be prudent to focus more on\r\n\r\npreventing   abuse   of    foreign   domestic    workers.\r\n\r\nAccordingly,  we  will  require first-time  employers  of\r\n\r\nforeign   domestic   workers  to  undergo   a   mandatory\r\n\r\norientation  programme.  This measure  will  enhance  the\r\n\r\nMinistry's  ongoing educational efforts to  promote  good\r\n\r\nemployment  practices,  harmonious working  relationships\r\n\r\nand  mutual respect.  The orientation programme will also\r\n\r\nhighlight to employers the severe consequences they  face\r\n\r\nif they abuse their foreign domestic workers.  Details of\r\n\r\nthe  orientation  programme  will  be  announced  in  due\r\n\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present debate on maid abuse has also led to\r\n\r\ncalls  for the Government to impose minimum standards  of\r\n\r\nemployment,  as  suggested by  Mdm  Halimah,  to  protect\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic workers.  Unlike other workers, foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic workers work and stay in their employer's  house\r\n\r\nthroughout  the  day.   The nature of  work,  the  duties\r\n\r\nperformed and the standard of performance also vary  from\r\n\r\nhousehold  to household.  It is, therefore, not practical\r\n\r\nto  lay down in law standard rules regarding the specific\r\n\r\nemployment conditions for foreign domestic workers.   For\r\n\r\nexample, it is difficult to determine the actual hours of\r\n\r\nwork  for  foreign  domestic workers since  they  perform\r\n\r\nactive work interspersed with some free time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having prescribed rules would make it difficult for\r\n\r\nemployers  and  foreign domestic workers to  comply,  and\r\n\r\nalso for the authorities to enforce them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the difficulty of defining standard\r\n\r\nconditions   of  employment,  my  Ministry   has   always\r\n\r\nencouraged employers and their domestic workers  to  work\r\n\r\nout  defined terms, based on mutual agreement and on  the\r\n\r\nspecific   needs  of  the  two  parties,  to  avoid   any\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding.   Many foreign  domestic  workers  have\r\n\r\nsigned  written contracts with their employers  with  the\r\n\r\nhelp  of  their employment agents and, in some instances,\r\n\r\nwith  the  help  of their Embassies.  I  agree  with  Mdm\r\n\r\nHalimah that this practice should be further encouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To safeguard the welfare of foreign workers, my\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  set up a Foreign Workers Unit  to  provide\r\n\r\nfree  conciliation services for those who encounter work-related  problems with their employers.  The  Unit  works\r\n\r\nclosely   with  the  Embassies  of  the  foreign  workers\r\n\r\nconcerned,  and has been able to resolve practically  all\r\n\r\ndisputes amicably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to remind employers of foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic workers that they are ultimately responsible for\r\n\r\nthe  welfare of the foreign domestic worker.   It  is  an\r\n\r\nemployer's  duty to take good care of the  workers  under\r\n\r\ntheir  employ.

One is specific, the other general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, we would like to allow the maids to\r\n\r\nhave  avenues  for  complaint.   That  is  why  we  issue\r\n\r\nadvisories.  They are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwritten  in  about  17  languages,  because  our  foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic workers come from 17 language-based regions.  We\r\n\r\nalso  give  hotline numbers so that they have avenues  or\r\n\r\nrecourse to reporting such abuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second, and more general approach, is to raise\r\n\r\nthe  threshold of reasonableness for employers.  This  is\r\n\r\nmore difficult, because we have more than 140,000 foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic  workers  and,  therefore,  more  than   140,000\r\n\r\nemployers and their household members.  The threshold for\r\n\r\nreasonableness  and, therefore, the potential  for  other\r\n\r\nforms  of abuse can vary from household to household.   A\r\n\r\nhousehold  may  declare  it does not  quite  consider  it\r\n\r\nabuse, but it may indeed be abuse.  How do we raise  this\r\n\r\nthreshold of reasonableness?   One, as we said,  is  that\r\n\r\nwe  encourage written contracts to stipulate mutual terms\r\n\r\nof   employment.   The  other,  which  I   have   already\r\n\r\nmentioned, is the maid accreditation scheme.   There  are\r\n\r\ncurrently  about 800 employment agencies that  deal  with\r\n\r\nplacement of foreign domestic workers.  We would like  to\r\n\r\nraise this level so that the employment agencies can help\r\n\r\nbetter train and orientate these foreign domestic workers\r\n\r\nbefore they join the households.  The other aspect is the\r\n\r\nmandatory  orientation  programmes  which  I  have   also\r\n\r\nmentioned, where both the employer and employee come  for\r\n\r\na course and we can explain the terms and conditions, and\r\n\r\nwhat  to  expect from one another.  This will  raise  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  level of threshold to what would  be  a  healthy\r\n\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, the majority of foreign domestic\r\n\r\nworkers who work in Singapore, do find it rewarding.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of abuses has come down, but we will continue  to\r\n\r\nadd on to the efforts that have been successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my\r\n\r\nunderstanding that maid agencies themselves are sometimes\r\n\r\nguilty of abuse of maids.  I wonder how the accreditation\r\n\r\nsystem will be able to weed out such maid agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the hon.

As  I  said, accreditation is not  a  specific\r\n\r\nprogramme  but more a general one.  We think that  if  we\r\n\r\nraise  the  level  of performance of the maid  employment\r\n\r\nagencies and have minimum standards and programmes  which\r\n\r\nwill  raise their level of professionalism, a  number  of\r\n\r\nleaders  will  emerge who will give  value-add  to  those\r\n\r\nemployers who want foreign domestic workers and who  will\r\n\r\nalso   be  more  responsible  for  the  foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the answer is that it does not quite prevent\r\n\r\nspecific abuses.  If there are specific abuses,  we  will\r\n\r\ndeal  with  them legally.

But I still  think  it  is\r\n\r\npossible to consider prescribing some minimum terms,  eg,\r\n\r\nnumber  of  rest  hours a day, rest days a  week,  annual\r\n\r\nleave, sick leave, etc.  Will the Minister consider that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the question of inspectors, is it\r\n\r\npossible   for   the  Ministry  to  consider   appointing\r\n\r\ninspectors to do random checks?  I understand it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible.  If there are 140,000 maids, there are probably\r\n\r\n140,000 households but, at least, the random checks  done\r\n\r\non  such  households will act as a deterrent to employers\r\n\r\nwho  employ  maids to behave in a humane and fair  manner\r\n\r\ntowards their maids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mdm Halimah has touched on a number\r\n\r\nof points.  We need to deal with them separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, encouraging employers and their maids to have\r\n\r\nprescribed  working conditions, and I  have  said  we  do\r\n\r\nencourage it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo, trying to craft it in legislation.

There is a balance to this.  How much\r\n\r\ndo  we  want to intrude into households versus protecting\r\n\r\nthe maids?  We have moved somewhat along those lines,  in\r\n\r\nterms   of   the  accreditation  scheme  for   employment\r\n\r\nagencies, where we require them to check on the maids who\r\n\r\nare  placed  with the employers twice within  six  months\r\n\r\nfrom commencement of work.  So, that is moving somewhere.\r\n\r\nTo  have  a full force of inspectors going from house  to\r\n\r\nhouse  periodically  asking  how  the  maids  have   been\r\n\r\ntreated,  how they are, and seeing whether the  terms  of\r\n\r\nthe  employment conditions have been met,  is  a  radical\r\n\r\njump.  I am not sure whether that is the way to move.  It\r\n\r\nis  an intrusion.  We do not think that the situation  of\r\n\r\nmaid  abuse quite warrants that drastic measure  because,\r\n\r\nas  I have mentioned, eight cases were reported and there\r\n\r\nhas  been a drop.  So, our measures seem to have  worked.\r\n\r\nWe  will move on the more encouraging measures before  we\r\n\r\nmove more into enforcement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I am glad to\r\n\r\nhear  that the Government is introducing this orientation\r\n\r\nprogramme  for maids.

The reason for this  scheme  which  we\r\n\r\nthought would help is that - Mr Chiam said for the  maid,\r\n\r\nbut  it is not quite for the maid - it is really for  the\r\n\r\nemployer and the employee both to be put in the same room\r\n\r\nbefore  she starts work, and for a third party to explain\r\n\r\nthe  conditions and what it means to work in a household.\r\n\r\nWhether  we  do it through a third party or  MOM  engages\r\n\r\nprofessional  bodies for it to be done, we have  to  work\r\n\r\nout the details.

It sends a\r\n\r\nsignal  to  the employer that, yes, the foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworker  is  under his employ but he has to be responsible\r\n\r\nbecause  there  are  bodies  within  the  Government  and\r\n\r\nprofessional organisations who are also looking after the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of this lady, and this worker can have  recourse\r\n\r\nto  MOM or other agencies.  It also sends a signal to the\r\n\r\nmaid  that there are rights and that she can be protected\r\n\r\nand this is where she can turn to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think over and above that, it also helps set out a\r\n\r\ntone  before  a  foreign domestic  worker  works  in  the\r\n\r\nhousehold that this is an employer-employee relationship.\r\n\r\nI  think that will be the more useful signal that we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to send.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will allow another two more questions\r\n\r\nand then move on to the next Question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> I would just like to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister  of State why he  is  confining  these\r\n\r\norientation   courses   to  just  first-time   employers.\r\n\r\nCertainly those who have employed maids before  ought  to\r\n\r\nbe reminded from time to time of their obligations to and\r\n\r\nof  the  maid's rights as an employee in their household.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  would  like to know  whether  or  not  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  would consider encouraging subsequent employers\r\n\r\nto   refresh  themselves  on  the  obligations  and   the\r\n\r\ntreatment of maids in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the\r\n\r\nmajority of households who employ maids treat their maids\r\n\r\nwell.

It  is  the exact  reason  for  the  maid\r\n\r\naccreditation system because you can come up with a sheet\r\n\r\nand  say  that  is what you do.  But would people  follow\r\n\r\nyou?    Which  is  why  we  have  the  employment  agency\r\n\r\naccreditation scheme so that we can make sure that  there\r\n\r\nis  an intermediary.  We have 140,000 employers.  We have\r\n\r\nthese  maid  agencies which are in closest  contact  with\r\n\r\nthese  employers placing these maids.  How do you  effect\r\n\r\nthe  change that you want?

For the  convenience  of\r\n\r\nbuyers,  HDB  organised roadshows, conducted  bus  tours,\r\n\r\nopened  up showflats and sample units and set up  on-site\r\n\r\nsales offices to facilitate their flat purchase.  So far,\r\n\r\nWIS  exercises  in  five  towns  have  been  launched   - Sengkang,   Choa   Chu  Kang,  Sembawang,   Punggol   and\r\n\r\nWoodlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through these measures, HDB has sold more than 7,000\r\n\r\nflats  in the non-mature estates from January to the  end\r\n\r\nof  July, leaving about 10,000 flats still available  for\r\n\r\nsale.

HDB intentionally built  these  surplus\r\n\r\nunits  so  as  to optimise the land use in these  popular\r\n\r\nestates and is now able to release them to the public  in\r\n\r\nbatches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I had announced in Parliament in May, HDB will\r\n\r\noffer  1,300  new flats for sale in Punggol and  Sengkang\r\n\r\nunder  the Build-To-Order (BTO) System in the 4th quarter\r\n\r\nof this year.  As nearly all the unsold flats in the non-mature  estates are 5-room and Executive Flats,  only  4-room  flats will be offered under this exercise.

This Bill now seeks to amend the  PA  Act  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the  introduction  of  the  new  PA   symbol,\r\n\r\ncommonly  called the PA logo, and to update the  mode  of\r\n\r\noperation of bank accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original PA logo was introduced in 1963. This\r\n\r\nwas  the first logo which was on the paper that the Clerk\r\n\r\nhas  distributed  earlier to all hon.  Members.   It  was\r\n\r\nincorporated  into  the PA Act as  the  Second  Schedule.\r\n\r\nAfter 40 years, it is timely to refresh the logo in order\r\n\r\nto keep up with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe time.

This  represents  the  PA's\r\n\r\nmission  of  connecting  Singaporeans  from  all   ethnic\r\n\r\nbackgrounds  to promote active citizenry and multi-racial\r\n\r\nharmony.

In order to  protect  the\r\n\r\nintegrity of the new logo so that it will not be misused,\r\n\r\nthe penalty for infringement has been increased from $500\r\n\r\nto  $10,000.  This proposed penalty is in line with  that\r\n\r\nof symbols of other Government statutory authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 13(3) of the PA Act governs the operation of\r\n\r\nthe  bank accounts of the People's Association.   Cheques\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  signed  by  two members  of  the  Board  of\r\n\r\nManagement.   This provision was enacted  40  years  ago.\r\n\r\nOver  the  years, the PA has grown in size with increased\r\n\r\nvolumes  of financial transactions.  Like other statutory\r\n\r\nboards, the task of signing cheques and the operation  of\r\n\r\nbank accounts can be delegated to authorised officers  of\r\n\r\nthe People's Association by the Board of Management.

The emphasis was  on\r\n\r\ndownstream technology development, aligned to  the  needs\r\n\r\nof the manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economy has advanced rapidly over the past four\r\n\r\ndecades, bringing fresh challenges and priorities at each\r\n\r\nstage  of  development.    In  the  1990s,  an  important\r\n\r\npriority  was to raise levels of technology  in  industry\r\n\r\nand  move  to  higher value added productive  activities.\r\n\r\nNSTB's  focus  was in supporting industry  upgrading  and\r\n\r\npromoting the development of technopreneurship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move up the economic ladder and into the\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  arena,  Singapore  faces  new  and  more\r\n\r\ncomplex challenges.  Science and technology are advancing\r\n\r\nrelentlessly.   Established centres  of  R&D  are  moving\r\n\r\nahead,  and new players are emerging.  Singapore  has  to\r\n\r\nstep  up  the pace in building a knowledge-based economy,\r\n\r\nor   be  left  behind.

The  Bill also  includes  two  other\r\n\r\namendments,   one  concerning  the  disqualification   of\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament under certain circumstances,  and\r\n\r\nthe  other  to  extend the term of Nominated  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament from two to two-and-a-half years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now explain the main amendments in the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Transfer of Reserves</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends Article 22B of the Constitution to\r\n\r\nenable  a  Fifth  Schedule statutory  board,  whose  past\r\n\r\nreserves are subject to the constitutional safeguards, to\r\n\r\ntransfer  any  of  its  past  reserves  either   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  past reserves or to another Fifth  Schedule\r\n\r\nstatutory  board's past reserves, without the transaction\r\n\r\nbeing  regarded as a draw on past reserves.  As BCCS  and\r\n\r\nMAS  are both Fifth Schedule statutory boards, this  will\r\n\r\nenable  BCCS  to transfer all its past reserves  to  MAS.\r\n\r\nThe  transfer  will not affect the total amount  of  past\r\n\r\nreserves   that   are   subject  to  the   constitutional\r\n\r\nsafeguards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, as BCCS would no longer exist as a separate\r\n\r\nentity  after the merger with MAS, clause 5 proposes  the\r\n\r\ndeletion  of  BCCS  from  the  Fifth  Schedule   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has been consulted on clause 3 and\r\n\r\nclause 5 of the Bill, as these two amendments affect  the\r\n\r\ncustodial  powers  of the President.  The  President  has\r\n\r\nagreed  that  I  should inform the House that  these  two\r\n\r\nclauses have his concurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now describe the amendments pertaining to the\r\n\r\nMembers   of   Parliament  and   Nominated   Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Disqualification of Members of Parliament</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a Member of Parliament is subject to\r\n\r\ndisqualification  under  certain  circumstances.    These\r\n\r\ninclude  becoming  bankrupt, declared to  be  of  unsound\r\n\r\nmind, being convicted of an offence that leads to a  jail\r\n\r\nterm of more than one year or a fine of more than $2,000,\r\n\r\nor  being  convicted  of an offence  in  connection  with\r\n\r\nelections  to Parliament.  When this happens, Article  48\r\n\r\nof  the  Constitution gives Parliament a choice of either\r\n\r\nimmediately  vacating  the MP's  seat,  or  delaying  the\r\n\r\nvacation  of  the seat to allow the MP to appeal  against\r\n\r\nthe Court's ruling.  If Parliament chooses the former, it\r\n\r\nwould  not  be fair to the MP, who ought to  be  given  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  opportunity  to appeal  against  the  Court's\r\n\r\ndecision  to  retain  his seat in  Parliament.   So  far,\r\n\r\nParliament's practice has always been to give the MP  the\r\n\r\nchance  to  appeal.   But  this has  given  rise  to  the\r\n\r\nanomalous  situation of a disqualified MP being  able  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  sitting  and  voting in  Parliament  while  his\r\n\r\nappeal  is pending.  There is no disincentive for the  MP\r\n\r\nnot to drag his feet with the appeal process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 rectifies this, by giving the MP two\r\n\r\nincentives to expeditiously pursue his avenues of appeal.\r\n\r\nThe  first  is  to  disallow him  from  participating  in\r\n\r\nparliamentary  proceedings while his appeal  is  pending.\r\n\r\nThe  second  is to give him a reasonable time to  exhaust\r\n\r\nhis avenues of appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends Article 46 of the Constitution to\r\n\r\nprovide that an MP who becomes disqualified by reason  of\r\n\r\nbankruptcy,  unsound mind or criminal  conviction,  shall\r\n\r\nimmediately  cease  to be entitled  to  sit  or  vote  in\r\n\r\nParliament  until the outcome of any appeal  against  the\r\n\r\nCourt's  decision.   The  MP's seat  will,  at  the  very\r\n\r\nlatest,  be vacated after 180 days even if the appeal  is\r\n\r\nstill  pending.  An MP who succeeds in his appeal  before\r\n\r\nthe  expiry  of the 180 days will be entitled  to  resume\r\n\r\nsitting or voting in Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have set the period at 180 days because in vast\r\n\r\nmajority of cases, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappeal process takes less than six months.  This is  also\r\n\r\nin  line with the UK practice.  In the UK, a bankrupt  MP\r\n\r\nis  immediately  disqualified from participating  in  the\r\n\r\nproceedings  of Parliament, but he is allowed  to  retain\r\n\r\nhis  seat  for six months.  If at the end of six  months,\r\n\r\nhis  appeals to the Court do not result in his bankruptcy\r\n\r\nbeing  annulled or rescinded, he must vacate his seat  in\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Extension of the Term of Nominated MPs</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill amends the Fourth Schedule of\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution  to extend the term of  NMPs  from  two\r\n\r\nyears   to   two-and-a-half  years  from  the   date   of\r\n\r\nappointment.  In April, the House debated the  motion  by\r\n\r\nthe  Leader of the House to have Nominated MPs during the\r\n\r\nterm  of this Parliament.  During this debate, the Leader\r\n\r\ninformed Members that the present two-year term  of  NMPs\r\n\r\nwas  not ideal.  If Parliament lasts the full five years,\r\n\r\nthen  we have to go through the process of selecting NMPs\r\n\r\nthree   times.   Furthermore,  the  third   time,   after\r\n\r\nParliament has gone through the whole process  of  public\r\n\r\nadvertisements, inviting members of the public to send in\r\n\r\nnominations, interviewing them, and so on, the NMP  would\r\n\r\nserve only for at most one year, before General Elections\r\n\r\nhave to be called.  In the last term of Parliament, these\r\n\r\nNMPs,  in  fact,  served only 17 days and attended  three\r\n\r\nsittings  of Parliament.  The Leader stated  that  at  an\r\n\r\nappropriate  time, the Government intended to  propose  a\r\n\r\nchange to this two-year term to stretch it out to two-and-a-half  or  three years, so that within one parliamentary\r\n\r\nterm  of  five years, we only need to select NMPs  twice.\r\n\r\nHence,  this amendment to extend the NMPs' term from  two\r\n\r\nto two-and-a-half years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I rise in support\r\n\r\nof the Constitution (Amendment) Bill.  I should just like\r\n\r\nto  ask the Deputy Prime Minister some questions relating\r\n\r\nto the proposed changes to Article 46 contained in clause\r\n\r\n3 of the Bill.  First, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namendment provides for a situation where an MP  may,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  be  disqualified  due  to  his  being  adjudged\r\n\r\nbankrupt or convicted of an offence for which he is fined\r\n\r\nmore  than $2,000 or jailed for more than a year.  He  is\r\n\r\nthen suspended from parliamentary proceedings even if  he\r\n\r\nappeals.   There is nothing wrong with this,  and  it  is\r\n\r\npractised   in   many  jurisdictions,  notably   England.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would like to ask a question relating  to  the\r\n\r\n180-day limit concerning the appeal, after which a Member\r\n\r\nof  Parliament must vacate his or her seat.  What if  the\r\n\r\nappeal  had not been heard by then?  What if subsequently\r\n\r\nthe  appeal is allowed?  He would have vacated  his  seat\r\n\r\nalready   and   there   would  be  no   opportunity   for\r\n\r\nreinstatement.  Is this really intended?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is still a reference, I find, to\r\n\r\nMalaysian  courts in the proposed Article 46(4)(c)  where\r\n\r\nan MP may be disqualified if convicted of an offence by a\r\n\r\nMalaysian court.  This is a historical issue.   Why  have\r\n\r\nwe  not taken the opportunity to take away this reference\r\n\r\nto Malaysia?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Article 45(2) refers to the removal of\r\n\r\ndisqualification  after, for instance,  an  MP  has  been\r\n\r\nsentenced  and served his custodial sentence, and  he  is\r\n\r\nreleased.  He is no longer disqualified five years  after\r\n\r\nhis  release.   He can stand for re-election.   Sir,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  is,  if an MP has been convicted of  a  serious\r\n\r\noffence  or,  for that matter, successfully sued  in  the\r\n\r\ncivil  court,  for example, for breach of trust  or  such\r\n\r\nconduct which was manifestly dishonest and dishonourable,\r\n\r\nshould he not be disqualified for a longer period or,  in\r\n\r\nsome really serious offences, permanently disqualified?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the amendment may be seen by some in\r\n\r\nthis House as well as outside that this was motivated  by\r\n\r\nthe  treatment of the Non-Constituency MP in the previous\r\n\r\nParliament,  Mr  J  B Jeyaretnam, during  his  bankruptcy\r\n\r\nproceedings  when  he  was  allowed  to  participate   in\r\n\r\nParliament during the appeal.  I am sure that this is not\r\n\r\nso  and  that,  on  the  whole,  the  amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nConstitution are important in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npreserving the honour and integrity of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I give it fullest support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to touch on clause 3 of the proposed amendment which\r\n\r\nconcerns  Members of the House.  A Member  of  the  House\r\n\r\nadjudged   or  otherwise  declared  a  bankrupt  (Article\r\n\r\n46(4)(a)) should have the same opportunities as any other\r\n\r\ncitizens  and be able to pursue avenues of compromise  or\r\n\r\nsettlement  without any additional added pressure.   This\r\n\r\nis  particularly  so  in view of the  high  incidence  of\r\n\r\npoliticians being sued for defamation in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Courts in Singapore are reasonably efficient,\r\n\r\nand  there  are procedures in our legal system to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  matters  are  dealt  with  expeditiously.   In  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  the proposed amendment to  force  a  said\r\n\r\nMember to vacate his seat after 180 days, despite pending\r\n\r\nappeals open to the Member, makes a mockery of the  legal\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, when all attempts to appeal have\r\n\r\nfailed,  and the said Member is so disqualified from  his\r\n\r\nseat, then the said vacant seat should immediately be put\r\n\r\nup  for  contest in a by-election.  This should  be  done\r\n\r\nirregardless of whether the vacant seat is  in  a  single\r\n\r\nconstituency  or  GRC.  After all, the  constituents  are\r\n\r\ncitizens and taxpayers and they should be fairly  treated\r\n\r\nand not stayed on as orphaned electorates, and especially\r\n\r\nnot  with step-MPs from other constituencies assigned  to\r\n\r\nlook  after them.  The choice of the constituents  should\r\n\r\nbe  respected and every opportunity given to elect a  new\r\n\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not support the Bill in\r\n\r\nits current state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no\r\n\r\nobjection  to the amendment relating to the  transfer  of\r\n\r\npast  reserves  between the statutory  boards  concerned.\r\n\r\nConcerning the disqualification of Members of Parliament,\r\n\r\nI  believe the immediate suspension of a Member's rights,\r\n\r\nfollowing the courts disqualifying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Member,  is  in  line with  the  practice  of  other\r\n\r\ncountries.   I  also have no objection to this.   But  my\r\n\r\nconcern,  like  Prof. Chin, is about the 180-day  cut-off\r\n\r\nwhere  a Member is appealing against a conviction or  his\r\n\r\nbankruptcy.  If 180 days have passed without  the  appeal\r\n\r\nbeing decided, the Member will lose his seat.  This  will\r\n\r\nbe   irreversible  even  if  his  appeal  is   eventually\r\n\r\nsuccessful and he is acquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a cut-off point for appeal may be necessary in\r\n\r\ncountries where the court processes take a long time, and\r\n\r\nthere may be a worry that the MP may be out of action for\r\n\r\ntoo  long.   However,  do we have  the  same  problem  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?   According  to  the  Supreme  Court's  Annual\r\n\r\nReport 2001, the average waiting time for appeals against\r\n\r\nbankruptcy is 1.8 weeks whereas the average waiting  time\r\n\r\nfor   appeals  against  a  criminal  conviction  in   the\r\n\r\nSubordinate Courts is about 6.1 weeks.  We also know that\r\n\r\nthe  courts  are nowadays very strict on postponement  of\r\n\r\ncases.   As  what DPM has mentioned, we are efficient  in\r\n\r\nour  court system.  So, if any case is postponed for more\r\n\r\nthan 180 days, there must be a very good reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, in Singapore, it appears that the\r\n\r\nChief  Justice is the only Judge hearing criminal appeals\r\n\r\nfrom  the Subordinate Courts.  I understand that sometime\r\n\r\nin  1998,  the Chief Justice was on medical leave  as  he\r\n\r\nwent abroad for treatment.  This resulted in Magistrates'\r\n\r\nappeals  not  being  heard for several  weeks.   If  this\r\n\r\nhappens  again,  would it be fair to the  Member  if  the\r\n\r\nperiod  of 180 days has expired because the Chief Justice\r\n\r\nis on medical leave?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that the practice in Australia is\r\n\r\nto  wait  for the outcome of the appeal, as it  would  be\r\n\r\njumping  the gun to make the seat vacant if there  is  an\r\n\r\nappeal   pending   conviction.   Furthermore,   such   an\r\n\r\namendment is tantamount to presuming the Member is guilty\r\n\r\nif the appeal to the Court is being delayed for more than\r\n\r\n180 days.  Sir, I am not convinced that this amendment is\r\n\r\nnecessary.   It can also lead to unjust results,  if  the\r\n\r\ndelay is due to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncircumstances beyond the Member's control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I address\r\n\r\nthe   points,   first,  on  amendments  to  Article   46,\r\n\r\nparticularly the 180-day rule which Prof. Chin, Mr  Steve\r\n\r\nChia  and  also  Mr  Low Thia Khiang have  raised.    The\r\n\r\nsituation  which  they have described is  not  likely  to\r\n\r\nhappen because six months should be enough time for an MP\r\n\r\nto  complete  his  appeal.  According to the  statistics,\r\n\r\nmore than 80% of appeal cases are disposed of within  six\r\n\r\nmonths.   If an MP in question expeditiously pursues  his\r\n\r\nappeal, there is no reason why it should not be completed\r\n\r\nwithin that period.  Knowing that the MP has got this six-month deadline, the courts will no doubt accommodate  the\r\n\r\nMP's  schedule and fix an appeal for hearing as early  as\r\n\r\npossible.   It is only when the MP drags out  his  appeal\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  any chance of the process exceeding  six\r\n\r\nmonths,  in which case he only has himself to blame.   We\r\n\r\nhave to set a hard time limit because we have to avoid an\r\n\r\nMP deliberately dragging his case out and then repeatedly\r\n\r\nasking  for  an  extension of time at  the  last  minute,\r\n\r\nprolonging the entire process indefinitely.  However, the\r\n\r\nsix   months   is  not  an  absolute  limit.    If,   for\r\n\r\nextraordinary  reasons, the appeal has not been  resolved\r\n\r\nat  the  end  of 180 days, the MP could raise a  question\r\n\r\nunder Article 48 on whether he has vacated his seat,  and\r\n\r\nit is still possible for Parliament to invoke the proviso\r\n\r\nto  Article 48 to postpone a decision on the vacation  of\r\n\r\nthe MP's seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main point of this amendment is to suspend the\r\n\r\nright  of  an MP to sit and vote while the appeal  is  in\r\n\r\nprogress and to set a structured timeline for the  MP  to\r\n\r\nfollow.  And this is to put him on notice that, should he\r\n\r\nfail  to meet the 180-day grace period, he should  expect\r\n\r\nvery   little  sympathy  from  Parliament,  except  under\r\n\r\nexceptional  circumstances.  In other words, the  proviso\r\n\r\nto  Article 48 will really be invoked for cases where the\r\n\r\n180-day timeline applies.  But if there is merit,  it  is\r\n\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Prof. Chin asked about decisions in Malaysian\r\n\r\ncourts.   Why  do  we  still need this?   Prof.  Chin  is\r\n\r\nactually referring to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 45(1)(e) of the present Constitution which is not\r\n\r\nthe  subject of any direct amendment in the  Bill.   But,\r\n\r\nnevertheless,  the  reason  the  Article  exists  is   as\r\n\r\nfollows.    Given  the  close  ties  and  links   between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Malaysia, it is not realistic  for  us  to\r\n\r\nignore criminal convictions sustained in Malaysia.   Many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  travel  up  to Malaysia  for  business  and\r\n\r\nrecreation  frequently.  Many of our citizens are  either\r\n\r\nformer  Malaysians who have lived or worked for a  period\r\n\r\nin   Malaysia.   And  this  uniquely  close  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween   Singapore  and  Malaysia  is  not  matched   by\r\n\r\nSingapore's ties with any other country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penal laws of Singapore and Malaysia are very\r\n\r\nsimilar.   What is a crime is most likely a crime  there,\r\n\r\nand  this similarity is again unique.  There is a similar\r\n\r\nsituation,  in  fact,  in the United  Kingdom  where  the\r\n\r\nRepresentation   of   the   People   Act   provides   for\r\n\r\ndisqualification for imprisonment in either the UK or the\r\n\r\nRepublic  of Ireland.  So there is reason for  this.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, I should add that the conviction which is outside\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  and  Malaysia  is  not  entirely  without\r\n\r\nconsequence because Parliament can still suspend  the  MP\r\n\r\nfor   dishonourable  conduct  under  section  20  of  the\r\n\r\nParliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point raised by Prof. Chin is why\r\n\r\ndisqualification after a custodial sentence is  only  for\r\n\r\nfive  years.  This is Article 45(2).  Again, this is  not\r\n\r\nsubject  to any amendment in this Bill.  But the  purpose\r\n\r\nof  the  five-year disqualification is not  to  impose  a\r\n\r\nfurther punishment on the MP beyond that period.   It  is\r\n\r\nde-linked  from  the  severity of the offence  committed.\r\n\r\nThe five years starts after the release from prison.

I wish to thank them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>GLCs' divestment history</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first major review of GLCs was completed on\r\n\r\n21st  February 1987 by a committee chaired by Mr  Michael\r\n\r\nFam, called the Public Sector Divestment Committee.  This\r\n\r\nwas  15 years ago.  The committee identified 15 GLCs  for\r\n\r\nlisting,   nine   GLCs   for  reduction   of   Government\r\n\r\nshareholding, and 17 GLCs for total privatisation, making\r\n\r\na  total of 41 GLCs recommended to be divested over a 10-year period.  I regret to note that the actual divestment\r\n\r\nrate of GLCs has been painfully slow.  A quick check will\r\n\r\nreveal that only about two-thirds of the GLCs recommended\r\n\r\nfor  listing  have been done.  In fact, on the  contrary,\r\n\r\nseveral  GLCs  have continued to expand and  became  very\r\n\r\nsizeable companies.  Contrary to shrinking and divesting,\r\n\r\nthe GLCs had gone forth and multiply.  There are now more\r\n\r\nGLCs in terms of size, number and coverage of the economy\r\n\r\nthan  before  1987.   Has Mr Michael  Fam's  Report  been\r\n\r\ntotally forgotten?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, over these years, the cries of the\r\n\r\nprivate sector against GLCs got louder and louder.   Most\r\n\r\nof  the  complaints were reflected by MPs in this  House.\r\n\r\nThis is a perennial topic raised during the annual Budget\r\n\r\ndebate and the Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EISC report and Temasek's new charter for GLCs\r\n\r\nare therefore timely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey  put  in perspective the current stage of  GLCs  and\r\n\r\nwhat  should  be done in setting the policy  forward  for\r\n\r\nGovernment   in   business.   Though  not   comprehensive\r\n\r\ndocuments by themselves, they serve as useful guide-posts\r\n\r\nto  review  and plan ahead.  I shall delve  further  into\r\n\r\nthese reports later in my speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Definition of GLCs</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I go on to set out the\r\n\r\ngripes  of  the  private sector against GLCs,  we  should\r\n\r\nfirst  define  what  we mean by a  GLC.   Generally,  the\r\n\r\npublic loosely considers a company to be a GLC if it  has\r\n\r\nclose  ties  to  the Government, either in  the  form  of\r\n\r\ndirect  or  indirect shareholdings or  having  Government\r\n\r\nrepresentation or control on the Board or management.   A\r\n\r\nmore  precise definition has been commonly used nowadays.\r\n\r\nA GLC is defined as a company with more than 20% owned by\r\n\r\nthe  Government through Temasek Holdings of the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance, or by other Government Ministries, statutory\r\n\r\nboards and agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temasek Holdings now wants to call them TLCs, to\r\n\r\ndifferentiate   TLCs  which  are  Temasek's   stable   of\r\n\r\ncompanies, against Government-linked companies which  are\r\n\r\nowned  by  other  Government agencies.  However,  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat,  to make the picture more complete, when we  should\r\n\r\nrefer  to Government in business, we should also  include\r\n\r\nGLCs  owned by Temasek and other Government agencies.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to include companies under the ambit of  NTUC\r\n\r\nand  the  Singapore Labour Foundation as well.   I  shall\r\n\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me coin a new acronym for NTUC and SLF-linked\r\n\r\ncompanies   to  be  called  NLCs.   A  Minister   without\r\n\r\nPortfolio  is head of the NTUC.  The companies under  the\r\n\r\nSLF  are  another  NLC group headed by another  Minister.\r\n\r\nAlthough  NTUC  and SLF-linked companies are  technically\r\n\r\nnot  under  Government shareholding influence,  they  are\r\n\r\nexerting  the  same nature of Government connections  and\r\n\r\nclout like GLCs.  Therefore, any policy rules\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  decisions  on GLCs which are applicable to  Temasek's\r\n\r\nTLCs,  corporatised Government agencies, and subsidiaries\r\n\r\nof statutory boards, should also be applicable as well in\r\n\r\nform and spirit to the NTUC/SLF-affiliated companies, ie,\r\n\r\nthe NLCs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Concerns regarding GLCs</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what are the concerns regarding GLCs? The\r\n\r\nconcerns  stem from the fundamental issue that GLCs  have\r\n\r\nparentage   that  is  linked  to  the  Government.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment, being a market regulator, is also the player,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  the  Government is both referee  and  player.\r\n\r\nTherein  lies  the fundamental conflict of Government  in\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most countries, in the US especially, the\r\n\r\ngovernment's role is to assist businesses to grow.  It is\r\n\r\na firm belief that a businessman, with his personal money\r\n\r\nat  stake,  will  make  better  business  decisions  than\r\n\r\ngovernment  officials.   The Government's  share  of  the\r\n\r\nfruits  of success is in the corporate taxes levied.   In\r\n\r\nfact, from the private businessmen's point of view, it is\r\n\r\nrather  ironical that the Government collects taxes  from\r\n\r\ntheir profits, which could then be used by the Government\r\n\r\nto invest in businesses which compete against them.  This\r\n\r\nis a dichotomy of Government in business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, the concerns regarding GLCs are three\r\n\r\nmain aspects:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Unlevel playing field;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Crowding out of the private sector; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Transparency and trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Unlevel playing field</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private-sector companies are very concerned about\r\n\r\nthe  unlevel playing field.  Their concerns are that  the\r\n\r\nGLCs   have  strong  connections.   They  have  chairmen,\r\n\r\ndirectors  and CEOs who are former Ministers,  top  civil\r\n\r\nservants, generals and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadmirals.  Besides these clout and connections, GLCs have\r\n\r\nstrong  finances.  Hence, because of their muscles,  they\r\n\r\ncan  edge out any SMEs.  A common mistaken perception  is\r\n\r\nthat  \"all  things being equal, the award of  a  contract\r\n\r\nwill invariably go to a GLC\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recall that when I raised this perception of\r\n\r\nunlevel playing field to Deputy Prime Minister Lee  Hsien\r\n\r\nLoong,  in a debate in this House several years ago,  his\r\n\r\nresponse was that the Government's policy was to lay  out\r\n\r\na  level  playing  field.   He suggested  that  we  could\r\n\r\nmeasure  it with a theodolite.  The Government will  make\r\n\r\nany playing field level for all players.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that there exist rules that\r\n\r\ndeliberately  favour  GLCs.  Nor  are  there  any  hidden\r\n\r\nsubsidies for GLCs.  Since the Government is always above-board,  this is not permitted.  But compared to a private\r\n\r\ncompany,  a  GLC enjoys certain advantages.  Firstly,  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  finance, a GLC is usually stable and  stronger\r\n\r\nfinancially,   with   Government  as   the   shareholder.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  GLCs have connections and old-boys network  of\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service,  which  are  a  distinct  advantage.\r\n\r\nThirdly,  GLCs are favoured just purely because they  are\r\n\r\nGLCs,  being of the right pedigree and parentage.  Others\r\n\r\nwant to do business with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew said so\r\n\r\nhimself in this House on 21st May 1996 during the  debate\r\n\r\non  purchase of properties.  Senior Minister,  as  usual,\r\n\r\ngave  a  long and commanding speech that day,  six  years\r\n\r\nago.  On a matter of perceived unlevel playing field,  he\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"So let us be a little realistic and do not expect\r\n\r\nthat the Government can force private sector to give  the\r\n\r\nprofessionals a level playing field.  No.   It  is  their\r\n\r\nbusiness.   They want to get the best customer that  will\r\n\r\nhelp them to sell the product and add value.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SM went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries, MPs, you go\r\n\r\nto  a  hawker  centre.  If they give other customers  one\r\n\r\negg,  they  will  give you two.\"  He  quipped:   \"I  know\r\n\r\nbecause when in the 1950s, I used to go to Koek Road, the\r\n\r\nbest char kway teow there, other people for 50 cents  got\r\n\r\none egg.  I got two.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was what SM said. SM also went on to cite\r\n\r\nexamples  of his shoemaker and tailor giving him  special\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to be realistic, even if there is a level playing\r\n\r\nfield  in  terms  of  the  open  rules,  certain  better,\r\n\r\nstronger and well-connected customers like GLCs will  get\r\n\r\nfavoured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote my personal experience from the\r\n\r\nreceiving  end  of  it.  In 1995, I  was  involved  in  a\r\n\r\nprivate  sector company that entered into a joint venture\r\n\r\nwith  three GLCs to develop a piece of land in  Shanghai.\r\n\r\nThe  joint  venture partners agreed to  borrow  from  the\r\n\r\nbanks  using  the  land  as collateral  and  each  giving\r\n\r\ncorporate  guarantees  for  their  share  of  the   loan.\r\n\r\nCompared to the GLCs, we were informed by the banks  that\r\n\r\nour private sector company will have to be charged higher\r\n\r\ninterest  rates for our portion of the loan.  The  reason\r\n\r\nis  that though the collateral is the same, the value  of\r\n\r\nour corporate guarantee is not the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Crowding out of Private Sector</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this second gripe concerning the\r\n\r\ncrowding  out  is even more serious.  The  Department  of\r\n\r\nStatistics  (DOS)  did  a study  in  March  2001  on  the\r\n\r\n\"Contribution  of  GLCs  to  GDP\".   It  sets   a   clear\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  GLCs as those wherein the Government  and\r\n\r\nall  its  agencies own directly or indirectly effectively\r\n\r\n20% or more.  DOS concluded that GLCs accounted for 12.9%\r\n\r\nof  the  total  GDP in 1998.  This is a very  interesting\r\n\r\nstudy that is not well-publicised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Leong, can you pause for a while so\r\n\r\nthat the motion for exemption can be moved?

[Table circulated to hon. Members.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this table shows the share of GDP in 1998. Let\r\n\r\nus  take  a look at this table.  What I found significant\r\n\r\nis  that, of the 100% share, the Public Sector, which  is\r\n\r\nGovernment,  in terms of providing schools,  defence  and\r\n\r\nvarious  Government  regulatory  functions  and  services\r\n\r\naccounted  for  8.9%.  Of the remaining 87.5%,  which  is\r\n\r\nunder the Corporate Sector, 41.5% was taken up by foreign-owned   companies,   with   46%   by   locally-controlled\r\n\r\ncompanies.  And of this 46% locally-controlled companies,\r\n\r\n12.9%  were  owned  by GLCs and 33.1% owned  by  \"others\"\r\n\r\nwhich is, I presume, the private sector companies.   What\r\n\r\nis  shown  here  is that the total pie  of  the  locally-controlled companies of 46%, one third was already  owned\r\n\r\nby  GLCs, leaving only two-thirds for the private sector.\r\n\r\nThis percentage is indeed significant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look further into this table, add the 8.9% for\r\n\r\npublic  sector to the 12.9% of GLCs, we get  a  total  of\r\n\r\n21.8%.   Compare  21.8% to the 33.1% which  is  owned  by\r\n\r\nprivate  sector,  the comparison is  about  40:60,  which\r\n\r\nmeans  Government  in  commercial  business  as  well  as\r\n\r\nGovernment in government business accounts for 40% versus\r\n\r\n60% for local companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this is clear evidence that the public\r\n\r\nsector and the GLCs combined have invaded into 40% of our\r\n\r\ndaily  life, compared to the private firms,  if  we  take\r\n\r\naway  the  portion  owned by MNCs and  the  foreign-owned\r\n\r\ncompanies.  No wonder the presence of the Government  and\r\n\r\nGLCs  is  felt so strongly in Singapore.  Many  may  feel\r\n\r\nvery stifling, others may develop a dependency syndrome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is assessed that the GLCs accounted for 12.9% of\r\n\r\nthe  GDP in 1998.  However, now in year 2002, four  years\r\n\r\nlater,  I expect the figure to be higher if we include  a\r\n\r\nfew large Government agencies that have been corporatised\r\n\r\nsuch  as the PSA Corporation and PWD Corporation (renamed\r\n\r\nas  the CPG group, I think).  Then, if we include  a  few\r\n\r\nnew   subsidiaries  of  PSB,  JTC  and  other  Government\r\n\r\nagencies  and statutory boards and several existing  GLCs\r\n\r\nand  NLCs that have expanded, the GLCs' share of the  GDP\r\n\r\nwill  be  larger.   The Temasek Holdings'  press  release\r\n\r\nstated  that  seven listed GLCs account for  21%  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  market capitalisation of the Stock Exchange today.\r\n\r\nThey  have a total value of S$72 billion. This growth  of\r\n\r\nthe  GLCs  could have been at the expense of the  private\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at one-third share of the local business pie,\r\n\r\nthe  GLCs  definitely  are a very visible  and  pervasive\r\n\r\ngroup.  Once I read an annual report of Temasek Holdings.\r\n\r\nWhat  struck  me  most was that it was like  reading  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Survey  of Singapore.  GLCs  were  in  banking,\r\n\r\nshipping,  electronics,  semi-conductors,  transport  and\r\n\r\nlogistics, food, property, hotels, retail, media  and  so\r\n\r\non.   Practically you name it, they are in  it.   I  have\r\n\r\nsaid before in this House that if you throw a stone,  you\r\n\r\nwill very likely hit a GLC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Transparency and Trust</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a lesser extent, the third refrain against GLCs\r\n\r\nis  that  some of them operate under a special  cloak  of\r\n\r\nsecrecy  or  different rules because they are Government-owned  to  serve  special national, defence  or  security\r\n\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the manner whereby the Singapore\r\n\r\nTechnologies  group first started.  They were  formed  to\r\n\r\nundertake   production  and  services  for  defence   and\r\n\r\nordnance requirements of Mindef.  The public's perception\r\n\r\nis   that   these   companies   operated   under   strict\r\n\r\nconfidentiality for defence and security reasons.  In the\r\n\r\nearly  years,  many  were  awarded  Government  contracts\r\n\r\nbecause of their special nature.  Over time, they grew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  grew,  and finally became sizeable businesses.   But\r\n\r\nfor  the  purpose  of  growth and  survival,  these  GLCs\r\n\r\nventured into businesses that could well be undertaken by\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector.  The concern  is  that  some  GLCs,\r\n\r\nespecially  those  which are not listed,  operated  under\r\n\r\nrules  that  may  not  be  too  transparent.  There   are\r\n\r\nperceptions,  misconstrued  perhaps,  that  they  may  be\r\n\r\nfavoured for Government contracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of trust, I recall that when I was a\r\n\r\njunior  Administrative Officer in the Ministry of Finance\r\n\r\nin  the mid-70s, my senior used to tell me that we cannot\r\n\r\ntrust the local businessmen.  Anything they asked for  is\r\n\r\nfor their own benefit.  Therefore, we must say no to them\r\n\r\nthree times.  Only if they come back after the third  no,\r\n\r\nthen they may truly have a grievance and needed help.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, things have changed.  The mistrust now may not be\r\n\r\nas  pronounced.  Nevertheless, it is good that Government\r\n\r\ncan work hand in glove with the private sector to develop\r\n\r\nmore mutual trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, some SMEs fear and mistrust the\r\n\r\nGLCs.   They are afraid that GLCs could steal their ideas\r\n\r\nor  swallow  them  up  if they get  too  close  to  them.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  there is a need to foster closer  and  better\r\n\r\nmutual trust between GLCs and private companies. This may\r\n\r\nbe  achieved by greater transparency.  One method,  if  I\r\n\r\ncould  suggest,  is  for Temasek and  the  Government  to\r\n\r\npublish an annual report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Comparison of Singapore and Hong Kong</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was explained that the genesis of GLCs in the\r\n\r\nearly  years was to spur economic development. GLCs  were\r\n\r\nformed to enter areas which the private sector was unable\r\n\r\nto do because of size, finance, risk or know-how.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For contrast, Hong Kong operated differently from\r\n\r\nSingapore  because of our different history.   In  each's\r\n\r\nown  way,  both Singapore and Hong Kong have found  their\r\n\r\nown  path to economic success in the last 50 years.  They\r\n\r\nhave no major GLCs in Hong Kong (at least not as many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas in Singapore).  Business is managed on a more laissez-faire  manner.  Currently, Singapore has a population  of\r\n\r\n4.1  million, whereas Hong Kong has a population  of  6.8\r\n\r\nmillion, that is, 66% more.  Singapore's GDP in year 2001\r\n\r\nwas  US$92  billion, whereas Hong Kong's GDP  was  US$163\r\n\r\nbillion,  which  is  77%  higher.   Hence,  in   a   very\r\n\r\nsimplistic  contrast between Hong Kong and Singapore,  it\r\n\r\nseems  that  Hong Kong's model without GLCs is marginally\r\n\r\nmore  productive and efficient than Singapore.   However,\r\n\r\nthe  bigger contrast is that Hong Kong has a larger  pool\r\n\r\nof  successful entrepreneurs and business people.  In the\r\n\r\nlist of billionaires in Asia, Hong Kong has a total of 11\r\n\r\nnames  whereas Singapore has only five names.  Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nhas   a   long  list  of  successful  industrialists   in\r\n\r\ndiversified  businesses,  such as  Li  Ka-Shing,  Michael\r\n\r\nKadoorie, Patrick Wang, Peter Woo and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hypothetically, if the Government did not create\r\n\r\nGLCs  in the early years in Singapore, I believe we would\r\n\r\nhave   a   stronger   and  deeper   spread   of   private\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs and businessmen now.  In the early  pioneer\r\n\r\ndays, we had notable successful businessmen like Lee Kong\r\n\r\nChian, Tan Lark Sye, Aw Boon Haw, Loke Wan Tho and  Runme\r\n\r\nShaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I lament to note that there is a paucity of\r\n\r\nsuccessful private sector entrepreneurs who could rise to\r\n\r\nprominence  in  the 70s, 80s and 90s.  I  call  this  the\r\n\r\nvacuum  period. The most notable businessmen  in  current\r\n\r\ndays  are  Lien Ying Chow and Wee Cho Yaw in the  banking\r\n\r\nsector and Kwek Hong Png, Khoo Teck Puat and Ng Teng Fong\r\n\r\nin  the property sector.  There are no industrialists  of\r\n\r\neminence in Singapore.  The only person constantly quoted\r\n\r\nis Sim Wong Hoo of Creative Technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Reason for Dearth of Entrepreneurs</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would attribute the dearth of entrepreneurs during\r\n\r\nthe  last  30 years to two reasons.  One is the  rise  of\r\n\r\nGLCs  in  the  1960s  till to-date.  The  second  is  the\r\n\r\nmonopoly  of  the  public service  over  the  top  brains\r\n\r\narising from the successful\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  scholarship programme.  The  top  brains  are\r\n\r\ngiven  prestigious scholarships.  Upon their return  from\r\n\r\noverseas, they are channelled into public service and the\r\n\r\nSAF.  Many  are  later  released to  run  GLCs.   Without\r\n\r\nscholarships  and  left to their  own  devices,  I  would\r\n\r\ncontend  that  some of our Ministers, top civil  servants\r\n\r\nand  generals could have become successful entrepreneurs,\r\n\r\nbusinessmen and professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can imagine that, if not for taking up scholarship\r\n\r\nand  recruited  into Government, for  example,  from  the\r\n\r\nMinisterial rank, we could have a top IT business leader,\r\n\r\na Singapore equivalent of Bill Gates in the person of DPM\r\n\r\nLee  Hsien  Loong; a successful banker in the  person  of\r\n\r\nRAdm Teo Chee Hean; a successful MNC top executive in  Mr\r\n\r\nWong Kan Seng; and a prominent industrialist in BG George\r\n\r\nYeo  or  Mr  Lim  Hng  Kiang  and  many  others.   If  we\r\n\r\nconjecture  further, perhaps our Prime Minister  himself,\r\n\r\nMr Goh, could have become a top shipping magnate.  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister, Mr Lee himself, no doubt would have been a top-notch lawyer in private practice.  We never know.  And we\r\n\r\ncan  muse about it.  What if all these Ministers had  not\r\n\r\ntaken  up  scholarships  and  not  gone  into  Government\r\n\r\nservice?   Perhaps, we would have more world-class  local\r\n\r\ncompanies led by capable world-class entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>EISC Report</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now move on to make some\r\n\r\nspecific comments on the EISC Report and the new  Temasek\r\n\r\nCharter.   I  am in the fortunate position of  not  being\r\n\r\ninvolved in the preparation of these documents.  I can be\r\n\r\nmore  critical.  Unfortunately,  my  other  parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues, Mr Inderjit Singh and Mrs Lim Hwee  Hua,  who\r\n\r\nare  speaking after me, do not have such liberty, as they\r\n\r\nwould have a hand in the preparation of these reports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the EISC report, I must first say that it\r\n\r\nis  a  very well-prepared and meaningful report.   May  I\r\n\r\ncommend Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRaymond Lim and his Committee for the excellent work.  It\r\n\r\npoints  correctly to the future directions of  Government\r\n\r\nin business and the new roles of GLCs.  Unfortunately,  I\r\n\r\nhave  to  say that the EISC report has not gone  far  and\r\n\r\nbold enough.  The suggestion on urging the Government not\r\n\r\nto  enter into any more new businesses if they appear  in\r\n\r\nthe  Yellow  Book, is well-meaning, but  too  late.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment and the NTUC are already in most businesses in\r\n\r\nthe  Yellow Book. What is there left that they should not\r\n\r\nget into in the future, may I ask?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for its recommendations, I agree with all of\r\n\r\nthem.   In  fact, I think the EISC should ask  for  more.\r\n\r\nFor  a start, I feel that the EISC should have explicitly\r\n\r\nasked for a curb on the proliferation of GLCs.  How about\r\n\r\nthe  issue  of crowding out and urging the Government  to\r\n\r\nmake more room and playing space for private sector?  How\r\n\r\nabout  urging the Government to divest out  of  its  non-strategic companies as soon as possible?  Why not suggest\r\n\r\na timeframe for divestment?  I would prefer that the EISC\r\n\r\nrecommendations be more specific and forceful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>New Temasek Charter for TLCs</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my unhappiness with the new Temasek\r\n\r\nCharter  is that it did not adequately address the  basic\r\n\r\nissue,  which is when and how should Temasek  divest  its\r\n\r\nTLCs.    The  press  release  contained  many  motherhood\r\n\r\nstatements in its preamble on the Temasek Charter and new\r\n\r\nMission.   Instead of a clear divestment plan,  it  looks\r\n\r\nmore like a Business Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though this Temasek Charter is prepared in response\r\n\r\nto  the  EISC  Report, I feel that there  is  not  enough\r\n\r\nconnect   between   the  two  documents.    Whilst   EISC\r\n\r\nrecommends  that Temasek Holdings should explore  various\r\n\r\nways of divestment, the Temasek Charter sets out to be an\r\n\r\nupdated raison d'etre for TLCs, which is to champion  the\r\n\r\nmarch  overseas.  Temasek Holdings has recruited  a  very\r\n\r\ncapable person, Mdm Ho Ching, to be Executive Director to\r\n\r\noversee the group.  Instead of slowly divesting off the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies,  we  now see a new Charter  that  defines  the\r\n\r\nexpanded  role  of  TLCs.  Read from the  private  sector\r\n\r\nperspective,  Mdm Ho Ching is a powerful and  influential\r\n\r\nnew  figure to help mould and transform the stronger  and\r\n\r\nlarger   TLCs  to  become  substantial  players  in   the\r\n\r\ninternational  arena.  Some may have  secretly  harboured\r\n\r\nthe  hope that Mdm Ho Ching would have worked herself out\r\n\r\nof  a job, with the gradual divesting off of GLCs.  Alas,\r\n\r\nshe  is  putting her capable hands and talented  mind  to\r\n\r\ngrow TLCs instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to express my worry over one particular\r\n\r\nstatement in the Temasek Charter.  In its last paragraph,\r\n\r\nit states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Temasek may also, from time to time, invest in new\r\n\r\nbusiness,  in order to nurture new industry  clusters  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany local businessmen are concerned with this statement.\r\n\r\nThis   signals   that   TLCs  may  enter   new   business\r\n\r\nopportunities  in Singapore in competition against  them.\r\n\r\nTheir  old  worries  about  the  unlevel  playing  field,\r\n\r\nformidable financial might, strong network and  influence\r\n\r\nof  top  officers of TLCs will surface again.  Now,  with\r\n\r\nMdm  Ho  leading  the charge, they are afraid  that  they\r\n\r\ncould be eaten for lunch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Private Sector to be the future Engine for Growth</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask any businessman, bliss to him is a business\r\n\r\nworld  in Singapore without GLCs.  If there were no GLCs,\r\n\r\nthey  would have less competition, and more room to build\r\n\r\nup their businesses.  I urge the Government to be serious\r\n\r\non  redefining  the new roles of GLCs and  government  in\r\n\r\nbusiness.  Does the Government need to be involved in  so\r\n\r\nmany  types  and  number  of businesses?   This  question\r\n\r\nshould be asked of NTUC and statutory boards as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even internationally renowned consultants and\r\n\r\nthinkers agree on the need to review the role of GLCs  in\r\n\r\nthe remaking of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking at a seminar in Singapore on 25th July this\r\n\r\nyear, Professor John\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoggett of the University of Texas pointed out that  with\r\n\r\nthe  rapid  economic changes facing the world,  countries\r\n\r\nhave  to  become  more entrepreneurial if  growth  is  to\r\n\r\ncontinue.   He  thought that it is urgent that  Singapore\r\n\r\nstarts  moving  towards  being an entrepreneurial  nation\r\n\r\nnow,  as  other  countries  in  the  region  are  already\r\n\r\npowering ahead.  In addition, he also mentioned:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If Singapore doesn't start producing more\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs soon, it will still be able to live an okay\r\n\r\nlife  for a while, but it will lose a lot of its vibrancy\r\n\r\nand  its economy will be a flat line ..  It will be a big\r\n\r\nchallenge to remake Singapore in three to five years,  or\r\n\r\nit will become irrelevant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has mentioned this point during\r\n\r\nthe previous Sunday's National Day Rally speech.  He said\r\n\r\nthat  we have to nurture a more enterprising environment.\r\n\r\nHe  said,  tongue in cheek, that we should perhaps  allow\r\n\r\n\"bar top dancing\".  Well, I say if \"bar top dancing\"  can\r\n\r\nsqueeze out creative juices from our normally straitlaced\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, I am all for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at a Singapore Institute of Management seminar\r\n\r\non  30th  July  this  year, a renowned  Harvard  Business\r\n\r\nSchool don, Professor Michael Porter, said that thanks to\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  strong  support  and  a  strategy   of\r\n\r\neconomic   development  driven  by  foreign  investments,\r\n\r\nSingapore   has  attained  an  extraordinary   level   of\r\n\r\nprosperity today.  But as the country seeks to remake the\r\n\r\neconomy,  the  challenge is to jump  to  the  innovation-driven advanced economy stage.  The private sector  needs\r\n\r\nto  spread its wings and develop itself to take a leading\r\n\r\nrole  in  the  Singapore economy.   I  repeat,  Professor\r\n\r\nPorter  said, \"The private sector has to take  a  leading\r\n\r\nrole in the Singapore economy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Professor Michael Porter felt that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must now move on to reduce its  role  in  the\r\n\r\neconomy  in the next stage of development and  grow  more\r\n\r\nlocal  world-class companies.  He said, \"We have  to  get\r\n\r\nthe  Government out of the way; it is moving but the pace\r\n\r\nis too slow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common call is for Singapore to foster a\r\n\r\nstronger and larger pool of local\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusinessmen to take on the likes of Li Ka Shing  of  Hong\r\n\r\nKong; and nearer home, compete against the likes of  Quek\r\n\r\nLeng Chan, Ananda Krishnan and Francis Yeoh of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having said the above, I wish to\r\n\r\nbring  this House back to the Motion of this debate.  The\r\n\r\nwordings  are  crafted to reflect  the  concerns  of  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector.  As elaborated earlier, the concerns  are\r\n\r\nwith  regard to unlevel playing field, crowding  out  and\r\n\r\ntransparency.  The Motion goes on to urge the  Government\r\n\r\nto  implement  the  recommendations of  the  EISC,  which\r\n\r\ndefine  the  new roles and positioning of the  Government\r\n\r\nand GLCs in business.  In so doing, it therefore supports\r\n\r\nthe growth of private enterprise and entrepreneurship  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The final operative words in the Motion  are\r\n\r\ntherefore   -  supports the growth of private  enterprise\r\n\r\nand entrepreneurship in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our GPC's dialogue sessions with the Resource\r\n\r\nPanel members and industry representatives, the consensus\r\n\r\nwas  that  it is acknowledged that GLCs have  made  great\r\n\r\ncontributions in the past.  Looking ahead, the Government\r\n\r\nshould critically review the roles of the GLCs.  As shown\r\n\r\nin  the Department of Statistics study, GLCs already  own\r\n\r\none-third  of  the  total  GDP contribution  of  locally-controlled companies in 1998.  Surely this cannot go  on.\r\n\r\nThere  must  be a point in time when the Government  must\r\n\r\nstop  encroaching into the private sector.   GLCs  should\r\n\r\nscale down and give more room for private enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I can concede that some GLCs are here to\r\n\r\nstay.  They have become an integral part of the Singapore\r\n\r\nbusiness  landscape.  The question now is how  to  define\r\n\r\ntheir future roles, so that they can continue to play  an\r\n\r\neffective part in Singapore's  prosperity.  Since certain\r\n\r\nGLCs  are  of such a large size and scale, they obviously\r\n\r\ncan  play  pivotal  roles in venturing overseas  together\r\n\r\nwith  other Singapore companies.  This is the new Temasek\r\n\r\nCharter.  But as for lesser GLCs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  businesses which can be undertaken  by  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector, I strongly urge the Government to  divest\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I move on to 10 recommendations\r\n\r\nthat I have on how to shape the future roles of GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>1.   To curb the proliferation of GLCs</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the Government should make a bold and\r\n\r\noutright  decision that henceforth, no new GLC should  be\r\n\r\nformed  unless  it is for strategic or security  reasons.\r\n\r\nNo  new GLC should be formed without the explicit consent\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministry of Finance.  And the Government  should\r\n\r\nnot   venture  into  commercial  businesses  where  local\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  can undertake.  This applies  even  if  such\r\n\r\nbusiness ventures are not yet available in Singapore.  To\r\n\r\nspur  the  establishment  of  such  new  businesses,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  through an existing GLC,  can  only  take  a\r\n\r\nminority  role and a minority stake.  There should  be  a\r\n\r\nstated  objective that once the new project is  on-track,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will sell its minority  share  to  other\r\n\r\ninterested buyers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As suggested earlier, the Ministry of Finance and\r\n\r\nTemasek  Holdings should publish Annual Reports  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of more transparency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>2.   Government   to  set  a  specific  timeframe   for divestment</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the companies that Temasek Holdings has deemed\r\n\r\nto  be  non-strategic, I urge the  Government  to  set  a\r\n\r\ndefinitive  timeframe  for divestment.   This  divestment\r\n\r\nplan should be reviewed yearly and reported by Temasek to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Finance.  In addition, during the yearly\r\n\r\nreview,  Temasek should also review those GLCs which  are\r\n\r\nclassified  as  strategic.  Times may have  changed  such\r\n\r\nthat these strategic companies may no longer be necessary\r\n\r\nto be held by the Government.  As internal reviews by its\r\n\r\nstaff  may  be  inward looking and biased  towards  self-preservation, an external consultant or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreview  group  could  be  appointed  to  study  and  make\r\n\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>3.   Government to outsource any commercial requirements</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforth, the Government should set a clear policy\r\n\r\nthat  it  would outsource any work or projects  that  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector can undertake.  There has been a tendency\r\n\r\nin  the  past  for  Ministries, Government  agencies  and\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards to form subsidiaries to undertake  work\r\n\r\nwhich  could  be easily performed by the private  sector.\r\n\r\nThis  is  introducing competition and obviously  crowding\r\n\r\nout  of  the limited business space.  If we look  around,\r\n\r\nthere  are  many examples.  I wish to quote one  example,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 39 years, the Singapore Confederation of\r\n\r\nIndustries (SCI) used to be the most prominent  publisher\r\n\r\nof   trade  directories.   Tradelink  is  their  flagship\r\n\r\npublication.  About 10 years ago, IE Singapore  (formerly\r\n\r\nTDB)  put  out  a  competing product to Tradelink  called\r\n\r\nSingapore Exporter.   Because of IE Singapore's reach and\r\n\r\ncapability,  the  Singapore Exporter  has  grown  faster.\r\n\r\nToday, IE Singapore's publication unit has expanded to 50\r\n\r\nstaff  issuing 12 publications.  This is not to say  that\r\n\r\nIE  Singapore has done anything wrong.  In fact,  it  has\r\n\r\nprovided  excellent services. The point is that SCI  felt\r\n\r\nthat IE Singapore could have cooperated with SCI, instead\r\n\r\nof competing against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>4.   Review  of  subsidiaries under the statutory  boards and Government agencies</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the TLCs under Temasek, I note that there\r\n\r\nare  several  statutory  boards and  Government  agencies\r\n\r\nwhich  have formed many subsidiaries and joint  ventures.\r\n\r\nSimilar  to  the  review by Temasek, I suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance do a comprehensive review of all such\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  joint  ventures with  a  view  to  assess\r\n\r\nwhether  these  GLCs should continue.  All  non-strategic\r\n\r\ncompanies    should   be   earmarked   for    divestment.\r\n\r\nThereafter, any new formation of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies  and joint ventures by statutory boards  should\r\n\r\nseek  the consent of the Ministry of Finance.  I strongly\r\n\r\nurge that there should be a curb on the proliferation  of\r\n\r\nGLC  formation,  not  just  by  Ministries,  but  by  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards, Government agencies and existing  GLCs\r\n\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>5.   NTUC/SLF to Review its Stable of Companies</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although NTUC-linked companies\r\n\r\n(NLCs)  are technically not defined as GLCs,  as  I  said\r\n\r\nearlier,  the public views NTUC-linked companies  in  the\r\n\r\nsame  vein  as  GLCs.  I would urge that a review  should\r\n\r\nalso be done on the need to continue to divest NLCs;  and\r\n\r\nthe   same   rule  to  avoid  proliferation   should   be\r\n\r\napplicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can appreciate that the NLCs are formed with\r\n\r\ndifferent objectives from GLCs.  NLCs are formed with the\r\n\r\nsocial  objectives to help union members,  to  help  curb\r\n\r\nprofiteering   and  keep  prices  low,  or   to   provide\r\n\r\nrecreational outlets for workers at low cost.  These  are\r\n\r\nvery  noble and laudable aims.  I would suggest that  for\r\n\r\nNLCs  that  have  achieved a strong  market  presence  to\r\n\r\nperform these social objectives effectively, such as  the\r\n\r\nNTUC Fairprice, NTUC Income and the Pasir Ris Resort,  it\r\n\r\nis worthwhile to retain such NLCs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are some NLCs that are smaller and\r\n\r\nhave limited market impact to curb prices or lower costs.\r\n\r\nI  would urge the NTUC and SLF to do a critical review on\r\n\r\nwhether to keep them.  Some examples I can quote are  the\r\n\r\nNTUC Denticare and NTUC Foodfare.  I must confess that  I\r\n\r\ndo  not know enough about these smaller NLCs, but I would\r\n\r\nsuggest that nevertheless a comprehensive review of  NLCs\r\n\r\nshould be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To service its union members, the NTUC can consider\r\n\r\nout-sourcing  their  needs.   The  NTUC  could  use   its\r\n\r\nenormous  experience  in collective  bargaining  and  the\r\n\r\npooling  of  its  demand from the huge  number  of  union\r\n\r\nmembers to negotiate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  lower prices from private sector operators.  If  the\r\n\r\nNTUC  takes  the route of creating NLCs,  then  they  are\r\n\r\ncompeting  instead of offering business  to  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>6.   Give Priority to enacting a Competition Law</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly support the recommendation of the\r\n\r\nEISC to enact a Competition Law.   This law will help  to\r\n\r\nset   the   ground  rules  on  competition  between   all\r\n\r\ncompanies,  ie,  the GLCs, TLCs, NLCs, MNCs  and  private\r\n\r\ncompanies.   It  will ensure that the  playing  field  is\r\n\r\nexpressly  level.   It  will also  have  the  benefit  of\r\n\r\nensuring  transparency  of operations  of  all  companies\r\n\r\noperating in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>7.   GLCs  to  enlist  more Private Sector  persons  into Boards and Management</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose to the Government to appoint\r\n\r\nmore  private  sector representatives on the  Boards  and\r\n\r\nCommittees of GLCs.  As for the appointment of  CEOs  and\r\n\r\ntop  management, Temasek should get the best  person  for\r\n\r\nthe  job,  whether from the public service  or  from  the\r\n\r\nmarket.   From the public's point of view, we often  have\r\n\r\nthe impression that GLCs are the retirement resting place\r\n\r\nfor ex-Ministers, top civil servants and MINDEF generals.\r\n\r\nI  know this is not the intention.  I recall that DPM Lee\r\n\r\nhas said so in this House.  But it does not help to clear\r\n\r\nthis misconception each time we read about another ex-top\r\n\r\ncivil servant or retired general being appointed to  head\r\n\r\na GLC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More private sector representation means that there\r\n\r\nwill be closer mutual understanding and trust between the\r\n\r\npublic  sector  and the private sector.   Fostering  this\r\n\r\nmutual trust is important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>8.   Encourage more MBOs and divestments to locals</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very heartened to read about the progress of Mr\r\n\r\nAng Kong Hua in leading\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan MBO to buy out NatSteel Limited from the shareholders.\r\n\r\nThis  is an excellent example of divestment of a  GLC  to\r\n\r\ngood,  safe  and capable local hands.  I would  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  encourage  more  of  such  MBOs.    Where\r\n\r\nappropriate,  local  Management Buy-Ins  should  also  be\r\n\r\nconsidered.   This  is  the  reverse  of  MBOs  where  an\r\n\r\nexternal  management group is allowed to buy in  to  take\r\n\r\nover a GLC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, since one of the objectives of the GLCs\r\n\r\ndivestment  is to create and jumpstart a larger  pool  of\r\n\r\nlocal  entrepreneurs,  I  would recommend  that  wherever\r\n\r\npossible,  divestment should be into  the  ownership  and\r\n\r\nhands  of  local managers or local companies.  We  should\r\n\r\navoid  divestment of GLCs into the hands of foreign  fund\r\n\r\nmanagers  or foreign companies, since they have different\r\n\r\nbusiness objectives compared to the locals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>9.   More GLCs and Private Sector Co-operation as Cluster or Consortium</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my ninth recommendation is to ask the GLCs and\r\n\r\nlocal companies to form clusters or consortia to bid  for\r\n\r\ncontracts and projects overseas.  They can also co-invest\r\n\r\nas well.  This is a very common practice in Taiwan, Japan\r\n\r\nand Korea.  When a large Taiwanese company enters into  a\r\n\r\nbusiness  overseas,  such as into China,  it  will  bring\r\n\r\nalong  a  cluster  of supporting Taiwanese  companies  to\r\n\r\ncover various aspects of the investment.  This way,  they\r\n\r\noperate  as a very closely-knit business group.  Japanese\r\n\r\nand Korean companies do the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the new Temasek Charter has earmarked certain\r\n\r\nstrategic  GLCs  that can spearhead Singapore's  external\r\n\r\nexpansion drive, I suggest that each of these GLCs form a\r\n\r\ncluster of local companies that it can cooperate with  to\r\n\r\ncompete  for foreign contracts.  When a large GLC invests\r\n\r\noverseas,  they can offer co-investment, partnerships  or\r\n\r\nsupporting  business  to the members  in  their  cluster.\r\n\r\nSuch  clusters  of companies can be formed  around  large\r\n\r\nGLCs such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas    SingTel,   SembCorp,   Keppel   Corporation,    PSA\r\n\r\nCorporation, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>10.   Regular Study by Department of Statistics on  GLCs' share of GDP</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my final recommendation is that since the study\r\n\r\nby  the  DOS  was done on GLCs' share of GDP in  1998,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  propose that the DOS  be  tasked  to  do\r\n\r\nregular  study to update its report.  It is important  to\r\n\r\ncontinuously  monitor  the  encroachment  of  GLCs   into\r\n\r\nprivate enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have made a long speech and covered much\r\n\r\nground.   At last, I have released off my chest  a  whole\r\n\r\nhost  of issues and concerns I have regarding GLCs,  TLCs\r\n\r\nand NLCs.  These concerns I have expressed are to reflect\r\n\r\nthe concerns of the local businessmen and the man-in-the-street.  Members of this House will have more to  say  on\r\n\r\nthis subject as I note that there are over 20 MPs wishing\r\n\r\nto speak on the Motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I conclude by expressing the\r\n\r\nhope  that the Government leaders will heed our  worries.\r\n\r\nI  have spoken honestly and forthrightly of the fears  of\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector.  I have also spoken sincerely  with\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of the nation at heart.  I hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  leaders will listen, take stock  of  what  we\r\n\r\nhave said, and give us satisfactory replies on the future\r\n\r\nroles  of GLCs and Government in business.  What we  want\r\n\r\nis  to  do  what is best for our national interests.   We\r\n\r\nwant to create world-class local companies led by capable\r\n\r\nworld-class business leaders, who can compete against the\r\n\r\nbest in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, unfortunately,\r\n\r\nI  too  have a long speech because I have got many issues\r\n\r\nto  get off my chest, having spent a lot of time studying\r\n\r\nthis  issue as part of the Committee that Mr Raymond  Lim\r\n\r\nheads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to share with Members the\r\n\r\nreason why I decided to move this Motion together with Mr\r\n\r\nLeong Horn Kee.  As I mentioned, since last year,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  have  been  involved in one of the ERC  Sub-committees\r\n\r\nand,  specifically, I was asked to chair a  sub-group  to\r\n\r\nstudy recommendations regarding the role of Government in\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My committee, comprising key people from the private\r\n\r\nsector,  GLC captains, SME businessmen and entrepreneurs,\r\n\r\nspent considerable time studying the many complaints  and\r\n\r\nissues  related  to  the  Government's  direct  role   in\r\n\r\nbusiness and how GLCs have influenced the development  of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore economy.  We concluded that while the route\r\n\r\nSingapore  took  for  its economic  development  depended\r\n\r\nheavily on the Government's direct role in business,  the\r\n\r\nresults  were  not necessarily all that bad.   While  the\r\n\r\nbrute  force approach taken by the Government  did  yield\r\n\r\nthe  desired  results, the question is, did the  approach\r\n\r\ntaken  result  in  structural damages in  the  spirit  of\r\n\r\nprivate  enterprise and entrepreneurship?  The answer  we\r\n\r\nall  felt in our committee was, to a certain extent, this\r\n\r\ndamage was created.  The next important question we asked\r\n\r\nwas whether the same formula would work in the future and\r\n\r\nthis round, the answer from all the committee members was\r\n\r\na  unanimous `no'.  We felt that if we wanted  to  ensure\r\n\r\ngood growth and economic development, we needed to change\r\n\r\nand  the Government needed to reposition itself and there\r\n\r\nneeds  to be a different strategy from what we have  been\r\n\r\nused  to in the past, particularly by the Government  and\r\n\r\nalso  how the GLCs operate.  We then defined the new role\r\n\r\nand  strategy  and about 12 or so key recommendations  to\r\n\r\nachieve success in this New Economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>New Charter of Government-linked Companies</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come back to why I moved this Motion. Having\r\n\r\nreleased  our  report, we waited for  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nrespond.  The greatly anticipated Temasek Charter was one\r\n\r\nkey response we wanted to see and it came promptly.  What\r\n\r\nI would like to see is a more comprehensive response from\r\n\r\nthe  Government to all our recommendations and  therefore\r\n\r\nthe purpose of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis Motion.  Because, if the Government does not give us\r\n\r\nconvincing response to the serious recommendations put up\r\n\r\nby  serious  and concerned people of all backgrounds  and\r\n\r\nwhich took us many months to develop, then I feel that we\r\n\r\nwill  lose  our battle in ensuring the future growth  and\r\n\r\nprosperity of Singapore, and the Government will lose its\r\n\r\ncredibility   in  trying  to  remake  the   economy   for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why I moved this Motion is because\r\n\r\nI  feel  that the Temasek Charter, while addressing  many\r\n\r\nkey  recommendations of our committee, did however  leave\r\n\r\nout  a  few  very important issues which have yet  to  be\r\n\r\naddressed  satisfactorily by anyone.  Also,  the  Temasek\r\n\r\nCharter lacked in specifics, so no one knows whether  the\r\n\r\nchanges will come fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Were GLCs Really Necessary for Singapore?</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first question we asked is: were GLCs\r\n\r\nreally  necessary for Singapore?  I have said  it  before\r\n\r\nand  will  say it again that GLCs did have a  significant\r\n\r\nand  positive  impact on Singapore's  economy.   But  the\r\n\r\nquestion  is,  was it the only formula for  success?   Mr\r\n\r\nLeong  touched on this too.  My contention is that it  is\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily  so.  When I heard  the  key  people  in\r\n\r\nTemasek  and  some  Government leaders say  that  without\r\n\r\nGLCs,  there would be no major industries coming  out  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, I cannot help but to disagree.  Perhaps,  yes,\r\n\r\nbut it is also arguable that had Government been a little\r\n\r\nmore  patient,  many more private sector companies  could\r\n\r\nhave  moved  in  and  become champions  of  some  of  our\r\n\r\nindustries.   It  is  also possible that  the  Government\r\n\r\nmoved in too early.  Is it also not possible that had the\r\n\r\nGovernment  given the same opportunities and  almost  the\r\n\r\nsame protectionist measures to private local companies as\r\n\r\nit  gave to the GLCs, many private sector companies could\r\n\r\nhave  survived, succeeded and even made it  big?   Is  it\r\n\r\nalso not possible that if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government had played a developmental role,  instead\r\n\r\nof a direct role in business, they could have helped many\r\n\r\nmore local companies develop into global champions?   Why\r\n\r\ndid the Government have to favour only GLCs?  Why did  it\r\n\r\nnot also favour private companies in the same way?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore disagree to a certain extent with the\r\n\r\nargument that had the Government not moved in as a result\r\n\r\nof  market  failure, private sector companies  would  not\r\n\r\nhave  moved in.  And Mr Leong gave very good examples  of\r\n\r\nHong  Kong versus Singapore to suggest that this view  is\r\n\r\nnot  totally wrong.  However, all this is history and  is\r\n\r\nan argument not worth pursuing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now having developed an economy so crowded with GLCs\r\n\r\ntoday, do we still need a domestic economy fuelled by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  through its companies?  I  am  sure  everyone\r\n\r\nwill  agree  with me that we can no longer  live  with  a\r\n\r\nformula  which  depends on GLCs playing  in  a  protected\r\n\r\ndomestic  environment and not allowing private enterprise\r\n\r\nto  bloom  and  having local companies, particularly  the\r\n\r\nGLCs,   which  cannot  effectively  compete  with  global\r\n\r\ncompanies outside our shores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue seems to be that we are being misled by\r\n\r\nour  seemingly successful model in the past, and  by  the\r\n\r\ncomfort  of  our domestic market and the fact  that  many\r\n\r\nGLCs have basically overstayed to the point that they are\r\n\r\nno  longer  capable in competing with foreign  companies,\r\n\r\neither on our shores as our domestic market opens  up  or\r\n\r\nin  foreign lands where true market forces rule and where\r\n\r\nthe  domestic protection no longer exists.  Our GLCs  are\r\n\r\nlate  in  going global and they are facing the  brunt  of\r\n\r\nfailing  to  compete successfully globally and  by  being\r\n\r\n`taken  for  a ride' in certain high profile  acquisition\r\n\r\ntransactions, in my opinion.  If the Government fails  to\r\n\r\nrealise  the  negative impact of our GLCs overstaying  in\r\n\r\ntheir  old roles, we will see many more such sad  stories\r\n\r\nof   Singapore-based   companies  doing   badly   outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Michael Porter from Harvard Business\r\n\r\nSchool was in Singapore, and Mr Leong talked a bit  about\r\n\r\nit  and  I will not go through it.  I would just like  to\r\n\r\nadd  that  he  also  mentioned, and  I  quote  him,  \"The\r\n\r\nhistorical  strategy  has played itself  out  and  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger robust\", in addition to saying that the Government\r\n\r\nshould  get  out  of  the way.  His point  was  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore economy now has to be management driven  rather\r\n\r\nthan state driven, as has been the case for Singapore for\r\n\r\na very long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This very well sums up the feeling of most people\r\n\r\nfrom  the  private  sector  and  is  the  basis  of  many\r\n\r\nrecommendations that my committee developed.  We are  not\r\n\r\nsaying  that  the  Government should suddenly  back  off.\r\n\r\nNeither  are  we  saying  that they  should  get  out  of\r\n\r\neverything  that  they  have been  doing.   What  we  are\r\n\r\nsaying, however, is that the Government needs to re-think\r\n\r\nand  re-position itself with a brand new mindset so  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  can transform itself from a mainly  `corporate\r\n\r\ndriven  economy'  to  one  of  an  `entrepreneurial   and\r\n\r\ninnovation  led economy'.  If the Government succeeds  in\r\n\r\ndoing  this,  we  will  have  a  great  future.   If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  fails to realise the need  and  fails  to  do\r\n\r\nsomething about this need to change, we will surely  fail\r\n\r\nand  collapse as did many economies and companies in  all\r\n\r\nof history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>What are the issues with GLCs?</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does Professor Michael Porter feel that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  reduce its involvement  in  business?\r\n\r\nWhy  are  so  many  people from the private  sector  very\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  the  out-of-proportion  role   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and Government-linked companies in Singapore?\r\n\r\nAnd  what  are the reasons for the failure of state-owned\r\n\r\nenterprises in other parts of the world?  I would like to\r\n\r\ntouch  on  some of the issues which arise as a result  of\r\n\r\nthe Government's involvement in business and which led us\r\n\r\nto  the  current  state  of  affairs  of  having  so  few\r\n\r\nsuccessful  private companies.  These  issues  will  give\r\n\r\nMembers  a good feel of the type of discussions  that  my\r\n\r\ncommittee had when we looked at this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(a)   Early Stages of GLCs Development</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one is how GLCs developed in the early\r\n\r\nstages.   While I agree that many of our GLCs  which  are\r\n\r\npublicly  listed  are doing well and operate  very  well,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in the domestic economy, and one  of  them,\r\n\r\nSingapore  Airlines,  has also done  well  globally,  the\r\n\r\nissue was really in the early stages of the establishment\r\n\r\nand  growth  of  GLCs.   The general  view  is  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment made very heavy investments and allowed  these\r\n\r\ncompanies an easy access of money at less than acceptable\r\n\r\ncommercial  terms.   Such investments by  the  Government\r\n\r\ngave  the  GLCs  so  much of strength  that  the  private\r\n\r\ncompanies  could  not even think of  competing  with  the\r\n\r\nGLCs.   By sheer brute force, we created large companies,\r\n\r\nfurther  over-shadowing any local private company  trying\r\n\r\nto  compete with the GLCs.  So the issue is that we  have\r\n\r\ndeveloped many of our GLCs using a lot of muscles  rather\r\n\r\nthan brain power or entrepreneurial thinking.  After many\r\n\r\nyears of such a funding practice and facilitation by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  we created giant companies  -  again,  as  I\r\n\r\nmentioned  -  with  a  lot  of muscles  but  without  the\r\n\r\nnecessary entrepreneurial management necessary to  create\r\n\r\nworld-class companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have personally made assessments of a few\r\n\r\ncompanies that I know of and came up the way I described.\r\n\r\nI  noted  that  when they have to compete and  when  they\r\n\r\nstart  competing where real market forces rule,  and  the\r\n\r\ncompanies that have been developing entrepreneurial  type\r\n\r\nof  path, they perform much worse than their competitors.\r\n\r\nWhy  is  this  so?   Well, it is because  of  their  well\r\n\r\ncushioned start-up and growth, and they never had to face\r\n\r\nthe  realities  of life and they never learned  to  fight\r\n\r\nwhere a level playing field existed.  In many cases, GLCs\r\n\r\nused  the  excuse  of doing \"national  service\"  for  the\r\n\r\neasier  than  commercial practices they took  in  running\r\n\r\ntheir  businesses.   Had the Government  used  commercial\r\n\r\nprinciples for such companies, this would not  have  been\r\n\r\nan  issue today.  But having been listed, I believe, they\r\n\r\ncame  on  to market practices.  But the issue was  before\r\n\r\nthese companies were listed, how did they come about?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue is one of incestuous\r\n\r\nrelationship  among GLCs and Government agencies  and  an\r\n\r\nunlevel playing field, which Mr Leong talked about.   One\r\n\r\nof  the problems which develops when the Government  also\r\n\r\ngets  into  business, especially when the regulator  also\r\n\r\ncompetes  with  companies  it regulates,  is  the  unfair\r\n\r\nadvantage   the   regulator's  related   companies   get.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  the  Government agencies seem  to  give  many\r\n\r\ncontracts to GLCs and some examples include the Singapore\r\n\r\nFood  Industries  supplying  food  to  MINDEF,  Singapore\r\n\r\nTechnologies supplying equipment to MINDEF too  and  most\r\n\r\nof  the  Government agencies getting its computer and  IT\r\n\r\nservices  from  GLCs.   The issue, whether  perceived  or\r\n\r\ntrue, is a big issue when viewed by everyone outside  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  its agencies.  The way tender  documents\r\n\r\nare written could also be a reason why such contracts get\r\n\r\nissued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue related to the unlevel playing field\r\n\r\nis  how banks rate subsidiaries of GLCs when deciding  on\r\n\r\nfinancing  them, and Mr Leong talked about  his  personal\r\n\r\nexample  in the joint venture.  While it is not a  direct\r\n\r\nproblem  created  by the Government, it  does  exist  and\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  companies which may have better  balance\r\n\r\nsheets  than the GLC subsidiaries may not be able to  get\r\n\r\nthe   financing  while  the  GLC  subsidiaries  get  such\r\n\r\nfinancing easily.  The only suggestion I can make here is\r\n\r\nthat Temasek and the Government must come out and make  a\r\n\r\nvery  clear  statement  that none of  its  companies  and\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries  will be rescued by them should  they  fail,\r\n\r\nand  that  banks must credit rate all the  companies  and\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries on their own merit and not on the backing of\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this issue needs to be resolved by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  it  is about time that  we  got  a  good\r\n\r\nexplanation as to why many such relationships exist today\r\n\r\nand find a way to inject fairer practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Statutory Boards Owning Companies</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third issue is one of statutory boards\r\n\r\nowning companies, and this has been building up over  the\r\n\r\nyears.   There are many examples of such companies  under\r\n\r\nstatutory   boards,  like  JTC,  IE   Singapore,   Spring\r\n\r\nSingapore, HDB, and a few more.  And then there are  also\r\n\r\nall  the  NTUC  owned companies, which  Mr  Leong  talked\r\n\r\nabout.   The issue is how is the accountability  of  such\r\n\r\ncompanies  handled.  No one gets a look at the practices,\r\n\r\ncorporate  governance  issues and  performances  of  such\r\n\r\ncompanies,  except  for the parent  Government  agencies.\r\n\r\nWhile  we  can accept that Temasek is trying to  practise\r\n\r\nhigh standards of corporate governance and will insist on\r\n\r\nhigh  standards  for  all  its  companies,  how  can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  assure  us  that there  is  also  a  standard\r\n\r\npractice  for  all the companies owned by  its  agencies?\r\n\r\nFor  example,  Temasek  is now very  closely  watched  by\r\n\r\neveryone, inside and outside the Government, and  Temasek\r\n\r\nhas  also  revealed its latest Charter and, in doing  so,\r\n\r\nhas promised a certain standard of performance.  But what\r\n\r\nabout  all the other companies not reporting to  Temasek?\r\n\r\nNone  of  the  statutory  boards  has  issued  a  similar\r\n\r\ncharter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should be very concerned about this\r\n\r\nand get serious about either closing such companies under\r\n\r\nstatutory boards, or to immediately transfer all existing\r\n\r\ncompanies to Temasek, so that Temasek can inject a higher\r\n\r\nstandard  of  corporate governance into  such  companies.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  all such companies are flying, what  I  call,\r\n\r\nbelow  the  \"radar detectors\" and there  is  very  little\r\n\r\nvisibility and a lack of transparency and this is  not  a\r\n\r\nhealthy thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should go one step further to\r\n\r\ndisallow  any statutory board from forming companies  and\r\n\r\nif it becomes totally unavoidable but to set up a company\r\n\r\nunder  the statutory board, it should include a timetable\r\n\r\nfor  an  exit, or a timetable for moving the  company  to\r\n\r\nTemasek for ongoing management at the point of time  they\r\n\r\ndecide  to set up the company.  This approach will inject\r\n\r\nsome  discipline into statutory boards when they  try  to\r\n\r\nset up their companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>People Running GLCs and Organisational Culture in GLCs</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third issue is one of people running GLCs\r\n\r\nand  the  organisational culture in  GLCs.   This  issue,\r\n\r\nwhile  a  sensitive one, needs to be discussed.  I  asked\r\n\r\nthe  question  of  whether  we  have  an  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nmanagement  and a culture of innovation and  risk  taking\r\n\r\namong  the  people in the boards and management  of  GLCs\r\n\r\nearlier.   The answer probably is that we have  some  who\r\n\r\nhave  the entrepreneurial approach and take the necessary\r\n\r\nrisks  as  entrepreneurs would and these are  people  who\r\n\r\nhave  managed to change and make the switch from a  civil\r\n\r\nservice mentality to one of a private sector manager.  It\r\n\r\nis  difficult to believe that a majority of those running\r\n\r\nGLCs  have  the  necessary  mindset  and  skills  to  run\r\n\r\ncompanies,  like private sector players,  simply  because\r\n\r\nfor  them,  the GLC role is just another job posting  for\r\n\r\ntheir career.  Many have been handed the jobs on a silver\r\n\r\nplatter  and with all the necessary muscles to help  them\r\n\r\nmanage the business.  There is very little incentive  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  make tough decisions and to take the  necessary\r\n\r\nrisks  as entrepreneurs would.  Why should they risk  it,\r\n\r\nwhen their career path is being ultimately planned by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  its agencies?  I feel that  it  is  this\r\n\r\nculture and the lack of the entrepreneurial management  I\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier which caused PSA to lose its   business\r\n\r\nto  a much more entrepreneurial Tanjung Pelepas and which\r\n\r\ncaused  SingTel some years ago to lose its deal on  Cable\r\n\r\nand  Wireless to Pacific Century of Hong Kong.  Both took\r\n\r\ntoo  long to react to the changing markets because of the\r\n\r\nstrong mindset of a state driven culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that, along with the goal of making GLCs look\r\n\r\nmore  like  private companies, Temasek and the Government\r\n\r\nshould  also  make the changes in the way management  and\r\n\r\nboard  members are selected for GLCs, and Mr Leong talked\r\n\r\nabout this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last few months, we are starting to see\r\n\r\nmany changes at the board and the top management level of\r\n\r\nGLCs as a result of the board level changes in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTemasek.  I welcome this move, but would like to question\r\n\r\nTemasek  why it took them so long to do this.  Obviously,\r\n\r\nwe  have  lived with the problems for so many  years  and\r\n\r\nalong with it, perhaps left the management weaknesses and\r\n\r\ninefficiency in place for too long.  Can we afford to let\r\n\r\nTemasek  do  such housekeeping only once in 10-20  years?\r\n\r\nSurely, the answer is no, as Temasek should constantly be\r\n\r\nreviewing these things.  It is critical that Temasek  has\r\n\r\na  proper process in place to ensure it selects the right\r\n\r\npeople  to  run  its companies and has a good  system  to\r\n\r\naudit and review leadership in its companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Crowding Out Effect</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fifth issue is one of the crowding out\r\n\r\neffect that Mr Leong also talked about.  The issue of the\r\n\r\nGLCs   crowding  out  the  private  sector  and  stifling\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship   and  the  private   enterprise   among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  is  a  big and real  issue  and  should  be\r\n\r\naddressed  quickly.  That is why Prof.  Michael  Porter's\r\n\r\nexact  words  were,  and I quote, \"we  have  to  get  the\r\n\r\nGovernment out of the way\".  Before the Government  tries\r\n\r\nto   convince  Singaporeans  that  it  is  interested  in\r\n\r\npromoting  an  entrepreneurial economy as  opposed  to  a\r\n\r\ncorporate economy driven by GLCs and MNCs alone, it  must\r\n\r\nfirst  settle the issue of whether it is willing to leave\r\n\r\nthe  battle field.  My reading is that the Government has\r\n\r\na  half-hearted  view  on this and  when  key  people  in\r\n\r\nTemasek  say  that  they will get even stronger  and  not\r\n\r\nweaker in the domestic market, it confirms my view of the\r\n\r\nhalf-heartedness.  If this is so, we have almost lost the\r\n\r\nbattle of promoting entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if we accept the argument that, in the past,\r\n\r\nthe Government had to move into certain industries due to\r\n\r\nmarket  failure and play a developmental role, is it  not\r\n\r\nabout  time  for  them  to be exiting  these  industries,\r\n\r\nespecially when there are enough private sector companies\r\n\r\nwhich  can  do  a better job?  How many can  really  play\r\n\r\neffectively  in  our small market?  How many  are  indeed\r\n\r\nthinking  of going global?  Who are the best to lead  the\r\n\r\nglobalisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchallenge?  Obviously, the GLCs are the ones as they have\r\n\r\nthe muscles in place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, if Temasek, or any one of the\r\n\r\ncompanies, wants to start a new business, the onus should\r\n\r\nbe  on Temasek to articulate and convince the public  why\r\n\r\nit  is in line with Temasek Charter and why there are  no\r\n\r\nprivate  sector companies capable of doing the same  job.\r\n\r\nIn  this  way,  instead  of GLCs  using  their  time  and\r\n\r\nresources  to find ways to do more business  locally  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  getting into businesses like the  roast  ducks\r\n\r\nand  the  Delifrances, they should see how they can  more\r\n\r\neffectively go global with the same resources.   We  know\r\n\r\nthat, because of the sheer size and their resources, GLCs\r\n\r\ncan  beat  many  local companies in the  same  area  they\r\n\r\ncompete in, but is this really a useful exercise for  the\r\n\r\ncountry  because,  at  the end of the  day,  we  are  all\r\n\r\nplaying  for the same result?  And how long can the  GLCs\r\n\r\ncontinue to milk the domestic markets?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>New Role for Government in Business</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have listed many issues which are a result of\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  direct role in business.   As  I  have\r\n\r\nstated earlier in my speech, we need to define a new role\r\n\r\nfor the Government if we want to successfully restructure\r\n\r\nour  economy.  I am not saying that we should destroy the\r\n\r\nrole  or destroy GLCs, but acknowledge that GLCs do still\r\n\r\nhave  a  role  to  play  in  the  future.   To  be  fair,\r\n\r\ntherefore, we should not ask the Government to completely\r\n\r\nexit, nor destroy value which has been created over  many\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, instead of going into the specifics of the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  which  are  in  the  Report   that   was\r\n\r\npublished, I would like to talk about some statements  on\r\n\r\nhow  the  Government should be positioning  itself.   The\r\n\r\nfirst and the most important commitment we need from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is that it is willing to change  its  mindset\r\n\r\nand  to get out of the way where private enterprises  can\r\n\r\ndo  an  equal or better job and if they can do a job  not\r\n\r\nbetter than GLCs,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  help the private companies improve, rather than  to\r\n\r\ncontinue   to  let  GLCs  grow.   As  I  mentioned,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot be half hearted about this.   A  clear\r\n\r\nstatement needs to be made.  From a national perspective,\r\n\r\neffort put in to groom local companies has the same value\r\n\r\nas  in  trying to groom GLCs.  With this mindset  change,\r\n\r\nmany  more  things can be done and these are  the  things\r\n\r\nthat  we have recommended in the report of the EISC under\r\n\r\nthe chairmanship of Mr Raymond Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, instead of considering each other as\r\n\r\ncompetitors  all the time, we should build a  culture  of\r\n\r\ntrust  and  partnership  among  GLCs  and  local  private\r\n\r\ncompanies.   Until  today, there has  been  too  much  of\r\n\r\nsuspicion and distrust.  If we could change this  culture\r\n\r\nto one of partnership and cooperation, then together head\r\n\r\ntowards  global market as a team, our chances of  success\r\n\r\nwill  be greatly enhanced.  All companies, big and small,\r\n\r\nshould  focus  on how they can leverage on  each  other's\r\n\r\nstrengths as competitive threat to foreign companies in a\r\n\r\nglobal  market.  The Government could play a very  useful\r\n\r\nrole in facilitating this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Government should be focusing more on\r\n\r\nplaying a developmental role rather than a direct role in\r\n\r\nbusiness.   In  creating  a  conducive  environment   and\r\n\r\nallowing private companies to test-bed their products and\r\n\r\nservices,  it  will  go a long way in helping  to  create\r\n\r\nstronger  local companies.  Similarly, instead of  taking\r\n\r\nthe  easy way out of creating a new division under a GLC,\r\n\r\nor to form new companies within the statutory boards, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should encourage the outsourcing of  products\r\n\r\nand services as much as possible as is being done in many\r\n\r\ncountries, including US and the UK.  The current practice\r\n\r\nof  GLCs creating subsidiaries after subsidiaries  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger acceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, there is a great lack of risk capital\r\n\r\navailable  for private companies.  The many VC  funds  we\r\n\r\nhave  in  Singapore are focused on later stage financing.\r\n\r\nThe  Government could move in and play a role of  a  risk\r\n\r\ncapital provider, either\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndirectly or indirectly through the GLCs.  Instead of just\r\n\r\nfocusing  on creating companies, the Government  and  its\r\n\r\nagencies,  including  Temasek,  should  make  more   risk\r\n\r\ncapital  available  to the private sector  and  focus  on\r\n\r\nfacilitating  the  development  of  new  private   sector\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Temasek's Response and its Charter</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final topic I would like to cover is my\r\n\r\nresponse to the Temasek Charter and on areas which I feel\r\n\r\nare  not  adequately addressed.  The first  one  is  that\r\n\r\nthere  is no statement of greater transparency in Temasek\r\n\r\nCharter.   I  was a little disappointed that nothing  has\r\n\r\nbeen said about how Temasek will be much more transparent\r\n\r\nthan it has been all this time.  If the public is to have\r\n\r\nconfidence  that Temasek will be professional in  running\r\n\r\nits companies and if we want everyone to feel comfortable\r\n\r\nthat  once Temasek is in charge of any Government created\r\n\r\nbusinesses,   decisions  will  be  made  on  commercially\r\n\r\nacceptable  terms, then we must take the necessary  steps\r\n\r\nto  build  the  trust first.  I therefore hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Finance  will  put  in  place  sufficient\r\n\r\nmechanics   to  ensure  that  Temasek  will   remain   as\r\n\r\ntransparent as possible.  If Temasek is indeed doing  the\r\n\r\nright  things, then there is no reason to fear and resist\r\n\r\ngreater  transparency.  While I have  the  confidence  in\r\n\r\nmany  of the people in Temasek, I also feel that it is  a\r\n\r\nlittle too reckless for us to just depend on a few people\r\n\r\nfor   things  which  have  a  tremendous  impact  on  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  economy.   I  therefore  again  ask  for  more\r\n\r\ntransparency  and, along with it, greater  accountability\r\n\r\nfrom  the  people  in charge.  Similarly,  we  must  have\r\n\r\ngreater   transparency  from  GIC  and  other  Government\r\n\r\nagencies managing public funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, Temasek should release, as Mr Leong\r\n\r\nmentioned,  an  annual  \"state of  the  GLC\"  report  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to understand what goes on in Temasek.   The\r\n\r\nreal question is, while Temasek audits its companies, who\r\n\r\naudits Temasek?  Is it good enough to leave it to  a  few\r\n\r\npeople in Government to audit itself?  And I think\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  traditional  practice is no  longer  convincing  to\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Divestment - Form and Timing</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second thing that was not adequately\r\n\r\ncovered in Temasek Charter was its policy on divestment - the  form  and timing of it.  While Temasek has mentioned\r\n\r\nits  desire  to divest businesses which are non-core  and\r\n\r\nwhich  are  non-strategic, it has not spelt  out  how  it\r\n\r\nplans to do it and what the timetable is.  I recall, when\r\n\r\nthe  EISC  released  its report suggesting  a  divestment\r\n\r\nstrategy for GLCs, the first reaction from the members of\r\n\r\nthe  press was - so, what is new, and they were referring\r\n\r\nto  a  report, which Mr Leong also mentioned, which  they\r\n\r\ncalled  the Michael Fam report about divestment of  GLCs.\r\n\r\nTheir  point  was  that there have  been  no  significant\r\n\r\ndivestments,  some  but  not  fast  enough  and,  on  the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  as Mr Leong pointed out, there are  many  more\r\n\r\nGLCs  that  have  been created after that.   I  therefore\r\n\r\nwould  like  to see a clearer statement from Temasek  and\r\n\r\nthe   Government  on  its  divestment  plans,   including\r\n\r\ndivesting by non-traditional ways like MBOs and JVs.  The\r\n\r\nNatSteel  way  was one example of such a  non-traditional\r\n\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Being fair to SMEs</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third issue is one of being fair to SMEs.\r\n\r\nOne  complaint which has been brought up to my  attention\r\n\r\nis   the  business  practice  of  bigger  companies,   in\r\n\r\nparticular  the GLCs.  The issue, among others,  includes\r\n\r\none  of  payment terms and paying on time.  It is  almost\r\n\r\ndescribed as a \"bullying tactic\" by a number of people  I\r\n\r\nspoke to, and this was brought up in some of the Feedback\r\n\r\nsessions that I chaired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I studied this issue, I learned of two examples\r\n\r\nwhich  should be role models for Temasek to  follow,  and\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government too.  The first,  I  realise,  there\r\n\r\nexisted  a directive from the Prime Minister's office  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  instructing all its agencies  to  be  fair  to\r\n\r\nlocal companies and to pay promptly, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  local companies feel that they have been unfairly\r\n\r\ntreated,  the  Prime Minister's office  will  investigate\r\n\r\ninto  the  matter.  The second practice,  which  is  more\r\n\r\nwidely  known,  is the practice of the oil giant,  Shell,\r\n\r\nwhich  has  a special audit committee which ensures  that\r\n\r\nall its suppliers are paid on time and fairly treated.  I\r\n\r\nwas  told that in Shell, business units find it so  tough\r\n\r\ndealing with this audit committee that they rather  spend\r\n\r\ntheir  time treating their suppliers fairly than to  face\r\n\r\nthe brunt of this committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not suggesting that the \"bullying\r\n\r\nphenomenon\"  is rampant in Singapore and is being  widely\r\n\r\npractised  by the Government agencies, but  it  would  be\r\n\r\nprudent  to set up a similar committee in Government  and\r\n\r\none  in Temasek, so that we send a strong signal that the\r\n\r\ninterests of private companies are well taken care of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  give  a  concrete response  to  the  EISC\r\n\r\nrecommendations and to address the missing gaps  which  I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned.   I feel that if we are  indeed  serious\r\n\r\nabout  making the transformation from a corporate  to  an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial    economy,   the    Government    should\r\n\r\nimmediately  resolve  all  the  issues  which  have  been\r\n\r\nraised,  and  to  operationalise the many recommendations\r\n\r\nthe EISC has made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank you for allowing me to join in the debate.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  declare my interest as an employee  of  Temasek\r\n\r\nHoldings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Motion is, in essence, a discussion of the\r\n\r\nrole of Government in business, whether the Government is\r\n\r\na regulator, promoter or a participant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important discussion, but it derives\r\n\r\nmeaning  only  when  it is made in  the  context  of  the\r\n\r\nrealities of the marketplace that Singapore competes  in.\r\n\r\nI would like now to offer my take on two harsh realities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reality is of increasing globalisation.\r\n\r\nIncreasing  globalisation of the marketplace  is  not  an\r\n\r\noption  nor a passing fad, but is a reality that we  have\r\n\r\nto    address   head-on   as   an   on-going   challenge.\r\n\r\nGlobalisation has real significance for us  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nas  we  do  not  have  our own hinterland,  unlike  major\r\n\r\nmarkets  like the US or Europe.  The lack of a hinterland\r\n\r\nis  most  keenly  felt by Singaporean  entrepreneurs  and\r\n\r\ncompanies who have already ventured abroad.  We  have  no\r\n\r\ncritical mass of our own and cannot pretend that  we  can\r\n\r\nsustain businesses purely domestically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Singaporeans have asked if we can pump prime\r\n\r\nour  economy  or consume our way out of a recession,  and\r\n\r\nthe  answer  is  no.   Our economy depends  too  much  on\r\n\r\nexternal demand for us to be able to prop the economy  up\r\n\r\nby   merely  raising  expenditure.   Hence,  to   sustain\r\n\r\neconomic growth, not only do we have to ensure there  are\r\n\r\nenough  inbound investments, but we have also  to  source\r\n\r\ngrowth potential from outside Singapore as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine if Singapore Airlines were to just fly\r\n\r\nmainly Singaporeans from Singapore to other destinations,\r\n\r\nand  no  one else, nor from anywhere else, then it  would\r\n\r\nnot  have half the chance of Ansett and would have folded\r\n\r\nup  long ago.  Or that if Singapore Telecom were to  just\r\n\r\ncater  to  the  domestic  market,  growth  would  require\r\n\r\norganic  expansion  domestically and increased  usage  of\r\n\r\ntelecommunication services or, in simple  terms,  we  all\r\n\r\nneed  to  talk a little more over the phone.  Or that  if\r\n\r\nYeo  Hiap  Seng had remained in Singapore, with  our  low\r\n\r\npopulation  growth rates, how many more tins  of  chicken\r\n\r\ncurry and packet drinks can Singaporeans consume?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, expanding outside Singapore is no longer a\r\n\r\nwish but an imperative for most businesses, regardless of\r\n\r\nownership.  We have to get out of our comfort  zone.   We\r\n\r\nmust  now think GNP (Gross National Product) and not  GDP\r\n\r\n(Gross Domestic Product).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second reality is one of intensifying\r\n\r\ncompetition.   Increasing globalisation  brings  with  it\r\n\r\npressure to break\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndown   protectionist  barriers,  and   hence   heightened\r\n\r\ncompetition.   In  a  free market such  as  ours,  fierce\r\n\r\ncompetition  from  all players, big or  small,  local  or\r\n\r\nforeign, has already been felt.  This is most evident  in\r\n\r\nthe  retail sector.  Take the supermarkets, for  example.\r\n\r\nI  recall,  when I was young, going to the  NTUC  Welcome\r\n\r\nSupermarket at Beo Crescent was a real treat.   Nowadays,\r\n\r\nit  is  almost  a must for most working couples.   It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  almost  inevitable that the smaller  provision\r\n\r\nshops  will find it tougher to compete unless they  offer\r\n\r\nthat   something  special.   We  may  think   that   NTUC\r\n\r\nFairprice, as it is called now, has it easier.  But  they\r\n\r\ntoo  have  to compete against foreign-owned players  like\r\n\r\nCold Storage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is our response? In the face of these\r\n\r\nexternally-driven  challenges,  we  need   not   despair.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  need  to  examine  our  position  from  the\r\n\r\nfollowing two perspectives:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) What are our skills and strengths that we can\r\n\r\nleverage on to get out of our comfort zone; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) How do we position Singapore? Who are the\r\n\r\nplayers here and how can they relate to each other?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on skills and strengths. Over the years,\r\n\r\nwe  have built up substantial expertise as a services hub\r\n\r\nin airport and seaport management, telecommunications and\r\n\r\nfinancial services.  Hence, we should be actively seeking\r\n\r\nways   of  exporting  these  capabilities  abroad.    For\r\n\r\nexample,  we  should  not centre our  airport  management\r\n\r\nservices around yet more terminals at Changi but at other\r\n\r\nregional  or Asian airports.  Likewise, whatever  seaport\r\n\r\nmanagement expertise we have built up over the years, eg,\r\n\r\nin  vessel  connectivity,  should  be  actively  promoted\r\n\r\nelsewhere as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our human capital should not be ignored too. As a\r\n\r\npeople,  we  have  been respected for our  integrity  and\r\n\r\ndiligence.   These are useful values to build  management\r\n\r\nand  the labour force at large upon.  We should certainly\r\n\r\nnot  be  arrogant  but  be prepared  to  explore  foreign\r\n\r\npostings as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npart and parcel of our working lives.  Getting out of our\r\n\r\ncomfort zone is not easy, but if we accept that it is not\r\n\r\nonly   inevitable  but  that  it  can  also  be  a   rich\r\n\r\nexperience,   I   believe  we  can  all   become   better\r\n\r\ncontributors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the flip side to identifying our strengths is\r\n\r\nthe   need  to  validate  the  tried-and-tested   success\r\n\r\nformula.  Industry and market conditions are now changing\r\n\r\nwith a vengeance.  Hence, we need to constantly check our\r\n\r\nassumptions.   What has worked well before  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nachieving  pure  efficiency may now be a  value-for-money\r\n\r\nproposition.   This  is  well  illustrated   within   the\r\n\r\nlogistics  area  where  value  is  sometimes  defined  as\r\n\r\n\"getting  goods  off  the  balance  sheet\"  rather   than\r\n\r\nshipping to the destination in the fastest possible time.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, we must test every assumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, identifying roles of players. Sir, the\r\n\r\nMotion  revolves around the role that each sector  should\r\n\r\nplay   in   building  GDP.   According  to  the  official\r\n\r\nstatistics, the table of which was circulated by the hon.\r\n\r\nMember, Mr Leong Horn Kee, the MNCs accounted for  a  42%\r\n\r\nshare,  followed by an implied 36% share by  the  non-GLC\r\n\r\nprivate  sector, 13% by the GLCs, and 9%  by  the  public\r\n\r\nsector.   However, unlike Mr Leong Horn  Kee,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  it  is complete to discuss the relative shares  of\r\n\r\nGDP on a locally-owned basis, as it ignores the role that\r\n\r\nMNCs  play.   We should not limit ourselves to  the  many\r\n\r\npossibilities  that the MNCs can interact  with  our  own\r\n\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the significant role that MNCs play, the\r\n\r\nEDB's efforts in promoting investments must continue full\r\n\r\nsteam  ahead.  Last year, the EDB managed to secure  some\r\n\r\n$9  billion worth of investment commitments.  This is  no\r\n\r\nsmall  feat  and demonstrates that Singapore  has  indeed\r\n\r\nbeen  nimble-footed.   We  must  continue  to  have  this\r\n\r\nmindset,  both the Government as promoter and the  people\r\n\r\nas human capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst investments by MNCs have helped spur and will\r\n\r\ncontinue to spur the development of supporting cluster\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservices,  we need to build up our own capabilities,  our\r\n\r\nown  enterprise,  for both GLCs and the non-GLCs  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.  Some of the GLCs, as we all know,  have\r\n\r\nevolved with Singapore's history.  They nonetheless still\r\n\r\nneed  to hold their own in the global marketplace.   They\r\n\r\nmust  do  this  by building on their core  competence  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to expand outside Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the imperative is equally applicable to the non-GLCs, as the marketplace does not differentiate between\r\n\r\nownership,  whether it is Government, private,  local  or\r\n\r\nforeign, but only the level of competitiveness.   Pooling\r\n\r\nof   interests  can  therefore  be  mutually  beneficial.\r\n\r\nTowards   this   end,   given  our   limited   resources,\r\n\r\ncollaboration must surely be the name of the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But collaboration can only exist and be meaningful\r\n\r\nif  mutual  benefits can truly be derived.  I would  urge\r\n\r\nboth  GLCs and non-GLCs, especially the small and  medium\r\n\r\nenterprises,  to  identify common areas  of  focus,  say,\r\n\r\nwithin   a  cluster,  where  collaboration  is  possible.\r\n\r\nSimilar  collaborations between MNCs and local  companies\r\n\r\nshould also be actively structured and pursued.  I  would\r\n\r\nalso  urge  the relevant Government agencies to  be  more\r\n\r\nfocused  in  their promotional efforts and  to  emphasise\r\n\r\nsubstance  over  form.   For  example,  do  not  be   too\r\n\r\npreoccupied  with  the degree of participation  in  trade\r\n\r\ndelegations  but  with  the number of  concrete  business\r\n\r\nventures  or  relationships  that  result  from  a  trade\r\n\r\ndelegation's visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the principle of\r\n\r\npromoting  private  enterprise  and  entrepreneurship  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   However,  Sir, whilst  we  should  certainly\r\n\r\nspend time and effort to address specific concerns of the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector,  we  should take  extreme  care  not  to\r\n\r\nquibble excessively over domestic space, as the world may\r\n\r\njust pass us by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have\r\n\r\nlistened with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreat  interest  to  the speakers  before  me.   I  guess\r\n\r\nnothing  more wonderfully concentrates the mind  than  to\r\n\r\nhave  a Motion that debates the recommendations of a sub-committee  in  which the paternity ultimately  lies  with\r\n\r\noneself.  I would however like to thank but not implicate\r\n\r\nMr Inderjit Singh for the work that he did as Chairman of\r\n\r\nthe Focus Group on Government in Business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EISC released the part of its report dealing\r\n\r\nwith  Government in Business on 30th May this year.   The\r\n\r\nTemasek Charter took this into account.  The full  report\r\n\r\nof the EISC recommending ways to strengthen the spirit of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  and  innovation  in  Singapore  and  to\r\n\r\nfoster  the growth and internationalisation of Singapore-based companies will be released in September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thought it would be useful to give Members\r\n\r\nsome  perspectives  on the thinking that  went  into  the\r\n\r\nEISC's recommendations.  But, first, let me deal with one\r\n\r\nrecommendation  that  was  strongly  urged  on  the  sub-committee  but  which  we did not  adopt.   This  was  to\r\n\r\nrecommend  a  huge sell-off of the GLCs  to  the  private\r\n\r\nsector, or what the press has dubbed a \"Great GLC  Sale\".\r\n\r\nIf  we  had done that, then we would have gone far enough\r\n\r\nand bold enough, I think, in their view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal case for rapid privatisation is that\r\n\r\nit  will  significantly improve the  performance  of  the\r\n\r\nGLCs.   To support this contention, its proponents  often\r\n\r\ncite    anecdotes    of   under-performing    state-owned\r\n\r\nenterprises,  rather than systematic studies.   Anecdotes\r\n\r\nare,  of  course, better than nothing, but they are  weak\r\n\r\nfoundations  to base economic policy prescriptions.   The\r\n\r\nproblem  with  anecdotes is that the  contrary  case  can\r\n\r\nalways be cited.  For instance, the argument here is that\r\n\r\nthere is something inherent in Government ownership which\r\n\r\ncauses    state-owned   enterprises   to   under-perform.\r\n\r\nSingapore   Airlines  is  a  company   with   substantial\r\n\r\nGovernment ownership but, as we all know, it  is  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  best  airlines in the world.  Then, there is  Changi\r\n\r\nAirport,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich is wholly owned by the Government, but that has not\r\n\r\nstopped  it  from  being consistently voted  by  business\r\n\r\ntravellers as the best of the breed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anecdotes often reflect the fashion of the times.\r\n\r\nWhen  I  was  a  student  in the  1970s  and  1980s,  the\r\n\r\nprevailing  school  of thought then was  that  the  state\r\n\r\nshould  play a leading role in the market.  It was called\r\n\r\n\"governing the market\", and Japan and Korea were cited as\r\n\r\nstellar  examples of this.  Lester Thurow  wrote  a  book\r\n\r\n\"Head  to Head\" in which he predicted that unless America\r\n\r\ntook a leaf out of Japan Inc's strategy book, it would be\r\n\r\ncleaned  out  by the Japanese in the global  marketplace.\r\n\r\nThat  book  topped  the  best-seller  list  and,  for  an\r\n\r\neconomics  book,  that was really quite  an  achievement.\r\n\r\nToday,  if we were to suggest this, we would be dismissed\r\n\r\nby derisive laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fashion of the 1990s had been privatisation and\r\n\r\nmarket liberalisation.  This Washington Consensus has led\r\n\r\nthe  IMF  and the World Bank to urge developing countries\r\n\r\nto   privatise  rapidly,  privatise  even  when  critical\r\n\r\ncomplementary  conditions are not present -  competition,\r\n\r\nhard budgets and commitment.  The result is not pretty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, before we rush off and join the chorus that\r\n\r\n\"Government  ownership invariably leads to  inefficiency,\r\n\r\nand private ownership is the way to raise the performance\r\n\r\nof  the  GLCs\",  we  better ask  ourselves  what  is  the\r\n\r\nempirical evidence to support this policy recommendation.\r\n\r\nI  have plowed through the literature and the bottom-line\r\n\r\nis  that  there  is no conclusive finding  that  this  is\r\n\r\nindeed  the  case.  The World Bank commissioned  a  study\r\n\r\nwhich was released in 1995, \"Bureaucrats in Business\" and\r\n\r\nit said that in competitive markets, there was an edge to\r\n\r\nprivate ownership.  \"An edge\", not a mountain of evidence\r\n\r\nthat private ownership would indeed enhance efficiency in\r\n\r\nstate-owned enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it not more decisive? The reason lies with\r\n\r\nthe  basis  of  the argument for privatisation.   At  its\r\n\r\nheart,  the  privatisation argument posits  that  private\r\n\r\nowners,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunlike   Government  owners,  have  a  greater   economic\r\n\r\nincentive  to maximise shareholder value, as  they  would\r\n\r\nbenefit more directly from such actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this is not necessarily the case with\r\n\r\nlarge  enterprises.   Large  enterprises  -  private   or\r\n\r\nGovernment-owned  -  suffer  from  the   same   incentive\r\n\r\nproblems.  In a large private company, the separation  of\r\n\r\nowners   and  control  leads  to  substantial  management\r\n\r\nautonomy  that allows managers the discretion to  act  in\r\n\r\ntheir own rather than shareholders' interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, there is a significant information\r\n\r\nasymmetry  between  the  owners  and  the  managers.  The\r\n\r\nmanagers   will  be  able  to  run  circles   round   the\r\n\r\nshareholders as they have the information advantage.  The\r\n\r\nacquisition of the requisite information incurs  economic\r\n\r\ncosts.  This problem is then compounded by the fact  that\r\n\r\ngood  management  is a public good.  If  one  shareholder\r\n\r\nacts,  then  all benefit.  And in the nature  of  such  a\r\n\r\ngood,  this free rider problem would negate the incentive\r\n\r\nfor a small shareholder to monitor the firm's executives.\r\n\r\nTo   ignore   information  costs  in   an   analysis   of\r\n\r\norganisational  behaviour is like having  Hamlet  without\r\n\r\nthe Prince.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need look no further for evidence of this than in\r\n\r\nthe  corporate scandals that are now rocking Wall Street.\r\n\r\nHas  there been, in recent times, any destruction of  the\r\n\r\npublic   interest  greater  than  that  by   the   senior\r\n\r\nexecutives of Enron of their shareholders?  Yet Enron was\r\n\r\na company that was owned by private shareholders, not the\r\n\r\nUS government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were tomorrow to divest completely the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  stakes by issuing shares  in  GLCs  to  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, this will not lead to enhanced  performance\r\n\r\nof these companies.  People's capitalism, as some Eastern\r\n\r\nEuropean countries had practised since the wall came down\r\n\r\nin  Berlin,  suffers  from the fact that  there  are  few\r\n\r\nshareholders  with  sufficient amounts  invested  in  the\r\n\r\ncompanies  so  that  they have a strong  enough  economic\r\n\r\ninterest to ensure that the firm is well-managed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was why the EISC did not recommend a \"Great GLC\r\n\r\nSale\" as some had hoped.  Privatisation may have the edge\r\n\r\nin raising efficiency but it is not a given and it raises\r\n\r\nthe question as to who the GLCs should be sold to, so  as\r\n\r\nto ensure direction and control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, as Mr Inderjit Singh has said, the way\r\n\r\nwe  saw  it,  the  central issue was the proper  role  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  in business in this innovation-driven  world.\r\n\r\nIn  the early post-independence years, the Government was\r\n\r\nthe  entrepreneur  as  it  took entrepreneurial  risk  by\r\n\r\ninvesting   in  companies  such  as  Singapore  Airlines,\r\n\r\nNeptune Orient Lines and the shipyards. There was then  a\r\n\r\ndearth  of  private capital to embark on these  kinds  of\r\n\r\nproject.  As both Mr Leong and Mr Singh have said, today,\r\n\r\nwith   well-developed  markets,  the  case   for   direct\r\n\r\nGovernment   involvement  in  business   is   much   less\r\n\r\ncompelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the basis on which we recommended that\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards should adopt a Yellow Pages rule.  This\r\n\r\nmeans that statutory boards should not set up enterprises\r\n\r\nwhen  there are private sector players that are providing\r\n\r\nor  able  to  provide  the service.  In  fact,  statutory\r\n\r\nboards   should  seize  such  opportunities  to   provide\r\n\r\nbusiness to the private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may well be that companies owned by statutory\r\n\r\nboards,  with proper incentive structures, could  provide\r\n\r\nthe  service as efficiently as the private sector but the\r\n\r\nissue  is  what should be the role of these boards.   Our\r\n\r\nview  is  that if the market can provide it,  then  these\r\n\r\nGovernment  bodies should concentrate on  regulation  and\r\n\r\npromotion  of  business  activities  rather  than  be  in\r\n\r\nbusiness themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have criticised this Yellow Pages rule on the\r\n\r\nground that some of these statutory board-owned companies\r\n\r\nfulfill  social  goals.  Like all  rules,  there  can  be\r\n\r\nexceptions to it but I would be slow to make them as even\r\n\r\nwhen  there  are social objectives, this can  be  written\r\n\r\ninto  the  contract for the provision of these  goods  or\r\n\r\nservices by the private producer.  For\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexample,  take  broadcasting.  If it is deemed  desirable\r\n\r\nthat  all  television stations must have a news  segment,\r\n\r\nthis  can  be written as a condition of the licence.   If\r\n\r\nadditional public service broadcast programmes are deemed\r\n\r\ndesirable,   then   rather   than   for   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nBroadcasting  Authority to produce them, it  can  provide\r\n\r\nfor  them  by paying the broadcasters to do these.   This\r\n\r\nis,  in  fact, what the SBA is doing, rather  than  going\r\n\r\ninto the business of public broadcasting itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the GLCs, it does not make sense for\r\n\r\nthe EISC to recommend that they abide by the Yellow Pages\r\n\r\nrule.  As Mr Leong has said, the horse has already bolted\r\n\r\nfrom the stable.  It is in this context that we recommend\r\n\r\nthat Temasek divests its non-strategic assets so that  it\r\n\r\ncan  concentrate its resources in areas where it can make\r\n\r\nthe most difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the key, we believe, to pressure GLCs to\r\n\r\nperform  is  competition.  It is  telling  that  our  two\r\n\r\nGovernment-owned world-beaters - SIA and CAAS  -  operate\r\n\r\nin   a   globally  competitive  environment  since  their\r\n\r\ninception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we started our report by recommending a\r\n\r\ncompetition law. Competition provides the incentives  for\r\n\r\nindividuals  and  companies  to  perform.   It  allows  a\r\n\r\nbenchmark  to  assess performance so that proper  rewards\r\n\r\nand penalties can be instituted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But competition will only pressure GLCs if they face\r\n\r\na  hard  budget constraint.  This was why we  argue  that\r\n\r\nthere  should not be subsidies, privileges or other forms\r\n\r\nof  soft capital that will enable them to compete without\r\n\r\nimproving  efficiency.  A hard budget will  also  address\r\n\r\nthe oft-repeated concerns of private firms that they face\r\n\r\nunfair competition from the GLCs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, competition and hard budgets will only work if\r\n\r\nthere is a Government commitment that the GLCs are to  be\r\n\r\nrun strictly as commercial entities.  This means that the\r\n\r\nGovernment must not interfere with the operations of  the\r\n\r\nGLCs such as hiring and firing managers and workers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand stopping money-losing services.  Social and political\r\n\r\ngoals  that the Government might have should not be  part\r\n\r\nof the objectives of the GLCs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the enabling conditions that the EISC felt\r\n\r\nwould  help enhance the performance of our GLCs.   Though\r\n\r\nthe  evidence  may  be slight when it  comes  to  whether\r\n\r\nprivatisation   alone   makes  a  difference   to   GLCs'\r\n\r\nperformance,  it  is  unambiguous  that  a  comprehensive\r\n\r\nstrategy  of  divestiture, competition, hard budgets  and\r\n\r\ncommitment,  pursued  as a whole, will  help  create  the\r\n\r\nconditions necessary for growth and performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, to those who argue single-mindedly for a\r\n\r\n\"Great  GLC Sale\", they may wish to note that \"there  are\r\n\r\nmore  things  in heaven and earth than are dreamt  of  in\r\n\r\ntheir philosophy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.52 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  involvement  in  private  sector   business\r\n\r\nstarted   way  back,  almost  about  the  same  time   as\r\n\r\nSingapore's  industralisation  effort,  soon  after   the\r\n\r\nBritish  withdrawal  in  1968.   To  handle  the  growing\r\n\r\nGovernment's  involvement in business,  Temasek  Holdings\r\n\r\nwas   established  in  1974.   Presumably,  flushed  with\r\n\r\nsuccess,  Government's involvement in the private  sector\r\n\r\ncontinued to proliferate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the public concern, the rationale for\r\n\r\nGovernment's involvement in private sector was laid  down\r\n\r\nby Dr Goh Keng Swee, DPM and Minister for Defence, at the\r\n\r\nIncome's  AGM on 20th June 1977.  Typical of Dr  Goh,  he\r\n\r\ngave the reason in very simple terms and to the point.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to state them to refresh our understanding  of\r\n\r\nthe basic rationale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, he stated that Government's involvement was\r\n\r\nto  encourage  the  private sector  to  take  the  plunge\r\n\r\nthrough  joint ventures.  He gave the example of National\r\n\r\nIron   and   Steel,  Jurong  Shipyard,   National   Green\r\n\r\nElevators, Sugar Industry of Singapore and so on.  And as\r\n\r\nthe economy grew, the Development Bank of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore and Intraco were established to fulfill what Dr\r\n\r\nGoh referred to as new needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to meet specific needs, Primary Industries\r\n\r\nEnterprises  was set up to process agricultural  products\r\n\r\nby  local  farmers - a pretty old industry, I  must  say.\r\n\r\nFalling into this category of specific needs, we find the\r\n\r\nMindef  companies established to meet the  needs  of  the\r\n\r\nSAF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to handle the odd case here and there. Dr\r\n\r\nGoh gave the example of Singapore Food Industry to tackle\r\n\r\nthe problem of corrupt practices among cooks employed  by\r\n\r\nMindef  leading  to the failure of the tender  system  in\r\n\r\nsourcing  for  meat and vegetables.  Presumably,  Dr  Goh\r\n\r\nraised  this  matter  in public to address  some  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  concerns.   It is interesting to  note  that  the\r\n\r\nprinciples  laid down by Dr Goh are ingrained in  Temasek\r\n\r\nHoldings'  latest Charter as well where it has classified\r\n\r\nits  companies into Group A and Group B.  In Group A,  we\r\n\r\nfind  companies  where Government would  like  to  retain\r\n\r\ncontrol and ownership for strategic reasons and in  Group\r\n\r\nB,  we  find  companies with regional  and  international\r\n\r\npotentials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite Dr Goh's assurance in 1977, Government-linked companies continued its expansion into the private\r\n\r\nsector.  In August 1983, in this House, Dr Toh Chin  Chye\r\n\r\nput the question to the then Minister for Finance, Mr Hon\r\n\r\nSui   Sen,  during  Question  Time  as  to  whether   the\r\n\r\nGovernment companies should be allowed to crowd  out  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.  Of course, Dr Toh did it  in  his  very\r\n\r\ncolourful  language, referring to the case of PIE  flying\r\n\r\nin 1,500 breeding pigs by jumbo jets.  Apparently, Dr Toh\r\n\r\nmust  be  referring to the fact that PIE was engaging  in\r\n\r\nsome  activities  that the private sector  could  perform\r\n\r\nwhich  contravened the principle laid  down  by  Dr  Goh.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  there  was  no definitive  response  from\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  that  particular  exchange.   Clearly,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  by then, the tentacles of the GLCs have grown  so\r\n\r\nnumerous and so pervasive that no one single agency has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntotal control or oversight on the reach of the GLCs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, public complaints about Government's\r\n\r\ninvolvement  continued through the years with  the  pitch\r\n\r\nrising  during times of economic slowdown and  adding  in\r\n\r\ntimes  of  economic booms.  After the  formation  of  the\r\n\r\nFeedback Unit in 1985 under my good friend, Dr Tan  Cheng\r\n\r\nBock  as  Chairman, there exists now, in its archives,  a\r\n\r\ncollection  of public comments on this particular  topic.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to  give a sample of  these  comments  to\r\n\r\nindicate  the gist of public complaints over a period  of\r\n\r\nthe past 20 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1985, Dr Dixie Tan, then MP for Ulu Pandan,\r\n\r\nin  a  note to Matthias Yao, Head of Feedback Unit  then,\r\n\r\nwrote,  \"Government  companies are competing  with  local\r\n\r\ncompanies in every area and with unfair advantage.   Even\r\n\r\nabroad,   private  companies  have  to  compete   against\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government companies.\"  In the same  year,  Mr\r\n\r\nTan  Tuan  Seng  wrote  a letter  to  the  Feedback  Unit\r\n\r\nregarding  the  uphill task of budding  entrepreneurs  in\r\n\r\nSingapore facing stiff competition from GLCs.  Under  the\r\n\r\nheading,  \"Better  Entrepreneur\", he  lamented  that  the\r\n\r\nplaying  field  was  uneven  with  GLCs  having  all  the\r\n\r\nresources and all the work references.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now I would like to share with you some of the\r\n\r\nmore  recent comments received by the Feedback Unit.   In\r\n\r\nJuly  2001, a contributor commented that the SME and  the\r\n\r\ncoffeeshop  network is filled with complaints about  GLCs\r\n\r\nand  Government statutory board corporations.  Is there a\r\n\r\nneed  for  Government to compete with  the  citizens  for\r\n\r\njobs?   If  GLCs and these corporatised statutory  boards\r\n\r\nexist  to  complement the economy, they should take  this\r\n\r\ntime  to  outsource more of their jobs  to  locals.   Why\r\n\r\ncorporatise statutory boards like Civil Service  College,\r\n\r\nPSB,  IPT  and many others?  The complaints are  greatest\r\n\r\nnow if the Government is the regulator and the player  in\r\n\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in August 2001, on the feedback on PWD\r\n\r\nConsultants,  a commentator said so, \"The  Government  is\r\n\r\nreleasing  public  jobs  that  account  for  70%  of  the\r\n\r\nconstruction work now to ease the slowdown but these jobs\r\n\r\nare  headed  for GLCs that have a moratorium  in  a  way.\r\n\r\nSuch  public  works should be distributed to the  private\r\n\r\nsector  to  ensure that the private sector stays  afloat.\r\n\r\nIn  recent years, the moratorium has increased  from  two\r\n\r\nyears  to five years and now more and more GLCs are being\r\n\r\nprivatised to compete in the private industry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I took time to bring up this\r\n\r\nexample  to  highlight that over a  20-year  period,  the\r\n\r\nviews expressed were basically the same.  In other words,\r\n\r\nnothing  very much has changed despite all this feedback.\r\n\r\nIt  is also disturbing to me that it took the more severe\r\n\r\nrecession  in our history to make the Government  sit  up\r\n\r\nand  set  up  the  EISC, and then pay attention  to  this\r\n\r\ncomplaint.   It  is pertinent to note that  many  of  the\r\n\r\nrecent  comments received by the Feedback Unit were  made\r\n\r\nbefore the formation of the Economic Review Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the work of the Feedback Unit, I\r\n\r\nwould like to point out that there is a group within  the\r\n\r\nFeedback  Unit  known as the Economic Development  Group.\r\n\r\nIt  was set up under the leadership of Dr John Chen,  the\r\n\r\nformer  Chairman of the Feedback Unit.   It  is  a  loose\r\n\r\nassociation  of  feedback contributors who  gather  about\r\n\r\nonce a month to discuss topics of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Group formed a sub-committee on developing a pro-enterprise environment in\r\n\r\nthe  new economy.  It submitted a recommendation in April\r\n\r\n2001.   That  report  talked  about  how  to  create   an\r\n\r\nenvironment that is pro-entrepreneurial and pro-business.\r\n\r\nAnd  in the 2002 annual conference of the feedback  group\r\n\r\nin July this year, Mr George Abraham presented a paper on\r\n\r\nthe  remaking of the Singapore economy incorporating  the\r\n\r\nwork  of  the  Economic Development  Group  and  the  SME\r\n\r\nFeedback  Group.  It is interesting to me  that  many  of\r\n\r\nthese views were reflected in the recommendations of  the\r\n\r\nEISC Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is heartening that the views expressed by the feedback\r\n\r\ncontributors have found  sympathetic ears in the EISC.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the Feedback Unit has contributed  to  the\r\n\r\nreview  of  Government's stand on this matter.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  thank the many contributors who have  played  a\r\n\r\npart in moulding public opinion on this topic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, next, I would like to explore\r\n\r\nwhether the EISC Report, the new Temasek Charter as  well\r\n\r\nas  this  debate  on  the Motion  will  be  effective  in\r\n\r\ncurtailing  Government's involvement in business.   Based\r\n\r\non  the behaviour of the Government in establishing  GLCs\r\n\r\nover  the  past  20  years, I must  say  that  I  am  not\r\n\r\noptimistic.   I am not saying so because I think  we  are\r\n\r\nnot serious about doing what is best for Singapore.  I am\r\n\r\nsaying so because there are factors involved.  Firstly, I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that when good times come back, this issue  will\r\n\r\nalso  recede  from  the  public  consciousness,  and  the\r\n\r\npressure will not be that great.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, I think we have to go to the\r\n\r\nfundamentals  and  perhaps try to understand  the  forces\r\n\r\nthat  have  been  driving the ever increasing  Government\r\n\r\ninvolvement  in  business.  Unless  we  understand  these\r\n\r\nfactors and take the appropriate steps to mitigate  them,\r\n\r\nI  think  Government will continue to spin off companies.\r\n\r\nJust by observing the outcomes, it seems to me that there\r\n\r\nare   powerful  forces  pushing  the  various  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments, agencies and statutory boards  to  spin  off\r\n\r\ncompanies.  I am not saying that there is a directive  of\r\n\r\nthe Government to do so.  But it is just that doing so is\r\n\r\na well beaten and tested path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are these forces? Firstly, spin-off allows the\r\n\r\nvarious  Government departments to shed excess  manpower.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that Government departments, like everyone\r\n\r\nelse, need to stay young and relevant, and they do so  by\r\n\r\nrecruiting   younger   staff  and  inducting   Government\r\n\r\nscholars.  Therefore, spinning off groups to form private\r\n\r\ncompanies  helps to keep the total number of staff  small\r\n\r\nwhich  is,  as  we all know, an objective  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice guidelines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, hiving off assets helps to reduce the\r\n\r\nasset  base  of  these organisations.   Of  course,  such\r\n\r\nassets  were  assessed  at  the  proper  values  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment did not suffer in privatisation.  However,  in\r\n\r\nthe  books  of  the parent departments and organisations,\r\n\r\nthat base is reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two recent examples come to mind. Firstly, Acasia\r\n\r\nof    JTC   and,   secondly,   PWD   Consultants.    Both\r\n\r\norganisations were granted moratorium from competition to\r\n\r\nentice  staff  to  leave the comfort zone  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice, and to take the plunge into the private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have also, on a previous occasion\r\n\r\nin   this  House,  touched  upon  the  public  perception\r\n\r\nregarding  the  existence of corporatised entity  helping\r\n\r\nthe rejuvenation of the civil service and the SAF through\r\n\r\nparachuting senior officers into such GLCs.  I understand\r\n\r\nfrom  the  DPM that the employment of all these staff  by\r\n\r\nthe  GLCs  is  through the market force.   However,  this\r\n\r\nperception remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think these factors driving the formation of\r\n\r\nGLCs  are powerful ones, and they are unlikely to go away\r\n\r\njust  because  of  this  debate  in  Parliament  and  the\r\n\r\nadoption of the EISC Report.  I believe it will require a\r\n\r\nstrong  commitment  from  the  Government  to  stop   the\r\n\r\ncontinuous encroachment into the private sector.  Whether\r\n\r\nthe  Government would do so will depend on the answer  to\r\n\r\nthe next question I have in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: is the existence of GLCs\r\n\r\ncontributing to the dearth of entrepreneurs in Singapore?\r\n\r\nWe do not have definitive answers but I believe there are\r\n\r\nsufficient  indications that this is so.   For  instance,\r\n\r\nmany  young  and capable people will be asking themselves\r\n\r\nwhy  should  they  take  the  risk  to  start  their  own\r\n\r\ncompanies  if  they could become  CEOs of  GLCs  just  by\r\n\r\ngoing  through  the academic route  -  be  Government  or\r\n\r\nSAF scholars, perform well in the public sector and serve\r\n\r\ntheir  term.  My friend, Mr Inderjit Singh, has mentioned\r\n\r\nthat the career path will be taken care of and the system\r\n\r\nwill take care of them, and they will become\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncorporate  captains of  large corporations sometime  down\r\n\r\nthe  road.   At  least, that is what many young  men  and\r\n\r\nwomen  will conclude by observing the career path of  the\r\n\r\nmany CEOs of GLCs today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is this perception good for Singapore? In my\r\n\r\nmind,  it is doubtful whether men and women who are  used\r\n\r\nto  a  command and control environment would  necessarily\r\n\r\nmake good entrepreneurs.  Some of them would make it, but\r\n\r\nperhaps after some very painful experience at the expense\r\n\r\nof  public  money.  I believe many of us could  think  of\r\n\r\nexamples  that illustrate my point.  On the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nseveral  of the really successful companies that continue\r\n\r\nto  do  well  in  this recession in Singapore  are  small\r\n\r\ncompanies  started by entrepreneurs, and I could  name  a\r\n\r\nfew   -  Hyflux started by Olivia Lum who is now an  NMP,\r\n\r\nOsim  started  by Ron Sim and Accord Express,  a  company\r\n\r\nmentioned by PM in his National Day Rally speech.   These\r\n\r\nare  true  entrepreneurs and Singapore would do  well  to\r\n\r\nhave  more of them.  Thus, while creating more GLCs might\r\n\r\nbe  the  expedient thing for the Government to do in  the\r\n\r\nshort term, it might actually be detrimental to the long-term  viability  of Singapore in a fast  changing  world.\r\n\r\nOnly  when  we are convinced that this is the case  would\r\n\r\nthe  tendency and propensity to create more GLCs  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture be curtailed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I am supportive of the new Temasek\r\n\r\nCharter  and  the  recommendations of  the  EISC,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  for us to address the fundamental questions  I\r\n\r\nraised.   Only  when we accept the answers  honestly  and\r\n\r\nwith  a clear mind would we be able to avoid the pitfalls\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  evolving into an outwardly private  sector\r\n\r\neconomy  but actually dominated by the GLCs,  an  economy\r\n\r\nwhich  we affectionately refer to Singapore Incorporated,\r\n\r\nan  economy that will perform well but will flounder  and\r\n\r\nlook  for  guidance in bad times.  To me,  Sir,  how  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   decides  on  this  particular  matter   will\r\n\r\ndetermine  whether  Singapore will  evolve  into  a  high\r\n\r\nperformance entrepreneurial economy or will always remain\r\n\r\nan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neconomy  that  is  tied  to the  umbilical  cord  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development and Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development and Minister for Defence (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Leong Horn Kee\r\n\r\nspoke  about  the  differences  between  Hong  Kong   and\r\n\r\nSingapore,  how  Hong  Kong  has  become  a  nursery   of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  while Singapore is  really  a  desert.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to continue this analogy between Singapore and\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  and  set the substance of my debate  in  this\r\n\r\ncontext.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore and Hong Kong are successful city states.\r\n\r\nWe are the envy of countries big and small.  Every time a\r\n\r\ncountry like East Timor gets independence, they say  they\r\n\r\nwant to be like Singapore.  We have arrived today at  our\r\n\r\npositions   by  very  different  routes.   I   need   not\r\n\r\nelaborate.  Hong Kong grew with minimal governance  -   a\r\n\r\nbottom-up  approach  -  while Singapore largely prospered\r\n\r\nbecause of Government's top-down approach.  Hong Kong  is\r\n\r\ntrying  to be a bit like Singapore.  Singapore is  trying\r\n\r\nto be a bit like Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.10 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, after 30 years of relentless economic growth\r\n\r\nin  both city states, we have reached a crossroad.   Hong\r\n\r\nKong and Singapore are pausing, taking stock and both are\r\n\r\nscratching  their heads, but I think these  questions  of\r\n\r\nhow  to  go  forward from here focus the  minds  of  both\r\n\r\ngovernments.   But in the case of Singapore, fortunately,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  our industrial policies, much criticised  no\r\n\r\ndoubt, I think we have more levers to pull than Hong Kong\r\n\r\n-   more levers to pull for entrepreneurs, more levers to\r\n\r\npull  for  all  Singaporeans.  Our decisive advantage  is\r\n\r\nreally the GLCs, and here I confine myself to the Temasek\r\n\r\nHoldings  companies  and not the  NTUC  companies,  which\r\n\r\nreally  serve  the  domestic  market.   I  want  to  talk\r\n\r\nsomething  about the NTUC-linked companies  a  bit  later\r\n\r\non.  Because only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTemasek  has the clout to anchor Singapore to  the  world\r\n\r\nbeyond  our  shores.   We  have  many  entrepreneurs   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Some of them are sitting in this House.   But\r\n\r\nfor  them  to reach out beyond our shores is  really  one\r\n\r\nleap  too far.  Only Temasek can give us what I call  the\r\n\r\nGNP  effect   -  the GDP plus net foreign earnings.  What\r\n\r\nfor?   To  compensate for a slowing GDP which  is  almost\r\n\r\ninevitable,  because  of  an  aging  population   and   a\r\n\r\ndeclining birth rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, back to Hong Kong. The laissez-faire economy\r\n\r\nin  Hong  Kong has always been paraded as the  utopia  of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.  Mr Leong proudly said that Hong Kong  has\r\n\r\n12  billionaires.  Singapore has five billionaires.   The\r\n\r\nfact  is that they are richer than us.  They have  double\r\n\r\nour  population  notwithstanding.  But whether  they  are\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  of the breed that inspire  confidence  and\r\n\r\nenvy  is  quite  different.  I will  quote  an  Economist\r\n\r\narticle  entitled \"Face Value  -  Asia's superman  swoops\r\n\r\nagain\".   Basically, it is about Mr Li, but  the  opening\r\n\r\nparagraph is instructive. It is worth reading.  It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In all honesty [in typical Economist style] most of\r\n\r\nAsia's  tycoons no matter how illustrious they appear  at\r\n\r\nhome  are really keepers of glorified mom and pop  shops.\r\n\r\nThe exception is Mr Li Ka Shing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI will talk about Mr Li a bit later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how did they become billionaires? There are\r\n\r\nmany reasons.  The Economist went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Among many reasons, they were developers who simply\r\n\r\nrode with land prices.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality in Hong Kong today is a noisy market\r\n\r\nplace,  crowded with thousands of entrepreneurs who  are,\r\n\r\nin the final analysis, owners of SMEs and glorified sweat\r\n\r\nshops.  They perform useful roles.  Please do not get  me\r\n\r\nwrong.   They  provide employment for the  masses.   They\r\n\r\nprovide hope.  But the world has changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the economic food chain of the WTO, the new\r\n\r\nregime,  it is a big fish eat small fish scenario.   Hong\r\n\r\nKong's cousins, their brethrens, from mainland China, are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeginning to eat Hong Kong SMEs and sweat shop owners  as\r\n\r\nfish feed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the matter is this. In Hong Kong, a\r\n\r\nfew  tycoons and their gargantuan holding companies, like\r\n\r\nCheung  Kong  and Hutchinson Whampoa, dominate  the  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  economy.  People do not see that.  Together,  these\r\n\r\ncompanies and the tycoons employ hundreds of thousands of\r\n\r\nworkers,  and  their decisions influence the  destiny  of\r\n\r\nHong Kong and HongKongers.  These tycoons own an eclectic\r\n\r\ngroup  of businesses, sometimes totally unrelated.   They\r\n\r\nare  like the mini-government of Hong Kong.  Some say the\r\n\r\nonly  government of Hong Kong.  These tycoons  own  what?\r\n\r\nThey    own    banks,   the   ports,   power    stations,\r\n\r\ntelecommunications, the media, retail, yes,  supermarkets\r\n\r\nand,  of  course,  real estate.  They  are  the  economic\r\n\r\nequivalents  of  our Temasek-linked companies.   But  the\r\n\r\nsimilarities  end  here.  They are  powerful.   They  are\r\n\r\nrich.  GLCs are rich, but GLCs are not powerful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hong Kong tycoons and their companies are\r\n\r\nanswerable  to no one, but themselves, their shareholders\r\n\r\nand their boards of directors.  But usually they have the\r\n\r\nbiggest chunks of shares in their own companies.  So they\r\n\r\nare  basically answerable to shareholders of  which  they\r\n\r\nform   a  large  part.   And  they  are  very  profitable\r\n\r\ncompanies.   The profits only accrue to the shareholders.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, GLCs are not powerful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we are debating the role of Government-linked\r\n\r\ncompanies, Temasek-linked companies in this House.   TLCs\r\n\r\nare answerable not only to shareholders, because some are\r\n\r\nlisted, and their boards of directors but, of course,  to\r\n\r\nTemasek  Holdings,  which has to  answer  to  Government.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why we are here today.  And Government  has  to\r\n\r\naccount   to   MPs   who  have  to   account   to   their\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  So, talk about transparency, talk  about\r\n\r\naccountability,  our GLCs, our TLCs  in  particular,  are\r\n\r\nextremely accountable.  Anybody can move a motion or file\r\n\r\na  Question.   In my 10 years here, I have heard  several\r\n\r\nquestions  and answers on why these TLCs went  into  this\r\n\r\nbusiness, why this business failed, and the Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Finance dutifully stood up and gave an answer which,\r\n\r\nI   think,   most  of  us  accept,  while  some  disagree\r\n\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am using this example to drive home the first of\r\n\r\nmany messages in the New World, in the new regime of WTO.\r\n\r\nAnd  this  first message I want to drive home is  this  - that  TLCs are not villains.  In a global economy, a  few\r\n\r\ncompanies  dominate.   This  happens  in  Singapore.   It\r\n\r\nhappens to be GLCs because of our history.  It happens in\r\n\r\nHong Kong.  A few tycoon-dominated companies control  and\r\n\r\nrun  Hong  Kong.   And the rest of us, SMEs,  sweat  shop\r\n\r\nowners,   have  to  feed  off  these  TLCs,  tycoon-owned\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   It  is the same everywhere.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\ntoo  many  Singaporeans love to hate  our  Temasek-linked\r\n\r\ncompanies  and now that has been extended to  NTUC-linked\r\n\r\ncompanies.   They  blame  TLCs for  the  death  of  local\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.   They say, dismantle the TLCs,  and  then\r\n\r\neverything   will   be  fine.   All  entrepreneurs   will\r\n\r\nmushroom.  They will grow, they will flourish,  and  then\r\n\r\nthey will be big.  But I wish it were true and life is so\r\n\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh, please take\r\n\r\na  look  at  Hong Kong and tell me, where  are  the  Bill\r\n\r\nGates?  Tell me, where are the Jeff Bezos, where are  the\r\n\r\nDells,  where are the Intels, where are the HPs?  You  do\r\n\r\nnot   find  them.   None.   They  are  not  there.    The\r\n\r\ngatekeepers  of Hong Kong are really small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nThey are the unsung heroes of the economy, but the people\r\n\r\nunderpinning  them  are just a few  big  tycoon-dominated\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will not find a Bill Gates in Hong Kong, but you\r\n\r\nwill  find a Mr Li Ka Shing.  Hongkongers love  him,  and\r\n\r\nthey  call him \"Superman\", chiu yan (in Cantonese).  Chiu\r\n\r\nyan  means  Superman.  Mr Li's hold  on  the  economy  is\r\n\r\nformidable.   His two companies - Hutchinson Whampoa  and\r\n\r\nCheung  Kong  - dominate the economy of Hong  Kong.   But\r\n\r\nunlike  some  of  our CEOs of GLCs,  Mr  Li  is  revered,\r\n\r\nrespected and worshipped.  Here, Singaporeans blame  TLCs\r\n\r\nfor being too big and crowding out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   But, think again, Mr Li is  held  up  as  a\r\n\r\nmodel  entrepreneur  in Hong Kong even  as  his  eclectic\r\n\r\nempire  grows.  Some people are saying in Hong Kong  that\r\n\r\nhe  is  also  crowding out entrepreneurs.   But,  by  and\r\n\r\nlarge, this is a voice from the minority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Li is a hero in Hong Kong and not a villain. He\r\n\r\nprovides  jobs, thousands of jobs, for Hongkongers.   And\r\n\r\nHongkongers  believe in Mr Li.  In  fact,  Hong  Kong  is\r\n\r\nworried  every now and then that he might just  move  his\r\n\r\nHutchinson Whampoa and Cheung Kong offshore.   Each  time\r\n\r\nHongkongers feel that he might be doing so, he  came  out\r\n\r\nto reassure them.  But our TLCs have never said they want\r\n\r\nto  move  overseas.  Our TLCs have said they want  to  go\r\n\r\noverseas  to do business and bring the money  back.   The\r\n\r\nquestion  of  TLCs rooting themselves with the  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy  and providing jobs for Singapore has never  been\r\n\r\nan  issue here, which I am glad.  The issue of Hutchinson\r\n\r\nWhampoa  moving  overseas has always  been  rumoured  and\r\n\r\nalways dispelled by Mr Li himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mr Li, although he is a superman, is not\r\n\r\ninfallible.   His company has made some  less  than  good\r\n\r\ninvestments.   Or even today, Hutchinson Whampoa's  share\r\n\r\nhas  been hammered from the high.  Before the year  2000,\r\n\r\nit  was  something like HK$120 per share.  Today,  it  is\r\n\r\nsomething  like  HK$60.  I do not know  the  rate  today.\r\n\r\nBut, last week, I saw it was hovering below HK$60.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980s, Mr Li's investment in a Canadian oil\r\n\r\ncompany did not live up to market expectations.  It under-performed for many years.  Mr Li's investment in  Rabbit,\r\n\r\nif  you  remember, a telephony company  in  Britain,  was\r\n\r\nanother  flop,  a failure.  But few remember  his  failed\r\n\r\ninvestments.  We all remember his successes,  and  so  it\r\n\r\nshould be, because he is a very successful businessman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This example brings me to a second message which I\r\n\r\nwant to bring home - that Singaporeans should be a little\r\n\r\nbit  more  forgiving, if some of our TLCs have made  some\r\n\r\nbad  investments  in  the  short  term.   Even  a  highly\r\n\r\nsuccessful company,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlike   Hutchinson  Whampoa,  has  made  bad  investments.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, in fact, should be worried if our TLCs make\r\n\r\nno investments and think short term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a third point in my comparison, and this is\r\n\r\nnot  a major point I want to make, but I thought this  is\r\n\r\nthe  mood  of  the day, and I would say it.  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare having so much angst over foreign talent policy.   If\r\n\r\nTLCs  were  dismantled, for example, who do we  sell  to?\r\n\r\nWell, possibly sell them to some foreign investors maybe,\r\n\r\nwho  have the money and the interest.  If so, there  will\r\n\r\nbe a lot more foreign talents in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Hong Kong and China regard Mr Li as a patriot,\r\n\r\nbut  Mr  Li  did  not  grow his stable  of  companies  by\r\n\r\nemploying  Chinese and Hongkongers for a long time.   For\r\n\r\nas  long as I can remember, Mr Li has always had a policy\r\n\r\nof  hiring  the best, and his most senior management  are\r\n\r\nforeign  talents, and foreign talents I mean  Caucasians.\r\n\r\nIn  Hong Kong, they say kwai lao.  Here, in Singapore, we\r\n\r\nhave  a  few  foreign talents in GLCs, TLCs, and  already\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are feeling the heat.  Actually,  we  should\r\n\r\nhave  more.   Because  if  you want  TLCs  to  be  global\r\n\r\ncompanies  of distinction, we really need to harvest  the\r\n\r\nbest from around the world.  So I asked those people  who\r\n\r\nare  lobbying for the dismantling of TLCs, are  you  sure\r\n\r\nyou want to dismantle TLCs?  Because, you know, what they\r\n\r\nsay, be careful of what you wish, you might just get it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have put into perspective a world without\r\n\r\nTLCs.   Still, I think it is right that Temasek  Holdings\r\n\r\nis  determined to sell some TLCs even if it wants to grow\r\n\r\nothers,  find partners for others and merge others.   But\r\n\r\nwe  are  reassured, through the Temasek Charter, and  the\r\n\r\nstatements in the press, that there will be no fire sale.\r\n\r\nWe  are  not going to sell.  We should not sell the  TLCs\r\n\r\nfor a song.  Our national assets are not for lelong.  And\r\n\r\nthis brings me to my last point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management of Temasek Holdings has come up with\r\n\r\na  Temasek Charter.  At the top of its Charter, it  says,\r\n\r\n\"Temasek Holdings holds and manages the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore Government's investments in companies  for  the\r\n\r\nlong  term  benefit  of Singapore.\"   I  find  this  most\r\n\r\nreassuring.  How many companies can put up that  kind  of\r\n\r\nmission  statement?  The Temasek Charter makes  it  clear\r\n\r\nfrom  the very outset that every Singaporean has a  stake\r\n\r\nin  Temasek even if we do not hold a single share in  any\r\n\r\nof  the  Temasek-linked companies.  I think we should  be\r\n\r\nproud  of  Temasek.  Temasek really is our  future.   Our\r\n\r\nSMEs,   our   small   mom  and  pop  shops   do   deserve\r\n\r\nencouragement.  They should be encouraged  to  grow.   We\r\n\r\nshould  level the playing field.  But they are unable  to\r\n\r\nreach  out and anchor to the big powers, the big  players\r\n\r\nin the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were young, we all know this refrain in\r\n\r\nessay.   The teacher always says, \"Singapore is  a  small\r\n\r\nisland  with limited resources.\"  I think, today, we  can\r\n\r\ntell the teacher to tell Singaporeans that \"Singapore  is\r\n\r\na  small island with Temasek\".  If Temasek is our future,\r\n\r\nwe  should  chart  its  future together.   And  for  this\r\n\r\nreason,  I really welcome this debate on Temasek  Charter\r\n\r\nin  this House moved by Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh.   In some ways, I agree with them.  For too  long,\r\n\r\nTemasek has been a passive holding company.  Its mode  of\r\n\r\noperation  and  its mission were a little bit  opaque,  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit  over  our head.  I hope that  it  is  slowly\r\n\r\nchanging.   I  think  it  is  changing.   And  this   new\r\n\r\nmanagement is a catalyst for change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a dream that one day Temasek will be a\r\n\r\nGeneral Electric with a diversified stable of businesses,\r\n\r\neach  of which is a world or, at least, a regional  brand\r\n\r\nname.   It will take Temasek decades to reach this  goal.\r\n\r\nIt  took Jack Welch a good 20 to 30 years to finalise the\r\n\r\nshape of General Electric that we know today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly some companies should be divested; some\r\n\r\nmerged;  some  acquired, but that is  best  left  to  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  Temasek.  But reading the Charter,  I  am\r\n\r\nconfident  that Temasek management has the ambitions  and\r\n\r\ndetermination to succeed.  With this Charter, Temasek  is\r\n\r\nreally  chartering into uncharted waters,  because  there\r\n\r\nare no MBA case studies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Temasek  to  emulate and analyse.  Temasek  Holdings\r\n\r\nwill  have to write its own MBA case study, for  somebody\r\n\r\nelse  to study in the decades to come.  In time, we  will\r\n\r\nknow  how  Temasek has remained faithful to the  Charter,\r\n\r\nhow it has linked the future to Singapore, and how it has\r\n\r\nperformed  against its own benchmark.   I  think  today's\r\n\r\ndebate  is useful.  We should revisit this debate in  the\r\n\r\nnext few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mdm Deputy Speaker, before I end, I hope I have\r\n\r\ntime  to  talk about the NTUC-linked companies.  Actually\r\n\r\nNTUC-linked  companies are not part  of  today's  Motion.\r\n\r\nNTUC-linked companies are largely formed for Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand,  in fact, NTUC-linked companies - I know it, because\r\n\r\nI  had  been  in  NTUC for sometime  now  -  were  formed\r\n\r\nprecisely  against  the Yellow Pages  rule.   The  Yellow\r\n\r\nPages  rule says that if the name is in the Yellow Pages,\r\n\r\nlet  us, say, a supermarket, it should get out.  But when\r\n\r\nFairPrice was formed, there were few supermarkets.   NTUC\r\n\r\nFairPrice  went in basically because the price  of  basic\r\n\r\ncommodities  was too high.  And NTUC went in  to  provide\r\n\r\ncompetition  against the local retailers.   The  results,\r\n\r\nafter 20-odd years, I think, prove that it has succeeded.\r\n\r\nNTUC  prices  today are among the lowest  prices  in  the\r\n\r\nretail  scene.  Not every item but, by and large, if  you\r\n\r\nlook  at a typical basket of items, NTUC has the cheapest\r\n\r\nbasket in town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC companies are not funded by Government.\r\n\r\nGovernment  does  not put money into NTUC.   NTUC's  seed\r\n\r\ncapital  comes from all of us.  It is a cooperative,  and\r\n\r\nthe  money comes from small timers like you and I who buy\r\n\r\nshares, $1 a share, over the last many years.  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsure  if we divest, let us say, FairPrice, we will  quell\r\n\r\nthe  public  discontent.  If FairPrice were to  be  sold,\r\n\r\nsold to whom?  That is the first issue.  The second issue\r\n\r\nis  the person who inherits FairPrice would want to  make\r\n\r\nit  even  bigger, and he will crowd out even  more  local\r\n\r\nretailers.  The presence of FairPrice in any new town  is\r\n\r\nwelcomed, I tell you, because it brings down the cost  of\r\n\r\nliving  in  that town.  It has what we call the  Wal-Mart\r\n\r\neffect.  Every time a Wal-Mart\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopens  up  a  big  supermarket chain  in  some  parts  of\r\n\r\nAmerica, the residents welcome it, because it lowers  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  commodities by a huge margin.  But, of  course,\r\n\r\nshopkeepers  around  the town  would  be  upset.   It  is\r\n\r\nsomething  we have to live with.  In Malaysia, they  have\r\n\r\nfound that by allowing big retail giants, like Carrefour,\r\n\r\nto  operate,  for  example,  retail  shops  went  out  of\r\n\r\nbusiness.   So unless you say that you want to limit  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of supermarket outlets, it is not going  to  help\r\n\r\neven if FairPrice were divested from the NTUC family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last word about academic advice. I have left\r\n\r\nthe  university for the last 10 years now, and of  course\r\n\r\nnot as well known as Michael Porter and all that.  Listen\r\n\r\nto  their advice, they have a lot to offer us, but please\r\n\r\nlisten  with  a  pinch of salt.  Many renowned  academics\r\n\r\nover the years, when you look back at their advice, their\r\n\r\nadvice sounded foolish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early years of independence, in the 60s, the\r\n\r\nadvice of the renowned academics around the world to  all\r\n\r\ndeveloping  countries was to close your doors,  be  self-sufficient, do what is best for you.  So many  countries,\r\n\r\nlike  India,  Malaysia, African countries,  closed  their\r\n\r\ndoors.   Singapore  went  against  the  advice  of  these\r\n\r\neminent  economists.  We opened up, we linked up  to  the\r\n\r\nworld,  we succeeded.  Because we went against the advice\r\n\r\nof the day, we succeeded.  I am not saying that we should\r\n\r\ngo  against the advice of these renowned academics.   But\r\n\r\nthink  again.  We are here, we know our business  better.\r\n\r\nWe  are  here because our destiny is here.  They  are  in\r\n\r\nBoston,  they are in London.  Their business is to  write\r\n\r\npapers,  to gain a world-wide audience, to win the  Nobel\r\n\r\nPrize.   Our duty is to provide for our future,  for  our\r\n\r\nchildren's future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Madam, I wish to thank you for\r\n\r\ngiving  me the opportunity to participate in this debate.\r\n\r\nAnd in fact, I would also like to thank the movers of the\r\n\r\nMotion,  my parliamentary colleagues, Mr Leong  Horn  Kee\r\n\r\nand Mr Inderjit Singh, for tabling this Motion.  In doing\r\n\r\nso,  I  think they have provided this House with a  great\r\n\r\nopportunity to debate on a topic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich is obviously of great interest to Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nwhich  is  also  important  for  our  future  growth  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, I have listened very carefully to the\r\n\r\ncomments and viewpoints made by the speakers before me on\r\n\r\nthis  issue.  Generally, I do not disagree that  we  must\r\n\r\nhelp  our local enterprises to develop and grow.  And  to\r\n\r\nthis  end,  we should examine existing schemes,  policies\r\n\r\nand  regulations  to  determine  whether  there  are  any\r\n\r\nimpediments standing in the way of full participation  by\r\n\r\nour   SMEs,   of  which  we  place  them  at  an   unfair\r\n\r\ndisadvantage compared to GLCs and MNCs.  In this respect,\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations  of  the EISC  should  be  seriously\r\n\r\nlooked  at  and the Government should seriously  consider\r\n\r\nimplementing useful and practical suggestions  that  will\r\n\r\nstrengthen  our  economy  and make  Singapore  even  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive globally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am all for a level playing field. But I believe\r\n\r\nthat  we should not have protectionist policies, not only\r\n\r\nfor  GLCs and MNCs, but also for our own SMEs.  As  such,\r\n\r\nprotectionism  will  not,  in the  long  term,  help  our\r\n\r\ndomestic  industries  to  be  resilient  and  to  compete\r\n\r\nglobally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, having listened to this debate, I am not sure\r\n\r\nwhether  we are identifying the issues correctly.   There\r\n\r\nis  a  tendency  to compartmentalise GLCs and  SMEs  into\r\n\r\ndifferent boxes and to assume that one can only  grow  at\r\n\r\nthe  expense  of  the other.  To me,  the  issue  is  not\r\n\r\nwhether  GLCs  should be competing  with  SMEs.   But  of\r\n\r\ngreater  significance  is  the  issue  of  how  Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies, whether they are GLCs or SMEs, can compete  in\r\n\r\na  very  competitive world economy which has become  even\r\n\r\nmore aggressive with the admission of China into the WTO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, with my colleague, Mr Nithiah Nandan, we\r\n\r\nled  the SLF model workers delegation to Shanghai and  we\r\n\r\nvisited  the Philips optical storage factory there.   The\r\n\r\nplant's General Manager, who briefed us, told us that the\r\n\r\noperating environment in China is very flexible and fast,\r\n\r\nand  there  is  good support from the  authorities.   The\r\n\r\nfactory was sited on a huge piece of land\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the huge factory took only one year to build with the\r\n\r\nworkers  working round the clock come rain or shine.   He\r\n\r\nsaid that in Europe, it would have taken two to two-and-a-half  years  to  build a similar factory.  The  education\r\n\r\nsystem,  according  to him, is good and  among  the  non-production staff, almost 90% are degree holders.  And  of\r\n\r\nthese,  15%  are PhDs.  Among the production  staff,  the\r\n\r\naverage  level  of education is at least upper  secondary\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I wish to make is that, instead of\r\n\r\ndebating  about how GLCs are crowding out local companies\r\n\r\nand  to add to that, I must add NLCs, a new term that has\r\n\r\njust  been developed today, perhaps we should concentrate\r\n\r\nmore on how GLCs, NLCs and SMEs can partner each other as\r\n\r\none  united force to compete in the international  market\r\n\r\nand to be more efficient and productive domestically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the workers' viewpoint, what is important is\r\n\r\nnot  so much whether companies operating in Singapore are\r\n\r\nGLCs,   SMEs,  or  foreign-owned.   Rather,  of   greater\r\n\r\nsignificance to us is whether such companies create jobs,\r\n\r\nincomes  and  bring in new technologies  and  skills,  in\r\n\r\nother  words, whether more jobs are created through  such\r\n\r\ninvestments and whether these are well-paid jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, it is a fact that, overall, GLCs and MNCs\r\n\r\nprovide  greater job stability to our workers  and  offer\r\n\r\nmore  attractive  terms of employment.  This  is  because\r\n\r\nthey  are generally bigger, have more resources  and  are\r\n\r\nmore professionally run.  In my view, promoting GLCs need\r\n\r\nnot  be  at  the expense of SMEs.  In fact, there  is  no\r\n\r\nguarantee  that  pulling our GLCs  from  certain  sectors\r\n\r\nwould  automatically result in a mushrooming of more  and\r\n\r\nstronger  SMEs.  What may happen, instead,  is  that  the\r\n\r\nvacuum  would  be very quickly filled up by bigger,  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive and globally-savvy foreign competitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is evident by looking at the retail sector. In\r\n\r\nThailand,  for instance, the competition comes  not  from\r\n\r\nthe  State-owned  enterprises but big foreign  retailers,\r\n\r\nsuch as Carrefour and Taxco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere  are  local companies, but they are  weak  and  not\r\n\r\ncompetitive.   In Taiwan, the supermarket  scene  is  all\r\n\r\nforeign, with Carrefour being the biggest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, let me come to another point which has been\r\n\r\nraised  by  previous speakers.  I think it is unfair  and\r\n\r\nunwise to brush the NTUC companies in the same stroke  as\r\n\r\nother  private  enterprises.  In the  first  place,  NTUC\r\n\r\ncompanies  are,  in  fact, cooperatives  set  up  by  the\r\n\r\nworkers.   The  capital for each and  every  one  of  our\r\n\r\ncooperatives comes from shareholders which are our  trade\r\n\r\nunions and individual members.  Hence, these cooperatives\r\n\r\nbelong to the unions and workers, and not the Government.\r\n\r\nWe do not receive Government funding or capital to set up\r\n\r\nany  one  of  our  cooperatives.  The  priority  of  NTUC\r\n\r\ncooperatives  must  be the ordinary  consumers,  and  the\r\n\r\n400,000  or so Singaporeans, many of whom are low  income\r\n\r\nworkers, who collectively own the cooperatives.  How many\r\n\r\nof  our  workers could afford to invest in companies  and\r\n\r\nhold  shares  on  the  same  basis  as  their  management\r\n\r\ncounterparts, or better-off Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC cooperatives will be measured by whether they\r\n\r\nhave helped to make a difference to the lives of ordinary\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Our  responsibility is  to  help  workers\r\n\r\nstretch  their  hard-earned  dollar  and  improve   their\r\n\r\nquality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, in fact, our NTUC cooperatives too face\r\n\r\nintense competition from major foreign retail chains many\r\n\r\ntimes  their size.  It also has to contend with  business\r\n\r\nalliances  by private sector players.  Since  the  1980s,\r\n\r\nfor  instance, FairPrice had to tender for sites in  open\r\n\r\ncompetition.  In new suburban malls, FairPrice would  not\r\n\r\nget  a  chance to even put in competitive bids,  as  some\r\n\r\ndevelopers  prefer  to  award the tender  to  supermarket\r\n\r\noperators  with  whom  they  had  special  relationships.\r\n\r\nResidents,  as  Prof. Koo Tsai Kee has said  earlier  on,\r\n\r\nhave  complained to their MPs when they do  not  have  an\r\n\r\nNTUC  FairPrice outlet near their home.  This is  clearly\r\n\r\nevident that people, ordinary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  average  workers,  support  the  idea   of\r\n\r\ncooperatives and find them useful and meet their needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, it is true that NTUC appoints some Government\r\n\r\nMinisters, Members of Parliament and Government  officers\r\n\r\non  the board of directors of our cooperatives.  But this\r\n\r\nis  to  enable  our  cooperatives  to  benefit  from  the\r\n\r\nexperience and expertise and, not as implied, to gain any\r\n\r\nundue  or  unfair advantage compared to other businesses.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, NTUC also appoints prominent businessmen on the\r\n\r\nboard  of  NTUC  cooperatives and  many  have,  to  their\r\n\r\ncredit,  willingly  served  on  our  boards  which   have\r\n\r\nbenefited  not only the NTUC cooperatives  but,  in  many\r\n\r\nways,  have  contributed towards a  conducive  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations climate, as such co-option of business  leaders\r\n\r\nhas  provided  the  opportunity for  business  and  union\r\n\r\nleaders to integrate and understand each other's position\r\n\r\nbetter.   The fact that many prominent businessmen  agree\r\n\r\nto  serve on our boards indicates that they too subscribe\r\n\r\nto the social objectives of NTUC cooperatives and want to\r\n\r\ncontribute towards this larger community objective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, NTUC cooperatives are truly mass movements\r\n\r\nand  we play a social role by providing real and tangible\r\n\r\nbenefits  to Singaporeans.  During good times,  the  NTUC\r\n\r\ncooperatives moderate cost increases by setting benchmark\r\n\r\nprices.   And  during bad times, they help  workers  tide\r\n\r\nover  the  difficulties, such as the 1998, 2001 and  2002\r\n\r\nrelief packages.  In fact, they collectively provided $26\r\n\r\nmillion  in  relief package in 1998 and  $52  million  in\r\n\r\nrelief  package in 2001 and 2002.  NTUC cooperatives  are\r\n\r\nnot  set up for profits alone although, in order to  stay\r\n\r\nviable,  they  have to be profitable  so  that  they  can\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  contribute to society.  Wherever  possible,\r\n\r\nNTUC  cooperatives also strive for win-win strategies  by\r\n\r\nworking  with  small businesses to help them  grow.   For\r\n\r\nexample, FairPrice and Healthcare work closely with small\r\n\r\nretailers through their franchise schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, recently, the cooperatives, such as\r\n\r\nFairPrice, Foodfare, Healthcare and Childcare, have  also\r\n\r\nannounced their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommitment to help cushion the impact of the GST increase\r\n\r\non  Singaporeans  next year.  Since 1999,  we  have  been\r\n\r\npublishing a set of social indicators together  with  our\r\n\r\nstatement  of  accounts.   This  is  an  example  of  the\r\n\r\ntransparency  requirement,  which  was  mentioned  by  Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit Singh earlier on.  Just as companies account  to\r\n\r\nshareholders  each year, in terms of equity,  we  publish\r\n\r\nsocial   indicators  to  show  that  we  are   not   just\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  but that we believe in social responsibility\r\n\r\nand  will do our part to help improve workers' lives  and\r\n\r\nensure  that  their  basic needs are met.   Although  our\r\n\r\ncooperatives   belong   to  the   workers   and   unions,\r\n\r\nshareholders  do  not profit from our  cooperatives.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  under  the Cooperative Societies Act, the  maximum\r\n\r\nrate of dividends that cooperatives can pay is capped  at\r\n\r\n10%.   This means that whatever benefit is reaped by  the\r\n\r\ncooperatives,   these  are  largely  ploughed   back   to\r\n\r\nconsumers and society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I am proud to be associated with socially\r\n\r\nresponsible  employers  who  care  not  just  for   their\r\n\r\nbottomline, but also enlarge their role to care  for  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  Cooperatives can serve as a check against the\r\n\r\nexcesses  or failures of the market.  They are  bound  by\r\n\r\ntheir  admission, values and traditions to  consider  the\r\n\r\nwider  interests of society.  Each and every  cooperative\r\n\r\nthat  the  labour movement has set up is founded  upon  a\r\n\r\nclear social objective.  For example, NTUC Income was set\r\n\r\nup  in  those days because there is no insurance  company\r\n\r\nthat  is  prepared  to  provide  low  cost,  low  premium\r\n\r\ninsurance coverage for workers.  NTUC FairPrice  was  set\r\n\r\nup  in those days because there was rampant inflation and\r\n\r\nprofiteering,  and that was eating into the  hard  earned\r\n\r\ncash  and  money  of the workers.  The  presence  of  our\r\n\r\ncooperative  movement  has  contributed  towards   social\r\n\r\nstability.   It has helped to mitigate the effects  of  a\r\n\r\nwidening wage gap as it helps to level up workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, NTUC empathises with the problems faced by\r\n\r\nsmall  retailers.  Without sufficient economies of scale,\r\n\r\nthey  will find it difficult to operate.  However, it  is\r\n\r\nunfair to place the poor prospects of small neighbourhood\r\n\r\nretail shops on the growth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   NTUC   cooperatives.   In  the   absence   of   NTUC\r\n\r\ncooperatives,  small  retailers  would  face   the   same\r\n\r\ncompetition by other big retailers, including the foreign\r\n\r\nones.   Of  the supermarkets, only Sheng Siong and  PRIME\r\n\r\nare  owned by Singaporeans.  The rest are foreign  owned.\r\n\r\nWe  do not think that dismantling NTUC cooperatives would\r\n\r\nimprove  the  position of SMEs, or that it would  promote\r\n\r\ngreater  innovation  and  entrepreneurship  among   local\r\n\r\ncompanies.  There are clearly many other factors that are\r\n\r\nat  play,  such as access to capital expertise  and  size\r\n\r\nwhich  affect the growth of our local companies  and  not\r\n\r\nbecause of the presence of NTUC cooperatives or NLCs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, someone has suggested that some\r\n\r\nof our cooperatives are too small and have little impact.\r\n\r\nIn  this  case,  is  the answer not to  grow  bigger,  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  the  clout?  But if we do so, then  we  will  be\r\n\r\naccused of crowding out the local companies.  Even so,  a\r\n\r\nsmall  player,  such as Denticare, exerts  an  influence.\r\n\r\nDenticare executives have been asked from time to time to\r\n\r\nraise  their  prices  so that other dentists  can  follow\r\n\r\nsuit.   Does  Denticare  crowd out  other  dentists?   It\r\n\r\ncannot  be  so, as the people in Denticare are themselves\r\n\r\ndentists.   If  other  dentists  wish  to  compete   with\r\n\r\nDenticare, they are free to grow together and  offer  the\r\n\r\npublic  prices lower than the table of rates set  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Dental Association.  There is nothing  to  stop\r\n\r\nthem.  And the public would applaud them, and so would I.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  I  would also go and visit them,  when  I  need\r\n\r\ndental treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, I agree with the\r\n\r\nMotion that we should examine all ways to ensure that our\r\n\r\nlocal   SMEs   stand  a  chance  and  can  benefit   from\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economic growth.  I do not  think  that  the\r\n\r\ndebate should be about either promoting GLCs or SMEs, but\r\n\r\nrather on how both can partner each other and compete  in\r\n\r\nthe  global economy.  Both have a role to play, and  they\r\n\r\ncan  certainly complement each other in order to  promote\r\n\r\nand strengthen the Singapore brand.  Most certainly, NTUC\r\n\r\ncooperatives will and must continue to play the role of a\r\n\r\nsocial leveller and guardian of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterests of the vast majority of Singaporeans  who  have\r\n\r\nbenefited from our presence in the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, the EISC\r\n\r\nReport  and  the  New Temasek Charter  are  fundamentally\r\n\r\nsound.

All these are happening in a difficult global\r\n\r\nmarket environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An array of different strategies and conditions must\r\n\r\nnow  prevail  in  order that Singaporean companies  could\r\n\r\nrise to the new challenge.  For example, local demand and\r\n\r\na challenging marketplace must develop as a source of new\r\n\r\nideas   for  product  and  service  innovations.    Other\r\n\r\nimperatives    include   companies    rethinking    their\r\n\r\ntraditional assumptions, management techniques,  business\r\n\r\nleaders  redefining their roles and their  initiative  in\r\n\r\nmoving into new territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, Singapore boasts an excellent track record in\r\n\r\nrising  to  challenges. The Government has already  taken\r\n\r\nseveral  measures to equip Singapore in this  transition.\r\n\r\nThe issues are how soon and are our companies ready?   To\r\n\r\nwhat extent is our infrastructure ready or accessible  to\r\n\r\nthe  SMEs in terms of loans, funds and network?  Are GLCs\r\n\r\ntotally  irrelevant in this new economic era? Why  should\r\n\r\nwe still be holding on to some of them?  What\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nflexible  model can we initiate as strategies  that  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to anchor our flagships?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we have built the Singapore economy into what\r\n\r\nit  is  today,  largely  through  local  talents  and  by\r\n\r\nconstantly  growing and strengthening  our  key  economic\r\n\r\ninstitutions  such as the GLCs.  GLCs and  the  assiduous\r\n\r\ncultivation of our local talents for public service  and,\r\n\r\nin  recent  years for the private sector, have  been  the\r\n\r\ncornerstones  of our economic growth.  We should  not  be\r\n\r\ntoo hasty in wanting to do away with what has worked well\r\n\r\nfor us and to adopt some other strategies which may sound\r\n\r\nfashionable but have not stood the test of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the World Bank, more than US$700\r\n\r\nbillion  in assets have been privatised around the  world\r\n\r\nin  the  last  decade,  most of which  occurred  in  what\r\n\r\neconomists  call  \"emerging  economies\".   There   is   a\r\n\r\ndefinite trend around the world towards privatisation  of\r\n\r\ngovernment-linked companies or what, in some circles,  is\r\n\r\ncalled state-owned enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale for the privatisation of these\r\n\r\nenterprises  are many and varied.  Some of  them  may  be\r\n\r\nrelevant  to the GLC situation in Singapore, others  not.\r\n\r\nBefore  we join in the rush to divest some of our prized-assets,  it  is  important for us to understand  some  of\r\n\r\nthose  reasons  that  lead some  countries  to  undertake\r\n\r\nprivatisation  of  their  GLCs.   This   will   avoid   a\r\n\r\ndoctrinaire approach to this issue of privatisation.  One\r\n\r\nof those reasons has to do with agency theory.  This says\r\n\r\nthat because GLCs belong to society as a whole, it is  an\r\n\r\nagent  without  a  real  principal.   As  a  result,  the\r\n\r\nperformance  of  these GLCs is sub-optimal  because  they\r\n\r\nhave  rather  vague  goals, as  opposed  to  the  profit-maximising goals of privately-run outfits, like the MNCs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately for Singapore, our GLCs are run on an\r\n\r\narms-length  principle, in that the Government  does  not\r\n\r\ndirectly  interfere  with the daily operations  of  these\r\n\r\ncompanies.   In  actual  fact, they  are  run  on  purely\r\n\r\ncommercial   lines.   There  are  instances   where   the\r\n\r\nGovernment may have invested money into these GLCs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor   long-term  strategic  reasons  without  seeing   an\r\n\r\nimmediate  prospect  of making quick  returns.   However,\r\n\r\nthis  does  not mean that Government ownership  of  these\r\n\r\nGLCs is not commercially-sound.  It just means that there\r\n\r\nare  instances  where the market fails to identify  long-term  opportunities which Singapore  is  well  placed  to\r\n\r\nexploit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason why privatisation has been the order\r\n\r\nof the day in many countries is because these enterprises\r\n\r\nhave  not  been competitive enough to take on world-class\r\n\r\ncompetitors   in   an   era  of  trade   and   investment\r\n\r\nliberalisation.    Is  this  situation   symptomatic   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's GLCs?  Some GLCs may need to be partially  or\r\n\r\neven  completely  privatised so  that  they  can  attract\r\n\r\nforeign  technology transfers, managerial expertise,  and\r\n\r\ncapital.  The latter will also help boost our efforts  to\r\n\r\nenlarge  the capital base of our stock exchange  and  the\r\n\r\nincrease  of  foreign portfolio investment in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there  are  GLCs  with  substantial  Government\r\n\r\nownership  which  are doing quite well already  on  their\r\n\r\nown.   Brand  names  like SIA, DBS  and  PSA  Corporation\r\n\r\nspring quickly to mind in this regard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further divest Government's holdings in these\r\n\r\ncompanies  may  not necessarily improve  the  competitive\r\n\r\nadvantage  of these enterprises.  If the Government  were\r\n\r\nto  relinquish  more control of these  enterprises,  what\r\n\r\ncompelling rationale is there to guarantee that they will\r\n\r\nbe  a  better run outfit than what is already  the  case?\r\n\r\nSIA  has  consistently been one of  the  most  profitable\r\n\r\nairlines  in the world.  PSA Corporation is likewise  one\r\n\r\nof  the  most profitable port operators in the world  and\r\n\r\nhas  sustained  Singapore  as  the  second  largest  port\r\n\r\nworldwide  in  terms  of  shipping  tonnage.   We  should\r\n\r\nendeavour  to create more PSA Corps and SIAs out  of  the\r\n\r\nmore  promising  GLCs, instead of contemplating  to  hand\r\n\r\nover  control of these companies to foreign interests  or\r\n\r\nappoint foreign proxies to run them for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we are small and vulnerable, human capital\r\n\r\nis our most precious asset, and we must continue to build\r\n\r\nup our own core of national talent to be in ultimate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharge  of our key resources and institutions.  We cannot\r\n\r\ndepend  on  nor expect foreign managers and investors  to\r\n\r\ntake  ultimate  control of our key economic  institutions\r\n\r\nand  expect them to make a living for us.  That  will  be\r\n\r\nthe end of Singapore as a sovereign nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still yet another reason why some countries join the\r\n\r\nprivatisation  mania  is  because  they  are  faced  with\r\n\r\nbalance-of-payments or fiscal crises  that  compel  their\r\n\r\ngovernments to sell off state-owned enterprises in  order\r\n\r\nto  raise  money  to  cover shortfalls  in  other  areas.\r\n\r\nSurely, this is not the case in Singapore, as we all know\r\n\r\nhow prudent our Government has been in the stewardship of\r\n\r\nour nation's reserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that we should not open up our\r\n\r\nmarket  and companies to foreign investors and expertise.\r\n\r\nTo  remain  competitive, we must continue to attract  the\r\n\r\nbest  management  and business talents  to  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nsupplement  our national talent and, if possible,  absorb\r\n\r\nthem  into  our  citizenry to enlarge our  core  national\r\n\r\ntalent pool.  We can enlarge our domestic talent pool  by\r\n\r\nmaking  Singapore  a global metropolis attractive  enough\r\n\r\nfor  foreigners  to  want  to  live  and  contribute   to\r\n\r\nSingapore's prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving up ownership and control of our key home-grown industries that are strategic to our prosperity and\r\n\r\nsurvival  as a nation is like cutting off a healthy  limb\r\n\r\nfrom  a  healthy body.  Is it then necessary or wise  for\r\n\r\nthe  Government to privatise substantially or  completely\r\n\r\nall  its GLCs?  Proponents for the divestment of our GLCs\r\n\r\nargue that GLCs present unfair competition for both local\r\n\r\nand    international   players,   given   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment's backing in these companies.  For this reason\r\n\r\nand  the perceived sensitivity that this may pose to  the\r\n\r\nnational  security of other countries, it is argued  that\r\n\r\nthe GLCs will not be welcomed in the international market\r\n\r\nplace.   Similarly, because the profit objective  of  our\r\n\r\nGLCs  may  be  compromised  by  Government's  social  and\r\n\r\npolitical   imperatives,  they   will   be   shunned   by\r\n\r\ninternational funds and investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, there is also a perception that\r\n\r\nbecause they are GLCs per se, there is a lack of will  on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of  the  Government to ensure  that  the  best\r\n\r\npossible management is in place.  But the catch  here  is\r\n\r\nthat  those  arguments  are  mostly  propagated  by   our\r\n\r\ncompetitors  and  by  pundits  who  make  a  living  from\r\n\r\nespousing trendy and esoteric management theories.   How,\r\n\r\nfor   example,  could  any  of  our  GLCs  be   seriously\r\n\r\nconsidered  to  be  competing at an unfair  advantage  in\r\n\r\nterms   of   financial   muscle  in   the   international\r\n\r\nmarketplace  merely  because  the  Government   has   the\r\n\r\ncontrolling interest, when not even one of our  GLCs  can\r\n\r\nbe found on the Fortune 500 Global List?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our GLCs should be competitive and profitable\r\n\r\nworld-class players, it is also a legitimate objective to\r\n\r\nensure that profit maximisation is not at the expense  of\r\n\r\nnational   interest.   GLCs  should  not  only   generate\r\n\r\nfinancial  gains for their shareholders, but they  should\r\n\r\nalso serve our national interests in contributing to  the\r\n\r\npeace,  prosperity and security of Singapore.   Moreover,\r\n\r\nour  GLCs  are  subject to the same rules that  apply  to\r\n\r\nothers in the international free marketplace.  Instead of\r\n\r\nbeing  defensive about Government involvement,  our  GLCs\r\n\r\nshould  robustly  rebut unfounded criticism  from  vested\r\n\r\ninterests  and stake their claims strongly as  legitimate\r\n\r\nparticipants    in   today's   increasingly    globalised\r\n\r\nmarketplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, PSA Corporation and SIA have become world-class companies in their own right, consistently\r\n\r\noutperforming many privately-controlled and managed ports\r\n\r\nand  airlines  of international stature.  The  Government\r\n\r\nneed  not  be  apologetic  about their  achievements  and\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  Singapore.   All  businesses,  without\r\n\r\nexception,  are subject to the fluctuations  of  business\r\n\r\ncycles and world economic upturns and downturns.  So, for\r\n\r\nexample, if SIA is not making a profit for the first time\r\n\r\nafter decades of sterling performance, this should not be\r\n\r\nthe reason for it, or a sizeable chunk of its equity,  to\r\n\r\nbe handed over on a silver\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplatter  to  some  seemingly  savvy  international   fund\r\n\r\nmanager.   What  assurance can  we  have  that  they  can\r\n\r\nperform  better than SIA?   By all means divest ourselves\r\n\r\nof  all  long-standing non-performing GLCs or even  close\r\n\r\nthem  down.  But for those that perform or are  strategic\r\n\r\nto  our national interests, such as in defence, it  makes\r\n\r\nlittle  sense for us to throw out the baby with the  bath\r\n\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent announcement of the PSA Corporation model\r\n\r\nof  opening up berths to foreign and private operators to\r\n\r\nmanage  on  their  own  shows a  savvy  customer  service\r\n\r\nresponse.   The  open  invitation by PSA  Corporation  to\r\n\r\nshipping companies to participate in port management  and\r\n\r\noperations  is  a clear signal of its open  and  flexible\r\n\r\napproach in striking up new alliances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine some of our assumptions underlying\r\n\r\nthe  intention to divest before proceeding to do so.   To\r\n\r\nwhat  extent must Government sell off its holdings before\r\n\r\ninvestors   are   sufficiently   assuaged   that    these\r\n\r\nenterprises are really bottom-line concerns?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another related issue that ought to be raised is\r\n\r\nthat the manner in which privatisation is carried out  is\r\n\r\njust  as  important  as  the  rationale  for  divestment.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  if  we decide on privatising some of  our  non-core,  non-strategic assets, we should do  so  gradually,\r\n\r\nand not go for a quick sell-off, especially in times like\r\n\r\nours  when the market is still soft.  To do a quick sell-off  under today's market condition is unwise for obvious\r\n\r\nreasons.  If we decide to let go of some of these assets,\r\n\r\nwe  should  do so in a staggered     manner, selling  off\r\n\r\ntranches  at those points in time when the market  is  on\r\n\r\nthe  upturn.   Studies in other countries  show  that  by\r\n\r\ngradually releasing its holdings over time, the  long-run\r\n\r\nrevenue  resulting from the sale of these shares will  be\r\n\r\nmaximised.  This is because, as investors gain confidence\r\n\r\nin the privatisation programme, the value of these shares\r\n\r\nwill  tend  to  rise.  This, in turn,  will  benefit  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I feel that instead of selling large\r\n\r\nchunks  of these holdings to foreign investors, we should\r\n\r\nsell  them to large groups of small, dispersed investors.\r\n\r\nSIA  and  SingTel  are  good cases  in  point.   In  this\r\n\r\nconnection, the rule for the disclosure of any  take-over\r\n\r\nbids  by  powerful  investors  and  fund-managers  should\r\n\r\nremain, and not be diluted further by a further reduction\r\n\r\nin  the need for the disclosure of any take-over attempt.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can consider selling off these holdings\r\n\r\nto  the  management of these firms if they  are  able  to\r\n\r\nraise sufficient funds to buy the shares on offer.   This\r\n\r\nwill  help  increase the sense of ownership  among  these\r\n\r\nmanagers,  and  it  will  also help  to  retain  critical\r\n\r\nmanagerial know-how in these firms and give our  managers\r\n\r\na chance at injecting the entrepreneurial spirit in these\r\n\r\nfirms.  The Ang Kong Hua-led proposal to buy NatSteel  is\r\n\r\na case in point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the GLCs are concerned, the Government's\r\n\r\npolicy of divesting them to the private sector when  they\r\n\r\nno  longer serve a useful strategic thrust to the economy\r\n\r\nis a correct one.  And, should the Government continue to\r\n\r\nplay  a  lead  role in identifying strategic sectors  for\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two fundamental forces at work here. One\r\n\r\nis that the Government should devolve itself from running\r\n\r\nstate  enterprises.  The  other is  that  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould take the lead in identifying key sectors that will\r\n\r\ndo well in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of these two do we want? Are we sure that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  always be spot-on to identify  areas  of\r\n\r\ngrowth  in so prescient a fashion as was the case in  the\r\n\r\npast?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to consider other ways of involving the\r\n\r\nprivate sector is a good one provided that we involve the\r\n\r\nprivate sector in a continual process of sectoral growth-identification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the Report's recommendation on having a\r\n\r\ngeneric  law  on  anti-competition is  good.   It  is  to\r\n\r\nprevent collusion, anti-competition and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  other  words,  in  so  far  as  it  pertains  to  the\r\n\r\nencouragement  of entrepreneurship and competition  among\r\n\r\nSingapore companies, it is truly commendable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can envisage potential instances where MNCs or\r\n\r\neven  subsidiaries within MNCs collude to keep price high\r\n\r\nor  merge  among themselves to corner a large segment  of\r\n\r\nthe  international market.  Do we seriously want to  keep\r\n\r\nthem  out  of  Singapore because  they  indulge  in  such\r\n\r\npractices?   What  if Singapore companies  collude  among\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  corner  a slice of  the  foreign  market?\r\n\r\nIndeed, the proposed law can prevent such instances  from\r\n\r\noccurring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, another dimension which has been mentioned by\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues is the role of statutory boards and  their\r\n\r\neffects on competition in Singapore. To reiterate, if the\r\n\r\nfunction  of statutory boards in Singapore  is  to   help\r\n\r\nprovide   an  institutional  environment  where   private\r\n\r\nbusinesses can compete on a transparent and level-playing\r\n\r\nfield,  then it stands to reason that these boards  ought\r\n\r\nnot  to be involved in the competition themselves or else\r\n\r\nthey will lose their standing as impartial guarantors  of\r\n\r\na  free  and fair regime in the various sectors they  are\r\n\r\nsupposed to be responsible for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many today are questioning the commercial\r\n\r\naspirations of spin-offs of statutory boards.  Two better\r\n\r\nknown ones in the manpower industry are the Civil Service\r\n\r\nCollege  and  the  PSB  Corp.  Consultants  and  training\r\n\r\nproviders are asking why these two entities are vying for\r\n\r\nthe  same  commercial  pie.  They are  providing  similar\r\n\r\nmanagement training and consultancy programmes to a  near\r\n\r\nsaturated market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, this runs against the original function of\r\n\r\nthe  statutory boards, thereby detracting from what  they\r\n\r\nare  supposed  to  do.   Do these spin-offs  function  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate and enable the private operators in  enhancing\r\n\r\nthe  cluster of related and supporting sectors?  If their\r\n\r\nobjectives  are  contrary to one of the  key  thrusts  in\r\n\r\ntransitioning into the innovation-driven economy, then we\r\n\r\nought to hold\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe brakes and urge a review of their directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to avoid the Government from being alluded\r\n\r\nin  competing in an unfair manner when it enters  certain\r\n\r\nsectors of the local market that should be best served by\r\n\r\nthe  private sector.  Perhaps, a charter similar  to  the\r\n\r\nNew  Temasek  Charter should be considered for  statutory\r\n\r\nboards  with  spun-off commercial set-ups.   This  is  to\r\n\r\nbetter  scope their functions and ensure that if  at  all\r\n\r\nfor  any  useful contribution, they serve to enhance  the\r\n\r\ncluster and related supporting industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, on this note, I would like to support the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the EISC to promote private enterprise\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the\r\n\r\nMotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EISC proposals and the Temasek press release are\r\n\r\ntimely and welcomed by many Singaporeans.  GLCs have been\r\n\r\na  subject  of  much debate and controversy for  sometime\r\n\r\nnow.  Among the many issues that have surfaced, there are\r\n\r\ntwo  that  have  generated  much  attention;  first,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of competition that the GLCs provide  to  local\r\n\r\nnon-GLC  enterprises  and, secondly,  and  one  which  is\r\n\r\nrelated  to  the  first, the role and management  of  the\r\n\r\nGLCs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, in this House, consistently maintained the\r\n\r\nview that GLCs, if they are worth their salt, should play\r\n\r\nan  active  role  in helping Singapore develop  a  strong\r\n\r\nexternal   economy.    A  well-established   network   of\r\n\r\nsuccessful investments and strategic acquisitions outside\r\n\r\nSingapore, particularly in areas where GLCs are  able  to\r\n\r\nleverage on for the purpose of technology transfer, would\r\n\r\nhelp  provide the platform for local industries  to  grow\r\n\r\nand  for local employment to be generated.  I agree  that\r\n\r\nGLCs   venturing  overseas  could  well   partner   local\r\n\r\nenterprises  to  help  them expand beyond  local  shores.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, where we are able to develop our external wing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuccessfully, we can afford a little inefficiency in  our\r\n\r\ndomestic  economy without having to worry too much  about\r\n\r\nexternal  competition.  Our local workers, for  instance,\r\n\r\ncan,  through some tax incentives or otherwise,  or  even\r\n\r\nindirect   subsidies,   continue   to   work   in   areas\r\n\r\ntraditionally occupied by foreign workers without  having\r\n\r\nto earn their kind of salaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we are a small country and our resources are\r\n\r\nlimited.  We need to harness every resource  we  have  to\r\n\r\nensure  our  long-term survival.  The  GLCs,  because  of\r\n\r\ntheir  larger  capital  resource, depth  and  breadth  of\r\n\r\nexperience  in various businesses and better  command  of\r\n\r\nhuman talents, are best positioned to lead the charge for\r\n\r\nSingapore  into the world economy.  The EISC  report  and\r\n\r\nthe proposed Charter by Temasek have both taken a step in\r\n\r\nthe  right  direction when it recognised that  increasing\r\n\r\nfocus  must  be  placed on divesting non-key  assets  and\r\n\r\nplacing our bets on strategic investments overseas.  I do\r\n\r\nnot  think  that anyone in this House will take exception\r\n\r\nto the stated intention contained in the documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while no one would quarrel with the clarion\r\n\r\ncall  to divest and venture overseas, the devil, as  they\r\n\r\nsay,  is in the details. There are issues and, hopefully,\r\n\r\nsome of these issues will be dealt with in the course  of\r\n\r\nthis debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as with the others, the GLCs. Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  we  all know that GLCs here serve the  specific\r\n\r\npurpose  of  not  only providing the appropriate  vehicle\r\n\r\nthat  allows Government to invest the public  funds.   It\r\n\r\nalso, and more importantly, serves as tools that allow us\r\n\r\nto  take  the  economy into strategic areas that  are  of\r\n\r\nvital  economic interest to Singapore.  It is no surprise\r\n\r\ntherefore   that  the  main  protagonists  in   financial\r\n\r\nservices,   infrastructure  and  industrial  development,\r\n\r\nutility  services  are GLCs.  GLCs that  are  engaged  in\r\n\r\nbusinesses are therefore not only driven by the necessity\r\n\r\nto ensure that they are not insolvent, but also to ensure\r\n\r\nthat the overall needs of the country are met at the same\r\n\r\ntime; which raises the question of whether GLCs ought  to\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntreated strictly as private sector companies, to be  left\r\n\r\nto  shareholders  to  decide, or  be  treated  as  hybrid\r\n\r\ncompanies which, because of the public interest that they\r\n\r\nserve, not only owe a duty to the shareholders, but  also\r\n\r\na duty of accountability to the wider public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government has in the past consistently\r\n\r\nmaintained that the strict line of accountability of  the\r\n\r\nGLCs  should be to the shareholders as these are  private\r\n\r\nsector bodies and Parliament is not the appropriate  body\r\n\r\nto undertake any oversight function.  Madam, the time has\r\n\r\nnow  come perhaps when we should review the stand  taken.\r\n\r\nOver  the years, and much to their credit, the GLCs  have\r\n\r\nsuccessfully transformed our economy and helped build  up\r\n\r\nSingapore,  as we know it today.  It is for  this  reason\r\n\r\nthat  your  typical  GLC  is not  just  your  mom-and-pop\r\n\r\nneighbourbood shop but huge conglomerates with  interests\r\n\r\nthat  span  from  healthcare  and  telecommunications  to\r\n\r\nutilities and aviation. These are companies that  command\r\n\r\nvery substantial capital resources, a large part of which\r\n\r\nis  the taxpayers' money; your money and my money.  These\r\n\r\nare  also companies that have intruded into our lives via\r\n\r\nthe  services  that they provide; that any adjustment  to\r\n\r\nthe  rates that they levy, whether it be hospital charges\r\n\r\nor  bank  charges,  will affect a very  wide  segment  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Should they therefore be in  the  private\r\n\r\ndomain  or  the public domain? Should their  concerns  be\r\n\r\nmatters which should be left entirely to the shareholders\r\n\r\nor the wider public?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, our investments for the moment\r\n\r\nare  safely watched over by Cabinet leaders or ex-Cabinet\r\n\r\nleaders  through Temasek and GIC.  We have no doubt  that\r\n\r\nthe   present  leaders  are  exercising  their   watchdog\r\n\r\nfunction  effectively.  However, one would say  that  the\r\n\r\npresent  safeguard also depends very much on the honesty,\r\n\r\nintegrity  and,  to a large extent, the trust  which  the\r\n\r\npresent leadership enjoys.  On the other hand, one  would\r\n\r\nargue  that  there is very little by way of institutional\r\n\r\nsafeguard,  which could serve as a check  against  abuses\r\n\r\nand excesses.  The question is:  who watches over the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwatchdog?  At  the  moment,  the  public  does  not  have\r\n\r\ncomplete  access  to  the  accounts  of  some  Government\r\n\r\ninvestment  companies; neither does the public  have  any\r\n\r\nknowledge of the web of companies that the GLCs control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, while I can understand the need\r\n\r\nfor   confidentiality,  the  absence  of  an  appropriate\r\n\r\ninstitution   for  independent  accountability   is   not\r\n\r\nacceptable  either.  Our entire parliamentary  system  is\r\n\r\ndedicated  to  the proposition of accountability  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to   the  people.   If   public   and   open\r\n\r\naccountability  is neither feasible nor practical  for  a\r\n\r\nvariety of reasons, I would strongly suggest and urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to consider setting up a council made  up  of\r\n\r\nprominent  Singaporeans and parliamentarians  to  perform\r\n\r\nthe task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The council may be charged by Parliament to perform\r\n\r\nthe task of providing additional comfort to the public so\r\n\r\nthat the business of Government in the private sector  is\r\n\r\nprudently managed to the highest standards. The  function\r\n\r\nof  such a council would be no different from the  Public\r\n\r\nAccounts Committee or the Audit Committee in the  context\r\n\r\nof  a  listed  company.  Additionally, if the  Government\r\n\r\nrepresents   the  interests  of  the  taxpayers   through\r\n\r\nindirect  holdings  in  these  companies,  it  should  be\r\n\r\nprepared to engage in more Parliamentary debates,  as  it\r\n\r\nhas  done in the past, on some key policies taken by  the\r\n\r\nGLCs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would suppose that ultimately, the overriding\r\n\r\nprinciple  should  be greater openness  on  the  part  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  as  far  as possible.  With  openness,  there\r\n\r\nwould   be  greater  accountability,  and  with   greater\r\n\r\naccountability,  one would minimise  the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nabuse by those on whose shoulders rest the responsibility\r\n\r\nof being the trustees of the people's assets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, performance measures of GLCs and its Board.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the performance of GLCs is partly measured  by\r\n\r\nEconomic Value-Add (EVAs).  In its application, EVAs seek\r\n\r\nto determine, as I understand it, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvalue-add  of  the  enterprise  business  activities   in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  the capital employed. This yardstick  as  a\r\n\r\nmeasure of the company provides the spurs for these  GLCs\r\n\r\nto  perform.  However, while the use of EVAs may be well-meaning,   the  application  could  perhaps  be   refined\r\n\r\nfurther.  At the moment, EVAs do not make any distinction\r\n\r\nas  to  whether the value-add to the companies came  from\r\n\r\ndomestic business or foreign business.  What is important\r\n\r\nin  the final analysis is that EVA is a reflection  based\r\n\r\non  the sum total revenue of the enterprise. As a result,\r\n\r\nthe  application is not satisfactory in its present form.\r\n\r\nGLCs,  desperate  to perform to improve its  performance,\r\n\r\nmay  well be forced to unfairly compete head-on with  the\r\n\r\nsmall  and  medium enterprises for business  or  even  to\r\n\r\nacquire them; a complaint that is commonly heard.  It  is\r\n\r\nno  wonder therefore that the roast meat business was  on\r\n\r\nthe menu for GLCs some years back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we accept the broad principle that GLCs should\r\n\r\nconcentrate  and  focus  their energies  overseas,  while\r\n\r\nleaving  the domestic economy to be substantially handled\r\n\r\nby  the small and medium enterprises, it would make  more\r\n\r\nsense if the performance index of GLCs be tweaked to take\r\n\r\ninto  account  successful investments overseas.   And  to\r\n\r\nrefine  this further, we could base the determination  of\r\n\r\nthe  EVAs of the respective GLCs on industries that these\r\n\r\nGLCs belong to.  For instance, it does not make sense  if\r\n\r\nSingTel were to go overseas to become the best food court\r\n\r\noperator.  It does not work that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings us to the next point and that is,\r\n\r\nmeasuring  the performance of the board of  GLCs.   Under\r\n\r\nthe  current proposal, the Corporate Governance Code will\r\n\r\nbe  fully  implemented in 2003 by the  listed  companies.\r\n\r\nNon-listed  companies  will be encouraged  to  adopt  the\r\n\r\nsame.   Under the Code, the Board is expected to  set  up\r\n\r\nfunctional  committees such as the  Nomination  Committee\r\n\r\nand   the   Remuneration  Committees  to  determine   the\r\n\r\nnomination  and  compensation of directors,  among  other\r\n\r\nthings.  The recent disclosure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  generous  pay-outs  to both executive  directors  and\r\n\r\ndirectors  of a union linked transportation  company  has\r\n\r\nput  the spotlight on the issue.  On what criteria should\r\n\r\ndirectors be appointed and remunerated?  Should directors\r\n\r\nof  GLCs be allowed to give themselves generous pay-outs,\r\n\r\nincluding   stock   options?   Do  Government   appointed\r\n\r\ndirectors   to  GLCs  operate  under  any  directive   or\r\n\r\nremuneration  and standards, and if so, what  formula  is\r\n\r\nthis based? Should executive directors or Chief Executive\r\n\r\nOfficers of GLCs that are non-performing be asked to go?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, in my previous speeches, said that the\r\n\r\nboards  of  GLCs must and should never be a  place  where\r\n\r\nretired  civil servants and politicians fade away.  Every\r\n\r\ndirector  who  is  appointed  to  the  boards  of   these\r\n\r\ncompanies  must be able to hold their own appointment  to\r\n\r\nthese boards.  They must be effective contributors to the\r\n\r\nbusiness of the company and not just coast along.   While\r\n\r\nTemasek  is  set about bringing out a charter  that  will\r\n\r\nguide  its  business, it will also be helpful if  Temasek\r\n\r\ncould also publish its guidelines on the appointment  and\r\n\r\nremuneration of their directors as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, our Government has always\r\n\r\nlamented  the fact that there is a dearth of talents  for\r\n\r\nthe  appointment to the boards.  It seems that every time\r\n\r\nan  appointment is considered, the usual list of suspects\r\n\r\nis  taken out and reviewed.  It does not seem as  if  all\r\n\r\nGovernment  appointed directors have  limited  tenure  of\r\n\r\nappointment or are replaced by other younger and  equally\r\n\r\ncapable persons who may well be qualified to do the  job.\r\n\r\nIf  the policy on Permanent Secretaries is to limit their\r\n\r\nterm  of  office, the Government should perhaps  consider\r\n\r\nsuch  a  similar policy in respect of appointment of  GLC\r\n\r\ndirectors.   Similarly, when executive appointments  have\r\n\r\nbeen extended to foreigners, although many, I understand,\r\n\r\nare  presently  resigning as fast as they are  appointed,\r\n\r\nGLCs   should   perhaps,  in  their  internationalisation\r\n\r\nefforts,  consider appointing more experienced foreigners\r\n\r\nto  their  boards, or to an international advisory  panel\r\n\r\nset  up  for the purpose of advising the board.   Such  a\r\n\r\npolicy, Madam,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  give the Government the benefit of adding  breadth\r\n\r\nand  depth to the experience and expertise of the  boards\r\n\r\nof GLCs.  And I am sure such appointments do not cause as\r\n\r\nmuch   rift  and  resentment  in  our  society   as   the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  foreigners to executive offices  of  our\r\n\r\nGLCs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, divestment of GLCs. The Temasek Charter, as\r\n\r\nwe note, sets out the basic principle that our Government\r\n\r\nintends to divest investments that are non-core business,\r\n\r\nin  the  sense  that I understand it, it  does  not  have\r\n\r\ninternational growth potential.  Such a move is  welcomed\r\n\r\nas  it  dovetails  into the broader plan of  successfully\r\n\r\ncreating an external wing for our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in as much as the intention is easy to\r\n\r\nspell out, the role to implementing it is not.  First, we\r\n\r\nare  not  told how businesses are going to be  classified\r\n\r\ninto  whether  or  not  they  have  international  growth\r\n\r\npotential.   Let me take a simple example of a  fish-ball\r\n\r\nbusiness.  I  believe that Temasek has already  expressed\r\n\r\nthe  view  that if it is the business of fish ball  soup,\r\n\r\nthen  they  are  not  interested.  One would  immediately\r\n\r\nrecognise the practical difficulty of going through  such\r\n\r\na classification exercise.  While the person selling fish\r\n\r\nball  soup  may  not, at first glance, seem  like  a  hot\r\n\r\ncandidate for a world-class business, who is to  say  the\r\n\r\nfish  ball seller does not have the potential if his fish\r\n\r\nballs  are  the  best in the world,  and  that  he  could\r\n\r\npotentially be a world-class supplier of fish  balls  and\r\n\r\nrelated  products.  Maybe fish balls are  too  remote  an\r\n\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To use a more familiar example, Breadtalk. One\r\n\r\nwould  have  to admit that, at first blush, it  does  not\r\n\r\nseem  likely that a bakery is in a position to put itself\r\n\r\nin a list of companies that Singapore can hold out to the\r\n\r\nworld  as successful examples of entrepreneurship.   Yet,\r\n\r\nBreadtalk, and Dr George Quek in particular, is  able  to\r\n\r\novercome the initial prejudices and is in the process  of\r\n\r\ndeveloping  a  brand  name that is  not  only  recognised\r\n\r\nlocally but in the region itself.  And to its credit,  it\r\n\r\nhas  just won an SME award recently as being a well-known\r\n\r\nbrand name in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, who is to say that Breadtalk does not have\r\n\r\nthe  potential  to  grow  its  business  internationally?\r\n\r\nWould  McDonald's  not qualify as an international  brand\r\n\r\nname?   If  GLCs were to a priori classify business  with\r\n\r\npotential,  it  would  be  in no  different  position  of\r\n\r\npossibly throwing the baby out with the bath water.  I am\r\n\r\nconcerned that by openly expressing their preference  for\r\n\r\ncertain types of businesses, the officers of the GLCs  at\r\n\r\nthe lower level may have inadvertently turned a blind eye\r\n\r\nto some businesses with very good overseas potential, and\r\n\r\nthis  may  have  the  negative  effect  of  stifling  the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship potential or initiative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to a more serious issue, I note that the\r\n\r\nGovernment is intent on selling or divesting of  business\r\n\r\nthat does not fit into its present overall game plan.   I\r\n\r\nam  grateful  to  learn from Prof. Koo earlier  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, in its desire to divest, is not about to do a\r\n\r\nfire sale of its assets.  This certainly would not be  in\r\n\r\nour  interest.  We must remember that some of these  non-core   assets  are  precious  jewels  no  less   in   our\r\n\r\ncollection,  even  if they are up for  sale.   There  are\r\n\r\nseveral methods of disposing and valuing assets.  I shall\r\n\r\nnot   delay   our  colleagues  here  with  the  different\r\n\r\ntechniques,  save  to say that in any sale  and  purchase\r\n\r\nsituation,  valuation of assets on a  willing  buyer  and\r\n\r\nwilling seller basis is never easy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall just name one example. The subject of\r\n\r\nmanagement  buy-outs  featured very prominently  recently\r\n\r\nwhen Temasek decided to put NatSteel up for sale.  In  an\r\n\r\nMBO situation, what is clear is that the information flow\r\n\r\nbetween  the  management  and the  shareholder  is  never\r\n\r\nsymmetrical; in other words, it is asymmetrical.  What it\r\n\r\nmeans  is that the knowledge of the value of the  company\r\n\r\nis  not  shared equally between the shareholder  and  the\r\n\r\nmanagers.  Logically, it can never be, as who, other than\r\n\r\nthe managers who are engaged in the day-to-day running of\r\n\r\nthe  company, are better acquainted with the business and\r\n\r\nthe  value of the company.  In an MBO, any price that the\r\n\r\nmanagers put to the shareholders will always result in  a\r\n\r\nnet gain for them.  It can never be that, in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncase   where  the  company  is  on  the  whole  generally\r\n\r\nprofitable, the managers are prepared to risk  more  than\r\n\r\n$300  million  of their own money on a  gamble.   In  the\r\n\r\npresent  context,  it  is arguable  that  risk  money  is\r\n\r\ndirectly   proportional  to  the  returns  and  inversely\r\n\r\nproportional to the risk that they assume.  The  question\r\n\r\nthen is, if the managers are going to make money from the\r\n\r\nexercise,  how  much will it be?  At best, the  potential\r\n\r\nvalue of the company can only be an estimate.  Of course,\r\n\r\nit  has  been said that tenders were called for  and  the\r\n\r\nproposals  of  the  various  interested  were  evaluated.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it should be noted that price fixing in  buying\r\n\r\nand  selling  is  almost as much of an art  as  it  is  a\r\n\r\nscience.   What parties would typically do  in  order  to\r\n\r\nascertain  the value of the company is to conduct  a  due\r\n\r\ndiligence exercise on the company to verify the  accounts\r\n\r\nand   the   corporate  books.   Again,  anyone  who   has\r\n\r\nundertaken  work in the area of mergers and  acquisitions\r\n\r\nwill readily tell you that no amount of due diligence  is\r\n\r\ngoing to put an outside party on par with the managers in\r\n\r\nknowing  and understanding the true value of the company.\r\n\r\nSo,  the  point is while a tender may be called  for,  it\r\n\r\nwill  not  always  result in the seller ascertaining  the\r\n\r\ncorrect value of the company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is therefore a general perception that the\r\n\r\nsale  of  Government assets, in this case, if it went  to\r\n\r\nthe  managers,  is  going to make some Singaporeans  very\r\n\r\nrich.    The   greatest  travesty   on   enterprise   and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship will come if the managers  are  able  to\r\n\r\nasset strip the company for a handsome profit after  they\r\n\r\nhave  acquired it from the Government.  The question then\r\n\r\nis  in  selling  State assets to the  managers,  can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  provide the assurance that these buyers  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  with  the  business and  give  comfort  to  the\r\n\r\nemployees that their jobs will be secure; that the buyers\r\n\r\nwill not asset strip the company; that if asset stripping\r\n\r\nwas the intention, a better way to do it would be for the\r\n\r\nGovernment to do it itself; that the sale to the managers\r\n\r\nis the best way to maximise the value of these assets?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, while the Government is\r\n\r\nintent on divesting non-core assets, it should not do  so\r\n\r\nin  a  hurry and, in the process, run the risk of selling\r\n\r\nthese assets on the cheap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final point is on the small and medium\r\n\r\nenterprises in Singapore.  The complaint that  one  often\r\n\r\nhears  within some circles, and was referred to  in  this\r\n\r\nafternoon's debate, is that the presence of GLCs  stifles\r\n\r\nmuch of the ability of the SMEs to compete and grow their\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   While  there may  be  some  merits  to  the\r\n\r\nargument,  one must not forget the converse side  to  the\r\n\r\nargument,  ie,  the entry of the GLCs to  their  business\r\n\r\nturfs has helped to raise the standard and quality of the\r\n\r\nbusiness  services.  Think of what the quality  of  motor\r\n\r\nworkshops  would be like today if a GLC had  not  entered\r\n\r\ninto the same arena.  Small and medium enterprises should\r\n\r\nnot  think that it is their God given right not to expect\r\n\r\ncompetition  from  the bigger boys.  In  this  debate,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the issue is not whether GLCs should enter  into\r\n\r\nthe  business of small and medium enterprises.   For,  if\r\n\r\nthis  was  the case, the absence of GLCs is not going  to\r\n\r\nprevent  other bigger boys from entering the scene.   The\r\n\r\nissue  is  whether the bigger boys, and in this case  the\r\n\r\nGLCs, are able to dominate the business of the small  and\r\n\r\nmedium  enterprise simply because of unfair  competition.\r\n\r\nAre  the  rules  and the practices of  the  market  place\r\n\r\nstacked  in  favour  of the GLCs?  Here,  I  welcome  the\r\n\r\nproposal  of the EISC that there should be some  form  of\r\n\r\ncompetition  law to ensure that the playing  field  is  a\r\n\r\nlevel  one, irrespective of whether you are a  big  or  a\r\n\r\nsmall  player.   The point is that the small  and  medium\r\n\r\nenterprises  should  not  expect  free  rides  from   any\r\n\r\nquarters.  They must earn their spurs by competing in the\r\n\r\nmarket  place  and survive.  Only then can they  hope  to\r\n\r\nnurture  any  aspiration of competing on a  bigger  world\r\n\r\nstage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, the\r\n\r\neffectiveness of Government-linked companies  (GLCs)  and\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies in driving the economic  development\r\n\r\nof  Singapore since independence is undeniable.  A report\r\n\r\nby the US Embassy in Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecognised  Singapore GLCs to be well run, efficient  and\r\n\r\nprofitable,  unlike  typical state-owned  enterprises  in\r\n\r\nmany  other  countries.   It also acknowledged  that  the\r\n\r\nmajor  GLCs, including Singapore Airlines, Neptune Orient\r\n\r\nLines,  Chartered Semiconductor, Keppel  Corporation  and\r\n\r\nSembawang  Corporation are publicly listed and among  the\r\n\r\nbest known corporate names locally and regionally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, we should be proud of our GLCs and\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies which contributed about 13%  and  9%\r\n\r\nrespectively  to  our  Gross Domestic  Product  in  1998.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  very  success of the GLCs  and  Government\r\n\r\nenterprises has reached a point where private enterprises\r\n\r\nfeel  crowded  out of local businesses  and  has  sparked\r\n\r\ncalls  for  a  refocus  of  the  role  of  Government  in\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An open and competitive economy like Singapore will\r\n\r\nneed to have rules to curb excessive economic power being\r\n\r\nconcentrated  in  and  wielded by any  particular  group,\r\n\r\nthereby  resulting in inequitable conditions and stifling\r\n\r\nof competition and choice.  A spread of economic clout is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  ensure a balanced, healthy  and  sustained\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  the  economy.  It is  thus  timely  that  the\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurship  and Internationalisation  Sub-Committee\r\n\r\n(EISC)  has  made several recommendations  that  seek  to\r\n\r\npromote   a   level  playing  field  and   provide   fair\r\n\r\ncompetition  and fair opportunities for all  enterprises,\r\n\r\nbig  and  small,  Government  and  private,  to  succeed.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Temasek Holdings'  declaration of its  Charter\r\n\r\nis  a  positive  move  that provides better  clarity  and\r\n\r\ntransparency in Government philosophies and dealings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, my vision and hope is that, over time, we\r\n\r\nwill create an open, competitive economic environment:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) where GLCs and SMEs will work closely together\r\n\r\nand   symbiotically  to  build  a  vibrant  and  thriving\r\n\r\neconomy,  both domestically as well as externally,  where\r\n\r\neach has a stake and each plays a complementary role, and\r\n\r\nwhere one is comfortable dealing with the other,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause of mutual trust, understanding and respect;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) where GLCs understand and focus on their core\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  strengths  and  competencies  and  tap   on,\r\n\r\npartner,  groom  and nurture SMEs to  break  new  ground,\r\n\r\ndevelop  innovative  ideas and technologies  and  venture\r\n\r\ninto new businesses, markets and customers together;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) where the distinction between GLCs and local\r\n\r\nenterprises  become increasingly blurred, as these  terms\r\n\r\nbecome  interchangeable when GLCs get divested,  publicly\r\n\r\nlisted or bought out by management or private equity, and\r\n\r\nbudding  local  enterprises  and  start-ups  form   joint\r\n\r\nventures  with  GLCs or get acquired  by  GLCs,  groomed,\r\n\r\nnurtured and get spun off again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, based on the comments and anecdotal stories\r\n\r\ntold by local private business people of their encounters\r\n\r\nwith  GLCs  and Government agencies, I fear that  we  are\r\n\r\nstill a long way from reaching and achieving such a happy\r\n\r\nstate of coexistence.  I sense that there may be a divide\r\n\r\nbetween  the  management of GLCs who pride themselves  in\r\n\r\nhaving  a  strong  culture,  good  corporate  governance,\r\n\r\ntransparencies and checks and controls, and the bosses of\r\n\r\nSMEs  who  feel  proud being brash,  daring,  nimble  and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial.  A lot more needs to be done and must be\r\n\r\ndone  to  bridge the divide.  Otherwise, the divide  will\r\n\r\nwiden  into  a  gulf  filled  with  misunderstanding  and\r\n\r\ndistrust, where each side refuses to work with the  other\r\n\r\nnor  share information or resources and prefers  to  work\r\n\r\nwith  its  own kind, or simply goes its own way and  does\r\n\r\nits  own things.  This is divisive.  We will not  have  a\r\n\r\ncohesive front to tackle our economic challenges.  On the\r\n\r\nwhole,  we will end up the poorer for it.  More needs  to\r\n\r\nbe  done for GLCs to actively engage SMEs and gain  their\r\n\r\ntrust, and for SMEs to improve and upgrade to secure  the\r\n\r\nconfidence of the GLCs that they are up to the  mark  and\r\n\r\nwill be able to deliver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the situation existing today? Today, more\r\n\r\nso  than  ever  before,  I find that  our  local  private\r\n\r\nenterprises are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfearful of the competition coming from not just the  GLCs\r\n\r\nbut corporatised Government agencies and larger companies\r\n\r\nas the domestic market place becomes increasingly crowded\r\n\r\nand  keenly competitive.  The common complaint is centred\r\n\r\non having an unlevel playing field and being crowded out.\r\n\r\nOur  smaller  local  companies find it  hard  to  compete\r\n\r\nagainst the GLCs who have, over the years, as a result of\r\n\r\nfinancial prudence, sound management and proper controls,\r\n\r\ngrown  even stronger, leaner, hungrier and better managed\r\n\r\nthan ever before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that at the millennium conference held a\r\n\r\ncouple  of  years back, when asked by a member  from  the\r\n\r\naudience about competition from GLCs,  Senior Minister of\r\n\r\nState Khaw Boon Wan, who was then Permanent Secretary  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Trade and Industry, replied, \"We put good\r\n\r\nmen to run our GLCs well.  If a GLC does not perform,  we\r\n\r\nchange  the  man.\"   I think that sent  chills  down  the\r\n\r\nspines of many of the private sector bosses present then.\r\n\r\nBut  having  well-managed  and competitive  GLCs  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily a bad thing.  Our GLCs are not necessarily  a\r\n\r\nbad   thing   to  building  internationally   competitive\r\n\r\nSingapore companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was mentioned that, in the past, we did not have\r\n\r\nsufficient private capital to fund the likes of  SIA  and\r\n\r\nNOL,  and  therefore the Government had  to  step  in  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the  necessary funding.   And  that  times  have\r\n\r\nchanged  and  therefore  the  Government  should  not  be\r\n\r\ninvolved in business nowadays, and should leave it to the\r\n\r\nprivate sector.  But if we think about that, even  today,\r\n\r\nif  we see the future is in wafer fabrication, which non-Government  related industrial conglomerate can  come  up\r\n\r\nwith the money to take up a meaningful equity stake in  a\r\n\r\nbillion  dollar  wafer  fab plant?   Can  our  wafer  fab\r\n\r\ninitiative be left totally to the private sector?  And if\r\n\r\nnot for the group of Hong Kong investors SM persuaded  to\r\n\r\ninvest  in  the Suntec City, which local group  would  be\r\n\r\ndaring  enough to invest in a Convention Centre the  size\r\n\r\nof Suntec City at that time?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I think the Government and the Government-linked companies continue to have an important role to\r\n\r\nplay  even  today,  to  build  world-class  international\r\n\r\ncompanies.   If, for example, there is good business in a\r\n\r\nparticular  area, should we identify a GLC,  promote  it,\r\n\r\nmanage  it  properly, so that it grows to be  substantial\r\n\r\nenough  to compete with the best in the world,  and  then\r\n\r\nlater  divest it?  Or should we promote a private  sector\r\n\r\ncompany  instead?  There is no one common  strategy  that\r\n\r\nfits   across  the  broad  range  of  industries.    Some\r\n\r\nindustries, like wafer fab, port management and airlines,\r\n\r\nmust  at  least for now be left to the GLCs or  statutory\r\n\r\nboards.  Others like pastries, security systems and trade\r\n\r\ndirectories should clearly be left to private enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe  question is, where and how they should  be  involved\r\n\r\nand   still   allow  room  for  creativity  and   private\r\n\r\nenterprise  and  entrepreneurship to flourish?   And  the\r\n\r\nobjectives  and rules must be clearly spelt  out  and  be\r\n\r\nmade  transparent, and certain anti-competitive practices\r\n\r\nmust not be condoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, Mr Ahmad Magad, will tell you that a\r\n\r\nfew  years  ago when he was planning to set up a  factory\r\n\r\nfor  his  company  in  the Suzhou  Industrial  Park,  the\r\n\r\nauthority  that issues the construction permit hinted  to\r\n\r\nhim  that  if he were to use a related design  house  and\r\n\r\ncontractor,  the permit would be issued in  a  matter  of\r\n\r\ndays.   But if he were to choose to use his own  designer\r\n\r\nand contractor, then the permit may take much longer, and\r\n\r\neven  months, before it is issued.  It seems that in  our\r\n\r\nregionalisation  drive  and software  transfer  to  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  some of such bad practices have been  brought\r\n\r\nback  into  Singapore  and have  slowly  crept  into  our\r\n\r\nbusiness environment.  This is not rampant as yet, but  I\r\n\r\nthink  a  larger  company  can  quite  easily  say  to  a\r\n\r\nsupplier,  \"If you want this business from us,  then  you\r\n\r\nmust also use our sister company for other services.\"  We\r\n\r\nmust  not allow this practice to develop and must nip  it\r\n\r\nin the bud.  This is beginning to happen in some sectors,\r\n\r\nand I hope that we will take the initiative and take firm\r\n\r\naction to nip it in the bud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a case can be made out on why the continued\r\n\r\npresence  of  GLCs is necessary, it is very difficult  to\r\n\r\nconvince the public and rationalise why statutory  boards\r\n\r\nare  now  entering  the  market to compete  with  private\r\n\r\nenterprises.    With  the  move  towards   privatisation,\r\n\r\nliberalisation  and  deregulation,  the  Government  must\r\n\r\nmaintain a neutral position in order to be effective as a\r\n\r\nregulator  and  national agency.  Is it  not  incongruous\r\n\r\nthat  SPRING  Singapore which spearheads SME  development\r\n\r\nand  upgrading owns two subsidiaries (PSB Corporation and\r\n\r\nPSB  Certification) that compete with the private sector?\r\n\r\nThese  two  entities operate as commercial  organisations\r\n\r\noffering  training, consultancy, technology  and  testing\r\n\r\nservices  and  certification, leading  to  complaints  of\r\n\r\nunfair advantage that these subsidiaries have against the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector consultants.  Is there a  real  need  for\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards to form companies for them  to  achieve\r\n\r\nits  mission?   A*STAR,  the new name  for  the  National\r\n\r\nScience and Technology Board, formed Exploit Technologies\r\n\r\nPrivate  Limited,  which the Agency  has  termed  as  its\r\n\r\ncommercialisation  arm.  Should  CISCO,  as  a  statutory\r\n\r\nboard,  venture beyond its armed protection  services  to\r\n\r\ncompete  head on with the private sector to  sell  alarms\r\n\r\nand security systems, services and facilities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, what local SMEs greatly need is to have GLCs\r\n\r\nhelp  open  doors for them, particularly  overseas.   The\r\n\r\nGLCs  have  the  advantage of brand reputation,  network,\r\n\r\ncontacts,  connections and deep pockets.   The  SMEs  are\r\n\r\nlooking  for  a small piece of the action.  The  feedback\r\n\r\nfrom  private bosses is that GLCs want to bao chek,  that\r\n\r\nmeans  to take all, and bao yian, that means to win  all.\r\n\r\nIf  they  learn  a  good idea from the SMEs,  instead  of\r\n\r\nworking with the SMEs, they would take the idea and do it\r\n\r\nthemselves.  GLCs should work hard to dispel and  correct\r\n\r\nthis misconception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, local businessmen have told me\r\n\r\nthat  the MNCs are more open to tapping the local support\r\n\r\nindustries and outsourcing non-core activities  to  them.\r\n\r\nTake Hewlett Packard, for example.  Throughout the years,\r\n\r\nit has certainly provided many opportunities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  our local businessmen in the electronic manufacturing\r\n\r\nservices  and support industry, and given them a  crucial\r\n\r\nleg up to help them start on their way to becoming world-class companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not until recent times, when market consolidation\r\n\r\npushes GLCs to focus on their core businesses, GLCs  were\r\n\r\naiming  to  be conglomerates, growing and expanding  into\r\n\r\nall kinds of businesses with no regard to their strategic\r\n\r\nrelevance.   GLCs can gain in harnessing  the  creativity\r\n\r\nand  entrepreneurship initiative of the local enterprises\r\n\r\nby  partnering  them  in developing solutions  that  have\r\n\r\nmarket  potential.  It can be a win-win  proposition  for\r\n\r\nboth  the SMEs and GLCs as a partnership of complementary\r\n\r\nstrength  can be forged.  Many of the budding  technology\r\n\r\ncompanies lack the opportunity to build a track record to\r\n\r\ncommercialise  their solutions.  GLCs and Government  can\r\n\r\nprovide   the  test  bed  for  the  solutions   to   gain\r\n\r\nrecognition.  Some of these companies are even willing to\r\n\r\nforgo commercial gains to build up their track record  or\r\n\r\neven offer options for the companies to take up stakes in\r\n\r\nthese companies.  But not many got any headway as most of\r\n\r\nthe  GLCs  and  Government agencies prefer  to  take  the\r\n\r\noption  of  DIY  (do-it-yourself) or use  the  tried  and\r\n\r\ntested.   If  major  corporations  of  Singapore  do  not\r\n\r\nsupport  the  SMEs, how can we expect  them  to  convince\r\n\r\npotential overseas buyers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has various grants and financial\r\n\r\nassistance  schemes in place to foster  innovation.   But\r\n\r\nwhat  is lacking is the creation of an environment  where\r\n\r\nlocal enterprises can easily find opportunities to deploy\r\n\r\ntheir  solutions. Developing project or client references\r\n\r\nis important.  It is also through larger scale deployment\r\n\r\nand commercialisation that the innovative solution can be\r\n\r\ntested   for   its  robustness  and  effectiveness,   and\r\n\r\nstimulate continuing improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, local business associations' response to the\r\n\r\nSME  21  has been lukewarm.  The feeling is that  SME  21\r\n\r\nwill  follow  the  fate  of  its  predecessor,  1998  SME\r\n\r\nMasterplan,  which lost its momentum when  the  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npicked  up and the MNCs returned to Singapore.  There  is\r\n\r\ntherefore a need to dedicate special attention and  focus\r\n\r\non  SMEs, even though the economy is starting to pick up.\r\n\r\nIn  many  advanced  countries, like USA  and  Japan,  the\r\n\r\ngovernment agencies set up to look after the interests of\r\n\r\nSMEs  solely.   Therefore, this  debate  on  how  we  can\r\n\r\nsupport  the  growth  of  our  private  enterprises   and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  in  Singapore  is  timely.   I  believe\r\n\r\nSingapore  entrepreneurs  and  businesses  too  have  big\r\n\r\ndreams.  The Government and GLCs can act as a catalyst to\r\n\r\nunleash  the  potential of the Singapore Enterprise.   By\r\n\r\nsupporting  the SMEs, we are nurturing a  culture  and  a\r\n\r\nmindset  of  innovation  and creativity  that  marks  the\r\n\r\nmaking of a great nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  the Temasek Charter raises an issue  which  the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State  for Trade and Industry,  Mr  Raymond\r\n\r\nLim's  Entrepreneurship  and  Internationalisation   Sub-Committee  (EISC)  dealt with in their recently  released\r\n\r\nreport.  The main focus of the report is the role of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public discourse has, of late, focused almost\r\n\r\nexclusively on the issue of CPF after Senior Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  for Trade and Industry Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam's\r\n\r\nsub-committee  released its report.   However,  I  submit\r\n\r\nthat  the  issue  of the role of Government  in  business\r\n\r\ndeserves  equally intense scrutiny from Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  and  the public.   This is because it raises  very\r\n\r\nfundamental  questions  about the  Government's  position\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to the nurturing of local enterprises,  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility   it  places  upon  itself   for   shaping\r\n\r\nSingapore's economic landscape and hence, the  nature  of\r\n\r\ngovernment and its relation with the body politic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the Temasek Charter cannot and should\r\n\r\nnot be divorced from the broader context of what the EISC\r\n\r\ndocument  discusses.   This is  also  in  line  with  the\r\n\r\nessence of the Motion before this House.  Moreover, it is\r\n\r\nnoted that parts of the Temasek Charter, especially the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsection on the raison d'etre of GLCs, are in fact similar\r\n\r\nto those in the EISC document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore would like to deal with both the Temasek\r\n\r\nCharter and the EISC recommendations in my speech,  under\r\n\r\nwhat  I  term  as  the  four \"Ds\" of  the  Government  in\r\n\r\nbusiness.  The first \"D\" refers to delineation.  We  need\r\n\r\nto  delineate  clearly  the  markers  for  Government  in\r\n\r\nbusiness.    This  would,  among  others,   help   reduce\r\n\r\nallegations  from the private sector of encroachment  and\r\n\r\ncrowding out of their businesses by GLCs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EISC's recommendations regarding the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  role  in business cover  not  only  Temasek\r\n\r\nHoldings  but  also individual Ministries  and  statutory\r\n\r\nboards.   The  EISC report is an excellent, well-thought-out  and  generally balanced report.  There  are  a  good\r\n\r\nnumber  of wise and highly quotable statements  from  the\r\n\r\ndocument, three of which are particularly memorable to me\r\n\r\nand which provide good rules of thumb for delineating the\r\n\r\nboundary  conditions of Government  in  business.   These\r\n\r\nare,   firstly,   \"We   should   not   corporatise    for\r\n\r\ncorporatisation's sake.\"  I strongly support  the  EISC's\r\n\r\nrecommendation  that statutory boards should  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible  not  corporatise regulatory  functions  because\r\n\r\nthese are often monopoly functions and will lead to  rent\r\n\r\nseeking behaviour by the enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There would be a natural tendency for the public to\r\n\r\nperceive,  rightly or wrongly, that the  enterprise  will\r\n\r\nresist  simplifying rules and regulations as  this  could\r\n\r\nlead  to  a loss of revenue in fees and charges.   Hence,\r\n\r\nthe  often heard refrain that the Government's  fees  and\r\n\r\ncharges are high and should be cut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IRAS, for instance, was previously criticised,\r\n\r\nin The Straits Times of 9th January 1997,  for announcing\r\n\r\nits  staff  increments and bonuses took into account  the\r\n\r\namount of tax revenue collected.  This led the public  to\r\n\r\ninfer that the IRAS staff had every incentive to maximise\r\n\r\nits tax collection!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the EISC, I submit that it will be better to\r\n\r\nkeep activities of statutory boards that are strategic to\r\n\r\ntheir   missions  as  public  functions,  even   if   the\r\n\r\nactivities   can  be  organised  to  attract   commercial\r\n\r\nreturns.  We should not corporatise for corporatisation's\r\n\r\nsake   or  just  because  everyone  is  jumping  on   the\r\n\r\nbandwagon.  In this respect, if corporatisation is deemed\r\n\r\nnecessary,  the  EISC mentions the use  of  the  National\r\n\r\nHealthGroup model, which I wholeheartedly support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second rule of thumb, as recommended by the\r\n\r\nEISC,  is, \"Temasek Holdings should compel GLCs to  scale\r\n\r\nup their core competencies to build global businesses, as\r\n\r\nopposed  to concentrating on the local market to build  a\r\n\r\ndiverse range of unrelated businesses.\"  Some GLCs  (such\r\n\r\nas   SembCorp   Industries  and  NOL)  and   corporatised\r\n\r\nenterprises  of statutory boards (such as Ascendas)  have\r\n\r\nalready  initiated  this aggressively.   Other  GLCs  and\r\n\r\ncorporatised entities should also strive to do the  same.\r\n\r\nTheir reliance on the local market should be reduced  and\r\n\r\nthe  temptation to invest in a diverse range of unrelated\r\n\r\nbusinesses  to  improve  their bottomline  or  simply  to\r\n\r\njustify  their existence should be resisted.  This  would\r\n\r\nminimise the crowding out effect by GLCs which many  SMEs\r\n\r\ncomplain they suffer from.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last three decades, GLCs have proliferated\r\n\r\nand  taken on a life of their own.  As noted in  Business\r\n\r\nTimes,   3rd  June  2002,  Singapore  Technologies,   for\r\n\r\ninstance,  has spawned so many subsidiaries that  if  its\r\n\r\nnew Chief Executive, Peter Seah, were to visit one a day,\r\n\r\nit would reportedly take him up till 2005 to complete his\r\n\r\nrounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, any major attempt to divest or rationalise\r\n\r\nthe  GLCs  could trigger a chain reaction,  upsetting  an\r\n\r\nentire  apple cart of entrenched interests, institutional\r\n\r\narrangements   and   corporate   culture   and    agenda.\r\n\r\nFortunately,  as  noted  by  the  EISC,  many  GLCs   are\r\n\r\nprofessionally run, profitable, listed on the bourse, and\r\n\r\nown  reputable and thus valuable brand names that  should\r\n\r\nnot be destroyed purely to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsilence the large contingent of GLC critics and cynics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, history does contain some lessons for\r\n\r\nus.   The  70s  and 80s were the era of the conglomerate.\r\n\r\nIt  became  fashionable among businesses  in  the  US  to\r\n\r\nintegrate vertically, horizontally, or even sideways,  to\r\n\r\ncover  the  entire, or even out of the value chain.   The\r\n\r\nresult  was a mish-mash of business units often unrelated\r\n\r\nto  the  original function.  The holding company  of  the\r\n\r\nconglomerate, in effect, became a kind of internal  stock\r\n\r\nmarket, allocating funds to its subsidiaries on the basis\r\n\r\nof financial performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the late 80s and early 90s, it became evident\r\n\r\nthat  this  strategy  created  large  unwieldy  corporate\r\n\r\ncreatures  without  the agility to compete  against  more\r\n\r\nnimble  firms  that  chipped  away  at  their  respective\r\n\r\nbusinesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research in the US has shown that the decline of\r\n\r\nthese conglomerates stems from the enormous difficulty of\r\n\r\nmanaging  a  diversity  of  unrelated  operations.    The\r\n\r\nreaction  was  to  return to \"core  competencies\"  and  a\r\n\r\npainful  dismantling of these large business units.   The\r\n\r\nsemi-conductor  business,  for  example,  now   organises\r\n\r\nitself around chip designers and foundries which are,  in\r\n\r\nfact, sub-contractors to the former.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a danger that GLCs and Government agencies\r\n\r\nmay  sometimes fall into the trap of acting in the manner\r\n\r\nof  the now discredited corporate conglomerates.  I speak\r\n\r\nfrom  my personal experience.  During the heydays of  the\r\n\r\nproperty  market  boom in the mid-90s,  not  a  few  non-property GLCs were tempted by the astounding profits  one\r\n\r\ncould  make  from property investment.  To be fair,  GLCs\r\n\r\nwere  not  the only firms to succumb to that  temptation.\r\n\r\nOn  hindsight,  property  investment  could  indeed  have\r\n\r\ndelivered  superior shareholder returns, but  most  firms\r\n\r\ndid not exit quick enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus many of these firms came to grief when the\r\n\r\nbubble  burst, causing them to abandon their grand  plans\r\n\r\nto turn into property players.  Many of them have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsince  unwound  or are unwinding unrelated businesses  to\r\n\r\nfocus  on  what  they do best, for instance,  Delgro  and\r\n\r\nNatSteel.   Madam, I hope that GLCs will be ever  mindful\r\n\r\nof  this  chapter of their history and not turn back  the\r\n\r\nclock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third rule of thumb refers to the well known\r\n\r\n\"Yellow  Pages\"  rule.  Instead of endorsing  the  EISC's\r\n\r\nrecommended  Yellow Pages rule, the Temasek Charter  has,\r\n\r\ninstead, chosen the opposite route - seeking to build  on\r\n\r\nthe  best  attributes of Singapore's unique GLC's  model.\r\n\r\nRather than destroying the value of GLCs which first took\r\n\r\nshape  more  than three decades ago, Temasek  has  chosen\r\n\r\nwhat is probably a more pragmatic incrementalist approach\r\n\r\nand    eschewed    the   idea   of   privatisation    for\r\n\r\nprivatisation's sake.  Instead, GLCs are  to  be  run  as\r\n\r\ncommercial entities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not unlike the EISC's recommendations that\r\n\r\nGLCs  should not do national service and only people  who\r\n\r\ncan  contribute  to  the businesses  of  GLCs  should  be\r\n\r\nappointed  to the boards.  The GLCs are to shape  up  and\r\n\r\nperform.  Otherwise, they may have to be shipped out  or,\r\n\r\nin  the  words  of Temasek's Executive Director,  Mdm  Ho\r\n\r\nChing, be prepared to be had for lunch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLCs are to focus on core competencies, divest non-core businesses, but more importantly, they are to build\r\n\r\nsignificant    international   or   regional    business.\r\n\r\nBusinesses  that  are  no  longer  relevant  or  have  no\r\n\r\ninternational growth potential are likely to be divested.\r\n\r\nI    will   talk   a   little   bit   more   about    the\r\n\r\ninternationalisation aspect later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, the \"Yellow Pages\" rule proposed by the\r\n\r\nEISC  would  still be relevant in the case  of  statutory\r\n\r\nboards,  who should adopt this rule to set up enterprises\r\n\r\nonly  if the private sector is not providing or is unable\r\n\r\nto  provide a particular service.  And I think  this  was\r\n\r\naffirmed  earlier  by the Minister of State,  Mr  Raymond\r\n\r\nLim.   In the past, the private sector was underdeveloped\r\n\r\nand thus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunable  to  provide  a  host of  much  needed  and  vital\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector has now become much more\r\n\r\nsophisticated  and  reached  a  degree  of  maturity,  as\r\n\r\nevidenced  by the likes of Creative Technology  and  City\r\n\r\nDevelopment.  They have proven to be highly versatile  at\r\n\r\nadapting  to  and exploiting evolving market  trends  and\r\n\r\ntechnologies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory boards must religiously adopt the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  not  setting up an enterprise  unless  all\r\n\r\navenues   to  involve  private  sector  enterprises   are\r\n\r\nexhausted.  Even so, statutory boards could still seek to\r\n\r\nbe   involved  with  the  private  sector  through  joint\r\n\r\nventures,   or  what  is  currently  a  global  corporate\r\n\r\nfavourite  -  outsourcing  - instead  of  setting  up  an\r\n\r\nenterprise  by  itself.  This would help to  create  more\r\n\r\nspace and opportunities for the private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the above principles enunciated by EISC,\r\n\r\nI  fully endorse the three-fold rationale stated  in  the\r\n\r\nTemasek  Charter  for the Government to be  in  business.\r\n\r\nAnd  these  are to manage strategic, critical  resources,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  water, power and gas; to pursue  public  policy\r\n\r\nobjectives,  such as healthcare, housing  and  education;\r\n\r\nand  to  enable Singapore to sprout a second  wing  -  an\r\n\r\nexternal  wing  -  so that we, as a nation,  can  compete\r\n\r\nbeyond  the narrow confines of Singapore's geography,  or\r\n\r\nperhaps  to  quote  some famous words from  \"Star  Trek\",\r\n\r\n\"boldly go where no man has gone.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many large, as well as non-listed, GLCs fall into\r\n\r\nthe  first  two  categories - Group A which  is  what  is\r\n\r\nreferred to as Group A businesses - media, water,  power,\r\n\r\nsea   and  airports.   Additionally,  many  non-Group   A\r\n\r\ncategory GLCs are already loosely defined in category (3)\r\n\r\nand referred to as Group B businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal a bit more with the\r\n\r\ninternationalisation aspect, or what I call,  the  second\r\n\r\nD,  and  that  is,  Diaspora.  I submit that,  with  some\r\n\r\nexceptions - notably firms, like the Millennium and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCopthorne  Group - private enterprise will  probably  not\r\n\r\nattempt  to enter, much less, conquer, lucrative overseas\r\n\r\nmarkets without some nudging from the Government and GLCs\r\n\r\nleading  the  way.  Hence, Group B GLCs will  undoubtedly\r\n\r\nplay   a   key   role  in  the  internationalisation   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's private firms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a word of caution is in order here. GLCs\r\n\r\nmust   be  constantly  reminded  that  they  should   not\r\n\r\ninternationalise for internationalisation's sake.   Based\r\n\r\non  Singapore  Inc's  track record till  date,  Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies  that  have succeeded in international  markets\r\n\r\nhave  been  rare, and profitable international  expansion\r\n\r\nhas  even  been  rarer.  But the value of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nbrand  is  undoubtedly  high, as  experience  in  rapidly\r\n\r\ndeveloping  countries, like China,  demonstrates.   There\r\n\r\nare   thus   wonderful  opportunities  for  a   Singapore\r\n\r\nDiaspora.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLCs must be mindful that the promotion of the\r\n\r\nexternal  economy  is only justifiable  if  it  generates\r\n\r\nhigher   returns  than  the  potential  growth  rate   of\r\n\r\nSingapore without the external economy.  The burden  must\r\n\r\nbe  on  the  GLCs  to  deliver superior  returns  on  the\r\n\r\nexternal  economy  to  justify their  course  of  action.\r\n\r\nExpanding  aggressively  but blindly  into  international\r\n\r\nmarkets  could, instead of improving our economic  bottom\r\n\r\nline, do it more harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the quest for a more diversified\r\n\r\nearnings  base  by overseas expansion is a necessary  but\r\n\r\ninsufficient   condition   for   category   B   GLCs   to\r\n\r\ninternationalise.  IE Singapore, whose role  is  to  grow\r\n\r\nour  external  wing, should make every  attempt  to  link\r\n\r\nthese  GLCs  up with suitable local private sector  firms\r\n\r\nwilling  and capable of expanding overseas in the  chosen\r\n\r\nmarkets.  This way, definite benefits will accrue to both\r\n\r\nparties, private and public sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third D refers to Detachment. The Temasek\r\n\r\nCharter has emphasised the commitment of GLCs to  be  run\r\n\r\nas commercial entities, detaching ownership by Government\r\n\r\nfrom commercial-minded management.  Furthermore, they are\r\n\r\nto strive to be truly international businesses,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  clear  strategies on how to get there.   Similarly,\r\n\r\nthe  EISC's  recommendations  also  favour  a  commercial\r\n\r\napproach for GLCs.  Indeed, Temasek's choice of the  term\r\n\r\n\"TLCs\"  to  describe its large and formidable  stable  of\r\n\r\ncompanies seems to reinforce its desire to de-link itself\r\n\r\nfrom the Government.  But the question is: \"Can it really\r\n\r\ndo so?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the EISC notes, Temasek should make a conscious\r\n\r\neffort   to  cast  a  wide  net  to  attract  world-class\r\n\r\nmanagerial   talent  into  GLCs,  foreign  or  otherwise.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Temasek could bring more private sector directors\r\n\r\non the boards of its companies and management to ensure a\r\n\r\ngood  mix  of people, able to give different perspectives\r\n\r\nand ensure that the companies are run on sound commercial\r\n\r\nprinciples - delivering commercial returns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow a good mix, Temasek should avoid appointing\r\n\r\ntoo many Government and SAF scholars - undoubtedly highly\r\n\r\nintelligent, driven and capable people - to the ranks  of\r\n\r\nsenior  management of these companies.  Undeniably,  many\r\n\r\nof  them have subsequently carved out sterling careers in\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector.  However, even though these  people\r\n\r\nare   placed  in  the  private  sector,  they   may   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily be of the private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scholars carefully groomed by the system and attuned\r\n\r\nto the culture of the public sector, parachuting into key\r\n\r\npositions  in GLCs, may have a propensity to  carry  with\r\n\r\nthem a Government mindset that does not sit well with the\r\n\r\nworkings  of  the  private sector.  I submit  that  there\r\n\r\nshould be a greater degree of intermingling of public and\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  talents  in  GLCs.   It  must  never  be\r\n\r\nconstrued  as  a zero sum game when a public  servant  is\r\n\r\nlost to the private sector, and vice versa.  Indeed,  the\r\n\r\nintermingling will serve to enrich both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth and final D refers to Divestment. While\r\n\r\nsupporting  the  spirit of divestment where  appropriate,\r\n\r\nthe  Temasek  Charter  does not spell  out  any  definite\r\n\r\ndivestment   timetable,  as  some  of  my   parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues  have  alluded to earlier.   Instead,  Temasek\r\n\r\nnotes that it has been progressively divesting its stake\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  non-strategic companies and listing some companies to\r\n\r\nbroaden  their  ownership base.  It also states  that  it\r\n\r\nwill   continue   to  rationalise  and  consolidate   its\r\n\r\nshareholdings  where  it  is opportune  to  do  so.   The\r\n\r\nargument  for the lack of a definite divestment programme\r\n\r\nis  the need to achieve the best price for the unit being\r\n\r\ndivested.  If market conditions are not right,  it  makes\r\n\r\nno commercial sense to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, whilst I agree that this is\r\n\r\nlargely a reasonable path to take, and I am certainly not\r\n\r\nadvocating  a great GLC sale, we have to be mindful  that\r\n\r\nthe  cost  for  not divesting soon enough could  be  even\r\n\r\nhigher,   and  that  is  the  killing  off   of   private\r\n\r\nenterprise.   As a compromise, I suggest Temasek  perform\r\n\r\nan  annual  divestment audit, taking into  account  other\r\n\r\nthan  the  usual factors, like capital market conditions,\r\n\r\nstrategic relevance and likely price, the impact  on  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  of  divestment or  otherwise.   Further,\r\n\r\nsubject  to  suitable  safeguards, the  divestment  audit\r\n\r\ncould  be  tabled  in  Parliament for  debate.   This  is\r\n\r\nanother way of putting in place what the EISC has  itself\r\n\r\nrecommended - mandatory periodic housekeeping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the divestment programme, Temasek should also not\r\n\r\nbe  averse  to  the dismantling of its companies.   Size,\r\n\r\nthough  useful,  is  not always a competitive  advantage.\r\n\r\nSpecifically,  there  should  be  a  proper  cost-benefit\r\n\r\nanalysis  to  determine if the break-up  value  from  the\r\n\r\ndifferent logical parts of the business exceeds the value\r\n\r\nof the entity as a unified whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In saying this, I must state that I am not against\r\n\r\nsize  for  its  own  sake.   I also  recognise  that  the\r\n\r\ncompetition law that the EISC speaks of, operates only to\r\n\r\nbreak  up  the  abuse  of monopoly  power,  not  monopoly\r\n\r\nitself.  But quite apart from what the future competition\r\n\r\nauthorities can and will do, Temasek itself,  as  arm  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Government, should proactively ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  actions  of  its subsidiaries do not stifle  private\r\n\r\nenterprise through the sheer weight of its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsize  and market power.  Another model I support  is  the\r\n\r\nmanagement buy-out which has been proposed in the  recent\r\n\r\ncase of NatSteel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need for Temasek to act more decisively\r\n\r\nin   its  divestment  programme,  lest  the  Charter   be\r\n\r\nconstrued as mere talk without action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to applaud the efforts\r\n\r\nof  the  relevant  parties  in preparing  both  the  EISC\r\n\r\ndocuments and the Temasek Charter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Temasek was formed in 1974 as the Government's\r\n\r\ninvestment holding arm, it has grown to include more than\r\n\r\n60  major  companies,  with  subsidiaries  and  associate\r\n\r\ncompanies  in  almost  every  economic  sector,  with   a\r\n\r\nworkforce  of some 150,000.  This is more than twice  the\r\n\r\nsize  of  the  entire civil service, which  is  currently\r\n\r\nreported   on   the  website  as  about  60,000   strong.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the top 22 GLCs are reported to account  for\r\n\r\n13%  of  the  country's gross domestic product  in  1998.\r\n\r\nGLCs  are  thus  indeed  very  significant  and  play  an\r\n\r\nimportant role in Singapore's economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I submit that times have changed. GLCs will\r\n\r\nneed   multi-industry  knowledge,  technology  assessment\r\n\r\ncapabilities, and financial expertise well in  excess  of\r\n\r\nwhat  it now has.  Recall the lessons of the conglomerate\r\n\r\nand its demise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognising that the private sector provides the\r\n\r\nbest  seedbed for enterprise and innovation, it will need\r\n\r\nall  the  space  it  can  get - physical,  financial  and\r\n\r\neconomic.  In this regard, the business of government  is\r\n\r\nultimately not government in business, but government for\r\n\r\nbusiness  - planting, watering, pruning, nurturing  -  to\r\n\r\ngrow  and  nurture the future heroes of  capitalism  that\r\n\r\nwill  spearhead  the  next stage of Singapore's  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and, in the process, we could convince  more\r\n\r\nwould-be quitters to be stayers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I therefore support the Motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>7.05 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I rise in support of the Motion to implement the\r\n\r\nrecommendations     of    the    Entrepreneurship     and\r\n\r\nInternationalisation  Sub-Committee  (EISC).    I   fully\r\n\r\nsupport  the  recommendation  to  redefine  the  role  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  in business and to call on the Government  to\r\n\r\nsupport  local  private enterprise.  I particularly  like\r\n\r\nthe idea that Government-linked companies should work  in\r\n\r\ncollaboration  and  partnership  with  small  and  medium\r\n\r\nenterprises to complement their business rather  than  to\r\n\r\ncompete with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has already been said in Parliament as well as\r\n\r\noutside  as  to  how  GLCs stifle and crowd  out  private\r\n\r\nenterprise.   However, I would like to  say  that  it  is\r\n\r\nequally  important  that we do not  over  exaggerate  the\r\n\r\nnegative  side of GLCs because, by and large,  they  have\r\n\r\nnot  done  too badly.  They have done quite a  good  job.\r\n\r\nThey   are  run  professionally,  efficiently  and   also\r\n\r\nprofitably.   They provide a lot of jobs for  our  people\r\n\r\nand  they  also contribute to a significant part  of  our\r\n\r\nGDP,  some  13%.   A handful of them -  I  am  glad  that\r\n\r\nbouquets  have  also been thrown at GLCs  -  have  helped\r\n\r\nSingapore establish its international brand name.  And it\r\n\r\nis  because of the good reputation caused by GLCs, a  lot\r\n\r\nof  local enterprises have been helped in their marketing\r\n\r\nefforts overseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the hue and cry and criticisms levelled\r\n\r\nat  GLCs, some of them have already begun the process  of\r\n\r\ncollaborating with local enterprises.  The logistics  arm\r\n\r\nof  SembCorp Industries teamed up with Goodpack  to  make\r\n\r\nuse  of  their  specially developed metal  containers  to\r\n\r\ninternational  bulk  carriers.  We also  have  CapitaLand\r\n\r\nwith  Kinderkids  World providing childcare  services  at\r\n\r\ntheir   properties  abroad.   All  these   are   positive\r\n\r\ndevelopments and ought to be acknowledged.  Of course,  a\r\n\r\nlot more can be done and a lot needs to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether private enterprise would have flourished\r\n\r\nwithout GLCs is a moot point.  But it is clear that  GLCs\r\n\r\nwere formed at a time when private enterprise was either\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunwilling  or  unable to get into businesses  which  GLCs\r\n\r\nwent  into.   Of  course, there are many instances  where\r\n\r\nGLCs  slipped their fingers into one pie too  many.   But\r\n\r\nmost  of  that  is the past, and I think  they  are  also\r\n\r\nembarrassed.  So, let us not harp on it.  Let us move  on\r\n\r\nand find the proper solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations of the EISC as well as the New\r\n\r\nTemasek  Charter recently unveiled are all steps  in  the\r\n\r\nright  direction.  There is a recognition that  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday  is  not quite the same as it was many  years  back\r\n\r\nand,  in  the  new situation, the role of  Government  in\r\n\r\nbusiness  needs to change.  This role, however, need  not\r\n\r\nbe changed so quickly and so drastically.  Some of us may\r\n\r\nthink that the remaking of Singapore is all about turning\r\n\r\nSingapore  upside down and inside out, but  life  is  not\r\n\r\nquite  so simple as that.  Some things can be done,  some\r\n\r\nthings cannot be done, short of shooting your own foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLCs, because of the magnitude of their presence in\r\n\r\nthe  marketplace, it would be imprudent to have a  sudden\r\n\r\ndivestment  of  businesses  worth  billions  of  dollars,\r\n\r\ninvolving  hundreds  and thousands of  jobs.   This  will\r\n\r\nsurely destroy shareholders' values, and shareholders are\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  It will destroy shareholders'  values  and\r\n\r\nit  will destroy jobs.  This will not be good for us  and\r\n\r\nclearly, it will not be the right step to take.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we need a much more well-managed and organised\r\n\r\napproach towards divestment, and I am glad that the  EISC\r\n\r\nas  well as Temasek Holdings are taking the positive  and\r\n\r\nright  steps  in  this  direction.   What  is  much  more\r\n\r\nimportant  is  the  development  of  the  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nspirit.   This is not an easy task, but steps  are  being\r\n\r\ntaken.   They  are  pushing this goal,  but  we  have  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  that it is going to be a long haul because  we\r\n\r\nare starting fairly right from the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I would like to share with the\r\n\r\nHouse  a  report  published  by  Global  Entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nMonitor  (GEM),  which  is  an international  body  which\r\n\r\ntracks entrepreneurial activity worldwide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  its  2001 report, it compared some 29 countries.   We\r\n\r\nfared  not so well.  We were ranked 27th out of  29.   In\r\n\r\nits 2000 report, we were 19th out of 21.  So we are quite\r\n\r\nfar  away from the Number 1 position which we would  like\r\n\r\nto occupy and boast about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this so? Critics of GLCs would probably jump\r\n\r\nat  this and say, \"I told you so!  GLCs are crowding  off\r\n\r\nlocal  private  enterprises.\"  But the real  reasons  are\r\n\r\nquite  complex.  The GEM report recognises that Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  a  rather  unique challenge and handicap.   This  is\r\n\r\nbecause, as Mdm Deputy Speaker has said, we have a rather\r\n\r\nsmall  domestic economy.  This means that, by  necessity,\r\n\r\nbusinesses  must venture overseas in order to  acquire  a\r\n\r\nsize  that  matters.  Businesses may argue that  if  they\r\n\r\nhave had the entire domestic economy to itself, small  as\r\n\r\nit  may  be,  it will give them that start-up  advantage.\r\n\r\nBut  we have to remember that we operate an open economy.\r\n\r\nIf  we do not compete against GLCs, then we will have  to\r\n\r\ncontend  with  MNCs.  So, in a way, the  GLCs  provide  a\r\n\r\ncheck  against MNCs.  But, whatever the reason might  be,\r\n\r\nthere must be a recognition that because of the smallness\r\n\r\nof  our  economy, businesses must, by nature, strike  out\r\n\r\nand acquire a size that matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GEM report also noted that the Government has\r\n\r\nalready   promoted  entrepreneurial   activity   in   the\r\n\r\ntechnology  area.   This  is a good  practical  approach,\r\n\r\nbecause it is in the cutting-edge of technology and  life\r\n\r\nsciences  that we have the greatest chances  of  success.\r\n\r\nBut  even this approach has its pitfalls, as the Internet\r\n\r\nbubble  has  taught us a few painful  lessons.   But  the\r\n\r\npoint  here is that by playing safe, focusing  on  a  few\r\n\r\ntechnology companies, we are actually also going  against\r\n\r\nthe grain or the spirit of entrepreneurship, which is not\r\n\r\nbeing  afraid to fail.  Therefore, I would like  to  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Government to promote greater entrepreneurship.   It\r\n\r\nis  not  just about high-tech; it should also be  medium-tech,  low-tech and no-tech, because the whole spirit  of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  is  also  about  the  spirit  of  self-reliance.  If we look at the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproducts and services we use everyday - the food we  eat,\r\n\r\nthe clothes we wear, the chairs we sit on - these are no-tech   businesses.   These  are  services  and   products\r\n\r\nprovided  by  businesses with a few thousand  dollars  or\r\n\r\nmillions  of  dollars  of turnover.   But  one  thing  is\r\n\r\ncommon.  They are started up by entrepreneurs, either out\r\n\r\nof  necessity or out of a passion, ie, their  ability  to\r\n\r\nknow that they can do something better than others.   So,\r\n\r\nwhatever  their  motivation,  it  is  important  that  we\r\n\r\nencourage and support them, because it is out of a  large\r\n\r\npool of entrepreneurs that some superstars can emerge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can use the analogy in football, I suppose.\r\n\r\nBrazil  has  won the World Cup a few times, and  this  is\r\n\r\nbecause  an  entire nation is just crazy about  football.\r\n\r\nSo,  they have a lot of footballers to choose from.   All\r\n\r\nyoung Brazilian boys play it on every piece of land  that\r\n\r\nthey  can find.  We also celebrated a trawl of four goals\r\n\r\nin the recent Commonwealth Games.  We won in table tennis\r\n\r\nand  badminton, games which are not entirely popular with\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   But  we won because of  imported  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent.   That  is  not so bad.  And  this  is  the  same\r\n\r\nformula which has won us many goals for our economy.   We\r\n\r\nwon  because of foreign direct investments, and this  has\r\n\r\nhelped us to achieve remarkable growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not quite the same. We could have\r\n\r\ncontinued  this strategy, but the landscape has  changed.\r\n\r\nSo it is important that we grow more local entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nBut  it  has  to  be also noted that there  is  a  direct\r\n\r\ncorrelation   between  foreign  direct   investment   and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial activity.  The GEM report noted that,  in\r\n\r\nthe  case of Belgium - only Belgium and Japan were ranked\r\n\r\nbelow Singapore - it was a country whose economy is  very\r\n\r\nhighly   dependent  on  foreign  direct  investment   and\r\n\r\ninternational  trade,  its  entrepreneurial  activity  is\r\n\r\nabysmally low.  So, critics said that this was due to the\r\n\r\nfact   that   foreign   direct  investments   just   make\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial activity less attractive.   But  the  GEM\r\n\r\nreport  also noted that Belgium did not quite help itself\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  entrepreneurial  training  to  help  shape\r\n\r\nattitudes  and  behaviour.  So, entrepreneurial  training\r\n\r\nwas only present at the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nundergraduate  and  graduate level, but  it  was  totally\r\n\r\nabsent  across the system relating to primary,  secondary\r\n\r\nand  pre-university level.  Therefore, it  just  did  not\r\n\r\nstimulate  the  attitudes which  were  so  vital  for  an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial mindset and environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, perhaps, we too can look at our own education\r\n\r\nsystem.   Our  schools now focus very  much  on  academic\r\n\r\nresults,  and  our  vocational institutes,  on  technical\r\n\r\nskills.   This orientation has obviously served  us  well\r\n\r\nfor  many  years.  We will continue to require  brilliant\r\n\r\nacademics, competent technicians but, at this  stage,  we\r\n\r\nneed  something  more.   So we need  to  weave  into  our\r\n\r\neducation  system creativity, entrepreneurial  attributes\r\n\r\nlike  dare-to-dream and dare-to-fail.  That way,  we  can\r\n\r\ndevelop and shape attitudes amongst our young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to end by looking at which are the\r\n\r\ncountries which are ranked well, and what are the lessons\r\n\r\nwe  can  draw from them.  The dark horses were Australia,\r\n\r\nNew  Zealand and Mexico.  I call them dark horses because\r\n\r\nthey  do  not really have exactly high-profile economies.\r\n\r\nBut   they   were  ranked  very  highly   in   terms   of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial activity.  And this was attributed to the\r\n\r\nfact  that there was a high level of government awareness\r\n\r\nin  this  area, promoting entrepreneurship and having  an\r\n\r\nactive  engagement with entrepreneurial leaders as  well.\r\n\r\nIn  the  case  of  Mexico,  its  economy  was  very  much\r\n\r\ndominated by large public and private monopolies, and yet\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship is very much alive and  thriving.   This\r\n\r\nis  because  these  large public  and  private  companies\r\n\r\nactually   outsource  their  activities  to   the   small\r\n\r\nindependent businesses which are able to run  in  a  much\r\n\r\nmore  agile manner.  Hence, the point made on outsourcing\r\n\r\nmany times over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Korea was also ranked very highly and this was due\r\n\r\nto  the  fact  that it was able to address  the  problems\r\n\r\nsurfacing from the 1997 Asian economic crisis very  well.\r\n\r\nIt  was  able  to  develop  very  specific  measures,  in\r\n\r\nparticular  to  develop  new  businesses.  As  we  remake\r\n\r\nSingapore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  think  there  are  lessons to  gain  from  the  Korean\r\n\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the great entrepreneurial star - the United\r\n\r\nStates  of  America.  It has been a star for  many,  many\r\n\r\nyears.   This is because its culture embraces change  and\r\n\r\nopportunity  seeking.   Entrepreneurship  is  very   much\r\n\r\nregarded  as an accepted and highly respected  occupation\r\n\r\nand   failure   is  regarded  as  an  accepted   learning\r\n\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we too can develop a culture which embraces\r\n\r\nchange  and  opportunity in a big way.  We too  can  make\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship an accepted and highly respected  career\r\n\r\nand   we  too  can  make  failure  an  accepted  learning\r\n\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, we must have Government incentives\r\n\r\nand support. We must have laws and regulations lightened.\r\n\r\nWe  must  have  the  GLCs now working more  and  more  in\r\n\r\ncollaboration and in support of local enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than that, we need a complete transformation of\r\n\r\nthe  entire  nation's attitude towards  entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  good start.  It is a long haul but it is  very\r\n\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the\r\n\r\nMotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Gan See Khem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Gan See Khem (Nominated Member):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I would like to support the Motion by Mr  Leong\r\n\r\nHorn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh and share in their request\r\n\r\nfor the Government to consider the implementation of some\r\n\r\nof  the key recommendations of the EISC on Government  in\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other speakers ahead of me had spoken\r\n\r\npersuasively  on  the merits  of the recommendations  and\r\n\r\nalso commented on the need for Singapore to encourage the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of entrepreneurship and local enterprise  and\r\n\r\nI need not elaborate again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GEM report has accumulated evidence from their\r\n\r\nresearch over several\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears that documents the significant relationship between\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  and  national economic  adaptation  and\r\n\r\nexpansion.  From the GEM report, it does appear  that  in\r\n\r\nless-developed and developing countries where the economy\r\n\r\nis  less dependent on international trade, where there is\r\n\r\nless  extensive social welfare system and the  women  are\r\n\r\nless empowered in the economy, necessity entrepreneurship\r\n\r\ndominates  and it is positively related to the  state  of\r\n\r\neconomic  development.  India ranks  very  high  in  this\r\n\r\nscore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, in the more developed countries,\r\n\r\nopportunity  entrepreneurship dominates. The  GEM  report\r\n\r\nfinds  that  the rate of opportunity entrepreneurship  is\r\n\r\nhigher  where  there  is  reduced  national  emphasis  on\r\n\r\nmanufacturing,  less  intrusive  Government   regulation,\r\n\r\nhigher prevalence of informal investors and a significant\r\n\r\nrespect  for  entrepreneurial activity.  In this  aspect,\r\n\r\nthe USA is a case in point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague had mentioned earlier, Singapore has\r\n\r\none  of  the  lowest rates of entrepreneurial  activities\r\n\r\namongst  the  GEM  2001 countries.  Many unique  national\r\n\r\nfeatures were earlier cited to explain the lower level of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial activities in Singapore.  These  features\r\n\r\nare  embedded in our social and economic systems  and  we\r\n\r\nneed   to   actively   implement   some   of   the    key\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the EISC report so as  to  create  the\r\n\r\nnecessary mechanisms and structures to improve  our  rate\r\n\r\nof entrepreneurship activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of our national goal of creating a more\r\n\r\nvibrant and more diverse economy, we need to increase the\r\n\r\nrate  of  public  and  private  investment,  devoted   to\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial activity so as to accelerate  innovation,\r\n\r\ntechnological  development  and  job  creation.   In  the\r\n\r\nSingapore economy, there are 103,000 SMEs which  make  up\r\n\r\nsome  90%  of all establishments and employ  50%  of  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.   These SMEs contribute only 35% to  our  GDP,\r\n\r\nwhilst MNCs contribute 45% and, as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI understand earlier, the GLCs contribute some 13%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This formula had worked in the past but we need to\r\n\r\ncontinuously improve the share of private entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nactivity   and   create  an  environment  whereby   local\r\n\r\nenterprise  can develop the capabilities,  resources  and\r\n\r\nsize that would allow them to compete in the regional, if\r\n\r\nnot,  the  global marketplace.  The creation of  such  an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  society  can only  benefit  Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomic development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singaporeans, we are heartened at the success of\r\n\r\nour  GLCs, particularly in their ability to move into the\r\n\r\nknowledge, technology and capital intensive sectors, both\r\n\r\nlocally  and also in the international arena.  GLCs  were\r\n\r\nset  up  to  spearhead the development of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy and they had fulfilled their mission.  That said,\r\n\r\nI  hope  that the GLCs would continue to play a  role  in\r\n\r\nspearheading the remaking of the new Singapore economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We appreciate that Temasek Holdings had come forward\r\n\r\nand  shared their new defined Charter and articulated the\r\n\r\nrole of the Temasek-linked companies to all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I would like to urge the other sectors  of  the\r\n\r\nGLCs  including the labour-linked companies (LLCs)  (some\r\n\r\nof  my  colleagues call them NLCs), the statutory  board-linked  companies (SBLCs) and the press-linked  companies\r\n\r\n(PLCs)  to  follow the example set by Temasek  and  share\r\n\r\ntheir  strategic  roadmap with Singaporeans.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthat such communication would address the anxiety of  the\r\n\r\nlocal  enterprises  in  terms  of  the  perceived  unfair\r\n\r\ncompetition from GLCs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TLCs had communicated and informed Singaporeans that\r\n\r\nthey  intend  to spearhead the development of  enterprise\r\n\r\nand to partner other non-TLCs, including local SMEs, when\r\n\r\nventuring   into  more  knowledge-based  activities   and\r\n\r\nregional  markets.  TLCs, in this instance, can play  the\r\n\r\nrole of the big brother or sister, where the case may be,\r\n\r\nto  invest value-add and partner with the private  sector\r\n\r\nto groom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviable  local enterprises to compete effectively  in  the\r\n\r\nregional  arena.   I am sure that local SMEs  would  look\r\n\r\nforward  to further dialogues and exchanges with TLCs  to\r\n\r\nwork   out   effective   and   profitable   collaborative\r\n\r\narrangements.   I  also hope that over  time,  our  local\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  will  associate  TLCs  with  the  acronym,\r\n\r\n\"tender,  loving  care\", signifying a  more  pro-business\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a renewed marked shift globally towards\r\n\r\nprivate-public partnership (PPP) as an engine for growth.\r\n\r\nPPP  recognises that both the public and private  sectors\r\n\r\nhave  certain  advantages relative to the performance  of\r\n\r\nspecific tasks. Thus, by allowing each sector to do  what\r\n\r\nit  does best, public services and infrastructure can  be\r\n\r\nprovided  in the most economically efficient manner.   In\r\n\r\nthe  United States, over the last couple of years,  there\r\n\r\nhave  been  much renewed intense discussions on  how  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can work better and cost less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, this focus has led to discussions as to\r\n\r\nwhether  or to what extent the private sector  should  be\r\n\r\nperforming  many of the functions currently performed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  With budget deficit reduction  and  the\r\n\r\ndownsizing of Government agencies, the American attention\r\n\r\non  privatisation, competition and efficiency has greatly\r\n\r\nincreased.   In Ireland, PPP has been widely implemented,\r\n\r\ninitially through modestly scaled projects, with the  aim\r\n\r\nof  combining  the  best  of public  and  private  sector\r\n\r\nexpertise to create value for money and quality outcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PPP has been encouraged through many economic\r\n\r\nsectors,  such  as housing, education, healthcare,  local\r\n\r\nservice,  public utilities and transport.   According  to\r\n\r\nthe   GEM   report,   Ireland  has  the   highest   total\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial activity within Europe.  The  World  Bank\r\n\r\nhas  also  articulated their emphasis on  private  sector\r\n\r\nparticipation  as engines for growth.  In  recent  years,\r\n\r\nthe  World Bank has encouraged private participation  not\r\n\r\nonly  in  infrastructure development but  also  in  human\r\n\r\nservices,  most prominently in education, healthcare  and\r\n\r\nsocial security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore faces major technological\r\n\r\ntransformation  and a maturing economy, both  the  public\r\n\r\nand  private  sectors  must share the  responsibility  of\r\n\r\ndefining new national strategies that would unleash human\r\n\r\ncreativity   to   enable  us  to   innovate   and   adapt\r\n\r\ntechnologies   and  opportunities  to  our   own   needs.\r\n\r\nSingapore needs to build our own model for public-private\r\n\r\npartnership.   Thus,  it is also timely  for  our  public\r\n\r\nsector to review the potential of PPP in their activities\r\n\r\nand to share such visions with Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the experience of other countries has\r\n\r\nreminded   us   that   though   the   opportunities   for\r\n\r\nprivatisation  are  plentiful,  the  path  to  successful\r\n\r\nbusiness   relationships  and   implementation   of   PPP\r\n\r\nnevertheless would face many challenges.  I believe  that\r\n\r\nfor  PPP  to  work in Singapore, we need to realistically\r\n\r\nidentify the hurdles to successful PPP implementation, to\r\n\r\ndevelop the administrative structure to enable PPP to put\r\n\r\ninto  practice and to formalise an incentive system  that\r\n\r\nwould  foster collaboration and cooperation  between  the\r\n\r\ntwo  sectors for the benefit and long-term needs  of  the\r\n\r\nnation.  The success of PPP in Singapore would depend  to\r\n\r\na  large  extent, on a well-thought out charter and  plan\r\n\r\nthat    is    effectively   communicated   to   different\r\n\r\nstakeholders  such  as  the one  articulated  by  Temasek\r\n\r\nrecently.   I  hope  that  the other  GLCs  and  relevant\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies would also share their plans with  us\r\n\r\nin the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike TLCs which would primarily play the role as\r\n\r\nthe   co-investor,  other  public  sector  agencies   can\r\n\r\nparticipate in many other forms of PPP which may  include\r\n\r\noutsourcing, contract services, build, operate, transfer,\r\n\r\nand many other types of PPP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful PPP can only result if there is\r\n\r\ncommitment  from top public officials who are willing  to\r\n\r\nbe actively engaged and support the concept and taking  a\r\n\r\nleadership  role in the development of such partnerships.\r\n\r\nEqually  important  is that the private  sector  partners\r\n\r\nmust  have  the  relevant skills and  experience  in  the\r\n\r\nspecific area of partnership being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsidered.   Once the partnership has been  established,\r\n\r\nthe  public sector must remain actively involved  in  the\r\n\r\nprogramme or project not only in terms of monitoring, but\r\n\r\nalso  in  value-adding.  As such, PPP  will  provide  the\r\n\r\nplatform   for   the   creation   of   more   opportunity\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship,   thereby  enabling   Singaporeans   to\r\n\r\ncontinue   to   expand  our  economy  through   increased\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate, Mdm Deputy Speaker, my\r\n\r\nsupport   for   the  Motion  proposed  for  debate   this\r\n\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nthank you for allowing me to speak on the Motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I would start by giving an analogy which\r\n\r\nencapsulates  my opinion on the debate on  GLCs  and  the\r\n\r\nSMEs.   In  an ecosystem, there is a dynamic  complex  of\r\n\r\nplants,  animals and micro-organisms and their non-living\r\n\r\nenvironment  interacting  as a  functional  unit.   Each,\r\n\r\nregardless  of  size, has a role to play in  the  web  of\r\n\r\nlife.   For  example, in the ocean ecosystem, the  oceans\r\n\r\nsupport  a  wide variety of plants and animals which  co-exist  in  relative harmony, each fulfilling  a  specific\r\n\r\nniche and role they have in the ecosystem.  While in  any\r\n\r\necosystem  there  is  competition  and  survival  of  the\r\n\r\nfittest,  there  are  also symbiotic relationships.   The\r\n\r\necosystem is really a matrix of inter-relations, not just\r\n\r\na  singular approach or formula.  Take, for example,  the\r\n\r\nlittle  cleaner  fish in the ocean.  How does it survive?\r\n\r\nOften,  tiny micro-organisms fasten themselves to  a  big\r\n\r\nfish and make sores on its body.  When this happens,  the\r\n\r\nbig  fish  goes  to a coral reef where the  cleaner  fish\r\n\r\nlives.   The  cleaner fish hunts all over the fish  body,\r\n\r\nand  helps  the big fish by eating all these tiny  micro-organisms and, in this way, the cleaner fish gets fed and\r\n\r\nthe bigger fish is spared the discomfort.  An economy  is\r\n\r\nsimilar to the ecosystem.  As such, there is a place  and\r\n\r\nrole for large corporations and smaller enterprises.  The\r\n\r\ndifficult part is how do we go about this balancing act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share with the House my thoughts on this.\r\n\r\nRather than just levelling the playing field in Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  the SMEs, there should be more constructive ways  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them  grow, compete and survive beyond our  shores.\r\n\r\nThe  Chinese proverb  -  give a man a fish, and he  would\r\n\r\neat  for a day; teach a man to fish, and he would eat for\r\n\r\nthe rest of his life  -  is very true.  There is no level\r\n\r\nplaying  field in the economic world anywhere.   So,  why\r\n\r\ncreate  an  artificial environment that will only  ensure\r\n\r\nlocal survival?  What is at stake is continued and global\r\n\r\nsurvival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I believe there are two key elements which are\r\n\r\ncritical to any GLC versus SME debate.  The first is  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of our economic ecosystem.  We  must  realise\r\n\r\nthat  the playing field is not just the domestic  market.\r\n\r\nRather,  the economic ecosystem is well beyond Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  must  not  run  the risk of debating  how  we  should\r\n\r\ncompete  locally,  ie, keeping the balance  in  our  pond\r\n\r\necosystem  while  the  larger ocean ecosystem,  which  is\r\n\r\nglobalisation, washes us over and leaves us in its wake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our discussions, we must be mindful that the\r\n\r\nmission  is building establishments out in the world  for\r\n\r\nour descendants, so that wherever we decide to stake out,\r\n\r\nthere  is  always   HQ Singapore.  To  have  such  global\r\n\r\nambitions, we need a strong home base, just as  the  SMEs\r\n\r\nwant  to build a strong home base, so we should not  deny\r\n\r\nthe  GLCs  the  same.   A strong home  base  will  better\r\n\r\nprepare our companies to take on the world.  There is  an\r\n\r\nincessant  cry  that SMEs are being  crowded  out.   When\r\n\r\nfaced  with  Goliath, David may have just  cause  to  cry\r\n\r\nfoul.  But, paradoxically, organisational ecologists have\r\n\r\nobserved  empirically that increased dominance  of  large\r\n\r\nfirms  actually creates an environment that is hospitable\r\n\r\nto the entry of smaller specialist organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The August issue of Stamford Business further\r\n\r\nreported  that this is seen in industry after industry  - breweries, airlines, auditing, music recording, newspaper\r\n\r\npublishing, manufacturing of hard disks, etc.   As  large\r\n\r\ngeneralist firms tend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  go  for  the market centre, niches appear around  the\r\n\r\nperiphery.   In  beer parlance, the small  craft  brewers\r\n\r\nmoved  in  to provide consumers with a wider  variety  in\r\n\r\ntaste, colour, form and serving temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vibrancy of the local business landscape is\r\n\r\nborne out by the statistics.  In the 10 years, from  1988\r\n\r\nto  1998, the number of SME establishments grew  by  59%.\r\n\r\nThe  same organisational ecologists also subscribe to the\r\n\r\nred  queen  theory.   Remember the  red  queen  in  Lewis\r\n\r\nCarol's  fairytale \"Through the Looking Glass\".  The  red\r\n\r\nqueen  seems  to be running but actually staying  on  the\r\n\r\nsame spot.  What it means is that competition is good, in\r\n\r\nthat a company is forced by direct competition to improve\r\n\r\nits  performance, in turn, pressurising its rivals to  do\r\n\r\nso,  thereby  creating a virtuous cycle of  learning  and\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A research has revealed that a lack of domestic\r\n\r\ncompetitive experience is a critical disadvantage when  a\r\n\r\nfirm  is  thrust  into  global  competition.   Hence,   a\r\n\r\ncompetitive landscape must be nurtured.  So, it is not  a\r\n\r\nquestion of snuffing out the big boys, neither is it that\r\n\r\nthe  SMEs  do not have a role in embracing and  enhancing\r\n\r\nSingapore's competitiveness and economic growth.  Rather,\r\n\r\nlet  us see how we can harness the strengths of the  GLCs\r\n\r\nto  nurture and promote the SMEs, so that they  can  also\r\n\r\nget  bigger, stronger and fly the Singapore flag  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  Coexistence of the GLCs and SMEs would have to be\r\n\r\nthe  way  forward,  honing  our capabilities  within  our\r\n\r\nshores, so that once we foray abroad and leaning on brand\r\n\r\nSingapore, which is one that is already recognisable, one\r\n\r\nwith high regional and global awareness and standing  for\r\n\r\nefficiency, fair dealing and transparency, we will have a\r\n\r\nmuch better overall chance of success and survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Competitive coexistence</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some of my suggestions. First, let us\r\n\r\nnetwork  and talk.  So, what is so difficult  about  this\r\n\r\nespecially  where  we proactively do this  with  overseas\r\n\r\nbusinessmen and potential partners?  Strangely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenough,  I  suspect  that we do not  do  enough  of  this\r\n\r\nbetween  the GLCs and SMEs.  We need a bridge to  connect\r\n\r\nthe  GLCs  and SMEs.  Through this bridge, ideas  can  be\r\n\r\nexchanged,  lessons learned can be shared,  new  business\r\n\r\nthoughts  may spring forth and partnerships may  blossom.\r\n\r\nThese  partnerships may be between GLCs and SMEs or  even\r\n\r\namong  the SMEs themselves.  Perhaps IE Singapore can  be\r\n\r\nthe business SDU to bring these parties together.  Or the\r\n\r\nChambers of Commerce and industry associations can act as\r\n\r\ncatalysts.   A forum needs to be created.   Just  as  our\r\n\r\nsuccessful  SDU  has  dinner talks, tea  parties,  social\r\n\r\nactivities  and match-making capabilities, this  business\r\n\r\nSDU can do the same for GLCs and the SMEs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, GLCs can play an active role in helping\r\n\r\nSMEs venture abroad by partnering them when they seek new\r\n\r\npastures.  A business associate, which I think  was  also\r\n\r\nmentioned  by an earlier colleague, shared  with  me  the\r\n\r\nobservation on Taiwanese businesses venturing into China.\r\n\r\nWhen  these  businesses have identified opportunities  in\r\n\r\nChina,  they  bring  along  their  suppliers  with  them.\r\n\r\nTogether, they almost replicate their entire supply chain\r\n\r\nin China, ensuring a better chance of success.  They work\r\n\r\nwith  people they know best.  They link hands and venture\r\n\r\nout  together.  It is a united approach with all  parties\r\n\r\nbenefitting   -   an  interesting  business  model  worth\r\n\r\nconsidering for us in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our GLCs have a strong home base and are better\r\n\r\nplaced  to venture abroad.  They also have the management\r\n\r\nand  financial capabilities.  So, what is stopping  these\r\n\r\nGLCs from bringing along their local suppliers along with\r\n\r\nthem?   It  may mean to be more proactive in  identifying\r\n\r\ngood SME suppliers with potential to be part of a winning\r\n\r\ncombination.  It may also mean helping these suppliers by\r\n\r\nequipping  them  with  the  know-how  to  improve   their\r\n\r\nefficiency or management, so that they are more ready  to\r\n\r\nweather  the  perils beyond our shores.  This  will  help\r\n\r\nshorten  the SMEs learning curve by being able  to  piggy\r\n\r\nback on the GLCs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In SME 21, the often mentioned structural weaknesses\r\n\r\nof  the SMEs tend to be centred around inefficient use of\r\n\r\ntechnology,  outmoded  methods  of  production,   limited\r\n\r\nability   to   tap  economies  of  scale,   shortage   of\r\n\r\nprofessional   and   technical   manpower,   insufficient\r\n\r\nmanagement  know-how and professionalism.  I believe  the\r\n\r\nemergence  of a partnering culture between the  GLCs  and\r\n\r\nthe  SMEs  would  mitigate,  to  a  large  extent,  these\r\n\r\nstructural issues.  It has to start with the building  of\r\n\r\ntrust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SME 21 plan intends to treble the number of SMEs\r\n\r\nwith  sales  turnover of $10 million or  more  to  6,000.\r\n\r\nWith   such  growth,  I  believe  that  there  are  great\r\n\r\nopportunities   that  exist,  and  these  cannot   remain\r\n\r\nuntapped, just because no one makes the first move or  we\r\n\r\nare  focusing  our  energies on  only  competing  amongst\r\n\r\nourselves.   IE  Singapore's  Network  China   has   been\r\n\r\nsuccessful  and Network India is being set up.   Can  the\r\n\r\nGLCs  not  partner some SMEs and tap into  these  markets\r\n\r\ntogether?   Perhaps IE Singapore can play the matchmaker,\r\n\r\nand it must have mechanisms in place, so that the concern\r\n\r\nof  appearing  to be partial whenever one  SME  is  being\r\n\r\nselected over another does not hold back initiatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clusters created to foray overseas must be based on\r\n\r\ngood  business  case with the best  chance  to  win.   To\r\n\r\nconsciously  make this happen, we should reorientate  our\r\n\r\nview of GLCs and judge them on how much their business is\r\n\r\nderived  offshore  and  how many  local  SMEs  they  have\r\n\r\nspawned or partner with in their ventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is an economy that has seen a rapid\r\n\r\ntransformation  from  third  to  first   world   in   one\r\n\r\ngeneration.   It  is unparalleled.  We  are  unique  with\r\n\r\nunique  strengths and constraints.  In  short,  we  learn\r\n\r\nfrom  others  but  we  need  to  adapt.   In  trying   to\r\n\r\ntransform, we must not throw out the baby with  the  bath\r\n\r\nwater,  as this is said three times today.  We  must  not\r\n\r\nslay  all  our  sacred cows and then  discover  that  the\r\n\r\nalternatives are stillborn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we must remember that we are Team\r\n\r\nSingapore.   In a team, there are defenders,  midfielders\r\n\r\nand  attackers.   The  ultimate goal  is  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  win.   In-fighting amongst  the  players  to  get\r\n\r\nchoice  roles will just jeopardise our chance of winning.\r\n\r\nWe  are  Team Singapore and in the SME 21 plan, which  is\r\n\r\ncharacterised   as  a  partnership  between   Government,\r\n\r\nChambers  of  Commerce,  industry  associations  and  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector, it should also be expanded to include the\r\n\r\nGLCs  as  well.   We  are  no longer  only  playing  home\r\n\r\nmatches.   We  are in a global match.  And  in  the  away\r\n\r\ngames,  we  must train to win.  While the  debate  is  on\r\n\r\nGLCs,  I  think there is and must have resolve to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat the momentum behind SME 21 does not fizzle out.   We\r\n\r\nmust stay the course.  As in the ecosystem analogy that I\r\n\r\nstarted  with, a symbiotic relationship with  competition\r\n\r\nin  specific  niche areas will have  to  be  one  of  our\r\n\r\nformulae  for  going forward.  So, in  the  Motion  which\r\n\r\nsupports  competition,  which nourishes  the  spirit  and\r\n\r\nculture  of  partnerships, and which  squarely  sets  the\r\n\r\nsight on the external wing, I am supportive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  thank  you  for allowing me  to  join  in  this\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raison d'etre of GLCs and Temasek has been well\r\n\r\ndocumented.  The reasons for the GLCs' existence was when\r\n\r\nthe SMEs were not able to access capital on their own, or\r\n\r\nthere  were  insufficient  entrepreneurs  that  had   the\r\n\r\ncapacity  to  risk  large quantum of capital.   Singapore\r\n\r\nthen needed the GLCs to build up the strategic industries\r\n\r\nto  put  Singapore  on  firm economic,  social  and  even\r\n\r\npolitical  pedestals.   It was for  the  sole  reason  of\r\n\r\nsurvival,  and the GLCs have done a good job.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nthey  were so good at what they do that, over the  years,\r\n\r\nthe  GLCs  have  grown to cover a multitude  of  business\r\n\r\nenterprises  -  many of which are perceptibly  to  be  in\r\n\r\ndirect  competition with the private  sector.   After  37\r\n\r\nyears  of  independence and rapid  economic  growth,  our\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  is also a lot more mature  and  capable.\r\n\r\nCoupled with the challenges of the new economy in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nglobal  playing  field, we need to re-examine  our  modus\r\n\r\noperandi,  and make relevant the roles of both  the  GLCs\r\n\r\nand  the  SMEs, so that we, as a nation, can  strive  and\r\n\r\nthrive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, I also have an analogy which is based\r\n\r\non  the ecosystem.  Since we are an island, please  allow\r\n\r\nme  to  use the analogy of fish and water.  The GLCs  are\r\n\r\nlike fishes that were originally introduced to a pond  to\r\n\r\npromote  life, to  promote growth.  Over time,  it  keeps\r\n\r\nspawning  and  while  the  pond  can  still  maintain  an\r\n\r\necological  balance for coexistence, it  remains  placid.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the spawned fishes begin to grow and become\r\n\r\noverwhelming, the ecological balance within the  pond  is\r\n\r\ndisturbed.  It has now reached the point where  the  pond\r\n\r\nhas  become  too  small for this growing  ecosystem.   In\r\n\r\norder  to survive, the big will eat the small fishes  and\r\n\r\neven   compete  with  its  own  kind  to  survive.    The\r\n\r\necological system is out of balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Scepticism and Distrust: Playing Field</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the private sector reckons the GLCs to be the\r\n\r\nfishes that have multiplied and grown to a monstrous size\r\n\r\nin a small pond.  Willy-nilly, there appears to be a two-way  scepticism and distrust between the big fish  (GLCs)\r\n\r\nand  the  small  fish (SMEs).  In fact, some  SMEs  avoid\r\n\r\ncontact  with  the  GLCs whenever  there  is  a  business\r\n\r\nopportunity for fear that the GLCs may muscle them out of\r\n\r\nthe business.  This may well be true as GLCs function  as\r\n\r\na  profit organisation, and have often demonstrated  that\r\n\r\nnew  entities can be created whenever they want  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  an  opportunity.   Without  the  necessary\r\n\r\nfinancial  muscles  and network, the  SME  simply  cannot\r\n\r\nreplicate companies with the same speed or size that GLCs\r\n\r\ncan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate, we have a GLC that prepares,\r\n\r\nmanufactures  and distributes food, ranging from  chilled\r\n\r\nmeat,  ready-to-go meals and even right up to hog auction\r\n\r\nand abattoir.  The original raison d'etre of this GLC was\r\n\r\none of strategic defence.  But how does the slaughtering\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof hogs contribute to the defence of Singapore?  GLCs are\r\n\r\nalso   found  in  other  non-strategic  industries,   for\r\n\r\nexample,   Internet  Service  Provider,  travel   agency,\r\n\r\nsupermarket,  real estate development and management,  IT\r\n\r\nand    business    consultancy,   systems    integration,\r\n\r\noutsourcing  networking, e-commerce, and  so  on  and  so\r\n\r\nforth.  Even more recently, HDB, via its subsidiary firm,\r\n\r\nHDBay,  is  also  getting  into the  Local  Area  Network\r\n\r\nbusiness!   In fact, if we include the NLCs, which  is  a\r\n\r\nterm coined by Mr Leong Horn Kee, they provide goods  and\r\n\r\nservices  from cradle to grave.  Can we really blame  the\r\n\r\nSMEs  for keeping a distance from the GLCs?  Perhaps,  to\r\n\r\nbe  fair to the GLCs, such companies were created so that\r\n\r\nthe GLCs can have better control and it could be part  of\r\n\r\nthe risk management strategy.  But this is also precisely\r\n\r\nwhere   the  problem  lies.   If  we  want  to  cultivate\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship, then this mindset must change, both  on\r\n\r\nthe  SME side and GLC side.  Some things are indeed  much\r\n\r\nbetter  left to the private sector.  And we need to  have\r\n\r\nmore faith in the market forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Foster Culture of Partnership</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond SMEs, beyond GLCs, we as a nation in\r\n\r\nchallenging  times must come to sell all  enterprises  as\r\n\r\nvaluable to our economic aspirations.  We need to  see  a\r\n\r\nvibrant  culture  of cooperation and partnership  between\r\n\r\nGLCs and SMEs.  They both can and must play their role in\r\n\r\nthe  remaking  of our economic thrust and should  receive\r\n\r\nequal facilitation and support from the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue on my imagery analogy of the fish and\r\n\r\nwater,  I  would like to see the Government, and  perhaps\r\n\r\neven  Temasek  Holdings, provide the  lead  to  ease  the\r\n\r\ncongestion  in this small pond, by digging a trench  that\r\n\r\nwould  provide alternatives to the contents of this small\r\n\r\npond  into the open sea of the global economy.  Once  the\r\n\r\nmonstrous  fishes in this small pond enter the open  sea,\r\n\r\nthey  may no longer be that big.  This is where the  GLCs\r\n\r\nand SMEs can come together, support each other and assert\r\n\r\nthemselves in the new environment.  I urge the Government\r\n\r\nto adopt the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecommendation  of the EISC to \"encourage  a  culture  of\r\n\r\npartnership  between  GLCs, MNCs and  SMEs  and  adopt  a\r\n\r\ncluster  approach when venturing overseas; and raise  the\r\n\r\nprofile of the Local Industry Upgrading Programme  (LIUP)\r\n\r\nand  expanding  it to promote internationalisation.\"   We\r\n\r\nneed a paradigm shift, we need to promote partnership  as\r\n\r\na multiplier, and not a zero sum game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as Mr Inderjit Singh had also said, we need\r\n\r\nto  leverage on each other's strength, in order to  grow.\r\n\r\nThe  SMEs, given their business instincts and acumen, can\r\n\r\nsniff  out the business opportunities while the GLCs  can\r\n\r\nalso  support with their know-how and process  expertise.\r\n\r\nThe  GLCs, with their good brand name, can also pull  the\r\n\r\nSMEs  along  while establishing a beach-head  on  foreign\r\n\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I urge that the Government also urgently\r\n\r\nfacilitate outlets for these monstrous fishes  and  guide\r\n\r\nthem  towards  the  open  sea.   The  movement  of  these\r\n\r\nmonstrous  fishes  would  stir the  seabed,  throwing  up\r\n\r\nplanktons  and  living  organisms  to  feed  the  smaller\r\n\r\nfishes.   In time, these smaller fishes will be  able  to\r\n\r\ngrow,  be  able to fend for themselves and even establish\r\n\r\ntheir  own  pedigree, their own brand.  I do not  support\r\n\r\nthe  exodus of GLCs, but that GLCs should stick to  their\r\n\r\noriginal  reason for existence, and divest  the  non-core\r\n\r\nbusinesses at a reasonable price over a reasonable period\r\n\r\nof  time.   May I also add that any drastic movement  may\r\n\r\nalso upset the ecosystem in question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with Mrs Lim Hwee Hua's point that we\r\n\r\nshould  focus  on the GNP and not just the  GDP.   I  am,\r\n\r\nhowever,  also  mindful that part of the  GNP  must  also\r\n\r\noriginate  from the domestic sector.  Hence, there  is  a\r\n\r\nneed to find a place for our private sector, the SMEs and\r\n\r\nthe  MNCs, on the continuum between the maximum  position\r\n\r\nof  crowding  out  the  private sector  and  the  minimum\r\n\r\nposition  of non-interference.  A place between  the  two\r\n\r\nwhere  we  can  find the optimum.  In a  world  of  rapid\r\n\r\nchanges, this continuum is dynamic, and so is the optimum\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly when we look at the reason for existence can we then\r\n\r\nfind the optimum point between the two extreme points.  I\r\n\r\nsubmit to this House, Mdm Deputy Speaker, that unless  we\r\n\r\nconsciously and continually seek this equilibrium or this\r\n\r\noptimum  point,  we  will  eventually  lose  our  private\r\n\r\nsector's  creativity and competitiveness.   It  would  be\r\n\r\nworse  if  the  private sector allows their  perceptions,\r\n\r\nwhether  rightly  or wrongly, to fester  and  lead  to  a\r\n\r\nculture  of cynicism.  It may lead to an outward movement\r\n\r\nof not just capital, but also people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that we do not let the GLCs take the\r\n\r\nwind out of the sails of the SMEs, but to help them build\r\n\r\nand  direct the sails to catch the wind instead.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  GLCs can take some of our SMEs under their wings and\r\n\r\nstart  a  mentorship programme.  Impart their experiences\r\n\r\nand  know-how  to  the  private  sector  and  provide   a\r\n\r\nspringboard  for  our  private  sector  to  leapfrog  the\r\n\r\nlearning curve.  The question, of course, is if both  are\r\n\r\nfor profit organisations, then what is in it for me?  Why\r\n\r\nshould  the  GLCs do so?  I think besides  being  a  good\r\n\r\ncorporate  citizen,  GLCs can also  profit  by  taking  a\r\n\r\nminority  stake in these companies.  In turn,  the  stake\r\n\r\nmoney  will enhance the capital base for the SMEs.   When\r\n\r\nthe  SMEs are successful, they will then in turn  give  a\r\n\r\nreturn to the stake money of the GLCs.  This process  can\r\n\r\nalso  be  vice versa where the SMEs could take a minority\r\n\r\nstake  in  the GLCs.  It could be a win-win strategy.   I\r\n\r\nalso  support Mr Wee Siew Kim's call for a bridge  to  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  between the GLCs and the SMEs, perhaps a forum  as\r\n\r\nwell  and  even  his  call for a  business  SDU.   And  I\r\n\r\nsuppose, even if the business SDU can bring together some\r\n\r\nmarriage of convenience, it would have served its role.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another often heard feedback from the SMEs is the\r\n\r\nlack   of  support  when  venturing  overseas.   Can   IE\r\n\r\nSingapore  then  act as a facilitator  for  our  SMEs  in\r\n\r\nlinking  up  with our embassies, trade missions  or  even\r\n\r\ntrade  stations abroad, to serve as a launch pad for  our\r\n\r\nSMEs'  foray into the foreign market?  Our embassies  and\r\n\r\ntrade  missions  are well placed to give an  insight,  at\r\n\r\nleast, into the culture\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  local  knowledge in these foreign lands.  Just  like\r\n\r\nforeign  companies coming into Singapore can obtain  one-stop information and help from EDB, could IE Singapore or\r\n\r\nany   other   Government  agencies  provide   appropriate\r\n\r\ninformation  and  database to facilitate  some  of  these\r\n\r\noverseas  ventures?  This would serve our  SMEs  in  good\r\n\r\nstead,  giving  them  a competitive  edge  with  reliable\r\n\r\nsupport and good grade information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the GLCs have to compete with the private sector,\r\n\r\nlet it then be the objective of bringing up the standards\r\n\r\nof  our private sector.  If there is a need for the  GLCs\r\n\r\nto  compete, let it then be out of a need and not  greed.\r\n\r\nIf  there is a need for GLCs to compete, then let  it  be\r\n\r\nfrom without and not within.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to conclude by\r\n\r\nreferring to the latest debate on stayers and quitters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had opportunities to speak with many of our\r\n\r\ncorporate  citizens  who are actually  SMEs.   These  are\r\n\r\ncorporations  that  have grown over the  years.   I  have\r\n\r\nsought their permission to quote them.  Some of them I am\r\n\r\nreferring to are System Access Ltd, Technology  and  Apex\r\n\r\nSystems  Pte  Ltd  and  this  company  called  Lindeteves\r\n\r\nJacobsberg Ltd, which is one company that specialises  in\r\n\r\nelectronic  motors,  and  they  are  the  third   largest\r\n\r\nsupplier  to  Europe.  For these companies  that  I  have\r\n\r\nquoted,  they  derive the majority of their  revenue,  in\r\n\r\nsome  cases,  100%  of  their  revenue  outside  that  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   However, they are maintaining an  office  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   In fact, there is no compelling  reason  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  do  so, but they did.  The refrain  from  these\r\n\r\ncorporations  was that Singapore is their own.   This  is\r\n\r\nthe  place where they have sunk their roots and  this  is\r\n\r\nthe place where they would like their children to grow up\r\n\r\nin.    They  are  here  because  their  hearts  are  with\r\n\r\nSingapore.   However,  they also expressed  that  if  the\r\n\r\nissues that were brought up by the EISC Committee are not\r\n\r\nproperly addressed, then in the long term, there may  not\r\n\r\nbe  a  lot  of  stayers purely because it  is  no  longer\r\n\r\neconomically viable to stay in Singapore.  Once they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstart  to  venture abroad, make their stake abroad,  what\r\n\r\nmay  happen  is in the process, they will start  to  lose\r\n\r\ntouch with Singapore.  And the heart stops where survival\r\n\r\nis  choked.   So when they leave Singapore  for  economic\r\n\r\ngains,  they asked not to be blamed.  Quitting is  not  a\r\n\r\nsudden  decision, but it is a process that  may  lead  to\r\n\r\nthat decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these views, I support the Motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate be now adjourned.

There is a shortage of social workers and we  all\r\n\r\nknow  that.  Just to illustrate the severity - two recent\r\n\r\nreports in the newspapers attest to this - Straits  Times\r\n\r\nin  January  and  another in June in the NewPaper.   Both\r\n\r\ncarried reports that only four out of 10 in every  cohort\r\n\r\nof   graduates  from  the  Social  Work  and   Psychology\r\n\r\nDepartment  at  the  National  University  of   Singapore\r\n\r\nactually enter the field to work as social workers.   And\r\n\r\nI  am  told that in three to five years' time about  half\r\n\r\nfrom  each cohort of these graduates who enter the  field\r\n\r\nto  work as social workers then leave the service,  often\r\n\r\nciting burn-out as a reason.  Yet, it is estimated in the\r\n\r\nsame  Straits  Times' article that,  each  year,  40  new\r\n\r\npositions go a-begging for social workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure does not take into account the number of\r\n\r\nvacant positions due to resignations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do these figures mean in reality? The National\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Singapore admits about 150 students  each\r\n\r\nyear  major  in social work at the Department  of  Social\r\n\r\nWork  and Psychology.  Almost 50 new graduates, qualified\r\n\r\nin  social  work, go on to become social workers  -  that\r\n\r\nfour in 10 figure. Of this group, in three or five years'\r\n\r\ntime,  perhaps, only 25 will remain in the  workforce  as\r\n\r\nsocial  workers.     This is a shortage.  It is worrying.\r\n\r\nAdd  to it, another dimension.  Looking at the nature  of\r\n\r\nthe  degree  in  social work under  the  current  modular\r\n\r\nstructure  and  the  liberal  arts  approach  within  the\r\n\r\nFaculty  of  Arts  and  Social Science  at  the  National\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Singapore, students can graduate  with  a\r\n\r\ndegree  in social work by fulfilling a minimum  quota  of\r\n\r\neight  core modules out of the 24 modules offered by  the\r\n\r\ndepartment.  This is well and good for students who  wish\r\n\r\nto diversify and keep their career options open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when these same graduates enter the social\r\n\r\nservice  sector to work as social workers - listening  to\r\n\r\nwhat  academics and practitioners on the ground have told\r\n\r\nme - they are still lacking in skills that will give them\r\n\r\nthe  depth to deal with clients effectively.  Hence,  the\r\n\r\ndilemma.  A tight labour market where the social  workers\r\n\r\nscene  is concerned and new graduates who cannot  prepare\r\n\r\nto  go  on  to further immediate training to become  more\r\n\r\ncompetent in this field.  In fact, figures from MCDS  and\r\n\r\nthe  National  Council  of Social  Service  in  newspaper\r\n\r\nreports  two  years  ago  showed  that  30%  of  its  550\r\n\r\nprofessionals in the social service sector  do  not  have\r\n\r\nsocial  work  qualifications.  Add to  that  the  current\r\n\r\ngroup  of  community  development  officers,  who  number\r\n\r\nbetween  10  and 40, at the five CDCs, who  work  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity to help the less fortunate, with very few among\r\n\r\nthem  trained in social work.  So not only do we  have  a\r\n\r\nshortage  but we also have a situation where some  social\r\n\r\nworkers,  new  graduates, already need more  training  to\r\n\r\nfunction more effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us also look at another group of professionals\r\n\r\nwho  are  making  their inroad into  the  social  service\r\n\r\nsector,  the much needed group of - the psychotherapists,\r\n\r\nfamily  therapists,  counsellors,  psychologists.   While\r\n\r\nthese  individuals  enter the  field  with  the  best  of\r\n\r\nintentions,  there must also be a way  to  ascertain  the\r\n\r\nnature  of  their  qualifications to  maintain  standards\r\n\r\nwithin the social service sector.  I am told that some of\r\n\r\nthe  post-graduate degrees, doctorates and  certificates,\r\n\r\ncome  from institutions that practitioners do not totally\r\n\r\nendorse.   Moreover, such professionals have  many  entry\r\n\r\npoints  into  the service - being appointed by  voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare  organisations, schools and  other  institutions,\r\n\r\nwhich having the autonomy make such appointments and  peg\r\n\r\ntheir  salaries  to  the qualifications  and  experience.\r\n\r\nWhile it is good to have this autonomy it also gives rise\r\n\r\nto  approval  of  a  range  of qualifications  which  has\r\n\r\nalready raised questions at the ground level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, it is my suggestion that the four\r\n\r\norganisations catering  to the different\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprofessionals in the social service sector,  namely,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Association  of  Social  Workers  (SASW),  the\r\n\r\nPsychological Society, the Society of Marital  Therapists\r\n\r\nand  Psychotherapists  and the Singapore  Association  of\r\n\r\nCounselling,   work  with  the  Ministry   of   Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment and Sports and the National Council of Social\r\n\r\nService   to   build  up  a  common   registry   and   an\r\n\r\naccreditation  scheme for both short-term  and  long-term\r\n\r\ncourses,  such  that officers will be well-qualified  and\r\n\r\ncan  be  employed with similar salary packages pegged  to\r\n\r\ntheir qualifications that are approved, and come under an\r\n\r\napproved scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to suggest that the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development  and Sports  could  also  look  at\r\n\r\ninfrastructure and beef up an existing organisation - The\r\n\r\nFamily  Resource  Training Centre  -  or  work  with  the\r\n\r\nNational  University  of  Singapore  to  restructure  the\r\n\r\nDepartment of Social Work and Psychology into  a  faculty\r\n\r\non its own or a training/research centre on its own, akin\r\n\r\nto  the  National  Institute of  Education,  that  trains\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just elaborate the advantage in that. With\r\n\r\nsuch  a  centre,  curriculum can be well-planned.   There\r\n\r\nwill   be  enough  scope  and  expertise  to  expand   on\r\n\r\nprogrammes, such that existing officers can come back  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  their skills and, at the same time, it can  also\r\n\r\nbring  on  board quite a number of counsellors out  there\r\n\r\nand  upgrade  them all to a certain set  of  standardised\r\n\r\ncourse  skills.  After all, what is there to  stop  this.\r\n\r\nBecause,  right now, teachers have NIE, the lawyers-to-be\r\n\r\nhave  their  own Law Faculty, the medical  students  have\r\n\r\ntheir Medical Faculty.  Why should social workers be  any\r\n\r\ndifferent?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a one-stop faculty, or centre, can handle all\r\n\r\nmatters  related  to training and accreditation  for  all\r\n\r\nprofessionals.   This centre can be  modelled  after  the\r\n\r\nwell-reputed  George Warren Brown School of Social  Work,\r\n\r\nan  entity unto itself at the University of Washington to\r\n\r\nwhich, I think, the Ministry sends quite a number of  its\r\n\r\nofficers for upgrading skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, let me now move on to the second\r\n\r\nissue here of how\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe recognise and reward those who stay in the profession.\r\n\r\nA  new  social  work graduate receives a  median  monthly\r\n\r\nsalary of $2,114 as the starting salary, according to the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower's Report on Wages in Singapore 2000,\r\n\r\nas was reported in the newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A check with VWOs on the National Council of Social\r\n\r\nService  suggested wage rates show that a  social  worker\r\n\r\nwith  a general degree starts off with a gross salary  of\r\n\r\nbetween  $1,844 and $1,972.  A teacher in  training  gets\r\n\r\nbetween  $1,967  and  $2,144 for the  same  qualification\r\n\r\nwhile training to be a teacher at the NIE.  A nurse  with\r\n\r\na  degree  in  nursing  has his/her  starting  salary  as\r\n\r\n$1,800.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social workers lot is a tough lot, as every\r\n\r\nprofession  would say.  But I think when you are  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  the vulnerable in society, it can be very tough  on\r\n\r\nthe  individual  social  worker.   Hence,  the  burn-out.\r\n\r\nHence, the drop-outs.  Hence, the attrition rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going further, while these salaries are there, let\r\n\r\nus  look  at the workload.  Although salaries are perhaps\r\n\r\nnot as attractive as other vocations, the workload of the\r\n\r\nsocial  worker  is  not  diminishing.   In  fact,  it  is\r\n\r\nincreasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A check with five FSCs for the month of July alone\r\n\r\nshows  that each centre now handles between eight and  10\r\n\r\nnew  cases  a  month  while each  social  worker  manages\r\n\r\nbetween  30  and 40 cases per month.  About  a  fifth  of\r\n\r\nthese  cases  are to be closed in a year  by  the  social\r\n\r\nworkers.   Social workers average about four at  each  of\r\n\r\nthese centres.  They said their time-consuming cases  are\r\n\r\nthose dealing with marital and parenting problems.   They\r\n\r\nsaid that the cases, especially in the first half of this\r\n\r\nyear,  have also doubled because many clients are  coming\r\n\r\nin with their financial problems.  So that is the current\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going further to policies that have been implemented\r\n\r\nin   recent   years.   With  greater  enlightenment   and\r\n\r\nappreciation, the courts today rule mandatory counselling\r\n\r\nfor juveniles beyond parental control,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviolent  spouses and couples going for  a  divorce.   All\r\n\r\nthese cases do land at the social workers door.  Going by\r\n\r\nstatistics  on  social trends, we can see  the  potential\r\n\r\nincrease  in workload for social workers - the number  of\r\n\r\ndivorces or separations has doubled in the last 10  years\r\n\r\nfrom 1.3% in 1990 to 2.5% in the year 2000; the number of\r\n\r\njuvenile  delinquents had risen last year  to  31.4%  per\r\n\r\n100,000   young  people,  though  arrests  have   fallen;\r\n\r\nviolence  in the home still averages at about  six  cases\r\n\r\nevery  day, according to police statistics.  With greater\r\n\r\nawareness,  there will be more reports on rapes,  incest,\r\n\r\netc,  cases that cannot be wrapped up in five counselling\r\n\r\nsessions,  cases  that make a demand  on  the  individual\r\n\r\nsocial  worker on his/her own emotional and psychological\r\n\r\nmake-up and energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then there are our national trends. Also, with\r\n\r\nan  ageing population and a widening income gap, all this\r\n\r\nwill  just mean more at the social workers door.  So what\r\n\r\nthen  can we do about all these?  To deal with such cases\r\n\r\nand with rising sophistication in a Singapore client,  it\r\n\r\nbecomes  very  important for the social workers  to  keep\r\n\r\nabreast of the latest counselling skills.  And also,  the\r\n\r\nMCDS advocates family interventionist programme to handle\r\n\r\nclients effectively.  These are time consuming.  So if we\r\n\r\njust  look  at  all  that impinges on  a  social  worker,\r\n\r\nincreased case load, time consuming cases, cases that are\r\n\r\nbecoming  more complex, skills that you want  to  acquire\r\n\r\nbut  are  too  tight  for  time to  acquire  and  not  so\r\n\r\nfavourable salary package, I do not think things sound so\r\n\r\nrosy at all for the social worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the situation where the salary is\r\n\r\nconcerned, I am told that, currently, the social worker's\r\n\r\nsalary  package is a 10% lag behind those senior officers\r\n\r\nin  the  civil  service.  Bear with me, I  know  time  is\r\n\r\nticking by, just to study the background a bit on how the\r\n\r\nsalaries  have  been pegged for the social  workers.   In\r\n\r\n1995, the salaries of social workers were aligned to that\r\n\r\nof the civil service's Senior Officers' Scheme.  In 2000,\r\n\r\nvoluntary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwelfare   organisations  (VWOs)  adopted  the  NWC   wage\r\n\r\nadjustment  scheme used by the civil service.   But  then\r\n\r\nthe   civil   service  moved  ahead  again  and   further\r\n\r\nimplemented  salary  revisions  for  its  superscale  and\r\n\r\ntimescale   officers.   Performance  bonuses  were   also\r\n\r\nintroduced.  Currently, VWOs are grappling with  what  it\r\n\r\nmeans to have performance bonuses and an appraisal scheme\r\n\r\nthat  should follow that.  So with all these schemes that\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service has put in, social  workers  have  to\r\n\r\ncatch  up  all  the time where salaries  and  performance\r\n\r\nbonuses are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As social workers work in different fields - in\r\n\r\nhospitals, in schools, in VWOs and also, now, in  CDCs  - their  salaries are adjusted by the various  institutions\r\n\r\nthat  they  work in.  There are disparities,  and  social\r\n\r\nworkers do compare which institution is providing  better\r\n\r\nfor  them.   This  does  not augur well  for  the  social\r\n\r\nworkers.   It  is  perhaps timely that  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity Development and Sports, NCSS, MOE, MOH, as well\r\n\r\nas  the  PA,  could  come together  to  plan  the  career\r\n\r\ndevelopment  structure for social workers,  as  has  been\r\n\r\ndone  for teachers under the Ministry of Education,  look\r\n\r\nat  the  salary structures that they should be having  as\r\n\r\nwell as the training schemes that they can enjoy and look\r\n\r\nat  a  massive recruitment drive, such that this shortage\r\n\r\ncan be weaning the way in the next few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, I am sure, the Ministry is already thinking of\r\n\r\nfrom  what  I  hear.  I would like at the  same  time  to\r\n\r\nemphasise  that  recruiting males  must  also  be  a  top\r\n\r\npriority here.  Because we have a lot of cases of spousal\r\n\r\nviolence,  children  who  need that  kind  of  male  role\r\n\r\nmodelling  even  within the social service  sector,  male\r\n\r\nsocial workers whom spouses can talk to, etc.  Currently,\r\n\r\nwe have too few males in the social service sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this career development plan, which is in the\r\n\r\nmaking  I  hear, should also look into ways of recruiting\r\n\r\nmales  into  the service too as their help is  needed  to\r\n\r\noffer  counselling to violent spouses, many of  whom  are\r\n\r\nmales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is already making some headway. Its\r\n\r\nefforts are appreciated in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  it  has increased funding through a VWO  Capability\r\n\r\nFund  of $30 million and recently another $7 million  was\r\n\r\nadded  for  80  VWOs to run programmes.  All  this  means\r\n\r\nstaff  can  be  paid to run programmes and staff  can  be\r\n\r\nretained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, without a systematic structure defining a\r\n\r\nsocial  worker's career path, the training  needs  and  a\r\n\r\nrevised  salary  structure that  can  be  applied  across\r\n\r\nemployers, these gestures run the risk of becoming  band-aids, short-term solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professionals in the social service sector are not\r\n\r\nvolunteers,  and it is not morally right of  us  to  look\r\n\r\ninto this issue without trying to give them the best deal\r\n\r\nwhen  they  are  coping with a very vulnerable  community\r\n\r\nwithin our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this revision, may I also suggest that the\r\n\r\nMinistry   needs  to  re-examine  its  50-50   co-funding\r\n\r\nstructure  that  it shares with the National  Council  of\r\n\r\nSocial  Service, the reason being that when it is  pegged\r\n\r\nat  50-50,  the Council does not have the flexibility  to\r\n\r\nreward  social  workers  adequately  and  the  cycle   is\r\n\r\nperpetuated.  Since I am at liberty to suggest a ratio, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to suggest that this be 70-30 or  80-20,  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  whole  scheme  can improve  from  a  bottom-up\r\n\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next area which I would like to draw attention\r\n\r\nto  is  the  role  of  the  social service  professional.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  this  shortage,  social  workers  are  often\r\n\r\nfunctioning  as  just  doers, meaning  appraising  client\r\n\r\nneeds, sourcing for help, and counselling them.  However,\r\n\r\nwe  are  ignoring a greater and more fundamental role  of\r\n\r\nthe  social worker - preventive programmes.  They are the\r\n\r\nprofessionals  in  the field, with  more  experience  and\r\n\r\nenergy  that we can tap on to design programmes.  We  can\r\n\r\nuse  their management skills, etc, to further develop the\r\n\r\nnon-profit  sector, get deeper into research,  such  that\r\n\r\nthe   social  worker  can  become  a  stronger  advocate,\r\n\r\ncommenting on the community's needs.

But when there is not enough\r\n\r\ntime  and  too  much  work, they run  the  risk  of  just\r\n\r\nbecoming doers, and so we do ignore the pleas from people\r\n\r\nwhom we do not normally hear about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to suggest that we can tap the\r\n\r\nexpertise   of  the  social  workers  to  develop   joint\r\n\r\ncurriculum   projects   with  the   various   Ministries,\r\n\r\nespecially   the   Ministry  of  Education,   such   that\r\n\r\ncommunication  skills,  one of the  fundamental  problems\r\n\r\nalways faced by social workers, are put into place within\r\n\r\nthe school system in a directed manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to suggest to the Ministry that\r\n\r\nthere  is  right now a window of opportunity to plug  the\r\n\r\ngap  where  the  shortage is concerned, by enhancing  and\r\n\r\ndeveloping a para-counselling layer with help  from  NUS,\r\n\r\nNanyang  Polytechnic and the unions.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports (Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Thank you, Mdm\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker,  for allowing me to  respond.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike, first, to thank Ms Braema Mathiaparanam for raising\r\n\r\nall  the  suggestions.  I do agree with her  that  social\r\n\r\nworkers  are an important professional component  in  the\r\n\r\nsocial  service sector.  I would like to assure her  that\r\n\r\nas  I  may  not  be  able to answer all  of  her  queries\r\n\r\ntonight,  we will look into her suggestions and  that  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  and NCSS will consider actively the  suggestion\r\n\r\nshe  has  made  in  areas such as social workers'  career\r\n\r\ndevelopment and professional upgrading.  And to  consider\r\n\r\nsome of the suggestions that she has made as we develop a\r\n\r\nmaster plan for the social worker community in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just touch on a few things first, beginning\r\n\r\nwith  the last, because that is the first thing that  one\r\n\r\ncan  remember.  The hon. Member spoke about the  role  of\r\n\r\nsocial  workers beyond merely being part  of  the  social\r\n\r\ndelivery system, but their expertise and knowledge can be\r\n\r\ntapped.  I certainly agree with Ms Braema that we  should\r\n\r\nlook  towards  the  social workers in  terms  of  getting\r\n\r\ndirect  feedback and knowledge on the problems they  face\r\n\r\nand the kind of skills that they need.  I understand that\r\n\r\nthis  is something that is on-going between the VWOs  and\r\n\r\nNCSS where there is constant dialogue and discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether or not we can tap their expertise in\r\n\r\nterms   of   her   first  suggestion,  of  developing   a\r\n\r\ncurriculum,  I think we should consider  it.   I  am  not\r\n\r\nclear about the format, but it is something which we  can\r\n\r\ncertainly work towards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Ms Braema's point about plugging the\r\n\r\ngap by ensuring that there are enough para-counsellors, I\r\n\r\ncertainly  agree with that.  I am not familiar about  the\r\n\r\ncertificate  programme that she mentioned,  but  I  would\r\n\r\ncertainly  look  into  that  as  I  do  know  that   some\r\n\r\norganisations  have actually looked into  training  their\r\n\r\nown  para-counsellors because of the shortage  of  social\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the first point the hon. Member\r\n\r\nhas  raised  is a very important point - the shortage  of\r\n\r\nsocial  workers  and how we recognise them.   As  Members\r\n\r\nmight  know,  we have launched the VCF $30 million  fund.\r\n\r\nJust  to clarify:  the $7 million annually is an increase\r\n\r\nin  funding that we gave to VWOs this year.  So there  is\r\n\r\nmoney that is available to the VWOs at this point in time\r\n\r\nfor them to use in terms of research, training, etc.   We\r\n\r\nhave  also  launched, with the Ministry of Manpower,  the\r\n\r\nStrategic Conversion Manpower Programme in order to train\r\n\r\npeople who wish to convert from whatever occupation  they\r\n\r\nwere in, into social work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we do have a plan in place to address these\r\n\r\nissues. Overall, I agree with Ms Braema that there  is  a\r\n\r\nneed  for  a master plan, which NCSS is looking into.  We\r\n\r\nneed  to  develop  something which is more  comprehensive\r\n\r\nfrom  the point at which they graduate from NUS,  to  the\r\n\r\npoint  that they begin to work, and the sort of  training\r\n\r\nthey will need.  This is something which we will have  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up  over  time.  Ms Braema mentioned  about  FRTC,\r\n\r\nwhich  is a good example of a setting within the  VWO  to\r\n\r\nprovide  training for social workers.   There  have  been\r\n\r\nsome  suggestions  about  setting  up  a  social  service\r\n\r\ntraining institute.  This is also currently being studied\r\n\r\nas  to  whether there is a need for a training  institute\r\n\r\nfor  people  to  go to get new skills and  new  knowledge\r\n\r\nabout what is going on.  As mentioned by Ms Braema, there\r\n\r\nare  now  social trends which are developing, and  social\r\n\r\nworkers need to be kept abreast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master plan is not ready yet. The thrust of the\r\n\r\nmaster plan is to look at the overall development of  the\r\n\r\nprofessional social worker, from the time he graduates to\r\n\r\nthe time he goes out into the field, and how he works his\r\n\r\nway  through the VWOs.  I cannot promise that we can  get\r\n\r\nmale  social  workers.  We will try our  very  best.   As\r\n\r\nMembers  know,  we have tried to address the  problem  of\r\n\r\nshortage  of social workers by providing scholarships  to\r\n\r\nNUS  for  people to gain some expertise in  social  work,\r\n\r\nboth  at the undergraduate and the Master's level.  These\r\n\r\nare some of the efforts that we have put in place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether or not we can develop a system where\r\n\r\nwe  have a common registry and accreditation, we have  to\r\n\r\nlook  into  the  building  blocks  first.   Do  we  have,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  a  comprehensive training  programme?   Are  we\r\n\r\nclear  about  what  are the core competencies  which  are\r\n\r\nneeded  in the various areas?  Ms Braema mentioned  about\r\n\r\naging.   That is a new phenomenon.  What exactly  is  the\r\n\r\ncompetency   that  we  need?   So,  in  areas   such   as\r\n\r\ngerontology  counselling that we are  now  looking  into,\r\n\r\nwhat are the sorts of skills that we need?  Some VWOs are\r\n\r\nin  discussion with some foreign experts.  I can be  very\r\n\r\ncandid.   They  have come to see me to  discuss  some  of\r\n\r\ntheir  suggestions.  These are areas which are  evolving,\r\n\r\nand  we will certainly want to understand how best we can\r\n\r\nfit  in  this particular expertise that is needed because\r\n\r\nthis is a phenomenon which will come in 2010 and beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we have to understand the core competencies\r\n\r\nwhich  are needed and then identify what are the training\r\n\r\nrequirements for them.  As Ms Braema rightly pointed out,\r\n\r\nwhen  they graduate from NUS - I am sure Prof. Ngiam will\r\n\r\nagree  with  me - they are more generalists  rather  than\r\n\r\nspecialists.  They will have to go through some  form  of\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema also mentioned about recognition - in this\r\n\r\ncase,  remuneration.  She is right that NCSS  has  looked\r\n\r\ninto  the salary scheme to follow very closely the salary\r\n\r\nscheme  of  the  civil service.  As to whether  they  can\r\n\r\nmatch the kinds of schemes that are in place for teachers\r\n\r\nand  nurses,  this is best left for NCSS to discuss  with\r\n\r\nthe  VWOs.  Having said that, I would like to assure  the\r\n\r\nhon. Member also that, to a large extent, it is up to the\r\n\r\nVWOs  to pay their social workers.  Some are able to  pay\r\n\r\nmore using their own funds.  The manpower cost is already\r\n\r\nincorporated in our funds to VWOs.  We will  continue  to\r\n\r\nadjust our funding to VWOs on a yearly basis to take into\r\n\r\naccount inflation, rising costs, etc.  We also take  into\r\n\r\naccount  the  need for wage increases.  But in  terms  of\r\n\r\nwhether  the  wage  structure is  consistent  with  other\r\n\r\nprofessionals  that  Ms  Braema has  mentioned  -  be  it\r\n\r\nteachers or nurses - this is best left for NCSS to study\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfurther,  because we have to evolve as we go along.   So,\r\n\r\nrather than looking at remuneration, I would prefer  that\r\n\r\nwe  look at the other parts of the building block  first,\r\n\r\nwhereby  we  have a system that they can  go  through  in\r\n\r\norder  to  receive the training in the core competencies.\r\n\r\nThereafter  we  can set out to determine the  appropriate\r\n\r\nsalary level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key issues concerning social workers such as\r\n\r\nattrition  and burn-out rate have to be addressed.   Like\r\n\r\nall    paid   personnel,   they   are   basically   still\r\n\r\nprofessionals who are working, who have a life  of  their\r\n\r\nown,  families  to look after during weekends,  etc.   So\r\n\r\nthis is something which we have to work with the VWOs  to\r\n\r\nlook  at  how they can plan the workload and use some  of\r\n\r\nthe  worklife initiatives that we have introduced to make\r\n\r\nsure  that the workload is more evenly spread.   I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  Ms  Braema  that we cannot predict  accurately  the\r\n\r\nworkload.   But, to a large extent, if there is  a  human\r\n\r\nresource  programme  in  place at  the  VWO,  that  would\r\n\r\nactually be very helpful, in terms of how they can adjust\r\n\r\nthe   workload.   These  are  the  things  that  we   are\r\n\r\ndiscussing with the VWOs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let us look at the overall system that we are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  put in place.  We  have increased funding  to\r\n\r\nVWOs.   We  have set up a VCF fund so that they  can  use\r\n\r\nthat  money for training, research and even scholarships.\r\n\r\nWe  are  now  looking into how we can identify  the  core\r\n\r\ncompetencies  needed  for various professionals.   Do  we\r\n\r\nneed  a  training institute to ensure that social workers\r\n\r\nundergo  some training while they are even  on  the  job?\r\n\r\nThat  is  being studied at this point in time.   Once  we\r\n\r\nhave  that, something comprehensive, then we have to look\r\n\r\nat what is the right and appropriate salary scale for the\r\n\r\nsocial worker professional, primarily because, as Members\r\n\r\nknow,  the area of social work is diverse - from FSCs  to\r\n\r\neldercare,  to counselling, violence, abuse, etc.   There\r\n\r\nis  a variety, in terms of the work that they do.  At the\r\n\r\nend of the day, it is about dealing with people.  But  we\r\n\r\nmust  also understand that running a student-care  outfit\r\n\r\nis slightly different from that of an FSC or dealing with\r\n\r\neldercare.  So we have to sort that out first.   This  is\r\n\r\nsomething that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  have to evolve.  As I said earlier, we are  looking\r\n\r\ninto  a master plan for social workers in terms of  their\r\n\r\ncareer  development, training needs, etc.  When  that  is\r\n\r\nout, I will be most happy to discuss this with Ms Braema,\r\n\r\nand  have  a  discussion on what are the things  that  we\r\n\r\nreally need to understand better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema suggested some changes to the funding and\r\n\r\nfelt  that the 50-50 ratio restricts the ability  of  the\r\n\r\nVWOs to pay the social workers.  I am not quite sure that\r\n\r\nI  agree  with her on that point.  For the 50-50  funding\r\n\r\nratio,  there is a certain philosophy of co-sharing  that\r\n\r\nwe want to encourage.  What we are trying to do now is to\r\n\r\nput  a  system  in place called the Programme  Evaluation\r\n\r\nSystem (PES).  This would allow VWOs to be more efficient\r\n\r\nand,  hopefully, with greater efficiency, they will  have\r\n\r\ngreater savings.  The 50% funding is basically decided on\r\n\r\nevery  year  based on how much they need.  If  they  work\r\n\r\nsmarter  or  more efficiently, there will be a  lot  more\r\n\r\nsavings,  and they can use that money to pay bonuses  and\r\n\r\nsalaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo  far,  what we have seen is that the 50-50  basis  has\r\n\r\nworked  quite well.  I am not prepared at this  point  in\r\n\r\ntime  to promise that we will change it.  Let us look  at\r\n\r\nother parts of the system where we can try and improve so\r\n\r\nthat  at the end of the day we can at least address  some\r\n\r\nof the problems that Ms Braema has mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I think I have addressed most of\r\n\r\nthe  concerns, and I would like to thank Ms Braema  again\r\n\r\nfor  raising some of those points.  As I said earlier,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  address  all the issues, but I promise  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember that we will certainly look into her suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

Lim:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Old Parliament House and its Annexe building\r\n\r\nwere  gazetted as national monuments in 1992.  It is  our\r\n\r\nintent  to  preserve as much as possible  their  physical\r\n\r\narchitecture and historical character. One key  objective\r\n\r\nis  to  preserve  our  constitutional  history  in  these\r\n\r\nsymbolic buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Arts Council (NAC) is spearheading this\r\n\r\nproject, jointly with the National Heritage Board  (NHB).\r\n\r\nThe  plan is to convert the Old Parliament House into  an\r\n\r\narts  and heritage centre.  There will be heritage  tours\r\n\r\nand  arts  education  programmes  for  students  and  the\r\n\r\ngeneral public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me highlight the main elements of the plan.\r\n\r\nFirst,  we  will use the walls within the Old  Parliament\r\n\r\nHouse  to  display both the history of the  building,  as\r\n\r\nwell as the constitutional history of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will mark several important rooms within\r\n\r\nthe  Old Parliament House with informational plaques,  to\r\n\r\ntell  visitors of significant events which took place  in\r\n\r\nthese  rooms.  For  example,  Members  may  remember  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  Room of the Legislative Assembly on  Level  2,\r\n\r\nnext  to  the Members' Room.  This was where SM  met  the\r\n\r\n\"Plen\"  in  1958.   We  will find  a  way  to  tell  this\r\n\r\nimportant story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we will preserve the Parliament Chamber even\r\n\r\nas  we  convert it into a 160-seat performance venue  for\r\n\r\nchamber   music,   choral   singing   and   small   drama\r\n\r\nproductions. There will be minimum changes.  For example,\r\n\r\nwe  will keep the seats in their original position.  They\r\n\r\nwill serve as audience seats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we will convert some of the functional rooms\r\n\r\ninto public spaces for the arts and heritage. The Library\r\n\r\nwill  be  turned into a 120-seat blackbox.  Part  of  the\r\n\r\nground  floor office space will be converted into  a  72-seat  film  theatrette.  We will turn the Committee  Room\r\n\r\ninto an art exhibition space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we will set aside some spaces for food and\r\n\r\nbeverage and shops.  The public entrance lobby and  porch\r\n\r\ncan  house  a  restaurant with  al  fresco  dining.   The\r\n\r\nprevious  computer and store spaces will make way  for  a\r\n\r\nbook-cum-souvenir shop. The ground floor  of  the  Annexe\r\n\r\nBuilding  will house another restaurant with a good  view\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore River. In total, not more than 20%  of\r\n\r\nthe  total  gross  floor  area is  set  aside  for  these\r\n\r\nancillary  services.  These are necessary  for  visitors'\r\n\r\ncomfort and convenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COMPULSORY LAND ACQUISITION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mdm Cynthia Phua</b> asked the Minister for Law (a)\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the  average timeframe for the  Singapore  Land\r\n\r\nAuthority  (SLA) to settle a compulsory land  acquisition\r\n\r\ncase;  (b)  in cases where an appeal is made against  the\r\n\r\ncompensation  awarded,  whether  SLA  makes  an   interim\r\n\r\npayment to the affected party; and (c) whether any  party\r\n\r\nhad been made bankrupt by a mortgagee bank due to the low\r\n\r\ncompensation amount awarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S.

If  he  does, the case is settled  quickly  and  he\r\n\r\nreceives the compensation monies early.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, about 94% of them were settled\r\n\r\nwithin  two  and a half years from the date of  gazetting\r\n\r\nthe acquisition.  These owners' cases were settled by SLA\r\n\r\nand were not heard by the Land Acquisition Appeals Board.\r\n\r\nThe  remaining  6%  which were heard by  the  Board  were\r\n\r\nmainly  settled  within  2-3  years  from  the  date   of\r\n\r\ngazetting the acquisition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 4 to 6 months of the gazetting of the\r\n\r\nacquisition,  the  property owner  receives  20%  of  the\r\n\r\ncompensation  offer  from  the Singapore  Land  Authority\r\n\r\n(SLA) when he surrenders his title deeds. This is to help\r\n\r\nhim relocate.  He receives this amount whether or not  he\r\n\r\nappeals  to the Land Acquisition Appeals Board.  Once  he\r\n\r\nvacates the premises, he receives the remaining 80%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no knowledge of any land owner who has been\r\n\r\nmade  a  bankrupt by the mortgagee bank  because  of  the\r\n\r\ncompensation  amount  awarded.  Indeed,  in  cases  where\r\n\r\nowners   face  hardship  arising  from  the  acquisition,\r\n\r\nGovernment extends ex-gratia payments to ameliorate their\r\n\r\nhardship. Over the years, Government has expanded the ex-gratia  scheme to allow more affected owners  to  qualify\r\n\r\nfor ex-gratia payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SPECIALIST CLINICS IN PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND POLYCLINICS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth  (a) what is the standard of service that patients\r\n\r\ncan  expect  from  specialist clinics  in  public  sector\r\n\r\nhospitals  and  polyclinics; and (b) whether  doctors  at\r\n\r\nthese clinics are overworked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polyclinics provide a comprehensive range of\r\n\r\npreventive and primary care services.  They are  able  to\r\n\r\nmanage  acute illnesses like the common cold as  well  as\r\n\r\nthe   more   chronic  problems  such  as   diabetes   and\r\n\r\nhypertension.  Other services include  health  education,\r\n\r\nfamily  planning, antenatal and postnatal care, childhood\r\n\r\nimmunisations and developmental assessment  of  children.\r\n\r\nWe  have about 200 doctors manning 17 polyclinics.  About\r\n\r\none-third  of  them  have postgraduate qualifications  in\r\n\r\nfamily medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For patients with more complicated medical problems,\r\n\r\na   full  range  of  specialist  outpatient  clinics  are\r\n\r\navailable  in  the  various  restructured  hospitals  and\r\n\r\nspecialty centres. We have about 640 specialists covering\r\n\r\nthe  29  specialties with outpatient clinics, ensuring  a\r\n\r\nhigh quality of clinical services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from professional standards, my Ministry also\r\n\r\nrecognises  the  importance of service  quality  such  as\r\n\r\nwaiting time and good communications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polyclinics are well-used by residents as fees are\r\n\r\naffordable.  The  majority of the  patients  are  walk-in\r\n\r\ncases  who  do not have prior appointments.  The  waiting\r\n\r\ntimes  can  therefore be longer because of  the  bunching\r\n\r\neffect.  During the morning peak hours between 8  and  11\r\n\r\nam,  patients may have to wait up to 90 minutes to see  a\r\n\r\ndoctor. Waiting times could be improved if patients  were\r\n\r\nto  visit  the  polyclinics  during  non-peak  hours.  My\r\n\r\nMinistry  is monitoring this situation closely,  and  the\r\n\r\npolyclinics  are  also  working  to  ensure  that   their\r\n\r\npatients do not have to wait unnecessarily long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the specialist outpatient clinics, our target is\r\n\r\nfor  at  least 50% of our patients to be seen  within  30\r\n\r\nminutes  of their appointment times, and for 95%  of  the\r\n\r\npatients   to  be  seen  within  75  minutes   of   their\r\n\r\nappointment   times.

My   Ministry\r\n\r\ncommissioned an Operations Research study in  April  2001\r\n\r\nto  look  into  the  causes of  this,  and  to  recommend\r\n\r\nmeasures needed for the clinics to achieve these targets.\r\n\r\nThe study is expected to be completed soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ensuring clinical and service quality standards,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  and  hospitals  monitor  and  ensure  that\r\n\r\ndoctors    are   not   unnecessarily   overworked.     At\r\n\r\npolyclinics,  doctors  work 45 hours  a  week,  excluding\r\n\r\nlunch  hours.   This  is comparable to  a  private-sector\r\n\r\nGeneral  Practitioner who works an average of 43 hours  a\r\n\r\nweek. Doctors in hospitals work an average of 60 hours  a\r\n\r\nweek.  The working hours are longer because most hospital\r\n\r\ndoctors,  as  part  of their work, perform  night  calls.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the working hours of our doctors are comparable\r\n\r\nto  those of doctors in other developed countries.  While\r\n\r\npublic-sector doctors generally see more patients than  a\r\n\r\nGeneral Practitioner every day, hospitals and polyclinics\r\n\r\nalso  ensure that their doctors have sufficient time with\r\n\r\npatients so that quality of care is not compromised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HOSPITAL WARDS AND BEDS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. <b>Mr Nithiah Nandan</b> asked the Minister for Health\r\n\r\n(a)  whether  there has been an increase  in  demand  for\r\n\r\nwards with higher subsidy and, if so, why and (b) what is\r\n\r\nthe  range  of  waiting time for Accident  and  Emergency\r\n\r\npatients before being assigned to a hospital bed and  the\r\n\r\nsteps taken to reduce the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demand for wards with higher subsidy has increased\r\n\r\nin  the  past two years.  In 2000, 70% of total inpatient\r\n\r\ndischarges  in  restructured  hospitals  were  from   the\r\n\r\nheavily  subsidised Class B2+, B2 and C.  This proportion\r\n\r\nincreased  to  74%  in first quarter  2002.  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncould have become more cost conscious as a result of  the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn  and our recent efforts  to  encourage\r\n\r\nthem to spend more prudently on healthcare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the higher demand for subsidised wards,\r\n\r\nrestructured  hospitals  are able  to  give  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ntimely access to subsidised healthcare services. Accident\r\n\r\nand  Emergency (A&E) patients are given prompt treatments\r\n\r\nat  the A&E Departments.  Moreover, more than 90% of  A&E\r\n\r\npatients  who require admissions are allocated a hospital\r\n\r\nbed within 1 hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the small minority who has to wait more than 1\r\n\r\nhour, our hospitals are looking into ways to speed up the\r\n\r\nallocation process.  For example, on days when demand for\r\n\r\nbeds  of  a particular ward class is exceptionally  high,\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals will allow patients to occupy a bed  in  a\r\n\r\nhigher ward class first, until a bed in the ward class of\r\n\r\ntheir  choice becomes available.

By this order, the court directs the  ex-husband's employer to deduct the maintenance amount  from\r\n\r\nhis salary and pay the money to the complainant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these orders, if the complainant is\r\n\r\nagreeable to giving time to the defaulting ex-husband  to\r\n\r\npay  the  maintenance arrears or the court  is  satisfied\r\n\r\nthat  more  time should be given to pay the arrears,  the\r\n\r\ncourt  may  direct the ex-husband to pay the  arrears  by\r\n\r\ninstalment payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>REPOSITORIES FOR ABANDONED BABIES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Acting Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development and Sports, in view of the  number\r\n\r\nof  reported  cases  of  new-born babies  being  left  in\r\n\r\nrubbish  dumps, whether he will consider (i) constructing\r\n\r\nrepositories at special designated places in Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  estates and at  strategic  convenient\r\n\r\nplaces where abandoned babies can be left safely and (ii)\r\n\r\nif necessary, making supporting statutory provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MP has asked if my Ministry will consider\r\n\r\nsetting   up  a  repository  for  abandoned   babies   in\r\n\r\nresidential  areas  or  designated  places.   While   the\r\n\r\nobjective is to protect the baby from danger as  well  as\r\n\r\nthe  anonymity of the parent who abandons the baby,  such\r\n\r\nrepositories  remain  controversial,  even  in  countries\r\n\r\nwhere they have been introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such repositories, also known as `Baby Drops', may\r\n\r\nsave a life, but they also make it easier for a parent to\r\n\r\nabandon   an  infant,  thus  indirectly  encouraging   or\r\n\r\nsanctioning child abandonment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Singapore law, it is illegal to abandon a\r\n\r\nbaby.     This    is   to   underline   the   inalienable\r\n\r\nresponsibility of parents for the safety and  welfare  of\r\n\r\ntheir children.  The `Baby Drop' scheme could unwittingly\r\n\r\ninstigate a parent to commit an offence.  Legalising such\r\n\r\na  scheme  will  not overcome the problem of  encouraging\r\n\r\nchild abandonment, which will, in the long term, put  far\r\n\r\nmore children at risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we recognise that mothers who cannot care for\r\n\r\ntheir  babies need help, there are avenues  for  them  to\r\n\r\nseek   help  for  themselves  and  their  babies  without\r\n\r\nresorting to abandonment.  My Ministry prefers to  engage\r\n\r\nthe  mother,  inform her of her options and  assist  her,\r\n\r\nthrough counselling with her partner and parents, to make\r\n\r\nan informed and socially responsible decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are several avenues where unwed\r\n\r\nmothers  or  those who feel they cannot  care  for  their\r\n\r\nbabies  can  turn to for help.  These avenues are  social\r\n\r\nservice  agencies, the hospitals and the Child Protection\r\n\r\nand  Welfare  Service  at  my Ministry.   These  services\r\n\r\ninclude  counselling on available options, the  provision\r\n\r\nof shelter pending delivery and assistance in placing the\r\n\r\nbaby for adoption.  If the unwed mother is a teenager, my\r\n\r\nMinistry or any social service agency will work with  the\r\n\r\ngirl,  and  if  possible  her  parents,  to  provide  the\r\n\r\nnecessary support and guidance needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelters for unwed mothers or mothers who wish to\r\n\r\ngive  up  their  child  are available  in  Singapore.   A\r\n\r\nwelfare  organisation,  Rose Villa,  provides  a  24-hour\r\n\r\nhotline  and  crisis shelter to handle  emergency  cases.\r\n\r\nUnwed  mothers  may also walk in to Rose  Villa  to  seek\r\n\r\nfurther  assistance  and  support  and  are  assured   of\r\n\r\nconfidentiality.   The  Pertapis  Centre  for  Women  and\r\n\r\nChildren   also   provides   a   safe   environment   for\r\n\r\ncounselling,  support and adoption  placement  for  unwed\r\n\r\nmothers.   My Ministry is currently working with  another\r\n\r\ntwo  Voluntary Welfare Organisations to provide  shelters\r\n\r\nfor  unwed  mothers so that there are ample  options  and\r\n\r\nservices  for  mothers  who find  themselves  in  such  a\r\n\r\npredicament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 3 years, the number of abandoned\r\n\r\nbabies  has dropped from 7 cases in 1999 to 4 cases  last\r\n\r\nyear.   This  is  largely  due to the  Ministry's  public\r\n\r\neducation  efforts  and the good work of  social  service\r\n\r\nagencies  to increase awareness about where to get  help.\r\n\r\nThis  arrangement of involving the people sector has been\r\n\r\nworking  well.  There is no need for additional statutory\r\n\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
