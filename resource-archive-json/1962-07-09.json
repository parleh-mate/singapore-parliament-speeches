Subsequently it came  to  my\r\n\r\nknowledge  that  the Member for  Anson  was  also  a\r\n\r\nsolicitor  for the said Sardara Singh,  and  I  drew\r\n\r\nyour  attention to the fact that (his could probably\r\n\r\nbe  committed  to  the Committee of  Privileges  for\r\n\r\ninvestigation.  The Committee has met  and  produced\r\n\r\nthis  Report. It has been agreed that if the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  had  raised the matter of  the  case  of\r\n\r\nSardara  Singh in the Assembly and in the manner  he\r\n\r\nproposed  he  could  have come within  the  mischief\r\n\r\nindicated in the preceding paragraphs and could have\r\n\r\nbeen  dealt with accordingly for abuse of  privilege\r\n\r\nor for dishonourable conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Committee investigated also the\r\n\r\ndesirability of framing a general\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresolution   to   cover  the  matters   raised   but\r\n\r\nconsidered that in the light of the above it was not\r\n\r\nnecessary to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when a person has acquired three \"P.s\" to his name - meaning, privilege, profit and power - he\r\n\r\nis virtually in an unassailable position. During the\r\n\r\ndebate  on  the  amendments  to  the  Advocates  and\r\n\r\nSolicitors Ordinance, the Member for Anson  admitted\r\n\r\nthat  an  advocate and solicitor was  in  a  special\r\n\r\nposition  of  privilege and also in  a  position  of\r\n\r\nprofit.  Here  I  would like to  add  that  when  an\r\n\r\nadvocate  and solicitor also becomes an Assemblyman,\r\n\r\nparticularly if he is on the Opposition Bench  where\r\n\r\nhe  does not have to bear responsibilities, he  also\r\n\r\nacquires  his  third  P. - meaning  that  he  acquires\r\n\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, normally a member of the Bar would be\r\n\r\nresponsible   to   the  body   that   controls   his\r\n\r\nprofession,  which  is the Bar  Committee.  The  Bar\r\n\r\nCommittee can haul a fellow member over the coals if\r\n\r\nthere  has  been a breach of etiquette.  But  if  an\r\n\r\nadvocate  and  solicitor is also  a  Member  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly, and he is given liberty to speak  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  on matters which probably touch  upon  his\r\n\r\nprofessional  work, he would be in  a  position  not\r\n\r\nonly to enlarge his profit from the advertisement he\r\n\r\ngains  in this Assembly but also he would  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition of power. However, such a person could  not\r\n\r\nbe  disciplined  by  the Bar  Committee.  Under  the\r\n\r\nPowers and Immunities Ordinance of Assemblymen, such\r\n\r\nan  advocate and solicitor cannot be hauled over the\r\n\r\ncoals by his professional body. However, it does not\r\n\r\nmean  that we should allow a person to exercise  his\r\n\r\npower  and his privilege in an unrestrained  manner.\r\n\r\nIf  a  professional body is powerless to  discipline\r\n\r\nits  member by virtue of the fact that he is also  a\r\n\r\nMember of the Assembly, then it is up to this  House\r\n\r\nitself to discipline its own Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliamentary democracy can only succeed, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, if Assemblymen exercise restraint and self-discipline. If there is absolute licence  of  speech\r\n\r\nand  if  there is any attempt to get away  with  the\r\n\r\npenalties for which he would nominally be guilty  of\r\n\r\nif he were outside the Assembly, it would mean, Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker, that the reputation of this Assembly  would\r\n\r\nbe brought down to a very low level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Umm ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I hear a grunt from the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson.  But  I am quite sure  that  he  in  his\r\n\r\nuprighteousness  does  want to uphold  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  I  know he tries very hard  to  restrain\r\n\r\nhimself  at  times, but, as they say,  the  body  is\r\n\r\nweaker than the spirit. However, the lesson which we\r\n\r\nwish  to draw from this Report is this, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nand  that is that Assemblymen, especially those  who\r\n\r\nare  professional men, in particular  advocates  and\r\n\r\nsolicitors,  must  remember  that  they  are  in   a\r\n\r\nposition   of  privilege,  profit  and  power,   and\r\n\r\ncommensurate with these special qualities that  they\r\n\r\nhave   acquired  they  should  also  exercise  equal\r\n\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, there is an air of\r\n\r\nunreality in discussing privilege and the dignity of\r\n\r\nthe  House  in  the  context of the  throes  of  the\r\n\r\nstruggle  for  the  survival  of  democracy   itself\r\n\r\nthrough  which we are going today. I  shall  not  be\r\n\r\nlong,  Sir, nor shall I seek to contest this  ruling\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  the light of the fact  that  every\r\n\r\nminute  we  are discussing this we are  taking  away\r\n\r\nthat  much  time  from a much more crucial  question\r\n\r\nwhich is subject to a guillotine provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw attention to one or two\r\n\r\npoints,  Sir, just for the record. It is  inaccurate\r\n\r\nto suggest that there was anything but a willingness\r\n\r\nand  desire  on my part that this matter  should  be\r\n\r\nclarified. Having come across some vital information\r\n\r\nwhich  I  considered would affect the view  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  in respect of certain matters concerning  the\r\n\r\nadministrative  conduct of statutory  provisions,  I\r\n\r\nhad  wished that this House should know of it, after\r\n\r\nmy client had ceased to be my client and he had left\r\n\r\nthis  country and the result of whatever took  place\r\n\r\nhere  could have no effect on him. When I gave  that\r\n\r\nindication, I learned that the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the  Leader  of  the House was  unhappy  as  he\r\n\r\nthought   that  I  might  contravene  the  privilege\r\n\r\nprovisions.  If  you  will  remember,  Sir,  I   had\r\n\r\nindicated that in those circumstances I would  wish,\r\n\r\nrather than speak on it and possibly contravene  any\r\n\r\nprivilege  provisions, that  the  matter  should  be\r\n\r\nconsidered by the Committee of Privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am delighted that you saw fit to consult the\r\n\r\nFourth  Clerk at the Table in the House  of  Commons\r\n\r\nand  I  find myself in complete agreement  with  his\r\n\r\nstand as indicated in paragraph 10:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I think that it might be accepted as a broad\r\n\r\ngeneral principle that a Member would be in contempt\r\n\r\n(of  the House) if his advocacy in Parliament  of  a\r\n\r\nmatter  in which he had been professionally  engaged\r\n\r\nwas  in any way proved to be due to a desire to show\r\n\r\nthat  he  was continuing to give value for  the  fee\r\n\r\nmarked  on his brief. If, however, his parliamentary\r\n\r\nactivities   were   completely   divorced   from   a\r\n\r\nfurtherance  of his lay client's interests  at  law,\r\n\r\nthere would seem to be no objection.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And in point of fact, Sir, that was my stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I can understand the unhappy position in\r\n\r\nwhich  the Committee found itself where it  received\r\n\r\nthe  memoranda  and  representations  from  the  Bar\r\n\r\nCommittee.  I  refer  to the  Chairman  of  the  Bar\r\n\r\nCommittee who was asked what if a Member of the  Bar\r\n\r\nin  the course of his professional duties learned of\r\n\r\nmatters of national importance and thereafter ceased\r\n\r\nto  act and had his client's permission. And he said\r\n\r\nthat  it would be objectionable still. One can  only\r\n\r\nbelieve that that was his view because he is  not  a\r\n\r\nnational of this State and it had no reality in  the\r\n\r\ncontext  of  his  representations. But  he  says  in\r\n\r\nparagraph 16 that the Bar Committee would still take\r\n\r\nobjection:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I would still take objection because it seems it\r\n\r\ncould  be  deemed  that the lawyer  mentioning  this\r\n\r\nmatter   would  be  seeking  to  attract  trade   by\r\n\r\nadvertisement.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  my view is very simply this.

This Bill seeks to regulate the manner in\r\n\r\nwhich a Tariff Advisory Commission is to conduct its\r\n\r\ninvestigations on any proposals to impose tariffs in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  As  such, therefore, the Bill  seeks  to\r\n\r\nchange  from  time to time the free port  status  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  There  was an expectation  then  that  a\r\n\r\ncontroversy  might rage between the upholders  of  a\r\n\r\n100  per cent free port status of Singapore  on  the\r\n\r\none  hand, and the manufacturers who want to see new\r\n\r\nindustries as fast as possible on the other hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Bill was sent to Select Committee, the\r\n\r\nusual   processes   were  set  on  foot,   including\r\n\r\nadvertisements  in the papers asking  for  views  of\r\n\r\ninterested  parties. A strange thing then  happened.\r\n\r\nThere   was   absolutely  no   response   to   these\r\n\r\nadvertisements and the closing date for reception of\r\n\r\nmemoranda  had to be extended. Finally, two  parties\r\n\r\nmade  their submissions, namely, the Joint  Chambers\r\n\r\nof  Commerce, who were somewhat apprehensive of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions   of   this  Bill,  and   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nManufacturers' Association, who welcomed the general\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a fairly cordial and friendly discussion\r\n\r\nwith the interested parties in Select Committee,  as\r\n\r\na result of which two amendments were introduced and\r\n\r\napproved  by  Select  Committee.  May  I  draw   the\r\n\r\nattention of the House to these two amendments? They\r\n\r\nare  in  clause 6. There is an addition to clause  6\r\n\r\nand  the  additional sentence reads  as  follows  - I\r\n\r\nshould  mention that clause 6 allows the  Commission\r\n\r\nto  co-opt, on an ad hoc basis, two or more  persons\r\n\r\nwith  special  knowledge  of  the  subject  at   the\r\n\r\ninquiry.  An  amendment was made to this  clause  to\r\n\r\nallow  and, in fact, to make it compulsory that  one\r\n\r\nof   these   persons   shall  represent   industrial\r\n\r\ninterests  and  the  other shall  represent  trading\r\n\r\ninterests. This amendment was made after the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  heard  the views of the representors  and\r\n\r\nagreed  that  they had a strong case.  So  clause  6\r\n\r\ncontains this additional sentence which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`At least one of such persons shall be a person\r\n\r\nrepresenting industrial interests and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  other  shall  be a person representing  trading\r\n\r\ninterests.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendment occurs in clause 9 (2) (a) (ii)\r\n\r\nin  page  A3,  line 27 of the Report of  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  the Bill.

And  this,\r\n\r\nI  think,  Members  of the House  will  agree  is  a\r\n\r\ncompletely unexceptional request and accordingly the\r\n\r\nGovernment   agrees   to  the  inclusion   of   this\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clauses do not call for any comment from\r\n\r\nme  at  this  stage  as they have  been  dealt  with\r\n\r\nadequately, I think, on the Second Reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CUSTOMS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.54 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nI  beg  to move, \"That the Bill be now read a  Third\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is for the most part consequential on the\r\n\r\npassage of the Tariff Advisory Commission Bill.

Therein we pointed out the peculiar position\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  of  two  parallel administrations - the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government  and the  City  Council - existing\r\n\r\nside  by side and duplicating each other's functions\r\n\r\nand  activities. We were against such a wasteful and\r\n\r\nexpensive  system  of government for  such  a  small\r\n\r\nisland    and    proposed   to    rationalise    the\r\n\r\nadministrative structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the implementation of this policy of\r\n\r\nintegration was phased in three stages:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The administrative integration of the City\r\n\r\nCouncil Departments into relevant Ministries of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The financial integration which was completed\r\n\r\nwith  the  coming  into  operation  on  the  1st  of\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1961, of the Property Tax Ordinance and the\r\n\r\nLocal  Government  Financial Integration  Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThese  two Bills, the Public Utilities Bill and  the\r\n\r\nLocal  Government Integration Bill,  will  mark  the\r\n\r\nfruition of our policy of unified administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this Bill comes into force and the Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board is established, integration will  be\r\n\r\nlegally completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, incorporated in this Bill are those sections\r\n\r\nof  the Local Government Ordinance, 1957, which  are\r\n\r\napplicable  to  the  three  trading  departments  of\r\n\r\nelectricity, water, gas and their duties, powers and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities. Regard is also being paid  to  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  legislation, including the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya Electricity Ordinance, 1949, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Ordinance, 1959,  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Telephone Board Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement adequately indicates the\r\n\r\nintention  and purpose of the Bill.  As  it  is  the\r\n\r\nintention  to  refer this Bill together  with  other\r\n\r\nrelated   Bills   involved  in  this   exercise   of\r\n\r\nintegration  to  a  Select Committee  to  allow  for\r\n\r\ncareful study before enactment, I do not propose  to\r\n\r\nelaborate on the detailed provisions of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of sending it to Select Committee\r\n\r\nis  in order to allow all interested parties to make\r\n\r\ntheir  representations. It may well be, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  these  representations  will  entail   a\r\n\r\nredrafting of the Bill when it is submitted  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse  again  later  in the new  Session  after  the\r\n\r\nAssembly has been adjourned sine die and prorogued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> There is just one\r\n\r\nprovision in the Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, on which  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  touch, which seems to  involve  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  principle, and the  principle  is  one\r\n\r\nwhich  affects  the authority of the  Assembly.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the power to borrow money as  set  out\r\n\r\nin  the various clauses here seems, in some way,  to\r\n\r\ninfringe upon the rights of the Assembly in  so  far\r\n\r\nas  the  monies  of  the State are  concerned.  Take\r\n\r\nclause  23  onwards, Mr Speaker, Sir. There  is  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that the Board must be given ample powers  to\r\n\r\nborrow  money and, as such, it must be able  to  fix\r\n\r\nits  rate  of interest and the terms and  conditions\r\n\r\nupon  which  repayment  will be  effected.  I  fully\r\n\r\nappreciate  all  that. I also  appreciate  that  the\r\n\r\nBoard will be in a very different position from what\r\n\r\nthe  City Council was, because the City Council  was\r\n\r\nan  institution which had been in existence for some\r\n\r\nconsiderable time. It had property of  its  own  and\r\n\r\nall  the loans which were raised by the City Council\r\n\r\nfor  its  public utility undertakings were a  charge\r\n\r\nupon  all the assets of the City Council. That being\r\n\r\nso, it was possible to induce the investing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic  to  take up those loans. But the Board  will\r\n\r\nnaturally be in a different position. All its assets\r\n\r\nwill be assets which are not marketable assets,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  the borrowing powers to that extent  will\r\n\r\nbe  largely hampered from a security point of  view.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it is necessary that these loans  should\r\n\r\nbe   underwritten   by  the  Government.   I   fully\r\n\r\nappreciate  that.  But there is a provision  in  the\r\n\r\nBill  which says that if the revenues of  the  Board\r\n\r\nare  insufficient to meet payments from  these  loan\r\n\r\nliabilities either incurred in the past  or  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture,  then they shall be a charge on  the  public\r\n\r\ndebt of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as you know, under the\r\n\r\nConstitution, any charge on the public debt  is  not\r\n\r\nan  item arguable in this Assembly. It is an item of\r\n\r\nstatutory    expenditure   which   the    Government\r\n\r\nautomatically gets. This is a question of  principle\r\n\r\nwhich,  I  think, the Assembly is rightly interested\r\n\r\nin, although I do appreciate the difficulties of the\r\n\r\nsituation.  The position could arise,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, that a great deal of money could be borrowed by\r\n\r\nthe   Board,  naturally  with  the  consent  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  and  yet the Assembly would  find  itself\r\n\r\nunable   to   do  anything  about  it  because   any\r\n\r\nexpenditure in the way of repayment will be a public\r\n\r\ndebt. The Assembly will be powerless. I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhat  the  solution is; perhaps the  Minister  might\r\n\r\nthink  of  one,  but I raise it as  a  matter  which\r\n\r\nconcerns the rights of the Legislative Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  with  regard  to clause 19, I  would  like  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, or the Select Committee when it sits, to\r\n\r\npay attention to it. It may sound to be a matter  of\r\n\r\ndetail, Mr Speaker, Sir, but it is a detail that is\r\n\r\ncausing  hardship  to a very large  number  of  poor\r\n\r\npeople in Singapore. So perhaps the Select Committee\r\n\r\nwill pay attention to this detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 provides that the Board may cut off\r\n\r\nsupply  in default of payment. I do know of  people,\r\n\r\nespecially  those occupying S.I.T. flats,  who  are\r\n\r\nasked to pay a deposit of $40/- or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthereabouts.

And to get their supplies  resumed,\r\n\r\nthey  will have to pay not only what they are  asked\r\n\r\nat  that time but also the expenses incurred by  the\r\n\r\nBoard  in  so cutting off the supplies and  resuming\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

We  hope  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  will  consider  in  greater  detail   the\r\n\r\nopinions  of  the  people concerned  and  also  will\r\n\r\narrive at conclusions more beneficial to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the point made by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park was one which was considered\r\n\r\nby  a Committee which went through the Bill together\r\n\r\nwith  the  World  Bank. A large sum  of  money  will\r\n\r\nprobably have to be borrowed from the World Bank for\r\n\r\nextensive expansion of both our power supply and our\r\n\r\nwaterworks. Therefore, the views of the  World  Bank\r\n\r\nas  to the proper safeguards and provisos that there\r\n\r\nshould be in the statutory provisions regulating the\r\n\r\nconduct of the Board are of some importance to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to go into details regarding\r\n\r\nthis.  Needless  to say, the World Bank,  before  it\r\n\r\nadvances  large sums of money which may well  amount\r\n\r\nto  over $100 million altogether, would want  to  be\r\n\r\nassured  that  there  are sufficient  guarantees  on\r\n\r\nrepayment  and  certain  guarantees  on  the  proper\r\n\r\nconduct of the business of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the points made by the Member for Choa Chu\r\n\r\nKang, I think they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  not worth any specific replies.

I  beg  to\r\n\r\nmove, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recall, Sir, at the Budget session last\r\n\r\nyear  I  mentioned that the integration of the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  into  the Central Government  was  a  major\r\n\r\nadministrative  reform undertaken  by  the  People's\r\n\r\nAction Party Government. I touched at some length on\r\n\r\nthe  make-up of the City Council and the  manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich  it  was  proposed to integrate  it  into  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government. Since 1st  January,  1961,  the\r\n\r\nphysical integration of the City Council other  than\r\n\r\nthe  three trading departments has been in progress,\r\n\r\nand  administratively  and operationally  they  have\r\n\r\nbeen absorbed by various Government Ministries. This\r\n\r\nmajor  administrative reform is in  accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe  pledge  of the Party to bring about a  smoother\r\n\r\nand  more  efficient  public service  to  serve  the\r\n\r\npeople of the State. In the process, duplication  of\r\n\r\nfunctions that had previously\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexisted has been removed, and it is expected that in\r\n\r\nthe   long  run  economies  will  be  effected   and\r\n\r\nefficiency raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before the House is complementary to\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Utilities Bill which was earlier  moved\r\n\r\nfor  a Second Reading by the Prime Minister, and  it\r\n\r\nprovides  for  the transfer to the  Government  with\r\n\r\nretrospective effect from the 1st January, 1961,  of\r\n\r\nall  assets as well as liabilities and employees  of\r\n\r\nthe  City Council and of the Rural Board other  than\r\n\r\nthose transferred to the Public Utilities Board  for\r\n\r\nthe   running   of   water,  gas,  and   electricity\r\n\r\nundertakings. These are contained in Part I  of  the\r\n\r\nBill. It also enacts in Parts II to VI and VIII  all\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Local Government Ordinance,  1957,\r\n\r\nrelating  to  streets, sewage,  public  health,  etc\r\n\r\n. - matters  which  hitherto  have  been  within   the\r\n\r\njurisdiction  of  the  City Council  and  the  Rural\r\n\r\nBoard - and  vests the necessary statutory  powers  in\r\n\r\nGovernment officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only new legislation is in Part VII which\r\n\r\nestablishes  District  Offices  and  gives   certain\r\n\r\npowers to District Officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enactment of this Bill will formally complete\r\n\r\nthe   Government's   policy  of  integrating   local\r\n\r\nauthorities  into the central administration.  Since\r\n\r\nit is proposed to refer the Bill to Select Committee\r\n\r\nfor  closer  examination and since  the  Explanatory\r\n\r\nStatement gives the objects and reasons of the Bill,\r\n\r\nI  shall confine my remarks to two important aspects\r\n\r\nof  the Bill: namely those concerning personnel  and\r\n\r\nfinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that all employees of the City\r\n\r\nCouncil  who  are  not  transferred  to  the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board shall be transferred to the  service\r\n\r\nof the Government at the same rate of pay or as near\r\n\r\nas may be the same conditions of service as those on\r\n\r\nwhich  they were employed by the City Council.  Upon\r\n\r\nthe  coming into operation of this Ordinance,  these\r\n\r\nemployees will become Government servants  and  will\r\n\r\nlegally be governed by Government regulations and by\r\n\r\nthe Constitution. But it is our intention, in so far\r\n\r\nas   salaries   are  concerned,  that  all   serving\r\n\r\nemployees on the permanent establishment of the City\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncil  shall  be  allowed to retain,  if  they  so\r\n\r\ndesire, their existing salaries and salary scales on\r\n\r\ntheir transfer to the Government service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to other terms and conditions of\r\n\r\nservice, it is hoped, in consultation with the Staff\r\n\r\nUnions concerned, to bring about a set of conditions\r\n\r\nof  service that would be acceptable and which would\r\n\r\nbe   patterned  on  the  terms  and  conditions  now\r\n\r\napplicable  to Government servants. It is  envisaged\r\n\r\nthat  in  the process certain minor adjustments  and\r\n\r\nchanges may be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that persons transferred\r\n\r\nfrom the City Council who are already members of the\r\n\r\nMunicipal Provident Fund will continue in membership\r\n\r\nof  that  Fund.  In addition, such persons  who  are\r\n\r\neligible for membership of the Fund at the  time  of\r\n\r\ntransfer to the Government service will retain  that\r\n\r\neligibility.  Officers of the City Council  who  are\r\n\r\nnot  members of the Municipal Provident Fund nor are\r\n\r\neligible for membership thereof will be governed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Pensions and Central Provident Fund  Ordinances\r\n\r\nin   every   respect  as  they  are  applicable   to\r\n\r\nGovernment  servants. Persons  appointed  after  the\r\n\r\ncoming  into force of this Bill will, of course,  be\r\n\r\ngoverned  by the Pensions Ordinance and the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund  Ordinance. The  management  of  the\r\n\r\nMunicipal Provident Fund will be transferred to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   together  with  all  its   assets   and\r\n\r\nliabilities, and the accounts thereof will  be  kept\r\n\r\nby    the   Accountant-General.   The   assets   and\r\n\r\nliabilities connected with the public loans  of  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council, including the sinking fund for  those\r\n\r\nloans, are to be transferred to the Public Utilities\r\n\r\nBoard  under  the  Public Utilities  Bill,  but  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will contribute to the Board in  respect\r\n\r\nof  those portions of outstanding public loans which\r\n\r\nwere  used  to buy assets to be transferred  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment under this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, the only new provision in this\r\n\r\nBill  is the establishment of District Offices.  The\r\n\r\nprincipal function of District Officers is to ensure\r\n\r\nthe  adequacy  of various services provided  in  the\r\n\r\ndistricts, to receive representations, and generally\r\n\r\nto act as liaison\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nofficers  in the districts with respect  to  matters\r\n\r\ncoming within their jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is envisaged that certain functions and powers\r\n\r\nof  the  Government  Ministries, in  particular  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health and the Public Works  Department\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministry of National Development,  will  be\r\n\r\ndelegated  to the District Officers so that  a  more\r\n\r\nefficient and quicker service can be provided to the\r\n\r\npeople in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will involve the Government in extra\r\n\r\nfinancial expenditure in the payment of salaries and\r\n\r\noperational    expenses   of   various    Government\r\n\r\ndepartments integrated with those of the Government.\r\n\r\nThese  expenses  were  formerly  chargeable  to  the\r\n\r\nMunicipal  Provident  Fund. The  amounts  cannot  at\r\n\r\npresent  be fully ascertained but will be  dependent\r\n\r\non the services to be provided and improvement works\r\n\r\nto  be  carried  out  by  the Government  under  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance. However, this extra financial expenditure\r\n\r\nis  in  reality  not so for these  services  had  in\r\n\r\nprevious  years been borne by the City  Council  and\r\n\r\nthe Rural Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's hope that when the\r\n\r\nadministrative  machinery of  integration  is  fully\r\n\r\nimplemented there should, over a period, be  overall\r\n\r\nsavings  to the Government in that additional  costs\r\n\r\nfrom duplication of functions and services will have\r\n\r\nbeen reduced, if not totally removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> This Bill is namely a re-enacting Bill\r\n\r\nwhich is, at the same time, seeking to integrate the\r\n\r\nservices now carried on statutorily under the  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment Ordinance into the Government. As such, I\r\n\r\nhave nothing much to say. But there are two or three\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  this  Bill  which  seem  to  involve\r\n\r\nquestions  of principle which I think I might  raise\r\n\r\nstraightaway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under clause 2, the repeal of any\r\n\r\nBill  leaves  any regulations under the Repeal  Bill\r\n\r\neffective as law,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there is a proviso which goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.... that the Minister may by order vary, amend,\r\n\r\nextend  or  revoke  such subsidiary  legislation  so\r\n\r\nremaining in force or any part thereof as he  thinks\r\n\r\nfit.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>You   will  notice,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that   the\r\n\r\noperative words there are \"may by order\". There is a\r\n\r\nprovision  to  clause  182  for  regulations.  Under\r\n\r\nclause  182 -  \"The Minister may make  Regulations...\".\r\n\r\nAnd  under  sub-clause (7) of that clause - \"All  such\r\n\r\nregulations shall be published [and laid before  the\r\n\r\nAssembly and the Assembly can take a certain line of\r\n\r\naction if it so desires].\" The question I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask the Minister is this, whether an order under\r\n\r\nclause  2  will  be deemed to be a regulation  under\r\n\r\nclause 182. If it is not, then it gives the Minister\r\n\r\na whole host of powers to alter the law as he wishes\r\n\r\nwithout  consulting the Assembly,  or  the  Assembly\r\n\r\nbeing  in any position to revoke that order made  by\r\n\r\nthe Minister. That is the first point. That seems to\r\n\r\nbe  a  clause  in derogation of the  rights  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the terms of clause 9 are not understood.\r\n\r\nNormally when one service is being transferred to an\r\n\r\nexisting   service   or  two  services   are   being\r\n\r\nintegrated, the posts are held in the same way  that\r\n\r\nthey   were  before  integration,  and  the  persons\r\n\r\nholding the posts would hold those posts. But I seem\r\n\r\nto get the impression from this proviso that in some\r\n\r\ncases even the holders of the posts cannot hold  the\r\n\r\nnew  \"integrated\"  posts - if  I  may  call  it  that\r\n\r\nwithout   the   approval  of  the   Public   Service\r\n\r\nCommission,   unless   I  have   misunderstood   the\r\n\r\nprovision.  But  it  looks  to  me,  on  the   first\r\n\r\nreading - or  even  the second and  third  readings - of\r\n\r\nthis clause, that there may be posts coming into the\r\n\r\nGovernment in respect of which the approval  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Service Commission would be necessary before\r\n\r\nthey can be confirmed insofar as the present holders\r\n\r\nare  concerned. If my interpretation is  correct  it\r\n\r\nseems to be an unusual provision which has not  been\r\n\r\navailed of before in respect of other services which\r\n\r\nhave already been integrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provision which I am not clear about is\r\n\r\nthe  transfer  to the Government of the  assets  and\r\n\r\nliabilities of the City Council and the Rural Board.\r\n\r\nApparently,  the assets which are to be  transferred\r\n\r\nare  at the end of the year 1960. I ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhy  at the end of the year 1960, and why not up  to\r\n\r\nthe  time when integration takes place, because  the\r\n\r\nCity Council as such does, in fact, now exist and it\r\n\r\nmust be holding assets now? So why the provision  in\r\n\r\nclause  5  to  the  effect that it shall  only  take\r\n\r\neffect  insofar as the assets of the Council  as  at\r\n\r\n1960 are concerned?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, in reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, as regards clause 2 and\r\n\r\nclause  182,  the position as I see it is  this.  In\r\n\r\nclause  2  (2) , the Minister is empowered  to  vary,\r\n\r\namend,   extend   or   revoke  existing   subsidiary\r\n\r\nlegislation.  I  think the Member  for  Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nagrees  that this is a reasonable provision because,\r\n\r\nwhere  by-laws  and regulations have already  passed\r\n\r\nand    are   now   found   to   be   working   quite\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily, there is no reason why  they  should\r\n\r\nbe revoked and not allowed to continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the point he has made in respect of clause 182\r\n\r\nis  that  he  thinks in some way or  the  other  the\r\n\r\njurisdiction of the Assembly would be restricted  in\r\n\r\nrespect of --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> On a point of explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I am not saying that the Minister\r\n\r\nshould  not have that power.

The employees\r\n\r\nof  the  Trust who were transferred to the  Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment were members of the staff engaged in  the\r\n\r\nplanning  functions of the Trust.  Their  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions     of    service,    including     their\r\n\r\nsuperannuation, were governed by the same  rules  as\r\n\r\napplied to the employees of the City Council. It has\r\n\r\nbeen  the  intention  that the staff  of  the  Trust\r\n\r\ntransferred  to  the  Planning  Department  and  the\r\n\r\nemployees   of  the  City  Council   who   will   be\r\n\r\ntransferred  to  the Government as a consequence  of\r\n\r\nthe  integration  should enjoy the  same  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions of transfer and superannuation. In  order\r\n\r\nto  ensure that these former employees of the  Trust\r\n\r\nwould enjoy similar superannuation benefits as those\r\n\r\napplicable to employees of the City Council who  are\r\n\r\nto  be transferred to the Government as a result  of\r\n\r\nthe  integration, it is necessary  to  commence  the\r\n\r\nPlanning   Ordinance   to  provide   for   identical\r\n\r\nprovisions   as  those  contained   in   the   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment Integration Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extension of the benefits of the Government's\r\n\r\npension  scheme  to former Trust  employees  in  the\r\n\r\nPlanning  Department will involve the Government  in\r\n\r\nsome  small  expenditure.  In  a  few  cases,  these\r\n\r\npersons  will  find the benefits of the Government's\r\n\r\npension scheme greater than those to which they were\r\n\r\nentitled  in  their  previous  employment  with  the\r\n\r\nTrust.  It is most probable that in these few  cases\r\n\r\nthey  would  choose the benefits of the Government's\r\n\r\npension   scheme.   The  exact   costs   cannot   be\r\n\r\nascertained until their final retirement. But in all\r\n\r\nprobability there will only be a few cases and it is\r\n\r\nunlikely  that  the additional cost  would  be  very\r\n\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to the Select Committee to which the\r\n\r\nPublic  Utilities  Bill has been  committed  by  the\r\n\r\nAssembly. -[Dr Goh Keng Swee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PENSIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nI  beg  to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Pensions Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1956.  It  provides for pension and other retirement\r\n\r\nbenefits  of persons transferred to the  service  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government from the City Council, the Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust and the Tan Tock  Seng  Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe  superannuation schemes to which  they  belonged\r\n\r\nprior  to  the  transfer generally allowed  them  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  membership  in their  respective  schemes.\r\n\r\nThey  could also count their service before transfer\r\n\r\nas  service reckonable for pension on their eventual\r\n\r\nretirement. As matters stand, such a person would be\r\n\r\neligible  on his retirement for benefits  under  his\r\n\r\nown  superannuation  scheme as  well  as  retirement\r\n\r\nbenefits  under the Government pension scheme.  This\r\n\r\nis    clearly   contrary   to   the   principle   of\r\n\r\nsuperannuation.  It  is,  therefore,  necessary  for\r\n\r\nprovision to be made to enable employees transferred\r\n\r\nfrom  the  City Council, the Trust and the Tan  Tock\r\n\r\nSeng  Hospital to choose to receive benefits  either\r\n\r\nfrom  their own superannuation scheme or those under\r\n\r\nthe Government pension scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the aspect of death benefits. The\r\n\r\nGovernment's pension scheme, as it stands,  requires\r\n\r\nthe  payment  of at least one year's salary  in  the\r\n\r\nform  of  a  death gratuity to the dependants  of  a\r\n\r\ndeceased  officer.  As  on  their  transfer  to  the\r\n\r\nservice  of  the Government, employees of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  the  Trust and the Tan Tock Seng  Hospital\r\n\r\nbecome  Government officers, their dependants  would\r\n\r\nbe entitled to a death gratuity or one year's salary\r\n\r\nshould  they die in harness. The existing provisions\r\n\r\nfor the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npayment  of  a  death  gratuity  do  not  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration death benefits to which a  transferred\r\n\r\nperson  may be eligible under his own superannuation\r\n\r\nscheme.  If  this situation is allowed to  continue,\r\n\r\nthen  transferred persons would be better  off  than\r\n\r\nGovernment servants who have only the pension scheme\r\n\r\nto  rely on for benefits. For this reason, provision\r\n\r\nhas  been made in the Bill for the quantum of  death\r\n\r\ngratuity  payable  under  the  Government's  pension\r\n\r\nscheme  to be reduced to the extent of contributions\r\n\r\npaid  to  the  superannuation  scheme  to  which   a\r\n\r\ntransferred person belonged by his previous employer\r\n\r\nand Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to the Select Committee to which the\r\n\r\nPublic  Utilities  Bill has been  committed  by  the\r\n\r\nAssembly. -[Dr Goh Keng Swee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill  be  now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Ordinance, 1959, so as to  bring  about\r\n\r\nuniformity  of provisions relating to superannuation\r\n\r\nof  the  staff between that Ordinance and the Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Bill.

Of  the  other\r\n\r\nMembers,  13 in the Barisan Sosialis, through  their\r\n\r\nParty  Chairman, in September last  year  asked  for\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger like Penang and Malacca;  three  in\r\n\r\nthe  United People's Party, through their Secretary-General,  the Member for Hong Lim, in a radio  forum\r\n\r\non  the  14th of June this year, the proceedings  of\r\n\r\nwhich  are  recorded on the tape, asked for  merger\r\n\r\nterms - and  I quote - \"parallel to Johore\";  and  one\r\n\r\nMember,  the Workers' Party, through their Chairman,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson, in this Assembly on the  23rd\r\n\r\nof  November  asked  for - and I quote - \"complete  and\r\n\r\nunconditional merger\" - and again I quote - \"on an equal\r\n\r\nbasis  with the other States\". Sir, only one  Member\r\n\r\nin  this  House, the Member for Joo Chiat,  has  not\r\n\r\nexpressed his views on the type of merger we  should\r\n\r\nhave. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true that subsequently\r\n\r\nat  a radio forum which was broadcast on the 14th of\r\n\r\nJune this year, the Member for Hong Lim said the Bansan  Sosialis - and I quote his words again - \"have once\r\n\r\nmade  a  mistake and that since their mistake,  they\r\n\r\nhave  asked  for automatic conversion of  Singa-pore\r\n\r\ncitizens into Federation citizens.\" It is also  true\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member for Anson, in the  same  forum  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the Barisan Sosialis --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> --- the proceedings of which are\r\n\r\non the tape, I do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow whether he had the authority to speak on behalf\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan  Sosialis, but he spoke  with  such\r\n\r\nvehemence  in  the presence of the Party  Chairman,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Queenstown, who remained so  silent,\r\n\r\noverawed  by  the occasion, that I thought  he  must\r\n\r\nhave  had  the  authority to speak  on  his  behalf.\r\n\r\nHowever, that is a matter for them to clear up.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  he did say, and what was recorded on the tape,\r\n\r\nis  this:  \"Barisan Sosialis mistakenly used  Penang\r\n\r\nand  Malacca\",  I  quote the words  in  the  debate,\r\n\r\n\"mistakenly  used Penang and Malacca\", and  I  quote\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Anson's exact  words,  \"They  have\r\n\r\nadmitted  their  mistake. They have  withdrawn  it.\"\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, whether --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What date?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> \"They have admitted their\r\n\r\nmistake.

They  have\r\n\r\nadmitted their mistake. They have withdrawn it.\" Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, whether or not the Opposition  Members\r\n\r\nmade  a mistake in asking for complete merger  like\r\n\r\nPenang  - or Malacca or Johore or, as the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson says, \"complete and unconditional merger as  a\r\n\r\nstate on an equal basis with the other states,\"  the\r\n\r\nfact  remains  that  there can be no  constitutional\r\n\r\nmistake,  because the constitutional  terms  of  the\r\n\r\nother 11 States are questions of fact which can  be\r\n\r\ndetermined   by   a  study  of  the   constitutional\r\n\r\ndocuments  of  the  Federation  of  Malaya,  namely,\r\n\r\nfirst,  the Federation of Malaya Agreement of  1948,\r\n\r\nsecond,   the   Federation  of  Malaya   (Amendment)\r\n\r\nAgreement,  1952, third, the Constitution,  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation   of  Malaya,  1957,  and  fourth,   Nine\r\n\r\nNationality Laws of the Nine Malay Sultanates.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  terms therefore under which the 11 States  were\r\n\r\nbrought   together  and  the  laws  regulating   the\r\n\r\nacquisition of citizenship by the people of  the  11\r\n\r\nStates  can  be spelt out from these documents.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  subsequently  said that  they  want  automatic\r\n\r\nconversion  of Singapore citizenship into Federation\r\n\r\ncitizenship and there has been support  now  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson and the Member for Hong Lim.  Sir,\r\n\r\nif  the constitutional documents contain either,  by\r\n\r\nprecedent or by analogy, provisions to support  such\r\n\r\na  claim, then I say, let a judicial or any fair and\r\n\r\nimpartial tribunal so find it. But if, in fact,  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional documents contain no such  provisions\r\n\r\nupon  which  such a claim can be founded,  then,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the  claim will be rejected. The  words  in\r\n\r\nalternative  (b)  that have been spelt  out  in  the\r\n\r\nmotion - \"complete and unconditional merger\" and  the\r\n\r\nphrase \"as a state on an equal basis with the  other\r\n\r\nstates\" are those that have been used by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson. Sir, he, being the lawyer amongst  them,\r\n\r\nhas  used  words which more legalistically  describe\r\n\r\nwhat   the  Barisan  Sosialis  have  ineptly  called\r\n\r\n\"complete merger like Penang and Malacca\", and which\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim has described as  \"complete\r\n\r\nmerger  parallel to Johore\". He said in  Hansard  of\r\n\r\nthe  23rd  of  November, 1961, col.  557,  with  his\r\n\r\neloquent rhetoric on that occasion:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`And, Sir, in case there is any suggestion as to\r\n\r\nwhen I and My Party....'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  I  do not know whether the Government Printer\r\n\r\nwas  given  the recording on the tape, but obviously\r\n\r\nthe  importance of that occasion did not escape him,\r\n\r\nbecause  he printed \"I\" and \"My\" in capitals - \"I  and\r\n\r\nMy   Party\" - no  doubt  after  the  script  had  been\r\n\r\ncorrected  by the Member for Anson. And  it  is  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  this  occasion for  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson.  \"I and My Party\" said he; not small \"m\"  and\r\n\r\nsmall  \"i\" but a big \"M\" and a big \"I\", Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister ought to bring the Government Printer  into\r\n\r\nthe  debate.  I  do  not know whether  that  was  an\r\n\r\nalteration made by the Member for Anson. He will  be\r\n\r\nable to tell us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No doubt at the appropriate\r\n\r\nmoment,  he  will elucidate and give the  House  the\r\n\r\nengaging reason\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhy  the words are printed in black type.

We  must\r\n\r\nrecognise that there can be no reality of unity,  no\r\n\r\nidentification of the Federation and Singapore if we\r\n\r\npursue different policies in education and labour. I\r\n\r\ndo  honestly believe, Sir, that the P.A.P. errs when\r\n\r\nit says that the people of Singapore will not accept\r\n\r\nthat the whole of Malaya should be in control of our\r\n\r\neducation and labour policies. I believe that if the\r\n\r\nissue were put to the people of Singapore, ---'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"if the issue\" - this is the issue.

But,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, what I am grateful to the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson for is having put in legalistic language words\r\n\r\nwhich we have now found most appropriate to pose  as\r\n\r\na  second alternative of the three choices to be put\r\n\r\nbefore the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make this point, that what we\r\n\r\nare  doing now is exactly what the Member for  Anson\r\n\r\nwanted us to do, to put the issue in those words. We\r\n\r\nhave,  of  course,  I hope with due  decorum  and  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit of modesty, left out the P.A.P. from  the\r\n\r\ndescription  of  the White Paper as  adopted  by  33\r\n\r\nMembers  of this Assembly. But if it is the wish  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  that their names should  appear  as\r\n\r\nadjectives to the second alternative, I think we  on\r\n\r\nthis  side of the House are quite willing  to  allow\r\n\r\nthem to describe the second alternative as sired  by\r\n\r\nthem. Since it is a motley crowd, it is difficult to\r\n\r\nknow out of whom which was sired. But, nevertheless,\r\n\r\nwe  are  quite prepared not to allow this to  be  an\r\n\r\nabortion  because abortions are horrible things.  We\r\n\r\nwill  allow them to put their hallmark on the second\r\n\r\nalternative and, as the Member for Anson said in the\r\n\r\nthird  radio forum of the 27th of June, if  he  were\r\n\r\nallowed  to put it exactly in those words, he  would\r\n\r\nbe quite happy --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Oh, be fair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Why?

By reason and  logic  we  are\r\n\r\nentitled to as much as what was afforded to  the  11\r\n\r\nStates.  I  have said before, and I repeat  it  now,\r\n\r\nthat it is the duty of the Government to see that we\r\n\r\nare  treated  as  favourably as  any  of  the  other\r\n\r\nStates.  But  I  cannot promise to  get  terms  more\r\n\r\nfavourable than those for the 11 States. Alternative\r\n\r\n(a),   which  is  Cmd.  Paper  33  of  1961,  giving Singapore \r\n\r\nlocal autonomy in education and labour, is a  variation  of  the\r\n\r\nnorm of the terms  of  the  11 States.  We  believe, Sir, that this\r\n\r\nis a  variation for the better to suit the special circumstances  of \r\n\r\nSingapore,    because   of   Singapore's    separate developments since\r\n\r\nits separation in 1945  from  the rest of the Straits Settlements and Malaya,\r\n\r\nseparate developments particularly in policies in labour  and education, \r\n\r\nand  also  because  of  the  fact   that citizenship has already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  granted  by registration to some 340,000  non-Singapore   born  persons  under  laws  which   were\r\n\r\ndifferent from those in the Federation. But although\r\n\r\nwe  believe  that these arrangements  in  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  are  better  than complete and  unconditional\r\n\r\nmerger as a State in the Federation, nevertheless we\r\n\r\nshall  bow to the will of the people if they  choose\r\n\r\ncomplete and unconditional merger in preference to a\r\n\r\nmerger  which bestows on us or leaves us with  large\r\n\r\npowers of local autonomy, not just in education  and\r\n\r\nlabour, but health, welfare and so on as set out  in\r\n\r\nthe White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the haze of the dust churned up by wilful\r\n\r\nand  malicious  propaganda, it might  be  useful  to\r\n\r\nremind everybody what is the meaning of complete and\r\n\r\nunconditional merger, and how it compares  with  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional arrangements in the White Paper which\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis and their Communist stooges and\r\n\r\nfriends and sympathisers have chosen to describe  as\r\n\r\na  phoney merger. Sir, in a complete merger, even if\r\n\r\nfor the sake of argument we asume that the condition\r\n\r\nasked  for  by  the  Barisan Sosialis  of  automatic\r\n\r\nconversion of citizenship were granted and agreed to\r\n\r\nby  all  the  other 11 States, first, education  and\r\n\r\nlabour  will  have to be controlled by  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  all  our revenue  which  pays  for\r\n\r\nlabour, education, welfare, health services and  all\r\n\r\nthe  other powers of local autonomy will have to  go\r\n\r\nto  the  Central Government to defray  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nthese  services. On the other hand, the White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposals leave more than 75 per cent of our revenue\r\n\r\nat   the   disposal  of  the  Singapore  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is 75 per cent now!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, under complete and\r\n\r\nunconditional merger, this Assembly will become like\r\n\r\nany  of  the other Assemblies in the 11 States.  Its\r\n\r\npowers  will  be  reduced to  those  of  Penang,  or\r\n\r\nJohore, or Pahang, or Perlis; multi-lingualism  will\r\n\r\ncease, and many of the present hon.

For example,  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  allocation of scholarships, entry  into\r\n\r\nthe  civil service on a 4 to 1 basis, preference  to\r\n\r\nMalays,  where other things are equal  in  order  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them  in  business  and  such  things  as  bus\r\n\r\nlicences, tenders, and so forth-all these provisions\r\n\r\nregarding  preferences will not apply  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nunder alternative (a), the White Paper Agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill's amendment which\r\n\r\nwill  offer  the people alternative (c)  will  allow\r\n\r\nthem  to choose terms no less favourable than  those\r\n\r\nfor  the  Borneo territories, if they consider  that\r\n\r\nthese  terms  are  more suitable to  Singapore  than\r\n\r\neither  (a)  merger under the White  Paper,  or  (b)\r\n\r\ncomplete and unconditional merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am obliged.

Would the Prime Minister  indicate\r\n\r\nwhether he anticipates that the terms offered to the\r\n\r\nBornean  territories would be published at the  time\r\n\r\nthe referendum is taken?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I have no desire to\r\n\r\nanticipate the conference in London which is to take\r\n\r\nplace, as I understand it, at the beginning of  next\r\n\r\nweek.  I  am arguing here on the basis of  principle\r\n\r\nthat  whatever is offered to the Borneo territories,\r\n\r\nno  less  favourable  terms  should  be  offered  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  That is the proposal made by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill and I accept it unreservedly. And  no\r\n\r\ndoubt if the alternative is pursued, all those terms\r\n\r\nwill have to be published.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is reason and logic in this: since we\r\n\r\nare  all  going to be States in one Federation,  the\r\n\r\nterms that bring us together, although they may vary\r\n\r\nbecause  of  our  differing  circumstances,   should\r\n\r\nnevertheless be substantially equal. What is offered\r\n\r\nto  the  Borneo territories may not be suitable  for\r\n\r\nSingapore,  but whatever is offered to  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories must also be offered to Singapore if the\r\n\r\npeople   of   Singapore  prefer   these   terms   to\r\n\r\nalternative (a) the White Paper, or (b) complete and\r\n\r\nunconditional  merger.  We  accept  this  amendment,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  that  the  people  be  offered  a  third\r\n\r\nchoice, to enter Malaysia on terms no less favourable \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan the terms for the Borneo territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I noticed from yesterday's newspapers that\r\n\r\nsome  19  Opposition  Members have  written  to  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations  giving their views  on  the  coming\r\n\r\nmerger and the referendum. They have made scurrilous\r\n\r\nand  unfounded allegations. I need hardly say,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  we  on this side of the House fear nothing.  I\r\n\r\nsay  to  this House now, and I say it to  any  other\r\n\r\nAssembly  or any other august tribunal, be  it  from\r\n\r\nthe  United Nations or any of its agencies, that  we\r\n\r\ncan  prove  that  these alternatives  posed  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  can withstand the closest  scrutiny  and\r\n\r\nthe  most stringent test of reason and logic and the\r\n\r\nrealities of the position in Malaya and Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first principle of any federation is that all\r\n\r\nStates are dealt with equally and that the norm,  or\r\n\r\nrather, the equivalent of what was given to  the  11\r\n\r\nStates of the Federation should also be available to\r\n\r\nany  new  member  if the new member desires  it.  If\r\n\r\nthere is to be any variation, it will be a variation\r\n\r\nfrom  this  norm with something added and  something\r\n\r\nsubtracted, the result being more or less the  same.\r\n\r\nWe say that the White Paper is that variation of the\r\n\r\nnorm   which   suits  Singapore  best.  The   Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories  will have terms worked out  which  will\r\n\r\nsuit  the Borneo territories best. I repeat: if  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore desire the terms either of  the 11 States of the present Federation, or of the three\r\n\r\nStates  of  the  Borneo territories, then  they  are\r\n\r\nentitled  to  them, and the Government  will  ensure\r\n\r\nthat their wishes are complied with. But to get more\r\n\r\nthan what was given to the 11 present States of  the\r\n\r\nFederation or more than what is to be given  to  the\r\n\r\nthree Borneo territories is something not within the\r\n\r\nrealms  of reality. To put as an alternative  choice\r\n\r\nto  the  people something which is not possible,  as\r\n\r\nhas   been   suggested  by  some  Members   of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition, would be a fraud on the people - offering\r\n\r\nthem  on  the  menu something which we know  is  not\r\n\r\ncontained in the larder. Any Party in this House, be\r\n\r\nit  the  S.P.A. or the Workers' Party of the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson,  is  entitled to  communicate  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government and the Prime\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister direct and to try and negotiate for  better\r\n\r\nterms. The Member for Anson has tried and he  knows\r\n\r\nwhat  the  realities are. The Member  for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\ncannot  be  unaware  of  the Tunku's  views  on  the\r\n\r\nmatter.  And  even the Communist-controlled  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,   through  their  open  front   Secretary-General, Mr Lim Ching Siong, in April, a few months\r\n\r\nago,  sent  a  letter to Tunku Abdul Rahman  by  the\r\n\r\npersonal  hand  of  the Assistant Secretary-General.\r\n\r\nWhat the letter contains presumably is only known to\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary-General and the Tunku. But  everybody\r\n\r\ncan  guess  what  this gesture of  peace-making  was\r\n\r\naimed  at.  However, the very fact that neither  the\r\n\r\nletter  nor the response of the Tunku to the  letter\r\n\r\nhas ever been made public --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Even to the Chairman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> --- probably even to the Chairman\r\n\r\nof  the Party, is in itself significant. Unlike  the\r\n\r\nOpposition,  the  Government's  duty  is   to   make\r\n\r\npractical,  realistic  arrangements  for   the   the\r\n\r\npeople's  future in Malaysia. We are  not  concerned\r\n\r\nwith  our  personal  or our Party  future.  That  is\r\n\r\nunimportant.  What  is  important  is   the   future\r\n\r\nwell-being  and security of the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nand of the people of Malaysia. We have done whatever\r\n\r\nis  possible  in  the  White  Paper  proposals.  The\r\n\r\nCommunists know that when the people choose  between\r\n\r\nthe   three  alternatives  - (a)  White  Paper,   (b)\r\n\r\ncomplete  and  unconditional merger, and  (c)  enter\r\n\r\nMalaysia on terms no less favourable than those  for\r\n\r\nthe  Borneo territories - the overwhelming choice  of\r\n\r\nthe people will be for the White Paper. Then the lie\r\n\r\nto the propaganda line of the Communists that merger\r\n\r\nis phoney will be nailed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall let the events of the next few years,\r\n\r\nparticularly in the field of economic and industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion after merger and Malaysia, prove how  real\r\n\r\nmerger  and the common market is to the daily  lives\r\n\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after merger has been implemented, it is true\r\n\r\nthat some of the first\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npersons  to find out that merger is not phoney  will\r\n\r\nbe  the Communists. A very strong Central Government\r\n\r\nof  an independent Malaysia will have a tonic effect\r\n\r\non   the   political  stability  and  the   peaceful\r\n\r\nconditions in Singapore which will be to the benefit\r\n\r\nof  everybody. But, in the meantime, it is our duty,\r\n\r\nin  so far as the Communists and their stooges  talk\r\n\r\nof  peaceful  action and talk of using peaceful  and\r\n\r\nconstitutional methods, to allow them to do so in so\r\n\r\nfar as the law and the rules are observed. It is our\r\n\r\nbusiness  to  counter  their  lies.

The Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nalso  referred  in  passing  to  the  referendum  in\r\n\r\nNewfoundland. In the referendum in Newfoundland,  as\r\n\r\nwe   all   know,  the  people  were  offered   three\r\n\r\nalternatives:  (1) to remain as  a  colony;  (2)  to\r\n\r\nbecome  independent;  or (3) to  be  federated  with\r\n\r\nCanada.

Then it would  be  a  fair  one.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  how can they compare our  referendum  to\r\n\r\nthe  referendum  in Newfoundland? In addition,  Sir,\r\n\r\nmay  I  also  remark  in passing  that  Newfoundland\r\n\r\nrecognised  the  universal  principle  of  a   clear\r\n\r\nmajority  in  the referendum? If you remember,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthey  had to hold two referenda because in the first\r\n\r\nreferendum  there was no clear majority for  any  of\r\n\r\nthe  choices  offered to the people. In our  present\r\n\r\ncase  in  Singapore, Sir, we have a dictatorial  and\r\n\r\ndishonest Government that do not even recognise  the\r\n\r\nuniversal principle of a clear majority in the  case\r\n\r\nof  voting. Sir, as I remarked when I first  sat  on\r\n\r\nthis  side  of  the House, we are  all  students  of\r\n\r\npolitics and we will always be learning, Sir, unlike\r\n\r\nsome  people  who pose as masters but who,  in  fact\r\n\r\ngrovel at the feet of dictators to learn how  to  be\r\n\r\ndictatorial and to be unjust and dishonest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister takes great delight in\r\n\r\ntalking  of  first principles.

And  again,  he\r\n\r\ntalked  of  first principles in his speech  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  on  the  4th of July when  he  made  a  silly\r\n\r\nattempt  to defend and to justify the most abhorrent\r\n\r\nand  distatorial clauses 28 and 29 of the Referendum\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion, Sir, requests that the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  be asked to express their choice  on  the\r\n\r\nmode  and manner of the inevitable reunification  of\r\n\r\nthe two territories. Sir, on first principles, I say\r\n\r\nthat  if you wish to ask the people to express their\r\n\r\nchoice  on  any matter, then you first consult  them\r\n\r\nbefore you make a decision on the matter. It is only\r\n\r\nafter  there is full consultation that any  decision\r\n\r\ncan  be reached. But, in the present instance,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. had already made up their minds and  had\r\n\r\nreached  agreement  with the  Federation  Government\r\n\r\nbefore  any  information of the  matter  was  placed\r\n\r\nbefore  the people. The Deputy Prime Minister  first\r\n\r\ninformed  the leaders of the Opposition on the  26th\r\n\r\nof August, 1961, of the agreement already reached in\r\n\r\nprinciple  between the two Prime  Ministers  on  the\r\n\r\n23rd  August,  1961.  You see.  Sir,  agreement  had\r\n\r\nalready been reached in principle when the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore were informed of the matter. There was  no\r\n\r\nconsultation  and the P.A.P. White  Paper  proposals\r\n\r\nwere a fait accompli.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us trace the events as they were unfolded\r\n\r\nbefore us last year. We had an inkling of the  sell-out  proposals of the P.A.P. while we were still  in\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P., and it was because there had been  this\r\n\r\nintra-party difference of opinion and views  on  the\r\n\r\nmatter  and  because of non-consultation that  there\r\n\r\nwas  a  split  in  the P.A.P., with  the  consequent\r\n\r\nformation  of the Barisan Sosialis. We  had  clearly\r\n\r\nthen  shown  to  the people that the P.A.P. leaders\r\n\r\nwere  imposing an intra-party dictatorship and  that\r\n\r\nthey  had deviated from their original P.A.P. stand.\r\n\r\nI  dare  say that the Member for Bras Basah recently\r\n\r\ndiscovered the same errors in the P.A.P. leadership.\r\n\r\nAfter  we  had  left the P.A.P. and had  formed  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, we repeatedly called for a general\r\n\r\nelection in order that the people of Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould  elect  a  government more  representative  of\r\n\r\ntheir views on the issue of merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is\r\n\r\nthis  sordid  whitewashing of  the  failure  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  plot  relevant to the  motion  in  my  name\r\n\r\nposing the alternatives?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Member for Queenstown is\r\n\r\nattacking  the phrase \"on the mode and  manner\".  He\r\n\r\nhas  indicated that it should not be there, and that\r\n\r\nthe  people should have first been consulted  before\r\n\r\nthat phrase came in that motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister hates to be\r\n\r\nreminded that he has made promises to the people and\r\n\r\nhas  broken faith with them. That is why he does not\r\n\r\nlike  me to repeat all this, Sir. But I think it  is\r\n\r\ngood  that  we  should  have a  record  of  all  the\r\n\r\ninfidelity of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We felt, Sir, that the general election should be\r\n\r\nheld before the P.A.P. Government should commit  the\r\n\r\nfate   and  the  future  of  Singapore  to   certain\r\n\r\nproposals which the P.A.P. leaders had in mind.  But\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P., as expected, did not heed our call.  If\r\n\r\nthey  had  been  sincere in wanting to  consult  the\r\n\r\npeople  and in asking them to make their  choice  on\r\n\r\nthe mode and manner of merger, then they should have\r\n\r\nheeded  our  call and held a general election.  But,\r\n\r\nno, the P.A.P. leaders were scared. They were afraid\r\n\r\nthey  would  lose their present posh  jobs  in  air-conditioned rooms, and they did not want to  consult\r\n\r\nthe  people  in a general election. They, therefore,\r\n\r\ncountered  the  clamour for a  general  election  in\r\n\r\norder  to  let the people express their  choice  and\r\n\r\nwishes on a merger issue by offering instead to hold\r\n\r\na  referendum,  and the decision was made  with  the\r\n\r\nannouncement  on the radio forum in September  1961.\r\n\r\nOf  course, another good reason for the decision  of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. to hold a referendum instead of a general\r\n\r\nelection  was that the Government need  not  resign,\r\n\r\neven if the P.A.P. should lose in the referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as it became more and more clear that the\r\n\r\nmerger proposals of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P. were unacceptable to the people,  the  three\r\n\r\nOpposition Parties, namely, the Workers' Party,  the\r\n\r\nUnited  People's  Party  and the  Barisan  Sosialis,\r\n\r\nwrote  to  the Deputy Prime Minister on 6th October,\r\n\r\n1961,  and  jointly  asked for  a  special  Assembly\r\n\r\nsitting  in order to discuss the question of merger,\r\n\r\nbut  the request of the Opposition Parties was again\r\n\r\nrefused.  We  asked  that the  merger  proposals  be\r\n\r\ndiscussed  in the Legislative Assembly, but  instead\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. leaders went merrily along ignoring  all\r\n\r\nour pleas for consultation on the fate and future of\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore. Meanwhile, through pressure\r\n\r\nof   public   opinion  and  through  pressure   from\r\n\r\nOpposition  Parties asking that the details  of  the\r\n\r\nmerger proposals be disclosed, there was this \"strip-tease\"  performance  of  revelation  of  the  merger\r\n\r\nproposals in dribs and drabs. Thus, Sir, we can  see\r\n\r\nthere was no consultation whatsoever of the opinions\r\n\r\nand  views of the Opposition Parties. The P.A.P. had\r\n\r\nnot dared to reveal the details all at once, because\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. leaders knew that such a revelation would\r\n\r\nraise an outcry against the Government straightaway.\r\n\r\nSo  the  people  of Singapore did not  know  of  the\r\n\r\nmerger  proposals until these proposals were  tabled\r\n\r\nfor  debate  in the House on the 20th  of  November,\r\n\r\n1961.  So  what is all this humbug about asking  the\r\n\r\npeople  to express their choice? Where is the choice\r\n\r\nas  freely expressed by the will of the people? Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  only  genuine  expression  of  choice  will  be\r\n\r\nthrough a general election when the people can elect\r\n\r\na  Party  that puts up the form of merger  proposals\r\n\r\nthat best meets their approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. did not allow the people this free\r\n\r\nexpression  of  choice when that free expression  of\r\n\r\nchoice was most vital and necessary, that is, before\r\n\r\nagreement  was reached in principle and  before  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. foisted  on the people their  sell-out  fait\r\n\r\naccompli.  The Government's only excuse  to  justify\r\n\r\ntheir  perfidious  act of not having  consulted  the\r\n\r\npeople\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\non  their  own  future is that the  P.A.P. had  the\r\n\r\nmandate from the people when the P.A.P. were elected\r\n\r\nto office in 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is another falsehood which the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas  kept on repeating time and time again for  want\r\n\r\nof  a  better line. The P.A.P. leaders never  had  a\r\n\r\nmerger  mandate from the people. The Five-Year  Plan\r\n\r\nwas  the mandate the P.A.P. received from the people\r\n\r\n- the \"bible\" which the Members of the S.P.A. used to\r\n\r\nproduce,  whenever they talked of the  P.A.P.  Plan.\r\n\r\nBut  it looks as if all the promises the P.A.P. made\r\n\r\nin the Five-Year Plan have now been clean forgotten.\r\n\r\nThere  was no talk, Sir, of merger in the speech  of\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  in  the  first  year,\r\n\r\nneither was there a whisper of merger in the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech in the  second  year.  So,\r\n\r\nmerger, Sir, was never a mandate given to the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nAnd  indeed if the people had decided to vote  in  a\r\n\r\nParty  on the merger issue, it is my guess that  the\r\n\r\npeople  would  have voted in the S.P.A. whose  1959\r\n\r\nelection  slogan  was,  \"If you  want  merger,  vote\r\n\r\nS.P.A.,\"  especially  as the  Tun  is  on  the  most\r\n\r\nfriendly  terms  with  the  Prime  Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation, whereas the same could not and cannot be\r\n\r\nsaid  of  the P.A.P. And the S.P.A. - the Party  that\r\n\r\nhad the best prospects for merger at that particular\r\n\r\ntime,  the Party that had merger as one of its  main\r\n\r\nslogans  - suffered a trouncing defeat. This  clearly\r\n\r\ndemonstrates  that the people of Singapore  did  not\r\n\r\nhave  merger  on  their minds when  they  voted  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. into office in 1959. Now the P.A.P. want  to\r\n\r\nmake  this utterly ridiculous false claim that  they\r\n\r\nhad  a merger mandate from the people. In fact, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe only time the P.A.P. made any play on merger was\r\n\r\nduring  the  Anson  by-election  and,  as  everybody\r\n\r\nknows,   their  merger  proposals  were   completely\r\n\r\nrejected  by  the people in Anson in July  1961.  At\r\n\r\nthat  time the P.A.P. loudly proclaimed that a  vote\r\n\r\nfor the P.A.P. was a vote for the P.A.P. merger, and\r\n\r\nthinking  that  the P.A.P. were going  to  win,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Culture took great pains  to  describe\r\n\r\nthe ward in Anson as the most representative ward in\r\n\r\nthe  whole  of  Singapore.  All  this  now  Sir,  is\r\n\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> It\r\n\r\nwas a stab in the back!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The people of Singapore must\r\n\r\nclearly  understand that the P.A.P. never  had  this\r\n\r\nmandate on merger. So let us get rid of this  hocus-pocus  of  the  P.A.P. On the other hand,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. had  the  clearest  responsibility - as   was\r\n\r\npromised  in  Anson  and subsequently  both  by  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister - and by the Prime  Minister - to  put forward their merger proposals to the people\r\n\r\nfor  acceptance or rejection. There is no necessity,\r\n\r\nSir, to pose alternatives to the people. Indeed,  in\r\n\r\nany referendum, Sir, only one single question should\r\n\r\nbe posed to the people and that question should only\r\n\r\nrequire a simple answer of yes or no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I explained during the debate on the Referendum\r\n\r\nBill, the correct translation of \"referendum\" should\r\n\r\nbe  chyuen  min fu chyueh, that is, the  people  are\r\n\r\nasked  to  endorse the Bill or motion that had  been\r\n\r\npassed  in  the Legislative Assembly. In  our  case,\r\n\r\nSir, the merger proposals of the P.A.P., as embodied\r\n\r\nin Command Paper No. 33 of 1961, have been passed in\r\n\r\nthe Assembly and these proposals should now be posed\r\n\r\nto the people for their acceptance or rejection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now remind the Prime Minister and the other\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Ministers of the numerous promises they  have\r\n\r\nmade to the people of Singapore - promises which they\r\n\r\nhave now forgotten, but which will bear testimony to\r\n\r\nthe perfidy of the Prime Minister and the P.A.P. for\r\n\r\nyears  and years to come. On the 11th of July. 1961,\r\n\r\nat  a  mass rally in Anson, the Prime Minister said,\r\n\r\n\"Merger   must  be  decided  by  the   people,   not\r\n\r\nMinisters.\"  Not  Ministers,  Sir,  \"Merger  is   an\r\n\r\nimportant question. If agreement is reached with the\r\n\r\nFederation  today,\" he said, \"and the people  reject\r\n\r\nit  tomorrow, then that will not do.\" You  note  the\r\n\r\nword  \"reject\", Sir. To reject means to reject  one\r\n\r\nset of proposals, and it does not mean compelling  a\r\n\r\nperson to chose another alternative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, on the 13th of July, the Prime Minister said\r\n\r\nthe  same thing. He said that the people will decide\r\n\r\nwhether or not we want merger, not by a few of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nus  or  by  a  political Party.  But  see  what  has\r\n\r\nhappened  today. The P.A.P., in the  person  of  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister and the Minister for Finance, decided\r\n\r\non   merger   with  the  connivance  of  the   other\r\n\r\nMinisters - not the people - only the P.A.P. decided  on\r\n\r\nmerger.  And now the people are asked to  choose  on\r\n\r\nthe  mode and manner of this merger which the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave foisted on the people. Now these are all solemn\r\n\r\nwords, and the Minister for Finance has always  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  Prime  Minister  weighs  his  words  very\r\n\r\ncarefully. According to the Minister for Health  and\r\n\r\nLaw,  there  is  perfect co-ordination  between  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's brain and tongue.  Has  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  then forgotten these solemn words  uttered\r\n\r\non  a  solemn  occasion, as promised to the  people?\r\n\r\nSir,  I can quote you umpteen examples of the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  making  promises  of  placing  before  the\r\n\r\npeople   the   proposals  for  their   approval   or\r\n\r\nrejection,  but  I  will  spare  you  the  ache   of\r\n\r\nlistening  to  a  catalogue of  broken  promises  by\r\n\r\nMinisters elected by the people and who had promised\r\n\r\nto  work  for the interests of the people.  Even  on\r\n\r\nTeachers'  Day,  Sir,  in  August  1961,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  had told a large gathering of teachers  in\r\n\r\nthe  Happy  World  Stadium  that  merger  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions  would  be presented to  the  people  for\r\n\r\napproval.  You  will  note,  Sir,  that  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister never said anything about mode and  manner.\r\n\r\nThere  was no talk about mode and manner of  merger,\r\n\r\nSir.  There  was only one type of merger  which  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. had  in mind - the merger proposals  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. which are embodied in Command Paper No. 33 of\r\n\r\n1961.  All along, he said-and at times that was  all\r\n\r\nhe  said - that  the  merger proposals  would  be  put\r\n\r\nbefore  the people for approval or rejection with  a\r\n\r\nsimple yes or no. That is what the people understood\r\n\r\nof  his words - \"The people will decide.\" But see what\r\n\r\nhas  happened,  Sir? See the way the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\ntalks  today. He has forgotten the original  promise\r\n\r\nof placing before the people the merger proposals he\r\n\r\nwas  negotiating supposedly on behalf of the  people\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, may I, for the record, remind the House also\r\n\r\nof what the Deputy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister said in a letter to Opposition Party\r\n\r\nleaders  on  the  6th of September, 1961?  He  said,\r\n\r\n\"When  the  deliberations of the working  party  are\r\n\r\ncompleted  and agreement is reached, they will  also\r\n\r\nbe  published. The people can then either accept  or\r\n\r\nreject them.\" Sir, these are very solemn words  - all\r\n\r\npromises made in black and white. Have they  such  a\r\n\r\nshort memory?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> They have no memory!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Dr  Lee  Siew  Choh: I agree with the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill, Sir, that they have no memory. They  will\r\n\r\nonly  remember when they once again meet the  people\r\n\r\nfor their verdict on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, again, on the 14th of October, 1961, the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  in  a letter to Opposition  leaders\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is the intention of Government when all the\r\n\r\ndetails have been worked out to publish a Paper  and\r\n\r\ntable  it  in  the Legislative Assembly for  debate.\r\n\r\nThen the people can accept or reject them.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note the words, Sir, \"accept or reject them\". All\r\n\r\nthese  are  solemn promises, promises  made  to  the\r\n\r\npeople   that  the  P.A.P. would  allow   them   an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to accept or reject the  P.A.P. merger\r\n\r\nproposals  as we know them today. And all  this,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,   can   only  be  done  in  a   one-question\r\n\r\nreferendum.  There  was  never  any  talk,  Sir,  of\r\n\r\nalternatives to be put before the people. And in all\r\n\r\nthe  promises made by the Deputy Prime Minister  and\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister, the undertaking was  that  the\r\n\r\nmerger proposals would be posed to the people for  a\r\n\r\nclear answer of yes or no, accept or reject, approve\r\n\r\nor  disapprove,  in a one-question  referendum.  All\r\n\r\nthese  are  solemn promises made and are on  record,\r\n\r\nand  therefore it is only right and proper that only\r\n\r\none  question on the White Paper Command No.  33  of\r\n\r\n1961  be  now  posed to the people  for  the  simple\r\n\r\nanswer  of  yes  or no. Indeed it would  be  a  true\r\n\r\nchyuen  min  fu  chyueh,  because  the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nCommand  No.  33  has  already been  passed  by  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly and this White Paper  must  now\r\n\r\nbe  taken  to  the  people  for  their  approval  or\r\n\r\nrejection. Hence my amendment, Sir.

A complete\r\n\r\nand  unconditional  merger as a State  on  an  equal\r\n\r\nbasis  with the other 11 States.

The  word\r\n\r\n\"unconditional\" can mean many things,  Sir,  but  if\r\n\r\n\"conditional\" means that we get automatic Federal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\ncitizenship and proportionate representation,  then,\r\n\r\nof  course,  that  word will not  be   objectionable.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, that word can only be understood  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and it will allow the P.A.P. too  much  room\r\n\r\nfor  their dishonest manoeuvres. The Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  said  that  this  second alternative  which  he\r\n\r\noffers  as a so-called choice to the people is  what\r\n\r\nwe  in the Barisan Sosialis have asked for. I do not\r\n\r\nknow what this alternative really means in spite  of\r\n\r\nthe  limited explanation given by the Prime Minster.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no White Paper on this second alternative\r\n\r\nand   we  are  in  no  position  to  know  the  true\r\n\r\nsignificance of this alternative with no White Paper\r\n\r\non  it. But it is significant, Sir, that there is no\r\n\r\nlonger  any  mention in the question  posed  of  the\r\n\r\nPenang type merger. Probably this is a new switch of\r\n\r\nP.A.P. falsehoods and propaganda. They have come  to\r\n\r\nrealise  that the people cannot be further  deceived\r\n\r\nby  their  malicious falsehoods and their distortion\r\n\r\nof  the  Opposition's stand on merger. Sir,  I  will\r\n\r\nleave  the third alternative which will be  proposed\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Cairnhill and will hear what  he\r\n\r\nhas to say before we give our views on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have a motion standing in my name asking\r\n\r\nthat  this  House  condemn the  Government  for  its\r\n\r\ndishonest   and   malicious   distortion   of    the\r\n\r\nOpposition's stand on the merger issue,  whereby  it\r\n\r\nseeks  to  mislead  and confuse the  people  in  the\r\n\r\nforthcoming  referendum. As you  have  indicated.  I\r\n\r\nwill  now  speak on this aspect of the  debate.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  let me take you back to  the  recent\r\n\r\npast  when  the Government indicated, through  radio\r\n\r\ntalks  and  speeches  by Mr  Jek  Yuen  Thong,  the\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretary to the Prime Minister, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister himself and the Minister for Finance,  that\r\n\r\nin   the   forthcoming  referendum  on  merger   two\r\n\r\nquestions would be posed to the people, namely,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's merger proposals as embodied  in  White\r\n\r\nPaper  Command  33  of 1961, and (2)  the  so-called\r\n\r\nPenang/Malacca   type  merger   which   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  said  would  automatically  disfranchise\r\n\r\nhalf  our citizens in Singapore. The P.A.P., through\r\n\r\ntheir propaganda machine,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRadio   P.A.P.,   Rediffusion  and  the   partially-controlled  Press had been drumming into the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore day in and day out that the Opposition\r\n\r\nParties   have   been  advocating   this   so-called\r\n\r\nPenang/Malacca  type  merget. The  P.A.P. have  all\r\n\r\nalong  been  saying, i.e. until very recently,  that\r\n\r\nthe  reason  why  they offer this so-called  Penang/\r\n\r\nMalacca  type  merger  as  an  alternative  in   the\r\n\r\nforthcoming  referendum is that they wish  to  allow\r\n\r\nthe  people  a  chance to choose  between  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment advocate and what the Opposition  Parties\r\n\r\nadvocate. Under this pretext of giving our people  a\r\n\r\nchance   to   choose,  the  Government   have   been\r\n\r\npropagating  the malicious falsehoods  of  this  so-called Penang type merger, a merger which the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nallege   is  the  merger  stand  of  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nParties. Now the Prime Minister says it is the  same\r\n\r\nas the stand of the U.P.P. which asks for, according\r\n\r\nto  the P.A.P., a Johore type merger, and the  stand\r\n\r\nof  the  Workers' Party, according to the P.A.P. an\r\n\r\nunconditional complete merger. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwish to say from the outset that this Penang/Malacca\r\n\r\ntype  merger  is  nothing but  a  concoction  and  a\r\n\r\nfabrication  of  the P.A.P.'s genius for  distortion\r\n\r\nand  dishonesty.  No  one  has  advocated  a  merger\r\n\r\narrangement  whereby half the citizens of  Singapore\r\n\r\nare going to be automatically disfranchised. We have\r\n\r\npublicly  called  the P.A.P. liars for  telling  the\r\n\r\npeople  that  the Opposition Parties want  a  merger\r\n\r\nthat  is going to disfranchise half of our citizens,\r\n\r\nand  I  charge  them again in this House  for  their\r\n\r\nblatant dishonesty and malicious distortion  of  the\r\n\r\nstand of the Opposition Parties on the merger issue.\r\n\r\nI   charge   the   P.A.P.  Government   for   having\r\n\r\ndeliberately told our people the naked lie that this\r\n\r\nso-called  Penang  type merger of P.A.P. concoction\r\n\r\nand fabrication is what the Opposition Parties want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis have repeatedly\r\n\r\nstressed  that what we want as a basis  for  genuine\r\n\r\nmerger is (1) automatic Federal citizenship for  all\r\n\r\ncitizens   of   Singapore,  and   (2)   proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation  in the Federal Parliament.  Even  as\r\n\r\nearly as the 28th of August, 1961, i.e., even before\r\n\r\nmy  Party had its inaugural meeting, we had  made  a\r\n\r\nmajor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicy  statement on the merger issue. Let me  quote\r\n\r\njust a short paragraph, Sir, from that statement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We declare that if the representatives of the\r\n\r\npeople  of  the Federation are agreeable to  do  the\r\n\r\nsame,  we  will  pledge ourselves to  wholeheartedly\r\n\r\nexert  our  influence to win the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nto  accept full and complete merger forthwith, i.e.,\r\n\r\nwith   Singapore  as  the  twelfth  State   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation   and  Singapore  citizens  automatically\r\n\r\nbecoming    Malayan   citizens   with   proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation in the Federal Parliament like any of\r\n\r\nthe present 11 States constituting the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The 27th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The 28th of August, or the 27th\r\n\r\nmay  be. Since that statement was made, Sir, we have\r\n\r\nconsistently   stressed  that   merger   must   mean\r\n\r\nautomatic   Federal  citizenship  rights   for   all\r\n\r\nSingapore   citizens  together   with   proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation. During the inaugural meeting of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis held on 17th September, 1961,  this\r\n\r\npoint  was again stressed. The Secretary-General  of\r\n\r\nmy Party, Mr Lim Ching Siong, said, \"What does full\r\n\r\nand complete merger mean? It simply means - the entry\r\n\r\nof Singapore into the Federation of Malaya as one of\r\n\r\nits  constituent States like Penang and Malacca with\r\n\r\nall its citizens automatically becoming citizens  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation and having all the rights, privileges\r\n\r\nand  obligations like any of the other  citizens  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation.  Singapore  will  thus  become   an\r\n\r\nintegral  and  separate part of  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  having  proportional representation  in  the\r\n\r\nFederal   Parliament  like  the  other  States   and\r\n\r\nsharing  a common political life and destiny.\"  When\r\n\r\nthis  merger issue was finally brought to this House\r\n\r\nfor debate in November last year, you will remember,\r\n\r\nSir, that we moved an amendment to the motion by the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour in which we asked for a  genuine\r\n\r\nmerger  of Singapore with the Federation of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore  entering  the  Federation  as   the\r\n\r\ntwelfth    state   and   with   all   its   citizens\r\n\r\nautomatically  becoming Federal citizens  on  Merger\r\n\r\nDay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that during the debate\r\n\r\nthat  followed, our stand on merger as  embodied  in\r\n\r\nour  amendment had the full support of the  Workers'\r\n\r\nParty and the United People's Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur   amendment,   however,  was  opposed   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the S.P.A. Alliance. Is it not  utter\r\n\r\ndishonesty for the P.A.P. Government now to tell our\r\n\r\npeople  that the Opposition Parties, especially  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis,   want  a  merger   which   will\r\n\r\ndisfranchise  half our citizens - these  are  printed\r\n\r\nwords  solemnly said in this Assembly  and  recorded\r\n\r\nfor posterity. Is this not clear evidence that it is\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. who are against giving citizenship rights\r\n\r\nto our people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so very long ago, Sir, the Prime Minister in a\r\n\r\nforum  in the University of Singapore said that  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  of Singapore who were not local born  were\r\n\r\nworth   only   one   dollar - just  two   packets   of\r\n\r\ncigarettes.  That is the Prime Minister's  valuation\r\n\r\nof  the  non-local born Singapore citizens. You  can\r\n\r\nimagine  why  the Government refused to  accept  our\r\n\r\namendment! The Prime Minister never gave  a  thought\r\n\r\nto  the Singapore citizens who were not local  born,\r\n\r\nand  the  way he put a one dollar price on our  non-local  born Singapore citizens is a clear indication\r\n\r\nof  the  way our Singapore Prime Minister views  our\r\n\r\nSingapore non-local born citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first let us look into this so-called basis on\r\n\r\nwhich the P.A.P. have distorted the Opposition stand\r\n\r\non   merger.   This   whole   controversy   of   the\r\n\r\nPenang/Malacca  type  merger arose  when  we  quoted\r\n\r\nPenang  and Malacca as examples of equal constituent\r\n\r\nstates in our statements on merger. Let me quote  to\r\n\r\nyou again, Sir, the relevant policy statement of the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis made on 28th August, 1961, page  2,\r\n\r\nunder the heading, \"Our Stand on Merger.\" It reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The way ahead for real reunification for our\r\n\r\ncountry  and our people is in one of two directions:\r\n\r\n(a)  an  immediate  full and  complete  merger  with\r\n\r\nSingapore  joining the Federation as  a  constituent\r\n\r\nState  like Penang or Malacca [those fateful  words]\r\n\r\nand   (b)   as   an   autonomous   unit   within   a\r\n\r\nconfederation, with the Borneo territories coming in\r\n\r\nwhen possible.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the statement which has given rise to so\r\n\r\nmuch talk about this Penang type merger. On the same\r\n\r\npage  of  this  policy statement  in  the  following\r\n\r\nparagraph, Sir, we elaborate on what we mean by full\r\n\r\nand  complete  merger  with  Singapore  joining  the\r\n\r\nFederation as a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstituent  state like Penang and Malacca.  Let  me\r\n\r\nquote  our statement in its proper context  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  people can more clearly see how the P.A.P. have\r\n\r\ndeliberately quoted our statement out of context and\r\n\r\nhow  they have dishonestly and maliciously distorted\r\n\r\nour stand to mean something entirely different.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote, Sir, the paragraph that is the meat\r\n\r\nof our stand on merger:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We declare that if the representatives of the\r\n\r\nFederation  are agreeable to do the  same,  we  will\r\n\r\npledge   ourselves  to  wholeheartedly   exert   our\r\n\r\ninfluence to win the people of Singapore to accept a\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger forthwith, that is, with  Singapore\r\n\r\nas   the  twelfth  state  of  the  Federation,  with\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens automatically  becoming  Malayan\r\n\r\ncitizens  with  proportional representation  in  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Parliament, like any of the present  eleven\r\n\r\nstates constituting the Federation of Malaya.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will notice that we have specifically\r\n\r\nstated  in this statement what we mean by  full  and\r\n\r\ncomplete   merger   with   Singapore   becoming    a\r\n\r\nconstituent  state like Penang or Malacca.  We  have\r\n\r\nspecifically emphasised that it must mean  automatic\r\n\r\ncitizenship  rights  for all the Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\nand  the right of proportional representation in the\r\n\r\nFederal  Parliament like any of the  present  eleven\r\n\r\nstates   constituting  the  Federation  of   Malaya.\r\n\r\nNowhere  in this or any other statement made  by  my\r\n\r\nParty - or any other Opposition Party for that matter\r\n\r\n- has  this  P.A.P. fabricated  Penang/Malacca  type\r\n\r\nmerger  been  advocated. I challenge the  P.A.P. to\r\n\r\nproduce  any  evidence to say that  we  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis or any of the other Opposition Parties have\r\n\r\nadvocated a merger which will disfranchise half  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  in Singapore. If they cannot produce  this\r\n\r\nevidence, then I say they stand exposed as malicious\r\n\r\nliars and dishonest distortionists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we cited Penang and Malacca as examples\r\n\r\nof  equal  constituent  states,  it  was  clear  and\r\n\r\nobvious  to  anyone who has no evil,  dishonest  and\r\n\r\nmachiavellian  intentions that we  mentioned  Penang\r\n\r\nand  Malacca  as states - nothing else. We  mentioned\r\n\r\nMalacca  and  Penang,  because  Singapore  has  more\r\n\r\nthings in common with these two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstates than with the other states of the Federation.\r\n\r\nSingapore,  Penang and Malacca were formerly  member\r\n\r\nstates  of the Straits Settlements, and, unlike  the\r\n\r\nother  nine states of the Federation, they in common\r\n\r\ndo not have a Malay sultanate. It is obvious that if\r\n\r\nSingapore  were to merge with the Federation  as  an\r\n\r\nequal  constituent state, we would have in Singapore\r\n\r\na  Governor  not  unlike the  present  Governors  of\r\n\r\nPenang  and Malacca instead of having a Malay sultan\r\n\r\nlike  the  other states in the Federation.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhat we mean and that is what everybody with no evil\r\n\r\nand  malicious intentions understands  us  to  mean.\r\n\r\nThat  is,  everybody,  except the  dishonest  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ndistortionists, except the warped and twisted  minds\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P. genius for distortion and dishonesty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Some more?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let me trace the events as they\r\n\r\nunfolded  in  Singapore.

Therefore, I ask the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown to withdraw that word and, to be  on  the\r\n\r\nsafe side, not to use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I withdraw the word \"lies\", Sir.\r\n\r\nFalsehoods  then  and distortions  which  they  have\r\n\r\npersistently   repeated  over   Radio   P.A.P. and\r\n\r\nRediffusion ever since the merger debate last  year.\r\n\r\nFalsehoods  and  distortions which  they  hope  some\r\n\r\npeople might believe if they were repeated long  and\r\n\r\nloud  enough.  Sir,  there may be  some  people  who\r\n\r\nchoose  to  believe that we in the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nmade  a  mistake  in citing Penang  and  Malacca  as\r\n\r\nexamples  of  equal  constituent States.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister in his opening speech said that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong Lim said, \"The Barisan Sosialis have  once\r\n\r\nmade  a  mistake.\" The Prime Minister also mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  the Member for Anson said, \"They have admitted\r\n\r\ntheir  mistake. They have withdrawn it.\"  Sir,  such\r\n\r\ncomments, as far as we are concerned, may only go to\r\n\r\nadd  confusion to the P.A.P.'s distortion by  saying\r\n\r\nthat we in the Barisan Sosialis did not understand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  we  were saying when we mentioned  Penang  and\r\n\r\nMalacca  as examples of equal constituent States.  I\r\n\r\nmust say here, Sir, that we are not responsible  for\r\n\r\nanyone  who  chooses  to  believe  that  we  made  a\r\n\r\nmistake. As it is, the P.A.P.'s distortionists  have\r\n\r\nsufficiently  distorted and twisted  our  statements\r\n\r\ninto    something   entirely   beyond   recognition.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   let  not  other  people  wittingly   or\r\n\r\nunwittingly add on to the confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we did not make a mistake in our citing Penang\r\n\r\nand  Malacca as examples of constituent  States.  If\r\n\r\nthere  was  any  mistake, it was that we  completely\r\n\r\nunderestimated the evil genius and the  capacity  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. for malicious distortion and dishonesty.\r\n\r\nSir, as can be seen from the radio forum held on the\r\n\r\n12th  of  June,  1962,  it  is  clear  that  had  we\r\n\r\nmentioned  any other State of the Federation  as  an\r\n\r\nexample  of  an  equal constituent State,  we  would\r\n\r\nstill not have escaped the P.A.P.'s evil genius  for\r\n\r\ndistortion  and dishonesty. You will remember,  Sir,\r\n\r\nJohore was mentioned, and since then the P.A.P. have\r\n\r\nseized  the  opportunity to say that the Member  for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  advocated merger like  Johore,  in  which\r\n\r\ncase,  even  more  citizens would be  disfranchised.\r\n\r\nThus,  there  is now this so-called Johore  type  of\r\n\r\nmerger  which the P.A.P.'s evil genius makes out  to\r\n\r\nbe  worse than the Penang type of merger. I can only\r\n\r\nsay  there  is no limit to the depths to  which  the\r\n\r\nevil  genius of the P.A.P.'s capacity for dishonesty\r\n\r\nand distortion can sink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson pointed out the danger of\r\n\r\ncarrying  an  analogy  too  far.  He  gave  a   very\r\n\r\npicturesque example. He said, if we say  a  girl  is\r\n\r\nbeautiful like a flower, it does not mean  the  girl\r\n\r\nthrives on manure. In the radio forum on the 27th of\r\n\r\nJune,  1962, I quoted another example. I said  if  a\r\n\r\ndaughter  is asked to grow up like father,  it  does\r\n\r\nnot  mean that the daughter, when she grows  up,  is\r\n\r\ngoing to be changed into a man. I can give you  many\r\n\r\nsimilar examples, Sir, like the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nand  the  Prime  Minister. If I say that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  drinks like a fish, I am sure  he  is  not\r\n\r\nreally a fish and the Minister for Finance is not  a\r\n\r\nfish.  If I say the Member for Anson smokes  like  a\r\n\r\nchimney, I am sure he is not a chimney. Similarly, I\r\n\r\ncan say that the Minister for Home Affairs is like a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwoman.

It is clear, Sir, that  the  whole\r\n\r\npurpose  of  the P.A.P. is to try and  frighten  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore into believing that any type  of\r\n\r\nmerger, other than the type the P.A.P. want to  give\r\n\r\nus  and  are prepared to rig a referendum  to  shove\r\n\r\ndown   our   throats,  brings  with   it   automatic\r\n\r\ndisfranchisement  of a good section  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\ncitizens  - a  malicious  falsehood  which  must   be\r\n\r\nthoroughly exposed. We have pointed out before,  and\r\n\r\nwe  wish  to  emphasize here again,  that  if  there\r\n\r\nshould  be merger, then all the people who  are  now\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  Singapore should automatically  become\r\n\r\ncitizens of the Federation of Malaya on merger,  for\r\n\r\nmerger  is after all a merger of the peoples of  the\r\n\r\ntwo territories and not just the joining together of\r\n\r\ntwo  pieces of territories. To everyone with  common\r\n\r\nsense, this is the only rational, sensible and  fair\r\n\r\nway  of  treating this whole question of merger.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government is not prepared to accept\r\n\r\nall the citizens of Singapore as Federal citizens in\r\n\r\na  united Malaya on merger, then it only means  that\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  is  not prepared  for  merger  with\r\n\r\nSingapore  now. Our stand on this merger  issue  is,\r\n\r\nand  has  always been, that both Governments  should\r\n\r\nagree  that all persons who are already citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  immediately before  merger  day  will  by\r\n\r\noperation  of law become Federal citizens.  Such  an\r\n\r\narrangement, as I have already indicated,  could  be\r\n\r\ngiven legal effect in pursuance of Article 22 of the\r\n\r\nFederal  Constitution. The Tunku has said  automatic\r\n\r\ncitizenship  is possible. The only unfortunate  part\r\n\r\nof this disgraceful sell-out is that our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore Prime Minister went to negotiate with  the\r\n\r\nFederation not with the strength and support of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore, but on bended knees. I do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to go much further into it, Sir, but you  will\r\n\r\nremember  there was a party split in July  1961  and\r\n\r\nimmediately  after  that the P.A.P. leadership  was\r\n\r\nleft  with  an empty shell. The Party was shaken  to\r\n\r\nits very foundations and this was openly admitted by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance, and recently again by the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister. That is why we could not get better\r\n\r\nterms  than what we are getting today. That  is  why\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. cannot offer anything better than  their\r\n\r\nso-called merger proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now expose why the P.A.P. have wanted to put\r\n\r\nin  this  so-called  Penang type  merger,  why  they\r\n\r\ninvented this Penang type merger. There are two good\r\n\r\nreasons  for  the P.A.P. First, the P.A.P. want  an\r\n\r\nexcuse to justify posing two questions to the people\r\n\r\nin  the  referendum.  The Barisan  Sosialis  is  the\r\n\r\nlargest Opposition party and has the support of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  and  the  vast majority of  the  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is doubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All that the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  need  do is to go along to one of our  rallies\r\n\r\nand he will find that he cannot even squeeze himself\r\n\r\nthrough. If the second alternative, according to the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. thinking, is to be put to the people,  it  is\r\n\r\nobvious  that the alternative must be on the  merger\r\n\r\nstand of the Barisan Sosialis, that is, full genuine\r\n\r\nmerger,  but the snag is this, the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nstand  of  full  and complete merger  with  complete\r\n\r\nequality  in  common  citizenship  and  proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation would have the support of the people,\r\n\r\nand,   under   those  circumstances,  the   P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nproposals would still be rejected. The only way  out\r\n\r\nfor  the  P.A.P. is to distort the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nstand  into something that will mean the  losing  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship for half the citizens of Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nthey   pick   on  these  two  words,  \"Penang\"   and\r\n\r\n\"Malacca\",  and have been using them all  along,  to\r\n\r\ndistort our stand. Then, according to P.A.P. way  of\r\n\r\nthinking,  it would not be acceptable to the  people\r\n\r\nand then only would it be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsafe for the P.A.P. to pose it as an alternative  to\r\n\r\nthe  people.  So now the P.A.P. claim  justification\r\n\r\nfor  putting two questions to the electorate in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum. And so they now talk of \"mode and manner\r\n\r\nof merger\". By this the P.A.P. hope that there would\r\n\r\nbe   less  objection  to  their  non-democracy   and\r\n\r\nunfairness in the operation of the referendum.  Thus\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. hope to find an excuse for not posing  to\r\n\r\nthe  people one simple question that can be  answered\r\n\r\nwith a simple \"yes\" or \"no\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is one of malicious intent and\r\n\r\nhas more sting and venom in it, The P.A.P. object is\r\n\r\nto   identify   the   Barisan  Sosialis   with   the\r\n\r\nunacceptable fictitious Penang type merger.  As  you\r\n\r\nknow,  Sir,  from  the P.A.P. standpoint,  the  only\r\n\r\nopposition  to  them  is the Barisan  Sosialis.  All\r\n\r\ntheir policies and actions have been directed at the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis. You will remember, Sir, they  had\r\n\r\nto  admit  that certain provisions in the Referendum\r\n\r\nBill were directed at the Barisan Sosialis. We asked\r\n\r\nfor  meetings, we asked for rallies,  we  asked  for\r\n\r\nconventions,  anything  that  the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nasked  for, it was always a categorical \"no\". It  is\r\n\r\nbecause  they fear us that they have from the  first\r\n\r\nday  tried to isolate the Barisan Sosialis  by  this\r\n\r\nsmear  of  Communism  and pro-Communism.  Sir,  they\r\n\r\nthink that a lie told often enough would be mistaken\r\n\r\nfor  the truth and, therefore, the P.A.P. propaganda\r\n\r\nmachine has spared no efforts in trying to drum this\r\n\r\npoint  into the minds of the people. Day in and  day\r\n\r\nout  Radio  P.A.P. and Rediffusion have  been  going\r\n\r\nfull  blast that the Penang type merger is what  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis ask for. All their statements  and\r\n\r\nspeeches,  inside  and outside  the  Assembly,  keep\r\n\r\nblurting  out  these falsehoods, this fiction,  this\r\n\r\nfabrication of the P.A.P.

It  serves   the   P.A.P. by\r\n\r\ndisseminating   the  falsehood  that   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  want  merger  that  will  cause  half  the\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens to lose their citizenship.

You see, Sir, that is the intention  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.'s dishonest and malicious distortion  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition's stand, and especially the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis'  stand  on  the merger  issue.

They have expended extraordinary, tremendous\r\n\r\nenergy   in   the  past  year  for  distortion   and\r\n\r\nfalsification  to mislead our people, utilising  all\r\n\r\nthe  paraphernalia of the State and some very  shady\r\n\r\ntactics with reference to the Press. The tragedy  is\r\n\r\ntwofold, Mr Speaker, and I will deal with  both  of\r\n\r\nthem, both major.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, that the people of Singapore have been made\r\n\r\nconscious that even under a democracy there  can  be\r\n\r\ncontempt  for them, for the Government they elected.\r\n\r\nAnd  in  this context I ask you to permit  me,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause it is pertinent, to quote from a document on\r\n\r\nthe Pakistan Constitution published by the Bureau of\r\n\r\nNational  Reconstruction of Pakistan and  issued  by\r\n\r\nthe Government of Pakistan. I read from page eleven:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Finally the system [they are talking of the\r\n\r\nparliamentary  system] presupposes that  holders  of\r\n\r\npower  submit  themselves to a code of honour.  This\r\n\r\nunwritten code is embodied in precedents and  usages\r\n\r\nusually  called the Conventions of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nConventions are not laws and can be disregarded when\r\n\r\nthey are no longer in conformity with changed needs.\r\n\r\nAlthough  not  legally enforceable, their  force  is\r\n\r\nnevertheless  almost as binding as laws  enacted  by\r\n\r\nParliament. They give substance to the principle  of\r\n\r\nsovereignty of the people. Politicians are bound  to\r\n\r\nobserve them even if it brings them loss of office.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the fact that the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas  again  raised the question about  alternatives,\r\n\r\nmay  I quote from page 27 of the same document about\r\n\r\nthe Pakistan Constitution? A very short paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In case the President does not agree with the\r\n\r\nlegislature  he  has  been  empowered  to   hold   a\r\n\r\nreferendum on the question by referring  it  to  the\r\n\r\nbasic democracies who form the Electoral College  of\r\n\r\nPakistan.  In  such an eventuality the  point  under\r\n\r\ndispute would have to be reduced to a form in  which\r\n\r\nit can be  answered by a simple yes or no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I table this document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An even more tragic aspect - one can hardly think of\r\n\r\nsomething  more  tragic than  the  strangulation  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy we are seeing enacted under our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery  own  eyes - is the fact that if this  Government\r\n\r\nhad  expended one-quarter of this energy in  seeking\r\n\r\nto improve the citizenship provisions, in seeking to\r\n\r\nimpress  the  Federation  Government  that   it   is\r\n\r\nessential for the stability of Malaysia as  a  whole\r\n\r\nthat the White Paper proposals should be improved in\r\n\r\nthat  regard.  I  am  convinced,  Sir,  that  today,\r\n\r\ninstead  of viewing this Government with the  horror\r\n\r\nwhich our people are wont to, we may well have  been\r\n\r\njoining  them in a common and honest effort to  bring\r\n\r\nabout  that  integration which we all seek  for  our\r\n\r\nwelfare as well as for the welfare of the Federation\r\n\r\nand  the  Borneo  territories. I  say  to  you,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  whether it is today, whether  it  is\r\n\r\nthis year or whether it is in two years' time, those\r\n\r\ncitizenship proposals must be and will be  improved,\r\n\r\nand  radically improved, if we are to have a  united\r\n\r\nand   happy   nation.  The  Federation   has   shown\r\n\r\nconsiderable capacity for maturity in the  past  few\r\n\r\nyears,  considerable capacity for understanding  the\r\n\r\npolitical realities, and I say I cannot believe that\r\n\r\nif they were to be faced squarely with the issue - you\r\n\r\ncannot  have Singapore and you cannot have a  stable\r\n\r\nMalaysia  unless  you have a common citizenship - they\r\n\r\nwould  recognise  it and they would  grant  us  that\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  That  is  the major  tragedy  of  this\r\n\r\nhorrible  circus mounted with ability - Machiavellian\r\n\r\nability - and  with unbounded energy by this  terrible\r\n\r\ngroup - the tragedy that they could have utilised that\r\n\r\nforce and that ability to better ends, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead today we embark on this rear-guard action\r\n\r\nfor  further  distortions and further employment  of\r\n\r\nthe   technique   of  using  this  Assembly   as   a\r\n\r\nsmokescreen  to  cover  up  P.A.P. perfidy  and  to\r\n\r\nmislead  the people. You might have wondered  why  I\r\n\r\nrose  on  a  point of clarification when  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  misquoted me - I shall prove to  you  in  a\r\n\r\nmoment  how he has misquoted me. The point is  this,\r\n\r\nSir. His speech gets, and I am not complaining,  and\r\n\r\nit  should get, not only P.A.P. Radio publicity  but\r\n\r\npublicity  from  all the Press. Our corrections  are\r\n\r\nblacked out, but complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say in the context of this rearguard action for\r\n\r\ndecency  and  democracy, in  which  we  know  we - are\r\n\r\nfighting a losing battle - a battle that was  lost  at 10.25  p.m. last Friday - I ask you to recognise  the\r\n\r\nlustful  jubilant  note  of the  Prime  Minister  as\r\n\r\nreported by the Press, when the next morning in  the\r\n\r\nFederation he said, \"The tragedy of Singapore is the\r\n\r\none  man  one  vote  system.\"  So  the  tragedy   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  the one man one vote system - a  system\r\n\r\nwhich,  when  as an Opposition leader, he  supported\r\n\r\nwith all his heart; a system that he stood up for in\r\n\r\nthe  hustings; a system for which I thought  he,  in\r\n\r\ncommon  with  us, sought to gain the hearts  of  our\r\n\r\npeople;  a system better than which I know  of  none\r\n\r\nevolved   by   the  human  mind  for   the   healthy\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of human society. But now that  he  has\r\n\r\nreached the paranoiac height of power, he says - and I\r\n\r\nwonder whether this does not stick in the gullet  of\r\n\r\nthe  many honest Back-benches, Sir, who stood on the\r\n\r\nhustings  with  him  and  sought  to  plead  for  an\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the democratic process, how do they\r\n\r\nview that statement made on Saturday - \"The tragedy of\r\n\r\nSingapore is the one man one vote system.\"  He  does\r\n\r\nnot believe in the democratic system now that he  is\r\n\r\nin power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion the Prime Minister has moved this\r\n\r\nafternoon,  Sir,  allegedly  seeks  to   place   two\r\n\r\nalternatives  before the people.  One  is  perfectly\r\n\r\nhonest and acceptable to very many people. With  all\r\n\r\nrespect to the Barisan Sosialis, with whose fight  I\r\n\r\nfind  myself in complete agreement in major  aspects\r\n\r\nwith  reference both to the referendum  and  to  the\r\n\r\nmerger issue in seeking for citizenship, I say I  do\r\n\r\nnot agree with them when they say that there are not\r\n\r\nmany  honest  people  who believe  the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposals and genuinely believe that the White Paper\r\n\r\nproposals are good. Such people do exist, and  exist\r\n\r\nin  large numbers. It may well be ... I am not sure,\r\n\r\nSir, I am frankly, as I, have said before, in doubt.\r\n\r\nI  would not take a bet either way - not that I  am  a\r\n\r\nbetting  man. But, Sir, it is an honest proposal  in\r\n\r\nthat  it has been spelt out - this proposal of  closer\r\n\r\nrelations with the Federation, and I am happy to see\r\n\r\nthat the word \"merger\" is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  there used. It has been spelt out in the  White\r\n\r\nPaper in its main headings, and though I would  have\r\n\r\npreferred  to see the draft Constitution being  made\r\n\r\nthe  basis  for the referendum as being  the  proper\r\n\r\nconstitutional approach, I would not use that  minor\r\n\r\ncriticism  to  quibble  at  this  juncture.  I   say\r\n\r\nproposal  (a) is right to be put to the  people.  It\r\n\r\nhas been discussed. It has been spelt out. There  is\r\n\r\na document clarifying what it means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I do quarrel with is that in the context\r\n\r\nof  refusing  our people the right to say  `yes'  or\r\n\r\n`no'  and  compelling them, as the  P.A.P. seek  to\r\n\r\ncompel them, to make a choice of one of two or three\r\n\r\nalternatives, they introduce as a second alternative\r\n\r\nsomething about which the meaning is in controversy,\r\n\r\nsomething  which  has not been  spelt  out.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nshould  like  to  leave  the  issue  of  the   third\r\n\r\nalternative until the Member for Cairnhill has dealt\r\n\r\nwith  it,  because I do not know whether he  has  in\r\n\r\nmind   that   the  terms  offered  to  the   Bornean\r\n\r\nterritories will be published before the referendum,\r\n\r\nin  which case it would be quite right and proper to\r\n\r\nput  that as an alternative, or whether on the basis\r\n\r\nof  what  the  Malays called `letak  buta',  we  are\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  buy  a  pig in a poke  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nunpublished terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has told us that the\r\n\r\nmeaning  of proposal (b) can be clarified by  taking\r\n\r\njurist  views. But what are the jurists' views?  Has\r\n\r\nhe  taken any jurist views? You remember, Sir, I put\r\n\r\nthe  question a few days ago and I have  been  told,\r\n\r\n\"Oh,  yes, we consulted our State Advocate-General.\"\r\n\r\nRight, but not even his views have been published as\r\n\r\nto  what  proposal (b) means when spelt out legally.\r\n\r\nWe  know  what it is in lay language, Sir, but  when\r\n\r\nyou put it in this form for the people, I think they\r\n\r\nare entitled to know what it is supposed to mean.  I\r\n\r\nask  you to notice, Sir, although it is alleged that\r\n\r\nthe Opposition has used this phraseology, that not a\r\n\r\nsingle Member of the Opposition has at any time used\r\n\r\nthe   phrase   which   is   sought   to   make   the\r\n\r\nframework - this   is  it - \"in  accordance   with   the\r\n\r\nConstitutional  Documents  of  the   Federation   of\r\n\r\nMalaya\". Not one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember  of the Opposition has ever used that  phrase\r\n\r\nas  being  the  framework of equality of  status  of\r\n\r\nSingapore with the other territories which they  now\r\n\r\nseek  to slip in with sneering remarks about how  we\r\n\r\nwill dodge what we have asked for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall come slowly, if I may, and yet I will not\r\n\r\ntake  too long, to what we stood for. Because I  ask\r\n\r\nyou  to notice this. This new element he introduces:\r\n\r\n\"in accordance with the Constitutional Documents  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation\" is an extremely vague element.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, what are the Constitutional Documents?  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, are you aware, as you must  be,  have\r\n\r\nyou  forgotten? - may I refresh your memory  that  in\r\n\r\n1962,  in this year, Sir, there was an amendment  of\r\n\r\nthe    Federation   Constitution   which    affected\r\n\r\ncitizenship  rights  to which  many  of  the  people\r\n\r\nseemed   to   take  strong  exception?   Is   it   a\r\n\r\nConstitutional   Document   or   is   it    not    a\r\n\r\nConstitutional   Document - an   amendment   of    the\r\n\r\nFederation Constitution? Sir, the document is  known\r\n\r\nas  \"The  Constitution (Amendment) Act, 1962\".  That\r\n\r\nConstitutional Act radically changes the citizenship\r\n\r\nterms  under which the 11 States federated  together\r\n\r\nwhen  they first formed the Federation in 1957.  So,\r\n\r\nis  Singapore  to  come in in  accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nConstitutional Documents which are of  a  radically,\r\n\r\nallegedly  inferior  character  to  the  citizenship\r\n\r\narrangements in 1957? That is what seemingly, on the\r\n\r\nface  of  it, that proposal seeks. Are we, who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  asking for equality with other States, to take\r\n\r\ninto   account  what  subsequently  transpired  with\r\n\r\nreference  to this Constitution (Amendment)  Act  of\r\n\r\n1962?   For   you  will  remember,  we   have   been\r\n\r\nconsistently seeking equality since 1957.  What  are\r\n\r\nthe answers? What is the meaning of proposal (b) ? Is\r\n\r\nthis  the  way for the Government of the  people  to\r\n\r\ntreat  our  people who elected them? To treat  their\r\n\r\nown   people   with   falsehoods,  with   misleading\r\n\r\nstatements,  with false trails and with  perversion?\r\n\r\nHow  can  they  put proposal (b) to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  without first clarifying what  it  means?\r\n\r\nCould  we  not get a jurist opinion as to the  exact\r\n\r\nlegal significance of those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nterms?

It is on  this\r\n\r\nbasis  I ask you to consider the second alternative.\r\n\r\nFor  I say to you, that in the context of last  year\r\n\r\nit  was  different, but in the context of today,  to\r\n\r\nput  that proposal without clarification as  to  its\r\n\r\nexact legal meaning is a fraud upon the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

We have not changed our  stand  and  it\r\n\r\nremains  our stand. And, Sir, it has been quoted  to\r\n\r\nyou  - I am delighted - by my opponents. I take  pride\r\n\r\nin  the fact that they think it is important, as  we\r\n\r\nthink  it is important, because it is our very first\r\n\r\nplank.

So,\r\n\r\nSir,  what  did  we mean by that? Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nvery  unfortunately,  that phrase  of  ours,  \"equal\r\n\r\nbasis with other States,\" - you will notice first that\r\n\r\ndid  not mention, for example, that we wanted a free\r\n\r\nport  status.  Of  the 11 States in the  Federation,\r\n\r\nthere is only one that has a free port status, but I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think  anybody, short  of  the  insane  and\r\n\r\nMembers of the P.A.P., would for a moment doubt that\r\n\r\nwe  meant  \"on  an  equal basis\" with  a  free  port\r\n\r\nstatus,  because that is accepted by the  Federation\r\n\r\nas  good for the Federation, and good for us. I mean\r\n\r\nit  was  an  implied thing that everybody recognised\r\n\r\nthat  the  Federation would agree  to  a  free  port\r\n\r\nstatus. What did we mean by \"integration with Malaya\r\n\r\non   an   equal  basis  with  other  States\"?  Here,\r\n\r\ncuriously  of all people, you know, who, Sir,  comes\r\n\r\nto my assistance? The Member for Cairnhill!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me quote him explaining me. It is very\r\n\r\ninteresting, because, after all, he is my  political\r\n\r\nopponent and he has no interest to assist; but if he\r\n\r\nsays  something, and he is in fact correct, it comes\r\n\r\nbetter from him than it comes from me. I ask you  to\r\n\r\nlook  at the Hansard of the 22nd of November,  1961,\r\n\r\nSir,  at column 438. There you will find the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We all know what we mean by the word \"merger\".\r\n\r\nMerger means the integration of Singapore as a  part\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation and the rights  enjoyed  by  the\r\n\r\ncitizens of the Federation will be conferred on  the\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore when merger takes place.  That\r\n\r\nis what we all mean by merger, and what we all know.\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately, because of the political moves on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of  ... the Prime Minister  and  his  ex-comrades,  merger has been twisted to mean something\r\n\r\nelse.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there you have a very honest explanation of what\r\n\r\neverybody  understood by the word  \"merger\"  at  the\r\n\r\ntime;  what we all understood by \"integration on  an\r\n\r\nequal  basis\", even the P.A.P. But let us  continue,\r\n\r\nSir,  because  when you find a lode like  this,  you\r\n\r\nshould try and work it a little more. The Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill again in column 456:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There can be only one meaning for merger - complete\r\n\r\nintegration.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, Sir, at column 462:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would urge upon the P.A.P. in all their speeches\r\n\r\nafter this not to try to claim that Cmd. Paper No.\r\n\r\n33 is bringing about merger.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is the explanation of what we meant by\r\n\r\nmerger on \"an equal basis with other States\".  Using\r\n\r\nlay    language - complete    integration,    complete\r\n\r\nidentification.  And I would ask  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHome Affairs, and I would ask those who are here  to\r\n\r\nlisten, did they not mean the same, when they  spoke\r\n\r\nof \"struggling for independence through merger\"? And\r\n\r\nare  they  merely indulging - I would not go  through\r\n\r\nthose  adjectives,  Sir  - but  this,  this  specious\r\n\r\nargument  which started from November onwards,  this\r\n\r\nwhich  has sullied even our language, Sir, the equal\r\n\r\nof  which  I have never met, except during the  time\r\n\r\nwhen  I  was  imprisoned and I used  to  hear  those\r\n\r\nofficers  in  jackboots using  language  about  fair\r\n\r\ntreatment to prisoners in accordance with the Geneva\r\n\r\nConvention,  and nonsense like that with  completely\r\n\r\nstraight  faces, and they knew they  were  lying  in\r\n\r\ntheir  throats. They used words like  the  Communist\r\n\r\nuse the words \"socialism\" and \"democracy\" to explain\r\n\r\ntheir  system. So the P.A.P. are using  words  which\r\n\r\nhave  been  shorn of their meaning, which have  been\r\n\r\ndistorted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. have in these intervening months\r\n\r\nintroduced  a red herring. But before  I  deal  with\r\n\r\nthis  red  herring,  I want you  to  notice  a  very\r\n\r\ninteresting  aspect of the Federation  Constitution.\r\n\r\nMind you, I will be quite frank.  At the time I  had\r\n\r\nto  draft  my platform on an equal basis with  other\r\n\r\nStates,   I   was  not  conscious   of   the   legal\r\n\r\ntechnicalities which help me. But I  would  like  to\r\n\r\ndraw  your  attention  to this,  Sir.  That  at  the\r\n\r\nmaterial  time when I had written this, there  were,\r\n\r\nin  fact, in existence in the Federation in 9 out of\r\n\r\nthe  11  States  persons who  were  known  as  State\r\n\r\nnationals, rulers of the subjects. Those  Rulers  of\r\n\r\nthe subjects were --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Subjects of the Rulers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged to the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill. Subjects of the Rulers, Sir. There must\r\n\r\nindeed be a great deal of tension in this House if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na slip like that can cause such hilarity. But let us\r\n\r\ngo  back.  At that stage, Sir - this is important  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  - there were subjects of  the  Rulers  who\r\n\r\nwere   State  nationals,  that  is  to  say,  Johore\r\n\r\nnationals,    Negri   Sembilan   Nationals,    Kedah\r\n\r\nnationals.   Sir,   under   Article   28   of    the\r\n\r\nConstitution,  those State nationals became  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens  automatically. The Prime  Minister,  in  a\r\n\r\nspeech  which would no doubt have received  all  the\r\n\r\nadulation  which the Press now so subserviently  has\r\n\r\nbeen  giving it, has said, \"if you can  give  me  an\r\n\r\nanalogy to give automatic citizenship to the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, I shall fight for it.\" Yes, you  will\r\n\r\nfight  for  it.  This is the analogy. Singapore  has\r\n\r\nState  nationals. The citizens of Singapore  are  in\r\n\r\nthe  same  position as the subjects of the Ruler  of\r\n\r\nJohore.   Should  they  not  then  have  the   same,\r\n\r\nanalogous treatment? That is, analogous treatment to\r\n\r\nthat  accorded  to the subjects of the  Rulers.  Can\r\n\r\nthey be accorded automatic citizenship?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to read you one paragraph which might interest you. The Report of the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya Constitution Commission, known\r\n\r\nas the Reid Commission, made in 1957, and I read\r\n\r\nfrom paragraph 37. Sir, they said that if we can\r\n\r\nshow them that Singapore citizens should\r\n\r\nautomatically be citizens of the Federation, this is\r\n\r\nparagraph 37:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We recommend that all who have rights of\r\n\r\ncitizenship before Merdeka Day should continue to\r\n\r\nhave such rights. Those who have already established\r\n\r\ntheir rights of citizenship should continue to be\r\n\r\ncitizens after Merdeka Day and they would not be\r\n\r\nrequired to make any further claim. Those who are\r\n\r\nnow citizens by operation of law but who have not\r\n\r\nyet established their rights ---',\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>but  that  is no longer applicable. And they  refer,\r\n\r\nSir,  to Article 14 and Article 15, sub-clause  (1) .\r\n\r\nSo   their  recommendation  was  that  all  who  had\r\n\r\ncitizenship  rights at that time in connection  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of Malaya should continue  to  have\r\n\r\nthose rights. I say to you, Mr Speaker, Sir, in the\r\n\r\ncontext  of  the second proposal, to  speak  of  our\r\n\r\ngoing  in  in  accordance  with  the  constitutional\r\n\r\nprovisions  is fraudulent, because at  the  time  in\r\n\r\n1957  when  the  Constitution  came  into  force  in\r\n\r\nAugust, there were no Singapore citizens. There  was\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovision   in   the  Federation  Constitution   for\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens. And consequently, Sir, if we  go\r\n\r\nin   technically  and  legalistically,  without  any\r\n\r\nspecial   provision   under  Article   22   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution, every single one of us would not be  a\r\n\r\nFederal citizen. And you know what we would be, Sir?\r\n\r\nI   know   that  this  anomaly  should  cause   some\r\n\r\nrisibility. We would not be Federal citizens, but we\r\n\r\nwould  be  British  subjects. We  would  be  British\r\n\r\nsubjects!  Singapore citizens! Federation  nationals\r\n\r\nand  British subjects! That is our Merdeka! Not  one\r\n\r\nof  us  would  be entitled to automatic citizenship.\r\n\r\nThose  of  us  who want to have Federal  citizenship\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  apply. Is that  the  spirit  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitutional Documents of the Federation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 22, which seems to arouse such hilarity on\r\n\r\nthe    Government    benches,    was    specifically\r\n\r\nincorporated  in the Constitution of the  Federation\r\n\r\nin   order   to  enable  the  Federation  to   grant\r\n\r\ncitizenship on our joining the Federation,  and,  it\r\n\r\nwas at that time thought, Brunei too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is it fair to suggest that proposal (b), as it\r\n\r\nstands,  is  an  honest or an  understandable  or  a\r\n\r\nreasonable alternative to put to the people, that on\r\n\r\nMerger   Day  not  one  of  us  will  have   Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  not one of us can become a  Federation\r\n\r\ncitizen, not one of us can vote. Not merely 341,000.\r\n\r\nThose  300,000 odd, Sir, would merely  be  precluded\r\n\r\nfrom  even making an application. Because they  have\r\n\r\nnot  got the qualifications. But there are those  of\r\n\r\nus  who can apply and in the months to come we might\r\n\r\nbe granted Federal citizenship. But the point is, is\r\n\r\nthat the spirit in which the other 11 States entered\r\n\r\ninto   the   Federation,  or  formed   - they   never\r\n\r\nentered - the  Federation? You heard me read  out  the\r\n\r\nReid Commission's Report and how its recommendations\r\n\r\nwere  accepted in Article 14. You know, Sir, Article\r\n\r\n28  makes subjects of the Ruler Federation citizens.\r\n\r\nWell,   Sir,  subjects  of  the  Ruler   are   State\r\n\r\nnationals.   Why  cannot  the  State  nationals   of\r\n\r\nSingapore automatically have Federation citizenship?\r\n\r\nIf   we   are   to  talk  of  the  spirit   of   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndocuments, that is the spirit, Mr Speaker.  To  put\r\n\r\nthe technicalities is to put the fraud because since\r\n\r\n1957 when these documents were published, there  has\r\n\r\nbeen a new entity, Sir, a new status - the status  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   citizenship  created  by  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nCitizenship Ordinance of that year under  which  all\r\n\r\n642,000  citizens enjoy our citizenship rights.  How\r\n\r\nare these to be provided for? Sir, even the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Law - I  have at no time made any  secret  of  my\r\n\r\nassessment  of  his  intellectual  understanding - had\r\n\r\nthis  to  say.  I refer you to Hansard  of  22nd  of\r\n\r\nNovember,  1961, at column 481, Sir.  He  recognised\r\n\r\nthat you have to use Article 22. You cannot have any\r\n\r\nkind  of a merger without it. These are his phrases,\r\n\r\nSir - I will refer you to that paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is obvious, Sir, that under the provisions of\r\n\r\nArticles  4  and 22 of the Federation  Constitution,\r\n\r\nspecial  arrangements  would  have  to  be  made  on\r\n\r\ncitizenship at the time of merger.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Right  at the top, Sir, he said Article 4;  then  he\r\n\r\nchanged it to Article 2; I am just putting it in the\r\n\r\nproper context. Now, Sir, he himself recognises that\r\n\r\n\"special  arrangements would  have  to  be  made  on\r\n\r\ncitizenship  ...\" But here you are putting  proposal\r\n\r\n(b)  - nothing about citizenship. Yes, not only that,\r\n\r\nbut  I  would remind you, Sir, the arch distortioner\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. - the  Minister  for  Culture - said  at\r\n\r\ncolumn  499  of 22nd of November. 1961, who  started\r\n\r\nthis  campaign,  this campaign of smokescreen  about\r\n\r\nwhat   the   Barisan  Sosialis  wanted,   what   the\r\n\r\nCommunists want and now, it seems according  to  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister, what everybody wants.  Let  us  see\r\n\r\nwhat the Minister for Culture said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Originally the Barisan Sosialis leaders demanded\r\n\r\nmerger on the basis of Penang and Malacca - I repeat,\r\n\r\nSir,  on  the  basis  of  Penang  and  Malacca.   We\r\n\r\ncorrectly  pointed  out that the  Barisan  Sosialis'\r\n\r\nproposal  would have meant that only  about  284,000\r\n\r\nout   of   the  624,000  Singapore  citizens   would\r\n\r\nautomatically qualify for Federal citizenship  under\r\n\r\nthe present citizenship laws of the Federation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is  not  true, Sir; nobody would automatically\r\n\r\nqualify;   there   is  no  automatic   transfer   of\r\n\r\ncitizenship; no provision. He goes on to say,  \"Sir,\r\n\r\nif the Barisan Sosialis' leaders are really sincere,\r\n\r\n...\" - we will come to this `really\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsincere';  they can fight it out between themselves.\r\n\r\nSir,  therefore, you recognise that  unless  special\r\n\r\nprovisions,  as the Minister for Law indicated,  are\r\n\r\nmade  under  Article 22 of the Constitution  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation, there can be no question of any  of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  automatically becoming  Federal  citizens,\r\n\r\nbecause  there  is no provision in the  Constitution\r\n\r\nfor  automatic grant of citizenship on the accession\r\n\r\nof  any  new territory. There was in respect of  the\r\n\r\ntime when all the eleven territories coagulated  but\r\n\r\nthere  is no provision for the accession of any  new\r\n\r\nterritory   having   automatic  citizenship   except\r\n\r\ninsofar as Parliament grants it under Article 22. So\r\n\r\nthis  is the proposal which they seek to put to  the\r\n\r\npeople. Is this an honest proposal, because  let  me\r\n\r\nremind  you,  Mr Speaker, that they  say  they  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  put - and how often have they repeated  it\r\n\r\n- two   honest   alternatives - honest  as   a   P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncorkscrew;  \"honest\". I will remind you of  some  of\r\n\r\ntheir phrases. The Minister for Law said on 2nd July\r\n\r\nat  page 63 of the transcript [Vol. 18, No. 4,  col.\r\n\r\n517]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There is nothing undemocratic in giving the voter\r\n\r\nthe  right  to  choose between two  or  more  honest\r\n\r\nproposals in a referendum...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Is  this  an honest proposal? And, Sir,  why  do  I\r\n\r\nsupport  this  Barisan Sosialis' amendment?  Let  me\r\n\r\nremind  you; they do put their feet in it sometimes,\r\n\r\nSir,  because sometimes they forget that  they,  how\r\n\r\nshall I say it, have got to maintain a certain  line\r\n\r\nof distortion, and you have the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nat  column 131 in Select Committee of the 8th of May\r\n\r\n[Official Report No. 3]. Sir, saying this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There is an advantage, in principle, in\r\n\r\nrestricting a referendum to posing one question.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Yes, I agree with him. Why take away this advantage?\r\n\r\nI  agree  completely.  \"There is  an  advantage,  in\r\n\r\nprinciple, in restricting a referendum to posing one\r\n\r\nquestion.\" While recognising that advantage, why  do\r\n\r\nthey want to pose a question whose meaning they have\r\n\r\nsullied, whose meaning they have made controversial,\r\n\r\nwhose meaning they have left in doubt and in respect\r\n\r\nof   which  they  give  no  definition?  Now,   Sir,\r\n\r\nsupposing we do, how do we know how it is  going  to\r\n\r\nbe implemented - what meaning is going \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto be given to proposal (b)? At least, if we had\r\n\r\nan agreed explanation of its meaning between the two\r\n\r\nGovernments  - the  Federation  Government  and   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government - we could  know  what  we  are\r\n\r\nabout,  but we have no such agreement, Sir. We  have\r\n\r\nno  such  agreement to its meaning, and we  have  to\r\n\r\nleave  ourselves to the tender mercies of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ndictionary.  Sir,  they say they  want  to  put  the\r\n\r\nOpposition's stand: \"What is wrong with our  putting\r\n\r\nthe Opposition's stand?\" Their tender regard for the\r\n\r\nOpposition  is very, very touching. We  all  believe\r\n\r\nit,   Sir - these  crocodile  tears  of   regard   and\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see how they chop and change and chop again.\r\n\r\nSir,  on  22nd  November, 1961, at  column  488  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Law - and I ask you to note  his  words - said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, we believe that complete merger will be\r\n\r\ntotally  unacceptable to the Federation  Parliament.\r\n\r\nand they have said so.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Well,  but  on 12th June over Radio P.A.P. - broadcast\r\n\r\non the l4th - this is what the Prime Minister said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the people reject the White Paper proposals,\r\n\r\nthey  just  vote for complete merger.  That  is  the\r\n\r\nrejection of the White Paper proposals and  we  will\r\n\r\nget them complete merger.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I wonder how the Prime Minister and the Minister for\r\n\r\nLaw  square  their views, or do they not ever  meet?\r\n\r\nFirst,  the Minister for Law said: \"We believe  that\r\n\r\ncomplete merger will be totally unacceptable.\";  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  over Radio P.A.P. on  the  14th  of\r\n\r\nJune, \"We will get them complete merger.\" I have the\r\n\r\ndocuments here, Sir, It is on page 8. Now, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Home Affairs on the 3rd of July  [Vol.\r\n\r\n18,  No.  5,  cols.  581-2] - this  was  a  few  days\r\n\r\nago - said, at page 28:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`However, having made the first error of declaring\r\n\r\nfor full and complete merger like Penang or Malacca,\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis could not publicly  repudiate\r\n\r\ntheir stand; and even if they want to, they dare not\r\n\r\nfor  they realise that they cannot stem the tide  of\r\n\r\nhistory  and  go against the wishes of  the  people.\r\n\r\nHowever, they did not then expect the Government  to\r\n\r\ntake  their  proposition  seriously,  and  that  the\r\n\r\nFederation, in any case, would not accept it.  Here,\r\n\r\nwe  see  how  dishonest and unfaithful  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis are.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we get the Prime Minister on the 12th June\r\n\r\ntelling us he will get\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomplete merger. On the 3rd July we get his Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home  Affairs  saying that  the  suggestion  is\r\n\r\ndishonest  and unfaithful, to whom I  am  not  quite\r\n\r\nsure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are we? Has language any meaning? Are we\r\n\r\nplaying  out  a tragedy? A farce of the  P.A.P.  Has\r\n\r\nlanguage no meaning to them? Have they no shame?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No amount of grunting can help the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  Here are facts, Sir, I have not  invented\r\n\r\nthem. 22nd November, the Minister for Law: \"Complete\r\n\r\nmerger  impossible.\" 12th June, the Prime  Minister:\r\n\r\n\"We  will  get them complete merger.\" 3rd July,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home  Affairs:  \"Complete  merger  is\r\n\r\ndishonest  and unfaithful.\" Sir, I do not understand\r\n\r\nthat \"dishonest and unfaithful\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has sought to quote me. I have here the\r\n\r\nfull transcript, Sir, copied word for word, not  now\r\n\r\nanymore.  They  slipped up in  the  Sunday  Mail.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that there have been grave repercussions\r\n\r\nbecause  they put the radio broadcast in  full,  the\r\n\r\nSunday Mail of 1st July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, he said that I wanted the question put about merger on an equal basis. May I read to you a\r\n\r\nvery short paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Look at what the Opposition asked for on the 21st\r\n\r\nNovember. We amended a merger motion. We requested a\r\n\r\ngenuine  merger of Singapore with the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  with  Singapore entering the Federation  as\r\n\r\nthe   twelfth  State  and  with  all  its   citizens\r\n\r\nautomatically  becoming Federal citizens  on  Merger\r\n\r\nDay. That is the alternative the Opposition offered.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the  alternative  for  which  17  of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  - three  Parties  - voted.  That  is   the\r\n\r\nalternative  which  the  P.A.P.,  after  a  marathon\r\n\r\ndebate,  turned down with a majority of  32  to  17,\r\n\r\nwith  their friends, the S.P.A. and U.M.N.O., voting\r\n\r\nwith  them.

What is wrong with putting it? They have\r\n\r\na tender regard for the Opposition? Here is what the\r\n\r\nOpposition has said. We repeated it over the  radio;\r\n\r\nwe  pleaded  for it. What is wrong with putting  our\r\n\r\nstand  which  is: `genuine merger of Singapore  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of Malaya, with Singapore  entering\r\n\r\nthe  Federation as a twelfth State, and with all its\r\n\r\ncitizens automatically becoming Federal citizens  on\r\n\r\nMerger  Day.' 17 Opposition Members voted for  this,\r\n\r\nno  Communists, 17 of us.

Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  is a very curious definition of dishonesty.  I\r\n\r\nwant  to say this to you. If a man says, \"I want  to\r\n\r\nmarry Miss X.\" He is dishonest because he knows  she\r\n\r\ndoes  not want him! Right, he says, \"I will not mary\r\n\r\nMiss  A.  I will not marry Miss B. I will not  marry\r\n\r\nMiss D. I will not marry till I marry Miss X.\" He is\r\n\r\nprepared to wait for Miss X. What is dishonest about\r\n\r\nthat?  But  I  want  to show you, Sir,  these  short\r\n\r\nmemory  gentlemen, I think you will remember perhaps\r\n\r\na  day of long ago, the 5th of April, 1956, Sir.  At\r\n\r\ncolumn  1862, there was a motion before this  House,\r\n\r\nand the operative words of that motion, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.... the Assembly instructs its All-Party\r\n\r\nDelegation  to the forthcoming Constitutional  Talks\r\n\r\nin London to seek forthwith for Singapore the status\r\n\r\nof an independent territory within the Commonwealth,\r\n\r\nand to offer an agreement between the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nGovernment and the Singapore Government whereby  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnited   Kingdom  would  in  respect  of   Singapore\r\n\r\nexercise  control  over external  defence  and  give\r\n\r\nguidance  in foreign relations other than trade  and\r\n\r\ncommerce.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Was  it dishonest? It was? Well, I say I do not want\r\n\r\nto  misinterpret the Deputy Prime Minister, but  let\r\n\r\nme  remind him, Sir, that at column 1863 there  were 27  Ayes  and not one No; and amongst the Ayes  were\r\n\r\nhis  friend, the present Prime Minister, his  friend\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour, and his friend, is it  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  to   the   Deputy   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Deputy Prime Minister.

It is said by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. that  it is not one which would  today  find\r\n\r\nacceptance  by the Federation, and therefore  merger\r\n\r\nwould have to be postponed.

That way she gets no marriage.\r\n\r\nAnd I say to you, Mr Speaker, merger is inevitable.\r\n\r\nThat is right. I agree completely. It is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninevitable   because  with  growing   maturity   the\r\n\r\nFederation  will more and more recognise  the  vital\r\n\r\ncharacter  of Singapore as the kingpin of South-East\r\n\r\nAsia.  We  are not asking for the moon, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.  Our modesty is something to be amazed  at.

I ask the Lady from Mountbatten\r\n\r\nhow  much  of  democracy is left  today  after  that\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill? How much of it is she going to save\r\n\r\nand  for whom?

Why is it a fraud, Mr Speaker, when  in\r\n\r\ntruth  and  in  fact  every single  human  being  in\r\n\r\nSingapore understood by merger that there  would  be\r\n\r\nautomatic  citizenship and  we  would  go  in  as  a\r\n\r\nconstituent  State. This was what we all  understood\r\n\r\nand this, in the language of the P.A.P., is a fraud.\r\n\r\nThen  may I ask the P.A.P. that they put a fraud  in\r\n\r\ntheir   constitution  saying  they   \"struggle   for\r\n\r\nindependence through merger.\" Or did they understand\r\n\r\nsomething else by merger?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, when the Prime Minister said pompously,\r\n\r\n\"We  will permit the people to decide between  three\r\n\r\nalternatives,\" he is in fact only giving  them  one,\r\n\r\nfor (b) is one about whose meaning controversy rages\r\n\r\nand  there  is  no agreement between  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nFederation Government as to its meaning.

How  can  you\r\n\r\nthrow  out a proposal like that and say that  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition who wants it when the Opposition  is\r\n\r\non  the record as wanting something precise?

Press reports of the  Opposition's\r\n\r\nstand  are  being heavily excised in the newspapers.\r\n\r\nSir, the people are reaching\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  stage when I say it is necessary to give  them  a\r\n\r\nhealthy  outlet.  Here we seek a constitutional  and\r\n\r\nlegitimate approach to protest against the  proposed\r\n\r\ntransfer  by the United Kingdom in a manner contrary\r\n\r\nto  the freely expressed wishes of the people and we\r\n\r\nare  told it is scurrilous because he does not  like\r\n\r\nit.  We  are told the group that seeks to  have  the\r\n\r\nBadminton Hall to have a meeting there is Communist.\r\n\r\nEverybody is a Communist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are told that what is filthy\r\n\r\nis  right,  that  proposal (b) which  is  thoroughly\r\n\r\ndishonest,  is  honest.  We  are  told  that  it  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely clear and unambiguous. Sir, I heard  this\r\n\r\nevening  from  the Prime Minister  a  remark,  whose\r\n\r\nsignificance, I do not know, may not have been fully\r\n\r\nappreciated  by other Members. He has told  us  that\r\n\r\nthis  House  will be suspended at the  end  of  this\r\n\r\nsitting and the Session will be prorogued. Under the\r\n\r\nConstitution  he  does  not  have  to  call  another\r\n\r\nmeeting of the Assembly for 12 months. I had  hoped,\r\n\r\nSir, when I saw the Order Paper and noticed that the\r\n\r\nBills  were sent to Select Committee that, in  fact,\r\n\r\nwe  would be sitting and earning our allowance, that\r\n\r\nwe  would  be in a position to continue at least  to\r\n\r\nkeep  an  eye, as a watch-dog keeps an eye,  on  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  our  people. But now  we  are  to  be\r\n\r\nprorogued,  he  has  got  what  he  wants,  he   has\r\n\r\nbulldozed  it through. So whether it is  in  Cameron\r\n\r\nHighlands  playing golf, or whether it is  with  his\r\n\r\nRight-wing cronies drinking beer, or whether  it  is\r\n\r\nevolving  further  Machiavellian  schemes  with  his\r\n\r\nbasic contempt for our people and for the democratic\r\n\r\nprocess,  our Prime Minister will then be  free,  as\r\n\r\nfree as any dictator, to do with us as he wills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the second question is dishonest in the context of today, although it would have been a\r\n\r\nlegitimate one ten months ago. But in the context of\r\n\r\ntoday and the falsifications of the P.A.P., or shall\r\n\r\nwe say, the misunderstandings, but in the context of\r\n\r\nits ambiguity today the fact that nobody knows\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexactly   what   it   means,  it  is   unreasonable,\r\n\r\nparticularly when you use that new phrase which says\r\n\r\n\"in accordance with the Constitutional Documents  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya\". Constitutional Documents\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation  of Malaya - many  of  them,  all\r\n\r\nunspecified,  one  of  them  the  1962  Constitution\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Act which radically alters  citizenship\r\n\r\nlaws.  It is dishonest to put to the people anything\r\n\r\nthat  is  not clear and cannot be easily understood.\r\n\r\nThey  kept  saying  to us, and  the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself  said,  \"If  a  man  fully  understands  the\r\n\r\nalternatives...\" - that was the phrase he used on  4th\r\n\r\nJuly-how  is  anybody  going  to  understand   fully\r\n\r\nalternative (b), Sir? As it stands, it is not merely\r\n\r\na  question  \"analogous  to the  provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  documents\", but  with  reference  to\r\n\r\ntheir technical terms. And how does he know that  he\r\n\r\ncan  get  from the Tunku what he understands?  Would\r\n\r\nyou  not agree, Mr Speaker, Sir, that if he has any\r\n\r\nrespect  for  our people he would have first  worked\r\n\r\nout  at least a draft with the Federation Government\r\n\r\nas  to the possible meaning of that alternative  and\r\n\r\nthen put it to our people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Lady from Mountbatten, with feminine adulation of her leader, said to us that it\r\n\r\nwas her great leader, the Member for Cairnhill, who,\r\n\r\nhaving  gone  into the P.A.P. den  and  bearded  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, came forth with the promise that the\r\n\r\nquestions would be discussed in this Assembly. I  am\r\n\r\nsorry  to disappoint the Lady from Mountbatten.  But\r\n\r\nas  you know, the motion which is now item No. 10 on\r\n\r\nthe  Order  Paper was received by you a  long,  long\r\n\r\ntime before the radio forum on which the Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill appeared with the Prime Minister.  It  was\r\n\r\ncirculated  to  them and they knew that  because  of\r\n\r\nthat  motion,  the questions had to be discussed  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly.  So that is the  way  in  which  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. bearded the P.A.P. valiantly,  coming  forth\r\n\r\nwith the scalp of the Prime Minister and the promise\r\n\r\nof the questions being discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what happened after that?

I  am\r\n\r\nnot  complaining, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I am  sure\r\n\r\nthat  the Lady from Mountbatten would wish  to  have\r\n\r\nthe  facts straight, that it was not thanks  to  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. or to any sense of decency of the P.A.P. but\r\n\r\nit   was  thanks  to  constitutional  procedure  and\r\n\r\nStanding  Orders  which compel discussion  of  these\r\n\r\nquestions  as to what is to be put to the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the amendment of the Member for Queenstown because in fact it leaves to\r\n\r\nthe  people to vote on one question which  has  been\r\n\r\nspelt  out  and it leaves it to them  in  an  honest\r\n\r\nmanner - a  referendum to be held for  the  people  to\r\n\r\ndecide   whether   they   accept   or   reject   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  arrangements  set  out   in   Paper\r\n\r\nCommand  No. 33 of 1961. That is the one before  us.\r\n\r\nAll  other  proposals are intended as a smokescreen.\r\n\r\nIf  we are compelled to have several proposals,  let\r\n\r\nus  have at least the Opposition's proposal  of  the\r\n\r\n21st  November, 1961, incorporated, that is  to  say\r\n\r\ngenuine  merger,  with Singapore coming  in  as  the\r\n\r\ntwelfth  state,  and with automatic citizenship  for\r\n\r\nour citizens.

Each  of\r\n\r\nthose  nine  Malay  States had a special  Act,  Sir,\r\n\r\nproviding  for State nationals known as subjects  of\r\n\r\nthe  Rulers.

Singapore, in 1957  August,  had  no\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens, but after 1957 August,  we  have\r\n\r\nthe    1957   Citizenship   Ordinance.   Under   the\r\n\r\nCitizenship Ordinance, we had nationals of the State\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  known  as  Singapore  citizens.   By\r\n\r\nanalogy,  those nationals of the State of  Singapore\r\n\r\nare  similar in status to the subjects of the Rulers\r\n\r\nof  the  Malay States of the Federation.

I will not read it except  to\r\n\r\nremind you that the Reid Commission emphasised  that\r\n\r\nall  those  who had citizenship rights  should  have\r\n\r\nthem  in  common  on  Merger Day.

He made it as far back as April when the\r\n\r\nmotion of the Member for Anson was being debated for\r\n\r\na  referendum. The Barisan Sosialis tried  it  then.\r\n\r\nThey  tried again during the Committee stage on  the\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill. And they now try it again. Although\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Queenstown did say  that  if  this\r\n\r\nfailed he had another proposal, the fourth proposal,\r\n\r\nwhich he would like to put forth.

But now it seems that he might  not  even\r\n\r\nmove  his  amendment. He is quite prepared to  allow\r\n\r\nthis  proposal to go through after all - he  has  said\r\n\r\nthat - just because the Barisan Sosialis is putting in\r\n\r\na fourth proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that the debate on this referendum\r\n\r\nand  on  merger has got on the nerves of all Members\r\n\r\nin this House and that at times we do not behave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrationally as we want to behave, but that is not our\r\n\r\nfault.  It is all due to the wear and tear  and  the\r\n\r\nstrain that we have been subjected to by this  party\r\n\r\nwarfare  between the P.A.P. and the  ex-P.A.P.,  and\r\n\r\nthose  who do not belong to the Party are just taken\r\n\r\ninto  the  arena. Things are getting more  and  more\r\n\r\nconfused, and the longer the debate carries  on  the\r\n\r\nmore confused the debate will be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since it has been moved by the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  I  must say why I object  to  the  one-question  referendum. I hate to repeat what  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen  saying, but I must do so in order to make  our\r\n\r\nposition  clear. A one-question referendum will  not\r\n\r\nget  the  right answer - the answer from  the  people\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not they want closer relationship  with\r\n\r\nthe   Federation   of   Malaya.   The   one-question\r\n\r\nreferendum   will   just   give   the   long-awaited\r\n\r\nopportunity to the electors to write \"finish\" to the\r\n\r\nlife  of the P.A.P. They would gleefully just  cross\r\n\r\nout  Command Paper No. 33 as if to say, \"The  sooner\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. gets out of the picture, the healthier it\r\n\r\nwill  be for politics in Singapore.\" That is  why  I\r\n\r\nsay  a  one-question referendum will  not  give  the\r\n\r\nright answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to suitable alternative questions, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson felt it necessary to cross swords with the\r\n\r\nLady  from Mountbatten and try to claim credit  that\r\n\r\nit was he, because of the notice of his motion, that\r\n\r\nis  to say, item 10 on the Order Paper, who had been\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in forcing the Government  to  agree  to\r\n\r\ndebate the questions to be proposed in a referendum.\r\n\r\nSir, I, who have received no legal training,  am  a\r\n\r\nbit  chary in entering into a debate with the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson, who is a very well-known  lawyer.\r\n\r\nBut  I must make it clear to him that item 10 on the\r\n\r\nOrder  Paper  does  not, under the Standing  Orders,\r\n\r\nforce the Government to debate the questions at all.\r\n\r\nItem 10 is an attempt by the Member for Anson to try\r\n\r\nand  force the Government to agree to a one-question\r\n\r\nreferendum. And if the Government had not agreed  to\r\n\r\nhave  the  questions debated in  this  Assembly,  no\r\n\r\nquestions  would have been debated in this  Assembly\r\n\r\nother than the Government simply saying \"No\" to  the\r\n\r\nmotion; and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson,  and also his  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  would be wanting to say, \"Yes\"  to  the\r\n\r\nmotion.  He cannot, I submit, claim credit  that  it\r\n\r\nwas  he  who  forced  the  Government  to  have  the\r\n\r\nquestion  debated in this Assembly, just because  he\r\n\r\nhas  given notice of a motion - item 10 on the  Order\r\n\r\nPaper   - for  debate,  and  trying  to  corner   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   into   agreeing   to   a   one-question\r\n\r\nreferendum and fixing a time limit for polling  day.\r\n\r\nSir,  we  do  not want to claim credit for  anything\r\n\r\ndone  at all. On this very important national issue,\r\n\r\nlet  all  Parties  in  this  Assembly  forget  party\r\n\r\ncredits. Let us all work together at least  on  this\r\n\r\none  issue to get the people to go to the referendum\r\n\r\nand   vote   for   closer  relationship   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation. There should be no question of a Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis proposal, or a Workers' Party proposal,  or\r\n\r\neven a S.P.A. proposal. In fact, the proposal that I\r\n\r\nam going to move as an amendment should not be taken\r\n\r\nas  a S.P.A. proposal, and I will touch on that when\r\n\r\nthe time comes. Let us place all the propositions --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I say all the propositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> --- all the alternative questions to\r\n\r\nthe  electors.  And the alternatives must  give  due\r\n\r\nrecognition to facts. In trying to establish  closer\r\n\r\nrelationship with the Federation of Malaya, we  must\r\n\r\ntry  to put our heads together to find out how  many\r\n\r\nforms  of closer association there can be. If  there\r\n\r\nare  five forms, let us put up five forms. If  there\r\n\r\nare three or two, let us put up three or two. Let us\r\n\r\nput  our  heads  together  and  bring  back  to  the\r\n\r\nelectors  for  a  referendum  questions  that   have\r\n\r\nrelationship to facts. Now proposal No. 1 of Command\r\n\r\nPaper  No. 33 is, in fact, not merger. It is a  form\r\n\r\nof  closer  association. It  is  a  form  which  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  as  a  Government,  has  secured  from  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government. And it is a form  of  closer\r\n\r\nrelationship  which the S.P.A./Alliance  has  fought\r\n\r\nfor,  because the S.P.A./Alliance must, in  all  its\r\n\r\nconsideration on matters of public importance,  have\r\n\r\ntheir facts straight. The P.A.P., as a Government, can  only\r\n\r\nget that and no more. But it does not mean\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  Command  Paper  33  is  not  open  to  further\r\n\r\nimprovements.  Of  course, once we have  established\r\n\r\ncloser relationship, future governments can carry on\r\n\r\nfrom  where  the  P.A.P. has left  off.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nmerger. It is a son of half merger. Therefore, after\r\n\r\nhaving  got that form of merger - a half merger,  let\r\n\r\nus say - must we now try to say that there must be 75\r\n\r\nper cent or 80 per cent or 90 per cent merger? There\r\n\r\ncould  be  no  other  alternative  than  a  complete\r\n\r\nmerger. If it is 50 per cent, we could not just say,\r\n\r\n\"I  think  we  should  try and have  70  per  cent,\"\r\n\r\nbecause  the  electorate will not know what  70  per\r\n\r\ncent  means.  50 per cent is embodied in  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper.  Let  us  have  the  50  per  cent,  if   the\r\n\r\nelectorate think that that is a good thing under the\r\n\r\npresent circumstances. Or if we do not want  50  per\r\n\r\ncent, well let us have a hundred per cent, that  is,\r\n\r\ncomplete  and unconditional merger. The  wording  of\r\n\r\nthe Government is this: a complete and unconditional\r\n\r\nmerger  as a state on an equal basis with the  other\r\n\r\neleven  states in accordance with the constitutional\r\n\r\ndocuments  of the Federation of Malaya.  And  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause of the way it is worded that the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  took  strong exception to  it  and  tried  to\r\n\r\naccuse  the P.A.P. of wanting to perpetrate a fraud,\r\n\r\nand  the P.A.P. says that the Barisan is wanting  to\r\n\r\nperpetrate a fraud. Let us forget all frauds. Let us\r\n\r\nnot  call each other names. It would make the public\r\n\r\nmore  confused. If one is trying to be cleverer than\r\n\r\nthe  other in this important issue, if one is trying\r\n\r\nto  outdo the other in language, in distortion,  and\r\n\r\nin  trying to play on the emotions of the masses, we\r\n\r\nmay reach a very unhealthy state of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The Member for Anson tries to see\r\n\r\nin  this  proposal  (b)  an  attempt  to  cheat  the\r\n\r\nelectorate.  I think what is more important  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry  is to see that the wording of the questions\r\n\r\nshould be free from possible misinterpretation,  and\r\n\r\nit   would   be   left  to  the  political   Parties\r\n\r\nrepresented  in this Assembly to hold  a  referendum\r\n\r\nmeeting and speak about their particular stand.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and the S.P.A./Alliance will do their best to\r\n\r\nexplain to the people why Command Paper 33 is in the\r\n\r\nbest  interest  of the people of Singapore.  If  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis or the Workers' Party want complete\r\n\r\nand  unconditional  merger as a State  on  an  equal\r\n\r\nbasis  with the other eleven States, they can go  to\r\n\r\nthe  people and explain their stand; what they mean,\r\n\r\nthat there should be automatic citizenship: and what\r\n\r\nis  meant by proposal (b); and what they support  is\r\n\r\nthat  they want Singapore to join the Federation  as\r\n\r\none  of  the states of the Federation with  all  its\r\n\r\nprivileges  as  well  as its responsibilities.  They\r\n\r\nwill  have  to say what they mean by their automatic\r\n\r\ncitizenship. But they will also have to  explain  to\r\n\r\nthe  people that once we get complete merger,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be no autonomy on any subject whatsoever. They\r\n\r\nwill  have to go in - take all the benefits that  are\r\n\r\nthere  and  also  accept all the disadvantages  that\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger  could mean. If they  present  that\r\n\r\npicture as they see it to the electorate, and if the\r\n\r\nelectorate  vote for it in the image of the  picture\r\n\r\nthat  they present, then the Government of  the  day\r\n\r\nwill  have to take due note of the decision  of  the\r\n\r\nelectorate in the light of the picture presented  to\r\n\r\nthem  by  the  Parties that are in favour.  But  all\r\n\r\nthese  arguments back and forth and this calling  of\r\n\r\nnames  make people think that we have not even grown\r\n\r\nup. What is all this argument about? What is the use\r\n\r\nof  saying, \"I want complete merger. I want this.  I\r\n\r\nwant that.\"? If the Federation says \"no\" to you,  it\r\n\r\nis just the end of it.

They\r\n\r\nshould   not   try  to  say  something  which   they\r\n\r\nthemselves admit they are not sure of, because  they\r\n\r\nhave  not consulted the jurists and it is up to  the\r\n\r\njurists  to  say.

Let him try and sell that\r\n\r\nstand to the electorate in the same way as we in the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. Alliance will have to try and explain to  the\r\n\r\npeople that Cmd. Paper 33 is the best possible under\r\n\r\na  P.A.P. form of government. Of course,  it  could\r\n\r\nhave   been  better  had  it  not  been   a   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But because we are realistic,  we  know\r\n\r\nthe signs; we are prepared to support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again I see another thing. The Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas  brought in the question of the Malays'  special\r\n\r\nprivileges.  I do not see why such an  issue  should\r\n\r\nhave  been  brought in, Sir. Let  us  consider  this\r\n\r\nissue  - these special privileges - from the point  of\r\n\r\nview of the socialists. The P.A.P. say that they are\r\n\r\nsocialists;  the Barisan claim that  they  are  more\r\n\r\nsocialist  than the P.A.P. Therefore,  what  is  the\r\n\r\nsocialist doctrine? We should give to those that  do\r\n\r\nnot  have.  Those that have not must be given  their\r\n\r\ndue rights. Those that have must come to the help of\r\n\r\nthose   that   do  not  have.  A  simple   socialist\r\n\r\nprinciple. Those that have must help those  that  do\r\n\r\nnot  have,  and in Malaya today, those that  do  not\r\n\r\nhave just happen to be the Malays. So let us not say\r\n\r\nthat  we  want  to  give special privileges  to  the\r\n\r\nMalays.  Let  us  say  that we  are  giving  special\r\n\r\nprivileges  to those that do not have  in  order  to\r\n\r\nmake Malaya a better country for all to live in. Let\r\n\r\nus  not try and bring in the communal issue. If  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis and the P.A.P. claim that they  are\r\n\r\ngenuine socialists --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If the P.A.P. claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> --- that is the proper way to tackle\r\n\r\nthis  question;  not to bring in, say,  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nmust  come to the help of the Malays and the  Malays\r\n\r\nwill  greatly benefit at the expense of the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThat  is wrong. Benefits will be given to those that\r\n\r\nmust  have the benefits, and those that already have\r\n\r\nthe  benefits  must be content with what  they  have\r\n\r\nuntil  there is a more just and more equal  society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I really find little to pick fault with the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson when he criticised the  P.A.P. in\r\n\r\nsuch strong terms. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have  been doing all those things  that  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson has described. One Minister  says\r\n\r\nthat  it is impossible to have complete merger.  The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  says,  \"I will  get  it  for  you.\"\r\n\r\nAnother  Minister  says.  \"Come  on,  it  bears   no\r\n\r\nrelationship to the facts.\" It is because they  have\r\n\r\nnow got into the position in which they have to keep\r\n\r\non  moving from one place to another, and in  which,\r\n\r\nin  order  to beat distortion, they must  also  lend\r\n\r\nthemselves to practising distortion. That is why all\r\n\r\nthis confused situation has arisen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest to the P.A.P. and the ex-P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthat  is  to  say, the Barisan Sosialis - they  worked\r\n\r\ntogether  as  a  Party and were pledged  to  merger,\r\n\r\nalthough the leader of the Barisan now says that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has never made any mention of merger. I think\r\n\r\nhe  was  wrong, Sir. As soon as the P.A.P. came  to\r\n\r\npower,  they did make a few bleats about merger.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,   they  were  not  in  the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's   speech,  or  in  any  of   their   policy\r\n\r\nstatements,  but  they did make a few  bleats  about\r\n\r\nmerger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is not in the Five-Year Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And every time they make those\r\n\r\nfew  bleats  when  the  Member  for  Queenstown  was\r\n\r\nsitting  on  the other side, they got  slapped  down\r\n\r\nhard  by  the Tunku. All because - and it can  now  be\r\n\r\nsaid - the  Tunku knew that in the P.A.P. there  were\r\n\r\nCommunists who were sleeping with the P.A.P. And  it\r\n\r\nwas   because  the  P.A.P. had  awakened   to   the\r\n\r\ncontamination  that they had through  sleeping  with\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  that the Tunku had come  with  this\r\n\r\nidea of Malaysia. And the P.A.P. was quick enough to\r\n\r\ncatch  on  to  it  and  went to see  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  and reached agreement with  them.  There\r\n\r\nwas  really  - if  I  may use the phrase - an  indecent\r\n\r\nhaste. The P.A.P. should have known that they  would\r\n\r\nbe reduced to 26 Members. If they had wanted to save\r\n\r\nall  this  unnecessary distortion that is going  on,\r\n\r\nthey  could  have  had an All-Party Delegation.  No,\r\n\r\nthey did not want to have it, because they wanted to\r\n\r\nclaim credit for it. That is where the first mistake\r\n\r\nwas made. If they had not just wanted to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  quick  at clutching the straw to save them  from\r\n\r\ndrowning,  they  would have been a little  bit  more\r\n\r\nsensible  and  would have consulted  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nParties, and that would have made their job  easier.\r\n\r\nAnd  all  this  mud-slinging might  not  have  taken\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Parties that will be holding referendum\r\n\r\nmeetings  will  remember that  they  owe  the  first\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  the country.

I\r\n\r\nneed  not  go  over the reasons for  our  objection.\r\n\r\nSuffice  it  to  say that a one-question  referendum\r\n\r\nwill  not  produce the right answer and the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  are  anxious  to  have  that  one-question\r\n\r\nreferendum because it will mean the knock-out of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. - and  that is what they like to see.  But  we,\r\n\r\nwho  are  conscious  of  our responsibility  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore, are anxious to see  that  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  on  merger  must  be  conducted  in   an\r\n\r\natmosphere   free  from  distortions   and   in   an\r\n\r\natmosphere of calm and careful thinking on the  part\r\n\r\nof  the electorate, so that the right answer may  be\r\n\r\nascertained. If it is the desire of the majority  of\r\n\r\nthe   electorate   to  choose  a  form   of   closer\r\n\r\nassociation  that is not embodied in  Command  Paper\r\n\r\n33,  i.e., if they reject Command Paper 33, then  it\r\n\r\nis  the  responsibility of the Government to get  in\r\n\r\ntouch  with the Federation Government and convey  to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government the desires of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  and  do  their  best  to  secure  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  the form of closer association  that  the\r\n\r\nreferendum result shows. It is wrong on the part  or\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister to say, \"Tell me what  you  want\r\n\r\nand I will get it for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou.\"  He has no right to say it because he  has  no\r\n\r\npower to give what the people want. What he can  say\r\n\r\nis  to assure this House and the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nthat  whatever form of closer association the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  choose,  it shall  be  his  duty  and\r\n\r\nresponsibility   to   have  discussions   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government with a view  to  implementing\r\n\r\nthe  result of the referendum. The Member for  Anson\r\n\r\nwas  carried  away  by his strong criticism  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and he even went to the extent of describing\r\n\r\ndistortion  as  dishonest. There  cannot  be  honest\r\n\r\ndistortion and dishonest distortion; a distortion is\r\n\r\na  distortion;  it is a twisting of facts.  He  said\r\n\r\nthat   there   is  a  very  curious  definition   of\r\n\r\ndishonesty. He went on to explain what he  meant  by\r\n\r\nthis,  that proposal (b) in the motion of the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  is  dishonest  in  the  context  of  today\r\n\r\nalthough it could have been honest 10 months ago. So\r\n\r\nin  this  merger issue, Sir, everything  is  getting\r\n\r\nconfused.  It would seem to the mind of  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  that honest things can become  dishonest\r\n\r\nthings just through the process of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson again found occasion to\r\n\r\ncriticise  the Press, but, Sir, we in the Opposition\r\n\r\nhave  seen  that the Member for Anson  secures  more\r\n\r\ncoverage than any other Member of the Opposition. We\r\n\r\ndo not grudge him that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson again said that other\r\n\r\nproposals for closer association are intended to  be\r\n\r\na  smoke-screen. I think Sir, he, as  a  responsible\r\n\r\nMember  and  leader of a responsible  Party  - so  he\r\n\r\nclaims  - must not use words that will tend  to  make\r\n\r\nthe  people more confused. He was prepared  to  have\r\n\r\nmore than one question posed in a referendum and yet\r\n\r\nthrough  his exuberance he described other questions\r\n\r\nto  be posed as a smokescreen. Surely, Sir, when  we\r\n\r\ndebate the questions to be posed in a referendum, it\r\n\r\nis  essential for all Members of this Assembly, from\r\n\r\nall  political Parties represented in this Assembly,\r\n\r\nto   discuss  the  questions  in  a  calm  cool  and\r\n\r\ncollected  manner with a view to putting  our  heads\r\n\r\ntogether  to  find out what other  forms  of  closer\r\n\r\nassociation  there can be apart from  Command  Paper\r\n\r\n33.  If  there  are three possible  and  practicable\r\n\r\nforms of closer association, then those forms\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  be the subject of questions to be posed  in  a\r\n\r\nreferendum.  No Party in this House  should  try  to\r\n\r\nendeavour  to  pose  a question which  has  a  party\r\n\r\npolitical  content. The Barisan Sosialis should  not\r\n\r\nsay, \"We want to see our question posed.\" The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave  not  said that they want to see  the  question\r\n\r\nposed. What they are posing in Command Paper No.  33\r\n\r\nis  a  decision of this Assembly. There is no P.A.P.\r\n\r\nquestion  at  all  and there is no  reason  why  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis should say that they want to have a\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis question posed in the  referendum.\r\n\r\nLet  us all forget our party politics in this matter\r\n\r\nof  grave importance to the public. Let us sink  our\r\n\r\npolitical  differences and find  the  best  possible\r\n\r\nsolution for the people of Singapore, and after that\r\n\r\nlet  us  have it out in this Assembly,  and  if  the\r\n\r\nOpposition could contain their impatience  and  they\r\n\r\ndesire to see the end of the P.A.P. until after that\r\n\r\ndate, then I could say that the Opposition would  be\r\n\r\na  very  responsible Opposition. Let us not try  and\r\n\r\nconfuse  the  electorate on a matter on  which  they\r\n\r\nhave to seek our guidance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, as to the questions to be posed. There\r\n\r\nis  no  necessity for any group in this Assembly  to\r\n\r\ntry  and describe the other party as dishonest - as  a\r\n\r\nparty  that  is  out to perpetrate a  fraud  on  the\r\n\r\npeople. If the questions have been fully debated and\r\n\r\naccepted  by the Assembly, then it is for  each  and\r\n\r\nevery  political  Party to go  out  to  the  masses,\r\n\r\nconduct  referendum  meetings  and  explain  to  the\r\n\r\npeople in a straightforward, honest way the form  of\r\n\r\ncloser  association that the political Party  stands\r\n\r\nfor.  No  one in this House would imagine  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis   would  be  holding   referendum\r\n\r\nmeetings  to try and persuade the people  to  accept\r\n\r\nCommand  Paper 33. But if they feel that their  idea\r\n\r\nof  closer association is complete and unconditional\r\n\r\nmerger, then they are free to explain their stand to\r\n\r\nthe  electorate and get the electorate to vote  with\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in all these discussions on the form of\r\n\r\ncloser   association,   let   us,   as   responsible\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people in this House, be most\r\n\r\nconscious  of the fact that we have to consider  the\r\n\r\nviews\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the other party, that is, the Government of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, and whatever utterances we may\r\n\r\nmake,   let  us  be  very  conscious  of  the  grave\r\n\r\nresponsibility that is thrust upon us.  Let  us  not\r\n\r\nmake  it more difficult for the Government to  carry\r\n\r\nout the wishes of the electorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will move my amendment later on, but there\r\n\r\nis  a  point  that  the Member  for  Queenstown  has\r\n\r\nbrought  up in his very lengthy speech. He  confuses\r\n\r\nhimself - he  contradicts himself.  He  says,  \"Before\r\n\r\nthey  can  express their choice,  that  is  to  say,\r\n\r\nbefore  the electorate can give their vote,  on  the\r\n\r\nquestions  posed  to  them,  they  must   first   be\r\n\r\nconsulted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a referendum is a form of consultation of the\r\n\r\nelectorate. Perhaps, Sir, he does not know what he\r\n\r\nhas been reading since that masterpiece could not\r\n\r\nhave been written by him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, then he keeps on playing the old line - again\r\n\r\ngeneral    election,   general   election,   general\r\n\r\nelection.  I  say to them again, forget the  general\r\n\r\nelection. If they are so keen to prove their  worth,\r\n\r\nto  prove that they are the staunch champions in the\r\n\r\nOpposition, go out, come back, and I shall  take  my\r\n\r\nhat off to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> If they ever come back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he says again that merger has been rejected by\r\n\r\nthe  people of Anson. By that I think he means  that\r\n\r\nbecause  the P.A.P. was not returned and the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson was returned, the merger proposal of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had been rejected by the people  of  Anson. I do not think it is a right conclusion. If, as\r\n\r\nhe  is very fond of saying, the S.P.A. Alliance  and\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. are on the same side of the fence on this\r\n\r\nquestion  of  merger, and if he  were  to  take  the\r\n\r\ntrouble  to add up the votes of the P.A.P. and  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. Alliance candidates, he would find that  they\r\n\r\nare more than the votes of the Anson candidate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot do what we like on this very grave\r\n\r\nissue. I know the P.A.P. are very fond of trying to\r\n\r\nknock out the Barisan and doing all they can to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmake  use  of this merger referendum as a  means  of\r\n\r\ndelivering the knock-out blow. And the Barisan is so\r\n\r\nkeen to have a one-question referendum to knock  out\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. In this mutual desire of wanting to knock\r\n\r\nout each other, let them remember that they must not\r\n\r\ntry  to  knock  out the interests of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three questions - the two questions moved by the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister and the amendment to be proposed  by\r\n\r\nme - will be  posed in the referendum, and in the same\r\n\r\nway as the referendum in Newfoundland was conducted.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  there  is this precedent  which  we  can\r\n\r\nfollow.  But the questions posed in the Newfoundland\r\n\r\nreferendum were questions that had a bearing on  the\r\n\r\nnext  constitutional  step  - the  advance  that  was\r\n\r\nsought  for Newfoundland. So, in the same way,  when\r\n\r\nwe   pose   all   possible  questions   for   closer\r\n\r\nassociation  with  the  Federation  of  Malaya,  the\r\n\r\nelectorate can choose one form and reject the  rest.\r\n\r\nIt is silly to suggest, as has been suggested by the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson and the Member for Queenstown - they\r\n\r\nseem  to  echo each other - that the voter must  have\r\n\r\nthe right to say \"Yes\" or \"No\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Yes\" or \"No\" to three questions? If you get two\r\n\r\n\"Yeses\" and one \"No\", what is the answer? You get no\r\n\r\nanswer  at all. The electorate can have their choice\r\n\r\nand  if,  as  the  Barisan believe,  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore do not like Command Paper 33, surely  they\r\n\r\nwill  have every opportunity to vote for a  form  of\r\n\r\ncloser association that is not Command Paper 33.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to repeat my appeal to this House\r\n\r\nagain on this very important issue which means  life\r\n\r\nand  death to the people of Singapore. Let  us  sink\r\n\r\nour  party differences. Let us rise above them.  Put\r\n\r\nour  heads  together and find the best solution  for\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, we are having a debate  ranging  over\r\n\r\nthe  three questions contained in the motion. First,\r\n\r\nI  will  touch on the motion by the Prime  Minister.\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,   Sir,  the  Prime   Minister,   when\r\n\r\nconcluding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis  speech a little while ago, said that any person\r\n\r\nwho  had correct thoughts would not doubt the motion\r\n\r\nmoved  by  him;  but  I will say that  anyone  whose\r\n\r\nthoughts  are  correct and who has  right  thinking,\r\n\r\nwill not propose such a motion as he has.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us now talk about the few\r\n\r\npoints  raised by the Prime Minister. He  said  that\r\n\r\nthe   Barisan  Sosialis  had  made  a   mistake   by\r\n\r\nsuggesting a type of merger based on the Penang  and\r\n\r\nMalacca  type. I would like to say that the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  had  never  made a  mistake.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  proposed a merger such as the  Penang  and\r\n\r\nMalacca type with certain conditions, but the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  used to quote out of context  and  distort\r\n\r\nfacts. So if any person has made any mistake, it  is\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P., because the P.A.P. Government  want  to\r\n\r\ndeal  the  Barisan Sosialis a blow; but because  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. cannot get any excuse, they are now  raising\r\n\r\nthe  Communist  bogey. The Prime Minister  dare  not\r\n\r\npose one question to the people for a decision. This\r\n\r\nis  because  the  P.A.P. have no  courage  and  also\r\n\r\nbecause the Prime Minister has no confidence in  his\r\n\r\nWhite Paper on merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the Prime Minister in his\r\n\r\nspeech many times quoted the speeches made by  other\r\n\r\npeople and so created a lot of controversy. That  is\r\n\r\nimproper. He should not have done so. He also in the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  his  speech quoted various  examples  in\r\n\r\nother  countries where referenda were held.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  by  quoting examples from other  countries  on\r\n\r\nnational referenda, he could not have realised  what\r\n\r\nis now before us here. He said that what he had been\r\n\r\nadvocating  was something with precedents.  He  said\r\n\r\nthat  other  people  may no  be  familiar  with  the\r\n\r\nprecedents in other countries; but I am sure that in\r\n\r\nother   countries  the  referendum  law  has   never\r\n\r\nprovided such a provision as deeming blank votes and\r\n\r\nuncertain votes to be in support of the Government's\r\n\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister also said that the White Paper merger proposals were very good and alleged that the other type of merger proposition was very bad. He said that the Government's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerger  proposals included autonomy  in  labour  and\r\n\r\neducation. But I have some doubts. If the Government\r\n\r\nis so confident that its White Paper on merger is so\r\n\r\nvery good, why does it dare not put it to the people\r\n\r\nfor a decision?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister also said that the National Referendum Bill was very logical and would meet the present situation. But I would say that this type or logic must be the P.A.P. type of logic. What he said about meeting the present situation I think means\r\n\r\nthat it must be meeting the P.A.P. situation at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  because if the P.A.P. does not  go  through\r\n\r\nwith merger, its life will not be long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now talk about why the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has moved this motion. I would  like\r\n\r\nto  talk about the motives and the plot of the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, these two  points  are\r\n\r\nworth  studying. Let me expound to you  slowly.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, we can now see very clearly that  the\r\n\r\nNational Referendum Bill, which was passed last week\r\n\r\nin this House, is one that cannot be seen by anyone,\r\n\r\nbecause it is undomocratic and unreasonable.  It  is\r\n\r\nfull  of arbitrary provisions. There are many things\r\n\r\nin it more Fascist than the Fascists and more Hitler\r\n\r\nthan  Hitler,  but  this Bill has  been  barbarously\r\n\r\npassed  by  the Government. The Party in  power  has\r\n\r\nnever  seriously taken the views of  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nParties.  It  has  always closed  its  ears  to  the\r\n\r\npropositions and views of the Opposition Parties.  I\r\n\r\nhave  many  doubts  about the motion  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  If  only the views of the Government  and\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  Parties can  be  unified,  all  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties can be resolved. But to arrive  at  any\r\n\r\nagreement with the Government is not possible. I  am\r\n\r\nsure of it. Even the Prime Minister knows this to be\r\n\r\nso.  But  Mr Speaker, Sir, since the facts  are  as\r\n\r\nwhat  I  have  said,  why does  the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nintroduce  his motion? It is worth our  study  here.\r\n\r\nJudging from the appearance of the motion, it  looks\r\n\r\nlike  the  type of request the Barisan Sosialis  has\r\n\r\nasked  for, because the Government has said that  it\r\n\r\nwill  put the Barisan Sosialis request to be  framed\r\n\r\nin  the  question.  Now he has introduced  a  motion\r\n\r\nincorporating a type of motion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupposedly   to   represent  the  Barisan   Sosialis\r\n\r\nrequest.  Let  us  ask  whether  it  represents  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis' request. I say it does  not.  The\r\n\r\nmatter  is not so simple as that. I say the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  has many reasonable requests and  demands.\r\n\r\nWhy   are  all  those  requests  and  demands  being\r\n\r\nobjected  to  and  rejected by the  Government?  For\r\n\r\ninstance, the Barisan Sosialis said there should  be\r\n\r\nonly  one  question in this. The national referendum\r\n\r\nshould  provide  that  there  should  be  only   one\r\n\r\nquestion  for  the  people to decide,  whether  they\r\n\r\nwould  accept or reject the Government's White Paper\r\n\r\non merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another request by the Barisan Sosialis was that\r\n\r\nany  blank votes and uncertain votes should  not  be\r\n\r\nconstrued  as  those supporting any  side,  but  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could not accept it. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\naccording  to  what  we have been  debating  on  the\r\n\r\nNational  Referendum Bill last week, the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  forgotten  the  interests  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. What the Government is now looking  after\r\n\r\nand  is caring for is its own interest. It will  not\r\n\r\ncare  for  anything  else.  Even  when  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  has  been criticising the  Government  and\r\n\r\nexposing  its  true character, the Government  still\r\n\r\nbreathes and is very thick-skinned. It will not feel\r\n\r\nany  remorse or any shame. I would like to point out\r\n\r\nthat the Government's motion now under consideration\r\n\r\nis not honest and not reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has always prided himself on being a very clever person. But at the Students'\r\n\r\nForum  organised  by the University Students  Union, \r\n\r\nwhen asked a question by Mr Tommy Koh, he could not\r\n\r\nanswer  it.  At  that moment, he said  that  only  a\r\n\r\nfoolish person would ask such a foolish question  to\r\n\r\nget a foolish answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that the motion by the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister is, of course, not meant to arrive at\r\n\r\na  foolish conclusion. Mr Speaker, Sir, let me talk\r\n\r\nabout   the   Prime  Minister's  motion  now   under\r\n\r\nconsideration. It appears that the Prime Minister is\r\n\r\nrather  generous in moving this motion  and  letting\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly  discuss it. But  there  are  ulterior\r\n\r\nmotives  behind  it.  All the actions  and  measures\r\n\r\ntaken by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are very undemocratic, and yet it  tries  to\r\n\r\ncover  itself and put up a facade of democracy.  The\r\n\r\nmore it pretends, the more it becomes unseemly,  and\r\n\r\nthe more it exposes itself. This motion of the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  shows  that  the Government  is  having  a\r\n\r\nguilty  conscience. Why? The reason is very  simple.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  the Prime Minister knows that the National\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill is not popular with the people.  The\r\n\r\npeople  do not like it. It should have provided  for\r\n\r\nthe  people to decide on whether they want or do not\r\n\r\nwant the Government's White Paper on merger; and  it\r\n\r\nshould have been drafted in such a way as to achieve\r\n\r\nthat  purpose. The Government has tried  to  confuse\r\n\r\nthe  issue in the National Referendum Bill. Although\r\n\r\nby  passing the Bill it could pose two questions, it\r\n\r\nknows   it   is  doing  it  by  sheer  strength   of\r\n\r\ncompulsion. It knows that its White Paper on  merger\r\n\r\nwill  not  be acceptable to the people. It had  said\r\n\r\nthat  this  Bill was a general Referendum Bill,  but\r\n\r\nlater  on it changed its mind and said that it could\r\n\r\nbe  a  specific  one.  After  holding  the  national\r\n\r\nreferendum,  the Bill would be repealed.  Now,  this\r\n\r\nproves  that  the Government has been wrong  in  the\r\n\r\npast.  Being a lawyer, the Prime Minister  dare  not\r\n\r\naccept  the fact that the Government or himself  has\r\n\r\nbeen  wrong.  He  has  only  accepted  part  of  the\r\n\r\nmistake,  and that shows his cowardice. He has  said\r\n\r\nin the past that the Government would let the people\r\n\r\ndecide the question on the White Paper on merger. He\r\n\r\nhas said that the people could mark an X against the\r\n\r\ncolumn marked \"yes\" if they accept the question. The\r\n\r\npeople could also mark an X against the column  \"no\"\r\n\r\nto  show that they reject it. It is obvious that the\r\n\r\nquestion  should be so framed as to ask  the  people\r\n\r\nwhether  they want or reject the Government's  White\r\n\r\nPaper  merger  proposals.  The  Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\nboasted  that he would ask the people, but  now  the\r\n\r\nsituation  has  changed because the Government  have\r\n\r\nbeen exposed by the Opposition Parties and the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister can find no way to save his Government from\r\n\r\nthe  present  embarrassment. He is a  very  eloquent\r\n\r\norator but today he cannot even give a reason or  an\r\n\r\nargument  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  substantiate  his  Party's  stand  on  the\r\n\r\npropositions.  In  spite of his  eloquence,  and  in\r\n\r\nspite  of  the White Paper being in black  type,  he\r\n\r\ncannot  blind the people. However much he  tries  to\r\n\r\ndeceive the people he will not succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we can clearly see that the\r\n\r\nGovernment are gradually trying to find  a  way  out\r\n\r\nfrom  their present predicament. The Government have\r\n\r\ncommitted  an  unforgivable crime by  creating  some\r\n\r\nundemocratic  provisions in the National  Referendum\r\n\r\nBill.  Now  the  P.A.P. are experiencing  a  guilty\r\n\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the reports in today's\r\n\r\nnewspapers  we  can see a statement  issued  by  the\r\n\r\nPolitical Bureau of the P.A.P. which says  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. cannot  withstand  the  pressure  coming  from  all\r\n\r\nquarters.  The P.A.P. are trying to go  all  out  to\r\n\r\nconvince  the people of the necessity of clause  29,\r\n\r\nso that they can have a scapegoat. Mr Speaker. Sir,\r\n\r\nlet  me in this House show you how irresponsible the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are by trying to push their mistakes  on  to\r\n\r\nothers.  This is a copy of the Sin Chew Jit  Poh  of\r\n\r\ntoday,  local page No. 1, which contains this report\r\n\r\nof  the  statement  issued by the  Political  Bureau\r\n\r\nsaying that the provisions regarding blank votes and\r\n\r\nuncertain votes --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do hope that the hon. Lady\r\n\r\nis  not  going  back to clause 29. We have  finished\r\n\r\nwith  clause 29. It has been passed and written into\r\n\r\nthe  Bill. We are now discussing what questions will\r\n\r\nbe  asked on this referendum. I cannot see  how  the\r\n\r\nmerits  of  clause 29 have anything to do with  this\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, what I would like to point out is this. At  the\r\n\r\npresent  juncture the Government has made a  mistake\r\n\r\nand  is  trying to get a scapegoat to cover  up  its\r\n\r\nmistake.  Just like this motion, it is  a  means  by\r\n\r\nwhich  the Government tries to find a scapegoat  for\r\n\r\nthe  mistakes  it  has made. When  this  motion  was\r\n\r\ntabled  by the Prime Minister, he knew it  would  be\r\n\r\npassed.  So  why  should such a  motion  be  brought\r\n\r\nforward?  It is very simple. If the question  should\r\n\r\ncome before the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse  for debate, then the Prime Minister will  say\r\n\r\nlater  on  that  this is a question  that  has  been\r\n\r\ndecided  on by the Assembly and that he has  nothing\r\n\r\nto do with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> There is no logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): This is the\r\n\r\ncunning  logic of the P.A.P. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  now\r\n\r\nlet  me  deal with the motion of the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nWhen  moving  it, he said \"That this House  resolves\r\n\r\nthat  the  people of Singapore be asked  to  express\r\n\r\ntheir   choice  on  the  mode  and  manner  of   the\r\n\r\ninevitable  reunification of the  two  territories.\"\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,   Sir,  this  so-called   \"inevitable\r\n\r\nreunification\", especially the word \"inevitable\".  I\r\n\r\nwould  say, at the present juncture, that the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, in the absence of a better  term  for\r\n\r\n\"merger\", can avoid a merger. What is inevitable  is\r\n\r\nactually inevitable to the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in moving his motion the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister brought out two alternatives. The first is\r\n\r\nthe constitutional arrangements set out in the White\r\n\r\nPaper  giving  Singapore autonomy in  education  and\r\n\r\nlabour. On the White Paper merger proposals we  have\r\n\r\nhad  a  very lengthy debate in this House and there\r\n\r\nis   no   need  for  me  to  repeat  the  arguments,\r\n\r\nbut --- [Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Delta says that\r\n\r\nalthough  I  say  I  do  not  want  to  repeat   the\r\n\r\narguments. I have repeated them many times. This  is\r\n\r\nthe  most  difficult thing - we tell  them  one,  two,\r\n\r\nthree,  four times, and still they do not understand\r\n\r\nwhat  we tell them! As though we are talking to cows\r\n\r\nwho  cannot understand what we say. We are now in  a\r\n\r\nposition  in which scholars talk reason to  soldiers\r\n\r\nwho  cannot  understand reason at all. That  is  the\r\n\r\ntrue  position in any case. If we do not  speak  our\r\n\r\nminds,  then  we do not discharge our duty.

He mentions autonomy in education and labour. It is, I say, humbug. The people are very clear about it. So, on the second alternative, I would say that it is a\r\n\r\nvery  strange  alternative to us.  More  so  to  the\r\n\r\npeople outside this House.

I feel that the first motion is just\r\n\r\nlike a test stone. If the merger proposals are to be\r\n\r\nlikened  to  gold, then it should not be  afraid  of\r\n\r\nfire.  If the Government feels that the White  Paper\r\n\r\nmerger proposals are good, then it should accept the\r\n\r\namendment moved by the Opposition. The second motion\r\n\r\ntabled  by  the Opposition is moved to  condemn  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   for  distorting  the   stand   of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  I  feel  that a responsible  Government\r\n\r\nshould not distort the stand of other people. By  so\r\n\r\ndoing, it is not acting responsibly. It will  be  an\r\n\r\nirresponsible Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, let me make use of the\r\n\r\nwords  uttered  by  the Political Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister to describe the motion of the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.   I  feel  that  the  Political  Secretary\r\n\r\nuttered a sentence which is very appropriate for the\r\n\r\ndescription of the motion in the name of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister. He said this in his third talk over  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore. This is reported in the Sin Chew Jit  Poh\r\n\r\nof Tuesday, 12th June, at page 5. What he said reads\r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"To treat a dead horse as a live horse and give it\r\n\r\ntreatment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  feel that the motion of the Prime Minister is  to\r\n\r\ntry  and treat a dead horse as a live horse, because\r\n\r\nthe  political  future of the  Government  has  gone\r\n\r\nbankrupt.  On the day when this National  Referendum\r\n\r\nBill was passed, the Government was dead. As far  as\r\n\r\nthe   political  future  is  concerned,  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  is dictatorial and undemocratic. He  wants\r\n\r\nto pose two unacceptable questions to the people. He\r\n\r\nwants  to have these questions debated in this House\r\n\r\nin  order to redeem himself from the bad name he has\r\n\r\nacquired  by  committing  crimes  in  the  name   of\r\n\r\ndemocracy. I will say this motion will not help  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in any way to rejuvenate or  revive  the\r\n\r\npolitical life of the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude my speech, I will say that I\r\n\r\nstrongly  oppose  the  motion  moved  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.

At the\r\n\r\nsame  time, the Members of the Opposition have  day\r\n\r\nin  and  day  out  been repeating  their  old  tunes\r\n\r\nwithout producing any new points of argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Queenstown brought forward\r\n\r\na  few strange arguments. I am therefore taking this\r\n\r\nopportunity of rebutting him. First, he  said  that\r\n\r\nwe  on  the  Government side  are  selling  out  the\r\n\r\npeople.  I  do not understand his interpretation  of\r\n\r\nthe  word \"sell-out\". We have explained very clearly\r\n\r\nto  the  people  of Singapore that the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nmerger  proposals are not at all detrimental to  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people here. The citizenship of the\r\n\r\nChinese  population  in  Singapore  is  still  being\r\n\r\nretained.  At  the same time, we are to  retain  our\r\n\r\nautonomy  in  education  and  labour.  Therefore,  I\r\n\r\ncannot see any meaning in the words \"selling out\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to raise is this. The\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown has repeatedly urged that  we\r\n\r\nshould go back to the masses for a general election.\r\n\r\nI  remember, Sir, that after we were defeated in the\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  by-election and when we  were  discussing\r\n\r\nwhether or not we should resign from the Government,\r\n\r\nhe   insisted  that  we  should  stay  on   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  This  is because they  were  afraid  of\r\n\r\nlosing  the  posts  of Parliamentary  Secretary.  We\r\n\r\nexplained at that time our failure in the  Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nby-election.  At  that  time  we  did  not  see  any\r\n\r\npossibility of realising the merger proposals of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. We now see that there is a possibility of the\r\n\r\nmerger proposals being realised. At that time, those\r\n\r\nex-Parliamentary  Secretaries  were   ambitious   to\r\n\r\nbecome  Ministers  or even Prime Minister  and  take\r\n\r\nover  the  government. They did not  say  that  they\r\n\r\nwanted  to resign. Instead of that, they said,  \"Now\r\n\r\nyou resign and we will take over the government.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the split in the P.A.P. is partly\r\n\r\ndue  to the personal ambition of a certain group  of\r\n\r\npeople and partly due to their objection to merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown said that the P.A.P. did\r\n\r\nnot  get a mandate from the people in the June  1959\r\n\r\nelections   in  support  of  the  merger  proposals.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,  he has repeatedly challenged  us  to  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  election. Let me remind him that  prior  to\r\n\r\nthe  general  elections he had signed an undertaking\r\n\r\nwith  the P.A.P. This undertaking must be signed  by\r\n\r\nevery  P.A.P. candidate who contested  the  general\r\n\r\nelection.  In this undertaking they said they  would\r\n\r\nabide  by  the  policy as contained in  the  Party's\r\n\r\nFourth Anniversary Celebration Souvenir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the people of Singapore and even the\r\n\r\npeople of Malaya know that the ultimate objective of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is  to fight for a merger  of  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories  and  to  achieve  the  independence  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  through  merger with  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya. In this undertaking, it was also stated that\r\n\r\nif any Member should resign or was expelled from the\r\n\r\nParty,  he  should  also  resign  his  seat  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly. If they are manly enough, they should have\r\n\r\nkept  their promise.

Mr  Speaker,  the  P.A.P.  Government  is  a\r\n\r\nrealistic  Government. We are not prepared  to  day-dream. We are conscious of the present circumstances\r\n\r\nin Malaya, and in this context we have brought about\r\n\r\nthis  Cmd. Paper 33. This proves that we are  really\r\n\r\nsincere  in fulfilling the wishes of the  people  of\r\n\r\nthe   two   territories  in  the  reunification   of\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.49 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what we are concerned with is not theory, nor\r\n\r\nare  we  prepared to be the slaves of any ideologies\r\n\r\nor  jams.  What we are concerned with is  the  basic\r\n\r\nlivelihood of the people. We have nearly solved  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  housing  in  Singapore.  Now  we  hope,\r\n\r\nthrough  merger,  we can solve the problems  of  the\r\n\r\npeople in respect of clothing and food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our declaration of the merger of Singapore\r\n\r\nand   Malaya,   the  Barisan  Sosialis   and   other\r\n\r\npoliticians  have openly declared their  anti-merger\r\n\r\nstand.   They  are  only  stooges  of  the   Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunists. We are not prepared to be the slaves  of\r\n\r\nany  political  ideology. We maintain  that  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of Malaya at this moment, only Cmd. Paper 33\r\n\r\ncan   bring  about  the  reunification  of  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories  in  a realistic way.  Yet  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis do not stick to what they say because  they\r\n\r\ndare  not  state  openly  their  anti-merger  stand.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  they  introduce  many  proposals   which\r\n\r\ncannot be fulfilled under the present circumstances.\r\n\r\nI understand even the Chinese born in the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya,  if  their parents were not  Federation-born, will have to apply for Federation citizenship.\r\n\r\nUnder  these  circumstances, we  cannot  expect  the\r\n\r\nleaders  across  the  causeway,  that  means   these\r\n\r\nleaders  who  are  mostly  non-Chinese,  to   accept\r\n\r\nautomatic conversion of citizenship for the  624,000\r\n\r\nChinese in Singapore. If that is practicable in  the\r\n\r\npresent  circumstances, then we  need  not  have  to\r\n\r\nlabour ourselves at this moment. That is to say,  in\r\n\r\nthe present context the purpose of this demand is to\r\n\r\ntry  to  embarrass the merger proposals. Any  person\r\n\r\nwho is conscientious, cool, peaceful and sober, will\r\n\r\nbe   able   to  understand  that,  in  the   present\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  the  introduction  of  this   demand\r\n\r\ncannot be acceptable. Those who can use their brains\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to understand that the demand brought\r\n\r\nforward by the Barisan Sosialis has one motive, that\r\n\r\nis, to block the way for merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the amendment by the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown.  After some scrutiny we  can  understand\r\n\r\nthat  its purpose is to try to show that the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore do not want merger, because they  want\r\n\r\nthe people to say only yes or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno. By this they hope the P.A.P. Government will ask\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore whether they will accept the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper on merger, that is to say, they hope  by\r\n\r\nthat  they  can incite the general public to  oppose\r\n\r\nthe White Paper merger. If the White Paper on merger\r\n\r\nis defeated then there will be no merger. That is  a\r\n\r\npassive way out. It is not a positive way out.  They\r\n\r\nthink that if the White Paper on merger is defeated,\r\n\r\nthen  there will be no merger. But everybody  should\r\n\r\nknow  that merger and Malaysia are not things  which\r\n\r\nany   politician  can  block.  If  we  examine   the\r\n\r\nsituation  in  Singapore in a cool, calm  and  sober\r\n\r\nway,   we   can   realise  that  when  Malaysia   is\r\n\r\nestablished and if Singapore is not part of it, then\r\n\r\nSingapore will be isolated. Then Singapore  will  be\r\n\r\nin  a  difficult  position and  will  find  it  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  resolve  the  problem  of  earning  a\r\n\r\nlivelihood  and other matters. On this we  have  not\r\n\r\nseen  any  concrete suggestions or  plans  from  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis. During the course of the  debate,\r\n\r\nthere  was only shouting, yelling, and levelling  of\r\n\r\ninvectives. Even when we on this side of  the  House\r\n\r\nwanted  to  make speeches, they tried to prevent  us\r\n\r\nfrom  making  speeches. That  shows  their  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards  tackling the problems before us.  When  his\r\n\r\namendment  is  defeated, I am sure  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  will bring up another  amendment  which\r\n\r\nwill  be  to  request that the 624,000  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   would   automatically   become   Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens. Its purpose, we all know, is to thwart the\r\n\r\nmerger  plan. The consequences of that will be  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  will be isolated from the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, about the second\r\n\r\namendment, I am not prepared to touched on it at the\r\n\r\nmoment  because  I  would like  to  see  what  grand\r\n\r\narguments the Member for Anson will be advancing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching upon the speech made by the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  just now, it seems that I have been  watching\r\n\r\nan  interesting exhibition by him because I have not\r\n\r\nmuch  opportunity to see him put  up  such  a  grand\r\n\r\nperformance when he was gesticulating with all kinds\r\n\r\nof  vivid demonstrations, rather dramatic in his own\r\n\r\nway, to attract his audience. But I can recollect  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  he pointed out that Singapore should  be\r\n\r\none of the component States of the Federation and be\r\n\r\nlike   any  one  of  the  present  States   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation, and enjoy equal rights as any one of the\r\n\r\nStates  of the Federation. But he admitted  that  he\r\n\r\ndid   not   know  that  there  could  be   so   many\r\n\r\ndifficulties   and  complexities  in  carrying   out\r\n\r\nconstitutional   arrangements.   He   confessed   it\r\n\r\nfrankly. And the same with the Barisan Sosialis when\r\n\r\nthey  demanded that Singapore should be merged on  a\r\n\r\ncertain basis. Later when they found that they  were\r\n\r\nreally   in   the  position  of  being   wrong   and\r\n\r\nembarrassed  and  in  a predicament,  they  advanced\r\n\r\nanother  claim saying that the citizens of Singapore\r\n\r\nshould automatically become Federal citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also clearly expressed the\r\n\r\nwish  that merger should be  delayed for as  long  as\r\n\r\npossible.  This  is similar to the  Barisan's  plot,\r\n\r\ni.e. when  the merger proposals were  first  aired,\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Barisan Sosialis were  going  round\r\n\r\neverywhere trying to persuade the people  to  oppose\r\n\r\nmerger.  Supporters of the Barisan Sosialis kept  on\r\n\r\nasking  the  people, why did they want merger?  They\r\n\r\nargued  with  the leadership of the  P.A.P. against\r\n\r\nmerger.  From  that time onwards, we  realised  that\r\n\r\nthey  were trying to plot against merger openly.  In\r\n\r\npublic  they  declare that they are  in  support  of\r\n\r\nmerger,  but secretly I think that anyone who  comes\r\n\r\nto  know  them  will know that they  are,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nopposed to merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment proposed by them calls for the\r\n\r\nautomatic  conversion  of  Singapore  citizens  into\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens. I hope that when the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson moves his amendment he will tell us whether he\r\n\r\nagrees that the education policy of Singapore should\r\n\r\nkeep  in line with the Rahim Talib education policy,\r\n\r\nand  whether  he  is  prepared to  let  autonomy  in\r\n\r\neducation  and labour be handed over to the  control\r\n\r\nof  the Central Government. I would also like to ask\r\n\r\nhim  whether  he is prepared to accept any  measures\r\n\r\nput out by the Central Government, for instance, the\r\n\r\n4  to  1  ratio  of  Malays to non-Malays  in  civil\r\n\r\nservice. You see, you cannot  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  the best of two worlds. You  cannot  have\r\n\r\nyour  cake and eat it too. That is why if  you  want\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger, you cannot at the same  time  make\r\n\r\nyour  own  demands.  And  so  by  putting  out  such\r\n\r\npropositions   which   are   unacceptable   to   the\r\n\r\nFederation, they are thwarting merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the problems facing Singapore are mostly connected with the livelihood of the\r\n\r\npeople.  The main task of the P.A.P. is to safeguard\r\n\r\nthe interests of the people. We do not intend to  be\r\n\r\ndoctrinaires. We do not want to become slaves to any\r\n\r\n\"isms\" without regard to our practical situation. As\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister has said, we will not become the\r\n\r\npawns  or  stooges  of the Malayan Communist  Party.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  the present objective  circumstances,\r\n\r\nthe  proposals  as contained in the White  Paper  on\r\n\r\nmerger  are the ones which can resolve the  problems\r\n\r\nof the livelihood of the people. They can find a way\r\n\r\nout for the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker,  Sir, the Opposition  Parties  have\r\n\r\nintroduced an amendment from which we can see  their\r\n\r\nvicious plot. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, the most important thing  is  merger,\r\n\r\nbut  the  Opposition  Parties have  all  along  been\r\n\r\nrepeating their platitudes and attacking the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmerger proposals. This action is rather vicious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, from the amendment before us we can see something vicious behind it. Since the\r\n\r\nleader  of  the Barisan Sosialis has taken  part  in\r\n\r\nradio  forums, we know that they wanted a Penang  or\r\n\r\nMalacca  type of merger. After this type  of  merger\r\n\r\nwas  aired, the Barisan Sosialis leadership  thought\r\n\r\nthat  they  were more capable and so  began  talking\r\n\r\nabout how useful they had been in their branches  by\r\n\r\nconducting  night classes in the trade unions.  They\r\n\r\nalso  talked about the good things about the  Penang\r\n\r\nand Malacca type of merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal for the Penang and Malacca type of\r\n\r\nmerger  at  that time seemed to be a good  one.  But\r\n\r\nthen  the Member for Stamford said that genuine gold\r\n\r\ndreads  no  fire.  Let me ask: how  long  can  their\r\n\r\nproposed Penang and Malacca type of merger stand the\r\n\r\ntest of fire? It is only after a few months that  we\r\n\r\nsee  that  their  type of merger cannot  stand  this\r\n\r\ntest. And so they now turn round and deny that  they\r\n\r\nhave made such a proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the speeches made by the Barisan Members here,\r\n\r\nwe  can see that the contents are exactly the  same.\r\n\r\nThere  are  no fresh arguments. They are frying  the\r\n\r\nrice  over  and  ever  again. This  is  a  most  apt\r\n\r\ndescription for them. Why do they oppose our putting\r\n\r\ntheir type of merger as one of the questions for the\r\n\r\npeople  to  decide?  I think the reasons  are  that,\r\n\r\nfirst  and foremost, they are opposed to merger.  If\r\n\r\nthere  is any form of merger which is acceptable  by\r\n\r\nthe  people,  then  it  will  not  be  good  to  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and  their stooges. And  if  the  people\r\n\r\naccept one of the merger forms, then the true motive\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan Sosialis will be exposed. In  fact,\r\n\r\nthey do not want merger. The next reason is that  if\r\n\r\nthe  people accepted the type of merger based on the\r\n\r\nPenang  and Malacca type, then the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nwould  be  afraid of the consequences because  their\r\n\r\ntype  of  merger  would, in fact, sell  out  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation and autonomy in labour and the citizenship\r\n\r\nof about 300,000 Singapore citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is their aim? I think we know they only want\r\n\r\nfull  internal self-government. That  is  what  they\r\n\r\nhave  been  talking about in the  trade  unions  and\r\n\r\ntheir night classes and in other organisations under\r\n\r\ntheir  control. What is meant by full internal self-government?  What does it mean? It  means  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis will be playing together with  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists  to enslave the people.  Full  internal\r\n\r\nself-government will mean that the colonialists will\r\n\r\nstill  be  able to stay in Singapore and  to  govern\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Then  how can this  type  of  government\r\n\r\nbring  good  to the people? They have been  talking\r\n\r\nabout  doing good things for the people.

The\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of  the  people has been  much  improved\r\n\r\nunder  the P.A.P. Government. It is not enough  just\r\n\r\nto  build a few roads, put up street lamps or a  few\r\n\r\nhouses.  If  we  want  to have  a  really  socialist\r\n\r\ncountry, we should first have a united Malaya.

Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I will take the first alternative  and\r\n\r\nthe  third  alternative. With regard  to  the  third\r\n\r\nalternative,  the people of Singapore  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhat  will be the terms of this proposal.

Does it  also  mean  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be proportional representation  in  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Parliament? That is, we will have at  least\r\n\r\n25  seats in the Central Parliament? With regard  to\r\n\r\nautomatic   conversion  of   citizenship   for   all\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens and proportional  representation\r\n\r\nin  the Central Parliament, can the 624,000 citizens\r\n\r\nof  Singapore share a common political life with the\r\n\r\nother   citizens?  Can  they  also  share  a  common\r\n\r\neconomic  life with the other Federal citizens?  The\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance says yes.  He  is  trying  to\r\n\r\nconfuse and mislead the people.

Have   you\r\n\r\nforgotten  the interests of the people of Singapore?\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, we are to have  a  proper\r\n\r\ndistribution  of  land. That is  to  say,  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  and  Federal citizens can enjoy  the  same\r\n\r\nrights. But all these points were not made clear  by\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister when he moved his motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point - this is very important - is the\r\n\r\nsecond  alternative.

Furthermore, there has been no report  in\r\n\r\nthis House concerning this third alternative. We can\r\n\r\nsee  that the motion of the Prime Minister has  been\r\n\r\nmoved  in  order to mislead the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  is something abstract and intangible. Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  not  only are we ourselves confused  about\r\n\r\nthe  terms of the third alternative, but the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore are also confused. They are not  clear\r\n\r\nabout  it.  They do not know the terms  because  the\r\n\r\nCobbold  Report has not been published.

Before the\r\n\r\nmotion of the Barisan Sosialis at that time, we also\r\n\r\nissued  a  statement with regard  to  our  stand  on\r\n\r\nmerger  between  Singapore and the Federation.  This\r\n\r\nwas  made  on  the  28th of August,  1961.  In  this\r\n\r\nstatement  it was clearly and categorically  pointed\r\n\r\nout  what our stand on merger was and what the tasks\r\n\r\nahead should be. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, our policy\r\n\r\nstatement  said,  first, we should immediately  have\r\n\r\ncomplete  and genuine merger so that Singapore  will\r\n\r\nenter as a State in the Federation of Malaya on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  Penang  and Malacca. Secondly,  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould enter into confederation with the Federation.\r\n\r\nThe  form  of  the  first proposal would  have  many\r\n\r\ndifficulties. The colonialists try to highlight  the\r\n\r\nreligious and racial differences among our people in\r\n\r\norder  to  carry  on  their colonial  rule.  If  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives in the Federation can take concerted\r\n\r\naction  with us, then we can bring about a true  and\r\n\r\ngenuine merger. In this case, we will do all we  can\r\n\r\nto  look  after  the  interests  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  order that Singapore will  enter  the\r\n\r\nFederation as the twelfth State. That will mean that\r\n\r\nSingapore  becomes part and parcel of the Federation\r\n\r\nof   Malaya,   so   that  Singapore  citizens   will\r\n\r\nautomatically become Federal citizens and they  will\r\n\r\nhave  proportionate representation  in  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment in the Federation of Malaya. There should\r\n\r\nbe a general election in Singapore to let the people\r\n\r\nhave  an open decision, so that we can get a mandate\r\n\r\nfrom  the  people to bring about a true and complete\r\n\r\nmerger.  But now the Federation Government wants  to\r\n\r\nfind out from us whether we are prepared to persuade\r\n\r\nthe people to have Singapore entering the Federation\r\n\r\nas  the  twelfth State before 1963  in  a  full  and\r\n\r\ncomplete merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that was the basic stand\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan Sosialis on merger. But the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment has all along been trying to distort  our\r\n\r\ncontention and stand, through Radio P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  through the Political Bureau of: the P.A.P. in\r\n\r\ndistorting  our  stand, the  P.A.P. has  made  many\r\n\r\nmistakes. These mistakes are also contained in  the\r\n\r\nspeech  of the Prime Minister on the 25th  of  June,\r\n\r\n1961.  On  the  25th  of June, 1962,  the  Political\r\n\r\nBureau of the P.A.P. issued a statement which  reads\r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Now the P.A.P. are challenging us to put their\r\n\r\ncontention  of a complete merger for the  people  to\r\n\r\ndecide  in  the  referendum.  Is  that  their   true\r\n\r\ncontention of merger?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do they mean by this? Our true contention and\r\n\r\nstand  on merger is to allow the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nto  become citizens of the Federation. If we can put\r\n\r\nthis  into  practice, then we shall go on our  knees\r\n\r\nand  thank God. From all this talk we know that  our\r\n\r\ncontention  is  correct and is in keeping  with  the\r\n\r\ndesire of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister said\r\n\r\nearlier  on  this evening in this House  that  \"they\r\n\r\ncould  only  talk  about complete and  unconditional\r\n\r\nmerger.\"  He said this in order to avoid the  matter\r\n\r\nof  the  automatic conversion of citizenship.  As  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  fact, the Barisan Sosialis has  in  many\r\n\r\npolicy statements mentioned automatic conversion  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  The  Prime  Minister  in  his   speech\r\n\r\npointed   out  to  the  people  of  Singapore   that\r\n\r\nautomatic   conversion  of  citizenship   would   be\r\n\r\nacceptable  to  the  people of  Singapore.  Although\r\n\r\nknowing this full well, he is not going to fight for\r\n\r\nthe interest of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead he will avoid the matter of citizenship and\r\n\r\nsay  nothing about it. He only wants to foist on the\r\n\r\npeople  the  so-called  complete  and  unconditional\r\n\r\nmerger  as  a  choice. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister himself knows that the automatic conversion\r\n\r\nof  citizenship is very important to the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. But why should he sell out the  interests\r\n\r\nof  the people in Singapore? Mr Speaker. Sir,  from\r\n\r\nthese  view-points we know that the leaders  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are  trying  to distort  the  stand  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis.  Here I  would  like  to  make  a\r\n\r\nserious charge - that this behaviour of the P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nshameless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n             \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the White Paper on merger before\r\n\r\nit   was  passed  in  this  House  gave  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership  confidence.  From  the  remarks  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance a few moments ago,  it  seems\r\n\r\nthat  the  White Paper on merger is very  good,  and\r\n\r\nfrom  the  speech of the Parliamentary Secretary  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Education, we are told  that  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  on  merger is not a  sell-out  of  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the Chinese in Singapore. He also  says\r\n\r\nthat  the White Paper on merger is the most suitable\r\n\r\ntype   of   merger   that  can  meet   the   present\r\n\r\nrequirements of the people in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from all this talk we know that\r\n\r\nthe  leadership  of the P.A.P. have full  confidence\r\n\r\nand  complete faith in their White Paper on  merger.\r\n\r\nSo  the P.A.P. Government should at the present  day\r\n\r\nhand the White Paper on merger for a decision by the\r\n\r\npeople  by way of a national referendum. But in  the\r\n\r\nmotion moved by the Prime Minister, we can see  that\r\n\r\nthe leaders of the P.A.P. do not have confidence  in\r\n\r\nthe  constitutional arrangements arrived at  between\r\n\r\nthe two Governments in Singapore and the Federation.\r\n\r\nHow  is  it  that they should have lost interest  in\r\n\r\ntheir  White  Paper on merger? The facts  are  very\r\n\r\nclear.  It  is because the people of Singapore  know\r\n\r\nvery  clearly that the White Paper on merger is  not\r\n\r\nin  keeping  with their interests. So if the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  pose only one  question  on  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper on merger for a decision of the  people\r\n\r\nin  the national referendum, then I believe most  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  in  Singapore will reject  it.  If  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. should suffer such a defeat, then spiritually\r\n\r\nand morally speaking the Government have to resign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, because their White Paper on\r\n\r\nmerger  is not acceptable to the people and will  be\r\n\r\nrejected  by them, that is why the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nhave  no  guts  to refer this matter  alone  to  the\r\n\r\npeople for a decision. So instead of referring  this\r\n\r\nmatter  alone,  they  will  bring  up  two  or  more\r\n\r\nquestions  for  the decision of  the  people.  As  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  fact,  of the present alternatives,  the\r\n\r\nfirst is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintangible. As the Minister for Finance said at  the\r\n\r\nthird forum over Radio Singapore, and as reported on\r\n\r\nthe  1st  of  July, 1962, in the Sin Chew  Jit  Poh,\r\n\r\nthere are two building contractors - one is known  as\r\n\r\nComplete  Merger Company and the other is  known  as\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper on Merger Company. Now  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  on Merger Company has built a house and asks,\r\n\r\n\"Do  you  want to move into our house, the house  of\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper on Merger Company?\" But Mr Citizen\r\n\r\nhas got to find out what the Complete Merger Company\r\n\r\nhas done. Has it built any house yet?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the motion of the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  there are two alternatives. The  first  is\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper on merger, i.e. the White Paper  on\r\n\r\nMerger  Company  as suggested by  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance. According to the Minister, this White Paper\r\n\r\non  Merger Company has completed the construction of\r\n\r\na  house and it wants the citizens to move into  it.\r\n\r\nThe second is the alternative of the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\ni.e.,   in   accordance  with   the   constitutional\r\n\r\ndocuments of the Federation of Malaya, there  should\r\n\r\nbe  complete and unconditional merger as a State  on\r\n\r\nan equal basis with any of the other 11 States. That\r\n\r\nis  taken  to  mean  the Complete and  Unconditional\r\n\r\nMerger  Company  as suggested by  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance   in   a  radio  forum.  The  Complete   and\r\n\r\nUnconditional  Merger Company has  not  put  up  any\r\n\r\nhouse  and  has not drawn up any plans  to  build  a\r\n\r\nhouse.  That  is  the argument of the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Government wants to put these two\r\n\r\nalternatives to the people: (1) with a house already\r\n\r\ncompleted, and (2) No. [interruption] That  is  what\r\n\r\nyou said in the radio forum! Mr Speaker, the second\r\n\r\nalternative of the Government is to ask Mr  Citizen\r\n\r\nto  look  for  the  master of  the  Complete  Merger\r\n\r\nCompany.   So,  in  my  opinion,  this   alternative\r\n\r\nregarding  complete and unconditional merger  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  posed  to  the people for  their  selection\r\n\r\nbecause  up  to  the present day the  Government  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   have   not  consulted   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  on this matter, and there  has  been  no\r\n\r\nagreement  reached  between  them  on  this   second\r\n\r\nalternative. So how can they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nask  the people to make a choice? Now, supposing you\r\n\r\nsay  that  the people want to move into  this  house\r\n\r\nsupposed to be built by the Complete Merger Company.\r\n\r\nWhere is the house?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the question before us should be as the Minister for Finance has said, that is the house\r\n\r\nbuilt by the White Paper on Merger Company, and  The\r\n\r\npeople  should be asked whether they  want  to  move\r\n\r\ninto  this  particular house. That is  to  say,  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper on Merger should be given to the people\r\n\r\nfor a decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, finally I rise to appeal to the\r\n\r\nleaders of the Government that they should keep  the\r\n\r\npromises they have made. The Government should refer\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper  on merger to  the  people  for  a\r\n\r\ndecision  in order to convince them that the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment is a responsible Government. So I see  no\r\n\r\nreason  whatsoever why the P.A.P. Government  should\r\n\r\nforget  about  the promises they have  made  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  I hope that the Government could carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir promise and pose the White Paper on merger  to\r\n\r\nthe   people   for  a  decision  in   the   national\r\n\r\nreferendum.  They  should not run  away  from  their\r\n\r\npromise. Otherwise they are irresponsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  the debate on the motion which  has  since\r\n\r\nbeen  amended by the leader of the Barisan Sosialis,\r\n\r\nthe Member for Queenstown. I at times felt surprised\r\n\r\nwhether  this hon. Member was day-dreaming,  because\r\n\r\nsome  of  the arguments put forward in his amendment\r\n\r\nwere  that when the elections were held in Singapore\r\n\r\nin 1959 it never occurred to the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nthat  they  ever wished to merge with the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya.  His ground was that if  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore wanted to merge they would then have voted\r\n\r\nfor  the S.P.A., because the S.P.A. then had  merger\r\n\r\non  its  platform;  and yet it suffered  a  crushing\r\n\r\ndefeat. The Member for Queenstown also said that the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore had no wish whatsoever to  merge\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation of Malaya.  This  is  directly\r\n\r\ncontrary to the arguments which we often\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nheard  from  the Leader of the Barisan Sosialis.  It\r\n\r\nappeared  that the people of Singapore had  no  wish\r\n\r\nfor  a merger. That is why I thought the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown had been day-dreaming, for surely  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  possible that the Member has forgotten that one\r\n\r\nof  the items in the manifesto of the P.A.P. is  as\r\n\r\nfollows:  to strive to achieve independence  through\r\n\r\nmerger with the Federation of Malaya! This is one of\r\n\r\nthe  platforms  of  the P.A.P. which  won  them  the\r\n\r\nelection. One of the foremost planks in our platform\r\n\r\nwas  to achieve independence through merger with the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, we can see earlier today\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Queenstown, as leader of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, denying this. What does this all mean, if,\r\n\r\nin  this  matter, he is quite prepared to  deny  the\r\n\r\nfacts?  There is no doubt then that the  people  who\r\n\r\nreally  dilly-dally over this matter of  merger  are\r\n\r\nthe  people in the Barisan Sosialis. They first said\r\n\r\nthat they preferred merger on terms similar to those\r\n\r\nof  Penang and Malacca. Then they said that they had\r\n\r\nmade  a  mistake  over  this,  and  afterwards  they\r\n\r\nfurther said that their stand was that merger should\r\n\r\nbe  on  an equal basis like any one of the 11 States\r\n\r\nof  the Federation. This is no child's play. If  you\r\n\r\nare tired, you rest a while. But politics is not  as\r\n\r\neasy as that, particularly serious politics. If  you\r\n\r\nare a trishaw rider or a motor-car driver, or if you\r\n\r\nare  a  father or a teacher, and you make a  mistake\r\n\r\nwhich  endangers  you or your family,  it  does  not\r\n\r\nmatter  very  much. But if you  as  a  leader  of  a\r\n\r\npolitical  Party  make  a grave  mistake,  then  the\r\n\r\npeople   at   large   would   consequently   suffer.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in our political efforts for the good  of\r\n\r\nthe  people, we should not act like children playing\r\n\r\na game of marbles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter before us is a national matter. By\r\n\r\ndilly-dallying  and making mistakes  every  now  and\r\n\r\nthen,  how can we expect to guarantee the safety  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  entrusted to us? I feel,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the leader of the Barisan Sosialis should  not\r\n\r\nbe  like  the  mother  crab, in  the  Malay  saying,\r\n\r\nteaching  its little one to walk: She says,  \"Little\r\n\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou  should walk forward,\" when in fact she  herself\r\n\r\nwalks  sideways. The Barisan Sosialis want immediate\r\n\r\nautomatic  conversion  of  Singapore  citizens  into\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens on merger. The question was  asked\r\n\r\nwhether we would have equal status and the right  of\r\n\r\ngovernment  and so on. Various other questions  were\r\n\r\nposed  by them, most of which have escaped me.  They\r\n\r\nwant  this and they want that. But let us pause  and\r\n\r\nask  ourselves: are we prepared to accept all  this?\r\n\r\nAt  least, one of the conditions for enabling anyone\r\n\r\nto  stand as a candidate in future elections is  the\r\n\r\nquestion of language, for Malay will subsequently be\r\n\r\nregarded  and accepted as the sole language  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  There  is  the  education   policy   as\r\n\r\nembodied in the Rahman Talib Report -are we prepared\r\n\r\nto  accept  all  that? These are  the  things  which\r\n\r\nshould be clear in our minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several other problems which have to be\r\n\r\nsquarely  faced. Therefore, let us  not  ask,  \"What\r\n\r\nwill we get as a result of merger? Will we get this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  that?\", when we ourselves have not answered what\r\n\r\nwe  ourselves  are prepared to give in return.  Ever\r\n\r\nsince  the  debate on the question  of  merger  took\r\n\r\nplace, and ever since the White Paper proposals were\r\n\r\ndiscussed to date, I have never heard even once  any\r\n\r\nMember of the Barisan Sosialis answering these  very\r\n\r\npertinent  questions. They merely  raised  questions\r\n\r\nwhich are aimed at gaining them votes, such as: will\r\n\r\nwe  get  automatic citizenship rights? Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  debating this matter, we on the Government\r\n\r\nside are firm in our stand. Ever since we posed  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  the  White Paper  proposals,  we  were\r\n\r\nprepared to face the people and explain to them  the\r\n\r\nreal  contents of the White Paper proposals  and  to\r\n\r\nclarify the points raised therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
