It seems to me that this is a nice  little\r\n\r\nracket  ever  since 1953 when they were running  this\r\n\r\nChamber.  They create tradition. They  never  did  it\r\n\r\nbefore.  In  1953, they thought it was a  good  idea:\r\n\r\n\"Give ourselves more money.\" Why not? This money does\r\n\r\nnot  belong  to  them; it belongs to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> On a point of information, Sir. Prior to\r\n\r\n1953, under the Governor's Ordinance - I think that  is\r\n\r\nthe title of the Ordinance - it was the practice to pay\r\n\r\nthe  Officer  Administering the Government  half  the\r\n\r\nGovernor's  basic salary and half his own salary.  In\r\n\r\n1953, we brought our practice into line with that  of\r\n\r\nthe  rest  of the colonial dependencies and paid  the\r\n\r\nOfficer Administering the Government a sum sufficient\r\n\r\nto  bring his total emoluments up to 95 per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthe Governor's basic salary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And while the Governor is on\r\n\r\nholiday, at the same time I presume he draws his full\r\n\r\nGovernor's pay?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

If we want to give everybody money all  round,\r\n\r\nwhy  not  do  it also for the elected Ministers?  The\r\n\r\nChief  Minister goes off on holiday; the Deputy Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  gets  an  acting  pay.  The  Deputy   Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  becomes  the  Acting  Chief  Minister,  his\r\n\r\nAssistant Minister gets his acting pay and so we  can\r\n\r\nplay   this  merry-go-round,  and  at  any  one  time\r\n\r\nsomebody will get extra money.

This  is\r\n\r\none  of  the brighter moments. Sometime next year  or\r\n\r\nsometime in 1959, one lucky Malayan-born person  will\r\n\r\nsit  in  Government House. I was intrigued the  other\r\n\r\nday\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  hear  the new Governor say that he was  going  to\r\n\r\nhand  over Government House presumably with  all  the\r\n\r\ncrockery, the forks and spoons, the Royal crest,  the\r\n\r\npictures,  the  air-conditioning machines,  the  nice\r\n\r\nlawns and all the paraphernalia and patina that  make\r\n\r\nfor  the  pomp  and  glory of a colonial  government.\r\n\r\nThere  must  be  a  lot  of  heart-searching  as  the\r\n\r\nelections  draw nearer as to who is going to  be  the\r\n\r\nlucky  person.  He  will  be a  lucky  person  indeed\r\n\r\nbecause he will inherit not only the big mansion with\r\n\r\nall  the  spacious grounds but also two butlers,  two\r\n\r\nassistant  butlers, twenty domestic staff, two  cooks\r\n\r\n(one graded lower than the other) and five chauffeurs\r\n\r\n(two undoubtedly experienced ones getting a salary of $154-6A-184  and three less experienced ones  getting $114-4A-138).  That gives a measure of the  necessary\r\n\r\npomp that must surround such an important person.  As\r\n\r\nwe  take over the bureaucratic machine, we get  these\r\n\r\nfew choice places open. In the Federation it has been\r\n\r\nquite an entertaining spectacle to see people move up\r\n\r\nto  high  office  to  embassies all  over  the  world\r\n\r\nleaving very unpleasant contests to be fought out. In\r\n\r\nSingapore, it is generally agreed that whoever  wants\r\n\r\nto  become  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  must  not  be\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  politics. If he has  been  involved  in\r\n\r\npolitics, then he should be somebody who has left his\r\n\r\npolitical  past in some corner and has  made  friends\r\n\r\nall  round  ever since. What is more he must - this  is\r\n\r\nthe more serious side - be of the calibre that will  be\r\n\r\nable  to take over not only the dignity of the office\r\n\r\nbecause  the  dignity will remain,  but  the  greater\r\n\r\nresponsibility   which   it   entails   in    dealing\r\n\r\ndiplomatically and tactfully with the elected Members\r\n\r\nfrom   whom  he  must  invite  leaders  to   form   a\r\n\r\ngovernment.   In  fact,  when  we  were   in   London\r\n\r\nnegotiating this Yang di-Pertuan Negara, I could  not\r\n\r\nhelp  but think that perhaps we owe a tribute to  the\r\n\r\nex-Chief  Minister  for  this  scheme.  This  is  his\r\n\r\nbrainchild and he deserves full marks for it. We  the\r\n\r\nPAP, were not particularly concerned whether we had a\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan  Negara or a Governor-General  or  a\r\n\r\nGovernor. But other people were very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparticular  about forms particularly when  they  were\r\n\r\nout for seats in the United Nations. It was important\r\n\r\nthat the whole set-up of a sovereign nation should be\r\n\r\ncarefully stated including the head of a state.  When\r\n\r\nwe  settled it this year, I calculated the number  of\r\n\r\npossible applicants for this job. Sir, he cannot be a political because then he will be a menace.  He  will\r\n\r\nchoose  the  wrong persons to form a  government.  He\r\n\r\nwill  choose  the  wrong  Party  and  there  will  be\r\n\r\npolitical  instability.  He  cannot  be  too   deeply\r\n\r\ninvolved  in politics at present. So that writes  off\r\n\r\nall  the  present Members of this Assembly and  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  storming on election platforms. I was  left\r\n\r\neventually  with a short list of five.  If  the  five\r\n\r\ngentlemen - and I think there are only five  who  might\r\n\r\ndischarge  this duty with some distinction  and  with\r\n\r\nsome  dignity - know what is in store for the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara under the new constitution,  when  he\r\n\r\ntakes over Government House with all the crockery and\r\n\r\nall  the paraphernalia of that august domain, he will\r\n\r\nremember  that his is probably the most ticklish  job\r\n\r\never given to any functionary head of state in South-East Asia. I do not know what other political Parties\r\n\r\nhave  in  mind  for this job but, as far  as  we  are\r\n\r\nconcerned, that man requires a great deal of courage,\r\n\r\ndeep  political understanding of the South-East Asian\r\n\r\nsituation  and  the  ability to ride  a  crisis  with\r\n\r\nfirmness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M.

We have heard complaints  from  the\r\n\r\npublic  that many cases have been postponed to  dates\r\n\r\nmany  months ahead. There have been leading  articles\r\n\r\nin  the  papers  lamenting this point.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should remedy this so that all cases could\r\n\r\nbe heard in the shortest period possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another point, Sir, I notice that most of the\r\n\r\ncourts  in Singapore are situated right in the centre\r\n\r\nof  the town. There are many summonses or many  cases\r\n\r\ninvolving  people living in rural  areas  and  it  is\r\n\r\nsometimes very difficult for the rural people to know\r\n\r\nto which court they must go. I have had many cases of\r\n\r\npeople  coming  to  me to ask me where  a  particular\r\n\r\ncourt  is  situated; whether they should  go  to  the\r\n\r\ncourt right in front of the Central Police Station or\r\n\r\nto  the  one next to the City Council. In one or  two\r\n\r\ncases,  I  think  they failed to  appear  before  the\r\n\r\ncourts  not because they dared to fail to appear  but\r\n\r\nbecause  they  were  just lost.  Next  year,  in  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates,  many  district  offices  are\r\n\r\ncoming  up. At present too, there are many  community\r\n\r\ncentres situated all over Singapore. I would say that\r\n\r\nit  would be better to bring the courts to the  rural\r\n\r\nareas rather than bring the rural people to the  city\r\n\r\ncourts.  I  can  give an instance,  Sir,  where  this\r\n\r\nshould  prove  practicable. On a day when  a  hundred\r\n\r\nhawkers  are  summoned to appear before  a  court,  I\r\n\r\nthink  that in such cases, it would be better if  the\r\n\r\ncourt  is  situated in a centre that  is  nearest  to\r\n\r\ntheir place of operation rather than to get each  and\r\n\r\nevery  one of them to come right into town for  their\r\n\r\nhearings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of justice, I would like to bring to\r\n\r\nthe attention of this House the difficulty to the man\r\n\r\nin the street. Justice would be available to the rich\r\n\r\nbecause  they are in the position to pay.  For  those\r\n\r\nwho are poor with an income of less than $300 or with\r\n\r\na  total possession of less than $300. Government has\r\n\r\nstarted a free\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlegal  aid  system. But there is a  large  number  of\r\n\r\npeople who cannot sometimes seek justice. I mention a\r\n\r\nfew  instances of people who are knocked down by cars\r\n\r\nthrough  negligence  and  because  they  are  in   no\r\n\r\nposition  to  engage  a lawyer,  many  of  them  have\r\n\r\nabandoned  their claims against insurance  companies.\r\n\r\nThese are the people who suffer because they have not\r\n\r\nenough  money to seek justice and yet they  are  rich\r\n\r\nenough  to  be excluded from this free legal  aid.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  if Government is having any scheme to  assist\r\n\r\nthis  large section of the people who I think  should\r\n\r\nget justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.30 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I should inform the hon.

We decided in\r\n\r\nLondon  this year that the independence of our  local\r\n\r\njudiciary  shall  be guaranteed and  that  no  Puisne\r\n\r\nJudge of the High Court or Chief Justice who has been\r\n\r\nappointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara on the advice\r\n\r\nof  the  Prime Minister, after consultation with  the\r\n\r\nChief  Justice and the Council of Ministers,  can  be\r\n\r\nremoved  unless the matter has been referred  to  the\r\n\r\nPrivy  Council, and the Privy Council has recommended\r\n\r\nthat they should be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what gravely disturbs me is not so much the lack\r\n\r\nof  independence of the judiciary, but the fact that,\r\n\r\nbecause of the education policy in the past, there is\r\n\r\nnow a dearth of experienced and competent lawyers  to\r\n\r\ntake  over the lower rungs of the judiciary. It is  a\r\n\r\nfact  which  all  practising lawyers know,  that  the\r\n\r\nstronger  a  judge the less is the influence  on  any\r\n\r\nparticular decision of counsel appearing before  him.\r\n\r\nOne  of the most unhappy features that a lawyer would\r\n\r\nlike  to avoid seeing in our courts is where a  young\r\n\r\nand  inexperienced magistrate is buffeted between two\r\n\r\nexperienced counsels, and the fear of being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaken up on appeal by one or other of the experienced\r\n\r\ncounsels and of being torn to pieces in the appellate\r\n\r\ncourt  is  more  often  than not  a  reason  for  the\r\n\r\ninexperienced magistrate reaching a decision  on  one\r\n\r\nside or the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we welcome the fact that the Government has\r\n\r\nrecruited  people from the profession  straight  into\r\n\r\npuisne  judgeships. It is the only way to do  it, in\r\n\r\nview  not  only  of  the  shortage  of  senior  legal\r\n\r\nofficers  but also because it is a desirable practice\r\n\r\nin  itself. The difficulty of course is the  question\r\n\r\nof  emoluments. The Bar Committee has written to  the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office, I think, to have  the  salaries  of\r\n\r\njudges  revised.  Now, Sir, I am  not  in  favour  of\r\n\r\npiecemeal  adjustment  because  the  whole   of   the\r\n\r\nhierarchy will be upset if one tampers with any  part\r\n\r\nof  the  top hierarchy but it is a problem  which  we\r\n\r\nmust  face.  If  you  want to get  able,  experienced\r\n\r\nlawyers  to  give up their practice and take  over  a\r\n\r\njudgeship,  then you must be prepared to  offer  them\r\n\r\nsomething  more  than  just  the  pomp, dignity  and\r\n\r\nimportance  of  that office. How much that  something\r\n\r\nmust be has got to be taken in relation to the pay of\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara and the Speaker  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly. There was an order of protocol drawn up  by\r\n\r\nthe  Colonial Office some time this year.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  if  what  transpired is still confidential  but\r\n\r\nanyway  the Colonial Office was extremely anxious  to\r\n\r\nmaintain   the  order  of  precedence.  First,   they\r\n\r\nconceded  that  there  shall be the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  who  will not be a Colonial Office  man.  But\r\n\r\nthey insisted that immediately after the Speaker, the\r\n\r\nBritish  Commissioner  or the  High  Commissioner  or\r\n\r\nwhatever  he  will  be called shall  march  first  in\r\n\r\nprocession to indicate the importance of his  office,\r\n\r\nthat  he  holds special reserve powers and powers  of\r\n\r\nlife  and death over the constitution, etc.,  etc.  I\r\n\r\nthink the Chief Justice came in immediately after the\r\n\r\nSpeaker  or  the  Speaker came  in  after  the  Chief\r\n\r\nJustice - I  was not sure which way it was.  All  these\r\n\r\nthings  must be taken into account when  we  fix  the\r\n\r\nsalaries  of  judges.  You  cannot  have  one  person\r\n\r\ntrooping  out in front drawing $2,150 and the  person\r\n\r\ntrooping\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbehind   drawing  $3,575  otherwise  the   sense   of\r\n\r\npropriety will be greatly disrupted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to say on the judiciary is this:\r\n\r\nit  was a right decision we made in London, that  the\r\n\r\njudiciary  could  be  Malayanised.  It  was  a  right\r\n\r\ndecision that the Government took in recruiting  from\r\n\r\nthe  profession, but adjustments will have to be made\r\n\r\nas  to  the  terms and conditions for those  who  are\r\n\r\nrecruited from the profession. What we are  going  to\r\n\r\ndo  about  this shortage of trained men to take  over\r\n\r\nthe lower rungs of the judiciary is a matter which  I\r\n\r\nthink must receive very serious consideration if  the\r\n\r\nnext Minister for Justice is not to be saddled with a\r\n\r\nlot  of  incompetent magistrates whose  judgments  go\r\n\r\nconstantly  up  for appeal. It is  not  altogether  a\r\n\r\nmatter  which  can be solved just by saying  so.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of trained men - as I have said, and I keep  on\r\n\r\ncondemning  the colonial system because I think  they\r\n\r\nare  responsible for it - is so few. And the reason  is\r\n\r\nthat when the British Colonial Office discovered that\r\n\r\nlawyers  naturally  turned to politics  they  stopped\r\n\r\nscholarships  for lawyers and they gave  scholarships\r\n\r\nfor  engineers, doctors, dentists, and  anything  you\r\n\r\nlike  under  the  sun,  provided  that  you  did  not\r\n\r\ninterfere  with the political system.

The\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Malaya can only remedy this  situation\r\n\r\nin  about  six or seven years when the first recruits\r\n\r\nwill be forthcoming. Between then and now we have  to\r\n\r\nsee that the standard of our magistracy is maintained\r\n\r\nsomehow  or  the  other while  the  younger  men  are\r\n\r\ngaining  experience. I am sure that the situation  is\r\n\r\neven  more serious in the Attorney-General's Chamber.\r\n\r\nI  shudder to think what would have happened but  for\r\n\r\nthe fact that there were a few lawyers trained in the\r\n\r\nyears  before the war who are now able to assume  the\r\n\r\nhigher appointments in the departments - both legal and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njudiciary.

One must compare to a certain  extent  with\r\n\r\nthe  remuneration  of what a professional  man  would\r\n\r\nobtain  if  he  were  not in the  Government  service\r\n\r\notherwise we shall only get the second-rate  men  who\r\n\r\nwill fill the very responsible posts required for the\r\n\r\nsmooth  running  of Government.

He\r\n\r\nstated  that our local capitalists prefer  to  invest\r\n\r\ntheir  money  for a quick return in  rubber  and  tin\r\n\r\nrather  than to invest it on a long-term  basis.  Now\r\n\r\ncoming  to the subject of judiciary, the position  is\r\n\r\nsomewhat peculiar alike. We heard both sides of  this\r\n\r\nHouse say that we should obtain more experienced  men\r\n\r\nto  fill  the senior posts in the judiciary  but  one\r\n\r\ncannot deny the fact that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namongst  the private lawyers there are many brilliant\r\n\r\nlegal  professional men. Why they do not come forward\r\n\r\nto  join this most important service is because  they\r\n\r\nare  attracted by the bigger income that they can get\r\n\r\nfrom  their private practice. Therefore,  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nremind  this  House,  especially the  Government,  to\r\n\r\nthink  of  a  way  to control the professional  legal\r\n\r\ncharges which are sometimes fantastically high and to\r\n\r\nencourage  such people to join the judiciary  instead\r\n\r\nof  making  a quick million dollars from their  legal\r\n\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, in view of what the Hon. the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General  said,  I  think   that   I   should\r\n\r\nelaborate further on what I mean by the weaknesses of\r\n\r\nour  young  magistracy. There are  a  few  exceptions\r\n\r\nwhich  I  myself  have encountered.  They  are  young\r\n\r\npeople  having just been called to the Bar, who  have\r\n\r\nlearned  very quickly how to reach the  issues  in  a\r\n\r\nparticular case and how at the same time to  maintain\r\n\r\nthe dignity of the magistrate in his court and not to\r\n\r\ndescend to the dust and heat of the arena. But I give\r\n\r\nthis by way of illustration. I had to appear before a\r\n\r\nyoung  magistrate, conscientious but  young,  and  we\r\n\r\nspent the whole afternoon on all kinds of side issues\r\n\r\nbecause  he was so careful in not wanting to  make  a\r\n\r\nmistake   that   he   investigated   every   possible\r\n\r\nalternative up every possible alley. We came  to  the\r\n\r\nright  conclusion in the end but after having  wasted\r\n\r\nthe whole afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, there are two ways to solve this. One,\r\n\r\nsay,  \"All  right,  it must be so until  they  gather\r\n\r\nexperience of what to do.\" The other is to find  some\r\n\r\ninterim solution whereby experienced men are  put  in\r\n\r\nalmost every other court to see that the cases  where\r\n\r\ndifficulties are likely to arise are put  before  the\r\n\r\nexperienced  magistrates. It is at  the  moment  done\r\n\r\npurely  on  the basis of seniority. Certain  criminal\r\n\r\ndistrict courts have an order or precedence according\r\n\r\nto  seniority  in  the service  and  except  in  very\r\n\r\nexceptional cases, it is really the luck of the  draw\r\n\r\nbefore which magistrate a case appears. My suggestion\r\n\r\nfor an interim solution has two aspects. One, somehow\r\n\r\nget your more experienced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmen  to staff every other court if they cannot  staff\r\n\r\nevery  court. Two, make sure that, in the  fixing  of\r\n\r\nthe  cases  where  difficulties are likely  to  arise\r\n\r\neither in involved facts or in involved laws, a  case\r\n\r\nis  put before an experienced man. Otherwise time  is\r\n\r\nwasted  not  only in the trial before the  magistrate\r\n\r\nbut  in the chances of the appeal before an appellate\r\n\r\ntribunal. This is a problem of which one could take a\r\n\r\nfatalistic view and say, \"Well, anyway, leave it till\r\n\r\nfive  or  ten years and the magistrates will  acquire\r\n\r\nexperience  and the young Counsels in  the  Attorney-General's Chambers have been knocking about enough in\r\n\r\nthe  High  Court to gather experience to become  good\r\n\r\njudges.\"   But,   in   the   meantime,   a   lot   of\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction is created both with  those  who  are\r\n\r\nbeing prosecuted and with those who are litigating in\r\n\r\nthe  courts and with members of the profession. There\r\n\r\nare  certain judges before whom counsels  shudder  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  case. That is a fact because we know that  a\r\n\r\nmatter which would take one hour before an ordinarily\r\n\r\ncompetent  man  would take a whole  day  if  it  goes\r\n\r\nbefore  certain persons. It is an open secret in  the\r\n\r\nprofession and the Attorney-General and his  officers\r\n\r\nmust  be fully aware of it. Well, such people  should\r\n\r\nnot  be put on the Bench. We had one case-I think the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General  is fully aware  of  the  particular\r\n\r\ncase-where  he did not consider the man competent  or\r\n\r\ndid  not consider the man suitable and he was  pushed\r\n\r\nout to be a magistrate or a civil district judge. The\r\n\r\nresult  was  that every case that appears before  him\r\n\r\ntakes  three  times  as  long as  it  normally  would\r\n\r\nwhether  or not it reaches the correct conclusion  in\r\n\r\nthe  end,  and this is a matter of great  importance.\r\n\r\nThe  Attorney-General  and  his  officers  cannot  be\r\n\r\nunaware of what is open gossip at the Bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have not sought to\r\n\r\ninterrupt the hon. Member but I feel that some of the\r\n\r\nthings be has said have come near to contravening, if\r\n\r\nnot  the  letter,  the spirit of our Standing  Orders\r\n\r\nand,  as  I will not run into the danger of following\r\n\r\nhim, I do not propose to reply in any detail\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  I would say this that those responsible for  the\r\n\r\nselection of officers of the legal, service and those\r\n\r\nresponsible for the administration of our courts  are\r\n\r\nfully  aware  of the difficulties that confront  them\r\n\r\nand   are   doing   their  best  to  overcome   those\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  We cannot have a magistracy  in  which\r\n\r\nlitigants can pick and choose their judges and  while\r\n\r\nat  first  sight this avoidance of the \"luck  of  the\r\n\r\ndraw\"  suggestion may be attractive, it is  one  that\r\n\r\nwill  not work. We cannot have one magistrate fit  to\r\n\r\ndeal with one type of case and one magistrate fit  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with another. To allow that is to admit  defeat\r\n\r\nand  we  are not defeated.

The  Council  has\r\n\r\nbeen  set up to look after the affairs of the  Colony\r\n\r\nand  the  Ministers on it are expected to  remain  on\r\n\r\nduty  most  of  the  time,  and  to  incur  as  small\r\n\r\nexpenditure  as  possible  for  the  benefit  of  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers. But look at subhead 2,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nitem  (6),  Telegrams, on page 38 of  the  Estimates.\r\n\r\nThis year, telegrams cost $48,000. Detailed estimated\r\n\r\nexpenditure  for 1958 under subhead 2 is  not  given,\r\n\r\nbut the total is put down as $63,350, out of a total.\r\n\r\nof $161,970 for the head. Is it expected that $48,000\r\n\r\nwill again be spent on telegrams?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telegrams are needed mostly only when Ministers are\r\n\r\naway.  No explanation has been given but I think  the\r\n\r\ncost  of telegrams is included in the subhead  total.\r\n\r\nWe  have  seen that not one, two, or three, but  four\r\n\r\nMinisters  are away from the Colony at one time.  How\r\n\r\nis Government run in this way? Of course we know that\r\n\r\nthere  are the Permanent Secretaries but is  it  wise\r\n\r\nthat  four Ministers should be away at a time?  Their\r\n\r\nduty  is  to  run the administration. When  they  are\r\n\r\naway,  the heaviest expenditure must be on telegrams,\r\n\r\nto give or take instructions or advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to see Ministers travel less and\r\n\r\nso less money is spent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I am afraid I cannot agree with my friend\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member for Telok Ayer that the provision for\r\n\r\nthe  Council of Ministers is extravagant. There is  a\r\n\r\nhigh-powered  secretariat dealing with a  very  great\r\n\r\nvolume of business and all the provision for staff is\r\n\r\nrequired.  If it were not provided, I am  afraid  the\r\n\r\nsecretariat  would not function as  successfully  and\r\n\r\nefficiently as it does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of recurrent expenditure, I think\r\n\r\nthe  Member  will see, if he examines the  Estimates,\r\n\r\nthat the amount provided for services other than  air\r\n\r\nmail  charges and telegrams is very small  indeed.  I\r\n\r\nthink   the  provision  for  air  mail  charges   for\r\n\r\ndiplomatic   bags   explains   itself.   As   regards\r\n\r\ntelegrams, I think the Member believes the  provision\r\n\r\nis  only  in  connection with telegrams sent  to  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  while  they  are actually  away  from  the\r\n\r\nColony.  That is not the case, Sir. A certain  amount\r\n\r\nof  expenditure is incurred on telegrams to Ministers\r\n\r\nwhen  they  attend overseas conferences  such  as  on\r\n\r\nconstitutional  matters, but the  vast  bulk  of  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure  under this item is on  ordinary  routine\r\n\r\ntelegrams between this territory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the  Colonial Office and other governments.

At the time  the\r\n\r\ndelegates    went   to   London   for   the    second\r\n\r\nconstitutional  talks, it was anticipated  that  they\r\n\r\nwould be back within a certain period.

So far as  I  am\r\n\r\naware,  the P.S.C. has been doing its job but I  want\r\n\r\nto  draw its attention to a few points, especially to\r\n\r\nthe   fact   that  it  is  an  entirely   independent\r\n\r\ncommission, independent of Government interference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that in certain cases where Government likes\r\n\r\nto  fill a post, there have been manoeuvres. It  will\r\n\r\nspecifically  require a certain qualification  for  a\r\n\r\npost,  let  us  say requirement (a). If an  applicant\r\n\r\nholds  not only the qualification specified  in  (a),\r\n\r\nbut   has   further  qualifications  (b)   and   (c),\r\n\r\nGovernment  may  be in the habit of saying,  \"No,  we\r\n\r\njust   require  one  qualification\",  that  is   that\r\n\r\nspecified  in  (a). I would say that  that  would  be\r\n\r\npossible in, say, a simple, hypothetical case of  the\r\n\r\nmedical  services.  We will say  one  person  may  be\r\n\r\nspecifically qualified in health while another has  a\r\n\r\ndegree  which only covers health, yet Government  may\r\n\r\nsay, \"We want the second qualification\", and that  is\r\n\r\nput down as the requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Government always has another idea - of\r\n\r\nputting a person on to acting capacities and then\r\n\r\nclaiming that he has the necessary experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt the Public Service Commission is an\r\n\r\nindependent  body but it has to consider  suggestions\r\n\r\nand  recommendations from all sides.

Voters\r\n\r\nthereby  place  confidence in their elected  Members,\r\n\r\nthat they will safeguard their interests properly  in\r\n\r\nevery respect. It is an honour to be a Minister,  and\r\n\r\nto be Chief Minister is a very high honour. Ministers\r\n\r\nhave  to  live up to it. In other countries, salaries\r\n\r\nof  Ministers  are nominal. I am not here  discussing\r\n\r\nthe  scale of salaries which has been already  fixed,\r\n\r\nthough what happens in future I do not know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this case also, I must draw the attention of\r\n\r\nmy  good friend, the Hon. the Chief Minister, to  the\r\n\r\nnecessity  to restrict travel and so on.  It  may  be\r\n\r\nvery necessary sometimes for him to travel, but there\r\n\r\nare  times  when  such travel  can  be  left  to  the\r\n\r\nofficials  who  carry  out the policy  of  Ministers.\r\n\r\nReally the officials require experience and they  are\r\n\r\nthere more or less permanently while Ministers change\r\n\r\nevery  one,  two,  three or four years  according  to\r\n\r\npolitical  conditions. Here I might very respectfully\r\n\r\nand,  if  I  may say so, as a friend, draw the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister's attention to his journeys to Geneva or New\r\n\r\nDelhi,  journeys which could have been made by  heads\r\n\r\nof  department. That would have saved expenditure and\r\n\r\nalso given experience of conferences to not one,  but\r\n\r\ntwo officials if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter I would refer to is entertainment\r\n\r\nexpenses,   subhead  4,  page  48.  In  a  democratic\r\n\r\ngovernment, the Chief Minister is the chief person, I\r\n\r\ndo  admit, to entertain or show respect to  heads  of\r\n\r\nvarious  other countries passing through.  We  are  a\r\n\r\nvery  small  colony  compared  with  the  big  states\r\n\r\nsurrounding  us;  so although we  have  got  to  show\r\n\r\nrespect  to  visitors, we should do that  in  a  very\r\n\r\neconomical way. Singapore is mainly a stopping  place\r\n\r\nen  route  to  Kuala Lumpur for airplane services  or\r\n\r\nsteamers,  and visitors passing through Singapore  do\r\n\r\nlike  to  pay  courtesy calls on the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nalthough  their destination is really the Federation,\r\n\r\nwhich is an independent country. We can therefore  be\r\n\r\neconomical - instead of dinner, we can invite  visitors\r\n\r\nto tea. That will save expense. Or give a lunch. Only\r\n\r\nwhen very necessary or essential do we give a dinner,\r\n\r\nnot otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another head of the state, the\r\n\r\nGovernor.  He  should share his part of entertaining,\r\n\r\nso  expenses  can then be less and we can  thus  save\r\n\r\nsome money for the sake of the colony taxpayers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just passing these remarks in a friendly way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indeed\r\n\r\nvery  touched  by  the friendly attitude  of  my  old\r\n\r\nfriend,  the  hon.

He  said  that,  in  his  view,  it  was  not\r\n\r\nnecessary for the Minister to attend such conferences\r\n\r\nand   that  they  should  be  attended  by  permanent\r\n\r\nofficials.  These  two conferences were  attended  by\r\n\r\nMinisters of the participating countries to speak  on\r\n\r\nthe policies of their governments, and I attended  as\r\n\r\nthe relevant Minister representing Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member then touched on the entertainment\r\n\r\nexpenses vote of $10,000.

If it is to  be\r\n\r\nlimited  to  superscale  G officers,  the  choice  is\r\n\r\nthereby greatly limited; but if it were to be open to\r\n\r\ntime-scale  officers with an allowance of  $200,  the\r\n\r\nfield is greater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far three officers have been working as Secretary\r\n\r\nin  my  Ministry  but not one of them  has  yet  been\r\n\r\nplaced  on superscale G.

But  if he is a time-scale officer, no  matter\r\n\r\nwhat his salary is, we will now give him an allowance\r\n\r\nof  $200, which in effect means that he will get more\r\n\r\nthan if he were to come into a superscale G post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The day it was announced in the Press, all\r\n\r\nthe  cards which were to be posted to electors on the\r\n\r\nRegister  were,  according to the Returning  Officer,\r\n\r\nalready  prepared or almost completed, and to  change\r\n\r\nany  polling  station  would mean  re-addressing  all\r\n\r\nthose  cards.  For that reason, it was impossible  to\r\n\r\nmake any alteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Returning Officer, or the Chief Secretary on\r\n\r\nhis behalf, had given prior information to candidates\r\n\r\nor to political\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParties   of  the  arrangements  that  he  was   then\r\n\r\ncontemplating, surely it would have been possible for\r\n\r\nall  the  political  Parties and candidates  to  have\r\n\r\nsuggested   alternative  arrangements  in  particular\r\n\r\ncases.  For instance, one centre in what was formerly\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  and is now Kreta Ayer,  in  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  elections,  will not be voting  within  that\r\n\r\narea  but  will  go off to the Malay School  in  Park\r\n\r\nRoad,   completely  outside  the  area   in   another\r\n\r\nconstituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested that this has not taken place\r\n\r\nin  previous elections.

This is\r\n\r\nno  aspersion  on the Returning Officer,  but  if  he\r\n\r\nhimself   or   his   staff  could  not   find   other\r\n\r\narrangements, we might have been able to  suggest  to\r\n\r\nhim  other facilities available in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nBut  by  the time we knew about the need for it,  the\r\n\r\nthing  was  too  late,  the  whole  matter  had  been\r\n\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in cases of\r\n\r\npolling stations I think the principle should be that\r\n\r\nmaximum convenience should be given to the voters and\r\n\r\nnot  to the returning officers concerned. I quote one\r\n\r\ninstance,  Sir, In  the Boon  Teck  Road  area,  the\r\n\r\npolling   station  is  sited  near  the  main   road - Balestier   Road - where  there   is   a   Blue   Cross\r\n\r\nheadquarters. The voters, however, live right  inside\r\n\r\nBoon  Teck  Road, in a large number of  houses.  They\r\n\r\nwill  have to go through a stretch of road  which  is\r\n\r\nalmost  impassable. If the weather is  bad,  I  think\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  a chance of vehicles  bogging  down.\r\n\r\nInstead of giving a greater measure of convenience to\r\n\r\nthe people inside the road to go to a polling station\r\n\r\nin  the  village, all the thousands who want to  vote\r\n\r\nwill have to pass through that bad stretch of road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government may say that there is no alternative site\r\n\r\nbut  I know that those who know of the siting of that\r\n\r\npolling  station did go to the Government  department\r\n\r\nconcerned and offer an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalternative site right inside the village, but that\r\n\r\nwas not considered.

On the face of it, it would appear that  the\r\n\r\ngrading of these two posts may not be correct, but  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  grading is all right.  Experience  in  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  for  the  last  two  years  has  shown   it\r\n\r\ndesirable  that  there should be a  rearrangement  of\r\n\r\nduties  within the branches of the Chief  Secretary's\r\n\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now proposed to bring under one branch,\r\n\r\ncontrol  of internal security and intelligence,  home\r\n\r\naffairs and that part of external affairs which falls\r\n\r\nwithin my Ministry. The post of Secretary for Chinese\r\n\r\nAffairs has been abolished and the duties of his post\r\n\r\nwill  be  performed by the head of the new branch  as\r\n\r\nmentioned,  i.e. the Secretary for Home and  External\r\n\r\nAffairs.  The  intention is, Sir,  that  although  it\r\n\r\nwould appear that the Secretary for Home and External\r\n\r\nAffairs would have a bigger staff and that the  other\r\n\r\nsections -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> He has a bigger\r\n\r\nstaff; there is no \"appearing\" about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> I am sorry, I should have said he has a\r\n\r\nbigger  staff.

This post of Home and External Affairs  is\r\n\r\nconsidered to be that of a Deputy Secretary, like the\r\n\r\nposts of Deputy Secretaries in other Ministries which\r\n\r\nis  also graded E, for example Deputy Secretaries  in\r\n\r\nthe Ministries of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal  Government, Lands and Housing, and of Commerce\r\n\r\nand  Industry.

This  does\r\n\r\nindicate to me that the Singapore Government has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  doing  its job for the people here. Perhaps  it\r\n\r\nhas never put the case properly to the Government  of\r\n\r\nthe    Federation.   If   there   has   been   proper\r\n\r\nunderstanding, then we would expect that  there  will\r\n\r\nnot only be no clamp, but real\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfreedom  of travel between the two countries all  the\r\n\r\ntime,   a  thing  which  should  be  encouraged   and\r\n\r\nestablished.  Furthermore, we  would  expect  greater\r\n\r\neconomic co-operation in all matters concerning trade\r\n\r\nand allied matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as we see it, the Singapore Government seems\r\n\r\nnot  to  be in a position to assist progress in  this\r\n\r\ndirection.  If  it  fails in this duty  of  promoting\r\n\r\ngreater  understanding between the  two  territories,\r\n\r\nresulting  in a blockade of the Causeway and  greater\r\n\r\ndifferences  in  economic  policies,  it  will  bring\r\n\r\nhardship not only to the people of Singapore but also\r\n\r\nto  the  Federation as a whole. This question  is  of\r\n\r\nparamount  importance and we expect our Ministers  to\r\n\r\nexert their utmost in this direction. If they fail to\r\n\r\ndo  that, then I think Singapore will suffer by their\r\n\r\nacts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this heading again, Sir - Home and External\r\n\r\nAffairs - I   would  like  to  raise   another   point,\r\n\r\ncitizenship  registration. At present  we  have  many\r\n\r\nclasses  of  people being registered. Those  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore automatically are registered as citizens of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  There are others born outside  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe  aliens. Aliens who have lived here for the  last\r\n\r\neight years are eligible to be registered as citizens\r\n\r\nby  making  a  simple declaration. All they  have  to\r\n\r\nproduce  is  their identity cards showing  that  they\r\n\r\nhave  been in Singapore for that period and not  been\r\n\r\naway  for more than six months. This class of  people\r\n\r\nwill  now be protected. In the case of those born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  who  can  produce birth  certificates  and\r\n\r\nestablish  that  those certificates belong  to  them,\r\n\r\nthere will be no difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am going to talk about a class of people born\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, who declare that they were born  here,\r\n\r\nbut  who  have no birth certificates. In the days  of\r\n\r\nlong  ago - 30,  40 or 50 years ago - births  might  not\r\n\r\nhave  been  reported, or reported but the  dates  and\r\n\r\nplaces might be forgotten; there is no possibility of\r\n\r\nsuch citizens being able to show proof that they were\r\n\r\nborn  here.  Under  the present registration  system,\r\n\r\nthey  cannot register as citizens. On their  identity\r\n\r\ncards it is stated that they are born in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore,  but  when it comes to  proving  it,  they\r\n\r\ncannot do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will be the position of these people? If we\r\n\r\nrequire proof, then I am afraid that they will suffer\r\n\r\nand  be placed in an inferior position compared  with\r\n\r\naliens   who   have  made  declarations  and   become\r\n\r\ncitizens. Aliens can swear an oath of allegiance  and\r\n\r\nbecome citizens, but the people I am referring to are\r\n\r\nnot   allowed   to  swear  the  oath  to   take   out\r\n\r\ncitizenship. Unless the Government is willing to take\r\n\r\nthe  identity card as proof, people in this  category\r\n\r\nwill be placed in a very awkward position; and later,\r\n\r\nwhen   it  comes  to  travel  facilities  and   other\r\n\r\nbenefits, they may be left in the lurch - in a position\r\n\r\nfar worse than aliens who acquired citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to speak on external affairs, Head  8.  I\r\n\r\nwonder whether the present Government has weighed the\r\n\r\ngenuine  feelings  of the people of Singapore, their\r\n\r\nkeenness  about the coming Afro-Asian  Conference  in\r\n\r\nCairo.  If  Press reports are correct, the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  is prepared to send a delegation  to  the\r\n\r\nmeeting. The Singapore Government should give a clear\r\n\r\nstatement whether it is also prepared to do so or  to\r\n\r\njoin the Federation in sending a delegation to attend\r\n\r\nthis most significant conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk about home affairs. As one who\r\n\r\nhas carefully examined the past administration of the\r\n\r\nGovernment I can say that at least three evil  things\r\n\r\nhave  not  been  lessened. The first is  gambling.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  how  many  kinds  of gambling  now  exist  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  especially illegal lotteries? The  famous\r\n\r\nban-ji plo is in operation; and chap ji ki, operating\r\n\r\nday  and night, is sucking the blood of the poor  and\r\n\r\nthe low income group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authorities can answer that at present there is\r\n\r\na  loophole in our laws and we cannot prosecute these\r\n\r\noperators.  Sir,  I  wish the Government  would  take\r\n\r\nimmediate  steps  to  stop this widespread  gambling,\r\n\r\nespecially  illegal lotteries. It can  ascertain  how\r\n\r\nwidespread\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  repercussions  are  from  the  hawkers,   taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  and market stallholders - how much  of  their\r\n\r\nincome  is  affected in this widespread  gambling.  I\r\n\r\nwonder what the authorities in charge of home affairs\r\n\r\nwill do about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is gangsters. It is also known,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  gangsters  now  threaten  not  only   the\r\n\r\nmillionaires  but  also  the  students  and  hawkers.\r\n\r\nPolitics  are  also involved. Political Parties  have\r\n\r\nrelied  on  gangsters  and I wonder  what  preventive\r\n\r\nmeasures  have  been taken by the  Chief  Secretary's\r\n\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is the Banishment Ordinance. I\r\n\r\nwonder   how  much  value  still  remains   in   this\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  used  to  punish and  banish  undesirable\r\n\r\ncharacters.  In the past we might have faith  in  the\r\n\r\nintegrity   or  wisdom  of  Government  in  banishing\r\n\r\ngangsters  or  undesirable characters; but  when  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance is used to banish a person like Dr  Chuang\r\n\r\nChu  Lin, the people of Singapore begin to doubt. Dr\r\n\r\nChuang  is  such a well-known educationist  connected\r\n\r\nwith  Chinese  education for so long,  and  everybody\r\n\r\nknows  that  he is not an undesirable character;  any\r\n\r\ncitizen  will  be  very willing to uphold  him  as  a\r\n\r\nlawful and loyal citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore take this opportunity to suggest to\r\n\r\nthe  Government  that it should reconsider  repealing\r\n\r\nthe   Banishment  Ordinance  and  review   cases   of\r\n\r\nbanishment  including that of Dr Chuang.  This  will\r\n\r\ngive   back   confidence  to  the   public   in   the\r\n\r\nadministration  and  make them  feel  that  there  is\r\n\r\nstability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere have been remarks regarding external affairs. I\r\n\r\njust  want  to  ask: What powers have we  as  far  as\r\n\r\nexternal affairs are concerned? We, as a colony, have\r\n\r\nnothing to do with this question of external affairs.\r\n\r\nOf  course, we politicians should keep our  eyes  and\r\n\r\nears  open,  but we have no powers under the  present\r\n\r\nconstitution, nor have we under the new constitution.\r\n\r\nThe  British Government has kept them. Of course,  we\r\n\r\nwill  have  internal self-government. That means  you\r\n\r\nmanage your own affairs in your own little city,  and\r\n\r\nrun it like good boys, or you do not get this also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will have all elected Assemblymen under the\r\n\r\nnew constitution. We will have the high-sounding name\r\n\r\nof  Prime  Minister and, instead of the Governor,  we\r\n\r\nwill  have  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara.  These  are\r\n\r\nchanges  in names only but we have not got  the  real\r\n\r\nsubstance at all with us. We have no say in  external\r\n\r\naffairs.  I  doubt whether we will have any  say  for\r\n\r\nsome time to come in the future.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, reference has been made to the Federation. The\r\n\r\nFederation  is  an  independent country.  It  has  to\r\n\r\npreserve   its  own  independence.  I   have   always\r\n\r\nrefrained from talking about the Federation  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly for the simple reason that, because  of  our\r\n\r\neconomic  position, nothing should be said which  may\r\n\r\ndisplease the Federation. The Chief Minister seems to\r\n\r\nlove entering into marriages and then annulling them.\r\n\r\nSir, this is a definite announcement of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3051</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  policy  by the Federation Government.  Such  a\r\n\r\nmarriage,  if it comes, will find both the bride  and\r\n\r\nbridegroom  old. Sir, what I would suggest  is  that,\r\n\r\ninstead of talking about all this, we should  try  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  harmonious  relations with  the  Federation\r\n\r\nbecause of our economic dependence on them. We  have,\r\n\r\nas  I  said, no say in external affairs, and it seems\r\n\r\nto  me that this colony will be kept as it is as long\r\n\r\nas  is  possible, primarily now for the interests  of\r\n\r\nAustralia  and  New  Zealand. In our  own  interests,\r\n\r\ntherefore, I would like to tell my Singapore  friends\r\n\r\nto  unite and try to get maximum powers as time  goes\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Dr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  under  this  particular  item  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  have touched on certain  points  which  I\r\n\r\nfeel  require explanations. One hon. Member says that\r\n\r\nwe  have  no power over external affairs. It is  true\r\n\r\nthat even under the new constitution we have no power\r\n\r\nover  external affairs other than trade and  cultural\r\n\r\nrelations. But it does not mean that, because  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  that  power, we should  not  have  in  our\r\n\r\nadministration  an officer whose special  job  is  to\r\n\r\nlook  after this side of things. It is necessary that\r\n\r\nwe  should have such an officer so that he  can  keep\r\n\r\nSingapore  informed  of the day-to-day  goings-on  in\r\n\r\nmatters of external affairs. While it is true,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave  admitted, that we have no power  over  external\r\n\r\naffairs,  yet  the  Council  of  Ministers  has  been\r\n\r\nbrought  in very closely in such matters.  Our  views\r\n\r\nhave been sought and they have always been respected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Member brought in the question of\r\n\r\nregistration of citizenship in so far as  people  who\r\n\r\nare  local  born are concerned. I am  sure  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  is aware that, in regard to people  who  were\r\n\r\nborn in Singapore, no registration is necessary.

But one must  not  forget\r\n\r\nthat it is not only what the Government does and what\r\n\r\nthe  Government says that counts in our relationship.\r\n\r\nIt  is  what  the people of Singapore do  and  events\r\n\r\nhappening  in  Singapore that have an impact  on  the\r\n\r\nrelationship that we have built up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nafraid  I  am not satisfied with the answer given  by\r\n\r\nthe   Hon. the  Chief  Minister  regarding  external\r\n\r\naffairs.  This morning I raised the question  whether\r\n\r\nthe  Labour  Front  Coalition  Government  would   be\r\n\r\nprepared  to send a delegation to attend  the  coming\r\n\r\nAfro-Asian Conference to be held in Cairo. Of course,\r\n\r\nwe  know  very well that external affairs even  under\r\n\r\nthe  future constitution will remain in the hands  of\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom. But since the  Hon, the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister has said that the Council of Ministers keeps\r\n\r\nin  close touch with external affairs and its opinion\r\n\r\nis  sought  and  respected, may I  therefore  enquire\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Labour Front Coalition Government  will\r\n\r\nagree  with  me that it is the strong desire  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore that we should send a delegation\r\n\r\nto, or join the Federation at least as an observer to\r\n\r\nattend, the Afro-Asian Conference to be held in Cairo\r\n\r\nin  order to demonstrate the true spirit of the Afro-Asian nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

I have already explained the reasons for\r\n\r\nreorganisation of these posts.

In this respect, I think\r\n\r\nif  Government  can  enumerate  to  us  what  benefit\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  derived from such a  relationship,  I\r\n\r\nshall be very happy indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of citizenship registration, I am\r\n\r\nafraid,  Sir, that the Chief Minister has missed  the\r\n\r\npoint entirely. I am not disputing that those born in\r\n\r\nSingapore need not register. Everybody knows that.  I\r\n\r\nam  only asking what the Government's policy is  with\r\n\r\nregard  to those who were born in Singapore,  but  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  documentary  evidence  to  prove  it.  For\r\n\r\nexample, a person born 40 years ago in Singapore  may\r\n\r\nnot  have a birth certificate, or a person might have\r\n\r\nreported his birth but has forgotten his date and  so\r\n\r\non.  Would the Government be satisfied in such  cases\r\n\r\nto  accept  as  true  evidence  the  declarations  as\r\n\r\ncontained in the Identity Cards or declarations  made\r\n\r\nby  way  of  statutory declarations? I  mention  this\r\n\r\nbecause if Government does not allow this, then  this\r\n\r\nclass of people will later on be worse off than those\r\n\r\nwho  are aliens registering for Singapore citizenship\r\n\r\nnow, when it come to travel facilities, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  says  I have misunderstood him.

I\r\n\r\nquite  agree that anybody whose identity  card  shows\r\n\r\nthat he is Singapore born is automatically placed  on\r\n\r\nthe  electoral  rolls, but the question  of  becoming\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens  does  not  only  touch  on   the\r\n\r\nquestion  of voting or to be voted into power.  There\r\n\r\nare  a  lot of complications attached to the question\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  citizenship  when  applying   for   a\r\n\r\npassport.

For  the  present  purpose  of  having  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  election to bring the new constitution  into\r\n\r\nforce,   the  Singapore  Citizenship  Ordinance   was\r\n\r\nbrought into being. Between now and until the  coming\r\n\r\ninto  force of the new constitution, that citizenship\r\n\r\nhas only local currency. It has no currency outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as an application for a British passport is\r\n\r\nconcerned, at the present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime  it is necessary for an applicant to give  proof\r\n\r\nof  birth.

Just\r\n\r\nto give an illustration, Sir. A man was born 40 years\r\n\r\nago,   the   hon.  Member  said.  He  has  no   birth\r\n\r\ncertificate because his parents did not register  his\r\n\r\nbirth  or because he is not aware whether his parents\r\n\r\nhad or had not registered his birth.

The salary which we have provided  for  the\r\n\r\nexpert has been based upon our previous experience in\r\n\r\ntrying  to  obtain the services of such  an  officer.\r\n\r\nThere  is a heavy demand in other parts of the  world\r\n\r\nfor  the services of specialist officers, and we  can\r\n\r\nonly hope to get an expert if we are prepared to  pay\r\n\r\nwhat  he  can demand elsewhere. The salary  which  he\r\n\r\nwill  be  paid, which you will see in the  Estimates,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  quite  high.

Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nI  am  informed  by the Staff Side of the  Government\r\n\r\nWhitley   Council   that  the  Government   side   is\r\n\r\ncirculating a proposal to have further consolidations\r\n\r\nof  temporary allowances into basic salary, and  then\r\n\r\nhaving  the  Public Service Commission Ordinance  and\r\n\r\nthe  European  Officers Abolition  Terms  Ordinance - I\r\n\r\nhave  forgotten the exact title of it,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   but   it   is  the  Ordinance  providing   for\r\n\r\ncompensation  for  abolition  of  European  officers'\r\n\r\nposts - incorporated in an Order in Council. I have not\r\n\r\nseen  the  circular. In fact, this matter was  raised\r\n\r\nwith me at a very late stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go into it in detail, I would like to\r\n\r\nstate, as a matter of principle, that when we went to\r\n\r\nLondon this year we agreed on certain things. One  of\r\n\r\nthe things we agreed on was that the constitution and\r\n\r\nits   draft   would  be  discussed  by  the   Parties\r\n\r\nrepresented on the delegation before any changes were\r\n\r\nintroduced.  And  if  the  proposal  which   I   have\r\n\r\nmentioned  just now is gone through, then  what  will\r\n\r\nhappen is that no government in Singapore will be  in\r\n\r\na  position to make any alterations to the wage scale\r\n\r\nof  government  servants. If this is true,  I  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narmadillo  complex.

A reduction has been  imposed  in\r\n\r\nview  of  the difficult staffing position which  does\r\n\r\nnot permit of many administrative officers being sent\r\n\r\nfor  training.  In  1957, 28 administrative  officers\r\n\r\nwere  sent for training, but in 1958 the number  will\r\n\r\nbe  very  much less. This particular item is  not  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  overseas training.

In item (14) there  are  20\r\n\r\nSupernumerary Executive officer posts being  created.\r\n\r\nThe  whole purpose of the Executive service, we  were\r\n\r\ninformed,  was that it would economise on the  number\r\n\r\nof   officers  required.

We may decide  to\r\n\r\nrepeat  it.  I  do not think the number  of  officers\r\n\r\nunder  this  scheme  in any way  conflicts  with  the\r\n\r\nnumber    of    Executive   officer   (Supernumerary)\r\n\r\nposts - twenty. These posts in the Establishment Office\r\n\r\nare  provided in the Estimates as a pool for training\r\n\r\nfor  special  duties and as a reserve for overlapping\r\n\r\nduties in cases of postings and so forth. This scheme\r\n\r\nis  being  formulated  for the training  of  officers\r\n\r\nappointed   to   the  Executive   service   and   was\r\n\r\nrecommended  by the Executive Service  Joint  Council\r\n\r\nWorking  Committee consisting of the Staff  Side  and\r\n\r\nOfficial   Side  representatives.  As  I  say,   this\r\n\r\nprovision also covers cases of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecondment  of  officers for work on commissions  and\r\n\r\ncommittees for which there are no established  posts,\r\n\r\nand  it  will also provide for officers  who  may  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to  assist in emergency arrangements  like,\r\n\r\nfor  instance,  the registration of citizens.  Again,\r\n\r\nSir, as I have mentioned a little while ago, when  it\r\n\r\ncomes  to  the  question of overlapping duties,  this\r\n\r\nonly  occurs when it is necessary to effect a  change\r\n\r\nin the holder of an office. It is often necessary for\r\n\r\nthe  officer succeeding the holder to understudy  the\r\n\r\nwork for some weeks or even months.

At first sight, it does\r\n\r\nlook  queer  that with Malayanisation,  the  quarters\r\n\r\nposition is still difficult, but it is, Sir, I myself\r\n\r\nat  first thought that the quarters position would be\r\n\r\neased.  It has been somewhat eased in the sense  that\r\n\r\nthe  number of officers on the waiting list has  gone\r\n\r\ndown,  but  as  I  have  pointed  out,  the  quarters\r\n\r\nposition will be difficult next year.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flats which we hope to rent will be placed in\r\n\r\nthe  common  pool of quarters, which are administered\r\n\r\nby  the Temporary Quarters Committee, which is run by\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry. That is how it comes into this part  of\r\n\r\nthe  Estimates. A possible shortage of quarters  will\r\n\r\narise  in  1958 because of the need to house military\r\n\r\nofficers on contract who are brought out to train the\r\n\r\nSingapore Military Forces and the Singapore  Infantry\r\n\r\nRegiment.  We have also now to give consideration  to\r\n\r\nquarters  for  locally  recruited  officers  of   our\r\n\r\nmilitary forces. We have to cater for the Polytechnic\r\n\r\nstaff  and  experts  on loan from  foreign  countries\r\n\r\nunder the Colombo Plan and U.N.O. programmes. I think\r\n\r\nwe will have to recruit more doctors next year and we\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  provide quarters for them.  It  would\r\n\r\nsurprise Members to know that we will not have enough\r\n\r\nof quarters and we do need these flats. The provision\r\n\r\nof  $30,000  is only 75 per cent of that provided  in\r\n\r\n1957,  and  we  hope that we will be  able  to  house\r\n\r\nanything up to a dozen officers or experts, according\r\n\r\nto the quality of\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe quarters rented.

Sir, I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  that to the question what is the future  fate\r\n\r\nof  Radio  Malaya, the answer is still the same  this\r\n\r\nyear,  and that is, it is under consideration because\r\n\r\nit  is  a  Pan Malayan Department and its  future  is\r\n\r\nengaging  the  attention of the  Governments  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  and Singapore. Hon. Members  will  recall\r\n\r\nthat  in  the Federal Council meeting on the  4th  of\r\n\r\nthis month, His Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan Agong  in\r\n\r\nhis speech said that the Government of the Federation\r\n\r\nof   Malaya   proposed   to  examine   the   existing\r\n\r\narrangements in the broadcasting service with a  view\r\n\r\nto  ensuring complete control over future policy  and\r\n\r\neventually to arrange for the Federation to have  its\r\n\r\nown  broadcasting service. As I said, this matter  is\r\n\r\nbeing  given consideration and I cannot say  anything\r\n\r\nexcept  to  repeat again that the question  of  Radio\r\n\r\nMalaya is still under consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> (Queenstown): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nspeaking on the appointments held by expatriates  and\r\n\r\nAsians,  I  notice  on  page  64,  item  24,  in  the\r\n\r\nProgramme Division, the creation of a new post called\r\n\r\nthe  Controller of Programmes. Now here is the reason\r\n\r\nwhy  this post is created - I refer to page 444 of  the\r\n\r\nEstimates:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A new post of Controller of Programmes has been\r\n\r\ncreated so that adequate supervision can be given  to\r\n\r\nthe  nine sections in the Programme Division (English\r\n\r\nProgrammes,  Chinese Programmes,  Indian  Programmes,\r\n\r\nMalay  Programmes, Record Library, Reference Library,\r\n\r\nScript  Traffic,  Production Assistant's  Office  and\r\n\r\nRadio  Orchestra).  The duties  of  a  Controller  of\r\n\r\nProgrammes  have in the past been undertaken  by  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Director, who as a result was unable to  carry\r\n\r\nout  his normal duties. It is also necessary to  have\r\n\r\nan  upper  timescale  post in this  Division  of  the\r\n\r\nDepartment to give parity with other Divisions, e.g..\r\n\r\nNews    Division,   Schools   Division,   Engineering\r\n\r\nDivision.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This job was normally carried out by the Deputy\r\n\r\nDirector  and it appears now that, according  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, the Deputy Director cannot carry out  the\r\n\r\nduties  of  this post. Yet I see that the appointment\r\n\r\nof  Principal Administrative Officer on page  63  has\r\n\r\nbeen  abolished. Now why create a post here and  then\r\n\r\nabolish a post there? Is the Deputy Director so  busy\r\n\r\nthat  he  cannot manage just merely to supervise,  as\r\n\r\nclearly stated in the reason given above? His work is\r\n\r\njust  to supervise and, apart from his normal duties,\r\n\r\nis  it not possible for him to supervise the work  of\r\n\r\nthe Programme Division?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, on this question of appointments on page\r\n\r\n64,  let  us  compare item (25) with items  (27)  and\r\n\r\n(28).  In  item  (25)  we have an  English  Programme\r\n\r\nSupervisor  whose salary scale is $960-35A-1,240.  In\r\n\r\nitems  (27)  and (28) we have the Chinese and  Indian\r\n\r\nProgramme Supervisors whose salary is 5560: 630: 660:\r\n\r\n690-30A-930/bar/960-35A-1,240. Why should there be  a\r\n\r\ndisparity  between  the English Programme  Supervisor\r\n\r\nand the Chinese and Indian Programme Supervisors?  Is\r\n\r\nit  because  of the word \"English\" that  the  English\r\n\r\nProgramme Supervisor carries a higher salary than the\r\n\r\nChinese  and Indian Programme Supervisors? Or  is  it\r\n\r\nbecause\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  post-English  Programme  Supervisor - is\r\n\r\nheld by an expatriate officer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the Chief Secretary can tell us whether\r\n\r\nthe post of Controller of Programmes is to be filled\r\n\r\nby an expatriate officer and who will be appointed to\r\n\r\nthe three Programme Supervisor appointments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, a new post of Controller of\r\n\r\nProgrammes  is  required. His  responsibility  is  to\r\n\r\nsupervise  the  nine sections which  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  mentioned, and his duties, which  are  of\r\n\r\ncourse  full-time, have hitherto been  undertaken  by\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy Director who, as a result, has  not  been\r\n\r\navailable for normal Deputy Director duties. With the\r\n\r\nabolition  of  the  post of Principal  Administrative\r\n\r\nOfficer, the Deputy Director will take over  some  of\r\n\r\nthe  functions of that post. That is the  reason  why\r\n\r\nthe  post  of  Principal Administrative  Officer  was\r\n\r\nabolished.  The Deputy Director takes over  his  post\r\n\r\nand   is  in  turn  relieved  of  responsibility  for\r\n\r\nsupervision of the Programme Division which  will  be\r\n\r\nundertaken by the Controller of Programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the other point raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown, I certainly do not  agree  with  his\r\n\r\nreason  for  the apparent difference  in  the  salary\r\n\r\nscale - it  is  only  a question of  the  segment.  The\r\n\r\ndifference is not because of the fact that  the  post\r\n\r\nis filled by an expatriate or that the word \"English\"\r\n\r\nhas magic attached to it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 11 be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 4 therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have again chosen item (1) under this head\r\n\r\nfor  discussion of the whole subject. Sir, we see  in\r\n\r\nthe Budget \"Royal Malayan Navy\", \"Malayan Royal Naval\r\n\r\nVolunteer  Reserve\",  \"Singapore  Military   Forces\",\r\n\r\n\"Singapore Infantry Regiment\", \"Malayan Auxiliary Air\r\n\r\nForce\", etc, costing us so many million dollars. Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen   the  Royal  Malayan  Navy  was  created,   our\r\n\r\nconstitutional position was quite different.  Now  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  neighbour  which is an independent  country.\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  very little to look  after  and  very\r\n\r\nlittle to fight for. Is it necessary at all to  spend\r\n\r\nso  much  money on naval establishments?  If  we  are, spending, for whose benefit are we spending, and for\r\n\r\nwhich war are we spending? Further, Sir, can we go on\r\n\r\nspending on such items when we ourselves as  a  small\r\n\r\ncolony  would  be quite helpless? The  last  war  has\r\n\r\nalready  shown  us what we should do  [Interruption.]\r\n\r\nYes,  you  people left the local people in the  lurch\r\n\r\nand we had to suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Some local chaps scooted!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> What I discovered at that time was\r\n\r\nthat  we  were helpless against air attack.  We  were\r\n\r\nnever  attacked  from  the  sea  side.  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nsurrounded  by small islands and we can  prevent  the\r\n\r\nenemy  from  entering by laying  mines,  etc.  If  my\r\n\r\nmemory  serves,  the  enemy  never  tried  to  attack\r\n\r\nSingapore  from the sea. In the conditions prevailing\r\n\r\nat  present in the world, is it worth while to go  on\r\n\r\nspending millions and millions on a project which may\r\n\r\nbe   quite  useless,  having  regard  to  the  recent\r\n\r\ndevelopments  of sputniks and so many  other  things?\r\n\r\nCan we not utilise this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney  for  the  betterment  of  our  own  people  by\r\n\r\nproviding  health and medical services, and education\r\n\r\nand so on?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, we are also spending a lot\r\n\r\non  military forces. Why so much? Are we to fight any\r\n\r\none?  Will we be able to resist anyone? What actually\r\n\r\nis wanted is the means whereby we can secure internal\r\n\r\ncontrol and help the police. Yes, I do agree that our\r\n\r\nyoungsters must take up military service. It will  be\r\n\r\nof  use in an emergency and it will help them to keep\r\n\r\nfit. But do we want so many battalions and should  we\r\n\r\nwaste  so  much money on army equipment and training?\r\n\r\nAfter  all, whom are we paying to train? Expatriates?\r\n\r\nOf course, we have got to do this because we have not\r\n\r\ngot  our  own  trained personnel. Sir,  therefore,  I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest  that  considerable  economy  can   be\r\n\r\neffected under this head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport   this  amendment  wholeheartedly.  I   still\r\n\r\nremember during the debate on the Second Reading  the\r\n\r\nreply   of  the  Hon. the  Chief  Secretary  to   my\r\n\r\nsuggestion  that  we scrap entirely defence,  and  he\r\n\r\ngave a very humorous example that we could not refuse\r\n\r\nto  buy  an umbrella although the rain had  not  come\r\n\r\nyet.
