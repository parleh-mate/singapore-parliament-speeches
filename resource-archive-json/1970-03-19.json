In other words, no\r\n\r\nless than $82,000 has been lopped off. This is a\r\n\r\ndrastic cut. I well know, Sir, that such\r\n\r\nscholarships are few in number and that, in most\r\n\r\ncases, the recipients win other awards. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthree questions come to my mind. First, will the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister indicate the number of such holders\r\n\r\nwho have graduated from their courses of study\r\n\r\nsince the inception of the President's scholarships\r\n\r\nand in which areas they are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nnow serving? Secondly, whilst I agree that such top\r\n\r\nhonours  are  not  easy  to gain,  I  am  wondering\r\n\r\nwhether  this  further  cut  will  not  dampen  the\r\n\r\nkeenness in competition of the aspirants,  in  view\r\n\r\nof a further reduction in the number of awards this\r\n\r\nyear,  as  was so stated. Sir, no one  doubts  that\r\n\r\nthis  is a highly covetous award which many of  our\r\n\r\nstudents are aiming to get. Thirdly, Sir, will  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister indicate the number of awards  made\r\n\r\nlast year as against the possible number this year?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we had occasion to discuss this\r\n\r\nsame  matter in the 1968 budget session. The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Punggol knows that the standards required  for\r\n\r\nthe  President's scholarships have  been  set  very\r\n\r\nhigh.  Awards  are  made to those with  exceptional\r\n\r\nacademic     performance    and    extra-curricular\r\n\r\nactivities. The numbers awarded were nine in  1966,\r\n\r\nseven  in  1967, six in 1968 and four in 1969.  The\r\n\r\nawards for 1970 are being considered at present.  I\r\n\r\ncannot   anticipate  how  many  will   finally   be\r\n\r\nconsidered worthy of becoming President's scholars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since 1967 Merit scholarships have been\r\n\r\nawarded  to those who have done well, but  did  not\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the high standards required of President's\r\n\r\nscholars. Twelve of these were awarded in 1967,  13\r\n\r\nin  1968  and  seven in 1969. Of the 26 President's\r\n\r\nscholars  to  date,  eight  have  completed   their\r\n\r\nstudies.

Will not the full award\r\n\r\nof  the  scholarship enhance the  prestige  of  the\r\n\r\nrecipient rather than just a scholarship allowance?\r\n\r\nIf that is the case, I think this $42,000 will go a\r\n\r\nmuch longer way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> With respect for the Member for Punggol, I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that if scholarship is to be nurtured  and\r\n\r\nencouraged,  then too much money to young  students\r\n\r\nmay  not  necessarily bring about the best results.\r\n\r\nLast   year,  of  the  four  who  were  President's\r\n\r\nscholars,  three  won other scholarships.

I  crave  your\r\n\r\nindulgence by referring to a point which I think is\r\n\r\nrelevant  and  which was made by the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  in  his  Budget statement.  He  said  that\r\n\r\nqualitative  improvements have taken place  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety,  that there is more social discipline  and\r\n\r\nthat parvenu values are giving way to more positive\r\n\r\ngroup   values.   I  agree  generally   with   this\r\n\r\nstatement.  But  I would like to  state  it  as  my\r\n\r\nopinion  that our highways and by-ways may  be  the\r\n\r\nlast   bastion  of  these  parvenu  values,   where\r\n\r\neverybody  thinks  of himself  and  apparently  the\r\n\r\ndevil  takes the hindmost. I suggest that  we  make\r\n\r\nevery effort to ensure that Government vehicles set\r\n\r\nan  example of social discipline on the road  -  an\r\n\r\nexample  which I find more honoured in  the  breach\r\n\r\nthan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  observance.

But   these\r\n\r\nvehicles  are  knocked,  too,  and  the  Government\r\n\r\nrecovered  as  compensation for damages  caused  to\r\n\r\nGovernment vehicles a total sum of $23,375.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member can rest assured that circulars are\r\n\r\nsent  out  to Government departments to  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat drivers take care and follow road regulations.\r\n\r\nWhere  an  accident  occurs  as  a  result  of  the\r\n\r\nnegligence   of   the  driver   employed   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and if the Attorney-General thinks that\r\n\r\na  prosecution should be brought, it is brought. On\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand,  the  facts  may  not  warrant  a\r\n\r\nprosecution but may warrant disciplinary action  to\r\n\r\nbe taken against drivers of Government vehicles. In\r\n\r\nthat  case,  disciplinary action is  taken.  But  I\r\n\r\nwould  agree  with  the  Member  that  drivers   of\r\n\r\nGovernment  vehicles  should  set  the  example  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for his answer and I\r\n\r\nbeg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $720,620 for Head 0107 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0301 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Madam\r\n\r\nChan Choy Siong -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0301 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead\r\n\r\n1001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (1), Madam Chan is not present.

There was no  reply.  They\r\n\r\nwrote  another letter on 14th November,  1969,  and\r\n\r\nstill  there  was no reply. On 2nd December,  1969,\r\n\r\nthey  again  wrote to him. A reply was received  on\r\n\r\n5th  December, 1969, informing them that, owing  to\r\n\r\nthe  shortage of staff, the National Museum was not\r\n\r\nable  to  take  any  action in  this  matter.

And is it necessary to  have\r\n\r\nsuch a post in the Museum?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye :</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Museum is visited very\r\n\r\nlargely  by  school students and it is,  therefore,\r\n\r\nessentially  an  educational  institution.  If  the\r\n\r\nMuseum  is  to  serve its purpose usefully,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  indeed that we should have  one  officer\r\n\r\nwho  will  be able to organise tours on  behalf  of\r\n\r\nschools  which  carry  out regular  visits  to  the\r\n\r\nMuseum. It is because of this reason that the  post\r\n\r\nmarked \"Education Officer\" has been created in  the\r\n\r\nNational  Museum. This has been done on the  advice\r\n\r\nof the National Museum Advisory Committee, of which\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Katong is the President.  If  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson wishes further information  on\r\n\r\nthis aspect, he can ask the Member for Katong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just to inform the House, the Education\r\n\r\nOfficer  is, as of this moment, seconded  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education. But it is our intention  at\r\n\r\nsome future date that this person should be part of\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of the Museum itself. The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson may be interested to know that  during\r\n\r\nthe  period  1st  July to 31st December  last  year\r\n\r\nthere   were  altogether  55  guided  visits  which\r\n\r\nrepresented 2,080 pupils and 194 teachers  from  27\r\n\r\nschools and the Teachers' Training College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Museum organised eight practical\r\n\r\nand   field  courses  for  117  teachers  who  were\r\n\r\nteaching  nature science or biology. We  have  also\r\n\r\nplans  to  arrange for talks and demonstrations  to\r\n\r\nscience  clubs  in schools, and it  is  because  of\r\n\r\nthese  extended and enlarged services of the Museum\r\n\r\nthat  we  have come to the conclusion that a  full-time  Education Officer in the Museum will be  very\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

These two important aspects of the\r\n\r\nmodern  economic  development of nations  have  been\r\n\r\nignored  for  too long, during the colonial  period\r\n\r\nand  the early post-war period. To make up for the\r\n\r\nloss  of time, the Government has wisely set  up  a\r\n\r\nScience  Council  recently, and in accordance  with\r\n\r\nits  policy of promoting the study and practice  of\r\n\r\nscience and technology, the Ministry of Science and\r\n\r\nTechnology   was  set  up  in  1968.   Regrettably,\r\n\r\nhowever,  the functions of the Science Council,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  those  of  the Ministry  of  Science  and\r\n\r\nTechnology, remain not quite well known to the  man\r\n\r\nin the street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever have been the achievements of the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Science and Technology in the past  two\r\n\r\nyears, there have been some at least that have  not\r\n\r\nbeen well publicised. If the achievements have been\r\n\r\nmodest,  it  is  quite  understandable  because   a\r\n\r\nrelatively  small allotment has been made  to  this\r\n\r\nMinistry  in  the past budget. The total  allotment\r\n\r\ncovering  the 15 months was only $390,200, whereas\r\n\r\nthis  year  it  has been increased a  bit.  It  now\r\n\r\nstands at $455,280.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly feel that if the Ministry is to\r\n\r\nbe  able,  to  quote the Minister for Finance,  \"to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  effective  economic  and  statistical\r\n\r\nevaluation  as, well as to determine the  needs  of\r\n\r\nindustry with greater precision\", then the  present\r\n\r\nstaffing position, as outlined in the Estimates  of\r\n\r\nRevenue  and  Expenditure  of  Singapore  for   the\r\n\r\nfinancial  year  1st April, 1970,  to  31st  March,\r\n\r\n1971, is far too inadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under subhead 3005 for this Ministry, I\r\n\r\nobserve that $70,000 has been set aside, subject to\r\n\r\nTreasury sanction, for the employment of staff  and\r\n\r\n$1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion  under  the Development Estimates  for  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of the Popular Science Centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the setting up of this centre, but\r\n\r\nwith   $1.7  million  to  start  off  for  personal\r\n\r\nemoluments  and  the  development  of  the  Science\r\n\r\nCentre,  I  begin to wonder what kind of centre  it\r\n\r\nwill  turn out to be and how it is going to achieve\r\n\r\nits  desired  objective of giving the  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  a  better understanding of  what  modern\r\n\r\nscience  is  all  about,  although  ultimately  the\r\n\r\nbuilding will cost $5.2 million. Sir, we know  that\r\n\r\neven  to  set  up a good laboratory in a  secondary\r\n\r\nschool costs much more than a million dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye :</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  his very staunch support, and I certainly hope\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance will take heed of what he\r\n\r\nhas stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to explain to the House that the\r\n\r\nconcept of the Science Centre is being revised.  As\r\n\r\nMembers  will  know,  at the  moment  we  have  the\r\n\r\nNational  Museum, one part of which houses  stuffed\r\n\r\nanimals  and  the other part houses Chinese  beads,\r\n\r\ncoins,  porcelain and similar antiques. We recently\r\n\r\nrequested, through U.N.D.P., the assistance  of  an\r\n\r\nexpert,  Miss  Weston,  who  was  attached  to  the\r\n\r\nScience Museum in Kensington, to advise us  on  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up of the Popular Science Centre. She  has\r\n\r\nsubmitted  a report to the Government in which  she\r\n\r\nhas recommended a Science Centre, not quite similar\r\n\r\nto  the one in London but one which will be able to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate   the   application   of   science   to\r\n\r\ntechnology,  to  be  built in  Singapore.  We  have\r\n\r\nrecently  been looking into this problem  and  have\r\n\r\ncome  to  the conclusion that the proposed  Popular\r\n\r\nScience  Centre should be more than that. Since  we\r\n\r\nare going to spend a substantial sum of money - $5\r\n\r\nmillion  and  perhaps  more -  we  ought  to  find,\r\n\r\nfirstly, a suitable site, and, secondly, to make up\r\n\r\nour  minds  what the Popular Science Centre  should\r\n\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion is that the Popular Science\r\n\r\nCentre should consist of two divisions. One\r\n\r\ndivision will show the application of science to\r\n\r\ntechnology, and the second division will show\r\n\r\nexhibits relating to the life sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we have another U.N.E.S.C.O. expert,\r\n\r\nMr Gardner, who came to Singapore to advise us on\r\n\r\nhow to modernise the National Museum. He has come\r\n\r\nto the conclusion that the animals we are stuffing\r\n\r\nin the National Museum are antiquated and out of\r\n\r\ndate. Most museums these days devote only a very\r\n\r\nsmall corner of their building to taxonomy. So he\r\n\r\nhas suggested that perhaps it would be more\r\n\r\ninstructive if visitors to the Museum could be\r\n\r\nshown the origin of life evolution, the relation\r\n\r\nbetween man and his environment, that is the\r\n\r\necological aspects of living matter, and perhaps\r\n\r\neven school children will be able to relate how\r\n\r\nbiology is integrated with environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be having a discussion over this problem\r\n\r\nwith the Museum Advisory Committee and the Curator,\r\n\r\nand will put up a recommendation to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance and the Minister for Law and National\r\n\r\nDevelopment. I hope that the former will give me\r\n\r\nmore money and the latter will give me a site so\r\n\r\nthat we can have a Popular Science Centre.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly the present location of the National\r\n\r\nMuseum constricts its development and it is\r\n\r\nimpossible to put up any other building close by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the National Museum is now located\r\n\r\nin an area of land that is, very expensive indeed,\r\n\r\nand somehow I feel that it is not justifiable to go\r\n\r\nalong and make a claim to very expensive land which\r\n\r\ncan be used for more economical purposes. This,\r\n\r\nbriefly, then is the thinking of the proposed\r\n\r\nPopular Science Centre. I hope that when the time\r\n\r\ncomes for claims to be made on the Finance Minister\r\n\r\nand the Minister for Law and National Development,\r\n\r\nI will have the staunch support of the Member for\r\n\r\nTelok Blangah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

New factories\r\n\r\nare springing up all the time. New investments are\r\n\r\ncoming in at a constant pace. This has enabled the\r\n\r\nvarious   sectors   in  our  economy   to   become\r\n\r\nprosperous. It has also created a large number  of\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities. The Ministry of Finance,\r\n\r\nof  course, has done a great deal of good work. As\r\n\r\na result of the prosperity in our economy, we have\r\n\r\nbeen  able to overcome the adverse factors brought\r\n\r\nabout  by the impending withdrawal of the  British\r\n\r\nforces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, some people had certain worries and\r\n\r\nreservations.  These have proved to be  unfounded.\r\n\r\nThe  reason why we are enjoying our prosperity now\r\n\r\nis on account of two factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Government has looked after all\r\n\r\naspects of economic development very well. It  has\r\n\r\nlaid   down   plans  and  has  provided  excellent\r\n\r\nopportunities   and  favourable   conditions   for\r\n\r\nforeign capitalists to come here and invest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our workers possess the aptitude and\r\n\r\nability to work hard. In the interest of the\r\n\r\ncountry, they are willing to work hard. By doing\r\n\r\nthis,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  help  industries to prosper.

I\r\n\r\nwould  ask the Minister for Finance to try  to  do\r\n\r\nsomething to raise their wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is another point I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  make. Our external trade last  year  has\r\n\r\nincreased considerably. Total trade last year  has\r\n\r\nexceeded  the  sum  of  $10,984  million.  It  has\r\n\r\nincreased  by  about $2,000 million over  that  of\r\n\r\n1968. Although the figures show an improvement  in\r\n\r\nour  economy,  generally  from  the  ship-building\r\n\r\nindustry, tourism and various other sectors of the\r\n\r\neconomy,  we  cannot  deny that  the  unfavourable\r\n\r\nbalance of trade is a weakness. Therefore, I would\r\n\r\nlike  the  Minister to find a solution to  improve\r\n\r\nour  balance of trade. For example, we should send\r\n\r\nmore trade delegations to sell our goods overseas.\r\n\r\nWe  should not confine our trade only to  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade but we should trade with many more countries\r\n\r\non a mutually beneficial basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has\r\n\r\ngiven  a  warning that we must not  be  complacent\r\n\r\nabout our present situation. This is very true. We\r\n\r\nmust always remain alert. Because of this, we must\r\n\r\nlook  for  more  ways and means of increasing  our\r\n\r\nincome. We must explore new territories to  expand\r\n\r\nour  economy further. For example, can we not look\r\n\r\ninto  the  question of starting fishery and  dairy\r\n\r\nindustries  in  our small island?  We  could  also\r\n\r\ninclude  the  growing of orchids, or  perhaps  the\r\n\r\nrearing of tropical fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that our tropical products are very\r\n\r\npopular  and  welcome in Europe. In the  past  few\r\n\r\nyears the income from the export of these tropical\r\n\r\nproducts   has   been  several  million   dollars.\r\n\r\nAlthough  our  country is small, our  agricultural\r\n\r\nindustry  has  managed to earn about $200  million\r\n\r\nper  year. So long as we continue to work hard  in\r\n\r\nthis  direction,  we will he able  to  expand  our\r\n\r\nagricultural industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan Choy Siong is not here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir, I agree with much of what the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang has said. I would like wages to  rise  as\r\n\r\nfast as possible, with the proviso, of course, that\r\n\r\nthis   will   not  have  any  adverse   effect   on\r\n\r\ninvestment.  The  way  to do it  is  quite  simple.\r\n\r\nFirst,  whatever work is being done now by  workers\r\n\r\nshould  be  done more efficiently and with  greater\r\n\r\nskill;  to  the extent that productivity increases,\r\n\r\nthis  will  allow workers to get more pay  for  the\r\n\r\nsame  job. The second way in which we can  increase\r\n\r\nwages  will be to develop those industries where  a\r\n\r\nhigh  level of skill and a large number of  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers  are  required, such as in the  engineering\r\n\r\nand  shipbuilding industries. Both  these  ways  of\r\n\r\nraising wages should be pursued vigorously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is worried about unfavourable trade\r\n\r\nbalances.  I  do  not  know  whether  he  has  been\r\n\r\nlistening  in  regularly to Radio  Peking!  Because\r\n\r\nRadio Peking is also worried about our unfavourable\r\n\r\ntrade  balance.  Within days of the publication  of\r\n\r\nour annual statistics of imports and exports, which\r\n\r\ninvariably show a deficit on the balance of trade - this  can  be  anything from $500 million  to  $800\r\n\r\nmillion - these figures are quoted by Radio  Peking\r\n\r\nas evidence that we are being exploited, or heading\r\n\r\nfor  bankruptcy, or whatever it is.  Actually  this\r\n\r\nlarge  unfavourable balance of trade does not worry\r\n\r\nme in the least. For the balance of trade, that is,\r\n\r\nthe  goods  we  import compared with the  goods  we\r\n\r\nexport, is only one element in the total balance of\r\n\r\npayments.   To   offset  this  unfavourable   trade\r\n\r\nbalance,   we  have  what  people  call   invisible\r\n\r\nearnings,  i.e.,  earnings from shipping,  banking,\r\n\r\ninsurance services, the tourist trade, and  profits\r\n\r\nmade  on  the entrepot trade. Taken as a whole,  my\r\n\r\nrecollection  is that over the last four  years  we\r\n\r\nhave   had   a   favourable  balance   on   current\r\n\r\ntransactions,  taking visible and  invisible  items\r\n\r\ntogether.  However, we should try,  of  course,  to\r\n\r\nincrease\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour   exports,   not  so  much   to   redress   the\r\n\r\nunfavourable balance of trade, because I think this\r\n\r\nis  of such an order of magnitude that it cannot be\r\n\r\ndone,  but because it would mean more income,  more\r\n\r\nemployment, and more prosperity for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the breeding of tropical fish and the\r\n\r\ngrowing  of  orchids, I am all with the Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang  provided he does not ask my Ministry  to\r\n\r\ndo  anything about it. It is the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nmy    colleague,   the   Minister   for    National\r\n\r\nDevelopment. The Agricultural Research  Station  in\r\n\r\nSembawang,  which is in the Member's  constituency,\r\n\r\nis doing a lot of work in breeding tropical fish. I\r\n\r\nbelieve  they  have  discovered  a  way  of  making\r\n\r\nJapanese  carp spawn in the tropics.  This  is  the\r\n\r\nfirst time it is being done. In addition to orchids\r\n\r\nand  tropical  fish, I may say that  we  are  doing\r\n\r\nquite  a lucrative business in crocodiles. We  rear\r\n\r\ncrocodiles  not  only in farms in the  countryside,\r\n\r\nbut I am told in the city itself. However, lately I\r\n\r\nread  in  the newspapers that some crocodiles  have\r\n\r\nescaped, and I hope this will not prove a menace to\r\n\r\nour   citizens   in   future,  This   business   of\r\n\r\ncrocodiles, tropical fish and orchids has,  as  the\r\n\r\nMember said, a great prospect for growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister's reply is not too\r\n\r\nsatisfactory. First, about the imbalance of  trade,\r\n\r\nhe  says  that I am influenced by Radio  Peking.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to inform him that I never  listen  to\r\n\r\nRadio  Peking. I have raised this question  because\r\n\r\nthere  is  really a weakness in our trade.  If  our\r\n\r\ntrade balance gets worse, it is of concern to us. I\r\n\r\nthink the Minister will agree with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, in respect of other fields of\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  I  think  we  should  engage   in   a\r\n\r\ndiversification  of our economy in  order  to  earn\r\n\r\nmore for our country. I think the Minister will, of\r\n\r\ncourse, carry out these projects,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1031.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the progress of modern industrialisation in\r\n\r\nthe Republic deserves high admiration. Almost every\r\n\r\naspect  is  being looked after, such  as  technical\r\n\r\nfacilities, training, research, both in large-  and\r\n\r\nmedium-scale  industries.  Needless  to  say,  with\r\n\r\nthese modern industrial facilities production  from\r\n\r\nthese  industries will be speeded  up  and  a  vast\r\n\r\nconsumption  at  home and abroad is expected.  Sir,\r\n\r\nfor  export we have agencies like Intraco  and  the\r\n\r\nmany  missions abroad to look after sales.  But  at\r\n\r\nhome I think we have not done enough. I would like\r\n\r\nto  suggest  that we encourage more  citizens,  who\r\n\r\nhave  a  small capital, to start cottage industries\r\n\r\nor  backyard industries in order to act as  feeders\r\n\r\nto  the manufactures of the big industries. I would\r\n\r\nalso  like  to  say that every assistance  must  be\r\n\r\ngiven to them. To do this, I think we must cut  red\r\n\r\ntape  to the minimum. For example, it I were living\r\n\r\nin  a kampong or in a residential area and if I had\r\n\r\na  little  money to buy simple machinery driven  by\r\n\r\nelectricity,  I  would start to produce  something.\r\n\r\nBut  a  few days later, if I were found out by  the\r\n\r\nbuilding inspector, he would immediately report me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Ban the industry!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> From there, the Chief Building Surveyor would\r\n\r\ncome  after  me.

Of course, it is not possible\r\n\r\nfor  my Ministry to connive at breaking the law.  I\r\n\r\ncan only hope that this sturdy breed of resourceful\r\n\r\npeople  will  survive  the  persecution  of   these\r\n\r\nbureaucrats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, I should also say we should\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  what  the  Member  said  has  some\r\n\r\neconomic  sense. If we could have a large  base  of\r\n\r\nsmall industries which can provide services to  the\r\n\r\nlarger manufacturing units, we would have given our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing   sector  additional   strength   and\r\n\r\nflexibility which is a distinct advantage over  the\r\n\r\nrather highly organised manufacturing industries of\r\n\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the case of the Japanese industry.\r\n\r\nYou  have  the industrial giants, Mitsubishi,  Fuji\r\n\r\nSteel,  and  so  on. Supporting the  production  of\r\n\r\nthese large-scale manufacturers, you have a host of\r\n\r\nsmall-scale   units  virtually   run   as   cottage\r\n\r\nindustries. These cottage industries which are  run\r\n\r\nwith  very  low  overhead  costs,  have  tremendous\r\n\r\nflexibility  because  they  can  switch  from   one\r\n\r\nproduct  to another without a lot of retooling.  In\r\n\r\nmany  instances they club together  to  form  small\r\n\r\nindustrial co-operatives. A member of the  Japanese\r\n\r\nDiet  who belongs to the Socialist Party (I do  not\r\n\r\nknow which of the Socialist Parties he belongs  to,\r\n\r\nbut  he belongs to one of them) came here and  said\r\n\r\nthat  if  we wanted to know more about how Japanese\r\n\r\ncottage   industries,  often  run  on  co-operative\r\n\r\nprinciples, are organised, he would be glad to help\r\n\r\nus.  I  certainly  intend to avail  myself  of  his\r\n\r\noffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subject actually may be quite relevant to us\r\n\r\nin  the  immediate  future, because  urban  renewal\r\n\r\nintends to knock\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout   the   small  machine  shops  in   the   Horne\r\n\r\nRoad/French Road/Lavender Street area.  The  Urban\r\n\r\nRenewal  Department  think that  these  are  small\r\n\r\nmotor-car   repairers,  and  they  classify   this\r\n\r\nindustry as a \"dirty\" industry. Actually  this  is\r\n\r\nthe  heart of our ship-repairing industry.  If  we\r\n\r\ndestroy  this  small industrial sector,  then  the\r\n\r\nbigger  dockyards,  like  the  Port  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority,  the Sembawang Shipyard, or the  Jurong\r\n\r\nShipyard,  will find a very valuable and important\r\n\r\nsource  of  support knocked off from  under  their\r\n\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one effective way whereby we can\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the  industrial  sector,   by   giving\r\n\r\nfacilities  to small-scale production units  which\r\n\r\nstill  have a very valuable part to play in  modern\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> I wish the Minister to inform this House whether,\r\n\r\nin  the urban renewal scheme, the Government  will\r\n\r\ndemarcate a zone, not in Sembawang, of course, but\r\n\r\nin  Changi,  where small machine shops or  cottage\r\n\r\nindustries can be set up in that area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, that is precisely what the Government is\r\n\r\nplanning  to  do.

I  am\r\n\r\nallowing   only  one  new  foreign   bank   to   be\r\n\r\nestablished - it is a German bank ---, and this  is\r\n\r\nbecause   of   new   interest   shown   by   German\r\n\r\nindustrialists   to   set  up   establishments   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the remittances of profits, foreign\r\n\r\nincorporated banks are free to remit their  profits\r\n\r\nif  they want to or to plough them back into  their\r\n\r\nSingapore  business if they so desire.

I  understand   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  made  provision  for   the   Staff\r\n\r\nTraining  Centre in order to train public  officers\r\n\r\nwho  have  just  been recruited  into  the  various\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments. All the new recruits  will\r\n\r\nhe  trained in the Staff Training Centre; thus this\r\n\r\npost  of Higher Executive Officer is provided  for.\r\n\r\nAt the Staff Training Centre these trainees will be\r\n\r\ntaught how to go about their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  do their job well.  But  it  is  not\r\n\r\nenough to train them how to carry out their routine\r\n\r\nwork. They should receive some training in courtesy\r\n\r\nand  the  correct  attitude to  adopt  towards  the\r\n\r\npublic. After all, Government is spending money  on\r\n\r\nthis Centre and on this post. Mr Speaker, Sir, you\r\n\r\nwill  agree  with  me  that, at  the  moment,  many\r\n\r\nGovernment officers are behaving in the same manner\r\n\r\nas  they  did before the P.A.P. first launched  its\r\n\r\nrevolutionary  campaign of trying to correct  their\r\n\r\nattitude  and  behaviour.  I  will  compare   their\r\n\r\nattitude  now with that obtaining some  years  ago.\r\n\r\nThere  is a marked difference. We all know that  in\r\n\r\nOctober  last  year  there was  a  forum  conducted\r\n\r\njointly   by   the   People's  Association,   Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore and another organisation. It was a  forum\r\n\r\nin  which  the participants discussed  whether  the\r\n\r\nattitude and behaviour of Government servants  were\r\n\r\nsatisfactory or not. During the debate  both  sides\r\n\r\ngave  their  views to support their  arguments  and\r\n\r\nthere  were  pros  and cons. But  in  the  end  the\r\n\r\ndecision   was   in  favour  of  the   side   whose\r\n\r\nproposition was that the attitude and behaviour  of\r\n\r\nGovernment servants were not satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the Staff Training Centre should not just\r\n\r\nconcentrate on training the staff on how  to  carry\r\n\r\nout  their  work.  The Centre should  also  conduct\r\n\r\ncourses on the proper attitude and behaviour to  be\r\n\r\nadopted  because there have been complaints against\r\n\r\ncivil  servants. Some people complained to me  that\r\n\r\nGovernment officers in certain departments  behaved\r\n\r\nbadly. I visited these offices myself. Sir, I  went\r\n\r\nthere in disguise. I put on dark glasses and wore a\r\n\r\nmodern  dress. I went into a post office  which  is\r\n\r\nfrequented  by  residents in the area,  as  it  was\r\n\r\nreported  to me that the staff there were arrogant.\r\n\r\nI  went  to a section in the post office which  did\r\n\r\nnot  sell stamps and I purposely said that I wanted\r\n\r\nto  buy stamps. The person in charge spoke to me in\r\n\r\nEnglish. He said, \"Why do you come to this  section\r\n\r\nto buy stamps? You had better clear off.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I went off. This proved that the complaints made\r\n\r\nby  the  residents were not false. They  were  well\r\n\r\nsubstantiated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another occasion, I personally went to a\r\n\r\nGovernment department as I wanted to inquire  about\r\n\r\na  certain  matter. When I wanted to  go  into  the\r\n\r\noffice,  a  person  asked me in Hokkien,  \"Who  are\r\n\r\nyou?\" I replied, \"I am a Singaporean.\" I also told\r\n\r\nthat  person  that I was Chan Choy Siong.  Then  he\r\n\r\nrealised   who   I   was.  His   attitude   changed\r\n\r\nimmediately and he treated me differently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure there are other departments where the\r\n\r\nstaff  behave  in this way. There  have  been  many\r\n\r\nrecent  cases of residents being evicted under  the\r\n\r\nurban  renewal  scheme. These people  went  to  the\r\n\r\ndepartment  concerned in the Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment. They wasted their time and energy  and\r\n\r\nincurred expenses by going there. We should realise\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  Singapore citizens. We  should  also\r\n\r\nrealise   that   different  races  have   different\r\n\r\ncharacteristics.  The  Indians   have   their   own\r\n\r\ntraditions and characteristics. The Chinese and the\r\n\r\nMalays    have    their    own    traditions    and\r\n\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan has mentioned that some\r\n\r\npeople  were  evicted just before the  Chinese  New\r\n\r\nYear.  They  had been staying in their  houses  for\r\n\r\nmore  than three years. The staff of the department\r\n\r\nconcerned  should  have chosen a  more  appropriate\r\n\r\ntime  to  evict these people so that they were  not\r\n\r\ninconvenienced. This shows that there is no  proper\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the characteristics of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint is about women whose husbands\r\n\r\nwere  members  of the defence forces and  who  were\r\n\r\nkilled during the Japanese occupation. These  women\r\n\r\nare  receiving allowances from the Government.  But\r\n\r\nthe  department concerned has changed the procedure\r\n\r\nof  paying  this  allowance. These  women  used  to\r\n\r\ncollect  their  allowance from  an  office  on  the\r\n\r\nsecond  floor of Fullerton Building. But five  days\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Chinese New Year, they collected  only\r\n\r\n$20  each  and were told to go to the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nInterior and Defence to get\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  balance. They were also told that  the  M.I.D.\r\n\r\nwould  inform them where to get their allowance  in\r\n\r\nfuture.  The Minister for Finance should look  into\r\n\r\nthis  matter. During Chinese New Year,  traffic  is\r\n\r\nvery  heavy and it will take about half an hour  or\r\n\r\nmore  to get to the M.I.D. If these women are late,\r\n\r\nthen no consideration will be given to them and the\r\n\r\nallowance  will  not  be paid to  them.  From  this\r\n\r\nexample, we can see that the officers concerned did\r\n\r\nall  this  purposely. They knew very well that  the\r\n\r\nChinese New Year was coming. Why should they choose\r\n\r\nsuch a time to inconvenience our people? They might\r\n\r\nwell  say that this was something which was routine\r\n\r\nand  that  they  did  not have to  oblige.  If  the\r\n\r\nallowance was to be reduced, they should have  done\r\n\r\nso  sometime before or after the Chinese New  Year.\r\n\r\nWhy should the allowance be reduced just before the\r\n\r\nChinese  New  Year? I am saying this  so  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance  and  the  Government   will\r\n\r\nrealise  that there are certain misgivings  in  the\r\n\r\nminds  of  the people. They want to know  what  has\r\n\r\nhappened  to the P.A.P. Government which  has  been\r\n\r\nboasting  that it is an efficient and incorruptible\r\n\r\ngovernment.  We  should therefore re-establish  our\r\n\r\nimage.  With  this provision, I hope we  can  again\r\n\r\nbrainwash the public servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the course of last year, the\r\n\r\nPolitical   Study  Centre,  which  was   performing\r\n\r\nsomewhat useful functions in orientating the  minds\r\n\r\nof  the  civil servants in Divisions I and II,  was\r\n\r\nclosed  down.  Perhaps  its  importance  had   been\r\n\r\nreduced  as a result of the past good services,  or\r\n\r\nperhaps  the new generation of civil servants  does\r\n\r\nnot require any political orientation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that the functions of the Staff\r\n\r\nTraining Centre are rather vague. I begin to wonder\r\n\r\nwhat  kind of staff training can be given  by  this\r\n\r\nCentre  when  it is manned by just one H.E.O.,  one\r\n\r\nExecutive Officer and one general clerk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, Sir, the civil servants of\r\n\r\nSingapore  deserve praise for their  dedication  to\r\n\r\nduty  and  their willingness to work  hard.  It  is\r\n\r\ngenerally  accepted that we have one  of  the  best\r\n\r\ncivil  services  in this region. Our  officers  are\r\n\r\nknown to be honest, competent and efficient. I have\r\n\r\nnot  had any of the experiences that the Member for\r\n\r\nDelta  has.  But complaints have quite  often  been\r\n\r\nheard  of  a  few  Government and  statutory  board\r\n\r\nofficials for being discourteous when dealing  with\r\n\r\nthe  public. I admit that dealing with  the  public\r\n\r\nespecially when one is hard pressed for time can be\r\n\r\nmost  exasperating  and provocating.  Dealing  with\r\n\r\nordinary  people  who  are  not  well  versed  with\r\n\r\nlegislation  or government policy and procedure  is\r\n\r\nbound  to test the patience of minor officials  who\r\n\r\ncome  in  contact  with  the  public,  unless  they\r\n\r\npossess  special  talent and aptitude  for  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  the public. Such talent and aptitude may  not\r\n\r\nbe  possessed  by  all. But the  situation  can  be\r\n\r\nremedied  by having an effective training programme\r\n\r\nfor those Government or public officers who come in\r\n\r\nfrequent  contact  with the public  in  departments\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Immigration, Work Permit Office, National\r\n\r\nRegistration,   Citizenship,   the   Housing    and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board, the Public Utilities Board, post\r\n\r\noffices and other offices where ugly and unpleasant\r\n\r\nsituations  may  arise through misunderstanding  or\r\n\r\nfailure of communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the politeness and tactfulness which we\r\n\r\nassociated with the Government in relation  to  the\r\n\r\npublic about ten years ago when the People's Action\r\n\r\nParty came to power has now become less noticeable.\r\n\r\nI  am  not advocating for one moment that we return\r\n\r\nto  the  methods  used by the  Government  then  to\r\n\r\ninstil  fear  in Government employees in  order  to\r\n\r\nexact co-operation and courtesy from such officials\r\n\r\nwhen  dealing with the public. But I do advocate  a\r\n\r\nsystematic training programme for officials  to  be\r\n\r\ntaught  the need for courtesy in dealing  with  the\r\n\r\npublic  in  so  far as it is relevant  to  whatever\r\n\r\ndecisions  they have to make. It is the  invariable\r\n\r\npractice in Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndepartments for officers to give a curt refusal  to\r\n\r\nrequests  or inquiries from the public without  any\r\n\r\nfurther  explanation, thus leaving the  members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public  baffled  and in the  dark.  The  Staff\r\n\r\nTraining  Centre  cannot, I  feel,  do  any  useful\r\n\r\ntraining  with  only  three officials  of  clerical\r\n\r\ngrade.  Either  we  have  a proper  Staff  Training\r\n\r\nCentre with the full complement of staff or none at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like the Member for Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah,  I rise to seek further information  about\r\n\r\nthe  Staff Training Centre. I would like to  ask  - What are the functions of the Centre? What sort  of\r\n\r\ntraining  schemes  has it organised?  Who  are  the\r\n\r\nstaff  training instructors? - information of  that\r\n\r\nsort.  I  know there are various examinations  that\r\n\r\ncivil   servants  have  to  take.   The   Permanent\r\n\r\nExaminations Board of the Public Service Commission\r\n\r\nconducts  a  number of examinations.  For  example,\r\n\r\nthere are examinations in law - the various aspects\r\n\r\nof  it  -  general  conditions of  service,  office\r\n\r\nprocedure,  financial procedure and so on.  What  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask is what facilities are available\r\n\r\nfor  civil  servants  who are preparing  for  these\r\n\r\nexaminations? It seems to me that it is fair  that,\r\n\r\nif  we wish our civil servants to prepare for these\r\n\r\nexaminations, courses should be run to help them to\r\n\r\ntake these examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I would imagine that availability of\r\n\r\nbooks  and  reading material would be important.  I\r\n\r\nnotice that there is provision for periodicals  and\r\n\r\nbooks  under  \"Other Charges, Annually  Recurrent\",\r\n\r\nbut perhaps that is inadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, after having listened to the Member for\r\n\r\nDelta  and to the Member for Telok Blangah, perhaps\r\n\r\none of the courses that could be provided would  be\r\n\r\nthat relating to the public relations aspect of the\r\n\r\nwork of civil servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst the Member for Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah  has not had the experience of encountering\r\n\r\nrudeness from certain sections of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service,  I  stand  together  with   my\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Member for Delta, in her complaints.\r\n\r\nCertainly I think the Staff Training Centre is  far\r\n\r\nfrom  adequate in this respect. There is  no  doubt\r\n\r\nabout  it.  The  staffing there may be  small,  but\r\n\r\nthere  may be other instructors coming in  between,\r\n\r\nbut  what  we  must not forget is this question  of\r\n\r\nhuman   relationship.  Being  in  public   service,\r\n\r\nwhether in the statutory boards or elsewhere, those\r\n\r\nat  the  counter invariably will be under a certain\r\n\r\namount of strain in having to deal with members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public.  Members of the public come  from  all\r\n\r\nwalks of life. In other words, tact, politeness and\r\n\r\ncourtesy  must always be uppermost in the minds  of\r\n\r\nofficers  who have to deal with them daily.  I  can\r\n\r\ndraw   from   my  own  experience   with   my   own\r\n\r\nconstituents.  Just to illustrate this  --  in  the\r\n\r\nElectricity  Department  of  the  Public  Utilities\r\n\r\nBoard,  there  is  a counter for \"Applications  for\r\n\r\nTransfers\", the words of which are written  in  the\r\n\r\nEnglish language. Two persons went there. They  did\r\n\r\nnot  know  where else to go. They had to make  some\r\n\r\ninquiries. It so happened that at about  this  time\r\n\r\nthe officer handling this matter was about to close\r\n\r\nshop.  However, since names are invariably  wrongly\r\n\r\nfilled  in,  one  of them went to this  person  who\r\n\r\nrudely  told him, \"Look, your name is not the  same\r\n\r\nas  that in the identity card. Get lost and do  not\r\n\r\nwaste my time!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got this complaint, I, together with the\r\n\r\ntwo men concerned, went to the P.U.B. the following\r\n\r\nmorning.  I asked these two men whether they  could\r\n\r\nrecognise  the officer who was rude  to  them,  and\r\n\r\nthey  said, \"Here he is,\" pointing him  out.  So  I\r\n\r\nasked  the officer, \"Do you remember meeting  these\r\n\r\ntwo  persons?\"  He kept on denying  and  denying.\r\n\r\nThen  I  told him I was so and so, and that  I  was\r\n\r\nthere  to  find out what had happened. I  told  him\r\n\r\nthat I was not going there to make a charge against\r\n\r\nhim   or   anybody.  In  the  end,  he  reluctantly\r\n\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is not the only case of this nature. In\r\n\r\nthe hospitals, M.P.s also get\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch problems. I had an experience myself. I quoted\r\n\r\nthese two examples to show that during the last few\r\n\r\nyears  there have been clear signs of deterioration\r\n\r\nin  the conduct of some of our civil servants. I am\r\n\r\nnot saying that all of them are discourteous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to a point which concerns the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health - I am happy that the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Health   is   here.  One  of   my   Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative  Committee  members  suddenly  had   a\r\n\r\nstroke  in  town and he was rushed to  the  General\r\n\r\nHospital.  I went there when I got the news.  First\r\n\r\nof  all, I found out to which ward this person  was\r\n\r\nadmitted,  and  I went to the ward, though  I  knew\r\n\r\nthat it was before Visiting Hours' time. I went  up\r\n\r\nto the staff nurse and asked, \"How is the condition\r\n\r\nof  this  man?  I am so and so and he is  connected\r\n\r\nwith  my  constituency  and  the  welfare  of   the\r\n\r\nconstituents.\"  She  could not  even  care  to  say\r\n\r\nanything. She just went about her work. In the  end\r\n\r\nI said, \"Look, can you answer this simple question?\r\n\r\nDo  you  not know the condition of this  man?\"  She\r\n\r\ngave an irrelevant answer, and I said, \"Look, I did\r\n\r\nnot  ask  you that yet. I am asking you  about  the\r\n\r\ncondition  of the man, because I am concerned  with\r\n\r\nhis  condition. If he had conked off, I would  have\r\n\r\nlost   a  very  important  man  in  my  area.

I  then\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"All  right,  I will see your  Sister.\"  She\r\n\r\nreplied,  \"Go and see the Sister if you  want  to.\"\r\n\r\nThat  sort  of  attitude, Sir, is  very  bad.

The nature of human beings is  such\r\n\r\nthat  until  they  see  quite clearly  demonstrated\r\n\r\nbeyond all doubt that we mean business, we will get\r\n\r\nthis  kind of slackness creeping back. It will help\r\n\r\nto  improve the standard of courtesy if we run some\r\n\r\nkind of training courses for the civil servants. In\r\n\r\nfact, I am having discussions with the Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe Public Service Commission and Mr Devan Nair to\r\n\r\nsee  which  sectors of the civil service should  go\r\n\r\nthrough  some kind of residential training  course,\r\n\r\nand,  what  should be the content of  the  training\r\n\r\ncourses.  I  accept the proposition that  something\r\n\r\npretty  stern and energetic should be done, and  it\r\n\r\nwill be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Political Study Centre and the\r\n\r\nPermanent  Examinations Board, we are  now  at  the\r\n\r\ncrossroads. As the old Political Study  Centre  has\r\n\r\nserved  its  purpose, we need something to  replace\r\n\r\nit.  To be quite candid, the Permanent Examinations\r\n\r\nBoard  is  something of a mystery to me.  Some  ten\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  I tried to introduce some  reforms  in\r\n\r\nthis rather Byzantine institution. I got the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Alexandra - at least he is now the Member  for\r\n\r\nAlexandra   -   as  a  member  of   the   Permanent\r\n\r\nExaminations Board; my colleague, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth, was also a member. But their membership  of\r\n\r\nthis  august institution did not make the slightest\r\n\r\ndifference to proceedings. Quite frankly, I believe\r\n\r\nthat   the  courses  of  training  prescribed   are\r\n\r\nirrelevant, They are totally useless for  efficient\r\n\r\ncivil  service  administration. I  have  asked  the\r\n\r\nBritish  High Commission to send a Treasury  expert\r\n\r\nto  have  a  look  at our training system  and  see\r\n\r\nwhether   we  cannot  introduce  twentieth  century\r\n\r\nsystems  in  our  civil service  training,  and  no\r\n\r\ndoubt,  in due course of time, we will get results.\r\n\r\nMore than that I do not think I need say, except to\r\n\r\nassure Back-benchers, that we will do something  to\r\n\r\nimprove the standards of our civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of\r\n\r\nMadam Chan Choy Siong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead\r\n\r\n1501.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> I am not moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1651.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the salary code of this post of\r\n\r\nDirector  of the new Industry Department, it  leads\r\n\r\nme  to  the  conclusion that this is  an  important\r\n\r\ndepartment,  as  the name implies.

These are functions exercised by the Ministry.\r\n\r\nAfter  processing, the applications are sent to  me\r\n\r\nfor decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board is purely a\r\n\r\npromotion  agency,  which is to sell  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nforeign investors and to sell foreign investors  to\r\n\r\nme.  Naturally  they will give  the  most  euphoric\r\n\r\naccount  of  any proposition which  they  get  from\r\n\r\noverseas, and naturally they will sell Singapore in\r\n\r\nthe  most glowing terms to foreign investors.  That\r\n\r\nis the nature of their work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But between the industrial promotion people and\r\n\r\nme, there is need for a rational assessment of what\r\n\r\nthe  Economic  Development Board sends  up  to  me.\r\n\r\nQuite often I have to do this assessment myself. Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  if  you have to read a memorandum  running\r\n\r\nto, say,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20  pages  in  single spacing, this  can  be  quite\r\n\r\ntiresome, quite apart from the fact that I  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  the  time  to check on the myriads  of  facts\r\n\r\nincluded  in  the  memorandum.  Therefore,  it   is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  a  body  of  officials  to   assess\r\n\r\nE.D.B.'s  proposals and to submit their  assessment\r\n\r\nto  me,  so  that  I  can get a fair  and  balanced\r\n\r\naccount   of   whether   the  particular   projects\r\n\r\nrecommended by the E.D.B. have, in fact, the merits\r\n\r\nwhich they claim. This is to be fair to the E.D.B.,\r\n\r\nto  be fair to the foreign investor, and to be fair\r\n\r\nto the economy of Singapore. That is the reason why\r\n\r\nthis new department is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, of course, this work is already being\r\n\r\ndone in the Ministry, but on a rather ad hoc basis.\r\n\r\nWe  have  quite a number of chemical  engineers  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  mechanical engineers, and they are  doing\r\n\r\nthis  kind  of  assessment. But  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nformalise  the  structure of  work  into  a  proper\r\n\r\ndepartment, and this is what this new subhead seeks\r\n\r\nto do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for head 0401 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead\r\n\r\n2007\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr\r\n\r\nNg Kah Ting.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will observe that there is already an\r\n\r\nitem of expenditure called \"Entertainment Expenses\"\r\n\r\nunder   the  grouping,  \"Other  Charges,   Annually\r\n\r\nRecurrent\" in the estimates of every Ministry  and,\r\n\r\nin   some  cases,  important  departments  in   the\r\n\r\nMinistry. This annual provision varies from $12,000\r\n\r\nfor  the Prime Minister's Office to $1,800 for  the\r\n\r\nPublic Works Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is now a new item called\r\n\r\n\"Entertainment Expenses for Permanent Secretary\" to\r\n\r\nbe  found  in  the  same grouping.  This  provision\r\n\r\nvaries  from $1,200 for the Permanent Secretary  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Culture to $5,400  for  the  two\r\n\r\nPermanent  Secretaries in the Ministry of  Interior\r\n\r\nand Defence. Sir, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  the  breakdown figures of these two items  of\r\n\r\nentertainment expenses, but I do not intend to take\r\n\r\nup   the   time   of   the  Committee   of   Supply\r\n\r\nunnecessarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe some of us might have read a report in\r\n\r\nbold  headlines in an afternoon newspaper some days\r\n\r\nago,  that  it cost the Government $2  million  per\r\n\r\nyear in clothing and entertainment. Sir, on the one\r\n\r\nhand,  we  are asking our common workers  to  forgo\r\n\r\ntheir claims for fringe benefits, and, on the other\r\n\r\nhand,  we are pampering the top civil servants  too\r\n\r\nmuch  -  if  I  may  be allowed  to  use  the  word\r\n\r\n\"pampering\".  But that is not quite  my  point.  My\r\n\r\npoint  is  on the necessity of providing  this  new\r\n\r\nvote  specifically  for Permanent  Secretaries.  If\r\n\r\nindeed the Permanent Secretaries, in the course  of\r\n\r\ntheir   duty,   are   called  upon   to   entertain\r\n\r\ndistinguished  officials  from  abroad,   such   an\r\n\r\nexpenditure  can be charged against the appropriate\r\n\r\nvote   already  provided  for  the  Ministry.   The\r\n\r\nalternative, therefore, is to increase the vote  to\r\n\r\nmeet the additional expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister for Finance would like to\r\n\r\nenlighten  the  House on why  it  is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nprovide this new vote in the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think my colleague, the\r\n\r\nMember for Mountbatten, has covered this topic very\r\n\r\nwell and leaves me with little area to cover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a new expenditure that will\r\n\r\nhenceforth  appear in the Estimates. For  how  long\r\n\r\nthis item will appear I do not know, because it  is\r\n\r\nbeing  charged under the grouping, \"Other  Charges,\r\n\r\nAnnually Recurrent\". Under this vote, all Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretaries will be given entertainment expenses. I\r\n\r\ndo not know whether or not this is an expense to be\r\n\r\nincurred  in the course of their duties, as  it  is\r\n\r\njust  charged  to \"Entertainment Expenses\".  But  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  know how much this will  cost  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer  each year. No doubt in some  quarters  it\r\n\r\nhas  been speculated to be $2 million, but I do not\r\n\r\nthink so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is this: is it right or not to give\r\n\r\nPermanent     Secretaries    such     entertainment\r\n\r\nallowances? Invariably we are going to  follow  the\r\n\r\npractice  in commercial firms, where top executives\r\n\r\nenjoy  certain perks, i.e., expense accounts,  etc.\r\n\r\nBut  this  item  is  an expenditure  on  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice,   in  which  every  cent  to  be  expended\r\n\r\nrequires  the  sanction  of  Parliament.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  Government should at all times  be  on  the\r\n\r\nalert  to  see  that monies requiring  Parliament's\r\n\r\nblessing are wisely and worthily spent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Finance will care to\r\n\r\ncomment these remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this new practice of allowing Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretaries an entertainment vote is in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the  recommendations of the  Harvey  Salaries\r\n\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me dispose of this $2 million\r\n\r\nnonsense on entertainment. I do ask Members not  to\r\n\r\ngive  too  much credence to what they read  in  the\r\n\r\nlocal  newspapers. Most of the $2  million  is  for\r\n\r\nuniforms of the Police and the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to these entertainment expenses, there are\r\n\r\ntwo  points.  One is that there is an entertainment\r\n\r\nallowance given to a person; and whether he  spends\r\n\r\nit  or  not,  that  is his business.  This  is  the\r\n\r\npractice   in   some   institutions   or   business\r\n\r\ncompanies.  The  other is the  entertainment  vote.\r\n\r\nHere,  you  can only make use of the money  if  you\r\n\r\nproduce the vouchers for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, would it be a waste of money? In my opinion,\r\n\r\nno.  In  my  view,  our Permanent  Secretaries  are\r\n\r\ngrossly  underpaid in relation to the  duties  they\r\n\r\nperform  and in relation to the pay that  they  can\r\n\r\nget  in  the  private sector. A managing  director,\r\n\r\nbearing  a  quarter  of the responsibilities  of  a\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretary of a large Ministry, gets  four\r\n\r\ntimes his pay. And if we grudge the top echelons of\r\n\r\nour civil service their minor perks, then I fear we\r\n\r\nhave  to put up with mediocrities - people who  are\r\n\r\nless  dependable possibly - and the end result will\r\n\r\nbe a greater waste than this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelatively small sum that we are setting aside  for\r\n\r\nthe entertainment vote for Permanent Secretaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I am not suggesting that we should abolish\r\n\r\nthis   new  item  of  expenditure  altogether.

At present the uniforms are  made  of\r\n\r\nthick  cotton material, which is warm to  wear  and\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  iron.

He sustained injuries and  he\r\n\r\ndrew  this  allowance. Widows who receive  a  basic\r\n\r\npension  below the minimum rate of $180  per  month\r\n\r\nunder  the  Widows and Orphans Pension Scheme  also\r\n\r\nreceive  these  allowances which are  made  on  compassionate  grounds.

This is a throw-back to the  past  when\r\n\r\ncivil  servants seem to have had the cost-of-living\r\n\r\nallowances as well as the Singapore allowances.  At\r\n\r\nthat  time,  when  these people retired,  if  their\r\n\r\npension was below a certain level, they drew  these\r\n\r\nallowances in addition to their pension.

Though this sum allocated\r\n\r\nfor the Singapore Civil Service Association is only\r\n\r\n$200  per month, it is necessary for us to see that\r\n\r\nit  is  well spent. My fear is that the Association\r\n\r\nwill  not utilise such allocation to expand  itself\r\n\r\nto  serve the deserving civil servants for whom  it\r\n\r\nis  supposed to cater. As the Association functions\r\n\r\ntoday,  it caters only for a small group  of  civil\r\n\r\nservants   who   are   regular   patrons   of   the\r\n\r\nAssociation.

However,  like  all  matters\r\n\r\nconnected  with  the civil service, this  provision\r\n\r\nhas  a  history. In this instance, it goes back  to\r\n\r\nbefore World War II. Before World War II, there was\r\n\r\na  canteen  in  Empress Place and this  Association\r\n\r\napparently was either the owner or the landlord  of\r\n\r\nthis  canteen and it received from the hawkers,  or\r\n\r\nwhoever operated there, an income of $200 a  month.\r\n\r\nThis  canteen  was demolished and  the  Association\r\n\r\nlost  this income. The Government, therefore, makes\r\n\r\nup   for  this  loss  of  income.  I  assume   that\r\n\r\nGovernment took over the land where the canteen was\r\n\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the Association is well run or not and\r\n\r\nwhether  it  deserves  this sum  -  these  are  not\r\n\r\nmatters for me to express an opinion on.

This  Charter and a  Joint  Declaration\r\n\r\nmade  by  the three organisations was witnessed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance and the then Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour. The National Trades Union Congress and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Employers Federation recognised that,  in\r\n\r\norder  to overcome the initial difficulties of  our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  programme,   the   partners   in\r\n\r\nindustry,  namely, the workers, employers  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  must co-operate with one  another  and\r\n\r\npool  their  efforts together so as  to  achieve  a\r\n\r\ncontinuing increase in productivity and  output  in\r\n\r\nall industrial enterprises. It was also accepted by\r\n\r\nthe  three partners that higher productivity should\r\n\r\nresult in better wages and working conditions,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlower   prices   for   consumer  goods,   continuing\r\n\r\nexpansion   of   production, capacity   and   full\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was felt that, in order to translate the\r\n\r\nCharter  for Industrial Progress subscribed  to  by\r\n\r\nthe  Employers  Federation and the National  Trades\r\n\r\nUnion  Congress  into  concrete  action  which  can\r\n\r\nproduce  practical results, a Productivity Code  of\r\n\r\nPractice  was also drawn up. The Productivity  Code\r\n\r\nof   Practice   subscribed  to  by  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nEmployers Federation and the National Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress  provides for the establishment  of  joint\r\n\r\nProductivity  Consultative Councils  in  industrial\r\n\r\nestablishments employing more than 50 workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was felt that the implementation of this\r\n\r\nProductivity   Code   of  Practice   will   require\r\n\r\nconsiderable   promotional  effort   as   well   as\r\n\r\ntechnical assistance, especially in the application\r\n\r\nof  work study, quality control, cost analysis  and\r\n\r\nother modern industrial engineering techniques.  To\r\n\r\nassist  in  these purposes, the Singapore  National\r\n\r\nProductivity Centre with an advisory board on which\r\n\r\nworkers, employers and the Government are  equally\r\n\r\nrepresented was established. Incidentally, Sir, the\r\n\r\nNational  Productivity Centre in Singapore  is  the\r\n\r\nonly productivity organisation in this region which\r\n\r\nwas   established  as  a  result  of  trade   union\r\n\r\ninitiation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the inception of the National Productivity\r\n\r\nCentre,  it  has  made some, but  not  substantial,\r\n\r\nachievements in its promotional effort  of  setting\r\n\r\nup  Joint Productivity Consultative Councils in the\r\n\r\nvarious industries in Singapore. In this respect, I\r\n\r\ncan  safely  say  that  the  National  Productivity\r\n\r\nCentre  has  failed  in  instilling  the  need  and\r\n\r\nimportance    of    forming   Joint    Productivity\r\n\r\nConsultative Councils in all our industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Productivity Centre organises a\r\n\r\nnumber of courses in work study, job evaluation and\r\n\r\nincentives, management   techniques,   production\r\n\r\nplanning   control,   office  management   methods,\r\n\r\nworkers' education and so on. To a limited  extent,\r\n\r\nit provides advisory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservices.  I  must  express the  gratitude  of  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. for  the  co-operation  of  the  National\r\n\r\nProductivity  Centre in organising similar  courses\r\n\r\nfor   trade  union  officials  affiliated  to   the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C.  The trade union movement is also grateful\r\n\r\nto  the National Productivity Centre for the advice\r\n\r\nwe  get  sometimes. It is, however, to be regretted\r\n\r\nthat  the  Centre  has either  failed  or  has  not\r\n\r\nattempted to convince the employers of the need  to\r\n\r\nset up joint consultative machinery between workers\r\n\r\nand  employers  for  the  purpose  of  facilitating\r\n\r\ngreater cooperation and promoting productivity.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  the training courses have  not  been\r\n\r\nmatched  with  practical schemes for  putting  into\r\n\r\npractice the principles taught in the courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the training courses, the National\r\n\r\nProductivity  Centre seems to be  preoccupied  with\r\n\r\nsuch   matters   as   industrial   relations,   the\r\n\r\nrecruitment of staff for industries, assisting  the\r\n\r\nemployers in industrial training programmes,  etc.,\r\n\r\nmatters   which   strictly  are  not   related   to\r\n\r\nproductivity.  The  National  Productivity   Centre\r\n\r\nseems to have forgotten the fundamental purpose for\r\n\r\nwhich  it was set up. Certainly it was not  set  up\r\n\r\nfor  the purpose of recruiting workers or assisting\r\n\r\nin the training of workers for industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Productivity Centre has an Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil consisting of representatives from workers,\r\n\r\nemployers and the Government. This Council was  set\r\n\r\nup in December 1967, and I shall be grateful if the\r\n\r\nMinister in charge can enlighten this House on  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of times that the Council has met to advise\r\n\r\nthe National Productivity Centre. Sir, I raise this\r\n\r\nquestion   because   my   organisation   is    also\r\n\r\nrepresented in the Council and I am told  that  the\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Council exists only in name  and  it  has\r\n\r\nnever   been   convened  to  advise  the   National\r\n\r\nProductivity  Centre. Also in  1968,  an  elaborate\r\n\r\nconstitution  of Works Councils was drawn  up  with\r\n\r\nappropriate comments and suggestions from the trade\r\n\r\nunions  and  the employers' organisations.  I  fear\r\n\r\nthat the model constitution of Works Councils still\r\n\r\nremains a model. I would also like to know\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  the Minister how many industries in Singapore\r\n\r\nhave   been   assisted  by  the  N.P.C. to   form\r\n\r\nproductivity councils or Works Councils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my hope that from now onwards, the N.P.C.\r\n\r\nwill  be  fully responsible for promoting  and  co-ordinating   the  productivity  movement   in   the\r\n\r\nRepublic.

So much emphasis  is\r\n\r\nbeing placed on higher productivity these days.  In\r\n\r\nfact, the Member for Telok Blangah has provided  me\r\n\r\nwith  some  useful information. As  far  as  I  can\r\n\r\ngather, the only report on the work and progress of\r\n\r\nthe   National  Productivity  Centre  was  a  short\r\n\r\nstatement  in  the annual report  of  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board for the year ending 1967. I would\r\n\r\nlike to find out from the Minister, as this sum  of\r\n\r\n$663,000 for the Centre is the first time  that  it\r\n\r\nappears  in the Estimates, whether the Director  of\r\n\r\nthe  National Productivity Centre will  present  to\r\n\r\nParliament  an annual report of its activities  for\r\n\r\neach  year  or  will it be included in  the  annual\r\n\r\nreport of the E.D.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> To answer the Member for Kampong Kapor first. I\r\n\r\nintend   to  establish  the  National  Productivity\r\n\r\nCentre  as  an autonomous organisation, independent\r\n\r\nof the Economic Development Board. I think the past\r\n\r\ninadequacies  of the N.P.C. were due  to  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat it was part of the Economic Development Board;\r\n\r\nstaff  were  appointed  by  the  E.D.B. and   were\r\n\r\nresponsible to it. Since the E.D.B. was  interested\r\n\r\nmore in promotion - getting in touch with potential\r\n\r\ninvestors and seeing that they start something here\r\n\r\n-  than  in  follow-up work such as maintenance  of\r\n\r\nefficiency  in industries in Singapore, the  result\r\n\r\nhas   been   neglect  by  the  E.D.B. of   N.P.C.\r\n\r\nactivities. There has been clear evidence that  the\r\n\r\nN.P.C. has suffered from such neglect. Therefore, I\r\n\r\npropose  that  the  N.P.C. be  established  as  an\r\n\r\norganisation independent of the E.D.B. How  and  in\r\n\r\nwhat form the N.P.C. will be reorganised remains to\r\n\r\nbe  seen.  There is in Singapore an expert  in  the\r\n\r\nfield of management consultants, sent by the United\r\n\r\nNations, whose job it is to evaluate in some  depth\r\n\r\nthe   working   of  the  N.P.C. and   its   future\r\n\r\norganisation  structure. As a result  of  this,  no\r\n\r\ndoubt something useful will be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I can best illustrate the difficulties\r\n\r\nand  handicaps suffered by the N.P.C. by giving  an\r\n\r\naccount   of  actual  assignments  which,   to   my\r\n\r\nknowledge,   the  N.P.C. undertook.   These   were\r\n\r\nassignments commissioned by me. I asked the  N.P.C.\r\n\r\nto do a study of systems of baggage handling at the\r\n\r\nairport  to  see  where the hold-up  was,  and  how\r\n\r\nmatters  could be improved. The N.P.C. has quite  a\r\n\r\ntalented  team of engineers and it is a  pity  that\r\n\r\nthese  talented  young men and  women  are  wasting\r\n\r\ntheir time because of absence of proper guidance of\r\n\r\nleadership.  But  anyway  they  did  the  study  of\r\n\r\nbaggage  handling in the airport. I thought  it  an\r\n\r\nexcellent   study,  and  so  did  the   authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned,   and   they   are   implementing    the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the N.P.C. with the result  that\r\n\r\nthere has been a marked improvement in the rate  at\r\n\r\nwhich passengers are being handled at the passenger\r\n\r\nterminals  through all the formalities of  customs,\r\n\r\nimmigration,  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhealth  and  so on. Of  course,  this  is  a\r\n\r\ncontinuing programme of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second assignment which the N.P.C. undertook\r\n\r\nwas  to  study  systems of wage incentives  in  the\r\n\r\nJurong   Abattoir,   which   was   established   by\r\n\r\nGovernment  at great cost with technical assistance\r\n\r\nfrom  Danish Government. It is under the charge  of\r\n\r\nmy  colleague,  the Minister for Law  and  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment. The N.P.C. productivity study was sent\r\n\r\nto  the  appropriate department, in this  case  the\r\n\r\nPrimary  Production  Department.  The  Director  of\r\n\r\nPrimary  Production  was  not  convinced  that  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations had any value. Whether he is  right\r\n\r\nor  the  N.P.C. is right, I do not know. It is  not\r\n\r\nfor me to say. But in this instance the work proved\r\n\r\nnegative.  Whether  it is that the  recommendations\r\n\r\nwere unrealistic or whether it is that the Director\r\n\r\ncould   not   understand  the  recommendations   is\r\n\r\nsomething  on  which I would not  comment,  but  it\r\n\r\nillustrates the difficulties under which the  staff\r\n\r\nof  the N.P.C. have to work. First, the employer or\r\n\r\nthe industrialist or whosoever it is has a problem,\r\n\r\nmust believe it can be solved by the application of\r\n\r\ntime and motion study or whatever remedy the N.P.C.\r\n\r\nstaff  are capable of working out. If the employer,\r\n\r\nor  the  owner,  or  the  industrialist,  does  not\r\n\r\nbelieve   that   the  N.P.C. can   make   such   a\r\n\r\ncontribution, then he will not make  use  of  these\r\n\r\nservices.  Since quite a number of  our  industries\r\n\r\nare  small-scale industries where capital is rather\r\n\r\nscarce,  and  where the owner or the  industrialist\r\n\r\nimprovises as best he can, clearly there are limits\r\n\r\nto  which the services of the National Productivity\r\n\r\nCentre can be put. This again helps to explain  the\r\n\r\nreluctance  of  employers to  use  these  services.\r\n\r\nMaybe  the  employers  are  wrong,  or  maybe   the\r\n\r\nemployers are old-fashioned or ignorant. Or it  may\r\n\r\nbe  that  in  most  instances the N.P.C. has  very\r\n\r\nlittle to offer and that employers either solve the\r\n\r\nproblems with their own staff or engage experts  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them. If that is so, we probably have to find\r\n\r\na  different  role  for  the National  Productivity\r\n\r\nCentre. As the Member for Telok\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlangah  has said, a major effort is being  mounted\r\n\r\nthrough  the  United Nations Development  Programme\r\n\r\nspecial  fund  project  to improve  the  staff  and\r\n\r\nexpand the scope of services of the N.P.C. We  hope\r\n\r\nthat they will succeed. I am sure the N.T.U.C. will\r\n\r\noffer its unstinting support to the N.P.C., because\r\n\r\nif  we  could  improve production  systems  in  our\r\n\r\nindustry,  then  both the employer and  the  worker\r\n\r\nstand  a  lot  to gain from it. More  than  this  I\r\n\r\ncannot say, other than that my Ministry and  I  are\r\n\r\nplacing  a  lot of importance and emphasis  on  the\r\n\r\nfuture  activities  of  the  National  Productivity\r\n\r\nCentre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

It consists  of\r\n\r\na  conglomeration of workshops and various training\r\n\r\ncentres  which  the E D.B. set up since  the  early\r\n\r\n1960s.  Like Topsy, this work centre just grew  and\r\n\r\ngrew, and eventually the E.D.B. found that they had\r\n\r\nsomething  like six centres. First,  there  is  the\r\n\r\nMetal    Industries   Development   Centre,   which\r\n\r\nconcentrates  on metal engineering  services.  Then\r\n\r\nthere  is  the  Prototype Production  and  Training\r\n\r\nCentre.  This  is the result of a gift  of  machine\r\n\r\ntools  donated  by  the Japanese  Government.  Then\r\n\r\nthere is the Electro-Mechanical Training Centre.  I\r\n\r\ncannot remember who donated this equipment. I think\r\n\r\nit  is  the  French Government. Then there  is  the\r\n\r\nElectro-Chemical Engineering Centre. I am not quite\r\n\r\nsure  what it deals with, but they dip metals  into\r\n\r\nchemicals. Then there is the Woodworking Industries\r\n\r\nDevelopment Centre. Finally there is the  Precision\r\n\r\nEngineering Development Centre. These six workshops\r\n\r\ncombine together under a loose organisation  called\r\n\r\nthe Engineering Industries Development Agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can see, everybody works with\r\n\r\ntremendous  enthusiasm and energy. But  I  get  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that there is a distinct  lack  of  co-ordination among the six centres in the absence  of\r\n\r\nany  clear  definition of the role that  they  will\r\n\r\nplay  in  our industrialisation programme.  So  the\r\n\r\nprocess of tightening the organisation and spelling\r\n\r\nout  the  roles  and functions of  these  different\r\n\r\nunits has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoing on in my Ministry for a long time.\r\n\r\nWe have not reached a final solution \r\n\r\nyet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roughly these workshops do two\r\n\r\nthings. First, they train people in certain\r\n\r\nskills, whether it is in machine tools,\r\n\r\nin woodworking, in chemical treatment\r\n\r\nof metals, or in fine engineering. But\r\n\r\nwhatever it is, they train people. They\r\n\r\nrecruit students or employees who are\r\n\r\nwilling to upgrade their skills, and train\r\n\r\nthem for six months to a year, depending\r\n\r\non the course and the field of\r\n\r\nspecializsation. That is one function - training.\r\n\r\nSecond, they produce components for the\r\n\r\nlocal industry, ie., metal\r\n\r\nparts and so on. I believe they even tried\r\n\r\nto make simple machine tools for the Technical\r\n\r\nDepartment of the Ministry of Education. I do not\r\n\r\nknow if the Technical Department bought these\r\n\r\nmachine tools. Nevertheless this is the\r\n\r\nsort of work they do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, a lot of energy goes into\r\n\r\nthis. These centres are quite active and \r\n\r\nbusy, particularly the Precision Engineering \r\n\r\nDevelopment Centre which is going\r\n\r\nup in Jurong. This development centre\r\n\r\nis quite impressive. They are spending\r\n\r\na sizable sum of money, as a result of \r\n\r\nwhich I am told that some industries \r\n\r\nwill be established in Singapore to turn\r\n\r\nout products that require precise\r\n\r\nengineering, such as micrometer\r\n\r\ngauges and possibly certain\r\n\r\ntypes of technical instruments. That is\r\n\r\nwhat they do, and this is the way they are\r\n\r\ndoing it, a bit haphazard no doubt.\r\n\r\nBut the organisation will be tightened,\r\n\r\nand I think we will get better results and\r\n\r\nbetter value for money in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0403\r\n\r\nbe reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2127.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, subhead 2127 is an item calling\r\n\r\nfor a sum of $ 1\ufffd million for Industrial \r\n\r\nTraining.

The subsidy\r\n\r\nfor Sembawang Shipyard is really meant\r\n\r\nto retrain employees of the former \r\n\r\nBritish Naval Dockyard, now known as\r\n\r\nSembawang Shipyard, for other useful\r\n\r\nwork. Subhead 2127 is concerned with\r\n\r\nthe training programmed for the Jurong\r\n\r\nshipbuilders, the company which will \r\n\r\nbuild ocean-going freighters in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members will know, we do not build\r\n\r\nbig ships in Singapore. We only build \r\n\r\nships of a few hundred tons - water-boats,\r\n\r\ntugs, and so on. So if we want to \r\n\r\ngo into the big league and produce\r\n\r\nocean-going vessels, we have to train\r\n\r\nthe neccessary skills. This is being done in\r\n\r\nconjunction with the Ishikawajima-Harima\r\n\r\nHeavy Industries, or I.H.I. for short.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have 249 of our citizens\r\n\r\nunder training in Japan.

First, how much\r\n\r\nsavings have been collected from\r\n\r\nstudents last year, and how many\r\n\r\naccounts have been opened? Second,\r\n\r\nhow long does his Ministry intend to\r\n\r\ncontinue contributing towards such gift\r\n\r\naccounts? Third, as at last year, what\r\n\r\nis the percentage of the number of savings\r\n\r\naccounts opened as against the\r\n\r\ntotal school population?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minster for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minster for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin order to give an adequate reply to \r\n\r\nthe Member for Punggol, it may be\r\n\r\nneccessary for me to state that this question\r\n\r\nof postal savings in schools has to be\r\n\r\ndivided into two sections, although\r\n\r\nthe point he has raised is in respect of\r\n\r\ngift accounts. so I will try to give the\r\n\r\nfirst section for his edification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We started a campaign for schools'\r\n\r\nsavings beginning in January 1969. With\r\n\r\nthe full co-operation of the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation, that is to say, officials, principals\r\n\r\nand teachers, we were able to\r\n\r\nget 486 out of 511 schools, or 95 per cent,\r\n\r\nto participate in the savings campaign.\r\n\r\nMore that 144,000 students opened\r\n\r\nsavings accounts, and this represents 28\r\n\r\nper cent of the total school population.\r\n\r\nwhich exceeds half a million. The\r\n\r\namount saved was more than $1.2 million,\r\n\r\na very significant sum. The only\r\n\r\npeople who do grumble are the hawkers\r\n\r\nin the school tuckshops, because this\r\n\r\nwas the sum of money they did not get,\r\n\r\nbut is nicely tucked away in our\r\n\r\nSavings Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular subhead brought up\r\n\r\nby the Member refers to special savings\r\n\r\ngift accounts for Secondary I students\r\n\r\nin particular. This is what you call a gift\r\n\r\naccount. If a Secondary I student has a \r\n\r\nminimum sum of $5 in his P.O.S.B. \r\n\r\naccount, then Government will donate\r\n\r\n$5 to make it $10. But there is a little\r\n\r\ncatch here. It is not possible for the\r\n\r\nstudent to withdraw the $10 the next day\r\n\r\nand so have a good time with it.\r\n\r\nIt has to be kept in the Savings Bank\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor the next five years. Of course, there\r\n\r\nwill be the four per cent interest credited\r\n\r\nto his account. The idea is to\r\n\r\nkeep it in cold storage for five years,\r\n\r\nso that when he leaves secondary school,\r\n\r\nhe will then have $10 plus the four per\r\n\r\ncent interest accumulated for the last\r\n\r\nfive years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid this campaign did not\r\n\r\nquite succeed during the course of last\r\n\r\nyear. For the last 14\ufffd months, that is to say, from January 1969 to the middle of March 1970, there were only 4,290\r\n\r\naccounts, and the sum contributed by \r\n\r\nGovernment was $5 times this number,\r\n\r\nwhich is $21,450. This year we hope\r\n\r\nto step up the campaign to encourage\r\n\r\nmore of our Secondary I students to\r\n\r\nsave. As you can see, we have a provision\r\n\r\nof $156,000 for this year. I have\r\n\r\nindicated just now that we have handed\r\n\r\nout only $21,450. But I think that, with\r\n\r\na little extra effort this year, we might\r\n\r\nbe able to utilise fully this provision of $156,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I thank the\r\n\r\nMinister for his replies to my questions, but\r\n\r\nI have supplementary questions to \r\n\r\nask.

The reason is that for\r\n\r\nprimary school students, there is a course of six years,\r\n\r\nwhereas for those in secondary schools there is a course\r\n\r\nof only four years, with another two years in \r\n\r\nthe upper secondary. Why cannot we induce children to start saving\r\n\r\nin the Post Office Savings Bank right\r\n\r\nfrom the moment they enter school?

I  feel   that\r\n\r\nlethargy has set in among the officers and staff of\r\n\r\nthe People's Association Headquarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community centres in Singapore have done a\r\n\r\nwonderful job and are continuing to do so. However,\r\n\r\nI  feel  that  the headquarters of these  community\r\n\r\ncentres, that is, the People's Association, is  not\r\n\r\ndoing  as  much  as  it can do at  the  moment.  It\r\n\r\nappears   that   the  objective  of  the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation recently has been only to put up  shows\r\n\r\nof  one  type  or another in order  to  create  the\r\n\r\nimpression that it is active or to create a  public\r\n\r\nimage for itself. It has not undertaken any project\r\n\r\nfor  mass participation. The community centre staff\r\n\r\nare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleft  to  fend  for  themselves in  many  community\r\n\r\ncentres. They do not receive much guidance, if any,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  specialist sections in  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation,  such  as  the Cultural  Section,  the\r\n\r\nSports Section, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Specialist Professional Units do\r\n\r\nnot offer any guidance or assistance to\r\n\r\nthe community centre staff. The Cultural\r\n\r\nSection  is only interested in organising  cultural\r\n\r\nshows at the People's Association level, but not in\r\n\r\nhelping  the community centres with their expertise\r\n\r\nand  experience, with the result that the community\r\n\r\ncentres do not organise cultural\r\n\r\nactivities of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same can be said for the Sports Section. Many community centres are interested in, say, the coaching of basketball. It\r\n\r\nis possible for the People's Association  to  organise coaching sessions  for  a number of centres whose residents may be interested in the game. What  happens now, I am told, is that the community\r\n\r\ncentre is expected to organise the coaching on its own and\r\n\r\nthat the People's Association pays for the fees  of\r\n\r\nthe  coach,  irrespective of whether he coaches  10\r\n\r\npersons  or  30 persons in basketball. If  properly\r\n\r\norganised, money can be saved by combining training\r\n\r\nand coaching sessions for a number of centres which\r\n\r\ncan be conveniently grouped together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I myself have seen community centre staff not doing as much as they can do in a number of community centres. They have been\r\n\r\ncriticised for their lack of initiative, indifference, idleness and  arrogance by one of their supervisors, as reported in the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation news bulletin recently. May I inquire\r\n\r\nwhether  this  warning given by the supervisor  has\r\n\r\nresulted  in  any  improvement  of  performance  or\r\n\r\ndiscipline, or whether the People's Association has\r\n\r\ntaken  any steps to improve the situation  and,  if\r\n\r\nso, what are the steps taken? I sincerely hope that\r\n\r\nthe  Association has not taken the easy way out  by\r\n\r\nforgetting the whole matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now come to the establishment of community\r\n\r\ncentres,   a  matter  which  certainly  illustrates\r\n\r\nanother  area  of  lethargy  on  the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssociation.  Sir, the islanders of  Pulau  Blakang\r\n\r\nMati  were  promised  a  community  centre  by  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association about four years ago.  A  site\r\n\r\nwas  selected  and marked out for the  building  of\r\n\r\nthis  community centre. I believe tenders were also\r\n\r\ncalled for the construction of the centre. However,\r\n\r\nfor  one  reason or another, to date this community\r\n\r\ncentre has not been built,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1968 when I was elected Member of Parliament\r\n\r\nfor  Telok  Blangah, which included  Pulau  Blakang\r\n\r\nMati,  I raised the question of a community  centre\r\n\r\nfor  the island. I was told that no capital  outlay\r\n\r\ninvolving large sums of money could be approved for\r\n\r\nthis  purpose However, with much difficulty  I  was\r\n\r\nable  to  persuade  the Bases  Economic  Conversion\r\n\r\nDepartment   to   release  a  building, centrally\r\n\r\nlocated,  for  use as a community  centre  for  the\r\n\r\nisland.  Two  families who occupied  this  building\r\n\r\nwere persuaded to move out and preparatory work for\r\n\r\nthe  conversion of this building into a  community\r\n\r\ncentre  commenced .I believe the  Director  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association and other senior staff visited\r\n\r\nthe site a few times. Tenders were called for. From\r\n\r\nthe  activities  that went on, the  islanders  this\r\n\r\ntime were hopeful that at last they were going  to\r\n\r\nhave a community centre. However, the last official\r\n\r\ncommunication  I had from the People's  Association\r\n\r\nregarding  the community centre was  on  5th  June.\r\n\r\n1969, when the People's Association requested  the\r\n\r\nPublic   Works  Department  to  call  for  tenders.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, I made numerous inquiries and I was told\r\n\r\nthat  the cost of conversion of the building for  a\r\n\r\ncommunity centre would be more than $4,000 and that\r\n\r\nthe People's Association had only approved $4,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had on numerous occasions spoken to the\r\n\r\nofficials  of  the People's Association,  informing\r\n\r\nthem of the special need for a community centre  at\r\n\r\nPulau  Blakang  Mati  and that a  community  centre\r\n\r\ncould   be  started  with  even  less  than  $4,000\r\n\r\napproved  for  that purpose, since a  building  was\r\n\r\navailable  and  work was partially completed.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe People's Association was not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimpressed with my representation. The islanders are\r\n\r\nmaking  a big joke of the proposed community centre\r\n\r\nfor  which, they have waited for the past five  or\r\n\r\nsix  years. I believe the latest joke is that  when\r\n\r\none  of the officials  of the People's Association\r\n\r\nwent to Pulau Blakang Mati to inspect the building\r\n\r\nand  have  a chat with some of the islanders,  they\r\n\r\nshooed him off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I be told once and for all whether the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association is going to build a community\r\n\r\ncentre in Pulau Blakang Mati or not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although the officials of the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association  were not  impressed  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Telok Blangah, I can assure him that  I\r\n\r\nam  indeed  very much impressed by the presentation\r\n\r\nof  his  case.  First, I shall take up  the  second\r\n\r\npoint which he has raised, namely, the question  of\r\n\r\na  community  centre at Pulau Blakang Mati.  It  is\r\n\r\ntrue that this question was raised about five years\r\n\r\nago.  But unfortunately at that time there  was  in\r\n\r\nthe  air the question of the British withdrawal and\r\n\r\nwe  did  not  know  then how many people  would  be\r\n\r\nserved  by  this community centre. When the  matter\r\n\r\nwas  raised again by the Member, there was also the\r\n\r\nquestion of the accelerated British withdrawal, and\r\n\r\nlately  there has been competing interest  for  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  Pulau  Blakang  Mati  by   several\r\n\r\nMinistries,  and up till today we do not  know  who\r\n\r\nwill succeed in the end. Therefore, the question of\r\n\r\nhow  many residents there will be in Pulau  Blakang\r\n\r\nMati  in the end is still left open. I think it  is\r\n\r\nlargely,   for  these  reasons  that  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation is unable to vote a large sum of money,\r\n\r\nto  put  up  a  building which might be  used  only\r\n\r\ntemporarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the question of lethargy and the lack\r\n\r\nof  efficiency among members of the staff  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association. Alas, I must confess that for\r\n\r\nthe, most part, his criticism is quite valid. I have\r\n\r\nbeen   going  to  the  People's  Association  twice\r\n\r\nmonthly  trying to pump some life into  members  of\r\n\r\nthe staff. In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfact, we have expanded so much and the same problem\r\n\r\nthat faces the People's Association is also present\r\n\r\nin   other  Ministries  in  that  we  do  not  have\r\n\r\nsufficient  capable persons to run an  organisation\r\n\r\nof this nature. But I have taken remedial measures.\r\n\r\nIf  Members  will remember, organising  secretaries\r\n\r\nhave  to go through a course at the National  Youth\r\n\r\nLeadership  Training Institute in which  leadership\r\n\r\nqualities are supposed to be instilled into them so\r\n\r\nthat  they  would  act as a catalyst  for  communal\r\n\r\nactivities in the community centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime last year we reorganised the examination\r\n\r\nsystem  in  the National Youth Leadership  Training\r\n\r\nInstitute. Our observation of those who have passed\r\n\r\nand  have  been awarded diplomas after a three-year\r\n\r\ncourse  in  the National Youth Leadership  Training\r\n\r\nInstitute indicates that these people do  have  the\r\n\r\ntheoretical   knowledge   of   leading    community\r\n\r\nmovements  or  activities. But,  unfortunately,  in\r\n\r\nmany cases they lack initiative, determination  and\r\n\r\nwillingness to work; or they lack the understanding\r\n\r\nto apply theory to practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we have made a change. Whereas before\r\n\r\npasses  were awarded solely on academic  work,  the\r\n\r\npresent  system is to award 50 per cent  marks  for\r\n\r\nknowledge  of  academic work, and 50 per  cent  for\r\n\r\nother   qualities  such  as  leadership  qualities,\r\n\r\nhonesty,  application and initiative. So steps  are\r\n\r\nbeing taken to see that those who will be appointed\r\n\r\nas  organising secretaries of community  centres  - and  among them ultimately we will have supervisors\r\n\r\nand the director - will be able to apply the theory\r\n\r\nwhich  they have learnt to the work which  will  be\r\n\r\nallotted to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of coaching groups of people for\r\n\r\nsports  and  the  new system whereby  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  will  undertake to pay  the  fees  for\r\n\r\ncoaches    engaged   by   the   community   centres\r\n\r\nthemselves, this I think is largely because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have found great difficulty  in  getting\r\n\r\nsuitable  coaches direct, and also because  of  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  we face in certain sports  where  the\r\n\r\nparental  body requires affiliation to the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation before it would allow its coaches to be\r\n\r\nsent  to  the community centres. As a  way  out  of\r\n\r\nthis,  I  believe the People's Association  decided\r\n\r\nthat  the community centres on their own could form\r\n\r\na  team  and affiliate themselves to the  parental\r\n\r\nassociation.  Thus they would  be  able  to  get  a\r\n\r\ncoach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am as much concerned with the\r\n\r\nefficiency  of  the  People's  Association  as  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Telok Blangah is, and we have  in  hand\r\n\r\nsome steps which we consider taking to tighten up\r\n\r\nthe  whole organisation.

In my  experience\r\n\r\nat  the meet-the-people sessions, I have discovered\r\n\r\nthat   there  may  be  some  inadequacies  in  this\r\n\r\nprovision. For that reason, I am bringing  up  this\r\n\r\nquestion  because  it seems to me  that  by  making\r\n\r\nprovision for the education of our deaf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren, they will be less of a burden on society\r\n\r\nif  they can look after themselves, if they can  be\r\n\r\nself-reliant, or if they can even be productive. It\r\n\r\nwould  be interesting to find out what Government's\r\n\r\nopinion is and whether it might be a good idea  for\r\n\r\nGovernment  to take over entirely the  business  of\r\n\r\neducation for young children retarded in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, in answer to the question by the Member for\r\n\r\nKatong,  I  think  Government's  contribution   is\r\n\r\nenough.  As  you  know. Sir,  besides  the  $12,000\r\n\r\nannual  grant given by Government to the  Singapore\r\n\r\nAssociation  for the Deaf and Dumb, the  Government\r\n\r\nalso  pays the salary of the nine teachers for  the\r\n\r\nOral  Section, five instructors and one  assistant\r\n\r\ninstructor for the Science Section who are attached\r\n\r\nto  the  School for the Deaf in Mountbatten  Road.\r\n\r\nThe  salaries  of  these teachers  and  instructors\r\n\r\namounted  to $85,508 in 1969 and were paid  by  the\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare Department. Therefore, we  can  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  approximate annual contribution  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry to the School is $100,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School for the Deaf at Mountbatten Road is\r\n\r\nsited  on  a  piece of state land with an  area  of\r\n\r\n40,000  square feet. Recently, the Association  has\r\n\r\napplied  for the alienation of a further  piece  of\r\n\r\nland approximately l0,000 square feet adjoining the\r\n\r\nsite  of  the existing school in order to  build  a\r\n\r\nvocational  centre and workshop. This  project  has\r\n\r\nthe  support  of the Ministry, and the Commissioner\r\n\r\nof Lands has written to the Association saying that\r\n\r\nhis office is prepared to consider recommending the\r\n\r\nalienation of this land to the Association for a 30-year  lease  at  an annual rent of $12  per  annum,\r\n\r\nsubject,  of course, to planning approval.

I for one wholeheartedly welcome  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  new policy of combating  the  growing\r\n\r\nmenace  of  air  and water pollution  and  wish  to\r\n\r\nexpress my thanks to the Government for wasting  no\r\n\r\nmore   time   in   tackling  this   problem.   With\r\n\r\nurbanisation and industrialisation taking place  at\r\n\r\na   rapid  pace, and  with  irresponsible   people\r\n\r\ndisposing  of garbage, faecal, trade and industrial\r\n\r\nwaste in open grounds and water-ways, there are all\r\n\r\nthe potentials of a water pollution problem. I hope\r\n\r\nno  one  will be complacent about it and treat  the\r\n\r\nagitation  for  water  conservation  and  pollution\r\n\r\ncontrol as a passing whim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the measures the P.U.B. are proposing\r\n\r\nto  take,  can the Minister concerned,  if  he  has\r\n\r\nknowledge,  inform the House whether  the  measures\r\n\r\nare  preventive in nature or measures to remove  an\r\n\r\nexisting pollution problem? As I believe that it is\r\n\r\nhard  to  get money out of the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nunless  he  knows  it is going to be  usefully  and\r\n\r\nprofitably spent, can the Minister explain in  more\r\n\r\ndetail why he is proposing to give away this sum of\r\n\r\n$176,000 to the PUB? Is it to be used to pay for  a\r\n\r\ndevelopment  project as an anti-pollution  measure,\r\n\r\nor   is  it  going  to  be  used  for  repair   and\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of some equipment, or is it  for  some\r\n\r\ngeneral  expenses connected with the  P.U.B. anti-pollution  plan? Is this sum of $176,000 the  total\r\n\r\nP.U.B, expenditure for anti-pollution measures,  or\r\n\r\nis  it only part of the P.U.B.'s expenditure on this\r\n\r\nitem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to get some idea of the problem and I\r\n\r\nsearched the P.U.B. reports for some lead. There  was\r\n\r\na  blank.  Even the latest P.U.B. report  does  not\r\n\r\nmention   any   pollution  problem.  However,   the\r\n\r\nbrochure  commemorating  the  opening  of   Seletar\r\n\r\nReservoir last August probably points partly to the\r\n\r\ncause  of  the  problem. In the page  dealing  with\r\n\r\nrecreational  facilities in the  reservoir,  it  is\r\n\r\nsuggested  that boating, canoeing and fishing  will\r\n\r\nbe  permissible. Even the P.U.B. staff  has  got  a\r\n\r\ncanoeing  group.  On  the same  page,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nphotograph  of some Board members enjoying  a  boat\r\n\r\ntrip, including the Parliamentary Secretary to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Foreign Affairs when he was a  member\r\n\r\nof   the  Public  Utilities  Board.  Besides  these\r\n\r\nfacilities,  other facilities like  sports  ground,\r\n\r\nplayground  and  parks will be  provided.  Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister  clarify  if the sum of  $176,000  is  for\r\n\r\nclearing  up the pollution caused by activities  at\r\n\r\nthe  reservoir?  I think the P.U.B. has  recognised\r\n\r\nthe  dangers of these activities and says, I  quote\r\n\r\nfrom the brochure:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Board plans to allow boating, canoeing and fishing\r\n\r\nin  the  Reservoir  with safeguards  against  water\r\n\r\npollution.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  have  no doubt that the Public Utilities  Board,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Health and other departments  are\r\n\r\ndoing  everything possible to prevent the pollution\r\n\r\nof  our  drinking  water at Seletar  Reservoir  and\r\n\r\nother reservoirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health Annual Report, 1967 (Paper\r\n\r\nCmd.  1  of 1970) records that a survey was carried\r\n\r\nout at the Seletar Reservoir catchment area between\r\n\r\nApril  and July 1967 by the Public Health  Division\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministry in collaboration with the P.U.B.,\r\n\r\nthe  Survey  and Primary Production Departments  to\r\n\r\nlook  into  the sources of pollution of streams  in\r\n\r\nthe catchment area, The same report in page 60 says\r\n\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Under the Seletar Water Scheme, designed to tap\r\n\r\nwater  from eight catchments, a survey was  carried\r\n\r\nout to ascertain the number and sites of all houses\r\n\r\nin each catchment with a view to carrying out anti-pollution   measures  aimed  at   controlling   and\r\n\r\nreducing  the discharge of faecal matter  into  the\r\n\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContract  specifications and drawings were prepared\r\n\r\nfor  the  construction  of about  3,000  water-seal\r\n\r\nlatrines in the following year.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, I presume this job was completed last year. In\r\n\r\nthis  case, what is the real problem that a sum  of\r\n\r\n$176,000  is requested by the P.U.B. to  carry  out\r\n\r\nanti-pollution  measures at Seletar  Reservoir?  In\r\n\r\nthe  financial year 1st April, 1970, to 31st March,\r\n\r\n1971,  it  is  stated  in  the  Memorandum  on  the\r\n\r\nEstimates  of Revenue and Expenditure of  Singapore\r\n\r\n(Miscellaneous I of 1970) that there is an  overall\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the provision for the  Public  Health\r\n\r\nDivision   of   a   sum   of  $3.2   million.   The\r\n\r\nEnvironmental  Health Section gets an  increase  of\r\n\r\n$389,250  for  the proper maintenance of  catchment\r\n\r\ndrains  and an additional increase of $51, 280  for\r\n\r\nthe employment of more daily-rated staff due to the\r\n\r\nexpansion of environmental health service\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have spent $28 million for\r\n\r\nthe construction of Seletar Reservoir, and not only\r\n\r\ndo we have a maximum supply of two months' drinking\r\n\r\nwater, but we also face the danger of pollution  by\r\n\r\nour  own foolishness and inconsideration. I do hope\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   can  impress  upon   his   Cabinet\r\n\r\ncolleagues the need to carry out an intensive  and\r\n\r\ncontinuous anti-pollution campaign. It is better to\r\n\r\nspend some time and money bringing to the attention\r\n\r\nof the people the dangers of pollution and the need\r\n\r\nto  remove  the  potentials of pollution, than  to\r\n\r\nspend   huge  sums  of  money  later  to  eradicate\r\n\r\npollution itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Member for Kallang had just\r\n\r\none  simple question to ask, and whilst asking this\r\n\r\nquestion  he took the opportunity to tell  everyone\r\n\r\nhis own views about pollution. The facts are simple\r\n\r\nand,  as  the Member himself puts it, the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  does not just dish  out  $176,000  to\r\n\r\nevery Tom, Dick and Harry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly-constructed Seletar Reservoir impounds\r\n\r\nwater  not only from its own catchment area,  which\r\n\r\nis   a   protected  area,  but  also   from   eight\r\n\r\nneighbouring streams. They are Sembawang,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSembawang   Kechil,  Simpang  Kiri,  Bukit   Mandai,\r\n\r\nMandai,  Mandai  Kechil, Pang Sua and  Peng  Siang.\r\n\r\nWater  from each of these eight streams  is  pumped\r\n\r\ninto  the  reservoir.  I say \"pumped\"  because  the\r\n\r\nstreams  are  at a lower level than the  reservoir,\r\n\r\nand  in  order to get the water in the  streams  up\r\n\r\ninto  the  reservoir, pressure by way of  pumps  is\r\n\r\nused. The catchment area of these eight streams  is\r\n\r\nabout  8,000  acres  and this  area  is  completely\r\n\r\nunprotected   and  is  inhabited  by  farmers   and\r\n\r\nsquatters.  A  considerable  amount  of   vegetable\r\n\r\nfarming and pig and poultry rearing is done.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  the  water  from these  streams  could  be\r\n\r\npolluted,  so  that  when  Seletar  Reservoir   was\r\n\r\nconstructed,  we  had  to  build  2,778  water-seal\r\n\r\nlatrines  and  2,297  cesspits.  A  total  of   361\r\n\r\npigsties  were resited and 692 pigsties  demolished\r\n\r\nin  the  eight catchment areas. The pigsties  could\r\n\r\npollute the water in the reservoir. Hence the water-seal latrines and cess pits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $176,000 provided under subhead 2352\r\n\r\nwill meet 50 per cent of the cost of purchase of 16\r\n\r\ngalley  emptiers which are needed to  dislodge  pig\r\n\r\nmanure  from the cesspits and dispose of it at  the\r\n\r\nnearest sewerage treatment works. The other 50  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  the  cost  will be  paid  by  the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board. Unless the cesspits  are  cleared\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to time, the manure will overflow  into\r\n\r\nthe  streams.  So this is a continuous  maintenance\r\n\r\nproblem  called an anti-pollution measure.  It  has\r\n\r\nnothing   to  do  with  the  Government   pollution\r\n\r\nmeasures   which  we  are  thinking  of   now --  air\r\n\r\npollution,  water  pollution and  so  on.  This  is\r\n\r\npollution  which has been in the farms  in  Seletar\r\n\r\nfor  many years. We build the reservoir and we  use\r\n\r\nwater from the streams. We therefore have to ensure\r\n\r\nthat the water is clean. It may interest the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kallang  to know that these eight streams  can\r\n\r\nsupply  on  an  average of two million  gallons  of\r\n\r\nwater  a day for Seletar Reservoir. These are  only\r\n\r\nthe  eight streams. The water, of course, also goes\r\n\r\ninto  the main catchment area.

For example, some  tourists\r\n\r\ncomplained that certain officials of the department\r\n\r\nwere   discourteous,  arrogant  and  so  on.   This\r\n\r\nattitude  is  likely  to  generate  a  feeling   of\r\n\r\nresentment in the tourists. If the officials in the\r\n\r\ndepartment continue to behave in this manner,  then\r\n\r\nit  will  not  only affect adversely our  expanding\r\n\r\ntourist  industry,  but it  will  also  affect  the\r\n\r\neconomy of our country. This arrogance on the  part\r\n\r\nof  the  officials is a matter of serious  concern.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I hope the Minister will take  steps  to\r\n\r\nremedy the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. Certain officials of the\r\n\r\nCustoms and Excise section at Paya Lebar Airport\r\n\r\nare very inefficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are very slow and take their own sweet time in\r\n\r\ndealing  with tourists, This also arouses a feeling\r\n\r\nof  resentment  in the tourists. We should  try  to\r\n\r\nimprove the standards of courtesy and efficiency of\r\n\r\ncustoms officers so that the tourists will go  back\r\n\r\nwith  a  good impression of our country. This  will\r\n\r\nhelp  us  in our efforts to promote tourism.  So  I\r\n\r\nhope  the Minister will deal immediately with  this\r\n\r\nmatter and take the necessary steps to improve  the\r\n\r\nstandard of efficiency and courtesy of the  Customs\r\n\r\nand Excise Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The duty of custom officers is to catch smugglers\r\n\r\nand,  as such, it cannot be expected that they will\r\n\r\nrate very high in any popularity poll in Singapore.\r\n\r\nI  would be greatly alarmed if customs officers are\r\n\r\nthe most popular of the civil servants. However, if\r\n\r\nthe Member for Sembawang has specific complaints of\r\n\r\nmisconduct, I will be glad to hear them. I  do  not\r\n\r\nplace much credence on general complaints, as it is\r\n\r\nin  the nature of the work of customs officers that\r\n\r\nthey have to be unpleasant to people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards slowness in dealing with tourists at\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar International Airport, I am afraid  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Sembawang is behind time. The  customs\r\n\r\nofficers  used  to  take a lot  of  trouble  to  be\r\n\r\nconscientious about this, but the new policy is  to\r\n\r\nclear passengers as quickly as possible and not  to\r\n\r\nmake  checks unless they know that some  disruptive\r\n\r\nor  shady  characters are in the plane. Records  of\r\n\r\npassenger clearance are being kept by the  Director\r\n\r\nof  Civil  Aviation, The average time  the  Customs\r\n\r\ntake  to  clear  a plane of 100 passengers  is  ten\r\n\r\nminutes. Therefore, there is no question that  this\r\n\r\nis one of the fastest Customs in the world.

On the other hand, it is also\r\n\r\ndue  to  the  Government  increasing  the  rate  of\r\n\r\nproperty tax. Unfortunately, the increased rate has\r\n\r\naffected both the rich and the poor. The burden  of\r\n\r\nincreased tax should fall on the rich as  they  can\r\n\r\nafford to pay. They live in luxurious bungalows and\r\n\r\nenjoy a high standard of living. It is unfair  that\r\n\r\nthe   poor  people  living  in,  for  example,  the\r\n\r\nSembawang  area,  Choa  Chu Kang  Constituency  and\r\n\r\nThomson  Constituency and so on, have  to  pay  the\r\n\r\nincreased  rate of property tax. In my constituency\r\n\r\nI  have received several complaints from the people\r\n\r\nsaying  that  their property tax has been  doubled.\r\n\r\nFor  example, in a two-room flat, these people need\r\n\r\nto  pay about $30 to $40 a year, but nowadays  they\r\n\r\nhave  to pay something like $ 100 to $120 per year.\r\n\r\nThis sort of measure is unfair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, very often we have been\r\n\r\nemphasising  that  we  are a  democratic  socialist\r\n\r\nGovernment, and therefore we have a duty  to  look\r\n\r\nafter the interests of the people, especially those\r\n\r\nbelonging  to the lower income group. The officials\r\n\r\nof  the  Income  Tax Department should,  therefore,\r\n\r\nunderstand the policy of the Government  when  they\r\n\r\nlay  down the rates of tax that the people have  to\r\n\r\npay.  They must sympathise with those whose  income\r\n\r\nis limited, because it is already quite a task for\r\n\r\nthem  to  support  their families and  they  cannot\r\n\r\nafford to pay more tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those cases I have mentioned are quite commonly\r\n\r\nfound in other rural areas including Choa Chu Kang,\r\n\r\nthe constituency of the Parliamentary Secretary  to\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance. I am sure he has received\r\n\r\nsimilar  complaints.  I  hope  the  Minister   will\r\n\r\nconsider  lowering  the rate of  property  tax  for\r\n\r\nthese people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I agree that it is the duty of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  increase  property  tax   for   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of the country, in point  of  fact,  I\r\n\r\nthink there are better ways of raising revenue. For\r\n\r\nexample, the government knows of many cases of  tax\r\n\r\nevasion. If it could concentrate on this field, I am\r\n\r\nsure  the  extra revenue collected  will  be  quite\r\n\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very pleased to note that the\r\n\r\nGovernment has recently invited certain specialists\r\n\r\nfrom  America  to help us deal with tax  evasion.\r\n\r\nThis  is  indeed a very good move. I would like  to\r\n\r\nknow  how the government proposes to implement  the\r\n\r\nmeasures to prevent tax evasion, and how much extra\r\n\r\nrevenue  Government will be able to raise.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will take steps  to  arrest  these\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Property Tax Division\r\n\r\ndoes  not accept payment of taxes which come to  $2\r\n\r\nor $3. Superficially this appears beneficial to the\r\n\r\npeople  in the rural areas whose taxes are  usually\r\n\r\nlow. But this is not equivalent to a tax exemption.\r\n\r\nIt is only a temporary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuspension  of collection. This also  reflects  the\r\n\r\nlaziness and irresponsibility of officials in  this\r\n\r\nDivision.  For a few years now, these rural  people\r\n\r\nhave  not  been paying this tax, because when  they\r\n\r\nwent to pay, their payments were not accepted.  But\r\n\r\nrecently  they received notice to pay up their  tax\r\n\r\narrears. They found that their rates have increased\r\n\r\nmore than a hundred times. In other words, from  $2\r\n\r\nto  $3 per year, their rates have been increased to\r\n\r\n$200   to   $300.  This  is  fantastic   and   most\r\n\r\nunreasonable. If the officials of the Property  Tax\r\n\r\nDivision  had agreed to receive payment every  year\r\n\r\nor once every three months, then these people would\r\n\r\nnot  have  to  pay  such a large sum.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister   will   carry   out   a   very   detailed\r\n\r\ninvestigation into this unreasonable situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I only wish to touch a\r\n\r\ncomparatively  minor aspect of the inland  revenue,\r\n\r\nIt  concerns the implementation of the amendment to\r\n\r\nthe  Stamp Ordinance, passed by this House  on  the\r\n\r\n15th  October, 1969, to allow for payment of  stamp\r\n\r\nduty on a number of legal documents by means of the\r\n\r\npostal  franking machine. The amendment has  passed\r\n\r\ninto  law  now for some five months.

This was a  step\r\n\r\nrecommended by the Organisation and Methods Branch,\r\n\r\nfollowing  their investigations into  the  work  of\r\n\r\nthat Department. This being the case, I should have\r\n\r\nthought that the Commissioner would have been  only\r\n\r\ntoo  happy to grant the licences applied  for,  but\r\n\r\nthe  impression I have is that he does not seem  to\r\n\r\nbe too keen to grant licences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

I believe the revenue of  the  Income\r\n\r\nTax  Department  was increased  by  $59.8  million.\r\n\r\nHowever, I feel there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  areas  in  Singapore where  stricter  or  more\r\n\r\nefficient methods of collecting tax can be  adopted\r\n\r\nto further increase the revenue from income tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in common with many other countries in Asia,\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  this  phenomenon  -  that  roadside\r\n\r\nhawkers in certain selected areas are making better\r\n\r\nbusiness than even established restaurants. It will\r\n\r\nbe  interesting  to  know how many  of  these  busy\r\n\r\nhawkers,  catering for tourists as  well  as  local\r\n\r\npeople,  pay  income tax. Take, for  instance,  the\r\n\r\nmany  stallholders  doing  business  opposite   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Cold  Storage  in  Orchard  Road,  Bugis\r\n\r\nStreet, Hock Lam Street, Albert Street, etc.  I  am\r\n\r\ntold  that  the average turnover per day  for  each\r\n\r\nstall  in  such areas is much higher than  that  in\r\n\r\nlicensed   restaurants. It  will,  therefore,   be\r\n\r\ninteresting  to know how many of these  hawkers  do\r\n\r\npay income tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully conscious of the difficulty that the\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax Department faces in getting proper  tax\r\n\r\nreturns   from   these   stallholders.   But   with\r\n\r\nsufficient manpower, however, it may be possible to\r\n\r\nstation  an official near selected stalls to  record\r\n\r\nthe  daily  takings and to estimate the profits  of\r\n\r\nthe hawkers on the basis of such takings. There may\r\n\r\nbe  other methods which I am sure the American  tax\r\n\r\nofficials, being specialists in this field, will be\r\n\r\nable to suggest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Anti Evasion Unit, if it functions properly,\r\n\r\nshould  be able to increase the income tax  revenue\r\n\r\nmuch more than we have had this year, and the money\r\n\r\nspent  on setting up this Unit would be well  worth\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Members have raised two main points - property tax and the Anti Evasion Unit. At the risk\r\n\r\nof  repetition when the other subhead comes  up,  I\r\n\r\nthink I will deal them, with your permission,  Sir,\r\n\r\nin some detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property tax is levied on the annual value of the\r\n\r\nproperty.  If  a  landlord rents  out  a  piece  of\r\n\r\nproperty,  then  the annual value is  the  rent  he\r\n\r\ncollects from it. In that case, I assume the Member\r\n\r\nfor Sembawang, whose concern is for poor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople,  will  have no sympathy with the  landlord,\r\n\r\nThat  must  be so, because landlords are  not  poor\r\n\r\npeople. The problem will arise when the person owns\r\n\r\nthe  house in which he lives. This is the  trouble.\r\n\r\nHow  to  value it? There has been an uproar  lately\r\n\r\nbecause  the  property tax levied on owner-occupied\r\n\r\nresidence has been increased 100 per cent and even,\r\n\r\nI  am  told,  250 per cent, They say the Department\r\n\r\nhas  been quite ruthless and rapacious. Of  course,\r\n\r\nthat  is  one  way of looking at it. But  from  the\r\n\r\nProperty  Tax Department's point of view, they  say\r\n\r\nthe man is lucky to have got away so cheaply in the\r\n\r\npast,  and that the present valuation is the  right\r\n\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now where the man lives in his own house, the\r\n\r\nvaluation attached to that house is related to  the\r\n\r\nrent that can be fetched for similar houses. Let us\r\n\r\nsuppose  the Member for Sembawang lives in his  own\r\n\r\nhouse. The house next door, which is the same  type\r\n\r\nof  house, has been rented out for, say,  $2,000  a\r\n\r\nyear.  Therefore,  the  Member's  house  should  be\r\n\r\nassessed   at   $2,000  a   year.   It   is   quite\r\n\r\nstraightforward. And if in the past his  house  has\r\n\r\nbeen  assessed at $200 a year, it is only fair that\r\n\r\nit should now be assessed at $2,000 a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened is that the staff of the\r\n\r\nDepartment has been strengthened and will  continue\r\n\r\nto   be   strengthened, so  that  the  number   of\r\n\r\nreassessments  now  being made is  increasing,  and\r\n\r\nmore  and  more  people are paying more  tax  which\r\n\r\nshould have been paid years ago. So there was quite\r\n\r\na  howl  about that. If they think that  they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  unfairly treated, then they can,  of  course,\r\n\r\nappeal.  It  is  quite strange that none  of  these\r\n\r\npeople  who  grumble about high taxes have  so  far\r\n\r\ntaken the legal redress available to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the Stamp Ordinance, the Member for Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu  asked how it is that, after we have done  all\r\n\r\nthis  business  of  passing  a  new  law  to  allow\r\n\r\nfranking  machines to be licensed, the  people  who\r\n\r\nasked  for franking machines did not get a licence.\r\n\r\nI  do not know the details, but I can only guess  -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neither  the  Commissioner of  Stamps  has  not  got\r\n\r\nenough franking machines or these people are not -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, can I just clarify one point?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin :</b> My point\r\n\r\nis  this: I have come across  instances\r\n\r\nwhere  the  people already have the machines.

Last year it was\r\n\r\nput  down  in the budget as a block vote of $500,000,\r\n\r\nbecause  at  that time the Commissioner  of  Inland\r\n\r\nRevenue did not know the number of staff he  needed\r\n\r\nand  what their salary scales should be, and so on.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it was paid out of a block.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year we know the scale of operations , the\r\n\r\ntype  of staff, the salaries needed to pay for them\r\n\r\nand  therefore, the Anti Evasion unit appears as  a\r\n\r\nseparate unit under the Inland Revenue head. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  part  of  the  Property Tax  Division.  It  is\r\n\r\nanother division of the Inland Revenue Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, how does it operate? The staff have to\r\n\r\ndevelop  certain skills, it is not as  easy  as  the\r\n\r\nMember for Sembawang has suggested. You cannot say.\r\n\r\n\"So and so is evading tax.\" You then arrest him and\r\n\r\nput  him  in gaol. It cannot be done that way.  You\r\n\r\nhave  to take them to court and prove that  he  has\r\n\r\nbeen evading tax. You have to provide evidence that\r\n\r\nhe  has been evading tax, otherwise the Judge will\r\n\r\ntoss out the case. Therefore, the Anti Evasion Unit\r\n\r\nhas  the duty of collecting evidence to prove  that\r\n\r\nsuch and such a taxpayer or such and such a company\r\n\r\nis evading tax. They do it in various ways, some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   which  are  open  and  some  are  secret   and\r\n\r\nconfidential which I cannot discuss here. But I will\r\n\r\ndiscuss the open system of catching tax evaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First they have to develop the skill in auditing\r\n\r\nbooks  for tax assessment purposes. I am told  this\r\n\r\nis  quite  a complicated technique and  has  to  be\r\n\r\nlearnt  from  people  who have experience  in  such\r\n\r\npractices. In fact, the Anti Evasion Unit is slowly\r\n\r\nbuilding   up  a  staff  from  graduates   of   the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  who have obtained Accountancy  degrees,\r\n\r\nUniversity  graduates in Business Administratration\r\n\r\nand  law  graduates and so on. They are trained  to\r\n\r\nlook  for  evidence of tax evasion in  the  account\r\n\r\nbooks  which  can sustain a prosecution  in  court.\r\n\r\nHaving had the staff to collect such evidence, the\r\n\r\nUnit  has  to  train  them  to  develop  skills  in\r\n\r\ninterrogation  and finally in prosecuting  the  tax\r\n\r\nevaders  in  court. As I said, this is, so to  speak,\r\n\r\nthe   above-the-counter  method  of  catching   tax\r\n\r\nevaders. It means getting trained staff and putting\r\n\r\nthem through a rigorous training programme, both in\r\n\r\nSingapore and in the United States, in  order  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  the  skills. It is a  long  hard  slog.\r\n\r\nThere  is no short-cut to it. We have just started\r\n\r\nthis  training with the assistance of employees  of\r\n\r\nthe  American Inland Revenue Department. This  work\r\n\r\nwill keep on expanding, progressing and improving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the question of taxing hawkers.\r\n\r\nWhen   you   engage   20  investigating   officers,\r\n\r\nincluding  professional lawyers, accountant and\r\n\r\nso  on,  you are after the big fish. We  know  that\r\n\r\nsome hawkers do make money and if we catch them  we\r\n\r\nwill probably get $500 a year tax from them.  Members\r\n\r\nmust remember that if a hawker is married with only\r\n\r\ntwo  children, he has to have an income of at least\r\n\r\n$5,000 a year before he is liable to pay tax. If he\r\n\r\nhas an income of $6,000 or $7,000 a year, you do not\r\n\r\nget  more  than  $100  tax from  him.  So  hounding\r\n\r\nhawkers in large numbers will be really a waste of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney.  What the Inland Revenue Department will  do\r\n\r\nis to go for the big fish. I think in the course of\r\n\r\nyears  they will succeed. I am afraid the  big  tax\r\n\r\nevaders   who  do  not  believe  that   will   find\r\n\r\nthemselves not only landed with a whacking big  tax\r\n\r\nassessment, but they may find themselves landed  in\r\n\r\nprison.  When that happens, I think people will  be\r\n\r\nless  willing  to take the risk of  dodging  income\r\n\r\ntax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of\r\n\r\nMadam Chan Choy Siong -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0406 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead\r\n\r\n1041.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Sir, I am not moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of\r\n\r\nMadam Chan Choy Siong, Mr Cheong Yuen Chee, Mr J.\r\n\r\nF.

This move is another indication\r\n\r\nof Government's policy to support and \r\n\r\nencourage a property-owning democracy.\r\n\r\nThe Government is also to be congratulated on resolving the anomalies in\r\n\r\nthe rates of assessment for similar properties. The rectification of such\r\n\r\nanomalies greatly benefits the flat\r\n\r\nowners, the majority of whom are wage-earners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point, however, to which\t\r\n\r\nI would like to draw the Minister's\r\n\r\nattention. That is the manner in which\r\n\r\nnotices of assessment are issued. In\r\n\r\nmost cases, such notices are served on\r\n\r\nflat owners several months after they\r\n\r\nhave moved into the flats. In some\r\n\r\ninstances after a period of more than\r\n\r\none year. This inevitably gives rise to a\r\n\r\nsituation where a flat owner is confronted with a property tax bill\r\n\r\namounting to a few hundred dollars in\r\n\r\nrespect of the property tax for the past\r\n\r\nseveral months or year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you are aware, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nvery few wage-earners can afford to pay\r\n\r\nsuch a huge bill in one lump sum. Even\r\n\r\nthe Housing and Development Board is\r\n\r\naware of this problem and the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Law and National Development has\r\n\r\nnow permitted the inclusion of legal\r\n\r\nfees, stamp duty, etc. into the housing\r\n\r\nloan so as to enable the purchaser of\r\n\r\nHousing Board flats to pay such fees\r\n\r\nby instalments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Property Tax Division has allowed\r\n\r\nflat  owners  to settle their arrears  by  monthly\r\n\r\ninstalments,  it  imposes a fee  of  $5  for  late\r\n\r\npayment by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndefault. Such a fee adds insult to injury  as  the\r\n\r\ndelay  in  payment  was  occasioned  not  by  the\r\n\r\ndefault  of the ratepayer but by the Property  Tax\r\n\r\nDivision  through its failure to issue its  advice\r\n\r\non time. The explanation given was that that this fee is\r\n\r\nfor the issue of demand notice and warrant  in\r\n\r\nrespect of tax outstanding which was not made\r\n\r\nknown, until months after. If the Property  Tax\r\n\r\nDivision had been prompt in issuing assessment notices,\r\n\r\nsuch a situation would not have arisen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, $5 is not a big sum\r\n\r\nfor  any  flat  owner to pay, but is  it  fair  to\r\n\r\npenalise a person for not paying what he owes when he is \r\n\r\nnot given the opportunity to know how much he is owing in the\r\n\r\nfirst instance, and then subsequently he is allowed to settle \r\n\r\nhis arrears by monthly instalments? In\r\n\r\norder to avoid penalising the ratepayers\r\n\r\nunduly, may I respectfully suggest that\r\n\r\nthe Property Tax Division issue notices of \r\n\r\nassessment to flat owners within a reasonable period of their occupying \r\n\r\ntheir flats? By ensuring that the estimated \r\n\r\namount of tax payable is made known in time to the owner-occupiers,\r\n\r\nthey can make provision to pay the\r\n\r\ntax before it is due. I am sure some\r\n\r\narrangements can be made between the \r\n\r\nProperty Tax Division and the Housing and Development Board offices to \r\n\r\ncollect their keys to the flats. If the Minister can\r\n\r\nlook into this matter urgently, the owner-occupiers of Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard flats will have one unnecessary frustration less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I did not quite get the point of\r\n\r\nthe Member for Bukit Panjang.

Petty traders\r\n\r\nas well as large-scale importers and exporters have\r\n\r\nplayed  their part in the expansion of our economy.\r\n\r\nI  feel,  therefore,  that  every  convenience  and\r\n\r\nassistance  given to them will in the  end  benefit\r\n\r\nthe  Republic. Thus, if the volume of  their  trade\r\n\r\nincreases,  the  revenue  will  be  proportionately\r\n\r\nincreased.  I believe much inconvenience  has  been\r\n\r\ncaused to our importers and exporters in respect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  issue  of  Inward  and  Outward  Declarations,\r\n\r\nwhether deliberately or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a trader wants to import certain goods from\r\n\r\nabroad, in about three out of 10 cases, he  has  to\r\n\r\ngo  first to the Imports and Exports officer in the\r\n\r\nTrade  Division located in Fullerton Building where\r\n\r\nI  am  told  he  has  to get clearance  from  three\r\n\r\ndifferent  departments,  namely,  the  Imports  and\r\n\r\nExports  Office,  the Statistics Division  and  the\r\n\r\nCustoms  Division. Having cleared with these  three\r\n\r\ndepartments,  if  the goods to be imported  involve\r\n\r\ncustoms import duty, he is then required to  go  to\r\n\r\nthe  Customs  Office at Maxwell  Road  to  get  the\r\n\r\nclearance and then to go back to Fullerton Building\r\n\r\nfor  the  necessary permits. In the  event  of  any\r\n\r\ndoubt arising as to whether import duty is involved\r\n\r\nor  not in respect of the goods to be imported,  he\r\n\r\nstill  has  to  go  to  Maxwell  Road  to  get  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  clearance from the Customs there  before\r\n\r\nhe  is issued with the necessary permits ultimately\r\n\r\nat  Fullerton Building. As this entails unnecessary\r\n\r\ndifficulty  and  inconvenience,  it  may  be  asked\r\n\r\nwhether  it  would be possible to amalgamate  these\r\n\r\ntwo  sections so that the traders are  not  shunted\r\n\r\nfrom  Fullerton Building to Maxwell Road  and  then\r\n\r\nback  to  Fullerton Building for these permits.  If\r\n\r\nthese  two  departments come  under  one  roof,  it\r\n\r\nwould,  in  my opinion, be much more efficient.  It\r\n\r\nwould   involve  better  utilisation  of  manpower,\r\n\r\nminimise duplication of work and simplify the issue\r\n\r\nof  Inward and Outward Permits. I am told  that  in\r\n\r\nmost other countries Import and Export Permits  are\r\n\r\nissued   by  the  Customs  authorities.   Even   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the enforcement of Imports and  Exports\r\n\r\nDeclarations, the checking of the declarations, the\r\n\r\npayment  of  necessary duties, the  examination  of\r\n\r\ngoods, etc., are done by the Customs authorities in\r\n\r\nthe  harbour, airport, etc. Even the issue of these\r\n\r\ndeclarations  or  permits outside office  hours  is\r\n\r\ndone  by  the  Customs.  If  such  declarations  or\r\n\r\npermits can be issued by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Customs outside office hours, I should like  to\r\n\r\nknow  why the Customs authorities cannot issue  the\r\n\r\nrequired permits during office hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the reason is, the issue of the\r\n\r\ndeclarations would be simplified if it is  done  in\r\n\r\none  and  the  same building instead  of  different\r\n\r\nbuildings, especially when they are located quite a\r\n\r\ndistance from one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the position is not really as bad as the\r\n\r\nMember makes it out to be. In most instances  where\r\n\r\ngoods  are not dutiable, Customs officers  are  not\r\n\r\ninvolved  and  the  importers  need  only   go   to\r\n\r\nFullerton  Building. Even where duty  is  involved,\r\n\r\nbut  the  consignment  is  small  or  consists   of\r\n\r\npersonal effects, the Customs and Excise Department\r\n\r\nhas  stationed  13  officers  in  the  Imports  and\r\n\r\nExports Office and can give the necessary clearance\r\n\r\nwithout the person having to go to the Customs  and\r\n\r\nExcise Department. But where there is a substantial\r\n\r\nconsignment of goods, and where it is necessary  to\r\n\r\ncheck  the importer's background, then the  Customs\r\n\r\nofficers  will  have  to do the checking.  However,\r\n\r\nthis  does  not mean the importer goes to Fullerton\r\n\r\nBuilding  and  is then shunted to the  Customs  and\r\n\r\nExcise  Department at Maxwell Road,  If  he  is  an\r\n\r\nefficient importer, he will know that he has to  go\r\n\r\nto  the  Customs and Excise Department  first,  and\r\n\r\nwhen  that is cleared he goes to Fullerton Building\r\n\r\nand the formalities end there. I agree that it will\r\n\r\nbe  a  good thing to have these procedures  in  one\r\n\r\nbuilding.  However, neither Fullerton Building  nor\r\n\r\nCustoms  House  in Maxwell Road is  big  enough  to\r\n\r\nhouse  both of them. So until we get more money  to\r\n\r\nhave  more  massive  Government offices,  importers\r\n\r\nwill have to put up with this minor inconvenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

In  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations,  our representatives  have  spoken\r\n\r\nvery  frankly on international problems, and  their\r\n\r\nspeeches  have  been heeded by the  other  nations.\r\n\r\nThis  shows that ours is a youthful but progressive\r\n\r\ncountry  and  that we are on an equal footing  with\r\n\r\nother big countries on foreign affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main characteristics of our foreign policy\r\n\r\nare  those of neutrality and non-alignment. We want\r\n\r\nto  be  friends with all countries, especially  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries. If we want  to  have  very\r\n\r\nclose  co-operation with these countries, we  must\r\n\r\ncontinue with this policy of neutrality. This is  a\r\n\r\nvery   enlightened  policy.  We  will  become   the\r\n\r\nSwitzerland  of  Asia if we adopt  this  policy  of\r\n\r\nneutrality.  This  will be beneficial  to  both  the\r\n\r\ncountry  and  the  people. With the  advancement  in\r\n\r\nscience and the improvement of communications,  the world\r\n\r\nhas  shrunk.

I believe\r\n\r\nthat  last  year  we did send an advance  party  of\r\n\r\nofficials from the Ministry of Finance to countries\r\n\r\nwhere  we intend to set up embassies, The idea  of\r\n\r\nsending  an  advance party to set up an embassy  is\r\n\r\nmost admirable, but the question is how did they do\r\n\r\ntheir job?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leaves much to be desired, because I have\r\n\r\nbeen to one of our missions where I found that  the\r\n\r\nadvance party had been there for more than a month.\r\n\r\nThey  had informed the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs\r\n\r\nthat  all was well and that the Ambassador and  his\r\n\r\nstaff  could  come and set up the office.  However,\r\n\r\neven  details of equipment for the office were  not\r\n\r\nlooked  after,  and the embassy had to  work  under\r\n\r\ndifficult  conditions, sometimes  without  even  a\r\n\r\ntypewriter.  Sir,  I think the Ministry  should  be\r\n\r\ncareful in setting up embassies, especially  before\r\n\r\nsending  our Ambassadors and some of our  officials\r\n\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are other aspects where a lot of\r\n\r\nimprovement can be made. One is that in the country\r\n\r\nthat  I  am  referring to, the advance  party  went\r\n\r\nahead  and  rented a few houses for our  officials.\r\n\r\nBut  the Ministry was not yet in a position to send\r\n\r\nthe  required number of officials to this  embassy.\r\n\r\nAs  a result, the Foreign Ministry had to pay rents\r\n\r\nfor  these  houses which were not  occupied  for  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable number of months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that I want to take up is the\r\n\r\nquestion  of furniture and other necessary fittings\r\n\r\nfor  the  houses of Ambassadors and  officials,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as for the embassy itself. In many instances,\r\n\r\nI believe the cost of hiring these fittings is very\r\n\r\nexpensive in a number of foreign countries. It will\r\n\r\nbe  cheaper if they buy the required furniture  and\r\n\r\nequipment before setting up the embassies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of houses for Ambassadors, some of\r\n\r\nthem  may  be located in proper diplomatic enclaves\r\n\r\nin  these  countries, but they should be such  that\r\n\r\nthe  Ambassador  would be able to  entertain  other\r\n\r\nAmbassadors  in  that country. If  the  houses  are\r\n\r\nsmall,  then  the  problem of entertaining  becomes\r\n\r\nvery difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this year's vote for the Foreign Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  been increased. I hope that more care will  be\r\n\r\ntaken in setting up embassies abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am happy to note that, as we\r\n\r\nhave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot come to the Moment of interruption, I can enjoy\r\n\r\nsome  free  time  to speak on foreign  affairs.  No\r\n\r\ndoubt  just  now  I have missed the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nspeak  on  two  of  my amendments when  we  reached\r\n\r\n\"guillotine\"  time.  But  the  second  part  of  it\r\n\r\npertaining  to  A.S.E.A.N. has already  been  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  by  the  Member  for Sembawang.  So  on  this\r\n\r\namendment  to cut the Minister's salary by  $10,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to join the crowd by airing my views  on\r\n\r\nthese two points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, firstly, we have to make annual\r\n\r\ncontributions to international organisations. There\r\n\r\nare  organisations  like the United  Nations  under\r\n\r\nwhich  you  have  the  United  Nations  Development\r\n\r\nProgramme, etc. I would like the Minister  to  give\r\n\r\nthis  House  an idea of how much Singapore  has  to\r\n\r\ncontribute   to   each   of   these   international\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the A.S.E.A.N. set-up.\r\n\r\nA.S.E.A.N. was set up a few years ago, and over  the\r\n\r\nlast  few  years  the Foreign Ministers  of  member\r\n\r\ncountries  have been getting together and  Standing\r\n\r\nCommittees  have been formed. A lot  of  discussion\r\n\r\nand  consultation  has been going  on,  and,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult, we are asked today to vote for a sum of  no\r\n\r\nless than $3 million towards the A.S.E.A.N. Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this respect, I would be grateful if the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Foreign  Affairs  would   care   to\r\n\r\nelaborate on how and in what form the $3.08 million\r\n\r\nwould  be  utilised  towards the  A.S.E.A.N.  Fund.\r\n\r\nWhere  is  the base of operations, in other  words,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  in  Singapore,  Kuala  Lumpur,  or\r\n\r\nDjakarta? And how many of its representatives  will\r\n\r\nbe grouped together in order to set up this central\r\n\r\nbody   to   control  the  membership  subscriptions\r\n\r\ntowards the A.S.E.A.N. fund?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point is a follow-up of what my\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Member for Telok Blangah,  has  just\r\n\r\nraised. This concerns our establishment of missions\r\n\r\noverseas. I have had the opportunity to visit  some\r\n\r\nof  our foreign missions, the chanceries, and  also\r\n\r\nthe  residences  of our Ambassadors.  My  point  is\r\n\r\nthis: we send our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmbassadors to represent Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  image  of Singapore must, therefore,  be  well\r\n\r\nprojected, and one of the ways of doing  so  is  to\r\n\r\nsee  that every care and consideration - I  am  not\r\n\r\nsaying that no care has been taken - should be  given\r\n\r\ntowards  the  setting  up of  these  chanceries  or\r\n\r\ngetting adequate residences for our Ambassadors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another important point that we\r\n\r\nshould  remember:  the question of  staff.  In  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  my  visits to quite a number  of  these\r\n\r\nforeign  missions, I have noticed  that  our  home-based  staff  are small in number, and the  locally\r\n\r\nrecruited staff are equally small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am going to reach the Moment of\r\n\r\ninterruption  because I want the Minister  to  give\r\n\r\nhis answers tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the staff recruitment in a mission is very\r\n\r\nimportant in two respects. Let us say in a  mission\r\n\r\nwe  have staff from the Ambassador downwards, maybe\r\n\r\nthe  Counsellor,  then  the  First  Secretary,  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Secretary, a general clerical officer,  and\r\n\r\nsome  locally recruited staff. I am of the  opinion\r\n\r\nthat  in  quite a number of missions there is  much\r\n\r\nwork to be done, and the nature of the work is such\r\n\r\nthat  sometimes  it  has to be done  by  home-based\r\n\r\nstaff.  Let  us  take,  as  an  illustration,   our\r\n\r\nPermanent Mission to the United Nations, New  York.\r\n\r\nLooking  at  the staffing position,  we  have  four\r\n\r\nlocally recruited staff. But we do not know exactly\r\n\r\nthe  home  staffing position. I can make  a  guess.\r\n\r\nThere  is so much work to be done and some of  this\r\n\r\nwork should he handled by home-based staff. In this\r\n\r\nrespect, I am happy to note that there was  a  post\r\n\r\nof Confidential Secretary in our High Commission in\r\n\r\nLondon,  and I have brought this matter  up  today.\r\n\r\nYou  can  see  that  this post  has  got  a  little\r\n\r\nabbreviation, \"pa\", which means that the  post  has\r\n\r\nbeen  abolished. This goes to show that every  care\r\n\r\nmust  be  taken in recruiting staff. I shall  cover\r\n\r\nthe  other details at the proper time as I have put\r\n\r\nin my amendments to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have brought up the question of extra\r\n\r\nofficers to he recruited for these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvarious  overseas  missions,  Invariably  in   some\r\n\r\nmissions  we have only the First Secretary  and  an\r\n\r\nAttache,  and  no Second or Third Secretary.  These\r\n\r\ntwo  posts  of  Second  and Third  Secretaries  are\r\n\r\nimportant.  Their duties will have to be  specially\r\n\r\ndefined  so  that they will know what to  do.  They\r\n\r\nwill  also take a load off the First Secretary.  In\r\n\r\nsome cases you will notice that we have Counsellors\r\n\r\nin  the  various missions. I fully  agree  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  have Counsellors, but they are  so  few  in\r\n\r\nnumber.  Will the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs  not\r\n\r\nconsider recruiting suitable officers to fill  such\r\n\r\nposts?  Counsellors do a variety of work. No  doubt\r\n\r\nthey  are  only termed \"Counsellors\", but they  are\r\n\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs will\r\n\r\nconsider these suggestions and ensure that  in  the\r\n\r\nnext  or  future Budget Estimates,  there  will  be\r\n\r\nprovision for more officers, especially from home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also the question of their\r\n\r\nsalaries.  I  am told that these are based  on  the\r\n\r\nsalary scales here, but when they go overseas  they\r\n\r\nare  entitled  to an overseas allowance.  But  the\r\n\r\nsalaries in terms of overseas postings are -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
