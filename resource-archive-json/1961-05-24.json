It\r\n\r\nis  not  expected that cases will arise  of  persons\r\n\r\nhaving  to  lose their present means of  livelihood.\r\n\r\nThose  who  are  farmers  will  be  given  all   the\r\n\r\nfacilities for carrying on with farming, whereas the\r\n\r\nnon-farmers  can  choose, out of  three  methods  of\r\n\r\nresettlement,  the  method  that  best  suits  their\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid that the hon.

I regret to say\r\n\r\nthat  through  an oversight in Gazette  notification\r\n\r\nthe original Ordinance was allowed to lapse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not my purpose here to apportion the\r\n\r\nblame between the S.A.G.'s Chambers and the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Home  Affairs who are supposed to keep  tabs  on\r\n\r\nthese  things. But unfortunately arising out of  the\r\n\r\noversight, the matter was referred whether or not it\r\n\r\nwas  necessary, or whether or not it would make  any\r\n\r\ndifference  in  the long run to have  the  Ordinance\r\n\r\ncontinue in force. A lengthy debate took place  with\r\n\r\nthe  Police  who  convinced me, as the  then  Acting\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home Affairs, that  the  Bill  should\r\n\r\ncontinue. I then gave instructions that, instead  of\r\n\r\na yearly renewal, a Bill should be prepared to allow\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance to continue in force for a period  of\r\n\r\nfive years, and the matter could be reconsidered  by\r\n\r\na  subsequent Assembly. When the Bill was  prepared,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Home Affairs had come back  and  I\r\n\r\npersonally lost touch with the matter. Subsequently,\r\n\r\nit  was introduced not as a new Bill for a period of\r\n\r\nfive  years, which it is now our intention to  move,\r\n\r\nbut  one  which, as the Member for Farrer  Park  had\r\n\r\npointed  out, attempted to continue in  existence  a\r\n\r\nBill which, technically, had lapsed by a failure  to\r\n\r\nprint  a  Gazette notification. The matter  has  now\r\n\r\nbeen  put  right.  I do not know whether  it  is  of\r\n\r\nadvantage to pass any castigating remarks on  either\r\n\r\nthe  Crown  Counsel or the junior clerical  officers\r\n\r\nwho  should have seen to this matter. However, I  am\r\n\r\nassured  that everybody did, in fact, do  his  duty,\r\n\r\nbut the reference book which is turned up day by day\r\n\r\nto  see what lapses and what needs to be renewed was\r\n\r\nunfortunately not turned up in this particular  case\r\n\r\nin  time. It was discovered a few days after it  had\r\n\r\nlapsed.  I  must say this on behalf of the permanent\r\n\r\nofficials  of the Government - that the discovery  was\r\n\r\nmade  within  three  days of the  lapsing,  and  the\r\n\r\nlength   of   time  between  the   lapse   and   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of the Bill does not indicate  that  it\r\n\r\nwas  forgotten for that long period of time, but  it\r\n\r\ndoes  indicate that a debate was going on whether  a\r\n\r\nBill of that nature should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreintroduced.

I  do\r\n\r\nnot  propose,  therefore,  to  say  much  about  the\r\n\r\nOffences relating to Vehicles Bill, 1961, except  to\r\n\r\nsay  that it is also to be in operation for a period\r\n\r\nof  four  years, that its provisions are similar  to\r\n\r\nthe  1960  Ordinance of the same name, and that  its\r\n\r\nbecoming law is a matter of urgency, since it is  to\r\n\r\nreplace the Offences relating to Vehicles Ordinance.\r\n\r\n1960,  which would have already continued to  be  in\r\n\r\noperation  for another four years, if  the  Offences\r\n\r\nrelating  to  Vehicles (Amendment) Bill,  1961,  had\r\n\r\nbeen passed by the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Dr Lee Siew Choh].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported, without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4><div align=\"center\"><b>LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS (SPECIAL PROVISIONS - ANSON ELECTION) BILL</b></div></h4></div>\r\n\r\n               \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>First Reading</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, I beg to introduce a Bill intituled \"An\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to make special provisions for the  Anson\r\n\r\nElection for 1961.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Second Reading</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Now, Sir.

The  present\r\n\r\nposition  with regard to this revision is  that  the\r\n\r\nexisting registers and Lists A and B have been  open\r\n\r\nto public inspection since 8th May, 1961, and closed\r\n\r\non  22nd May, 1961. Next will follow what we know as\r\n\r\nthe  Claims  and  Objections period  when  lists  of\r\n\r\nclaimants  will be published, objections  to  claims\r\n\r\nreceived,  and adjudication of claims and objections\r\n\r\nmade. According\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  timetable  drawn up for completion  of  the\r\n\r\nrevised  registers, it is expected that the  revised\r\n\r\nregisters will be certified and published in  August\r\n\r\n1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the revision of the electoral registers is\r\n\r\ngoing  on, we have before us the Anson Division \r\n\r\nby-election caused by the death of the late Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson,  Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff.  Because\r\n\r\nof  complaints that some persons who intended to  be\r\n\r\ncandidates in the Hong Lim by-election could not  do\r\n\r\nso,  and because their names had been omitted in the\r\n\r\npresent  registers, it is considered desirable  that\r\n\r\nthis by-election should be held on the basis of  the\r\n\r\ncertified revised registers, and not on the  present\r\n\r\nregisters which are over two years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of these revised registers of electors\r\n\r\nwill  mean  that persons standing as  candidates  in\r\n\r\nthis  by-election  will  not  be  confined  only  to\r\n\r\npersons  whose  names appear in the 1959  registers.\r\n\r\nNormally,  these  revised  registers  would  not  be\r\n\r\ncertified and published until September at least  of\r\n\r\nthe   year  in  which  revision  takes  place.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  decided, however, that  proceedings\r\n\r\nfor  the  holding of the by-election for  the  Anson\r\n\r\nDivision  should be commenced early next  month  and\r\n\r\nthat  Nomination Day should be 10th June. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  has  been  introduced  to  make  special\r\n\r\nprovisions  to enable any person whose name  appears\r\n\r\nin List B for any electoral division or who has made\r\n\r\na  valid claim for the insertion or retention of his\r\n\r\nname  in  a  register  of electors  to  stand  as  a\r\n\r\ncandidate for election for the electoral division of\r\n\r\nAnson if he so desires, although his name is not yet\r\n\r\nincluded  in  a register of electors.  This  special\r\n\r\nlegislation  in  effect  will  allow  nomination  of\r\n\r\ncandidates  to proceed, while the new registers  are\r\n\r\nbeing  completed for certification and  publication.\r\n\r\nWe were unable to provide similar special provisions\r\n\r\nin  respect of the Hong Lim by-election as the \r\n\r\ntime-table  for  the  preparatory  work  on  the  revised\r\n\r\nregisters for 1961 did not make it possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as voting on Polling Day in the Anson\r\n\r\nby-election  is  concerned, administrative arrangements\r\n\r\nhave been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade  to ensure that the revised register for  Anson\r\n\r\nwill  be  given priority attention and be ready  for\r\n\r\ncertification  and publication by  July  this  year.\r\n\r\nThis  certification  and publication  will  be  made\r\n\r\nsometime  before Polling Day in order to enable  all\r\n\r\nvoters  in the certified revised register for  Anson\r\n\r\nto  vote  at  the by-election. They  alone  will  be\r\n\r\neligible  to  vote, as this register  would  be  the\r\n\r\nregister of electors in operation on Polling Day  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  the provisions  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  a bit disturbed by the speech of the Minister in\r\n\r\nthe  Second  Reading  of this  Bill.  He  says  that\r\n\r\nPolling  Day for Anson will have to wait  until  the\r\n\r\nrevised register is ready, and he says that ii  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  ready until sometime in July.  This  means,\r\n\r\nSir, that after Nomination Day a candidate will have\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in knowing who his voters are.  He  will\r\n\r\nhave  to work a bit in the dark as he will have only\r\n\r\nthe 1959 register to guide him. It will mean greater\r\n\r\ndifficulty to all the candidates, especially as they\r\n\r\nwill have to wait until the new revised register for\r\n\r\nAnson  is  out before they can send their manifestos\r\n\r\nand circulars to those people whose names appear  on\r\n\r\nthe  revised  electoral roll which, as the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas said, will not be ready until July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a bit difficult if the Government\r\n\r\nPrinting Office were to experience some breakdown in\r\n\r\nthe  machinery.  What will happen then  to  the\r\n\r\nby-election?  I  think it is only a  maximum  of  eight\r\n\r\nweeks  or  two  months between  Nomination  Day  and\r\n\r\nPolling  Day, and if the revised electoral  roll  is\r\n\r\nnot ready by then, there might be no by-election!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister also says that this amendment is\r\n\r\nto  enable  those whose names appear in  List  B  or\r\n\r\nthose  who  have made claims for their names  to  be\r\n\r\nregistered in the electoral roll to stand as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncandidates.   He   says   that   he   has   received\r\n\r\nrepresentation. I do not say that I do  not  believe\r\n\r\nhim, because there was an instance in Hong Lim where\r\n\r\na  prospective  candidate was not allowed  to  stand\r\n\r\nbecause  her  name did not appear in  the  electoral\r\n\r\nroll  and  there  was  a  scene  where  some  public\r\n\r\nmourning  took  place. In a way this did  give  some\r\n\r\nindication  to the public that it was  mourning  day\r\n\r\nfor the P.A.P. in Hong Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister sought to give the impression  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse that while the registers are being revised, it\r\n\r\nmight  not  be  possible to hold  a  by-election  in\r\n\r\nAnson. I got that impression from the Minister  when\r\n\r\nhe opened his speech this afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that impression is confirmed by what I read\r\n\r\nin the Straits Times of Wednesday, 24th May, on page\r\n\r\none. It reads, Mr Speaker, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Official announcement also stated that the\r\n\r\nGovernment would ask the Legislative Assembly at its\r\n\r\nsitting  tomorrow to approve a special  Bill,  which\r\n\r\nwould allow the by-election to proceed while the new\r\n\r\nAnson  electoral  register is  being  finalised  and\r\n\r\ncertified.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my understanding of that official statement, as\r\n\r\nprinted  in the Straits Times, is correct, it  seeks\r\n\r\nto   give   to   the   public  of   Singapore   this\r\n\r\nimpression - that because the electoral  roll  is  now\r\n\r\nbeing  revised and as the revision will take two  or\r\n\r\nthree months and while this revision is taking place\r\n\r\nno by-election can be held, and as the Government is\r\n\r\nanxious  that  Anson should not remain unrepresented\r\n\r\nin  the  Assembly for too long, the  Government  has\r\n\r\ntherefore  introduced this special Bill  which  will\r\n\r\nenable   the   electorate  of  Anson   to   have   a\r\n\r\nrepresentative in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my understanding of the Elections Ordinance\r\n\r\nis  that no revision need deter the Government  from\r\n\r\nholding  a by-election in Anson. In fact, the  whole\r\n\r\nbasis   of   the   Legislative  Assembly   Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance is that election will be held at the  time\r\n\r\nwhen a vacancy arises on the register then obtaining\r\n\r\nat that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime.  Mr Speaker, Sir, if my understanding of  the\r\n\r\nlaw  is correct, then the Government has been guilty\r\n\r\nof  issuing a statement which, on the face of it, is\r\n\r\nnot  in  keeping  with the law  as  it  stands.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  seeks to place itself  in  the  favoured\r\n\r\nposition  of  telling  the public  that  it  is  not\r\n\r\ndelaying the election and that what it is trying  to\r\n\r\ndo  is to hold the election earlier than is possible\r\n\r\nby  law.  Therefore, it is bringing in this  special\r\n\r\nBill  to enable an election at Anson to take  place.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  P.A.P.  Government  is  no\r\n\r\nchicken.  I am fully convinced in my own  mind  that\r\n\r\nthe Government, with all the assistance that it has,\r\n\r\nis  fully  aware that an election in Anson can  take\r\n\r\nplace  while  the electoral roll is  being  revised.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  one  asks  the  question.  Why  was   it\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the Ministry of Culture - I  think  it\r\n\r\nmust  have been the Ministry of Culture, because  it\r\n\r\nwas  an  official statement - to put out  a  statement\r\n\r\nwhich, on the face of it, is not in keeping with the\r\n\r\nlaw?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested, Mr Speaker, and suggested\r\n\r\nseriously,  that the Government has some  particular\r\n\r\ncandidate   in  mind  to  put  up  in   Anson,   but\r\n\r\nunfortunately  for  them, he  is  not  on  the  1959\r\n\r\nelectoral   register.  Therefore,  it   has   become\r\n\r\nnecessary, shall I say, to amend the law in order to\r\n\r\nsuit this particular individual, so that he might be\r\n\r\ngiven  the  privilege and the right to  contest  the\r\n\r\nelection  in Anson when the existing law denies  him\r\n\r\nthat right or privilege. Mr Speaker. Sir, it is for\r\n\r\nthe Government in its reply to explain the situation\r\n\r\nadequately.  I  do not accept the statement  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister that because one person has complained that\r\n\r\nhe or she had not been allowed to stand in Hong Lim,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   the  Government  has  been   conscience\r\n\r\nstricken  about the whole thing, and it  has  become\r\n\r\nnecessary to use the whole legislative machinery  to\r\n\r\nenable  this one person to contest the  Anson\r\n\r\nby-election.  I  am sufficiently a cynic, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  not  to  accept  that reason.  There  must  be\r\n\r\nsomething  more to it. And it is for the  Government\r\n\r\nto explain it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading the Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, it would\r\n\r\nappear  that those persons who would be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nstand as candidates might not get their names on the\r\n\r\nregisters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  time to vote, unless the Government extends  the\r\n\r\ntime to a date when it will become possible for  the\r\n\r\nregisters  to  be  finalised.  If  the  Minister  is\r\n\r\nseriously  suggesting that the  election  will  only\r\n\r\ntake place when the 1961 registers have been finally\r\n\r\nrevised and certified by the Returning Officer, then\r\n\r\nthe  time  for  claims  and objections  and  appeals\r\n\r\nagainst those claims and objections would have to be\r\n\r\ntaken  into  account;  then the  election  might  be\r\n\r\ndelayed  till  August  or  September.  Is   it   the\r\n\r\nintention  of  Government  then  not  to  hold   the\r\n\r\nelection  until  the  revised  registers  have  been\r\n\r\nfinally  certified by the Returning  Officer?  As  I\r\n\r\nread the Bill, Sir, it merely enables the Government\r\n\r\nto  hold  the election on the existing registers  as\r\n\r\nthey  now stand, with the addition of List  B,  with\r\n\r\nthe  addition of any person who now claims  or  will\r\n\r\nclaim that his name has been left out. As far  as  I\r\n\r\ncan see, Mr Speaker, Sir, it makes no provision  to\r\n\r\nenable persons whose names are on List B to vote  in\r\n\r\nthe  election.  The only way in which persons  whose\r\n\r\nnames  appear  on List B can vote would  be  if  the\r\n\r\nregisters  have been certified before  the  election\r\n\r\ntakes place. If, unfortunately, those registers  are\r\n\r\nnot  certified, then persons on List B cannot  vote.\r\n\r\nSo  we  have the anomalous situation of a  candidate\r\n\r\nwho  has  not got a vote in that particular area  or\r\n\r\nany  area  being  able to stand as a  candidate  for\r\n\r\nAnson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I cannot help people being\r\n\r\ncynical  or  pessimists, or  otherwise  abnormal  in\r\n\r\ntheir  attitude to life, but we would like  to  help\r\n\r\nthem  to understand what this legislation is  trying\r\n\r\nto  do.  For quite some time now the Census  Office,\r\n\r\ntogether  with the Elections Office, had  fixed  May\r\n\r\nfor  the  revision of the registers. These registers\r\n\r\nwere  last  revised in 1958. The date for  the  next\r\n\r\nrevision  was postponed from 1959 and 1960  to  take\r\n\r\nplace  in 1961, because we felt that it would  be  a\r\n\r\nwaste  of  effort  to have a yearly revision  whilst\r\n\r\nother  more important things were being looked into.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this operation had already been triggered\r\n\r\noff for quite some time before May 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are asking some odd thousand people - new\r\n\r\nvoters - to  go and check their names in the electoral\r\n\r\nroll - List B; those whose names have been struck off\r\n\r\nfrom the old register for various reasons, those who\r\n\r\nhave  now reached 21 since 1958. At the moment,  you\r\n\r\ncan only hold an election in Anson without this Bill\r\n\r\ncm  the old 1958 registers and you are going to have\r\n\r\nconfusion  not only in Anson but in the whole  town.\r\n\r\nEverybody  has just gone to check his  name  on  the\r\n\r\nregister.  Then he is told he cannot vote.  Election\r\n\r\nmust,  therefore, willy nilly take place on the  new\r\n\r\nregister.  That is the position. The  operation  has\r\n\r\nbeen launched for a revision of the register and  we\r\n\r\nhave to go through with it. In normal circumstances,\r\n\r\nwhat  would  happen  is that the register  would  be\r\n\r\nfinalised  in  September  and  could  be  used   for\r\n\r\nnomination in October. We are putting in overtime to\r\n\r\nfinish  the register in Anson by July so that voting\r\n\r\ncan take place in July. The other constituencies can\r\n\r\nbe  held  up, and they will probably be finished  in\r\n\r\nAugust.  But  in  July when voting  in  Anson  takes\r\n\r\nplace, all those who have gone to check their  names\r\n\r\nwill  find  that they are entitled to vote.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame time, there have been complaints that the names\r\n\r\nof some people have been left out from the register.\r\n\r\nThey  want  to  be candidates - whether sincerely  or\r\n\r\njust  as a guile is another matter. We say,  by  all\r\n\r\nmeans  be candidates. By all means, let us  vote  on\r\n\r\nthe  new  register. The 10th of June  is  fixed  for\r\n\r\nNomination Day for Anson. Anybody whose name  is  on\r\n\r\nList  B or on the old register is entitled to  be  a\r\n\r\ncandidate.  The  period for inspection  has  already\r\n\r\nclosed.  It  closed last Saturday.  Two  weeks  were\r\n\r\nallowed  for inspection. The inspection has  closed.\r\n\r\nThat is why we are taking this Bill today. All those\r\n\r\nwho have inspected the register and have found their\r\n\r\nnames there can be candidates. If they are in Anson,\r\n\r\nthey can be voters. That is the position. All we are\r\n\r\ndoing  is  to prevent a delay in the by-election  or\r\n\r\nthe by-election being carried out on an old register\r\n\r\nwhich is out of date\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  which, in view of the fact that this  operation\r\n\r\nto  revise  the register has already been  launched,\r\n\r\nwill  cause  confusion. People  have  gone  to  Post\r\n\r\nOffices  and have seen their names. If they are  now\r\n\r\ntold they cannot vote because this is being held  on\r\n\r\nthe  old  register, there will be a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position is simple. If the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  and  the  Member  for  Cairnhill  want  to  be\r\n\r\ncynical,  or  for  other  medical  or  psychological\r\n\r\nreasons are unhappy about it, I can do nothing about\r\n\r\nit.  All  I  can  do is to try and explain  to  them\r\n\r\nsimply  what this operation is all about. It  is  to\r\n\r\nenable  an  election in Anson to take  place  using\r\n\r\nthis  register which has already been  inspected  by\r\n\r\nthe   public,  and  ensuring  a  suitable   overtime\r\n\r\narrangement that the register is certificated before\r\n\r\nPolling Day. Sir, the Member for Farrer Park is  not\r\n\r\nthe  only person who, on reading the Bill, asks  why\r\n\r\nthere  has  been no provision that those on  List  B\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to vote in Anson. I am sorry  to  say\r\n\r\nthat,  for a person who is conversant with  the  law\r\n\r\nand  professionally holding himself out as a  person\r\n\r\nwho is prepared to advise other persons on the law,\r\n\r\nhe  had not bothered to look up the provisions which\r\n\r\nthe  State  Advocate-General would tell him.  It  is\r\n\r\nunnecessary  to have any special provision  in  this\r\n\r\nBill  to  say  that certification  will  take  place\r\n\r\nbefore polling. Certification must take place before\r\n\r\npolling before the register can be used; otherwise a\r\n\r\nfraud  on  the  public will have  been  perpetrated.\r\n\r\nSurely  the Member is not suggesting for one  moment\r\n\r\nthat  we are going to go through the whole elaborate\r\n\r\nprocess of legislation to speed up the election  and\r\n\r\nthen  on  Polling  Day say, \"Ladies  and  gentlemen,\r\n\r\nplease vote on the old register.\" Some 2,000 persons\r\n\r\nin  Anson whose names are on List B would thereby be\r\n\r\nturned  away, causing a great deal of  unhappiness,\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding and cynicism on a much bigger scale\r\n\r\nthan  it  has  already worked in this House  on  two\r\n\r\nMembers of the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> You have no statutory guarantee of\r\n\r\nthat, though!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not in\r\n\r\nthe  least bit averse to it, and I am quite sure  my\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Minister for Home Affairs,  would  be\r\n\r\nquite happy if the Member for Farrer Park would like\r\n\r\na  brief adjournment to move an amendment to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  there is certification.

I would like to\r\n\r\nmake the position of the Government quite clear. All\r\n\r\nwe  are doing is to ensure that there is an election\r\n\r\nheld  quickly, fairly, and with no confusion. I have\r\n\r\nexplained that the operation to revise the  register\r\n\r\nhad  been planned some one year before hand. It  was\r\n\r\ntriggered  off  for May and had been triggered  off.\r\n\r\nThousands  of people have gone to see this  register\r\n\r\nand  it  is impossible just to ignore this operation\r\n\r\nand say, \"Right, we go back to the old register.\"  I\r\n\r\ngive  this  House an alternative. So far as  we  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  it  is  a matter of  irrelevance  to  us\r\n\r\nwhether the election is held on the old register  or\r\n\r\non  the  new register. But as far as the people  are\r\n\r\nconcerned, it is important that there should  be  no\r\n\r\nconfusion. Those whose names are already put in List\r\n\r\nB,  and who have already inspected them, will expect\r\n\r\nto  go  and  vote. If the Opposition feel that  they\r\n\r\nwant the register to be certificated, then when  the\r\n\r\ntime  for division comes let them vote against  this\r\n\r\namendment, and the Government will allow  this  Bill\r\n\r\nto  be  defeated on the voice of the Opposition.  If\r\n\r\nthey say no to this Bill, then this Bill can go out.\r\n\r\nThe  register will be certificated in July  and  the\r\n\r\nelection can take place. We are quite happy to  have\r\n\r\nthis Bill and launch the by-election in June. If the\r\n\r\nOpposition  feel,  as  the Member  for  Tanglin  has\r\n\r\nsuggested,  that this is changing the rules  in  the\r\n\r\nmidst  of  the  game, then we say,  \"Right.  We  can\r\n\r\npostpone  the  game at the will of the  Opposition.\"\r\n\r\nLet  them  say no to this Bill. The Bill is scrapped\r\n\r\nand   nomination  can  take  place  in  July   after\r\n\r\ncertification.  If they say yes to this  Bill,  then\r\n\r\nnomination  can take place on the 10th of  June  and\r\n\r\npolling will take place - I give a solemn assurance - on\r\n\r\nthe new register in July.

Section 17 of\r\n\r\nthe  principal  Ordinance, which  is  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly Elections Ordinance,  reads  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`17. -(1) Every person who is entitled in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  this Ordinance to  have  his  name\r\n\r\nentered in any register of electors at a revision of\r\n\r\nthat  register and whose name has been omitted  from\r\n\r\nthat register and from List B or whose name has been\r\n\r\nincluded in List A, and who claims to have his  name\r\n\r\ninserted  or  retained as the case  may  be  in  the\r\n\r\nregister  may apply to the Registration  Officer  to\r\n\r\nhave his name inserted or retained therein.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  that, Mr Speaker, Sir, under section 17 (1)  it\r\n\r\nis  merely a claim that we know. Section 17 (1) does\r\n\r\nnot  speak about a \"valid\" claim. Now, clause 3 here\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any person whose name appears in List B or who\r\n\r\nhas  made  a  valid claim under sub-section  (1)  of\r\n\r\nsection 17 of the principal Ordinance...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>May  I, therefore, ask the Minister to explain  what\r\n\r\nexactly  he  means  by a \"valid claim\";  whether  he\r\n\r\ndistinguishes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  \"valid claim\" from a \"claim\" under section 17 (1)\r\n\r\nas  set  out  in the Singapore Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nElections Ordinance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not\r\n\r\nanticipate the legal aspects of this debate,  but  I\r\n\r\nshould  imagine the answer lies in the fact  that  a\r\n\r\nclaim  has to be first substantiated. All  kinds  of\r\n\r\nclaims can be made to a Returning Officer or to  the\r\n\r\nman in charge of the register. But the man in charge\r\n\r\nof  the register either allows or disallows a  claim\r\n\r\naccording  to whether it is in accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nfacts  and  according  to the  Law.  The  expression\r\n\r\n\"valid  claim\"  means one which  has  been  allowed,\r\n\r\nfound to be in accordance with the facts and the law\r\n\r\nby  the  officer in charge. Further I would like  to\r\n\r\nadd   that  as  far  as  these  List  B  voters  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  the  period for inspection  has  already\r\n\r\nclosed;   the  claims  and  objections   are   being\r\n\r\nconsidered and will be over, I believe, in  about  a\r\n\r\nfortnight. Thereafter, before the 10th of June,  the\r\n\r\nclaims  have either been accepted or they have  been\r\n\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has appreciated the point I raised.  If  I\r\n\r\nmay  pursue the matter further from there, the point\r\n\r\nthen,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, is in  clause  3 - a  \"valid\r\n\r\nclaim\".  So that a \"valid claim\" cannot arise  under\r\n\r\nclause  3 unless and until the claims and objections\r\n\r\nhave  been disposed of. Now, if a person's name  has\r\n\r\nbeen  left  out  of  List B, then  that  person  has\r\n\r\ncertain remedies. He proceeds then under section 11.\r\n\r\nThe  chronological sequence of revising a  register,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, is this. As the Hon. the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home Affairs has indicated, the registers  were\r\n\r\npublished  two weeks before last Monday.  They  were\r\n\r\ngiven  two weeks, which came to an end last  Monday,\r\n\r\nwhich  was  the 22nd of May. Then any  person  whose\r\n\r\nname  does not appear on List B can send in a claim.\r\n\r\nIf  a  person's name appears in List B, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, that is not the end of the problem. The problem\r\n\r\nis  just  about to start. Then the Returning Officer\r\n\r\nhas  to publish that list and within 10 days of  the\r\n\r\npublication of List B, any person\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  objects to any name on List B can then send  in\r\n\r\nan  objection. If the objection is sent in, then the\r\n\r\nRegistration  Officer must hold  a  public  inquiry.\r\n\r\nThat takes some time. Before the public inquiry  can\r\n\r\ntake place, both the objector and the person to whom\r\n\r\nobjection  is  taken must be called to  this  public\r\n\r\ninquiry. Evidence is then heard and the Registration\r\n\r\nOfficer  adjudicates upon the claim or the objection\r\n\r\nas the case may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my point is this. It is at that\r\n\r\npoint of time that it becomes a valid claim and  not\r\n\r\nbefore;  so that a claim, to become a \"valid claim\",\r\n\r\nmight take two to three months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the other case, Mr Speaker, where no\r\n\r\nobjection is made to a person whose name appears  on\r\n\r\nList B. Merely because his name appears on List B is\r\n\r\nnot  the  end of the matter. The proviso to  section\r\n\r\n11(9) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Provided that the Registration Officer may,\r\n\r\nwithout  any public inquiry as aforesaid, allow  any\r\n\r\nclaim in respect of which no objection has been made\r\n\r\nif  he is otherwise satisfied that such claim should\r\n\r\nbe  allowed and shall insert the claimants's name in\r\n\r\nthe register.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  that  in the case of a person to whose  name  no\r\n\r\nobjection  has  been taken, his claim becomes  valid\r\n\r\nonly  when  the  Registration Officer has  satisfied\r\n\r\nhimself that his name should be allowed to go on the\r\n\r\nregister. So we get two points of time when a  claim\r\n\r\ncan  become valid - in the case of a person  who  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  objected to when the Registrar  satisfies\r\n\r\nhimself that he is all right, and in the case  of  a\r\n\r\nperson who has been objected to after an inquiry has\r\n\r\ntaken  place  and the Registrar has  then  satisfied\r\n\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this is going to take some time - from two to\r\n\r\nthree months. So I ask the Minister what then is the\r\n\r\nmeaning  of  the phrase, \"or who has  made  a  valid\r\n\r\nclaim  under  subsection (1) of section  17  of  the\r\n\r\nprincipal Ordinance\"? Does it mean that the election\r\n\r\nwill be held up until such time as the Registrar has\r\n\r\nsatisfied  himself that in either case cited  by  me\r\n\r\nthat person has a valid claim?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark   delights  in  legal  quibbles.

I\r\n\r\nthink  this is a more convenient time for me to  say\r\n\r\nthis,  because in the Third Reading I will  have  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to speak only once. Some Members of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition are either deliberately dense, or perhaps\r\n\r\nthey   are  naturally  incapable  of  following   an\r\n\r\nargument  put  only once. The proposition  is  quite\r\n\r\nsimple. We intend to change no rules. It can make no\r\n\r\ndifference to the outcome whether you change or  you\r\n\r\ndo  not change the rules. All we are saying is this.\r\n\r\nA  by-election has to be held in Anson.  It  is  our\r\n\r\nintention to hold it as quickly as is convenient and\r\n\r\nin  keeping with decency when a Member has died.  We\r\n\r\nfeel   that  the  most  convenient  time   will   be\r\n\r\nimmediately after the National Day celebrations when\r\n\r\nwe go back to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Opposition feel that this is changing the\r\n\r\nrules, all they have to do when they vote is to  say\r\n\r\nno  and  the Bill will die. We will let the register\r\n\r\nin  Anson  be  certificated in July and polling  can\r\n\r\ntake place. But let it never be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid that we were not prepared to introduce a bit of\r\n\r\nlegislation to enable it to take place in  June.  It\r\n\r\nis  as  simple  as  that. We  can  argue  round  the\r\n\r\nmulberry  bush and inquiries can go on  for  months,\r\n\r\nbut  how  many  people  are involved?  In  the  last\r\n\r\nrevision  of the register, the Returning Officer - the\r\n\r\nman  in  charge - will tell you that there  were  not\r\n\r\nmore  than  20  to 30 objections for  the  whole  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. Is it suggested that all this  should  be\r\n\r\nheld up?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us assume that one objection is made in\r\n\r\nAnson - the one person being either on the register or\r\n\r\nclaiming  to  be on the register. He does  not  vote\r\n\r\nwhile  his claim is being adjudicated, hut  all  the\r\n\r\nother 2,000 odd voters plus the 8,000 voters on  the\r\n\r\nold  register can vote. That is all. It is as simple\r\n\r\nas that. I say sometimes perhaps the Opposition will\r\n\r\nhave to take the responsibility for legislation.  In\r\n\r\na  case  like this, we have taken the responsibility\r\n\r\nof  bringing forward this legislation in order  that\r\n\r\nthings can move. If the Opposition feel that this is\r\n\r\nnot  in  their interest and they do not  think  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  according  to  the rules,  let  them  vote\r\n\r\nagainst it. The by-election can be held up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is a strange thing, Sir, that the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  should  take  this  line  when  his\r\n\r\nGovernment, having taken the full responsibility for\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  should now talk as he is doing.  If  he\r\n\r\nfelt  it  was a national Bill, there was one  course\r\n\r\nopen  to him. He could have consulted the Opposition\r\n\r\nleaders before he brought in this Bill, but he never\r\n\r\ntook  the  trouble to do that. But now  when  he  is\r\n\r\nfaced with problems, he is trying to put the onus on\r\n\r\nthe Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, the point is that this\r\n\r\nis  a Bill which does not talk of enabling people to\r\n\r\nvote. It merely enables people to stand for election\r\n\r\nand  not to vote. If the law of the country is  that\r\n\r\nonly  a person who resides in a particular ward  can\r\n\r\nvote  or stand in that ward, then the problem  which\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister is speaking of might not  be  so\r\n\r\nserious.  But here, Mr Speaker, Sir, in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nirrespective of where you live and where your name\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappears  on the register, you can go and  stand  for\r\n\r\nelection in any division. Now, this is a Bill  which\r\n\r\nenables  people  whose  names  appear  on   List   B\r\n\r\nthroughout  the 51 electoral divisions to  stand  in\r\n\r\nAnson, and the Prime Minister keeps on talking about\r\n\r\nthe  Anson register. Really, Mr Speaker, Sir, I  do\r\n\r\nnot understand the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to\r\n\r\ncall for the file just to read out my minute to  the\r\n\r\nMinister asking him to clear with the State \r\n\r\nAdvocate-General  with  certainty that there is no  necessity\r\n\r\nfor a provision in the Bill to ensure that those  on\r\n\r\nList  B will be allowed to vote, and the answer that\r\n\r\ncame  back  from  the  S.A.G. was  that  it  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary  because  it is expected  to  certify  the\r\n\r\nregister  before polling takes place. That  is  all.\r\n\r\nThat is the key operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, it is not our business. Once it is\r\n\r\nsuggested that this is a partisan Bill, then  I  say\r\n\r\nwe  pass the ball back to the Opposition. It is  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  of the Government to govern. If this  were\r\n\r\nnot a partisan Bill, then I say we take it though in\r\n\r\nthe   national  interest  regardless  of  what   the\r\n\r\nOpposition say. But this is a Bill to ensure  a \r\n\r\nby-election   in  Anson,  in  which  Members   of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  or  individuals in the  Opposition  will\r\n\r\nbecome  interested parties, either via their parties\r\n\r\nor via individuals whom they may support. Therefore,\r\n\r\nif  it  is suggested for one moment, on a Bill which\r\n\r\nis  meant to introduce a political contest, that  it\r\n\r\nis  ensuring  laws  which are  unfavourable  to  the\r\n\r\nOpposition, then I say scrap it. And I leave  it  to\r\n\r\nthem either to take the Bill or scrap it.

This arose out of my query to the Minister\r\n\r\nas  to  the  need  for having a provision,  and  the\r\n\r\nS.A.G. wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I refer to your minute of the 17th May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I confirm that if the new register is revised and\r\n\r\ncertified  before  Polling Day, voters  on  the  new\r\n\r\nregister  will be eligible to vote and there  is  no\r\n\r\nneed for a separate provision.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe query that was sent up from the Minister is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The draft Ordinance is all right insofar as it\r\n\r\novercomes the provisions regarding candidates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you please check whether the new register\r\n\r\nwhich  is  now  being prepared  and  which  will  be\r\n\r\ncompleted whilst the by-election is on can  be  used\r\n\r\non Polling Day? That matter has to be settled beyond\r\n\r\nany doubt, namely, that on Polling Day it is the new\r\n\r\nregister with List B included that is to be used  as\r\n\r\nthe register for electors.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is from the Permanent Secretary to the S.A.G.:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Please confirm that voters on new registers\r\n\r\ncertified and published before polling day  will  be\r\n\r\neligible to vote on Polling Day.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  is  as simple as that. Let me say this. Whatever\r\n\r\nthe  faults  of this Government, we are prepared  to\r\n\r\ngovern  in  the national interest, but this  is  not\r\n\r\ngoverning in the national interest. This is a  piece\r\n\r\nof  legislation meant for a political  contest  will\r\n\r\ntake place in Anson either on 10th June - if this Bill\r\n\r\ngoes  through - or if it does not go through, it  can\r\n\r\ntake  place  in July. It makes no difference  to  us\r\n\r\nwhatsoever.   We  get  no  benefit,   political   or\r\n\r\notherwise,  by enforcing this Bill.  I  say  if  the\r\n\r\nOpposition feel in the least unhappy that an  unfair\r\n\r\nadvantage  is being taken, then let them say  no  to\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.  We propose to abstain and the Bill  will\r\n\r\ndie.  In  a  case where they have an  interest,  the\r\n\r\nOpposition must either be satisfied, or if they  are\r\n\r\nnot satisfied (whether they are right or wrong),  we\r\n\r\nare quite happy to let them have their way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know what\r\n\r\nhas  transpired  between the State  Advocate-General\r\n\r\nand  the  Ministers of the State, but all I know  is\r\n\r\nwhat  I  see in the Bill, and underneath  it  is  an\r\n\r\nExplanatory Statement which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This Bill will enable any person, whose name will\r\n\r\nbe included in the revised registers of electors for\r\n\r\n1961  [mark the words \"revised registers of electors\r\n\r\nfor 1961\"], to stand as a candidate for election for\r\n\r\nthe  electoral division of Anson, although his  name\r\n\r\nis not yet included in a register of electors.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It nowhere mentions the poor voter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the word proposed to be left\r\n\r\nout, be left out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Division, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 6; No, 1; Abstentions,\r\n\r\n39; Absent, 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n          Ayes              Abstentions\r\n\r\n     Abdul Hamid bin      Ahmad bin Ibrahim.\r\n\r\n      Haji Jumat.

However, it has been said\r\n\r\nby  the Member for Tanglin that the purpose of  this\r\n\r\nBill  is  to change the rules just before  the  game\r\n\r\ncommences.   It   is   to  dispel   completely   any\r\n\r\ninsinuation that we, on our side, wish to remain  in\r\n\r\npower  by fixing the rules of the game that we  have\r\n\r\nadopted the stand of abstaining from voting  on  the\r\n\r\nBill.   The  onus  therefore  now  lies   upon   the\r\n\r\nOpposition whether they want an early election after\r\n\r\nNomination   Day,  10th  June,  or  Nomination   Day\r\n\r\nsometime  after July when the new electoral register\r\n\r\nhas  been  certificated. Let it not be said  outside\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government is now afraid of an early \r\n\r\nby-election  in Anson. Let it not be said that  we  are\r\n\r\nworried about holding an early by-election in Anson.\r\n\r\nIf  there is any delay in the Anson by-election, the\r\n\r\nOpposition must bear the responsibility for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this must be carefully clarified so that\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the public will be able  to  understand\r\n\r\nthat  if Nomination Day does not take place on  June\r\n\r\n10th, it will be because the Opposition Parties have\r\n\r\ninsisted that this Bill should lapse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let us get\r\n\r\nthis  thing in the right perspective. Nobody  forced\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to state yesterday that  Nomination\r\n\r\nDay  is  to  be the 10th of June. The Government  is\r\n\r\nfully aware of its own intentions to carry this Bill\r\n\r\n(which  is now receiving its Third Reading)  through\r\n\r\nall  stages today. The Minister, in moving the Bill,\r\n\r\nsaid  that Nomination Day would be the 10th of June,\r\n\r\nbut that Polling Day would take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplace  after the revised register had been completed\r\n\r\nor  printed; and that would be sometime in July.  He\r\n\r\nwas  not able to give a specific date. I pointed out\r\n\r\nto  him,  Sir, that under the law there is a certain\r\n\r\ntime  limit between Nomination Day and Polling  Day.\r\n\r\nIf,  just  by a twist of circumstance - an unfortunate\r\n\r\ncircumstance at that - the Government Printing  Office\r\n\r\nwere  to suffer a breakdown and the electoral  rolls\r\n\r\ncould  not  be ready, how are we going to  carry  on\r\n\r\nwith  the  by-election? Knowing that  it  was  their\r\n\r\nintention  to  table this Bill today  and  carry  it\r\n\r\nthrough  all stages, surely the Government, if  they\r\n\r\nhad  thought of not wanting to put the Anson  voters\r\n\r\nin  an  embarrassing position, could  have  declared\r\n\r\nthat  Polling Day could be some day later than  10th\r\n\r\nJune.  There was no need for them to show that  they\r\n\r\nwere  anxious for an early Nomination Day and  leave\r\n\r\nPolling Day to fate, as to when and how fast the new\r\n\r\nelectoral registers could be completed.

This is, of course, due to the\r\n\r\nfact that the debate on this Bill has taken an\r\n\r\nunprecedented turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill itself is only concerned with allowing\r\n\r\nthose whose names appear in List B or those who have\r\n\r\nmade  claims  under section 11 of the  Ordinance  to\r\n\r\nstand as candidates for the by-election in Anson. It\r\n\r\nhas  nothing to do with the right to vote  of  those\r\n\r\nwhose names appear in List B. We are not saying that\r\n\r\nthe  Government should hold this by-election on  the\r\n\r\nold register. If they want it on the new register or\r\n\r\non any register, the Opposition are prepared to meet\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Just to clarify the position,\r\n\r\nSir.  This is an unusual bit of legislation in  that\r\n\r\nthe general public are not interested in it. This is\r\n\r\nlegislation   meant   for  political   parties.   It\r\n\r\ninaugurates a political contest, and only  political\r\n\r\nparties and politicians are interested in the  Bill.\r\n\r\nIt  is absolutely important and fundamental that  no\r\n\r\ndoubts  be cast on the proposition that the  contest\r\n\r\nshould  be fair and equal. We have put forward  this\r\n\r\nBill because we believe that this is a fair and just\r\n\r\nway  of  doing it. If the Opposition feel,  as  they\r\n\r\nhave  indicated on the Second Reading, that this  is\r\n\r\nunfair and unequal, all they have to do is to say no\r\n\r\nto the Bill, and it lapses. It is as simple as that.\r\n\r\nBut  they cannot have it both ways. On the one hand,\r\n\r\nthey cannot expect the Government to carry this Bill\r\n\r\nthrough in the teeth of their opposition, and  then,\r\n\r\non  the other hand, for them to go out and say, \"Ah,\r\n\r\nwhat  a  wicked Government; fixing the rules of  the\r\n\r\ngame  against the Opposition!\" We are doing no  such\r\n\r\nthing.  All we are doing is to ensure that a regular\r\n\r\nand   proper   election  be   held   in   the   best\r\n\r\ncircumstances possible.

The  concept\r\n\r\nfor  a  Committee of Privileges is not really a  new\r\n\r\none.  It  has  been  the  practice  in  Legislatures\r\n\r\nelsewhere   to   have   a  Standing   Committee   of\r\n\r\nPrivileges.  The purpose of such a Committee  is  to\r\n\r\nassist  the Speaker in upholding the dignity,\r\n\r\nself-respect  and honour of the legislating body  and  to\r\n\r\nprevent  the  Legislature from degenerating  into  a\r\n\r\nbawdy House during debates. We in this House have  a\r\n\r\nduly in maintaining the confidence and faith of  the\r\n\r\npeople   in  the  Assembly  as  an  honourable   and\r\n\r\nrespectable legislating body; otherwise we will also\r\n\r\ngo  the  same way as other bodies in those countries\r\n\r\nwhere there is despair in the possibility of working\r\n\r\na democratic parliamentary system. If ever we should\r\n\r\nreach that stage, the least that can happen to us in\r\n\r\nthis  House  is  that  we will  disappear.  But  the\r\n\r\ngreater consideration is the uncertain future of the\r\n\r\ncountry, the people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the  people's children. For this consideration,\r\n\r\nand   this   consideration  alone,   we,   who   are\r\n\r\nresponsible  to the people, have the obligation  and\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility to nip in the bud any deliberate\r\n\r\nor  intentional  action that can only  have  as  its\r\n\r\nconsequence  the  undermining  of  the  dignity  and\r\n\r\nrespectability of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On looking back, I must say I am a little\r\n\r\nastonished that the Assembly has had to wait for six\r\n\r\nyears  to  provide for a Committee of Privileges  in\r\n\r\nits  Standing Orders, when it has been the  practice\r\n\r\nof  legislating  parliaments in other  countries  to\r\n\r\nhave  a Standing Committee of Privileges. It  is  my\r\n\r\nhope,  as Leader of the House, that it will  not  be\r\n\r\nfrequent  that  matters  in this  Assembly  will  be\r\n\r\nreferred  to the Committee of Privileges. We  accept\r\n\r\nthat  Members  of  the  House have  the  liberty  of\r\n\r\nspeech,  but  at  the same time  we  as  responsible\r\n\r\nMembers  must distinguish between liberty of  speech\r\n\r\nand licence of speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be the function of this Committee of\r\n\r\nPrivileges  to keep a watching brief  over  what  is\r\n\r\nuttered  in this House. The parliamentary system  is\r\n\r\nyoung  in  Singapore and, because of its  youth,  we\r\n\r\nhave  yet to develop our own system of a traditional\r\n\r\ninstitution.  It  is  one thing  making  clever  and\r\n\r\nartful speeches, but another thing being wise. It is\r\n\r\none thing being rash and foolhardy and another thing\r\n\r\nbeing  brave.  But then the virtues  of  wisdom  and\r\n\r\nmaturity  can only be acquired through  the  painful\r\n\r\nexperience of trial and error.

It is also my view that such a Committee\r\n\r\nshould  have delegated powers instead of  having  to\r\n\r\nrefer  back their findings to this Assembly, because\r\n\r\notherwise  what would happen is that any person  who\r\n\r\nis  faced  with a complaint of a breach of privilege\r\n\r\nmay find himself faced with persons who are the jury\r\n\r\nand,  at  the  same time, the judges, witnesses  and\r\n\r\nperhaps, at the same time, the accusers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that with the result of the Hong Lim\r\n\r\nby-election, what happened in this Assembly five months\r\n\r\nago   has  not  been  approved  by  the  people   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I have said earlier\r\n\r\nthat  as privileged Members of the House it  is  the\r\n\r\nbounden  duty of each and everyone of us to maintain\r\n\r\na  certain  degree of dignity, truth,  decorum,  and\r\n\r\nself-respect in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are bound by the Legislative Assembly (Powers\r\n\r\nand  Privileges) Ordinance and therefore,  we,  more\r\n\r\nthan  any  other  people, have a greater  degree  of\r\n\r\nliberty  of  speech.  But, having  been  given  this\r\n\r\nprivilege,  it  is up to us to see  that  no  Member\r\n\r\nabuses  it.  If  such an abuse has  been  committed,\r\n\r\nsurely it should be referred to the House; and if it\r\n\r\nis  referred to the House, the correct procedure, as\r\n\r\nis  done in Parliaments elsewhere, is to refer it to\r\n\r\nthe   Committees   of  Privileges   which   are   so\r\n\r\nconstituted  as  to  represent proportionately  both\r\n\r\nsides  of  the House. In fact, Mr Speaker,  as  you\r\n\r\nyourself are aware, in the Standing Orders Committee\r\n\r\nI made a certain suggestion that provision should be\r\n\r\nso  made  that there must always be Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition in the Committee of Privileges because an\r\n\r\noccasion  may arise when, let us say, you have  only\r\n\r\ntwo  Members of the Opposition on this Committee and\r\n\r\nthese   two  Members  themselves  are  the  involved\r\n\r\nparties,  and  then the Government Members  who  are\r\n\r\nleft in this Committee of Privileges would be placed\r\n\r\nin  an invidious position of having to deliberate in\r\n\r\nthe absence of any Member\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the opposite side.

At heart, the kidnapper is\r\n\r\na  cowardly  adventurer, who banks on  the  wall  of\r\n\r\nsilence built by his victims to protect him from the\r\n\r\nforces of law and order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of this Bill - a similar Bill has\r\n\r\nalso  been  introduced by the Federation  Government \r\n\r\n- does not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmean  that the Government has not been taking strong\r\n\r\nand  effective  action  to  combat  this  kidnapping\r\n\r\nmenace,  which has reared its ugly and evil head  in\r\n\r\nrecent   years  and  caused  alarm  and  nervousness\r\n\r\nespecially   among   the   wealthy   merchants   and\r\n\r\nbusinessmen.  Indeed since this Government  came  to\r\n\r\npower,  substantial results have been achieved.  Not\r\n\r\nonly were protective and preventive measures carried\r\n\r\nout,  but  as  a result of intensive and painstaking\r\n\r\ninvestigations by the Police, a number of kidnapping\r\n\r\ngangs  were  broken up, several thugs and  gangsters\r\n\r\ninvolved  in kidnapping detained under the  Criminal\r\n\r\nLaw    (Temporary   Provisions)   Ordinance,    some\r\n\r\nkidnappers  convicted  in Court  and  the  notorious\r\n\r\ngangster  and  kidnapper, Oh Kim  Kee,  whose  short\r\n\r\nreign of terror was largely due to the conspiracy of\r\n\r\nsilence  between him and his victims, was shot  dead\r\n\r\nand  his  accomplices captured.  Much  of  this  was\r\n\r\nachieved  by  the efforts of the Police  themselves,\r\n\r\ndespite  the reluctance on the part of many  victims\r\n\r\nand their relatives and agents to talk or co-operate\r\n\r\nwith the Police. Nothing is more frustrating to  the\r\n\r\nPolice  than to find their efforts to help the  very\r\n\r\npeople who need help badly, bogged down by the\r\n\r\ntight-lipped  silence and blank stares of those  who  have\r\n\r\nonly  to  open  their mouths to  bring  about  quick\r\n\r\nretribution to these evil-doers. But much more could\r\n\r\nhave  been achieved and ought to have been  achieved\r\n\r\nand  better results obtained, if there had been  the\r\n\r\nwill  to  resist and sincere co-operation  with  the\r\n\r\nPolice  manifested. The Government is determined  to\r\n\r\nwipe  out the kidnapping menace and it is hoped that\r\n\r\nthe  wide  powers  in this new legislation  will  be\r\n\r\nfully appreciated by the public who should show more\r\n\r\npublic-spiritedness  and  wholehearted  co-operation\r\n\r\nwith the Police in the onslaught against crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present, under the existing provisions of\r\n\r\nthe  Penal Code, there is no suitable punishment  of\r\n\r\ntreating kidnapping for ransom as an aggravated form\r\n\r\nof  ordinary  kidnapping or  abduction.  Under  this\r\n\r\nPunishment  of  Kidnapping  Bill,  each  element  of\r\n\r\nkidnapping is made\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npunishable.  As you are aware, Sir, the elements  of\r\n\r\nkidnapping are abduction plus wrongful restraint  or\r\n\r\nwrongful confinement, and, under this Bill, each  of\r\n\r\nthese  elements is punishable, if it is  perpetrated\r\n\r\nfor ransom. Clause 3 of the Bill makes it an offence\r\n\r\nfor  a  person  to  abduct, wrongfully  restrain  or\r\n\r\nwrongfully confine any other person with  intent  to\r\n\r\nhold such person for ransom, and, on conviction,  he\r\n\r\nshall  be  punished with death or  imprisonment  for\r\n\r\nlife  and, if the sentence is imprisonment, he shall\r\n\r\nbe  liable  to  caning. Clauses 4  and  5  make  the\r\n\r\nreceiver  of ransom money or property, knowing  that\r\n\r\nsuch money or property has been given as ransom, and\r\n\r\nthe  person who negotiates to obtain ransom for  the\r\n\r\nrelease   of   any  person  abducted  or  wrongfully\r\n\r\nrestrained or confined, to be guilty of offences and\r\n\r\nliable,  on  conviction, to a  term  in  prison  not\r\n\r\nexceeding ten years and also to caning. Provision is\r\n\r\nalso  made  in clause 5 for any person who knowingly\r\n\r\nnegotiates to pay or pays or provides funds for  the\r\n\r\npayment of any ransom to procure the release of  any\r\n\r\nperson,  who  has  been  wrongfully  restrained   or\r\n\r\nwrongfully  confined,  to be guilty  of  an  offence\r\n\r\npunishable   with  imprisonment  for  a   term   not\r\n\r\nexceeding seven years and also liable to a fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 6 of the Bill, power is given to the\r\n\r\nPublic  Prosecutor to order any bank to  freeze  any\r\n\r\nbanking  account,  where he is  satisfied  that  the\r\n\r\nmoney may be withdrawn for the payment of any ransom\r\n\r\nfor  the  release  of any person,  and  it  makes  a\r\n\r\nmanager  or  a banker, who fails to comply  with  an\r\n\r\norder  of  the  Public  Prosecutor,  guilty  of   an\r\n\r\noffence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 (Public Prosecutor's power to order\r\n\r\ninspection of books, accounts, receipts, vouchers or\r\n\r\nother  documents  by the Police), clause  8  (Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor's  powers to obtain information),  clause\r\n\r\n12 (evidence of accomplice not to be deemed unworthy\r\n\r\nof  credit because he has paid or negotiated to  pay\r\n\r\nransom),  clause 13 (evidence of pecuniary resources\r\n\r\nor  property, disproportionate to his known  income)\r\n\r\nand   clause   14  (protection  of  informers)   are\r\n\r\nprovisions  taken from the Prevention of  Corruption\r\n\r\nOrdinance, No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n39  of 1960, and are included in the Bill, as it  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  that they will facilitate investigations\r\n\r\ninto the offences under this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Bill makes it the duty of any\r\n\r\nperson,  who is aware of the commission  or  of  the\r\n\r\nintention  of any person to commit an offence  under\r\n\r\nthis Bill, immediately to give that information to a\r\n\r\npolice  officer; and this clause also  provides  for\r\n\r\nthe  punishment of any person who fails to give such\r\n\r\ninformation to a police officer.

It will be noted that the death sentence\r\n\r\nis   not  mandatory  but  is  only  provided  as  an\r\n\r\nalternative  to  life  imprisonment,  and  this   is\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  the punishment provided  for  using  or\r\n\r\nattempting to use, arms under section 4 of the  Arms\r\n\r\nOffences Ordinance. This Bill should be regarded  as\r\n\r\na stern warning that kidnapping does not pay. Should\r\n\r\nthere be any future kidnapping case, it could become\r\n\r\nan  appointment with death or an invitation to  life\r\n\r\nincarceration for the kidnapper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Ong Pang Boon].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 3 inclusive ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I propose to take all the remaining\r\n\r\nclauses  together,  unless any Member  indicates  he\r\n\r\nwishes to speak on any particular clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I wish to speak on clause 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I will take clauses 4 and 5 then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 and 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That clause 6 stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this\r\n\r\nparticular  clause,  if  fully  carried  out,  might\r\n\r\nresult in great hardship to the workers.

This  was  originally  a  Scottish\r\n\r\ndoctrine  but  was  imported  into  England  by  the\r\n\r\nHomicide  Act,  1957. The present  law  relating  to\r\n\r\ninsanity  is  contained in section 84 of  the  Penal\r\n\r\nCode which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing is an offence which is done by a person\r\n\r\nwho,  at  the  time  of  doing  it,  by  reason   of\r\n\r\nunsoundness  of  mind, is incapable of  knowing  the\r\n\r\nnature  of  the  act, or that he is  doing  what  is\r\n\r\neither wrong or contrary to law.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provision, Sir, is based on the so-called\r\n\r\nM'Naghten  Rules, which summarised the advice  given\r\n\r\nby  the  Judges to the House of Lords in M'Naghten's\r\n\r\nCase  in  1843.  According to  this  provision,  the\r\n\r\nrelevant test of insanity is a legal test and not  a\r\n\r\nmedical  or  psychiatric test. For  the  defence  of\r\n\r\ninsanity  to  succeed, it is necessary to  establish\r\n\r\nthat  the accused was suffering at the time  of  the\r\n\r\noffence  from a defect of reason due to  disease  of\r\n\r\nthe  mind so that he either did not know what he was\r\n\r\ndoing  or  did  not know that it was wrong.  If  the\r\n\r\naccused is not suffering from a disease of the  mind\r\n\r\nor  is  not suffering from a form of insanity  which\r\n\r\naffects  the  intellectual powers  as  distinguished\r\n\r\nfrom  the  will  or emotions, he is not  within  the\r\n\r\nM'Naghten Rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill, which is based on section 2\r\n\r\nof the Homicide Act, 1957, of England, provides that\r\n\r\nculpable  homicide  shall  not  be  murder  if   the\r\n\r\noffender was suffering from such abnormality of mind\r\n\r\n(whether  arising from a condition  of  arrested  or retarded development of mind or any inherent  causes or  induced  by  disease or injury) as substantially\r\n\r\nimpaired his mental responsibility for his acts  and\r\n\r\nomissions in causing the death or being a  party  to\r\n\r\ncausing   the  death.  The  effect,  Sir,  is   that\r\n\r\ndiminished   responsibility  will  be  a  mitigating\r\n\r\nfactor  and, to quote from the report of  the  Royal\r\n\r\nCommission on Capital Punishment in England, it is a\r\n\r\n\"device  to enable the courts to take account  of  a\r\n\r\nspecial  category  of  mitigating  circumstances  in\r\n\r\ncases  of  murder and to avoid passing  sentence  of\r\n\r\ndeath in cases where such circumstances exist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exception of diminished responsibility is\r\n\r\nquite  different  from  that of  insanity.  Insanity\r\n\r\ncovered by the M'Naghten Rules and section 84 of the\r\n\r\nPenal  Code  is  a complete defence leading  to  the\r\n\r\nverdict of acquittal while diminished responsibility\r\n\r\nmerely reduces the offence to culpable homicide  not\r\n\r\namounting to murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of the new Exception 7 to section\r\n\r\n300  of  the  Penal Code, which are proposed  to  be\r\n\r\ninserted  by  clause  2 of the  Bill,  cover  mental\r\n\r\nabnormality  whether induced by mental  or  physical\r\n\r\ndisease or injury or arising from mental\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeficiency  or  other inherent causes.  These  words\r\n\r\nwould appear to cover mental abnormality due to  any\r\n\r\nform of insanity, to mental defectiveness, epilepsy,\r\n\r\npsycho  neurosis  arising from inherent  causes  and\r\n\r\nforms  of  psychopathic  personality  arising   from\r\n\r\narrested  or retarded development of the  mind.  The\r\n\r\nonus  of  proving that he comes within the exception\r\n\r\nis   by  virtue  of  section  106  of  the  Evidence\r\n\r\nOrdinance  on  the accused, and it  is  for  him  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the  jury not only that abnormality  within\r\n\r\nthe definition contained in the Exception existed at\r\n\r\nthe  time of the offence, but that it was of such  a\r\n\r\ndegree  that  it substantially impaired  his  mental\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  the  acts  with  which  he   is\r\n\r\ncharged. The use of the term \"mental responsibility\"\r\n\r\nmakes  it  clear that it is not legal responsibility\r\n\r\nwhich   is   in   question  at  this  point.   Legal\r\n\r\nresponsibility   is  diminished  if   the   criteria\r\n\r\ncontained  in  the  Exception  are  satisfied,   but\r\n\r\ndiminution of legal responsibility is not itself one\r\n\r\nof those criteria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctrine of diminished responsibility has been\r\n\r\napplied  in England for over five years and  has  on\r\n\r\nthe  whole  been applied successfully. The  doctrine\r\n\r\nhas  also  been adopted by a number of  Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncountries and recently the Judicial Committee of the\r\n\r\nPrivy Council has given authoritative advice on  the\r\n\r\napplication of the doctrine in the case of  Rose  vs\r\n\r\nthe  Queen, in an appeal from the Supreme  Court  of\r\n\r\nthe Bahama Islands. In the English case of Regina vs\r\n\r\nByrne  (1960) 2 QB 396 Lord Chief Justice Parker  in\r\n\r\ndelivering  the  judgment of the Court  of  Criminal\r\n\r\nAppeal said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`\"Abnormality of mind\" which has to be contrasted\r\n\r\nwith  the  time-honoured expression in the M'Naghten\r\n\r\nRules  \"defect of reason\" means a state of  mind  so\r\n\r\ndifferent  from that of ordinary human  beings  that\r\n\r\nthe  reasonable  man  would term  it  abnormal.  The\r\n\r\nexpression  \"mental  responsibility  for  his  acts\"\r\n\r\npoints to a consideration of the extent to which the\r\n\r\naccused's  mind is answerable for his physical  acts\r\n\r\nwhich must include a consideration of the extent  of\r\n\r\nhis  ability  to exercise will power to control  his\r\n\r\nphysical acts'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord Chief Justice then went on to cite from\r\n\r\nScots  cases  indicating that \"such  abnormality  as\r\n\r\nsubstantially  impairs  his  mental  responsibility\"\r\n\r\ninvolved  a  mental state which in popular  language\r\n\r\n(not that of the M'Naghten Rules)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na jury would regard as amounting to partial insanity\r\n\r\nor being on the borderline of insanity. Lord Tucker,\r\n\r\nin  giving the opinion of the Judicial Committee  of\r\n\r\nthe Privy Council in Rose vs the Queen, referred  to\r\n\r\nthe case of Regina vs Byrne and said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Their Lordships respectfully accept this\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of the words \"abnormality  of  mind\"\r\n\r\nand  \"mental  responsibility\" as  authoritative  and\r\n\r\ncorrect. They would not, however, consider that  the\r\n\r\nCourt  of Criminal Appeal was intending to lay  down\r\n\r\nthat  in  every  case the jury must  necessarily  be\r\n\r\ndirected  that  the  test  was  always  to  be   the\r\n\r\nborderline  of  insanity. There might  be  cases  in\r\n\r\nwhich the abnormality of mind relied upon could  not\r\n\r\nreadily   be   related  to  any  of  the   generally\r\n\r\nrecognized   types  of  \"insanity\".   If,   however,\r\n\r\ninsanity  was  to  be taken into  consideration,  as\r\n\r\nundoubtedly would usually be the case, the word must\r\n\r\nbe used in its broad popular sense. It could not too\r\n\r\noften  be emphasized that there was no formula  that\r\n\r\ncould safety be used in every case - the direction  to\r\n\r\nthe  jury  must always be related to the  particular\r\n\r\nevidence  that  had been given and  there  might  be\r\n\r\ncases  where  the words \"borderline\" and  \"insanity\"\r\n\r\nmight not be helpful.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctrine of \"diminished responsibility\" was\r\n\r\nconsidered at the United Nations Seminar on the role\r\n\r\nof the Substantive Criminal Law in the protection of\r\n\r\nHuman Rights held at Tokyo last year and the Seminar\r\n\r\nin  its  report  recommended  the  adoption  of  the\r\n\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other important amendment made by the Bill is\r\n\r\ncontained  in  clause 6, which seeks  to  widen  the\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"stolen property\" to include  property\r\n\r\ninto or for which stolen property has been converted\r\n\r\nor exchanged. This follows the provisions of section\r\n\r\n46  (1) of the United Kingdom Larceny Act, 1916, and\r\n\r\nwill  enable  a  prosecution  to  be  instituted  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  property into which or  for  which  the\r\n\r\nproperty  actually  stolen  has  been  converted  or\r\n\r\nexchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill seek to provide that\r\n\r\nthe  punishment  of caning may be  imposed  for  the\r\n\r\noffence of voluntarily causing hurt or grevious hurt\r\n\r\nto extort property or to constrain the commission of\r\n\r\nan  illegal  act.  As caning is already  a  possible\r\n\r\npunishment  for  the  offence of  extortion,  it  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  that  it  should  be  available   as   a\r\n\r\npunishment where hurt or grevious hurt is caused  to\r\n\r\ncommit extortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill is complementary to and\r\n\r\nconsequential on the Punishment of Kidnapping  Bill.\r\n\r\nIt  seeks  to  make  the offence  of  kidnapping  or\r\n\r\nabducting  in order to murder punishable with  death\r\n\r\nor  imprisonment  for life (instead of  imprisonment\r\n\r\nfor  life  or imprisonment which may extend  to  ten\r\n\r\nyears as at present).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Byrne].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported, without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>POLICE CADET CORPS BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.17 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker.

We were searching for an organisation  which\r\n\r\nwould  fit  itself into the economic situation  and\r\n\r\nstructure  of  Singapore.  Economically,  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday  is in a crucial stage of transition. On  the\r\n\r\none  hand,  we have to do our best to maintain  and\r\n\r\nexpand our trade, which has sustained Singapore  so\r\n\r\nlong  and  so  well. At the same  time,  using  the\r\n\r\nprofits  and the organisation of trade as a  spring\r\n\r\nboard,   we  have  to  industrialise  quickly   and\r\n\r\nefficiently so that, in the near future,  we  shall\r\n\r\nbe  able to sell to our neighbours the products  of\r\n\r\nour  labour instead of merely the services  of  our\r\n\r\nentrepot   skill.   Countries   around    us    are\r\n\r\nincreasingly pursuing, and justifiably so, a policy\r\n\r\nof  direct  trade.  In  this  expansion  of  direct\r\n\r\ntrading  relations, Singapore can hope to play  its\r\n\r\nrole by being the supplier of manufactured products\r\n\r\nlabelled  \"Made in Singapore\". Being  strategically\r\n\r\nlocated, the savings in freight would be one factor\r\n\r\nwhich will enable us to sell quickly and cheaply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring about this economic transformation, on\r\n\r\nwhich  our  survival depends, the Government  cannot\r\n\r\nadopt  a purely laissez faire attitude. Nor  can  it\r\n\r\nplay   a   simple  administrative   role   of   just\r\n\r\nmaintaining civil stability and providing the  basic\r\n\r\nessential   services.  To  initiate  the   road   to\r\n\r\nindustrialisation,  the Government  has  to  play  a\r\n\r\npositive  and direct role. The Economic  Development\r\n\r\nBoard which we seek to set up under the authority of\r\n\r\nthe Bill now before the House will be the agency  of\r\n\r\nGovernment   to   direct  this   transformation   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has taken the Government nearly two years to\r\n\r\nprepare   for  the  establishment  of  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board. To some this may appear to be  an\r\n\r\nunduly long period. But I myself do not accept  this\r\n\r\nview.  This is going to be one of the most important\r\n\r\nsteps to be taken by the Government. It is obviously\r\n\r\nnecessary that measures of such importance should be\r\n\r\nmade only after careful thought and preparation. May\r\n\r\nI  outline  some of the preliminary steps  which  we\r\n\r\nhave taken before creating this Board?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first major move that the Government made was\r\n\r\nto   ask  for  teams  of  international  experts  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate  the  potentialities  of  expansion   in\r\n\r\ncertain  specific  industries. Members  are  already\r\n\r\naware of the work that is now being carried out  and\r\n\r\nwill  soon  be  completed  by  the  U.N.  Industrial\r\n\r\nMission headed by Dr A. Winsemius. Why is this step\r\n\r\nnecessary?  Could  we not have  gone  ahead  without\r\n\r\nseeking  the opinion of experts. The answer is  that\r\n\r\nin   attempting  any  major  transformation  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy, it is well to have available the opinion of\r\n\r\nthe  best  brains that we can get hold of.  For  the\r\n\r\neconomic  position of Singapore is  unique  and  the\r\n\r\nexperience  of  other and larger countries  in  Asia\r\n\r\nwhich    are   now   attempting   to   industrialise\r\n\r\nthemselves,  offers us no guidance  whatsoever.  The\r\n\r\nreasons  are simple and have been repeated  ever  so\r\n\r\noften.  We  do  not  have,  as  they  have,  natural\r\n\r\nresources which can provide the raw\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaterials for industrialisation. In itself  this  is\r\n\r\nnot   so  important  as  these  raw  materials   are\r\n\r\naccessible  from  neighbouring countries.  But  more\r\n\r\nimportant  than  this is the size  of  the  domestic\r\n\r\nmarket  which  imposes  a limit  to  the  extent  of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation based on it. In this  respect,  we\r\n\r\ndiffer fundamentally from the larger countries  such\r\n\r\nas  India  and  Pakistan, or even  the  medium-sized\r\n\r\ncountries  in Asia such as Thailand or Burma.  These\r\n\r\ncountries have the advantage that the home  consumer\r\n\r\ndemand  is  large and therefore the question  of  an\r\n\r\nadequate  market for the products of  industry  does\r\n\r\nnot present a problem in such an acute form that  it\r\n\r\ndoes to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the further added complication of the\r\n\r\nfree   port  status  of  our  island  State.   While\r\n\r\nadjustments can be made here and there to this  free\r\n\r\nport  status, no precipitate action in the  interest\r\n\r\nof rapid industrialisation can be contemplated which\r\n\r\nwould  cause such a major dislocation of the economy\r\n\r\nthat  the  gain through industrialisation  would  be\r\n\r\noutweighed  by  the  loss  of  our  standing  as  an\r\n\r\nentrepot market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These considerations do not apply to other Asian\r\n\r\ncountries  which  are attempting  to  industrialise.\r\n\r\nTheir  problems  and difficulties  stem  from  other\r\n\r\ncauses, on which I need not embark here. But,  faced\r\n\r\nas  we  are in this unique position, it is necessary\r\n\r\nto  seek advice from experts abroad. We lost  little\r\n\r\ntime in doing so, and in Singapore today we have, in\r\n\r\naddition  to  the  U.N. Industrial Mission,  another\r\n\r\nMission  to  study  the  establishment  of  a  steel\r\n\r\nindustry in Singapore. Both these Missions contained\r\n\r\nmen of ability and experience and they have given us\r\n\r\nnew  insights into the nature of the problem  facing\r\n\r\nus and the solutions that we can apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now reached the stage when we can take\r\n\r\nthis   major   move   to  establish   the   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Board.  The  acute   difficulties   in\r\n\r\nrecruiting  staff  to  the Board,  which  will  need\r\n\r\nindustrial  economists, engineers, and other  expert\r\n\r\npersonnel,  which  we  have experienced,  have  been\r\n\r\npartially solved. As I announced in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly on a previous occasion, we  have  been\r\n\r\nable  to  get experts from countries abroad such  as\r\n\r\nIndia  and Israel, and with these as the nucleus  we\r\n\r\npropose to press ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with some of the major functions\r\n\r\nof  the Board. First, the Board will investigate and\r\n\r\nevaluate   industrial  opportunities.   The   market\r\n\r\npotential, availability of raw materials, production\r\n\r\ncosts,  capital  requirements  and  other  technical\r\n\r\nfactors,  will be worked out and assessed.  When  an\r\n\r\nindustry is considered feasible, industrialists will\r\n\r\nbe  invited to consider the establishment of such an\r\n\r\nindustry,  with  financial and technical  assistance\r\n\r\nfrom  abroad  if  necessary.  It  may  be  that  the\r\n\r\nindustrialist may possess the know-how but lack  the\r\n\r\ncapital.  The Board will then assist him financially\r\n\r\nby  direct  loans  and advances, or  underwrite  and\r\n\r\nguarantee  the  issue  or  equity  capital  by   the\r\n\r\nenterprise concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, where necessary, the Board will itself\r\n\r\nparticipate   in   establishing  industries,   where\r\n\r\nprivate   participation  is   not   forthcoming   or\r\n\r\ninsufficient.  This  may  happen  when  an  industry\r\n\r\nrequires  substantial investment outlay  and  expert\r\n\r\ntechnical know-how.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to provide prepared sites for industries,\r\n\r\nthe  Board will have the power to lay out industrial\r\n\r\nestates,  where the basic requirements of  industry,\r\n\r\nsuch as power, water, roads, railways and such other\r\n\r\nfacilities will be laid on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Board will assist industrial\r\n\r\nenterprises by giving technical advice. A  technical\r\n\r\nconsultant  service  will be  organised  which  will\r\n\r\nadvise an industrial enterprise with regard to  both\r\n\r\neconomic and purely engineering problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An industrial research unit which will be sited in\r\n\r\nthe  Polytechnic  is in the course of  establishment\r\n\r\nwith  the  assistance of the New Zealand Government.\r\n\r\nThis  unit will be able to give valuable assistance,\r\n\r\nespecially to medium-scale industries, in the way of\r\n\r\nsolving  their production and engineering  problems.\r\n\r\nAt a future date we intend to set up a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproductivity  centre to improve  the  efficiency  of\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  to  raise  the  output  of  workers\r\n\r\nthrough  the  application of modern techniques.  The\r\n\r\nrelation  between the industrial research  unit  and\r\n\r\nthe  future  productivity  centre  of  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board is something which will have to be\r\n\r\nresolved. I do not wish to anticipate what the Board\r\n\r\nitself will want to do. This will have to await  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the Board will have power under clause II\r\n\r\nto  raise its own capital by the issue of bonds  and\r\n\r\ndebentures, a substantial part of the Board's assets\r\n\r\nwill  be  made  available by the Government.  It  is\r\n\r\nexpected  that  over the Plan period 1961-1964,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will contribute from current  revenue  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  $100  million for the  operation  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard.  This  will be done under the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nclause 10 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 16, the Board will have compulsory\r\n\r\npowers  to  acquire land. This is necessary  as  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of industrial estates and sites,  which\r\n\r\nis  one  of the functions of the Board, must proceed\r\n\r\nexpeditiously  to channel industries  into  suitable\r\n\r\nareas  where the economies of scale in the provision\r\n\r\nof basic services can be enjoyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board as constituted under clause 5 includes a\r\n\r\nfull-time  Chairman and a Director, the Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe  Housing  Board, and five members  to  represent\r\n\r\nrespectively  banking,  manufacturing,   commercial,\r\n\r\nlabour  and  professional interests.  Representation\r\n\r\nand  participation in the running of the  Board  has\r\n\r\nbeen  so  distributed that the whole  community  can\r\n\r\nbecome   a   part   of   the  national   effort   to\r\n\r\nindustrialise,  which  task  would  be  the  Board's\r\n\r\nsupreme responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill will repeal the Singapore\r\n\r\nIndustrial Promotion Board Ordinance, 1957, and  the\r\n\r\nassets  of  the  present Industrial Promotion  Board\r\n\r\nwould  be  vested  in  the new Economic  Development\r\n\r\nBoard.  The new Board will have a hundred-fold  more\r\n\r\nresources at its disposal, with which to provide the\r\n\r\nmeans for the take-off into industrialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, a word about the future. The powers of\r\n\r\nthe  Board  as I have described them fall  into  two\r\n\r\nbroad  categories.  First, there is  the  industrial\r\n\r\npromotion  effort  and  the rendering  of  technical\r\n\r\nservices  and assistance to industries.  Then  there\r\n\r\nare  the  financial activities of the Board such  as\r\n\r\nthe  provision  of loans or participation  in  share\r\n\r\ncapital.  It  is  the experience of other  countries\r\n\r\nthat  the latter functions, that is, loan operations\r\n\r\nand  share  participation in industries, are  better\r\n\r\nperformed   by   a   separate   Industrial   Finance\r\n\r\nCorporation. We may well find this to be the case in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But  as  a  first  step,  it  does  seem\r\n\r\nunnecessary  to  establish  two  separate  statutory\r\n\r\nbodies when not much is known as to the details  and\r\n\r\nscope for what they would actually be doing and  how\r\n\r\nmuch  demand  there would be for  the  services  and\r\n\r\nresources that they will provide. This knowledge can\r\n\r\nonly come about through actual experience, and if it\r\n\r\nis  proved necessary in the future to separate these\r\n\r\ntwo   functions  and  allot  them  to  two  separate\r\n\r\nauthorities, then we shall proceed to do so. In  the\r\n\r\ninitial  stages  at  any rate, a certain  degree  of\r\n\r\ncentralisation would appear to be advantageous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Bill, we provided for the formal powers\r\n\r\nand  the  general  modus operandi  of  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board, It is obvious that the setting up\r\n\r\nof  the  framework  itself by no  means  provides  a\r\n\r\nguarantee  of  success. Successful industrialisation\r\n\r\ndepends  on  many  other  factors  - maintenance   of\r\n\r\npolitical stability, industrial peace, and a general\r\n\r\neffort  by everyone to work harder and with  greater\r\n\r\nskill. This means that the success or failure of our\r\n\r\nventure  basically depends on whether every  citizen\r\n\r\nin Singapore is prepared to make his contribution to\r\n\r\nthe national effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  industrialisation, we have  given  our\r\n\r\nviews  at  previous sittings of this  Assembly,  and\r\n\r\nthey are quite well\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknown. But I think it is worth while to repeat  here\r\n\r\nthe most important factors that can contribute to  a\r\n\r\nsuccessful industrialisation policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance himself said nearly two years ago that the success of any industrialisation\r\n\r\nplan  depends on a common market, and this  morning,\r\n\r\nin  reply to a question from the Opposition, it  was\r\n\r\nmade  known for the first time that there  had  been\r\n\r\nonly- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Cairnhill quoted\r\n\r\nme    as   saying   that, the   success   of   our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation depends on a common market. May  I\r\n\r\nask him, Sir, to quote chapter and verse so that  my\r\n\r\nwords  can be judged in their exact context  and  in\r\n\r\naccurate terms?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am not able to quote the exact\r\n\r\nwords,  but it was clear from the Minister's  speech\r\n\r\nat  the  time  when  he proudly  acclaimed  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  that he had thought of the wonderful  plan\r\n\r\nfor a common market which was vital - I think the word\r\n\r\nused could have been \"vital\" - to the success of  any\r\n\r\nindustrialisation plan. And then with  titters  from\r\n\r\nthe  Government Benchers that they, the bright  boys\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P., would then have discussions with the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government. That was  nearly  two  years\r\n\r\nago.  And  only  this morning,  as  a  result  of  a\r\n\r\nquestion asked- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> No. It was only this morning, in\r\n\r\nreply  to  a question from the Opposition,  that  we\r\n\r\nbecame  aware of the fact that after the ministerial\r\n\r\nmeeting   some   two  years  ago  there   had   been\r\n\r\ndiscussions  at official level. Three meetings  took\r\n\r\nplace  between  June and August  1960.  After  that,\r\n\r\nthere have been no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  meetings but a lot of correspondence has  been\r\n\r\nexchanged  on  various points that  require  further\r\n\r\nclarification  or elucidation. But  anyway,  it  was\r\n\r\nadmitted  this morning that after August 1960  there\r\n\r\nhad been no further meetings, official or otherwise.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  Development Plan of  the  Government  was\r\n\r\nbrought  up  for debate at the previous  sitting  of\r\n\r\nthis Assembly, no murmur whatsoever was made of  the\r\n\r\nfate  of  the  discussions on the  Common  Commodity\r\n\r\nMarket. And today, it is significant that in  moving\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  the Minister pointed out the difficulties\r\n\r\nor  the  prerequisites for the success of the  Bill;\r\n\r\nbut   he  forgot  his  great  brainchild - the  Common\r\n\r\nCommodity Market with the Federation of Malaya.  May\r\n\r\nI therefore ask him, in his reply, if he would stand\r\n\r\nup and say that there is no hope of a Common Market?\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the people of Singapore can be resigned  to\r\n\r\nthat  fate instead of being kept in suspense whether\r\n\r\nor not such a Common Market is to come into being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister himself said that there are many things needed to guarantee the success of the Plan.\r\n\r\nThat  was  towards the end of his speech.  First  of\r\n\r\nall,  he  said  there  must be political  stability.\r\n\r\nThere  has  been a lot of political instability,  if\r\n\r\npolitical stability is to be measured in terms of 39\r\n\r\nagainst  12 Members, then they can call it political\r\n\r\nstability. But the way I look at political stability\r\n\r\nis  that it is a Government that knows its mind.  It\r\n\r\nis  a  Government that knows how to look  after  all\r\n\r\ninterests  and not just indulge in class hatred.  It\r\n\r\nis  a Government that has Ministers who do not stand\r\n\r\nup and proudly say, \"If a company or such and such a\r\n\r\nunion  does  not behave, I will see to it  that  all\r\n\r\nimmigration passes will be withdrawn. So look  out!\"\r\n\r\nThat  is  not  political stability.  That  engenders\r\n\r\npolitical instability. Of course, Sir, I do not  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister for Labour and Law was wrong  in\r\n\r\nfeeling so exasperated when he was told of what  had\r\n\r\nhappened by his colleague who was then and who still\r\n\r\nis  the  adviser  to this newly-formed  Oil  Workers\r\n\r\nUnion.  But  if  he really has the interest  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers and the country at heart, there is certainly\r\n\r\nanother more effective way to settle the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblem.  Surely he could send for the employer  and\r\n\r\ngive  him a ticking-off in his office and say, \"Look\r\n\r\nhere,  you  should not do this; you  should  not  do\r\n\r\nthat; you should not do the other,\" instead of doing\r\n\r\nit  P.A.P.-style - \"Either or!\" Industrial peace!

While they are here, they say,  \"We\r\n\r\nrepresent the Government,\" and while they are in the\r\n\r\nA.U.P.E., they say, \"We represent the workers.\"  And\r\n\r\nthe poor man there [Indicating] keeps on telling his\r\n\r\ncolleague,  \"I  want  more  and  more  money  to  be\r\n\r\nreturned  to  the civil servants in respect  of  the\r\n\r\narbitrary pay cut.\" But when he sits here, he  says,\r\n\r\n\"I  am  in  favour of the pay cut.\" I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  it is a good thing for industrial peace.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know, because the P.A.P. have great  brains\r\n\r\nand they know what they are doing!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want a successful industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme  to  be  carried out, it  is  vital - it  is\r\n\r\naccepted by the Government - that the conditions must\r\n\r\nbe  of such a character that there can be no fear of\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the  Government  being   lost.   The\r\n\r\nMinister  has  brought  up the  question  of  market\r\n\r\npotential. He himself has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadmitted  that  Singapore has a  very  small  market\r\n\r\npotential,  but  that because of  the  situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore there are great prospects of selling goods\r\n\r\nmanufactured  in  Singapore  overseas.  Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister  is  not aware that it takes a  very,  very\r\n\r\nlong time to sell a new product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not oppose the Bill, because we feel\r\n\r\nthat something has to be done to help the country to\r\n\r\nsolve the unemployment problem, but we do urge  upon\r\n\r\nthe   Government  to  be  more  realistic  in  their\r\n\r\napproach  to the problem and to see to it  that  all\r\n\r\ninterests must be well and truly balanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.56 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to dwell\r\n\r\non  one  or two points. The first point is something\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Minister himself made in his speech.  He\r\n\r\nsaid  that it is necessary, in the existing economic\r\n\r\ncircumstances which Singapore finds itself, for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to play a positive and direct role in the\r\n\r\neconomic development of Singapore in order  to  stem\r\n\r\nthe  difficult unemployment situation. Sir, he  then\r\n\r\nwent on to develop that by saying how these positive\r\n\r\nand  direct steps will be taken. While he was making\r\n\r\nhis  speech, I was looking at the Bill which he  had\r\n\r\nplaced   before   the  Assembly.   I   was   looking\r\n\r\nparticularly at clause 12 of the Bill which sets out\r\n\r\nseriatim  the powers of the Board. I may  be  wrong,\r\n\r\nSir, I  may be a pettifogging lawyer. But sometimes\r\n\r\nit   is  necessary  that  pettifogging  lawyers   do\r\n\r\npropound  their views, because it is eventually  the\r\n\r\nCourts that decide these things, and the Courts  are\r\n\r\npresided  over by lawyers who might not  necessarily\r\n\r\nbe pettifogging but are yet lawyers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at clause 12. Mr Speaker, Sir, I get the\r\n\r\nimpression  that there is nothing in it which  would\r\n\r\nenable  the  Board to play the positive  and  direct\r\n\r\nrole  in  industry which the Minister has  indicated\r\n\r\nshould  be done if the economy of this place  is  to\r\n\r\nreach  some sort of stability. As far as I can  see,\r\n\r\nall  the  powers are given either to underwrite  the\r\n\r\nissue of stocks and shares of industrial enterprises\r\n\r\nor   to   guarantee  loans  raised   by   industrial\r\n\r\nenterprises, or to grant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nloans  to industrial enterprises, or to sell shares,\r\n\r\nand  manage  and  invest  in  shares  of  industrial\r\n\r\nenterprises, or to acquire land, or:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to act as agent for the Government or, with its\r\n\r\napproval, for any other person in the transaction of\r\n\r\nany  business  with  an  industrial  enterprise   in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  loans or advances granted or debentures\r\n\r\nsubscribed by the Government or such other person;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  that, in effect, the role which the Board  would\r\n\r\nplay  as  envisaged by the Bill, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nseems  to  be  this:  to come  to  the  help  of  an\r\n\r\nindustrial  enterprise  in circumstances  when  that\r\n\r\nindustrial enterprise cannot stand on its  own  feet\r\n\r\nand  needs  or  solicits  the  help  of  Government.\r\n\r\n\"Industrial  enterprise\"  is  expressly  defined  in\r\n\r\nclause 2 which says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`[It] means any sole-proprietorship, partnership,\r\n\r\ncompany   or   co-operative  society  wheresoever\r\n\r\nregistered or incorporated under any law for  the\r\n\r\ntime  being  in force relating to companies, \r\n\r\nco-operative societies or businesses and engaged  in\r\n\r\nmining  or  in  the manufacture or processing  of\r\n\r\ngoods;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  that,  in  effect,  Mr Speaker,  an  industrial\r\n\r\nenterprise  is either a partnership or a  registered\r\n\r\ncompany  or  some  society  which  has  a  statutory\r\n\r\nentity,  which indulges either in mining or  in  the\r\n\r\nmanufacture or processing of goods. Sir,  as  I  see\r\n\r\nthe  Bill,  there  seems to be a  divergence  and  a\r\n\r\ncleavage between what the Minister has said  on  its\r\n\r\nSecond Reading and what in effect will be the  legal\r\n\r\npowers  of  the Board. There are other matters,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, which I will raise in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point which I wish to touch upon,\r\n\r\nparticularly as a matter of principle, is clause  15\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill  which is charting  a  new  course  in\r\n\r\nlegislation.   Mr   Speaker,  I   have   repeatedly\r\n\r\ncomplained  in  this House about  what  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment is doing to our courts of law: that it is\r\n\r\ntaking  away from them matters which normally  under\r\n\r\nany  democratic government should go  to  them,  and\r\n\r\nmatters which having gone to them should be left  in\r\n\r\nan  unfettered  manner for them  to  do  justice  to\r\n\r\naccording to the law of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, imagine my surprise, Mr Speaker, when I\r\n\r\nreceived this Bill. In going through clause  15,  it\r\n\r\nseems to me that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P.   Government,  that  is,  our   present\r\n\r\nGovernment,  has gone one better than  it  has  been\r\n\r\ndoing  up till now. It is seeking to make our courts\r\n\r\nof  justice a rubber stamp. Yes, Mr Speaker, I  use\r\n\r\nthe  words  deliberately - a rubber stamp.  Clause  15\r\n\r\ngoes on to say that if certain applications are made\r\n\r\nto  the  Court, certain orders shall be made by  the\r\n\r\nCourt;  certain interim injunctions shall be  given;\r\n\r\nand  certain orders shall issue from the Judges. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, this is the first time  I  have  seen\r\n\r\nlegislation which places a mandatory obligation on a\r\n\r\nJudge  in  the way of what he shall decide or  shall\r\n\r\nnot  decide. It is all the more heinous because  the\r\n\r\nvery  things that they are going to the  Courts  for\r\n\r\nare  powers  which are already vested in  the  Board\r\n\r\nitself  under  clause 13. In those circumstances,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  see  why clause 15 is necessary whereby  the\r\n\r\nCourts become a rubber stamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this is a matter of principle. Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not an isolated matter which only  affects\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  only. The independence of the Judiciary,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, is one of the  corner-stones  on\r\n\r\nwhich  parliamentary democracy rests. If we  destroy\r\n\r\nthe  confidence  of the public in the independence - I\r\n\r\nrepeat the word again - independence of action and  of\r\n\r\nthought  of  our Judges, then our whole  concept  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy as we  understand  it  must\r\n\r\nsurely fall. If clause 15 is passed into law, and if\r\n\r\nour  Judges  become rubber stamps,  I  submit,  with\r\n\r\nrespect   to  you,  Mr  Speaker.  Sir,   that   the\r\n\r\nadministration  of justice in this country  will  be\r\n\r\nheld  in  contempt, and any justice which becomes  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  contempt will lose the  respect  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Once our Judges become objects of  contempt\r\n\r\nin  the  eyes of the public, then the main essential\r\n\r\non  which  our  democratic concepts  rests  will  be\r\n\r\nundermined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nthink   the   Opposition  have  made  any   valuable\r\n\r\ncontribution to the debate on this Bill.

To allege that an hon.\r\n\r\nMember  of  this  House  has  been  guilty  of  some\r\n\r\nmalicious  act  is unparliamentary.

Speaking  purely from  memory  and  when\r\n\r\nchallenged to quote the actual remarks which  I  had\r\n\r\nmade, the Member for Cairnhill was completely unable\r\n\r\nto  do so. Therefore, I shall dismiss his remarks as\r\n\r\nbeing  purely  a political tactic to  discredit  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  We  had  made  no  such  claims  and  I\r\n\r\nchallenge the Member for Cairnhill, when he gets his\r\n\r\ncopy  of  Hansard and sees his own remarks  in  cold\r\n\r\nprint,  to  compare  his statement  of  what  I  was\r\n\r\nsupposed to have said on the Common Market with what\r\n\r\nI  did actually say about it. And let him come again\r\n\r\nand  defend the propositions that he has made before\r\n\r\nthe Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill made a second point about\r\n\r\nthe   importance  of  political  stability  and  the\r\n\r\nvarious  ways  in  which the P.A.P.  Government  had\r\n\r\nfailed  to  achieve it. This again is  so  obviously\r\n\r\nuntrue  that  it  does  not call  for  any  detailed\r\n\r\ncomment.  All I need say is that we need no  lessons\r\n\r\non  how  to  maintain political stability  from  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. or  the  former Labour  Front  members  who,\r\n\r\nduring  their brief and inglorious term  of  office,\r\n\r\nhad  provided an object lesson on how to bring about\r\n\r\na state of complete political instability and chaos.\r\n\r\nIf we need any lesson from Members of the Opposition\r\n\r\nbench,  it  is  on  how  to  bring  about  political\r\n\r\ninstability  through  sheer  incapacity  to   govern\r\n\r\nSingapore wisely, firmly and justly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point made by the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nis  that  during the tenure of office of the present\r\n\r\nGovernment,  far  from achieving  industrial  peace,\r\n\r\nwhat has happened is that there has been a record of\r\n\r\nstrikes,  and  he  said  that statistics  of  labour\r\n\r\ndisputes   will  bear  this  out.  Sir,   I   am   a\r\n\r\nstatistician  by  profession  and  I  have  made   a\r\n\r\nparticular effort to keep correct the statistics  of\r\n\r\nman-days  lost  as  a  result of  strikes - statistics\r\n\r\nwhich  are  furnished by my colleague, the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour  and  Law. May I remind the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill that when his Government was in power,  we\r\n\r\nthen  achieved  the  all-time record  of  industrial\r\n\r\ndisputes,  that in the year 1956 no  less  than  one\r\n\r\nmillion  man-days of work were lost through strikes?\r\n\r\nThat  was an absolute record which exceeded the most\r\n\r\nriotous  days of the post-war era when  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist Party openly challenged the then  colonial\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I turn to the comments of the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park.  I  am  unable to  follow  the  legal\r\n\r\narguments  that he made, namely, that the provisions\r\n\r\nof   clause  12,  taken  in  conjunction  with  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of clause 2, will not enable the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board to perform the function of  direct\r\n\r\nand  positive participation in industry. Sir, may  I\r\n\r\nrefer him to clause 12  which empowers the Board:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to grant loans or advances to, or subscribe to\r\n\r\nstocks,  shares, bonds or debentures  of  industrial\r\n\r\nenterprises;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  is  continued in paragraph (d), which empowers\r\n\r\nthe Board:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to manage, control or supervise industrial\r\n\r\nenterprises  by nominating directors or advisers  or\r\n\r\notherwise  collaborating with them or entering  into\r\n\r\npartnerships  or any other arrangement  for  jointly\r\n\r\nworking with them;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Clearly,  these two paragraphs empower the Board  to\r\n\r\nparticipate   directly   and   positively   in   the\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  establishment of industry,  whether\r\n\r\nexisting  ones or new ones. But it may be  that  the\r\n\r\npoint that the Member for Farrer Park was making  is\r\n\r\nthat in clause 2 industrial enterprise is so defined\r\n\r\nas  to include only existing enterprises and not new\r\n\r\nones.  I  do not know whether that was the point  he\r\n\r\nwas  making.  With respect, Sir,  if  that  was  the\r\n\r\npoint, then may I just say that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  is  really a legal quibble, because there  are\r\n\r\nmany ways of bringing into existence enterprises  of\r\n\r\none  form  or  another,  so that  once  their  legal\r\n\r\nexistence  is established by the simple  process  of\r\n\r\nadministration  under any law, then the  Board  will\r\n\r\nhave the power to perform the functions which I have\r\n\r\nenumerated. But I do not think the Member for Fairer\r\n\r\nPark  was  making  a substantial  point  there.  His\r\n\r\nprincipal  attack was against clause  15,  which  he\r\n\r\nsaid  reduced the courts to the position of being  a\r\n\r\nrubber stamp, and undermined the independence of the\r\n\r\nJudiciary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 15 is not a clause which was created\r\n\r\nde novo by us. I cannot recollect offhand the actual\r\n\r\nprecedent on which this clause was based. But to the\r\n\r\nbest  of  my  recollection, it  was  either  in  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Finance  Corporation  Ordinance  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of Pakistan or some similar Ordinance  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government of India. I would say. Sir, speaking\r\n\r\npurely as a layman with perhaps some trepidation  in\r\n\r\nthese matters, that the courts would be reduced to a\r\n\r\nrubber  stamp  only if the decision in  any  dispute\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Board and the other party can  legally\r\n\r\nunder  this Ordinance be resolved only in favour  of\r\n\r\nthe  Board,  and there is nothing in  clause  15  to\r\n\r\nprovide for this. All that clause 15 provides for is\r\n\r\nthat certain steps should be taken in regard to  the\r\n\r\nattachment  of  property to ensure that  the  assets\r\n\r\nagainst which loans are made shall be conducted in a\r\n\r\nproper  and orderly way. Further, there is provision\r\n\r\nfor  safeguards  in that the orders which  are  made\r\n\r\nunder  this clause are interim orders and  that  the\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board will have to show  cause.\r\n\r\nI  think these are adequate safeguards, and  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  this provision undermines the independence  of\r\n\r\nthe  Judiciary is really carrying matters  too  far.\r\n\r\nThe  independence of the Judiciary, as I  understand\r\n\r\nit,  means that a Judge, when he makes his  decision\r\n\r\nin  any matter placed before him, should be able  to\r\n\r\ndo   so   without  pressure  or  duress   from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.

Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will run  your  eye\r\n\r\ndown  clause 5. Under clause 5 (1) (b), it says  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of  the  Board shall  be  appointed  under\r\n\r\nsection  7  of this Ordinance, which says  that  the\r\n\r\nfirst  of these Directors shall be appointed by  the\r\n\r\nMinister and that all subsequent Directors shall  be\r\n\r\nappointed  by the Board.

Would it not be  enough\r\n\r\nif  we  had only one person, and we call him  either\r\n\r\nthe Chairman or the Director?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, the answer is\r\n\r\nquite  simple. It is likely that the first  Director\r\n\r\nof  the  Board  will  be  a  person  appointed  from\r\n\r\noverseas. He will be an industrial economist who has\r\n\r\nexperience  in such matters. It would  obviously  be\r\n\r\nundesirable  to  leave the whole management  of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board in the hands of an expert\r\n\r\nwho  is  not a Malayan. This is then, therefore,  in\r\n\r\norder  that  policy  matters  and  local  background\r\n\r\ninformation  can be made continuously  available  to\r\n\r\nthe  Director of the Board. It will be an  advantage\r\n\r\nif the chairman of the Board, who will be a Malayan,\r\n\r\nis  appointed. It does not follow, of  course,  that\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman  of the Board will draw  a  very  high\r\n\r\nsalary.  Perhaps I may remind the Member for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark   that   the  Chairman  of  the   Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board draws no salary, no allowance,  no\r\n\r\ntransport  allowance, and he works more  than \r\n\r\nfull-time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am fully aware that\r\n\r\nthe  present.

But\r\n\r\nif  he  were desirous of getting the money, he could\r\n\r\nhave got it.

And in (1) it\r\n\r\ngoes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`if for any reason it is necessary in the opinion\r\n\r\nof the Board to protect the interests of the Board.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will notice how wide a\r\n\r\nclause  that  is. So that in itself  it  could  have\r\n\r\nread, omitting (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary,\r\n\r\nand  without  prejudice  to  any  other  rights   or\r\n\r\nremedies  which it may possess under  the  law,  the\r\n\r\nBoard   may   by   notice  require  any   industrial\r\n\r\nenterprise,  to  which it has granted  any  loan  or\r\n\r\nadvance,   forthwith  to  discharge  in   full   its\r\n\r\nliabilities  to the Board if for any  reason  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary in the opinion of the Board to protect the\r\n\r\ninterests of the Board.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that is a very wide clause. If that is the\r\n\r\nlaw,  let us take these circumstances. There  is  an\r\n\r\nindustrial enterprise which has been started and  is\r\n\r\ndoing  well.  Some bank has advanced it monies.  Say\r\n\r\nthe bank has advanced it $50 million or $10 million,\r\n\r\nand  then  that enterprise needs further money.  The\r\n\r\nbank declines to lend further money. This industrial\r\n\r\nenterprise employs, say, a thousand persons.  It  is\r\n\r\nin  the  national  interests  that  this  enterprise\r\n\r\nshould  be  kept  alive  as a  going  concern.  This\r\n\r\nenterprise  goes to the Government,  puts  its  case\r\n\r\nbefore  them,  and  in the circumstances  Government\r\n\r\nmight  feel  that this is one of those  cases  where\r\n\r\nGovernment should help and then Government  advances\r\n\r\n$10  million  to  this  enterprise.  The  bank,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  do not forget, has already  advanced\r\n\r\n$10  million or $50 million as the case may be.  And\r\n\r\nthen  after  the Government have advanced  this  $10\r\n\r\nmillion, they decide to call in the loan and say  to\r\n\r\nthis  enterprise, \"Will you discharge in  full  your\r\n\r\nliabilities to the Board?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the question I ask the Minister is this - is\r\n\r\nthe Board going to be a preferred creditor or is  it\r\n\r\ngoing  to rank in pari passu with the bank?  Now,  if\r\n\r\nthe  intention of the Bill is to make  the  Board  a\r\n\r\npreferred  creditor, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  then  I  am\r\n\r\nsubmitting to the Minister that a bank would be very\r\n\r\nloath  to lend monies to any business enterprise  of\r\n\r\nthe   nature   envisaged  by   the   definition   of\r\n\r\n\"industrial enterprise\" because any subsequent loans\r\n\r\nmade by the Board would become a preferred debt  and\r\n\r\nthe   bank  might  be  defeated  by  virtue  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of clause 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think clause 14 does bring\r\n\r\nabout  a  state whereby the Board would become,  in\r\n\r\neffect, a preferred creditor if the Board so desires\r\n\r\nto exercise its powers under this clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are various reasons why this is\r\n\r\nnecessary.  It  is  obvious  that  the  dictates  of\r\n\r\nfinancial prudence would determine that the  Board\r\n\r\nshould be given certain protective powers. I am  not\r\n\r\nso much interested in the hypothetical arguments put\r\n\r\nforward by the Member for Farrer Park. What is  more\r\n\r\nto  the  point is this. In the present situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  insofar  as the supply  of  bank  credit\r\n\r\nloans  to industry goes, the facilities are  limited\r\n\r\nand  the terms are not as attractive as would be the\r\n\r\ncase  with trading concerns. Speaking entirely  from\r\n\r\nmemory,  I  would  say that the proportion  of  bank\r\n\r\ncredit loans going to industry is extremely  small,\r\n\r\nprobably  of the magnitude of five per cent,  and  I\r\n\r\nsuspect  most of these to be more in the  nature  of\r\n\r\nshort-term  loans against goods or raw materials  in\r\n\r\nstore or finished goods in godowns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial financing hardly exists as a practice\r\n\r\nin  bank finance in Singapore today. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nsituation  which  the  Member for  Farrer  Park  has\r\n\r\ndescribed  would not, in fact, be a serious  problem\r\n\r\nat all. It would be a completely different matter if\r\n\r\nwe  had,  say, private industrial banks engaging  in\r\n\r\nloans  on a substantial scale. If the Board were  to\r\n\r\nact  in  an  unreasonable manner independently,  and\r\n\r\neven  in opposition to private banks, then the \r\n\r\nill-effects which the Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFarrer Park has described may come into being. As it\r\n\r\nis,  what  we  are  doing really  is  to  discuss  a\r\n\r\ncompletely hypothetical proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I am glad the Minister has\r\n\r\ndispelled  that and if he has balanced  the  problem\r\n\r\nand  thinks that that should be the position, I have\r\n\r\nnothing  further  to  say. But I  put  this  further\r\n\r\nproposition to the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposing an industrial enterprise were indebted\r\n\r\nto  its  trading creditors to the extent of $600,000\r\n\r\nor  $1 million. While it is so indebted, it goes  to\r\n\r\nthe  Board  and  gets a loan of  $1  million  or  $2\r\n\r\nmillion,  and  subsequently the Board  recalls  that\r\n\r\nloan.  Is  it the intention of Government  that  the\r\n\r\nBoard's  loan  should over-reach the  other  trading\r\n\r\nliabilities  and  defeat them, and  that  the  Board\r\n\r\nshould  get preferential treatment rather  than  the\r\n\r\nlegitimate trading creditors who had lent  money  or\r\n\r\nsupplied goods prior to the Board giving the loan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I should say it is a matter of\r\n\r\npolicy. These reserved powers of the Board should be\r\n\r\nused  with great circumspection. So far as possible,\r\n\r\nwhere legitimate trading and financial interests are\r\n\r\ninvolved, the Board should, as I have said, be  most\r\n\r\ncircumspect in the use of these reserved powers.  If\r\n\r\nthe    Board   were   to   exercise   these   powers\r\n\r\nindiscriminately, then I should say that the  effect\r\n\r\nwould   be   harmful  not  only  on  the  enterprise\r\n\r\nimmediately  concerned,  but  it  may  have  adverse\r\n\r\nconsequences on other debtors to the Board. I  think\r\n\r\nthese  are  matters which can be left  to  the  good\r\n\r\njudgment of the Board itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I wonder if matters like this\r\n\r\nshould  be  left to the good judgment of the  Board.\r\n\r\n[Interruption] The Minister might think I am wasting\r\n\r\nhis  time, but I think there is point in what  I  am\r\n\r\nsaying.  Many people would not say I am wasting  his\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many problems which arise over\r\n\r\nthis.   If   these   enterprises  should   go   into\r\n\r\nliquidation or bankruptcy, then who is the preferred\r\n\r\ncreditor?  It  is  not good enough  merely  for  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to assure this House that the  Board  will\r\n\r\nuse its discretion, because the people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  trade with these enterprises will want to know.\r\n\r\nIf  the  laws  are not equitable, then  people  will\r\n\r\nrefuse  to trade with these enterprises and, instead\r\n\r\nof  helping industrial expansion in the country, the\r\n\r\nnet  result of this legislation might well  be  that\r\n\r\nthese  people  will think twice about  trading  with\r\n\r\nthese enterprises when they know that the Board,  on\r\n\r\ngiving   these   enterprises  money,   will   become\r\n\r\npreferred creditors and defeat them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are being\r\n\r\ndriven into this detailed argument, as I have  said,\r\n\r\nover a completely hypothetical proposition. I do not\r\n\r\nsee  why the Member for Farrer Park should deny  the\r\n\r\nGovernment the right to say that the Board  will  be\r\n\r\nmanned  by  people capable of making sound  business\r\n\r\npolicy  decisions and that they will exercise  these\r\n\r\nreserved  powers  which are necessary  where  public\r\n\r\nmoney  is involved. I have gone as far as to concede\r\n\r\nthat   if   these  powers  were  to   be   exercised\r\n\r\nindiscriminately, then the objectives of  the  Board\r\n\r\nwould  be  defeated. I think the Member  for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark should be satisfied with the recognition I have\r\n\r\ngiven to the point he is trying to make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That clause 15 stand part of the Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have made\r\n\r\nmy  point  on  the Second Reading of the  Bill  that\r\n\r\nclause 15 merely gives powers to the Board to go  to\r\n\r\nthe  Court  where  they themselves could  act  under\r\n\r\nclause 13, except possibly under clause 15 (1)  (c);\r\n\r\nbut  insofar  as  clause 15  (1)  (a)  and  (b)  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  the Board already have the powers  under\r\n\r\nclause  13. There are various places here where  the\r\n\r\nJudges  are called upon to make interim orders,  and\r\n\r\nthere are places where the Judges are called upon to\r\n\r\nmake  certain orders and they are not left with  any\r\n\r\ndiscretion.  For instance, under sub-clause  (7)  of\r\n\r\nclause 15:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If no cause is shown on or before the date\r\n\r\nspecified  in the notice under subsections  (4)  and\r\n\r\n(6)  of this section, the judge shall forthwith make\r\n\r\nthe  interim order absolute and direct the  sale  of\r\n\r\nthe attached property or transfer the management  of\r\n\r\nthe  industrial enterprise to the Board  or  confirm\r\n\r\nthe injunction.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Under  this sub-clause, Sir, the Judge can  only  do\r\n\r\nthis  specified  thing. He cannot do  anything  more\r\n\r\nthan  that.  But what the framers of this sub-clause\r\n\r\nhave  failed  to appreciate is that  they  have  not\r\n\r\ngiven  the power to the Judge to cancel the  interim\r\n\r\norder.  Without  the  cancellation  of  the  interim\r\n\r\norder,  none  of these orders can take  place.  They\r\n\r\nhave  gone  on  to  tie the hands of  the  Judge  by\r\n\r\nsaying, \"You shall do this and that,\" but they  have\r\n\r\nnot allowed him to cancel the interim order. Without\r\n\r\nthe  cancellation of the interim order, I do not see\r\n\r\nhow  sub-clause (7) can work at all. But that is for\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Labour and Law to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my friend the Member\r\n\r\nfor Farrer Park is well aware of the construction of\r\n\r\nthis particular clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause deals with cases of default where an\r\n\r\nenterprise  reaches  agreement with  the  Board.  In\r\n\r\nthose  circumstances,  there  is  provision  for  an\r\n\r\napplication to be made by an accredited  officer  of\r\n\r\nthe  Board to the High Court for the reliefs set out\r\n\r\nin  paragraphs (a), (b) and (C). These  reliefs  are\r\n\r\ndesigned to protect the interests of the Board,  and\r\n\r\nI cannot see anywhere in the procedures that are set\r\n\r\nout  in clause 15 that the Judges of the High  Court\r\n\r\nare  treated  as  rubber-stamps, as claimed  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Farrer Park. Let us  look  at  it,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir. Take the case of an application  made\r\n\r\nfor the transfer of the management of the industrial\r\n\r\nenterprise  to the Board on default. If  the  House\r\n\r\nwill  look  at  sub-clause (4)  of  clause  15,  the\r\n\r\nprocedures are set out there.

In particular, the provisions\r\n\r\nrelating   to   divorce   follow   closely   similar\r\n\r\nprovisions  in the English Divorce law  and  may  be\r\n\r\nsaid,  as  a representor before the Select Committee\r\n\r\nmaintained, to be framed on the basis of  Protestant\r\n\r\ntheology.  It  was felt, however, that  to  allow  a\r\n\r\nmarriage to be dissolved by mutual consent or  under\r\n\r\nthe Chinese custom by a unilateral public act by the\r\n\r\nhusband  would defeat the basis on which the Women's\r\n\r\nCharter was framed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks, on the one hand, to make it as\r\n\r\neasy  as  possible  to enter into  the  contract  of\r\n\r\nmarriage  and,  on the other hand,  to  make  it  as\r\n\r\ndifficult as possible to contract out of it.  It  is\r\n\r\nespecially necessary, in a situation where  existing\r\n\r\npolygamous  marriages  are  recognised   and   where\r\n\r\nmonogamy is to be enforced for the future, that  the\r\n\r\ninstitution  of marriage should be safe-guarded  and\r\n\r\nthat  too  easy  divorces should be  prevented.  For\r\n\r\notherwise,  it  would  be easy for  an  unscrupulous\r\n\r\nhusband  to divorce his existing wife or  wives  and\r\n\r\ntake  for himself another wife. Thus the very  basis\r\n\r\nof  the legislation would be demolished and, instead\r\n\r\nof  raising  the status of women, the Charter  would\r\n\r\nfurther  lower it. It may be that when the women  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are more advanced and more aware  of  and\r\n\r\nmore  in  a  position to exercise their  rights,  it\r\n\r\nwould be possible to go further in liberalising  the\r\n\r\nlaw  of divorce - but for the present it is felt  that\r\n\r\nit  would  be  better to work on the  existing  law,\r\n\r\nwhich has been in force in Singapore since 1912, and\r\n\r\nwhich has been found on balance not to have operated\r\n\r\nunsatisfactorily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One significant change which has been introduced\r\n\r\nis  the  power  given  to the  Court  to  refer  the\r\n\r\ndifferences  between the parties to  a  marriage  to\r\n\r\nConciliation   Officers  so  that  a  reconciliation\r\n\r\nbetween  the  parties can be affected.  It  is  also\r\n\r\nprovided  that  where there are differences  between\r\n\r\nthe  parties to a marriage the parties or either  of\r\n\r\nthem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay  refer the differences to a Conciliation Officer\r\n\r\nfor  his advice and assistance. It is hoped that  in\r\n\r\nthis way the parties will be assisted to arrive at a\r\n\r\nreconcilation, and that every effort will be made to\r\n\r\nresolve their differences before the parties  resort\r\n\r\nto the Court for dissolution of their marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions in the Charter relating to the\r\n\r\ndisability  to  contract polygamous  marriages  will\r\n\r\nhave effect from the 2nd March this year, and it  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  necessary  to bring the  Women's  Charter\r\n\r\ninto  operation  as  soon as possible.  It  will  be\r\n\r\nnecessary,  before this is done,  to  prescribe  the\r\n\r\nform to be used under the Charter and to appoint the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Registrars  of Marriage  who  will  have  to\r\n\r\nassist  in the registration of marriages.

I\r\n\r\nshall deal with them one at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volume of Government imports is quite\r\n\r\nconsiderable  and  under  the  existing   Rule   14,\r\n\r\nalthough   the  State  Government  Departments   are\r\n\r\nexempted  by  the Rule from declaring their  imports\r\n\r\nand  exports,  in  practice  they  are  required  by\r\n\r\nadministrative  instruction to make declarations  to\r\n\r\nenable  the  Statistics  Department  to  obtain  the\r\n\r\ndesired coverage of merchandise now included in  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  publications of the Malayan  and  Singapore\r\n\r\nExternal Trade Statistics. Hence, for the purpose of\r\n\r\nregularity,  Rule  4  (1) is  amended  by  inserting\r\n\r\nproviso  (a)  which will give legal  effect  to  the\r\n\r\nAdministrative  instruction. Consequently,  Rule  14\r\n\r\nalso  requires  amendment with which  I  shall  deal\r\n\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 7 prescribes a time limit of four days for\r\n\r\nthe submission of outward manifests to the Registrar\r\n\r\nof  Imports and Exports. The shipping community  has\r\n\r\nlodged a request that more time be allowed to enable\r\n\r\nthem to meet the amount of clerical work involved in\r\n\r\nthe preparation of the manifests. As a compromise to\r\n\r\nthe  request for a new time limit of 10 days, it  is\r\n\r\nproposed  to extend the current period of four  days\r\n\r\nto  seven days which is considered adequate. Rule  7\r\n\r\nis amended to this effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three amendments to Rule 14 relating to\r\n\r\nexemptions  of declaration for imports  and  exports\r\n\r\nwill:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) regularise the practice whereby trade\r\n\r\nsamples, gifts up to $100 in value and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprinted  shipping  and airline  documents  are\r\n\r\ncurrently  exempted  from the  requirement  of\r\n\r\nrendering   import  and  export  declarations.\r\n\r\nThis  practice, which is considered reasonable\r\n\r\nand  has,  in  effect, been in  existence  for\r\n\r\nsome  considerable time, is without any  legal\r\n\r\nbasis  and  it  is desired to  regularise  the\r\n\r\nposition;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) closely define personal and household\r\n\r\neffects  of passengers or crews in  order  to\r\n\r\nassist  in  proper checks and to clarify  the\r\n\r\nlimitations   on  \"passengers'  baggage   and\r\n\r\npersonal effects\"; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) no longer exempt the Governments of the\r\n\r\nState  of Singapore and of the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  from the provisions of the Rules.

Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, on the motion for the\r\n\r\nAdjournment,  I  have four or five  points  which  I\r\n\r\nwould like to raise and submit to the Government for\r\n\r\nconsideration. If my submissions are reasonable,  it\r\n\r\nis  proper that the Government should see to them in\r\n\r\nthe interest of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the first point concerns the certificate of competency in respect of ships under\r\n\r\n75  or  100  tons.  As far as I know,  although  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has considered that such certificates are\r\n\r\nequivalent  to certificates of local trade  masters,\r\n\r\nhowever,  the holders of such certificate are  faced\r\n\r\nwith  many difficulties. For instance, in the matter\r\n\r\nof  getting employment, employers give preference to\r\n\r\nlocal trade masters without the stipulation of 75 or\r\n\r\n100 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this, Mr Deputy Speaker. If\r\n\r\nGovernment can give consideration to the first point\r\n\r\nI  have  raised, I appeal to them to  implement  the\r\n\r\nsecond point, which is the setting up of a Board for\r\n\r\nthe purpose of obtaining employment in rotation just\r\n\r\nas  they  have done in the case of seamen.  But  for\r\n\r\nlocal  ships officers, such a Board is non-existent.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  system  of  rotation  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nemployment.  Mr  Deputy Speaker, today  this  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  which is degrading the status of  the  local\r\n\r\nships  officers,  because if an employer  wishes  to\r\n\r\nemploy  an  officer on board a ship, it is  normally\r\n\r\ndone  through the trade unions. Here it  seems,  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker  - I  am not accusing  certain  trade\r\n\r\nunions - those trade unions with such powers have made\r\n\r\nuse  of  their  trade  unions as  a  private  labour\r\n\r\nexchange  to look for employees for their  employers\r\n\r\nto  work  on board ship. Is it really good  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to set up a Board so that all local ships\r\n\r\nofficers will have an opportunity to find employment\r\n\r\nwithout   discrimination,  if  an   employer   seeks\r\n\r\nemployees,  and  not  just have  it  confined  to  a\r\n\r\ncertain  trade union only? In addition,  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, if a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlocal  trade master is required on a salary of  $400\r\n\r\nor  $500 a month, there will be bargaining about the\r\n\r\npay,  resulting in its being reduced to  $250.  This\r\n\r\nwill be a loss to the certificate holders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point, Mr Deputy Speaker, is this.\r\n\r\nSince  the  Government has agreed to approve  people\r\n\r\nwith local trade masters certificates to sail as far\r\n\r\nas  Tawau,  then I hope the Government  will  permit\r\n\r\nthese certificate holders to have an opportunity  to\r\n\r\nnavigate  ships  as far as Bangkok and  Djakarta  in\r\n\r\norder  to reduce employment because Tawau is farther\r\n\r\nthan  Bangkok  or  Djakarta. I hope  this  too  will\r\n\r\nreceive the serious consideration of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Deputy Speaker, is this appeal\r\n\r\nwhich  is  submitted to the Government in connection\r\n\r\nwith  the  local Press announcement that pilots  are\r\n\r\nrequired to work in the Singapore Harbour Board.  In\r\n\r\nmy   opinion,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  I   wish   the\r\n\r\nGovernment could act so that opportunity is open  to\r\n\r\nlocal  citizens who hold trade masters  certificates\r\n\r\nto become trainee pilots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, whether it is being\r\n\r\npractised  or  not,  I appeal to the  Government  to\r\n\r\ntrain  seamen in all nautical matters and that  they\r\n\r\nbe taught in the national language. It is not that I\r\n\r\ndo  not  agree that lessons be given in the  English\r\n\r\nlanguage; this is good for youths who wish to become\r\n\r\nleaders in the maritime field, but it is to give  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to our local boys who are not  so \r\n\r\nwell-versed in the English language. So if classes  could\r\n\r\nbe  conducted in the national language,  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nmany of the local ships officers could enhance their\r\n\r\nstatus  as  local trade masters, not merely  in  the\r\n\r\nhome trade but also in the foreign trade as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I will\r\n\r\nanswer  point  by point the matters  raised  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Kampong Kembangan. With regard  to  the\r\n\r\nfirst  point, I am surprised to hear that after  the\r\n\r\namendment  to  the Merchant Shipping Ordinance  last\r\n\r\nyear, local trade masters have found it difficult to\r\n\r\nget employment to handle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nships  of up to 1,000 tons. Section 20 (2)  (ii)  of\r\n\r\nthe amended Merchant Shipping Ordinance reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`unless the Minister in any particular case\r\n\r\notherwise  directs, a certificate as a master  of  a\r\n\r\nlocal-trade  ship of under one hundred  tons  or  of\r\n\r\nunder  seventy-five tons shall be  deemed  to  be  a\r\n\r\ncertificate as master of a local-trade ship,  and  a\r\n\r\ncertificate  as  a gunner shall be deemed  to  be  a\r\n\r\ncertificate as a mate of a local-trade ship:'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, under that revised Ordinance those who\r\n\r\npreviously were eligible to handle ships of only 100\r\n\r\ntons or 75 tons would automatically be permitted  to\r\n\r\nhandle  ships of up to 1,000 tons. I have been  told\r\n\r\nby the law officers that it is not possible to issue\r\n\r\na  new certificate to those local trade masters  who\r\n\r\nhad sat for examinations held previously. However, I\r\n\r\nam  looking  into  the matter and if  there  is  any\r\n\r\nattempt  at discrimination, I will try to solve  the\r\n\r\nproblem  by having the old certificates endorsed  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  be  considered  as  good  as   the\r\n\r\ncertificates which are now issued to those who  have\r\n\r\npassed  their  local trade masters examinations  and\r\n\r\nwhich  enable the holders to handle ships of  up  to\r\n\r\n1,000 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nKampong    Kembangan,   that   shipping   companies,\r\n\r\nespecially   local   shipping   companies,   recruit\r\n\r\nofficers  through the unions and that, in doing  so,\r\n\r\nthe  blue-eyed boys of certain unionists  are  given\r\n\r\npreference  before  others,  that  matter   can   be\r\n\r\nresolved easily enough. I will make arrangements for\r\n\r\na  register for shipping officers to be prepared  at\r\n\r\nthe  Shipping Office so that employers who  wish  to\r\n\r\nemploy  local  trade masters can go to the  Shipping\r\n\r\nOffice,  look up the register and pick any man  they\r\n\r\nwish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add that the seamen, at the\r\n\r\nmoment, have a register of their own; also,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  shipping companies  are  now  permitted\r\n\r\nunder  arrangements with the trade  unions  to  keep\r\n\r\ntheir  own  register.  However,  the  Ordinance  and\r\n\r\nregulations  concerning the Seamen's Registry  Board\r\n\r\ncannot be applied strictly to ship officers as  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance concerning seamen applies only to seamen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third point raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nKampong Kembangan, that Bangkok and Djakarta  should\r\n\r\nbe  included in the local trade limits, I  will  say\r\n\r\nthis.  I  have been trying very hard to  extend  the\r\n\r\nlimits   of  the  local  trade.  Last  year,   after\r\n\r\nnegotiations with the Governments of the Federation,\r\n\r\nBrunei, Borneo and Sarawak, we managed to extend the\r\n\r\nlimits of the local trade to as far as Tawau. It was\r\n\r\npointed out during those discussions that the  local\r\n\r\ntrade  master  navigates his ship by sighting  land,\r\n\r\nand  to include Bangkok or Djakarta within the local\r\n\r\ntrade   limits  would  mean  that  we   are   giving\r\n\r\nresponsibility to captains who are not qualified  to\r\n\r\nnavigate to those ports. It must be understood  also\r\n\r\nthat the Singapore Government alone by itself cannot\r\n\r\njust  alter local trade limits or home trade  limits\r\n\r\nas  it  pleases. After all, most of our  seamen  and\r\n\r\nshipping  officers are employed on ships  which  are\r\n\r\nnot  registered  in  Singapore. At  the  same  time,\r\n\r\nwhatever  rules  and regulations we pass  and  which\r\n\r\nwill  involve other governments must also  have  the\r\n\r\nconsent of these governments. We can, tonight,  just\r\n\r\nby  a  scratch of the pen say you can take this ship\r\n\r\nto such and such a place. But if you do not seek the\r\n\r\nconsent  of the government of the country  to  which\r\n\r\nthe ship is sailing, what will ultimately happen  is\r\n\r\nthat  the ship will not be given clearance when  she\r\n\r\narrives  at that port. Therefore, it is not such  an\r\n\r\neasy  matter  for  us just to say,  \"Right.  Let  us\r\n\r\ninclude  such  and such a place within  local  trade\r\n\r\nlimits.\" It can be done. But it will be ineffective.\r\n\r\nThe only way we can do so is to seek the concurrence\r\n\r\nof other governments, and that takes time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already made two major amendments in the\r\n\r\nMerchant  Shipping Ordinance concerning local  trade\r\n\r\nmasters.  One is to raise the tonnage of  the  ships\r\n\r\nfrom  75 tons and 100 tons to 1,000 tons. The second\r\n\r\nis  that we have extended the local trade limits  to\r\n\r\nas  far  as  Tawau.  I consider these  are  two  big\r\n\r\nachievements;  and these amendments were  made  only\r\n\r\nlast  year.  I  would  ask local  trade  masters  to\r\n\r\nimprove their training so that eventually they  will\r\n\r\nbe able to sit for the home trade certificate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth point, concerning the appointment of\r\n\r\npilots  to the Singapore Harbour Board, I would  add\r\n\r\nthat  when the P.A.P. Government came in, we  found,\r\n\r\nto  our  consternation, that there were  pilots  who\r\n\r\nwere earning as much as $100,000 a year. One of  the\r\n\r\nfirst  things my Ministry did was to initiate  steps\r\n\r\nto malayanise the pilotage for this port and, at the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  to  bring the scales of emoluments  for\r\n\r\npilots to some rational scale that is parallel  with\r\n\r\nthose  of  other  officers who  hold  equal  if  not\r\n\r\ngreater responsibilities in this country. Steps have\r\n\r\nbeen taken to bring pilotage under the aegis of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Harbour Board and, ultimately,  the  Port\r\n\r\nAuthority.  It is definitely Government's  intention\r\n\r\nthat  as many local trade masters as possible should\r\n\r\nbe  trained to pilot ships, and it is my hope indeed\r\n\r\nthat  as  many  of them as possible will  apply  for\r\n\r\nposts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fifth point, I would say that the training\r\n\r\nof  local trade masters is already conducted in  the\r\n\r\nMalay  language. It is being done in the Polytechnic\r\n\r\nout  of  funds paid from the Seamen's Welfare  Fund.\r\n\r\nExaminations  for  the Local Trade  Certificate  are\r\n\r\nconducted  in Malay. So on that point, I  think  the\r\n\r\nMember for Kampong Kembangan has really nothing  new\r\n\r\nto raise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would only like to add this. Those who aspire to\r\n\r\nwork  on board ship should extend their horizons  to\r\n\r\nfurther  places. Our youths should  be  prepared  to\r\n\r\nwork hard so that ultimately they will be fitted not\r\n\r\nonly  to man locally-registered ships for the  local\r\n\r\ntrading  ports,  but  also to qualify  for  work  on\r\n\r\nforeign-going  ships.  Towards  this  objective,  we\r\n\r\nhave,   with   the  co-operation  of  the   shipping\r\n\r\ncompanies,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstarted to strengthen the Nautical Department at the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic. Cadets have been taken in and when they\r\n\r\ncomplete  one  year's preliminary  training  at  the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic,  all of them will be  placed  on  board\r\n\r\nship  where  they  will  gain practical  experience,\r\n\r\nduring  which time a correspondence course  will  be\r\n\r\nconducted  so  that they will be able  to  correlate\r\n\r\ntheir    practical   experience   with   theoretical\r\n\r\ntraining.  Ultimately  they  will  return   to   the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  for  a refresher course  before  taking\r\n\r\ntheir  foreign-going mate's examinations or \r\n\r\nforeign-going master's examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the House that the Government is\r\n\r\ndoing  its  very  best  to improve  and  extend  the\r\n\r\nopportunities  of employment for local  citizens  on\r\n\r\nboard  ship  at all levels - not only at  the  officer\r\n\r\nlevel but also at the seamen level. As Singapore  is\r\n\r\nthe  fifth  largest  seaport in  the  world,  it  is\r\n\r\ncorrect  that  as many as possible of  our  citizens\r\n\r\nshould take to the sea. All the steps we have  taken\r\n\r\nso far have been directed towards this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may add that a new course in marine engineering\r\n\r\nwill  be  started at the Polytechnic for the  1961-2\r\n\r\nsession. This course will ultimately train our local\r\n\r\nboys to become marine engineers who will be able  to\r\n\r\nwork  on board ship, or if they wish to do so,  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  able  to find employment as  engineers  in\r\n\r\nfactories   with  their  practical  experience   and\r\n\r\ntheoretical training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">8.50 p.m. to Wednesday,14th June, 1961.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wednesday, 24th May, 1961\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>Southern Islands</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Temporary Occupation Licences)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib</b> asked the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister  (a)  how  many  applications   for\r\n\r\nTemporary   Occupation  Licences  at  the   Southern\r\n\r\nIslands  have been received from 1st June, 1959,  to\r\n\r\n30th  April, 1961;
