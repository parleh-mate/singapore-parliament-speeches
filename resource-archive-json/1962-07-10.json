I  also  expressed\r\n\r\ncertain  views  on  the  two panels  of  members,  on\r\n\r\nrepresentation before the Court, on the  notification\r\n\r\nof trade disputes, the registration and certification\r\n\r\nof agreements, representation in negotiations and, at\r\n\r\na later stage, on the review of cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 36:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Correspondence and discussions on these matters\r\n\r\ncontinued  between  the  Court  and  the  appropriate\r\n\r\nauthority  throughout the year, and  I  am  satisfied\r\n\r\nthat our discussions were most fruitful.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 37:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister for Law, with your concurrence, early\r\n\r\nin  1962,  is to suggest to the Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\ncertain amendments to the Ordinance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 38:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am aware of the nature of the amendments. They\r\n\r\ncover   nearly   all  points  on   which   I   sought\r\n\r\nclarification during the year.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill has been drafted on the\r\n\r\nrepresentations of the President and has been  agreed\r\n\r\nto  with  him.  The main purpose of the  Bill  is  to\r\n\r\nenable   the   setting  up  of  a  second  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Court to deal with the increasing work of\r\n\r\nthe  Court.  This has been considered necessary,  not\r\n\r\nonly   because  of  the  disputes,  which  have  been\r\n\r\nreferred  to  the  Court  for arbitration,  but  also\r\n\r\nbecause  of the large number of collective agreements\r\n\r\npresented for certification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends the definition of\r\n\r\n\"Court\"  and the definition of \"President\" to provide\r\n\r\nfor  the  setting up of more than one Court  and  the\r\n\r\nappointment of a Deputy President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the appointment of\r\n\r\na Deputy President. Clause 4 of the Bill provides for\r\n\r\nthe remuneration and allowances payable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   him  and  gives  him  the  same  protection  and\r\n\r\nimmunities  in  the performance of his functions  and\r\n\r\nduties as the President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill provides that for the purpose\r\n\r\nof constituting the employee panel for the Court, the\r\n\r\nMinister may invite nominations from trade unions  of\r\n\r\nemployees  instead of from the Singapore Trade  Union\r\n\r\nCongress, which has ceased to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Court will be required to take\r\n\r\nthe oath of allegiance and the judicial oath. This is\r\n\r\nprovided in clause 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill will enable the Minister to\r\n\r\nintervene and direct a compulsory conference  in  all\r\n\r\ncases  of  trade disputes. The power of certification\r\n\r\nof  collective agreements is proposed to be given  to\r\n\r\nthe  Court.  But  for this purpose the  Court  is  to\r\n\r\nconsist of the President. Clauses 8 to 14 of the Bill\r\n\r\nprovide for this. The purpose of this is to emphasise\r\n\r\nthat   the  act  of  certification  is  the  act   of\r\n\r\nthe Court and to equate the status of a collective agreement to that of an\r\n\r\naward. It will also enable proceedings to be taken to punish persons who are\r\n\r\nguilty of offences against the Court or contempt against the Court as provided\r\n\r\nin sections 65 and 66 of the Industrial Relations Ordinance. The Court is given\r\n\r\npower to refuse to certify a collective agreement if it is of opinion that the\r\n\r\nmemorandum of agreement does not set out satisfactorily or adequately the terms \r\n\r\nof the collective agreement between the parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill further provides that it will be an offence for the person or a trade\r\n\r\nunion to fail or neglect to bring a collective agreement or any of the terms of \r\n\r\nsuch agreement to the notice of the Court in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the provisions of the Ordinance,  or\r\n\r\nto  deliver to the Registrar a memorandum which  does\r\n\r\nnot   contain   all  the  terms  of  the   collective\r\n\r\nagreement. It is also made an offence for a person or\r\n\r\na  trade  union to enter into a collective agreement,\r\n\r\nwhich is specified to continue in force for less than\r\n\r\neighteen months, or more than three years, and  which\r\n\r\ncannot  be  registered under the  provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of these amendments is to provide that\r\n\r\nall  collective  agreements  shall  comply  with  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Ordinance and shall be  registered\r\n\r\nunder the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 of the Bill makes it an offence for a\r\n\r\nperson  or trade union to enter into negotiations  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  industrial matters  otherwise  than  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the provisions of the Ordinance.  The\r\n\r\npurpose  of  this is to ensure that all  negotiations\r\n\r\nrelating  to  industrial  matters  are  conducted  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the provisions of the Ordinance.  The\r\n\r\ndefinition  of \"industrial matters\" has been  amended\r\n\r\nso  as  to exclude individual agreements or contracts\r\n\r\nof  service between employer and employee relating to\r\n\r\nthe   employment  or  terms  of  employment  of  such\r\n\r\nemployee. This is provided for in clause 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prohibition against representations and\r\n\r\nnegotiations is extended to all trade disputes.  This\r\n\r\nis provided for in clause 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 of the Bill provides that referees may be\r\n\r\nappointed only from persons included in the  list  of\r\n\r\nnames  maintained by the Minister. It  also  provides\r\n\r\nfor an appeal from the decision of the referee to the\r\n\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 provides that no award or decision or\r\n\r\norder  of  the  Court or the President or  a  referee\r\n\r\nshall  be challenged or be subject to review  by  any\r\n\r\ncourt.  The present position under which the decision\r\n\r\nof  referees  may  be challenged in court,  with  the\r\n\r\nresult  that  costs  might  be  awarded  against  the\r\n\r\nreferees,  has created difficulties as  referees  who\r\n\r\nhave been nominated have refused to serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has been referred to the Bar Committee, but\r\n\r\nI  regret  to say that there are certain  matters  on\r\n\r\nwhich    there    appears   to   be   a   fundamental\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding of the functions of the court,  with\r\n\r\nthe  result that certain provisions of the Bill  have\r\n\r\nnot  been approved by the Bar Committee. The  purpose\r\n\r\nof  the Industrial Arbitration Court is not to decide\r\n\r\ndisputed questions of law, but to register collective\r\n\r\nagreements which are made between the parties  or  to\r\n\r\nmake agreements for employers and employees when they\r\n\r\ncannot  reach  agreement on  their  own  account.  It\r\n\r\ncannot therefore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  treated like an ordinary court of justice and  it\r\n\r\nis  in  recognition of this fact that  the  Ordinance\r\n\r\nprovides that the Court shall not be bound to act  in\r\n\r\na   formal   manner  or  be  bound  by  the  Evidence\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  but shall act according to  equity,  good\r\n\r\nconscience  and the substantial merits  of  the  case\r\n\r\nwithout regard to technicalities and legal forms.  It\r\n\r\nis for this reason, too, that legal representation is\r\n\r\nrestricted. It will be disastrous if the work of  the\r\n\r\nCourt   could  be  delayed  by  arguments  on   legal\r\n\r\ntechnicalities  or  questions of law.  The  Ordinance\r\n\r\nitself  provides for a summary decision on  questions\r\n\r\nof  law  by  reference to the State Advocate-General.\r\n\r\nThis  might not be perfect. It has at least the merit\r\n\r\nof  having  a quick decision without long  drawn  out\r\n\r\nlegal  arguments and costs. All this shows  that  the\r\n\r\nprocesses,  the  purpose  and  the  orders   of   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration Court cannot be  regarded  as\r\n\r\nthose  of courts of justice. The Court is, as I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  concerned with the registration of  collective\r\n\r\nagreements made between the parties and the making of\r\n\r\nagreements  for  employers and  employees  when  they\r\n\r\ncannot  reach  agreement on their own  account.  Once\r\n\r\nthis  is  accepted, I feel it will be wrong to  allow\r\n\r\nappeals from such agreements and awards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has already been accepted that the parties\r\n\r\nshould not be represented by advocates and solicitors\r\n\r\nin negotiations under the Ordinance. This has, on the\r\n\r\nwhole,  worked very well in practice and the  parties\r\n\r\nhave been able to deal with the substantial merits of\r\n\r\ntheir  claims  without regard to  technicalities  and\r\n\r\nlegal forms. As it is the view of the Government that\r\n\r\nall   negotiations  should  be  conducted  under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Ordinance, it  is  logical  that\r\n\r\nprohibition  against legal representation  should  be\r\n\r\nextended  to all negotiations relating to  industrial\r\n\r\nmatters. The amendment to section 21 of the Ordinance\r\n\r\nby  clause 7 of the Bill will enable a relaxation  to\r\n\r\nbe   made   in   the   general  prohibition   against\r\n\r\nparticipation  in negotiations in industrial  matters\r\n\r\nby advocates and solicitors.

T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  the Minister has moved amending the Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Ordinance contains certain provisions  that\r\n\r\nwill  bring  about significant changes in  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, it will be remembered that the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Ordinance was  drawn  up  after\r\n\r\nthorough  discussions  with  the  representatives  of\r\n\r\nworkers and trade unions. It is also well known  that\r\n\r\ncertain   provisions  in  the  Industrial   Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance  were themselves of a controversial  nature\r\n\r\nand the overall Bill presented to this House was,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  a  compromise Bill which contained as much  of\r\n\r\nthe   unions'  views  as  the  Government  considered\r\n\r\npossible, and the unions agreed to certain provisions\r\n\r\nas   a  general  compromise,  provisions  which   the\r\n\r\nGovernment had advocated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be remembered perhaps that I was one\r\n\r\nof  the  Members  of  this House  who  supported  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Ordinance. But that support  was\r\n\r\na  conditional support. I recall that I  did  clearly\r\n\r\nsay  that if it were the Lim Yew Hock Government then\r\n\r\nproposing  the  Industrial Relations Ordinance,  then\r\n\r\nthere   would  be  pickets  outside  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  House. I said that the unions were prepared\r\n\r\nto accept the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Ordinance as it was  introduced\r\n\r\nhere  because  the workers and unions had  confidence\r\n\r\nthen  in  the Government and they believed  that  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance would be put to use in a manner that  would\r\n\r\nbring  great advantage to the unions and  workers  in\r\n\r\nthe    process   of   collective   bargaining.   Sir,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  experience  has  only  brought  about\r\n\r\ndisappointment  to  many  unions.  I  notice  in  the\r\n\r\namendment that the intention of the Government  seems\r\n\r\nto be to provide another Court. I must say whether it\r\n\r\nis  to be one Court or two Courts is not as important\r\n\r\nas to what purpose these Arbitration Courts are to be\r\n\r\nput to use. Sir, if the Arbitration Courts are to  be\r\n\r\nlooked  upon  by workers and employers  as  political\r\n\r\ninstitutions of the Government, and if workers are to\r\n\r\nregard  them merely as instruments of the P.A.P. and\r\n\r\neven   if   employers  are  to  look  upon  them   as\r\n\r\ninstruments  of  the Government for taking  decisions\r\n\r\nwhich are politically advantageous to the Government,\r\n\r\nthen  I  say  that one, two or three Courts  are  not\r\n\r\ngoing to help industrial relations in any way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this does not mean that the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nare  against the amendment to provide for  more  than\r\n\r\none Court. We do realise that the present Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt  is not able to cope with the cases. I am  told\r\n\r\nthat  some cases which were referred as early as late\r\n\r\nlast  year  are  still  to be  heard  by  the  Court.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in  principle, we have  no  objection  to\r\n\r\nhaving  two or three Courts as the case may  be.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  we  are  against is the use of the  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt  for political purposes. Sir, I do not have  to\r\n\r\ngo  into  examples  to  quote what  some  unions  and\r\n\r\nemployers have said about the Arbitration Court. I am\r\n\r\nquite certain that the Minister for Health and Law is\r\n\r\naware  and I am quite certain that Members, generally\r\n\r\nin the Government Benches, are aware of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Arbitration Court was appointed, it\r\n\r\nwas  stated  that  the purpose of the  Court  was  to\r\n\r\nassist   in   industrial  relations.  The  Government\r\n\r\nstatement and the statement of the President  of  the\r\n\r\nCourt made at the opening of the Court, and even  the\r\n\r\nGovernment manifesto made it quite clear that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Arbitration  Court  was  not  going   to   mean\r\n\r\ncompulsory  arbitration, that the  Arbitration  Court\r\n\r\nwas  not  going  to mean interference  in  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations. Sir, there have been cases, but  before  I\r\n\r\ncome  to  them, clause 11 in page 4 of  the  amending\r\n\r\nBill  to  insert  a  new  section  to  the  Ordinance\r\n\r\nprovides  for  compulsory conciliation together  with\r\n\r\nclause 7 in page 3. There have been cases in the past\r\n\r\nwhere  the  Government  conciliation  machinery   had\r\n\r\nthought   fit   to  interfere  in  legitimate   trade\r\n\r\ndisputes.  We  have  nothing whatsoever  against  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  assisting  the  settlement   between\r\n\r\nemployers  and  employees. But  we  cannot  have  the\r\n\r\nGovernment interfering in collective bargaining  when\r\n\r\nit  is not called upon to interfere. We cannot accept\r\n\r\nthe  position  where  the Government  interfere  with\r\n\r\ncollective  bargaining to make political  capital.  I\r\n\r\nneed  only  quote,  Sir, the notorious  case  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment intervention in the Shaw dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> You said you won.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is important that if the Government\r\n\r\nwant  to  honour  what  they  said  in  the  election\r\n\r\nmanifesto and what the Court President and  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  themselves stated at the opening  of  the\r\n\r\nCourt, that the actual purpose of the Court is to try\r\n\r\nand  assist  both  unions and employers  in  bringing\r\n\r\nabout  a  settlement, then they must  try  and  avoid\r\n\r\nunnecessary  interference  in  trade  disputes.  That\r\n\r\nagain,  I  believe, is well known to  Members.  Today\r\n\r\nwhen  collective agreements are drawn up and sent  to\r\n\r\nthe  Court for certification, even in the wording  of\r\n\r\nthe  agreements, quite a lot of fuss is made by  some\r\n\r\npeople  in  responsible positions in the  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know whether the Minister for Health\r\n\r\nand  Law will agree with me that it is necessary when\r\n\r\ndrawing  up collective agreements to have phraseology\r\n\r\nthat  is acceptable to the workers and the employers.\r\n\r\nIt  does not necessarily mean that the legal form  of\r\n\r\nwording  is  necessarily understood and  accepted  by\r\n\r\nworkers  and by employers. Sir, it has been found  in\r\n\r\npractice that a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood  agreement  is  an agreement that  is  simple  and\r\n\r\nstraightforward    with   no    legal    jargon.    But\r\n\r\nunfortunately,   in  practice,  we   have   found   the\r\n\r\nArbitration Court wanting to change \"shall\"  to  \"will\"\r\n\r\nand  \"but\" to \"and\", and \"a\" to \"b\", and so  on.  I  am\r\n\r\nsure,  Sir,  if the Minister wishes to be  serious,  he\r\n\r\nwill  agree  with  me that this is  not  the  important\r\n\r\ncriterion  for  wanting to certify an agreement.  There\r\n\r\nhave   been  cases  where  I  have  myself  been   told\r\n\r\npersonally  that because I have refused to  change  one\r\n\r\nword  \"will\", the agreement must not be certified. Sir,\r\n\r\nin  the  principal  Ordinance,  the  President  of  the\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court  can  only  refuse  to  certify   an\r\n\r\nagreement  if  he  considers it to  be  against  public\r\n\r\ninterest. I notice there is an amendment moved here - and\r\n\r\nbasically that is maintained - viz, clause 8, at  page  3\r\n\r\nof the Bill:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Court may in its discretion refuse to certify a\r\n\r\nmemorandum  delivered  under subsection  (1)  of  this\r\n\r\nsection  if  it is of opinion that it is  not  in  the\r\n\r\npublic interest...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  principally  the  position is  that  only  if  the\r\n\r\nArbitration Court considers that a collective agreement\r\n\r\nis  not  in  the interests of the public, then  it  can\r\n\r\nrefuse  to  certify a collective agreement.  But,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthere have been cases where collective agreements  have\r\n\r\nnot been certified for various other reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I have to say in respect of the various\r\n\r\nclauses  I  would rather reserve until we come  to  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  stage. But what I do want to  say.  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nconclusion is that this amendment Bill is being  rushed\r\n\r\nthrough in quite some haste. We in the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nfeel   that  the  unions  must  be  consulted  on  this\r\n\r\namendment before it is adopted. Thus, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is  a  fair and reasonable suggestion that  we  are\r\n\r\nmaking. The principal Ordinance was drawn up only after\r\n\r\nconsultation with the unions and their representatives.\r\n\r\nAnd   I  say  that  the  amendments,  particularly  the\r\n\r\namendments  which  would in my view  bring  about  very\r\n\r\nsignificant changes - for example, changes to provide for\r\n\r\ncompulsory  conciliation which is just one  step  below\r\n\r\ncompulsory  arbitration - we have reason to believe,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government are, in  fact,  thinking  of\r\n\r\ncompulsory arbitration. We feel that amendments of this\r\n\r\nnature  and of this significance are matters that  will\r\n\r\naffect  radically all trade unions, all  employers  and\r\n\r\nevery  aspect  of  industrial relations  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we think it is only fair that the Government\r\n\r\narrange  to have proper consultation with trade  unions\r\n\r\nand their representatives before they seek to pass this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.58 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  are one or two points on which I wish to address\r\n\r\nthe  House. If I may say so, Mr Speaker, Sir, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  deal  with what I consider to  be  the  legal\r\n\r\naspects of this Bill, and my colleague, the Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill, will deal with what may be called the  trade\r\n\r\nunion aspect of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the Member for Thomson that the\r\n\r\npurpose of moving the original Bill was, as he says, to\r\n\r\nassist  industrial  relations  in  Singapore.  You  may\r\n\r\nrecollect,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that when that  Bill  was\r\n\r\nbrought  into  the  House  originally,  there   was   a\r\n\r\ndifficult situation prevailing in the industrial world,\r\n\r\na  situation that was tending to upset the  economy  of\r\n\r\nthe  country.  And  therefore it  became  necessary  to\r\n\r\nintroduce the Bill in order to bring some stability  in\r\n\r\nindustrial relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The justification for this Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfrom  my  point of view is this: the employer  and  the\r\n\r\nemployee as a result of this legislation would be  able\r\n\r\nbeforehand  to  know  where either  stands  in  matters\r\n\r\nrelated to industrial disputes. So that unless there is\r\n\r\na  firm  base on which both parties to a dispute  could\r\n\r\nwork  on and unless that firm base continues throughout\r\n\r\nthe  dispute  and also throughout the  hearing  of  the\r\n\r\ndispute  in the Court, we could have a situation  where\r\n\r\neither party could have any confidence in this law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I wish to bring up arising out of the\r\n\r\npoint  I have now made, Mr Speaker, Sir, is this:  the\r\n\r\nfirst   base - the   first  inescapable   base - on   which\r\n\r\nindustrial  relations can be regulated is the  base  of\r\n\r\nthe law. Now, both\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparties  to a dispute must clearly understand  the\r\n\r\nlaw  affecting an industrial dispute; and how that\r\n\r\nlegal position will be effected in a dispute as  a\r\n\r\nresult of a decision by the Industrial Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt  is a matter which concerns both parties  to\r\n\r\nthe   dispute.  Mr  Speaker,  I  agree  with  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Law that the Industrial  Court  must\r\n\r\nhave  a  great deal of latitude and that  it  must\r\n\r\nhave  a  great deal of room in which to manoeuvre - if  I  may  use that phrase, and I use  it  in  no\r\n\r\ndisrespectful sense - in order that industrial peace\r\n\r\nmight be maintained. But, Mr Speaker, Sir, if  in\r\n\r\nthe  latitude given to this Court it violates  the\r\n\r\nlaw of the land, then that Court is bringing about\r\n\r\na situation in Singapore when neither party to the\r\n\r\ndispute  can  have  any confidence  in  the  Court\r\n\r\nbecause  neither party will know  what  the  Court\r\n\r\nwill do next, if it is not firmly anchored to  the\r\n\r\nbase  of  the  law.  To make my point  clear,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I will refer to two cases which the Court\r\n\r\ndecided.  I think one is the case of the newspaper\r\n\r\nknown  as  the  Kerala Bandu  where  there  was  a\r\n\r\ndispute between an employee and the employer,  the\r\n\r\nnewspaper. So far as I could read the judgment  of\r\n\r\nthe  Court,  it  held that the dismissal  of  this\r\n\r\nemployee  was  justified.  Having  held  that  the\r\n\r\ndismissal of the employee was justified, the Court\r\n\r\nthen went on to order six months' compensation  to\r\n\r\nthe  employee whose dismissal was justified.  Now,\r\n\r\nthe  Court cannot have it both ways, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, If  the dismissal was justified, no question\r\n\r\nof  compensation arises. That would be the  normal\r\n\r\ndecision in a Court. Now, is the Industrial  Court\r\n\r\nthen to be allowed to set itself above the law  of\r\n\r\nthe  country and while holding that the  dismissal\r\n\r\nwas  justified,  yet  to  say,  \"I  feel  you  the\r\n\r\nemployer    should    give   him    six    months'\r\n\r\ncompensation\"?  If it says six  months,  it  could\r\n\r\nwell  say  two  years. What point  does  one  then\r\n\r\nreach,  Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Industrial  Court\r\n\r\nis  allowed  arbitrarily to flout the law  of  the\r\n\r\nland? Might I mention just one other case? I think\r\n\r\nit  was  in a dispute between a transport  company\r\n\r\nand  its  employees  where  the  Industrial  Court\r\n\r\nordered  that  the transport company  should  take\r\n\r\nback the employees whose case the Court had tried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first principle of law in a contract of\r\n\r\nemployment  is  that  there  can  be  no  specific\r\n\r\nperformance of a contract of employment.  That  is\r\n\r\nthe base of the law on which we all securely rest.\r\n\r\nIf  the Industrial Court is allowed to upset  that\r\n\r\nbase, I ask you, Mr Speaker, Sir, what confidence\r\n\r\ncan  there  be  in the employing  public?  In  our\r\n\r\neconomy  the employing public is just as important\r\n\r\nas  that  section  of the public  which  is  being\r\n\r\nemployed.  Unless  both of them  know  what  their\r\n\r\nrights  and liabilities are under the law  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry, and how the Industrial Court will  honour\r\n\r\nthe law of the country, it will be impossible,  in\r\n\r\nmy  submission, Mr Speaker, Sir, to  establish  a\r\n\r\nstate of affairs where both parties could have any\r\n\r\nconfidence in this Court. That brings  me  to  the\r\n\r\npresent Bill by virtue of which the Government  is\r\n\r\nnow seeking to give this Court even greater powers\r\n\r\nand   greater  latitude  by  trying  to  make   it\r\n\r\nabsolutely   impossible,  in  so  far   as   human\r\n\r\ningenuity can, to take any dispute from this Court\r\n\r\nto  the  High  Court. It appears  that  there  are\r\n\r\ncertain  loopholes  under the  existing  Ordinance\r\n\r\nthrough  which  the  decisions of  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nCourt  were taken to our normal Courts  and  as  a\r\n\r\nresult   of   which  certain  decisions   of   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Court have been queried. Some  of  the\r\n\r\namendments   here  are  intended  to  plug   these\r\n\r\nloopholes.  I do seriously ask the Government  to\r\n\r\nconsider  this: whether it is their intention,  by\r\n\r\ngiving  the Industrial Court this immunity by  not\r\n\r\nallowing  any  appeal to any  other  tribunal,  to\r\n\r\nenable  the  Industrial Court  to  go  on  such  a\r\n\r\nrampage as to over-ride the law of the land and to\r\n\r\nformulate their own laws in making decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second point is the\r\n\r\nquestion   of   referees.   Under   the   existing\r\n\r\nOrdinance, it is possible now for the President of\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Court to be named a referee either\r\n\r\nunder  a collective agreement under section 23  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance  or  under an  award  made  by  the\r\n\r\nCourt - where  either the parties privately  amongst\r\n\r\nthemselves  could  nominate the President  of  the\r\n\r\nCourt  to  be a referee or the Court itself  could\r\n\r\nnominate  the President to be a referee.  Now  the\r\n\r\nsituation was reached where the referee's decision\r\n\r\nwas challenged\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the referee himself sat as a court on his own\r\n\r\ndecision - a  situation highly undesirable,  however\r\n\r\nmuch  one may contend that it is quite legal under\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of the existing Ordinance.  I  see\r\n\r\nthat  the Government is taking steps to alter  the\r\n\r\nexisting  law  by making it not possible  for  the\r\n\r\nPresident  or the Deputy President  to  sit  as  a\r\n\r\nreferee. I welcome that, because it is contrary to\r\n\r\nthe  accepted principle of law that a  person  who\r\n\r\nmakes  a  decision  should be allowed  to  sit  in\r\n\r\njudgment on an appeal from his decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do draw the attention of the Minister to\r\n\r\nthis.  Under section 23 - these are matters on which\r\n\r\nI  will  elaborate when we come to the clauses  in\r\n\r\nCommittee - it   would  appear  from   the   general\r\n\r\nphrasing of the Industrial Relaxations (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill  now before us that the right of appeal  from\r\n\r\nreferees  appointed  under  section  23   of   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  is  not the same as under  the  section\r\n\r\nwhich  provides for an appeal from a referee under\r\n\r\na Court award.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point the Minister was making was that a\r\n\r\ncollective agreement will now go to the Court  for\r\n\r\napproval,  meaning  the President  and  two  other\r\n\r\npersons  appointed from the panels instead  of  as\r\n\r\nnow  to  the President alone, and thereby implying\r\n\r\nthat  the position is being made much better  than\r\n\r\nit  is today. But what he gives with the left hand\r\n\r\nhe  takes  back  with the right by moving  another\r\n\r\namendment  to  section 55 of the  Ordinance  which\r\n\r\nsays  that the powers of the Court under  sections\r\n\r\n23,  52,  53  and  54 of this Ordinance  shall  be\r\n\r\nexercisable  by  the  Court  constituted  by   the\r\n\r\nPresident alone. So although he says under section\r\n\r\n23  the  agreements will be approved by the Court,\r\n\r\nbut  under  section 55 he brings in  an  amendment\r\n\r\nwhereby  the  President acting  under  section  55\r\n\r\nmeans the Court itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do suggest to the Minister that wherever a\r\n\r\nreferee  has  given  a  decision, that  referee's\r\n\r\ndecision should go to an Industrial Court composed\r\n\r\nof  three persons and not to the President  alone.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  make  this further point. That any  appeal\r\n\r\nfrom the decision of an Industrial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt  on  a  point of law should be treated  like\r\n\r\nthat  of an appeal from the normal courts  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the most\r\n\r\nsignificant phrase of the speech of the Member for\r\n\r\nThomson  is this, \"That the Industrial Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt  is  made an instrument of the P.A.P.\"  When\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Relations Bill was debated in this\r\n\r\nHouse  in  1960 at that time there  was  only  the\r\n\r\ngenuine opposition of eight Members - I did say that\r\n\r\nit  would  appear  that what  the  Government  was\r\n\r\ntrying  to  do was to make this law to  serve  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  At that time, the 13 great Barisan Members\r\n\r\nwho  sat  on the other side of the House ridiculed\r\n\r\nmy  allegations. They laughed at me. They were not\r\n\r\ncontent with that. They even cried out that had it\r\n\r\nbeen  a Lim Yew Hock Government, such a Bill would\r\n\r\nnot  have  been  introduced  by  that  Government.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, Sir, the shoe must now be pinching\r\n\r\nthe  foot of the Member for Thomson for him to use\r\n\r\nthe   same   words  as  I  used.  The   Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Court is intended to be an  instrument\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleague, the Member for Farrer Park,\r\n\r\nhas  pointed  out the various points of  law.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  I want to add now is just a little bit  from\r\n\r\nthe trade union angle. One thing that struck me as\r\n\r\nbeing funny is that it is now the intention of the\r\n\r\nGovernment, by the proposed amendment, to wipe out\r\n\r\nthe T.U.C. of which they were singing high praises\r\n\r\nin  1960. They said that the T.U.C. was wonderful,\r\n\r\na  genuine organisation for workers, and  that  it\r\n\r\nhad  the support of the Government, and therefore,\r\n\r\nit  must  be given due recognition. Now  it  seems\r\n\r\nthat the T.U.C. is to be taken out of the picture.\r\n\r\nI  cannot  understand why, because, as  far  as  I\r\n\r\nknow - and   I  may  be  wrong,  I  am  subject   to\r\n\r\ncorrection - the T.U.C. is still a legal entity.  It\r\n\r\nhas  not  been  dissolved in accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  of the T.U.C. It was  said  to  have\r\n\r\nbeen  dissolved just because the Secretary-General\r\n\r\nof  the T.U.C. had a few words with his colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Labour and Law, at  that  time,\r\n\r\nalong  these lines. \"Things are getting dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe   Communists  are  getting  control.  We  must\r\n\r\ndissolve the T.U.C.\" So\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid  Mr  Kandasamy,  the Secretary-General;  and\r\n\r\nthere  was the Minister for Labour and Law saying,\r\n\r\n\"Yes,  we  must dissolve the T.U.C.\" And  yet  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C. is  today a legal entity. I am subject  to\r\n\r\ncorrection. If I am wrong, the Minister  will,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  point out my mistakes. But as  far  as  I\r\n\r\nknow,  the T.U.C. is still a legal entity. Now  it\r\n\r\nwould seem that the great heroes of the T.U.C. - the\r\n\r\nTen  Tall  Men - plus the tallest of them  all,  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General, are now divided into two camps,\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis. The T.U.C. is\r\n\r\nno  longer  functioning, although  the  T.U.C. is\r\n\r\nstill  a registered body. I do hope that when  the\r\n\r\nMinister asks for nomination from the trade  union\r\n\r\nemployees  he must take due note that  the  unions\r\n\r\nwhich  will  be  asked to nominate  employees  are\r\n\r\ngenuine unions and they should not try to consider\r\n\r\nit  from the point of view whether it is a  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nunion   or   a  Barisan  Sosialis  union   or   an\r\n\r\nindependent union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister for Health and Law were to\r\n\r\ncontinue  the  evil practice that the  P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nbeen  following for the past two and a half years,\r\n\r\nbefore  the  disintegration of  the  P.A.P., life\r\n\r\nwould  be  unhappy  for all. It  could  not  solve\r\n\r\nindustrial  disputes  in  that  way.  It  is   not\r\n\r\npossible.  In fact, I did say that the  Bill  they\r\n\r\nwere  introducing in 1960 would not help to  bring\r\n\r\npeace  in the industrial field. In fact, it  would\r\n\r\nencourage more industrial unrest. It has happened.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Government, having learnt the error of\r\n\r\ntheir   ways,  have  seen  fit  to  introduce   an\r\n\r\namendment Bill to help correct the mischief  which\r\n\r\nthey deliberately perpetrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment Bill is important. When the\r\n\r\noriginal  Bill was debated, we did urge  upon  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that it should be referred to a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  because at almost the last minute,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment introduced 50 rush amendments. We  were\r\n\r\ndefeated because the Barisan Sosialis were on  the\r\n\r\nother  side and they were at that time in  cahoots\r\n\r\nwith  the  P.A.P. But now, although  the  amending\r\n\r\nBill  is such a small Bill, yet the effect of  the\r\n\r\namendments to be proposed is great.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge upon the Government, in order to\r\n\r\nbring  a  healthier atmosphere to  the  industrial\r\n\r\nfield  and to give the trade unions an opportunity\r\n\r\nto give their views on the proposed amendments, to\r\n\r\nrefer this Bill to Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwill  be  very  brief.

He has gained  the  impression\r\n\r\nthat,  by the amendment we have proposed in clause\r\n\r\n11  of  the  Bill, the Government are  seeking  to\r\n\r\nintroduce   what   he   has   termed   \"compulsory\r\n\r\nconciliation\". Clause 11 of the Bill introduces  a\r\n\r\nnew  section  27A in the Ordinance.

Member is referring to the\r\n\r\namendment  to  section  21 of the principal  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nthere  would  really be no point for  me  to  speak  on\r\n\r\nclause   11   now.  There  has  been  no   interference\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  with the procedure laid down in respect  of\r\n\r\ncollective bargaining in Part III of the Bill. Although\r\n\r\nthis  procedure  is referred to in section  21  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance, it was never followed in the sense that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  could  always  compel compulsory  conferences\r\n\r\neven   if   the  procedures  set  out  in  the  earlier\r\n\r\nprovisions of this part of the Bill were not  followed,\r\n\r\nand   the   amendment  gives  effect  to  the  existing\r\n\r\npractice. That is all it does. It was found in practice\r\n\r\nthat  there  were  unions  which  did  not  follow  the\r\n\r\nprocedures  laid  down in this part  of  the  Bill  and\r\n\r\ncircumstances  arose  where the Minister  had  to  call\r\n\r\ncompulsory conferences. In those circumstances, if  you\r\n\r\nwill  look  at  the  wording  of  section  21  of   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance, the  Minister would legally  be  restrained\r\n\r\nfrom directing persons to attend conferences where  the\r\n\r\nprocedures were not followed. But, in fact, he did call\r\n\r\ncompulsory conferences. And this amendment gives effect\r\n\r\nto  that  practice.  I cannot see how  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson  can say that the Government are intending,  by\r\n\r\nthis   amendment,  to  introduce  what  he  has  termed\r\n\r\n\"compulsory conciliation\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point he made was that we were amending\r\n\r\nthe provisions with regard to collective bargaining  to\r\n\r\nmake  it  more  difficult for the unions to  get  their\r\n\r\ncollective agreements registered. Mr Speaker, Sir,  it\r\n\r\nwas  found  in  practice that the unions were  entering\r\n\r\ninto  collective agreements with employers, and on  the\r\n\r\nsideline entering into other agreements which were  not\r\n\r\nshown  in the agreements which they brought before  the\r\n\r\nCourt   for  registration.  This  amendment  has   been\r\n\r\nintroduced to put a stop to those malpractices.  Surely\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Thomson cannot object to this amendment\r\n\r\nin  view of his knowledge that there were such sideline\r\n\r\nagreements  being  entered into between  employers  and\r\n\r\nunions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on his third point, the Member for Thomson said\r\n\r\nthat  there  must be consultation before any amendments\r\n\r\nare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintroduced. We agreed clause 83 of this Bill  with  the\r\n\r\n\"Ten Tall Men\" in the former T.U.C. It is provided here\r\n\r\nthat  amendments should be made in accordance with  the\r\n\r\nobservations  on  the working of the Ordinance  by  the\r\n\r\nPresident of the Court, and this amending Ordinance  is\r\n\r\nintroduced  in  consequence  of  the  Report  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have  received from the  President  of  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Court on the working of the Court  for  the\r\n\r\nperiod 15th September. 1960, to 31st December, 1961. So\r\n\r\nwhere   then  is  there  any  justification   for   his\r\n\r\ncontention  that there must be consultation  before  an\r\n\r\namending Bill like this is introduced?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me deal with the comments of the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park. He said that there must be a legal  basis\r\n\r\nfor all judicial determinations. He has quoted the case\r\n\r\nwhere  the Court found that the dismissal of a  certain\r\n\r\nemployee was justified and it still proceeded to  award\r\n\r\ncompensation.  He has also drawn the attention  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  to another case where an employee in a transport\r\n\r\ncompany  was dismissed and the employer was obliged  to\r\n\r\nreinstate  him in employment. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  those\r\n\r\nare the very functions of this Court. It is provided in\r\n\r\nsection  56 of the Ordinance that the Court  in  making\r\n\r\nits decisions \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`. . . shall act according to equity, good conscience\r\n\r\nand  the substantial merits of the case without  regard\r\n\r\nto technicalities and legal forms.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  is  because of these considerations that the  Court\r\n\r\ncan  make  such orders. The Court is able to look  into\r\n\r\nall  the  circumstances of the case  and  then  make  a\r\n\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of referees, we have realised that it\r\n\r\nwould  be  against  good legal practice  to  allow  the\r\n\r\nPresident of the Court to be a referee in an award  and\r\n\r\nfor  him  then  as  the  President  of  the  Court   to\r\n\r\nadjudicate on the award that he has made; and for  that\r\n\r\npurpose these amendments have been made. In the case of\r\n\r\nreferees,  whether they are appointed by the collective\r\n\r\nagreement itself or whether a referee is designated  in\r\n\r\nan award, when he makes a decision,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  if  there is an appeal, it would have to  be  the\r\n\r\nCourt under section 40 of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, for the submissions of the Member for Anson. Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  he  knows  very little  about  this.  I  will,\r\n\r\nhowever,  tell him that I held many meetings  with  the\r\n\r\nBar Committee on the amendments that we propose to this\r\n\r\nBill. They insisted that (here should be an appeal on a\r\n\r\npoint  of law to the Court of Appeal from the decisions\r\n\r\nof  this Court. Mr Speaker, Sir, I have indicated just\r\n\r\nnow, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill, when the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  was  not present,  why  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible for us to allow an appeal on the facts from an\r\n\r\naward to a Court of Appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Not on facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> On facts or on mixed questions of facts\r\n\r\nand  law  to the Court of Appeal. That is not possible\r\n\r\nfor   this  reason,  that  the  processes  are   quite\r\n\r\ndifferent.  The  common law, as we know  it,  enforces\r\n\r\nprivate  agreements  between the parties.  The  common\r\n\r\nlaw,  as  we  know  it,  never enforces  a  collective\r\n\r\nagreement as such. Under the procedures of this Court,\r\n\r\nthe  parties  make  collective agreements  which  they\r\n\r\nproceed  to  register.  If they  fail  to  make  these\r\n\r\nagreements, it is this third party which is designated\r\n\r\nthe  Court which makes the agreements for them.  Under\r\n\r\nthat  procedure, it is not possible for points of  law\r\n\r\nto  arise  in  the making of the agreement.  For  that\r\n\r\nreason,  it is not possible for there to be an appeal,\r\n\r\nfrom an award of the Court to the Court of Appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope I have adequately explained\r\n\r\nto  the  Members  of  the House the  reasons  for  the\r\n\r\namendments to this Bill.

It appears to me that if\r\n\r\nthis  exclusion is inserted, it may very  well  affect\r\n\r\nthe  unions in their industrial relaxations  with  the\r\n\r\nemployers.  For instance, it may be that  an  employer\r\n\r\ncan  have an individual contract with an employee  who\r\n\r\nmay  be  eligible  to  join a  trade  union  and  such\r\n\r\ncontract  can  contain terms which may  be  considered\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory.

So that it is not  possible\r\n\r\nfor  employers  to  use this amendment  to  enter  into\r\n\r\nindividual   contracts  of  service   with   individual\r\n\r\nemployees  so  as  to  defeat  the  purposes  of   this\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That clause 5 stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, clause 5 is a very significant\r\n\r\namendment.  Sir,  in the explanatory  statement  it  is\r\n\r\nquite clearly stated that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The appointment of members to the employees panel is\r\n\r\nto be selected by such trade unions of employees as may\r\n\r\nbe invited by the Minister.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment will mean the deletion of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Trades  Union Congress  from  the  principal\r\n\r\nOrdinance and the substitution of the phrase  \"a  trade\r\n\r\nunion  of employees\". As is well known today, in  place\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore Trades Union Congress, there  is  no\r\n\r\ncentral  organisation  of trade unions.  There  is  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Association  of  Trade  Unions,   which   is\r\n\r\nawaiting registration, and the Singapore National Trade\r\n\r\nUnion Centre, which is also awaiting registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, Sir, the legal position of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Trades Union Congress is still not clear.  As\r\n\r\nthe Member\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill has already pointed out earlier on,  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C. legally still functions. In fact, I believe  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Labour  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  itself once confirmed that the T.U.C. was\r\n\r\nstill  a legal body. While, on the one hand, the T.U.C.\r\n\r\nlegally exists, we have two other central organisations\r\n\r\nseeking  registration. The Minister  proposes  to  have\r\n\r\nappointments  made  to  the panel  of  the  Court  from\r\n\r\nnominations  by  individual unions. If the  explanatory\r\n\r\nstatement  is  of any guide, it is quite  certain  that\r\n\r\nsuch nominations will only be accepted from unions that\r\n\r\nmay  be  invited  by  the Minister.  Sir,  knowing  the\r\n\r\nperformance of P.A.P. Ministers in the past there is no\r\n\r\ndoubt  whatsoever  that it would  disregard  the  large\r\n\r\nnumber of unions which do not come within the ambit  of\r\n\r\nthe  National  Trade Union Centre. There  is  no  doubt\r\n\r\nagain  that  the majority of the unions are within  the\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. group  of unions. If a proper  representative\r\n\r\npanel  is to be had, then representation must be sought\r\n\r\nfrom all unions irrespective of whether they belong  to\r\n\r\nthe  S.A.T.U. group of unions or the N.T.U.C. group  of\r\n\r\nunions. I would like to ask the Minister, first of all,\r\n\r\nwhether  it is his intention to consult all  unions  or\r\n\r\njust selected unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nis  aware  of  section  6 (2) of  the  Ordinance  which\r\n\r\nprovides that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The employer panel and the employee panel shall each\r\n\r\nconsist of ten persons appointed by the Minister  whose\r\n\r\nnames shall be notified in the Gazette.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson was one of\r\n\r\nthe  Ten Tall Men when there was a T.U.C. As a Minister\r\n\r\nI   had  written  to  the  T.U.C. umpteen  times   for\r\n\r\nnominations from them. But the Ten Tall Men would  only\r\n\r\ndesignate  four persons to serve on the employee  panel\r\n\r\nof this Court. There have been differences amongst them\r\n\r\nand  a  break-up of the trade union position, but these\r\n\r\nfour  persons are still members of the employee  panel.\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,  Sir,  we  would  be  glad  to  have   a\r\n\r\nrepresentative selection of the trade unionists  to  be\r\n\r\non  the  employee side of the Court.  I  can  give  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson this assurance, if  it  is  really\r\n\r\nnecessary, that we would be glad to have nominees from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  respective groups on this Court.  He  knows  the\r\n\r\nposition,  Mr  Speaker, Sir. He is trying  to  make  a\r\n\r\npolitical point, knowing it to be untrue, in this House\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am glad the Minister is able to give an\r\n\r\nassurance  on the lines that I have asked  for.  But  I\r\n\r\nmust   say   that  if  the  T.U.C. does  not  nominate\r\n\r\nsufficient members to the panel, then it is as much the\r\n\r\nfault  of  the Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Culture as it is mine and any other member of  the\r\n\r\nSecretariat.  Be  that as it may, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwant  to  ask  the  Minister what is the  necessity  in\r\n\r\nwanting  to have the amendment made here to delete  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Trades Union Congress when the Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress,  in  fact, at the moment exists  as  a  legal\r\n\r\nbody,  although the Secretariat of the T.U.C. does  not\r\n\r\nfunction, although the Executive Council of the  T.U.C.\r\n\r\ndoes  not function, because they have all read  in  the\r\n\r\npapers   that  the  Minister  has  had  it   dissolved.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it appears that the legal position of the\r\n\r\nT.U.C. is such that it still functions. Surely if  the\r\n\r\nMinister  wants to amend the provision to  provide  for\r\n\r\nsome other organisation instead of the Singapore Trades\r\n\r\nUnion  Congress, then it must necessarily be a  central\r\n\r\norganisation  of trade unions. But if  he  just  simply\r\n\r\nsays  \"a  trade union of employees\" - Sir,  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nthere are on paper about 120 trade unions. About 30  of\r\n\r\nthem are ghost unions and about\r\n\r\n90 of them are active. Surely the Minister is not going\r\n\r\nto write to 90 trade unions in Singapore asking them to\r\n\r\nnominate members to the panel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we must accept the fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  T.U.C. is in a state of suspended animation.\r\n\r\nTwo  groups have broken away from it and set themselves\r\n\r\nup  as  the  S.A.T.U. group and the National  group  of\r\n\r\ntrade unions. Mr Speaker, Sir, we have to accept  this\r\n\r\nas  a  fact. We have had difficulty already in  getting\r\n\r\nthe  employee  panel for the Court that is  functioning\r\n\r\nnow.  We propose to introduce another Court. So we must\r\n\r\nhave more of these gentlemen to serve on these employee\r\n\r\npanels.  We  are doing our best to get a representative\r\n\r\ngroup  for  these panels. It is no use writing  to  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C. when you know that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  will  be no response from that organisation.

I  am\r\n\r\ntelling  you, Mr Speaker, that some of these  powerful\r\n\r\nunions  do not want to be associated with the  work  of\r\n\r\nthis Court.

Whereas if the amendment  were  to  be\r\n\r\naccepted, then it would mean any trade dispute. Sir,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not know the intention of the P.A.P. Government  as\r\n\r\nto  exactly what they propose to do. But knowing again,\r\n\r\nSir,  their performance in the past and realising  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a new clause moved to section 27A,  it  does\r\n\r\nappear  to me that the intention of the Government  is,\r\n\r\nin  fact, to make conciliation compulsory. Sir, I  will\r\n\r\nbe --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> shook his head.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the Minister for Health and Law shakes\r\n\r\nhis  head.  I will be very glad indeed if the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill   stand  up  and  say  that  they  will  not  make\r\n\r\nconciliation compulsory. At the moment, as the Minister\r\n\r\nsays,   he   has  the  power  to  call  for  compulsory\r\n\r\nconferences. But he can only do so if the  dispute  has\r\n\r\nbeen  notified by the Commissioner under section 18  or\r\n\r\n20  of  this Ordinance. Sir, the Minister may say later\r\n\r\non  that the Communist group of unions are avoiding the\r\n\r\nconciliation machinery and are not abiding  by  section\r\n\r\n16  of  the  Ordinance which provides that negotiations\r\n\r\nare  to  follow  as a set procedure. I  must  tell  the\r\n\r\nMinister, Sir, that it is not that these unions want to\r\n\r\navoid the Ministry of Labour. It is not that they  want\r\n\r\nto carry out negotiations outside the provisions of the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Ordinance. The Minister knows full\r\n\r\nwell  that  there  are  numerous  disputes  that  arise\r\n\r\nbetween  unions  and  employers every  day.  There  are\r\n\r\ndisputes as important as wage claims, claims in respect\r\n\r\nof improvement of conditions of service; also there are\r\n\r\ndisputes like dismissals, pay cuts and so on. There are\r\n\r\nhundreds\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof these disputes. I shall deal with that point when we\r\n\r\ncome to discussing clause 11 of the amendment Bill. But\r\n\r\nit  is however related to section 7 of the Bill. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  possible, in the first place, to have every single\r\n\r\ndispute follow the provisions of this Ordinance. That I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Minister will agree. We have  no  objection\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  to  having  section 16  and  other  related\r\n\r\nsections followed strictly in industrial relations. But\r\n\r\nwhat  we  do  not  want is to give  the  Minister  wide\r\n\r\npowers - a  blank  cheque - to compel any  dispute  to  be\r\n\r\nreferred to the Ministry of Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not out of place for me to mention once again\r\n\r\nthe Shaw dispute. In the Shaw dispute, the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour  unreasonably interfered with the  negotiations.\r\n\r\nHe  called  on  the  workers to attend  a  conciliation\r\n\r\nmeeting   in  the  Victoria  Memorial  Hall,   a   call\r\n\r\nunprecedented in the history of the labour movement  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  a call that was made in complete  disregard\r\n\r\nof  a  trade  union  that  was  legally  registered  to\r\n\r\nrepresent the workers, a trade union which enjoyed  the\r\n\r\nconfidence  of the workers. I do not want  to  go  into\r\n\r\nvarious  other examples. But I have no doubt whatsoever\r\n\r\nin  my  mind, knowing the P.A.P., that the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nthis  amendment is to have the right to interfere  with\r\n\r\nany  trade  dispute as they choose. As I said,  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister  is  prepared  to give an  assurance,  and  if\r\n\r\nprovided he honours that assurance that it is  not  his\r\n\r\nintention  or  the  intention  of  his  Government   to\r\n\r\ninterfere with trade disputes when they are not  called\r\n\r\nupon to interfere, then I shall be much obliged indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson  has  got  the wrong  end  of  the  stick.\r\n\r\nSections 18 and 20 provide that a trade dispute has  to\r\n\r\nbe  notified  by  the  Commissioner  to  the  Minister.\r\n\r\nSection 16 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A trade union of employees may serve on an employer...notice...for a collective agreement setting out proposals for a collective agreement.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  if  after one week the employer has not served  a\r\n\r\nnotice  of acceptance, then the union under section  18\r\n\r\nwill  inform  the  Commissioner  for  Labour  that  the\r\n\r\nemployer  has  ignored the service of the notice.  Then\r\n\r\nthe Commissioner will do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  he can to try and bring the two parties together,\r\n\r\nand  when  the  Commissioner feels it is his  duty,  he\r\n\r\nshall then notify the Minister. And if the Minister  so\r\n\r\ndirects,  he  then  notifies  the  Registrar   of   the\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court. Section 20 is just an extension  of\r\n\r\nsection 16 where a notice has been served and where the\r\n\r\nemployer  has accepted the notice and the  two  parties\r\n\r\nhave  sat for a period of two weeks and tried to thrash\r\n\r\nout  an  agreement,  and where no  agreement  has  been\r\n\r\nreached,  any  party - the  union  of  employees  or  the\r\n\r\nemployer  himself - can  notify  the  Commissioner.   The\r\n\r\nCommissioner  then will do what he can to  bring  about\r\n\r\npeace through conciliation. It is only when he so feels\r\n\r\nthat his attempts at conciliation are unsuccessful that\r\n\r\nhe  notifies  the  Minister. The  Minister,  if  he  so\r\n\r\ndirects   the  Commissioner,  shall  then  notify   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of the Arbitration Court. Unless these  two\r\n\r\nsections  of  this  Part of this  Ordinance  have  been\r\n\r\ncomplied  with,  section  21  means  that  unless   the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  been  notified of a trade  dispute,  he\r\n\r\ncannot exercise his powers under section 21. The powers\r\n\r\nconferred on the Minister under section 21 is to try to\r\n\r\nbring  about  peace. The amendment will just  give  the\r\n\r\nMinister  the extra power that is required  to  promote\r\n\r\nindustrial peace. With this amendment he can,  even  if\r\n\r\nthe  union  or the employer tries to hide  things  away\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Commissioner, and even if  they  do  not  go\r\n\r\nthrough  the  process outlined in Part  III  where  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  has not been notified of any negotiations\r\n\r\nor  any dispute, the Minister can, if he feels that the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  country demand it,  bring  the  two\r\n\r\nparties together by force and tell them that they have\r\n\r\nto  sit  down  and find a solution to the dispute.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  has  no power under section 21 to  force  any\r\n\r\nparty to accept anything.  What he has the power to  do\r\n\r\nis to summon any trade union or any employer to come to\r\n\r\nhis  office for a discussion even though that union  or\r\n\r\nthat employer deliberately keeps it quiet and wants  to\r\n\r\nkeep  the  dispute outside the scope of this Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the procedure in respect\r\n\r\nof  collective bargaining set out in Part III  of  this\r\n\r\nBill  was agreed to between the Government and the  Ten\r\n\r\nTall Men.

The moment this  Bill\r\n\r\nwas  enacted, Mr Speaker, Sir, they refused to  follow\r\n\r\nthe  procedure set out in this Part of the  Bill.  They\r\n\r\nproceeded  to make agreements which they considered  to\r\n\r\nbe  in  pursuance of industrial relations  outside  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you will look at Part III of the Bill you will see\r\n\r\nit  sets  out the procedure to be followed. Whenever  a\r\n\r\nunion   enters  into  collective  bargaining,  in   all\r\n\r\nfairness and in all justice, it must serve a notice  to\r\n\r\ntreat  first.  It must give the employer  a  chance  to\r\n\r\nconsider its proposals. There must be a meeting between\r\n\r\nthe  parties.  Then if they cannot reach agreement, if\r\n\r\nthey  are  deadlocked, the dispute is referred  to  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner for Labour. He tries to conciliate. And if\r\n\r\nthey still fail to reach agreement, then he refers  the\r\n\r\nmatter  to  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  or  to   the\r\n\r\nMinister. These are the processes they have agreed with\r\n\r\nus.  No sooner had this Bill been enacted, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\nSir, then they refused to follow these procedures. They\r\n\r\nsaid   that  there  was  such  a  thing  as  collective\r\n\r\nbargaining outside the procedures of this Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that is a loophole in the law. We\r\n\r\nbelieved  that  we  were dealing  with  honest  people.\r\n\r\nBecause of their dishonesty, Mr Speaker, Sir, we  have\r\n\r\nto  tighten up the provisions of this Bill. That is why\r\n\r\nit  is  provided -  and  clause 7 so  provides - that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  shall have the power to compel  a  compulsory\r\n\r\nconference  whether they have followed these procedures\r\n\r\nor  not. And clause 11 of the Bill, which introduces  a\r\n\r\nnew  section  27A, makes it an offence for  anybody  to\r\n\r\nconduct negotiations otherwise than in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe procedures set out in this Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson knows the\r\n\r\nposition  very well that these procedures  have  to  be\r\n\r\nfollowed  only  on occasions when, say,  a  union  puts\r\n\r\nforward   proposals  for  a  collective  agreement   in\r\n\r\nrelation to any industrial matter. If it wants  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe employer for a collective agreement with regard  to\r\n\r\nsalaries  or conditions of service, then it  must  have\r\n\r\nrecourse  to  these procedures. But where  things  like\r\n\r\nthis  happen, where men are dismissed in the course  of\r\n\r\ntheir work, Mr Speaker, Sir, these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprocedures  do not require that you serve a  notice  on\r\n\r\nthe  employer.  Why should you serve  a  notice  on  an\r\n\r\nemployer  with regard to a dismissal? That is the  view\r\n\r\nthe Member for Thomson was putting forward. If he looks\r\n\r\nat  section 16 of the Ordinance, it is quite clear that\r\n\r\nthese  procedures must be followed only when there  are\r\n\r\nrequests  for  a proposal with regard to  a  collective\r\n\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the Minister for Health and Law is in\r\n\r\nthe habit of getting excited very quickly, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\nI must state quite clearly that nobody is against using\r\n\r\nthe   Government  conciliation  machinery.  Nobody   is\r\n\r\nagainst going through the procedures laid down  in  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Ordinance.  If  there  have  been\r\n\r\ncases where notices for collective agreements were  not\r\n\r\nsent under section 16 of the Ordinance, there have been\r\n\r\ngood reasons. As far as I know, and I am advised so  by\r\n\r\nlegal  men,  whether at the moment a notice  is  served\r\n\r\nunder section 16 or not, the Minister, if he wants  to,\r\n\r\ncan  refer that dispute to arbitration, because he  has\r\n\r\nthe power. Now, we as reasonable men, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nexpect   the   Ministry  of  Labour  to  interfere   in\r\n\r\nindustrial  relaxations  only  to  seek  to   use   the\r\n\r\nconciliation  machinery when there is  a  deadlock,  or\r\n\r\nwhen  there  is no progress made between  employer  and\r\n\r\nemployee  and  where either the employer or  the  union\r\n\r\nrequests conciliation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Government's opinion of conciliation is quite\r\n\r\ndifferent, Mr Speaker. To the Government, conciliation\r\n\r\nmeans they just interfere wholesale, anyhow, and at any\r\n\r\ntime  they like. That, I say. Mr Speaker, Sir, is  not\r\n\r\ndesirable in industrial relations. Sir, it is one thing\r\n\r\nto  expect  the  Government  to  assist  in  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations by making its facilities available, but it is\r\n\r\nanother thing to tolerate the Government interfering in\r\n\r\nindustrial relations purely for the purpose  of  making\r\n\r\npolitical capital out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister was saying that only notice for a\r\n\r\ncollective agreement need be filed under section 16 and\r\n\r\nthe  other sections of the Ordinance. He also said that\r\n\r\na collective agreement would only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrefer  to matters like wages and conditions of service,\r\n\r\nand  so  on.  Sir, the Minister does not know  what  is\r\n\r\nhappening  in Singapore. Today there are many employers\r\n\r\nwho  refuse to negotiate with the unions on any  matter\r\n\r\nthat   comes   within  the  definition  of  \"industrial\r\n\r\nmatters\" as provided in the Ordinance, unless a  notice\r\n\r\nis  served under section 16. All that the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLaw  has  to do is to consult his Conciliation Officers\r\n\r\nin  the  Ministry of Labour to know the truth  of  this\r\n\r\nstatement.  Today, an employer can refuse to  negotiate\r\n\r\nwith a union on a dismissal case if the request to open\r\n\r\nnegotiations  on that case is not filed  under  section\r\n\r\n16. And if the Minister does not know this, then he  is\r\n\r\nnot  aware  of  what  is happening in  the  industrial\r\n\r\nworld.  There  is no use seeking to provide  amendments\r\n\r\nthat will render the position impracticable. And I say,\r\n\r\nSir, quite honestly that the new section that they  are\r\n\r\nproposing - section 27A - and this clause 7  will  simply\r\n\r\nmean  that the Government have a free hand to interfere\r\n\r\nin  industrial relations. That is exactly what we  seek\r\n\r\nto  oppose. But this, again I repeat it, does not  mean\r\n\r\nthat  we do not want to use the Government conciliation\r\n\r\nmachinery.  The  Minister knows that  if  he  asks  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour to compile statistics to show which\r\n\r\nunions have sent in the most number of disputes to  the\r\n\r\nconciliation machinery, the answer will be unions  that\r\n\r\nthey call Communist front organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if our intention is not to use the Ministry of\r\n\r\nLabour - and  we do not have to go there - then what  more,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  have  had a situation where the  majority  of\r\n\r\ncollective agreements drawn up in Singapore  have  been\r\n\r\ndrawn  up  outside the Ministry of Labour. I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will not stand up and say again that  we  are\r\n\r\nagainst  the use of the conciliation machinery  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour, that we do not want to file notices\r\n\r\nunder  section 16 of the Ordinance, and that we do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to use the provisions in the Industrial Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance to carry on our negotiations. As I said,  the\r\n\r\nposition  is  such that today there are many  employers\r\n\r\nwho  refuse  to negotiate on any matter if notices  are\r\n\r\nnot filed under section 16 of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\njust  now  referred to the Shaw case. He said that  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour took unprecedented action in asking\r\n\r\nthe  workers  to  meet  him  in  connection  with  that\r\n\r\ndispute.  Mr Speaker, Sir, he has also said  that  the\r\n\r\nposition today is this: that employers refuse to  treat\r\n\r\nwith  the unions unless they follow the procedures  set\r\n\r\nout  in this Ordinance. Mr Speaker, Sir, there is  all\r\n\r\nthe  more  reason therefore why there  should  be  this\r\n\r\npower  vested in the Minister. He should have the power\r\n\r\nto send for the parties if they cannot reach agreement.\r\n\r\nThere   is  nothing  to  prevent  both  sides   getting\r\n\r\ntogether, following these procedures outside the Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry  and entering into agreements and then  taking\r\n\r\ntheir  agreements and getting them registered with  the\r\n\r\nRegistry  of  the  Industrial  Arbitration  Court.   We\r\n\r\nwelcome  that. There will be no trouble for the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry  and both sides can get together,  make  their\r\n\r\nagreements and register them. It is only when there  is\r\n\r\na breakdown in negotiations, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the\r\n\r\nprocedures for conciliation available to both sides  in\r\n\r\nthe  Labour  Ministry  must be resorted  to.  And  that\r\n\r\nprocedure is indicated in this Part of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this section 21 and these\r\n\r\nprocedures  were  agreed with the Ten  Tall  Men.  They\r\n\r\nwanted  it to be so. They wanted the Minister  to  have\r\n\r\nthese  powers. They mentioned to us, at the  time  when\r\n\r\nthis  Bill was drafted, that they were in an impossible\r\n\r\nposition  unless  the  Minister and  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  were vested with the power. They might  make\r\n\r\napproaches  to an employer for a collective  agreement,\r\n\r\nbut he tells them, \"Go and play.\" And it is because  of\r\n\r\ntheir  representations that these powers were given  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister. Now they say the Minister is  trying  to\r\n\r\nforce  his  will on them, that he is trying  to  compel\r\n\r\nthem  to  follow collective bargaining procedures.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, all this is laid down in the  Bill.  Why\r\n\r\ndoes  he  make such a lot of fuss about it?  I  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand him at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> That is what you propose to do.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That clause 8 stand\r\n\r\npart of the Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 8 deals with\r\n\r\nsection  23  of  the principal Ordinance.  One  of  the\r\n\r\namendments  there, Mr Speaker, Sir, is  that  wherever\r\n\r\nthe  word  \"President\" occurs, to substitute  the  word\r\n\r\n\"Court\". As we know, Mr Speaker, the Court consists of\r\n\r\nthe  President, or the Deputy President as the case may\r\n\r\nbe,  and two members from the panel. When one reads the\r\n\r\namended clause, one gets the impression that it will go\r\n\r\nto a Court of three. If you will be good enough to turn\r\n\r\nto page 5 of the Bill, under clause 14:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subsection (1) of section 55 of the principal\r\n\r\nOrdinance  is  hereby amended by inserting  immediately\r\n\r\nafter  the word \"sections\" appearing in the first  line\r\n\r\nthereof the expression \"23,\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Reading  in  that  intended amendment to  the  existing\r\n\r\nsection  55,  the  amended  section  55  will  read  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The powers of the Court under sections 23, 52, 53\r\n\r\nand  54  of this Ordinance shall be exercisable by  the\r\n\r\nCourt constituted by the President alone.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  the  result of these two amendments - which,  as  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  you  give  with  one  hand  and  take  with  the\r\n\r\nother - really  leaves  in  effect  the  amended  section\r\n\r\n23 - there  is the word \"President\" - exactly the  same  as\r\n\r\nsection  23 is today. Although the amended clause  that\r\n\r\nis  agreed to will read \"Court\", yet the President will\r\n\r\nexercise the power of the Court on his own as he is, in\r\n\r\nfact,  now doing under statutory authority.  I  see  no\r\n\r\npoint  in  making such a song and dance about  altering\r\n\r\nthe   word   from   \"President\"  to  \"Court\"   when   a\r\n\r\ncorresponding amendment is made to the existing section\r\n\r\n55. That is the first point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is on the amendment \"may be a person\r\n\r\ndesignated  in  the agreement or\" with which  I  am  in\r\n\r\nentire agreement with the Government. This gets us away\r\n\r\nfrom  the present position where the employer  and  the\r\n\r\nemployee  may  appoint  the  President  or  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPresident  of  the  Court, which  I  think   is   very\r\n\r\ndesirable.      I      welcome     that      amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, perhaps it might be convenient if I\r\n\r\ndeal  with  clause 12 at this stage because what  I  am\r\n\r\ngoing  to  raise on this clause would impinge on  that.\r\n\r\nClause  12, Mr Speaker, Sir, gives the right of appeal\r\n\r\nfrom the decision of the referee to the Court, and  the\r\n\r\ndecision of the Court on such appeal shall be final and\r\n\r\nconclusive.  I  welcome that portion of  the  amendment\r\n\r\nwhich allows an appeal from a referee to the Court  and\r\n\r\nan  appeal  from a referee to the Court  in  that  case\r\n\r\nwould  be to a Court of three persons. That is  a  good\r\n\r\nprovision. I accept that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if one looks at section 39, it refers to awards\r\n\r\nand   referees  under  an  Award;  whereas  a   referee\r\n\r\nappointed  under  an  agreement  is  dealt  with  under\r\n\r\nsection  23. Then the new subsection (3) to section  39\r\n\r\nreads- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`An appeal shall lie from the decision of the referee\r\n\r\nto  the  Court  and the decision of the Court  on  such\r\n\r\nappeal shall be final and conclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>On  my reading of the Bill as it stands, it appears  to\r\n\r\nme,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that the Government intends  an\r\n\r\nappeal  both  from a referee under an agreement  and  a\r\n\r\nreferee under an award, that is, the Government intends\r\n\r\nthat  there should be appeals in respect of both  those\r\n\r\nreferees.  In  the form the amendments  have  been  put\r\n\r\nforward to the Assembly, it would appear that there  is\r\n\r\nonly  a  right of appeal from the decision of a referee\r\n\r\nunder  an  award  by  virtue  of  section  29,  because\r\n\r\nprovision for an appeal, which is subsection (3)  under\r\n\r\nclause  12, does not apply to an appeal from a  referee\r\n\r\nunder an agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Why?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is because this section, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nonly  deals with a referee under an award. I think  the\r\n\r\nMinister also said that the Court may, upon application\r\n\r\nmade  by  a trade union or a person bound by an  award,\r\n\r\ngive  an  interpretation of an award. I cannot see  any\r\n\r\nclause, if  I  could be enlightened on  this.  If  the\r\n\r\nMinister  can  point to any clause  which  makes  it  a\r\n\r\nstatutory right for an appeal from a referee  under  an\r\n\r\nagreement, I should be quite content to sit down. But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  the  Ordinance now stands, with the amendments,  it\r\n\r\nseems to me that there is --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Section 24 - \"Collective agreement deemed to\r\n\r\nbe an award.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes.

I was going to mention that so  far  as\r\n\r\nthe new sub-clause (5) , which would go in as subsection\r\n\r\n5 to section 5 is concerned, I have no comment on that,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker. I welcome that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  referred to the amendment to section  23  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  which substitutes the word \"Court\"  for  the\r\n\r\nword \"President\". Mr Speaker, I have already explained\r\n\r\nin  the Second Reading speech that the purpose of  this\r\n\r\namendment is to emphasise that the act of certification\r\n\r\nis  the  act of the Court and not only the act  of  the\r\n\r\nPresident,  and  to equate the status of  a  collective\r\n\r\nagreement  to  that of an award. It  will  also  enable\r\n\r\nproceedings  to  be  taken to punish  persons  who  are\r\n\r\nguilty  of  offences  against the  Court  for  contempt\r\n\r\nagainst  the Court. Mr Speaker, Sir, there  have  been\r\n\r\ncases  where the President has in open Court  certified\r\n\r\nagreements. In those cases, there have been attacks  on\r\n\r\nhis authority. If there was not this amendment it could\r\n\r\nbe  held  that when certifying agreements  he  was  not\r\n\r\nsitting as a Court, and to enable such contempts to  be\r\n\r\npunishable, Mr Speaker, Sir, it would be necessary for\r\n\r\nthis amendment to be made to section 23.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point, Mr Speaker, Sir, that is, the\r\n\r\nquestion  of an appeal lying from the decision  of  the\r\n\r\nreferee  to  the  Court, this is provided  for  by  the\r\n\r\namendment to section 39 of the Ordinance. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, a collective agreement which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  registered is in law the same as an award  made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Court. This amendment would allow an appeal to lie\r\n\r\nto   the  Court  in  respect  both  of  the  collective\r\n\r\nagreement which is registered and which is an award  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  in respect of an award which is made  by  the\r\n\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> With respect to the Minister, I still\r\n\r\ncannot  see  it. My point is this. Unless the  Minister\r\n\r\nacts  under  clause 37, which brings it within  section\r\n\r\n24,  it  is only then that it would be deemed an  award\r\n\r\nfor the purposes of this Ordinance. Under section 24:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A collective agreement, a memorandum of which has\r\n\r\nbeen  certified by the President [in this case it would\r\n\r\nbe  the  Court]  shall, as between the parties  to  the\r\n\r\nagreement  or  any  successor to, or  any  assignee  or\r\n\r\ntransmittee  of, the business of a party  bound  by  an\r\n\r\nagreement, including any corporation which has acquired\r\n\r\nor  taken  over the business of such a party,  and  any\r\n\r\npersons or trade unions upon whom it is declared to  be\r\n\r\nbinding by order made by the Minister under section  37\r\n\r\nof  this  Ordinance, he deemed to be an award  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes of this Ordinance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  it  appears to me that it can only become an  award\r\n\r\nfor  certain purposes of the Ordinance if the  Minister\r\n\r\nacts  under section 37. There seems to be a hiatus.  If\r\n\r\nsection 23 had said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The memorandum when certified by the Registrar shalt\r\n\r\nbe  deposited with and registered by the Registrar  and\r\n\r\nshall  have  for  the  purposes of this  Ordinance  the\r\n\r\neffect of an award.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>or  something  like that, then there  would  have  been\r\n\r\nabsolutely  no  difficulty, and all doubts  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen cleared. But the scheme under which this Ordinance\r\n\r\nhas  been drafted seems to proceed on the basis that  a\r\n\r\ncollective agreement will remain a collective agreement\r\n\r\nas  opposed  to an award given by the Court  until  the\r\n\r\nMinister  acts  under section 37 of this  Ordinance  by\r\n\r\nvirtue  of  the  provisions of section  24.  I  may  be\r\n\r\nmistaken.  I  stand  subject to correction.  I  am  not\r\n\r\ntrying to be difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member look at section 24 and\r\n\r\nstop  at  \"agreement\" in lines 4 and 5,  and  skip  the\r\n\r\nphrase  starting  with  \"including\"  and  ending   with\r\n\r\n\"Ordinance\" - four lines down below that, and then  carry\r\n\r\non, \"be deemed to be an award\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Omit from \"including\" up to \"Ordinance\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The words \"including any corporation\"\r\n\r\nup to \"Ordinance\" are just explanatory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> My point is this.

It has been the contention up till now that in\r\n\r\ncertain circumstances and under certain conditions,  it\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  a  violation of the  provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Ordinance if a solicitor acted  on\r\n\r\nbehalf either of a trade union of employees or a  trade\r\n\r\nunion  of  employers. That is accepted. Now,  does  the\r\n\r\ndeletion of the phrase \"under this Ordinance\" mean that\r\n\r\nunder  no circumstances should a solicitor in  any  way\r\n\r\nadvise or help either party when there is a dispute  as\r\n\r\nbetween an employer and an employee? I ask the Minister\r\n\r\nthis  question,  Sir, because I think it  is  important\r\n\r\nfrom  the point of view of the Bar. The Bar should know\r\n\r\nexactly  what the position is, because any interference\r\n\r\nwith  the  provisions  of  section  25  results  in  an\r\n\r\noffence. I do not think we want members of the  Bar  to\r\n\r\ncommit an offence unwittingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker.

But they said  to\r\n\r\nme, Mr Speaker, that they would be happy to come in if\r\n\r\nthey  were  invited by the Minister to do so.  That  is\r\n\r\nprovided  for  by the amendment that has been  made  to\r\n\r\nsection 31 of the Ordinance, where it is provided  now,\r\n\r\nas  amended, that the Minister may, where he  considers\r\n\r\nit  possible that any trade dispute may be  settled  by\r\n\r\nconciliation or further conciliation, direct a  person,\r\n\r\nwhether  engaged in or connected with the trade dispute\r\n\r\nor  not,  to attend at the time and place specified  in\r\n\r\nthe  direction  at a conference presided  over  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  or such person as the Minister directs.  They\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the parties would get together  and  follow\r\n\r\nthese  procedures.  If there are  deadlocks,  then  the\r\n\r\nmatter is referred to the Minister, and if the Minister\r\n\r\nthinks  that  it  is necessary to compel  a  compulsory\r\n\r\nconference,  then they can be invited to  attend.

And  negotiations   under   this\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, start with  section  16,\r\n\r\nwhen  a formal notice is served on an employer, or  the\r\n\r\nemployer  serves the notice, and there is an acceptance\r\n\r\nunder  section 17. When that happens, then negotiations\r\n\r\nbegin  under  this Ordinance. Any period prior  to  the\r\n\r\nservice   of   notice  is  negotiations   outside   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  I understood the Minister to  say  that  he\r\n\r\nwould  be  very  happy  and would welcome  negotiations\r\n\r\noutside  the Ordinance when the two parties can  really\r\n\r\nget  together in a friendly spirit and bring  about  an\r\n\r\nagreement which they can present to the Court and  have\r\n\r\nit   registered.

The  Minister   has\r\n\r\nconveniently suggested that industrial matters may only\r\n\r\nbe  matters  that may end up in collective  agreements,\r\n\r\nbut  if  we  look  at  the  definition  of  \"industrial\r\n\r\nmatters\", we will notice that everything under the  sun\r\n\r\nthat  goes  on  between an employer and  the  employees\r\n\r\ncomes within the definition as stated in the Ordinance.\r\n\r\nIt  should simply mean, Mr Speaker, Sir, any person or\r\n\r\nunion  which enters into discussion on any matter  that\r\n\r\nis  defined here as \"industrial matters\", or any matter\r\n\r\nthat  affects the employee in his employment.

I am fully aware of  that.\r\n\r\nBut the Minister will also agree that if one gives to a\r\n\r\nCourt  unlimited powers - as indeed this  Court  has,\r\n\r\nfor  has  not the Minister himself said that the  Court\r\n\r\ncan act in equity and good conscience - and, as a result\r\n\r\nthereof,  the  Court  can over-ride  existing  law  and\r\n\r\nsubstitute  therefor its notions  of  equity  and  good\r\n\r\nconscience, then, in these circumstances, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the Industrial Court would be more powerful  than\r\n\r\nGod himself for where God himself could be bound by his\r\n\r\nown decisions, the Industrial Court would only be bound\r\n\r\nby its notions of equity and good conscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, such power could be abused, wittingly or\r\n\r\nunwittingly.  I am not saying that there should  be  an\r\n\r\nappeal  from his decision on points of fact, but  there\r\n\r\nmay  be points of law involved, particularly when  the\r\n\r\nPresident of the Court is not being assisted by a legal\r\n\r\nman, on which he could go wrong. What then could be the\r\n\r\nharm if the provision for appeal is inserted in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill?  In  order that there might not be any  abuse  of\r\n\r\nthat right to appeal, the State Advocate-General should\r\n\r\ncertify that there is a point of law on which an appeal\r\n\r\ncould be moved. The Minister himself has recognised the\r\n\r\ndifficulty.  There  do arise points  of  law  in  these\r\n\r\ncourts  and  those points of law, under the  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nthe  President is entitled to go to the State Advocate-General  for  advice. The State Advocate-General  gives\r\n\r\nit,  which,  in effect, means that the Government  does\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  points  of  law  do  arise,  even   in\r\n\r\nindustrial  disputes. All I am asking the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nsay is whether the Government will consider, either now\r\n\r\nin  this  Bill or at some future time, the question  of\r\n\r\nenabling  any  litigant to appeal from  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Court to a Court of Law in the  country  on\r\n\r\npoints  of law. In order to prevent frivolous  appeals,\r\n\r\nthe  State Advocate-General as I have indicated  should\r\n\r\ncertify. In England in respect of certain appeals there\r\n\r\nare   provisions  whereby  the  Attorney-General   does\r\n\r\ncertify  and where a point of law is involved the  case\r\n\r\ngoes  to a higher tribunal. Similarly, here, the  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General could be given power to certify that a\r\n\r\ngenuine  point of law does exist and on this  point  of\r\n\r\nlaw there could be an appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, I would like to add my voice to\r\n\r\nthat  of  the Member for Farrer Park with reference  to\r\n\r\nthis most unusual provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is necessary to give power, but absolute\r\n\r\npower  it  is  never  necessary to give;  and  to  give\r\n\r\nabsolute  power, Sir, is to risk a tyranny.

Sir, I  would  draw\r\n\r\nyour attention to the possibility, for example, of  the\r\n\r\nPresident  refusing  to certify  an  agreement  for  no\r\n\r\nreason at all. He does not like one of the parties:  he\r\n\r\nwill not certify it. There is no power for an order  of\r\n\r\nmandamus  to  direct him to do his duty.

You cannot appeal, except\r\n\r\non  points of law, because the Commissioner himself and\r\n\r\nthe  Board  that  settles the disputes  are  themselves\r\n\r\nexperts in matters of assessing facts and the court  is\r\n\r\nshut  out  from  examining the facts, which  they  must\r\n\r\naccept.  But to shut out the court, Sir, from  deciding\r\n\r\non  points  of law is to create an island  of  tyranny,\r\n\r\nhowever good the intention. I do urge upon the Minister\r\n\r\nto  recognise that it is for the welfare of the courts,\r\n\r\nfor  the  health  of  the courts, as  well  as  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry, that there should be provision permitting  an\r\n\r\nappeal  on  a  point of law, not in fact making  doubly\r\n\r\nworse  the  existing  section  but  improving  it,   by\r\n\r\nintroducing provision whereby an appeal on a  point  of\r\n\r\nlaw exclusively could go to the High Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I should like to have an indication of\r\n\r\nwhat  particular  orders of the  court  should  be  the\r\n\r\nsubject  of  an appeal. One matter that the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson referred to was the question of an appeal from an\r\n\r\norder punishing a contempt. Mr Speaker, Sir, the other\r\n\r\nsuggestion of the Member for Anson just now was that if\r\n\r\nthe  President refused to certify an agreement  for  no\r\n\r\napparent  reason, then there was no appeal. But  surely\r\n\r\nthat is an absurd suggestion, Mr Speaker, Sir, If  the\r\n\r\nPresident ever did that, there was the power to  revoke\r\n\r\nhis appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in the case of the only matter which the Bar\r\n\r\nCommittee   thought  could  be  the   subject   of   an\r\n\r\nappeal - that is a punishment for contempt - no such  case\r\n\r\nhas yet arisen. So I suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, that we\r\n\r\nwait  for  another year - let this Ordinance continue  to\r\n\r\noperate - till  we  receive  a further  report  from  the\r\n\r\nPresident - and there will be now another Court, a second\r\n\r\nCourt,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere will be a report that we will be receiving from the Deputy \r\n\r\nPresident also - and when we recieve their reports, we can consider\r\n\r\nwhat sort of appeals we should allow from the decisions of this court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.49 pm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That clause 13 stand part of the Bill:\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Division, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee divided: Ayes, 22; Noes, 17 Abstentions, 3;\r\n\r\nAbsent, 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAyes.

They cannot expect to hide  the\r\n\r\ncarcass  of  an  elephant by covering  it  up  with  a\r\n\r\nwinnowing  pan,  as the proverb says.  Some  of  their\r\n\r\narguments  were  based on terms  such  as  a  sell-out\r\n\r\nmerger,  and  so  on, which I think  will  not  be  expressed by people who are normal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is clear now, without my having\r\n\r\nto  do  it,  they  have exposed themselves  and  their\r\n\r\ndesigns.  The  Member for Queenstown stated  yesterday\r\n\r\nthat  before the Anson by-election the people had  not\r\n\r\nexpressed their desire to merge with the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya. They thought that that would strengthen  their\r\n\r\nargument  that  Singapore is not yet ripe  for  merger\r\n\r\nwith  the Federation of Malaya. If at all, this is  in\r\n\r\nline  with the designs of the Communists who hope that\r\n\r\ntheir  Party will control the whole of Malaya at which\r\n\r\ntime  they  expect  to  do as  they  please  with  the\r\n\r\nConstitution of the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it true to say that the P.A.P. have no mandate to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  merger, as was alleged by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply, permit me to ask them to open their minds\r\n\r\nwide  and  to try to recall their pledges  before  the\r\n\r\n1959  elections were held.

On page 4, it says:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our Party opposes the new constitutions to be\r\n\r\ninaugurated  in  the Federation and Singapore  because\r\n\r\nthey   still   retain  the  essential   features   of\r\n\r\ncolonialism.  We shall use every constitutional  means\r\n\r\nto   get  a  constitution  for  an  independent   and\r\n\r\ndemocratic  State, one which recognises the  unity  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the Federation and  which  places  the\r\n\r\nultimate control over the affairs of this country  in\r\n\r\nthe hands of a Government elected by its nationals and\r\n\r\nresponsible only to them.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objectives of Petir to bring about merger with\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya came to life at the inaugural\r\n\r\nmeeting of the P.A.P. in 1954. Then in 1958, after the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya achieved its independence,  the\r\n\r\nExecutive  Committee of the P.A.P. issued  its  Fourth\r\n\r\nSouvenir  which was passed by the General Meeting  as\r\n\r\nthe  basis of its future policy. This is my answer  to\r\n\r\nthe  Member's  allegation. I  shall  read  the  Malay\r\n\r\nversion on page 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) to end colonialism and establish an\r\n\r\nindependent national State of Malaya,  comprising\r\n\r\nthe  territories now known as the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  and the Colony of Singapore; to create  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic and united Government of Malaya (here,\r\n\r\nit  includes Singapore] based on universal  adult\r\n\r\nsuffrage  of all those who are born in Malaya  or\r\n\r\nwho have adopted Malayan nationality.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is our basic policy that\r\n\r\nis upheld by every loyal member of the P.A.P. and\r\n\r\nit is our duty to carry it out in the interest of\r\n\r\nour people. When the elections came in 1959, as I\r\n\r\nsaid yesterday, the P.A.P. had placed foremost in\r\n\r\nits  manifesto the fact of wanting to strive  for\r\n\r\nindependence  through merger with the  Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya.  With these basic policies  and  with\r\n\r\nwhat  is contained in this manifesto, we went  to\r\n\r\nthe  people in 1959 and it was by virtue of  this\r\n\r\nmanifesto that we were duly elected by the people\r\n\r\nby  a  big majority and returned to this Assembly\r\n\r\nwith a total vote of about 54 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if the S.P.A. and U.M.N.O., who have obtained a few seats, claim that in their manifesto they have merger as a platform, it will\r\n\r\nbe  true,  therefore, that those people who  want\r\n\r\nmerger number more than 54 per cent and therefore\r\n\r\nit  is  logical to assume that they expect  their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  to fight for merger.  With  this\r\n\r\nvictory, Mr Speaker, Sir, would anyone  say  now\r\n\r\nthat we have no mandate to bring about merger, as\r\n\r\nwas  alleged we did not have, as we heard in this\r\n\r\nAssembly yesterday? Have they forgotten this fact\r\n\r\nor  have  they not read the Anniversary Souvenir?\r\n\r\nThey  should not continue to remain in this House\r\n\r\nbecause  they  were elected in the  name  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. who  promised to fight  for  merger,  but\r\n\r\nthese  people have since run away from the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nWherein lies the value of their self-respect, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir?  And this becomes a challenge  and\r\n\r\nstrengthens   our  firm  desire  to   fight   for\r\n\r\nindependence  through merger with the  Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya. I feel, Mr Speaker, that  there  are\r\n\r\nmany  tainted  Reds who accuse us  of  having  no\r\n\r\nmandate  from the people. This is only  to  wreck\r\n\r\nour  efforts. Mr Speaker, Sir, I have known them\r\n\r\nlong in the field of politics since October 1954;\r\n\r\nso  I  know their tactics well. When these people\r\n\r\nwish\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  besmirch their opponents, they will find ways\r\n\r\nand  means to do so - whether it is right or wrong.\r\n\r\nSo I say they cannot stand being stared at in the\r\n\r\nface.  The  objective  of  achieving  merger  was\r\n\r\nregarded  as a long-term objective. But according\r\n\r\nto   what   the   Member  for  Queenstown   said\r\n\r\nyesterday, in the speeches of the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara,  no  mention  was  made  of  merger.  The\r\n\r\nchanges that will take place and are taking place\r\n\r\nin  the  political arena are not something  which\r\n\r\nanybody can foretell. Merger will soon be a fact.\r\n\r\nThe   Member   for  Queenstown,  in  moving   his\r\n\r\namendment,  stated that this House resolves  that\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore be asked to express their\r\n\r\nwishes on the inevitable reunification of the two\r\n\r\nterritories.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  this  sentence\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the subject of the Member's  amendment\r\n\r\nclearly  shows  his acceptance of the  fact  that\r\n\r\nreunification   is  inevitable.  Therefore,   our\r\n\r\nsociety   is  confused.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   if\r\n\r\nreunification  is inevitable, the  question  then\r\n\r\narises:  what is the mode and manner of  bringing\r\n\r\nabout the reunification acceptable to our friends\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation?  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  in  all\r\n\r\nsincerity,  once again, I must express  my  great\r\n\r\nsurprise; if the Member for Queenstown  and  his\r\n\r\ncolleagues  are  sincere and are  truly  keen  to\r\n\r\nbring  about  the  reunification  of  these   two\r\n\r\nterritories,  they  will surely  not  attempt  to\r\n\r\nbring  about  this amendment. It is because  this\r\n\r\namendment  will definitely be defeated that  they\r\n\r\nhave  tabled other amendments and other  motions.\r\n\r\nThis,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, is merely to  bait  the\r\n\r\nhook  in  order to fish in troubled waters.  From\r\n\r\nthis  it  becomes abundantly clear  who  are  the\r\n\r\npeople  who waver and shift their stand; and  who\r\n\r\nare  the  political adventurers who have  exerted\r\n\r\nevery  effort  to  bring about confusion  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  We  realise and recognise, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nthat our island State with its teeming population\r\n\r\ncomprises  various races of various cultures  and\r\n\r\nreligions.  With full earnestness and  sincerity,\r\n\r\nwe should bear in mind these facts. We must carry\r\n\r\nout  our  objective  in  the  true  interest  and\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  the people to bring about prosperity\r\n\r\nand  harmony.  Mr Speaker, Sir, in carrying  out\r\n\r\nits  objective, the Government is always firm  in\r\n\r\nits   stand.  The  Government  has  carried   out\r\n\r\nnegotiations   with   the   Government   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaya  to get a suitable basis which will not  be\r\n\r\ndetrimental  to  any  Party  and  which  will   be\r\n\r\nacceptable to the majority of the people  in  both\r\n\r\nterritories - fully respecting our  own  rights  and\r\n\r\nprivileges. As a result of that, Command Paper No.\r\n\r\n33 came into being. Mr Speaker, all these efforts\r\n\r\nhave  gone on smoothly and successfully but a  few\r\n\r\npolitical adventurers have stepped forward to  try\r\n\r\nto  belittle these successes in order to wreck the\r\n\r\nmerger that is to come. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another problem faces us\r\n\r\nbecause everyone of us wants merger. The mode  and\r\n\r\nmanner  of bringing about merger is either as  has\r\n\r\nbeen spelt out in the White Paper Command No.  33;\r\n\r\nor  a complete and unconditional merger as a State\r\n\r\non  an equal basis with other eleven States; or is\r\n\r\nit to be that we are to enter Malaysia on terms no\r\n\r\nless  favourable  than the  terms  of  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories?  Do  they want to  reject  all  these\r\n\r\nthree   alternatives   and  place   Singapore   in\r\n\r\njeopardy?  I am truly confused, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nto see the stand of the Barisan Sosialis. As I see\r\n\r\nit, it is not the alternatives for bringing about\r\n\r\nmerger  that is the crux of the matter; it is  the\r\n\r\ndesire  to  wreck  merger itself.  Therefore,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  if merger is wrecked,  then  those\r\n\r\npeople  who  claim themselves to be  fighters  for\r\n\r\ndemocracy and fighters against colonialism are the\r\n\r\nreal  colonial stooges who wish to place Singapore\r\n\r\nunder  the  feet of the colonial power. This,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, is the true position regarding these\r\n\r\npeople.  They would like to appear as  sheep  when\r\n\r\nthey   are  actually  wolves.  I  would  like   to\r\n\r\nreiterate  that we will fight colonialism  whether\r\n\r\nit be from the West or from the East.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, because of this, in the name\r\n\r\nof our sacred fight in the interests of the people\r\n\r\nin this State of ours, and in the interests of the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  our future generations, I would  urge\r\n\r\nupon  Members of this Assembly to heed this  call:\r\n\r\nif  you have gone astray, if you have gone off the\r\n\r\npath,  pray do come back to the main road. At  the\r\n\r\nsame time, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to sound\r\n\r\na  word of warning. If we are true representatives\r\n\r\nof  the people, fighting for the interests of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  let  us prove our sincerity. I  reiterate\r\n\r\nonce more, Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  if we have taken a wrong  step  as\r\n\r\nindividuals, the danger that may befall  us  would\r\n\r\nonly  affect  our own family, but  if  we  make  a\r\n\r\nserious  mistake as political leaders  responsible\r\n\r\nto  the  people,  then  the  danger  is  that  the\r\n\r\nconsequences will be suffered by the people  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.  And great suffering will be borne  by  the\r\n\r\ngenerations yet unborn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, to cut my speech\r\n\r\nshort, I say once again, if you have gone off  the\r\n\r\npath, do come back to the main road, but  if  you\r\n\r\nare  truly fighting for merger, let us have  proof\r\n\r\nof it. We should in all our efforts be sincere and\r\n\r\nnot  act  like  the proverbial crab in  the  Malay\r\n\r\nsaying,  which asks its baby crab to walk straight\r\n\r\nahead  while  she, the mother crab herself,  walks\r\n\r\nsideways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen  we were debating the Referendum Bill we  did\r\n\r\nsay   that  the  P.A.P. was  going  to  pose  two\r\n\r\nunacceptable questions to the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nto  choose.  What we said before  has  now  become\r\n\r\ntrue.  It  is a tragedy for the P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nwho, having known that the people do not want them\r\n\r\nanymore,  are  now trying to sell  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  the  Federation  of  Malaya,  first\r\n\r\nconditionally, then unconditionally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also a tragedy for our people to have\r\n\r\nsuch  an  irresponsible Government who  now  force\r\n\r\nthem to accept two unacceptable types of merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper on merger of the P.A.P. was\r\n\r\ndebated  in  this House. Since it was debated  and\r\n\r\napproved  in  this  House, it is  only  right  and\r\n\r\nproper for the P.A.P. Government to ask the people\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not  they accept the White  Paper  on\r\n\r\nmerger proposed by the P.A.P. but approved in this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  It is only by this that the  democratic\r\n\r\nright of the people can be exercised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people and the Opposition will not blame the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   Government  for  its   undemocratic   and\r\n\r\nirresponsible attitude if it is prepared to  allow\r\n\r\nour  people  to  exercise their  basic  democratic\r\n\r\nright by giving them a chance to say \"Yes\" or \"No\"\r\n\r\nto the White Paper proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government not only do not allow our people\r\n\r\nto say \"Yes\" or \"No\" to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper on merger, but they  are  also  even\r\n\r\nprepared to pose another type of merger which is  even\r\n\r\nworse  than  the White Paper on merger  by  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can force the people to be trapped  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum plot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very irresponsible for the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment to ask the people to choose a complete  and\r\n\r\nunconditional merger as a state on an equal basis with\r\n\r\nthe   other   11   states  in  accordance   with   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional documents of the Federation of  Malaya.\r\n\r\nThis  question has not been discussed and  debated  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly. Therefore, it is not right and  it  is\r\n\r\nimproper  for the P.A.P. Government to bring  up  this\r\n\r\nquestion for our people to choose. Their aim is clear.\r\n\r\nThey  try to trap the people by forcing them to choose\r\n\r\nbetween  the  White Paper on merger and  unconditional\r\n\r\nmerger.  By  this way, they think they  can  trap  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis. But they have mistaken the fact that\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis is a political organisation.  It\r\n\r\ncan survive under any form of government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the interest of the people is above the interest\r\n\r\nof  any political Party. If the P.A.P. believe in this\r\n\r\nprinciple,   then  it  should  not   pose   two   such\r\n\r\nunacceptable questions for the people in order to trap\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis, because  they  also  trap  the\r\n\r\npeople  who will suffer most. So the people  will  not\r\n\r\nforget the treacherous act which the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nis now doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to warn the P.A.P.

Then  any political Party may  stand  up  and\r\n\r\nfight  for the abolition of the White Paper on merger,\r\n\r\nand  in  such a situation the people of Singapore  are\r\n\r\nsure  to  stand  behind  this  political  Party  which\r\n\r\nrepresents them.

Their simple\r\n\r\nlogic  is  this: To die is inevitable;  therefore  you\r\n\r\nmust  die by shooting yourself with a gun; or you must\r\n\r\ndie by hanging yourself with a rope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Political Secretary to the Prime Minister in\r\n\r\nhis  recent  radio  talk  on merger  did  mention  the\r\n\r\nreferendum in Newfoundland. He said that the people in\r\n\r\nNewfoundland,   when  deciding  their   constitutional\r\n\r\nchanges, were also not allowed to say \"Yes\" or \"No\" in\r\n\r\nthat referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he was telling a lie to the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nbecause the people there were actually given a  chance\r\n\r\nto  say  \"Yes\" or \"No\" in a different form.

This so-called  special\r\n\r\nprivilege   of  autonomy  in  labour  and   education,\r\n\r\nalthough  in  name is in the hands of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  in fact, is in the hands of the Government\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation, because the Government  machinery\r\n\r\nthat controls these two departments is in the hands of\r\n\r\nthe Federation Government. In other words, when merger\r\n\r\ntakes place conditionally or unconditionally and under\r\n\r\nany circumstances, the people of Singapore do not gain\r\n\r\nanything but they lose everything, including the basic\r\n\r\nrights of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We oppose the Prime Minister's motion firstly because\r\n\r\nthe  citizens of Singapore cannot automatically become\r\n\r\nthe  citizens of the Federation; secondly, because  we\r\n\r\ncannot have proportional representation in the Federal\r\n\r\nParliament;  and,  thirdly, because  the  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  cannot  enjoy  the  same  rights  as  those\r\n\r\nenjoyed by the people of Federation;  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand, fourthly, because the voters are  deprived\r\n\r\nof  the right to say \"Yes\" or \"No\" to the questions or\r\n\r\nquestion  posed to them.

Sir, I am not going to  waste\r\n\r\nthe  time of the House in rebutting his arguments, but\r\n\r\nI  want to take this motion before the House in a very\r\n\r\nserious  light  and  consider  certain  basic   issues\r\n\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is clear from what has been said in this\r\n\r\nAssembly  that  the  simple issue of  the  alternative\r\n\r\nmerger  proposal to be presented in the referendum  is\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  What  will happen  to  the  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore under the alternative form of merger?  These\r\n\r\nare  important matters and I want to discuss  them  at\r\n\r\nlength. I also want to discuss purely for the sake  of\r\n\r\nargument,  what happens to Singapore citizens  if  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  type  of merger with automatic conversion  is\r\n\r\nimplemented  by some miracle. But first, Sir,  let  me\r\n\r\ndeal  with  what  happens to Singapore citizens  after\r\n\r\nmerger  in  accordance with the White Paper proposals.\r\n\r\nThe  Barisan Sosialis keep on repeating the  falsehood\r\n\r\nthat   Singapore  citizens  will  become  second-class\r\n\r\ncitizens,  but  they  have never stated  in  what  way\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens will become second-class citizens.\r\n\r\nThey  have  not  given one concrete instance  of  what\r\n\r\nrights  and  privileges the Singapore  citizens  would\r\n\r\nlose  under  the  White  Paper  form  of  merger.   We\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  asked them to answer this  question.  Each\r\n\r\ntime  they  evaded the issue. I hope that during  this\r\n\r\ndebate  the  Barisan  Sosialis  Members  will  give  a\r\n\r\nstraightforward   answer   to   this   straightforward\r\n\r\nquestion.  I  say,  Sir,  that  it  is  an  outrageous\r\n\r\nfalsehood  to say that Singapore citizens will  become\r\n\r\nsecond-class citizens after merger in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe White Paper proposals.

There is  no  question  of\r\n\r\nsecond-class citizenship.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that was in November 1961 and on the 28th of\r\n\r\nJune,  1962, the Member for Anson reaffirmed his  view\r\n\r\nin this very Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I have not changed my view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I have never said he has changed\r\n\r\nhis  view,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I said he has reaffirmed\r\n\r\nhis  view.  Now  everybody knows  that  if,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens become second class citizens  under\r\n\r\nour merger proposals, then the Member for Anson, as  a\r\n\r\nlawyer,  will  be  able  to  find  real  solid   legal\r\n\r\narguments  to prove his point. The fact of the  matter\r\n\r\nis  that  he  has  not done so, nor  can  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  present any argument or evidence to  support\r\n\r\ntheir charge of second-class citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the truth of, the matter is that Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  retain all the rights that they now possess.\r\n\r\nIn  addition, they acquire new rights as nationals  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  Federation. Now, let me explain. A Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen now enjoys certain basic political rights.  He\r\n\r\nhas  a right of franchise, that is, he has a right  to\r\n\r\nchoose  who shall govern Singapore. He has a right  to\r\n\r\nstand for election, and as a citizen he enjoys certain\r\n\r\nreal   and   concrete  privileges  in  the  State   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. He is eligible to apply for low-rent houses\r\n\r\nbuilt  by the Government. His children enjoy the right\r\n\r\nto  free  primary education; and if they  are  clever,\r\n\r\nthey  can  get  free education right up to  university\r\n\r\nlevel.  As  a Singapore citizen he can hold office  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government, and there is a full range of  welfare\r\n\r\nservices  available to him. Sir, these are the  nights\r\n\r\nand  privileges  of a Singapore citizen  as  they  now\r\n\r\nstand. He loses none of these rights\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter  merger. Not only he retains these rights  after\r\n\r\nmerger according to the White Paper proposals, but  he\r\n\r\nacquires  new  ones.  He  has  a  right  to  vote  for\r\n\r\nrepresentatives to the Central Parliament.  He  has  a\r\n\r\nright to stand for election to the Central Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn  addition, he acquires the status of a national  of\r\n\r\nthe   new  Federation.  As  a  national  of  the   new\r\n\r\nFederation,  the  rights he enjoys are  equal  in  all\r\n\r\nrespects to those of the Federation citizens who  will\r\n\r\nalso  be nationals of the new Federation. These rights\r\n\r\nare   defined  in  various  Articles  of  the  Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution. The more important ones are Articles  8,\r\n\r\n9,  10,  47,  119  and 123. These deal  with  equality\r\n\r\nbefore  the  law,  freedom  of  movement,  freedom  of\r\n\r\nspeech, assembly and association, freedom of religion,\r\n\r\nqualifications    for   membership   of    Parliament,\r\n\r\nqualifications  of  electors  and  qualifications   of\r\n\r\njudges  before  the Supreme Court.   I  want  to  draw\r\n\r\nspecial attention to Article 8 (2) which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Except as expressly authorised by this Constitution,\r\n\r\nthere  shall be no discrimination against citizens  on\r\n\r\nthe ground only of religion, race, descent or place of\r\n\r\nbirth  in any law or in the appointment to any  office\r\n\r\nor  employment  under  a public authority  or  in  the\r\n\r\nadministration of any law relating to the acquisition,\r\n\r\nholding or disposition of property or the establishing\r\n\r\nor  carrying  on  of any trade, business,  profession,\r\n\r\nvocation or employment.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister said in the debate on merger\r\n\r\nlast  year,  the rights of a Singapore citizen  and  a\r\n\r\nMalayan  national will be incorporated in the  revised\r\n\r\nConstitution of the Federation, and this Article  will\r\n\r\nthen  guarantee him a status of complete equality with\r\n\r\nall   other  citizens.  The  only  difference  between\r\n\r\ncitizens  of the Federation and citizens of  Singapore\r\n\r\nis  that they will elect and be elected to the Central\r\n\r\nParliament in their respective territories.  Those  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation will vote in the Federation, and those\r\n\r\nin    Singapore    will   vote   in   Singapore    for\r\n\r\nrepresentatives to the Central Parliament.  Similarly,\r\n\r\nif they want to stand for election, they will do so in\r\n\r\ntheir  respective  territories.  These  are  the  only\r\n\r\ndifferences. There is no inequality here and therefore\r\n\r\nno  question  of second-class status under  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper merger proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now deal with what happens to Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  under  complete merger for  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nconstituent State of the Federation. First, I wish  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with the extraordinary claim made by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown last night that complete merger of the\r\n\r\nPenang or Malacca type has never been advanced by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis. He said, and I quote the transcript\r\n\r\nof yesterday's Assembly sitting at page 41 second last\r\n\r\nparagraph. [Vol. 19 No. 1, col. 62]. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Let me now expose why the P.A.P. have wanted to put in\r\n\r\nthis  so-called Penang type merger, why they  invented\r\n\r\nthis  Penang  type merger. There are two good  reasons\r\n\r\nfor  the  P.A.P. First, the P.A.P. want an  excuse  to\r\n\r\njustify  posing  two questions to the  people  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And then in page 42, second paragraph, second sentence\r\n\r\n[col. 63]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The P.A.P. object is to identify the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis with the unacceptable fictitious Penang  type\r\n\r\nmerger.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, I am amazed to learn that the P.A.P. invented the\r\n\r\nPenang type of merger. The Member for Queenstown  must\r\n\r\nhave suffered from a temporary mental blackout when he\r\n\r\nsaid  this,  for it was he who proposed this  form  of\r\n\r\nmerger in a letter from him to the Leader of the House\r\n\r\ndated  1st September, 1961. Now this letter  has  been\r\n\r\nquoted so often that I will not quote it again, but  I\r\n\r\nwill cite other evidence in corroboration. Sir, may  I\r\n\r\nread  from the Straits Times, 30th August. 1961,  page\r\n\r\n18,  part  of a long article on the Barisan  stand  on\r\n\r\nmerger?  And  this  is what the Barisan  stand  is  as\r\n\r\ndescribed in the Straits Times:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The way for real unification was in one of two\r\n\r\ndirections:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) an immediate, full and complete merger with\r\n\r\nSingapore   joining   the   Federation   as    a\r\n\r\nconstituent State like\r\n\r\nPenang or Malacca.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) an autonomous unit within a confederation with\r\n\r\nBorneo territories coming in when possible.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is clear, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Penang or\r\n\r\nMalacca type of merger was not invented by the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nWe  are  quoting statements straight from the  horse's\r\n\r\nmouth.  Now, if the Barisan Sosialis do not  like  the\r\n\r\nPenang  or Malacca type of merger as they now pretend,\r\n\r\nthen they can propose merger like any other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState.  Even if we regard Penang and Malacca as merely\r\n\r\nbeing offered as illustrations, the fact remains  that\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis have come out fully in favour  of\r\n\r\nfull and complete merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just to make sure that we the P.A.P. will not be\r\n\r\naccused  in  future  of inventing  further  fictitious\r\n\r\ntypes  of complete merger, may I be permitted to quote\r\n\r\nseveral  statements  of Barisan  leaders  which  prove\r\n\r\nbeyond all doubt that they wanted complete merger with\r\n\r\nthe   Federation?  My  first  quotation  is  from  the\r\n\r\ntypescript  of  the  famous radio forum  on  the  21st\r\n\r\nSeptember, and I quote from page six of the typescript\r\n\r\nwith   the  Member  for  Queenstown  saying  in   very\r\n\r\nforthright terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We come out with our stand, straightforward, one and\r\n\r\nall  the time the same, namely, that we are asking for\r\n\r\nfull   complete  merger  with  the  Federation,   with\r\n\r\nSingapore  coming  in  as the  twelfth  State  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation. Only in that way can you call it merger.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  Sir,  in  a  letter to our Party  Chairman,  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister, dated the 11th September. 1961,\r\n\r\nthe Member for Queenstown said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We note with some satisfaction that following the\r\n\r\nproposal  for  the constitutional future,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  has shifted its stand and is now  prepared\r\n\r\nto  put  forward complete merger as an alternative  to\r\n\r\nits own proposal.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, they say that they are very satisfied that we are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  put forward an alternative  of  complete\r\n\r\nmerger.  So why all this fuss and bother when  we  are\r\n\r\ndoing so now? Again, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  in Hansard of 20th November, 1961,  column\r\n\r\n314, said in this Assembly:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, we have already stated in the most unequivocal\r\n\r\nterms  that we are fully prepared to accept a complete\r\n\r\nmerger,  and we will only be too glad to say \"yes\"  if\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku says tomorrow that we should have  complete\r\n\r\nmerger.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  Sir,  lest  it be thought that  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown was speaking out of turn - and one must admit\r\n\r\nthat  he  does that very frequently - I will quote  what\r\n\r\nthe real Party boss said on this subject. I will quote\r\n\r\nMr Lim Ching Siong in the Straits Times dated 18th\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1961, on his Party stand on merger. Mr Lim\r\n\r\nwas quoted as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Lim said that recently critics had described the\r\n\r\nPanty  as anti-merger and as being prepared to  accept\r\n\r\nmerger only as an alternative.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now, he asked the question:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`How can anyone who likes only half-boiled potatoes\r\n\r\naccuse  those who like boiled potatoes of being people\r\n\r\nwho  do  not like potatoes? We are serious and genuine\r\n\r\nin  our  stand  for full and complete merger.  If  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government says tomorrow  that  they  will\r\n\r\naccept  us  as an integral part of the Federation,  we\r\n\r\nwill only be too glad to support it whole-heartedly.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  now,  Sir,  when  we  offer  them  fully  boiled\r\n\r\npotatoes,  they  say  they never wanted  it  and  they\r\n\r\nwanted  something else. No, obviously they are  up  to\r\n\r\nsome  game.  What is this game, Mr Speaker,  Sir?  To\r\n\r\nunderstand  this, let us examine what the words  \"full\r\n\r\nand  complete merger\" mean. The Member for  Anson  has\r\n\r\nadded another adjective \"unconditional\" merger to make\r\n\r\nthe meaning even clearer. Therefore, when you talk  of\r\n\r\nfull  and  complete  and  unconditional  merger  as  a\r\n\r\nconstituent State of the Federation, you  join  in  on\r\n\r\nthe  same  terms enjoyed by any of the present  eleven\r\n\r\nStates.  Sir,  you can ask for more. The Barisan  have\r\n\r\nasked  for  more. The Workers' Party  have  asked  for\r\n\r\nmore. But if these terms are rejected, then it is  not\r\n\r\nopen  to  them to grumble and say that they have  been\r\n\r\ndeprived of anything to which they were entitled. This\r\n\r\nis  a  proposition  which is self-evident  even  to  a\r\n\r\nschoolboy. Now, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis having come\r\n\r\nout   with  this  clear  and  unambiguous  demand  for\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger  discovered  that  they  had  made  a\r\n\r\nserious   mistake  and  then  they  begin  to   attach\r\n\r\nconditions.  Now, Sir, it is no use for  them  to  say\r\n\r\nthat they have not made a mistake, for their allies in\r\n\r\nthe  anti-merger campaign, the Member for Hong Lim and\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Anson, publicly declared in  a  radio\r\n\r\nforum  on  the  14th of June, 1962, that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  had  made a mistake. What was this  mistake?\r\n\r\nThe Barisan Sosialis realise --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir, because he\r\n\r\nsaid  that I have publicly declared, quoting me,  that\r\n\r\nthe Barisan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  made  a  mistake. I said, \"If  they  had  made  a\r\n\r\nmistake.  .  .\".  That  was the  commencement  of  the\r\n\r\nsentence, and I did quote it yesterday, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this matter has been gone\r\n\r\nthrough  already, and he said that not only  did  they\r\n\r\nmake  a mistake but he said, \"It is withdrawn,  it  is\r\n\r\nwithdrawn,\"  as  he claimed on behalf of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. Now the Barisan realise that complete merger\r\n\r\nmeans that the citizenship laws of the Federation must\r\n\r\napply  to  Singapore.  Those  who  were  not  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore will have to re-apply in accordance with the\r\n\r\nlaws of the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Nonsense!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, that is a most astonishing\r\n\r\ninterjection,  but I will deal with that  point,  Sir.\r\n\r\nNow,  they therefore say that Singapore citizens  must\r\n\r\nautomatically convert to be Federal citizens and  they\r\n\r\nsay  that  Article  22 of the Federation  Constitution\r\n\r\nmakes this possible. Now, Sir, when we discuss what is\r\n\r\npossible  and  what is not possible, I think  everyone\r\n\r\nwill  agree  that it is only proper that  we  talk  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  actual possibilities and not  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nacademic  possibilities. And  here,  the  position  is\r\n\r\nclear  beyond doubt. The Member for Anson has  written\r\n\r\nto  the  Tunku over this question. He had  received  a\r\n\r\nreply  from  the Tunku which he is rather  bashful  to\r\n\r\npublish,  but  if  he still maintains  that  automatic\r\n\r\nconversion of citizenship is possible, then  we  shall\r\n\r\nbe extremely delighted and grateful if he will publish\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku's reply. Now, Sir, Mr Lim Ching Siong  has\r\n\r\nalso written to the Tunku.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> For what?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> But he has not dared to publish\r\n\r\nthe  contents of this letter or the Tunku's  reply  to\r\n\r\nit,  if there is any reply. So these people know  what\r\n\r\nthe real position is. Then why do they keep on harping\r\n\r\non automatic conversion? Sir, this subject should have\r\n\r\nbeen  settled last November when the letters exchanged\r\n\r\nbetween   the   Prime  Ministers  of   Singapore   and\r\n\r\nFederation were tabled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the Assembly on 24th November last year. May  I\r\n\r\nquote a passage from the Tunku's letter? He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would like to emphasise that it cannot be\r\n\r\nassumed  that the analogy of Penang or Malacca  is\r\n\r\nnecessarily relevant to the status of Singapore in\r\n\r\nmerger  with  the Federation. Article  22  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Constitution  makes  provision  for  a\r\n\r\nmerger  of  new  states  on  terms  which  do  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  have  to follow  Penang  and  Malacca\r\n\r\nwhich were already members of the Federation  when\r\n\r\nthe  1957  Constitution came into  force.  If  the\r\n\r\nstricter  laws  of other states  were  applied  to\r\n\r\nSingapore, Singapore would be entitled to not more\r\n\r\nthan  twelve  seats since less  persons  would  be\r\n\r\neligible  for  citizenship  and  consequently  for\r\n\r\nfranchise,  quite  apart  from  the  question   of\r\n\r\nweightage for rural areas.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  here  we  have a definitive statement  on  how\r\n\r\nArticle 22 can be applied in the event of complete\r\n\r\nmerger. Now the Barisan are not happy that Malacca\r\n\r\nand   Penang  citizenship  laws  will   apply   to\r\n\r\nSingapore   in  a  complete  merger.   They   want\r\n\r\nsomething  more  favourable  and  the  Tunku   has\r\n\r\npointed out that the conditions of conversion  may\r\n\r\nwell  be  even stricter than those of  Penang  and\r\n\r\nMalacca  under complete merger. So in the face  of\r\n\r\nall  this,  this  talk about automatic  conversion\r\n\r\nstrikes  me  as  having more than a lunatic  tinge\r\n\r\nabout  it.  The Barisan Sosialis have  added  this\r\n\r\ncondition with just one intention and that  is  to\r\n\r\nfrustrate  merger.  They know  that  complete  and\r\n\r\nautomatic conversion is not possible, and in  fact\r\n\r\nthis  is  why they ask for it. There is one  other\r\n\r\nmotive  which  may  be in their minds.  By  laying\r\n\r\nstress   on  automatic  conversion  into   Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship, they hope to convince the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  that somehow they are missing something\r\n\r\ngood  by  not  being allowed automatic conversion.\r\n\r\nLet  us  examine this aspect very closely. Let  us\r\n\r\nask  ourselves,  what in fact would  the  ordinary\r\n\r\ncitizen gain if automatic conversion were granted?\r\n\r\nIs  he  better  off  than under  the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposals?  The answer is `Yes'. He is better  off\r\n\r\nin  two  respects - and only in two respects. First,\r\n\r\nhe  will  be  able  to stand for election  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation   general   election,   not   only   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  but  also in the Federation.  This  is\r\n\r\nsomething  not  of  great  value  to  the  average\r\n\r\ncitizen who, if he wants to stand for election  to\r\n\r\nthe Central \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParliament, can do so in Singapore. The other\r\n\r\nadditional benefit the average citizen  gets  from\r\n\r\nautomatic  conversion is that he will be  able  to\r\n\r\nvote more easily in the Federation when he changes\r\n\r\nhis  address  and moves there. The  procedure  for\r\n\r\nregistration  will be much easier than  under  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  White Paper proposals. But  here  again\r\n\r\nthe  advantage  is  not something  of  fundamental\r\n\r\nimportance.  These  are  the  only  gains  to  the\r\n\r\ncitizen,  and I challenge the Opposition  to  cite\r\n\r\nany other advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, against these two advantages - the\r\n\r\nability  to  vote  and stand for election  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation and not only in Singapore - what are  the\r\n\r\nlosses  to  Singapore under complete and automatic\r\n\r\nconversion  in  full merger? The losses  are  both\r\n\r\nextensive and immediate. First, under the complete\r\n\r\nand  unconditional  form  of  merger,  only  those\r\n\r\ncitizens  who  are educated, who are  sufficiently\r\n\r\neducated  in  Malay  and  English  can  stand  for\r\n\r\nelection  to  the  Singapore  Assembly;  in  other\r\n\r\nwords,  large  numbers of Singapore citizens  will\r\n\r\nlose their present right to stand for election  to\r\n\r\ntheir  own  State Assembly. Next, Chinese  schools\r\n\r\nwill have to conform to the Federation's education\r\n\r\npolicy and eventually take the examinations either\r\n\r\nin  English  or Malay. Then there is no  guarantee\r\n\r\nfor  our  businessmen that Singapore's  free  port\r\n\r\nstatus will remain so long as we so desire. And 90\r\n\r\nper  cent of our taxes will be handed over to  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government. The Bank of China closes  down\r\n\r\nand imparts of textiles and other goods from China\r\n\r\nwill  be  severely restricted, thereby  disturbing\r\n\r\nour  entrepot  trade. Let us  therefore  strike  a\r\n\r\nbalance  sheet of profit and loss for the  benefit\r\n\r\nof  being able to vote and stand for election both\r\n\r\nin  Singapore and in the Federation to the Central\r\n\r\nParliament. The Singapore citizen loses so many of\r\n\r\nhis  existing rights and privileges, and all this\r\n\r\nis   assuming  that  there  is  full  merger  with\r\n\r\ncomplete and automatic conversion of citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if there is no automatic conversion,\r\n\r\nthen  some 340,000 registered citizens, or  nearly\r\n\r\nhalf  the  electorate,  run  the  risk  of  losing\r\n\r\ncompletely all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  political rights. The Barisan Socialis  and\r\n\r\nthe Workers' Party can say this cannot be. But the\r\n\r\nlaws  of  the Federation are there and  they  will\r\n\r\napply  to  Singapore if we ask  for  complete  and\r\n\r\nunconditional merger. The Barisan Sosialis make  a\r\n\r\nhue and cry about proportional representation.  As\r\n\r\nregards   proportional  representation,  this   is\r\n\r\nexpressly  provided  for in  Article  116  of  the\r\n\r\nFederal   Constitution.  If  in  the   matter   of\r\n\r\ncitizenship, Singapore conforms to the laws of the\r\n\r\nFederation,   then   proportional   representation\r\n\r\nfollows automatically. On the other hand,  if  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  want  more favourable treatment  than  is\r\n\r\nprovided  for in the Federation citizenship  laws,\r\n\r\nhow  can they sustain their claim for proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation?  These  matters  were  raised  and\r\n\r\ndiscussed  during  negotiations  between  the  two\r\n\r\nGovernments,  and the exchange of letters  between\r\n\r\nthe  two  Prime Ministers to which I have referred\r\n\r\ndeals with this specific point. Our Prime Minister\r\n\r\nreferred to this point in his letter and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On the other hand, the claim that Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens should automatically become Federation\r\n\r\ncitizens and thereby increase the representation\r\n\r\nof Singapore was, and still is, in the view of\r\n\r\nthe Federation Government too absurd to merit\r\n\r\nserious consideration.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now deal with the amendment moved by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Cairnhill. He  wanted  a  third\r\n\r\nalternative  posed,  that  is,  whether  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  enter the Federation of Malaysia on  terms\r\n\r\nnot  less  favourable  than those  of  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nStates.  The  Government  has  announced  that  it\r\n\r\naccepts  this  amendment. There is a lurking  fear\r\n\r\namong   some   people - a  fear  that  is   actively\r\n\r\nencouraged    and   fostered   by   the    Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis - that Singapore will somehow be treated as\r\n\r\nan inferior partner in the Federation of Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThe   acceptance, of  this  amendment   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  which  shows  that  such  fears   are\r\n\r\ncompletely  unfounded,  makes  nonsense   of   the\r\n\r\nBarisan's  claim that we shall be relegated  to  a\r\n\r\nsecond-class  status in future Malaysia.  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nhis  more ebullient mood, the Member for Anson has\r\n\r\nlikened   both  the  White  Paper  proposals   and\r\n\r\ncomplete  and  unconditional merger  on  an  equal\r\n\r\nbasis with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany of the 11 States to imperialist annexation  of\r\n\r\nthe  State  of  Singapore  by  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  These  words were uttered in  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Referendum Bill, If there are any\r\n\r\npersons who are foolish enough to be misguided  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson and believe in what he says,\r\n\r\nthen  the third choice of equality with the Borneo\r\n\r\nStates  offers  a way out. But I say  that  events\r\n\r\nwill  show  that the White Paper merger proposals,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  point  of  view of  advantages  to  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  of Singapore, will be found far superior\r\n\r\nto the other two alternatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the stage is set for the final act in\r\n\r\nthe  drama  of  merger and Malaysia.  It  was  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and  their  stooges  in  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  who, by their mad campaign of  agitation\r\n\r\nagainst  merger  and  Malaysia,  made  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  come  to  its realisation  with  greater\r\n\r\nspeed   than  otherwise  would  be  possible.   By\r\n\r\nlaunching  a  wild  and  indiscriminate   campaign\r\n\r\nagainst merger and Malaysia, they have opened  the\r\n\r\neyes  of  everyone, including the leaders  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya, to the urgency of  speedier\r\n\r\nestablishment of Malaysia. Whatever  the  form  of\r\n\r\nmerger  the  people of Singapore will choose,  the\r\n\r\nend result will be the same for the Communists and\r\n\r\ntheir  stooges.  Their  own  mischief  making  has\r\n\r\nhastened the very danger to themselves which  they\r\n\r\nwanted  to avoid in trying to obstruct merger.  We\r\n\r\nhave  warned these foolish and opportunistic  men,\r\n\r\nwho  are now playing with the Communists,  of  the\r\n\r\nconsequences  that will befall them. Our  warnings\r\n\r\nwere  given in good faith, in an attempt  to  save\r\n\r\nthese  misguided  persons  from  the  consequences\r\n\r\nwhich we see very clearly --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I regret to say, Sir, that these\r\n\r\nwarnings  have  gone unheeded.  Indeed  they  were\r\n\r\nresented  and  even  regarded  as  threats  in  an\r\n\r\nattempt  at intimidation. May I once again counsel\r\n\r\ncaution  and  ask them to take heed of  our  words\r\n\r\nbefore  it is too late? Even now it is much  later\r\n\r\nthan they think.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nafter the British return on the conclusion of  the\r\n\r\nWorld War, they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere forced by the rising nationalism unleashed in\r\n\r\nthis  region by the Japanese occupation  to  bring\r\n\r\ninto  existence a new national entity out  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting  separate States of Malaya.  The  British\r\n\r\nconveniently kept out Singapore. Singapore is left\r\n\r\nout,  not  because  of  the  lack  of  nationalist\r\n\r\nfeelings  but  it  was thought perhaps  that  this\r\n\r\nisland  State  would serve as a Gibraltar  of  the\r\n\r\nEast - a   secure  military base  isolated  from  the\r\n\r\nsurrounding  turbulence in the political  cauldron\r\n\r\nof  Asia;  as Gibraltar in the West has been  safe\r\n\r\nand  sound  despite the wake of rising nationalism\r\n\r\nin   Africa   and  the  surrounding  Mediterranean\r\n\r\ncountries.  The history of nationalism  in  Malaya\r\n\r\nwould  have  taken  a different  emphasis  if  the\r\n\r\nBritish had not kept Singapore out of the Malayan\r\n\r\nentity.  Singapore was the hot-bed of  nationalism\r\n\r\nin  the Malaysian region. However, after 17  years\r\n\r\nof  separation, a new chapter has opened. With the\r\n\r\ndevelopment     of     nuclear     weapons     and\r\n\r\nintercontinental missiles the use of Singapore  as\r\n\r\na military base is doubtful. On the other hand, if\r\n\r\nSingapore  takes a different political  road  from\r\n\r\nthe  rest  of  Malaya, it could pose a  formidable\r\n\r\nchallenge to the preservation of the status quo of\r\n\r\nMalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, history cannot be reversed, and, therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  today  bear  witness to  all  these  political\r\n\r\ndebates  in this Assembly intermingled with  party\r\n\r\nbickerings  which have highlighted the proceedings\r\n\r\nof  this  House. We have sought to rise above  the\r\n\r\npetty   squabbles  that  are  inevitable  in   the\r\n\r\nconflict  of party interests, so that  the  issues\r\n\r\nthat  face  the people of Singapore can be  placed\r\n\r\nsquarely  before them away and isolated  from  the\r\n\r\nheat of personal rancour and party differences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there would have been no White Paper nor\r\n\r\nreferendum  law if the British had  not  separated\r\n\r\nSingapore  17 years ago from the rest  of  Malaya.\r\n\r\nAnd   I  would  say  that  today,  with  very  few\r\n\r\nexceptions,  all  citizens of Singapore  would  be\r\n\r\ncitizens of the Federation of Malaya enjoying  the\r\n\r\nsame    rights    and   shouldering    the    same\r\n\r\nresponsibilities. I say this, Sir, quoting no less\r\n\r\nan  authority  than  our Prime Minister - the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of the State of Singapore - who  has  been\r\n\r\ninstrumental  in negotiations with the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment   on  the  White  Paper  Constitutional\r\n\r\nproposals. Sir, let us go back to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear 1957. The All-Party Constitutional Talks with\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom had just been finalised.  The\r\n\r\nAssembly  had  endorsed  the  basis  for   a   new\r\n\r\nConstitution for Singapore. Arising from the  All-Party  agreement  and from negotiations  with  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom, the Singapore Citizenship Bill was\r\n\r\nintroduced  in  this very House. After  the  First\r\n\r\nReading,  the Prime Minister, then the Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar,  sitting on the Opposition  Bench,\r\n\r\ngave  his  approval and support  of  the  Bill  in\r\n\r\nprinciple,  and  thereafter  the  Bill  went  into\r\n\r\nSelect Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Select Committee on the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Citizenship Bill, the  Chief  Minister,\r\n\r\nthe   present  Member  for  Cairnhill,  moved   an\r\n\r\namendment  to  clause  9 of  the  draft  Singapore\r\n\r\nCitizenship  Bill  to  reduce  the  residential\r\n\r\nqualification   of   applicants   for    Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship from 10 years to 8 years. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, may I refer you to column 655 o, the Official\r\n\r\nReport of the Select Committee on the Bill,  dated\r\n\r\n28th  September, 1957? The Member  for  Cairnhill,\r\n\r\nwho was then the Chief Minister, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, this ten-year residential qualification\r\n\r\nwas  agreed  by the All-Party Conference  held  in\r\n\r\nFebruary  1957. It was endorsed by the Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  in March this year, and was subsequently\r\n\r\naccepted by the Colonial Office when the All-Panty\r\n\r\nDelegation  negotiated for the  new  constitution.\r\n\r\nSince  then,  the Government has  gone  into  this\r\n\r\nresidential qualification of ten years.  The  All-Party  Delegation has had further discussions  and\r\n\r\nit  felt that an amendment to eight years would be\r\n\r\neasier for administrative purposes in view of  the\r\n\r\nfact that identity cards were issued late in 1948.\r\n\r\nIt   is   for   that  reason  that  the  All-Party\r\n\r\nDelegation  felt that an amendment to eight  years\r\n\r\nwould  make  it  easier for the administration  to\r\n\r\nregister all those persons who are qualified under\r\n\r\nthis proposed legislation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar in those\r\n\r\ndays - he is at present the Prime Minister - supported\r\n\r\nthe  reduction from 10 years to 8 years, but based\r\n\r\non different grounds and reasons from those of the\r\n\r\nChief Minister. He said, in column 656:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Lee Kuan Yew: Mr Chairman, as I have said\r\n\r\nin  the Assembly during the Second Reading of this\r\n\r\nBill,  if  the amendment from ten to  eight  years\r\n\r\ndoes  not  result  in our citizenship  laws  being\r\n\r\nfurther  away  from the citizenship  laws  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation,   then  we  are  in  favour   of   the\r\n\r\namendment.  As far as I can see, the amendment  to\r\n\r\neight years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  make our citizenship laws more akin to those\r\n\r\nof the Federation and I support the amendment.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>May I repeat again, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As far as I can see, the amendment to eight\r\n\r\nyears will make our citizenship laws more akin  to\r\n\r\nthose  of  the  Federation,  and  I  support   the\r\n\r\namendment.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>There  is  no  doubt  in my mind  that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister made this decision in Select Committee in\r\n\r\n1957  on  the spur of the moment. As a  matter  of\r\n\r\nfact,  he had given careful thought to the problem\r\n\r\nof  citizenship  when merger was  to  take  place.\r\n\r\nAbout two weeks earlier, during the debate on  the\r\n\r\nSecond Reading of the Citizenship Bill, the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  who  was  then the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar,  said - may  I refer you,  Sir,  to  Hansard,\r\n\r\ncolumn 2575, dated 11th September, 1957, about the\r\n\r\nfifth line from the top:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If we are honest about merger and the building\r\n\r\nof  one  nation,  when we draw up our  citizenship\r\n\r\nlaws,  we  must see where it is going to  dovetail\r\n\r\ninto  the Federation citizenship laws because  the\r\n\r\nmoment the principle of merger is accepted we have\r\n\r\nto discuss the conditions for it.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister in 1957 thought that the original proposal of qualification for Singapore citizenship of 10 years was slightly higher than that for Federal citizenship and therefore supported the move to reduce the qualification, to\r\n\r\nbring  it  into line with the Federal  citizenship\r\n\r\nlaws. Sir, the Prime Minister had in mind not only\r\n\r\nthe   comparative  provisions  of  the  Federation\r\n\r\ncitizenship  laws  but he had  in  mind  also  the\r\n\r\ncitizenship  laws  of the Commonwealth  countries,\r\n\r\nbecause all the citizens of Commonwealth countries\r\n\r\nare  called Commonwealth citizens. It seems to  me\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom   Government,  as  the   leader   of   the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth, to see that no member of the British\r\n\r\nCommonwealth deviates substantially from the  norm\r\n\r\nof  Commonwealth citizenship laws. It appears that\r\n\r\nthe  Federation citizenship laws and the Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship  laws  are all based substantially  on\r\n\r\nthe norm adopted by all Commonwealth countries and\r\n\r\napplicable to all Commonwealth citizens, with some\r\n\r\nslight variations to suit local conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now refer you to the Report of the\r\n\r\nAll-Party Singapore Constitutional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConference,  1957, paragraph 49? This  report  was\r\n\r\nthe  result of negotiations between the  All-Party\r\n\r\nMission  and  the  U.K. Government.  Paragraph  49\r\n\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It had already been agreed at the previous\r\n\r\nConference  that a separate Singapore  citizenship\r\n\r\nwithin  the  Commonwealth should  be  created.  We\r\n\r\nrecognised that it would consequently be necessary\r\n\r\nto introduce legislation in Singapore establishing\r\n\r\nthe  conditions and qualifications  for  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  We  agreed that the  Singapore  Bill\r\n\r\nshould  be  prepared  in  consultation  with   Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's Government in the United Kingdom in view\r\n\r\nof  the  proposal in paragraph 51 that the British\r\n\r\nNationality   Act  should  be  amended   so   that\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizenship  would  be  recognised   in\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom law as conferring  the  status  of\r\n\r\nCommonwealth citizen.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is, therefore, my contention that\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens have acquired their citizenship\r\n\r\nrights on qualifications based on the norm adopted\r\n\r\nin  other  Commonwealth countries and  in  general\r\n\r\nconformity, as the Prime Minister in 1957  agreed,\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation citizenship laws.  At  least\r\n\r\nthat  was what the Prime Minister told us in 1957.\r\n\r\nThose who have satisfied the minimum qualification\r\n\r\nof  8  years  in  1958  when they  obtained  their\r\n\r\ncitizenship  papers, will now  satisfy  a  minimum\r\n\r\nresidential period of 12 years in 1962.  Moreover,\r\n\r\nthe  vast  majority  of those  who  have  acquired\r\n\r\ncitizenship by registration have been staying here\r\n\r\nfor  decades, making this island city  their  home\r\n\r\nand  the  object  of  their loyalty.  I  therefore\r\n\r\ncannot agree with the Prime Minister on the  first\r\n\r\nalternative  in  the question to  be  put  in  the\r\n\r\nballot  paper. The main reason against  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  is that I cannot agree with his citizenship\r\n\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now come, Sir, to the distortions of the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister in his opening speech on the stand\r\n\r\nof  the Opposition towards merger. When the merger\r\n\r\nissue  was debated in the House, the views towards\r\n\r\nmerger  were split into two. The P.A.P., supported\r\n\r\nby  S.P.A. and U.M.N.O., supported the White Paper\r\n\r\nproposals;   the  Workers'  Party,   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis and the U.P.P. supported the principle of\r\n\r\nautomatic  conversion of Singapore  citizens  into\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens and proportionate representation\r\n\r\nin the Central Parliament. Under the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgreement  of 1948 all citizens of the  respective\r\n\r\nStates  which they term State nationals, excluding\r\n\r\nMalacca  and Penang, automatically became  Federal\r\n\r\nCitizens  by  virtue of section  125  (a)  of  the\r\n\r\nAgreement.  Section 125 (a) of the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya Agreement of 1948 reads as follows :-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Citizens by operation of law ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On and after the prescribed date, the following\r\n\r\npersons  shall  be citizens of the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya by operation of law;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) any subject of His Highness, the Ruler of\r\n\r\nany States;\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>which is the best analogy to our present Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship. Now, Sir, Johore citizens then became\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens automatically, Selangor citizens\r\n\r\nbecame Federal citizens also automatically, Perlis\r\n\r\ncitizens     also    became    Federal    citizens\r\n\r\nautomatically, Pahang citizens also automatically,\r\n\r\nPerak,  Trengganu, Negri Sembilan and so on.  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhy   should   Singapore   citizens   be   treated\r\n\r\ndifferently?  The Prime Minister's  case  for  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper is based on the premise that most  of\r\n\r\nthe  citizens  of Singapore by registration  could\r\n\r\nnot  have  obtained their citizenship  under  more\r\n\r\nstringent   laws  applicable  in  the  Federation.\r\n\r\nHowever, his stand in 1957, as I have stated  just\r\n\r\nnow,  was  different and his views in  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  on the Singapore Citizenship Bill  gave\r\n\r\none the impression that the proposed qualification\r\n\r\nin  the draft Bill is higher than the Federation's\r\n\r\nqualification and therefore should be reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I will come to the second alternative\r\n\r\nin   the   Prime  Minister's  motion.  The  second\r\n\r\nalternative in the ballot paper posed by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   is  vague  and  therefore  capable   of\r\n\r\ndistortion.  What  is meant  by  \"a  complete  and\r\n\r\nunconditional merger as a State on an equal  basis\r\n\r\nwith  the  other eleven States in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution documents of the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya\"? Does the Prime Minister take it  to  mean\r\n\r\nthat  all  Singapore citizens by registration,  on\r\n\r\nMerger  Day, would be deprived of their  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  and have got to re-apply  separately\r\n\r\nand  individually for Federal citizenship? If that\r\n\r\nis  the  case, Sir, the chances are that  many  of\r\n\r\nthem  could not get it, not because they are  not\r\n\r\nqualified - the Prime Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndid  not  think  so in 1957, but by administrative\r\n\r\nobstacles  and delays which may be  posed  by  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government which would have the control of\r\n\r\nthe  administration of citizenship. I  would  also\r\n\r\nwish  to  ask  the Government whether  the  second\r\n\r\nalternative  has  been the basis  of  negotiations\r\n\r\nbetween   the   Singapore   and   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernments,  and if that is so,  whether  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  set  up in concrete proposals as  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion of the Prime Minister puts forward\r\n\r\ntwo alternatives, the first one is the White Paper\r\n\r\nproposal. The White Paper proposal is not  genuine\r\n\r\nmerger - and  here, Sir, I can do  nothing  better\r\n\r\nthan  to  quote  the P.A.P.'s ally  on  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper, the S.P.A. The S.P.A., in a sense, are more\r\n\r\nhonest,  and  in  their speeches and  their  party\r\n\r\npublications  they have repeatedly said  that  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper proposal is not merger but a form  of\r\n\r\ncloser   association  with  the  Federation.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, may I refer to page 61 [col.  93]  of\r\n\r\nyesterday's  Official  Report.  The   Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill - about seven lines from the bottom said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Now proposal No. 1 of Command Paper No. 33 is,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  not  merger. It is  a  form  of  closer\r\n\r\nassociation. It is a form which the P.A.P.,  as  a\r\n\r\nGovernment,   has  secured  from  the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And may I refer again to the July 1962 addition of\r\n\r\nthe S.P.A. organ, page 4, which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><div align=\"center\">'CLOSER ASSOCIATION NOT MERGER</div><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement between the Federation Government\r\n\r\nand the Singapore Government is not merger. It  is\r\n\r\na  form of closer association along the lines of a\r\n\r\nConfederation.  We  support it  as  a  first  step\r\n\r\ntowards the eventual merger and the sooner we  all\r\n\r\nbecome  Malayan conscious and behave  as  Malayans\r\n\r\nthe sooner will merger take place.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And the article continues on:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The simple unadulterated truth is that because\r\n\r\nthe agreement reached is not merger but a form  of\r\n\r\nConfederation,  the  citizens of  Singapore  shall\r\n\r\nremain  as citizens of Singapore and the  citizens\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation shall remain citizens  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other words, Sir, what the S.P.A. is trying to\r\n\r\ndrive  at  is  that only in a genuine merger  will\r\n\r\nSingapore   citizens  and  Federal   citizens   be\r\n\r\nconverted  into one common citizenship. Therefore,\r\n\r\nbased on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe S.P.A.'s arguments, from the S.P.A., a Party which\r\n\r\nsupports the White Paper of the P.A.P. Government, the\r\n\r\nsecond alternative in the motion of the Prime Minister\r\n\r\ncannot  be merger because then all Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\nand all Federal citizens shall come together under one\r\n\r\ncommon  citizenship. Then, Sir, what could this second\r\n\r\nalternative in the proposed ballot paper mean but  the\r\n\r\ndeprivation of Singapore citizens by registration from\r\n\r\nthe  present  citizenship they now have, and  becoming\r\n\r\nstateless  persons, which means half  of  the  present\r\n\r\n624,000  Singapore  citizens  would  become  stateless\r\n\r\npersons.  Sir,  of course, the P.A.P. can  argue  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  S.P.A. distortion either by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill in his speech or by the S.P.A. organ of what\r\n\r\nis  meant  by merger and of what is the constitutional\r\n\r\nrelationship  between Singapore and the Federation  as\r\n\r\nenvisaged  in  the  White Paper proposals.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nSir,  I shall quote from the P.A.P. organ itself,  the\r\n\r\nPetir. In the issue dated 31st May, 1962, page 5,  the\r\n\r\nPetir said\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The present merger proposals are but steps towards\r\n\r\nfull integration and under conditions satisfactory  to\r\n\r\nall  concerned.  Nobody  believes  that  these  merger\r\n\r\nproposals are final and absolute.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  what does this clause mean? It means and admits\r\n\r\nthat  the  White  Paper is only a  step  towards  full\r\n\r\nintegration.  Does it not also mean,  Sir,  that  full\r\n\r\nintegration  is therefore the ideal objective  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Malaya which includes Singapore, but that at\r\n\r\npresent  it  is not possible to achieve it?  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, it is not possible to have a common citizenship\r\n\r\nuntil  conditions are ripe. In the same page the Petir\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This demand for complete integration would be\r\n\r\nunacceptable to the Federation leaders at the  present\r\n\r\ntime.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what is meant by this article is\r\n\r\nthat  the  ideal  is  complete  integration  which  at\r\n\r\npresent  the  Federation leaders are not  prepared  to\r\n\r\ngive.  Therefore, Mr Speaker, the second  alternative\r\n\r\nin the Prime Minister's motion can only mean something\r\n\r\nelse  but  not  the  complete  integration  which   we\r\n\r\nunderstand,  on  the  complete integration  which  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norgan  understands - the P.A.P. organ,  the  Petir,  as\r\n\r\ndifferent from the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first alternative, which is the White Paper, is\r\n\r\nunacceptable to the people. The second alternative has\r\n\r\nnever  been put forward even in broad generalities  as\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper proposals. It is vague, and therefore\r\n\r\ncan   lead   itself  to  all  sorts  of   distortions,\r\n\r\nmanipulations  and interpretations  and  is  therefore\r\n\r\nequally unacceptable. Proposal one is unacceptable and\r\n\r\nproposal two is even more unacceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore are not prepared to give a\r\n\r\nblank cheque to the second proposal posed by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the first proposal, the Government is singing\r\n\r\nhigh  praises for the White Paper. The Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  that  under  complete integration - and  this  was\r\n\r\nrepeated just now by the Minister for Finance - many  of\r\n\r\nthe  Assemblymen in this Chamber would not be eligible\r\n\r\nto  stand  for  election as there would be  no  multi-lingualism. Mr Speaker, Sir, are they then  appealing\r\n\r\nto these Assemblymen to support the White Paper? I am\r\n\r\nsure,  Sir, if such personal sacrifices are necessary,\r\n\r\nthey  will be prepared to rise to the occasion in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the  people. The so-called  autonomy  in\r\n\r\neducation, and labour is more imaginary than real.  It\r\n\r\nis  my  view that in matters under the control of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government - either absolute control, or  under\r\n\r\nconcurrent  powers - such as the control of defence  and\r\n\r\ninternal  security,  of  law  and  the  machinery   of\r\n\r\ngovernment, of financial and industrial policies,  and\r\n\r\nso  on,  a  Central Government can bring the Singapore\r\n\r\nState  Government down to its knees if  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nState  Government refuses to accept the  \"advice\"  and\r\n\r\n\"direction\"  of a Central Government on  matters  over\r\n\r\nwhich  the  State  Government  is  supposed  to   have\r\n\r\nexclusive  jurisdiction, for instance,  education  and\r\n\r\nlabour. This, Mr Speaker, Sir, is my analysis of  the\r\n\r\nso-called autonomy in education and labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to collect only 75 per cent of the revenue\r\n\r\nto  administer the respective subjects like  education\r\n\r\nand labour is similar or akin to a P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbranch  collecting 75 per cent of its  membership  dues\r\n\r\nitself in order to defray branch expenses on behalf  of\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Executive  of  the  P.A.P.;  because  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, financial, economic, fiscal and taxation\r\n\r\npolicies  would  be  decided  under  the  White   Paper\r\n\r\nproposals  by  the  Central Government.  The  Singapore\r\n\r\nState  Government would not be able, for  instance,  to\r\n\r\nexercise a flexible fiscal and economic policy to  cope\r\n\r\nwith  its special economic and social responsibilities.\r\n\r\nFor  instance,  we  would have the responsibilities  of\r\n\r\nadministering health and social security,  but  without\r\n\r\nthe  corresponding power and the means to discharge our\r\n\r\nobligations to the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for special privileges to Malays, Sir, which the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister mentioned in his speech  yesterday,  we\r\n\r\nare  not  against  them, so long  as  they  are  within\r\n\r\nreasonable limits and are for the benefit of the under-privileged Malay masses. What we oppose is  to  keep  a\r\n\r\nsmall  privileged  group  of  Malays  and  ignore   the\r\n\r\ninterests of the poor Malay masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now come to the third alternative put\r\n\r\nforward  by  the  S.P.A. which  is  acceptable  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  This  third  proposal,  Sir,  is   equally\r\n\r\nunacceptable to the people of Singapore.  It  is  vague\r\n\r\nand  the  same argument against the second  alternative\r\n\r\napplies equally well to the third proposal. It could be\r\n\r\ninterpreted in the same way, as I see it,  as  the  so-called  Penang  and  Malacca type of  merger,  and  the\r\n\r\npeople would be asked as in the second proposal to give\r\n\r\na blank cheque for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my opinion, therefore, that the second and third\r\n\r\nproposals could be interpreted to mean something  worse\r\n\r\nthan  the  White  Paper  proposals.  The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance stated at the conclusion of his speech that the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper proposals on merger are far superior to the\r\n\r\ntwo  other  proposals. He has admitted  it.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Government's tactic of putting  alternatives\r\n\r\nmore unacceptable than the White Paper still stands and\r\n\r\nhas not changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this motion is to seek\r\n\r\njustification  in  the  eyes  of  the  world  that  the\r\n\r\nreferendum which is soon to come is a democratic and an\r\n\r\nhonest  referendum and that the White  Paper  proposals\r\n\r\nhave  been  approved by a majority  of  the  voters  by\r\n\r\nincluding all blank votes as pro-White Paper votes. The\r\n\r\nalternatives  posed  in  the  Newfoundland  and  Uganda\r\n\r\nreferenda were genuine alternatives. Let me illustrate,\r\n\r\nSir;  if the people of Singapore are asked whether they\r\n\r\nprefer   potatoes  or  bread,  they  are  not   genuine\r\n\r\nalternatives,  because  the  people  of  Singapore  are\r\n\r\ndivided  into  those who eat bread and  those  who  eat\r\n\r\nrice.  Similarly,  Sir, if the people  of  Ireland  are\r\n\r\nasked  whether they prefer rice or bread, they are  not\r\n\r\ngenuine  alternatives, because the  alternatives  there\r\n\r\nwould be potatoes and bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government were sincere in thrashing out\r\n\r\nthe  genuine  alternatives in the  merger  issue,  they\r\n\r\nshould  have long ago convened an All-Party Conference,\r\n\r\nas  it  was done during the 1957 constitutional  talks;\r\n\r\nthe   result  then  was  unanimity  and  everybody  was\r\n\r\nsatisfied.  Sir,  it  is still not  too  late  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion of the Prime Minister only serves as an\r\n\r\nattempt  to  win  the  argument  on  merger  over   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Parties  who are against  the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposals  and  that, Sir, will fail.  Nothing  arising\r\n\r\nfrom  this  debate  could alter the Government's  basic\r\n\r\ntactical  position,  which  is  to  put  proposals   or\r\n\r\nalternatives  more unacceptable than  the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposals. And you have no better proof than  from  the\r\n\r\nhorse's  mouth of the Minister for Finance. Any genuine\r\n\r\nalternative  could not be accepted by  the  Government.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Sir, by putting in more alternatives,  more\r\n\r\nproposals  or  amendments which are acceptable  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  they would only be serving to confuse  the\r\n\r\nissue at stake. The issue is that the people should  be\r\n\r\nasked  to accept or reject the White Paper. If that  is\r\n\r\nthe question to be posed, there would be no doubt about\r\n\r\nthe  outcome.  But as things are, the Government  would\r\n\r\npush\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough  this  sham  referendum and  steam-roller  its\r\n\r\nWhite Paper proposals through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should the people do in the circumstances? If\r\n\r\nthe  voter does not go and vote, he loses his vote  in\r\n\r\nfuture elections. If he tears his vote or defaces  it,\r\n\r\nhe will go to gaol. If he writes his name and address,\r\n\r\nhe  is  afraid of being intimidated. Sir, if he throws\r\n\r\nin  a  blank  vote  it  would  be  considered  a  pro-Government vote. But faced with these possible courses\r\n\r\nof  action, our stand is that the people should  throw\r\n\r\nin  blank  votes, which is the least of the evils.  If\r\n\r\nthe  blank votes are more than the votes for the White\r\n\r\nPaper,  then the Government would keep quiet.  But  if\r\n\r\nthe  votes for the White Paper exceed the blank votes,\r\n\r\nnot  for  any reason but merely because the  voter  is\r\n\r\nfaced with impossible alternatives, and in desperation\r\n\r\nthrows his vote for the White Paper proposals, then we\r\n\r\nmay  be  giving Government the opportunity to announce\r\n\r\nseparately  the number of votes supporting  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  and  thereby  mount a  propaganda  campaign  to\r\n\r\nconvince  the  world  that the majority  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens have supported the White Paper and have  done\r\n\r\nso without counting the blank votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nstated  in  this House yesterday that the  Federation\r\n\r\nConstitution  makes provision for state  nationals  to\r\n\r\nbecome  Federal  citizens  from  the  moment  it  took\r\n\r\neffect.  Why then, he asked, could not state nationals\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  automatically have Federal  citizenship\r\n\r\nunder Article 22 of the Federation Constitution, which\r\n\r\nis   the  article  providing  that  whenever  any  new\r\n\r\nterritory is admitted into the Federation in pursuance\r\n\r\nof  Article  2, the Federation Parliament may  by  law\r\n\r\ndetermine what persons are to be citizens by reason of\r\n\r\ntheir  connection with that territory and the date  or\r\n\r\ndates  for  such  persons to be citizens.  He  further\r\n\r\nargued  that  it was not the spirit of the  Federation\r\n\r\nConstitution  to bar state nationals, whether  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  or the State to be admitted,  and  to  put\r\n\r\ntechnicalities in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  way would be a fraud, in view of the fact  that\r\n\r\nsince  1957  there has been accorded a new  status  of\r\n\r\nSingapore citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he knew that in this House on the 22nd of\r\n\r\nNovember, 1961, Hansard, Volume 15, columns  474,  475\r\n\r\nand  476,  I  had  taken the trouble  to  explain  the\r\n\r\ndistinction in the Federation citizenship laws between\r\n\r\nthose  who were born in any of the territories of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  before  Merdeka  Day  and  who  were   not\r\n\r\nqualified  to  be Federation citizens by operation  of\r\n\r\nlaw  under  the Constitution, and the state  nationals\r\n\r\nand  others  who  were qualified  to  be  citizens  by\r\n\r\noperation of law. Sir, I referred on that occasion  to\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  of section 124 of the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  Agreement,  1948, and  section  125  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya Agreement (Amendment) Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1952, and pointed out that a person born in Penang  or\r\n\r\nMalacca,  which  was referred to in the  Agreement  as\r\n\r\nBritish  Settlements,  became Federation  citizens  by\r\n\r\noperation  of  law  on  the  operative  date  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya Agreement. 1948 - that is  the  1st of February, 1948.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also pointed out that a person born in any\r\n\r\npart of the Federation outside Penang and Malacca  did\r\n\r\nnot become a citizen by operation of law unless (1) he\r\n\r\nis  a subject of the Ruler. Subjects of the Ruler  are\r\n\r\ndefined  as aborigines, Malays and persons naturalised\r\n\r\nas  subjects of the Ruler; and (2) if he is a  British\r\n\r\nsubject  or  a  citizen  of  the  United  Kingdom  and\r\n\r\nColonies,  and one of his parents was born in  any  of\r\n\r\nthe territories of the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also mentioned that the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\nAgreement  (Amendment) Ordinance,  1952,  deleted  two\r\n\r\nearlier   provisions  in  the  Federation  of   Malaya\r\n\r\nAgreement,  1948, providing  that  (1)  persons  born\r\n\r\nbefore,  on or after 1st of February, 1948  (i.e. the\r\n\r\nappointed  date of the Federation of Malaya Agreement)\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation  who habitually  spoke  the  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage and conformed to Malay customs and (2)  other\r\n\r\npersons  born  before, on or after the  1st  February,\r\n\r\n1948,  in  any  of the territories of the  Federation,\r\n\r\nboth of whose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparents were born in any of the territories of the\r\n\r\nFederation and were before or at the time of their\r\n\r\nbirth or thereafter became permanently resident in\r\n\r\nany   territory  of  the  Federation,  were   also\r\n\r\ncitizens by operation of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by the deletion of these two earlier\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Federation of Malaya Agreement,\r\n\r\n1948,  a  person  who  was  born  in  any  of  the\r\n\r\nterritories of the Federation outside  Penang  and\r\n\r\nMalacca  could only become a citizen by  operation\r\n\r\nof  law if he was a subject of the ruler, or if he\r\n\r\nwas  a British subject, or a citizen of the United\r\n\r\nKingdom  and Colonies, and one of his parents  was\r\n\r\nborn  in any of the territories of the Federation.\r\n\r\nTo  that  extent the more lax provisions obtaining\r\n\r\nfrom  the  operative  date of  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya   Agreement,  1948,  for   the   grant   of\r\n\r\ncitizenship by operation of law were tightened  up\r\n\r\nby  the  provisions  of the Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nAgreement (Amendment) Ordinance. 1952. Sir, before\r\n\r\nArticle 16 of the Constitution came into force  on\r\n\r\nMerdeka  Day, the 31st of August, 1957, those  who\r\n\r\nwere  born in any of the other territories outside\r\n\r\nPenang and Malacca and who were not qualified  for\r\n\r\ncitizenship  by operation of law were required  to\r\n\r\nmake an application for Federation citizenship and\r\n\r\nhad  to satisfy the requirements laid down in  the\r\n\r\nFederation   of  Malaya  Agreement,  1948.   These\r\n\r\nrequirements  were  those  of  residence  and   an\r\n\r\nadequate - not an elementary - knowledge of the  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage.  On or after Merdeka Day, under  Article\r\n\r\n16  of the Constitution, any person who is born in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation before Merdeka Day and who is  not\r\n\r\nqualified to be a citizen by operation of law must\r\n\r\nmake  an  application to the Federation Government\r\n\r\nto be registered as a citizen and is entitled to a\r\n\r\ngrant   of   citizenship  if  he   satisfies   the\r\n\r\nFederation Government, (a) that he has resided  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation during the seven years immediately\r\n\r\npreceding the date of the application for a period\r\n\r\namounting  in the aggregate to not less than  five\r\n\r\nyears;  (b)  that he intends to reside permanently\r\n\r\nin   the  Federation;  (c)  that  he  is  of  good\r\n\r\ncharacter; (d) that he has an elementary knowledge\r\n\r\nof the Malay language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere   citizenship   is   granted   by   way   of\r\n\r\nregistration  to  those  born  in  the  Federation\r\n\r\nbefore  Merdeka Day under Article 16, even if  all\r\n\r\nthe  requirements for citizenship by  registration\r\n\r\nare  satisfied, citizenship can still  be  refused\r\n\r\nand  there is no appeal from such refusal  to  the\r\n\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obvious inference to be drawn from a study\r\n\r\nof  this legislation is that there must be a large\r\n\r\nnumber of Indians and Chinese who are born in  the\r\n\r\nStates  of  the  Federation  outside  Penang   and\r\n\r\nMalacca  before  Merdeka Day  who  are  still  not\r\n\r\nqualified under Federation citizenship laws for an\r\n\r\nautomatic  grant  of Federation  citizenship.  The\r\n\r\nimportant consideration is that unlike those  born\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, these persons who were born in  the\r\n\r\nassociated States of what became, on the  31st  of\r\n\r\nAugust,  1957, the independent sovereign State  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya would be in  a  stronger\r\n\r\nposition  to  claim  automatic citizenship  rights\r\n\r\nthan  those  born in Singapore by virtue  of  this\r\n\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a claim for automatic citizenship rights\r\n\r\nfor  the local born in Singapore would, in effect,\r\n\r\nbe  a  claim  that  they should  be  granted  more\r\n\r\nfavourable terms than the terms accorded to  those\r\n\r\nwho  were  born  in the associated States  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation   outside  Penang  or  Malacca   before\r\n\r\nMerdeka  Day  and  who  are not  eligible  for  an\r\n\r\nautomatic   grant   of   citizenship.   In    this\r\n\r\nconnection,  Sir, I would like to  repeat  what  I\r\n\r\nsaid in this House on the 22nd of September, 1961,\r\n\r\nduring  the  debate on the White Paper  proposals,\r\n\r\nHansard, Volume 15, 22nd of November, columns  479\r\n\r\nand 480.

And, Sir, if the Federation Parliament\r\n\r\nhas  not  granted automatic Federation Citizenship\r\n\r\nto  persons born in the associated States  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation, outside Penang and Malacca,  would  it\r\n\r\nbe  reasonable to expect the Federation Parliament\r\n\r\nto grant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nautomatic citizenship rights to persons  who  have\r\n\r\nonly  acquired citizenship rights in Singapore  by\r\n\r\nresidence?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad the Member for Anson has at last\r\n\r\nacknowledged  that  there can be  no  question  of\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens automatically becoming citizens\r\n\r\nof the Federation, because there are no provisions\r\n\r\nfor  such  automatic transformation of citizenship\r\n\r\nin the Federation Constitution. He agrees that the\r\n\r\nquestion of automatic conversion of citizenship on\r\n\r\nmerger  is  a  matter  for  negotiation  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation   Government.  He  has   made   certain\r\n\r\nproposals to the Tunku on automatic conversion  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship on merger, but in spite of a challenge\r\n\r\nin  this  House, he has not dared to  publish  the\r\n\r\nTunku's   reply.   Sir,  it  is   a   self-evident\r\n\r\nproposition  that  politics  is  the  art  of  the\r\n\r\npossible,   and   it   is  also   a   self-evident\r\n\r\nproposition that it takes two to make  a  bargain.\r\n\r\nIf  it  can be shown from a careful study  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Constitution  that  it  would  not  be\r\n\r\npractical   politics  to  expect  the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment to grant more favourable terms  to  all\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens than it is prepared to grant to\r\n\r\nits  own  local-born, then any contention that  an\r\n\r\nuncompromising  demand  for  automatic  conversion\r\n\r\nshould be pressed as a condition for merger can be\r\n\r\ndismissed  as a dishonest claim advanced  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of frustrating merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the position in Singapore is very unlike\r\n\r\nthat  in  the Borneo territories where the  local-born  out-number  the  residents  and  where   the\r\n\r\ngreater   proportion   of   the   local-born   are\r\n\r\nindigenous.  An  automatic  grant  of   Federation\r\n\r\ncitizenship  in  the situation  obtaining  in  the\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories  does  less  violence  to  the\r\n\r\napplication  of Federation citizenship  laws.  But\r\n\r\nthe  irony  of  it  is that the people  of  Borneo\r\n\r\nthemselves  should  want  merger  with  a  greater\r\n\r\ndegree of local autonomy than that accorded to the\r\n\r\nconstituent eleven States of the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also referred to the\r\n\r\nConstitution   (Amendment)  Act  of   1962   which\r\n\r\nmaterially  altered the citizenship provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  Constitution.  He  inquired   if\r\n\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  be  asked to opt entry into the Federation\r\n\r\non  a  basis  much worse than that of any  of  the\r\n\r\nother eleven States which entered in 1957, because\r\n\r\nof   these  additional  provisions  of  the   1962\r\n\r\nConstitution (Amendment) Act. Sir, of course, this\r\n\r\nis  a rhetorical question and would be the sort of\r\n\r\nquestion  which one who did not want merger  would\r\n\r\nask.  Article  14  of the Federation  Constitution\r\n\r\nprovided   that  every  person  born  within   the\r\n\r\nFederation  on  or after Merdeka Day  would  be  a\r\n\r\ncitizen  by  operation of law. The effect  of  the\r\n\r\namendment  is to modify the principle of  the  jus\r\n\r\nsoli,  the  refusal  of  an  automatic  grant   of\r\n\r\nFederation citizenship by operation of the law  to\r\n\r\npersons born in the Federation on or after Merdeka\r\n\r\nDay, neither of whose parents are citizens of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  and  neither of whom  is  a  permanent\r\n\r\nresident  therein. Persons born in the  Federation\r\n\r\nbefore  this  amendment to Article  14  came  into\r\n\r\nforce  and persons who would as a result  of  this\r\n\r\namendment  not  be a citizen of  any  country  are\r\n\r\nexpressly   excepted.  There  were  formerly   two\r\n\r\nexceptions to the principle of the jus soli  which\r\n\r\ngranted  citizenship by operation  of  law  on  or\r\n\r\nafter  Merdeka Day. These were in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nchild of an envoy of a sovereign power to the Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Agong and the child of an enemy  alien\r\n\r\nborn  in  any  place under enemy occupation.  This\r\n\r\nconstitutional amendment added a third  exception,\r\n\r\nnamely,  a  child  born  after  the  coming   into\r\n\r\noperation  of New Clause 2 of Article 14,  neither\r\n\r\nof  whose  parents was a citizen of the Federation\r\n\r\nand  neither  of  whom  was a  permanent  resident\r\n\r\ntherein. The Constitution (Amendment) Act of  1962\r\n\r\nalso repealed Article 17 of the Constitution which\r\n\r\nauthorises  registration  as  a  citizen  on   the\r\n\r\ngrounds of long residence starting before the 31st\r\n\r\nAugust,  1957. This amendment was made to  conform\r\n\r\nto  the usual practice that citizenship should  be\r\n\r\nobtained    by   naturalisation   and    not    by\r\n\r\nregistration, by all those who claim  to  acquire\r\n\r\ncitizenship  on  the ground that  they  have  made\r\n\r\ntheir permanent homes in the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation is an independent sovereign\r\n\r\nState, and is free to make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  laws as it deems fit in respect of  its  own\r\n\r\ncitizens.  If  it is contended by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson that this whittling down of the jus soli  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  those  born in the Federation  on  or\r\n\r\nafter  Merdeka  Day would also  be  applicable  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens,  if  there  is  merger   with\r\n\r\nautomatic conversion of citizenship, does  he  not\r\n\r\nadvance  this argument for the purpose of opposing\r\n\r\nmerger?  Of  course, his purpose in  referring  to\r\n\r\nthis  amendment  to Article 14 of  the  Federation\r\n\r\nConstitution is to pretend that any form of merger\r\n\r\nfor Singapore after this amendment will be on less\r\n\r\nfavourable terms than the terms of merger accorded\r\n\r\nto  the  eleven States of the Federation in  1957.\r\n\r\nBut  this  is  not  a rational  argument  as  this\r\n\r\nmodification of the jus soli is now  in  force  in\r\n\r\nall   the  States  of  the  Federation.  Even   if\r\n\r\nSingapore   is   to  be  merged   with   automatic\r\n\r\nconversion of citizenship, it could have no  legal\r\n\r\nentitlement  to  more favourable consideration  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the jus soli. It is quite clear  from\r\n\r\nwhat  the Member for Anson has said in respect  of\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution (Amendment) Act of 1962 that  he\r\n\r\nopposes  merger and that his contention  that  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  proposals should be improved  and  a\r\n\r\ncommon citizenship granted so that the majority of\r\n\r\nthe people would make common cause in an effort to\r\n\r\nachieve integration with the Federation on a basis\r\n\r\nof  common citizenship, is just a smoke-screen  to\r\n\r\nhide  the hypocrisy of the stand. Like the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis he opposes any form of merger, but he has\r\n\r\nnot got the courage to say so openly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have quoted many examples to show that\r\n\r\nthere are good precedents for placing a choice  of\r\n\r\nquestions  to  the electorate on the  question  of\r\n\r\nmerger  which  would  take  account  of  what  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, the Member for  Anson  and  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim have said should be the  basis\r\n\r\non  which  there  should be a  merger.  I  do  not\r\n\r\npropose  to  repeat  what has been  said  in  this\r\n\r\ndebate.  There  is no good reason  why  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper proposals should be the only proposals to be\r\n\r\nplaced to the electorate in the coming referendum.\r\n\r\nI ask the House to reject the amendment to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's motion moved by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,     Sir,    the    P.A.P.    Government's\r\n\r\nconstitutional  arrangement is unreasonable.  This\r\n\r\nhas been known by the people of Singapore and flow\r\n\r\nthe true facts have become clarified, that is, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  merger  plan is a  sell-out.  Today  the\r\n\r\nattitude of the people towards the P.A.P. is  not\r\n\r\nonly  centred  on the question of merger.  On  the\r\n\r\nother hand, whether the P.A.P. Government has  got\r\n\r\nthe  right to govern, it has expressed its doubts,\r\n\r\nbecause its so-called phoney merger plan cannot be\r\n\r\ncovered  by its excuses. They shout the slogan  of\r\n\r\nindependence  through merger  and  the  coming  of\r\n\r\nprosperity,  but  all  these  schemes  have   been\r\n\r\nexposed  by  the people and the interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore will be subordinated to  those\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation Government, and the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  do  not  have their  basic  citizenship\r\n\r\nrights,  equal citizenship rights. It  is  another\r\n\r\nkind  of  colonial domination - this kind of  merger\r\n\r\nwhereby  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  from\r\n\r\ntaxation  and revenue will be handed over  to  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Government. Once again this  has  exposed\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. scheme and it has created doubts in the\r\n\r\npeople's minds. Their merger scheme is only for  a\r\n\r\nfew leaders in the P.A.P. They have got the S.P.A.\r\n\r\nto support them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the national referendum\r\n\r\nshould  be  used  to ascertain the  views  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  on  the questions on the merger  proposals\r\n\r\npassed  by this House. The people should have  the\r\n\r\nright  to  accept or reject any proposal which  is\r\n\r\npassed by this House. That is the true meaning  of\r\n\r\na  national referendum. That is why the Government\r\n\r\nshould pose only its White Paper proposals to  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  not two questions. These White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposals   were  negotiated  by   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the  Federation,  and  they  were\r\n\r\npassed  by  this  House with the  support  of  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. and U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlast  year.  Since the P.A.P. has the  support  of  the\r\n\r\nRight-wing Party of the Assembly for its Command  Paper\r\n\r\nNo.  33,  this has made the people of this  State  more\r\n\r\nconfused. Therefore, the P.A.P. leadership, in order to\r\n\r\nsave the political situation, let the people decide  on\r\n\r\nthe  referendum  issue. Now we can see that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has brought up two questions to let the people\r\n\r\nchoose.  He  has brought up this proposal as  posed  in\r\n\r\nPaper  Command No. 33. He does not let the  people  say\r\n\r\nyes  or  no  to this White Paper Command  No.  33.  His\r\n\r\nintention  is  to confuse the people. We  have  already\r\n\r\nmade  all-out  efforts  in this House  to  caution  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  not to suppress the people into acceptance;\r\n\r\notherwise  they  will have to face the consequences  of\r\n\r\ntheir act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, since this motion was brought\r\n\r\nup  we have debated it for two days. We have been  very\r\n\r\ndisappointed. The Marxist and Leninist followers  have\r\n\r\ndefended their arguments by means of logic. Let me now,\r\n\r\nas  an  outsider, use common sense to  talk  about  the\r\n\r\npurpose of their amendment. Everything is divided  into\r\n\r\ntwo   aspects.  One  is  constructive;  the  other   is\r\n\r\ndestructive.  From the basis of the  question,  we  can\r\n\r\nreach the aim we want to achieve. Let me talk about the\r\n\r\nfactors  involved in the constructive aspect. First  of\r\n\r\nall,  we must understand where the basic question lies.\r\n\r\nSecondly, what should be our objective and the shape of\r\n\r\nour  objectives. Who is more adamant in pushing through\r\n\r\nthe  proposals? On the contrary, if their arguments are\r\n\r\nbased  on  the  destructive aspect, then  it  would  be\r\n\r\ndishonest.  You  want to find the  true  cause  of  the\r\n\r\nmatter and not to find fault. We should not destroy  in\r\n\r\norder  to achieve our purpose. In the two days'  debate\r\n\r\nwe have seen more clearly the purpose of the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown's  amendment. There is  no  honesty  in  the\r\n\r\namendment. To put it simply, the main purpose is not as\r\n\r\nappears in the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me explain the balance of interests in the\r\n\r\nmatter. We know that if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  person wants to corrupt or destroy a matter,  it  is\r\n\r\neasy  for him. Conversely, if you want to do it from  a\r\n\r\nconstructive  point of view and you want to  prevent  a\r\n\r\nthing from being destroyed and not to be changed in its\r\n\r\nappearance, it is not an easy thing. For example, if we\r\n\r\nhave  a  white cloth and we want to dirty it purposely,\r\n\r\nwe  can do it within a second. If we want to destroy  a\r\n\r\nvery grand building, that process will not require more\r\n\r\nthan two seconds. If we want to restore it back to  its\r\n\r\noriginal appearance, it is a difficult and long process\r\n\r\nand a lot of methods have to be adopted in order to  do\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk further. Today the merger between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaya - it is just like a foetus not  yet\r\n\r\nborn. Those people with malicious intentions will  wish\r\n\r\nthat the foetus is a female. This is not correct and it\r\n\r\nis  malicious. In our understanding, if the  foetus  is\r\n\r\nborn, whether it is complete or not, wholesome or  not,\r\n\r\nit will depend on whether the parents are healthy. This\r\n\r\nis  a  point of view. From here, we can understand that\r\n\r\nin  this amendment it has been stated very clearly that\r\n\r\nits   purpose  is  to  achieve  the  reunification   of\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation of Malaya through  merger.\r\n\r\nThe first thing is through the White Paper method, that\r\n\r\nis,  preserving the labour and education autonomy.  The\r\n\r\nother  method  is  unconditional merger  and  Singapore\r\n\r\nbecoming a component part of the Federation as any  one\r\n\r\nof the other 11 States of the Federation.

I\r\n\r\nwas  talking  about the second point, i.e.,  about  the\r\n\r\nforms  to be chosen to achieve merger between Singapore\r\n\r\nand the Federation. Earlier I also said that what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  want  now  is  to find out in which  form  our\r\n\r\npurpose should be achieved. But it is a matter for\r\n\r\nregret that the Barisan Sosialis have been beating\r\n\r\nabout  the bush and saying that this motion  could\r\n\r\nnot  achieve  their wishes. In the course  of  the\r\n\r\ndebate  in the past two days, we have been hearing\r\n\r\nonly  such  phrases as \"sell-out\", \"undemocratic\".\r\n\r\nBut  the  truth will come out in due  course.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  have  not  substantiated  their\r\n\r\narguments.  They  have not advanced  any  concrete\r\n\r\nevidence to support their arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to criticise a Bill,\r\n\r\nthat  is  something you can do in different  ways.\r\n\r\nLet  me  give an example. For instance, a girl;  a\r\n\r\nperson  criticises  a  girl; from  a  constructive\r\n\r\npoint  of  view, he can say the girl is  beautiful\r\n\r\nand  can  even describe her as a fairy or goddess.\r\n\r\nBut  if  a  person is malicious, he can very  well\r\n\r\ndescribe  that girl as a devil, or  some  kind  of\r\n\r\ngoblin, or a witch. Now, to take the first person;\r\n\r\nhis   criticism   is  more  or  less   with   good\r\n\r\nintentions. But the latter one is not so. That  is\r\n\r\nwhy   in  respect  of  our  proposals,  the  first\r\n\r\nquestion  posed is to ascertain the views  of  the\r\n\r\npeople and to get their constructive views. But as\r\n\r\nfor the second person mentioned, his intention  is\r\n\r\nto  try  to  destroy, to create  misunderstanding,\r\n\r\nhatred  and a bad impression in the minds  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, and to try to confuse and mislead them, so\r\n\r\nas  to  achieve their own ends. Libel and  slander\r\n\r\ncan,  perhaps,  prevail for a  short  period,  but\r\n\r\ntruth  will  ultimately triumph. We can  also  say\r\n\r\nthat  truth will never be killed or destroyed.  We\r\n\r\ncan  positively say that in 1959, we had a mandate\r\n\r\nfrom  the people. That is why today we have a duty\r\n\r\nto  fulfil this mandate from the people.  What  we\r\n\r\nare  concerned with is the livelihood and  welfare\r\n\r\nof  the  people.  We  do not mind  the  slanderous\r\n\r\nstatements  made of the Party and of its  members.\r\n\r\nThat  is  how responsible citizens should  behave.\r\n\r\nHere,  let me quote a Chinese poem to explain  our\r\n\r\nintention.  It  is written by Wen Tien  Hsiang,  a\r\n\r\nChinese poet. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In one's life, death is always waiting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should bare our hearts to show our intentions\r\n\r\nclean.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat should be our intention and our attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the inception of\r\n\r\nour  Party, we have repeatedly stressed  that  our\r\n\r\nParty  is  a  non-Communist Party. In the  present\r\n\r\nsituation,  our  political  opponents  have   been\r\n\r\nsaying that we are anti-Communist. If we have been\r\n\r\nanti-Communist, then it must be so because we want\r\n\r\nto  defend ourselves. Everybody has the  right  to\r\n\r\ndefend  himself  especially when it  concerns  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, let me caution those who play with fire.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a saying that these who play with  fire\r\n\r\nwill be burnt by fire. I would especially like  to\r\n\r\nremind the Member for Anson of this. I recall that\r\n\r\nhe  asked  a  question  in this  House  about  the\r\n\r\nrefugees  fleeing into Hongkong from m  China.  He\r\n\r\nappeared to be very concerned about them. I  would\r\n\r\nsay   that  we  are  not  the  comrades  of  these\r\n\r\nrefugees.  We are not concerned with  events  that\r\n\r\ntake place in China because these are all internal\r\n\r\nmatters of Communist China and have nothing to  do\r\n\r\nwith  us. Our duty is to protect and to take  care\r\n\r\nof our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is another point\r\n\r\nwhich  we cannot understand. The Member for Anson,\r\n\r\nin   the  one  hand,  has  strongly  attacked  the\r\n\r\nCommunists in this House and, on the other  hand,\r\n\r\nhe  has  been supporting the people who  are  pro-Peking.  That is something which is very difficult\r\n\r\nto understand. What we are concerned with today is\r\n\r\nthe  security of our State. We should not let  the\r\n\r\nsame tragedy which happened in Communist China  to\r\n\r\nhappen here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before concluding, let me quote a moral from\r\n\r\nAesop's Fables to remind the Member for Anson, \"Do\r\n\r\nnot  carry  a  frozen snake in  your  bosom.\"  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, Sir, as regards the  survival  of\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson, we do not care. What we care\r\n\r\nfor  is  the  interest and the livelihood  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. That is very important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, from the motion tabled by the\r\n\r\nPrime\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister,  we  can  prove the  dishonesty  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   Government.   This   also   negates   the\r\n\r\npropaganda about the merger plan in the past year.\r\n\r\nAll  this completely exposes their dishonesty.  We\r\n\r\nhave  also proved that the P.A.P. do not  dare  to\r\n\r\nput their merger proposals to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. merger proposals alone will not be\r\n\r\nsubmitted   to  the  people  for  their  decision.\r\n\r\nInstead the Government will pose two questions for\r\n\r\nthe  people  to  choose. Apart from  the  original\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper merger proposals, the other  question\r\n\r\nis  the so-called unconditional merger. But may we\r\n\r\nask  what  is  meant by the phrase  \"unconditional\r\n\r\nmerger\"?   Has   any   detailed   plan   on   this\r\n\r\nunconditional merger been submitted to this  House\r\n\r\nfor a decision?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from the statements and\r\n\r\nspeeches  of the Ministers and the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nthe  so-called unconditional merger will be  worse\r\n\r\nthan the White Paper merger proposals proposed  by\r\n\r\nthe   Government.  We  would  not  only  not  have\r\n\r\nautonomy  in labour and education, but,  according\r\n\r\nto  the  Prime Minister and the Minister for  Law,\r\n\r\nhalf  the  non-local  born citizens  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould lose their citizenship rights under this so-called  unconditional  merger.  This  is  a   very\r\n\r\nshameful  act on the part of the P.A.P.  Ministers\r\n\r\nand the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister and the\r\n\r\nother Government Ministers have found out that the\r\n\r\npeople of this country will not accept their White\r\n\r\nPaper  merger proposals. That is why they have  to\r\n\r\nthink  of all sorts of ways and means to  try  and\r\n\r\ndistort the stand of the Barisan Sosialis  on  the\r\n\r\nmerger issue. Our demand is for a real merger,  an\r\n\r\nequal merger, under which the 624,000 citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   will   automatically  become   Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens.  And the Government Ministers  say  that\r\n\r\nthis  demand  is  not reasonable. They  have  even\r\n\r\nspoken   on  behalf  of  the  Prime  Minister   of\r\n\r\nSingapore   saying  that  he  cannot  accept   the\r\n\r\nautomatic conversion of the 624,000 citizens  into\r\n\r\nFederal citizens. The Prime Minister has said that\r\n\r\nthe  worth of the citizenship rights of  the  non-local  born citizens is only one dollar.  The  so-called\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister,  who  represents  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  is  really  insulting  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. leaders have\r\n\r\nnot  only  distorted the stand of our  Party,  but\r\n\r\nthey  have  also  insulted the reputation  of  the\r\n\r\n624,000 citizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the fact that they were elected by\r\n\r\nthe  people  to  become  the  Prime  Minister  and\r\n\r\nMinisters, we can see very clearly from their past\r\n\r\nbehaviour  and performance that their continuation\r\n\r\nin  office  is  illegal. All the actions  and  the\r\n\r\nmeasures taken by the Government in the past  will\r\n\r\nnot  become valid. The P.A.P. were elected by  the\r\n\r\npeople,  but today they have considered  that  the\r\n\r\ncitizenship  right  of the  people  is  worth  one\r\n\r\ndollar  and  that the people are not qualified  to\r\n\r\nbecome Federal citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the constitutional\r\n\r\narrangements before us today have been proposed by\r\n\r\nthe  PAP.  Government. They are  embodied  in  the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper merger proposals which were passed  by\r\n\r\nthis House sometime ago. Therefore, the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  should have the right to say  \"yes\"  or\r\n\r\n\"no\"  to  the constitutional arrangements proposed\r\n\r\nby the Government. The question to be posed to the\r\n\r\npeople  should be the White Paper merger proposals\r\n\r\nput  forward by the P.A.P. We hope that the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   will   not   bring   forward    another\r\n\r\nproposal-the so-called unconditional merger.  They\r\n\r\nshould not pose another question so that when  the\r\n\r\npeople  go to vote, they will not be able  to  say\r\n\r\n\"yes\"  or \"no\" to the questions posed. Their blank\r\n\r\nvotes will be construed as votes in favour of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's merger proposals. Therefore,  we  are\r\n\r\nof the opinion that the P.A.P. and their Ministers\r\n\r\nare not honest. They will be malicious if they try\r\n\r\nto pose these questions. These questions are posed\r\n\r\nfor  the  sake  of  a few Ministers.  We  strongly\r\n\r\noppose  this sort of national referendum in  which\r\n\r\ntwo questions are to be posed to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, earlier on we have heard the Prime Minister say in his speech that he also\r\n\r\naccepted the amendment proposed by the Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill. This amendment is such that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen the two questions are posed, there will be  a\r\n\r\nthird  alternative question. That is,  the  people\r\n\r\nwill   be  asked  to  choose  another  alternative\r\n\r\nquestion. That is \"to enter Malaysia on  terms  no\r\n\r\nless  favourable  than the terms  for  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories\". From the Prime Minister's acceptance\r\n\r\nof  the  Member for Cairnhill's amendment, we  can\r\n\r\nonce   again  expose  their  behaviour  and  their\r\n\r\nmotives.  We do not know at present what  are  the\r\n\r\nmerger  conditions  for the three  territories  in\r\n\r\nBorneo.

The\r\n\r\nGovernment's  action was completely dishonest  and\r\n\r\nshowed their true colours too. I want to point out\r\n\r\nto  the  Member for Cairnhill that he  should  not\r\n\r\nthink  that by bringing up this amendment  he  can\r\n\r\nconfuse the people in regard to the proposals  for\r\n\r\nmerger.  The merger stand of the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\ndoes not permit any distortion by other people. In\r\n\r\nthe  past,  the  P.A.P. Ministers  and  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, and the P.A.P. Political Bureau used all\r\n\r\nmeasures  and  made  all efforts  to  distort  our\r\n\r\nstand.  The Prime Minister even went to the extent\r\n\r\nof saying that in his merger proposal, the meaning\r\n\r\nof \"citizen\" and \"national\" is the same and that a\r\n\r\ncitizen enjoys the same rights as a national. This\r\n\r\nhas  already been clearly seen by the people,  and\r\n\r\nnow   they  are  trying  to  distort  our   stand.\r\n\r\nConversely, although the Ministers and  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister continue to distort our stand, they  have\r\n\r\nmade  the people understand more about our  stand.\r\n\r\nTheir  efforts to distort our stand have  not  had\r\n\r\nany good result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I would like to reiterate the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  stand. The people of the two territories\r\n\r\nshould  have  equal rights, that is,  when  merger\r\n\r\ncomes,  and  all the citizens of Singapore  should\r\n\r\nautomatically become citizens of the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  Secondly, there should  be  proportionate\r\n\r\nrepresentation in the Federal Parliament. If these\r\n\r\nconditions  are not acceptable to the  Federation,\r\n\r\nwe  suggest a closer relationship between the  two\r\n\r\nterritories,  that the people of Singapore  should\r\n\r\nreach  a basis of confederation. This is the stand\r\n\r\nwe   have   been  advocating  to  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. We do not allow anybody to distort this\r\n\r\nstand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister for Law,\r\n\r\nin  his  speech, quoted many laws  passed  by  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  governments to show that if merger  were\r\n\r\nto  take place, the people of Singapore would  not\r\n\r\nautomatically become citizens of the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  If that is the logic of the P.A.P.,  then\r\n\r\nwe say that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. leaders have completely regarded  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  laws as true, and in doing so they  have\r\n\r\nacted contrary to the people's wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance also repeated in his speech\r\n\r\nthat the merger plan was very good. At  the same   time,\r\n\r\nhe  also  advocated   the   unequal citizenship rights in\r\n\r\nthe merger proposal. In  the past, we have pointed out\r\n\r\nthat the P.A.P.'s merger\r\n\r\nproposal,  if it were to be realised,  would  make\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore second-class  citizens,\r\n\r\ni.e.,  in  the  arrangement  of  the  P.A.P. type\r\n\r\nmerger, the people of Singapore will have only the\r\n\r\nright  to  get the same passport as  that  of the\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  the Federation and will also  enable\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government to conscript our youth.\r\n\r\nCan  the citizens of our State move freely in  the\r\n\r\ncountry?  Can the people of Singapore  under  this\r\n\r\ntype  of  arrangement have the right to apply  for\r\n\r\nlands   in   Johore  for  cultivation?   Can   the\r\n\r\nunemployed  in  Singapore have equal opportunities\r\n\r\nof getting jobs as the citizens of the Federation?\r\n\r\nThese are questions which cannot be replied to  by\r\n\r\nthem.  The Finance Minister just now only repeated\r\n\r\nhis  past  statements, but  he  has  not  told  us\r\n\r\nwhether  after merger we will have common benefits\r\n\r\nand  rights  as the citizens of the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  These  are  questions which  they  cannot\r\n\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now we also heard the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Parliamentary Secretaries saying  that\r\n\r\nwe  have gone against the original merger stand of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. We do not know what they were pointing\r\n\r\nat.  For example, in the past we have pointed  out\r\n\r\nthe reason why the P.A.P. has gone down to such  a\r\n\r\nlow level now. The main reason is that the P.A.P. has only adopted a policy planned by a few leaders\r\n\r\nin  the  P.A.P.  We know there  is  no  democratic\r\n\r\ndiscussion  in the P.A.P., and what a good  merger\r\n\r\nplan  is like. From the announcement of the Member\r\n\r\nfor Bras Basah when she left the P.A.P. we can see\r\n\r\nthis.  She  said, \"I do not want to think  of  one\r\n\r\nthing any say another thing as I did and had to do\r\n\r\nwhen  I was in the P.A.P.\" The P.A.P. Members  say\r\n\r\nthings without any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconscience. The Member for Bras Basah pointed  out\r\n\r\nvery  clearly in her announcement that there  were\r\n\r\nonly  a few leaders in the P.A.P. who had any  say\r\n\r\nin  policy matters. Now, the P.A.P. has come  down\r\n\r\nto  this low level and yet these few leaders still\r\n\r\nhave  not repented and listened to the people.  So\r\n\r\nwe  can  say that the Prime Minister is  a  clever\r\n\r\nperson. The Minister for Law is one who knows  the\r\n\r\nlaw.  They  should  not  use  the  law  itself  to\r\n\r\nobliterate their future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang) (In Mandarin):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, in the past the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  reminded  Members  of this  House  that  when\r\n\r\nplaying games one should keep to the rules of  the\r\n\r\ngames.   But  today  the  P.A.P.  Government   has\r\n\r\nentirely  acted  against  such  rules.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the  motion  before this  House  today  is\r\n\r\ncompletely contrary to the spirit of democracy and\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution.  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, on the 24th of September last year, at a\r\n\r\nPress conference held at Radio Singapore, promised\r\n\r\nthat  the people of Singapore could express  their\r\n\r\nviews on the P.A.P.'s White Paper on merger  in  a\r\n\r\nreferendum.   But  today the  Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\nentirely forgotten about his promises made in  the\r\n\r\npast.  Instead, he asks the people of Singapore to\r\n\r\nchoose from the three unacceptable proposals,  one\r\n\r\ncontaining  the  P.A.P. type  of  White  Paper  on\r\n\r\nmerger.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister,  in\r\n\r\nmoving  his motion yesterday, said this.   Let  me\r\n\r\nquote  what the Prime Minister said yesterday - this\r\n\r\nis the Nanyang Siang Pau of the 10th of July:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When faced with the White Paper proposals and a\r\n\r\ncomplete merger like Penang and Johore and another\r\n\r\nmerger   proposal  not  inferior  to  the   merger\r\n\r\nconditions   for  Borneo  territories   as   their\r\n\r\nchoices,   the people would definitely choose  the\r\n\r\nWhite   Paper   on   merger  in  an   overwhelming\r\n\r\nmajority.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, that is the intrigue behind the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's motion.  That is the way he  has\r\n\r\nset  a  trap in order to let the people fall  into\r\n\r\nit.  From this quotation of the Prime Minister, we\r\n\r\ncan  fish out the motives and the scheming of  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister in this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  mentioned the  White  Paper  merger\r\n\r\nproposals.  I  do  not intend  to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\ncontents of the White Paper, but I would  like  to\r\n\r\npoint  out  to  you  that Paper  Command  33,  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  arrangements  arrived  at  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government and the Federation  Government,\r\n\r\nwas  introduced to this House on the 15th November\r\n\r\nand  the  House was asked to decide on this  White\r\n\r\nPaper  arrived at by the Governments  of  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories. Later, with the support of the S.P.A.\r\n\r\nfellow  travellers,  these White  Paper  proposals\r\n\r\nwere approved by this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before the passage of this\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper,  the P.A.P. Government  had  exerted\r\n\r\ntheir  utmost  in giving wide publicity  to  their\r\n\r\nWhite Paper proposals. The Ministry of Culture was\r\n\r\nused  as  propaganda machinery for the  P.A.P. to\r\n\r\npublicise  the  White  Paper  proposals  in   four\r\n\r\nlanguages.   The   Ministry  of  Culture   printed\r\n\r\nthousands and thousands of pamphlets on the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  on merger for distribution to many  people.\r\n\r\nThe  travelling  vans of the Ministry  of  Culture\r\n\r\nwent   to  various  places  to  distribute   these\r\n\r\npamphlets. From this we can know very clearly that\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore are rather clear about the\r\n\r\ncontents  of  this  White  Paper  on  merger.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment have achieved the purpose they want  in\r\n\r\ntheir  propaganda activities. But  today,  we  see\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. and the Prime Minister have  not\r\n\r\nthe  guts  to  carry  out what they  promised  the\r\n\r\npeople  on 24th September last year, that  is,  to\r\n\r\nlet  the people decide whether they want to accept\r\n\r\nthis  White Paper on merger. The P.A.P. think that\r\n\r\nautonomy  in labour and education, as embodied  in\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper, would receive the support of the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the  workers  and  the  Chinese   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government have also made use of the State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General to issue statements to  say  that\r\n\r\nthe terms \"citizen\" and \"national\" are the same in\r\n\r\nmeaning, but all these propaganda activities  have\r\n\r\nfailed  the P.A.P. because the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nhave come to know the actual contents of the White\r\n\r\nPaper on merger, and that is why everywhere\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe people are opposing the conditions as embodied\r\n\r\nin  the  White  Paper. The P.A.P. leadership  have\r\n\r\nalso  got  wind of this information and they  have\r\n\r\ncome  to  realise that if they were  to  put  this\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  on merger to the people  to  decide,\r\n\r\nthen  it would be like an earthen cow dropped into\r\n\r\nthe  ocean never to come back again. It has become\r\n\r\na   foregone  case  for  them.  That  is  why   in\r\n\r\nintroducing the motion the Prime Minister has  not\r\n\r\nposed only one question to the people. Instead  he\r\n\r\nhas  proposed two questions: one is a complete and\r\n\r\nunconditional merger on an equal basis  as  Penang\r\n\r\nand  Malacca, which he has turned into the present\r\n\r\n(b) proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, our stand on merger was clearly enunciated\r\n\r\nduring  the time when we were debating the  merger\r\n\r\nproposals in this House and on other occasions.  I\r\n\r\nam  not  prepared to go into details and to repeat\r\n\r\nso  many  things already uttered by my colleagues,\r\n\r\nbut  I  would  like to point out  clearly  to  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership our stand on  merger.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  now to quote from Hansard, Volume 15, No.  5\r\n\r\nof  21st November last year, from a speech made by\r\n\r\nour  Party  Chairman  to explain  our  stand.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the Member for Queenstown,  in  the\r\n\r\nmiddle  of  column  400  to  column  401,  clearly\r\n\r\nenunciated our merger stand. I do not want to read\r\n\r\nall  the words there, but the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\njust now, when touching upon our Barisan stand  on\r\n\r\nmerger,  has distorted it. He has also quoted  out\r\n\r\nof  context. He has explained things according  to\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P. dictionary  and  has  entirely   and\r\n\r\ncompletely distorted our stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, columns 400 and 401 of this\r\n\r\nparticular Hansard have clearly stated our  stand,\r\n\r\nand  I will not repeat what the Member for Queenstown  has  said there. I would like only to  point\r\n\r\nout  that  the  P.A.P. Government  think  that  by\r\n\r\ndistorting  our  stand they  may  defeat  us.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, we have not changed  our  stand  on\r\n\r\nmerger. We will struggle to the end to secure  and\r\n\r\npreserve the basic and democratic rights which the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore now enjoy. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen  introducing  his motion the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid   that   he   unconditionally  accepted   the\r\n\r\namendment of the Member\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill - \"to enter Malaysia on terms no less\r\n\r\nfavourable   than  the  terms   for   the   Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories\".  Mr Speaker, Sir, I ask,  what  are\r\n\r\nthe terms for the Borneo territories? We are still\r\n\r\nin the dark. You will remember that yesterday when\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister was making a speech the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson asked him whether he could disclose the\r\n\r\nterms  of merger for the Borneo territories before\r\n\r\nthe  referendum  was  held,  but  he  evaded  that\r\n\r\nquestion. He did not give an answer to that.  From\r\n\r\nthis,  we  can see very clearly that the so-called\r\n\r\nterms  of  merger  for the Borneo territories  are\r\n\r\nworse  terms which the people of Singapore  cannot\r\n\r\naccept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you can see why the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  in his speech showed so much  confidence\r\n\r\nthat   the  people  would  overwhelmingly  support\r\n\r\nCommand  Paper 33 of 1961. Proposals (b)  and  (e)\r\n\r\nwill be worse than proposal (a). The people do not\r\n\r\nknow  what are the contents of proposals  (b)  and\r\n\r\n(c), but they do know that the poison in proposals\r\n\r\n(b)  and  (c)  is  worse than  that  contained  in\r\n\r\nproposal (a).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nyesterday  said that the White Paper proposals  on\r\n\r\nmerger  were the best the P.A.P. Government  could\r\n\r\nget,  but  strangely  enough,  he  introduced   an\r\n\r\namendment  as  another  proposal.  Why  should  he\r\n\r\nintroduce the third proposition when he knows full\r\n\r\nwell   that  such  a  proposition  will   not   be\r\n\r\nacceptable to the people of Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember that on Friday last\r\n\r\nthe House received the amendment of the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill. On Saturday, the Prime Minister and the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill went together to Kuala Lumpur\r\n\r\non  a pilgrimage to pay their homage there, and as\r\n\r\na  result  of this joint trip, the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\naccepted the amendment of the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nas  the  third alternative for the people to  vote\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill has\r\n\r\nsaid  many times that the interests of the  people\r\n\r\nand the State must come first before the interests\r\n\r\nof the political Parties. He has also prided\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhimself   on  the  fact  that  his  Party   is   a\r\n\r\nresponsible  Party and that he  is  a  responsible\r\n\r\nMember. He described the debate in this House as a\r\n\r\nbattle  between the P.A.P. and the ex-P.A.P.  This\r\n\r\nspecious  argument  of  the Member  for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nshould  be  rebutted. He said yesterday  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s merger proposals were the best that  they\r\n\r\ncould  get and yet he introduced another  proposal\r\n\r\nwhich  is worse than the P.A.P.'s proposal, hoping\r\n\r\nthat  he  could deceive and mislead the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  into  voting  for  either  alternative.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we can point out that the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  is not concerned with the  interest  of\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore; he is responsible to the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. only  and  not  to  the  people.   He   is\r\n\r\ninterested  in  saving the P.A.P. Government  from\r\n\r\ncollapsing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill knows\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P.'s White Paper  merger  proposals\r\n\r\nwill not be acceptable to the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nHe  says that if these proposals were to be put to\r\n\r\nthe  people, they would reject them. He termed the\r\n\r\nCommand  Paper 33 as a form of closer relationship\r\n\r\nbetween the two territories and not as merger. The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister of the Federation  of  Malaya  has\r\n\r\nissued  several statements to the Press confirming\r\n\r\nthat the present constitutional arrangement is not\r\n\r\nmerger but a closer partnership. I believe he  was\r\n\r\nvery  honest when he said that. However, the  Back\r\n\r\nand Front Benches of the Government have said that\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis are opposed to merger. But as\r\n\r\na  matter of fact, this is not merger. We have not\r\n\r\nseen  the Prime Minister and the Ministers of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. deny the statement by the Prime Minister  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya and the leaders of S.P.A.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we can clearly see that the P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nacquiesced in the fact that the White Paper merger\r\n\r\nproposals  are only a form of closer  relationship\r\n\r\nand  not  merger. But the P.A.P.'s  Ministers  and\r\n\r\nMembers always accuse us of having delayed  merger\r\n\r\nor  of  opposing merger. Their pretext and excuses\r\n\r\ncan   be   explained  only  by  their  own  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ndictionary.  The common run of the  people  cannot\r\n\r\naccept their explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister yesterday said\r\n\r\nthat  we,  the  Barisan Sosialis, have made  a  mistake\r\n\r\nabout  the so-called Penang and Malacca type of merger.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, let me quote the speech by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  He  said  that  the Barisan  Sosialis  later\r\n\r\nexpressed the hope that the citizens of Singapore could\r\n\r\nautomatically become citizens of Malaya. On this  point\r\n\r\nthey  had the support of the Member for Anson and  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong Lim. The Prime Minister  pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat if the constitutional documents could give support\r\n\r\nto   their   assertion  that  the  citizens  here   can\r\n\r\nautomatically become citizens of Malaya, then let it be\r\n\r\ndecided  by  impartial Judges. If these  constitutional\r\n\r\ndocuments  do not include these terms as the  basis  of\r\n\r\ntheir  arguments,  then  all these  arguments  will  be\r\n\r\nrejected.  What  he meant was that if  we  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis demand automatic conversion of citizens,  then\r\n\r\nwe  must find a constitutional precedent, otherwise our\r\n\r\ndemand will have to be rejected. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister is an expert on law, but when we debated\r\n\r\nthe National Referendum Bill and the question of merger\r\n\r\nin  this  House, their tactics were to cite precedents.\r\n\r\nWhen these precedents could not be found, they tried to\r\n\r\ndistort the stand of the Opposition. If that was of  no\r\n\r\navail to them, then they would say the Opposition  were\r\n\r\nCommunists or Communist stooges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us presume that what the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister said is correct; then at least we are able  to\r\n\r\nfind  one  precedent to show the P.A.P. that  there  is\r\n\r\nsuch  a  precedent.  You know that  the  administrative\r\n\r\nrights of the eleven States in the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\nare  vested in the Central Government, that is to  say,\r\n\r\nthey have no autonomy. You cannot find any autonomy  in\r\n\r\nany  of  the eleven States in the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\nBut  if,  according to the logic of the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nwe  can  find this precedent in the White Paper  merger\r\n\r\nproposals,  Singapore  will  become  a  State  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya. But according to the details  of\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper merger proposals Singapore will  have\r\n\r\nautonomy in labour and education, but this is not to be\r\n\r\nfound in other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStates  in the Federation of Malaya. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\ntherefore  we  can  see  very  clearly  that   if   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government can create  this  constitutional\r\n\r\nprecedent, why cannot our 624,000 citizens in Singapore\r\n\r\nbecome  citizens of the Federation of Malaya?  And,  in\r\n\r\nfact,   according  to  Articles  17  and  22   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution of the Federation of Malaya, the  citizens\r\n\r\nof  Singapore have all the necessary qualifications  to\r\n\r\nbecome citizens of the Federation of Malaya. Therefore,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, we can clearly see his  argument  in\r\n\r\ndefence of himself cannot hold water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister yesterday mentioned the letter which our Secretary-General wrote to the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya. Let me quote a small paragraph from this. The Prime Minister said, \"Any political Party in the Assembly can directly contact\r\n\r\nthe Government of the Federation of Malaya to negotiate\r\n\r\nfor better terms on the question of merger. As a matter\r\n\r\nof  fact, the Member for Cairnhill tried to do so,  and\r\n\r\nhe also knew the actual position. Similarly, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill also knew the views of the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation on this matter.  Even  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, which is controlled by the Communists through\r\n\r\ntheir  open  front organisations and their leader,  Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Ching Siong, publicly in April wrote to the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of  the  Federation of  Malaya.  Tunku  Abdul\r\n\r\nRahman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not intend to talk about the contents of the\r\n\r\nletter  between  Mr  Lim Ching  Siong  and  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of  the Federation of Malaya.  I  believe  my\r\n\r\nParty  Chairman  will  disclose the  contents  of  this\r\n\r\nletter  at  an  appropriate time. But what  I  want  to\r\n\r\nstress  here  is  that  the Prime Minister  accused  my\r\n\r\nSecretary-General  as  the leader  of  the  open  front\r\n\r\norganisations of the Communists. But the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation of Malaya, when questioned  by  the\r\n\r\nreporters,  said that he could not describe the  letter\r\n\r\nas  one  addressed to him by a Communist. He personally\r\n\r\nbelieved  that this letter could not be one sent  by  a\r\n\r\nCommunist.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, this  statement  of  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister of the Federation of Malaya was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublished on the 29th of March in the English Press and\r\n\r\nthe Chinese Press in big headlines. I wish to point out\r\n\r\nhere  that  the  Prime Minister of  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  openly  admitted that the letter  sent  by  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis was not  from\r\n\r\nthe  Communists. In other words, the Prime Minister  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya has admitted that my Secretary-General  is  not  a  Communist.  But  the  P.A.P.,  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  and  the Prime Minister have every  now  and\r\n\r\nthen accused us of being the stooges of the Communists,\r\n\r\nand  that  our Secretary-General is the leader  of  the\r\n\r\nopen  front organisations of the Communist Party.  From\r\n\r\nthe  statements of the two Prime Ministers, we can  see\r\n\r\nclearly  that the Prime Minister of Singapore  is  very\r\n\r\ndishonest.  He is now trying to use all sorts  of  ways\r\n\r\nand means to smear the leaders of the Barisan Sosialis,\r\n\r\nhoping  that  there might be some people who  could  be\r\n\r\nmisled  by  their  smears and their  intimidation.  His\r\n\r\nspeeches  are  intended  to  prevent  the  masses  from\r\n\r\nsupporting us. I wish to tell the Front-Benches and the\r\n\r\nBack-Benches  of the P.A.P. that their  smear  campaign\r\n\r\nwill  not  be able to prevent the broad masses  of  the\r\n\r\npeople front rallying to our side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Education talked at great\r\n\r\nlength.  I am delighted to hear from him. At least  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary in his speech  yesterday  also\r\n\r\nadmitted  that  our  stand on the  merger  question  is\r\n\r\ncorrect.   If,   my  memory  is  not   incorrect,   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary said that what  he  meant  was\r\n\r\nthat  the  624,000  citizens of  Singapore  can  become\r\n\r\ncitizens of the Federation of Malaya. He went on to say\r\n\r\nthey  would  not  trouble the Barisan Sosialis  to  put\r\n\r\nforth their merger proposals. From the speeches made by\r\n\r\nthe   Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation  it  proves  that our  stand  on  the  merger\r\n\r\nquestion  is  based  on the interests  of  the  624,000\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens. At the same time, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  also  confirmed this in the last radio  forum.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister for Finance described our merger proposal\r\n\r\nas a kind\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof super merger. Therefore, we can clearly see that our\r\n\r\nstand  on  merger is consistent. We have never  changed\r\n\r\nand  it is correct. But our stand has been deliberately\r\n\r\ndistorted by the P.A.P. It has been turned into  a  so-called  unconditional  merger. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore now pay a lot of attention to  the\r\n\r\noutcome  of the constitutional future of Singapore.  In\r\n\r\nthe   coming   referendum,  they  will  decide,   their\r\n\r\npolitical power in the future. Therefore, the amendment\r\n\r\nmoved  by the Member for Queenstown is the only way  to\r\n\r\nexpress  their views. I believe that since  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave  already made a lot of propaganda about the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntype of merger for about a year, they have not got  the\r\n\r\ntrust of the people. What the people want to decide now\r\n\r\nis  the merger proposal contained in Cmd. Paper 33. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, when I began my speech, I said  that  in\r\n\r\nplaying  games,  we  must follow the  rules.  Now,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and their fellow travellers, i.e., the  S.P.A.,\r\n\r\nhave  played a game not based on the rules. But I  will\r\n\r\ntell  them not to forget that when they play this  type\r\n\r\nof  game  without rules, they must remember  that  they\r\n\r\nhave 624,000 citizens as an audience watching them.  If\r\n\r\nthey   really   do  not  regard  the  consequences   as\r\n\r\nimportant,  and continue with this type of a  game  and\r\n\r\ndisregard the anger of these 624,000 people, then  they\r\n\r\nhad better consider the interests of these people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu) (In Mandarin): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the oligarchy of the P.A.P. has made  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of  tricks to popularise their merger plan.  But\r\n\r\nthis  merger  plan  is not acceptable  to  the  people.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  they  purposely distort the  stand  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis and try to smear it. They have already\r\n\r\nclouded  the  issue  by  their proposals  in  order  to\r\n\r\nconfuse  the people and reap some harvest  out  of  the\r\n\r\nconfusion. Mr Speaker, Sir, from the various steps  in\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P.'s  plan  on  merger,  we  know  they  have\r\n\r\ndistorted  the honest opinions of the Opposition.  They\r\n\r\nhave brought out two proposals which are almost similar\r\n\r\nin nature to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlet  the people choose. They have already told us  that\r\n\r\nthey  want to bring up two questions, but we feel  that\r\n\r\nboth  questions are the same and not beneficial to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Then, under such circumstances,  how  can  the\r\n\r\npeople  choose?  The intention of the P.A.P. has  been\r\n\r\ncontrary to what the Prime Minister has said previously\r\n\r\nat  various  Press conferences, that  is,  to  let  the\r\n\r\npeople decide on the merger issue. What should be  left\r\n\r\nto  the people to decide? What does this mean? That is,\r\n\r\nthe  people  should be allowed to say  `yes'  or  `no'.\r\n\r\nSince  the two questions in the motion are exactly  the\r\n\r\nsame,  the  P.A.P. leaders are afraid  of  putting  the\r\n\r\nmerger  proposal as contained in Cmd. Paper  33  to  be\r\n\r\ndecided by the people. Real gold will stand the test of\r\n\r\nthe touchstone. But the P.A.P. dare not put this to the\r\n\r\npeople  for approval or rejection. They have repeatedly\r\n\r\ndistorted our Barisan Sosialis stand on merger and they\r\n\r\nhave  included clauses like that of blank votes  to  be\r\n\r\ndeemed  as  in  favour of the Government's  view.  From\r\n\r\nthis, we can see that the Prime Minister's intention is\r\n\r\nto  push  through merger. This is a matter of \"Heads  I\r\n\r\nwin: tails you lose.\" This is a trick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to state here the basic\r\n\r\nstand  of  our  Barisan Sosialis. These few  days,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill  and the  P.A.P.  Members  have\r\n\r\ncontinued to distort our stand. I would like to clarify\r\n\r\na certain point. The P.A.P's oligarchy has insisted on\r\n\r\nputting the Malacca and Penang type of merger out,  and\r\n\r\nlet  labour  and education policies be decided  by  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government.  They  figure  this  is  what  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis want. This we have heard  repeatedly.\r\n\r\nThey  have  emphasised it many, many  times,  But  they\r\n\r\nstill  bite on it. What is the intention? The intention\r\n\r\nis  this.  If  they  can hoodwink the  people  on  this\r\n\r\nquestion,  they  can  bring up  two  questions  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum,  and  they can achieve their  purpose  very\r\n\r\neasily  in  this way. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Penang  and\r\n\r\nMalacca type of merger - whose proposal is it? In  August\r\n\r\n1961,  the  Barisan Sosialis already clearly  announced\r\n\r\npublicly  in the papers that we want to have a complete\r\n\r\nand  true merger immediately on the basis of the Penang\r\n\r\nand Malacca type of merger and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the citizens of Singapore should be automatically\r\n\r\nconverted  into  Federation citizens,  and  that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be proportionate representation in the  Central\r\n\r\nParliament. Our stand has been very firm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.44 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also very simple and clear. The White Paper on\r\n\r\nmerger in this House was brought out in November  1961.\r\n\r\nWe  have allowed a few months before the tabling of the\r\n\r\nmotion. Why do the P.A.P. want to distort our stand and\r\n\r\nsay  that  we advocate the Penang and Malacca  type  of\r\n\r\nmerger?   Why  do  they  not  talk  about  proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation and automatic conversion of citizenship?\r\n\r\nWe   want   Singapore  citizens  to  be   automatically\r\n\r\nconverted  into  Federal citizens. But the  P.A.P. say\r\n\r\nthat  in  this way we will sell out the rights of  over\r\n\r\nhalf  of the 624,000 Singapore citizens. We only quoted\r\n\r\nthe Penang and Malacca type as an example, but this has\r\n\r\nbeen  misconstrued  by others. The P.A.P. leaders  are\r\n\r\nvery  good at distorting other people's stand and  also\r\n\r\nquoting them out of context. They have manufactured the\r\n\r\nPenang  and  Malacca type of merger and have attributed\r\n\r\nit  to  the Barisan Sosialis. Fortunately the  Workers'\r\n\r\nParty in the Opposition has seen this clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all these facts bear out our\r\n\r\npast argument that the P.A.P. have tried to confuse the\r\n\r\npeople by bringing in two questions for merger. The two\r\n\r\nquestions to be posed are similar in nature. Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, if the P.A.P. oligarchy had observed  the\r\n\r\nrules  of  democracy  and were just,  they  would  have\r\n\r\nproposed  in the motion of the Prime Minister only  one\r\n\r\nquestion,  and  that  should be  the  question  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum for the people to decide. Unfortunately, our\r\n\r\nrequest was defeated by the P.A.P. and the S.P.A. out-voting us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, the definition of \"merger\" ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr G. Kandasamy): Point of order. I think we\r\n\r\nare short of a quorum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice taken that thirteen Members were not present,\r\n\r\nMembers summoned as if for a division pursuant to  the\r\n\r\nStanding  Order,  and meeting resumed  upon  a  quorum\r\n\r\nbeing then present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> We have a quorum flow.

The\r\n\r\nmeaning of merger is to unite two States together. Now,\r\n\r\nif  merger  between  Singapore and  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  is  to be a true merger, then it  should  be  a\r\n\r\nreunification   of   the  two  territories,   and   the\r\n\r\nGovernments  of the two territories should resolve  and\r\n\r\nthe  political  Parties of the two  territories  should\r\n\r\nface  the  people  and let them  decide  as  to  which\r\n\r\npolitical  Party can meet the wishes of the people,  so\r\n\r\nthat  a Central Government can be elected by the people\r\n\r\nof  the  two  territories, and the two territories  are\r\n\r\nthus  united  into one. That is what we  understand  by\r\n\r\nmerger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Member for Cairnhill expounded his\r\n\r\ntheories  in this House. But we the representatives  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore understand his attitude  very\r\n\r\nwell.  That is his usual practice. All his actions  are\r\n\r\ntaken with the motive of doing something at the expense\r\n\r\nof  the  people,  and  the  people  will  pass  correct\r\n\r\njudgment on him. Under British colonial directions, the\r\n\r\nmerger plan regarding the two territories has become  a\r\n\r\ncontroversial topic in the political arena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two types of people. One insists on abiding\r\n\r\nby  the will of the people. This is in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe wishes of the people. In other words, this type  of\r\n\r\npeople would seek a type of merger that is supported by\r\n\r\nand  wanted by the people. The other type of people  is\r\n\r\nlike  the  Member for Cairnhill and the P.A.P. Members.\r\n\r\nAll  their  activities are based on personal  interest.\r\n\r\nThey are used to fooling the people and to intimidating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand coercing them into accepting their schemes in order\r\n\r\nto   realise  their  purposes  and  so  to   help   the\r\n\r\ncolonialist plot succeed. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill is of this type. The  speech  he\r\n\r\nmade in this House yesterday mainly revolves round  the\r\n\r\npoint  that  it  is correct and proper  for  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  to  move a motion providing two  propositions\r\n\r\nfor  the  people to decide. From this we can  see  that\r\n\r\nthey are harping on the same tune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that when the White Paper\r\n\r\non  merger of the Government was introduced and debated\r\n\r\nin  this  House, it got the support of the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill. As a result of that support, it was  passed.\r\n\r\nWe  tried our best to boycott their scheme and  to  let\r\n\r\nthe people see through their scheming and to understand\r\n\r\nour  stand.  Now,  since the Member for  Cairnhill  has\r\n\r\nsupported  the White Paper on merger, why  has  he  not\r\n\r\npersuaded the P.A.P. Government to pose\r\n\r\nonly  one  question, i.e. on the White Paper on  merger\r\n\r\nalone?  Why should he allow the Government to pose  two\r\n\r\nor  more  questions? Perhaps it is because he  and  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Members are people of the same nature. It is  no\r\n\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nonce  again stressed his argument that the citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  would not become second-class  citizens  and\r\n\r\nthat  their type of merger has met with the  wishes  of\r\n\r\nthe  people.  I think he was only trying to  give  some\r\n\r\nreason  to  justify the posing of two  propositions  as\r\n\r\nmentioned in the motion. I  am sure all the people  know\r\n\r\nthat  all this is humbug, because in the past they have\r\n\r\nbeen  used to the terms \"citizens\" and \"nationals\" over\r\n\r\nRadio Singapore and at forums. Since according to  them\r\n\r\ncitizenship is similar to nationality, why should  they\r\n\r\nnot  straightaway  put their merger  proposals  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  for a decision? Their type of merger  does  not\r\n\r\nmeet  with the wishes of the people. According to their\r\n\r\nmerger  proposals, a  lot of people  will  lose  their\r\n\r\ncitizenship rights and one-quarter of our revenue  will\r\n\r\nbe given to the Central Government. That will amount to\r\n\r\n$90  million.  Our internal affairs  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\ncontrolled by the Central Government. I think  the  sum\r\n\r\nrequired  to be spent on the administration of internal\r\n\r\naffairs would amount\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  tens  of  millions of dollars. Why  should  we\r\n\r\ncontribute  more  than what is actually  required?\r\n\r\nFrom all this we can see that the arguments of the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance are not sound. By that  type\r\n\r\nof  merger  we will be giving away our rights  and\r\n\r\nmany  other things. On the other hand, we  do  not\r\n\r\nget  equal benefits. How could this type of merger\r\n\r\nbe  acceptable? Now I want to stress this  because\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance has said so many things.\r\n\r\nI  urge  the Prime Minister to withdraw his motion\r\n\r\nand  put his White Paper merger proposals  to  the\r\n\r\npeople as the sole question for them to decide so\r\n\r\nthat  we  may know whether his White Paper  merger\r\n\r\nproposals are good or bad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the words proposed to be\r\n\r\nleft out, be left out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 15; Noes, 28; Absent, 8.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<pre> \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Ayes.

Members will remember\r\n\r\nthat when we were debating the National Referendum\r\n\r\nBill   in  Committee  we  pointed  out   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   that  it  was  essential   that   the\r\n\r\nquestions  to  be  posed in the merger  referendum\r\n\r\nshould  be questions that have been fully  debated\r\n\r\nin  the Assembly and that they should embrace  all\r\n\r\npossible   and   practicable  forms   of   closer\r\n\r\nassociation  with the Federation  of  Malaya.  The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister in his motion has  suggested  two\r\n\r\nquestions. One is that of Command Paper 33 and the\r\n\r\nother  is complete and unconditional merger on  an\r\n\r\nequal  basis  with  the  other  eleven  states  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the constitutional  documents  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya. This the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nsays,  covers the stand of some of the  Opposition\r\n\r\nParties,  particularly  the  Workers'  Party,  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis and the U.P.P. Sir, the S.P.A. is\r\n\r\nindeed  very anxious that the referendum on merger\r\n\r\nshould   contain  all  possible  forms  of  closer\r\n\r\nassociation  and I therefore during the  Committee\r\n\r\nstage  of the National Referendum Bill brought  to\r\n\r\nthe notice of the House that I intended to move an\r\n\r\namendment posing a third question. I want it to be\r\n\r\nunderstood  in  this House lest the distortionists\r\n\r\nstart distorting again that the proposal that I am\r\n\r\nmoving now is not a S.P.A. question. It should not\r\n\r\nbe taken to be a S.P.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n             \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquestion  put into a merger referendum. It  should\r\n\r\nbe  taken  as  a contribution from the  S.P.A. to\r\n\r\nassist the Assembly to pose all possible forms  of\r\n\r\ncloser   association  for  the  decision  of   the\r\n\r\nelectorate.  The S.P.A. - Alliance  still  stand  by\r\n\r\nCommand Paper 33.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us now examine the three questions that\r\n\r\nare  before the House. The first question is  that\r\n\r\nof  Command  Paper 33. A full and  lengthy  debate\r\n\r\ntook  place  on the agreement reached between  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government and the  Government  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya.  Full  details   of   that\r\n\r\nagreement  have been published and are well  known\r\n\r\nto the electorate. The P.A.P. brought confusion to\r\n\r\nthe  minds  of  the electorate by describing  this\r\n\r\nform  of  agreement as merger. We have  said  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  nothing but a form of closer association\r\n\r\nand if the word \"merger\" is to be used, perhaps we\r\n\r\ncan describe the agreement reached between the two\r\n\r\nGovernments  as  a form of half merger.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nfirst step --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I trust the hon. Member is\r\n\r\nnot  reopening the debate on the Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nmotion. He can just touch on it in passing. I hope\r\n\r\nhe  is  not reopening the debate. He is moving  an\r\n\r\namendment. But I did make it very clear the debate\r\n\r\nshould  range  over not only the Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nmotion,  but  also the amendment proposed  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown and also the amendment which\r\n\r\nis now being proposed by the Member for Cairnhill,\r\n\r\nand the other two notions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\npropose to reopen the debate on command Paper  33.\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to point out to the House are the\r\n\r\nvarious  forms of closer association and  want  to\r\n\r\ntake my argument step by step. Command Paper 33 is\r\n\r\nhalf  merger.  Call  it  a  50  per  cent  merger.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   what   is  the  next   possible   and\r\n\r\npracticable   question?  That  is  proposal   (b),\r\n\r\ncomplete  and  unconditional merger  on  an  equal\r\n\r\nbasis  with  the  11  states  at  present  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation. That is something which the  public\r\n\r\nknow.  That  is something which we  all  know.  We\r\n\r\ncannot  as  an alternative ask for a 75  per  cent\r\n\r\nmerger or 125 per cent merger, because it will  be\r\n\r\nmeaningless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  electorate will not know what a 75  per  cent\r\n\r\nmerger is, or what a 125 per cent merger is.  They\r\n\r\nknow  what the White Paper is, and they know  what\r\n\r\ncomplete and unconditional merger is. It is indeed\r\n\r\nunfortunate that in this tussle between the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nand the ex-P.A.P. a lot of extraneous matters were\r\n\r\nbrought  into the debate to confuse the  minds  of\r\n\r\nthe electorate. The P.A.P. claims that proposition\r\n\r\n(b)  does  not mean automatic citizenship  rights;\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis claim that what they mean  by\r\n\r\ncomplete   and   unconditional   merger   includes\r\n\r\nautomatic citizenship right. All this argument  is\r\n\r\nunnecessary. The citizenship rights are spelt  out\r\n\r\nin  the constitution and there is no need for  the\r\n\r\nclever  wigs  of the P.A.P. to try to  give  their\r\n\r\ninterpretation of what the constitution means.  In\r\n\r\nthe same way, the Barisan should not try to do the\r\n\r\nsame thing. The Workers' Party representative, the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson,  tries  to  explain  his   own\r\n\r\ninterpretation,  and  his interpretation  is  such\r\n\r\nthat  not  one citizen of Singapore can  become  a\r\n\r\ncitizen  of  the Federation of Malaya, and  things\r\n\r\nare getting more and more ridiculous. It gets more\r\n\r\nand  more ridiculous through the unnecessary party\r\n\r\nwarfare  that has been waged over the question  of\r\n\r\nmerger  for a long, long time, so much so that  at\r\n\r\ntimes Members of the Assembly do get confused too.\r\n\r\nIf it is the desire of some Opposition Parties - the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis,  the  Workers'  Party  and  the\r\n\r\nU.P.P.   -  to  clamour  for  complete   and\r\n\r\nunconditional  merger, then it is up  to  them  to\r\n\r\nhold  referendum meetings to tell  the  electorate\r\n\r\nwhat  they  mean by what they want.  If  they  can\r\n\r\nconvince   the   electorate  that   complete   and\r\n\r\nconditional    merger,   even    with    automatic\r\n\r\ncitizenship rights, will mean that the citizens of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  when  they  become  citizens  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation, must accept all that is implied in the\r\n\r\nConstitution  of  the Federation of  Malaya  where\r\n\r\nprovision has been made for a number of things, it\r\n\r\nwould,  in my view, be difficult for the  citizens\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  to  accept  that  at  the  present\r\n\r\njuncture.  They  can have all the privileges  that\r\n\r\nthey  want,  but they must not overlook  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat they too must accept all the limitations that\r\n\r\nare   imposed  under  the  Constitution   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya. So if they were to  conduct\r\n\r\nreferendum meetings and present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  particular  case  in  a  straightforward  manner\r\n\r\nwithout  trying  to mislead the public  into  believing\r\n\r\nthat complete and unconditional merger is going just to\r\n\r\nmean  automatic citizenship rights for the citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, then the public would have been misled  into\r\n\r\nvoting for something which is not true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have heard it talked about in coffee shops and\r\n\r\nelsewhere by the opponents of Cmd. Paper 33 that it was\r\n\r\nnot right that the Singapore Government should accept a\r\n\r\nposition  of not having the same status as the  Bornean\r\n\r\nterritories. The opponents of Cmd. Paper 33, of course,\r\n\r\ntried  their best to confuse the electorate. They  said\r\n\r\nthat Cmd. Paper 33 would place Singapore in an inferior\r\n\r\nposition when compared with the position of any one  of\r\n\r\nthe Bornean territories, and because Malaysia is in the\r\n\r\nprocess   of   formation  and   because   the   Bornean\r\n\r\nterritories are coming into this association  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya and Singapore, therefore, I say it\r\n\r\nis but right that the electorate of Singapore should be\r\n\r\ngiven  the  opportunity to pass judgment on whether  or\r\n\r\nnot they prefer Singapore to enter Malaysia on terms no\r\n\r\nless  favourable than the terms offered to  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories.  I  do  not  know  which  political  Party\r\n\r\nrepresented in this Assembly would be wanting  to  take\r\n\r\nup  that  line  of closer relationship, but  it  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  free to those that have preached this line  of\r\n\r\nargument to hold referendum meetings and try to get the\r\n\r\npeople  to their line of thought and vote for  proposal\r\n\r\n(c), brought in by me as an amendment to the motion. To\r\n\r\nme,  Sir,  these are the only possible and  practicable\r\n\r\nforms of closer association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis have said that they have a\r\n\r\nfurther  proposal  to put forward, a  fourth  proposal,\r\n\r\nwhich  should  be  put as one of the questions  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum merger. We have not heard what that proposal\r\n\r\nis, but we are prepared to listen to what they have  to\r\n\r\nsay.  But if I, as an old Member of this Assembly,  can\r\n\r\ngive  a  little  bit of advice to the  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis,  if  they  want  their  case  to  be\r\n\r\nproperly, thoroughly and carefully considered, it would\r\n\r\nbe  in  their  interest  to present  their  case  in  a\r\n\r\nstraightforward, understandable manner without bringing\r\n\r\nin any extraneous matters like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is  trying to cheat  the  electorate,  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis is trying to look after the interests\r\n\r\nof  the  electorate, and that it is a Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nquestion.  Questions to be posed in a merger referendum\r\n\r\nshould  have  no party political content. It  is  vital\r\n\r\nthat  in the consideration of the questions to be posed\r\n\r\nin  a  referendum, the interests of the country  should\r\n\r\ncome  first, and that the questions to be posed  should\r\n\r\nbe   questions  that  are  easily  understood  by   the\r\n\r\nelectorate and that the proposal should be one that has\r\n\r\nsome  known  form.  It would be wrong  if  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  were  to  put  up a proposal  that  bears  no\r\n\r\nrelation  to  facts. It would be wrong if  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  want to put a proposal in order to appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe  emotions  of the public instead of  putting  up  a\r\n\r\nproposal  that  would best serve the interests  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.  And  what is more important is  that  whatever\r\n\r\nproposal  we  put forward to the electorate  for  their\r\n\r\ndecision, it must be one that can be acceptable to  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Original Question was,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this House resolves that the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore be asked to express their choice on the  mode\r\n\r\nand  manner of the inevitable reunification of the  two\r\n\r\nterritories  and  that a referendum  be  held  for  the\r\n\r\npeople   to   decide   between  the   alternatives   of\r\n\r\nreunification on the basis of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the constitutional arrangements set out in\r\n\r\nPaper Command 33 of 1961 giving Singapore autonomy  in\r\n\r\neducation and labour; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a complete and unconditional merger as a state on\r\n\r\nan  equal  basis  with  the  other  eleven  states  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the constitutional documents  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which an amendment has been proposed ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"At end, to add ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to enter Malaysia on terms no less favourable\r\n\r\nthan the terms for the Borneo territories.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, \"That the words proposed to be\r\n\r\nadded, be there added.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is good to\r\n\r\nsee the Member for Cairnhill being so considerate and\r\n\r\nsolicitous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the welfare of the people of Singapore.

He  is\r\n\r\nalso very modest - he does not want to claim that it  is\r\n\r\na  S.P.A. question. It is merely a contribution towards\r\n\r\nthe  giving of more forms of merger for the  choice  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore. Yet in his explanation,  we\r\n\r\nhave  heard no explanation. What is this term \"no  less\r\n\r\nfavourable than the terms for the Borneo territories\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill always\r\n\r\ntalks  of the P.A.P. and the ex-P.A.P., and somehow  or\r\n\r\nother  he  always appears to come out best.  All  those\r\n\r\nthings  that are false belong to the P.A.P. and to  the\r\n\r\nex-P.A.P. All the good things belong to the S.P.A.  But\r\n\r\nsee what a somersaulter the Member for Cairnhill is! We\r\n\r\nsaw  that somersault when he was talking about  clauses\r\n\r\n28 and 29 in the Referendum Bill. And now we again see\r\n\r\nanother somersault. Why do I say this? If you remember,\r\n\r\nSir,  the Member for Cairnhill very categorically said,\r\n\r\n\"If  you  want  to offer questions to the people,  then\r\n\r\nfirst  of  all  you  must have  an  unqualified  and  a\r\n\r\nqualified  answer.\" If, for example,  in  the  case  of\r\n\r\nmerger,  the first question to be posed to  the  people\r\n\r\nshould be \"Do you want merger?\", and if the answer came\r\n\r\nback  with  a  \"no\",  he  said  that  it  would  be  an\r\n\r\nunqualified  \"no\". But if it should come  back  with  a\r\n\r\n\"yes\",  then it would be a qualified \"yes\".  Therefore,\r\n\r\nhis  contention was that if you want to test the  views\r\n\r\nof  the  people on this merger issue, you should  first\r\n\r\npose  the  simple question asking whether  or  not  the\r\n\r\npeople wanted merger. And if the answer came back  with\r\n\r\na  \"yes\", then you can pose the various types and forms\r\n\r\nof merger to the people. All these records can be found\r\n\r\nin   the   proceedings  in  Select  Committee  on   the\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill. And not only in Select Committee.  His\r\n\r\nSecretary-General,  Mr Lee Kim  Chuan, also  publicly\r\n\r\nstated  the same stand in the University Forum a couple\r\n\r\nof  weeks back; and again in the Anson mass rally, also\r\n\r\na  couple  of weeks back.

As far as we know, there  was  this\r\n\r\nMalaysia Solidarity Consultative Committee that\r\n\r\nwas supposed to have been a consultative body but\r\n\r\nwhich was very smoothly turned into much more  than\r\n\r\na  Consultative  Committee.

That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  when you talk of terms not less favourable for  the\r\n\r\nBorneo territories, it is very puzzling, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prime Minister -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are always puzzled. That is\r\n\r\nthe trouble!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is impossible to believe that\r\n\r\nthis  alternative which the Member for Cairnhill  wants\r\n\r\nto pose as a third question in the referendum is really\r\n\r\nan  honest one. But as regards the alternative and  how\r\n\r\nit compares with the others, I think I will only deal\r\n\r\nwith it when I come to speak on our own amendment.  But\r\n\r\nwe  believe that if there's any alternative on  the\r\n\r\nterms  of the Borneo territories, then it must  be  the\r\n\r\nterms which express the wishes and aspirations of\r\n\r\nthe  people in Borneo. If they are merely terms imposed\r\n\r\non them by the colonial Government, then they are not\r\n\r\nterms   which   can   be  very  favourable   to   those\r\n\r\nterritories.  The only way to find out  whether  such\r\n\r\nterms  express the wishes of the people on not is  to\r\n\r\nfirst   have   a  general  election  in  those   Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories. Only then do we consider that it  is  a\r\n\r\nfair alternative and an honest one. As it is, Sir, it\r\n\r\nis  like  buying a pig in a poke, and it is  definitely\r\n\r\nunfair  to  the people of Singapore. Surely we  do  not\r\n\r\nexpect the people to choose something they hardly know\r\n\r\nanything  about. Does the Member for Cairnhill  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  we  give a blank cheque to the P.A.P. after  all\r\n\r\ntheir distrtions and dishonesty? That is asking a  bit\r\n\r\ntoo much, Sir. For this reason we oppose this amendment\r\n\r\nto  put  this third question to the people. Of course,\r\n\r\nwe must try and understand the motivation   behind  this  so-called  third  alternative\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Government so willingly accept as  a  third\r\n\r\nalternative   to  be  posed  to  the  people   in   the\r\n\r\nreferendum.  They hope to gain a great  deal  from  the\r\n\r\nconfusion  that will be caused in the  minds  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  by having more alternatives. I do now know  how\r\n\r\ntheir  mathematical calculation  works,  but  by  the\r\n\r\ndivision  of  votes which oppose the White Paper,  they\r\n\r\nhope  they  would thereby be able to confuse  a  good\r\n\r\nsection  of  the  people  of  Singapore  to  supporting\r\n\r\ntheir  White Paper merger proposals. It becomes  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  to understand this third question suggested\r\n\r\nby the Member for Cairnhill especially when we remember\r\n\r\nthat  S.P.A. have publicly stated that they  support\r\n\r\nthis White Paper merger proposals. How do you reconcile\r\n\r\ntheir contradiction? It does not work out. The S.P.A.\r\n\r\nsupport the White\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPaper   merger   proposals.  The  White  Paper   merger\r\n\r\nproposals are going to be posed as one question.  Yet\r\n\r\nthe  S.P.A. are now suggesting a new question. Do these\r\n\r\ntwo  questions amount to the same question? Or are they\r\n\r\ndifferent?  If  they are different, then  the  S.P.A.\r\n\r\nmust come out openly and say that they oppose the White\r\n\r\nPaper merger proposals. How do they reconcile all  this\r\n\r\ncontradiction?   There  seems  to  be   some   confused\r\n\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> No, no!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I hope that the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park, who says \"No, no, no\", will  be\r\n\r\nable to enlighten us. But all in all, we do not believe\r\n\r\nthis alternative which they want to suggest to  the\r\n\r\npeople  is an honest one. It is meant to  help  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and to further confuse the people  as  regards\r\n\r\nhow  they  should  oppose the  P.A.P.  White  Paper\r\n\r\nmerger  proposals. I hope that if the  S.P.A. were really\r\n\r\nsincere in their offering an alternative to the people, then \r\n\r\nlet them go back to their original stand, namely, let them \r\n\r\nsuggest , and let the P.A.P. accept, their orginal stand of first\r\n\r\nposing a question that asks for a \"yes\" or \"no\".\r\n\r\nIf it is a \"no\" it becomes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Their stand,  as\r\n\r\norignally  stated and as appeared in black and  white\r\n\r\nin  the Select Committee proceedines, is, let there  be\r\n\r\nfirst a question on merger itself, \"yes\" or \"no\"; and\r\n\r\nfollowing a \"yes\", let the different forms of merger\r\n\r\nbe  posed. As it is, we feel that the S.P.A. and  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are  just  in cahoots hoping  to  deceive  the\r\n\r\npeople in order that they may push through their  White\r\n\r\nPaper merger proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the words proposed to be added,\r\n\r\nbe there added.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 28; Noes,\r\n\r\n14: Absent, 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Ayes.
